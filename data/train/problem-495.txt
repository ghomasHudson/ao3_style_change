Note: I’ve decided that vampires drink tea. Or rather, can drink tea. Because you know what? I can’t imagine Mycroft Holmes, so thoroughly British, not drinking tea. Cheers.
Sherlock watches the surprise on John’s face at the revelation and grins around the lovely penis in his mouth. He’d walked in on Mycroft enough times over the years growing up to be familiar with that particular idiosyncrasy. He closes his eyes and focuses on the cock, John’s cock, that’s in his mouth. If he’s true to himself, he’s wanted to do this for a very long time. He presses his tongue against the tip and watches John’s eyes close with pleasure.
Sherlock was half way up the front steps before John even got out of the car. He turned around impatiently and rolled his eyes.
“Here,” John murmured, “Right here. This spot smells so absolutely delicious that I think I’m just going to have to mark you. Right. Here.”
“Not quite yet,” Sherlock replies with a smile as he takes just the tip John’s cock between his lips. He lets it slip out. “But I am glad to hear that you’re open to the possibility.”
Mycroft silently took the mobile from his hand placed it on the table. Beneath him, Greg relaxed into the couch as his lover nuzzled his neck.
Sherlock pulled back and looked him in the eyes. “Now I’m going to give you what you want.” The feral smile that slowly spread across his face showed both of his fangs as they slowly extended.
“And, if I may be so bold, Dr. Watson, may I ask if my brother has fed from you? I realize that it’s rather personal, but I am asking for my brother’s health. He has, in the past, not fed often enough and found himself weak.” He spat out the last word.
John turned over. Without prompting, he pushed his arse up in the air and rested his head on the pillow.
John wrinkled his nose at the idea of Mycroft knowing what they had just done, but then he was a  whole lot more comfortable with sex in general since meeting Sherlock. Vampires were remarkably sensuous creatures.
“Oh, um, well thank you, I suppose.” John wasn't sure how he felt about this. He decided to watch London pass by through the windows.
The room settled into silence, all eyes focused on the pair in the middle of the room. At some unseen signal, Mycroft helped Greg stand. He silently released the tie around Greg’s waist and pushed the robe to the floor. Greg was completely naked underneath and lowered his eyes. Mycroft quickly removed his own robe, revealing himself to the gathered witnesses. The vampire took Greg’s hand and guided him to sit on the bed cross-legged before settling into the same position across from him.
You: Mycroft walked confidently through the hospital, leaving the paperwork to Anthea, who would smooth out any issues with him leaving the hospital with Gregory in tow. He smiled to Sally as he quietly opened the door to Greg's room and closed it quietly behind him. He nearly laughed when he saw that Gregory was holding a pillow to his face. He approached the bed and gently touched his hand.
Stranger: Greg nodded sharply, regretting it immediately when his head pounded again. He scowled at his fork and somehow managed to get into his mouth without incident, by the end of the meal managing to take back most of his depth perception, although he had been forced to threaten Mycroft with death by fork stabbing multiple times when he missed his mouth a bit and ended up with ravioli sauce smeared across his cheeks.
“So soft and hot, blood pulsing just under the surface of this pretty skin,” Sherlock murmured. “And all mine.”
When silence fell on the room, John sat back and watched the fire, Sherlock still sprawled across his lap, unmoving. They were both still hard and John waited, letting his boyfriend work out whatever problem it was in his mind.
Sherlock frowns. This man is selling off His John  like a piece of good looking meat. Up for the highest bidder. How vulgar. Besides, this ridiculous announcer doesn’t know the first thing about what makes John Watson so amazing and interesting. He doesn’t know anything about how John always manages to ask the question that helps Sherlock make the final deductions. He doesn’t know how John learned to merely smile and shake his head at the body parts Sherlock sets up as experiments in the fridge.  He doesn’t know that John once shot a man to save Sherlock’s life.
Sherlock picked John up easily and carried him to his bedroom where he deposited him on the bed. John hastily began taking his clothes off. He knew he looked a bit disheveled and desperate. And he didn’t care.
Mycroft snorted softly. “Oh, don’t I ever.” He quickly typed out a text to Sherlock before turning his attention to the beautiful man pinned beneath him. He ground his half-hard shaft downwards. “Now, about that
Sherlock smirked. “Mine,” he growled again. He gave into temptation and leaned down to bite into the tempting bared skin. He ignored the whimper that John made and sucked out more warm blood, relishing the taste before he pulled away. He didn’t bother to lick the wound closed, instead letting blood ooze down John’s neck.
“I want to keep you safe. Protecting you is my responsibility.” He paused. “Don’t ever tell Mycroft I said so. He’ll be offensively smug for a week.”
In response, Sherlock bites down softly, eliciting a soft grunt from John. John reaches up and tangles his fingers in Sherlock’s dark curls and pulls him up for a hungry kiss.
They rode the elevator to the third floor and walked down a ostentatiously decorated hall. Sherlock pushed through the double doors without pausing.
As Sherlock plunders John’s mouth, Mycroft unbuttons his shirt to reveal his toned chest. He smiles and leans down to place soft kisses along John’s collarbone and then down, down the pale chest to the faint trail of hair leading down and disappearing beneath black slacks.
Sherlock lightly grasped John’s wrist and sat on the sofa, guiding John to sit next to his unwounded side. Sherlock unbuttoned the cuff and rolled up the sleeve, revealing John’s wrist and forearm. Long, pale fingers ran almost teasingly over the soft skin on his inner wrist. John swallowed.
Sherlock sat on the bed, intently watching him, almost regal in the way he waited for his prey to come to him. After a moment, John lowered his eyes and knelt on the soft rug. He ran his hands up Sherlock’s legs and looked up into his eyes. He silently unzipped his trousers and pulled out the vampire’s hard shaft. He leaned forwards and licked at the tip, eliciting a gasp from Sherlock.
“But of course!” the Registrar said. “Though it would seem that not completing this would make Mr. Holmes uneasy, you are not legally obligated to do this. If you read the details of your contract, the agreement does not allow for bonds and claims made without your volition. In fact, you
“Show me.” It wasn’t a suggestion and John pulled up his left sleeve to reveal the two small puncture marks on his inner wrist. Mycroft leaned forwards in interest and looked closely. “Interesting.” He leaned back. “You should know that my brother usually doesn’t feed directly from his donors.”
In the car, Sherlock was surprisingly not buried in his mobile. “Sherlock. You can call me by my name, instead of…other titles,” the vampire said after a moment.
In the loud silence that follows, long, talented fingers entwine themselves with John’s.  “Well, I suppose this means you get me to yourself,” John says somewhat hesitantly.
John blinked up at Sherlock. For all that the vampire could ignore the emotional needs of the humans around him, he could sometimes be very astute in that area. “I suppose, yes. So now what?”
John smiled at that. “Always looking out for me,” he murmured. He stepped closer. “What if….what if I’d rather not leave at all?”
Mycroft gave Greg an encouraging smile and reached out to place a hand over the human’s heart. He could feel the organ beating out an anxious pater. “Take a few deep breaths, love,” he murmured. Greg obeyed and Mycroft felt the heartbeat slow a bit. “Good.” Mycroft kept his hand there, feeling the whirlwind of emotions of his beloved singing through the man’s blood. Anxiety, passion, love, determination. He smiled. He lifted Greg’s hand and kissed his palm.
“Thanks,” Greg said with a grin. “Well, almost married. There’s still the next bit. And uh, thanks for agreeing to be one of our witnesses.” He ran a hand nervously over the back of his head.
“Well, I can tell you that Mycroft and I were sort of surprised he chose that particular type of claim.”
“Yes, I cannot have you wandering around London carrying my sigil wearing anything less than the best. My family’s enemies will sniff a weakness. It could cause problems. That and Mycroft would never let me hear the end of it.” He flashed John a smirk that showed just the tip of a long extended fang.
Sherlock smiled and ran his hand over John’s bicep. “I think I can forgive you for submitting to your baser nature. As long as I get something to eat as soon as we’re separated.”
“Soon, soon,” John crooned as he pushed another finger inside. He didn’t think that Sherlock needed much stretching, but the worry of hurting him managed to make a dent in John’s hormone-addled brain.
“Come,” Sherlock said simply and held his hand out. He positioned John so that he was sitting on the vampire’s lap, back to front. He pulled John flush against his chest.
“Perhaps I’d like to have him at my disposal for longer than a cup of coffee. Perhaps I enjoy his conversation,” Mycroft says as he picks up his tablet for the second round of bidding.
John cums with a grunt, fingers grasping the sheet on either side of Sherlock’s head. He spills out over Sherlock’s belly in three long spurts.
John is surprised that the touch is so hesitant, for a Holmes. He pushes forwards just a bit, increasing the pressure, and they begin to kiss in earnest. John blindly puts his brandy glass on the table and grasps Mycroft’s thigh. He leans back just a bit and then he has half a lap of Mycroft. They pull apart, breathing heavily.
“Well. You could find out. Come to our place for dinner on Saturday. I’m sure something will arise that will require some…attention.”
Stranger: Greg hummed contently against Mycroft's hand, "A bit, yeah. Nastiest headache I've ever had and I've taken quite a few hits in my day." He nestled down closer into Mycroft, feeling incredibly tired all of a sudden.
Stranger: "You're hard, already?" Sherlock raised a brow in interest. "Naughty boy," he whispered, trailing his hand in between John's legs and lightly stroking one finger up his length.
Sherlock inclined his head. “Yes ma’am. Soon. I was hoping to have the witnesses ready when they are.”
“Mummy, you’re going to make yourself cry,” the older Holmes brother said, gently kissing her on the forehead. He turned towards Sherlock, who was dressed in a bespoke black tuxedo with a deep purple tie and waistcoat. “Besides, doesn’t Sherlock look handsome himself?”
Sherlock nods, the smile on his lips twisting in a way that could almost be predatory. He is still leaning casually against the door. “It occurs to me that I should know. It’s important to know these kinds of things, especially since so many people are motivated by it.”
Still pinning John down, Sherlock reached over to the nightstand and grabbed the bottle of lube he kept there. He roughly pushed John’s left leg up and out, revealing his hole. John inhaled sharply at the sudden stretch. Sherlock ignored him and squeezed some lube down John’s cleft. He smoothed the lube around John’s hole and then pushed one long finger inside.
You: Mycroft patiently helped Greg inside. One of his people had delivered dinner and he could smell it from the kitchen. But the house was empty as he had instructed. "Living room on the big couch?" he asked once inside.
“Yes. I had hoped it wouldn’t take him so long, but I suppose nothing has actually happened to John in the past four months.” He paused and sniffed Greg’s neck with a happy hum. “I took you, what, two months after our first date?”
John stills Sherlock’s hand with his own, the dark haired man looks up at him, a flash of doubt on his face.
Stranger: "Quiet sounds lovely, but don't you dare." He murmured, exhausted, "God, I'm getting too old for this nonsense but I'd go mad without it. Completely unfair." He reached blindly for Mycroft's hand, giving up and waggling his fingers, inviting Mycroft to take his.
Mycroft ushered Greg out through a side door, deftly avoiding starting conversations with wedding guests. John watched as the door slipped closed behind them. “Mycroft is taking Gregory to prepare for the bonding. A blushing bride Gregory may not be but I believe Mycroft still wishes to ensure that he feels safe and cared for.”
“Don’t thank me yet,” he replied, getting into his cop car that was parked outside of 221B. “See you Saturday.”
When Sherlock was spent, he lay back, panting harshly. John leaned down, sniffing the juncture of Sherlock’s neck. When he found the right spot, just below his ear, he latched on and bit down. He worried the skin between his teeth, ignoring his mate’s whine.
“"Questo non è né qui né là, cugino. Dico che è così, e la mia parola è definitiva in questa famiglia."
Greg paused and eyed him. The vampire was leaning on an arm and he looked calmer than at the beginning of the conversation. “Feeling less tense, love?”
“Thank you John. But I think I’m going to rest. You should rest, too. You’ve just lost blood. Sit down before you fall and injure yourself.”
John nods as if this is exactly the type of conversation he expects to have in the middle of the night when his flatmate bursts in on him masturbating. “By sex? Well, yes.”
It takes a few minutes, but the two brothers setup a rhythm of pushing back and forth, back and forth, sharing him between them. Still holding on with one hand, John grasps one of Sherlock’s achingly tempting ass cheeks in his hand. He squeezes hard and is rewarded by a particularly strong thrust into his mouth. Sherlock fights the urge to grab John’s head and slam into him repeatedly.
Greg smiled a bit, remembering when Mycroft had brought him to the same office a couple of years ago to go through the same ritual. “Yeah. Scared me to death actually.”
When John tasted a bit of blood, he pulled back and let himself go. He came deep in his husband’s body, grunting at the effort. John collapsed on top of Sherlock and lay there, panting. Sherlock lowered his legs and winced. He’d almost forgotten that they were still tied together. John gently rolled them onto their side and helped Sherlock keep his top leg high up on John’s hip.
In their en-suite bathroom, Mycroft started the shower while Greg stripped off his clothes. Mycroft did the same, and he pulled Greg under the warm spray. The DI leaned back against the wall of the large shower and sighed happily as the hot water cascaded down his bare skin.
“I think he likes it. I think the two ‘em had nannies who coddled them as kids and let them run amuck and never had a solid bed time.”
The vampire crowded into his personal space and held John’s chin in one elegant long-fingered hand. He paused, eyes flicking quickly over John’s face, reading every minutia. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and soft and fast. “John, when we first met, I told you that I…appreciate your unique blend of skills and abilities. I have since found, during our short acquaintance, that….” Sherlock paused and ran his eyes over John’s face again, “that you are too precious of a commodity to not protect. My blood will offer you more than a mere vindico blood mark would do.”
At the same time, Greg and John looked up the wall of the warehouse to where Sherlock Holmes crouched half-way up, seemingly effortlessly holding onto the wall. His eyes were focused on the distant door where the teams would enter the building. As if hearing them, he turn suddenly and looked down at the two men.
In a public, ok semi-public, place for Lord’s sake. But half of John hummed along happily and urged his to spread his legs wider for this eccentric vampire.
John’s eyes close and his head falls back against the wall. The hand touching him so intimately doesn’t move. It just…presses, forcing him to feel. He opens his eyes. Sherlock is staring at his face intently. “Fuck, Sherlock,” John breathes, swallowing and licking his dry lips.
Greg grinned down at him. “I thought you might appreciate that. Besides, those trousers were kind of tight.”
“I think you’re making us feel incompetent,” John said with a chuckle as he rested his hand on Sherlock’s thigh and squeezed. “We usually just get takeout from the Chinese place down the street. My hours at the clinic change around a lot…”
Stranger: Sherlock moaned, "Naughty boy." He said, reaching over to grab the lube. "In that case, John Watson, I'n going to fuck you so hard and you're going to take every inch and love it." He commanded, pressing his now lubed cock inside him.
Stranger: Greg's eyes widened at the sudden protest of him pulling away, moving back he placed his hand on Sherlock's hip. "We can take things slow, don't worry about my, uh... problem." He said with a nervous laugh.
Lestrade snorted. “Yeah. Do you ever talk to him about that kind of stuff? Does he know that he hurts people with his…choice of words?”
At 11:45am John sat on the small bed in his room. He snorted as he considered that it had hardly been “his” for a while. He had been spending more and more time in Sherlock’s room. In Sherlock’s bed. He tapped his finger on the edge of the bed. The truth was that he didn’t really want to go. He knew he should. Most humans would probably be running out the door by now eager to be as far away as possible.
Sherlock growled as his cock slipped between John’s arse cheeks. He held John’s upper hand and pinned it to his chest as he started to push his cock back and forth, setting up a quick rhythm. John obligingly squeezed his cheeks tightly around him. Sherlock imagined when he would be able to have John Watson splayed out beneath him, completely naked and at his mercy. His mind cataloged the things he would do to him, with him.
Greg obediently turned around and rested his arms on a sturdy towel bar. Without being asked, he spread his legs a bit wider than shoulder-width. For a moment, Mycroft sat back on his heels and admired the image of Gregory Lestrade with water cascading down his back. He decided that this was possibly one of the most erotic things he’d ever seen.
“Has probably had at least four energy drinks since he woke up this morning,” Sherlock said with a snort. He looked around. Mycroft had arranged this suite for their honeymoon in Paris. They had spent the wedding night at Holmes Manor, and not surprisingly, they had both collapsed into bed exhausted. He tried not to think about John beneath him, naked…he shook his head and walked to the window. They had a view of the Eifel Tower. It would be a beautiful view at night, he mused. Speaking of beautiful…he turned to where his husband was sitting on the couch. Husband. The word sounded odd to his mind.
“Yeah, I’ve got a 10am date with a vampire. Don’t want to be late,” John said grimly and slammed the empty glass down on the table.
Mycroft’s long fingers grab John’s hips as he sets up a strong pace, allowing himself to let go and give into his baser instincts to rut like an animal. As he pushes in and out, reveling in the tightness of John’s passage, he knows his hands are probably forms bruises on his hips, but he simply doesn’t care. Watching his brother losing control and being sucked off is too arousing to last long, but he keeps going, willing himself to keep his open and on the beautiful sight before him.
John snorted. “He sent it by text of all things. Said I’m to meet him at – hold on.” He pulled out his phone and pulled up the text. He showed it to Greg.
Sherlock inhaled sharply at the sight. He ran his thumb over the skin and leaned in close, his lips barely touching John’s ear. “I will take more blood than before, and it will leave you weak and at my mercy, John.” John shivered and bit his lower lip. Slipping into predator mode, Sherlock smiled and led him to the sofa.
Crap. Does anyone even know where he is? For all he knows, nice Annabelle enjoys hacking up younger men in her manor basement. He had mentioned to Sherlock that he was volunteering for the charity gala, but he doubt it had registered in his flatmate’s mind. Hell, Sherlock has probably deleted the information as irrelevant. John runs a hand through his hair and sighs again.
“Learn about -? Wait. You mean that wasn’t just brotherly teasing? I thought he was just trying to get a rise out of you. Sherlock, are you telling me that you’re a – a virgin?”
Stranger: Greg nodded tiredly, wincing at the intensified aching, "God, yes. I hate hospitals, it'll be quieter at home." He squeezed Mycroft's hand lightly, "Must have looked like a cartoon, I never even saw him. One minute I was running, the next I was on the ground with a headache, bleeding all over the place."
“Hmm.” Mycroft paused and pretended to think about it for a moment. “No. I’m not done with you yet, love.” Mycroft grinned up his fiancé’s body.
Stranger: Sherlock smiled, the look in John's eyes made him turn his back to show off his arse. "Good. Now stop complaining." He said, before sprawling out on the couch in a way that could only be described as seductive.
“You’re utterly gorgeous, Sherlock. I don’t think I tell you that enough. Though you’re even more gorgeous like this, all open and wanton…” John pushed Sherlock’s legs open and knelt between them.
“Aren’t we eager?” Sherlock mutters and watches John’s face as Mycroft push inside. He decides that John’s face while being taken is one of the most arousing things he’s ever seen. He runs his thumbs over John’s jaw line and helps his mouth open. John moans and willingly opens wider as Sherlock pushes his shaft inside.
Perhaps taking pity on him, Greg held up a teapot and poured more tea into John’s mug. “Here you go, mate. You look like you could use another cuppa.”
Stranger: Sherlock buried his face in his neck, grabbing more soap before wrapping his hand again around John's cock.
He turned onto his side and slowly sat up on the couch with a wince. Sherlock stopped playing and approached him with a glass of water.
Half way through the kiss, John pushed Sherlock up and off of him. He quickly straddled Sherlock’s slim waist and pinned his hands above his head.
Just before Sherlock’s lips met John’s neck, he paused and said lowly, “Don’t think you can back out after that, John Watson.”
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise and sat on one of the tall stools at the kitchen island. “So these are your vaunted cooking skills? I had no idea you cooked, brother.”
“That you’ll stay home with me for the next two days. You need a break, and I’m determined to help you relax.” The feral grin that Mycroft gave Greg should have made him shiver in fear. Instead he shivered in aroused anticipation.
John didn’t have the chance to reply. Sherlock lapped up the blood in several long licks, and then his fangs were pushing effortlessly into his neck. John hissed at the still new sensation of being bitten in somewhere that was so much more intimate than his wrist.
Sherlock knelt between his legs and pulled off John’s shoes and socks. Then he stood up and helped John take off his jumper and undershirt, leaving him bare chested. “Lie back on the bed, John,” he directed. As John shifted to the center of the bed, Sherlock pushed off his own shoes and socks, and lay down next to him.
“It will be easier this way,” the vampire said, directing John to lie on his back along the sofa. John nodded, watching him with wide eyes. “Relax, I will not harm you, John Watson.”
John swallowed and panted softly. With his head in that position he couldn’t see Sherlock, and he felt the vulnerable nature of the position in the way his neck was bared to the vampire’s hungry gaze. Between his legs, his cock was hard and leaking. One hand curled around Sherlock’s wrist, where he could feel the inhuman strength in his muscles.
Stranger: "More?" Sherlock smiled and added another finger, both beginning to scissor themselves and move deeper into John, tickling his prostate.
“They’ll bring out the book of fabric samples. You can choose the fabric for several. I will choose the rest,” Sherlock said dismissively.
When he was done, Sherlock knelt there, panting, head hanging down. John soothed his hand over his back. “Shhhh, that’s good. So beautiful like this, Sherlock.” He pressed kisses to Sherlock’s sweat-sheened back, and gently pulled him into an embrace.
The bathroom door closed and John ran his hands through his hair. He was going to be bred. By Sherlock Holmes. He frowned and shifted on his feet, toes digging into the plush carpet.
John opens his mouth again and gapes for a moment. “What do you mean share me?!” he asks indignantly.
Sherlock wriggled his arse in response and stared ahead obediently. John pulled the small tube of lube out of his pocket and slicked up a finger. He braced himself on Sherlock’s hip and pushed a slick finger through the slit and into his boyfriend’s tight arse. Sherlock arched in surprise.
“Yes, they’ll be here later this evening after dinner. I requested that Gregory be allowed to meet you and Xavier without the whole family to contend with….”
John moaned and rolled his hips. He was hard and leaking on his belly. “Please. Fuck! Need to cum,” he whined.
You: "There's lube in the drawer by the shower," John said, still moving his hips, making Sherlock's cock slide up and down his cleft. "But I don't need prep....not after this morning."
Later, in the privacy of his room, John groans softly as he rubs his hand up and down his cock. He gives it a good twist at the end and nearly cries out, barely covering the sound. His head hits the wall behind him with a small thud as he speeds up. Suddenly his bedroom door opens.
John took a deep breath and nodded. Greg moved off and John looked up again at Sherlock. Vampire. Blood drinker. His master. His contract, sold by his poor parents when he was a child, had been claimed by Sherlock just shy of the expiration when he was 34. They were now four months into….whatever it was that was they were doing. On paper, John was in Sherlock’s personal aide, under contract for his services. For whatever the vampire required. Literally. He kept their flat at 221B Baker Street relatively clean and did the shopping. Mostly he helped out at crime scenes by providing medical information on corpses. They ran around London like energetic schoolboys. It was the most fun he’d had in a long time.
And then silence. John counted the seconds and made it to five when Lestrade’s voice came out clear over the radios. “Team two, move!”
John flushed a bit and pretended to be very interested in his drink for a moment. “Thanks. I’m…. well I’m definitely glad that the contract is over. It’s nice to be able to make a choice about it.” He shrugged. “I’ve gotten Sherlock to accept that I’m going to return to being a doctor. Part time for now, but he was a bit miffed that I can’t be available all of the time to run around London with him.” He snorted softly.
Stranger: Greg smiled, brought his free hand up to the back of Sherlock's neck tangling his fingers into the curls that fell there. "You don't have to ask to kiss me, Sherlock. Of course I am amenable."
Sherlock walked John backwards until he pushed him back on the couch. John fell back and looked up at Sherlock, neck arched. The vampire looked down at him, predator to prey.
And then Sherlock kneels up and slowly sits down, letting John’s shaft push inside and fill him. When he bottoms out, they let out a breath, a breath that’s been held in for a very long time.
“It’s time my dear,” he said, ignoring anything he might have heard. He ran his hand along Greg’s back and placed a kiss on his cheek.
“John, if you’re suggesting that I should play housewife for you, you’ve hit your head recently,” Sherlock muttered.
Stranger: Greg looked down at his shoes, shuffling his feet a bit. "You're the bloody genius, Sherlock. I bet you could deduce it if you tried."
“Ma lui non ha alcuna, cugino segno. Si dovrebbe prendere più cura delle tue cose. Potrebbe vengono per nuocere.”
“Not particularly. We are not remotely the first couple to be in this situation. Children born from such agreements are relatively common with the older families.” Mycroft watched Greg. “Are you – ok with this, Gregory?”
“That’s it. This will make it easier.” John nodded and reached up and dug his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. “Hmm, maybe I should have tied your hands,” Sherlock said when John accidentally yanked on his hair.
“You know, there is one thing,” Greg said slowly. “Not to get your hopes up or anything, but I’ve never seen him, well, he’s never
The vampire’s eyes widened when John moved his finger from Sherlock’s mouth to trace it slowly over his own neck, leaving behind a tempting trail of blood. Sherlock’s nostrils flared at the blatant challenge and invitation.
“What way?” John asked with a smile. He ran his hand up and down Sherlock’s side, ignoring the obvious bulge.
Smiling predatorily, Mycroft pulls John closer to him, spreading his legs around him. Long talented fingers explore between John’s legs. Mycroft presses a finger at the hidden back entrance to John’s body, gentle but insistent that he be allowed entrance.
John winced in sympathy. He could imagine that sharp pain that danced on the edge of pleasure tipping towards just pain. It also explained Mycroft’s reference to needles. “What makes some mesh and some not?”
You: John put the newspaper down to cover the bulge in his jeans. "Ok. What sort of distraction? We are not playing Cluedo."
The car stopped in front of Henry Poole & Co. and John followed Sherlock into the store, feeling out of place. They were immediately set upon by a small horde of attendants, who clearly were expecting them. they were ushered into a nice sitting room and John quickly found himself standing stock still as an elderly man, the head tailor, took his measurements. The vampire ignored most of it with his face buried in his phone.
Bright grey eyes paused and flicked to him. Sherlock frowned, blinked once, and then looked back down.
John smiled and leaned against the kitchen counter, watching the vampire look at slides under the microscope. “Anything else I need to know about this?”
Finally Mycroft sits back and turns to John. He runs his hand up John’s thigh again. “John, Sherlock and I…well, we came to something of a decision. About you.” John opens his mouth to protest. “Well, really I should say that I made Sherlock make a decision.” He smiles. “Sherlock was, shall we say, surprised to find that he felt a bit jealous at the idea of you being auctioned off. I had hoped that he would take the initiative and bid on you himself, but be that as it may, I placed a bid on you. I hope you don’t mind,” he says, squeezing John’s inner thigh perilously close to the bulge in his trousers. “So we came to a decision to share you.”
Stranger: Sherlock's strong hands ran over John's skin, making sure every part of his body was covered in soap.
Sherlock growled. With so much fresh blood coursing through his veins, the urge to hunt and dominate was overwhelming. He quickly rolled John over so that they were back to front, and roughly pushed John’s slacks to his knees. John was wearing a pair of red shorts underneath, and he could see the wetness of where he had just cum in them. And as he watched, John’s cock was already hardening again.
Stranger: Sherlock's clothes were scattered on the floor beside him and he opened his eyes, looked into the kitchen where John was, sighed and pulled on his trousers. Whatever. If this was what John wanted, he'll do it. "I've got trousers on!" He called from the sofa, closing his eyes again.
Brandy glass in one hand, Mycroft runs the finger tips of the other hand across John’s thigh. “Oh John. What kind of host would I be to let you sleep alone?”
A sudden crash and shouting had everyone tense and shifting on their feet. John shifted his weight, rolling his shoulder that was getting stiff in the cool autumn air from his own tension. The shouts and noises from the radios were confusing and indistinguishable. Several shots were fired.
Sherlock merely chuckled and removed his fingers. He quickly lubed up his cock and, still holding John’s leg up, positioned the tip at John’s quickly stretched hole. He locked eyes with John and then slammed inside in one powerful move. John keened, throwing his head back as pain ripped up his spine. “Hurts,” he said, voice shuddering.
Sherlock nodded. “Of course,” he replied lowly, eyes moving between the two of them. “We will find the other witnesses.”
“I met his brother, Mycroft Holmes, today. The guy whisked me away in a limousine and asked questions.”
“It appears you are spending enough time with him that the family in Italy has noticed. Perhaps you should make a decision soon.”
He managed to put together what he thought was a rather decent pot of tea. He placed the tray on the counter and was just reaching for a mug when a knock came from the door to the stairs.
“Don’t worry about your attire,” Sherlock said with a note of amusement, “We’re going there for you.”
You: John's nipples hardened into small pebbles. "Then I surrender here and now," he said, running his hands over the skin he could get to
“Predictable? How so? Is the idea that I’d like to spend time with John so incomprehensible to you?”
Stranger: "Aren't you warm, then?" He asked curiously, stepping closer until he was a hair's width from John's body. He reached out and felt his throat, slipping his hand over his shoulder and arm.
You: Mycroft shifted on his seat and his hand stopped moving on Greg's chest. "You don't normally wear it?" he asked through clenched teach. "Gregory..."
“Oh.” John sits back, perplexed, brandy in hand. “I told Sherlock about tonight weeks ago. I didn’t think it even registered in his mind.”
Sherlock looks down his body, noting the cooling seed on his pale skin. He frowns. Must sex be so messy?
“So many choices,” Mycroft said softly. “Though do I believe I said something about tying you up so that you can’t leave my side.”
“Do you – want me to leave?” Sherlock asks, his low voice washing over John’s senses. John hears the moment of hesitancy, insecurity.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked around to the people and vampires passing by them. “Come,” he said, and swiftly turned, making his long coat swirl around him. John hastened to follow. The vampire paused for a moment at the building directory.
Sherlock smirked when he saw John’s reaction. It was dangerous, playing this game with the man lying beneath him. Some humans became addicted to the feeling of being hurt by a vampire and then the subsequent feeling of the skin healing quickly.
You: Mycroft was tempted to lean over and lick the sauce from Greg's lips, but he doubted the man would appreciate that right now. Instead he only offered up the napkin. "How are you feeling now that you've eaten?"
Lapping at the blood, Sherlock glanced up at John’s face and chuckled. “Yes, and what does that make you?” he asked, jerking his hips.
John’s eyes widen as he realizes that it’s possible that that is the most pleasurable touch he’s ever felt. His heart suddenly aches for the other man. He’s so brilliant yet so utterly…innocent in some ways.
“Oh,” Greg replied. “So I wasn’t imaging it.” He looked down. “This is going to take some time to get used to,” he mused.
Sherlock growled and slammed inside in a powerfully primal move to claim John as his own. John cried out, eyes closing as the vampire’s hard cock slammed into his body, fingers tightening in response around the headboard. “Do not let go, John,” Sherlock ordered.
John tugged at the collar of his shirt. “Is it meant to be so tight?” he asked. “I wasn’t aware that cutting off blood flow to the neck was something vampires wanted.”
“Sir, you asked me to report to you on the claim registered by your brother today at the Blood Registry Office.”
“Uh, right. Simul sanguis. Greg said that it’s not the usual mark vampires give humans under contract.”
“So beautiful like that, John,” he murmured, fingers dancing along the back of John’s neck and kissed the top of his head. “So brave, my John.”
“Mmm, yes I do hope so,” Mycroft said, keeping his voice soft and cultured. He reached for the second hand-held shower head on a hose and flicked it on. Grinning, he knelt behind Greg and held his arse cheeks open. Without warning, he aimed the harsh spray at Greg’s tight hole.
“Such a lovely little cock, too,” Mycroft purred. “Of course you’ll never fuck me with it but it’s nice to look at,” Mycroft said with a cruel smirk.
John paid the driver and got out, standing next to his lover, placing a hand on Sherlock’s lower back. “We’re family, love. Family spends time together. Besides, Greg says that Mycroft’s amazing at making salmon, which he’s making for us tonight.”
Mycroft laughed softly. “For going through with the bonding. I know it wasn’t easy to do. And I’m grateful that you trusted me to complete it with the right witnesses.”
Mycroft nods and smiles. He holds his glass up and watches the firelight dance through the amber liquid.
“Gregory, love, Anna is – she holds no place in my heart save for being the mother of my child and heir. She has, since then, found her own mate. Charles, her bonded, is much more suited to her than I would ever be.” He picked up one of Greg’s hands and kissed the front and back of the palm.
Stranger: Greg wiped at his face, reclaiming a bit of his dignity and reclining against Mycroft's chest, leaning his head back against the broad shoulder, "Better. Still have a head ache, but better. Love you."
Stranger: "Maybe." He smiled, moving his hand faster. "I know you wanked in the shower this morning. Tell me what you thought about."
Stranger: "Terrified," Sherlock smiled into his skin, licking over his Adam's apple and down his chest. "Sensitive?" He asked, moving his fingers over John's nipples and playing with them. "They're cute. Like you."
John hung his coat on the hook near the door and wandered into the sitting room. His conversation with Greg over drinks was swirling around his brain, and he sat in what had become
“Perhaps. I’ve had you lie down so that you don’t feel dizzy.” He idly rubbed John’s neck. “Are you ready?”
Sherlock’s body is hot and tight and so welcoming, as he sinks down. John fights the urge to move. Especially when Sherlock wiggles his hips a bit, just. Like. That.
“I understand. Just…do you really want to be responsible for me like this until I die? I’m just a washed up army doctor.”
John moaned wantonly. “Only for you,” he panted. He squeezed his anal muscles again around Sherlock’s cock again, urging him on.
Mycroft was wearing tight navy shorts, and John had no doubt they were silk. Greg sat back and he gracefully draped himself face down over his boyfriend’s lap, still wearing a crisp long sleeved button down shirt. His arse was pointed up on Greg’s lap, making a rather erotic picture.
Stranger: "Hmm, you like when I kiss your neck, John..." He whispered happily, scraping his teeth gently over the sensitive skin. "That's so cute..."
Seeing the wound clearly for the first time, John knelt on the floor in front of him so that he could inspect it further. He gently touched the edges, noting how the skin was torn.
Stranger: Any time, just doing my job. He's got a couple of stitches, a concussion, and they forced a tetanus shot on him, he's in a foul mood. He keeps asking for you, don't tell him I told you that. SD
“Ah. Yes.” Mycroft flushed a bit, a feat considering his normally pale pallor. “That is what Alessandro was here to ascertain. Apparently some of our kind are talking.”
“Not even to save John? How interesting.” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Well, if you won’t be bidding on John, then I’m sure you won’t mind if I do?” Sherlock watches out of the corner of his eye as Mycroft’s long fingers begin tapping on his tablet.
John focused on opening up Sherlock’s body, pushing his fingers in and twisting. And then he smacked Sherlock’s arse cheek three times with his free hand, and Sherlock cried out and came, shuddering through a sudden hard orgasm.
They both groan. John grasps Sherlock’s hips with strong hands and starts to guide him. Together they set up a brutally face pace, the bed squeaking softly with the rhythm. With his hands busy, John watches from beneath hooded eyes as Sherlock rubs his cock in time.
“I haven’t had a personal donor in a very long time. Not since I was much younger. And it wasn't like this is between us.”
The vampire slicked up two fingers and pushed them into John’s anus. John’s breath hitched at the intrusion but after a moment, he pushed himself back, silently asking for more. Sherlock tried to practice patience. He was nearly 200 years old and had practiced restraint for years.
“Well, that’s good. Some people don’t mesh with the vampire that claims their contract and I hear it hurts like a bitch. In those situations, they usually use syringes to remove the blood and store it.”
Beneath him, Sherlock wined, throwing his head back, and presenting his neck in a submissive gesture that made John the newfound alpha in him roar with approval. But not yet. He couldn’t make the bite that would seal their bond until he was inside Sherlock. Very deep inside.
The other witnesses had found seats around the side of the room. In the center, Greg sat on the edge of the large bed, looking up intently at Mycroft’s face, decidedly not looking at the group of people gathered to watch them. Somehow, Mycroft managed to look regal even while wearing a robe. John sat on a soft divan next to Sherlock. He glanced once at Allessandro, who gave him a leer. John looked away.
Stranger: Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and lightly bit his lip, his tongue prodding against John's lips.
The car is now outside of London. It turns into a gated driveway and slowly pulls to a stop in front of a large manor house. He helps Annabelle out of the car and up the stone steps.
“Ok,” John says after a moment, having decided that it is clearly the safest thing to say. Sherlock crosses his arms and leans almost casually against the door jam. He’s wearing his red silk robe over pajamas. His feet are bare. He stares intently at John with a small smile playing on his lips.
“That was excellent,” John said, leaning back in his chair. “Mycroft, you’ve surprised me. I had no idea you could cook like that.”
“No. More like the ability to sense each other. To be honest, those of my kind who are bonded have said that the sensation – the experience – cannot be described in mere words.”
John’s head was titled to the side, and he cried out when he felt two sharp fangs slice through the skin. It
John blushed under Sherlock’s sharp gaze. “You’re not looking bad yourself,” he said, gesturing to Sherlock’s new bespoke tuxedo.
“Mmm, yes. Mine.” Mycroft pulled his hips back and then thrust forward, building a hunger-driven rhythm. He shakily reached between them and removed the cock ring from Greg’s length.
Part of John rebelled at the idea of the whole situation. He was spread out like a sacrificial virgin.
Mycroft smiled. He brought the wounded hand up to his mouth and kissed the palm before claiming Greg’s lips in a passionate kiss.
“But it’s only visible to other vampires. And if it’s permanent then I would always be – be protected by him, right?”
John’s wrenches his mouth away and watches, eyes wide, as Sherlock licks and sucks at him. It’s possibly one of the most erotic things he’s ever seen.
John stood up and offered his lover a hand. “I think we’ll need to buy you more shorts. Do they sell them in other colors? I think we need to get you several.”
You: "Only because you weren't here," John replied, letting his head fall back against Sherlock's shoulder.
“Yes.” He paused and caressed Mycroft’s chin. Mycroft swallowed and then nodded. Greg looked at John pointedly. “You can stay or leave, but decide now.”
Sherlock glanced down to where John was sleeping lightly on his shoulder and frowned. As much as he hated to admit it, Mycroft was correct. He should have laid official claim before now, but he couldn’t be sure…
John took a step closer. The vampire’s nostrils flared. “For starters, I want you to actually feed properly. I can help you. I want to help. If you don’t feed properly you will continue to get weaker. And then one day you won’t heal.” He paused. “I’m right, aren’t I?”
John giggles softly, mind threatening to overload at the sheer oddness of it all as his eyes slip down his body to where Sherlock's hand is still pressing on his cock through the blanket. When he looks up, he catches Sherlock’s eyes moving up from the point of contact.
“Perhaps we should wait until I start to show?” He looked down at his flat belly, imagining it round with their baby.
For a minute, they’re both silent. Finally John said, “So. Do you think that would, uh, be the same for Sherlock? Being brothers and all?”
Greg looked at his beer and considered that this conversation was only made possible by alcohol. Lots of it. “Well. I mean. Ok. Where does he bite you?”
John’s penis was bigger than before. There had to be some mistake. Now that he and Sherlock were married and off the hormonal suppressants, his system should be flooding with the omega hormone that would enable him to be taken by his alpha. To bear his child.
Beneath Sherlock, John began to push his arse back, trying to impale himself on Sherlock’s cock with each thrust. He was blown over by the feeling of sheer strength and power that he felt from every point of connection between their bodies: Sherlock’s hips on the back of his thighs, Sherlock’s hands grasping his hips and fingers digging into his skin, and Sherlock’s cock forcing its way in and out of his body.
The Registrar looked down at the book. One page was complete, the other empty. He smiled. “Ah, the last individual to come here from your House was your elder brother, Mycroft. I assume that they are still happily engaged in each other’s company?”
Mycroft crawled off his lap and stood up, walking to the door that led to the stairs. He paused and looked at John and Sherlock, giving them a smile. “Good evening. I hope you won’t mind if Gregory and I leave you early tonight. You are welcome to stay the night. Or as long as you wish.” With that, he padded out of the room.
“You shouldn’t trust me, John. You’re strong and brave, but so weak to me.” He pulled out and yanked John’s head back by his hair as if to demonstrate how easily he could break the human.
When John deemed him stretched enough, he positioned his hard cock at the entrance to Sherlock’s body. Sherlock spread his legs wide in offering and locked eyes with him. For one moment, they paused, held there. Waiting. Then John directed the tip of his cock into the tight hole and pushed. They groaned in unison and John pushed in until the slightly swelling base of his cock was flush against Sherlock’s ass cheeks.
John moves restlessly on the bed, hard and aching, and he’s fairly sure he can feel cum dribbling out of his stretched hole.  He arches up into Mycroft’s hand, seeking the fastest route to pleasure. Sherlock props himself on his elbow, idly caressing John’s face and neck, and John reaches for him.
“You knew he would be up there,” Sherlock says. “That’s why you invited me to this gauche event. But why? What would you gain from showing this to me, Mycroft?” Sherlock turns away from the stage to glare at his elder brother.
Down the street, the first team moved down the street in short spurts of movement. Above them, Sherlock moved smoothly over the side of the buildings. John was mesmerized by the smooth, alien like motions of the vampire. It was an odd sight, and John noticed some of the officers watching Sherlock’s movement surreptitiously.
Sherlock eyed him, assessing his flatmate and donor. He leaned forwards and said softly, “Considering your reaction previously, perhaps we should wait until we’re home, hmm?”
That evening, after curry takeout, John eyes Sherlock as he pats his mouth with the thin paper napkin. He sits back in the chair, finger nervously tapping on the arm of the chair. Sherlock is thinking. When is he ever not?
Stranger: Greg smiled up at Sherlock, his eyes softening. "I got you to smile." He said with a small laugh, subconsciously leaning closer to the detective, and moving his wrist a bit to try and lace his fingers with Sherlock's.
John smiled. “So. We’ll have to tell our families, you know. About the – well, about the change in roles.”
– are common when one of my kind claims a human under contract, but I do not wish to take advantage of you.”
You: "You should've. We could have done - ohhhh. Feels good!" John glanced down, feeling Sherlock's sharp eyes on him. "I-I thought of your hands. Soapy. On my skin..."
“No wait,” Greg said, stopping Mycroft with a hand on his wrist. “Keep the tux on for now. I think it could help. With this,” he flushed, gesturing to his cock.
John stood with him, hesitant to go back to the party without Sherlock at his side. Particularly after the dark look that Allessandro had given him as he went downstairs. They were, as Sherlock had explained, there as guards. Vampires were particularly tired after bonding and it was a custom to ask someone trusted to keep watch while they recovered.
Where Sherlock’s kiss is hungry and intense, Mycroft’s is calculated and precise, and John feels as if he’s being taken apart carefully and examined, piece by piece.
Stranger: Greg hummed contently and allowed Mycroft to settle him onto the couch, tucking a blanket around him. Another time, Greg might have grumbled about not being a child or some sort of regency heroine, but the blanket was soft, he was tired, and damn it if it wasn't nice to be comfortable. He leaned his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes, waiting for Mycroft to return.
“You ok, mate?” Greg asked, leaning casually against the wall outside of 221B where John was also leaning, arms crossed, frowning.
John paused, making Sherlock glance up at him. “Well, he said you don’t always feed directly from your donors. He was very interested in seeing the puncture marks on my wrist.”
John gasped, eyes wide. The feeling was…extraordinary. There was pain, yes, but it was almost so sharp that it didn’t register. The doctor in John paid attention to the feeling of the flow of his blood to where Sherlock’s mouth was latched on. And then a slight pinch at the fangs pulled out and the tongue was licking him again.
“I think as long as I’m around for the cleaning and stuff, he’s fine.” John shrugged. “Half the time he’s so engrossed in his experiments, I’m not sure if he knows whether I’m even there.”
“No. I wouldn’t expect it to. Any pain you feel now would be solely psychosomatic in nature. It is common for soldiers to feel spasms in cases such as yours periodically over a long period of time after leaving the battlefield.” He states this as if they are standing in a laboratory and he is making a point on a case.
Sherlock growled softly. He yanked John away from the wall and down the hall to his bedroom. He gently pushed John back onto the bed, and the man landed with a soft thump on the bed.
The vampire snorted softly and stepped closer again. He stopped and his eyes narrowed, shifting to John’s left ear. He hissed softly.
The Registrar carefully place the sigil in a metal bowl held over a candle. The candle was pure white and burned with several wicks making the flames touched the bottom of the bowl. The sigil was placed so that the chain hung over the side of the bowl. John watched the flames lick at the metal with a frown. His mind was starting to follow a rather uncomfortable path of thought as to what was about to happen. He clenched his jaw and stood up straighter in military style.
Sherlock stood up swiftly. He let the journal fall to the floor and John took a step back in surprise. The vampire stalked towards John and backed him against the door frame between the kitchen and sitting room. John looked up at him, eyes wide. He swallowed nervously.
When they break apart, they are both panting. John scrambles off the bed and pushes his pajama bottoms and pants down his legs. He stares for a moment down at his flatmate. There are so many things he is aching to do, and it takes a moment for him to focus. He shakes his head to clear it and Sherlock smirks, as if he can read his thoughts on John’s face. He reaches for his hard cock.
John leans up on his elbows, hovering over him, staring down into those beautiful steel blue eyes. Maintaining eye contact, he shifts so that their cocks touch. Sherlock is already half-hard again and he inhales sharply at the feeling, eyes fluttering closed.
Mycroft considered how to go about it. For all that he’d thought of this, he suddenly wasn’t sure what to say. His planned speech suddenly seemed too flowery and stilted.
Sherlock paused his movements and roughly held John’s head to the side. He bit down quickly, losing control of his self-restraint. John’s blood sang on his tongue. How was it this man managed to be so utterly interesting and erotic? He started to move his hips again.
John chuckled. “Now I’ve got an image of Mycroft Holmes sitting around waxing poetic, composing long ballads and odes.”
about it, Sherlock changed the subject, or rushed off. And a couple of times now, they had wanked together without Sherlock feeding from him. Did that make them lovers?
Sherlock’s lips quirked just a bit in response. “I thought you might wish to take the time to pack your things so that you might leave Baker Street as soon as the contract expires at noon.” He looked back down at his notes.
“You want to know if I could lose control and drain you completely. No. I can feel your heartbeat, John,” he said, placing one hand over his heart. “I won’t let it slow to the point of endangerment. I will know when to stop.”
The vampire took the whimper as a sign of approval and began to move. He began to fuck John, not too fast, but his movements were measured and each thrust jerked John’s body on the bed. With his free hand, he grasped John’s hair and pulled his head back. His eyes focused on the pulse point in John’s bared neck.
“And you shall have it, pet. That and more. Everything that I am and have.” He licked the thin lines of blood, healing the wounds. He opened a drawer in a side table and grabbed the bottle of lube he had stashed there when reviewing the room earlier in the day. He coated his fingers and then poured a few drops onto Greg’s exposed balls. He easily pushed two fingers into Greg’s hole, who groaned softly, working quickly to open him up. And leave him wanting.
Stranger: Greg narrowed his eyes and looked at Mycroft warningly, "The blanket was quite far enough, thanks. I'm a police officer of fifteen year not an invalid. I can feed myself." He grumbled, extracting his hand from the blanket and missing the fork completely, depth perception at an all time low. He scowled and made another attempt, to similar results, "Don't you dare laugh at me, Mycroft Holmes."
“No,” Lestrade said firmly. “It’s too late for you to wheedle your way out of this like we’re in the middle of some sort of political negotiation.” He glanced at John for a moment before turning his attention back to his boyfriend. “I think you need some direction, love. I think you need a spanking.” In the complete silence that followed that line, he clasped Mycroft’s chin and slowly directed the younger man to look at him. In response, Mycroft Holmes looked down, silently submitting with a single nod.
Stranger: Greg leaned into the gentle touch of Sherlock's fingers, a sigh escaping his lips. "Yeah? That's good to know."
You: John nearly fell apart as Sherlock pounded into him. His cock was hard and leaking onto his flat belly between them
Mycroft’s movements were hard and fast as he chased the need to claim Gregory completely. He grasped Greg’s hips as he fucked him hard, eyes moving to briefly watch the way his hard cock bounced on his lower belly. It was nearly time. He pulled Greg up so that he was sitting in Mycroft’s lap. They wrapped their arms around each other. “Ride me, pet,” he growled softly. “Show me how much you want to be mine.”
Somehow this was even more arousing, more intimate, and so much more overwhelming. “Fuck! Sherlock. Ohhhhh…..” He was hard in an instant. He could
Sherlock grasped his left wrist, the one that he always fed from, and held it up between them. His thumb rubbed over the inner wrist, pressing hard. John realized belatedly that the way they were pressed together, Sherlock was sure to know he was hard.
“Right,” DI Lestrade said as he crouched down next to John. He was wearing a bullet-proof vest and had disposed of his normal trench coat as it would only be in the way. “The first team will go in at the start with Sherlock. Once they’ve cleared the room, the second team can go in. I’ll be with them.” Around them, other officers were getting ready to move into action. “John, you need to stay here.” John opened his mouth to protest. “No. I know, I know. You’re a man of action. I get it. But, um, this is a dangerous situation. And we need to be careful. Also, he’d seriously throw a fit if you got hurt,” he finished with a shrug.
“Yesss, John,” Sherlock hesitantly runs his hands over the plains of John’s back. To John, it feels like the other man is mentally mapping him, learning every angle, rib, and curve. When he gets to  the mass of scar tissue on his left shoulder, he pauses, his touch softening, becoming gentle.
John laughed. “I did invade Afghanistan, you know,” he said with a snort. “I don’t frighten easily. Especially after having….” he trailed off.
John let out a breath he hadn’t known he had been holding, and he let his head fall back against Sherlock’s chest.
“It’s ok. Let go. I’ve got you. I’m going to give you what you need,” John said, words falling deliciously from his lips.
Greg groaned and dug his finger nails into the vampire’s back as he futilely tried to get enough leverage to push up into his thrusts with his legs bound. “Fuuuck. Myc. More. Please!”
John watched him leave, and then fell into a fitful sleep in which he dreamed of a dark haired vampire whose voice alone made him shiver. When he awoke later, he was alone, which was a good thing considering that he had cum in his jeans.
“The marking. The claiming,” Sherlock said with a half-shrug. “Even after the wound heals, which it will, soon, others of my kind will be able to sense it. To…to smell it.” He slid his hand along John’s neck. “They will all know that you are mi-that you are under my care.”
John’s erection had not wilted at all while he focused his attention on Sherlock. Now, at the simple touch of the other man’s hand, it jumps almost painfully in his pants. He grunts softly and Sherlock smiles at the positive result.
Lestrade shrugged. “He’s got awful habits when it comes to eating and sleeping. A couple of months after we started seeing each other, there was some emergency in Berlin.  He came home and collapsed and slept for 2 days. That’s when I pried it out of him that he hadn’t sleep for 3 days, and barely ate. He looked like shit. I was so scared for him and then I was angry that he wouldn’t take care of himself. In a fit of an argument, I said that next time he pulled something like that, I’d put him over my lap and spank him. He dared me to.” Greg shrugged again and grinned at John. “I took him up on the dare.”
Greg rolled his hips and moaned, throwing his head back. “Please?” he moaned, lost completely in the moment.
“Fuck,” Sherlock grinds out. His eyes open wide, pupils wide and dark. He shakily brings one hand up and touches John’s face. John wouldn’t call it a caress because it isn’t. Sherlock methodically runs the pads of his fingers over the angles of his cheek and chin. As before, John imagines that Sherlock is forming a mental picture, a map, of his body, memorizing every angle and curve. Sherlock runs his thumb over his lower lip, and all John can think of is that if this is mapping, then he would willingly become the other man’s atlas.
After recovering his balance, John looked up at Sherlock and nearly gasped at the heat he saw in the vampire’s eyes. He took an involuntary step back and Sherlock grinned, letting him see his fangs. He swallowed and adjusted his stance, raising his chin in silent defiance.
Sherlock fed somewhat regularly from John, using him as a donor for blood. Just thinking of the feedings made John’s cock ache in his pants. They were erotic and overwhelming and made John feel like the center of Sherlock’s whole world. But if John tried to ask questions, to
The kiss is raw, full of the emotions that John has always half-feared, half-hoped that Sherlock held in check under a carefully controlled exterior. The possessiveness that John felt before rushes up, pushing against his temples as he grasps Sherlock’s biceps tightly and returns the kiss with full fervor.
“No, Greg was right. It’s too late to get out of this.” He lowered his voice and dug his fingers into Sherlock’s stomach. “You know you’re curious, love. Don’t you want to know *why* this is making you so hard? Hmm?”
Stranger: "Oh, I hope not. Wouldn't want to share you with Moriarty," he murmured, sucking a hickey into John's pale neck and shoulder.
Mycroft smiled and stood up and pressed himself flush against Greg’s body. “I have seen many sensuous beings in my years, my love, but you elicit such strong responses that sometimes I don’t know if I can control myself around you.”
Stranger: "Hmm, you like when I kiss your neck, John..." He whispered happily, scraping his teeth gently over the sensitive skin. "That's so cute..."
“He wanted to ensure that we at least meet before you bond. Family is important to him.” He smiled wryly. “I’ve read your dossier. And now that we’ve met I can see why he likes you.”
John closed his eyes and let his head fall back on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock caressed his neck and undid the top couple of buttons on his shirt. He ran a sharp fingernail down the skin, tracing the artery and eliciting a soft shiver.
The two humans turned and looked at the vampires. Sherlock idly played with his violin, looking bored, while the elder Holmes brother casually looked for all the world as if they were discussing the weather.
“Ah, John! I do hope that you are sufficiently rested and healed since your venture this afternoon.” Mycroft smiled obsequiously from where he sat in John’s normal chair.
“I considered it to be a distinct possibility. My brother has shown that John is more to him than a mere contract. Though I doubt John understands that.”
going to bring John tea and see how he is.” With that, Greg tried to walk steadily to the kitchen to pour a mug of tea. As soon as he was sure Sherlock couldn’t see his face, he winced.
Sherlock lay still, breathing hard, eyes closed. John noted that he was still hard. Possibly achingly hard. Silence fell on the room.
Mycroft knelt in front of him and untied his shoes, helping Greg out of his shoes and socks. Then he reached up and slowly unzipped Greg’s trousers. “Commando? My dear husband, how shocking.”
The look that Sherlock gave him made his pulse speed up in ways he didn’t want to examine. “No,” he said after a pause, finally looking away. “I have already begun to heal.” He stood up, pulling John up with him. “Lestrade! I trust you have what you need?”
John double checked the address. 221B Baker Street. Somehow he’d imagined something grander. He knocked hesitantly on the door. After a moment he knocked again.
Alessandro held up his hands in a conciliatory gesture. “Fine, fine. Let’s not fight. We’re family after all.” Neither Holmes brother moved. “I will…tell my mother that you are still working out the details. But you should move soon, cousin. A strong man like this will gain the attention of…others.”
“You’ve been a prat since we came here tonight, and that’s no way to behave when you’re a guest in someone’s home.” John grasped Sherlock’s hair and gently pulled his head back so that he could see his pale eyes, knowing that the other two men were watching them intently.
John reaches between their bodies and grasps both of their erections in his hand. He balances on his left hand, watching Sherlock’s face, as he slowly rubs upwards. Sherlock digs his fingers into the sheets as he groans.
Lestrade lifted his hand and brought it down in the middle of his arse with a loud smack. Mycroft grunted softly. With that, Greg set up a smooth pace, bringing his hand up and down with a regular rhythm. Mycroft grunted and whimpered, but didn’t cry out.
Stranger: In one slow movement, Sherlock was pushed in all the way with a soft groan. "John...." He sighed. "You feel so good."
“It was nothing. I have merely stayed in the same room and listened to your breathing and heart rate,” Sherlock said with a nonchalant shrug.
Stranger: Greg tilted his head a bit further to the side, deepening the kiss and stepping closer to the detective so their bodies were pressed against each other.
John sat back, thinking about it, and glanced at Sherlock. The vampire looked back, unblinking eyes intent on him. “Ok. Yes, I agree.”
“Ahh, well, we’ll have to explore that another time,” John said as he began to undo the row of buttons on Sherlock’s shirt. Sherlock lay still, letting him push his shirt open to reveal the hard planes of his pale chest.
Sherlock had been standing, casually alert and leaning against the wall in the hallway when the bedroom door opened. His sharp eyes flicked to Mycroft who was the first to emerge. “Welcome back, brother,” Sherlock said with a bit of a smirk. “Enjoy your repose?”
Despite his nervousness, Greg shivered and his cock began to fill. He shifted and let his legs fall open even more in invitation.
John slowly was able to move and he surreptitiously eased Sherlock’s hands so that the claws weren’t digging into him. He looked around, noting that no one else seemed to be paying them any attention.
“Hmm, sounds almost like a drug overdose,” John said thoughtfully between bites. “Probably something that affects the basal forebrain-cingulate regions of the brain.”
John felt as if he were being held at the brink of something that would shatter him, and after what felt like an eternity, the vampire pulled away. Sherlock licked at the wounds again to close them and pulled back, eyes intently taking in every detail of John’s face and body. John panted softly and slowly opened his eyes.
Mycroft’s eyes darkened and closed his eyes. He stepped back and ran the loofah over Greg’s arse cheeks. Greg shivered. With one hand, the vampire spread the very enticing cheeks and ran the loofah down his cleft, knowing that the rough material would drive him insane.
At that moment, Mycroft approached them. “Glad to see you’re getting along.” He smiled, though Greg could detect the nervousness in his eyes.
Greg blushed and put the small vase back down on the mantle. They were at the Holmes’s family estate in Somerset. “Sorry. Nervous is all.”
You: John chuckled. "Can't argue with you there." He looked down at his naked body, noting the thin film of sweat on his skin
Greg listened, letting his friend talk. Based on a law negotiated by Queen Elizabeth I and the vampire community of Britain, any human or family could sell a contract for one year of service to a vampire or a vampire family. One year of blood donations and…whatever else the vampire wished. It was a financial arrangement, and people often did it in times of need. One might ask
“A surprise, I’m sure.” Mycroft closes the door and walks to the table. He pours two sifters of brandy and hands one to John and leans casually against the table. “I apologize for the deception, John. I certainly can’t be seen bidding on my brother’s flatmate, regardless of the motivations. You understand.” He gives him a smile that John is sure has smoothed over many political negotiations over the years.
John is about to protest being called a prize, something bid on and won, when Sherlock claims his mouth again as a distraction. Mycroft slowly opens up John’s body in preparation to be taken. He presses his determinedly pushes his long fingers inside, practicing restraint, while Sherlock swallows John’s whimpers.
John leaned on his elbows and looked up at him. He was breathing heavily and he watched as the vampire toed off his shoes and socks, all the while keeping his eyes on the man on the bed. John started to unbutton his shirt but Sherlock stopped him.
“Wait! Wait wait wait. What is this?” John ask, pulling away from him. “Two hours ago I was volunteering to raise money for St. Bart’s, and –“
When Sherlock released his wrist, John stared at it. Two small pinprick wounds were visible, but not other damage.
You: Well, I mean, it doesn't bother me. I'm a doctor. But still....it's just not what flatmates do! -JW
“And I won’t suggest it, love. Politically we need to go back out there. With clothes on,” he said, sitting up. He climbed out of bed and offered Greg his hand. “Shall we?”
Stranger: "Okay, dear. I won't tease anymore," Sherlock smiled, taking his fingers out and positioning himself at John's entrance. "You did," he answered. "I'm coming in."
“A couple of times a year. Eventually he will need to move to England to learn of his heritage and his responsibilities here. But for now he’s still young.”
John’s eyes flicked up to meet Sherlock’s. Thankfully they had returned to the normal grey color. “Why?”
John glanced at his wristwatch, an expensive gift from Sherlock. “Yes, the contract ended about 90 seconds ago. So I can do what I want. I’m a free man. And I decided that I want to stay. If that’s alright with you, of course. But not as your contracted human.” He lifted his chin defiantly. “As your...companion, periodic assistant. Flatmate.”
In response, John pushes back against the older Holmes brother and clamps down. That’s all it takes. Mycroft cries out and cums hard, shuddering in John’s willing body. The sights of this sets Sherlock off. He pushes into John’s mouth hard and cums, shooting down his throat.
Greg cried out in pleasure as he came hard, cock spurting between their joined bodies. He felt Mycroft’s hands on his head, silently telling him to let go. He pulled back, blood on his lips, and rested his forehead on his husband’s shoulder. Strong arms stayed wrapped around him, holding him close.
In response, Sherlock wrapped his legs around his alphas waist and nodded. John pushed back in hard and fast, forcing his knot into his omega’s waiting body. The alpha growled happily, lips pulled back revealing his teeth.
Stranger: "Oh, I hope not. Wouldn't want to share you with Moriarty," he murmured, sucking a hickey into John's pale neck and shoulder.
“No. I wish to complete that task,” he said, voice soft. Sherlock leaned down and unbuttoned the shirt, revealing the white undershirt. He allowed John to pull the shirt off before he pulled off John’s slacks and dumped them on the floor. “Lie in the middle of the bed.”
Sherlock sets up a slightly jerky rhythm, his movements unpracticed but eager. Where other men would close their eyes and abandon themselves to the pleasure, Sherlock focuses his energy on John, watching his face, noting every moan and grimace, the way that he lips part just a bit as his head tilts back. His hand’s movement on their cocks becomes more sure. He discovers that rubbing his thumb over the tip of John’s cock makes him cry out in a way that almost sounds as if he’s in pain. He does it again, revelling in the knowledge that now, at this moment, he is the one making the mild-mannered and soldierly Doctor John Watson rut against him like an animal in heat.
Mycroft smiled and swiftly flipped them over so that he was on top of Greg on the couch. “I think that I should tie you down and not let you leave the house for at least a day. ”
The vampire laughed, licking his way up to John’s neck and then jawline. “Are you going to cum for me, John? I think you’re ready. I think you can cum without a single touch to your cock.” He smirked. “Do it. I want to feel you.”
Greg smiled. The peace was disturbed by his phone pinging with an incoming text. They both groaned. “I’ll let the chief know that I’m on leave so they won’t bother me again.”
You: John inhaled sharply at the feel of strong arms wrapping around him. "Um, I guess it is kind of warm in here..."
John was so surprised by the plea, which in his memory the vampire had never used, that his mouth fell open.
“Heavy use of the reses ability can be dangerous. As a precaution, I have been monitoring your breathing and heart rate while you were sleeping.”
Greg leaned forward and examined the burn mark behind John’s ear. “Yeah, it’s healing fine. You won’t be able to see it by the time the week’s out.”
John smiled faintly and swallowed under that intense gaze. “Isn’t that why you like me?” he tried for levity.
“Fight me,” Sherlock finished with a grin. In a blink he flipped them over so that he was pinning John to the bed with his hands, hips pressing down into him. “Do you want to fight me, John?” he asked in a whisper, lips barely touching John’s.
Still, he couldn’t help but lean down and gently mouth that tempting skin between his teeth. He kept Sherlock’s hands above his head.
In the bedroom, Mycroft and Greg lay on the bed, tangled in each other, eyes closed. They both dozed, content in the knowledge that Sherlock and John were keeping watch. Eventually, Greg opened his eyes. He watched Mycroft. The vampire was sleeping and looked completely at peace. He thought he could feel something different, like he knew that Mycroft felt at peace in a way that went beyond sight.
John nodded into the pillow and tried to follow Sherlock’s directions . It felt…odd. He had fiddled around a bit with mates in the army, but those were one-offs, and he had never taken it like this. But Sherlock hadn’t fed recently and his skin was cool to the touch. John hissed when Sherlock’s cock rubbed along his prostate.
Greg licked his lips, their audience at the back of his mind, as Mycroft teased the flat of a sharp claw up his hardening cock. Greg pushed himself up on his elbows, eyes focused solely on Mycroft’s, which had darkened with lust, tinged with red. Mycroft took a hold of his already slick cock and guided the tip into his hole. Greg whimpered, letting his head fall back, revealing his neck.
“I won’t argue with you there,” John said with a small amused snort. He took a deep breath and voiced the questions that had danced around his mind since receiving the summons. “But still, isn’t this a bit sudden? And why me? Why now?”
Stranger: Not at the Yard. Was chasing a suspect and he hit me with a pipe from around a corner. Sally's typing for me. At hospital. GL
Sherlock eased John’s legs open so that they draped on either side of his lap and then opened his slacks. He mouthed kisses on John’s neck as he pulled out John’s half-hard cock. John keened softly and pushed his hips up.
Stranger: Sherlock saw this and continued to finger his lover open just to tease him and added a third finger, drawing out the preparation.
“I prefer to think of it as being free of the distractions of sexual intercourse that, by its nature, would interrupt my deductive thought process.”
“For me,” Sherlock echoed. Sherlock focused and allowed one nail to grow into a sharp claw. He sliced into soft flesh of his own thumb pad and allowed blood to ooze out. He then did the same to John and pressed the claw carefully down the skin behind his left ear. He ignored John’s hiss of pain and pressed his bloody thumb to the fresh wound, making sure that their blood mingled. Sherlock then picked up the sigil by the chain. It was now hot and he held it carefully away from them with one hand.
“No. Alessandro is either incompetent, unpracticed, or very nervous and sloppy. Probably some combination thereof as he is young and somewhat impulsive. He used it far too heavily on you, which is why you felt woozy and slept afterwards. If used properly, you won’t subsequently feel negative effects.”
Sherlock leaned back against the wall with a soft moan. John grinned and moved in, kissing his neck and collar bone, nipping at the skin.
Mycroft smirks and leans down to mouth John’s neck, which is temptingly stretched out beside him, and he gently palms John’s cock through his slacks. He’s pleased to find it hard and hot through the layers of fabric.
“I’m in agreement with you on that one.” He shifted uncomfortably. “So…are there, I don’t know, consequences of this? I know it won’t change me into a vampire.”
John looked up at Sherlock from beneath hooded eyes. He was being fucked for the first time in years, and his body sung with the competing feelings of pleasure and pain and fullness and being taken and owned and possessed.
Stranger: A shudder ran through Greg's body when Sherlock cupped him through his trousers. Moaning softly he trailed his hand from Sherlock's hip and brushed his hand against the growing bulge. "I can see." He whispered attaching his lips to Sherlock's again.
Sherlock chuckled softly. “Vampires can, if we choose, make a commitment not entirely unlike human marriage. However, it is rather more…permanent. A blending of souls, if you will. It’s not something to be undertaken lightly.”
“Well….I guess one is what’s involved? I take it it’s a bigger deal than the blood claim thing that we did in private? The uh, simul sanguis?”
“Have maintained a good business relationship. She reports his progress to me. I see him periodically. He is currently in university at Harvard.”
Panting, Sherlock and Mycroft pull out with soft wet sounds, leaving John to collapse on the loveseat.  His cock is hard and leaking. He closes his eyes and groans. Strong arms wrap around him and he’s carried to the bed and laid down gently on the soft expanse of sheets.
“To my knowledge, you assume correctly,” Sherlock said, clearly annoyed at the small talk involving his brother.
Greg saw the blush and snorted. “Ok, so things are going ok between the two of you. Follow…corny as this sounds, follow your heart. You’re a good guy, John Watson. I think your instincts are good. Very good. Follow them.” Greg patted his shoulder.
“Of course,” John said somewhat awkwardly before glancing at Lestrade, one eyebrow raised. Beside him, Sherlock smirked.
“John,” Sherlock said as he sat up. “You have few possessions, even fewer that you care about. You’re not close to your sister and you wouldn’t stay with her if you were with her drinking. You have a job at a clinic where you spend your considerable skills and experience on hypochondriacs and over-protective mothers who bring their children in for one sniffle. You’re extremely skilled. You’re a steady shot and good to have at your back in a fight. I offer you companionship and an interesting vocation, not to mention a chance to use those untapped skills and talents that general society finds useless, and frankly, somewhat frightening. You’re bored. You’re – lonely, if I may point out. You can be a help to me, and I can use your talents so much more effectively.”
Greg wrinkled his face in response. “Yeah,” he said with a sigh, lying back and staring at the ceiling. “Too bad we can’t go on our honeymoon right now.”
With that she was out the door and heading to the grand ballroom of Holmes Manor where the wedding was going to take place.
Xavier eyed Greg warily, who backed away from the group so that he could speak with the young vampire alone.
After a minute, Sherlock pulls off and sits back on his haunches with a self-satisfied look on his face. “Was it enjoyable?” he asks, voice deep.
Mycroft leads him upstairs and down a long hallway covered in gilded artwork. He opens a door and steps aside to let John in ahead of him. The room is somewhat less ornate than John had expected. It feels… comfortable.
After, they lay panting and Sherlock gently laved the puncture wounds with his tongue. He also gently licked at the healing wound behind John’s ear from the day’s earlier marking. John shuddered with a bit of a wince.
“We’re not at the begging part yet,” Sherlock murmured. He knelt between John’s spread legs and casually stroked some lube onto his hard cock. Once done, he pulled John’s fingers free and grasped both of his ankles. He held John’s legs out and spread them up and wide. His eyes focused on John’s hole, tight and winking up at him. He inched closer and inched John’s splayed body up his thighs. He guided the tip of his cock inside of John’s hole and held John’s ankles in a vice grip.
Mycroft beamed. “I’m glad you like it, love.” He kissed his hand. “I - know that this part isn’t easy for you, and I want you to know that I value your trust.” He kissed the inside of Greg’s palm.
“He’s been trying new things in the kitchen when he has the time. And my hours are kind of crazy,” Greg said, “So I don’t get to cook as much. But I try when I’m able. Besides, we still order out plenty, too.”
John quickly read through the information on him. His eyes lingered over the opposite page, where Gregory Lestrade was listed as claimed by Mycroft Holmes. His deep brown eyes smiled up at him. Mycroft’s sigil, also marked in blood, depicted the same lion but with a coiled snake in front, its head rising and tongue sneaking out.
“I know. But still…..” Mycroft gently turned Greg’s head to the right and placed a kiss on the skin behind his ear.
John looked around once and then climbed into the car. It immediately began to move into London traffic. John found himself sitting across from an impeccably dressed man and smiled politely, legs crossed.
“We don’t. But we can’t have you dying of starvation while under my care, can I? Besides, that would make you somewhat useless as a donor. Also, your room is upstairs,” Sherlock said with a bored tone.
Stranger: "The mystery of John Watson's attraction," he answered, taking the blonde's face in his hands and smiling down at his flatmate. "It seems I was a suspect and I've managed to become the criminal."
John next cry died at the familiar voice. The vampire turned and snarled at the intruder. “Non sono affari tuoi, Mycroft!”
For the Offices of Vampiric Internal Affairs, I chose the London County Hall. I mean, why not? The official site has a picture of the building described in this chapter: http://www.londoncountyhall.com/about.html
“Now my dear boy, thank you so much. I just can’t seem to jump up stairs as easily as I used to…” Annabelle leads John to a comfortable sitting room off the main hall. There’s a fire in the fireplace and what looks like a very expensive bottle of brandy with sifters. John frowns. Do little old ladies drink brandy? “Now, make yourself comfortable. That’s a nice young man.” She wanders out of the  room and closes the heavy door behind her.
Mycroft grasped Greg’s chin and forced his head to the side to expose his neck. Greg hissed at the sudden feeling of sharp teeth piercing his skin. The vampire drank more, reveling in the feeling, the taste of it. Sensing that they were both close, he kept his fangs buried and roughly snapped his hips. He tried to hit Greg’s prostate with each thrust, making him cum hard. There was a sudden burst of blood that spurt into Mycroft’s mouth, and his eyes rolled up, overwhelmed. He came hard.
John looks up at the two beautiful men and vaguely wonders if he agreed to bottom, but then two fingers slick with lube press into him, and he hisses in pleasure.
You: "Eh, he's too...too nuts." John groaned and arched his neck, loving it when the sensitive skin there was touched and nibbled and licked
Stranger: Greg trailed kisses down Sherlock's neck nipping and sucking at the pulse point and the sensitive skin behind his ear. "What would you suggest?" He whispered into his ear.
You: Mycroft wrapped his arms around his waist and held him to his chest. "I'll ensure that the man who hurt you pays for it," he said as he smoothed a hand across Greg's stomach. He placed a kiss on his head, avoiding the bandage.
Sherlock keened. He knew logically that his body adapted easily to accommodate his mate’s knot, but it hurt. And it felt good. Unbelievably good. His fingers twisted in the sheets as John began to pound into him roughly. Every smack of skin, every brush against his prostate. Sherlock welcomed all of it.
Sherlock stares at him intensely. For a moment John thinks that his flatmate is about to insult his intelligence. “It seems I didn’t make myself clear. Would you....would you like me to help you with that?” His eyes lower to the still mostly-present bulge visible under the blanket. At this mention, John’s cock perks up in interest.
“No. But you will find that there are a number of advantages. Your aging will become almost nonexistent. You will find yourself to be healthier and more energetic.”
Stranger: Sherlock swallowed thickly and nodded. "Yes, John." He sat up and spread the blonde's legs apart, then spit in his hand. He didn't have lube because sex before meeting John didn't interest him. He smiled down at him and moved his fingers in between John's legs. "Relax for me, John."
“An acknowledgment that the couple has shared something deeply personal and intimate with the witnesses, as well as the fact that the bonding was witnessed.. It is a show of gratitude and ends the ceremony.”
Stranger: "You're ready now?" Sherlock smiled down at him. "Because I think you can use a /little/ more of this," he gently caught the small bundle of nerves in between his fingers and stroked it.
“Sure,” John said as he sat up and blearily shook his head to clear it. He looked down and realized that Sherlock must have removed his clothes. He pulled the covers tight around his waist when he saw that he was only wearing pants. To cover his embarrassment, he picked up the tea.
John sighs and arranges his bow tie again. He taps his finger nervously on the plush leather seat of the limousine.  He’d been bought by some old lady with lots of money who chattered away endlessly next to him. Her name is Annabelle. She has three prize poodles who appear to take up most of her waking hours. He sincerely hopes she isn’t going to make a pass at him, but she keep patting John’s knee soothingly in a manner that reminds him of his granny. Perhaps she only wants to discuss her arthritis and have some tea. John can only hope.
For a moment, neither spoke or moved. And then Greg launched himself at the vampire, pinning him to the couch and kissing his mouth long and hard. When he pulled back, he said, “Yes, yes you fool. Like I’d say no.”
John suddenly finds himself with a lap full of Sherlock. Long lithe legs settle outside of John’s thighs as Sherlock straddles his lap. Their cocks touch and Sherlock whimpers softly, resting his forehead against John’s. John doesn’t think he’s heard Sherlock whimper, ever. He gently presses his lips against the tempting neck and mouths the skin.
“Keep them on,” Sherlock repeated. “Consider it an order that falls under your contract.” He dug a nail gently into John’s nipple and said in a low voice, “You may as well keep them on since I plan to add to the mess in them later.”
John managed a small smile and stepped closer to him. He swallowed nervously but squared his shoulders.
Xavier laughed. “Father is picky. He has high standards. It’s a true compliment that he is doing more than just keeping you around.”
“It didn’t. Until I invited him to join me, that is. We are both invited every year, actually, and I usually make an effort to attend. But then I saw your name on the list of volunteers, and I thought Sherlock wouldn’t possibly want to miss the…opportunity.”
Sherlock’s pale blue eyes focused back on his mother and he smiled. Or tried to while she pressed his face between her delicate hands.
“And I suppose that as a doctor, you’re already used to needles,” Mr. Holmes said with a hint of disdain.
You: Sherlock stiffened slightly when Greg pressed blatantly up against him. His mind was overwhelmed by new information, including the hardness poking into him.
“For a very long time, I see,” she replied. “Mycroft, will your parents be joining us? I do hope to see them before the wedding.”
Breathing harder, John blinked up at him. “Sherlock, you’ve just cut me in 10 different places. Of course it hurts.”
When John puts his hand on Sherlock’s thigh, the other man groans softly, eyes falling shut as if this is the most pleasurable touch he’s ever felt.
John’s attention was on what he could see of Greg and Mycroft descending the staircase when he was slammed against the wall and held there in an iron grip.
“Well, I suppose it could be seen a mark of ownership….which certain political groups, who shall remain nameless, dislike as a matter of conscience.” He shrugged elegantly.
“Evil, evil man.” Greg sat up with a wince and began to pull on the clothes that the vampire handed him.
“That way is a dead end,” Sherlock said, adjusting his scarf. John noticed he wasn’t even winded. “He’s going to be trapped, but he’s still armed. John, stay here to head him off just in case. And get your gun out. You should be ready.”
You: After getting Greg settled, Mycroft slipped off his shoes and socks and padded silently to the kitchen. He prepared a plate of the ravioli and pulled out one of Greg's favorite beers. He brought it into the living room on a tray and sat on the couch next to him. He picked up half a ravioli on the fork and held it up, eyebrows raised.
Xavier eyed their joined hands and snorted. “You two. Everyone will get overwhelmed by all the lovey dovey happening.” He shoved his hands in his pockets and returned to his mother’s side, glancing back once to give them a bit of a smile.
Sherlock pressed his hand to the front of the red shorts. He could feel their combined seed, warm and wet beneath the fabric. He grinned lasciviously. “Keep them on.”
Stranger: Greg leaned heavily against Mycroft, lifting a hand tiredly at Sally as they walked by her, out of the hospital and into the car. As soon as they were inside, Greg managed to squirm himself around until his head was situated on Mycroft's lap, not feeling as many of the small bumbs in the London road as he would have sitting up. "Yeah, well someone needs to keep an eye on that mad brother of yours." He said absently, eyes closed, relaxing against Mycroft.
Alessandro laughed. “Sempre il politico, Mycroft. Avevo dimenticato quanto scivoloso si è.” He looked closely at Lestrade, sniffing the air. “Non solo portare il vostro marchio, ma lui sa di te.” He took another step forward but was stopped when Mycroft bodily stepped between them. “Ah. Si prende più cura del vostro animale domestico che il vostro fratellino.” He threw Sherlock a smirk. Sherlock snarled, lips pulled back to show his teeth in an animalistic motion.
“John, there is something you should know,” Sherlock said sobering for a moment. “Our cousin from Italy, Allessandro. He will be at the wedding along with his mother, Victoire.”
With a bit of a sad smile, Mycroft puts on a silk robe and pads silently to the door. The other two men look at him, John with wide eyes. How had he forgotten that Mycroft was there?
“Excellent. We’ll just take care of the preliminary paperwork and such first,” Melbourne said, slipping back into his jovial demeanor. “I’m sure you won’t be in any condition to do so afterwards, hmm?”
“Then this shall be a new experience for you." Sherlock smiled, showing his fangs.  "You know, many find the experience…enjoyable.”
Sherlock grasped his face and held him still so that he could kiss John deeply. “We have time. My John. We have plenty of time.”
Stranger: Greg sighed and untangled his fingers, running them through Mycroft's soft brown hair, "I know. I'm sorry I worry you so often. 'S what you get for falling in love with a broken down old dog like me." He said with a sardonic smile, tracing Mycroft's cheekbone lightly.
The vampire knelt on the tiled floor in front of Greg and proceeded to wash his legs. He ran his hands up, ever so temptingly close to the area between his legs.
Suddenly it didn’t matter that the roles they had prepared for had been reversed. If anyone had asked, they would have said that it was the first time in his life he’d felt whole, though Sherlock probably would never admit as such to Mycroft.
The touch of humiliation was perfect and Greg whimpered in arousal. Mycroft sneered. He placed one clothed knee on the divan close between Greg’s spread thighs. “Such a lovely morsel for me.” He let one claw extend on a long finger and ran the tip up the inside of Greg’s thigh. A thin line of blood appeared.
John nodded, unsure of why this was a surprise. How would Sherlock do it with needles? Remove his blood via syringe and store it in the fridge?
Somehow that wasn’t what John had expected to be doing on his first day of service to a member of one of Britain’s oldest vampire families. He looked down at his own clothes. The slacks and sweater suddenly seemed rather lower class. He shifted, feeling under dressed.
Stranger: "You're ready now?" Sherlock smiled down at him. "Because I think you can use a /little/ more of this," he gently caught the small bundle of nerves in between his fingers and stroked it.
Sherlock growls. Actually grows  like an animal. And Sherlock Holmes never gives in to his baser animal instincts. He has worked very hard to distance himself from these pesky natural instincts, these coarse emotions. But even Sherlock Holmes has…limits.
