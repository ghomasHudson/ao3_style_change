“Not for a long time until today,” Peter answered before typing his response to his aunt.
Me: At some point you’re going to have to deal with what happened in the other timeline. Maybe with professional help. In the meantime, you can feel less guilty ensuring that your younger brother gets engaged without having to go into deep freeze for 70 some years to rescue her from scary blue aliens after what happened in the Framework/Hydra hell. That’s acceptable lying. It’s OK to lie to save the world. Neither you nor baby brother should feel guilty about that.
Melinda: No.
“I’m going to go get some of the good hot chocolate, and then we are going to go into my office and you’re going to explain what the fuck is going on,” Tony said as he looked to his phone again. Peter just texted him back to let him know that they were five minutes out. Maybe they should just have a large group debrief.
From: Pepper_pot
Tony: That is true.
“As well as the text messages to Dr. Suarez during lunch.” Steve added. Of course, he saw that.
HSBF: You really are that brilliant.
Red phone: So I couldn’t get out of the State Department meetings and now Pepper is mad at me because I told Ross to fuck off.
Girl Friday: Nobody expected Alastair to crash the wedding after he was paid off to keep quiet. That was not my fault. Can you make another one for Flash? Also, make sure that the documents are compatible with his screen reading software.
Nomad: I’m mostly sticking to the movies.
“You didn’t try to leave, did you? We've only been working on this for a couple of hours, and we already have a working theory. I bet super genius Princes could've got you back home in a week tops." Although Deke is personally sure, he's going to be stuck here.
Agent Laura: You bought the couple someplace really nice in Europe, although I don’t know where for security reasons. It was a wedding present. We might need a few potential rehab houses or even places for the resurrected Avengers and family to live. I’ll discuss it with Friday. I’ll start things, and then I’ll try to find someone else to turn everything over to you. I think I might have a lead.
The Mechanic: She’s the best. I hope the President wants to meet with me to apologize for not listening to me when I told him that the superpower person database could be used for bad purposes like terrorist driven genocide. Tuesday could have been a bloodbath.
Me: Better than your billion dollars suits. You written Laura? I’m sure she’s not going to completely abandon you because her husband’s back. You are friends.
Happy Bear: I’m sure you probably won’t even read this message until tomorrow unless Friday flags it for you but I want to apologize for how I acted. I’m sorry.
Anthony: Yes because their attackers were pushed across the street by what one witness referred to as “earthquake powers” before they could do any real damage. Now they are in Shield protective custody.
So, who is GR?
“That have sex and I’m not that opposed to the concept of marriage. Someday eventually. But not like anytime soon.”
“So annoying. I get why you don’t want to be with the others. It can be overwhelming.” Sitting in a room with a woman who looks exactly like his dead wife but who isn’t her is more than just being overwhelming, but he’s not sure how to explain that to Natasha. He doesn’t even know where to begin. So, he just glares at her.
HSBF: At least you’re self-aware.
HSBF: That’s not the question.
HSBF: And how many people know that Stefan is me? Also, what is Pepperony?
Nomad: Why was it easier to have Stefan Carter married to someone who actually existed.
P Parker: It wasn’t like that. The room was too hot, and we were just sleeping. Flash broke up with his boyfriend yesterday because he’s a prick. The Princess is here as well as Fitzsimmons and FitzHunter. Along with a bunch of other agents and Wakanda security force members. I promise we are adequately supervised.
Me: I am trying. And I know you do have the bad guys in custody. That was not a weapon that you would want on the street.
Also, this contains “late arrival” spoilers for the next story in the series Text Messages from the Edge of High School. You may want to read the first two chapters, before reading these post-credit scenes. You can read this next part first, but it's going to change how you read parts of the following story. This is the reason these two final post-credit scenes were posted separately. Of course, if you’re planning to skip that story and go right to my Infinity War/Endgame adaptation, go ahead and read on. That possibility is the reason why I decided to post these two post-credit scenes to this story like initially planned and not move it to the other one.
The new consultant: Wakanda Tech holo-pad. On the way here, the Princess asked me to start looking at the files that were transmitted from 2023. So, we could figure out how not to make the same mistakes.
From: The Mechanic
Captain tight pants: Do you want to fix things?
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Also, thank you for observing the no Spider-Man spoilers in the comments rule. You are all absolutely lovely. As more time passes, I will point out the differences in this universe from Spider-Man: Homecoming. The most obvious being Kevin/Laura/Yo-Yo took over Happy’s role in Tony’s life as well as his other work functions because Happy took Pepper’s side during the breakup implosion in this universe and he is only now back in New York. We will explore how that changes things as we progress as well as why this universe is different.
Chief Mechanic: I just didn’t want your husband to second-guess his choice not to go back to the other timeline or at least his decision not to find a way to get back to that timeline.
“Robin was May’s daughter first. Pauly made her promise with her last breath that she would take care of Robin.”
TMNS: Maybe I was afraid of how you were going to react. I either get fear or hero-worship. Tony compares coming out as a person with superpowers to coming out gay or bi. Tony said he announced to the world he was Ironman because he wanted to come out the second time on his own terms.
Tony Potts: Good to know. Although how did I end up the foster parent of Peter’s biggest high school antagonist?
Purple Princess: At a minimum, you will stay over tonight, maybe longer. Dad's going to have to talk to our principal.
Me: By not letting me know how dangerous things were? Don’t you think I should have been told that they were not 100% sure that my parents were killed in a car accident?
Me: I’m giggling.
Tony: You too because well I know you don’t want to touch SI with a 10 foot pole and you’re better off being in charge of the foundations.
“I have a headache from reading these reports. I know stuff is missing. We only have a readout from someone named Nebula regarding what happened to Peter Prime.” Afia told the group.
MayMQ: That’s good.
“Good mozzarella must have some salt and the right fat content.” Tony snarked.
Love: I think that’s adding to the speculation. Why would his assistant be with Pepper if he wasn’t on his deathbed?
Tony: No one could be Howard’s version of Captain America. I mean you came close sweetheart but no one is that perfect. Everybody has a dark side, even you.
Girl Friday:  You better. Just stay safe. I’m worried about you.
Agent M: Also, my father made that blanket himself.
Me: Hypocritical Asshole. The only action I’m getting is my hand right now but I’m not going to tell you that. (message not sent)
Linda Bear: He had Friday design Captain Oblivious an art studio in the new penthouse. It looks really nice. He’s working on something, especially because the asshole just got me fired a couple of days ago.
P Parker: I know you worry.
MJ: I will take that as a compliment.
Me: Yo-yo is only putting up with me because she has feelings for Agent Mack. However, the good Agent will not be involved with her romantically if she is an exclusive Shield asset because of fraternization regulations.
Me: Only two weeks? The phone you gave me has a battery that lasts a year.
Purple Princess: image two uploaded
Tony: No.
Monkey lover 2: After you get the monoliths away from each other.
Me: She’s glad that they’re no longer talking about her breakup. She really wishes that the Watchdogs’ attempted assassination of you was not the reason for it. She also really wants you to call her. Although, she understands why you haven’t because you’re probably busy with your boyfriend.
Counselor Laura: We uncovered 15 so far against your father only. There may have been more, but some of the records were destroyed. That's just Hydra. There were a few assassination attempts from Roxxon and even one from Obadiah on his own in 1989.
"By staying in the system?"
Counselor Laura: It will give us a place to start. Pizza will be there.
Me: I'm well aware of that.
“That makes sense. Tony is like that. Let’s just go find him and get it over with. I want to know what ever he’s afraid to tell me.”
Person that cares about my boss: So Agent May did Sharon’s duties before Sharon moved in?
Counselor Laura: Who is Build-a-Bear?
Blue phone: Arnie Roth. He was a perceived ladies’ man like Bucky and he also save me from a lot of bullies growing up.
Tony: Research that is technically against the Accords?
Last time I cried by myself, outside of this writing process, was on the way back to the safe house after you left the hotel room. You leaving was hard, even though I know being together was only temporary. Still hurt watching you leave. Last time I cried in front of someone else was when you almost died. I was a mess. There’s a reason why I was tranquilized.
“Good. Were you able to help them at all?” Steve asked as he grabbed a pair of boxers out of his duffel bag. He found about sleeping nude, but if the hotel got raided by various government officials or super villains while sleeping, he would like to be at least wearing something when they showed up. Of course he was wondering why he was putting shorts on now, because there was a good chance that Tony would take them off as soon as he crawled into bed for round four.
Nomad: Not surprised.
Nomad: What is an LMD?
Counselor Laura: Shit. So much was lost.
“Or nephew. He could be Fitz’s grandkid.” Leo remarked. “Did you and Capt. Patriotism elope in the last 24 hours?” Hunter’s comment caused Tony to realize he referred to Steve as his husband. He’s not going to call attention to that slip.
Monkey lover 2: Why are you always this infuriating?
The new consultant: You know you're better off without them. If it makes you feel better, apparently, I'm also part of the 50% along with my mom and cousin. Although my dad apparently went on to remarry and have another kid.
Anyway I’ll try to get to LA to visit as soon as I can or at least arrange things so I’ll be in New York next time you’re in New York.
Nomad: Which apparently is what you keep doing to various Shield tactical teams.
“That is good to know. I don’t know how we managed to piss off Laura so quickly, but I think I’m going to have to get her a shoe basket. Normally wine would be next, but that would be an inappropriate present for Laura.”
“Okay, I need more details,” Tony said as he put the car into full Friday mode.
Tony: Yes. And the fact that safer ground really worries me.
Steve: OK, how do you know all this? That name is really familiar.
Ana Junior: I assume that was not a successful endeavor?
Anthony: Yo-Yo just texted. Monkey lover is a miracle worker and May is out of the woods. Although, despite the potential life-threatening situation, Coulson still hasn’t confessed his feelings for May yet or vice versa. Despite making some very questionable decisions to get her treatment.
Me: To fall asleep without seeing my parents last moment or the faces of everybody I’ve killed.
Football Hunter: And then I came to my senses and realized I don’t want to spend the rest of eternity with somebody who squeezes the tooth paste in the middle and expects better of you then she does herself?
Steve: I don’t want him to think that I only talk to him when I need something from him.
A final note, I wrote this chapter months ago, back in January. However, there is a section of this chapter that is very “harsher in hindsight” after Endgame. I chose not to change it.
Me: What the hell would he know about form policy?
Me: Fuck!
Purple Princess: Yes. We’re not trying to keep you out of the loop. It’s just we’re trying to respect your mom’s wishes. I would like her to eventually lift these bans, and if we communicate behind her back, she never will.
Cuddle fiancé: I will always protect you.
To be continued
"Our bedroom?" Steve asked.
I also wanted to contrast the Peter and Flash in this timeline compared to where they are in Far From Home. We’ve come a long way from that.
Me: I hope I’ll be done with this mess by then. This case is been weird by even Shield standards.
Me: L is running interference, but I wish you were here to help keep those two from doing more stupid thing
Because the Sparrow sees harsh visions of the past and future, she is nonverbal and her visions only come out in her drawings. Her first vision was that of her father’s death after it happened.
Tony: Then a lot of us are fucked. His number two, General Hale, is a real piece of work.
Tony: Also, apparently the brain trust is planning to use arc reactor technology to build up the power infrastructure of Puerto Rico before something catastrophic happens because apparently, you can't stop a hurricane. Even one that causes 2% of the population to get superpowers.
Me: Exactly.
From: James_R
FRIDAY: Plausible deniability is best in these situations. Once Sir is out of the White House, I will have him contact you.
Me: Because you are one. Yes I know. I’m a Spy. We notice things.
“We are going to do this together. I think this morning went well.”
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (for the U.S.): 1-800-273-8255 and http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/#
Blue phone: I realize that the guy I left behind wasn’t who you grew up with. You never met my Howard and I never met yours. But, if you need to talk about it, I’m willing to listen.
Therapist Laura: Also I prefer the term Counselor because I don’t have a PhD yet. I’m working on it and thanks to my new schedule, I’ll probably get there sooner rather than later.
“You are no fun.” Tony was actually pouting at this point.
Me: And you have one too, that you should be using. Why are you so stubborn?
Continuity note: I did see Ant-man and the Wasp last weekend. I really liked it. The movie takes place after our continuity divide (about a year and a half from our current point in the story). So it’s possible some changes made in this continuity could affect that movie, especially the post-credit scene. But that’s something that would most likely happen in the infinity war/Avengers 4 fix it sequel for this story, if I do one (I’m 80% certain I am going to be writing a follow-up story). However, I did a tiny call forward to that movie in this chapter. See if you can spot it.
Me: Is Spidey grounded for the next year?
“Key on the former. And SI had a strict no biological weapons policy which was started by Howard after he accidentally created something called ‘midnight oil’ and it went catastrophically badly. Much to Obadiah’s annoyance, I kept that policy. I never worked on anything like what Yo-Yo was describing.”
Red phone: Vision isn’t there to remind me of the Ultron fuck up or for me to see him pine over Wanda.
Captain Oblivious was in trouble now.
Nomad: And the world moved on. Everyone has said that your uncle was a good man, even Anthony.
Me: I always knew my AIs would be my only children, but I'm getting hugs this way. And parent-teacher conferences because Afia wants to go to regular school.
Tony: Who is Dr. Suarez?
Me: Which means getting back on her good side and unlike others, shoe baskets don’t work on her anymore.
Tony: You're mad at me.
I stand by my decision that you’re not ready for the suit right now. Maybe you will be eventually. Laura will make that call because my judgment is absolute shit. But right now, it stays locked up, especially with me being out of the country for the next week. If something happens while I’m gone, call Laura or Rhodey. Or call Sharon. You still have your phone, use it.
“Sometimes the universe is against you,” May replied darkly.
HSBF: It’s a date then.
Football Hunter: Was that a deal with the actual devil or some inhuman that calls himself the devil? Or are you not sure because you couldn’t decipher the scribbles of the preschooler that draws the future?
Me: You are, but you’re just going to do it anyway. And bubble wrap is not an option.
The title comes from the Mike Shinoda song “Ghosts” which is almost a theme song for most of this series.
Melinda: Again
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. You're all absolutely fabulous.
HSBF: And your response?
“Okay, I can understand in those circumstances, although why did Ana… Friday let you into my phone? I think only the head of Shield can get in. Although maybe the head of the Avengers could too. I’m not sure how Fitz set the permissions.” Laura explained.
HSBF: You do that. Love you.
“I think it would’ve been less embarrassing. I should’ve never let May talk me into those pictures.” At least he now knows it was Steve. Also, May is a total badass. And he adores her. Tony should be jealous, but he’s not. He deeply respects the woman.
Cuddle Bunny: So I heard congratulations are in order and Colonel Rhodes is the new Director of Shield.
HSBF: What? Seriously?
TMNS: Why did everybody know about the breakup before me? Also, no drinking. Although apparently vast quantities of ice cream were involved.
Me: I wish that was the case. However, about 15 minutes after I stopped texting you, Agent Scary showed up at my Arlington house at like 2 AM and didn’t leave until 7 AM. Needless to say my original morning meeting has been rescheduled which is good because I need at least three more hours of sleep before I can deal with Agent Scary again.
Me: I’m still glad the big guy caught you.
Counselor Laura: Actually, you should write those down now, and then Friday can push them through when the window opens.
Counselor Laura: I think Leo convinced Friday that for the good of mankind, you and Steve needed to be on speaking terms. Although she may have eventually went full Emma.
Monkey lover 2: Simmons did. He’s safe now and the senator is going down.
Nomad: I’m not surprised. She was kind of a mess back then because he was gone.
Anthony: A 1 AM wedding would have better especially with the jet lag and your constant calling to DC to check up on May.
“According to Twitter, the general died in a car accident last night. So yes, he could,” MJ added.
Captain Tight Pants: Laura really has been good for you.
BITC: You will keep me updated on what’s happening now that I’m not with my mom?
Me: You want to work with me regarding your issues?
Red phone: Unfortunately, Kevin is also 27 and married to Pepper’s assistant, Sarah. New rule, I can't date anyone born after January 1986. I’m trying to avoid the events that led to any Tony Stark sex tape existing in the first place.
HSBF: Which means you have to leave.
Friday: I no longer have access to that information because it was transferred to Ana Jr. I purposely chose not to make a backup copy.
Purple Princess: That’s because you are Ms. Marvel’s beta, and you make sure she doesn’t post things she shouldn’t.
Blue phone: The news reports did not mention that the special explosive use was invented by your father.
Me: I was trying to keep that from happening. I asked Yo-yo not to post anything like that.
Hunter: Hey, the boss is coming to visit the kids and is bringing the future boyfriend with him. So I have the night free. I'm on my way, and I'm bringing food. What do you want me to get?
The new consultant: She does now. Her body can create energy from food just like we do. She got an upgrade last summer.
Me: I’m trying to be as honest as I can under the circumstances. However, I have to go because my boyfriend just stepped out of the shower.
Anthony: Which is why I get the good stuff from Mexico.
Nomad: I’m fine. I know Friday is concerned, but I don’t need help. Did you really let Tony take your daughter to meet the president?
“I know you’re not from this reality. I could send you back to your original timeline. It still exists. Your actions just created a new timeline.” Leo thought of waking up this morning to Hunter’s kisses and knew the answer already.
(See the end of the chapter for
Xxxxx
Also, there are media reports that you proposed while in Mumbai and I would love to know how much of a rumor that was. Just so I can figure out if the paparazzi are going to start following me again. And yes, the person who fucked my boyfriend behind my back, also, sold the story to the press or rather her publicist did.
“So you rather just leave Fitz to die?” Simmons asked bitterly almost pleading with Leo.
Me: Sex is not training unless you’re doing it right. Although with you, maybe it could be. Oh, the positions I would try out with you. Have you ever read the Kama Sutra?
The New Consultant: Not exactly. It’s complicated. I’m checking with Ana to see how much I can tell you.
“Two days ago, Dr. Strange asked me if I wanted to go back, and I said no. I wanted to stay here with you. I love you.” The words were punctuated with yet another kiss.
“Even then. I now know that it’s better to have loved and lost. I don’t regret my time with my Simmons.” Leo tells her with a sad smile. “Even though I’m never going to see her again, I am grateful for what time we did have together. If I can’t change things, don’t you want to have as much time with Phil as you possibly can before the end?”
Blue phone: How did you first find out that Coulson was among the living?
Kitty brother: What are you working on? You’re not actually trying to perfect time travel?
Me: That's pretty consistent with before. The only differences now he has a Taser in his hand.
Tony: So by Thanksgiving I will sit down with Pepper Pot and discuss my options for taking a break from SI to serve my country and getting me the hell away from the board because my heart and my sobriety demand it.
Hunter: Too late. Leo has been second-guessing his choices since he got here. What do you think led to his extended stay in mental health rehab? Or the fact that he had to take the Stark industries job because it would be less stressful.
“Engagement ring?” That’s when Hunter realize he said way too much. Okay, the smack on his shoulder from Leo tells him that he said too much.
Nomad: I still feel like he’s avoiding me.
Purple Arrow: Steve is working as a counselor?
Tony: It's more like we're swapping places. I am bringing Steve with me. We could take the kids to Queens. that way, you can have a night to yourself. I feel like you need half a glass of wine and some of the good chocolate.
Cuddle fiancé: Is Coulson dead in that timeline?
Tony: I am too. Laura told me that Steve 2.0 saw through the light bulb story because of something in your own childhood. Laura wouldn't tell me what that was. Although I'm supposed to ask about family in Nevada.
Anthony: Now I just have to find a real one.
HSBF: And you’re going to be working on it?
At that point, Tony decided it was best to put his phone away and focus on everything that was the church of the Divine Genius Princess. The lab was beautiful, and even though this wasn’t his first time there, Tony was still inspired by it. He wants something just like it in the new house he is designing for him and Steve in Alexandria. Fitzsimmons is getting the Arlington house as their wedding present. But being the head of not Shield means having a permanent residence somewhere in the DMV, and therefore he's working on something new.
I’m glad you’re resting now. Although I am concerned about that all night science but apparently, it was for a good cause. I heard from Lily bear that she got to text her mom. Which was good because I was very worried about her. I would love a scientific explanation for all of that, but I am sure it’s going to have to wait until I get there.
Me: Yes. I don’t have a scratch on me.
Tony: You’ll be happy to know that your CCO is healthy and happy in the other timeline.
Tony: Yes. The Director is still on the fence about taking advantage of certain technologies to completely heal himself. He kind of likes being an advocate for the disabled community. So he’s taking a moment to consider all the consequences.
Me: I feel like controlling the weather thing might be more myth than truth. Why does a hurricane cause 2% of the population of Puerto Rico to get superpowers?
“Friday is currently on a mission with Dr. Leopold. However, yes both Fitz and Simmons are naturalized U.S. citizens. Although they both maintain dual citizenship, now that their identities have been reestablished. Dr. Leopold J. Fitz also has Wakanda citizenship granted personally by Princess Shuri. Dr. Simmons is head of the tech/science division, and will retain that position, after the restructuring, but for the greater ATCU instead of just the Shield division.”
Thank you for paying for the movers and the hotel offer. I’m going to have to decline the latter, because I don’t want to rip [Redacted] from home any sooner than I have to. This is going to be such a big transition for him.
This chapter is taking place near simultaneously to the last one. Tony can’t be the only one to get a shovel talk.
He gets why your romantic relationship fell apart. I’m so sorry he said my name in bed. I was never actively trying to break your relationship apart. Also I was completely unaware of the Tony Stark gay sex tape, so I didn’t even think I had a chance. Even if I did, I wasn’t going to take your boyfriend.
Football Hunter: Being the incoming new CCO of Stark Industries means your picture is everywhere and even with the nano mass projection of more facial hair and different eye color, your mum still knew it was you.
Agent 13: I'll have Melinda give you an update later if Stark is not up soon.
“Is it really ethical to bring everybody back without any planning?” Tony asked.
Tony: After the Accords are renegotiated into something you can sign, if you actually do sign on the dotted line, Ellis will pardon you and give the other Secret Avengers a few months probation.
From: Riley_Parker
Me: No because my James has authorized that we develop another LMD prototype with a different operating system. Preferably one that doesn’t look like anybody alive or dead. So, science will go on.
"You two really can’t go 24 hours without talking to one another. You’ll see him in a few hours. You’re planning to be his date tonight at the SI dinner." From her tone, Steve can tell that she’s not happy.
To be continued
“So Mack is inhabited by the spirit of vengeance or whatever he really is?” Hunter asked getting a glare from Simmons.
Red phone: Let me guess, you never googled ‘Tony Stark gay sex tape’?
Blue phone: You’re not going to hand me over to the DOD?
Me: That does not make it right.
Venom: Yes, although I was finally telling people about my fucked-up family, so maybe it wasn’t the right time to add one more thing. You made a cute pillow.
“Actually, it was supposed to be Daisy, but she ended up staying in New York because Loki was going to show up earlier today. How did that go?” Steve asked.
Agent M: Red Malibu is stable. Tell Liberty we are taking care of him. He doesn’t need to come here.
D: That’s why I sent you the footage instead of just telling you. Yes. The other agents couldn’t even pick up the pieces, but Joey could put them back together again. The hammer didn’t want to come back together, but Joey told them about Thanos. They want to help.
“My body is your canvas,” Tony said just before he pulled Steve into another kiss.
Girl Friday: This is true. Although, I feel like the First-aid kit may not actually be necessary unless Flash faints again.
“Aren’t you happy you had a second chance?”
Me: There were other reasons why I didn’t go, such as the fact Jackie doesn't like me because of something really dumb that I did in the early 90s.
“Thank you.”
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. You have all been absolutely wonderful. Your encouragement keeps me writing.
“Then team Coulson will deal with it because that is not in my wheelhouse, unfortunately. So, I’m still all yours. Although as much as I want to play with you again, I think I might need sleep first or at least a snack.”
Monkey lover 2: What about the Lighthouse?
Anthony: However, he does think I should take an agent with me.
Red phone: I found myself in the nice warm bed, but I don't know how I got there.
Tony: Along with Friday. So, you finally broke down and messaged me because you need me?
Blue phone: Yes. You know I make questionable decisions when people I care about die. You’re on the list now.
“Something happened to Phil in your timeline?” May asked cautiously.
“Now, I'm intrigued, cuddle leopard.”
Me: That’s actually a good cover story.
Time sent: 9/21/2016 21:01:41
Ana Junior: Yes.
Xxxxx
This conversation takes place just a few hours after the last one. Also, at least once during this, there is a gap of about 15 minutes between messages. See if you can guess where the gap is.
“You heard everything?” She asked, fearful.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. You’re all absolutely fabulous. Thank you so much for all your encouraging words. Also, remember no spoilers for WandaVision in the comments for 30 days. If you want to discuss the show with me, you can find me on Twitter or send me a PM on FF dot net. I have thoughts, but I’m going to be respectful right now.
Chief mechanic: Joey actually could put the hammer back together? He is very powerful.
D: How did that happen?
The new consultant: Hey, we just got here. We brought food. Just me and the Princess. Even Her Highness couldn't talk Ned's mom into letting him come back here.
So upstate New York did not happen in this universe because Tony was in California doing damage control and this Tony is on enough medication to make rational decisions.
Cuddle Bunny: Is Sharon mad at me? Maybe to the point of telling her bosses who your boyfriend really is?
Me: My boss already got him a copy. It’s okay. Ross’ powers been stripped and he will be in congressional hearings from now till the end of the administration. The Rising Tide is also going after Ross.
Me: Which is the only reason why I did not confront her about the Melinda Garner thing. (Message not sent.)
Pepper pot: If anybody can figure out how to solve two problems simultaneously, it’s you.
“Probably still in the hallway because I doubt anybody took the luggage to the room.”
"And you, Natasha, Wanda, Yo-Yo, Daisy, Laura and the family, Kamala, Miles, as well as Peter along with a lot of others that I haven't even met yet. Somebody has to play the game and as much as Steve hates doing stuff like that, it's necessary for the greater good."
Me: Probably more than one. Mission Control and the princess genius have bonded. They’re probably best friends now, so he’s probably helping her read these things.
Tony: So bad. Maybe it would be better if I got more than three hours of sleep in the last two days due to board members who don't understand time zones and remote phone interviews. But that’s life. My life anyway. I’m on my third espresso.
Steve: This is true.
Me: Depressing. So I'm a little pissed off about how much of my money was secretly funneled to xenophobic assholes and certain politicians that personally blamed me for their mother’s death.
Tony: Greetings from the district of insanity. Where the only thing that I’m looking forward to is getting a honey butter chicken sandwich from my favorite food truck.
“10 months. We are immensely proud.” MJ said as she squeezed Flash’s hand again. Peter is just going to ignore the fact that his cheeks are getting red again with the additional contact. You think the spider bite would give him the power to keep that from happening.
HSBF: How long did it take you to learn that lesson?
Monkey lover 2: Not an inhuman.
HSBF: How pissed off is your PR person going to be that you introduced Melinda as your bodyguard?
Yes. Stefan and I talked. He knows about the ring and he is not opposed to spending the rest of his life with me, but I’m holding on to the ring for now. I think that’s best.
Me: Well, you already knew that. And what is to come is actually worse.
Me: So just those two?
Red spider: Jeffrey wants us to pretend that we’re not in the middle of a crisis. It’s part of the Avenger brand rehabilitation.
“But maybe we wouldn’t be here, otherwise.” Tony said kissing Steve again. He’s trying to keep these kisses chaste, but that is difficult. Even the muscles in Steve’s tongue got better. “I’m worried about other things to."
HSBF: No more fake dirty messages. I mean it Tony.
Me: That’s not an option either at the moment.
Agent Laura: We’re going to work on the timeline tomorrow and have it ready for the princess 2018. The general was really helpful, and she put me in contact with Rocket and Nebula. They’re on their way to help. They bonded with Deke when looking for Fitz. They also want to get their friends back.
Purple Princess: Although FYI, dad’s Deputy Director did not die in a car accident. She did have her daughter chained up, though, and Suarez is currently dealing with that mess. Also, Coulson’s back but dealing with stuff in DC.
The Mechanic: Point. But I would like some intel before I call.
Me: Something smothered in a peanut sauce involving pita bread, I think.
“I want to know more about this story, but at the same time, I’m horrified for your well-being,” Tony remarked.
Me: I wanted to ask you how round two of assistant interviews went on Friday; however, considering the latest news regarding Secretary Ross, I’d rather start there. Was that Bruce’s ex-girlfriend on Meet the Press? I thought her name was Betty. She was really angry.
“Despite the warning, if me reading the Darkhold was the only way to get you back, I would’ve done it with no reservations. Even knowing that it can completely corrupt a person, I would’ve done it.” Fitz responded by kissing her again.
TMNS: Are you mad at me for not telling you that I’m Spidey? I really should’ve told you after the kiss.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. You have all been wonderful.
Tony: I don’t want to lose what I have now if you and Ms. May-Rogers somehow magically turn back the clock five years. Morgan is my everything.
Anthony: I am too. I just wish it didn’t take me practically dying for things to get better.
Siberia was one long string of bad judgment calls. The first being that Steve thought it was better to not let me know that my parents’ death was actually a Hydra orchestrated hit. When I found out that the Winter Soldier was the weapon of choice, I flipped. I mean full homicidal, ‘I'm going to fucking kill him’ rage. And I would have if Steve wasn't there.
Time sent: 9/1/2016 12:35:11
Tony: Total asshole. Yep, good thing they went with Moms.
To be continued
Blue phone: I’m sure Ross completely ignores her.
Counselor Laura: I don't believe you. If you're anything like my Friday, you're good at meddling in interpersonal relationships. It hasn't got better since she became an LMD. I'm sure she's currently conspiring to get Flash, MJ, and Peter in a poly relationship.
If anybody wants to try drawing the Barton children’s interpretations of Steve’s new costume, I will love you forever.
ME: You know what I don’t know if I should explain in case you don’t know.
Tony: Nick Fury Junior knows everything. There’s not much you can possibly keep from her. She doesn’t share everything with the husband because he’s an idiot. Steve is a cute, adorable, fluffy idiot but still an idiot.
Me: I make no promises, but the lawyers will be on standby, so no rescue necessary.
“But you had hallucinations after the ocean and eventually got better,” she said, trying to reassure him.
Anthony love: I haven’t had a chance to go over the files yet. My child is forcing me to get at least a few hours of sleep before I even began. Okay, she dragged me out of the lab.
“That would be best.”
“I think so. Your part of my life. I’m trying to figure out how to word that paragraph.” Steve said as he laid his head on Tony’s shoulder, fully aware that he should tell Bucky now.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re all lovely.
Xxxxx
Stephen C: What did it do to the others?
Counselor Laura: We just parked, and I’m still amazed that there is parking in Manhattan.
Cuddle Bunny. I do think we need to see each other eventually.
Purple Princess: I’m fine. It’s not like I lost consciousness again.
Tony: Yes, but at least she hasn't blown anything up yet. I may have taken out the Dean's car at MIT when I was her age. And a lab, more than once.
“How did you find me?” Clint asked.
Time sent: 8/31/2016 22:01:41
“You don’t have Happy holding on to this ring like the last one?”
Me: You’re right. Clint and Laura are trying to make sure I don’t totally screw up Afia or the other kids.
Red spider: So am I. Which is why I am looking through the records brought over from the other timeline.
Cuddle Bunny: You said you are doing training exercises. Did you meet your prospective new Avengers?
CoulsonPJ: And obviously a bad one. He completely ignored May's plan for getting the tech out of the tower undetected.
But it’s fine. Thanks to the Melinda May school of how to be a bad ass, Tony can hold his own against barely trained bigoted assholes who hide behind their guns. Especially when he knows how to use those guns against them. As many guns as he’s designed, really, they should know that he would know the best way to disarm someone and use the gun against his attacker. That was two more on the ground and at least he had a weapon now.
“Laura has always been good with kids and wayward superheroes. It’s good she found a job combining the skills even if it’s in another timeline.” Clint looked down to see Natasha standing in front of him or rather the vent that he was hiding in.
Iron Dad: Probably. I will have to add an exempt list.
"I don’t think I would hold it against you with a kiss like that." He whispered as coherent thought started to occur again.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely lovely.
Red phone: It’s that stupid fondue story. And you should know that I have used fondue as a double entendre before, so that’s no sign of you being inexperienced.
Xxxxx
The Big Boss: He wants to come back to LA once the toy chest has made its way to the new Avenger house.
HSBF: Why did she and her various family members try to kill you?
Me: Very serious. They are spending Thanksgiving in Malibu together right now. Although, not engagement ring serious just yet.
Nomad: Still embarrassing.
“That can be worse.”
Me: Or when villains attack. Or when aliens will fall from the sky because you know they’re going to fall from the sky at any moment.
Blue phone: I am really observant with the little things. Do you actually think they would try to arrest Laura?
"At this point, I want to know what my other self did to have Jane force him to do these questions. Friday, sweetie pie, do you have an answer?” Tony asked the AI.
Me: I thought you were with the money people now?
Tony: This is going to be another Pepper conversation. Actually, I better call her in case something gets leaked. You’re like the only thing I’m able to keep a secret and that’s mostly because everybody thanks Captain America is straight.
FRIDAY: Technically, she is part of the SHIELD division, but she is Mr. Stark’s handler.
Director Snookums: Tony!
“You don’t know that. I can’t stand here and do nothing. I’m going to check on May in medical and give her the antidote. I’m sure she’s going to want to be here for the rescue. I still can’t believe you iced her.” Hunter could because he knows way too much about the Doctor. Leo will do what he needs to do to save the world regardless of the questionable morality of it.
BITC: I still can’t believe you’re friends with Flash. He’s an asshole.
Anthony: I am being respectful. I’m not wearing red even though it’s my signature color, my head is covered, and I’m not wearing shoes. Davis was really not happy about losing the shoes.
Tony: Yes. I did go to smart kid school like Benjamin. Private smart kid school where almost everybody was on scholarship, but still smart kid school so the rumor mill must be vicious as hell and it’s probably worse now because there’s Facebook.
Morgan’s dad: That might be another reason why he is now in an alternate timeline 2018 instead of our 2018.
Me: Other side of the family, we think. But could be recessive. Nothing showed up in the DNA test.
As for if I will incorporate elements from season 4 of AOS, the answer is this story is taking place in the gap between seasons 3 and 4. The plan is for it to end right about when season four is beginning, but there could still be a Robbie cameo. I’m not ruling it out yet.
Anthony: Sorry, my mistake. Seriously, Friday, you are not allowed to hang out with AIDA anymore. Keep this up and Dr. Fitz will also be on the list.
Blue phone: Despite our problems I still trust you more than someone I don't know.
Pepper pot: Now, was that so hard to acknowledge?
HSBF: That is not as bad as some of the other questions. I really wish I could go back to college and actually finish.
Me: Your mom got out of an abusive situation at a time when there were no safety nets. The least I can do is help others have a net.
“If Pierce can get confirmed, anybody can get confirmed. Although, does the director have any experience in the realm of diplomacy? Beyond getting you out of jail in various countries.”
"I agree with you there. At least that way I could track him. I know I can’t put him in bubble wrap, but I’m thinking of making him another suit. Something closer to my suit. Anything to cut down on the cuts and bruises.”
Anthony: Agent Carter Junior is now standing outside my door. I’ll talk to you when I get back.
“Partially. But it really didn’t change things. When I accidentally posted my private parts to Instagram, everyone said how un-Captain America that was.”
Cuddle fiancé: Maybe there’s some new miracle drug in that timeline?
The Boy in the Chair: You should probably do that. I miss you.
“Why?”
Tony: I think the starlet leaked it to the press for attention because me and Pepper Pop were not together for over a year and nobody knew.
HSBF: That’s good.
Anthony: I’m not sure. I was working on a toaster for the first few sessions. I’m really open when I’m in the zone.
That’s when she types out a text for Tony to delete their conversation. She doesn’t want them to know she’s talking to Tony because the team might put a stop to that, and she feels like he might tell her the truth of how they lost to Thanos eventually.
Nomad: Because I miss you.
HSBF: Maybe we shouldn’t do this. You could come up with some other excuse for Jane. She has to be somewhat reasonable.
Red phone: I was talking about Arnie a.k.a. the one that got away.
I just went to my first comic con last weekend (dressed as the Ross staff member that Tony keeps driving crazy). Unfortunately, not Philadelphia, but DC’s Awesome Con. I did get an autograph from Elizabeth Henstridge a.k.a. Simmons from Agents of SHIELD and heard Karl Urban sing the praises of the Thor 3 script in person (I am not even going to try to dictate the full name of that movie). Apparently there are some interesting casting surprises yet to be announced, but he couldn’t say anything more. All in all it was a fun weekend, even if it put me a little behind in the writing rotation.
Hunter: Shit. What about me? I know he survived because I read about what happened to Bobbi.
Monkey lover 2: You are extremely infuriating.
Ana Junior: That is a way to look at it. Leopold Fitzimmons and James Leopold see each other as brothers rather than nearly alternate dimension counterparts.
I know that you know that Tony and I are trying to rebuild our relationship after what happened in May. We both made a lot of mistakes. I should’ve told him about his parents. I should’ve told him why I did not trust the Secretary. I should have listened to his argument instead of dismissing it and assuming that I was right. I don’t think I was right anymore, but I don’t think he was either. Maybe there wasn’t a right answer.
May: I think it would be an understatement to refer to Thor as being extremely depressed right now. He blames himself for what happened. He lost the rest of his family in a matter of days. He also went for the heart instead of the head.
Me: Although I’m not sure if I’m leaving condoms or not. It really depends on if I’m watching.
Virginia: I will ask Jennifer from legal if she has any recommendations. Don’t worry, I’ll pay for it.
This chapter takes place about four days after the last one.
Sexy boyfriend: So we’re about to get to the most important part of the ceremony, the seven steps.
Captain Tight Pants: If you knew that it wasn’t an accident, you probably would have done something stupid that would have resulted in you getting killed.
Blue phone: He's pining over her?
“Probably during breakfast, actually. I’ll be your sounding board,” Tony offered.
Tony: I know. Leo’s working on it too, or consulting on it rather. I still don’t know how that happened but he refuses to talk about it.
CoulsonPJ: We were on the run from Talbot.
“Actually, Tony did not create Ultron. He was a project created by Shield and the U.S. government. He’s just taking the fall,” the android explained. “He did create Vision, who is a hero.”
MayMQ: What about after you were the one giving orders? You were the director for two years. At any time you could’ve told him or Audrey for that matter.
HSBF: I don’t know if I should be flattered or concerned.
Girl Friday: Do you need me to lie to you or tell you the truth?
TMNS: I know you’re with Steve Rogers.
(See the end of the chapter for
BITC: That would only be possible if you’re gay or asexual. Since you dated three cheerleaders during sophomore year, I find either possibility hard to believe.
Me: Don’t worry Karen, Friday will be back soon. Oh look, there’s grainy twitter photos of Agent America, Slingshot, and some new, very young-looking person in a dark purple tactical suit. Along with a guy in a motorcycle jacket. A very nice motorcycle jacket. Oh wait, I see Quake with them.
Me: There may have been crying and hugging, but no property damage.
Thank you to everybody who read and reviewed the last section. You're all wonderful. Before I really get busy, I have an artwork chapter for you. Is anybody curious to see what Lily Bear was working on before Tony had to rescue a certain spider?
I asked FRIDAY to deliver this note to you because we need to talk as much as you and Tony do, even if it can’t be face-to-face for the moment. I’m hoping circumstances will change that soon, but I might be working in various countries in Africa for a while.
Football Hunter: You didn’t run into her younger self at the doctor’s house? See this is why I did not want you to switch places with baby brother.
Agent 13: That may just be a convenient byproduct of someone else's assassination attempt. Chances are they don't know that you are with Tony. Only a handful of people know you're dating. Most of them have a S5 clearance. The Watchdogs despise your boyfriend for reasons outside of you.
“Is that because Stefan is not really you? Or maybe it’s because Stefan doesn’t have the same expectations as you do as Captain America."
“But it’s not all bad. It’s a good start. Better than what I have. Although you misspelled Wakanda. Yes, I’m reading over your beautiful shoulder. That is a town somewhere in the Midwest.” Tony said grabbing the pen from Steve and correcting the typo.
Anthony: That explains why you asked if Laura was the one who showed me the video file. When my AI becomes concerned, you know things are problematic.
Me: So it was just good to hang out with my friends and the kids. OK Lily Bear really was just happy her parents did not argue the entire dinner.
No one did. But the front desk sent one right up because apparently this was a full-service hotel. They didn’t even blink when he asked for needles, bowls, and corks. Once the power was on and even more Watchdogs were turned over to the Mumbai authorities, he resolved to give the hotel the biggest tip ever. Besides, he owed them for Steve breaking the bed Sunday. Super strength plus sex Marathon equals broken bed. That, most hotels will overlook, but bullet holes are another story, so money will need to definitely change hands.
HSBF: I think taking the suit away right now is the right decision. He’s not ready for it.
Me: Because everything about the situation was complicated. There’s no quick answer to the superpower regulation question. Do I want the government to turn you into a weapon? No. Do I want the Watchdogs to have your home address? Hell no. Do I trust the Secretary Ross? Again, hell no. Do I think that we should be able to do whatever the hell we want without consequences or oversight? No.
“Leo, not that he would explain the name to me. Friday, Sweetie Pie, put the Compound on lockdown,” Tony instructed his AI. He wouldn’t put it past the Watchdogs to attack the family again.
Me: Again, Carters are not stupid. That was pretty obvious by the fact that she also brought me the things Aunt Peggy left you in her will. A lot of mementos from the other commandos which is better than the Howard diaries I received.
The Mechanic: Yes. We can’t have him asking too many questions, especially when Mommy Monkey Lover starts putting up pictures of her son and his wife and her other son and his husband. Actually, I think we need to move her to another country away from nosy people that only remember her having one kid.
Tony: Sugar cube?
Agent Laura: I’m not sure either is an option for her. If she tells the psychologist or addiction specialist that the trigger was her fiancé getting swallowed by a monolith that allows people to travel through time, what would happen? Granted, this is a world where half of the people disappeared, but some things are still too weird.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. This chapter takes place about two days after the last one.
Luke Cage season 2 occurs after the timeline divided and therefore some of the things Leo Fitz did to prevent the upcoming apocalypse did lightly affect some things on that show. So in this universe, a lot of what happened did happen the same way, but there were a few differences. Just remember if something contradicts go with my version.
“I don’t like it either. But hey at least it keeps Peter nice and safe and away from the vultures and Ross. The paparazzi vultures, not the guy who tried to steal my toys.”
Blue phone: Cannabis tea also works.
PS: You need to decide how you’re going to tell the board that you’re actually an Avenger and Widow with science skills. We're probably not going to be able to keep that a secret during active apocalypse mode.
HSBF: Obviously talking to Pepper is not working. Maybe you should write to her.
Me: So, after I stopped texting you, Spider Brat decided to use his tracker and newly 'liberated' suit to track down the weapons dealers to an abandoned gas station somewhere in Maryland.
“Maybe. Why are you visiting then?” The sergeant asked.
Anthony: Which I’m really sad about especially because I'm going to be spending Friday night on a fake date with my boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend so the media will not think I’m pining over my ex-girlfriend while I’m forced to spend quality time with my ex-girlfriend/boss and her trophy boyfriend. Did I mention I'm going to have to do this sober?
“You like not wearing shoes.” This got him a glare from Davis this time. Maybe it’s best if he returns to actually texting Tony. Less people noticed that.
This begins the return of the unsent messages. And unlike in the "Tony and Steve had their ship together" timeline, this Friday isn't in Emma mode. So, she's probably not going to employ loophole abuse to send them anyway. That was probably totally Leo’s fault.
Me: Are they still trying to get proof of you being mentally unfit?
HSBF: You don’t need it. Just start at the beginning.
“It’s weird how the best thing in your life can be connected to the worst thing.” He could hear what Tony was really saying. If they didn’t lose, he would never have had Morgan. That was a heavy thought.
“Fine, I will do breakfast or maybe lunch with the good Capt. tomorrow. Just talk to your husband to figure out what happened.”
Blue phone: Honestly, when I fancy someone gender is the last thing I consider. I'm not a breast man or a butt man. I never noticed things like that at all.
“We’ve already been tracking him down.”
StarkAE: Oh God. Definitely suspended. How is Spidey? Is his aunt going to kill me?
“With Pepper, I did right after our reconciliation before Morgan was born. Actually, I kept doing it until Morgan's second birthday.” Tony answered.
Blue phone: Before the war, I was in art school. I was planning on being a cartoonist. I was working two jobs to pay for it, one of which I am sure never made the history books about me. I think I’d want to go back to art school. Maybe, I would become an elementary school art teacher, which means also majoring in education. I like kids.
XXXXXX
Anthony: And tomorrow will be day 53.
Me: You know what, I am just going to ask you to keep drafting what you want to say to Happy. Maybe if you put down a few bullet points, things will go better.
I might get to talk to her again at 2 PM. Ana suggested that I make a video since the other Avengers will have important things to discuss with Mom. Also, this way, Nikki can say hi. He really misses his mom--divorce sucks. They say this is just a separation, but I know better. I know the end is coming.
Me: Good to know. But we both know Rhodey is a better choice. I’m glad you could come up with someone that maybe you could work with because I was almost desperate enough to suggest Agent Scary take over, but I don’t think she would ever want a desk job again.
“That’s good, although you could’ve waited until after the wedding to tell me,” Steve whispered to Tony. “Or actually tell me, I’m sitting next to you.”
“As well as being sober.” OK, so he is going to get into this a little. “It’s why I tried so hard for Morgan to get clean. It took a few attempts, but I got there.” Now he is going to help Simmons get there, hopefully. He feels like he owes that to the universe.
Me: Of course, Muffin. I’m a wonderful performer.
“It is a perfect time, Karen. Work with Mary to make sure I have the weekend free for Peter and May for that matter.” Because she’s going to need a friend too. “I should probably get up, but I don’t want to leave the scent of Steve behind.”
Me: I know we need to put out a press release, but I can’t bring myself to do it yet. There’s been a version of it sitting in my email for months. I just haven’t been ready to sign off on it because as soon as I do, that means it’s over.
Football Hunter: Look at the pretty picture of me in my suit. You get to strip it off of me tomorrow.
Me: I will have you know that I did write Lily bear a hard copy letter just last week, mostly because she didn't need to see all the pictures of Clint black and blue that Wanda sent me. Laura also didn't want me to know about you being under a 5150 hold because apparently, I triggered you having a violent flashback.
“Not that it would help. Although I do react to edibles. Although I need like three times as much. The thought is appreciated all the same.”
Me: It’s hard to be happy that James is not dead, when I remember, he’s alive because of Hydra. They tortured him for years and made him do all sorts of bad things. He was their slave. He killed your parents. No, they made him kill your parents. If I’d just kept him from falling then things would be different. He wouldn’t have to live with all that guilt, if we’re ever able to undo the programming. They’re working on it, but Hydra really screwed up his mind.
Me: Yes. Hey, as much as I want to keep talking to you, Rhodey just arrived, thankfully without his competition. Which means it’s time for Agent Fitz and Agent Coulson to give us the grand tour.
The big boss: Keep me updated
Counselor Laura: I don’t know if Steve 2018 ever tried because it could interact with his antidepressants. His body is not baseline.
If things were different, I probably would’ve had that announcement occur during the UN General Assembly the month before, even though it would’ve been New York instead of where the announcement took place in the movie. However, I don’t want to mess up my own timeline or go back and put it in. Besides, October is a great time to shake up the international stage with a major announcement about Wakanda actually being a technological superpower. Just in time to show everybody up at the November climate change talks. I’m sure they can bring a lot to the table when it comes to being green.
Anthony: If you’re not going to take advantage of your assistant’s super speed, what’s the point of having an assistant with super speed? I need a break after what happened. Also I have a few meetings with various government officials to deal with some of our fuck ups in the country. If I get them done now, that means more time with you.
Red phone: Yes. I guess we are playing 20 questions again?
So Jane is not budging. I got her the good chocolate and the good shoes and still I have to do the New York Times interview. She thinks it will humanize me. Seeing me be a lovesick fool makes her hate me a little less so she’s hoping that it will work with the rest of the public to help rehabilitate my image. I think I’m going to have to bring out the big guns which means Pepper Pot or the Director. Since my BFF is in the replacement patches, I should probably go with him, but he doesn’t quite have the ruthlessness necessary.
Me: Thank Thor one of you has some common sense.
To be continued
“I keep telling you to call me Steve," Steve said as he pulled out his phone. Thankfully it was the newer model Stark phone he got Steve for Christmas last year. Thanks to Deke, SI was slowly rolling out new consumer-electronics again.
Steve: Because Morgan has Tony wrapped around her little finger and he will always let her play with his phone. What was she texting Tony about?
“Check your phone.” She does, realizing that unlike everything else in the room, it’s still working.
“We tried but we couldn’t safeguard the other agencies. However, as a failsafe we’ve put a whole lot of wrong locations and false information into the database which explains why they’re attacking DC first instead of Miami like last time. Although Yo-Yo is here and not at an engagement party in Miami this time,” Leo explained.
“Always, unfortunately. OK, this is the last question for tonight because I feel like it will go downhill from here.”
Red phone: How’d that go?
Me: I’m leaving for Jimmy Kimmel in less than an hour. This episode will be live, which may or may not give Jane Barnett of PR, pulmonary issues.
Morgan’s dad: Sometimes, you need to be. It’s a skill I got from the business world. Still, I would like for you to answer the question.
Captain Tight Pants: Captain America is just a symbol; he's not a real person.
Me: I don’t know. Maybe we will fuck up so badly trying to save the world that there won’t be anything left in 70 years. I just feel like something bad is coming. Something that we won’t be ready to handle.
“You should since it’s already tomorrow wherever you are. Hey how are the new recruits?” Tony asked.
“You will once you return to DC.”
HSBF: Good to know I’m your snuggle bear.
“You are wonderful,” Steve said just before he took one out of the bag and quickly took a bite. “These are so much better.”
Counselor Laura from 2023: What about Sharon?
This is the last chapter that will come out before the season four premiere of Agents of Shield in the US. I am planning for things to diverge from the MCU at this point. In my mind Tony and Steve talking to each other can make it better for the enhance person community as a whole (before purple alien show up). I already have my own director picked out. Feel free to guess.
HSBF: Actually, the wounds are mostly healed already.
“I bet it was. I wish I could go back with you." Steve lamented.
Me: I thought you’re chief creative officer now.
FRIDAY: Statistically speaking, there is a 98.2% probability Hydra would have assassinated Howard Stark by other means if the Winter Soldier was not at their disposal. Journal entries recovered from Siberia indicate that the Winter Soldier was purposely chosen due to his previous affiliation with Howard. Sir is aware of that and is trying to make peace with the circumstances of his parents’ murder.
Melinda: Not at all.
Cousin Q: That’s what they think. Also, I really regret teaching you how to hack.
Tony Potts: But somehow gets Stark messaging and Instagram confused. This honestly makes me grateful that I did not go through my worst drug usage during the age of social media.
I'm not going to use your nickname because I think that's reserved for Cuddle Bunny. I’m beginning to really see the difference between the Winter Soldier and the guy who grew up with my boyfriend, mostly because I had a major breakthrough last week during a mission in Baltimore that was not sanctioned at all.
Tony Potts: That is something I would do to mess with Ross.  So you come from a world that's vastly different because unlike my Friday, his Friday actually sent those messages?
Tony: I promise. It’s going to be a long engagement anyway. I have to be able to get my fiancé in the country first.
I believe he is telling the truth, for multiple reasons, including the fact that I have been exchanging scientific notes with him since I was 11, after being introduced to him by Dr. Weaver. The doctor is a daughter of Wakanda and she vouched for him. In addition, Dr. Leopold has passed multiple polygraphs. Furthermore, his genetic tissue shows signs of being in long term cryo-stasis. Also, his genetic structure is slightly different than that of the Leopold Fitz from this timeline (for the sake of simplicity, I will be referring to him as Dr. Fitz). This is in line with information from NASA’s twin study, which is currently in progress.
The New Consultant: Actually, he was so exhausted when he got back he crashed next to Flash.
“The Captain even though he doesn’t want us to call him that anymore. You should tell Coulson the truth before it’s too late.”  She glared at him, wondering how he even knew about her conversation with Steve. Then again, he did make the phone she was using. But maybe there was a darker reason for his words.
Steve: But if we succeed, we’re going to lose Kamala. Tony says that she’s old enough to decide who she wants to live with, but I’m sure she would like to go back to them.
Nomad: You have access?
Me: And when my AI is mad at me, it’s never a good sign. Although dating usually consists of more than just writing each other back and forth.
“Why didn't you just destroy the Infinity stone?” Flash asked. “If it’s gone, the purple ass hole can’t use it to wipe us all out. We know that Wanda can destroy it. She did so in the other timeline before the purple one reversed it.”
Tony: If all goes well we will be able to virtually make out and have it feel like we’re actually making out despite being in separate countries. And, of course, agents will be able to train and others will be able to work through their most traumatic event. But there will be making out for us, maybe even more. Bonus, I will also get to hear your sassy comments instead of just read them.
Agent L. Barton: I’ve heard.
CoulsonPJ: I think I still would have sent you to babysit Stark although hey, at least this way you are a card-carrying Avenger. I can’t wait for you to get your own action figure. I’m buying three.
There are a couple of things that I gleaned from Ragnarok that will be used but only little things because again the events of the movie haven’t taken yet in this universe. I also doubt that we will be affected by Runaways or the Punisher. They are running in their own lane, but we shall see. I reserve the right to drawl anything from any other part of the MCU that will enhance the story, except for probably the Inhumans because that show is exiled from my community.
Anthony love: PS that body part really misses you and is sad we probably won’t even have time for a supply room handjob. We haven’t been in the same country since Valentine’s Day/Presidents’ Day weekend. The finalization of the Mumbai agreement and getting Flash settled in his own apartment have been time-consuming.
Tony: Ana 2018 sent me a picture of my less idiotic self kissing Steve in the Rose Garden. I only feel like crying a little.
HSBF: OK, my perfect day would be waking up next to you and not having to worry about Ross or the Accords.
: refers to Miles Morales of Queens. Father former Shield, may have been recruited by Hydra. Now NYPD. Uncle small-time criminal but aided Spider-Man during Vulture incident.
“This is also true,” Tony said, cutting off his own lamp and letting Steve take away his Stark pad. Otherwise, he would keep reading the history of the other timeline. Which was definitely not conducive to sleep. Although accidentally falling into Steve’s chest was. If he woke up wrapped around Steve, nobody needed to know.

HSBF: See it wouldn’t be so awful now. So would you rather have the body or mind of your 30-year-old self?
OK, I’m going to stop here because I think we need to actually be talking to each other to do the next question. Please, Tony, apologize to Jane, even though I don’t think you should apologize for coming out again. Just for some of the other stuff. I don’t want to have to come up with answers we can actually use in the New York Times.
Cuddle Bunny: I didn’t know that.
Nomad: Death is hard for some.
Agent M: Do not let Liberty come to Red Malibu’s location.
Tony: Everything was exactly the same up until a month after the Avenger uncivil toddler squabble.
CoulsonPJ: I hope so too. I'm still upset that Fury waited so long to tell you when he was always planning for you to know. You didn’t need to suffer like that.
So, Steve was right, that no matter the awkwardness or bad blood they could fight and quip with the best of them.
Me: Of course we are. You already got the Avengers on speaking terms again, which is a must if an apocalypse is on the horizon.
Me: She’s really going full teenager?
The Big Boss: No, you did not and apology accepted.
Tony: I have to tell James even though part of me thinks that LMDs could be useful. Maybe if there was a LMD Steve running around, Stefan Carter could move back to the states and we could live happily ever after without anybody knowing that you were back and you know, trying to kidnap you to run experiments on you. Also the LMD can deal with the bullet damage, not you. Bonus.
“I haven’t read the play for a while but I think offering sex to stay out of war is the exact opposite. You really should go to sleep. You ramble when you’re sleep deprived."
HSBF: Probably because nobody is letting you survive by smoothie and coffee alone anymore. Actually, I wasn’t talking about Ross. I didn’t know. I guess it’s didn’t make the news here. Although, I’m a little rusty with the local language, so I could’ve missed it anyway.
Agent 13: I understand what you mean. Look, this isn't exactly a social call. I'm investigating what happened at the gala last night and I want to ask you some questions about what happened. You were talking to Anthony when it happened.
I also want to be able to talk about other things with you like the fact that Jane is now impervious to bribery or that the smartest person you’ve ever met is treating your BFF. And no, I’m not offended that you know someone smarter than me.
Me: Yes. Why are you mad at Happy?
“Or I accepted that I did get back to her. Just two years earlier. Therefore, the best way to protect her is to save the world. It is just unfortunate that she already has her own Fitz. That’s okay, I kind of like him,” Leo smirked at her.
DILF: Have you considered not letting Deke have access to your servers?
This chapter takes place about three days after the last one.
Agent M: I have no comments on that.
Purple arrow 2018: You killed somebody because you made a deal to protect me, so that's another body on me. It doesn't matter that he was some domestic terrorist trying to hurt little kids. I didn't want you to become me. I'm not a good person, but you are.
Red phone. They absolutely hate all the pornographic conversations they’ve been intercepting from me. I think that’s why they kept me there at least five hours longer than necessary.
HSBF: Someone saw that coming?
Counselor Laura: Not yet.
HSBF: Clint thought it was brilliant.
And you’re probably right about me not making it to the West Coast anytime soon, which is more the reason for you to come do Thanksgiving at the compound. I promise it will be better than a board meeting.
Me: Yes.
“Do you know what the real difference between us and our other selves is?” Tony asked Steve.
I am sorry we did all night science. We just had to finish the project, but we're done now. Actually, I’m emailing you now because we're all going to go to sleep. Even me because apparently, I do need rest now. I think Wanda is slowly making me a real girl. I have mixed feelings about this. She better not make me have a period. This is her revenge for Obadiah's treachery leading to her parents' death. Never suggest classic Dick Van Dyke for Avenger movie night.
Actually, a few of the other young people hiding at the facility are also working with a tutors so that would probably be best. We can start our own little young Avenger school. Will teach them how to be champions for justice early on.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Sometimes, baby bird’s drawings don't make sense until after the fact. Then sometimes we make different choices, which means her drawings don't come true. [Redacted] sees potential timelines, not the future, as it must be. Nothing is written in stone.
Friday: Unfortunately, Sir, I cannot give you access because I do not have access to those files at this time.
Virginia: Am I getting my nanny back?
"Bless you."
Nomad: Good.
Nomad: Did you just remotely switch my phone over to a news stream?
“That's good. What program did you use? AA? Or did you go to a rehab center? Do you have a sponsor?” Deke asked, and Flash just kind of sputtered for a moment, not sure how to respond.
Me: You do look good in sunglasses.
Nomad: Very nice shoes.
Red phone: Honestly, I don't want him on the ATCU top-secret enhanced persons list complete with real name, home address, and DNA sample. He is a baby.
Melinda: She asked if Tony stopped being an Avenger because you married someone else. She also asked Friday how your engagement with Tony ended.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous.
Cuddle Bunny: Good luck with that.
“It’s okay if there is, though. You should be happy. At least Hunter’s an improvement on Ward.”
“And neither was Pepper, or rather he wasn’t right for her.”
Tony Potts: Which is good. Did I end up being Flash's foster parent because he got kicked out for being gay?
Me: Any halfway competent medical examiner can tell the difference between a neck breaking because of the impact of a vehicle and the neck breaking because someone snapped it.
"I saw the doodles." Tony was actually pretty good at drawing.
Tony: I’m talking to you now.
Tony: Okay, it would’ve been better if the reason for such little sleep was a BJ and not because some guy who I never met blames his poor decision to turn to a life of crime on me and tried to take the Avenger toy chest on its way to our new house.
Spoiler warning: There’s a line in this conversation inspired by the season for synapses of agents of SHIELD. I’m using it for the purpose of making a joke about it. There’s also a reference to the latest Steve Rogers Captain America comic book series because I needed to make a joke or two about that as well.
Venom: I think I like it when you’re adorable and protective Benjamin.
Agent M: I do. I don’t know about the former boss. It doesn’t matter. He’s not in charge now. Red Malibu isn’t even really in a coma, the doctors are just keeping him sedated to help him recover faster.
“By not doing what they did.” The Princess answered matter-of-factly.
“We definitely have to make sure the snap doesn’t happen there. I am interested in seeing what a wedding between us would look like. I bet there will be stars and American flags everywhere.” Tony joked.

Friday: Please listen to the song I Just Want You to Know by the Backstreet Boys to understand the sentiment behind the words that I am not allowed to forward to you.
Nomad: Don't. You don't need it. You're stronger than you think you are. Who cares what they think about you. They're wrong. They don't know who you are underneath the Tony Stark swagger. They have no idea of the true depth of your real character.
Iron Dad: First, you’re a Junior Avenger, or maybe we should go with Young Avenger. I’ll have Jeffrey do a focus group. Regardless, you must be out of college before you get to be a full-fledged Avenger, and that goes for both you and Benji.
Just as she read the message what she assumed was Peter cell phone started playing Dear Lie by TLC. Which was odd because that was her favorite group, but not something Peter would listen to. However, the cell phone kept playing. She finally went into her nephew’s room to retrieve the stupid thing. When she touched it, the screen unlocked and she saw the message from the mechanic.
“I won’t leave, though. I did last time, and that was a mistake. I won’t do that again.”
“EMP shielding. The same stuff used on the War Machine and Iron Man armor,” Leo explained.
Me: Also, Jane has decided that me and my new boyfriend are going to have to do the New York Times article. Someone’s going to interview us when we are in Mumbai for the wedding. It will make it all extra romantic. God, I despise PR damage control. You are so doing interviews once you’re no longer a criminal.
Red phone: That makes sense.
Purple arrow: I know I’ve seen shots of them making out on Twitter. Just because Steve went to save Tony from his meeting with the president doesn’t mean that you need to be there. The kids need you.
HSBF: Apart from the letter.
Me: You know Nikki barely tells me anything. My PI is much better. She even got me a picture of Spidey dad making contact with Hill. Although, Jones obviously wasn’t that sneaky because Patches came by to tell me to back off.
"You can’t take everything on yourself. It was his choice to ignore the plan."
Me: Yes, we’re still on. Yo-yo has yet to have to schedule something in this block. Also, the kids are preoccupied. They’re on their floor lamenting the fact that they have homework on day one in Yo-Yo and Happy are monitoring.
Blue phone: I’m glad you are getting out of the compound and having fun with the kids.
From: Pepper_pot
Agent L. Barton: Or the hand, I read the report. So I can see how he is blaming himself for what happened. He needs help. Everybody here does.
HSBF: It’s only gone to be a few weeks and then Christmas with you in Malta.
"I can contact some of these people for you if it would help?" His fiancé offered.
Virginia: She’s doing well. Do I need to tell Steve you’re coming by?
(See the end of the chapter for
Warning: Tony’s dirty mouth. Let me know if you think he’s starting to push us into M territory. I’m sure he’ll get us there eventually, especially if he ever successfully convinces Steve to try any branch of telecommunications sex. I am now accepting bets on if Tony will succeed at accomplishing that.
Venom: Which is understandable because rumors about our Inhuman heritage got us targeted by terrorists.
So obviously we’ve kissed and made up. Many many times. And it wasn’t right away. It took a while and probably several hundred text messages to get to where we are now. Good thing I have unlimited text messaging. Steve is worth the work.
Me: That gives me plenty of time to enact my revenge. Don’t say anything about the breakup. It hasn’t made it to the press yet because Jane is still trying to figure out a way to make Robert come out like the asshole that he is without damaging Pepper because our society is sexist as hell. It’s always the woman’s fault.
Tony: I only agree with that because I love you. Come back when you're done hanging out. We are having, congratulations we are engaged sex.
“And it’s good to see you shirtless,” Tony smirked at him on screen.
“I can see how that could happen,” Steve remarked.
Nomad: I think the candies were chosen at random after I gave them the specific allergy instructions.
You were kidnapped and brainwashed. You couldn't fight it and I now accept that it was out of your hands. It took me a while to get there because maybe there's a part of me that's mad that you did not withstand their torture. I never gave in. Not once. I got myself out of there with Yinsen’s help, but maybe you didn’t have a Yinsen to help you get the hell out of there. It’s stupid to hold you up to an unattainable standard.
Red phone: I can see Inside Out. You probably identify with Riley. This decade seems like broccoli pizza to you and all you want to do is get your old life back but you can’t.
"See, I knew there would be people down here that would understand." The man said, coming back in with chips, two slices of cold pizza, and a soda. Apparently, he heard their conversation from the kitchen. “Also, stop with the agent stuff. Just call me Deke. I’m not actually an agent. I am a consultant from Stark Industries.”
“Good. And there's another ethical question. Should we bring Phil back?”
The Mechanic: Also, the boyfriend just reminded me that Pierce also went through multiple confirmation hearings. I’m starting to lose faith in the confirmation process if people like that can get through.
"I forgot you were still frozen when Obadiah successfully used my mental issues to get me out of my own company after he had me kidnapped, which was responsible for most of my issues in the first place. Board members Asshole, Prick, and Dick are essentially threatening to lock me out of my company the same way. Because murder bots and superhero throw downs in Germany they can deal with, but a new boyfriend is apparently a bridge too far.”
Me: Yes. The tree is already up and everything. Who’s coming with you?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation you are all absolutely lovely.
HSBF: Me too.
Agent L. Barton: I’m sure it would be. How do you know all this?
D FitzSimmons: So the fact that I'm with Bobo one means that he didn’t die in the explosion. The monolith sent him back 22 months (?) in time. He sort of made a new timeline. Now I personally would have done something cool like becoming a rockstar super agent. Bobo One decided to become CCO of Stark industries and ended up with Hunter.
At this point, Leo is well aware that the future isn’t fixed like he once believed. He changed a lot of things over the last 22 months such as Stark being in charge of the ATCU, Shield not getting disbanded, keeping England in the EU, and his other self-marrying Simmons the previous year without being thrown into the future or past for that matter. Even Vijay Nadeer is alive and well, running for his sister’s former seat. By this point last time, the senator was dead. Now she would be spending the rest of her life in prison after being the first person kicked out of the Senate since Reconstruction due to treason. This was preferable to her dying a martyr. The “Superior” is dead, Bobbi and Robbie took him out some months ago with the other Secret Avengers.
“The Friday in the not completely fucked up timeline sent you my drunk text messages where the Friday here didn’t. I texted you all the time during those two years you were on the run. I just never sent them. I was afraid. Now I found out that somewhere in the multi-verse, there is a version where the messages were sent, and we did fix things. I think that’s the hardest thing to accept about our other selves.” Tony confessed.
“Definitely.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m glad you got back before school starts. I hate school. Can I just go to college now? Also, when will I get lab time again? I know I can’t be there all the time, but I can do Saturdays again.
“I think I should just get it over with.”
“The whole family looked so happy that day.” Natasha sent him pictures. Tony still has all of them.
Me: I’m even working on a new ‘toy’ that I can control remotely from wherever I am, complete with a biofeedback harness for me. Think of it as virtual reality sex. I can’t wait to beta test that on you.
From: Tony_Carbonell
“There was a prison riot in California wasn’t there?” Tony asked concerned.
BITC: Why do you get to do all the cool stuff?
Tony: Especially when one kid can tell you about your past, present, and future. He wasn't exactly happy to find pictures of what looked like a threesome between him, Simmons, and the deceased Fitz. Although that doesn't seem as far-fetched now. It's been a weird few days.
Me: We both know who’s in charge.
A/N: Simmons will be referring to herself as Jemma in her head but when Leo says that name, he’s referring to the Dr. Simmons from his original timeline. Yes, I know time travel is confusing.
Counselor Laura: That seems like one of Tony’s fantasies, but no one wanted to make him a martyr or get arrested for his execution.
TMNS: I will text BITC to explain what’s going on.
“You should know that Agent FitzSimmons is currently in the elevator asking for access to this floor.” The AI told the group.
A/N Summer 2020: Initially, I was going to have three “bad” timeline conversations in a row, but then new episodes of Agents of Shield started, and I had to go back and do some Leo Fitz stuff due to his absence in the first two episodes. By the time you see this conversation, the show will be over, and I will be crying. Yes, I wrote the chapter after the first two episodes in early June. Yes, these chapters are prepared months in advance of when they come out. I used to write one section of each story and rotate around. Now I usually write a block of anywhere from 4 to 12 chapters before moving onto another one of my stories. I find this method keeps the creative juices going better.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Exactly, but we need Pym particles. It might be better for you to do it on your side since Dr. Pym is still alive. Your timeline has you, Peter, two Fitzs, a sober Simmons, Deke, Tony, and the inventor of the necessary particles, Dr. Pym himself. He is still alive? In this timeline, there was some business with someone name Ghost. Which apparently was old Shield fuck up related.
Anthony: She is, but there’s no reason for you to be jealous, bunny lover. I’m just there to train her teenage nephew with spider powers. Of course she is completely unaware that he has those powers.
Morgan’s dad: Morgan loves having a playmate.
Me: Why do you have these existential crisis when I’m running a mission for HRH? Also, why can’t you deal with your love life on your own?
FRIDAY: He wanted the president to be aware of the effect that the current enhanced person policy is having on the children of those under jurisdiction of the Accords. He also invited Ms. Kahn of Jersey City to attend with him.
MayMQ: Ross is going to be here for the last day.
I have not told my brother any of this, mostly because I am concerned he would assume I was suffering from hallucinations caused by grief for Father. Obviously the story seem illogical, but I’m not losing him. Not if there’s a chance that I can keep it from happening. I won’t lose anyone else.
Tony: We both have best friends named James that we will do things for that may not be the best for everyone else.
Counselor Laura: So, we have all the time in the universe to plan this, right?
Blue phone: You were bullied in school?
May: I feel like there is a long story there.
Friday: You are equally frustrating.
Morgan’s dad: That’s good for us, though. When we dropped Laura back, do you think the other Avengers will let us borrow it?
Me: Here’s the problem, I met this great guy who I am completely in love with. Unfortunately, we do not live in the same country right now. The reason why we don’t live in the same country is I do not want to sign a document putting myself under government control, because I don’t entirely trust my government right now.
Several individuals have asked for a guide to the code names Tony and others use in this crazy story. After receiving several requests for this due to the confusing nature of Interlude 22, I decided to finally do it. I’m giving you one as written by Princess Shuri because even geniuses can get confused when reading the cryptic messages of Tony Stark.
Nomad: I think that’s a good call.
“It's more like the director.” Flash corrected before Ana interrupted.
Me: Howard owned an island. I just inherited the thing and thankfully no one was the wiser.
“Hey, do you want to take over driving? We should be approaching my favorite gas station in the next 20 minutes. I want to text Laura to see how operation get a therapist is going.” Because he probably shouldn’t let Friday keep driving for too long. Technically, AI drivers are a little illegal. They definitely have to get rid of those stupid accords.
Me: Funny. Thankfully for you, I am not one for genetic engineering. And Dr. Radcliffe did develop that gas that could have turned most of Europe into super powered zombies under duress. Which is better than we can say about my apocalypse.
Anthony: I can’t get over your artwork. You’re really good. I love a man in uniform.
“You were also drunk for most of the 1990s, the 1890s as well, in addition to the 1790s. It’s entirely possible, you were too busy with your cup to notice. Have you considered counseling?” Loki remarked.
“But it wasn’t you. It was the program,” she argued.
Cuddle Bunny: You know if you keep making jokes like that, I’ll take you seriously.
Nomad: Well at least that will keep you distracted from worrying about your ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend.
Person that cares about my boss: So Tony being behind closed doors with the president and small children is the reason why he can’t reply to any of my messages or explain to me what he meant by me knowing agent Melinda May in the biblical sense?
HSBF: That doesn’t surprise me. So what are you doing right now?
Me: Yo-Yo is going to be going undercover as my new assistant. However, one of the ATCU transplants made some snide comment about how it would be more plausible for her to pass as the "help" since she’s still working on learning English. Which was a stupid comment because she’s been studying for only a few months and she’s almost fluent.
Me: I’m a dick, but I am totally willing to own up to it. Therapy is good.
HSBF: Are you still having dinner soon with the king?
“That right there is what I value in a friendship.”
Love: And even that’s hit or miss.
Me: Of course, you told her.
Steve: Do I have time to take Robin and Morgan for breakfast with Tony?
Me: Surprisingly, Friday doesn’t have to alter the text that much. You are now cuddle bunny in my address book.
Steve: I thought you didn't believe in the impossible?
It was mostly because of the teleportation aspect of it. One minute Laura was alone, and the next, he was standing in front of her and attempting to hug her. It was very disconcerting.
The Mechanic: This is good. Maybe I’ll get to live in the same country as my boyfriend before the next alien invasion. Fingers crossed.
For those of you who read Star Trek (particularly the Kelvin timeline), tomorrow I will be posting my entry for K/S Advent 2016 titled How to Survive (Until) Your Wedding. Check it out tomorrow if you're into that sort of thing.
Me: That he bought himself. This is why I’m carrying my own, this time.
To be continued…
HSBF: It only counts as dinner if you had lunch. Did you have lunch?
Nomad: They are just sketches, nothing fancy. I don’t have all my supplies.
“I heard you made a particle accelerator in your garage. Although I didn’t know you made a new element.”
“Yes. He was dying, slowly because of the sacrifice he made to fix my mistakes.” That doesn’t surprise her. “He didn’t tell us. He never told us before I was sent back. I only knew because somebody else told me.” She felt like Leo was holding something back. She was too afraid to ask.
Me: I can’t wait to see you either. Although would you be upset if I didn’t show up to the hotel alone?
Cuddle Bunny: Probably because you have the most field experience. You can also be a really good leader when you want to be.
Me: Tony, focus.
Me: Shellhead is trying to buy his way out of it, but he’s keeping Secretary Asshole away from my kids and came up with a way for me to see them, so maybe I’ll forgive him eventually.
Tony: I was trying to avoid that. Baseball cap and everything. This will totally be on Twitter in five minutes.
“That sounds like a lot of my adult friendships.” Her old friendships back at the farmhouse before she became an agent herself that is. It wasn’t exactly like she could tell them what her husband did for a living. Also, most of her friendships now are with people who are Avengers, Shield agents, or the parents of kids with superpowers.
Me: It is. I felt like he shouldn’t even be here. I should not have brought him to Germany or rather have Kevin bring him to Germany. Kevin really hated Spider sitting. I think that’s the real reason why he switched to working with Pepper. Other than getting to live in the same state as his wife again.
Nomad: Not that they're both gone, but that they found each other and they're together again.
Anthony love: I know you’ve been radio silent for less than an hour, but she’s worried. You know we’re all on edge because Robin keeps drawing pictures of doom, gloom, and a purple genocidal maniac.
Tony: Definitely. So how is he getting along with your hubby?
Counselor Laura: Yes. Friday told me.
Me: I prefer the second option.
Cuddle Bunny: I will pass on the message.
“He knew about Artie. Apparently, I’m not good at being sneaky,” Steve explained with a sigh.
Nomad: People ship us? What does that even mean?
Anthony: Also, I feel like we would have to deal with less super villains that way. They would totally want to crash.
Me: Because apparently you’re dating Apple Pie himself.
Tony: You know I’m kind of lamenting the fact that there’s a 98% chance that the genius Princess is reading these text messages. I was kind of hoping to find out if you were willing to try text message sex now that you actually had something to visualize.
Counselor Laura: Acting director, my Tony can’t get through a confirmation hearing for being too independent and way too gay. Also, Steve is still a bit of an asshole. It’s a universal trait. But he’s getting better at acknowledging that in my timeline.
Agent 13: Someone will. Take care of yourself.
Tony: I’m not saying no, but why me? I consider it a miracle that I haven’t relapsed for a while.
Cuddle Bunny: Since you’ve said so many outlandish things to me that have turned out to be true, I’m going to trust that the giant killer monster thing is not hyperbole.
“And that may be years from now. Besides, she did sleep with hog face when she thought she was never going to get off that planet. She would understand. It would only be fair.”
Tony Potts: Yes. This will piss off Pepper because I don't think she wants to take care of both kids for an extended period by herself. Although the big sister is supposed to arrive Friday night, which will help.
Melinda: Leo knocked me unconscious because he was afraid I was going to do something stupid to get Phil back.
Additional notes: Since this story is so ridiculously long I would just like to remind everyone that the Bulletproof Pacifists is Joey Gutierrez. He’s an inhuman from season three of Agents of Shield and our first acknowledged as gay in canon character with powers. He tried to ask Tony out for “coffee” when they train together earlier in the story, but Tony turned him down because he is head over feet in love with Steve.
“Is it easier knowing that there’s a version of us that went through Siberia and eventually overcame that?” Steve asked.
MayMQ: I know what you mean.
May: I’m sure you were just being polite when you woke up wrapped around him like a security blanket. We’ve shared a bed for almost five years, and you never wake up curled around me.
Now answers to my questions from last time: HRH is shorthand for Her Royal Highness, and in this case refers to Princess Shuri, our favorite 16-year-old Royal genius. I’m so happy so many of you figure that out. Cyber cookies for all of you. Of course she’s friends with Friday. She may even be giving her code a little tune up. Okay, she may be the one responsible for some of the matchmaking tendencies Friday has developed much to Tony’s frustration. A 16-year-old needs to have hobbies, even if she is a 16-year-old super genius and first in line to take the throne. It can’t be all work.
“I’m going to have to fix that.”
As for the beginning of your letter, I think for right now I want to just be James. The kids around here call me White Wolf, but I think James works better. I really don’t feel like a Bucky anymore. Too much has happened. I’m not sure who I feel like, but I’m trying to find that person.
Anthony: Maybe
“Sam and Natasha seem to be okay with us being together. You arranged for Wanda and Vision to be together so I’m pretty sure she’s already on your side.”
The Mechanic: What are friends for? I’ll see you next week. We can do lunch. After my Presidential meeting.
Me: Lunch was scheduled, but then I got pulled into a meeting with the forensic accountants. Thankfully, Yo-Yo managed to slip me a protein bar at some point. Happy was not happy that he’s been sort of replaced with someone with superspeed
Anthony: Obviously Pulp Fiction needs to be added to the list. Along with A Time to Kill, Unbreakable, and Snakes on a Plane just because.
Steve: Possibly.
Anthony love: I feel like you said no to those demands.
“That makes complete sense.”
Agent Laura: I don’t think it will. I heard Robin drew a picture of the three together. It seems obvious that there’s a third option on the table here.
Me: Yes.
Chief mechanic: It’s easier to read things when you’re on standby to be interviewed by people you really don’t like. Or during boring meetings. I just let snuggle bear do the talking. Your big boss was not impressed with Stevie Bear’s tells of the confederacy or their warnings. He thinks it was just an attempt to extort resources.
“Because we're not ready yet. If you could just wait until...” Bobo one stopped speaking when Hunter and Friday glared at him.
Me: Understandable
The Big Boss: And you will be participating.
In my personal head canon, Sitwell did not go to the Hydra side until New York. He was still a clean agent (yet starting to get bitter) during the events of the Consultant which is referred to in this chapter. Although by Item 47, he was already team Hydra.
“You’re not a cold-blooded killer,” He said looking directly at Leo.
Anthony: That actor is one of the busiest guys in modern show business. Personally, I think the guy is really an LMD that Patches planted to keep everyone off his trail.
Also, this begins an arc of very heavy Tony/Steve content. I know many of you will be very happy about that. As I watch the Disney+ shows, I need a better timeline where Tony and Steve get their shit together. Please no discussion about Falcon and the Winter Soldier in the comments. However, it’s OK to start talking about WandaVision. Actually, some of the upcoming chapters will have Little factoids that we learned from WandaVision. I’m probably going to be doing the same with the other shows as they come out.  Especially anything related to how life was during the blip.
Me: I just do stupid shit too often.
Blue phone: I mean tuberculosis.
I apologize for this arriving so late. It was held up during the proofreading process because real life is evil. In the end, to get this up, the second half of the chapter was proofread by a grammar AI only. Although according to Grammarly, this chapter is in the 99th percentile, so fingers crossed, we caught everything. I am now looking for a new person to beta the SQL. Please PM me if you're interested. In the meantime, Grammarly will have to do.
Tony: I get that. However, Leo Fitz is a miracle worker and Melinda is fine. They’re still running test but she’s recovering nicely, despite the shot directly to the spinal cord.
Subject: I need to find a new job
HSBF: Which is?
Me: No, apparently, I’m meeting with the Princess of Wakanda instead. I’m sure one of my State Department friends suggested it. Or Rhodey. Okay, maybe he’s not so okay with what’s happening.
I am decrypting a lot of Hydra files. I probably should have done this after Shield fell apart, but I was too busy chasing scepters and making murder bots. I’m starting to realize what sick fuckers those Hydra bastards really were. Maybe that’s another step in dealing with this. Why do I feel that working through my parents’ murder is going to have more steps than AA?
Tony: Although, how many years must pass for it to be appropriate for us to ask you to be our surrogate? You and Steve would make a cute baby together. I think Afia needs a little sister, we can call her Morgan. I would also be OK if you wanted to go with the Babylonian surrogacy method. As long as I could watch.
Also minor spoilers for Agents of Shield episode 4.2 and beyond. I’m borrowing one of the characters introduced.
“One, this is Pepper’s house, as you told me earlier. Two, that’s Hunter’s usual room.” Steve said pointedly.
Anthony: Maria was a goddess among women. I don’t know how she put up with Howard for so long. Howard only talked about his mom, mostly about how she finally left his dad. She was the only good part of his childhood, apparently.
Me: They were always terrified, but now they have twitter.
Me: Why?
Tony: I can completely understand that even though I leave Hunter unattended with my children.
Me: Apparently somebody needs to keep her occupied when big brother is forced to spend quality time at UN meetings and at various diplomatic receptions. Apparently, I’m the best person to do this. Although I’m kind of sad I’m not going to be at his meeting with outgoing Secretary Ross. That would require popcorn
Me: I’m sure it was the strudel. I wish you could be in Malta too, especially today. How are you holding up?
Me: I will be sure to have Yo-Yo make time in my schedule.
Me: Are you hoping for regime change? Who are you voting for?
“You understand mistakes were made on both sides? There were no good choices during the Accords’ fiasco or as my Tony refers to it as the Avengers’ uncivil toddler squabble.” Steve half chuckled at that.
“Obviously.  We would have to wait until I can at least legally step foot in the US again,” Steve joked.
Rogers: So there was more to Tony’s radio silence then just being mad at me?
Me: We’ve talked about this. Do not take responsibility for the stupidity of others. I’m stupid enough for both of us. This one’s on me.
To: Pepper_pot
Me: What do you think of the Tony Stark Academy for the Gifted?
BITC: That is a very obvious point. Because of my overprotective mom, I’m stuck here doing nothing. Trust me, I would rather be helping you guys than thinking about Flash and Benji dating.
Okay, that was a fast reply. I haven’t even switched to the other account yet. Yes, I will invite Pepper to Thanksgiving myself. And I’ll take care of things the day of.  I’m not that helpless.
Me: Are you upset that life went on without you or that you weren't here to participate in their lives and your lamenting those lost shared experiences?
Anthony: I can’t deal with people who are more into appearances then anything else. I had enough of that from the Obadiah years.
Anthony: No, I was calling Zephyr One. Also, the FedEx guy showed up. I think I got your portfolio or one of my enemies is trying the letter bomb thing. I’m still opening the box. How much tape was used on this?
Tony: That would be nice. I really don’t feel like talking to the not so reformed doctor and Monkey Lover must be text messaging the girlfriend. It sounds like the type of conversations we have. Although, I don’t know why he refers to her as football Hunter in his contacts.
HSBF: Is that a good idea?
Me: A 27-year-old dying in the prime of life is always going to be weird no matter what. It shouldn’t happen and it always hurts when it does.
“No, you are being a knob to your grandkid. We all make mistakes; get over it." Hunter told his husband. Yep, Deke likes this Hunter.
Anthony: After four years together, Virginia Potts and I have decided that we are more suited to be friends and business partners. Although our romantic relationship has run its course, we are committed to keeping Stark Industries a leader in the areas of green energy, cybernetics, nano tech, and telecommunications. We hope that you will respect our privacy at this difficult time. Thank you.
Finally, the “me” in this chapter is Lance Hunter.
Genius Princess: A while. The future is fluid. With each choice, I make Robbin’s drawings change. When she first arrived, she was drawing pictures of a cracked earth like you were aware of. Then they switched to a battle that was similar to what happened in the other timeline. You saw those pictures.
This takes place 10 hours after the last chapter.
Tony Potts: Are you with the doctor yet?
Anthony love: We get there in 5, which will give me time to prepare for Natasha giving me a matching black eye. I wonder if Fitz finished the dermal regenerator. Lily bear has excellent aim for an adolescent.
Tony: So, what did he say to you?
"You know what, both. I’m not sure how long May Parker-Riley is going to believe that Peter just happened to see something at his date’s house and tipped off the authorities. That’s like only slightly more believable than that ridiculous cover story that Coulson came up with to cover up the fact that Obadiah tried to kill me and I took him out instead. I’m just glad that the board never found out about that during the Shield data dump post implosion."
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all lovely.
Me: Really?
Jemma: I don’t know. Reading Deke’s words and knowing that Fitz could move forward hurts. It made me realize that I wasted everything wallowing in my own misery. What have I done? Nothing at all. I am either drunk or in the framework all the time.
Me: I’d prefer to do my philanthropy closer to home and the University only cared about the check which they still got, on the condition that they increase scholarships for low income students by 10% over the next five years. I’d much rather spend my night cheering up sick kids with you then having to dodge really invasive questions from assholes who want to know why I’m there alone.
To be continued.
Please note this is the last chapter I have back from proofreading. I hope to get more back soon, but we shall see. I am in need of another proofreader to work on either Marvel or Star Trek stories (I’ll even take someone willing to do my Ugly Betty stories). That way I can have one person doing each story which does speed things up. Please contact me if you are interested.
Captain tight pants: With Pepper. You guys were together for a long time.
“I’m not surprised.”
“You had the kids that weekend, and there may have been some edibles involved. May suggested that I send you a picture of my privates. When high, this seemed like a good idea.” Tony is now 100% sure Steve’s future ex-wife ships them.
Me: That would not surprise me.
OK, maybe some conversation shouldn’t happen in a text message.
Blue phone: I see you get your avoidance tendencies from your creator. I will add it to the list.
Anthony love: I feel like that’s going to get me dragged to the nearest psychiatric hospital, and I don’t have time for mental health rehab right now.
Red phone: That webbing he used to lasso your shield, he created it by himself. We are currently trying to find a way to put it in cell phone cases and protective clothing.
Me: I agree.
“Look I’m going to go get your luggage from the hallway. Don’t unpack because we will be switching hotels in the morning because I think you need some space to think about all of this. Then Monday you will show up to escort Stark to his various business meetings where you will try to ignore the fact that he will most likely be covered in bite marks.”
SimmonsJA: If you really were emotionally ready to have sex with Stefan, you wouldn’t need me or Dr. Suarez to give you the okay. You would have ignored our recommendation entirely. But you need us to give you the metaphorical green light because deep down inside you know that you’re not ready for this.
15 minutes later, Steve arrived to take her place, and Bruce resumed his interrogation. Steve didn’t really participate except when Bruce asked him if he was bisexual and to confirm he really did date a former Sen. Christopher Ward staffer. I feel horrible for revealing that, but I needed to know for sure how close the timelines are. (And that felt like a safer topic then the half-sister in Nevada.) I’m now 100% sure they diverged when Leo came back.
Me: For a normal person. We’re not normal, but even we can’t do like 99 different jobs. So basically, we’re dividing the workload of the two of us amongst an additional person.
HSBF: She said I could still contact you. And I needed to know what was going on, especially if it put the others in danger.
Counselor Laura: I think me being stuck in 2023 qualifies as an emergency. Why is Tony not a part of Avengers? Is it because Steve is now married to May? How did that happen? Also, where is Ana? Why aren’t you Afia anymore?
Me: But you like tinkering.
HSBF: The Director wouldn’t let you come alone?
Nomad: There’s no point in being angry at the dead.
“That’s kind of broken.”
“If I could design something to get rid of things like that, the 90s gay sex tape wouldn't exist. Besides, even I have the pictures saved of your Instagram indiscretion. Really you have nothing to be ashamed of. May and other me are very lucky.” Tony joked.
Red phone: Just like agent
Nomad: I hate corn syrup. It's one of the worst things about the century. Everything tastes weird.
“Sometimes, I really hate you.”
“They say the third times the charm. The Senator killed him, the first time around. I killed him the second,” Leo confessed.
Me: Just let me know which senators I need to contribute campaign money to.
“Yes, boss." Of course, that's when Friday started playing Invisible by Linkin Park. He forgot that song was on that list. It always made him think about Siberia. He did not need that right now.
Also, please note that I’m going to be away on vacation, so it’s going to be at least two weeks before I post anything else. Although I’m hoping that I can get some proofreading done while out.
There’s also the fact that this Clint was covered in tattoos and had ridiculous hair. She hasn’t seen Clint since he picked up Nikki for his time with the baby back in February. Laura is pretty sure one of the kids would’ve mentioned dad’s new tattoos after their numerous video calls with their father. They talked to the man almost daily during their trial separation.
"But that's not you. The guy that Steve talks about is definitely not the guy who put out a sex tape for attention or has done 99% of the other things that the media has attributed to him."
Nomad: I'm not sure if Anthony still likes me like that because of what happened. I don’t even really like myself right now.
Steve: My relationship with Tony is fine. He’s taking care of Robin while we’re trying to undo what Thanos did.
Venom: That wasn’t about you. It’s been a long day [redacted], and it just caught up all at once. Although I really want to know more about this tingling.
The Boy in the Chair: Where are you? Did you really get to meet Captain America? Is he Cool in person?
“Philip informed me.”
Me: Sorry.
Good news: I now have a beta reader again for this story. Katruna has taken over beta duties and I am very appreciative.
“Did you have a side piece?” Tony asked, even though he knew it was a ridiculous question.
Tony: I know that but I still wish it was different.
StarkAE: Fuck! Is that a guy tied up in web kind of dressed like a vulture? Are those things from the Avengers’ toy supply? How did those pictures end up on Twitter?
