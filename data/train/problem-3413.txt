Castiel settles on a stool and sips at the foam of his drink. Something about the name seems fitting. “I think I do.”
As it is now, he’s going to have to call Uri to come back up here to explain everything. As he reaches for the phone, the room’s door opens; a now-familiar head peeks in, green eyes settling on him. Dean shuffles his feet and glances around the room.
They both let out a short, shad chuckle. “Aren’t we a pair,” Dean says, squeezing Castiel’s hand.
“Hey, sweetie, everything OK?” Jolene glances at Dean and raises an eyebrow. She’s concerned, and Castiel can’t blame her considering what she’s been told.
Dean bumps into the cart before he gets it moving again and he looks at Castiel with one last smile before disappearing around a corner. Meg sighs heavily behind him. "Okay, loverboy. He's gone now. Are you going to stand next to my desk all day?"
It seems fitting, to use the table as a memorial of sorts. Taking his folding knife out of his pocket, the same one Cas used to cut his hand for the sigil, Dean starts carving the C of Cas’s name into the table. He’ll do the whole thing, not just the abbreviation, he deserves that at least. Sam sits and watches until he’s done. Just that action took  a lot out of him, so Dean gets up and gestures at the knife.
Dean says into his ear, “You need
They each slowly stand, and Castiel takes in the damage to the room. There’s flour everywhere, and the dough he’d prepped is now upended on the floor. Dean’s back and hair are dusted white, and he coughs as clouds of dust are raised when he pats himself down.
“Actually,” Sam finally speaks, eyebrows raised below one of the beanies he regularly wears since his hairline started going. “I have a proposal to make regarding Emma, regarding the other androids who have been going deviant more frequently of late.”
Sam watches as Dean’s limbs grow lax, his head dropping to the pillow, eyes rolling. Pushing one of the orderlies aside, Sam hovers over Dean, watches as his eyes focus and unfocus. They lock briefly on Sam’s face, and Sam grates out, “I’m your brother, Dean. We’re brothers,” just before his eyes roll back and his lids flutter closed.
“Jolene, this is my friend Dean. Dean, this is Jolene, my boss and the owner of this cafe.”
After using the bathroom, Castiel assists Dean off the couch and to his room. For a moment, he’s taken aback over Dean’s comment about being weak, almost echoing his nearly constant dismay over his own weakness. But he soon re-focuses on Dean again as he keeps him vertical, reminding himself that his human condition is nothing to the injuries Dean has faced. Now at Dean’s room, Castiel tells him he’s happy to be useful. There's a sorrow behind the words, because as a human, there’s so little he can actually do.
As Dean turns to leave, Castiel thinks of something. “Oh, Dean?”
That makes Cas snort, and Sam stomps his way back into the war room with a disgusted sigh. “Pull yourselves together.”
After a long day of sitting in awkward silence and watching Dean sleep, Jody arrives, insisting they come to her house for food and showers. During the drive, Castiel sits next to his meager belongings, behind Jody and Sam who converse quietly about Dean’s condition. He has nothing to add to the conversation, and once again wonders why he’s even here.
While Castiel is sliding a slice of cherry pie onto a plate, Jolene sticks her head out of the kitchen. “Hey, Mish?” She sees Dean and gives him the stinkeye. “I need to go to the store and pick up some supplies, but if you need me to wait…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Now all they can do is wait.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” asks Cas.
The shower on and the water warm, the last of the tension in his shoulders melts away under the spray. Dean was right, the pressure isn’t as good as the bunker, but better than many of the places he’s been. He uses the small bar of complimentary soap and starts washing. Careful of his injured wrist, he uses his other hand, and idly watches the suds rinse down the drain.
maybe Cas will enjoy learning some music culture?
“Dude…” With a sigh, Dean puts down the remote and turns to face him. “OK, here’s the deal. The trials to seal Hell messed Sam up real bad. He— He almost died. Would've if I’d let him finish the third one.” He squares his jaw, a sign Castiel has learned that means Dean’s upset and doesn’t want to talk about it. But he keeps going. “He’s still really messed up.”
Hyperfocused on Dean, Sam ignores the nurse. Watches as he takes a sip of water, the relief on his face. He doesn’t want to let go when the nurse tells him to, but is rewarded with Dean looking at him again, then Cas, and back to the nurse. Like he’s assessing the surroundings. Dean’s going to be all right, and Sam lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding as the nurse gives his brother a once-over, explaining injuries as she goes. It’s quite the tally.
“Nah.” Dean repositions them so Castiel is on his back, Dean leaning over him. “I like it.” Then he leans forward and kisses him.
Practically in Cas’s lap, Dean smirks. “And I love you, Castiel angel of… uh, of…”
Eventually, he gets Dean to reluctantly agree. Jolene has been trying to get Castiel to take more time off, and he has a couple days in a row coming up, so he tells her there’s a family emergency. It’s a partial truth. She drives him to the same gas station where he decided to stop in town for a while.
“Yeah.” He’s not, the throbbing in his wrist insistent, but he will be. No need to make Dean worry. It’s the same hand that he cut, so wrapping it up can be excused for the bleeding.
, I said, um… that there was, uhh, you know,
Pulling back, Dean looks him in the eye. “I mean it, anything.” They stare at each other a moment, and then Dean gives him a peck on the lips. “Go on. The longer we sit here, the harder it is to go.”
Castiel stares at the empty doorway for a few moments, face warm. Did Dean just
Stammering, Dean glances between Castiel and Meg before mumbling that he has more mail to deliver and disappearing around a partition. While his ass isn't as defined in dress slacks as they are in jeans, Castiel enjoys the view.
Mouth twitching, Castiel says, "Pity."
Now more awake, Castiel becomes aware of an urgent need. “Bathroom.”
Jolene’s face transforms with a bright smile. “How are you in the kitchen?”
“Do you want something to eat or drink?” Castiel asks, his tone cold.
"What? I saw you looking too."
five chapters and six hours later.
Emma, blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans, says, “Yes. I’ll go get Cas, if you’ll help finish setting the table.”
For instance, when Dean settles next to him with an enormous box and six slices of pie, he asks Sam what’s wrong. So he brings up Cas. And Jack. Watching Dean deflect, calling him an Eeyore, Sam decides to take matters into his own hands, by shoving a slice of pie into Dean’s face. Something loosens inside himself, and he lets out the first good laugh he’s had in weeks.
Meg leaves, and they start to clean up the scattered papers and shut down the computer and projector. Castiel taps a stack of papers into a neat pile, brow creased in thought. Dean hands him a binder clip, and he asks, “Dean, would you mind helping me with this tomorrow as well?”
“Don’t stop,” Dean whines, fingers digging into the flesh of Castiel’s ass as he chases his own release, which he finds soon after.
There isn’t time in his life for intimate relationships, and one-night-meetups have always felt classless to him. So here he is, thinking inappropriate thoughts about one of his company’s interns, who is about to walk through that door any minute. Thankfully Dean appears to have taken his suggestion of showing up late today. By the time he does show up, Castiel is composed again, and is trying to reorganize the schematics.
Dean’s first instinct is to reject the idea, both at the thought that he had potential and being compared to the girl, but Cas keeps going.
What’s left of a smile fades from Dean’s face. No, Dean’s not supposed to be sad! “Dean, I’m sorry.” Castiel tries to stand and trips over his own feet, prompting Dean to catch him. “I promise I won’t talk about being homeless any more.” He shakes his head. “Nope, just happy things, like when Jolene taught me how to make chocolate chip cookies!”
Castiel smiles when he gets on the bus headed for Wyoming, knowing he’s going to see Dean again.
“Right. Because while I may be a woman now, I was born a man, and my name was Joseph.”
He’s about to turn and leave when Cas says, “Dean?”
All the advertisements also showed the shirt untucked, and Castiel stands uncomfortably as he looks himself over, bending at the knees. These jeans are made of stiffer fabric than which he’s accustomed, and much more form-fitting. Perhaps he shouldn’t have ordered the “slim cut” as they’re quite tight around his posterior and thighs. Frowning at himself in the mirror, Castiel squats one more time to stretch the pants a bit more before heading to work.
Dean turns away and takes a long drink from his glass. “Dude, does this have something to do with you wearing a wig and your boss dressing like a woman? I mean I don’t mind if a guy wants to cross dress, but—” Castiel slaps Dean’s thigh,
They embraced in a tight hug, and as they separated, Dean saw Cas standing by the passenger door of the car. He waved Cas on over, and Sam hugged Cas just as tight. They had a lot to catch up on, but they had time and a nice long drive back to Harvelle’s, where they’d arranged for everyone to meet Sam.
“Yeah?” Dean turns at the doorway.
“I dunno.” Dean fidgets with Cas’ fingers. “It seems nice, having a place others can visit, like I did with family and friends after I got here.”
And of course, Dean perks up right away at that. “What is it, Cas?” He places a hand on the top of the backrest and leans toward Castiel.
He’d actually never thought about it before. “I suppose not?”
Dean and Cas look confused, while Eileen just shrugs, takes her coffee, and leads Miracle out of the kitchen, leaving them with cleanup duty. Which is fair. Once they’re finished, they head to the war room, where Sam’s sitting, fidgeting with his phone.
Castiel blinks at Sam. Yes, he does remember, what it was like to know nothing but the present, with a gift he didn’t understand but knew how to implement.
“Hmm?” Dean glances up, and the light above the table catches his eyes like crystal jade. “Because they’re always coming up with different things to put
Then the final monologue. Cas starts staring a hole in the side of his head. Dean determinedly does not look back. Not his fault it took Cas so long to get the message.
“Eh, not really but I like their style.” Dean shrugs one shoulder.
Why does it disappoint him so that Dean doesn’t request his assistance? He should be celebrating his resilience and ability to bounce back from injury. Until it’s time to finish preparing dinner, Castiel ponders the nature of human emotions, and how completely irrational they can be.
.” There’s a paring knife on the counter, and Castiel takes the opportunity to palm it.
“Can I at least get you to finish the bottle in your room?”
Things are developing a little slowly, but I do have a plan, I promise!
It’s mid-afternoon when Dean asks where they should go eat. There’s one particular place that Castiel thinks Dean might appreciate, so he directs them back into downtown. Hoping Dean  doesn’t notice the place before they can get out of the car, Castiel tells Dean to look for parking. Thankfully, they find a spot about a block away, although Dean grumbles about having to shove quarters into the meter when Castiel insists.
Oh, really? He’s trying to use that? “I remember. You said I sucked.”
Oh. Mr. Winchester.
“Here’s to stopping the bad guys, Cas.”
“What was that, Dean?”
Reminding Sam that his body is still weak and not as healed as he believes, Castiel tells Sam that there is an angel sharing his body. He doesn’t react as badly as expected, although Castiel suspects some manipulation on Gadreel’s part. After speaking with Sam, a few moments where his face is blank as he converses with the angel inside, and the explicit agreement that there will be no more taking over Sam’s body without permission, leaving him clueless, the subject turns to Dean.
Castiel denies it, but she seems to see more there, and refuses to believe otherwise and comforts him with that assumption.
The dog has helped, but Sam remembers the look on Dean’s face and how he’d bound up the stairs thinking Cas was on the other side. He hates that will be the last time Dean will hear his voice.
“Dean?”
“You’re a sweetheart, Emma,” Dean calls out to her as she heads for the front door.
Dean helps him remove his apron, which he just now realizes is streaked with flour. The wig is loose, so Castiel removes it and tosses it down on the counter, and notices it’s got flour in it, too. He chuckles bitterly. “I must look as bad as you, huh?”
The bottle of window cleaner slips from his hand and bounces off the floor.
“Look.” Dean turns in his seat to face him. “I don’t have the best track record, but I’m sure as hell gonna try.”
“Just checking up on you. Everything going alright?”
At the sound of Dean’s pained groans, Miracle puts his front paws on Dean’s lap and thoroughly gives him a tongue bath. That finally breaks the dam and Dean grabs onto the dog, letting out deep sobs, tears dampening the tan fur. When it finally subsides, Dean lets go, only to be assaulted with more smelly dog breath and a wet tongue.
Scowling, Cas holds out his mug to Dean, who fills it from the carafe sitting on a warmer within reach of both of them. Dean chuckles as he places it in Cas’ eager hand, watching as he barely bothers to check the temperature before slurping down his first mouthful. Knowing it will take at least a full mug before Cas becomes verbal, Dean serves himself some eggs and more bacon. Halfway through his coffee, Cas grabs some toast and the grape jelly.
“You don’t look worse for wear,” Dean says, taking a sip of coffee. “They gave me a fresh croissant, and said to meet you back here.”
Running into the sun
“How about you go finish the cookies I have rolled out in the kitchen, and I’ll watch the counter for the rest of the afternoon?”
Later, Sam stopped watching the clock and couldn’t remember when, A doctor came out to tell him Dean had survived surgeries to repair a collapsed, punctured lung and laceration to his heart (he was lucky it wasn’t a full puncture). The doctor said it was dicey for a while (Sam would find out later Dean died at least twice on the operating table) but he was currently as stable as someone in his condition could get.
Castiel is settled down for the night in the Gas n Sip stock room, curled up in his sleeping bag when his phone dings, letting him know he has a text message. It’s short but alarming:
“Exactly.” Castiel needs to keep him talking, wait for Dean to come back. “You know there is much about humanity you don’t understand. If you would just stop—”
He hates to admit it, but Sam insisted on contacting Rowena before they were allowed to set up the pyre. He had to know where Dean ended up. It was a relief to hear that she didn’t have him, and that she had it on good authority that he was being taken care of “good and proper” up in Heaven.
“I can make pizza, if that interests you.” Castiel recalls many hotel rooms the brothers have shared, pizza boxes stacked by the trash.
That name sounds familiar, something about an alternate universe. “Misha.”
The rest of the day is spent at the library checking more videos and trying to flesh out his background story. If there’s one thing he’s learned from not only the Winchesters, but his time as a homeless person, it’s that you need a good background story to tell other people. Castiel nervously watches the clock, and shows up at the shop ten minutes before five.
“Are you the one that did this to Dean?” Castiel tries a threatening tone.
“Fine.” Castiel is done arguing. “There’s someone coming in ten minutes, and I’ll see if they’ll cover for me.”
End of BaM chapter two, barreling through chapters 3 and 4, from Cas' POV.
By the time Dean usually comes with the mail, Castiel is standing awkwardly by Meg’s desk, coffee in hand, as he tries to grow accustomed to the fit of his clothing. It’s been a challenge to not tuck in his shirt all morning, and several employees have outright gawked at him. He would have gone and changed into his spare suit if Meg hadn’t whistled at him and threatened to quit if he did so. She’d also taken the liberty of undoing the top button of his shirt, saying that it was in the spirit of Casual Friday and that he’d thank her for it later.
“Other than stop, what could you possibly do that I wouldn’t like?”
“Just don’t forget your armband this time, Emma,” Cas says, leaning around Dean. “Having to hear him complain about another fine for an improperly marked android…”
“Yes, but…” Castiel sighs. “Why are you
Dean Winchester stumbles off the plane at O’Hare after an incredibly long trip. Ugh, he hates planes in the first place, but this was terrible. First, his plane got delayed in San Francisco. Then, they had to make an emergency stop in Denver because of some kind of problem with the toilets? Dean would have been more than happy to just hold it until they landed in Chicago, but he was subjected to yet another landing and takeoff, fraying his nerves even more.
It’s hot in here, and he’s tacky with sweat. While Dean lays out bandages and salve, Castiel uses his good hand to unbutton the collar of his shirt and flap it for some air circulation. If he had the motivation, he’d go turn on the ventilation.
“Remember that Russian lady that keeps coming in here and trying to talk to you?”
“Sam, Dean, I think we should consider this conversation after you’ve both calmed down. We’ll call you back after dinner, okay, Sam?” Cas places his hand on Dean’s shoulder, and gives Sam a significant look.
Nodding, Castiel thanks him and reaches out a hand for the folder. Dean comes in, and eyes the papers on the desk. “Hey, is all this schematics for vehicle ECU systems?”
Castiel gathers his shopping bags, and closes the Impala’s door. Dean’s gripping the wheel tightly, frowning. When he sees Castiel lean to look in through the window, he gives a little wave, which Castiel returns. There’s an awkward moment where Castiel stands there with his armload of groceries, eyes locked on Dean’s through the car’s window. But then Dean blinks, gives him a small smile, and starts her up. With a final nod, he backs out of the parking spot and drives away.
, he thinks to himself.
It’s not what he expected. He can’t say what he was expecting, considering the general population doesn’t know monsters exist and are real, but not… this. Everything’s wrong. Well, maybe not everything. Many monsters do live among the human population undetected. But the way they change form? Castiel supposes this is what he gets for watching fiction.
Moose Lounge is really a thing!
before comedy.
, is the reply.
Cas settles into his seat with a beer. “Then I guess we should watch that one.”
“Hey, boss.”
Dean couldn’t keep the grin from his face as Sam said, “Dean.”
Dean wakes up again in the infirmary. It’s quiet, no beeping equipment, so that’s good, but he’s sore. Cas was surprisingly heavy in a space that technically didn’t have a physical presence, but— wait. Where’s Cas? Sitting up causes a sharp pain, but when he looks, there he is, in the next bed over. Breathing. Thank… Jack.
He looks good. Tired, but good. Castiel balls his hands into fists behind his back, to keep from reaching out to touch. Dean’s eyes land on Castiel’s name tag, and his mouth forms a distasteful pout.
As they make their way back to the car, Castiel wonders how long today is going to last. Is Dean going to drop him off and go? What kind of entertainment can he offer to get him to stay? It’s way too soon when they stop at the Impala, and Dean unlocks the doors.
Jolene holds one cookie for Castiel, and takes a bite of the other one when he takes it from her. “Everyone has their shitty pasts. It’s how you let them define you that matters.” Dusting her hands off on her pants, she asks, “Do you take drugs, sell drugs, or make drugs?”
“Hey guys, can we talk for a second?”
“If I leave before you reject me, it won’t hurt as bad,” Castiel blurts.
“Sam… I don't… Mmh. I don't think I'm going anywhere.”
“Wait, I remember… after you pulled me out. Let me.” Placing his hand on Dean’s chest, Cas focuses, and… nothing. He looks at his hand. “Oh no.”
Yes, Castiel’s scared. What else should he be? “Everything’s different now, Dean. It all feels different.”
For lunch, Castiel offers to feed him, and he ends up with a pretty good roast beef sandwich, even though he’s afraid to ask how much it cost. It comes from some place with a fancy, French-like name. Man, rich people are on another level.
is helping me investigate?” He waves his hand at Castiel’s apron and pink shirt.
Dean shifts on the bed and winces in pain. Probably from his ribs. Mouth still heavy, he asks what happened. Sam makes sure there’s nobody at the door, asks what Dean remembers, just in case. But Dean’s eyebrows scrunch together, and he frowns.
“But you use the cheap disposables, Dean.” Castiel tries to wrap his mind around his logic. Wait, now that he thinks about it, while Dean keeps a disposable razor in his kit, he usually uses an electric trimmer.
Surprisingly, Dean never puts down his burger, and just looks down at the article. “Yeah? What about it, Sammy?” he says around a mouthful.
Dean has been working hard explaining things to Mr. Novak, but he’s… actually having fun. This isn’t exactly what he was hoping for out of this internship, but he likes it. He’s known cars his whole life, and when he got into engineering, he’d almost gone the mechanical route. But cars are mostly computers with engines and wheels nowadays, so he’s glad he’s able to help his boss with this project.
It’s gotten worse. The entire country is under martial law, with curfews in effect, traffic and communication controlled and monitored. Dean and Cas secure themselves in the house, having tucked all spare android supplies on hand in the storm cellars with the androids yesterday. If there’s one thing Winchesters know how to handle is preparation for a shitstorm. They have weapons loaded and hidden near windows and entrances, and they have a safe room they can hide in if the worst happens.
This is what he was afraid of. He just doesn’t know. “I, uh, don’t usually…” Castiel stumbles over his words, staring back at Dean over the roof of the car.
The next few days are trying. Castiel never liked lying to Dean, and he struggles to find excuses whenever Dean asks what would normally be innocuous questions. After a few obviously avoidant answers, Dean stops asking. While Castiel is grateful, he still feels bad, so brings something to occupy Dean, some general interest magazines and a puzzle book. Dean has always been smarter than he gave himself credit for, and he proves it by quickly solving many of the puzzles.
Castiel chokes, and Jolene pats him on his back as he coughs. As soon as he’s able to breathe again, he says, “No! No, we didn’t… Dean’s just… Why would you think that?!”
A warmth fills Castiel’s chest at the thought of Dean wanting him for company. “Where are you now?”
Through chapters 1 & 2 of BaM
If Sam fully intends to allow Dean to live a normal life if his memories never return, Castiel isn’t sure how to react to this side of Dean. The one who never learned to shield himself and his heart from the world.
Tentatively, he reaches out, carefully placing his hand on top of Cas’s on the bed. It’s warm. He watches the rise and fall of Cas’s chest, the features he’s grown so accustomed to having a serious expression, now relaxed and seemingly peaceful. Remembering Cas smiling through tears. “The one thing I want, is something I know I can’t have.”
What? “No, that’s not your responsibility, Dean.”
The afternoon is spent poring over geographical surveys of the region, looking for caves and other places wildlife might nest. It’s while studying Google Maps that Dean finds the old cabin. They decide to not wait another night, and go check it out. They really should have waited.
had been coerced, with Dean’s insistence.
Castiel is sorting through documents he’ll need for a meeting when there’s a knock on his door. Without looking up, he says, "Yes?" since very few other than his assistant have access to his office. Someone clears their throat, and a stack of envelopes land on the desk in his peripheral vision. With a sigh, Castiel looks up to remind his assistant that mail goes in the receptacle on the other side, but his eyes are met with vibrant green.
“No, Dean. It was good, this was good.” Castiel raises his beer, still mostly full.
so well then,” Castiel replies with a bit of an edge.
Lawrence, Kansas
In the store, waiting for the restrooms to be less crowded, Castiel finds a local map. Pleased that the city is indeed right on the lake, he decides this is as good a place to stop as any, at least for a little while. When the passengers all get back on the bus, only then does Castiel finally enter the restroom to relieve himself as well as wash his face and neck. Purchasing the map, a needed drink, and some snacks, Castiel heads south on 4th street. As the different directions of traffic split, he keeps to his path, facing oncoming traffic and taking in the sights of the local businesses.
“No Dean, this is serious. I— I don’t think I’m an angel anymore.”
Sam passes out right away, but Dean needs a while to wind down from the road and the memories from Sonny’s. Seeing the old place stirred up a lot of forgotten stuff. Especially meeting Robin again. Damn, he really had a thing for her. He really liked Sonny’s, he had felt like he belonged. Not that he’ll ever tell a soul. No, he had to be there for Sammy, watch out for him, protect his little brother when their dad was out on jobs.
Without a second thought, Dean answers, “Sure, I’d be glad to!”
Helping Dean change isn’t something Castiel had planned on. Dean’s always been so self-sufficient and stubborn, the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind until Dean asks him for help, already untying his hospital gown. Castiel's brain attempts to go offline. Once he regains composure, of course he’s willing to help, guiding Dean’s cast through an arm-hole of the sleeveless shirt. When Dean’s head pops through the collar, Castiel realizes his mistake. He’s standing in front of an almost naked Dean. Who, in spite of his injuries, does certain things to Castiel’s surprisingly responsive human body. As soon as the shirt is on, Castiel steps back and shoves his hands in the pockets of his jeans to hide one particularly inappropriate reaction.
“What?” Dean swallows his mouthful. “Besides, you’re still not at one hundred percent yet. Hell, you’re barely to seventy five on most days.” He tosses the phone back onto the tabletop.
Once dressed, Castiel helps make sure Dean doesn’t leave any tools of the trade behind, and he waits by the Impala while Dean checks out. When they’re both in the car, engine idling, Dean turns to him and asks, “It’s still early, anything you need to do before work?”
Dean’s presence is a siren call, and his body feels the pull, but he resists the urge. Distracting himself with cleaning behind the counter, checking the beans, he does anything to avoid the man in the green coat by the window, now making obscene noises over his pie. It doesn’t seem like Dean is in any kind of hurry, so Castiel relents, and asks for a 15 minute break before going to stand at Dean’s table, watching him take another sip of coffee.
“Down the hall, around the corner on your left,” Sam says with a soft voice.
They arrive at the taped off area, and Dean flashes a badge, which grants them access. As they make their way to the other side of the bus, Castiel stops in his tracks and takes in the sight of the pink spray covering the side of the bus and ground.
“Uh, I think 11 or noon?”
Dean appears with his cart dressed in his usual slacks but minus a tie, his shirt a colorful check print. Upon seeing Castiel, Dean hands him his mail bundle, greeting him with a "Morning, Boss."
Sam pushes aside his still visible anger to ask if Gadreel can heal Dean. The ramifications of Dean suddenly healing are discussed, and they decide that the least they can try to do is wake him up. With them all in agreement, Gadreel comes forward, promising that Sam is still conscious and watching. He stands by the head of the bed, pressing two fingers to Dean’s forehead. They glow, and after a moment, the glow fades, Gadreel dropping his hand.
One day, Castiel gets a message that they’re headed to upstate New York for a case, and to not worry if he doesn’t hear from Dean for a couple of days. How is he supposed to not worry, wondering if Dean and Sam are safe during a hunt?
"I've got you," Dean whispers, nibbling on an earlobe as he deftly undoes the button and fly, reaching in to grasp and tug on a cock he's only ever glimpsed once, although he couldn't see much past the bees at the time. Not that he was looking back then. One hand stroking and the other holding onto Cas's hip, Dean revels in every shout, moan, and whimper he drags out, grinding from behind, the whole time worshiping the neck that started them down this path.
Making a noise in his throat, Cas pulls away. “Dean…”
“You were wrong, Cas. You have me.”
Dean shakes his head and laughs, then tells him to get in the car. Leather creaking as they settle on the bench seat, Castiel wonders what he can offer Dean as entertainment. Then he remembers some advertisements he’s heard on the radio at night. Not that he wants to suggest this, but…
I have Dean a proper Hunter's Burial, so I've left that after the line break for those who need the closure.
“I’ve learned how to make a variety of things, and could cook, if you’re hungry.” He’s nervous, and expects Dean to leave. The fact that they’re standing together in the kitchen after hours has Castiel feeling strangely light headed.
Castiel lets out a laugh in a burst, shaking his head. Dean always manages to surprise him. Then it sinks in, that Dean never mentioned how
They’d gotten hooked up with an old hunter friend who owned a sizable chunk of farmland in between Flaxville and Whitetail. After some truck modifications and tech tweaking, they were smuggling deviant androids out of the country before October. It’s surprisingly easy. The hardest part is getting the deviant androids to willingly power down long enough to cross the border and make it to their sister farm near Big Beaver for reactivation, where Sam has been stationed. They solved that problem when Emma offered go with the shipments and bring back messages from those who were now free.
They use Emma’s secure audio channel. Sam’s voice comes from her mouth, which Dean’s always found a little freaky. “Holy shit, guys. Have you seen the news?”
. And here is Castiel, Graceless and effectively useless to do anything.
at him and nods. “Right.” Putting the car into drive, Dean pulls out of the school’s parking lot. “Where to, Cas?”
With the drink complete and lid snapped in place, it is exchanged for the stated amount of currency. Perhaps, if this coffee requires special equipment, that might explain the high price? The customer turns to leave, taking a sip from his cup. With a grimace, he turns back to the counter.
, Castiel thinks but doesn’t say. He looks down at his apron, the blond fringe of the wig falling over his eyes. “I didn’t bring a change of clothes,” he says, glancing up at Dean, who turns to look at him with another of those dazzling grins.
Castiel remembers now, what Dean had said about Ezekiel being willing to heal Sam. He hadn’t expected it to happen in such an unorthodox manner at the time. He also knows Ezekiel, and this angel isn’t them.
“With breakfast.” Shifting so that he’s not lying entirely on Castiel, Dean’s chin digs into his shoulder. “The coffee’s not as good as the cafe, but it should be enough to help start on the hangover you probably have.”
A smile lighting his face, Dean comes over to the empty seat. “Well, since you’re offering to feed me.”
Castiel is waiting when the doors open at Fresh Start the following morning, rushing through a shower and breakfast before putting on his nicest shirt and walking to the cafe. He greets Bernie and says he’d like to apply for the barista position. With a look of disbelieving surprise, Bernie calls for someone in the back, which turns out to be the kitchen. A statuesque Native American man… no, a woman? steps out from behind the door, dusting flour from their hands onto an apron. They ask what Bernie wants.
Thankfully, the awkwardness between him and Dean thaws during dinner in Jody’s presence. Perhaps it’s because he and Jody are able to share a secret smile at watching Dean eat more salad in one sitting than he’s possibly ever had. After dinner, Castiel helps clear the table, put away leftovers, and wash dishes. When he’s finished, he brings Dean his nightly medication and a glass of water.
Dean pouts at her. “I keep asking for pie, but you never bring me any.”
need to clean up by morning.”
“Oh.” Castiel lifts the mirror again, taking another look at his face, how his features do seem softened by the hairstyle. “And so I’ll need a more appropriate name.”
Dean’s given up on trying to have physical copies of everything, but luckily it’s on a streaming service. After a couple of clicks, the movie starts. He’s a little nervous, because Cas hasn’t responded well to romantic movies in the past.
Wiping away the beginnings of tears at the corners of his eyes, Castiel carefully changes back into his pink shirt and apron, setting aside the shirt and tie that Dean loaned him; then he grabs the things he’ll need to make the pizza crust. He remembers the sandwiches he made for the brothers Winchester before the attack on Roman Enterprises. Unfortunately, he also remembers spending a year in Purgatory, and Dean’s attempt to pull him out.
“And in case you forgot, you’re not one any more, Cas. Me and Sam can take care of this one.”
“‘Bout what?”
“I’m good,” he replies, sliding the plate onto the counter and grabbing a to-go cup for Dean’s coffee. “If you go now you might make it back before afternoon traffic gets bad.”
Dean leans his head on Castiel’s shoulder, away from the spray, and Castiel rests his head against Dean’s, catching his breath. He closes his eyes and devotes this moment to memory. However many nights they spend apart, he wants to have this always. The water is starting to cool, so they hurriedly soap and rinse, grinning at each other the whole time.
One hand still holding onto Dean's, Cas uses the other to hold Dean's chin, turning him to face his expression of… wonder? Hope? Happiness? It's hard to tell, because Cas starts kissing him.
“No buts, Sam. You weren’t there. He…” Dean swallowed, his next words barely above a whisper. “He told me he loved me.”
“Dean, how are you feeling?”
“Uh, did I upset you?”
They both order burgers, Dean a big double bacon and cheese monstrosity with onions, and Castiel the one with avocado. Dean gives him a look when he does, but it’s good to try new things. While waiting for their food, it seems there’s not much to talk about that they can say in public surrounded by people, so Castiel leans back in his seat and tries to not look at Dean.
Of course Dean wants pie. Luckily, they have a couple seasonal varieties. Dean settles on the mixed berry, with a large black drip coffee. He also keeps trying to catch Castiel’s eye, which Castiel is trying to avoid by hiding behind the fringe of his increasingly itchy wig. He’s afraid of what Dean will see in him. Finally, Dean pays and goes to sit by the window, still watching Castiel as he eats.
Castiel is glad Dean is looking down at his wrist, because he can’t help the warm smile that pulls at his cheeks. The care Dean is using in his handling of Castiel’s injury makes him want to believe Dean cares. The blond wig catches his attention, and for a moment, he wonders what would have happened if he’d found a female vessel, like before. Would Dean have… No, he should stop that train of thought. His purpose had always been to protect the Winchesters, and any feelings of his own that might have developed are incidental.
Jolene places a hand on his wrist. “You don’t have to tell me, but I’m here to listen and help if you feel like you can.”
“We hold a rooftop celebration every year, with food and a view of the city’s fireworks on the fourth. I was just curious if you would be interested in attending.”
He has to honor his brother’s wishes, but he can’t just give up on everything they’ve created. Sam is determined to find a way to both follow his brother’s wishes and continue his legacy.
curse you.”
Their investigation reveals a lot of people that don’t know what’s going on, and even more rumor. Nobody can agree even on the color of the bear. They’re filling up at a small gas station when they get their first real lead. The owner can be heard in the back room complaining about dumpster diving, and they use the forest ranger ploy to get a peek at the security footage.
Dean’s drinking his morning coffee, watching the news report about Russian troops in the arctic, and the president’s ineffectual demands for them to withdraw. If this keeps up, they’re going to tighten down on border patrol, making their lives difficult. Meanwhile, they’re dealing with the cleanup of severe storms all over the midwest, and Dean thinks to check on their friends in Kansas, as well as Jody in Sioux Falls. After his coffee, he starts fixing breakfast for him and Cas. Emma’s coming back today from a delivery, so he’s gotta get grumpy out of bed himself.
When Castiel sees the news about the massive slaughter at a bar in Wyoming, he hasn’t seen Dean in over two months, almost three. The shirt he’d borrowed has stopped smelling like Dean for some time, and they no longer message each other daily. Their phone calls are even more infrequent. Castiel messages Dean, asking if he’s heard about the incident in Wyoming, which is obviously angels, and if he’s free, to call.
“What? It’s not like they can take me to court. I’m officially dead, remember?”
A brief interlude of Sam's life After, given proper resolution, before we join Dean in Heaven.
Once he’s wiped down and washed up, Dean turns to see Cas pulling up boxers over a delectable, round ass he hopes to explore some day in the not-too-far-off future. He catches Cas’s attention when he starts to pull his jeans back on.
Sam’s shoulders slumped and Dean knew he’d won.
Sam nods and picks up the knife as Dean beelines for the kitchen. He makes it as far as the steel prep table before he folds in on himself, gasping for air and control. He can’t afford to start crying again, not when Sam will give him that pitying look of his. Dean still hasn’t told Sam exactly what happened back in the archive room. It’s still too raw. After a few deep breaths, Dean has his shit together enough to grab a couple of beers and head back to the library.
Some of the Alternate World's hunters come back, claiming that they had trouble integrating to this new world, so they find unoccupied rooms, help keep the place running.
Castiel rarely, if ever, sleeps in. Even on days off, he always wakes up in the early morning, his body having adjusted to the store’s hours. As such, it catches him by surprise when he wakes up a little after 10 a.m.
Castiel digs into his pocket for the few bills he brought with him to cover dinner. Dean wouldn’t let him buy the brace, but he’ll insist on paying for the meal. But as soon as he looks up, Dean’s already headed for the cash register, ticket in hand. He rushes to catch up, and tries to hand Dean some money. “I can pay for this.”
Listen, I decided I was not going to try to get Gadreel to speak in pentameter, because I kind of suck at that.
Emma was a deviant before they even had a name for it. Apparently her previous owners had sold her to recyclers after she’d started having errors, and she’d fallen off the back of a truck. Lucky for her. Most of the time, ST200’s were torn apart for scrap, drained and dumped. After she’d been repaired, she explained that like most of the “classic” ST200’s, she had been called Chloe. But Cas had asked her if she wanted to keep that name, and she said no. She looked so young sitting there with her hair down around her shoulders, and Dean couldn’t help but remember back to 2012, when he’d almost had a daughter. The blonde hair and big eyes, it was such a strong moment of deja-vu, he’d asked her how she felt about the name Emma.
“Not particularly,” is what Castiel says, but it does seem to ease his mind a little. Strange how that works.
Unsure where else to go, Castiel directs him to the private parking spot at the back of the cafe. When Dean pulls up behind the building, he asks, “Wait, but isn’t it closed now?”
Vehicle sales and thrift stores, strips of small shops, liquor stores. Homes line up next to businesses here. The further south he travels, Castiel notices the change in the sidewalks, the age of the trees. He’s getting closer to what is labeled as “downtown.” At the corner of Fourth and Sherman is a red brick establishment with a green awning called the Moose Lounge.
Dean wakes up again the next day, while Sam is working on something for another hunter on his laptop. Sam looks up to see his brother’s eyes are open, and closes the laptop, all his focus on Dean.
Castiel frowns down at the cup collecting espresso. “Several.”
Dean removes his sticky hand from Cas’s pants. “Zip up and join me back in my room?”
getting sent a picture of this one.”
Sam had stared at him in disbelief, having been there when it all went down. Cas looked on curiously, but he hadn’t witnessed watching someone go from baby to almost fully grown in two days. But Emma said she liked it, and was happy to be renamed. Ever since, she’d helped around the house, caring for two aging men, and Dean couldn’t help but think of her as family.
Making good time on the highways, since Dean refuses to use interstates when he can help it, they stop for dinner just south of Des Moines. There’s a Biggerson’s here, and even though they’ve had their share of incidents in the chain, at least the menu’s consistent.
When Dean asks Castiel if he needs to go to work, he can’t hold back a bitter laugh. Oh, he’s already used what little goodwill was left between he and Nora and has called to apologize as well as give Jody’s address for his last check. He will give it to Jody for expenses upon its arrival. He wonders where he’ll go when they decide he’s no longer needed here. Right now, nothing is more important than Dean’s health and safety, and he tells him so.
But I’m running behind.
After a quick glance around, Dean grabs the mail bundle he’d sorted himself and prepares to drop it off on what must be the secretary's desk; but in a moment of initiative, he decides to just take it straight into the office. Peeking in, he sees a dark head of hair hunched over papers scattering an enormous desk.
The question throws Castiel off balance, and he’d stumble if he weren’t leaning against the wall. “Dean, why are you still here? Is there something wrong?”
It seems a bit excessive to Castiel, but he sits down and accepts his coffee. Like Dean said, it’s not as good as what they make at the cafe, but it should wake him up. While he’s unwrapping his sandwich, Dean slides over a bottle of pills.
“For someone who claims to want to live, you cling to this fragile, weak form that can be extinguished so easily. By becoming human, you’ve already chosen to die.” Ephraim’s hand that isn’t holding him in place, raises to hover in front of Castiel’s forehead.
Halfway through his bowl of pasta, his phone rings. It’s Dean. He quickly swallows his mouthful, and answers. “Dean? Are you alright?”
With a binder of office layouts propped up in front of him, Dean arrives at the huge wing of office space that includes the CEO’s office. He tries to not be intimidated as he navigates through rows of cubicles with his mail cart. Reaching an open but empty desk that sits in front of a glass wall with drawn blinds, Dean sees a plaque next to an open door announcing the office of Castiel Novak himself. Looking down at his jeans, he straightens his tie. He can do this.
He bites down on an exposed bit of Trapezius, and the "Dean!" that Cas lets out has him grinding his erection against that perfect ass. Hands wandering, he maps out chest, collarbone, abs, skims the waistband of the jeans that fit snugly, jeans that Dean always needed a belt for with his slim build. But Cas is built with thicker muscle, and his hands can't stop exploring.
The car grows quiet, the sound of his heartbeat still pulsing in his ears. The people processing the crime scene can be seen milling about outside.
“No.”
Then, after almost over-exerting himself dragging a file box off of a high shelf in the Archive, (at least they’d closed the secret door to the dungeon, he couldn’t stand to look in that room after…) he found it. Something that they might be able to use to get Cas out of the Empty. Now he just had to convince Sam.
“Yeah, okay. I’ll talk to you later. Love you guys.”
Sam lets out a distressed huff, and Dean starts drinking, hoping to drown out his own thoughts. Jack only brought back those who were snapped by Chuck. So many others have died, but Jack at least did that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, Dean.” A spike of pettiness flares through him. “Although it would have been better if I could have had some stability while learning to be more human.”
“Do you mean harm to me or mine, the property, or our customers?”
That makes Dean break into a grin. “Deal.”
Dean rolls his eyes and says Cas is NOT allowed to binge a whole season tonight.
“Oh, yeah. Right. Sorry.” Dean’s mood deflates.
Accepting the money, Castiel steps back out the door and finds the vending machines. He purchases a root beer for Dean, and a Sprite for himself. The snack vending machine is well stocked, and Castiel gets Dean’s microwave popcorn, a bag of pork rinds, and a package of licorice. Dean likes licorice. Back in the room, the air conditioner is chugging, and Dean is already propped up against the headboard on one side of the bed, bottle of whiskey on the side table next to two glasses. He waves the remote at Castiel as he carefully places the drinks and snacks on the comforter.
“Umm,” Castiel looks at the pastries and desserts in the glass display case, feeling a slight pang at the sight of pies. On the wall behind the counter is a board with various drinks and prices. They are all much more than he planned on spending.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice breaks him out of his thoughts. “What’s wrong?”
Dean goes on to talk about when they were kids, growing up, Sam’s fight with Dad, and when Dean came for him at Stanford. Why is Dean wasting time talking when Sam can be getting help? In his mind he prays fervently for Jack, even though he’s supposed to be hands-off. He HAS to try.
Perhaps he is, ready to bolt out of this town and not look back, in fear that he’ll see his family chasing him. “I apologize, this is the first time something like that has ever happened.”
“Good, I’ll make arrangements then,” Cas says, looking back down at his hands with a small smile.
”Urgh. You stink.” Dean looks down at himself. “I probably do, too. Let’s find you something to eat and then we both deserve showers, huh?”
“Steve, where have you been sleeping up until now?”
Wrapping up some leftover gauze, Dean asks, “We need a pharmacy that will carry braces, and I think we both need to eat. This,” he waves his hand at the kitchen which still needs to be cleaned, “Can be taken care of after we’re fed, and you have something supporting your wrist.”
When Gadreel fades back into Sam’s subconscious, the man stumbles a little. “Wow, okay. I guess you guys weren’t kidding that Gadreel’s the only thing keeping me upright.”
He knows she’s concerned, and is going to use this as an excuse to pry. “Sure, I’ll meet you there.”
But Dean as he is now… He doesn’t know Castiel, or the things he’s done. For this Dean to consider him family… It feels like a lie. This Dean had reached out to him, fingers outstretched, and Castiel had nearly given onto the urge to grasp his hand, settling instead for his wrist. The Dean he knows would never reach out for simple physical comfort that way.
Dean continues. “I know it’s been hard, but you’ve done well on your own, adapting. I’m proud.”
“You mean
That makes Cas smile, and he looks at his hands in his lap. “Less dumb, less ass.”
Later in the day they get the news that the military is deactivating all of their androids, right on top of video of androids marching down a street in Detroit, the leader seemingly pulling androids from the sidewalks to join them. Detroit is under martial law, and androids are being ordered to be turned over to authorities. They have one of the farm foremen send a message to all the androids currently on the grounds to go to the storm cellars and hide quietly. They’re going to have to ride out the storm.
A blush heats Castiel’s cheeks and he looks away, but Dean doesn’t relent. “I mean it, man. You never smiled that much as an angel, and I used to think you hated getting stuck with us… with me.”
“Hey, I told you nonfat.”
Castiel Novak, CEO of Novak Enterprises, surveys the new interns lined up before him: Young men and women, eager to prove themselves in the tech business world. Most are dressed smartly in pressed slacks, jackets, straight skirts. Some are obviously making do with what they have in ill-fitting and cheap or second-hand slacks and button-ups. And then there’s the young man trying to hide on the end.
As he turns the radio off, he hears the sound of the back door. Ah, speaking of. He goes to the refrigerator in search of toppings for their pizza. The kitchen door opens, and Castiel grabs a bag of shredded cheese.
Their food arrives, and they halt conversation in order to eat. Dean was right, his appetite returns when he actually has food in front of him. Soon, his burger is finished, and all that’s left on his plate are some bread crumbs, meat juice drippings, and a couple soggy fries. Dean leans back in his seat, adjusting the waistband of his pants. “That was awesome. How about some pie?”
“Where they have a horse ranch. Anyway, I told them about you, and I think it would be a great place for you to finish recuperating.”
“Drink it.”
For a moment, Dean pictures the look on Cas’ face when he left the guy behind in Rexford. The two memories try to transpose over top of each other, and Dean is
Dean’s arousal presses against his own length, and Castiel shudders, his eyes fluttering closed as their foreheads touch. “Too much?” asks Dean, loosening his grip.
Reaching for the remote, Dean slides his hand out from Cas's. "We can watch something else—"
Castiel’s footsteps steady as they near the water, the fresh air and early evening sunlight helping to clear up his sluggish brain. He shows Dean the sign for the upcoming park renovation. They go down to the marina, watch a boat get pulled out of the water, and turn around at the beach because there are too many people.
“Yeah.”
“No.”
The evening news is interrupted by a press conference from the president, reiterating what Dean and Cas already know about the country being under lockdown. Cas’ hand tightens around Dean’s when President Warren says that all androids are to be destroyed. A spike of worry for Emma pierces through Dean, and he wonders if he’ll ever see her again.
Hands out in supplication, the angel in Sam’s body says, “No! I… I was going to try to heal him…”
“I knew we should have never named her Emma,” comes Sam’s voice, his face looking strained.
Nodding, Castiel dials Meg’s extension on the conference phone and asks her to find someone to finish Dean’s deliveries.
And that is how Castiel gets his first official paying job.
“Nah, I was gonna wait until after breakfast.”
Maybe he can manage to take the train down to Lawrence this weekend? During one of his many lulls, Dean checks the schedule. It’s about a nine hour trip, and if he manages to get off work early, he could make it home in time to pass out late and spend the weekend with family and friends. Sammy will be home from Stanford, it will be great. Except he’ll have to head back Monday morning. Which means no fireworks, unless he wants to call in sick the day after a holiday. Yeah, no. He’s already got a mark for his wardrobe, he doesn’t need another.
Castiel has felt fear before. But his reaction at those words is unlike anything he has yet to experience. He’s immediately awash with cold and his scalp tingles.
There’s a moment of panic, when he thinks another angel has found him. Jolene takes a peek out the door, and turns around with a grin. “It’s your
“Okay, Dean, I’ll see you in the morning.”
Riding in Dean’s car feels different now, and Castiel sits primly in the passenger seat, hands on his thighs. Dean keeps glancing at him as they head to the north part of town. At a red light Dean finally turns to face him. “Dude, are you gonna wear the wig to a crime scene?”
“I’ve done all I can, but there is something wrong, something I cannot repair,” Gadreel says.
After they’ve tidied everything, Dean rocks back on his heels, hands in his pockets. Should he just go? Wait to be dismissed? Should he ask if his boss wants to grab a drink or…
Dean smiles at him. “I’ll keep the bed warm for you.”
“That may be true, but it doesn’t change the fact that I want this, that I
Smiling at Dean’s odd behavior, Castiel thanks him and watches as he fumbles with the doorknob and backs out the door, saying he’ll be right back. It’s not often he sees Dean flustered. Now if he only knew why. Castiel stands, thinking now is a good a time as any for a shower, and it’s not until he’s in the bathroom that he finally realizes he’s only wearing his boxers.
They share a kiss, get situated on the bed, then proceed to talk about the movies they just watched, how to deal with Sam and Eileen in the morning, and just be in each other’s presence. It’s nice. Dean could do this forever. Cas is the one to fall asleep first, and Dean drifts off to the sound of his even breathing.
Wide-eyed and excited, Dean looks around at all the stainless steel. “You mean you can make something other than desserts and muffins?”
What? Why would Dean still be… Castiel swipes a hand over his hair and face, anxiety rising. He needs a shave, his wig is… Jolene tells him she’ll have Dean meet him around back. Castiel is not ready for this, wasn’t expecting it, and sends her a pleading look.
“Dean, I’m not coming back home.” Wait, what? “In a way I— I’m already there.”
“Was that meant to be some sort of metaphor?”
“Now go.” She pushes him towards the kitchen’s back door which is on the side of the building, and makes her way through the door leading to the cafe.
Out of the car, Dean notices the single folding chair has turned into two adirondacks. His eyebrows raise in admiration. “Is that so? Show me your moves then, Cas.”
“So… If I wanted one of those frou-frou drinks, what would you suggest?”
Working hard, Castiel’s days at the cafe are spent proving himself to be valuable, needed. Soon, he’s making drinks as well as Bernie, who’s been working behind the counter for over two years, and is Jolene’s cousin. He gets to know his co-workers. There’s another part-timer, a young man named Isaac, who isn’t the best at making coffee, but he attracts the girls in the afternoon. When Jolene realizes that Castiel will not judge her for refusing to adhere to the human culture surrounding gender roles, she warms up to him. But it’s not as if he can explain that having been an angel gives him a more fluid perspective of male and female, regardless of what sex one has been born with.
Castiel had actually gone fairly light today, only wearing some contouring highlighter and tinted lip balm. “Is there a problem with that?” he says, raising an eyebrow
“I, uh, hope I didn’t mess things up for work with you because of the wrist.”
“I—” Castiel chokes up and can’t finish, overcome with emotion. Thankfully, Jolene seems to understand.
They’ve cleared the living room for Sam’s bed, facing the mantel where he can gaze on his extended family, There’s a portrait of him, Dean, Mary and John, another of him, Eileen and their son, as well as photos of Jody and the girls, Garth and his family, as well as various other people whom have become close over the decades. There's one small photo of Castiel in a cowboy hat, the only one Sam could find of his friend.
There’s a lapse of time that Sam just can’t account for, but he comes to with his cell phone in hand, Dean on the ground and unconscious, bleeding onto the forest floor. Seeing his brother’s blood and his arm bent at an unnatural angle, Sam quickly dials for help. Outer shirt sacrificed into strips to stem the flow of blood and bind the broken arm, he waits for the nearest rescue team. They’re airlifted and taken to Mercy in Sioux City.
It helped me find closure with this fifteen year long story.
He nudges Dean awake in time to watch the android leader Markus give a speech to the throng of androids packed into Hart Plaza. Still afraid of what people might do to the androids hiding in the storm cellars, Cas sends them a message to hold tight and they would gauge the atmosphere in the morning. Then, Dean turns off the TV and drags Cas to bed.
“Dean? You awake?”
Castiel gets to his feet. “I really should try to—”
“Aww, c’mon. Don’t make me drink alone.”
She begins to explain more, but beeping noises emit from behind Dean’s room, and Sam pushes past the doctor and opens the door to find Dean trying to remove the IV from his arm. Immediately, Sam rushes in to try to calm Dean down.  “What are you doing? Dean, stop!”
Cas is shaking his head, but Dean keeps going. “Yeah, I know, Empty deal, happiness, whatever. The thing is, I…”
Holding his breath, Castiel is afraid to look. Is it possible that Dean’s back? That he didn’t leave? The bed dips, and a warm body sprawls across him. Dean lets out a satisfied hum, and Castiel breathes again. Or at least as much as he can with the weight of a fully grown Dean Winchester pressed against him, nuzzling the back of his head.
