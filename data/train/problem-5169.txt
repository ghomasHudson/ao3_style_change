Bruce shrugs lightly and nods a few times in acknowledgment of Tony’s words. And that’s it. Just like that. Tony knows what to do. He needs to give Steve a life. A normal one. One that isn’t a war.
Tony looks over his shoulder to check if Steve follows. He only arches his eyebrows in lieu of an unspoken apology but when Tony mouths, “We need to talk,” Steve frowns, and shakes his head shortly.
“No, consuming alcohol,” Steve corrects before looking swiftly at Tony with a sheepish expression. “I’ve never been drunk actually. Even before the serum.”
Pepper stays at the Quinjet’s front while she talks quietly with Fury. She's changed from her soft home clothes to sharp business attire while waiting for the jet to arrive. Her suit’s still black, but it speaks of power and ferocity with its simple yet defined lines. She looks like she’s also somehow travelled back in time and prepared for an office battle.
“Shit,” Steve says under his breath and turns to the bar again. He catches the bartender’s gaze and when she comes up to him, he says, “One club soda.”
“What? Not in a mood for Chilli?” Tony purses his lips as he pretends to consider other options. “I know a good place and—”
“So what? I wanted to check if I would still become the same man?” Tony snorts. “That’s idiotic. I must have known that’s impossible.”
“I’m completely shitting you,” Tony laughs. “But I must admit I like this new power that I have over you.”
So yeah, all this, whatever it is, apparently really belongs to him. With everything and with everyone. And he just needs to find a way to make it feel that way. Even with Pepper. Especially with Pepper and Morgan. But also, with Steve. Steve’s is important too. He can’t think of him as not a part of his life and Tony doesn’t care how it was before. So clearly that’s his job now. Tony
“That’s been one of the first things I checked,” Tony says in lieu of an explanation. “When I sent you to bed the first night, I really went downstairs to look over all these things that might vary from my timeline.”
Steve lays at his back, comfortably stretched along the whole length of the bed. He moves one hand from behind his head to run his fingers on Tony’s exposed shoulder before he lazily drops it again on the covers.
The girl tries to run but of course she’s unable to jump from the kitchen island that fast. Tony catches her in his arms and starts to tickle her. She screams and laughs, trying to wriggle her way out. Steve starts to record with his phone. And Tony feels how his heart bursts with happiness. Until a house alarm goes off.
“I don’t believe in that,” he finally speaks up. “And I won’t let you go until you really convince me that that is true.”
And Steve suddenly knows where this is going. He straightens and drops his hands with resignation. What is worse, Pepper's knowing that he knows. And she just looks up at him with these big, green eyes of hers that still shine with tears and sniffs for a good measure of looking completely miserable, and Steve realizes that he can’t say no.
“Good, great.” Tony shoves his hands into his jeans pockets and walks closer. “So, all my wishes are your command then?”
“I did! I swear! But—” He tries to move further away. “But this really attractive nurse asked me to sign her exceptionally well-     defined decolletage as Iron Man and it got me thinking. Besides, it’s better that I learned I’m a married man before I asked her for her num—hey!”
The layout is kind of similar. Kind of. A short hall quickly expands into a vast living area with a huge couch in the middle, but it faces the unlimited view of the ocean which now slowly swallows the sun. Its warm haze that changes from pink to orange lays its soft cast over the interiors; the never-ending shelves with books, modern yet cozy fireplace and a set of guitars display at the opposite wall.  There are a lot of trinkets and photos on the shelves that look more like Pepper would choose them than him. The velour couch seems to be well-loved. The fireplace is frequently used.
He had been able to hold himself together through all the realization of what had happened, the funeral and then the memorial that occurred just this morning. He even survived through the small wake right after it, chatting away even through the storm of his mind, tending to guests when Pepper couldn’t, taking care of everything and everyone just so he wouldn’t stop moving. He knew that if he stopped, he would end up like that - completely broken. That’s why he put on the bravest face he could and just bulldozed through the day until everyone left, an exhausted Morgan had been tucked in bed and Pepper announced that there was another message from Tony, just for Steve.
“We have to stop meeting like this,” Tony huffs out, resting his head on the headboard to look at Steve from under his half-closed eyelids.
He jerks his head up, meeting a steady and warm gaze. Maria crouches next to his seat, looking at him with so much worry that he can’t seem to recall he has ever seen something like that on her.
And then he realizes he’s fucked as hell because Steve beams at him. He beams. And the worst of it is that the man looks like he just won ten million in a lottery, and someone went down on him at the same time. And it’s just because Tony said yes.
“You weren’t only in the hospital though,” Tony points out. “You were already present when I called so whatever it was meant to happen or the whole thing was some strange, complicated clash of right coincidences, it led us up to his moment.”
And he guesses the turmoil must relate to the Blip — the thing that other Tony, Steve and the rest of the so-called Avengers did just a few days ago. It must have been their best idea to correct their past mistakes but now it looks like it didn’t come out exactly as planned or maybe it came out too well because Steve vibrates with almost physical pain as he looks at all the disarray they pass by. He must be thinking it’s all his fault. And for some stupid and irrational reason this peeves Tony plenty.
Tony leans on the door frame, observing Steve through narrowed eyes as he asks casually, “Is it safe to assume I won’t die from this thousand-mile stare?”
“You can always go back to it once you try to sleep for a bit,” Pepper tries for a bargain that sounds like one meant to convince a five-year-old.
“Where’s Pepper?” he asks, even more annoyed. “I’m sure we have at least one million things to discuss.”
Tony props Steve’s chin up, wiping traces of moisture with his thumb. “I can’t really say until I repay the favor.”
Well, Steve’s another story entirely. With Steve he really doesn’t know what to do, especially since the guy seems to be on a mission to give Tony his old life back. And Tony has a feeling that if Steve is so determined to achieve his goals, he’ll do absolutely anything to make that happen.
He feels how much Tony wants him and it makes him almost blind with satisfaction. The heat spreads along his body from where Tony’s hand clenches in his hair.  Because it feels good to be wanted so much. It feels new, precious and just right. It feels good to be Tony’s first choice. To be his only center of attention. To be
“Rhodey is coming?” Tony asks, suddenly livid. “Why didn’t you tell me that from the start? We need sake. A lot of it!”
Almost an hour later they are at the beach, unpacking their takeout from a nearby food truck with the best Chilli Con Carne on the West Coast (Tony’s words) and the party seems like a misty dream. They sit crossed legged on the sand. Their suit jackets and ties are forgotten next to them. Tony rolls his sleeves up enthusiastically as Steve opens one of the containers.
“Okay,” Tony says slowly, looking around to check if anyone else hears that. “I wouldn’t call that happy but— Wait, how do you know that?”
hasn’t seen Steve being this angry before. Not even with Senator Johnson. So this? This is bad. And to think that he held and finally kissed the man not even half an hour ago? Fuck, only he can screw things up this bad.
“It must have been enough for him to want to kill you,” Steve says dryly. “He also kidnapped Pepper and—”
Tony stops and tries to find leverage. He leans against the tree. The suit still envelopes his body, and slowly it starts to feel like a cage. But at the same time, he’s afraid to take it off. The suit feels like the only barrier between him and the flow of fear and doubt that crashes against him in overpowering waves. He tries to think of one thing, one thing only. He tries to find an anchor. A moment. A place. A person?
him. They just want to genuinely spend time with him, check on how he’s doing and maybe help him to rediscover his past too. It’s nice. It’s also so different then all the galas, events and presentations he had pushed through in his former life. There, he had to be aware all the time, not knowing from which side the blow might come. Here he feels assured. He feels like he belongs. He’s safe with these people. And it really doesn’t matter that some of them are an animated racoon, a blue cyborg or an annoying spaceship captain that acts like a frat boy.
“Look,” he starts, bracing himself on the hospital bed. “I get why Pepper wants to keep this under wraps for now, as I also kind of happen to know what is good for the company and probably for the superhero business, but I don’t need a nanny to stay home and be quiet. I can read about what happened on my own. And!” He points a finger at Steve to stop him from interrupting. “Even if I need one, which I don’t, wouldn’t Rhodey be better?”
Steve, on the other hand, does move. He drops his gaze to take in everything that is Tony. He feels the scent of his body too. It radiates off of Tony with waves of heat. Traces of the strong, wooden aroma of Tony’s cologne. The smell of the ocean left on his skin with dried salt. Very faded fragrance of oil and grease and metal from wearing the suit the other day. It’s all similar but also completely new. It’s strange. It’s thrilling. And it’s his to take and want.
He sees Morgan seated at the kitchen island and Steve working at the stove while she tells him some elaborate story, gesticulating and modulating her voice. She takes a deep breath and doesn’t stop even when Tony comes closer.
“Checking,” she agrees, and only after a few seconds of a pause she throws, “Captain was in the mansion in April 2016 and he spent a few weeks here. Bood, you were here with him all this time but most of the footage from the security cameras is encrypted.”
“Oh yeah, cameras were everywhere in the Stark Tower,” Bruce reminisces, drinking his champagne in one go.
And then he’s suddenly gone when the message abruptly comes to an end. It reminds Steve painfully that it’s merely that and nothing more. And this time something breaks in Steve for good. This time he can’t control himself anymore, bending over the helmet to shut it tightly in his arms, bringing it close to his chest and to his wet cheeks. Another wave of crying overtakes his body and a howling sound leaves his lungs when he tries to take a breath.
He reaches for his food again, but he feels observed. And for a moment, Steve thinks that Tony won’t drop the subject but to Steve’s surprise, there is a strange and sudden silence on Tony’s side.
“Like we are finally doing what we’ve both wanted to do for a long time?” Tony smirks. “Jesus, Steve, what can be wrong with that?”
“My body adjusts to the environment faster,” Steve answers with a soft smile, finding his footing. “And I can endure more too.”
“It’s okay,” Tony says surprisingly calmly. “It’s okay, because I only know a normal life. Well, as normal as a playboy, billionaire, genius and philanthropist can really have, but still pretty down to earth compared to your standards, so I can teach you all about it.”
He’s near Steve in seconds. He encloses Steve’s face with his palm as he reaches for Steve’s waist with his free hand to shove them closer together. And he looks into Steve’s eyes, searching as he explains softly, “What I meant to say is that when I saw you in that hospital room a few weeks back, you seemed unreal but also like the biggest fucking chance I ever got from life. One that I could never hope to deserve.”
“That’s true, it’s been reduced,” Bruce provides, and Tony gasps, pretending to be indignant by this fact so Bruce follows with explanations, “Because the space is limited, and my lab had to fit together with your suits’ vault.”
“You too, Tony. You know that right?” She asks and when Tony doesn’t rush with an answer, she continues suddenly seriously, “You’ve got a third chance so don’t waste it only because you think you’ll hurt me. You won’t.”
“No,” Steve interrupts, swiftly opening his eyes. “You didn’t want to kill me. And it wasn’t exactly you. The helmet dented so it could have been any—”
She huffs, clearly annoyed. Steve sees as she holds her chin up. There might be tears in her eyes, but she does everything to hold them back.
“You’re wrong,” Pepper adds fast, suddenly smiling at him softly. “You know what to do. That’s why you came here. You just want to hear I’m going to be okay, which is true, because I’m more than okay.”
And then Tony moves his eyes up and freezes himself. Only his gaze slowly swipes from Steve’s face down his body and suddenly Steve remembers that his t-shirt is still in his hand. His bare skin instantly tingles when Tony scrutinizes him very carefully. And it’s not like Steve doesn’t know that look. Tony’s renowned for appreciating fine things. Steve knows how he looks; it mostly doesn’t matter to him, but he also knows how people react. How Tony reacted before. Tony’s never been immune to that either. But what startles Steve is the openness and shamelessness of that look. This is completely new and somehow disturbingly nice. And that thought scares him. He shouldn’t think of these looks in this way. In any way, really. He shouldn’t be a reason for their existence as well.
Tony had been banking on the doctors agreeing with him that Aurora was nowhere near healed enough to be flying to another continent only a month after surgery, so he was fuming when they agreed that her abdominal incision was healing nicely, likewise her bicep injury was fine and both her clavicle and scapular were well on the way to mended. Aurora had smirked at him when the doctors had given her the all clear to travel, providing she take it easy and use the painkillers prescribed to her as needed. He had only ground his teeth together, clenching his jaw in annoyance, but knowing that he had no choice but to agree to the trip. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust his daughter, or even Steve for that matter, it was that he knew she was a selfless person and even if she wasn’t up to the trip she would do anything for the people she loved and right now that meant flying to London to ensure Harry wasn’t blaming himself. Despite his objections, he drove the pair to the airport and hugged his daughter tightly on the tarmac before both she and Steve boarded the StarkJet.
“Healing, but I’ve actually been thinking about how I’d maybe like to do something to help the survivors,” she said, finally pulling back from the hug to look at Tony.
“No, she doesn’t. By the sounds of it, tonight was worse,” Sam noted. “Probably because Harry’s not here.”
At the end of her first week in LA, Aurora, Trevor and Matthew all took their turn in the recording booth to lay down the vocals for each track and then they decided to take the weekend off before returning Monday morning to film the music videos.
“Will you marry me?” he asked again, voice quiet and nervous, almost shy which was a term Rori had never used to describe the man she loved.
Steve's a dragon curled on the floor again in the morning, and Tony grudgingly lets his vibrantly blue friend outside later when Steve starts making whining noises at the door after breakfast, butting his head hopefully at the door.
One morning, Steve finds Tony curled up under his wing on the hut floor. Granted, there's a rug under them, but still. It's a hard floor, Tony can't be comfy. Tony shifts and huddles closer as the rush of cooler air hits him when Steve has lifted his wing. Or at least, Steve thinks that's why Tony is huddled close, but then there are noises, pained looks on Tony's face, and Steve quickly wraps his wing back tight around Tony.
But Tony's never seen anything like this guy. Man and beast. It makes Tony's spine tingle, to think of what could've made something like this blue beauty happen. Is it natural, or is the guy an experiment gone very wrong?
“You know all you have to do is say the word and we can stop.” The words were in his ear, calm and sure. Steve knew Tony wouldn't be the least bit mad if Steve put the kibosh on things. Disappointed, maybe, but not angry. Nor would he make Steve feel bad about it. That was something Steve knew from experience; there had been a couple of times where Steve's adventurous spirit had abandoned him in their forays at playing around, but they'd still found ways to salvage those evenings. Steve knew it would be the same tonight too and he loved Tony all the more for always reminding him that he had an out even if Steve knew he did.
"If I were going to be all...boring, StubbornButt wouldn't even begin to cover it. You're kind of in the Change-Wing class of dragons, so you're more of a... 'WingStar' if we're going for completely trite and pedantic," Tony says, pretending to find the subject dull and not at all something he's thought about for days on end. That scar from the crossbow bolt though, it really does look like a star. It's more visible from the underside, Tony thinks to himself. Not that he's been cataloguing Cap's or Steve's features.
And tackled Steve for as many kisses as he could get - without doing further injury his arm in the process.
As it was, he could feel a blush climbing up his cheeks as he wound his way through the crowd, knowing there would be dancing, mischievous eyes when he go there. It was like he couldn't see anyone else though, eyes only focused on finding Tony and the way the vibrations shifted with his gait.
"And if I go plummeting into the ocean because I can't hold my form?" Steve shouts back, pacing, vulnerably human.
How they'd gotten here...Steve only had himself to blame. Tony, he knew, loved the thrill of getting caught in public, and while Steve wasn't willing (so far) to have sex in public, he'd actually invited Tony to have some fun teasing him in public. The vibrator was that plan.
Tony looked like he wanted to eat Steve alive. Their mouths met in a kiss, needy then rough and Steve whimpered as Tony's hand got more serious, pulling along Steve's length, the outline of Steve's dick very clear now even through the denim.
, Steve thought, eyes closing and the hand on Tony's shoulder gripping tighter. He was ready to get off now.
Tony quirks a brow when Steve turns to look back at him in between some hopping around - frolicking, Tony's mind supplies. Tony's pretty sure the underside of Steve's wing turns faintly pink before Steve quits and tucks both wings tight to his body and takes some strong, high leaps away from the hut instead.
"You utter-- You could have died!" Steve is jabbing Tony hard in the chest now, just in the soft spot that makes him wince. "You could have fucking died, you jerk!" And that's when Steve finds his mouth on Tony's, hard and angry and so desperate he can't even think, he's shaking so badly.
But the fact that Steve's thought about it enough to have a firm stance on the saddle makes Tony beam in response instead of the fed up look Steve was expecting.
Tony rubs his forehead in exasperation as he drags Steve's solid mass of muscle back to his bed, but all-in-all, he feels pretty damn good about taming the wild Steve for just those few moments.
So Tony spends the next few days ignoring Steve's existence and coming up with a sort of tacky substance that'll help him grip Steve's scales. Well, Cap's hide. Tony prefers to think of dragon!Steve separate from sexy human Steve because, well, otherwise the space between his ears just gets complicated, and it's already complicated up there.
Handing the drink to Tony, he stood, wondering if he could even sit still while the thing vibrated away.
was flying! And he was going to do it on his own some day and he and Cap could fly anywhere they wanted--
Tony crosses his arms and quirks a brow. "I've been living with dragons, studying dragons over half my life, buddy. Not to mention been in a few scrapes myself. Injured stuff needs working out. C'mon, try it," Tony wheedles.
Steve had seemed keen about their first kiss, but things hadn't really... Well. Steve was a dragon, and maybe Tony was a little scared of the idea of being suddenly underneath a dragon. (Or on top of one.) While in a compromising, naked position.
Tony's seen his share of dragons in the village. Hell, he's met most of them, collecting data on them and their riders, starting to make what Tony calls a database.  Notes on what dragons are best for what, or which move the best for certain activities, what they like to eat or don't. Cross-referencing. All that jazz. He's pretty good with dragons most days; Hiccup has retired and his daughter, Pepper, is village head now, but nothing involving dragons has changed. They're integral to the village now.
Steve's arm took way too long to heal up in Tony's opinion. Dragon like him, it should heal in no time. Admittedly, it healed a whole lot faster than a normal human bone, and probably would've healed even faster if Steve had stayed in Cap form. But he hadn't. So Tony waited very impatiently to show Steve how much those words had meant to him.
. Above anything Tony wants that. He wants to fly. Under his own power, not just on a dragon's back.
Definitely gotta try finding a way to get Steve into bed before he shifts though. Tony isn't exactly used to carrying behemoths around every day.
"Hey." Tony scrambled over, hands running over Steve - but it was soon very obvious that Steve's arm was broken. "You gotta stop saving me, babe. I'm not worth it."
Cap seemed to anticipate and he was already curving right in a perfect slice downward. His wings tightened close to his body and Tony felt them fall faster, diving towards the cliff and his hut. "Slow! Slow! Slower, damnit!" Tony squawked as Cap swooped down over the roofline, lightning landing right behind them. Okay, so maybe Cap knew what he was doing.
Then Tony was up and off his lap, adjusting himself, which did make Steve grin a little in spite of his surprise at the sudden change of events.
The mere fact that they made it to the club and inside was some kind of miracle as far as Steve was concerned, though, and he banished Tony to a booth while he got drinks so he could get some control over himself. The dark club with its pounding beat and mass of bodies helped him feel more anonymous, less exposed, but frankly, he still had a few nerves and his head was full of Tony. Scent, feel, taste, the look of him in those jeans and the usual casual blazer-t-shirt combo... Yeah. He looked good and Steve pointedly ignored him while he waited at the bar.
A tug at his arm from Tony, though, said it wasn't time yet, and Steve gingerly settled next to him, arm sliding around Tony's shoulders. The heat of Tony against his side felt good, comforting and he tried to relax. Not an easy feat though and he knew Tony could feel him shifting from time to time next to him. God, he wanted Tony to touch him. Wanted Tony's hand down his jeans--
Steve's head dropped and he had to swallow hard around a please, aching to beg him to do just that. Let people watch, for fuck's sake! "Tony, shut up!" Steve groaned into Tony's neck, a warning that he really was close to falling apart. His balls were hitching up and he was aching to come. Groaning, Steve rubbed up against Tony, feeling this close to tugging down Tony's jeans and fucking him right there just like Tony had described.
"Always an answer for everything with you, isn't there?" Steve is near growling now, but he's stopped pacing to cross his arms defensively.
From the way he wakes up to Steve in the mornings, all dragon, Tony gets the feeling Steve is more comfortable as a dragon, but he also can't stick with it when he gets stressed or fearful. It makes Tony wonder why Steve sticks with the dragon when it's a form that's...kinda artificial if he has to...choose it.
“Never better,” Steve gritted out, not willing to show how Tony was getting to him just yet. He swallowed, watching the mass of people grind on the dance floor while the device in his ass continued to thrum. Steve was pretty sure he was already ready to be out there rubbing up against Tony, a strong arm around him.
It's these thoughts clouding his focus that leave him vulnerable to the aftershock explosion that causes a burst of paraphernalia to shoot from the hut - complete with a large metal bolt from a crossbow piercing clean through his wing.
"It's going to fucking work this time!" Tony yelled over the wind as he pulled his eye protection down over his face.
Tearing his eyes away from Steve's blue back, Tony looked around them, a bark of laughter jumping from his throat as they suddenly went through a cloud. They were flying.
Tony was breathing against Steve's mouth, and Steve was dizzy with how much he wanted Tony. “This is the hottest thing ever, Steve. All I can think about right now is how badly I want to swallow your dick and choke on it. Do you think you’d be able to be still and keep quiet if I were to do that?” Steve groaned, and latched onto Tony's mouth in another kiss, this time his hand digging tight into Tony's hair. There was no way he'd be quiet for that but he wanted it all the same. He was thrusting harder into Tony's palm - there would have been no doubt what they were doing if someone had glanced over into the dim light of their booth - and that was when Tony turned off the stimulation to his prostate.
Steve drummed his fingers while he waited for their drinks; ginger ale for Tony and an Old Fashioned for himself in the hopes the the alcohol would do something for a minute or two even if it was only to make his brain slow down a notch.
“I know.” Tony purred in his ear, his hands snug at Steve's hips as he turned Steve so he could see a hint of the dancing mass of bodies. Then, the evil bastard, he pressed up tight against Steve's ass and Steve had to bite down on yet another groan otherwise he was sure it would be fucking loud enough to call every single person's attention to him.
So needy, and wanting at least some kind of outlet, Steve tugged Tony onto his lap, hands squeezing Tony's ass. He kissed Tony, rough with need and silently begging him to shut the hell up or keep going. Steve was going to be done so fast if Tony kept talking though.
They'd spent...a surprisingly long time easing it in. Tony had toyed with him, made a mess with the lube all over his thighs, had even made him close his thighs tight around Tony's wrist practically fucking his thighs while Tony had tugged the vibrator in and out of Steve's ass.
Tony has a goofy smile on his face as he works, and Steve finds himself smiling too when he notices during one meal prep.
Mostly, it seems to amuse Steve that Tony has another name for him in his dragon form and has seemed to let it slide rather than getting up on his soapbox about dragon rights and whatnot. In fact, Tony's fairly sure it makes Steve smirk a little.
...Which became a whole lot harder when he felt Tony's fingers dart over the base of the vibrator again several times. It was a good thing he had let go of Tony's hand over his crotch, otherwise things would have been crushed that he very much did not want crushed.
After Tony all but wrestles Steve into his bed, he finally gets a chance to ask the guy his name, and Tony tucks the blankets in tight - threatening to sit on Steve if he has to - and makes him stay in bed the rest of the day - hovering, much to Steve's annoyance. Tony changes the dressing on his wound again that evening, giving Steve some willow bark to chew, but Steve tells him not to waste it. It will go through his system all too quickly, Steve knows, but doesn't know how to explain that to Tony. Steve just turns his face to the wall and grits his teeth, which seem to start to lengthen-- so Tony works quicker, unable to help the brief grip he gives the guy's wrist. It's meant to be reassuring, but Steve's eyes flash stubbornly and Tony takes that as his cue when he finishes to dive back into working on a little doohickey at his workbench instead of the hovering he wants to do.
"Eh, it wouldn't work a second time," Tony shrugs, dusting himself off, but Steve can see the way Tony's trembling.
And then Tony kind of understood why Steve hadn't pushed him, had been doing the cooking and cleaning with no comment.
Tony latched on like a little frog to Cap's scaly, tough, but all too smooth hide. The feel of it was actually really nice and it made Tony entertain other thoughts --- that he wasn't thinking right now.
“You do make such a lovely picture right now,” Tony told Steve, his eyes dancing and dangerous but just as aroused as Steve. “I’m tempted to have you be the one to fuck me when we get home while that vibrator rubs against your prostate continuously. How many times do you think you can come from that?”
Steve's arm feels on fire the few times he does wake, and there are scratchy, dry trails of tears on his cheeks as he lies there in Tony's bed the rest of that day and the next.
When Tony wakes from where he fell asleep at his singed workbench, he finds a sooty blue dragon curled up on the rug instead of a man in his bed.
Tony latches arms around Steve's neck and whoops as loud as injured goat. He's going to kill him, Steve's really going to kill him for that. And when Steve tumbles into a landing, Tony rolling off him as Steve somersaults into his human form, Steve stalks at Tony, looming, swearing with every step, his heart thumping out of control. "You- You- Don't you ever do that again, you complete jackass!"
Tony's careful as he tries to touch the injured wing, unable to resist the brilliant blue and seeing the crease of pain on the curled up dragon's face.
"You need to work that wing, Steve. It's never going to heal right if you don't," Tony calls to Steve!dragon. The dragon gives him a glare as if to say, 'how do you know?!'
Steve is very suspicious and uneasy as Tony inches back closer once the dust has settled. Steve hisses and scoots around the hut, staying low to the ground and just out of reach until Tony stands with hands on his hips as if he's going to give up, making Steve relax for a second - and then Tony jumps to tackle his scaly neck.
Steve pads around in a stubborn circle a few times before settling and then tentatively stretching his injured wing, moving very slowly until the wing is spread to its full span. Again, Tony can't help thinking
"Okay," Steve managed, a bit brokenly, so grateful when he had Tony suddenly in his arms and rubbing up against Steve as though he was just as desperate as Steve was. Steve's hands trailed over Tony's ass, dragging Tony tight against him so he knew that Tony could feel how damn hard Steve was too. God, the man had such a perfect ass, and it fit into Steve's hands so round and sweet--
Tony wasn't stopping there. He was ruthless when he really got going with the dirty narration in bed too, so Steve shouldn't have been surprised at how things continued.
"You're such a baby. Find a little elbow grease in those hulking muscles you have," Tony called off-hand from his workbench. He hadn't even been on Cap's back two minutes before he started having ideas on how to improve the sticky paste. He needed to think, not be bothered with how to get it off before he could even get it on. "You don't want me to fall off, do you, dragon boy? No? I thought not," Tony was absorbed in his slates with his ratios and he didn't hear the lumbering behind so the whump of a tail knocking him off his stool was a surprise. Yeah, definitely a surprise, he thought when he looked up into laughing blue dragon eyes and then got a slurp of Cap's tongue for his trouble.
“You’re doing so good,” Tony's teeth were on his ear, making Steve shiver. “So good for me, baby.” The praise did nothing to calm him either; in fact when Tony got to talking like that, Steve got to wanting to do
From then on, Tony insists that Steve help him in the kitchen. Steve is only too happy to oblige, even if he's so big and bulky that Tony seems to bump into him at every turn, eventually resulting in Steve banishing him to the work bench. But Steve welcomes him back to the kitchen each meal, suffering Tony's blunders and haphazard knife skills until he's fed up with him and chivvies him off to tinker each time.
Apparently, Tony could tell. The vibrator shifted in intensity and Steve jerked again, cock pushing into Tony's hand.
"Okay, go!" Tony shouted. It was a lot windier than he'd like, but they needed to do it now, because rains were coming, and they'd both be stuck inside for days once they did. Already the clouds were gathering and the wind moving faster.
"What, not StubbornButt?" Steve teases him over porridge. "Don't most Vikings go for the double word names?" Tony isn't exactly most Vikings, which is the only reason Steve's stuck around this long. Stark isn't even much of a Viking name. 'Dad thought Starkson sounded dumb. He preferred things be logical and to the point,' had been Tony's muted response when asked about his surname. Steve hadn't brought it up again.
"TONY!" Steve screams, racing out of the hut, not even thinking as he shifts to blue scales and a wingspan the size of a house. He shoots himself up into the air and then down in a hard dive, eyes searching for Tony's falling body as the air seems to rush past him twice as fast as it normally does. Catching sight of Tony's spread-eagled form, finally, Steve flaps faster, darting like an arrow for Tony and swooping under him, ocean brushing his belly.
As Cap took off, body coiling and then releasing in a burst of energy with the launch, Tony steeled himself to be thrown off. Cap was fucking majestic whenever he launched himself into flight, and Tony was almost sorry he wasn't able to watch it right now. But feeling the bunch and coil of Cap's dragon muscles, the hard strength, the fluid motion under his hands was pretty incredible.
The two of them had been fairly quiet on the drive to the club. Steve had kept a hand on Tony's thigh, feeling the vibrations of the car running through his solid muscle. The shift of gears, Tony's confident stroke on the gear shift, had kept Steve distracted from the vibrator currently penetrating him.
The silent car ride was meant to help him dial it back. Soothe him so he could make it through the rest of the dare. It was soothing.... Steve's cock wasn't currently making Mount Everest of the front of his jeans, but still. He was definitely still very aware, very in tune, and Tony hadn't even turned on the vibrator yet.
As much as Tony doesn't care about being a dragon rider, if Steve will let him? He's all over that like sparks on an eel.
Tony is dazed when he's freed from the cocoon of cobalt blue wings, staggering away with surprise and shock lining his face. And then laughing over the experiment that caused the fireball in the first place.
Shoulders slumped, Steve sidles to the door, just to keep an eye on Tony. Asshole, he thinks to himself as he watches Tony. It's his damn wing and he'll test it when he's good and--
“I bet I could sit in your lap and fuck myself on your cock right now while all these people danced.”
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve growled. “I’m so hard right now!” Steve Rogers was not whining, he was not. Tony Stark was just evil. Evil, Steve thought, while ready to drop to his knees just so he could beg Tony to let him get off.
Tony makes dinner that night - it's nearly inedible most nights he cooks, but that's not something he normally pays much attention too. That night, though, Steve had deigned to show up to the table in his dashingly handsome human form so, feeling unusually self-conscious, Tony had decided he really ought to cook them an actual meal. He tries like Valhalla not to burn anything, but he suspects he fucks it up anyway, what with the small grimace that crosses Steve's face before he gives Tony a polite smile and tells him it's great.
"You'd have figured it out eventually. You lasted this long," Steve said, wiping his mouth and picking up the homespun dishes to wash them at the pump outside. Tony was pretty proud of that pump. There wasn't a well on this end of the island, but all he'd had to do was dig down through the rock to the ocean and make a little suction, and voila. Well, okay, it had taken him about a year and a half, but hey, now he had water without having to go into town. It was worth it. The pulley system he'd made originally still worked too. Just pull up a new bucket on the rope of buckets, which Steve could do, no problem.
There was a roar and a sudden change in pressure, and he felt that smooth-rough, sweet leathery feeling of Steve's wings around him, engulfing him as they hit  the ground, Cap tumbling the whole way to the rock face, the back edge of Tony's land. A loud crack announced their landing and the soft, pained groan of human as Steve was suddenly pale and fragile next to Tony.
Steve drops like a rock, spinning, his dragon form unraveling as he can no longer keep control of the shift, and he hits the ground with a loud crunch to his very human shoulder.
"Tony, that stuff so does not wash off." Steve had transformed and was trying to pull on regular clothing after testing out Tony's hand tack.
"Uh. Thanks, Steve," Tony said cautiously, once he'd rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and had some warm mead. "For, you know, not letting me starve to death." Honestly, he hadn't even noticed stopping for eating. Steve told him it was easy enough to coax him away if Steve let him carry what he was working on to the dinner table like a toddler with a favorite doll.
“It’s not the same,” Tony reacts fast but he takes away his finger and steps back as he proposes, “You had a choice.”
“Sure thing, darling,” Tony agrees easily but then he stops to think as he glances over at Steve. “In what? Twenty years? Twenty-five?”
“Maguna, go to the basement and stay there with FRIDAY,” he orders softly but decisively as he puts Morgan down.
“Hey, you were the one who put cameras in places where people could still embarrass themselves,” Rhodey says defensively. “Like, let’s say hypothetically, singing in a kitchen while making coffee.”
He reaches for the belt buckle but Tony’s faster. He covers Steve’s fingers with his own, stopping him.
He sits at the edge of the armchair and rests his arms on his knees, tangling his fingers into his perfectly sculpted hair to mess it up. And he yawns. God, Steve’s adorable. Huge, shredded, and completely adorable. And it’s enough for Tony’s thoughts to sidetrack for a moment but then he remembers the circumstances that brought them together, and he can’t stop this train of thought, so he decides to talk instead.
And then he fully wakes up and takes a good look at still sleeping Steve. Captain Rogers. Freaking Captain America. The person about whom his father had never shut up. A man that had been present in Tony’s life since practically forever. And Steve’s been a tale of old days’ glory. He’s been an example of the highest form of bravery and sacrifice. And above all, he’s been an unsurpassed ideal, chasing Tony’s life choices to mock them.
Just like then, Tony’s afraid. He’s afraid that he isn’t good enough. He’s afraid that he might fail. God, he thinks he already did fail. He’s convinced that he won’t be able to cope with everything he suddenly received, with all the expectations, roles and duties. And Steve realizes where he made a mistake and what he should do.
Tony taps Steve’s arms with agreement but his warm hands lingers when he says, “Strong plan. It’s great strategic thinking.”
And to his surprise, Steve does smile, but there is something else behind that gesture. His eyes change. Tony can swear that for a moment he sees there a shadow of hurt or pain. Steve’s suddenly restless. He moves more to the armchair’s edge and rests his hands on the footrest in front of him, closing them into fists.
“I couldn’t let him go on convincing everyone that a modern version of a concentration camp is the best solution for our situation,” Steve says, feeling how his insides are buzzing only at the memory of that evening. “I lived through that, so thanks, but no, thanks.”
“You are but from a different time,” Pepper whispers and holds his hands tightly and she adds, “And this is also something that I have to deal with myself. That’s why I’m upset. I’m angry that I can’t feel the same things with this version of you that I felt before.”
In this light, the space looks even homier and sheltered. It’s clear that it’s a family home with a kid running around freely. And it feels almost like an insult to his suddenly lost bachelor’s life.
I'm so nervous to post this chapter... It's been the most difficult to write, but I really REALLY wanted to do this perfectly. So now I'm here, hopping you will forgive me if I did something not not right!
She props her hip at the edge of a nearby table, wrapping herself thither into her sweater as she asks surpassingly calmly, “Tony, what are you doing here?”
“Geez, don’t say it: I’m a dick in every version?” Tony lets out a heavy exhale and rubs his neck, coming into the office. “Listen, I feel like I need to explain a few things.”
“All the talk about being embarrassed in public where cameras can catch the said act gave me an idea,” Tony clarifies fast. “Steve, the doctor said that someone found me naked on the runway for private planes, right?”
“I went downstairs, and I just really wanted to see what’s been cooked there for the last few years. And then I started reading about you because I like to know with whom I’m going to share a house with, and then I moved on to the Avengers and everything else—” he cuts himself off and shakes his head with disbelief. As he looks to the side to observe the serene view outside, he continues, quieter, “It all feels so foreign.”
“A—a—ah,” Tony says before she’s able to finish and takes his hand away. “I’ll stop you right there.”
“Tony?” Steve asks, barely audible, but of course the system in the helmet is excellent, picking up and transferring his question.
“Yep, yeah,” Tony agrees but he already starts to play with the phone, waving to Captain almost unconsciously as he says louder, “FRIDAY, lead me to the playground.”
Tony snorts, shaking his head, and moves to the waterline with purposeful strides. Steve swiftly stands up. He’s always taken aback by how quickly Tony can move and think when he puts his brain to it. Sometimes he wonders if Howard injected his son with a few drops of the serum because what Steve can see is how Tony quickly runs against the waves to dive into them in one, smooth motion.
Tony huffs out a long breath. This wasn’t the plan. The plan was to pull Bruce into confessing what’s poisoning his mind. So, Tony needs to try again. He stands up and goes around Bruce to get his own spoon. He goes through the drawer and then dives in the freezer to get his favorite flavor that proudly bears his name. Only then he slowly walks back to the bar.
“For Christ’s sake,” Tony murmurs and also pulls out a holographic keyboard. “I couldn’t make this more difficult.”
“Well, it wouldn’t work because the time would just branch out but you might not have known this so, why didn't you do it?” Tony asks quietly.
Steve huffs a shuddered breath, before he says, “You know what? Let’s leave it at that. Let’s just forget about this conversation.”
“Oh, trust me, you really do right now. You probably know when Steve was here last time,” Tony starts, propping himself on the bed’s headboard. He makes a swiping gesture in the air and a holoscreen appears in front of him.
, Tony thinks as he hightails it back across the room to wait it out behind a rough chair until the dragon settles.
“I’ve got this under control, Stark. Don’t worry about me.” It was said with an ease that came from the two of them knowing each other so well for so long.
When the bartender got to him, there was a definite moment where Steve thought he was going to get hit on, but quelled it by adding 'for my boyfriend' to his order. He didn't need or want a bunch of people trailing after him and hopefully he'd said it loud enough that others heard too. He wanted to play with Tony tonight, not feel self-conscious. Even more self-conscious, he amended in his head.
Tony's hand suddenly palming the front of his jeans brought him quickly back from his thoughts and he lurched, pushing into the touch with a sharp hitch of breath. God, yes, that was what he wanted. The vibrator had melted into the background for a few moments there but now that he was shifting into Tony's hand, the plug shifted too and he wanted to moan long and hard. Steve's hand gripped the bench seat under him roughly instead, but he could feel it the wood fibers getting crushed together the more seconds that ticked by.
Yes, yes, he wanted that. Steve's head dropped back to hit Tony's strong shoulder and he whimpered, unable to even form the word yes for several seconds. His body was on high alert and he would easily do anything Tony asked just then. “God, yes,” he hissed, placing a hand over the one Tony has on his clothed cock and pressing it even harder against his stiff prick. “Please,” he begged, aching for release.
“We’ll be dancing out there, pressed so close to each other while the plug pounds against your prostate. No one will even know that you’re being fucked while we’re surrounded. No one will pay attention to the way you’re going to hump my leg until you’re coming in your pants and gasping desperately. They won’t know that you’re going to end up coming more than once and that you’re going to be such a good boy the entire time. Does that sound good to you?”
“You don’t have to babysit me if you prefer to be out there helping,” Tony finally says, not able to resist the urge when Steve scowls at yet another van that looks apocalypse ready.
“Well, forcing me into a relationship that will make two or even three people miserable isn’t going to do any good to either of us,” Tony wonders out loud.
Tony’s basically in Captain's space now. He rests his hip against the couch, just next to Steve’s hand. The man is taller than him, but right now, as he leans against the furniture they are almost at the same level. And Tony can see that Steve’s eyes are not fully blue. No. They have a touch of green in them that warms the gaze even if their owner looks suddenly wary.
His eyes are a cause of concern now. He strokes Steve’s cheek with the back of his fingers, swallowing hard.
Pepper closes her mouth and opens it again, wanting to say something, but like Steve, she is unable to comprehend what’s happening.
So sorry for being a tad bit lat but I've been traveling. The good news is that you will get ch4 earlier :D
And this is what Steve tells himself repeatedly when they land on the UCLA Medical Center’s helipad, and when they cross the chaotic hospital’s halls to reach the unit where they’re keeping Tony.
And Tony’s a good kisser. Of course, he is. He’s always been. Because when he kisses, he gives all his attention to this. He gives all, everything of him, to Steve. It was like that for the first time too. Back then and all the other times. But the hesitation of their first kiss from before is completely gone. Instead, it’s replaced by the new boldness that makes the whole experience overwhelming but also so damn blissful.
He’s probably right, because when Tony steps through the doorway, he’s welcomed by an incredibly loud and enthusiastic cheer. Thor didn’t overstate when he said they came in large numbers. There are a lot of faces around him. Faces that Tony recognizes and knows from all the materials FRIDAY and Steve provided. Still, it’s strange to finally meet them. And even stranger to meet them like that. Because suddenly he is embraced, hugged and patted with pride, congratulations and expressions of astonishments over things that he presumably did. And at that moment, it doesn’t really bother him that it wasn’t really him. He doesn’t think about it because he feels so much more. He feels dizzy and overwhelmed but also happy and fulfilled. And this scares him, but it also warms him from inside, so the fear is quickly replaced by something else. The panic is gone in seconds. The uncertainty and resistance are gone too. All that is far and forgotten especially when there is a young man, Peter, glued to his side with his face pressed into Tony’s shirt to hide his tears.
Knowing himself, there isn’t a chance to guess the password. Besides, he probably also created some safeguards against people who would try to find out the right one. And this password could be anything and nothing at all, so he doesn’t want to risk and lose the footage forever. Instead, he starts to break the code from the inside because that’s fairly simple. After all, he wrote it himself quite a while ago and he already knows he didn’t change it much. He works fast and after a few minutes, the file is open.
He closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose, taking another deep breath. He barely remembers what it means to have a headache, but he feels like he might be getting one now. Especially that even if he isn’t ready to face Tony, he hears a subtle knock and when he holds his head up, he sees the man himself in the doorway.
He squeezes his fingers tighter around Steve’s, trying to convince the man to look up but Steve’s completely lost. So, he says a quiet “fuck it” under his breath and softly takes Steve’s face into his hands, forcing him to look up. And now he sees it – Steve is holding his tears back with the last bits of his dignity but he’s shaking from all the emotions he’s keeping inside. And that’s it for Tony. He can only bear so much of Steve’s pain. So, he moves further. His hands push into Steve’s hair, bringing him closer.
There is one thing they all agree on though. Morgan is this active because she’s testing the terrain. She checks what she can do and how much her kind-of-new-but-old daddy is going to allow her or how much she can extort from her uncle who still tries really hard to not feel guilty about the whole situation. And so, she goes to bed late and she wakes them up early. It’s hard for her to focus on school and homework because of course, all she wants is to just have fun and eat popsicles. And Tony loves it. He really does. He didn’t suspect that he’s going to like having a kid so much. Judging from the life he had just a few months ago, he never thought that he was going to feel this lucky in this kind of situation. Yet again it all feels like he works on muscle memory, because he clearly knows all these feelings. From the moment he met Morgan he knew that she was the most precious thing to him and that he needed to protect her at all costs. Like suddenly some forgotten update in his brain finally installed. He still doesn’t remember. It’s impossible to remember a life that he didn’t have but he
“Just looks a lot worse than I thought it would,” Rori replied. “And they’re gonna slice into me again and again and it’s just going to look worse each time.”
“A likely story,” Tony laughed. “So, what’s the next one?” he asked, turning his attention away from Harry and back to his daughter.
“You don’t have to apologize,” Harry replied. “I shouldn’t have sprung that on you love, not after everything that’s happened. I’m the one that should be sorry. Forget I said anything.”
“Like hell you are,” Tony replied, his head jerking up suddenly to stare at his daughter. Steve remained silent but prepared to play his usual role of peacekeeper between the two of them.
“I take it you surprised Harry by flying in a week early?” Anne asked once she turned away from her task. “I’m sure he was thrilled.”
Letterman turned away from the camera as the director called cut and the crew busied themselves around the set. “That was great,” he told the young woman. “The team will edit it together and we’ll send you the final cut before we air it next week.”
The show opened not long after the girls took their seats and within a few minutes the judges were introduced and Aurora and Ella were standing up in their seats, cheering along with the rest of the crowd, whistling and hollering extra loud at Nick’s introduction.
At first, she couldn’t speak, still gasping for breath as she shook her head no, trying to answer her fathers panicked questions until slowly her hysteria died down enough for her to stammer out an explanation.
“Yes, Hi,” she replied, reaching her hand out to shake the one offered to her by the tall brunette standing in front of her. “It’s great to finally meet you, Matt. Thanks for having me.”
He stretches his leg and tries to poke Steve in the shin. He nearly succeeds but stops at the last moment to keep himself from falling off the bed. Still, the movement and the noise are enough. The man abruptly wakes up, sitting straight on the chair. He looks at Tony, startled. It’s almost adorable. Almost, because Tony's irritated so he isn’t going to admit that.
“That’s not even half of it, right?” He moves the finger between them, announcing, “You and me? We are married. How about
discovered that I’ve returned from the dead, Jesus-style,” Tony insists. “So can you give me at least a day to adjust?”
Normally, if they were back in Tony’s time, this ten-plus years ago, Tony would be perfectly happy to be cooped up at his house with Captain America whose mission in life is to make him feel better. But now? It doesn’t feel like a pleasant experience.
And as an indication of his words, he opens the buckle. He doesn’t let his gaze leave Tony’s eyes even for a second. They are dark now. Steve can see the burning desire in them. The need. The overpowering urges. And he can’t believe that someone can feel like that about him. He can’t believe that he belongs.
“What can I give you?” he finally says very quietly, closing his eyes as he continues, “I’m broken and exhausted. And I’ve known only this life. This fight. It’s all I’ve ever had. I don’t know how to live in a different way.”
“Are you giving me free rein over your fate then?” Tony asks, suddenly all interested. He pretends to take a second to think, tapping his finger on his mouth but before Steve can say anything he adds swiftly, “Okay, I’m game. Gimme all you have.”
“I didn’t know what you like so I decided to test the waters,” Tony explains seeing Steve’s bewilderment. “I’m sure a fine specimen like you needs his load of proteins.”
“That’s not enough,” he says aloud and then louder to FRIDAY, “Who encrypted the rest of the footage?”
“Sorry, Rhodey,” Steve says to a holoprojection standing in front of him a few minutes later and looks at the others, “Well, sorry to all of you. We just didn’t know what to do.”
He breathes out again and lowers his head, resting his forehead against Tony’s. He shifts his weight but he’s still close and leaning. His whole body radiates heat even though Steve noticeably shivers in Tony’s arm.
Steve only shakes his head, barely visible in lieu of an answer and stepping a few more steps into the room, he stands on the other side of Tony’s bed.
So right now? Right now, everything seems to be borrowed. This friendship with Rogers. This tangled and complicated relationship with Pepper. And any connection with whoever else is in the other Tony’s life. It’s not his. He just happened to land in another person’s life. He doesn’t feel and he doesn’t want the same things. And he has a suspicion that these people would expect from him exactly the opposite. They lost the other guy but now they have a replacement so of course, they’d want him to take over all these new roles. To be a friend. To be a husband. To be a father. God—
“Yes, I can pass my mantle and be just Steve Rogers,” he decides. “Yes, I can be happy spending the rest of my life with you, in this house or in any other place you’d like and in any other way. I don’t care. I just want to try.”
He squeezes Steve’s shoulder one more time and to his utmost regret, he finally lets it go. It’s a nice shoulder, okay? It’s warm and solid under his hand and he knows it would feel great wrapped around any part of Tony’s body. But that’s out of his reach. Besides, Cap is really smashed.
He wants to think that’s directed at him but there is a traitorous voice at the back of his head, telling him that it’s only his ego that allows him to consider this smile and this look to be meant for him. Because nothing of this is his. Not this friendship. Not this house. Not this future. At least not anymore.
Steve also knows that they didn’t decide on how to introduce Tony to Morgan, but that’s also okay because it’s a huge step. The biggest one, really. So, Steve isn’t surprised that they take their time with that. But even if that’s still a work in progress, he thinks he did his job there too. Morgan has two parents again. It’ll work out eventually.
He nudges with his nose at Tony’s skin just above the belt, breathing in deeply. His mouth follows. He kisses it softly. His lips only barely trace their way up as he glances back at the man.
Maybe because of that he doesn’t feel the first touch. He reacts only when Pepper sits next to him, rapidly sitting upright.
“You told me everything yourself when we reconnected,” she picks up after a moment and gives him a small smile. “You didn’t want to have secrets between us since you’re not even good at keeping them.”
Steve holds his head up and turns to search the crowd. He still isn’t sure what he’s doing here. He’s been wondering about that for the past couple of weeks during which he accompanied Tony to these sorts of events and gatherings. Steve always agreed on it, because Tony had insisted, but he still doesn’t know why.
He catches the small, unsure smile and the sudden blush that covers Steve’s cheeks but for now, he leaves that uncommented. Instead, he takes a good look at the surroundings as he steps deeper inside the house.
Steve looks at the suits and back to the food. And only then he locks his eyes with Tony, stating flatly, “You flew. To the store.”
She inhales to answer but a beam of light transfers from the HUD onto the wall and anything Pepper was about to say dies down on her parted lips.
“The day you went to Afghanistan,” Steve whispers, looking at Tony with intensity. “It changed everything.”
past from his present. He’s afraid that he’d become too familiar with what he currently has, and he’d accept it as his life. Especially because it’s a good life. Perfect even. But also, one that can’t be his.
And Steve has enough of it. He really does. He feels like he’s the one who went back to the past, again facing someone who in his head changed a very long time ago. And yet here is Tony, arrogant, self-obsessed and with an ego so big that it can’t be compressed even in a house as big as this.
The smile from her lips is gone momentarily. She gives them both an offended look, gathering herself and mixing with the crowd.
“I had to keep my profile very low.” Steve huffs out a weak laugh. “But I managed to send you a phone and that letter.”
Tony looks at Steve quickly and sees how shaken the man is. Steve is trying to hold himself together, but he starts to slowly crumble under the impetuous roll of his emotions. Tony can recognize this now without missing a beat. He knows Steve. It might also be some kind of muscle memory, but he just knows this stuff about him, so he reaches for Steve’s hand and tangles their fingers together. It seems to work because Steve is able to snap out of it. He looks down at their hands and back at Tony, pressing a weak smile to his lips.
“I think you brought yourself back to this point of time on purpose,” Steve says surly. “I think you wanted to have a normal life.”
“For sure not after the snap,” Steve wonders aloud as he takes another drag of his beer. “And we’ve been on the run for two years so not much to celebrate at that time either.”
“FRIDAY,” he says decisively, aiming for the stairs. “Close all the doors, cut the connection completely. Nothing or no one goes in or out. We’re going dark until I tell you otherwise.”
“It changes nothing,” Tony says, and seeing that Steve wants to interrupt him, he adds, “I still don’t have a single memory and we already established that feelings come from within remembrance, right, Cap?”
“He doesn’t know that you are though,” Steve says simply. “No one knows. Except for me and Pepper and two former spies who will help us to manage the situation for now.”
Steve holds his head up and glances at Tony unsure, frowning. “I didn’t consider you to be someone who put so much faith in destiny.”
He still doesn’t fully know their history, but he starts to suspect that there’s also some kind of mystery behind these ocean blue eyes. One that’s far beyond anything that Steve still holds back. Something more private and incredibly close. And Tony is dying to know it. So of course, he has his eyes on Steve all the time. One has to be persistent in one’s endeavor if one is to deliver results. Besides, Steve’s a feast for the eyes in his
“Yeah, so we’re not knocking on closed doors,” Tony says matter-of-factly and opens the paper box with a delighted, “Yay.”
Steve breathes out a heavy breath. He hangs his head with resignation, resting his hands on his hips.
And this story Tony knows, at least to the point he understands it without further explanations so he only nods with an agreement and gives Steve an encouraging smile. To his surprise, he feels a gentle touch. Steve’s fingers linger for a moment on his shoulders as he passes by. It’s a short contact, just a simple gesture, but it’s enough for Tony to feel the warmth that spreads throughout his whole body. And to his surprise, it also feels like something he knows. It feels like something very familiar and comforting. It feels natural. And it gets him thinking. Because everything about this guy feels that way. It was easy to believe him the first moment he saw him at the hospital. It was easy to put Tony's trust in him when they arrived here. Tony basically put his life into Steve's hands without hesitation. And their dynamic? It’s like they have known each other for ages. It’s like every one of their moves around each other is a well-practiced dance known not only by their bodies but also their minds or maybe something even far beyond that. And there are other things. Things like the fact that Steve knows this house. Steve also knows Tony and all his bullshit and all his tells. He knows how to speak to him to get exactly what he wants. And this is frightening. But it’s also thrilling. Because this kind of knowledge doesn’t only come from brotherhood in the field or even friendship. This comes from—
“Ok, so, you have the possibility to go back, right?” Tony continues carefully. “Have you ever thought about doing it?”
Tony's voice breaks at this conclusion. He looks down for a moment like he suddenly remembers something, but then he holds his gaze up. There are barely visible lines around his eyes as his smile deepens and Steve feels tears running down his heated cheeks. He makes a small choking sound at the back of his throat when he takes a shuddering breath, bracing himself for another part to come when Tony resumes.
And Steve takes a moment to think, answering after a bit, “Once, but I failed or maybe I didn’t drink enough. And anyway, I’m not a fan.”
“And here I thought that for once you’ll think not everything is about you,” Steve snorts in response.
And like an answer to Tony’s thoughts, Bruce suddenly whispers barely hearable, “God, Natasha would be beyond herself seeing this.”
“Pepper, focus,” the man on the other end cuts, snapping his finger in front of the camera. He sounds unquestionably like the original Tony when he’s being an irritating dick. “Finish your tete-a-tete with your life-size version of Captain America’s action figure and tell Happy to pick me up and take me back to Malibu. Last time I remember I should be on a flight to Afghanistan, and see, I am able to remember that even if it’s my assistant, that’s you by the way, who should be keeping up with my schedule.”
“You knew about this the whole time,” he whispers. “It really is all my fault,” he adds shakily, ducking his head. “Fuck—I’m sorry. I—”
“Bingo,” Tony chimes. “Now let’s see what we have here,” he says, throwing his hands up to spread the videos around himself.
“Fuck, why he—” he cuts himself, pressing a tight smile. “Why did I choose this version of myself? What is so significant about it?”
He would even spot this sudden change of moods. He still notices it, but suddenly he is occupied by another thought. There’s one more recording that he should watch but it never occurred to him until now. Maybe he even should start to learn his history with it.
“Before Ultron,” Rhodey concludes. “The party that you guys asked me over after you got Loki’s scepter.” He turns to Tony. “Did he tell you that you created a murder-bot?”
Finally, they agreed that it would be beneficial if Pepper went back to the East Coast to slowly prepare Morgan for the eventuality of her father, maybe, potentially being back. But that could happen only when Steve learns what really happened. The theory about time travel is palatable but for him something doesn’t feel exactly right. And they can’t tell Morgan that she hasn’t lost her father if he would have to disappear from her life yet again.
And Tony can’t help but laugh. They are seated in this dim room. There is a vast sky just outside the windows. The view’s so overpowering that it almost feels like it crawls into their room. It envelopes them into the silver illumination of a full moon, hanging low on the horizon. And it’s just ironic how the setting matches everything they talk about. They are here, inside, small and fragile. The magnitude of the universe is just outside their windows, overwhelming and distant. And yet they both know what’s there, beyond this organized chaos. And because they suffered through the worst, they are not afraid of it anymore. So Tony laughs. It’s still a little desperate and still a little bit strained, but he doesn’t feel like falling anymore. He feels enclosed and safe. And he knows that’s the effect Steve has on him.
He stands up adding only “Friday, some music, please” and tries to focus on a soft tune she plays from a playlist of his liking as he quickly goes through his morning routine and then tries to find any clothes that will fit him.
“Actually, I do, yeah.” Steve ducks his head but he looks up at Tony with this gentle smile. “I’m still not sure of all the reasons, though. Is it because this means you’ll stay? Or because this changes everything?”
His hands move on Steve's face. He wipes the wetness from Steve’s cheeks with his thumbs as he observes the man carefully, letting him take a shaky breath.
. After all, he failed Pepper, right? And he’s going to do this to Morgan. And to Steve. Because that’s what he is. A constant failure. That’s why he acts so selfish. He pushes people away. That’s why he didn’t want to be involved with Pepper. Or with anyone else.
She takes another breath, observing him carefully. She’s clearly deciding on something when her eyes roam toward his face. And again, there is the look but it’s a little bit different this time. There are some other feelings underlying it. There is a tiny bit of sadness and regret in there like whatever she’s looking for in him is not there. And it feels more painful than he thought it would. But then Pepper moves and comes closer. She stands in between his parted legs and suddenly takes his face into her warm hands.
Steve closes his eyes and tries to calm his breath. Suddenly he finally feels something. He feels like he’s going to suffocate. His lungs won’t expand. It almost feels like his asthma is back, but he knows that it’s impossible. It can't be back. Just can’t. So why does he feel like he can’t inhale properly?
He nods one more time but this time to his own thoughts. His fingers close again around the helmet. Its coldness is sharp at his fingertips. The metal lures him again. It’s tempting to just let the chill linger on his skin, but Pepper’s hand closes on his wrist. It’s warm and supportive and so finally Steve moves the helmet away from himself. He gently puts it on the coffee table, giving it a last squeeze.
And it looks like she’s starting to comprehend some details. She settles her hands on both sides of Tony’s arms, searching his features for information. He sees the understanding that slowly appears in her eyes.
“Told you anything?” Tony finishes for him. “Yeah, right, so you can run? Like you want to run now?”
And then he leaves one more quick peck on Steve’s neck, his covered shoulder, and arm. Steve is completely distracted. He tries to turn, and this is the moment Tony uses. He rises on his toes and finally claims Steve’s mouth.
The anger is still there but he doesn’t know if it’s with himself or with Tony. It’s still a welcome change after all these days of feeling nothing. He also knows he can’t fully blame Tony because he acts like himself. Steve needs to be honest here – this behavior isn’t even something that he hasn’t experienced before. It’s all classic Tony. He was like this when they met the first time. Steve hated it at the beginning. It irked him at so many levels he couldn’t even pinpoint exactly why he couldn’t stand Tony, especially because he’s so alike to his father, whom Steve first and foremost respected. But yeah, Tony vexed something deep inside Steve, until—
“Sure, the boss is in the kitchen and helping himself to breakfast,” he hears as he puts the pants on and makes his way to the door.
“Is it ever a social call with people of your kind?” Christine’s smile changes into a grimace. “You always seem to work.”
Apparently, she really means it because she guides him to a separate small complex of buildings. They swiftly hide in one of them. The space looks kind of familiar. From the outside, it reminds him of a garage but inside he discovers a very well-known setup of his workshop. Even the arrangement of workstations is similar and when he hears the cheerful noise of a newer version of DUM-E, he relaxes. Not for long though. When he glances at Pepper, he sees that she looks pissed.
“Tony, dammit, can you be serious for once?” Steve’s voice carries notes of disappointment when he speaks up, “You have a daughter, for Christ’s sake. Have you thought about what's gonna happen when she sees her dead father flying around California? We are lucky that the press treated it as some test to replace you and they didn’t set up a camp around the house.”
I hope you don't mind these little visualisations! Here is what Tony has seen (among other things) in chapter 4 ;)
Tony hovers above him, staying close. He’s settled on his side, resting his chin on one of his hands as he gently traces patterns on Steve’s skin. For a few minutes now, he tries to prove that he can see some of Steve’s scars. He already found four to prove it.
Steve wakes up like he’d resurfaced from a deep dive. It’s sudden and not particularly pleasant. He abruptly holds himself up and then falls back into the mattress again. For a moment he doesn’t even know where he is and how he got here. There is an incredibly soft bed under him, his naked body is entangled by silk-like fabric and the room is so quiet that he thinks he might be still dreaming. But when he opens his eyes and he eventually gets used to the light, he can see the well-known view that spreads in front of him. There is a limitless sphere of blue sea and sky lit by the sun that rises over the Californian hills. It looks peaceful and undisturbed. And for the first time, thoughts that come to his mind when he sees it aren’t connected with any kind of fear. The vastness of it doesn’t scare him. It calms him down. Its endless eventuality fills him with hope rather than anxiety and Steve smiles, hiding his face deeper into the pillow, almost drifting off again.
Steve swiftly glances at Clint who stays quiet and says carefully, “Thor, I want you to travel to Vormir in our time.”
Anyway, Tony tries not to think about that, but he realizes that jumping on a bone called “Steve Rogers” doesn’t seem like the best idea under given circumstances. And okay, he might be the king of acting on stupid ideas but even this one is out of his league. Besides, he wants to know what happened and try to discover which direction to go. Should he stay in this world? Should he try to go back? And who the fuck brought him here? Thus, he doesn’t need distractions, he thinks and suddenly he sees a house at the top of the hill they had been climbing.
Mantis nods enthusiastically and her cute antennae glow brighter. “There’s this really tingling feeling I also used to get from Quill just before he took Gamora at the back—”
,” she admits. “And it was something that I had to deal with myself, so us breaking up was my decision and I fully intended to own it. When the events of 2015 happened, we weren’t together, but we were still friends so no, I wasn’t mad.”
Tony snorts another laugh at that. He looks up at the ceiling, trying to calm down. And he does after a moment, shaking his head to his own thoughts.
And like an indication of his words, Steve’s hands cling tighter into the fabric of Tony’s suit. His strong arms wrap around Tony’s back, bringing them even closer together.
He decided to stay behind with Pepper after the memorial even before he knew there was a message. It was the right thing to do… It was the only thing he was able to think about.
“You were right though, it’s freezing,” Tony says, pressing his lips together to hold his jaw from trembling and winces confused. “Why aren’t you cold?”
Tony doesn’t know how long they stay like this. It might be minutes or hours. He doesn’t care. He can be here for days and months if Steve needs it. Because Tony has in his arms a man that he loves. And he doesn’t know how it happened. Or when. Or even why. But he knows he’s one lucky bastard to have so many chances at having it all.
The girl nods sharply, suddenly serious. She runs to the stairs leading further down. Steve gives her a reassuring smile as she disappears down the staircase, and he tilts his chin to the entrance in a silent sign for Tony to follow.
Tony turns on his heel to look accusingly at Steve. “Don’t tell me. It’s another long story, right?”
Steve frowns and touches the place automatically, trying to remember. It’s true he took a few exceptionally hard blasts to his head and face, but the helmet mostly protects him well so it’s unusual that he’d have scarring in a place protected by it. And then he suddenly remembers. Looking at Tony sharply, he feels a sudden panic building inside him.
But all this? It also makes Rogers real. This man is a human being just like Tony. Ok, he might be faster, stronger, and far more resilient than any, even above average men, but he still is real and here, next to Tony’s bed. And he has been present in some version of Tony’s life as a permanent feature. For years. It looks like they are friends. How did that even happen?
“Look, I don’t know what really happened between the two of you,” Bruce starts, vexed. “It’s really not my business and I wasn’t here all the time. But I know that something did happen apart from the events that took place in Siberia. And Steve still beats himself for it. So, it’s obvious he wants to make it right between the two of you this time.”
He doesn’t feel that his muscles are sore from staying in the same position for hours. He doesn’t feel hungry, even if he doesn’t remember the last time, he had something to eat. He can’t sleep. But that's normal. To be honest, he hasn’t had a good night of sleep in the last seven years.
“Yeah but, I don’t know—” He swallows a huge bulk of guilt that suddenly appears in his throat, “—wouldn’t Bruce be better at it? He can also run some tests, check what really happened and wherever this Tony came from.”
Tony smiles brilliantly, undoing the first three buttons of his shirt. “This one’s been here for ages, but FRIDAY always checks before we go out if my choice of the day survived the Snap.”
“Everhart,” Tony says, walking up behind Steve, and there is a sudden warmth at Steve’s lower back when a question follows, “What kind of story do you think you’ll find here, hmm?”
“Fourteen,” Tony repeats, making a face like the word leaves a bad aftertaste on his tongue and he suddenly looks straight at Steve, asking accusingly, “So why don’t I look fifteen years older? I know I have good genes, but I should at least have scars after the arc reactor that apparently, I've built myself in a cave. And why the freaking hell do I still have a fading hickey left by Everhart, huh?”
Christine snorts and shakes her head. It looks like she has given up, but as she moves to pass through them, she pauses. Looking  at Tony with strange intent, now that she’s closer, her eyes narrow. Christine’s gaze is careful and evaluating. Steve can see that she’s intensively trying to understand what might be bothering her.
And Pepper sees it. Of course, she does. She isn’t only incredibly smart, but her empathy reaches extreme levels. She also probably feels the same notion or at least a shade of it, but she’s far better at hiding it for Morgan’s sake. And Steve should follow her lead. He really should at least try. For her. For Morgan. And to live up to the faith Tony had in him.
Suddenly he remembers some very important words. He opens his eyes and looks back at Tony. He’s calm but anticipating, and willing to do whatever Steve needs right now. He’s sure the man won’t push. He’ll wait. For as long as it will take. But Steve remembers what Peggy once told him. She said that she regrets how he couldn’t live his life. She didn’t mean any specific one. Now he gets that. She just wanted him to have one. She wanted him to stop the never-ending circle of war and sacrifice. She wanted Steve to have something that’s his own. She was brave enough to have it. She moved on. And he finally understands that he should, and he can do this right now. With Tony. In their time.
Pepper takes a deep breath, clearly consumed by her own waves of mixed emotions, but then she starts to move surely. Steve lets her outpace him a few steps. Her heels click on the floor in a rushed rhythm, resonating in the mostly empty corridor (of course they made an exception for Mr. Stark, and put him in a private, intensive care unit) to be cut abruptly when she enters the room. Steve’s at her back, freezing at the doorstep too. Only now he sees that Tony is awake and deeply consumed by a smartphone.
Steve slowly releases the breath he didn’t even know he was holding. He holds Tony’s focused gaze and nods slowly, finally leaning in to rest his forehead against Tony’s.
Steve snorts a short laugh but he obeys. He props himself up and sits on the bed’s edge, blindly pushing off his bag and clothes that got in his way.
“Nope, never lost.” Steve gives him a small smile when he puts the champagne bottle into Tony’s outstretched hands. “Just intimidated.”
