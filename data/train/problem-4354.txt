Dean looked to her, then to his daughter and Future him dancing in the middle of the living room. No other soul could be found. Dean bit his lip and then sighed. He nodded to Holly and she brought him to the next part of his timeline.
Dean sat up, rubbing at his face with his hands and then got out of bed, shrugging on his strewn about underwear and a pair of pajama pants he’d found on the floor of his bedroom.
"Well I think it's highly unfair for my clothes to be the only ones lost here." Jay chuckled and pulled Dean's hand to the front of his pants so he could feel him.
Images of Castiel and him being close to him, needing to be close to him. Needing to touch him. Needing Castiel to do unspeakable things to him.
“Little warning next time, huh Cas?” Dean swallowed, pulling a stray hair from his mouth in the process.
There was a gentle layer of mist surrounding him as well. The white ground slowly bled green as a grass like substance formed below the hunter’s boots. The air remained clear as oil and Dean slowly looked around, cautiously reaching for a weapon in his belt area that he quickly realized wasn’t there.
Dean walked over to the door and it creaked, almost as if it were inviting him in to watch. He saw Future Dean walking from the bathroom and over to Castiel. Castiel was lying, splayed out on the bed. His trench coat and shoes had been removed, his dress clothes as well, leaving him in nothing but a blood stained white t-shirt and boxers. Dean himself stepped back as if he were standing in his own way as Future Dean walked in front of him to the side of the bed. Future Dean sat on the edge of the bed and sighed. He rubbed his hand from his forehead to his chin and closed his eyes. Castiel shifted slightly on the bed and opened his.
“Nothing is ever a lost cause with us,” Dean cocked his head, concerned with Castiel’s words. “What? You’re not thinking of giving up, are you?”
Except for the times when a waitress stared at the angel for too long. Or when he’d say something unbelievably naïve or funny and Dean couldn’t help but laugh and give in to the rush of happiness that would flood through him. The times when Dean felt lonely and just wanted a companion, an ear, other than Sam’s, to bend.
Jack continued eating his crackers and pacing the floor, trying to silence thoughts he decided were best shared with nobody, even though confusion reigned supreme.
“Just try all the drawers for pajamas,” Sam sat Dean down on a nearby chair and watched him intently to make sure he wasn’t going to fall out of it. “And boxers if you don’t mind. He’s probably sweated through the ones he has on.”
“I have witnessed the loss of ma entire family,” LeSalle kept going. “I have been called every horrid name under the sun. I have seen the truest of power and harnessed it just as easily, but nothing compares ta love. There is no power on Earth stronger, no force greater. No words or love songs can encompass ma feelings for ya. I will love ya forever ma Drewby, and if there is life after that, I’ll love ya then too.”
There were times though, that Dean saw some apprehension, and it was all quickly melted away by a touch of Gabriel’s hand somewhere on his skin. Like now when Gabriel’s fingers wrapped around Sam’s and squeezed.
The hours passed on and Adam blinked blearily. Kevin had long since passed out in a chair, snoring lightly with a book still clutched in his hand. Lucifer had taken watch at the front door, dragging a chair from the lobby, and tapping his foot to a beat he was humming. Titan’s Angelhounds had taken watch outside. Titan himself was asleep at the foot of Daniel’s bed. Gabriel had conked out himself. He was the only angel Adam had ever seen sleep.
“You did good Winchester,” Jody mentioned and knelt down, extending her hand to each of the children. “Hello, I’m a good friend of your parents’. My name’s Jody.”
The old Ron would have laughed at this moment, reveled in the fact that they’d taken another life and gotten away with it.
Jack paced his room, feeling his body start to ache from the repeated motion and the changes happening that he still didn’t understand, but he couldn’t stop moving.
"Essentially yes," Holly nodded. "I was given an order by God to show you your future. He often does this. If you've ever heard of a person's life flashing before their eyes? Or a near death experience? Or in your case, a comatose future tour."
The ability to understand the monster before him left the hunter both sideswiped and baffled. The creature cocked its head, mimicking Dean, and started taking a few steps towards him. Dean felt his throat go dry, his arm burned, and he stumbled as he tried to get away from it. The other creatures had been gone for quite a while, but Dean still reached for the area behind him. As if they could help him.
"It was all a lie though," Castiel turned to his friend. "Everyone wanted our archangel brothers to fight. I was simply a cog in the machine."
At least, that was Dean’s hope, as he set a fifth setting for his brother and stepped back to admire his handiwork.
“I love you too, Ron Ryder.” Kevin smiled, rubbing Ron’s cheeks as the pair continued to touch foreheads, eyes closed, reveling in the moment no matter how much it made Ron’s ribs ache.
“Something of that nature, yes,” Castiel nodded. “But…I suppose you should know that by now it has grown exponentially into more than that.”
Daniel hesitated a moment. It felt strange, breaking his parents’ trust, but ultimately, it was their fault for basically keeping him imprisoned. A dog could only be nice in a cage for so long before it turned.
Crowley had spent months working with Hades, trying to find rogue demons in Hell, and trying to fix what had been broken, when little did, he know he had been breaking things all along. Breaking things and making passages for the God of The Underworld to make his way up to Earth to rule it.
"It represents the barrier between one memory or dream and the next," Holly explained. "Since you're in a coma you're in a state of constant dreaming per se. It's a common archetype."
“What I mean is,” Sam explained. “Jess didn’t know about the life. Jess was…beautifully ordinary. But Cas…he’s-.”
Daniel bashfully looked away, feeling embarrassed with his answer after Sarah’s logical explanation. He gripped his own hand, rubbing them together, until he felt Castiel’s hand on his arm. The trench coat donning angel gave his son a sincere smile and immediately deflected the conversation to something he saw out the window in the clouds.
Dean practically jumped, seeing himself brush past him, and stand before the other man. A million-watt smile pressed up against the hunter’s cheeks.
Dean thought back to earlier that day. When they’d busted down the motel room door, Adam and Eve were nowhere to be found, but they had been there previously. Castiel and Gabriel had sensed their energy the moment they’d entered the room, but it had gone quiet.
Dean walked slowly, his breaths catching in his throat as he did. His hands were nestled deep in his pockets and his boots felt heavy on his feet. He stopped when he reached the house he'd seen before: 2340 Maple Street. At first he didn't know what the difference was or why he was there. What difference had a few years made? When he saw the 'For Sale' sign with a 'SOLD' one plastered over it though, he somehow knew.
The brothers had driven through the night, back to Lebanon from some small backwoods town that Charlie had turned them on to upon hearing some “hunting noise” passing through. She had kept going, but insisted the brothers let her know if she were needed, and she would turn around.
Castiel took a deep breath, ignoring the cries of those on the outer edges, being swallowed by ink and nothingness. They had yet to shed their human skin and to walk as their true selves once more. Those closest to him turned at the sound of a piercing scream. The Empty was angry. The Empty was coming, and this time there would be no remorse.
“Well if you hadn’t spent so long in the bathroom doing your hair and makeup Samantha,” Dean replied. “I would have had time to fix it before we left.”
“I suppose you’ve been filled in on the likes of my cousins,” Ron said, as though dipping his feet in the water, and testing it.
Jack heard the black-haired boy stir and immediately got up from where he’d been sitting for the past twenty-four hours. He’d already done two more healing attempts, both times keeping the boy’s fever at an acceptable level, but never fully being able to free him from it.
He breathed deeply a few times, in through his nose and out through his mouth, and opened his eyes. He was back in the place he’d started in, a less than earthen plane outside a giant house like structure.
All Dean saw was Castiel, standing in the hallway contemplating whether or not to enter his future daughter's room. All Dean heard was Stone Temple Pilots' 'Interstate Love Song' blasting from her radio. Future Dean walked by, a basket of clean laundry in his arms, he looked like a regular housewife.
Charon nodded back, his eyes turning red as he vanished into thin air, leaving Hades on his own. The Greek God sighed, rolling his eyes, and conjuring up a goblet of nectar as he walked the caverns back to his eternal house.
As though he had been meant to find this place, and Daniel suspected it wouldn’t be the last time he’d visit the empty field in his lifetime.
Sam was too distracted, muttering a prayer to Gabriel under his breath, and closing his eyes. Upon finally gaining his bearings, Dean tried to the same approach.
After a shower and an awkward few forty-eight hours, Dean found Sam in the war room catching up on some lore.
“I know this,” Balthazar replied, kneeling over the dog at his feet, and placing a hand on its middle. “I didn’t say it was fair.”
“Eve,” Austin nodded. “Adam. Your ties to Hell have officially been broken upon our fathers allowing you to escape when Hell fell victim to Abbadon’s curse. Now, I do believe you owe them one.”
Austin had caused yet another slaughter and Ron hadn’t stopped it. He had had the chance, but he had chosen to do nothing instead.
"Yeah well we don't like to talk about our feelings in this family," Sam inched in a bit of sarcasm, hoping to get Dean to shut up. "So, let's just drop it. Okay?"
Clark considered Jack's words, having decided he had seen enough weird things in his short lifetime and time of hunting that he wouldn't allow anything Jack had just told him to freak him out. Jack wasn't human. There were a lot of things about him that were strange. Clark knew that now, and somehow, deep down, it just made Jack far more special. Hell, Clark was special too, in his own ways. Everyone was. It was one of the first life lessons his mother had instilled in him, and even though he'd never listened to her until it was too late to listen ever again, he decided he would definitely heed her advice now and henceforth.
The lights were on inside, the warm summer air filtered in through his open car windows, and the sun was just starting to go down. The clouds were like a Rorschach test and his wife was just beyond that front door.
Gabriel and Sam get closer in Dean's future and Castiel let's a teacher have it for mistreating his kid.
Ron cried out in pain, feeling Kevin’s fingers graze his wound as the Prophet bit his lip, attempting to change the Hellboy’s bandage.
Future Dean took a deep breath and nodded. He held her close and rocked her as he sang from the beginning verse to the chorus.
Ron had stormed into the lower levels of Hell, hot on the heels of answers, and demanded them from both Hades and Charon, who he’d found talking with Crowley about the ins and outs of Hell lately. He would have asked Austin’s father, had he been awake and risen to answer, but Croatoan had been in coma for centuries and, unfortunately, wasn’t about to provide any answers anytime soon. Charon had clarified that Austin’s ambitions were his own and that the two of them hadn’t heard a word of this supposed rise from the depths onto Earth they were all three to take. Hades had remained quiet, but essentially nodded along to everything Charon had said to Ron upon his arrival in Hades’ house in Hell.
Titan and Tojo walked the streets of Lebanon, coming back from the drug store, and Titan’s thoughts were as faraway as the moon.
The next thing Dean knew he and her were standing in a median on a busy road. At least the road would've been busy during the day. It was night and Dean had an overwhelming feeling of what appeared to be dread.
Castiel was beside him, his vessel different once again from the one Dean was used to, but something deep inside Dean told him it was the angel he called a friend, a brother in arms, a comrade.
Lucifer stared intently at the map board, trying to take Balthazar’s words to heart. It had been a strange feeling, finally being back in Heaven and his Father accepting him back with open arms, but it was an even stranger feeling calling people who he’d once worked so hard against. It almost didn’t feel like he had the right.
Dean hit the brakes even harder that time, barely missing a half drunken pedestrian shaking his fist at the Impala. Dean glared when the guy tapped the hood and then kept walking, a brown bag being lifted to his lips.
Daniel rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder, looking over it to see his worried uncles and his cousin, staring at him as though he didn’t belong on the Earthen plane. It was overshadowed by fear, her gaze, but Daniel felt his heart sink, nonetheless. Titan had shifted into his hound form and came up alongside the boy, also worried, and nudged his hand as Daniel reached out to pet the hound's head. Meg stood back beside Sam, sharing a look with him as they watched Dean hold onto his boy.
“Nothing new to report,” Anorath explained. “The scouts should be returning soon for the evening, but I do have a request for your…our presence down under.”
Garth patted Castiel's shoulder and walked off, leaving the angel to wait on the other side of the door for Dean, and resisting every urge he had to bust in and simply take Dean into his arms to comfort him.
“I have witnessed many such things over the years I have visited Earth,” Castiel explained. “I do believe I have managed to witness love in almost all its forms.”
"I'll tell you one thing," she continued, shaking her head as she walked off to follow Castiel. "I could cut the tension in that car with the dullest knife on the planet."
The little boy smirked, his eyes flashing a whitish color before he called out to his sister in his mind.
“They helped me out,” Castiel explained as all the hunters in the room stared at the pair. “All our allies, the demons and angels, they…helped me escape.”
"Your brother kept his promise," Holly explained, flying them back to Future Dean's house. "He comes home every Christmas and other occasion. It makes the kids happy."
Dean looked around to try and find someone else as equally important to greet and moments later, he saw her, sitting on the porch and talking to another man he never thought she’d so much as have a decent conversation with.
In less than five minutes, the room was full. Sam, Lucifer, Chaya, Ron, Kevin, Adam, and Ezra came from the left. Crowley appeared in a puff of smoke, followed not long after by Titan and Meg on the right. Balthazar flew in moments later, snapping his fingers to summon the other Angelhounds on guard outside. They appeared by his side with their eyes glowing. Another voice called out from behind Sam and Dean and the brothers turned to see a familiar redhead.
“I must attend to Jack,” Castiel piped up, a bit quickly, and he swallowed hard when Dean met his eyes. “You understand, just wanting to make sure it’s not something more serious.”
Realization hit Dean and Sam like a train as Castiel spoke. Gabriel hung his head, leaning into Sam, and closing his eyes in defeat and pain.
When Sam entered the quiet bar, he ran a hand through his hair, and looked around for the person he'd promised to meet. The bartender solemnly cleaned glasses near the bar sink. The only other patrons were two old burly guys sitting and smoking in a booth.
Dean excused himself from Crowley and made his way over to Castiel, placing a hand upon his mate’s shoulder and smiling at him. Daniel stood on the other side of Castiel, near his cousin, and Dean’s smile only grew when he saw his son lean into Castiel’s shoulder and rest his head.
Dean almost choked on his own words. Not that Sam needed to know, and Dean swore up and down he would never tell him, but the thought of that happening made Dean fill with the slightest bit of nauseous rage.
"Dean needed some TLC from a friend of ours whose an expert on the subject," Sam explained. "I was in the neighborhood and figured I'd ask you to get a drink."
Still, thoughts of Hell plagued him every waking day and every time he closed his eyes on his pillow at night. It was a hard life to live, and he had felt entirely alone in it until his talk with Alex.
“No more than usual,” Sam fit a joke into his statement. It wasn’t like hunters ever felt entirely normal, well, or rested. “Why? Have you?”
Dean had spent some time alone on Bobby's land in between a hunt. He'd needed to. Bobby was long since gone, his house reduced to ash because of Leviathans. Dean had trudged around the blackened earth. He'd looked over at the soil and saw sprigs of grass. He even saw a few sprouts indicating future flowers. He took that as a good sign, if ever he'd seen one. Dean had gone into the woods behind Bobby's land and looked at the lake. It had been silent and still. It had yet to see the future. It had yet to swallow the secrets of a little girl that Dean was to pull from it. He'd walked over to the tire swing and touched it before pushing it a little to make it fly through the air and over the water.
"Thank…well somebody other than Chuck," Dean commented as they drove down the winding road leading to Garth's farmhouse. "I was afraid I'd lose my mind listening to your sissy music for one more second."
“I’m honestly just shocked that I’m even here,” Deacon Barnes remarked, adjusting his tie, and flattening down his hair once more. “Given ma history with these people.”
“Alright newlyweds, or whatever the title is,” Gabriel called out. “Get a room! It’s time for another song, baby!”
Future Dean looked overjoyed. He couldn't even express it in words. He simply held Castiel close to him; he'd brought Future him to tears. Dean wasn't an easily moved man. This was strange for him to watch. The moment was over almost as quickly as it had begun and Dean watched Future him kiss Castiel. Dean had kissed a lot of women in his lifetime. Never had he kissed one of them like this. There was nothing, but pure love in it. Dean saw his shoulders convulse as Future him deepened the kiss, tears running down his face. Dean caught his breath again, this all felt so familiar yet like some faraway dream. Like he was something that never was. He was grateful for what Holly had shown him so far, but at the same time his heart was aching.
Castiel stood near the altar, admiring it, and touching the flowers that covered it. Dean cocked his head, watching Castiel with curiosity. It never failed to amaze him just how fascinated the angel was with simple things even after all his time spent on Earth.
Dean observed Holly again. There were a few more red spots on her clothes after she had bitten into her burger only twice.
“Castiel,” Anorath walked over to the angel in charge, looking tired and grim. He had spent some time down on Earth recently, assisting the scouts in trying to locate the source of the powerful energy.
“Anything for my family.” Titan replied, turning his head at the sound of Dean whistling and motioning for them to follow the group.
"Really," Sam nodded with a smile. "We used to have to take care of each other, but now I need someone to take over that very special job. I think you could do it?"
“I don’t see why you are so bothered by this,” Castiel said. “It isn’t any different from you bedding women in every town you stop in.”
“That would be awesome!” Charlie exclaimed and then made a confused face. “Wow, never thought I’d be thanking the devil for anything.”
"In the beginning yeah," Bobby shrugged. "Then mine and Sam's, then the rest of the world, and finally you."
The air was heavy in the room after. Gabriel sat on the other side of his daughter’s bed, pulling her close to him, and holding her as the pair watched what was on TV. Lucifer took a seat in another chair near Adam and gazed over at his younger archangel brother. He hadn’t ignored the look Sam had given him once he’d flown into the room. He hadn’t ignored the anguish in Dean’s eyes when he’d stepped away from his son to leave on another hunt. Lucifer was shocked he was even allowed in the same room as the Winchesters and their camaraderie.
“Cas you don’t need to apologize,” Dean said, placing his hand on the angel’s shoulder. “God knows I-.”
"I am by your side Dean," Castiel nodded. "It has been an honor for this short blink in my eternally long existence."
"There is no way you could've let your Papa down," Titan, the family Angelhound, came up behind her and startled her. She jumped in her seat on the curb. He sat next her. "No one is ever what they're expected to be."
Charlie awoke at the sound the light made and the commotion from the angels and stared down at the map to read it.
Dean glanced over at the angel, whose gaze was filled with anguish and fatigue. Dean's stomach dropped to his feet. Castiel had been looking out for him once again, and what had Dean done to show for it? Almost drowned in a lake.
"I thought we were long past this." Dean groaned and settled back down into bed, throwing an arm over his face.
The winking face sent an unusual shiver down Sam's spine and he smiled after pocketing his phone and locking up his room. He made his way down the dank motel hallway and passed door after similar door until he reached Dean's room.
“Daniel!” he heard his father call out and suddenly Dean was on his knees, hugging Daniel close to him and pressing him hard into his chest.
The dog with him whined, and Lucifer briefly reached down to comfort her. A gesture Dean would have never guessed was real unless he’d seen it himself, and now he had. Lucifer faced his Father, empty powerless anger lingering in his vessel’s eyes, and, without even turning around, God lifted a hand.
Daniel broke into a cheeky smile and raised his hand as a ball of pure grace filled energy appeared in his hand.
"Please," Castiel pleaded, true worry in his eyes. They shone a little less than normal, not that Dean paid attention to that much detail on Castiel's face. "Please just a few more minutes…"
"Well gee," Dean scoffed. "Thanks for the heads up, Cas. That's kind of creepy if you think about it."
Now places where it felt as though he was walking through thick air, yet simultaneously moving calmly, knowing where his metaphorical feet were going to land.
Castiel turned his gaze upon the pool of water forming at the base of the building. So much of Heaven's infrastructure had changed since the war between his brothers had gone awry. Castiel supposed he had never truly noticed until now.
“Nothing yet,” Crowley said, turning to face the son of Charon. “Anything I should know about your father before I inevitably face him within the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours?’
Dean sat up a little straighter. He'd never first a firsthand account of Garth's attempt to leave the planet. He'd only briefly digested the details when they'd first encountered Bess and Garth had explained her place in his life.
The panic welling up inside of Dean was overwhelming. His breathing was rapid, and his body was tense. The spiderweb grew. The glass it was made of started to fall. Dean could feel some of it burying into his flesh. His hand had gone numb by the time the cobweb wall had splintered and opened a new passageway.
Dean squeezed Castiel’s limp hand and smiled. After so many years, it was his turn to watch over the angel.
The way Sam was acting was as though he was dealing with something foreign. Something that scared the hell out of him more so than any monster ever could. His older brother, the one who had most likely hidden any ailments of his own in order to care for his little brother his whole life, was down and out, and Sam was at a loss for what to do.
Either way, Sam and Dean would be there to pick up the pieces and hopefully keep everyone they cared about alive for another day.
Sam gave Jody a sideways look and reached for the keys to her spare car she often let the brothers use while they were in town.
Clark turned to see a rather tall man with shaggy-ish brown hair walking his way. The man smiled and placed his hands in his pockets. A rather large book rested under one of his arms.
"We all did, kid." The manager patted Dean's shoulder and continued to signal for the bulldozer to come forward. Dean turned to his two companions, Castiel staring blankly and Sam wondering if Dean had lost his mind.
“Why are you sorry?” Dean asked, genuinely shocked the angel would ask such a thing. “I just regret not asking you about, well, you sooner.”
“Angelhound,” Castiel corrected him. “And yes, I did at one time, but the program was disbanded, and we were told to slaughter them.”
"Uncle Sammy and Uncle Gabe!" Daniel jumped out of Future Dean's arms and started to run for the door, but Castiel stopped him.
Their first stop had been to the twenty-four-hour drug store for medicine for the Nephilims. Titan carried the swinging white bag with fever reducer and cough syrup in it as the pair continued to move along.
“Go get ‘em, before they get in some serious trouble.” Meg nodded, encouraging him to go after the Nephilim.
“No man is that powerful, Dean.” Castiel says, turning his head to reveal a full face half laden with several glowing eyes in a small line on the right side. The right side, still beautiful and blue and human.
The tall buildings, stretching for eons into the sky. The cars that zipped to and fro looked almost nothing like the ones she’d seen the last time she was topside. The way the young humans dressed, leaving almost nothing to the imagination anymore. Eve found herself staring for long after one young girl and her friends passed by. Her brother too, which led her to slapping his arm and ushering him forward.
He’d refused a wheelchair, walking out with only the guidance of Sam and Castiel on either side of him, and he’d also been lacking a ride out due to the doctors and nurses not even knowing he’d left.
Gabriel snapped his fingers and Castiel vanished into thin air. It was the first time in history that the angel had managed to wear normal human clothes outside the bunker and Gabriel was immensely proud he’d been the one behind the convincing.
He didn’t wish to get Daniel’s hopes up for the time being. It wouldn’t have been fair, to promise him something that, deep down, Dean knew wasn’t mean to be.
Older Dean felt his heart sink. This was the moment he’d carried with him his entire life up until now. The moment his brain had short circuited, and he’d sworn his heart had beaten hard enough to bust through his rib cage.
"Morning boys," Jody called out from the kitchen. "There are pancakes on a plate near the stove! Coffee is hot! I gotta head to the station, but I'll be back tonight for dinner."
Jack had learned so much over the course of the time he’d spent with the Winchesters. He knew when to eat. When to sleep. What TV shows were good and what shows were bad. What dreams meant (in Dean’s opinion: nothing).
Dean was trying to focus, but his mind was very much elsewhere. The scent of sulfur had permeated his nostrils the moment they’d stepped foot in the victim’s room. Demons. Definitely something Dean was in the mood for.
Castiel stood to leave their son, who was too engrossed in playing whatever make believe scenario he had going at the moment to even notice Dean's cussing. Castiel knelt in front of Future Dean, taking his hand and rubbing the back of it with his thumb. Future Dean looked up at him.
Eileen realized what Sam meant and broke into an even bigger grin, thrusting herself closer to Sam's embrace as he pulled her in for a deep, loving kiss.
Sam had proceeded to walk into the motel room with a rather serious look on his face moments earlier than Dean’s question and reveal a bit of information that Dean found to be rather, well almost, in their line of work anything was possible, unbelievable.
The night felt as though it had come faster this time. Garth had assured Dean he hadn't had to help clean up after the party. His family was planning a run under the full moon together. No hunting, no attacking people, just a test of their skills and bonding time. Gertie excitedly danced around the yard, motioning for Garth to pick her up and he did, snuggling his face into hers and giving her a type of butterfly kiss Dean had only seen in cheesy movies.
Titan sighed heavily and considered letting out a growl upon hearing Tojo on angel radio in his head, kissed Meg on the forehead, and got out of her bed, naked as the day God made him.
It took all Meg’s strength to not panic. It had been only five minutes since Crowley had delivered the news she had suspected, but in what had felt like an hour even though it wasn’t, she had yet to find a word to say to him.
Rarely were they allowed out, since the family still wasn’t any closer to capturing and stopping Adam and Eve, but Sarah had also somehow inherited the power of smooth talk and, more often than not, got them what they desired.
Dean turned on the fan to suck up the steam forming from the hot water. The glass door to the shower steamed up and Dean motioned for Castiel to get in. The angel nodded and pulled back the door and climbed under the water.
Sam let out a deep sigh of relief. Or at least, for a moment he was relieved. Then, he felt an overwhelming emptiness take over. He'd cooked up scenarios for the past few nights. Pictures and images of a little brown-haired girl, he'd been convinced he was going to have a daughter, running around the bunker and eventually, their own house. Sam would have left the life. He would have made sure this time. A normal life. A normal job. A family.
He came up beside her, sitting down and placing his coffee cup on a table nearby. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close to his side, and she smiled up at him.
“Sorry that we’re back here,” Sarah apologized, as the pair made their way across the empty field, and realization hit Daniel like a train.
Dean raised an accusatory eyebrow, but kept his thoughts to himself. How could one girl be so clumsy all of the time? Dean brushed away those thoughts much like the waitress was brushing dirt under the counter where no one could see it, but it was still there. Much like Dean's suspicion. Holly scarfed down her burger and as Dean finished up his last bite she looked to him.
She followed Castiel and Dean and Holly did as well. Dean looked around at the Seventh Realm of Heaven and couldn't believe its beauty. Castiel had told him about Heaven awhile back, that there were Seven Realms and the Seventh was the center of Heaven where the Big House was located, the Distinguished Angel Council: a group of angels that oversaw angelic beings and tried their crimes, and supposedly where God had hung out before he decided to split. Castiel's story didn't do it justice.
Dean Winchester smiled, leaning up against his beloved Impala with his arms crossed. A small boombox rested by his feet and was playing music. A blanket was draped out onto the grass. Two beers were in Dean’s hand.
The sound of a demon grunting when Ron pushed the creature into the wall behind the two of them was music to the young man’s ears.
I hope everyone enjoyed this chapter and that nothing was too confusing. Ron’s species is “Hellboy” not to be confused with the comic of the same name. In case anyone was wondering about that.
Balthazar touched what would have been a shoulder if Castiel had been in a vessel and Castiel winced.
He could vaguely hear something else, like another kind of echo beyond the mind fog. It sounded so much like his brother Sam, but he couldn’t be sure.
It took what felt like ages to get back to the bunker. Hours passed and Dean fought the nausea from his obvious concussion, but it also didn’t take long for Castiel to fix that too. Dean stumbled up the stairs from the garage, and down them again to the war room before taking a seat and letting out a deep sigh in the process.
Castiel appeared, after a few more moments of Dean begging. The angel's head was slightly hung, as though he didn't want to meet Dean's gaze. Dean swallowed hard, wincing at the pain that followed.
Castiel stood in place, turning around in a circle, perplexed. He had been here before, but it had been Jack who’d prayed. Jack who’d woken him up. He’d yet to hear a voice, a sound.
"C'mon Sammy I know you know the words," Gabriel laughed in pure delight. "Lighten up! Sing with me! Have some fun!"
"I-." Castiel began, but then swallowed his words. He looked away and then started to leave the room.
“Clarence,” a voice piped up and Castiel spun around quickly to see Meg standing about ten feet away from him.
It left Castiel and Dean alone in a silent, yet deafeningly loud room. Unspoken thoughts filled their minds, never to make it past their half open mouths.
Ron clenched his fists and stopped at the door. He closed his eyes, picturing his next words, and kicked open the door. He reached for his knife, a skull with red eyes on the handle, and twirled it in his hand as he looked around.
"What I skipped was not of import," Holly replied, she looked a bit older than before, but Dean played it off as a trick of his eyes. "There was a hunt here, a salt and burn there, motels, bad food, angels, etc, nothing of too much significance that it can't be skipped over."
So, he let it out, on the clear walls that held him in the black abyss. His fist pounded against the invisible forcefield and the sound reverberated and rumbled with every blow. Dean threw his arm harder, faster, until he was left panting and his fist begun to swell from bruising and pain.
Titan’s laughter erupted and filled the room. Sarah squealed in laughter and Daniel smiled quietly as the hound declared himself the winner. Gabriel laughed along with his daughter and the others watched silently with smiles on their faces.
“Forgive me,” Castiel replied. “My Father’s betrayal appears to be affecting me more than I thought it would. I suppose I need to refocus my energy. I fear I have neglected those closest to me in the process.”
Dean felt his body relax once more, and the hunter settled into the pillow, facing away from Castiel. Dean closed his eyes and tried not to think about the angel, who was most likely staring at the back of his head, watching over him yet another time.
Adam and Ezra both looked over at the sleeping kids, the Angelhound resting and watching over them, and the Prophet asleep in the other corner.
The others started to leave, looking back at Ron with worried gazes as they went. The moon’s bright beams shone through the broken warehouse windows and glinted off of Austin’s knife as he turned to face Ron one last time.
"It's not often we get to do things like this," Garth continued. "What with the world going to sh—crap every other day. Everybody here in the same place. Especially two of my best friends Sam and Dean Winchester, who have done more for me and my family than I can ever repay."
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Sam felt immense pressure on his wrist. He was being pushed into the wall and unable to move forward, almost dropping the bottle of Gatorade he held in his other hand.
“The Bible pegs you as a doting idiot.” Eve remarked, leaning her head onto Adam’s shoulder, and continuing to watch the local news.
Ever since he was little, he had believed in its power. Its power to heal, to comfort, and to replenish the earth in a way nothing else could. He and Sam had often gathered at motel windows to watch storms together. He could recall Sam's fingers shooting up in the air and pointing at each strike. His younger brother's eyes filled with wonder. Speculating that the energy came from beyond. From angels. From something far more powerful than the two Winchesters could ever imagine.
Dean’s voice is so small that Castiel can hardly hear him, but even so, all the oxygen seems to rush back into the room at the sound. Castiel feels full, suddenly. Alive where before he’d felt like the walking dead. God, he’d been an idiot to run. Dean’s here. Dean’s
His own fear of rejection falls away to nothing. If he can only convince Dean how loved he is, if he can prove to him that to Castiel, there is nobody more important, then he’ll gladly bear the pain of having his feelings known and not returned—though the more he considers what he’s seeing, the less likely it seems that Dean feels differently.
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Castiel assures him as he makes his way back over. “Just—my partner refused to stop somewhere overnight, and now he’s going to spend all day pretending he doesn’t have a stiff neck from sleeping in the car, just so I can’t say I told him so.”
A huge tree, weighed down with Spanish moss, stands in the centre of the horse-shoe shaped building. John uses it as a shield to hide the car from the road. He makes Dean wait while he goes inside. When he comes back, almost twenty minutes later, his hands are smeared with something dark.
There’s a new synchronicity to them as they rise together, dusting themselves off in the pink light of dawn before starting back toward the bunker’s door without a word between them. Dean walks slightly ahead. Castiel watches him move with an interest more open than he’s ever allowed himself before. He’s beautiful—that much isn’t a revelation—but there’s something easier about him now. Less tense. His shoulders are lower, his muscles loose and sinuous, comfortable in a way that Castiel has never seen.
“Castiel?” Agent Henriksen is heading for the door with his cell phone in hand, but he stops and flips it shut as Castiel turns to face him. “We wondered where you got to. You doing okay?”
A gust of wind outside sends leaves and stones scattering, rattling against the side of the building, and he whips his attention back to the building storm.
Dean picks a point on the wall behind them to look at, and tells them everything. Tells them about going to Billie’s library; about her single-minded desperation to kill Dean for what he’d done to her. How she’d claimed that Chuck was to blame for the people disappearing. How she’d stalked them through the bunker and crushed Dean’s heart with a thought. He doesn’t mention that it still feels like her vise grip is squeezing tight around it.
“I spoke to Mom this morning. She’s spending the rest of the day with Wally’s sister, but she said she’d head back here tonight.”
“Anyway, I figure we should go first thing, maybe try and catch something for lunch,” Dean says, stretching his arms up over his head before looking over at Castiel. “Speaking of food…”
“Please. You love me,” Dean jokes, and Castiel aches at the truth of it. “But yeah, okay, I get your point. Same shit, different… junk.”
It’s still dark when he wakes to the sound of the driver’s side door slamming. His entire body aches, and he sits up, blinking blearily until he can make out the digits on the dashboard clock. Just after two in the morning.
Waking his phone back up, Dean flicks through his playlists, unable to settle on anything. Eventually he gives up and hits shuffle. An old Nat King Cole Trio song plays first, and Castiel opens his eyes to glance over at him. Dean gives him an awkward smile.
Walking toward the wreckage would be incredibly foolish, but he still takes a few steps that way before he stops. They’d been flying south-east and his men jumped before he did. If he’s to find any of them, it will be north-west of here. He starts walking and finds Daniel almost forty minutes later, hanging from his parachute lines in a huge pine.
“Jack misses you” had been a lie. Or, maybe it was true, but the kid had been lacking most of his soul by then, so Dean doubts it. “Jack misses you” had been nothing but a projection, a buffer for his own worthless feelings, and it was goddamn pathetic.
He’s been scared in his life more often than not, but with everything else, he’s pushed ahead anyway. This, though. The thing with him and Cas has always felt impossible, despite the fact that he’s 99% sure he’s not on his own. After all, there’s only so many times that you can see someone choose you, personally, over literal Heaven before it becomes clear that there’s some deep feeling there.
He just stares, dazed, until something shifts behind his eyes like a switch being flicked, and then he slips his jacket and shirts free in a fluid motion, flinging them across the tiny room before kneeling to untie his boots.
For once, though, it seems that he’s true to his word. After another hour he pulls into the parking lot of an old motel that looks like it’s been closed for a decade. Dean doesn’t bother to ask him where they are. He can barely see anymore. He’s too tired and hungry and sick and in too much pain to read any more signs, and he suspects that the only reason John is pulling over now is because he can’t see straight either.
The house is wedged in the middle of a growth of pine that trails from the roadside and up into the nearby mountains, and in more than one place the once white clapboard siding is dark with mold and moss.
“The jacket was bringing you to me,” Castiel says, finally finding his voice. “It was bringing you to me, and I’m already here, so there’s nowhere for it to go.”
“You betcha. And hey, come visit when you can. It’d be nice to put a face to the name, and Dean—don’t forget you promised to make me one of your world-famous burgers sometime.”
Charlie is half asleep when she answers her door the following morning, only one eye open to glare at Dean for his arrival.
He thinks about it for a few minutes, lets his mind wander. Imagines Cas in his well-ordered room, sitting with his back against the bookshelves, knees curled to his chest, headphones pressed over his ears and the tape playing through them. Imagines him hearing Dean’s confession woven into familiar music, and smiling. Imagines Cas telling him he understood. Imagines Cas cupping his cheeks and kissing him.
“Yes, I’m sure that’s exactly the phrasing your teachers used,” Castiel says, unable to suppress his smirk at the way Dean snorts in response. “Do you really think you’re not smart enough?”
“So,” she says, curling her socked feet up onto the cushion and looking at Dean as he slumps down at the opposite end. “Any ideas?”
It only took a few minutes in the garage for Dean’s mouth to run dry at the visceral memory of an IED ripping through his convoy on his last deployment before he came home. His head started spinning, and it wasn’t until he felt Bobby’s hands on his face that he realized he was sitting on the ground.
“Yeah,” Dean breathes out, then laughs, slightly hysterical. His fingers flex on Castiel’s wrist. Castiel looks down at his hand, then back up at Dean as he nudges in closer and pulls him into a hug. “Yeah.”
“The sigils will hide you,” John says as he starts up the engine, looking back at him in the rearview mirror with wild eyes and a streak of Dean’s blood on his cheek. “We need to put them on every building we stay in from now on. Every car. We can’t take any more chances.”
Sam’s voice is distant, muffled, and for a moment Dean thinks he’s somehow answered a call without meaning to. But his phone is dark when he manages to focus on it, and when he taps the screen it only tells him he has dozens of missed calls spanning over the past several hours. Hours.
Castiel can’t hold back. He retches into the leaves, slumped onto the ground on his hands and knees, and wheezes in the cold once his stomach is empty and his throat is raw with the acidic burn of vomit.
“Just… something stupid I said. I can’t even remember it now,” he lies, and picks up a stick from the ground just to do something with his hands. He spins it around between his fingers a few times. Prods at the dry earth and draws a circle. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. If I’m being honest, it was all kind of boring.”
want to stay. But the last time we saw one another, when I was leaving to seal Heaven, you accepted it so easily.”
if given the chance, whether it interests him in theory or not—he can’t help but feel a smug sense of victory at the utterly speechless state he’s left Dean in.
“Um... actually. Maybe don’t scroll back too far. I had a friends-with-benefits thing with this cop named Victor back in Lawrence, and uh... well, let’s just say you won’t enjoy those pictures anywhere near as much as I did.”
The first to reach him is dead before her long-nailed fingers can fully grip his arm, eyes flaring blue as Castiel’s blade slides fluidly between her ribs.
Since they’d shipped out, Castiel had opened up to very few of his fellow troops, but Daniel had been good. Kind. A man who simply wanted to help, to be done with this godawful war so he could return home to his twin sister, Adina. When Daniel had learned of some of Castiel’s less commonly accepted qualities, he had promised not to breathe a word. Just clapped him on the shoulder and smiled with warmth.
With a sigh, he lifts the flight jacket onto his lap and looks it over again. It’s unlikely that he’ll ever track down someone related to Castiel, and though he’s sure the jacket would fetch an obscene amount of money were he to take it to an antiques dealer or an auction house, he can’t bear the thought of it ending up on display somewhere in a cold glass case. It’s stupid, but after spending his entire night reading about this man, he feels like selling the jacket would be a betrayal. He might not know Castiel, but he feels like he could have. Like if they were to have met, they would have been friends.
Dean still remembers the terrifying words he’d overheard while his parents talked over the potential risks in the kitchen late one night—
But most of all, he wants Castiel to take the burden of decision out of his hands. He wants to be freed from the pressure of making the right choices, of making any choices at all. He wants to trust Castiel to take care of him; wants Castiel to trust himself enough for the both of them.
To be completely blunt about it, Castiel has turned into an all out horndog in this fic entirely against my will and I have no fucking control over him.
“Perhaps some other time,” Castiel had offered, and Jianhong nodded, holding the book close to his chest before telling Castiel that he’d find something interesting for him to read on his next visit. Castiel had no intention to ever return, but he’d thanked him anyway before he finally latched on to what felt like it might be the right location and flew.
The chair where Cas had been sitting when Dean told him he couldn’t stay. The corner of the floor where Dean had almost killed him under the influence of the Mark of Cain; where he’d left an angel blade impaled in a book just inches from Cas’ face.
“No,” Dean says quickly, his expression panic-stricken as his grip tightens around Castiel’s hand. “Just— don’t—”
It only takes him a couple of minutes to find everything, but he takes his time anyway, hoping that Castiel will find a way to bring up the reason for their visit before he heads back into the living room. When he finally carries out a tray with the teapot and some cups, he finds Castiel crouched on the floor beside her chair, her hand gripping his tightly.
They’ve been silent now for long enough that Castiel has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about, and he turns his head to look at him, sitting cross-legged on the grass nearby.
“Not yet,” Castiel tells him, like Dean has any real choice in the matter, and Dean squeezes his hands more tightly together above his head. Sinks his teeth into his lower lip and breathes through his nose. It’s barely enough.
Disconcerted as he is, he doesn’t have much of an appetite, and only makes his way through half of the beans before he gives up and returns to the attic again. He searches every last inch. There’s nowhere for the man to have disappeared to, and no sign of this attached attic that he’d claimed to have come from.
With his mother’s encouragement, he applied to a community college just outside Normal that offered a course in fashion design and tailoring, and was accepted.
He should have realized sooner, now that he’s thinking about it. Dean had tried to end things with him the last time he came back. The time before, he hadn’t even meant to see Castiel at all.
“It barely hurts,” Castiel reassures him when he doesn’t say anything else, and Dean glances up with a doubtful look in his eye.
, and that only means it’ll hurt you both worse when it all blows up. You’ve gotta see that. Look at how miserable you both are when you fight with each other now, just as friends, and think how much worse that would be if you tried to be something more.”
He goes to the window, pulling the curtains wide before climbing out onto the fire escape.  A car parked across the narrow street is blaring music, what sounds like a string arrangement overlaid by a series of increasingly rapid beeps and a pounding drum beat. The sound makes his head ache. He wants a cigarette.
Normanby Avenue is flanked on both sides by sycamore trees, and the fallen clocks crunch under Dean’s feet when he steps from the car. Hannah’s house is set back from the road, casting a shadow over the slightly overgrown yard decorated with chipped garden gnomes and a dry terra-cotta birdbath.
John stops, and as he starts to turn, Dean lies back down sharply, his heart pounding hard enough that he can hear it.
Despite all his half-hearted blustering about personal space, Dean is a tactile person, and the moments when Castiel heals him are the moments when his heart is the most open. When he lets himself feel the way he feels without holding back, just for a breath or two. It’s enough. It’s always been enough.
This is the first time Dean has so much as mentioned any potential change to that plan, and it’s enough to make his chest feel tight.
He clambers down the ladder onto the landing at the top of the stairs, and when his feet hit the floor he looks down in confusion. Where there should be nothing but worn oak, there’s a floor runner with a pattern of blue and yellow flowers. The floorboards that peek out from beneath it are considerably less scuffed than they should be.
“But that doesn’t make any sense,” Sam is saying, brow raised as he looks from Jack back to Dean, and Dean wishes that he could just leave. Just lock himself in a room and let the dark consume him. “You were in trouble, what would he possibly—”
“I need to know,” Castiel says as he rests his hands on Dean’s chest to keep him where he is, “if you want to trust me with this tonight.”
“We’ll figure it out,” she tells him, then pulls back a little to catch his eye. “Can you give me five minutes?”
“I’m an angel,” Castiel says, hoping that will calm him down a little. It doesn’t. He’s not sure why he thought it might.
He’s almost asleep when it occurs to him that John never turns the radio on anymore, and it’s another glaring piece of evidence that the man behind the wheel is no longer his father. Not in any way that counts.
“I’ve actually, um... I’ve been trying to figure something out,” Dean says, shuffling down the bed and laying on his side to face Castiel across the pillow. “About this whole...”
Telling his dad about his plan was the only remaining hurdle. But before he could, near the end of Dean’s senior year, John’s heart gave out. Fresh out of school, Dean found himself signing up for the military in a misguided attempt at making his dead father proud.
Castiel arches with the sensation, so Dean does it again, again, until Castiel pulls him back to his lips.
“It was beautiful there. I hated how beautiful it was. The things that were happening, that I had to take part in… the lives lost. There was so much horror, but the forest was breathtaking.”
Shrugging, Dean pushes up from the mattress and heads for his still-packed duffel, digging through it until he finds the old first-aid kit inside. Though he’s making every effort to appear nonchalant, Castiel can see how much he needs to do this. How much he needs to do something. It’s there in the way he sorts through the contents of the kit, picking things out and reading labels before tossing them to the side; in the way he carefully sets the bandages he wants on his desk. He’s focused. Determined.
“I want to make you come,” Castiel says pointedly, pressing his fingers more firmly against Dean’s perineum, sliding them back until the tip of his middle finger catches at his rim. Dean arches into the feeling. “Just. Like.
Castiel hums around him, a deep sense of satisfaction settling in his chest at knowing he’s brought Dean this moment of joy, and slides down as far as he can before he swallows.
It’s been three days since Castiel woke up alone, and though he’s been trying to focus on other things, he’s been all but useless. It’s only when he goes to make something for a late lunch that he realizes the pantry is empty, and he drags himself downstairs and across to the general store. The proprietor, a woman named Nora, looks up at him with a smile when he walks inside.
He doesn’t mean to say it the same way that Sam did, to potentially expose his splintered heart, but once the words are out it’s too late to pull them back.
Dean’s stiff expression makes Castiel’s chest ache, and he can’t help but reach out to touch his hand where it still rests on the seat between them. Tension visibly drains from Dean’s shoulders. He shoots Castiel a grateful smile.
“Were you scared?” Dean asks finally, and Castiel lets himself look back at him. Dean’s brow is creased, and his eyes are wide with worry.
“I don’t expect anything from you. I never did before, and I certainly don’t now. But in the interest of fixing things, I think it’s important to lay all my cars on the table.”
“You’ve known for a whole day?” Castiel asks, surprising himself with how harshly he’s spoken, but neither of them seem offended. Ballard turns her patient gaze to him and smiles kindly.
“Yeah,” Dean says, and Castiel slips his thumb along his lower lip to hold him back when he tries to lean in again. “Yes.”
“It means that while I have some idea of how long a nephilim created by a less powerful angel might take to reach full term, a nephilim whose father is the archangel Lucifer is another thing entirely. Kelly could go into labor in three months or three days. We have no real way of knowing.”
It’s a little while later, as Castiel laying back on the ground and watching a satellite moving in a steady arc across the sky, that Dean takes the sort of breath that precedes a difficult question.
“Hey!” he shouts, his voice deep and startled, and Dean feels himself slowly turning bright red before he’s even had to face him. This is awkward as hell.
Dean lifts his brow, fixing Cas with a crooked grin that probably looks a lot more confident than he feels right now.
“Obviously, this isn’t something I think we should make a habit of doing,” Castiel says, ignoring Dean’s sarcasm. “But considering the fact that this nephilim could very easily destroy the world if we don’t find a way to deal with it in time, I think it’s reasonable to make some exceptions if need be. And don’t you think it would be wise to prepare this doctor in case another angel or demon finds out that Kelly reached out to him? Or if she contacts him again?”
“A hundred and twenty days,” Castiel says, and Dean stops counting. “Though, that’s assuming a full forty-eight hour period in your time, so if you visited a little earlier in the day it might be closer to a hundred.”
“Oh, um. She’s a World War II historian at the museum,” Sam says. “So what are you gonna do with the jacket?”
“How is this easier than just talking on the phone?” Dean asks in place of a greeting, and Sam rolls his eyes so emphatically that Dean can see it despite the dismal image quality.
Suddenly, it’s not enough. He pushes at Dean’s shoulder with his free hand, flipping them over and working Dean’s jeans down and out of the way so he can see what he’s doing. The sight makes him lightheaded, his heart pounding, and though he’s just barely recovered from his own climax he feels his cock give a feeble twitch as he takes in Dean’s state.
Dean looks away from John, his head swimming as he tries to wrap his head around the incomprehensible realities of the past few hours. John killed Mary. He tried to kill Sam. He might have killed Cas. Everyone Dean loves,
“You like that?” Dean asks, a little breathless, and licks over the head again. “The thought of me waiting?”
, he thinks to himself. The countless stories planted in his head by Metatron have been largely useless, but in this instance, they’ve finally given him some insight.
“I’ll still apply, okay? I’m still gonna try. But like… I’ve gotta be realistic or I’m gonna lose it.” His jaw twitches as he looks out the window at the passing landscape. “I’ve been looking around, and there’s this trade school in Wichita that has a whole course on restoring classic cars, so I dunno. Maybe that could be a cool back up plan. Bobby’s trained me well enough that I already know I’d be an okay mechanic, so I could probably keep taking shifts with him if I wanted. I’ve just been thinking about it.”
To save himself from choosing, he pulls up the box closest to him, and sits down on the floor to dig through it, sorting the contents into trash and donations, with one significantly smaller pile he’s calling finders keepers.
Shuffling forward, Dean reaches for him, but Cas shakes his head again. Dean settles his hands on Cas’ waist instead. Thumbs at the smooth skin of his hip, where the dark Enochian script of his tattoo stands out in the dim light.
“I definitely appreciate it. Don’t think I’ve seen this design before, either. Eileen’s gonna flip.”
Grunting with effort, he drags it out into a patch of slanted afternoon sunlight in front of the mirror and uses Henry’s screwdriver to pry the latch. It opens with a groan, and Dean’s mouth falls open when he looks inside.
“We’ve been asked to go meet with his trauma therapist,” Ellen says. “We can come back after, give you a ride—?”
“Was just thinking… I should show you how to look after it sometime. Teach you how to change the tires, check the oil, buff out dents and scratches.”
“As for a fact about rabbits,” Castiel goes on, pleased when Dean’s laugh shifts into something that can only be described as delighted. “I don’t have a strange fact to share, but I recently discovered a family of cottontails living in the field behind the bunker. They tend to hide when they hear the Impala coming, but I think they’re rather fond of me. I can show them to you sometime if we go on foot.”
“Shut up,” he says, trying—and failing—to glare at Castiel, and Castiel just grins wider, sidestepping the loose stones and making his way down to the road with ease.
Dean doesn’t respond to the question directly; just looks at Castiel with a determination in his eyes that leaves no room for misunderstanding, and says, “I’m going to bed. You should come with me.”
He gestures toward the headboard, and Castiel does as he asks, shuffling to lean against it. It’s only when it digs into his shoulders that he glances back to find that it’s been made from half of an old wagon wheel, fixed to the wall. It’s just tacky enough to be absurd, and Castiel looks back at Dean to see him eyeing it with humor.
. A witch. A good witch,” she hurries to add, eyes wide, and they both nod. “There were still many in those days, practicing folk magic.”
He hesitates, then, his hand resting on the back of one of the kitchen chairs as he weighs up the risks of telling Dean why. Dean seems to sense his uncertainty. He pats him firmly on the shoulder.
Heat floods Dean’s skin from his chest to the tips of his ears, and he stares at Cas in combined rapture and mortification. Because his thoughts had been nothing less than filthy, but Cas is saying he wants to
“It’s been so long, I thought... I thought you weren’t...” Castiel sighs, though it sounds closer to a sob. “Ten months, Dean. I didn’t think I’d see you again.”
“He asked me not to say anything,” Jack hurries to add, snapping Dean out of his spiraling thoughts. “He thought it would only make you worry, and that there wasn’t any risk because the Empty said it would only take him when he let himself be happy, and he… he didn’t think that would happen.”
“Your eyebrows keep twitching,” he tells Dean placidly, ignoring the part of him that wants to drop the act and give in, time sensitivity of the case be damned. “Are you low on potassium?”
‘Another universe’ isn’t an abstract concept anymore, which is the truly fucked up part. He’s known for a while now that there are copies on copies on copies, but before this latest nightmare he had still been able to think of the other worlds as completely separate to their own. But now… who knows how many times Chuck has tortured him, tortured all of them, before this go around.
“Honestly,” Dean starts, and stops, and takes another breath. “Honestly, I don’t think I can stand to work a case with him yet. He said some really messed up shit to me last night.
While Dean tells him in detail about the Advanced Diploma of Vintage Restoration, Castiel finds himself wondering why he hadn’t mentioned it sooner. He sounds excited about it. Like maybe it’s not so much a back-up plan as it is something he’s actively looking forward to.
“Are you saying you don’t want to set up camp next to that incredibly normal-looking man?” Castiel asks, gesturing to their left, where a man his grandfather’s age is sitting on a fold out chair in a pair of lime-green Speedos and an acid-wash denim jacket, picking his teeth with the tip of a hunting knife. As they both glance over at him, the man hocks and spits into his fire pit.
Henriksen’s lips twitch, his eyes dropping away for a moment, and Castiel gets the distinct impression that he wishes he didn’t have to be the bearer of this particular piece of news.
The coffee is burnt and bitter, the particles rearranged into a pattern that makes him wrinkle his nose, and he adds an unreasonable amount of sugar to counter the taste. When he takes another sip, he thinks of Nora back at the Gas N’ Sip in Idaho, constantly confused as to how they could possibly need to refill the sugar packets already.
The flight jacket is the first thing his eyes fall upon, and he reaches out to touch the red thread. He’s almost certain that if he were to complete the circle now it would bring him to Dean, but worries that if he did, then Dean would not have been able to do it in the first place. They may never have met. The paradox gives him a headache to think of, and he sighs as he closes the closet.
“You take care, now,” Henry tells him. “If my mother finds out that you’re feeling unwell, you’ll never get rid of her.”
“Don’t,” Dean says, eyes bright with mirth. “Just—whatever innuendo you were about to attempt, just. Don’t.”
Of course, that presents the problem of whether or not he can trust his feelings for the guy at all. Especially considering the fact that if Dean didn’t love Cas, he would never have grown to love Jack, and his mom would still be alive and kicking.
“Big shower,” Dean calls out a moment later, voice slightly muffled through the wall. Castiel looks toward the bathroom with a frown.
So, while he doesn’t know if he’ll ever be able to appreciate food in quite the same way Dean does, he thinks he can make a point of signalling his enjoyment of other things. Making himself comfortable even if it’s not completely necessary; speaking his happiness aloud when he can.
Dean’s overconfidence might be tiresome when he jokingly applies it to his own more obnoxious qualities, but Castiel can’t deny that it makes him feel incredibly good when Dean directs it toward him. Sometimes, he thinks about the fact that Dean always seems his most sincere when they’re alone and he’s encouraging Castiel, and has to take a few deep breaths to keep from going out of his mind with the happy-giddy-wild feeling it instills in him.
“You know the most fucked up thing? I had the thought today—just for a second, but… I had the thought that you could just make him forget he ever knew.” Dean doesn’t look back at Castiel when he says it. He doesn’t need to. Castiel can sense the shame rolling off of him like heat waves from a desert highway. “Maybe he’s right. Maybe I’m not cut out for this relationship shit. One bump in the road and my first instinct is to ask you to mindwipe my own brother.”
The walk back to camp is exhausting in the eighty degree weather, and when their tent comes back into view through the trees, Castiel can’t help but groan in relief. His own stomach started grumbling halfway back, and the thought of the meal they’re about to prepare has his mouth watering before they’ve even re-built the fire.
As he watches, Dean stretches his neck, his gaze turned away from Castiel toward a stretch of pine on the gentle slope beyond the water. Dappled sunlight filters through the leaves above him, making him look like one of Mary’s paintings. Castiel finds himself wishing he’d asked to borrow her camera.
“It’s an injury,” Dean cuts in, “compared to my complete lack of an injury. Only makes sense for you to be the one to keep an eye on Corey Hart over there while I take care of the, uh… heavy lifting.”
“To answer your original question, though… I was smiling because I was imagining myself as a sunflower,” he admits, and Dean lets out another, wheezier laugh that Castiel chooses to interpret as affectionate. “And you as the sun I’m drawn to.”
“I have vegetables. But all these spices--Dean, you don’t know how much I’ve missed spices. And chocolate. And
“Mm. Well, lucky for us, he’d heard she was missing, so he played along, agreed to meet with her, then reported the call. That’s how Nance got wind of it.”
He wants to know how to break the spell. He wants to go back. Dean feels so selfish for his heartbreak that it makes him feel physically ill, and he tightens his grip on the steering wheel as he aims them toward Normal. By the time they’re close, only fifteen minutes from the welcoming sight of North Street, Dean realizes that he has to let Castiel go.
“You sound incredibly certain for someone who supposedly isn’t even convinced that we’ll make it out of this world alive.”
is one of a hundred and eight Boeing B-17’s flying into Warsaw, protected by a handful of Mustang fighters as they deliver supplies to the city. It’s a risky mission--they’re flying over occupied territory in broad daylight, for one thing--but the situation in the Polish capital is dire, and the knowledge that things will only get worse without their help makes it a little easier to push through the ever-present fear and get the job done.
It might be too late for him and Cas, but he’ll be damned if he lets his sacrifice be for nothing. He’s going to love the people he has left as fully as he can.
His hair is damp at the edges, as though he’s just washed his face. His eyes seem dull; his expression drawn.
Dean grinds to a shuddering halt at the sound, and for a moment, he looks at Castiel like he’s his old self again. Like he’s second guessing himself for doing this. Like he’s worried he’s hurting Castiel somehow.
“Okay, it says it’s scanning,” Dean says after several minutes of back-and-forth, and Castiel hears Sam’s muffled voice respond.
“You want to blow up the ghosts?” Rowena asks, her tone arch enough to make the whole situation seem a little less dire, just for a moment, and Sam almost laughs. Dean just frowns harder, wondering where the hell his brother is going with this.
But just for a few minutes, kneeling in that storeroom, he’d thought that perhaps this was the night. That Dean would make his move. That he’d summon the courage to make a move himself.
Outside, the traffic on I-74 slows a little, two lanes haphazardly merging into one to avoid a broken down camper in the center lane ahead. A tow truck slowly makes its way closer among the rest of the cars. Castiel flicks the indicator on. The steady tick-tick-tick counts out the seconds, punctuating the quiet as his words settle around them.
Mr Wyatt smiles, and Castiel is saved from any further small talk by Sam and Jo stepping out of the elevator with Sam’s girlfriend Jess pressed to his side, her arm linked tightly around his elbow.
Before Castiel can reply, the waitress is back, delivering Dean’s breakfast with an embarrassed look on her face that can only mean she overheard the last part of their conversation.
Regret weighs heavily on Castiel’s shoulders as he thinks of her. He can’t imagine what she must be going through. He’s no stranger to the pain of learning that what had seemed like a moment of tender connection was in fact, cold-blooded manipulation, but he never had to carry a reminder of that betrayal with him. Thanks to Gadreel, he didn’t even have a scar.
“See? Cas doesn’t mind,” Dean says, and puts the mug back down before he squeezes Castiel’s shoulder. “What’re you reading?”
“Are you saying I’m too weak to carry you?” Castiel asks with a raised brow, but there’s an amused tilt to his mouth. “I’ll have you know I’m in excellent shape.”
He knows flirting with Castiel is a terrible idea, but he just can’t seem to help himself. Castiel frowns, clearly not parsing Dean’s meaning right away, and Dean sighs with mock offence.
He doesn’t feel as though he’s going mad, and yet it’s the most reasonable possibility. Tapping his pencil on the paper, he chews on his lip. The record stops playing, and Castiel stands to lift it from the turntable, sliding it back into the slipcover.
When Dean answers, he sounds drunk. He also sounds like he’s smiling, and that thought makes Cas' own lips twitch up at the corners. Even if he can’t be there to see it, it pleases him to think that Dean is in good spirits.
He wants to tell Cas to leave him alone. To let him sit with everything that’s happened this past week and wrap his head around it. Give him time. Give him space. But Cas seems determined to talk it out now, and the black hole of rage in Dean’s chest is still there, seething. He can’t seem to keep from feeding it.
The expression on his face is so alight with love that Castiel isn’t sure that Dean even needs to open his soul any further to show him how he feels.
“We have our work cut out for us,” John says, peering over the steering wheel at the house. He sounds so casual about it, as though he hasn’t been alternating between deathly silence and unintelligible rambling for the past week. “We’ll do a quick sweep, then you can secure the building while I get us what we need to stay here a while.”
“Leave it!” he shouts when Dean steps out from behind the tree and moves toward the house to grab his backpack. “They’re coming!”
It’s just easier to grit his teeth and endure the pain as John carves shallow symbols into Dean’s skin.
As he lies curled on his side in his sleeping bag, waiting for sleep to pull him under, the faint sound of Dean strumming the opening bars of
The guilt of that realization isn’t something he can stand to look at too closely. Dean doesn’t know how he has room for all the different kinds of guilt inside of him, but every single thing sits like a stone, heavy in his gut.
“It’s ending in tears right now,” she points out, and Dean sniffs, wiping his eyes again as he looks away. “you’re just going to ignore this? Never see him again?”
Pushing to his feet, Dean takes a few steps away before turning back to look at Castiel, his hands tense at his sides, clenching into fists and releasing, over and over as though he needs the movement to keep from… something. Castiel isn’t sure what. But his eyes are pleading. Begging Castiel to meet him halfway.
, he tells himself, and pushes out of bed, shuffling to the closet and pulling the doors wide. It would have been unreasonable to ask him to. Maybe even cruel.
Hands twisting in his pockets, Dean plasters on a smile that Castiel doesn’t buy for a second and tilts his head in the direction of his house.
“So. Last night,” Sam starts a few minutes later, as Dean starts mixing. The whisk sings against the sides of the metal bowl. “That was a lot.”
“C’mere,” Dean says, pushing himself half-up on one elbow, and when Castiel does, Dean draws him into a slow, lazy kiss. When he pulls away, his expression is loose and happy. It warms Castiel to see, and he kisses him once more before settling beside him.
“This is going to sound ridiculous,” Dean calls out, kneeling to lean over the edge as the top of the man’s head comes into view below the ladder, “but I think our attics are joined. I guess I went through the wrong hatch.”
“It’s been following us since Nebraska,” he says, eyeing the minivan and gripping the steering wheel with tense, bruised knuckles. “It switched hosts, but it’s the same one. I can see its teeth.”
Ballard had been the lead detective on Dean’s case, right up until Henriksen took over, and at the sound of their voices echoing out to where he stands, Castiel feels his reaction to being here again grow all the more visceral.
“I was about to make a pot,” she insists, and as if to confirm it, a kettle begins to whistle in the kitchen.
He’s exhausted by it. Tired beyond any definition he could even describe. The thought of pushing Cas away and testing the strength of their relationship against the pressure of Chuck’s interference goes against everything that he wants, everything that he needs to stay at least relatively sane, but it’s like he’s stuck on a track that he can’t climb off of.
“If this is making things more difficult--” Dean starts, and Castiel shakes his head before Dean can get any further.
“Yes, you usually substituted with some reference to my ‘feathery ass’,” Castiel says, and Dean snorts a low laugh. A little of the tension seems to leave him with it. “But it was a clear sign off on a formal prayer, all the same.”
Staring at him now, Castiel knows exactly what Dean’s struggling to verbalize, and his stomach flips wildly. For a brief moment, he’s overcome with almost giddy anticipation; if Dean is finally trying to tell him what he
“First things first, though,” he says. His hand slides down to cup Castiel’s jaw, thumb sweeping under his lip before he stands and steps back. “I’m gonna grab a shower—by myself seeing as
. He’s awaiting further instruction. Waiting, again, for Dean to tell him what he wants. Making him work for it.
, he thinks suddenly, but the thought cuts off almost as abruptly as it came, and when he kneels beside the tub to test the temperature of the water, he feels the uneven tile digging into his knees, and it feels about as real as anything else he’s ever felt.
He moves ahead, dropping to a knee to slide a record from it’s sleeve. He blows invisible dust from its surface before he sets it on the turntable, and the low crackle of the speakers is overlapped by the rhythmic piano of a blues song.
try to return to his own time by breaking the spell, but it didn’t work. Maybe he doesn’t actually want to see Dean.
Maybe somewhere, deep down, the good parts of him—the parts that loved music and baseball and Mary—are still there. Maybe there’s still a chance that he could come back from this.
“No,” he says, too fast and firm to be convincing. His eyes dart to the floor, the wall—anywhere to avoid looking at Dean or Castiel directly. “She hasn’t called again.”
“Your brother sent me,” Belphegor says, finally, sounding more put-upon than he has any business being. “A few of those hunters you called turned up. He’s going with them to start clearing out the bodies.”
Grabbing a camera from a shelf in the studio, Mary follows them out into the front yard and takes several Polaroids of them loading everything into the truck, and more still once they climb inside.
Still, he hasn’t gone this long without sleep since Purgatory, and that’s not something he wants to think about. The last thing he needs is for his internal organs to give out halfway through saving the world because he didn’t bother to catch four hours of shut eye when he had the chance.
“Something about how he ‘understands now’ that asking me to be with him was unfair or something. Like, he thought I was just offering myself to him because he had no place else to go. But that… I told him I wanted to be with him. Even when I went back the last time before he came here, I was-- shit.
He saw it the second that she said thank you as she’d looked at the track list. It was the same kind of thank you that he’d given to his grandparents when they gave him a Jefferson Starship album for Christmas.
Avoiding the obscenely large amount of money Dean has left him, Castiel digs through Dean’s pantry. One peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich later, he slips the money Dean left for him into his pocket, along with the spare key, and heads for the door.
In the library with Metatron, he’d known the name for this kind of vivid association immediately, thanks to the unceremonious delivery of every book, film, and TV show into his mind a year earlier, but he’d been too preoccupied with the discovery of his long-lost grace to think too deeply on it.
The door slams in their faces before either of them can say another word, and Castiel can hear Parker rushing off into his house to call his wife. He looks over at Dean.
“Agata,” Castiel says immediately. “I don’t know her last name, but she lived in a Polish village called Sieraków during the war. Her husband was named Bartłomiej. They’d... I don’t know if they’d still be alive. But they had a daughter named Hannah.”
Dean’s not sure if Castiel is saying it to insult the song, or if he’s just genuinely confused, so he nods.
“I’ll make it up to you tomorrow,” Dean tells him, sitting down beside him and warming his hands over the fire. “Found a good spot about ten minutes away, though—there’s a pretty big drop off about eight feet out, plus there’s plenty of cover, and I saw a couple of birds circling overhead before it got too dark, so there’s definitely
“Go a bit further,” Dean says when a few campsites start to appear a little ways out from the road. “Try and find a spot away from everyone else.”
is an afternoon in Bobby’s garage with Cas, working together to clear the blocked EGR valve on Cas’ truck while the staticky radio echoed and buzzed from its place on the grease-stained workbench.
Dean gives a jerky nod, avoiding Castiel’s gaze and instead fixing his sights on the floor between them. He looks so small. So scared of Castiel’s answer that he’s shrinking into his frame like a child, and it makes every part of Castiel revolt.
Even though the dreams began years after Dean went missing, he’d always looked the same as he had before—sixteen and sunkissed, his hair short and intentionally tousled, his grin crooked and beautiful. In his dreams, Castiel would pull Dean into his arms and hold him as though he could make up for all the time he was gone through the power of touch alone.
His knuckles brush Cas’ skin as he works the buckle open, then the button and zipper behind it, and between one moment and the next his hand slips through the open fly and tugs down his underwear. Cas is already half-hard, and the weight of him in Dean’s hand has his own cock pulsing in sympathy as he strokes him slow from base to tip, thrilled by the way Cas bucks into his palm like it was made for him.
Daniel is shouting something at him as he struggles with the harness on his flak suit, but the interphone is a mess of garbled static, and the sound of rushing wind and the roar of the single remaining engine as it works overtime drowns out whatever it is he’s saying.
But John had pulled him to his feet, and hugged him tightly as he thanked a God he’d never believed in for keeping Dean safe from the demon that had been trying to take him.
The tear on the front is sewn up flawlessly, but on the breast around his name, three-quarters of a circle has been stitched in red. A short length of thread hangs from the end. He touches it with his thumb.
Whether they’re ready or not, it’s past time to face this head on. Tomorrow morning. He’ll invite Dean to take a drive—the car is the best place for this conversation, he thinks, because when Dean inevitably panics, neither of them will have the option to run away—and they’ll talk.
“It was pretty basic prenatal stuff. Ultrasound. Vitals. Whoever they are, they just want to make sure Kelly is healthy.” He pauses. Makes a face. “Well, that the
Climbing back inside, he finds Cas before the open closet with the flight jacket in his hands, running his fingers over the unfinished red circle. He looks up at the identical jacket that Dean is wearing, eyes drawn to the completed stitches, before looking back at the jacket in his hands.
--the sensation paired with the joy of knowing Dean is content is enough to send him tumbling over the edge.
“It’s not a rumor,” Dean tells him, raising his brow. “It’s true. They have to print it on the packet and everything.”
“Both,” Dean says, and takes the offered packages. It’s nowhere near as satisfying as a meal they caught themselves, but it’s ready in minutes, and right now that’s good enough.
“I’ll write him back,” Dean says, and pulls his phone from its place in the console. Castiel doesn’t ask what he’s typing; just starts up the car and carefully pulls out of the gas station, following the signs to get back onto US-110.
At some point between Dean falling asleep at nearly one in the morning, and stopping to refill the Impala’s gas tank at the Pennsylvania-Maryland border around half-past four, Castiel’s thoughts of satisfaction and contentment had turned to the way Dean and Sam live. How they save the world constantly, but rarely savor it.
The tree has no low branches for Castiel to climb, no way for him to reach his friend and cut him down. He can’t even get his tags to return to Adina. He’s not even sure of where she lives.
Castiel takes several more photos of him looking flustered and disgruntled, and sends them to Claire before sliding his phone back into his pocket.
More than anything, though, Dean’s mind is sticking on the one question he can’t ever hope to answer: was Chuck’s manipulation limited to the world around them—the maze Dean had described to Sam, where Chuck built an obstacle course and set them loose like lab rats—or were
Castiel isn’t entirely sure that he knows who Kate Winslet is, but as he pushes out of bed and gathers the rest of his clothes, he mentally adds it to the list of references he needs to look up when time allows. He’s been doing that more, recently—taking note of all of Dean’s strange little turns of phrase and entering them into his phone’s web search until he can figure them out.
There’s a hawk perched on the sign. As they draw closer, a peal of thunder rolls over them, and the hawk leaps into the air, wings spread wide. John swerves onto the median as though he’s under attack, the truck fishtailing wildly as he veers onto a nameless side road. South. They’re headed south, now. Dean repeats the direction in his head a few times in the hope that holding on to this one thing, the direction in which they’re driving, will keep him sane until he can find some way to save himself.
. It’s ridiculous that anyone should wear so many layers, and he tells Dean as much as he watches him stagger loose-limbed from the bed to pull his socks off.
Dean winks, clearly making some joke, and Castiel squints until he figures out what he’s implying. He raises his brow.
“I did,” Dean points out, then sighs. Pulling out his cell phone, he drops it on the table between them. “But you’re determined, so take a look. I took some pictures.”
Castiel’s breath catches, and he strains hard against Dean’s hand, braced around his chin as though he’s worried Castiel might not stay upright without it. He tilts his head to open his mouth against it. Digs his teeth in, just a little, while Dean works him open. Faster and deeper with every push.
“That’s gonna be a good angle,” Dean jokes, and tightens his arms around Castiel when he feels him laugh. Castiel takes a third picture. Dean’s chest aches.
The ritual Hannah described seems simple enough--a few herbs bundled together into a smudge stick and waved over the jacket while Castiel repeats a string of Polish that Dean couldn’t remember if his life depended on it--but a few of the herbs were things Dean’s never heard of before, and though Hannah assured them that they’d find most at the supermarket, one was going to take a special supplier.
The ground is steep and rocky beside the bunker, and by the time it levels out Dean is breathing heavily. A little way ahead, through the sparse trees, Cas can make out the shapes of Sam and Mary and Claire, and two other women who he guesses must be Jody and Alex. They’ve set up a small fire pit, and from here Cas has to focus to hear them talking. Mary is telling Claire and Alex about the first concert she ever attended. Jody is whispering something to Sam that would make Cas blush if he let his guard down. As he glances over at Dean, catching him staring right back, he’s tempted to do just that.
Watching him edge closer, Castiel sees the slightest hint of his nerves returning, and it’s enough to ground him. To make him want to make Dean blush and laugh and flirt, to tease Castiel back until he’s forgotten why he was embarrassed to begin with. Shifting up on his elbows and trying not to let Dean’s hand pull the words out of reach, he lifts an eyebrow in Dean’s direction.
The phone keeps buzzing, and buzzing, and buzzing, and he doesn’t pick it up, but it doesn’t matter. Whatever Sam has to tell him, Dean can’t help him. Either he’s calling because his attempts at protecting their friends has failed, or he’s calling because he’s saved everyone.
“Anyway, don’t worry about it,” he says, reaching over to close the screen with one hand. “We can check when we stop for lunch. We’re probably about two hours out from Monroe City.”
It’s still worse on his days off. Today, it’s just gone eleven in the morning and he’s still not dressed. He’s down to the last dregs of his instant coffee, and as he sits at his spindly kitchen table he forces his mind from Dean for the third time in an hour, and wonders if it’s time he started to give some serious thought to what he’s going to do with the rest of his life.
More footsteps. Another clatter. Another thud. Dean watches as a mote of dust descends from the ceiling, slow, slow, slow, and thinks of pink fibres that burned against his skin, a lifetime ago. An attic that felt too cramped and dry.
With the airport in Damascus indefinitely closed, he arrives via boat from Cyprus, standing uncomfortably beside the captain as they approach the shore by cover of night. He swims the last mile alongside a handful of rebels, and helps them remain unseen as they scurry onto land. As difficult as his own journey is going to be, he knows that theirs will likely be worse.
He’s noticed that Cas has been doing that sort of thing more, lately. Leaning, sitting, fixing his hair in the rearview. Little things. Human things. Dean’s also been trying
“I think Dean isn’t. He’s not wired for commitment. Every time he’s tried, it all falls apart, and everyone gets hurt. I wouldn’t want that for either of you.”
“This any good?” he asks. It’s a fairly obvious attempt to change the subject, and Castiel appreciates it, even if his own response is lacking.
“Yeah, you’ve got your work cut out for you there,” he says, then turns serious. “And I— listen, I meant it when I said I’m okay with you staying. I’ve missed you, too. But Dean… look, he’ll be pissed I told you, but when the angels fell and you went missing? He was a mess, Cas. That first month, he barely slept. Barely ate. I couldn’t get him to work a case if his life depended on it. And even when I did finally get him out of the bunker… it took months for him to start acting like himself again. He was
He loved the process of taking an engine apart and putting it back together. He loved cars, period. But the memory of that short week in his youth stayed in the back of his mind, and all through his shifts at Winchester Auto, Dean daydreamed about the little shop in Normal.
“Mm, I guess,” Dean agrees, and crosses his arms over his chest, rocking on his heels. “So, what’s the other kind?”
“It’s just… I called him yesterday,” Sam says after a moment. “Phone went straight to voicemail, and he didn’t call back. Then this morning I sent him two texts, and… nothing. Did he say where he was going?”
“Does she think the sculpture has a skeleton inside of it?” Castiel asks with humor, and Dean huffs.
For a moment, Castiel just listens to Dean breathe. Slow and measured, trying to calm himself down as he presses his hands over his eyes, thumbs rubbing at his temples.
The obvious topic is so big it’s overwhelming, but everything else seems too trivial to mention. Castiel knows he needs to mention Dean’s condition before they arrive at the hospital, but he knows Jo will ask too many questions, and doesn’t want to make Sam any more nervous than he already is.
He has to start over multiple times, discarded drafts piling up in his wastepaper basket every time he accidentally says too much, but finally he’s satisfied. He seals the letter in an envelope, pries up the corner of the carpet with a tire iron, wedges the envelope underneath, then carefully nails it back down.
The last time he felt anything like this was shortly after he’d started training to become an airline pilot. Balthazar had been another student, and they’d been good friends right up until Castiel pushed him away. He’d been protecting himself from heartbreak, so certain that he was falling for the unavailable man that he felt it necessary to cease spending time with him.
He knows he sounds whiny, like a petulant little kid, but he can’t help himself. He feels like an idiot for falling for the guy in the first place. Charlie prods him with her sword.
It seems to take forever to reach the right floor. Castiel is certain it didn’t take this long the first time, but his memory of the day is a complete jumble. A glance at the clock on the elevator tells him it’s barely been three hours since the phone rang in the garage and tilted his world on its axis, but it feels like a week.
Thankfully, Dean opts to save his swimming for the following day and scouts out a good fishing spot while Castiel gets the fire going. He takes his fishing rod with him, just in case.
For a long moment, they just look at one another, and then Dean walks back into the bathroom. He doesn’t slam the door this time, but he does shut it. Castiel hears a lock snick into place a few seconds later. A dull thud and a hush of fabric as Dean leans against it and slides down to sit on the floor.
Castiel’s body is at war; pleasure building to a crest with every drag of Dean’s cock inside him, as a growing horror settles in his throat at the thought that maybe this is as good as it gets.
Staring down at the steering lock, Dean feels tears welling and spilling over against his will, and doesn’t notice John climbing back into the car until it’s too late. He catches hold of Dean’s arm, and Dean cries out as shards of splintered bone grind against each other, digging into the already damaged flesh.
,” Dean sighs, and Cas draws his hips back before rocking slowly forward. The pace he sets is so measured that Dean could weep. He feels every inch; the stretch, the slide, the heat of him.
Now, he wonders now how many times he’s unwittingly let Chuck force his hand because the stakes hadn’t seemed all that high, because he hadn’t recognized that the compulsion, the anger, the righteousness was coming from someplace outside of himself.
“Alright. Well, I’m emailing you everything I could get my hands on. The doctor’s address, a couple of police reports, some CCTV footage. It’s not a lot, but—”
His phone, inching across the concrete floor; his back, radiating pain where it collided with the wall; his trembling hands, his chest, his every last cell screaming out like a swarm of enraged hornets.
up to. He just sinks lower into his seat and shuts his eyes, listening to the steady thrum of tires over asphalt.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean says at last, and looks back at Castiel. His hands shift at his sides, shoulders raising slightly in the prelude to a hug that never comes. “Try to get some rest on the way, yeah?”
He heads into the kitchen, flicking on the coffee pot and pulling out a mug before he walks back through the bedroom.
notice it for a while, and right now… well. Cas doesn’t get to be human right now, and Dean sure as hell doesn’t get to enjoy watching him. There’s no time for this. They have work to do.
They’ll talk, at last, and Dean will either tell him that he does not want to pursue the feelings that Castiel knows he has, or he’ll decide to take a chance. Castiel dearly hopes for the latter. He’s prepared for the former.
“So it’s pretty much a straight-shot east,” he says, leaning forward over the steering wheel to check for traffic before he turns left onto US-36. “There’s a diner I like just outside Munroe City that should work for lunch, assuming it’s still there. Best Gerber sandwich I ever had, hands down. Or there’s this real good burger place in Hannibal. Always remembered it ’cause the name makes you think twice about what’s in the patty.”
“It’s an incredibly long and complicated story, but the archangel Michael is intent on bringing an apocalyptic war to this world. The ritual I intend to carry out will give me and my friends the means to stop him, and we need fruit from the tree of life to complete it.” He glances back at the charred tree, empty of leaves or fruit. “But it seems that we’ll need to find a new way. What happened?”
He focuses on the pain in his badly-healed wrist instead of thinking about it. It's easier that way. He can still move his fingers, so he thinks he’s just going to have a permanent physical reminder of the night he wishes he could forget.
Castiel is in the garage when the phone rings, flat on his back beneath a jacked-up ’87 Honda Civic that’s in desperate need of more work than he thinks it’s really worth. The radiant heater on the garage wall emits a semi-circle of searing heat that stops before it reaches the car he’s working on, so though his legs feel practically on fire, his fingers are numb as he loosens the screws holding the rusted fuel intake manifold in place. He ignores the phone, gritting his teeth as the last stubborn screw refuses to turn. Finally, it loosens.
Right now, he’s making his way through a dense slice of German chocolate cake. As he methodically chews each molecule-flavored mouthful, he tries to recall the taste he’d enjoyed so much when he’d had occasion to try a cupcake sample at a market shortly after his arrival in Rexford.
“Okay,” he says, a dim hope unfurling in his chest at the thought that he might still be able to help Castiel track this man down. “Thanks for the help, Sammy.”
Dean does, but the air still reeks of that same bitter ozone that’s been lingering since the Empty ripped a hole into their home, only now it’s mingling with the sour stench of vomit, and it only makes it worse. His stomach lurches.
“Too long,” Cas agrees, and stares down at the table. It’s scuffed and worn, like everything else in this room. “I wish I’d understood. I’d much rather be there.”
His best chance at success, he knows, is de-escalation. Even if it weren’t, he’d still rather not fight them. Not here. Not when there’s already so much violence soaked into the earth of this place.
Not a pawn, or a tool, or a weapon in some Heavenly arsenal, but just himself. Just Castiel. An angel of the earth, on wheels instead of wings. An angel who stopped seeking revelation in God when he found it in the man to his right. An angel who has fallen in every way but the proverbial, because he didn’t so much fall in love as grow into it.
The record slip cover, the old turntable he’d had in his room, the rough edge of the half-price sale sticker that he could never quite peel free. The cassette deck he’d sat before for hours as he—
He winks at Castiel as he says it, though they both know full well that Dean is intending on eating the whole lot himself.
“Not exactly, but I uh. It was a medical facility, and I’m not a hundred percent sure, but I think it was at the zoo?”
He gestures toward the mass of maroon fabric in Charlie’s arms, and her expression brightens as she dumps the lot on the counter, narrowly missing his empty mug.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, and Castiel drops the paper bag of groceries on the floor, finally recovering enough to walk. Dean meets him in the middle, pulling him close, and for a while they just hold one another. Quiet and warm.
He thinks of Dean’s face back by the campfire as Castiel had healed him, and of Dean’s prayer, and knows exactly how to do it. Flattening his hand on Dean’s stomach, fingers spread wide, he holds Dean’s gaze.
Laughing, Dean shakes his head, tossing the towel back into the bathroom before he crosses the room to rifle through his duffel at Castiel’s side.
he thinks, in a distant kind of way, as John weaves from street to street, highway to highway. Eventually the sun bleaches the edges of the clouded sky. Dean blinks, bleary, and realizes they’re headed west just before he catches sight of a sign announcing their imminent arrival in Amarillo, Texas. He’s not sure when they crossed the state border. John has changed direction so many times that he’s not even sure how many state borders they’ve crossed.
calendar that he’d put up in 1994, that nobody had been able to bring themselves to take down when the new year ticked over. The scuff on the back wall where, at fifteen, he’d backed Bobby’s enormous Ford F-350 slightly too far. Even the Craftsman tool set that Castiel uses every single day is technically Dean’s—a Christmas gift that Castiel had been paying off for months before that awful day in October, planned since the day Dean had told him that he’d decided to go to trade school and learn to restore classics.
His back is bowing, legs shaking, and as he stares at Cas he wonders how he got to be so damn lucky.
Dean slips his hand over Castiel’s wrist and down to his fingers, squeezing them, encouraging Castiel to grip his hair the way he wants to. It’s only a moment before he does, and Dean ducks back down to trace kisses across his hips, to tease at his waistband. When he sinks lower still to mouth at Castiel through thin cotton, Castiel gasps and tugs at Dean’s hair.
In any other circumstance, he might be ashamed of himself for taking advantage of Dean’s temporary stupor to gain the upper hand, but here, now, he’s willing to overlook it. He flips their positions swiftly, moves down Dean’s body, and slides his mouth over Dean’s straining cock before Dean knows what’s happening.
On some level, he’s aware that the dehydration and hunger are probably making his mind slip again—it’s happened before, when he’s been sick and feverish, exhausted from blood loss, from lack of sun or mental stimulation, too much salt and not enough sustenance—but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
“Please, come in,” she steps aside, ushering them into her living room. There’s a general sense of clutter around the place, and as Hannah shuffles her way to a well-used armchair, Dean can see why. Though she still seems to have all her wits about her, she’s hunched over at the waist, and he guesses arthritis is taking it’s toll.
Castiel stares out the window at the squat brick building that hasn’t been updated since the mid-seventies, and he feels
he’d found during a rare window of downtime last year. They’d all just been passing time, sorting through one of the bunker’s storerooms, and Dean—high-spirited and several beers deep after a successful salt-and-burn—had laughed so hard he’d cried.
For a long few moments, Sam studies his face as though he’s going to see something more than what’s on the surface, and Dean feels a mounting sense of dread at the thought that his brother is going to try and start psychoanalyzing him. But Sam just lets out an unsteady breath, and nods his concession.
Reaching out, Castiel catches Dean’s wrist in one hand and his fingers in the other, expending a shimmering wisp of grace to work the splinter free. He’s not sure what compels him to make such a show of it — he could have healed the minuscule injury from where he’s sitting without touching Dean at all — but he can’t help himself.
the one who gets all weird over leather boots and stetsons. It’s one of the few things that make him think that he’s not the only one of them whose interests extend beyond girls. Rather than say anything about it aloud, he just sighs and rolls his eyes.
“For all we know, she’s playing both sides,” Dean says, and shuts the laptop with an irritated groan. He pokes it back into the bag at his feet. “At least we’ve got something to go on, I guess.”
“Would that be okay with you?” Castiel asks when Sam makes no move to speak. He’s surprised by the way Sam’s expression softens.
Sam and Dean had died mere minutes before, shot point-blank in a tacky motel room by two misguided hunters, and Castiel had been trying to weave himself through the ether and into the moving target that was Dean’s heaven. It was reckless to attempt it, considering his own standing among the angels at the time, but he’d hoped he could manage to reach the Winchesters before the other angels realized he was there. Of course, the moment he passed through the ether he felt the other angels stirring. If he didn’t find Dean’s heaven soon, he knew he’d need to find another way.
He doesn’t wait for a response. Just walks back into the bathroom and leaves Castiel gripping the edge of the mattress, thoroughly outmaneuvered and wondering why on Earth he’d chosen this morning to be so damn responsible.
“You’ll thank me when there’s a fire to warm up next to,” Castiel points out, taking hold of one of the cooler’s handles and gesturing for Dean to take the other end. “The water’s probably freezing by now.”
He hadn’t questioned it at the time—he’d been so overwhelmed by seeing them at all—but now… there it is. Reckless hope.
“His name was Lieutenant Daniel Fisher,” Sam tells him over the phone, and Dean can hear him flipping through papers as he talks. “But it looks like he never made it back. He’s listed as MIA during the Warsaw Airlift.”
At Dean’s gesture, Castiel leans forward to speak, angling toward the phone so that he can be sure it hears him.
He went back to Normal during the summer break before eleventh grade, ostensibly to repair some damage that Grandpa Henry’s car had sustained in a minor accident, and stayed for three weeks, this time learning the tricks of the trade that he’d been too young to grasp before. When a bridal party arrived with requests for several original dresses, Grandma Millie encouraged him to try his hand at design, and was thrilled when she called him a week later to announce that his third attempt was being made for the Maid of Honor.
Side by side, they descend the stairs, making their way back down Parker’s driveway toward the Impala.
For the next twenty minutes, he describes in excruciating detail a series of events that never happened, and Sam--thankfully--has to meet someone before Dean is forced to think of another topic.
To his surprise, Dean not only meets his gaze head on, but actually gives him a somewhat straight answer.
“Cas?” Dean whispers, and from his tone it seems that it’s not the first time he’s spoken. “Cas, buddy. We gotta get up.”
Dean wriggles his brow again and tilts his chin back into the bathroom. Pointedly. His eyes are still sleepy despite the coffee, and there’s a crease on his cheek where he’s had it pressed up against Castiel’s coat overnight. He looks completely ridiculous.
He heads upstairs to his kitchen first, digging out some leftover pizza, and eats the slice cold as he makes his way to the hallway. The attic ladder squeaks as he pulls it down. He bats away dust before climbing up.
Castiel’s still relieved enough that Dean reacted well to him coming out a few months ago that he doesn’t bother reminding him that of the two of them,
She kicks up stones as she goes, and a little further away, Castiel sees two fawns scrambling along after her, half-hidden in the vegetation.
Clicking on them only makes the video lag more, and while they load Dean watches his brother talk out of sync with the audio.
he tells himself. He’ll take back some sugar, honey, and coffee, and he’ll find out what he can about the man he’s pretty sure was Castiel’s lover. The jealous little part of him that he can tell wants to keep Castiel for himself can just shut the hell up.
—” Dean whines after a moment, hips twitching and sensitive as he reaches down toward him. “Stop— too much— I—”
So, even though the reaction makes him feel like a supreme asshole, Castiel feels another part of himself shrivel up and die every time Dean smiles at Benny.
When he’d planned this trip, his main point of concern was that they wouldn’t catch enough fish to feed themselves. He’d never thought to consider that he might end up blurting out one of his two biggest secrets to Dean; he certainly hadn’t anticipated realizing that he was in-goddamn-love with him.
any shorter—it might even add a few minutes to their journey, now that Castiel is thinking of it—it’s the way they’ve always walked together.
Did he believe that Dean cared about him at all? Did Dean ever make it clear enough to Cas that his presence was imperative to Dean’s happiness? Probably not, he realizes, or he couldn’t have done this. He wouldn’t have been happy in those last moments if he’d known that Dean would be so hurt by his loss.
If something should ever happen to prevent him from being able to continue doing so… Well, Castiel doesn’t much want to think about that possibility. He’s already had one minor panic to contend with in the past few minutes.
Perching on the adjacent swing, Castiel wraps a hand around the chain and watches Dean rocking back and forth on his heels, waiting for him to work up to whatever it is that’s been on his mind. It takes him a while, and it's only after it starts to drizzle that he takes a deep breath and speaks, eyes trained on his feet.
“That’s my sister,” Castiel says. Dean flinches, a hand rising to rub at his chest as he looks back at Castiel.
“I’m not the one who vanished into thin air,” the man says, slowly pushing to his feet and taking a small step toward Dean.
He’s been working on this. Testing things, training himself to taste the sum and not the parts. It’s a work in progress, but it’s one that he’s resolved to see through until it’s an automatic process.
Without breaking their kiss, he loosens Cas’ tie and unbuttons his shirt. Untucks the hem and works his hands underneath, skipping fingertips over Cas’ taut stomach and catching the fine hairs under his navel before sweeping lower.
It was a desperate addition, but he knows that it was fruitless in the end. Dean knew his meaning the moment he’d spoken, and the plural of the second phrase only highlighted the singular of the first.
“No,” he says firmly. “I mean, I didn’t hate it. I don’t want to date him, and I don’t think I’d want to kiss him again, but… I definitely… I definitely didn’t hate it.”
Cas had done most of the talking when they first met up with the others, going over the plan that Sam had already hashed out with him in detail, and though they’d split back into pairs after that, everything had run more or less on autopilot. Dean loaded and reloaded his shotgun, repelling ghosts and clearing buildings without more than the occasional shout of
There's still a chance. Those three dots, if nothing else, say that Cas isn’t entirely done with him. There’s still a chance. Dean has a chance.
“Can I thank you now?” he asks once he’s able, and Dean’s chest shakes in a silent laugh that Castiel hopes he’ll witness a thousand more times.
Before Castiel can answer, Dean pulls him down beside him, making him sit, and Castiel sighs. He looks down at his stomach to take in the broken skin. Dean’s not overreacting—it doesn’t look good, and it really is taking a long time to knit back together, but Castiel felt the poison purged from his system before they’d left the barn, and he has no doubt that he’ll be fully recovered within another day or two.
Every afternoon, Dean would arrive at the library, wave at Sam through the study room window, and make himself comfortable on the nearest chair for the twenty minutes it would take Sam and his new friends to wrap things up. He usually just grabbed whichever book had the most interesting cover on the closest shelf. He’d read a few pages for something to do, then shove it back in place when Sam was done. A couple of weeks in, though, he’d started reading
It’s the first time he’s allowed himself to truly believe that Sam and Cas made it out of the house, and he pictures them sitting in the police station in Wichita. Cas would be rigid in his seat, expression guarded. Sam would be vibrating with anger and pain that he’d refuse to show until someone pushed him too far. He hopes it’s not Cas who does. The last thing either of them need is to fight with each other.
Dean doesn’t gesture toward the place they designated to hold Lucifer overnight, but Castiel looks toward it anyway. He imagines he can feel his brother’s cold, prickling energy down to the tips of his fingers. Like frostbite. He frowns and turns back to Dean; tries to soak in his warmth instead.
Dean furrows his brow, and Castiel sighs, shifting to sit on the edge of his bed with the jacket on his lap.
Castiel smiles, skimming his fingers over a light constellation of freckles above Dean’s left pectoral, slipping against the thin sheen of sweat that’s gathered there.
Today, standing in the bunker’s garage almost two years on, he finds himself experiencing the phenomena of olfactory memory once more.
Standing in the doorway, he shuffles on his feet, awkward and out of place. He doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do. If he’s supposed to go home, or if Bobby and Ellen want him to come with them to the police station, or to the hospital, or both, or none at all.
How his fledgling soul ached every day that they’d been apart; how he’d realized, finally, that this thing between them was love.
