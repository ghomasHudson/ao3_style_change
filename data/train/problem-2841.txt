“Oh crap,” Gabriel was heard to moan before trudging up to the center mat where Dean met him. “Hiya chucklehead,” he said with false cheer.
“Meg!” Sam yelled as the Gargoyle made a turn and dived for them again. He leapt up and smacked the kishin-egg away with Meg, and watched at it tumbled across the roof and fell over the rooftop into the alley below. Sam ran over to the rooftop’s edge and peered over just in time to see the kishin-egg almost fly into his face, but was jerked back to the ground by the familiar hellish chain-whip.
“It’s…night now.” Suddenly Sam frowned. “It’s the middle of the night. I’m awake, and something’s calling me…”
“It’s Halloween. You have scary parties and hang out and eat lots of sugar. It’s Gabriel’s National Holiday,” Dean said. “You never did anything on Halloween?”
Pamela held her hands over Anna’s chest but didn’t touch her. “Anna, you will wake up when I get to the five! One, two, three, four, five!”
His hands pushed up deliberately on the lid above him, unbidden. Something whispered to push as hard as possible.
Castiel, in his typical button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows and crooked blue tie, was quietly eating his salad while deep in thought.
Kali followed Gabriel’s lead and he led them to a shadowy corner where a small table set for two was empty. The rest of the tables had people sitting at them, chatting quietly or were sitting alone and drinking cocktails in silence. Gabriel even helped her out of her coat and pulled her chair out for her.
“Takes one to know one!” Dean snapped back, stepping right up to John, their chests touching. “You put us through Hell, Dad! How exactly were we supposed to come out the other side normal?”
“I had tracked the Krampus to that cave. I watched the meisters go in, and a few minutes later the Krampus chased the taller one, Sam, out of the cave and attacked him.”
Gabriel and Kali’s apartment was always opulent, but Kali had given the Halloween-decorating reigns to Gabriel, and now Dean and Cas entered they discovered the living room was transformed into a decrepit crypt. Fake cobwebs were strewn about, fake spiders and black cats and ghost and skeletons were everywhere.
“Sure. Cas, the box in the glovebox,” Dean said. Sam found himself presented with a beat-up cardboard box with several equally old and beat up cassette tapes. Sam pawed through the box for a moment, and looked up at Dean.
Dean remembered him sounding resolute, and the grace inside him hadn’t budged an inch. “I thought you were his friend. How can you defend this bullshit?”
“Alright. I’ll—see you later, then,” he said awkwardly, before awkwardly backing out of the apartment until he was outside. She closed the door on his face.
It hadn't been just sex. Well, in the beginning, yeah, but not by the end. Not while those beautiful eyes watched him in wonder as Dean took them in hand and got them to the finish line. Not as he
Dean hated that he couldn’t talk. He was always vocal, and he liked it when his partners were, too (hence the sigils). This curse was so much more frustrating than it had any right to be. So, Dean was going to show Cas in a language they both understood.
Dean’s face changed from chagrin to surprise to joy in only a span of seconds, but Sam saw it all. He was still getting used to the idea, of having family outside of John; he sometimes became terrified that Dean would take his friends and leave, but Gabriel’s words grounded him.
“John grabbed you and high-tailed it here to our house,” Ellen picked up. “We offered for him to stay a while, try to get his feet back under him. I think he managed to stay a few weeks before…”
An hour later, in the dead of night, the diagram was painted on the rocky ground and Sam had finished putting all of the spell’s ingredients in a bowl. All he had to do was light the ingredients and say a few words, but he paused, momentarily unsure. Did he actually want to do this? So much could go wrong, he might not even walk out of the canyon alive. What would his friends do, say? What about Dean, his supposed family?
“...I can’t handle this being a mistake, Cas.” Dean can’t look at his best friend. He’s too afraid of losing what little he can have, what little he’s managed to carve out for himself.
“If I survive this, I’ll never watch another horror movie again, or eat candy, ever again. Man, wish I had a Snickers on me…”
When you grew up most of your life with few possessions, the ones you managed to hold onto were that much more precious.
Ruby gave him a condescending sneer. “Well, what else would Lucifer’s right-hand man say, Dean? That he single-handedly killed half of Heaven’s angels before they tossed him in the basement and threw away the key?”
!” Sam said, terror gripping him tight and not letting go. Meg and Ruby looked at their meister, eyes suddenly wide when they realized Sam was no longer next to them, but was running the opposite direction as fast as humanly possible.
He tried to move his hand, but nothing happened. Same for blinking, taking a breath. Nothing was happening. His senses were still online. He could hear from his ears and see out of his eyes, but no matter how hard he tried to struggle
He turned to Cas. “Hi Castiel,” he said cheekily, Trickster facade back in place. A sheaf of papers poofed into his hands, and he flipped through them with a concentrated hum. “Was there a script change I didn’t know about? Because you are
“That’s a heart attack on a bun. I’ve been eating this way all my life, and my muscles have grown to an acceptable size.”
Dean didn't know how to explain that he liked the fact that she was good. But he needed his hands in an engine to think and process stuff. The main conduit he used to focus on the things life threw at them had been taken away.
Dean took his hard dick in his hand, familiarizing himself with its weight and feel, the cut skin soft and hot to the touch, though it was red and already leaking pre-come. He winked at Cas. “Gotta say, you do good work.”
“Go ahead and put your faith in a bunch of pre-pubescent idiots,” the woman in white sneered. “It’ll make it that much sweeter when I break them open later.”
“Shit!” Dean said and he jumped up, causing Castiel to fall over and crash onto the couch with a startled “Omph!”
They sat in silence for a few minutes. Meg realized now why she was developing this little crush of hers on Castiel. He was completely different from what she grew up around. She was used to bar brawls, blood, weapons, colorful swears, and big burly guys on roaring motorcycles. Castiel was the exact opposite of that in every way; Dean reminded her a bit too much of her past, of home. The fact that she was actually getting along with Cas so well was a bit disconcerting, but he was…naively adorable? The fact that he just accepted her questionable past was a big relief, and Meg suddenly felt a lot more comfortable around the weapon.
It was cold out, almost to the point of snow, but the blankets were heavy and warm. Dean and Castiel leaned the front seat back while Sam curled his long legs up to sleep in the backseat.
“Because it’s the desert in October, dumbass! It’s below freezing outside and I’ll be damned if I’m gonna nurse your dumbass through a cold.”
Ruby interrupted him from laying in Sam further. “Might want to watch yourself, Dean,” she simply said. “Your prison break is all over the papers. Demons will be crawling out of your asses soon enough. They’ll drag you back to Lilith unless we take them out first.”
With the car stopped, there was nothing but heavy panting in the car as people caught their breath from the adrenaline-soaked ride into town. All eyes stayed glued to the windshield, waiting to see if the kishin-egg got up again.
Just as Cas held out a hand to get Dean to his feet, Sam flew through the air past them. Tossed like a ragdoll by another demon, his brother smashed into the wall of alcohol bottles behind the bar and dropped like a stone. The smell of the alcohol and the gas fumes from the bike made Dean’s nose burn and his head dizzy.
The man glared at them. “You think the DWMA controls everything? Oh, that’s cute. I don’t need to go to some fancy Academy to kill kishin-eggs. I’ve been doing fine my own. You,” he pointed at Meg. “You owe me an egg!” he snapped.
One, there was something warm pressed against him on the couch, and something heavy was on his shoulder, black hair tickling his cheek.
Dean could feel energy crackled down the tips of the broken feather and along with the fractured, burnt bones until it gathered in their chest. The calm, sacred energy of the church was being converted as it traveled through them into something roiling and destructive. In a few seconds, Cas has the power running through them openly and his eyes glowed white-hot.
Castiel was confused by Dean’s slang, but followed him over the food table anyway, where it was actually empty. Most students had found their partners and were getting to know each other.
“Well, that’s good. Thanks for letting me hang this up,” Dean looked down for the first time and realized something strange. “Cas….have you been holding a bag of frozen broccoli in your hand this whole time?”
“Let ‘em try and get us!” Meg said. “We’re from the DWMA, we can take on anyone! Seven kids defeated them last night, that’ll make them think twice.”
Without a word she walked over to the Start line on the ground before the course. “Anyone else joining me?” she asked evenly.
Sam looked over his shoulder but didn’t see Bobby within hearing distance. He ushered Dean into his room and shut the door. He slipped his hands into the front pocket of his old hoodie and studied his brother. “What are you talking about?”
“It’s just…I was expecting something really cool, but I got stuck with a guy who can turn into a silver toothpick and has zero sense of humor,” Dean said with a pout.
A cloud of white smoke exploded in the kitchen, startling everyone as Gabriel hopped out of the fog with his trademark smirk in place.
“Hey, dingus, Meg and Cas are sitting over there,” Gabriel said, suddenly standing right next to him. The weapon pointed towards the table across the pizza parlor, startling Dean.
"Huh," Dean said, a weird sense of deja vu tickling the back of his mind as he looked at the black muscle car. "So funny," he said slowly as Sam turned to watch him. "This was, like, the car I fantasized about sometimes.” He huffed awkwardly. “But it would never make sense as a hunting car. Couldn't fit a body in the trunk, not even if Leatherface had got to ‘em first," he joked.
Dean bristled. “It’s a classic. Shut up.” He placed the breakfast on the bedside table and looked over Sam when he didn’t respond. Sam was pale-faced with pronounced circles under his eyes, and his hair was stiff with sweat. His eyes, however, were clear as he focused on the open laptop in front of him.
I was going to wait until tomorrow (Tuesday) but I kinda got excited for y'all to see what's going on with our dynamic duo!
Cas didn't even pause. “Why not include men in your question? They make up almost half your population.”
Sam gently grabbed her chin and turned her head, letting him see the wound. “Are you okay?” he asked.
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but closed it. Instead, he looked at Dean and how often he was attempting to stifle his yawning.
Bobby glowered silently but said nothing. While he might have helped raise Sam and Dean, his innate knowledge of when to keep his trap shut in front of superpowered entities hadn't entirely been passed down.
Sam's eyes darted back and forth between his brother and the demon choking on the wall. “Dean, there’s nothing there!”
Draining the last of his beer, Sam gently hopped down off the hood and replaced his empty bottle into its spot in the cardboard carrier. Then he stretched and yawned. “Think you’ll be up all night again?” Sam asked as he opened the back door, creaking its hinges heavily.
The third was this beige terry cloth robe, which was just the right amount of weight and warmth. Cas ran his fingers over the soft material, and a tiny grin lifted the edge of his mouth. It had taken him way too long to figure out Dean had managed to find a house robe that was the same color as his beloved trench coat.
So, I'm going to try and get out this Christmas/holiday arc out in real time and will hopefully have 4 or 5 long chapters up before December 25th. Will it work? No idea, especially between work, other series, and holiday present making. BUT! I will do my best!
So, I have good news and bad news. I know, way to open a chapter, right? But I want to let you know that I have gotten a new job and will be starting next week! This is a blessing after being home for a year without a job, and I’m happy about it. So, that’s the good news.
When Kali looked over her shoulder from her desk she saw Gabriel lying on his stomach on the couch, his book open and he seemed to actually be studying.
Dean lets out a huff. “Think we should move this to bed, angel. Don’t want to give me another concussion, do you?”
, Dean thought to himself, feeling a little nervous. Pop quizzes shouted at him from his Dad or Mom about monster lore during a hunt was one thing, a standardized paper and pencil test was a new experience altogether.
“Ah, I see. Because it’s not like you have the same first and last name, the same parent’s names, are the same age, or even have the same bitch face as his cousin. Oh, wait.”
He helped Bobby and Rufus diagnose a few junkers with engine problems before finally, finally, Bobby let him under the hood of his pride and joy, the only car without a speck of rust on it, the Impala. The car had been a restoration project he and John had started a long time ago; after John and Sam disappeared, Bobby alone had finished the project. Dean had always taken a shine to the car, and he was allowed to help change the oil and check the filters before the cold sent them back inside.
“That was incredibly reckless and stupid!” Spirit said. “You’re lucky your carelessness didn’t get yourselves killed,” the Death Scythe said angrily.
“His name’s Hiram McDaniels,” Dean explained. When the kids in the backseat stared at him, he shrugged. “He’s running for mayor.”
Dean opened his mouth to tell Cas not to worry about it. He could deal with it as he dealt with anything; on his own. Seeing Cas’s earnestness, he sighed. “Guess it’s time to lay my weary head to rest, huh?”
The table was quiet for a few moments, everyone hiding the awkward silence by eating. Eventually, Dean decided to break the ice, the only way he knew how. He finished his burger, and narrowed his eyes at the girls while putting on his most winning smile.
Sam covered his mouth with his palm, eyebrows up his hairline. Getting his wits quicker than the others, he demanded in a shaky, disbelieving voice, “Cas, what are you talking about?"
Raphael stepped towards Castiel, disdainfully eyeing the junk cars around them. “You haven’t checked in for some time.”
“Might be something, might be nothing,” Sam said, tapping the notepad with the pen. “So, you know how Bobby has a network of Collars that keep an eye out for things?”
Dean groaned and tried to force himself up, but he saw two of everything. The rugaru had Sam on his back again and, despite his attempts to hold it off, those bloodstained teeth were a scant inch from Sam’s jugular. Sam’s arms shook with exhaustion--Jack was about to get the upper hand.
“Pulling you off the rack early has hopefully stalled the Plan. But there are still pieces on the board, and the game is far from over.”
Castiel’s lips drew into a line. He knew Dean was not going to change his mind, but he did not want to back down either. “Dean, you’re exhausted. Look, I’m not that tired, okay? I’ll look at the map a bit more and see if I can figure out a pattern to the disappearances. You get some sleep. Remember, when we find this kishin-egg, you’re the one who’s going to have to fight and kill it.”
Missouri sighed. “Bobby, Dean, Castiel, Sam,” she said, pointing to them. “You two are partners, you two are father and son, you two are cousins. But you…” She pointed to Sam. “You don’t believe you’re related to them. No, you don’t
“That’s delightfully vague,” Dean muttered sarcastically. He sipped his coffee, but curiosity roused him to ask, “How’d you find me?”
Sighing with aggravation, Dean said “Fine, whatever, give ‘em back,” as he attempted to snatch the clothes back. Castiel, being a little quicker than Dean, ducked the outstretched arm and hopped off the couch out of Dean’s reach.
They wrestled for a moment (Dean trying to give him a noogie and Sam defending his honor) before they headed inside for a piss break and food. After meeting up with Anna inside, Dean, with poorly hidden trepidation, used his golden Trickster card for their food. Without hesitation, the transaction went through and a weight lifted from Dean's shoulders.
“None taken. It’s interesting, isn’t it? Who’d have thought that, in a town boiling over with kishin-egg monsters, we’d die of starvation?”
When the radio transmission went dead, the teenagers looked at each other, ashy-faced and horrified. Gabriel had crumbs on his chin and wide eyes.
“Cool it, Cas. I already thought that stuff through. First off, I’m not gonna tell him everything I know about the business and let him go play hunter! I figure showing him so more advanced fighting tricks isn’t that dangerous. He gets better, we get better, and Sid can’t kick our ass as badly every day.”
Shit, it felt so good, his hand racing along his slick dick with practiced ease. There was a moment when he shifted up a gear, twisting his wrist at the head that almost made him lose it because that's when Cas started dropping little ohs and ahs with each stroke.
After a few hours into their stake-out, Dean had to question if he was their guy. Until they watched him tear into a picked-over chicken carcass and a pound of raw hamburger in a kind of feeding frenzy.
Kid pinched his nose in irritation. “Father, I’ve been tracking the Krampus for years, and it’s been a challenge. It’s been difficult for me to try and destroy a monster so perfectly bilateral! But when it chased out that meister and attacked it—“ Kid shuddered and moaned. “It was missing an eye! It’s left eye was nothing but a bloody hole! I was so surprised, shocked, taken aback—“
“Fine, fine. I’ll go talk to them. Try to smooth things over. If I can’t, then, I guess I’ll send them to Lord Death. Maybe he can knock some sense into them. Literally.” Spirit was not looking forward to it.
“Wow, look at you, being all grown up and responsible! I shouldn’t, but...I do have a soft spot for you. Go ahead."
2) What do you think of Cas’s new look?  I literally tripped over these images and knew I HAD to work it in. Talk about character development!
That knocked some of the wind from his sails. Shit. Psyching yourself up for this suicide mission, convinced you're a dead man walking, only to be told you’re literally not good enough?
“That’s your problem. You need to stop thinking like a Hunter, Dean. You’re at the DWMA as a Meister, and you have to start obeying the rules and procedures we have in place,” Spirit said harshly. The weapon looked at the Reaper. “I’d suggest a 30-day suspension from kishin-egg hunting.”
Bobby and Sam had their arms crossed, waiting. Dean rolled his eyes so hard he saw the backside of his brain. Still, he shed his clothing with business-like efficiency and draped each piece over the back of the chair.
There wasn’t much talking between them; there was no point in wasting the breath on Dean’s part anyway. And Cas just let his completely smitten heart-eyes do the talking on his part.
“Ash, banner way bin light weak bight!” Dean smacked the steering wheel hard and groaned. “Argh! Nimrod scuttle's worth!”
Cas was still trying to figure out how to control his avatar, and Dean was too distracted by the gun show happening next to him.
Dean shut it off and then rummaged through Sam’s duffel bag. His brother kept a few basic lore books in there: one on creatures and an old tome on ghost legends. While the internet was usually faster, it paid to be prepared.
Gabriel laughed. “Clever thinking, Winchester! I’ll see what I can dig up. Also, I noticed the fancy new phone you got. Want to give me your number and I’ll text you?”
“Get down!” he hissed. She did as he told, because the usual glint of humor or mischief in his eyes wasn’t there. He was serious.
Dean had been a terrified witness to the demon in front of him. He’d been trying to keep his mind clear, trying not to distract Cas during the fight with his bloody flashbacks. If he were driving them, they’d have run a long time ago. But now, the fear that had been coursing through him suddenly caught fire like napalm.
Of everything Anna could have told his brother, that was the lowest blow she could have delivered. Sam fell quiet and bowed his head, a pained expression on his face that his hair was just a touch too short to hide. Kid believed in angels before Dean had. He’d managed to have faith in a higher power when all the evidence pointed otherwise. In reality, Sam had been right all along, and he was the one ignored by those same powers. If Dean ever met an angel, he’d strangle it.
There were a few hours out before finding their victim, and he couldn’t be bothered to pick a tape for the ride. Sam opted to pull on his noise-canceling headphones and connected them to his rescued iPod. He was listening to something and making notes on the legal pad. He’d be distracted for a while.
“Wants us to look into a guy named Jack Montgomery in Carthage, Missouri.” His brother huffed in annoyance. “Said we’d ‘know it when we saw it.’”
Unfortunately, the book included monochromatic paintings of people in the throes of agony as they died. Bright red explosions from their chests showed Dean in no uncertain terms what would happen to him if they didn’t resolve this curse in time.
This was a tough one to write, folks, but we finally get to meet one of my favorite SPN characters! I hope you enjoy my version of everyone’s favorite Trickster :)
“You have nothing to feel ashamed for,” Cas informed him firmly. He hit the nail on the head so squarely that Dean was startled into looking up at him. “Trauma is a powerful thing to fight against.”
“No, I’m not,” Castiel agreed, appearing in the middle of the back seat. He sat forward with his hands clasped together between his knees. Dean’s eyes must have lingered on the rearview mirror too long. Sam tensed up and peeked over his shoulder towards the back seat.
Dean pointed at him. “So, if I try to talk to you in public but there’s nothing there,  people are going to think I’m nuts. Could even call the cops or something.” He held up the Bluetooth and popped it back into his ear. “But, if I’m wearing this and start talking to you, people will think I'm on a regular phone call.”
Meg let out a disappointed sigh. “Cas, if you keep bailing them out, they’ll never learn,” she said, but then sent Castiel a subtle wink. “I will admit, Professor Castiel has a nice ring, doesn’t it?” she said with a teasing lilt to her voice.
Castiel’s tanned right hand came up and covered his right hand, still wrapped around the steering wheel in a death grip. His skin felt warm and soft, his fingers long yet strong. Even the edge of the coat cuff was smooth and heavy. Castiel felt real enough that Dean had to lean back against the door; his heart was now pounding for a different reason as those eyes stared into his for what felt like forever.
“Sorry, man, the diner was all out of your patented ‘greasy pork sandwich served in a dirty ashtray’ hangover cure.”
He had Cas glanced at each other before slowly sitting up, the sight of an orange and yellow water pistol pointing from the backseat towards the front. The two bullet-holes in the cracked glass told Dean the entire story. He turned slowly towards the backseat—Sam was shoved over to the side as far as possible, and Kali simply looked smug. “It was advancing on us,” she said.
. Though his jacket and layers of clothing had taken most of the blow, Dean was still a wreck of sliced open flesh and glass shards. Sam grabbed Dean’s arm, leading him out of the window, and winced as Dean cried out in pain. Castiel’s Blade was shoved against his chest—against all logic, Dean and tried to shield the weapon from the glass; though he knew that Castiel was safe from any physical harm in his weapon form, it had been an instinctual act.
“Oh, Lord Death, you said there was an informant here. Could you tell us who that is so we can talk to them?” Dean asked.
Ruby rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. “That’s ridiculous; we don’t have time for this! That thing is going be on our butts any second. So suck it up, partner, and let’s kill this thing!”
Sam sat up and patted Gabe’s leg a few times. “Neither did I,” Sam confided. “Brought what I could fit into a backpack. So, our room’s a little…barren,” he admitted.
So the sisters and Kali were off doing some mysterious thing, Gabriel and Sam were watching movies and—
Bobby came to check on them once he’d returned and replenished their supplies of washcloths and water. He wasn’t able to sit in on Sam--his phones were ringing off the hook. Demons were pouring out of the woodwork around the country, searching for them; the other hunters were swamped.
I've been bouncing back and forth between this, a hopeful Pinefest entry, and Baby 3. Talk about a full plate! And yet, I'm having a blast, so you should subscribe to me because I'm aiming to publish on the regular soon enough.
The phone rang a few times, and he had to hold the phone away from his ear when a high-pitched child yelled “DEEEEAAAAANNNNN!!!!!” into the receiver.
Despite the heat and humidity, Dean felt the temperature drop a few degrees around them. Before he could do or say anything,  Cas crossed his arms and fixed his eyes on the house. “How’s Sam?”
to go home! We can head to Mondo’s place and see his baby! And remember the tree we always help Dad set up in the shop?”
Sam frowned but continued. “So, a priest reached out to Bobby because he was contacted by a young woman. She attacked an orderly at the mental hospital she was recently admitted to, and her parents--a preacher and his wife--were murdered in their home. She’s currently hiding in her father’s church. She called the priest because he was a friend of her father’s.”
“Breath, Dean.” Castiel’s tanned hand squeezed his own for a second, long enough for Dean to break his stunned silence.
“Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole,” Castiel dutifully answered. Ah, apparently they’ve had this discussion before.
He pulled off his flannel and tied it around his waist after wiping the sweat from his face. Then, he picked a direction to start walking.
“Guys, we killed the Anti-Claus!” Dean said, throwing an arm around Castiel’s and Sam’s shoulders. “We’re
The two guys sat on the couch, leaning back and simply letting their weary bodies rest. It had been a few days now, and Sid’s regimen had gone from basic cardio and strength training to making Dean and Castiel spar. The last part had been confusing.
“No, but we did go talk to Cecil. We’re gonna stick around tonight and pick up the trail in the morning,” Dean explained, stifling another yawn.
Glancing down, Cas snapped his fingers, and everything was cleaned up. They were no longer sweaty messes, and Cas’s clothes were put back together. Something about the absolute lack of evidence made him feel weird. Almost like this had been a super lucid dream and he was going to wake up any second.
They knew he couldn’t do the job himself, and after having his ass saved so many times, he had to be honest with himself: they were right.
Unfortunately, with him running backwards, he did not see another kishin emerge from the shadows just up ahead; dressed like a 1940s Mafia gangster, the kishin-egg leveled its Tommygun at the unsuspecting radio host and—
Cas rolled his eyes but just squeezed Dean’s hand before settling next to him. He turned down Dean’s Metallica tape--he’s the only person who can do that without getting kicked out of the car at 60mph.
Dean shook his head. It was her eyes, her white, pupil-less eyes that were the biggest clue, he knew it, but just didn’t understand it.
Twenty years, 7,300 days of unimaginable torture, and the nightmare was finally ending in front of him.
Part of his brain helpfully yelled at the other half. But, this wasn’t just a guy from a bar he wanted to try things with. This wasn’t a guy; this was
Ruby’s eyes went wide in surprise. “Oh, come on!” She whined, whipping around and shooting an accusing glare at Dean. “You’re
Sam shook his head. He’d hoped, God he’d hoped. “No. Even now I…you’re just…strangers. I’m so sorry.”
Anna raised an eyebrow in disbelief when their eyes flashed blue, and Castiel’s rough voice spoke from Dean’s throat.
There was a calculating look on Cas’s face before he intently put both his hands on Dean’s shoulders and met his eyes. “Alright. Yet, when I mentioned masturbation earlier you also shot that idea down. Why?”
“You’re hot like you are, don’t go fixing what ain’t broke.” The joke landed flatter than a pancake. “Look, I get you’re trying to be helpful,” he said harshly. “But, please, don’t offer this if you don’t want it. You don’t owe me anything.”
Dean winced and ran a hand over his mouth. “I remember Lilith monologuing us to death. I remember the hellhound making me its chew toy.” He took a steadying breath. “Then, uh, nothing, ‘til I woke up in a pine box six feet under.” Dean shot a displeased look at his brother and pointed at him. “I should kick your ass for breaking protocol--”
The car rocked as Sam attempted to get comfortable, and Dean felt like a boat on the water. He hadn’t felt the same about large bodies of water since they had dealt with a ghost who drowned people on land. That was one of the first cases he’d worked with Sam after the disaster at Stanford.
Cas stretched out like a cat after a satisfying nap, displaying his messy chest and sharp hip bones as his pants rode down his hips. His hair was now a proper head of sweaty sex hair, and his wrists were a bit red, but the satisfaction on his face made every second of the switch worth it. Cas might want an encore at some point.
“Okay, look, this wasn’t as well thought-out as it could’ve been, but we’re Meisters and Weapons. Hunting Kishin-eggs is our job,” Dean said.
“It’s a game shop,” Dean explained once he swallowed the extra saliva. He ran his hands over the buttons. “Always wanted to play but never stayed anywhere long enough,” Dean said wistfully. “Wanted to leave my name on the top score. Just once, you know? Like when people carve their initials into a tree.”
Looking at Dean and then at the seat, Sam deliberately grabbed Dean’s closest forearm. Before Dean could ask why his brother was suddenly handsy, Sam made direct eye contact with Castiel. First, he gasped, but then his face morphed into sheer confusion.
Shaking his head, Dean pushed off the tabletop and collected the empty beer bottles. He headed to the kitchen, a curious Sam following (and yes, just keeping an eye on him in case Dean needed something). Sam leaned on the door frame and watched his brother throw away the bottles.
They fell into a routine that continued for the next week. Classes were in the morning, followed by Sid’s personal training sessions in the afternoon. After eating dinner with everyone, Dean and Sam would spar for about an hour or so. Sometimes they’d even do homework and sleep became a commodity.
Sam, his giant little brother with floppy bangs and a deadly temper protecting his heart of gold. Sam was his only family, his only rock; Dean’s whole purpose was to protect his brother from anything the world could throw at them.
“Gabriel? Are you okay?” Kali asked, her blunt tone softened slightly as she sat down next to Gabe on the couch. She was scowling, but he wasn’t sure if it was because she was worried about him or what a sick weapon could mean to their survival rate.
“We did attempt to contact you once we realized the extent of the situation,” Castiel said, trying to placate the weapon. Lord Death simply took in the scene without adding to it.
“But you smell pretty good. For a guy. Uh, I mean….you don’t stink,” Dean tried not to blush. Thank God Cas was clueless; no one else would simply accept Dean’s odd rambling as just odd.
“Aw, Deanie weenie’s homesick!” Gabriel snickered. Dean threw a packet of ketchup at the weapon, smacking him right in the chest. “Ah, I’m hit!” he cried in mock horror.
You’ve gotta be kidding me! Look, I’m tired, I’m sore, and I don’t wanna go at this time of night. Can’t you just help me out on it tonight, and I’ll do my own from then on I promise.”
“Maybe you or someone you know needs a little extra help,” she said with a shrug. A thought crossed Gabriel’s mind, and he smiled.
“So, Dean, were you attacked with any spoons in the night?” Sam managed to ask with a straight face. Dean glared at him, and Castiel looked concerned.
didn’t do anything,” Gabriel said innocently. “And it’s not like you’re gonna tell anyone. A, who would believe you? And B, I’ll keep my lips sealed about your little crush as long as you do about me.”
Once Jack stopped screaming, Sam ran back to Dean’s side. The long, bloody gash on his forehead healed up in front of Sam. Dean was awake now--his hands shook as he patted Sam down. “You okay, Sammy?”
Cas opened his mouth, only to close it again. Everything he wanted to say suddenly sounded petty and childish in his mind.
Sam intently watched Dean’s fingers tapping tunelessly on his thigh and turned Anna’s attention onto himself. “Wait, you said the angels talked about us? You made it sound like you knew everything?”
“Alright. I wish, if you were going to try and find another partner, that you wouldn’t do it behind my back, Dean.”
All language skills were forgotten because Cas was using every trick in the book that Dean had ever experienced on him. The impossible heat and even, unending suction should have been enough to make him come his brains out, but Cas was doing this trick with his tongue--
Dean slammed the beer bottle on the table and jumped off the table. Frantically, he searched the garage for an iron crowbar. The strobing lights made it more difficult, but he managed to find one on a work table surrounded by engine parts.
“It must be razed and rebuilt.” He locked his gaze with Dean and he could see the Angel of the Lord in Cas's eyes at that moment: ancient, unknowable, and cosmic in scope. Dean truly felt insignificant when he realized those eyes watching him and seen galaxies form and stars be born.
“No, you didn’t,” Gabriel bit back. “You were always in a league of your own. You’re a Seraph for crying out loud! You were going to do your own thing, no matter who had your back or didn’t.” Gabriel ran a hand through his hair and pushed it back from his face. “What happened to you was unfortunate, but you made your own choices, Castiel. I didn’t make you rebel to the point of--”
Dean is treated to a genuine Castiel smile, bright enough to rival the sun and just as dazzling. Castiel is staring at him like he hung the moon and the stars in the night sky.
Sarah shook her head. “Actually, that happens more than you think. There’s this phenomenon that happens with occult objects, where sometimes the person doesn’t pick the object, the object picks you.”
At a nearby table sat Cecil, clad in pajama bottoms and an over-sized sweater, a steaming mug of coffee in front of him. He arched an eyebrow at Gabby, then looked as Carlos and Castiel helped Dean to sit onto the table. “Gabby? You’re up a lit late, aren’t you? Did you have a hankering for scientific inquiry and understanding our frail existence in this universe?”
Sam was reminded of a scene from a movie he and Dean had enjoyed recently called Baby Driver. The gimmick was fun--the heist movie was in sync with the music the main character, Baby, listened to. He thought of how Baby bonded with his girlfriend in the film, by listening to music through a pair of shared headphones.
Cas rolled across the mat to get away from Sam’s long arms. He kept low and kicked out his leg when Sam came gunning for him; he successfully swept Sam’s legs out from under, sending him tumbling to the mat with a thud.  Sam got to his feet quickly, never taking his eyes off Castiel. They circled each other, waiting for the other to strike first.
“No need to apologize! You noticed a threat and acted accordingly. I’m proud of you,” she said with a smile.
Any information yall would be willing to give me will help me work out how I want to proceed. Like I said, I probably won't be adding to this version since it's already super long and it was probably only half way done.
“Anyways, Dean, I was able to go and pick up a few basics from the nearby grocery store, but we need to get more things.”
He rolled out of the bed, grabbed his duffel, and stole the bathroom. The water was almost cold in the shower, but he did not care. He just wanted to wash away the blood, the sweat, and the failure. Yes, the kishin was killed, and yes, he and the girls were fine. But they had to heal him on the first hunt, and he was not proud of that fact.
His brother glanced around before he leaned forward, both nursing their umpteenth cup of coffee because the infinite coffee refills were all they could afford. “I know you’re pissed, and it’s probably not my place--”
“I thought after defeating God, things were going to get quiet around here,” Eileen complained. “But instead, we get Dean cursed to gibberish and Cas hitting farm animals. Guess there’s no such thing as quiet with you guys, huh?”
Dean couldn’t help the aggravated sigh that escaped him. In his mind, his family needed his help, more than Sam or even Castiel. He was frustrated—Bobby wouldn’t let him home to help, and honestly, the DWMA was starting to become boring.
Dean looked up and froze for a second when he saw Sam watching. But then, he seemed to remember that there was no need in being sly or subtle anymore--he and Cas were together now, and everyone knew it.
Dean put the car into drive and pulled away. He watched, his heart pounding, as his little brother’s retreating form disappeared in the rear-view mirror.
Between Pamela and Anna, he paused. “Hm. Not sure which would be the Devil’s or the Angel’s food cake here.”
Sid gave them another stern look, but then broke into a grin. “Never said you were. I like you Dean, and I don’t have a problem with your friends, either. However, I’m not here to bust you.” He looked over everyone. “Dean and Castiel, you are wanted by Lord Death.”
Meg sighed. “Dad’s right hand man. The typical biker who looks like he’d stab you for breathing, but is actually the biggest ball of tattooed fluff known to man.”
“Not bad, Sammy,” Dean grinned. “Good to see you’re a quick study. That’s a lifesaver right there. Now, let’s try that again, but without the attitude.”
As the beginning chords for Led Zepplins’ “The Song Remains The Same” began filling the car with classic rock, Sam leaned forward over the back of the front seat so he was between Dean and Castiel. “Dean, can I see your music collection?” Sam asked.
“He left home almost a year ago—I knew he was in the city somewhere, but I never thought—I never thought I’d see him again. He just…
“Wasn’t it?” Cas asked bitterly, striding up to Gabriel. “You didn’t just run away from Heaven and abandon your responsibilities. You abandoned
What had started as a discussion about the meanings of different song lyrics had changed topics so many times he’d lost count. He’d kept out of it, but this went
“Huh. Well, I must’ve missed that,” Gabriel said vaguely. He hit the pause button on the remote, freezing the frame so that a terribly-animated ‘sand shark’ was in the middle of devouring someone. Sam chuckled at the image as Gabriel turned to him, a smirk on his face.
It was going to take some time to get used to the idea of money at their fingertips. They’d never have to take showers with their clothes on and dry them hanging from the shower curtain because they couldn’t find quarters for the laundromat. They wouldn’t need to save up their glass bottles and cans to haul to a high-paying recycling center half the country away. No more worrying about getting blood out of their jeans because they can't buy new ones.
She looked at him, then at the milling guests, then back to her partner. Sweat trickled down his cheek and he kept tugging at the sleeves of the suit jacket he was wearing. He obviously wasn’t used to wearing such formal clothing.
The younger hunter narrowed his eyes and his lips pursed together. “Angels?  Bobby, those don’t exist,” Dean protested.
Sam thought quickly. “Uh…Well, ever since Halloween, I’ve been trying to figure out who was behind that attack. Since Samhein was a demon, I figured the woman in white was, too.”
The bed was empty when Cas surfaced from his sleep and cracked open an eye. The lack of sunlight in the bunker was starting to affect his circadian rhythm. He could easily go back to sleep for another week if he were allowed such a luxury.
Dean just nodded numbly as Castiel vanished. It took Sam shaking his shoulders for him to snap out of his confusion. “Dean, what the fuck was that?”
Cas reached up and laid a hand on Dean’s chest and pushed. Dean took the hint and laid back against the bed, and Cas, with the most obnoxious slurping noises he’d never heard outside of a porno, sucked Dean back down once more.
“When did you get here?” Cas asked. He didn’t want to talk, but he also knew he would have to act as Dean’s mouthpiece until the spell wore off or was reversed.
Dean shuffled out of the jail cell and blinked like an owl at noon. She led him down the hall, through the processing area, with a few other officers talking to civilians or working at their desks. Sure enough, as they exited the front doors, Sam (in his civilian clothes) was standing in front of the Impala where it was parked at the curb.
“Just remember your friends at Blake & Talbot’s when you hit that lottery,” she said pleasantly, waving at him as he left the store. As soon as he disappeared, she sighed. “God, I never thought I’d get rid of him!” She turned around to spy her business partner and a teenage boy watching her with interest.
“Nothing to be sorry about,” Cas said primly. “On the contrary, the development of agricultural technology was an exciting time for your species.”
While Cas didn’t say anything, Dean could tell a lot was going on behind those tightly closed eyes. He reached out and gently put a hand on Cas’s arm. The contact snapped him out of his spiral, and he looked at Dean with that intense gaze once more.
“Geez, even your B-movies are too smart for me,” Gabriel murmured in good nature once Sam stopped to breath.
Sam didn’t look up, he simply looked at his feet as they continued walking. “And…what if he’s been right the whole time?”
"Yes! I expect you to listen to your old man because that's what good sons do. He's gone bad, Dean. You tried, but Sam was always broken. He's always been a monster."
Ellen looked away, unable to say anything. She was usually the rock, the one that didn’t waver, looked danger in the eye and didn’t flinch. It was odd seeing her like this. Maybe Sam’s reappearance was making her question the quid pro quo of the Winchester house.
Sam stumbled backward, eyes and mouth wide in the realization that something had saved his life, something he couldn’t see.
Dean, Castiel, and Sam get to South Dakota and get a hell of a homecoming only a Winchester can receive!
The only thing that helped Dean and Cas deal with Sam’s absence were the quick updates Ruby and Meg would still share with them on Sam’s mood. Between classes they would say hi, and would sometimes grab a quick coffee with the boys, but they normally stuck with their meister.
“Don’t get cocky, or I might start to think your partner is teaching you bad habits. Don’t strive to be more than what you are, Castiel. You’re a weapon, a good little soldier who follows orders,” Raphael snarled. “Tell me, your partner, is he going to be worthy of our cause?”
“Name’s Nextus. Sam and his demon traitor girlfriend poked their noses where they shouldn’t. I have no beef with you, angel, but we need Mr. Winchester back in Hell. My terms are thus: I give you time and place; Dean sells his soul for immediate collection; Sam and the traitor go free. Don’t care where you go but you can’t stay in the meatsuit.”
“Crowley,” Sam said after a hesitant second. “He had a dog for a weapon, and said he was a meister not affiliated with the DWMA. He didn’t seem really concerned about what was happening, though. If that was about him and her, wouldn’t he have acted less…casual about it?”
“Oh yeah. Very cursed. I won’t go into the details—you probably would want to actually sleep tonight,” Sarah said with a little shudder. “Let’s just say it doesn’t end well.”
was definitely what sealed the deal. He could see Castiel sitting up straighter and Dean had a grin that was from ear-to-ear. He watched Dean lean in and say something to the angel. Something that made Castiel’s cheeks flush, the red making his blue eyes pop with intensity. They were definitely sharing the same hungry look, and Castiel reached under the bar top to squeeze Dean’s leg.
“Get away from her you DICK!” Dean yelled, stake at the ready in his hands. Sam and Castiel gripped theirs tightly, ready for anything.
Dean held up his hands, like he was shielding himself. “Dude, put the bitchface away, I was only kidding!”
The old man was dropped to the floor as Cas turned to them and Dean immediately jerked backward. He was Cas, dressed in the same black outfit as before, but his entire eyes were cobalt blue as they stared at Dean and Sam. The eyes rolled back until normal blue eyes looked back at them.
“Yeah, he is. He’s the loner badass with anger issues,” Dean said without missing a beat. He divided the quarters into stacks of four and lined them up where the screen met the control panel for easy access.
Seeing Castiel was one thing, but being able to feel a body pressed up against his own--Dean couldn’t wrap his head around it. Wasn’t Cas supposed to be a hallucination? Why the hell did he feel real to Dean, their chests pressed together, both panting with emotion. He had to actively think of the Antarctic, so he didn’t pop a boner because of a fucking mental projection.
“It’s the only thing that makes sense so far. Crowley…we’ve never had a meister by that name,” Death said, scowling. “How many souls did you estimate were missing?”
Dean dropped the last bite of his burger in shock when he caught sight of her true face. Under the human one she was wearing was a writhing, pulsating mess of black smoke that made him instantly nauseous.
Ten feet away, standing there watching them with contempt, was a black man in a violet suit, a predatory grin splitting his face. Hovering over the man’s head was a thin line of black lighting, encircling his head like a halo. Enormous wings spread up and over them, gray feathers spread with more of that black electricity skittering over the wings.
Kali let out a angry growl, and she glared at Dean so ferociously the boy knew that, if looks could kill, he would have been a puddle of ooze on the ground. “What’s wrong?” he asked.
Castiel suddenly smiled. Not a twitch of a smirk, not a vague grin, a full on smile. Dean was suddenly reminded of the Cheshire Cat. “I’d like that very much,” the weapon said.
"I ran away, and without my grace, they couldn't find me. If I'm found, I'll be executed. I don't think Heaven is going to make the same mistake twice about throwing a living Fallen into Hell again."
“We’re students from the DWMA. Do you really think we can’t handle any miscreants dimwitted enough to try and hurt us?”
Cas suddenly disappeared, but the impossible heat around his dick told Dean where he went. His eyes crisscrossed in pleasure as Cas sucked him down hard, going from zero to sixty with no intention of stopping, making those damned gagging noises in his rough timbre. The pleasure shot up Dean's spine like a rocket and
Sarah grinned, leaned down, and patted the top of a very jovial-looking garden gnome statue that was next to the door. Gabriel could’ve swore wasn’t there when they had entered earlier.
“You don’t try very hard,” Cas said, crossing his arms and scowling. “When did you stop being dead?”
Dean was expecting him to simply nod, or give them one of his intense squints; instead, Cas actually stepped forward and held out his hand to shake theirs. Sam took it, but the girls didn’t make a move towards him, leaving him waiting awkwardly.
“Dean,” he said, voice low. He ran his hand gently up and down Dean’s chest. “I want to take care of you.”
“You two need to be quiet,” the Castiel-shaped blanketed lump in the passenger seat said gruffly. “Sleep now.”
Kali, despite the cramped quarters of the booth, managed to fit a few inches of space between old faded t-shirt, ripped jeans and bruised Dean and herself. Her red blouse and black slacks easily cost what Bobby made selling car parts in a few months. She sat with his back straight, eating her sushi with chopsticks perfectly, not bothering to look at anyone at the table.
He nodded enthusiastically. “Yep! See, I put a bear on each new paragraph, so I get a reward for the every paragraph I read!” He said proudly, popping the candy in his mouth.
“I guess if you don’t harvest the eggs immediately, they resurrect?” Gabriel said, looking at Sam fearfully.
The tracks continued various love ballads and anything Sam could find with an “angel’ in the song title. He played
Sam looked out the window for a while, wondering. What were Dean’s parents like? Would they recognize him? Would he them? Maybe if he saw them, he’d finally jog free the memories he felt like he should have been remembering this whole time, but were firmly locked away from his grasp.
The boys had just gotten through the library when they came up to the sliding doors that separated it and found them closed, hushed voices coming from the other side. Jo was asleep on the couch and curled up in a ball under a blanket, the toll from the day wearing her out until someone woke her up for dinner.
“Not we,” Sam corrected. “Me. Unfortunately, ghost sickness comes with some nasty side effects, and hallucinations are just the tip of the iceberg. You’re gonna blow our cover if you start having a bad trip while talking to a witness.”
“The invitation is touching, but I’ve wasted enough time on you idiots already,” Crowley said, stalking past them up the street to where white and blue eyes had just been.
“Nope. And we plan to keep it that way,” Dean said with a grin.  "And, um, thanks guys. For stepping up as a team when I..." The words were still hard to say sometimes. He swallowed. "When I needed it."
“For you lot, maybe. You can do all sorts of things when the Grim Reaper isn’t breathing down your neck. Must be a pain in the arse.”
With the bar in his hands, he went to the fifty-gallon drum of rock salt stationed near the kitchen door. He wrenched the lid off and pulled out the metal scoop in the salt. He flung the salt around him to make a rough circle.
Dean dropped Cas’s hand as Gabriel waved his finger at them. “Cassie, Cassie, Cassie! What a scandal! What
“It wasn’t me,” Sam said, crossing his arms. “I mean, I tried, I’m not going to lie. But no demon would deal. Do we need to kick the hornet's nest on this one?” It wasn’t a real question--it was a wish that something good had happened for no reason.
"'S'okay, man, the sock-goblins probably stole the other two." Enjoying Cas's bewilderment, he grabbed the socks and folded them together. "Sometimes it's better to have a good enough match than a perfect one," Dean said sweetly and tossed them in the bag.
Dean tried to act like it was no big deal. His friend made a pie, that was awesome. He was a little wary of trying it because he’d never seen Cas bake before but he was going to at least play nice and try a bite.
“Bobby!” Dean screamed. The old man opened the door and threw himself over Sam’s legs to weigh him down. Dean was at his head and holding down his shoulders for dear life.
Cas shook his head adamantly. He stood while covering his mouth, a large yawn escaping him. His short, dark-brown hair, usually a little ruffled, was even more a wild mess. His buttoned shirt was also a bit wrinkled from the jousting earlier, and the blue tie he normally worn was missing. Cas always took it off before physical training.
Cas wondered about a garden, not for the first time. Growing his own herbs, vegetables, and flowers would be a practical skill he could learn. Cas was not going to be able to sit quietly in the bunker forever; he’d have to learn a skill or maybe find a job somewhere. Could he help Jack as a human? He'd have to ask the next time his son came around to raid their Krunch Cookie Crunch supplies.
“Come on, man, this isn’t the Matrix,” Dean said. “No way those Fabio locks are computer code," he teased, reaching over to mess with Sam's hair.
“We might need to put the chains on the truck out back,” Ellen said. “Grab some more supplies from Sioux Falls for our unexpected guests,” she shot a look at Dean for that.
More people were pulling themselves up from the pit, as well as the continuing wave of skittering, black scorpions that glowed softly in the dimly lit break room.
Dean took the steering wheel back; being in control of his body was jarring after those few short moments.
Jo bounced up to them and looked them over. “Well, come on, Mom and Dad aren’t gonna bite!” she said, grabbing a hand from each boy and effectively dragged them to the porch steps.
“Sorry, Cas, we aren’t trying to ignore ya, it’s just…” Bobby started after taking a long swig of beer. He kept looking at Sam as if the boy was part of some waking dream.
Castiel placed a comforting hand on Dean’s shoulder, making the hunter’s green eyes lock onto Castiel’s. “You cannot live her life for her, Dean. If you show her both sides of the world, she’ll be smarter, better prepared for anything, and make her choice accordingly. If she chooses to follow your path, then she will be able to save lives just like we do.”
Cas thought for a moment, debating what to say. “…No. We didn’t even get a chance to eat anything because of a broken napkin holder.”
A few silent tears trailed down his cheeks but he wiped them away with the back of his hand. Scanning around the dark motel room, he glanced at the snoring lumps that were Sam in the bed and Bobby on the couch. Despite the rattling in the old A/C unit and the cars zipping past on the road beside the motel, it was quiet.
Sam hung up and put the phone face up on the table next to his laptop. He jumped up to grab his brother’s shoulders . The contact made Dean open his eyes.
“Let me go!” a voice screeched, and Dean whipped his hand back to see the huge hulking creature bent over a hole in the ground and lifting out a certain blonde haired sibling. The Krampus’ long red tongue dragged over the side of her face, making her squirm in its grip. “Gross!” she shouted.
Dean’s been hungry enough to stare too long at roadkill. He’s grown up with so little, but Cas had been despondent as Marnie’s motivations became clearer.  It broke Dean’s heart, and he almost found himself grabbing his phone to call Sam or Eileen to take over several times over the past couple of days.
He’d never imagined a demon could be so flippant towards an angel. “Are we doing this or not, demon?” Dean demanded.
“—I’m pretty sure they saw him coming a mile away. And when he got busted he dragged me under the bus with him,” Dean said, and although he scowled he wasn’t really angry.
“Definitely!” With Gabriel spirits back up, he leapt from the bed out the door, but not before pausing to give her a back-breaking hug. “Thanks again, Kali.”
“Can’t see why not. I mean, who am I to deny someone the opportunity to kick monster ass?” Dean said.
Cas straightened up to his full height, actually having several inches on the archangel. His eyes narrowed in disillusionment and rage; Dean was pretty sure if looks could kill, Gabriel would have become a messy smear on the dirty concrete floor.
“It’s an annual tradition here in Night Vale. A time for everyone to come together and make sure the parallel dimensions of the living and the dead don’t get stuck and allow cross over. On Halloween night the veil between worlds is at its thinnest point, allowing the dead to re-enter our world. The Ceremony is to make sure the door closes like it’s supposed to, so the dead don’t overextend their welcome.”
--thank you! This story wouldn't be moving along at the clip it is without their guidance and confidence in the direction I'm taking things. Thank you again! :)
“Why? You’ve given me some interesting insight into a fascinating mind.” Cas seemed so baffled that Dean decided to take one for the team and get to the point.
“It’s just…well, you know, the whole thing with Sam and stuff…I’ve had a lot on my mind.” Not technically a lie.
That made a cold hollow open up in Dean’s stomach. Cas had said something before, but he hadn’t explained it was
“Shut up Sam.” Dean slowed down and a huge metal sign suddenly loomed before them in the failing sunlight. B&E’s Salvage Yard, it said in prominent letters.
He carefully placed a pillow on his lap and prayed to whatever deity was listening that Ruby wouldn’t question it. He started drinking his coffee slowly, and wished fervently Meg would get out of the bathroom soon.
A random movie started to play, something about snakes on a train, but he wasn’t paying any attention to it. Dean’s mind was running around in circles, back to the gas station and the high strangeness he’d experienced there. Thinking about how he had pulled himself out of his own grave made him cough as he felt phantom dirt ticking his throat.
“Boys, make yourselves useful,” she said. “Check Jo’s room and outside for any clues on what this bastard is.”
The newspaper he found said it was July 18; depending on how recent the newspaper was, it was at least two months after he’d died.
“Was that a compliment?” Gabriel asked incredulously, making her glare at him as she threw her hands up.
“Your mother would be proud of you, Sam,” Ellen said as she gave Sam another hug before walking out the door. “If you ever need anything, we’re just a phone call away.”
Dean could feel Sam’s urge to roll his eyes from across the room, but he controlled himself. “We need your help capturing a demon,” Sam said simply.
“So, Gabriel,” Sam started, looking down at his feet as he walked. “Why did you want to talk to me?”
“There is no such thing--Lucifer is just a boogeyman used to keep the other demons in line.” Dean knew he sounded like a little kid plugging his ears and screaming he couldn’t hear anything. But destiny, the fucking
“They haven’t. They’re keeping us on our toes.” He hadn’t mentioned the Night Vale attack, and was starting to wonder when that was going to bite him in the ass. “What about you guys?”
He did NOT want to open that can of worms yet, so he course-corrected to something more angel-friendly.
Another stream of fire seemed to explode off the highway in the desert; from the quick glance Dean saw, he could see figures silhouetted from the flames. Spindly, monstrous things swallowed by the flames. Kishin-eggs, he realized.
Sam ran a hand through his hair and sighed; yeah, he could see this biting him in the ass later. “Can I talk to Dean about it?”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean finished up his lunch and started looking around at the other students milling about, trying to figure out which one he could go to next. “Should probably get back to that.”
“Shit, Cas, gonna make me come just listening to you,” he growled into Cas’s ear. “Come on, Cas. I got you.”
Gabriel focused on Sam’s face with laser intensity. “Well, it would certainly be one hell of a Christmas gift. Not many people get a family for the holidays.”
“Why do you even have alcohol with you? The legal drinking age is 21, which you clearly are not,” Cas said, curious.
“Just try not to drop me,” Castiel said, and he closed his eyes. He could feel the magic coursing through him, and felt his body change into the blade. Just relax, he reminded himself, and he felt the strong grip surround his body, just like before. But this time there was no exclamation of pain, or the sensation of freefalling. Instead, he was being held aloft as though he was as light as a feather.
“Dammit, you’re right. Sam, we’re going to have to table this tonight. Rufus and I are heading out as soon as he gets his slow ass over here.”
Sam looked up at the oversized candles that framed the front entrance and the three skulls that seemed to gaze down at all those who came and went with watchful eyes. He took a breath and made his way inside, silently jogging down the main hallway until he came to the Assignment Board.
Sam started to make a run for them, but Dean grabbed his arm and stilled him with a stare. “You’re gonna to get them killed along with your stupid ass if you just run out there,” Dean snapped.
Cecil looked all over to see an Indian girl atop with roof overhead with what looked to be a child’s water pistol shooting into the horde chasing him. Another boy—not terribly tall but thin from a hard life—had a hunting knife that he wielded like a machete and a shield attached to his arm. Kishin-eggs paused and were slashed apart in the boy’s ferocity. After turning back around he saw a familiar boy land on his feet as a mafia kishin died.
under another textbook like it’s a porn magazine!! Does history really make you that hard?” she snickered.
Dean paused his tirade to let Cas answer him, but the weapon would not look at him. Silence reigned for a few moments, and Dean was almost afraid he’d pushed too hard, but he silenced that argument in his head.
Dean awoke in a foggy haze late the next afternoon, over 15 hours later. He propped himself up on his elbows and looked down at his leg. The denim was stiffened with the dried blood, and his leg was still tender, even a bit itchy from the stitches. His back and sides were sore, and his throat felt like the surrounding desert, arid and sandy.
“From what I can gather, Samhain isn’t just a ghost or superstition. It looks like he’s the Daddy Demon of all things Dead,” Sam said. He sounded more fascinated than frightened.
“I'll be home in a few hours, Dean, I promise. I went through all the trouble to find these ingredients for your cure--I’m invested in seeing this through.”
“Oh no. There’s, what, millions of souls in Hell, right? You don’t want another one to add to the chaos,” Sam said quickly. At least he was smart enough to realize the asking price was high. Too high.
Cas was just looking back and forth in confusion--looking over at Eileen and seeing her just as confused just made him growl, “Tell us what’s so funny!”
Bobby grunted and walked her to the door. Dean heard several apologies for the ‘rowdy gatecrashers,’ but Pamela laughed it off and patted Bobby’s scruffy cheek. “You always keep me on my toes, Bobby. Don’t let them give you too many more grays.”
“That’s the problem,” Castiel growled. His eyes were fiery when they locked into Dean. “You two are each other’s weaknesses, and all of Heaven and Hell know it. Do you know somewhere defensible to regroup?”
There was a pause. “A guy named Castiel,” Dean said quickly. “He’s a weapon called an Angel Blade, although he looked like a silver stake to me.”
“You can’t miss what you don’t shoot!” the Grim Reaper’s son younger weapon, Patty, exclaimed cheerfully.
“About what? What a crazy-ass town she lives in? I don’t know. I just…I’m not exactly sure what to do with it. Not sure if I ‘like’ her like that,” Dean said.
Trying not to lose control, he'd automatically palmed his dick to relieve some pressure from his jeans. Instead, Cas shook in his lap at the touch and
Sam closed his eyes at that one, and Crowley grinned, decided to prod a little more. “A normal, stationary, loving, family where your mother is alive and bakes you cookies, and your father isn’t a paranoid, alcoholic ass, dragging you from stained motel room to motel room across the county--”
Castiel stood up and motioned to the demons. “You and your brother must be protected. This is only the beginning, Dean. Go!”
, the darker part of his mind whispered, drowning out the parts that made him laugh, made him smile, made him easy-going and friendly.
When Dean and Sam had stood before Chuck on that picturesque beach, he thought that was the end of them. They had not expected to survive the encounter--who would when going up against literal God?
“Well, me neither. By the way, my name’s Gabriel, what’s yours?” As he spoke, he held out his hand for a handshake.
Cas was resolutely looking at the floor between his feet. Dean noticed his eyes grow red-rimmed and misty with self-loathing and heartbreak.
Sam was on the other bed, pulling on his shoes. He did not look at the girls, but there was suddenly tension in the room were a moment ago there was none.
“We take from different sides of the family. By the way, how is dear Michael?” Lucien asked. There was a frosty tone to his words as he returned to his seat and motioned for them to sit in the few stools that didn’t have clutter on them.
Everyone finished their meals, the feeling around the table much more relaxed that when they started. “Well, we gotta get going,” Sam said after a few moments. “Homework and stuff.”
The car started up and they finally maneuvered out of Death City and onto a stretch of highway that lead east, back towards home.
“That’s really odd,” she said. “I’m the one who organizes this stuff, and I don’t remember even seeing this thing before. It was with the protection jewelry so I guess it has protective properties but, I really couldn’t say.”
Dean darted out after them, but as he stood outside of the door he didn’t see anyone in sight. Left, right, he couldn’t see or hear them anywhere. “Dammit!” he growled.
. He had to make this the best possible experience for him. Cas might not let him have another chance.
A few tears escaped from him, but he shook his head, trying to pull himself together. It’s too hard to concentrate enough to talk to Cas like this, so he instead just mutters, “Not dreaming….’membering.”
Dean tried to speak, immediately regretted it, and held up a finger as he swallowed down the bile rising up his throat. He burped a little acidic cloud of tequila fumes and grimaced.
He spent an extra moment running his fingers over the soft, threadbare fibers of his shirt before he noticed Dean behind the open flap. Gingerly he got the socked feet and made his way over, smoothing down his hair as he went. “Dean, why am I in here?”
He stuffed the couple flat pillows he had behind his back so he could sit up and stare vacantly at the little TV. Commercials played quietly since he didn’t want to wake Bobby up. A woman in white leather sang the number for a phone-sex hotline. There was a commercial about a super blender that could pulverize rocks into dust. A hot guy dressed in black plugged one of those prime-time dramas that had been running for years. Despite Dean watching a few episodes here and there, he couldn’t remember the show’s name--he just smiled at the guy and his accent.
Dean slapped him on the back, laughing now. “Oh, God’s gotta sense of humor doesn’t he? Ha! So what is it, the red nose or the big shoes that scare the hell out of you?”
“Come on!” Cecil said and he made a break across the street towards the radio station. The kids followed suit, Dean shoving aside the pain as adrenaline kicked in and ran with them.
“Absolutely,” Dean said with a grin. As was tradition now, he reached out and fussed with Cas's hair, loosened his collar and tie a bit. Might not be as dramatic as handprints around his wrists, but it was still proof this happened.
Dean rolled his eyes but then closed them. “Whatever. I just want to see if I can get a few hours. Then I’ll be good to go.” He cracked open an eye and saw Castiel was just staring, unblinking, at him. He determinedly buried his face in the leather seat so he couldn’t witness Castiel being a creeper.
“Mkay, I’ll bite.” Dean cracked open his beer and read the article aloud as he skimmed it. “Wellington, Ohio...wife says the husband was killed by a bear?”
Dean, who may or may not even be his cousin because Sam’s earliest memories were fuzzy recollections of motels and the constant unshaven stubble on John’s face. He didn’t even know what his mother looked like.
After a moment, Dean looked at the blade, at Castiel’s reflection, and sighed. “Well, this is unexpected,” the hunter murmured in annoyance.
Cas looked away. Before Dean could ask what was on the angel’s mind, there was a flap of wings and a sudden breeze from the direction he was looking. Gabriel and Sam appeared in front of them.
Cas gave him a light punch on the shoulder. “What happened to that whole ‘glad you’re my partner’ thing?”
The meisters got back to their feet, warily looking for the one in the darkness of the street to finally reveal himself. “Get ‘em, boy,” they heard, and a large black dog, the size of a Great Dane but built like a Mastiff bounded forward. It only paused when passing Sam and gave him a look before it went up to the first soul and swallowed it greedily.
His insides still hurt, but there was no physical mark left on him. He let out a groan and rubbed his sore stomach; he lay on the cold tile floor for a moment, trying to calm down his pounding heart, when he heard someone walk up to him.
“Easy, Tiger,” Dean said, arm extended out to keep Sam away from Castiel. From the horrified expression on Sam’s face, it was unnecessary. Sam was back, or whatever. “Sam?”
Dean’s eyes grew wide. “Tea? Bed zoe forget why shrew burped? War bid been ace buy!” His tone was offended.
Dean’s heart was hammering in agony, and he collapsed to his knees. He groaned in pain. “Go away, go away, you’re not real. Not real…”
Dean might not be overly superstitious, but he felt that music could act as a sign. So, Sam was going to use that against him, hopefully, in the best way possible.
Dean's heart was beating so violently he thought he saw it beating through his skin, cartoon-style. Cas reached out and placed his open right hand against Dean’s chest, over his terrified heart. Hesitantly, Dean laid his hand on top of Cas’s, the dulled horns of his amulet poking his wrist.
A very tiny, very coy smirk passed over Cas’s lips as he looked up at Dean. “Could apply that to other things, too.”
"You are," Cas said a little smugly, the dick. "And you beg so beautifully, Dean." He crawled back up and softly kissed Dean several times on the lips and forehead. "You still remember too much English for my taste," he teased darkly.
The road wound through a patch of black woods, the Chevelle the only car on the road despite the relative earliness of the evening—night had fallen maybe an hour ago. Considering they were heading away from the heart of Sioux Falls and off into rural country. Most sane people were probably out shopping, gathering last minute gifts for Christmas.
Castiel regarded him as Dean swung back around to watch where he was driving. They were at another stoplight, moving slowly because of the sudden downpour.
Castiel studied the picture, a carbon copy of his current form. Though the guy on the cover had blue eyes, they didn’t have the same brilliance or inhuman depth to them. Castiel stood with his back ramrod straight, not a casual slouch, and a charming smile did not grace his face. Instead, he was stoic.
Cas leapt from his chair and jerked his coat on. “We need to go. We need to go now!” Castiel growled at everyone when they still sat in unsure silence. Dean nodded.
Jo was still stewing as she stood on the steps, tiny arms crossed over her body as they waved good-bye. Bobby sighed as he and the four teenagers headed towards the cars.
Bobby shook his head. “No, you need to try and rest, Dean. Probably just still riding some adrenaline from the rude wake-up. Well get a few hours of shut-eye and head out tomorrow.” His tone brokered no room for argument.
A small table was broken, the cups and plates that had been on it were scattered every which way across the hardwood floor. The window was open and the curtain flapping freely in the stiff cold wind from coming in from the north. A few snowflakes were blown inside.
Meanwhile, Dean had dropped Cas’s tri-bladed angel sword from his sleeve into his hand and was wildly slashing at demons with abandon, trying to keep their attention. Once he saw Sam stand up and smash his chair against a demon’s back like he’d seen once too many WWE matches as a kid, Dean truly let loose. After all, he didn’t need to worry about delivering precise kill shots. He just needed to get the demons down long enough for Cas to mop them up.
Gabriel didn’t answer because at the end of the alley was the man in the gray coat, peering down the alley with little eyes. He let out a huff of breath, and it steamed into the chilly air. He let out an irritated howl and whipped around before stalking up the street.
No, not returned it. Cas’s eyes had always been that brilliant sky blue. The ghost sickness had warped his mind to show him what scared him the most. The Cas with the demon eyes never existed; Dean heaved an unconscious sigh of relief.
Despite knowing that it was dangerous to linger, he didn’t move from the bathroom. Instead, Dean turned his head back and forth, studying his face, his green eyes, the freckles across his cheeks. Why did it feel like it was his first time seeing them?
Cas sat back, mischief on his face as Dean looked back and forth. A spectral hand made of blue light, transparent like a ghost but rock-solid, was wrapped around each of his wrists. He pulled his arms, but they wouldn’t budge. “Cas?” he asked, voice cracking slightly.
“What do you want, a cookie?” Gabriel said mockingly. Memories of him and Sam getting into it over the years flashed across his mind.
“Afterwards, then,” Castiel said. He stated it so seriously that Dean just rolled his eyes. They got back into the battered car, and fully drove down Route 800 towards the station.
Dean and Cas started playing a quick game of rock, paper, scissors. Castiel won with a rock to Dean’s scissors, and was allowed to change the radio station to something he liked. The weapon stopped on a jazz station and Dean rolled his eyes. In the rearview mirror, Sam caught the softened look of those mossy green eyes as they glanced with a look of fondness at the weapon staring out the window.
They both gazed down at Marnie. She’d almost finished the spell when they had burst into the dilapidated house at the edge of town where she had set up shop. Cas tried to talk her down, tried to get through to her as someone who had walked in her shoes. She, unfortunately, sealed her fate when she attacked Dean and sent him flying across the room. Cas had a line, and she'd crossed it.
“Hit a nerve, did I? Maybe that’s the incentive you needed to get your ass in gear. Now do you get the picture?”
“What was it--? Oh, 42-42-5-6-4, when you want to knock on Death’s door,” the hunter said, drawing the numbers on the misted glass. He adjusted the mirror, then he and Castiel squished together as much as possible without it becoming awkward so they could look in the mirror together.
“Gabe! Sit down, you’ll blow my cover!” Dean grabbed his arm and made him sit on the other side of the table. “What are you doing here?”
An eternity later, a second later, Dean didn’t know which. All he knew was that the tank seemed to run dry, and the flames stopped. Cas dropped heavily to his knees, panting hard, head bowed, utterly exhausted from the effort of being the conduit for the divine energy. His shoulders pulled painfully as his wings hit the floor for a moment.
“Perfectly normal,” she said with ease. “It’s a little odd letting someone in when you’re not used to it. Just relax. Big, deep breathes. There you go. Now, this isn’t exactly my forte. I’m better at talking to spirits and entities on the other side than reading people, but Bobby asked very nicely. I’m just going to take a little peek in your brain and see if there’s anything to his suspicion. That alright?”
They hadn’t been on the best of terms at first; he would be the first to admit he’d been a bastard to the poor kid. No one wanted to be born from Lucifer.
Cas’s eyes cut to him. They were no less imposing when they were reflected from the rearview mirror. “I almost didn’t,” he admitted. “If you were unconscious another second, he wouldn't be alive. Seems that I can’t manifest unless you’re conscious.”
“No, really, what? What the hell is it I’m supposedly not remembering?” Sam asked again, his voice a little harder than he meant it to be, but he could feel himself getting pissed at them. They were tiptoeing around him, treating him like a fragile ceramic vase that might break any second. He was sick and tired of getting treated like an armed bomb. He wasn’t
“That would defeat the purpose of this whole situation,” Castiel said dryly, which caught Dean off guard. Dean’s tongue darted out to lick his lips. He harshly swallowed.
As the dust billowed around them, Cas rolled back to his feet with lightning speed, moving like water. He spat out a wad of blood and there was blood dripping from a cut across his nose.
A wave of exhaustion hit him like a train, and he yawned so wide his jaw clicked. He was so startled by it he glared at Cas directly. “Did you just unplug me?”
Dean and Carlos grabbed the wooden bar that had been placed across the doorway as a lock and threw it across the room, taking out another Night Vale Radio Intern. “Sorry, Jeremy!” Cecil told the zombie as its head was sent sailing back into the bottomless pit. Other interns were shambling towards them, teeth sharpened and eyes white in death.
Cas laid the girl on the ground after making sure she was okay, then turned to see a floating orb of red light before his eyes. It hovered right where the monster had died. His breathe hitched slightly at the sight of the kishin egg. A myriad of emotions crossed his mind—fear to actually eat the evil thing, pride at having gotten his first kishin egg, nervousness that he was about to start down a path he wasn’t sure he wanted to travel.
“Not if you still plan on heading out with Rufus,” Ellen reminded him. Bobby swore under his breath.
With a rustle, Cas was surveying their surroundings with curiosity. Dean got a few precious seconds to drool over his new appearance.
Dean squeezed his hand, taking pleasure in glancing down to see their fingers intertwined. He chuckled. “Trust me, Cas, you are a lot better than you used to be.”
“But who--?” The only syrup bottle provided for the two stacks of pancakes on the table was filled with a bright red liquid. Sam reached out, poured a drop on his index finger, sniffed and tasted it. “Strawberry,” he huffed. “Gabriel, then.”
“Odd? No, it actually made sense!” Sam said, and he broke into a rant about language and words and how they carry meaning and a lot of other stuff that made Gabriel want to scratch his head in confusion.
“How about this. I will change into these clothes if you tell me what’s bothering you,” Castiel offered.
“Yeah, pretty sure I know what that means,” Sam said. “I’ll have to hit the books. Just get home so we can figure this out.”
Before Sam could answer, Meg bumped Castiel slightly, her face bright and excited. “You’re not going to believe this Clarence! We’re actually hunting a kishin-egg in
Breakfast was anything but a quiet affair. Jo and Dean started teasing and bickering with each other over things only they seemed to understand. Bobby munched on a doughnut while reading the newspaper. Both Dean and Jo reached for the last doughnut at the same time, and shot each other glares for it.
Rather than blow off Cas’s question, Dean tried to be honest. “I’m not tired exactly,” he started. “But, I feel a little weird? I’d probably try to drown it out with cheap whiskey, but you are
They moved to an empty corner of the outdoor patio, Dean with a plate full of hamburger and apple pie, while Castiel munched quietly on celery sticks. Dean laughed at his “rabbit food,” but Castiel simply kept munching.
Once inside, Dean helped himself to bottles of water and candy bars. The shopping took longer than was safe because he kept losing focus and staring at a display of magazines or chips or beer. It felt like it was the first time he saw this stuff.
“So, Sam, I guess let’s start at the beginning,” Bobby said, pouring himself more vodka in his glass. “What’s the earliest thing you remember?”
Sam was passed out next to him, and it was night outside. How long had he been mindlessly driving? “Ah, yeah, sorry, Anna.” A mile up the road, the giant neon sign of a fast food joint summoned them like mosquitos to a bug zapper. His stomach grumbled, and she sighed in relief when they pulled into the parking lot.
He looked up from the shining blade to see Dean, holding him, looking just as surprised as Castiel felt.
Before Dean could open his mouth to apologize, or say something to cover up his stupidity, Sam turned to him and actually smiled a little. “Yeah, I guess it’s a Winchester thing,” he said slowly.
Missouri glared at him. “Boy, don’t test me! I’ve had a lot of folk come and go over the years—you all start to blend together after a while! But…you said twelve years ago, right? Your father’s name is John Winchester?”
“I learned from the best,” Cas whispered into Dean’s neck. He could feel the angel’s hot breath on his skin; Their arms locked around each other in a tight hug.
When Dean opened his eyes, he was greeted with a panting, sweaty, disheveled Cas that would have made him chub up again instantly if he were younger. The angel was hazy-eyed and relaxed; or, softer around the edges a little as he sat back. Seeing Cas softer, and vulnerable,  Dean thought in awe:
As he handed the card to Sam, he winked. "You, however, have Express Permission to call me at any time. Adios!"
It took Sam a moment to realize it was a game they were playing from the mischief in their eyes, but Castiel looked genuinely upset at their ‘arguing.’ “Why don’t you cut the doughnut in half, then you both can have some?” he suggested.
Mills looked into the back of her police car, her son curled up in a ball with a blanket around his shoulders and the car’s heat on full blast. “Broken wrist or arm by the looks of it, but…if that’s all? It’s a Christmas miracle. Thank you, again.”
Kid cleared his throat. “Dad, this isn’t the main problem! This 1-star meister managed to fight the Krampus back without his Weapons, with barely any experience!” Kid’s eyes were an eerie yellow color, and they flashed when he spoke.
He barely has time to register the movement. Castiel grabs his thighs and lifts him without hesitation. He wraps his bow legs around Castiel’s middle, and their clothed cocks rub together. Castiel almost drops him when the overwhelming pleasure rockets through them both. Luckily, they had made it to the bed, so Dean is dropped onto it without ceremony.
“My folks hunt vampires and wendigoes for a 9-5,” Dean hissed. “I’m not worried about Sheriff Mills.”
Dean grinned. “Hell, yeah, Harley,” he said. His forehead furrowed in confusion, but he figured he must have knocked some wires loose upstairs, and he just needed to rest.
“Stop.” Cas ground out the word. “It doesn’t matter,” he said quietly. “Heaven made sure everything I tried to do was for naught. And now you’re blaming your Fall on me?”
The shower was fraught with danger so Dean just used a wet washcloth to clean himself up. Once dressed, he debated if chugging the beers in the fridge would help or hinder things. He only had a few hours left. Luckily, Bobby agreed to meet  Sam at the lumber mill. He had faith they’d come up with something. He kinda had to.
“Well, then, idiot, since you seem to have a problem with that f-word, here’s another for you. Friend. We’re friends, so stop acting like a bitch about it,” Dean growled, his tone ending the conversation. Sam didn’t get a chance to speak further as the others finally got the chance to run to them.
“Yeah, something like that. At least you’re a polite roommate. You know, when you aren’t causing aneurysms. Just don’t throw any keggers while I’m sleeping, okay?”
Sam couldn’t say what happened after that. He was almost dead, knew it was about to happen, and he got furious. No, no way. He wasn’t about to let everything he’d done be in vain. He wasn’t about to let some kishin-egg kill him. Not like this. Not after meeting Ellen and Jo and Bobby. He wasn’t about to lose them, or they him.
“Meisters and weapons have to learn to deal with each other,” the teacher said. “If she tried to kill you, I would’ve stepped in.”
Rolling his eyes at Cas’s stubbornness, Dean reached down and pulled Cas up so they could kiss. Hands roaming up and down the muscles of Cas’s back, Dean reached under Cas’s pants--he still had his dress pants on, why was that so damn hot?--and grabbed his firm ass, bringing him down close. “Come on, Cas, feel this with me. Come
He opened a beer and had a half-opened beef jerky stick hanging from his mouth while he tried to open the plastic packaging of his new purchase. Frustrated, he was about to rip it apart with his teeth when Castiel held out his hand. Dean handed the package over, and Castiel ripped the plastic shell apart like a banana peel. He picked up the small plastic item inside. “What’s this?”
“Of course,” Cas said, wrapping his arms around Dean and hugging him tightly. “And thank you, Dean. For everything,” he said into Dean’s temple.
So, in typical Dean Winchester fashion, he didn't do anything. Just continued to bail out the Titanic with a mop bucket and hoped for the best.
Sam was hunched over slightly, his right arm curled around his abdomen and his hissed in pain every time he had to breath. He swallowed, trying to keep himself from vomiting as pain like lightning lazily licked its way up and down his chest. His bangs were plastered to his forehead from sweat, and his clothes were covered in muck.
Night Vale was silhouetted by flashes of orange and green light against the blackened night sky. The flashes looked almost like explosions….
Dean hummed under his breath as he entered the room, a mug of green tea in one hand and a plate of toasted and buttered slices of white bread in the other.
It felt like a one-sided strip tease to Dean, and he tried to ignore the rush of blood to his…little Dean.
Kali looked at her weapon uncertainly. “We haven’t gotten a chance to try his secondary form yet,” she admitted.
He realized how drab and barren his own dorm was, considering he lived with two girls, and felt suddenly embarrassed about the fact.
Because there was no way in hell Cas knew what romantic was...right? The candles were purely practical; there didn’t seem to be any other lights in the cabin.
Cas never took his eyes off of Dean’s as he pushed the shirt off of Cas’s broad shoulders. They landed on the ground, followed by his tie, and Dean pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it aside. Just as he leaned down to start nibbling along Cas’s jawline, Cas pulled back very deliberately.
Nothing might come from this. It was probably too much on the nose. But, dammit, he was so tired of seeing this awkward dance--it had been years at this point. Sometimes when you were in a rut, you had to get creative to get out of it.
“You didn’t bring pillows with you?” Sam asked sleepily, stacking the pillows into a squishy lump at one end of the couch.
Castiel felt the anger slip away from him as he looked at Dean smiling so genuinely. “I’m still going to give Death a piece of my mind,” the weapon grumbled.
“Don’t pop a blood vessel, I was just teasing! It’s…not bad,” Dean said, a smirk still on his face. “Come on, let’s go!”
He rolled his eyes and cut a clean line across his forearm. Blood trailed from the cut, but no other reaction occurred, except for Dean’s slight wince of pain. When he looked back, Bobby looked like he was about to burst into tears.
Sam raised an eyebrow, not giving his brother an inch as he took it. “Jerk,” he pronounced as he took a bite.
He put his hands to his face and chuckled darkly. “Even after all this time, Castiel, you can see right through me, huh?”
“Well, it certainly is different. I mean, it’s no ‘Stripper Zombies from Pluto’ but it’s not bad,” the weapon said. Sam’s face fell slightly.
Dean took a few steps forward and back, both hands in his hair. “So instead of talking about it, you just decide this on your own?” He waved towards Gabriel. “You just decide that I want to see my best friend kill himself to power a chastity belt on a demon for the rest of eternity?!”
“I won’t waste the time right now to kill you. But, after the test tomorrow, I won’t have such reservations!”
“You two, Bobby. Glad to have the excuse to get out into the sunshine. Ellen! It’s been too long. The bar misses you, you know.”
He expected an eye roll, but Cas didn’t respond. He just continued to run his fingers over Dean’s skin and through his hair until Dean absolutely could not fight the pull of sleep any longer.
Dean’s face contorted, brow furrowed, and nose wrinkled. “You’re shitting me right now. Me and Sam’s big cosmic destiny was to become a pair of
Ignoring Dean, Cas trailed a line of hard, biting hickies down his neck. The stubble scraping against Dean’s skin was soothed with the drag of a hot, wet tongue afterward.
“So, she plans on killing Crowley with irony. Nice touch, but why the rush to get back to school?” Dean said.
Dean turned the music off and pointed angrily at his passenger. “You better start explaining what the hell is going on, Cas,” he snarled.
Cas looked over at him and snapped his fingers in Dean’s face to get his attention. When Dean looked over, Cas made a point of locking eyes with him and taking deep, exaggerated breaths. Dean nodded and synced his breathing to Cas's.
“Castiel Novak.” The weapon was lean with ruffled brown hair and intense blue eyes. He was shorter and lighter than Dean, and wore slacks plus a buttoned down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows.
There was no sound, no change in the air around him that told him Cas and popped into the car. It was the kind of silence that couldn’t hide the sound of a heart breaking.
The Texas accent suddenly reminded Dean of his father, which made him realize that this was a fucking stupid idea. What if he and Castiel’s zealotry had gotten them, their friends killed? What if he never saw his family again? He felt bile rise up his throat, but managed to not vomit everywhere.
Cas brushed away a sweaty lock of hair. “Snap twice, and they’ll let you go,” he said firmly. Immediately, Dean relaxed a little. The care and reassurance helped Dean to push away the rising anxiety and replace it with trust. Cas had his back, always.
“Fine,” Castiel said, relief in his voice as he gave the girl back her trap and placed the tiara on his head, only blushing slightly and praying to every deity that existed that Dean didn’t see him with it on.
“Yeah, you either love it or hate it,” Sam said, not mad. He looked at the clock on the wall and jerked in realization. “Oh, shit, it’s almost 3:30 A.M.! I really need to get back to my place.”
That was surprising. He chuckled, the cocky facade automatically slipping into place. “Dude, I’m fine.”
Cas was back. But the black trench coat and blazer were gone. While the black dress slacks and shoes had stayed, he had changed the rest of it.
“Take a load off, Sasquatch!” Gabriel said, patting the spot Sam had been sitting all night. The cushion was still warm from his long stay.
Apparently Dean did not either, because he scoffed. “Dude, this isn’t ‘Smith’ or ‘Johnson’. Winchester is a freakin’ weird name for two random people to have!” Dean ran both hands through his hair, trying to keep from freaking out. “Who are you?” he asked.
, too!” he motioned towards Dean and Bobby. “I don’t remember anything from before being four years old! Not my Mom, or my Dad, or the fact that I had an aunt, uncle, a
The demon snorted so hard he coughed. “Well, I’ll give you an hour, and every minute you’re late, I’ll break something important.”
Sam, Ruby, and Meg dragged themselves into the cafeteria in the early evening. The long drive back, the debriefing by Lord Death, and the trip to the infirmary to make sure both Sam’s rib and Meg’s face were healing properly had taken up most of the day. The teenagers were tired and starving, yet they managed to perk up when they spotted Dean and Cas in the usual oversized booth they usually sat at.
Castiel is standing between his slightly opened legs, biting and sucking bruises into Dean’s flesh with a one-track mind. Dean can barely put enough brain cells together to start pushing the heavy trench coat off of his shoulders into a puddle on the floor.
“Right. Certain cultures believed that the dead carried diseases that could infect the living. That’s why people stopped showing bodies in their parlors and started showing them at funeral homes. That’s why ‘parlors’ changed to ‘living rooms.’ Anyways, um, symptoms are: you get anxious, scared, terrified…” Sam ran a hand through his hair. “and then your heart stops.”
“Gabby? What happened? Who are you?” he asked the boys, at the same time moving aside to let them into his lab. Once inside he led the boys towards an empty examination table.
Dean ducked his head. “Yeah, well, I have a good idea once in a while.” He finished off the beef jerky and washed it down with the rest of the beer. He pulled out a couple of roller grill hotdogs (the only ones that hadn’t been left on the heated rollers so long they looked like mummified dicks) and scarfed them down. He spoke through full cheeks.
Dean shooed him out the door with a wave of his hands. The weapon strode to the door, gave Dean a final look (in which they shared a thumbs-up) and was gone.
As he perched himself on his elbows, watched Dean look at the blade in slight confusion, but then clarity washed over him. “I couldn’t beat him on my own, so you gave me a boost,” he said to the blade.
Sam couldn’t wait any longer; he sprinted from their cover towards his partners and the kishin-egg horde attempting to get them.
“It was a momentary lapse in judgment,” Castiel said, acting like it was nothing-- a momentary inconvenience. Dean was the only one who had seen that look of panic, so he was the only one who knew just how scared Castiel had been.
“Welp, it’s not like we got a lot of options.” Dean groaned. “It’s the only lead we have, so I guess we’ll be heading out to Wellington.”
Sam thought it over for a moment. “I do feel better. Thank you, Gabe. I guess talking to you actually did help.”
There was a few seconds of awkward tension as Dean and Sam looked at each other. “Sam,” Dean said, still grinning, but his tone was more of a question.
“Mills,” she said as she pulled out the ring of keys and selected the one to open his door. “You’re fortunate you didn’t need medical attention,” she reiterated. “Keep the partying out of my town, Agent Forge. I don’t want to see you here again.”
Sam sat up fully, and winced when his bruised chest sent a dull throb through him. He ran his fingers through his hair to get it out of his face. He looked at Ruby, and noticed her hair was wet and straight, and her clothes were changed. In fact, he could hear the shower in the other room, and the smell of strong coffee assaulted his nose.
Scraggly Beard shook his head and strode away from Dean, who stuck his tongue out at the man’s retreating back.
The little touches, those black clothes, the intensity of those eyes, that hair, that fucking voice...Dean’s dick agreed with his initial reaction to the fallen angel: sex on a silver platter.
Sam sighed in exasperation when Gabriel face froze. The meister could see Gabriel trying not to laugh, but his shaking body was not a very subtle hint at his failure. “Come on, Gabe, I’d like to have at least one conversation with you that doesn’t turn into an innuendo!”
as the Incredible Hulk killed her husband? Jesus, what the hell is in the water at Wellington, and can we get some?”
Dean’s wires were so confused for two seconds that he snorted hard at the clinical words spoken in such a deadpan voice. Cas's voice had dropped even lower, though, and he looked like he was about to eat Dean alive in every sense of the word.
movies--a cyborg. To be fair, Gabriel had been running around as a demigod for millennia; maybe that drilled some personality into him. Or, even though Cas did the same thing as still came off like an alien who has just crashed landed on Earth, maybe Cas was the odd angel out.
Crowley had been right—it had only taken Sam a few minutes to figure out the King of Hell’s cell phone number.
Cas pulled it back and even though they could not read his seemingly stoic expression, Dean could tell Cas was hurt.
Anna fiddled with her fingernails for a moment. “Not totally. I had some weird hang-ups with my dad when I was younger.”
“What…no! Baby is the car. It’s a 1967 Chevrolet Impala, and she’s as much a family member as anyone else. As soon as I graduate from here, Dad’s said I can have her.”
The entire way, he felt like he wasn’t alone. He kept checking his mirrors, but there was nothing behind him. Nothing was in the truck’s bed, and obviously, he was alone in the cabin.
, dude! I don’t know what your problem is, but you are NOT leaving that bathroom until you take a shower!”
Dean gave him the basic breakdown of the game: how the joystick and buttons work, what they did, and the goals for the game. It would be them versus the hordes of Foot soldiers and other baddies to save April O’Neil from the Shredder, their arch-nemesis. Dean was almost vibrating with excitement.
“Thanks, Sam. Good to see someone’s been paying attention to the rules of horror movies! Never, ever, go ANYWHERE.
Dean was still a hunter, but he wasn’t the same person from before his trip to Hell. He saw the other side of the tracks, whether he wanted it or not.
The former intern, and strangely enough Dean’s first kishin-egg kill, swung its body around so fast he was sent flying through a storefront window across the street.
“Well, then, if Samhain is a demon, then exorcising him should work,” Dean said. “Once he’s gone, we can work on the kishin-eggs.”
Kali shrugged. “I ran into this shop to get away from another one of my parents’ boring events a year ago or so and met Miss Blake and Miss Talbot. The items they have are fascinating, and the stories on how they got most of their stock are just as interesting—if you can get Sarah to spill the beans.”
Bobby crossed his arms. “So, how do we stop the End of Days? Because if it were just getting you outta Hell, we’d be doing jello shots off of Meghan Fox right about now, and I’m noticing a distinct lack of both.”
Rufus, still not really believing in Pamela’s abilities, had decided to pick that afternoon to chase a lead on a possible wendigo in northern Montana. It had been bittersweet, and even Sam was sad to see the giant black man leave. It was always hilarious to hear Bobby and Rufus fling sarcastic barbs at each other.
“Don’t worry about it, Sam-a-lam,” Gabriel said, his voice becoming more cheerful. He quickly tucked the personal history back under the mountain of smart-ass remarks and pranks he kept it under. Or, at least he tried to, but Sam looked so sad.
Dean was still furious, but he knew he couldn’t turn down the help. He nodded, and Carlos started to untie the tourniquet. As he pulled away the blood-drenched fabric, Dean gripped Castiel’s shoulder in pain. Despite his smaller frame, Cas was able to stand still and let Dean squeeze his shoulder until it was black and blue. “Sorry, Cas,” Dean said, but he was unable to stop his hand from squeezing again.
A grateful nod from Dean made Castiel grin slightly. “Yeah…that’s a good way to look at it. You know you’re too wise for your ripe old age of 16, you know that?”
Dean stared at Cas suspiciously, but the angel was steadfastly paying attention to whatever Sam was explaining. He slightly shook his head.
While waiting for their food Dean, out of habit, grabbed a couple of local newspapers and started flipping through one. On the front page was the last thing he wanted to see. His shoulders dropped as he sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. “Dammit.”
Dean’s opinion of watching a Godzilla movie was drowned out in a chorus of groans from the girls, though Sam and Gabriel both looked interested, as Castiel went into the living room to find the radio.
Cas pulled back, allowed Dean to take a couple of quick breaths before he went back for more. For what seemed like an eternity, he’d kiss Dean breathless, let him suck in a breath, and do it again while running his hot hands over every inch of skin. The lack of oxygen was making him a little lightheaded but in the best way possible. Dean flopped back onto the soft comforter and licked his swollen lips, eyes glazed over.
Even after a 24 hour car ride to mull it over, he still had no idea what he wanted what reaction he was hoping for.
Just before they got to the porch steps the door opened again and out emerged a man and woman. Middle-aged, the man was bearded with a trucker’s cap and in a plaid shirt and jeans. The woman had shoulder-length blonde hair beginning to change to silver, but her eyes had this hawk-like intensity that made both Castiel and Sam want to snap to attention. Dean strode up the steps and didn’t even bother to say hello before he dragged them into a hug.
The phone labeled FBI started to ring, and Bobby winced. As he begrudgingly went to answer it he motioned upstairs. “Take your brother some tea and toast,” he ordered.
“Sam,” he said, his calm tone belying the churning fury underneath. “Something you wanna share with the class?”
“If someone shot through your fuel tank, you’d be pissed too, don’t make me out to be the crazy one.”
Most of Night Vale’s citizens woke up in their beds, ‘re-spawned’ as kishin-egg victims always did in Night Vale, and per usual, no one remembered a thing. Only the Meisters, the Weapons, and the Electoral Candidates knew what had happened during the night.
“The three of you need to head out back and bring back evergreen stakes,” Bobby said. “El, there should be some lamb’s blood frozen in the freezer downstairs.”
Though he didn't want to let him go, Dean leaned back so he could look at Cas better. “What happened, Cas?”
A sensation that felt like a cross between a shiver of fear and the pain of numb nerves waking up, the jolt was uncomfortable, but passed quickly.
Dean howled Cas's name as he came. Back arched up, toes curled into the blanket, tears squeezed from his eyes as the intense pleasure seized him. It felt like he couldn't stop like his dick forget there was a limit to how much was in the tank. For what seemed like forever, Cas swallowed everything with his single-minded determination until, finally, there was nothing left.
“Yeah, but it’s going to be weird if my feet are sticking out of your ass.” That was definitely a contender on his
Dean had to agree, though. Finally, Chuck's strings were cut, the biggest bad of them all toppled. Finally, they could have the lives they wanted. Finally, Sam wouldn't be the third wheel to their star-crossed pining for each other anymore.
Bobby was sitting in another chair. “Can ya stop threatening to beat my son, or at least not do it in front of me?” he asked wearily.
Eileen got down a mug and made herself some coffee before sitting next to Cas. “Morning,” she said and signed.
Cas seemed to take a breath and gather himself. “How long are you planning on continuing to see them?” he asked quietly.
“Alright I think that might be enough for one day,” Dean said. Sam rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassment coloring his checks.
“I know, I’m sorry. I’m just...I’m so tired of being the family freak, Dean. The family fuck-up,” Sam said bitterly.
But he was the last real tether to Cas. It was in his face, his mannerisms, his nature. The physical resemble was kinda creepy, too. Dean had the idea that Jack had done that on purpose* before he was born. Maybe as a way to bond with Cas and distance himself from Lucifer?
“We aren’t Jack,” Dean said quickly. “Nothing’s more stubborn than a Winchester. You and me,” Dean waved between them. “We decide. There’s no fate but what we make for ourselves.”
Castiel nodded, and Dean clapped his hands. “Great, throw up some angel-proofing and some new throw pillows, and we’ll nail that ‘cozy torture dungeon’ look that’s in this year.”
“Knowing he’s alive and willingly abandoned us is worse than thinking he’s been dead this whole time,” Cas admitted quietly.
Sam looked at Meg and immediately felt guilty when he saw how pale and worn out she looked, even after eating the kishin-egg. Never mind that Sam was suffering some serious rib breakage and clown-inspired PTSD.
“Well…I mean…maybe a little. It’s just…normally guys and girls are partnered up. So, I was, uh, just as surprised when it worked. Apparently everyone who had tried to hold him got their hands burned,” Dean explained. He hoped his embarrassing parents took the hint to steer clear of any more girl-talk.
“You know she knows that room as well as we do,” Sarah said with a shrug. “If you want to close up the shop I’ll act as a chaperone.”
It was very much like sitting in the passenger seat of his car. Unable to do more than look out of the windows and offer commentary on the world around them.
“Oh, then I’m sorry, my mistake.” Crowley popped Sam across the back of the head. “What, do you think I should give you a cookie for
Cas, who sat on the trunk of another junker, hands clasped between his knees, conceded. “It’s the truth. But Dean, it would help if you weren’t so...you...at the moment.”
Sam ran his fingers through his hair, an embarrassed blush creeping up his cheeks. “Shut up,” he mumbled, then moaned. “Ow, shit, that hurts.”
Castiel tiled his head while giving Dean an intense stare. “I never lifted a hand towards them,” he said, eyes narrowed in confusion.
Something tickled the back of Dean’s brain; something was off, was wrong. Before he could do anything, the unnatural baying could be heard outside the house. Dean’s blood ran cold. “Oh, God no,” he said to himself.
“To catch us an angel,” Gabriel said. “The oil is inert by itself, but once lit, no angel can cross the flames. To make sure this box is impenetrable, we need an angel’s grace."
Sam shrugged. “He’s like the Hugh Hefner type, right? He probably doesn’t want the party to end, so he might be willing to prevent this entire mess from coming to pass.”
There was a thoughtful pause. “Would it ease your burden if I told you that I’ve already seen your ‘junk?’”
Sam slid into the backseat of the old Chevelle and looked up to see Dean and Castiel turned in their seats to give him excited looks. Well, Dean looked excited—Castiel looked more intrigued than anything. The butterflies Sam had been feeling all afternoon intensified into a whirlwind in his stomach, but he put on an impassive face.
“Sam’s been drilling us on techniques relentlessly the past few weeks,” Meg said as they walked off the mats. There were some darker circles under the girls’ eyes that hadn’t been there before, Kali noticed.
“Dad, I’m fine here,” Dean said, his voice testy. “Safest place in the world, the Grim Reaper lives here! Now, what happened to make you have to save Rufus’s bacon?”
“Yes sir. We’re in Sioux Falls right now,” Dean said to the reaper. “Actually, sir, we wanted to let you know that we, uh, ran into some trouble as soon as we got here.”
"And yet you still manage to disappoint me," he said coldly. He motioned to the other side of the junkyard, where Dean could just barely hear quiet talking. "You were supposed to protect Sam. Or deal with him. Not become
Sam pulled out a small flashlight from his pocket and passed out three stakes for each boy. fThey glanced back at the cars and flashing lights and could hear distinct yelling, but as they crept farther into the pitch blackness, even that was left behind.
“No. No way, no way! You’re getting me confused with someone else,” Sam said adamantly, crossing his arms.
There weren’t any monsters running around and hurting people. That should’ve been a good thing. So why did it feel like his friends were falling apart because of it?
Dean sat in the silence of the car; cars and trucks passing next to him once in a while made the whole Impala shake. He gingerly touched the back of his right hand, where Castiel’s hand had gripped him. Dean bit his lip, feeling two minds about the entire situation.
Before Dean could answer, the jingle of keys against the lock announced Sam’s arrival. His brother had returned with a bag of food and not great news.
Sam had steeled himself for it, but it felt like a punch to the heart when Bobby and Ellen looked at him and didn’t seem to know him. He felt defeated and deflated—he’d been hoping…
“Let’s go for pancakes,” Ruby suggested. Sam shrugged and Meg agreed, pancakes were the perfect post kishin-hunt breakfast. They gravitated to the red and black Kawasaki motorcycles parked in front of the motel room. Ruby hopped on her bike and it roared to life; Meg got onto the other one and Sam hesitated for a few seconds before wrapping his arms around her waist as he settled behind her. Luckily when the girls came to the DWMA they packed an extra helmet, and it fit Sam with a little room for growth.
He gritted his teeth at the thought of bright, smartass Sam getting ripped apart by Hellhounds in front of him. Dean’s stomach twisted in knots.
Castiel processed this for a moment. “Why not show her the inventions you make when you should be working on homework? Those are accurate indications of intelligence and technical prowess.”
The Grim Reaper managed to look suspicious. “You really think Sam is…enhancing himself in some way?”
“So…does this mean you can drop all those charges from earlier?” Rufus piped up. “And…maybe uncuff me?” he asked, wiggling his fingers at them.
“Actually, I was wondering if you had a radio?” Castiel asked. “I was hoping to continue listening to the Night Vale broadcast…”
Secondly, I just wanted to mention that I describe what I think Cecil looks like, but I know Cecil's appearance isn't canon, so I just wanted to say you don't have to take what I say as the final word. I just happen the like the crazier look for him. :)
The hunter’s arms shook from holding the crowbar, but he pushed through the exertion. He kept his eyes on Castiel, but they widened in surprise.
Cas watched, fascinated, as Dean continued to mess up the most basic phrases he’d learned and perfected months ago. Seeing the building frustration on his face, Cas reached over and put his hand over Dean’s fumbling fingers, stilling them.
He was spared from answering since the waitress returned with two glasses of water and a basket of fresh French fries. He grabbed the glass and began downing it immediately, eyes darting all over.
Dean licked his lips, and Cas watched, slightly distracted. He narrowed his eyes at the hunter.  “Did you just refer to me as a candy bar?” A bitter smile crossed Cas's face. The leather seat creaked as Cas turned back and watched the farms and fields they were driving past.
Kid sighed in defeat. “Yes, sir.” There was a gleam in his yellow eyes. He wasn’t about to let this go so easily.
“Hey,” Dean said, causing them to turn towards him. “Same time, same place tomorrow?” Dean asked, hopefully. Ruby looked at Sam and shrugged. Sam nodded after a moment, “Sure.”
The old man looked away from Dean and lifted his cap to scratch under it. “Dunno. He took off pretty soon after you...I couldn’t keep up with him.”
As he blew over the top, he glanced up at Dean’s pale face. “Dude, I know I need a shower; leave it alone.”
"Guys, this is great!" Sam said, almost bouncing in excitement. When everyone turned to look at him, he blurted out, "Anna, if we can find your grace, can we use it?"
“Yes, mine. What, is there an echo here? I was doing just fine until you idiots showed up and distracted it!”
Castiel looked Meg over slowly. Well, the sisters’ clothing style made sense, it seemed. His blue eyes locked onto her brown ones, and he stared at her intensely for several seconds. Meg was getting used to Castiel’s stares but she quickly looked away this time. “What?”
He sat there for a few moments, flashes of old memories and Crowley’s taunting voice flickering through his mind like a horrible nightmare. He didn’t know what to do. His hand moved into his bag and he pulled out the vial. For the first time he felt true revulsion at what he was holding. This whole time he’d managed to forget what it actually was—blood.
“Sorry Sam, almost done,” she said. “I think Bobby might’ve jumped the gun, I’m not seeing anything—oh, wait a second.”
The image of Gabriel in a suit with a little gold bowtie made Sam pause. “Um, no, it’s never come up.”
After a half-hour of drawing the sigils, Bobby and Sam were sporting bandages, but Dean’s cut was already healed.
“Glad to hear I’m making you work for it,” Dean sassed, voice a little subdued. He cleared his throat. “Once this is all said and done, I guess we’ll, uh….” Strangely, Dean was hesitant to think about condemning Castiel to die.
When Sam saw Dean ogling nothing he touched his brother’s shoulder. “Oh, hey, Cas! You look good,” he said easily.
Kali looked around. “Where?” she asked. There was no sign of any control boxes for a security system or any sensor for a silent alarm.
Little idiot gets the hottest girl I’ve seen at this school? What the hell! Did I do something wrong in a past life? Dean thought, still a bit sore about not getting a girl partner.
Seconds later, the pain faded to a dull ache, and Castiel released them both. He pulled back and swayed slightly in the seat.
“Gabriel, you do realize that your grades affect me, too, right? I’ll be the laughingstock of the school when everyone sees how poorly you did. They’ll think you’re an idiot and bemoan my having you for my partner! This could completely de-rail early graduation, everything I’ve been working towards!”
Sam ignored Gabriel and motioned for them to stay low and quiet.  “Where the hell are my weapons?!” Sam asked in a panicked tone.
I'm excited about this fic, and I bet you are too! Please *subscribe* for updates, this one is going to be a bit sporadic.
The look of understanding showed him that Cas had caught the bus, after all. “Why would you...I’m not even in a proper vessel,” he questioned. Okay so, Cas somehow got the bus going in the opposite direction.
Gabriel looked around the place again. “You sell dangerous occult objects from a shop in the middle of New York City?”
“Yeah, you could say that,” Dean said as Carlos started looking at the bandage. He wandered over to a series of cabinets and started to get bandages, clean rags, and other tools. “Intern Michael was a dick.”
“As fascinating as this is,” Gabriel interjected. “Gonna need to hit the road. If she knows anything about angels...it’s bad enough you figured me out, anyone else, and it could get back to Heaven.” Gabriel shook his head. “Better I take off now, save my cover.”
Sam looked at them from the corner of his eyes, and narrowed them slightly. It was a look of incredible sadness, but also barely-held in anger. He bit his lip and looked away, but said quietly “Just…don’t bring it up again, okay?”
Speaking of pay, Dean pulled the golden credit card out of his wallet. “I’ve got a golden ticket,” he sang to himself under his breath.
“We were nothing but a giant target in this. On foot we might actually be able to move around without drawing too much attention to ourselves,” Sam said. Dean shot the traitor a glare.
“Well, when the Grim Reaper’s personal Weapon gives you an order, it’s probably in everyone’s best interest that you follow it.” Gabriel kept holding his hand out. “And your name is…?”
Unable to move because Dean was leaned over and still had his wrists trapped, Cas was panting and groaning in frustration--Dean was holding his hips up so Cas couldn't even try to rub against him. His eyes flashed with lust, and his skin was starting to get a slight sheen of sweat.
“Okay, okay, knock it off,” Dean said, cutting everyone off. “You aren’t Bloods and Crips; knock off the gang crap. We’re all weapons and meisters, here, right? This means we’re all on the same side against kishins and monsters. Which means our problems are not with each other.”
“Aw, someone’s got a fan-girl,” Dean teased, rolling away from Sam’s fist. He got back to his feet, mirroring Sam, who was looking a little winded.
When he saw how seriously Cas was eyeing him, he snickered. “Dude, ever heard of a refractory period? I need a minute.”
Dean was unsure if that was a jab at Cas’s deceased bloodline or if he was trying to offer something and was being a real asshole about it. He decided it was both.
That’s when she let out a loud, annoyed yet slightly intrigued sigh. “Gabriel, what are you doing now?”
Sam bit his lip, trying to stay calm but close to tears. Dean could tell from how his shoulders bunched up and how his face scrunched to keep it together. He spoke hesitantly. “Azazel’s Special Children were all fed some of his blood when we were babies. I found out at Cold Oak. And no, I don’t know why he did it.”
“Me too, son. Maybe together we can both beat some sense into him,” Bobby said. He tilted his head to study Sam. “Any of that ring a bell?”
“You let me sleep in,” he said, almost in an accusing tone. Mostly because he was always the first one up, and usually had to drag the girls from their beds in order to get to class on time.
Cas said before giving the controls back to Dean and materialized in a place next to him, arms still crossed.
When Dean pulled down another can of soup from the pantry, Sam complained, nose wrinkling, “Ugh, please no more sick people food; it’s starting to have the opposite effect.”
Dean mumbled under his blanket but was quiet. Since his eyelids were starting to droop anyway, Sam decided the weapon was right.
They headed up to the attic, guns drawn. Ascending the old stairs, they tried to keep quiet but a creak sounded under Dean’s boot. He just got to the top of the landing when he noticed movement in the back corner of the room. Once actually in the attic, Dean took a quick glance around. The place was dark, with low ceilings with dark wooden beams and arches. Old metal lanterns hung from the ceiling, there were cobwebs and dust everywhere. The usual things people kept in attics were here too, like dusty cardboard boxes, wooden picture frames, bags, and a mannequin for sewing. There were some differences. Tons of religious art were everywhere, there were displays of ritual stuff (Dean wondered if they should help themselves for future hunts) there were multiple statues of the Virgin Mary. The most impressive was a white marble statue of her close to the other side of the room.
A yawn surprised him as he leaned down to grab his shirt to pull back on. Noticing Cas sitting back, something made him lean forward and very purposefully mess up Cas’s hair and tug his tie just slightly loose and askew. “Dean?” Cas asked.
After a moment, he took the beer from the angel’s hand. It was a real beer, the glass cold enough to make his fingertips ache. When he cracked it open and it smelled normal, Dean gulped it down in a few practiced swallows. He carefully placed the empty bottle on the asphalt by his feet.
Before Rufus could retort Ellen held up her hands between them. “Can we just count our lucky stars that this night is over, please?” she said. The two men rolled their eyes but nodded. Ellen filled up their shot glasses one last time and they clinked them together in a silent toast of congratulations.
Castiel berated him for his bad decisions. Dean deflected because he knew, okay, Cas? He knew he’d fucked up the hunt. Knew that if Cas hadn’t been there, he’d be dead.
“Nah,” Dean said cavalierly, taking a chance and winking at him because Castiel had sounded more annoyed than serious. “You’d miss me too much.”
Sam huffed, his temper starting to overrule his caution. “I didn’t summon you here for you to insult me,” he said.
Castiel changed back into his human form just in time to catch the monsters’ intended victim, Gabby. The girl was still unconscious, but luckily she was uninjured and light in stature.
"It was weird," Anna started before she paused again, gathering her thoughts. “So, I think I was around 2ish or so when I remembered that my Father coming home from the Church scared me. I was convinced my Dad wasn’t my actual Father and that the real one was furious and out to get me. I would hide in the closet or under my bed when he came home.”
Despite Mother Nature's tantrum outside, after several long moments, his mind began to calm. In a flash of light, he saw Cas’s slumped shoulders.
Dean raced past the bathroom and rounded the corner into the kitchen, muttering to himself the entire time. Cas took the moment to head into their room and change his clothes quickly.
Cas pulled his head from his hands and ran one hand through his hair, a tic he’d picked up from watching the brothers for years. “Find anything, Sam?”
“This is actually pretty par for the course, if the other broadcasts are any indication,” the weapon said calmly, looking out the windows at the quiet town around them. The radio station was not very large, but it did have a tall tower atop it with a blinking red light flashing continuously. “It’s just like I imagined it would. Quiet and quaint, yet harboring a great evil just out of sight.”
Gabriel plopped himself on the couch. “First of all, just call me Gabriel.” He eyed the beer bottle and grinned. “Secondly, can I have one, too?”
“Yeah, so does earthquakes and tsunamis,” Dean said. He started to chuckle, but ended up hissing in pain instead. “Anyways, the real question is, how does a scrawny guy like yourself almost break my face with one hit?”
A second later, Castiel was sitting in the middle of the bench behind him. Dean took his flannel and curled it into a ball for a makeshift pillow and contorted his body so he could lay down. The fallen angel’s messy hair was just visible from Dean’s perspective.
“Congrats, boy, you’ve offed your first kishin-egg,” he said with a Scottish accent. “Do you feel tingly in your nethers?”
“Nah, we’ll be fine,” Meg said with a shrug. Sam wondered if the sisters might be tempted to put their weapon/weapon training to use in his absence.
Once his morning wood situation had worn off enough not to be an embarrassment, Dean stood with a dramatic groan and stretched, scratching his stomach idly.
They piled into the kitchen, and hasty introductions were made. Dean wasn’t expecting a woman about his age, long brunette hair, ripped jeans, and a black tank top with Nirvana on it. Having been sitting on the couch in Bobby’s study, she came up to them, smiling a dazzling smile.
“Dammit, Baby Girl!” He whipped around and ignored the Sheriff’s order to stop, ready to dash back into the cave, but it was unnecessary. From the mouth of the cave came the shuffling forms of six missing kids, dressed in everything from school clothes to pajamas, looking dirty, hungry, and exhausted. Leading the pack was Jo, holding Owen Mills’ good hand and helping him walk out of the cave entrance.
“Hey!” Dean yelled. Both the Krampus and Jo looked up at the three intruders. Dean saw one of the Krampus’ eyes was missing, bloody hole left when the eye had been gouged out. That’s where the blood on Jo’s blade had come from, he realized with a swell of pride.
When Cas gently brushed over a hickey Dean cleared his throat. “Please leave them,” he said, trying not to blush in embarrassment. “Don’t, uh, heal them up. I want a reminder.”
He tried to shake the anger, but he couldn’t. He wasn’t sure if he’d kept Dean safe or made him more of a target, and that thought made his stomach flip-flop dangerously.
Thanks for reading, and I really hope you're enjoying it so far! Please leave kudos or comments, they make my day!
“No wonder she’s pissed,” the hunter gasped between breathes. “God, I haven’t had that good a laugh in forever! I think you better lay low, let her cool her jets tonight. You can crash on the couch, just don’t draw mustaches on us while we sleep.”
“I don’t think this was an attack aimed at us,” Sam said. “The DWMA, I mean. Nor do I think the town was directly the target.”
“Are you going to tell me what’s going on, or are you just here to be his cheerleader?” Sam asked. Cas narrowed his eyes, but he pulled Sam to his feet and helped him lay on his back on the cot. Dean grabbed the chair at the desk and dragged it over to sit at Sam’s head. He carefully placed the washcloth back on Sam’s forehead.
Cas ducked and kicked Dean’s leg out from under him. “Shit!” Dean landed on his back but flipped back up onto his feet and returned to standing.
Hi readers! Sorry for the long delay—this was supposed to be a Christmas arc, but holiday stress, family, and a crazy work schedule actually made me suffer from severe sleep deprivation. I couldn’t do anything more than stare at my computer for most of the past few weeks. Again, I’m sorry! Please enjoy this newest update!
"Alright," Dean said, finally starting to catch up. Shocking his hands in his pockets, he leaned towards Cas. "So, how come when you Fell, you were playing house with the Milton's while Cas got thrown into the Pit?" Dean demanded, anger building on Cas's behalf.
Castiel slid in the mud but dove forward and successfully grabbed Jo’s hands just as she was about to take a 6-foot fall back to the bottom. He pulled her up quickly and wrapped his arms around her protectively, using himself as a shield. He dashed to safety, getting to the other side of the cave and out of the way of the fighting.
, he was ready; the knot in his stomach, which had been a constant ache all day (if not the past several days) only seemed to grow as darkness fell over the city.
Gabriel shook her hand and was about to say something else when two voices could be heard coming from a doorway hidden behind another black velvet drape. A short and balding man appeared, clutching something in his hand. Behind him came another woman, a little older than Sarah, with mousy brown hair and piercing eyes that had a cunning edge to them. She was dressed in a business suit and had her hair tucked up in a loose bun. She was dazzling, and she had a confident air to her that was just this side of arrogant. “So, as I was saying, this should work very well for you, sir,” she purred with an English accent.
When they returned to the bunker, Sam let out a yelp of surprise and happiness that had him bolting down the stairs to the map room. As Dean came in, he heard Eileen’s excited yell for his brother. He saw their tear-filled reunion as Sam picked her up and spun her around in his arms. They kissed frantically and desperately.
He leaned over and grabbed the ragged shoebox of tapes, and ran his fingers over them. He wanted to put on Zepp but moved on and instead picked some Nirvana. Anna buckled her seat belt and started gently tapping her foot in time to "Smells like Teen Spirit."
Castiel leaned forward, and Dean unconsciously leaned away. Even out of the corner of his eye, he saw the confused head-tilt. “Dean?”
“I, uh, I dunno. Maybe? There’s some things that I guess I’m supposed to be remembering, but I’m not. So, what’re you gonna do? Poke around and see what’s there?”
Hating his reaction to the monster, Dean turned his fear into aggression as he snarled, “Who the hell are you?”
Gabriel shrugged. “I can’t deny you the best part of my personality, but I can make sure you get front row seats to the show instead. Fair?”
Cas swayed as he sat there for a moment, his face scrunched up as he tried to think clearly. He licked his dry lips and Dean found himself distracted.
“So we can both talk to you on a ‘conference call while we’re in public,’” Sam said. “As someone who also is also attached to Dean’s hip 24/7, I know I’d relish being able to talk to someone else, anyone else, sometimes.”
3) My beta and friend Static_Saturn was the one who helped me with the Bohemian Rhapsody breakdown and interpretation and I am so grateful for it. Thank you!
Gabriel smirked and rewound the movie a good ten minutes, and Sam sighed in defeat as he had to sit through the bone-dry acting and clichéd lines once again.
Within him, Cas suddenly came alive. He’d been silent and still the whole ride up to this point. He still wasn’t completely sure they were okay or not.
He started getting tongue-tied when Cas fixed his eyes on him, so he’d sounded like a gibbering idiot more so than usual. He let Cas listen to his music first, and had even bought a salad for the guy. But for the most part he’d been able to ignore it—until they got to the apartment. When Cas walked out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and hair wet from the shower, Dean had shoved the laptop on his lap and prayed Cas didn’t question why it was sitting a little cock-eyed (no pun intended).
Dean tried to run a hand through his hair, but they were still pretty greasy despite his best efforts. He refrained and wiped his hand on his thigh instead. “Cas is trying to get me to learn how to use his telekinetic crap, but he’s a shitty teacher.”
Gathering his nerve, Dean blurted out, “Bobby thinks you're an angel.” He crossed his arms and watched the man before him. “So, wanna give me the low-down on what you actually are?”
He glanced over his shoulder at his sad brother and best friend; suddenly, Sam had a game plan. It was so dumb, it might actually work.
King of Halloween,” Sam said. He pulled Kali’s phone from his pocket and showed them a picture of the supposed creature. It looked like a normal human, but its eyes were pale blue.
Cas gripped Dean’s forearm to stop him from launching himself at Gabriel. The asshole snapped his fingers and started munching on a Twix, smirking at them.
“Neither Heaven nor Hell is expecting us to work together to stop them. We have an advantage, and we must press it at every opportunity. Do you understand?”
Memories of the cabin felt sour now. He fidgeted with the sleeve of his shirt. It was getting hot in the driver’s seat as the sun beat down on them, but he couldn’t let Sam see the marks and bruises. He still wasn’t sure how he felt about them anymore.
“Big enough to give me nightmares about it rolling after us and crushing the car with us inside,” Dean answered with a goofy grin. “I was just a kid when I saw it. How about you, Sam?”
“So…no pressure,” Dean tried to joke, but it fell on flat ears as they realized that this could be the beginning of a very, very bad thing, and they were the only ones who could see the bullet coming before it hit.
Gabriel tugged at his neck, the golden bow tie matching the vest he wore, which matched Kali’s dress. He stopped mid-step and gave her a look. “I really don’t like crowds,” he told her in no uncertain terms. “Like, really
“Got a case,” Sam explained, swallowing the last bite of a powdered donut. “You remember an old hunter named Travis? Worked a few cases with Dad back in the day?”
The fluttering in his stomach tried to turn sour but he wouldn't let it. Don't wanna ruin Cas's work.
“What the hell was that for!” Dean snapped as a wooden spoon smacked into his head. She came around to sit on another couch across from them. She was wearing an apron, so the spoon made a little more sense.
“It doesn’t matter. Forget him, Cas. He’s clearly cut his ties and moved on. Sam is smart. We’ll come up with something else.”
Despite being such a big woman, she seemed to shrink in on herself just a little when their collective gaze was locked on her.
When Sam glanced at the screen again, he cleared his throat. “As is only fair, I get to pick the next movie.”
Dean could understand why Luther would curse Frank. Despite being innocent, he’d been road-hauled with a chain up and down the road outside his place of employment until he was ‘past dead.’ Secretly, Dean thought Frank deserved his comeuppance. What he didn’t agree with was being forced to experience Luther’s death in slow motion.
“Are you telling me you never got an order you initially obeyed, only to realize later on how much of a mistake it was?”
Dean/Cas just hit 100k stories on ao3! Such an amazing accomplishment and while I haven't gotten to add many to that number, I'm happy I got to be part of this community for the last few months. It's been a joy :)
Dean had to concentrate so he wouldn’t balk at the sheer number of demons in the room. At least two dozen strong (all with swirling black faces) surrounded Sam and Ruby, gagged and tied up to two wooden chairs. Sam had a shiner over his eye but seemed otherwise unhurt, and Ruby sported a bloody split lip. Dean was surprised she put up a fight but had to give kudos she'd tried (for Sam at least).
Finally, the small canyon came into view as he crested the last hill. It was small, the canyon itself only about fifty feet high and a few hundred feet long, but it would work. It was a small, hidden place away from prying eyes, and that’s what Sam needed.
“You really think—actually, truly believe--that I would ditch you over a friggin’ gash? God, do I really come off as that big an asshole to you? Seriously? It’s my job to watch out for both you and me, you idjit,” he said, channeling Bobby for a moment. “You know what I did without you for years? I hunted monsters, and not a shadow monster with a bad taste in hairdos, either. Ghosts, demons, a rugaru. I killed a friggin’ werewolf on my own, Cas, and I’m still breathing. Why are you so hung up on me abandoning you, ditching you for another partner?”
Now in nothing but a pair of black boxer briefs, his wristwatch, and his jewelry, Dean shivered at both the cool air from the fan overhead and the icy looks from his brother and oldest friend. He felt self-conscious as they looked him over. The salt-encrusted, iron walls of the panic room seemed to be pressing in on him as he clasped his hands in front of his crotch. Strangely, his amulet felt warm on his chest.
Afterwards, introductions were made around the table. Meg and Ruby looked happy to have another female at the table.
Sam smacked a fist down onto the kitchen table angrily. It was hard to tell who was more surprised, the adults or Sam himself. He could feel the anger simmering inside him, churning in his gut and making his hands shake. He never lashed out like this. He immediately pulled his hand back, looking at it like it had moved all on its own.
Dean chuckled. “If I can go out and kill a werewolf on my own and not die, I’m allowed to drink a beer once in a while.” He tipped his open drink at Cas, and winked. “Dad’s words, not mine.”
Gabriel, Dean, and Cas were in the cafeteria almost a week later and eating dinner when there were suddenly three familiar visages walking towards them. Ruby looked vaguely annoyed and Meg had a minuscule smirk turning up the edge of her lips; the girls were followed by a shaggy-haired meister who wasn’t looking at the table as they approached.
It wasn't until he started syncing his lungs to the motion that he realized he was hyperventilating, heart thumping, and lungs working in painful overtime.
“So, as long as Samhain and the woman in white are still out there, there’s nothing we can do to take out the kishin-eggs, or the zombies, permanently,” Sam summed up.
, he thought bitterly. Then he realized that that coat, and the ass hidden underneath it, literally didn’t exist.
“It’s not just his speech. When he tried to write up a text, it was also gibberish.” Cas could hear Sam typing away on his laptop from the other end of the line, so he quietly waited.
, he told himself. Bobby and Rufus were fine and the town was saved. Just another fun-filled day in the life of a hunter.
“We didn’t get a chance to clear anything up,” Bobby said. “Krampus snatched Jo almost as soon as they got here. Dean’s been holding out on this so he could surprise us. Well, it was a nice damned surprise, but I don’t think Dean remembers what happened either. If he did, I don’t think he would’ve been so nonchalant.”
The book itself was a history book, but it was a lot more detailed than the basic one the freshmen were reading. This book gave the bloody details of battles, the effects of spells and potions both used by Witches and the DWMA. It was easy to see why this book was off limits to freshmen, someone might get bad ideas in their head.
Castiel couldn’t help but feel a bit hurt at Dean’s outburst. He opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off. Suddenly standing before them was a man in a black business suit and red hair. It was Spirit Alban, the current Death Scythe. He grinned at them. “Congratulations, boys. You’re now partners!”
Also, the movies mentioned in this fic are "Sand Sharks," a dubious Jaws/Tremors knock-off that's actually a lot of fun to watch, and "Pontypool" a really awesome Canadian horror movie with a pretty interesting take on zombies. I highly recommend both, and last I knew they were both on Netflix.
Castiel’s eyes widened and he leaned forward, looking at Meg and Ruby. “You two are…angels?” he asked in confusion.
The meisters huddled up, back’s to each other and ready to fight. Castiel returned to his bladed form, though the pain in Dean’s back was fogging his brain slightly.
Kali paused in her rant to see his partner not even look at her. He was staring at his shoes, scuffing the floor underneath them. She put her hands on her hips and stared at him, waiting for him to say something.
Kali tore her eyes away from the man and saw Gabriel staring at him with his mouth agape in apparent shock. “Gabriel?”
