“They’ll hear anyway,” said Cas. “This is just a courtesy call. The entire city is going to hear what I have to say.”
“Oh,” says Dean. “Yeah, I thought about it. But it’s just…”
“We don’t want to,” says Dean, voice conciliatory. Con man perfect. What he says next is a little less certain. “You don’t have to like it, y’know.”
Jack isn’t sure. Billie is gone, the loudest thing in the room. But the rest of the universe is gone too, no longer a roar of background noise in Jack’s head. He doesn’t know if he’s glad for that or not. He had liked feeling it as somewhere in a greenhouse in Buenos Aires a well tended flower started to bloom, the smallness of new life hitting him over and over again. Now, there was nothing. Not even Amara’s poised stillness, her coiled tight wariness, her protective darkness.
And then, they stopped. It felt right to step back just then. As if one more second would have been too much to bear.
“Don’t help,” he said to her quietly. She backed away before the boy could turn around and see who Castiel was talking to, and by the time the boy had turned around, Castiel had run out of the exit and down the street. He took the first right he could and then took a circuitous route as far away from the diner as he could manage, running in a manner meant to look urgent but not terrified. He relaxed when he was about a mile away and slowed his running to a slow walk. It looked as though he had gotten away in one piece.
“I’m not in love with you anymore,” Castiel realized, saying it softly. It was a relief and something shameful at the same time. “Anna-“
“We never weren’t friends, Cas. It takes more than a few days of ill tempered conversation to drive me away.”
“Not a word.”
***************
“Hey,” said Benny, frowning up at Cas from where he’d been helping repair the minor amount of damage that had occurred the night before. “I thought you were going away forever. You stomped off like a toddler throwing a tantrum and everything.”
She cut herself off, then looked up at Cas. Her expression was blank.
“Alright, you both suck,” Maggie broke in tiredly. “Is everyone happy now?”
And then it’s gone. All that’s left is an itching sensation in his thigh. Unthinking, Sam opens his eyes to find himself wrapped loosely in some kind of tarp. His hands slip through something wet and a little sticky as he reaches down to scratch at his leg, and feels a string sticking out of his leg. He pulls at it, and a small hex bag falls out, his skin closing up behind it. It takes him a second to realize what has happened.
“I think Dean will be okay,” Eileen says, taking one of Sam’s hands in her own. “I don’t think you’re the one he really needs to talk to.”
Sam knows why. There’s a certain amount of energy needed in holding a spell like this for any length of time. If he’s in the room with Jack, and Jack is sucking up all that energy, the spell will fail without his input to maintain it. Something he might have thought of if he wasn’t in a blind panic and watching as his brother, his best friend, someone who is as good as his kid, and someone who is as good as Jody’s kid walk into a room together where the chances of them all getting out unharmed are slim to none. He doesn’t know how Patience made that decision. Except he does, of course he does.
Because no one trusts you, Castiel thought to himself.
FEBRUARY 7, 111 A.L. - IRA
“Might even break a sweat,” he says, holding Claire’s sword out in front of him. Claire tightens her grip on her switchblade, ready for the fight to break out again. There’s something in her blood that’s singing, and despite everything she really does feel like she’s good at this. Like something inside her comes alive when it’s her against someone else and death presses up against her like the edge of a knife. It’s the way she used to feel when she said grace as a kid, a kind of peace and calm that goes beyond herself. It just feels good.
“If it can be the capital, people will want it to remain the capital,” said Mortimer calmly. “Over time, we can renegotiate exactly what we are going to do with the city, but for now we need to show everybody that a return to the state is impossible. If we leave anything in place that could cause the country to move backwards, it will. People learn to love the things that bind them.”
“We escaped?” Cas asked out loud, not wanting to open his eyes just yet. No one answered at first. Then he heard the sound of someone shifting in a chair and he turned his head to slowly blink open his eyes and see Dean sitting in an upholstered chair that had obviously been dragged into the room.
“Yeah, that’s right,” says Claire, opening another jerky package. Dean glares at her. “What?”
“While I understand the king of the forest outranks me-“ Castiel had began, intent on delivering a scathing speech that was cut off by an outburst of laughter on all sides and Benny’s somewhat mortified expression. He glared at his men, who were now attempting to stifle themselves under his stern gaze.
“You know?” he said flatly, sounding darkly amused. “Yeah, I don’t think so. I’m not gonna kill him, Cas.”
“I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about Lydia,” said Dean, sounding defeated. “Cas isn’t even here right now, and you know it’s not like that.”
“Trust me when I say, that’s something you have to figure out for yourself,” he said, with a shake of his head. “Honestly, it’s not really my thing, but… I don’t know, I figured you’d like it. Try- try page fifty four. It starts ‘Some keep the Sabbath going to Church’. Layla liked that one, and you two… you’ve got similar vibes.”
He would have defended himself within moments if he hadn’t turned to see the person who had done this was Samandriel, who dropped his hand as soon as Castiel recognized him. He spoke quickly, and Castiel struggled to keep up.
“We were told to fire on children. She refused. I was told to shoot her.”
“Okay,” he said. “You knew her?”
Dagon left and Castiel kept his eyes down as he maneuvered himself into a more dignified position sitting on the ground. It was too late not to draw attention to himself, but he was doing his best anyway.
Corbett shook his head. Castiel watched as Dean looked between the two of them, clearly looking for signs of discontent. It still bothered him that they had almost deserted, and Castiel wondered if that wasn’t a big reason for him choosing to include them in this mission. Then again, it could just be that Mary had wanted anyone with the potential to cause trouble taken out of the picture. It seemed a little suspicious that the key orchestrators of Kelly’s escape (namely Castiel, Jo, Risa, Maggie, and Corbett) had all been sent off into the desolate (in Castiel’s somewhat biased mind anyone) and frigid country they were now in.
“I understand,” Castiel confirmed. Naomi dismissed both him and Meg after this. Cas was glad she had kept his further instructions short, and only asked Meg to give Castiel the small clicker she had been using to keep in touch with Superbia while at camp. He knew Morse code, of course, and now had a direct line to Naomi if he needed clarification on anything or to share information without returning to Superbia.
“Mandy,” said Ellen a little more sternly. Mandy sighed.
After several hours spent staring at nothing and thinking over his absolute failure to prevent the resistance from forming a reasonable plan to execute against Naomi, Castiel decided if he wanted to get any sleep, he might have to tire himself out. He quietly got up, and put on clothing warm enough for the cooler air, but still breathable so he wouldn’t soak through them with sweat while he was running.
“You’re awake,” she realized about a minute later, when she noticed his eyes were open. “Or you’re creepily sleeping with you’re eyes open.”
“You were protecting me.”
“What about you?” Eileen signs back. “Do you want a pet?”
They sit in the silence of that for a moment. It makes Castiel feel very small, which is almost grounding. It makes him feel alive in a way he hasn’t since the Empty took him. There is a familiarity in being miserable that he almost misses. Does miss, maybe. At least it’s something to feel. At least it’s not the peaceful fullness Jack has instilled in him, as his default state. Free of his regrets, his fears, his mistakes.
“Easy, Cas, easy,” Dean muttered, holding him up. “How much were you drinking?”
“Don’t talk to me.”
Jo, Dorothy, and Rosali were taking turns at shooting increasingly distant targets, with Rosali winning each round with ease if the score sheet Charlie had set up was anything to go by. Dean had one perfect round, but seemed to have given up competing after that since his name had been crossed out from that section of the score sheet and put under wrestling where he had managed to eliminate Jason Tran out of a mini tournament that Charlie had written the brackets for.
“I don’t think my endorsement would help, but I’ll pass the message along if you want me to,” said Cas. Dr. Newman let out a long suffering sigh and waited for Castiel to remove his pants so he could take off the bandages and check the gunshot wound. As Castiel had thought, he was fine. Dr. Newman seemed to concur, though he wasn’t entirely happy with Cas for going on an almost week long car trip after having been shot.
“Ah, yes. And no refunds or returns.”
“Do you hear birds singing?” Castiel asked instead, smiling a little when Anna rolled her eyes at him. She went back to flipping through the book and Castiel recognized it now as the one Dean had given him. “Why are you reading that?”
Unlike when he had made the trip to Ira from Sanctus, the drive back was done in one continuous run. Castiel had woken early as he’d been asked to and accompanied Jody and Gabriel to the car they were sharing on their way back to Sanctus and Superbia, respectively.
Mostly he remembered the way Cas had half smiled at him partway through the story. Like he could see through Claire just as well as Dean could, and he wanted him to know. And then Dean smiled back. Simple as that. He’d thought maybe it could be that easy, whatever it was they were doing now. Not so different from before.
Everything Dean knew about Russians had led him to believe they could hold their fucking liquor, but somehow Cas had gotten white girl wasted on two beers. Hell, Garth could drink this guy under the table.
“Oh god, I got the short end of that deal. Risa can be rough. And not in the fun way.”
MAY 6, 111 A.L. - SUPERBIA
“I know what I’m doing,” said Dean. Castiel made a disbelieving noise before he could stop himself and Dean narrowed his eyes. “Zachariah wasn’t going through with this without taking a good chunk of the people causing him trouble anyway. He just would have had to work on his PR a little. Now that sucks, but its a fact of life and not one I want these good people to have to live knowing about.”
Jessica and Cordelia looked at each other, wicked smiles crossing their faces.
*****
“Well,” he says, using his normal voice. Or at least the one he’d been using before he started pulling a Cas imitation that had set Claire’s teeth on edge. “I’m pretty sure you weren’t there two seconds ago.”
Dean doesn’t look surprised to be addressed directly. And why would he? He’s already made his mind up. He’s gonna walk into a room he thinks he’s going to die in, and he’s gonna do it with a smile on his face. And if Sam tries to stop him, the world ends. Because if someone needs to be in there with Jack, it can’t be Sam. Because Sam is the only one who’ll be able to figure out how to bind the room in time. And Dean’s just stubborn enough to refuse to learn how to do it, so he still gets one final round to be the big damn hero.
“We weren’t supposed to have sex, so I didn’t think much on the topic. And we didn’t talk about it, so I assumed that was normal,” said Cas after mentally recoiling at Jo’s implication that some people truly just expected sex from strangers, as though it were some kind of game that could be won. “It wasn’t ever even a problem until… in the last few months before she died… I saw Anna and I…”
Charlie smiled at that, and then sat up. She looked like she wanted to ask more questions, but she didn’t know how to at the moment. Cas decided to fill in anything else she might need to know.
*****
“I’m not taking a bullet for you. Just so you know.”
“That sounds ominous,” said Castiel. “I don’t know if anyone informed you of this, but I was chased away from Ira.”
“It won’t help,” Michael said. “He wasn’t supposed to drink it. I thought if Father died before he could-“
“No,” said Castiel. Dean turned back to glare at him, and Cas remembered he’d agreed he shouldn’t be speaking. “Superbia deserves autonomy.”
“You mean my old name,” he corrected. “Before the tests.”
“Yeah, okay,” said Dean, voice soft now. “Cas, you’re shaking.”
“I killed you,” she said to him seriously. “Figures you’d haunt me.”
That seemed to cause a negative reaction from everyone. Even Jo couldn’t quite look at him after that. Castiel didn’t take it back. He wasn’t going to try to convince them to trust him. They either would or they wouldn’t. Simple as that.
Charlie stopped walking.
Cas is the one who asks. The way he’s looking at Chuck is dangerous, and Dean has a feeling that out of all of them, Cas is the one most likely to actually snap and beat the shit out of Chuck. Which isn’t great, because Cas is the only one of them who has something in the way of self restraint. Evidently.
“-discarded of the housewife, quaint or broken. A new Sévres pleases, old ones crack,” Dean paused here, and Castiel wondered if he was reading his notes. The words he had scrawled beside the poem, one he had spent no small amount of time on. In retrospect, it wasn’t a surprise this was a page Dean would open up to. The spines of books have memories and they tend to open to pages that are lingered on.
“Well that certainly is something,” said Benny. Castiel stared him down coolly.
“Dean,” Mary says, and her voice sounds strained. Abruptly Dean feels something a little like shame. Jesus what happened to him? He used to be… he used to be better than this, he knows he did. “Can you show Castiel to his room?”
“Nobody said anything about replacing,” says Bobby. “Sam met some Russian kid at Oxford. Man says he can’t go home, and asked for work in the states so he could get his hands on a visa. I called him, and turns out he knows a thing or two.”
Selma accepted this answer.
Charlie snorted. Her smile fell a second later.
A long time ago, and in an incredibly unlikely turn of events, a star had fallen to Earth. He had, in case any were curious, had an unfortunate spat with one of his brothers and had been rather rudely knocked out of the sky. With no means of returning home, this star had chosen to become the king of the country he had landed on. Paradise had never before heard of kings, but they had swiftly decided arguing with the powerful man that had only just fallen from the sky would be more trouble than it was worth. And so Abel, the Northernmost star, became a ruler and used the magic of his own potential for creation to become a father.
“We’ll see,” said Naomi. She sat behind her desk and then activated a program which started the broadcast. She kept the cattle prod in clear sight to warn Jo and Castiel into silence. As soon as the program was up and running, she started speaking. Castiel knew her message would be broadcast on every television and radio in Superbia.
Suddenly Claire stopped chattering away, her attention instead focused on the wooden box in front of her. She squinted at it with a little frown, then looked at Kaia. Kaia turned her attention towards the box, and a note attached to the top stated simply “Do Not Open.” Claire and Kaia exchanged glances. They both grinned.
“It was supposed to have been tested in Lucrum,” said Castiel. “I’ve found scientists can be reticent when sharing their work, for what it’s worth.”
“Cas,” she said cautiously. “You need to breathe okay? No one’s going to hurt you. You’re safe.”
“Yeah, good for you,” Dean said with a roll of his eyes. “Keep talking Charlie.”
Cas never got the chance to finish. He was disrupted, pulled forward by his collar and left to hang an inch away from Dean’s lips. Dared to damn himself, and damn himself Cas did. For all the agonizing Cas had done over whether to act on his feelings, it was surprisingly easy to just give in once again. To let reality drift away and enjoy sensation for sensation’s sake.
Cas hasn’t felt the same since he left the Empty.
“You’d think,” Charlie muttered while stroking Crookshanks, who had migrated to her lap. Wise decision, Castiel thought to the cat. Charlie was less likely to accidentally dislodge the animal. “So I have boring computer stuff to do today. Why don’t you stretch your legs? Jo said she’d be willing to take you around.”
“Fine,” said Dean. “Sit down.”
“Sex, Cas,” said Dean. “Sometimes people scratch.”
Dean Winchester spends the evening after Chuck loses all his power scrolling through job applications, college programs, trade schools, workshop classes, volunteer opportunities… It’s overwhelming the amount of things he could try his hand at now, if he wanted to. He could do anything, be anything, live his life however he wanted. For a little while, all the things he could never want before, never let himself want, seem possible. It is almost too much to think about. As if he is watching someone else scroll through articles about how to start a late in life career change...
“Yeah, there is. Rule two is never underestimate your opponent,” said Dean with a smirk. Cas rolled his eyes. “And rule three is focus on the little things.”
“Frank, you’re going to be working with me from here on out,” said Mary. “Kevin and Sarah, you’ll be staying here in Ira. Everyone who used to work under Ash is going to be split up evenly.”
“Do you have to press so hard?”
Charlie sat up a little straighter.
There was an air of impatience to Sam that Castiel took comfort in, considering on the whole he was rather unreadable. Dean, as well as he managed to control everyone around him, wasn’t one to keep his feelings in check. Sam was a different story and besides being aware that Sam vaguely disliked him, Castiel wasn’t sure where he stood with the younger Winchester.
“Acting was outlawed by the State, Dean. I haven’t practiced.”
And with them, heaven itself rends in two.
Jo frowned thoughtfully.
“I’m still sorry. Because that had to have been hard. And I- you have to know that I care about you, Cas. But when you threw your life away for me over and over again, that didn’t feel like love. Sometimes I couldn’t tell if you even liked me or you just stuck around because you felt guilty. But I never had a best friend before, so I tried not to think about it. I just knew it was better when you were there, and I thought maybe someday you’d pick up on that and you never did. The happiest you ever were, Cas, was when you got to leave me one last time. Think about how that sits in my head, no matter what you said before that.”
“But- but if I let this go, what if that’s it? What if I’m nothing?” he says. “I was supposed to make things better. My mom died so I could make things better. If I can’t, then everything bad that happened because of me, it was just-”
“Boris?” Castiel repeated in disbelief. Jo smirked at him.
“Fuck off.”
Sam can see Eileen swallow as she considers this. By degrees, she starts to relax. A kind of jittery tension he had barely noticed flows out of her and she breathes deeply before speaking again.
FEBRUARY 17, 111 A.L. - IRA
“Yeah, okay. That all sounds good,” she said. “Alright.”
Cas says nothing.
He was changing the subject and he was sure it was painfully obvious to them. Whatever ground he had gained in trust was likely quickly being lost after this revelation that he had information he wasn’t sharing with them. But they needed to know anything they could, so they each looked at each other and then seemed to silently agree to discuss it later.
“You’re rating Benny higher than me? Really?” asked Dean, while Jo continued to ignore him.
“This is why Charlie was supposed to do this,” he said quietly to himself. “Fuck, I’m sorry.”
“And if they don’t?” Benny asked. Castiel shook his head. Benny muttered grimly to himself before he saw more people in need of help, and knelt beside Carl, one of the men that was under his command. Castiel was satisfied that Benny would take care of everyone in the immediate vicinity and went off to continue helping everyone he could.
“I’d let you,” says Dean. “Break me.”
Still, he was curious. Morbidly so.
Sam groans, as he sees Dean’s eyes light up with the opportunity to mock him for something. Oh well, he’ll let them all have their fun at his expense. He has a spot earmarked for him in tonight’s poker game and he is going to win back that cursed object Dean lost to Amara, so help him. If only because he is ninety percent sure she is plotting with Michael to use it on Chuck and the new Supernatural book coming out is already really mean (according to baffled early copy fan reviews, including noted quote “it’s almost as if Carver Edlund decided between this book and the last that he hates his own characters and wants to alienate his own fanbase?”). Sam thinks it's probably best to limit the defamation at least a little.
“I thought you wanted us to get together.”
While he waits, Sam let’s himself come to a decision. Dean’s gonna be okay. If the thanks Cas wants for that is not getting credit, then that’s the thanks he’s gonna get. Even if Sam thinks maybe both Cas and Dean would like it a little better if Cas bothered to show his face again. Not like it’s his job to explain that just because it’s complicated doesn’t mean Dean doesn’t want the guy around. Cas is still Dean’s best friend, if nothing else. Hell, he’s Sam’s best friend too, not like Cas ever seems to remember that part. Still, Sam knows Dean well enough to know that nothing could make that just go away.
“Here… never really felt like home,” says Cas, a little sad. It’s strange to hear this because, to Jack, the bunker is the only real home he’s ever known. “I was never sure if I was welcome.”
“It never does,” Castiel confirmed with as much equanimity as he could muster. He felt a hand squeeze his forearm for a second before a gun was slipped up the sleeve of his jacket. He didn’t need to turn around to know that Dean had just fulfilled the next part of their plan, and if he did it would only draw attention to what Dean was doing. That didn’t mean he didn’t appreciate the silent moment of solidarity he had been shown. It was more than enough to take comfort in.
No one bothered to tell Castiel what had happened to Kelly after he’d been locked into a different area in the basement. They’d handcuffed him to something metal and heavy and melted beyond recognition of it’s original use. They’d also been thorough in making sure they disarmed him, which meant that his best option for escape was dislocating his thumb, and he was still fairly certain that wouldn’t work.
“Maybe you should talk to your dad about this,” she suggested. Claire’s focus sharpened.
“We could stage a rebellion,” said Castiel. “I’ve been out of the loop for a while, but I don’t much like lying around and waiting for Sam to decide when I’m allowed to leave. If he ever decides I’m allowed to leave.”
“I’ve gotcha, c’mon,” said Dean soothingly. Like he might to a child. “You’re fine, Cas. Everything is fine.”
***THEN***
“You-“ Jo cut in, looking at him with a kind of amused horror. “You are the most petty person I have met in my entire life.”
“It’s kind of you to worry about me,” Castiel said with a smile. Charlie offered a smile back and let him go when he gently pulled his arm from her grasp. She went back to tallying points and Cas went to join Selma, Corbett, and Carl in throwing knives. Selma handed him one of her knives and Cas threw it in the air for a moment before launching it at the target. It landed between its eyes. Cas heard a whistle from behind him.
“I did tell you that.”
“You get one. Not really a hard rule to remember, Dean,” says Sam, still seething. He takes a deep breath to calm himself, then answers Dean’s question. “Renny Rawlings.”
“Cas?” asked Charlie behind him. Her voice was gentle and it brought him back to reality. Living in a past that he had never actually had was not going to help him. He shouldn’t have even tried. “Jo and I were going to play Go Fish to pass the time. Want in?”
“You and Sam said we need someone on the inside,” Jo pointed out. “And Charlie looked into him. He has a file about an inch thick for being…”
Castiel walked in silence for a while, knowing that Lydia was watching him think it through.
“So,” Jo said in a not entirely natural attempt to change topics. “Tonight should be fun. I hear we might even get a Winchester appearance.”
“Jesus, you’re wrists are fucked up,” he said with a low whistle. “I’ll tell Dr. Newman to take a look at that. Let me go get-“
“What’d Newman say?” Dean asked. Castiel walked closer to him and Charlie. The wood floor creaked under his feet, and he had to maneuver around a pool table in order to reach them.
“I got it,” says Dean, pushing away Mary’s comforting hand on his shoulder. He walks into the backyard and shuts the door behind him. His heart is beating so fast, he’s half certain he’s about to have a heart attack. “You’re lucky Lydia wasn’t the one who called, or I would have let Bobby tear her a new one.”
“What he said,” said Dean. “You want that attitude to spread? Seems like you have a pretty sweet deal here. Got your own personal fall man who screens newcomers, women who swore of sex suddenly free to do what they want and you’re the only fuckable dude around, and a conflict free ride through the war. You want to risk that to hold onto one guy?”
Duma led the four of them away from Metatron, and out of sight of the long line of people waiting in front of the pass. Around the corner and hidden from view was a compound consisting of a hundred or so cabins. Farther on, Cas caught sight of the edges of a freshly planted field, the dirt loose and dark, perfect for planting. He felt something awful twist inside him at the thought of the men and women he had seen, starving at the side of the road.
**********
“Yeah, but you did promise a blank check to someone you personally took out twice. Did you think for a fucking second what she might ask you to do? Because I was caught somewhere between wondering if she was gonna make you tear out your own spleen or jump off a cliff.”
*****
“Who knows if Chuck left it standing,” says Dean. And just like that, the moment of levity is gone. Dean seems to realize this, that their careful silence around everything their lives used to be is crumbling now. And it always would have had to, Sam guesses. But neither of them spent the time between then and now thinking of what the Hell they were going to say. Dean clears his throat, changes the subject. “Eileen doing alright?”
“Novak.”
“So I’m assuming you know Benny,” Selma said to Castiel casually. “And then he’s Boris.”
“No,” says Cas. “Dean, your thoughts have never exactly been completely private from me. Of course you love me. As a friend. It’s not the same thing.”
Three pairs of eyes dropped to the floor shamefully, but Mary’s stayed fixed on Castiel. She wasn’t unaffected and her eyes weren’t cold, but she did have a hollow sense of certainty ringing out from her. Righteousness personified, thought Castiel in a brief fit of poetry.
“Yeah, that’s one way of putting it,” muttered Jo. “Y’know what? I think that's enough of a downer for one night. All those for sleep say aye.”
Little steps sounded as someone came bounding past where Cas was hiding. On instinct, Cas reached out to stop her from fleeing. Emma turned and tried to bite him. Castiel instantly let go of her arm, and she turned to run again.
“Castiel made his choice,” she says. There’s no malice in her voice, no jealousy or anger. She doesn’t hate the angel or love him or particularly care about him either way, except as it pertains to the fact that Dean cares for him. There is still a thread of her that will never be able to harm Dean, that is connected to him intimately. Still she is as close a thing they have to an impartial judge in this room. “And I think we have bigger fish to fry right now. Because the souls aren’t happy. I can feel them graying at the edges. Squirming. Not the most relaxing sensation.”
“It would have been worth it.”
“That’s not true,” Castiel said out loud at last, but he had only to look at Zachariah to know that his attempt had backfired. Dean looked a mix of pleased and disappointed at Castiel’s outburst. “Dean, you’re going to start a war if you’re not careful.”
Cas closes his eyes and nods his head, just a fraction, setting Dean at ease. He’s not gonna have Claire’s blood on his hands, he’s just not. Not if Cas can’t save them both. Besides, it’s not so bad, knowing you’re dying for the people you love. He’d done it before. This was just more of the same, the way it was always gonna be. And Claire being here, maybe that would save Cas too. It was something to hope for, as he felt his skin and bones start to go the way of the incredible melting man again. Still Cas is holding him, so that’s nice in a fucked up romantic kind of way. And if Dean’s starting to go under, well he’s got a view even better looking than Kate Winslet, too, if Dean says so himself (and he does, maybe out loud, he can’t tell anymore).
But if it is going to end, he wants it to be with his family. With most of them anyway.
“Oh,” says Jack. Dean thinks that will be that, but Jack’s expression changes. “That… that makes a lot of sense.”
“I think I’ll just-“
“I keep to my agreements, as you well know,” Naomi said. “We’ve done this before, Kali. If I remember correctly, you got too fond of one of your spies. You certainly paid a hefty price for Gabriel when we caught him.”
“Like I said. Small favors,” muttered Dean. The general banter this had caused quieted down as they entered the city. Everyone tensed, focusing on what they would need to be doing and trying to be aware of their surroundings. The city seemed unchanged from the last time Castiel had seen it. A rusting destroyed city of mostly unusable buildings where the majority of the population lived in structures they had built along the streets.
He is an angel now in the way he was always meant to be an angel. An advocate for humanity. An ally from afar. No longer a creature of violence and suppression, but a guide in times of hardship. A helpful ear for earnest prayer. A place of comfort for the faithful.
“I wish she would bite my ass,” said Betty. “And Pamela, too. Damn, those two. Two perfect, beautiful women and they had to go for each other. Take pity on the rest of us, why don’t you?”
“You think?”
“So Charlie’s around then?” Jo asked Ash, since Charlie and Frank had been traveling together. Ash nodded and they kept walking down the street after Benny, Selma, and Delphine. Ash nodded, holding up one of his hands so he could start counting off who was there as he listed them off.
“It’s… me,” Cas confirms, dragging his attention away from Claire to meet Dean’s eyes for a brief moment before looking away again. Not towards Claire this time, who is safe as long as time is frozen. Just… away. It stings, even as Dean tells himself it shouldn’t.
“What if we try finding something that might have had contact with the drug? If we can…”
“I’m not,” said Jo. “Fuck you.”
“You looked out for us. Always, Castiel,” he said. “Returning the favor was more than necessary.”
“I’ve gathered.”
“I…” Jack trails off, not knowing where to go from here. He pulls at his sleeves instead, focuses in on the irritating scratch against his finger tips. Tries to distract himself.
“Don’t try to flatter me into changing the subject.”
Castiel spoke first.
But the other thing Dean had managed to say before he’d gone under is not to do anything stupid to bring him back. Not when they were finally free, out from under the weight of years of baggage and deals and favors owed to whichever powerful cosmic force they’d pissed off that week. Free of Chuck and his stupid goddamn story. So Sam is caught between the urge to do something and the dawning horror that that something is just… grieving, Sam stands there and stares and does nothing.
“I’ve got a can-do attitude, and I’m pretty sure I can do both.”
Clearing the debris around Sam’s body takes about fifteen minutes. In Eileen’s head, she wonders how long it’s gonna be before somebody to show up. Their floor is pretty empty and there’s a chance that the crash of the ceiling caving in could have been dismissed as part of the construction project a few blocks down. Still, Eileen isn’t liking her odds. She knows that if she ends up detained for any amount of time, the police are going to discover the weapons she and Sam were keeping with them in the hotel room.
“I’m nobody’s weapon,” said Cas, feeling the familiar panic inside him at the thought of being controlled or caged up. And even though he thoroughly disagreed with Tamara’s appraisal of him, he had to admit that Naomi had changed him, and likely not for the better. His nightmares continued to affect him, and it was a struggle to reign in the paranoia, even after Dr. Newman, Sam, Jess, and Cordy had figured out how to successfully ween him off the drugs she’d put him on.
Kaia looks around and winces as she catches sight of Dean’s bruised face and broken nose. Yeah, ouch.
“Agreed,” said Cas. “Anna.”
“Until next time, then,” Balthazar said. It was a little too flippant to be anything but a goodbye, and if it wasn’t for the grief under the words, Castiel might have thought Balthazar was angry with him. He left with only one look back, and a half serious salute and Castiel took to staring at the ceiling and hoping they didn’t visit again. He wasn’t sure he had the strength to make the right choice twice.
Castiel rolled his eyes at this logic. He waited for Dean to move on to some other topic, but instead the man just stood silently, still waiting for Castiel to answer.
Dean put a bottle of old whiskey in the middle of the table.
“We need to win well,” said Cas. “Remember when Zachariah attacked us in Sanctus, there were no casualties. You did that. It’s why- it’s why I started to believe in you.”
“C’mon Zach,” said Dean. How he managed to sound so casually menacing was a mystery to Castiel. “We have a barn full of your people ready to blow at my say so. If I were you, I’d keep the insulting to a minimum.”
All of this made it an unpleasant revelation when they arrived at the steps of building, and were whisked inside when they finished their long walk. Maggie noticed Castiel’s scowl and shrugged at him, likely sharing his discomfort.
“Dean,” he whisper yelled as he sprinted towards the man’s back. Dean didn’t even turn around, he was so focused on walking towards Alistair. But someone else noticed. Alistair looked up from where he was helping fight against Castiel’s garrison by lazily throwing knives at whoever strayed within range (and if Castiel were not so focused on catching up to Dean, he would be livid to see Hael and Ezekiel both had been hit, the hilts sticking out of their bodies and blood dribbling down from their wounds). The moment Alistair saw Dean, a strange calm came over him. He even smiled. Dean’s shoulders tensed up, and he reached for a weapon at his side.
“He didn’t…” Castiel started, not wanting to finish the sentence. Benny’s smile dropped as he realized the implication.
“Yes?” Gabriel said.
“Billie,” says Rowena. “To what do I owe the trouble?”
Castiel nodded and subtly pointed out the seven he could see on the street they were walking down alone. Two were stationed in front of the doors of a market, and several others were inconspicuously monitoring the rest of the street. Lydia noted them and let her eyes easily move past them so they didn’t draw notice.
“Yeah, I remember what you did,” said Benny, chuckling. “You played honest so many rounds in a row that no one really bought that you were lying when you finally bluffed. Risa looked like she wanted to take you out then and there. She must have had a great hand.”
“Actually it was Benny. He can’t keep his hands off of me,” Castiel said flatly. Dean nearly choked again, before he realized Castiel was joking.
Jo’s eyes focused completely. She uncurled herself slowly, glancing at the likely anxious Jessica and Selma who were standing behind him. She cleared her throat and then looked at Castiel.
So Sam paints on a smile and pretends not to know something is wrong. He pretends so hard, he manages not to question it when a case comes up. Manages not to question how convenient it is that they’re in the area. Manages not to question that it’s an old loose end from their long gone father, or that they’ll be saving two brothers kidnapped by monsters.
“Something like that,” she said. “I’m more you than me, now, I think. It happens. Memories fade and you invent stories to replace the people you’re grieving. Reimagine them into something you can bear to live without. Or something you can’t.”
“Something like that,” said Dean. “And, just to be clear, you didn’t tell me about Naomi’s plan to kill me because…?”
“They look different from this side,” he said. Dean didn’t bother looking up. How could the stars compare to this strange boy’s eyes? The boy looked at him and smiled.
“Metatron?” Castiel asked, and yet he knew it was wrong before she shook her head no. “The other one.”
“Wait you turned someone else down,” he said, narrowing his eyes at Castiel. His eyes now gleamed in mischievous curiosity. “Who?”
“Well, I want you alive,” said Dean, as though that settled that. And then he went back to reading the same story he had been throughout Cas’ illness, and Cas fell asleep to dreams of twelve maids hanging in a row, and him at the end with a noose closing tighter around his neck.
I’m going to make it right, he told himself again. He closed his eyes as he repeated it to himself as a mantra. He could make one thing right, and that would be enough for now.
Alternatively, the longer Cas stayed here, the more danger he was in of discovery and imprisonment. And loathe as he was to admit it, Charlie was right. He would panic. As desperate as he was now, at least he had a clear head. If he lost that advantage, he didn’t know what he would do.
Yeah that figures. Most of the shows Dean loves seem to live on rerun channels, from Saturday cartoons to old Westerns. It’s one way to develop taste. Alex, meanwhile, has been feeling out her identity through the full proof means of raiding Jody’s extensive DVD collection and holding movie nights. That or recording whatever looks interesting on cable. It’s one way to unwind after a long day of classes or volunteering down at the hospital. Also she has a lot of catching up to do after losing the majority of her childhood to being a glorified blood bag slash worm on a hook.
Michael doesn’t know he’s here.
Castiel stopped looking around and tried to tune back into Joshua’s speech, only to hear that it was mercifully ending.
“I was just reminiscing about that time Cas punched your lights out.”
Garth gently pushed Balthazar out of the way and knelt in front of Castiel. He kept his palms forward to show they were empty.
“If you are what?”
By accidental snooping didn’t seem like the appropriate answer. Especially since he had just been caught doing the exact same thing.
“I heard you the first time,” Charlie said. “I guess we got our answer of why it’s mostly women here, anyway.”
“You’ve just told me five insane things in the last ten minutes.”
Dean winced at the sound and looked down before frowning.
“Wendy and I have agreed we only speak Vonnegut to each other now,” said Dean. “And I have to pay Rufus out of my stash of decent booze every time I piss her off. I’m running out, so how about we leave Wendy alone. Besides, Antonio had a thing for Sebastian, but he just thought Antonio was a good lay. You don’t marry someone the day you meet her if you’re not trying to tell someone else to back the fuck off. And Viola loved Orsino. She was just, y’know, doing her duty wooing Olivia for him.”
“Yeah,” he said tonelessly. “She likes to remind me about that, too.”
“Oh, because you’re the expert all of a sudden?” asks Dean. “You… you didn’t trust me enough to tell me, is the thing. You thought I’d be a dick about it. You good as told me that, back at the warehouse.”
“Yeah, well you’re the only one who thinks that,” said Dean. “That’s kind of the problem.”
“Promise,” Castiel said without hesitation. “Jo, you need to leave now.”
“I understand,” Castiel said, because he did. The guilt had not lessened with his confession, nor did he expect it to. Just another misdeed to carry with him, another act in the strange grey area he had been operating within. “But I can make it right.”
“Maybe you should’ve,” he says after a second. “I- Cas, I want to say the right thing here. But it’s like you’ve tied yourself in knots making it fucking impossible for me to even- You don’t know everything, okay? You think you’ve got all this shit worked out, but you don’t.”
“What do you think?” Jo asked. Castiel knew she meant various raids that soldiers needed to defend against. They rarely ended well for resistance members. Jo’s dark expression let Castiel know that skilled as Dean’s people seemed to be, they weren’t immune to this phenomenon. “We’ve lost good people scrounging for food. We’re lucky that Dean talked us into a deal with Canada. Trust me, it hasn’t always been this easy, especially when even some of the rural areas aren’t exactly sympathetic to your cause.”
“You used their better nature against them.”
“Is that what you do?” asked Castiel. Gabriel snorted.
“What?” he demanded.
“While Dean could hear her?” Cas asked, narrowing his eyes at Betty in a way Jo would surely approve of. She’d never really gotten over Charlie’s brief involvement with Betty, despite Selma pointedly remaining good friends with Betty and making frequent demands that Jo just get over it.
“What happens when you win?” Castiel asked. “When is it going to stop?”
The good news was it wasn’t particularly fast moving, so the risk of being crushed was less than it might have been. There was a good ten inches of room already for the pulley system to operate, so even if he was crushed, it might not be fatal. Still, it tightened the pit of fear in Castiel’s stomach as his newfound claustrophobia once again took root. Then he took a few deep breaths and waited. He had already heard from his initial hiding position, the elevator going up and down several times over the course of the night. There would be an opportunity to observe from this new vantage point before committing to this plan. All he had to do was wait.
“Suffice to say there aren’t many ways I haven’t thought about… having you,” says Cas, and now he’s the one who can’t meet Dean’s eyes. “It’s a relief you didn’t notice, I suppose.”
“I wouldn’t call that a problem,” she said coolly. “But he might stab you, too, if you get him up and I think one stab wound is more than enough. In case you’ve forgotten that Dean isn’t so great with the being woken up unexpectedly thing.”
Jaw twitch. So he’s getting somewhere.
One time, a fairy hadn’t been quick enough. She had frozen into a statue of salt and washed away with the summer rains. Decades later her sisters still were looking for pieces of her so they could put her together again. How they planned to do this, the people of Lebanon didn’t know, and they didn’t ask either. If there was one thing that had well situated Lebanon in their unusual circumstances, it was that they were smart enough not to ask the right questions.
“You should get some sleep, Dean,” says Cas, not missing the way the energy has slowly been draining out of Dean over the course of their long conversation. Or the fact that Dean is likely exhausted physically and emotionally from yet another close brush with death. “It’s late.”
It was too bright when Castiel tried to open his eyes. It took a great deal of blinking before he could open his eyes, and as he started to wake, he felt bile rising in his throat. He tried to spit it out, and then felt hands on him turning him onto his side and placing a pan under his mouth. Something was tugging uncomfortably at his wrists, but he was too sick to care.
“That’s very true,” said Alistair. “But I do like seeing you in pain, Dean. And this death… it would hurt you.”
And now Bobby and Mary are looking just as alarmed as Sam is. Dean’s hurting them, he knows he is. So he shuts his mouth, and stands up and leaves. He’s halfway to the door before Cas rushes after him.
“She’ll get to keep him,” Jack said wistfully. Castiel looked at him. The loss of his mother was a deeper wound than Cas could see being acceptable in a state soldier, especially one so young. He couldn’t imagine why they would let Jack climb the ranks so quickly without reason, and yet Cas couldn’t find any. “Or her. Or them.”
“You see me as a threat.”
“Well, you must have some reason other than insulting me to justify your presence here?” says Rowena, ignoring the sting of pain the thought of her long dead son causes her. “The last I heard of you, you ended up on the wrong side of a scythe and Dean Winchester. I assume the new God-”
“That would just be an upside,” she said. Then she started the car and they were off.
“Emma,” said Castiel softly. “Please don’t.”
Dean nodded and then sneaked a glance back at Cas. He pulled something from a bag at the base of his chair and set it on the table next to Cas. It was the two books Cas owned, the book of poetry and Cat’s Cradle, stacked one on top of the other. Dean noticed Cas looking and shrugged at him self consciously.
“Dead,” Cas finishes for him. “Unreachable. A memory.”
“Yeah. She’s worried about you. I passed her a case down in Texas that Donna called in from a friend. Almost has it tied up,” says Sam. “Figured once you were healed up enough to move we’d meet up back at the bunker. Take a week off and regroup.”
“And if you don’t have anything that I want?” McCleod asked coolly.
Castiel had not commented on Charlie’s recent preference for Betty as a bed partner, nor did he have plans to. He hadn’t had time to wonder how this would be affecting Jo, who had now that he thought about it confessed to him she loved Charlie a great deal. It likely didn’t help that Castiel was aware that Jo and Charlie’s sexual relationship hadn’t entirely stopped either. And he was sympathetic certainly, but he didn’t understand what anyone involved in the situation had been expecting. It was a natural consequence of relationships, sexual or romantic, that misunderstandings would occur. It was another reason the state had always insisted its soldiers refrain from attempting such relationships.
That threw Castiel through a loop.
“Well I guess that just leaves one question,” says Billie. She prods Dean’s side with the blunt end of her scythe, causing him to groan in pain. It is all Cas can do to keep himself from snapping at her. He needs Billie for now. As long as she can heal Dean, he will hold his tongue. So he lets Billie frown down at Dean, watches as the love of his very long life looks back up at Death, defiant as ever. “Do you want to live?”
“Harriet’s going to make it,” she said. Castiel blinked in confusion at her until he remembered. He never had removed the med kit he’d taped to his back, so they must have found it whenever they’d undressed him and put him into the disposable clothes he was wearing now. “Boris would kill Crookshanks and face the full force of Charlie’s wrath if you asked. He was practically in tears yesterday when he was on his shift watching you.”
“Wasn’t it Dean’s idea in the first place?” Kali asked.
Dean grimaced.
“Kelly Kline is currently under the guard of Risa Jones and everyone under her command, along with Jo Harvelle. They fled with Kelly after almost getting into a gunfight with the people that went to retrieve her after you helped her escape,” explained Mary. “How did you turn them against us?”
Cas waited a moment for a response from Charlie. When none was forthcoming, he took a deep breath and pried the elevator doors open the rest of the way. Then he lit a match and tossed it behind him, leaping for cover as quickly as he could manage.
Dean paused a moment.
“And you wonder why I left you on guard duty,” said Dean. He sounded amused despite himself, and Betty didn’t take it for a second.
“And if I work out, I’m sure you’ll appreciate the promotion you’re likely to get,” Castiel said, not wanting to face the sincerity of her words. Jo just shrugged.
Castiel couldn’t look at her. She shifted the gun in her hands, as if looking for something to do. Her fidgeting made Cas nervous. He would prefer not to be shot to death by his own sister, if at all possible, and if only because he had a feeling this girl would not handle it well. The fact he was related to Chuck was an affront, but in this girl he could see parts of his mother. A mother, who despite her many flaws, had loved Castiel in her own way. Had been there at times.
“Winchester incoming,” he says, voice flat. “Of the Dean variety.”
“Cas,” says Dean, sharply. “Don’t.”
“It’s like you’re here, but you’re not,” says Dean. “Where are you? I never know where you are.”
Oh, Claire thinks. That’s different.
“Rowena brought him to his father.”
“Yes,” Castiel said, watching as Anna relaxed again, her strength leaving her. Her hand loosening in his. “Go to sleep. I’m right here.”
“I’m trying,” she said at last.
“One way or another,” Hannah agreed. “I’ll tell Balthazar you said hello.”
“Evacuate? Where are they supposed to go? Earth? The Empty?” she asks. “We might as well try to make Jack explode again. It’ll be faster for all of us. Humans aren’t quiet by nature. It’s why Heaven had to pacify them in the first place. Humans tend towards wanting to live, and the Empty will find a way to get out eventually. It could swallow us, just to be spiteful.”
“Still alive,” confirmed Castiel. “And I’d also like to sleep, so if you know where we’ll be staying…”
“This is death, Cas,” she said. “Take a good long look at it.”
“The state is supposed to be moral.”
Rosali looked at him significantly. Castiel shook his head.
It was a day before Castiel worked himself up to speak with Selma. He saw her briefly around others the day before, but after returning with Lydia and Jo from gathering supplies, he didn’t see her alone, and it wasn’t a conversation he wanted to have in front of others. So instead he had returned to his room, and spent the night talking with Rufus about the pros and cons of different methods of cleaning weaponry.
“I- yes, I did.”
“And now all that power has been taken away from him,” says Amara. “He’s like a vacuum, he’s going to take in whatever he can to fill the space. All that anger and pain that went unaddressed, unexpressed, where do you think he’s going to look first? Without even meaning to?”
Castiel stood at attention, not moving a muscle or even acknowledging that he was being spoken about two feet away. It was very tempting to point out that he could hear them, but he figured that insolence wouldn’t win him any favors, and Naomi would probably put him through an hour long meeting if she found out he jeopardized his chances at infiltrating what he had been led to understand was a fairly high level of resistance hierarchy (as much as they actually had).
Garth considered that. He frowned to himself for a while before shaking his head.
“Maybe.”
“There is no getting off Death’s bad side,” says Dean. “Not for me.”
“You’re right, I shouldn’t,” said Castiel. “You’re already a disappointment.”
Which was probably why he had run away so many times in the first place, but Dean didn’t like to think about that.
“I’m glad to hear you think skinning soldiers alive and piling their skulls at the city gates is slightly problematic behavior,” said Cas quietly. Charlie turned green again. “I’m glad you don’t think sparing the soldiers who happen to be women for the sake of-“
Cas stared at Dean, watching his face harden at Cas’ last words. Not angrily, just a slight twitch of the muscles to make his face unreadable, and Cas deliriously tried to reach out to touch it, and his wrist pulled tight against the handcuffs again.
“Not really.”
Jack turns away from them and to Cas, doubt clear in his expression. Dean can practically feel the energy ebbing from Castiel, doesn’t know how the guy is still standing with everything Jack is taking in, but Cas stands strong and sure and proud. And Dean thinks to himself in that moment, he’s never loved Cas more. As long as the fucker manages to actually stay standing that is, because Dean wasn’t kidding when he said Cas dying on him again would kill him.
“Fuck you, you know that? I am coming back with help, and you have to promise me that you’ll- That you won’t-“
“Guttur. Billie.”
In Charlie’s heaven it’s always Christmas. Except sometimes Christmas looks like shitty pizza and shittier jokes in an underground bunker. But only sometimes. Only when it doesn’t hurt.
Newman laughed a little at her, but at her familiar little stubborn frown straightened his expression within a second.
Dean tensed, but pulled over. Benny, who was driving the car behind him did the same. They hid the cars as best they could a short distance from the road and left a marker so they could find them again on the way back. Jason complained about having to walk, and Castiel resisted the urge to tell him that he had only just started recovering from a week of his feet, and would Jason keep his complaints to himself, thank you very much.
Dean looked disappointed but not surprised.
“Hey!”
“Nothing. Don’t let anyone tell you that you need to change, kid,” said Ellen with a throaty chuckle. “How are you doing, by the way? Bobby was yammering after you the other day when he heard you had your eggs scrambled by the state. Dean mighta mentioned it to him in passing, and you know how Bobby is. Never could turn away a stray.”
“I’m not in the mood,” Dean muttered.
“Frank thinks that state leaders eat human spleens for fun. They’re awful, but they aren’t cannibals. Well, maybe in Lucrum,” said Jo, shuddering in disgust for a moment. Castiel looked at her curiously and she mouthed that she would tell him later before speaking out loud to Ash again. “Besides, Doc’s checked him out. He’d have mentioned if there was anything fucked up going on.”
“Cas?” yawned Charlie from her room. She had the door closed behind her, which meant likely she’d had company the previous night. Castiel didn’t pay much attention to it and Charlie had fortunately not broached the subject. He didn’t see it as any of his business. “You’re up early.”
“That was the gist of my argument,” said Cas. Jack, who had been walking silently next to them made a thoughtful sound, something between a hum and a grunt. Castiel looked at him questioningly. Jack frowned a little, as though he were deciding something.
“You can’t expect me to take those,” Castiel said immediately. Death he could handle. Waking up and finding himself imprisoned, or restrained again was not something he would take well. The only thing that had prevented him from panicking the first time it had happened under Naomi’s orders was the fact he thought he would be dead soon. Having to live a life under lock and key filled him with dread. “I won’t do it.”
Risa kept everyone calm and forbid anybody engage with anyone hostile. The goal was to get back to Dean, Mary, and the rest of the resistance. Risa stressed her buddy system again, and Trisha let out a loud sigh before striding up next to Cas.
“So, Cassie,” Balthazar said, after wrapping up his complaints that the rations here were nowhere near as good as the food Ellen and some of Gabriel’s men had been cooking for them while they’d been in the city. Nor were they as good as soldier’s rations. Although Castiel agreed, he thought it in poor taste to complain about being fed. “I wanted to ask you-“
“You good to drive?”
*****
“I hate everything.”
“Dean-”
“Listen, Dean,” says Victor. “I know you’re still angry, but we need to know where-“
“Thank you,” said Selma. “I’m glad you’re back.”
“Your cat’s name makes more sense now,” Castiel offered to break the weighty silence. Charlie grinned and nodded.
It wasn’t the dream in the garden this time. Recently it hadn’t been. It had been the dreams of what had actually happened, with his garrison standing in the basement of a resistance testing facility in which they had been genetically engineering humans to act as weapons. Anna’s garrison had been sent in to rescue the children until it was discovered that they were too dangerous and unstable to be reeducated by the state and the order had come through for them to remove the threat.
“So what if I was?” Dean says, startling Sam’s attention back to him. “Messing around with Cas?”
“I wasn’t finished,” he said. “This state of affairs drove Anna to near madness and she decided to take the matter of discipline into her own hands. She requested time from the state to put us all in our place and they gave her a week. She proceeded to put us through our paces. Mercilessly. I am certain no one had more than two hours of sleep each night for the first four days. And anyone who didn’t meet her expectations was subject to repeating whatever punishment she had thought up for us until they satisfied her or collapsed from exhaustion.”
“Dean’s gonna have our backs,” said Jo. “And my mom is out there. If I don’t get out of this alive, she’s going to kill me.”
“I’m sorry my being brainwashed was so inconvenient for all of you,” said Castiel. He flinched internally at how he knew he sounded. Ungrateful and petty and unwilling to understand.
“One of the seven cities is no longer under state control,” Castiel confirmed.
So when he does bring it up, it’s only after Dean pokes fun at him for seeming a little down. It feels like permission to break through the bubble they had been living in for the past week. To acknowledge the losses as well as the wins.
“I’m getting a little sick of dying, Cas,” said Anna, sounding more put out than in pain this time. “Can’t you let yourself have one nice moment? One harmless dream? I swear, your guilt will be the death of us all.”
Then again, Dean was obviously better at figuring out sore subjects than Castiel was. 1-0 to Dean Winchester.
It takes a moment for these words to register on everyone in the room. When they do, a lot of people start talking at once. Castiel immediately demands to know if Jack is alright, while Claire and Patience mutter between themselves about who the fuck God is then, and even Eileen signs a question at Sam about whether this is related to the whole world ending thing that Patience told Dean about. Dean doesn’t say anything though, just looks more and more certain of something.
But the boy hadn’t left it there. Until the end of their stay in confinement Jack continued to ask more and more about the resistance. He wanted so badly to be on the right side of the fight, and Castiel found Jack’s search for reassurance exhausting.
“He acts like a good man, but he is far from that,” said Alistair. “I gave him a choice between dying and living and he chose living. He knew what price I’d ask from him and he said yes.”
The two of them discussed what they knew about Ira from their experiences until Charlie showed up to interrupt them and announce it was time to drink their worries away. As expected, they did right downstairs in Harvelle’s.
“Guess who.”
“Thought you were weaning yourself off the caffeine again,” says Claire, frowning slightly in disapproval.
“They usually turn around by now,” Selma muttered, referring to the approaching trucks. Castiel supposed they were getting closer than the other scouts had. “We need to go warn everyone.”
They took their time eating him alive. They started with his stomach, and worked their way out, leaving only his throat in tact so his screams never stopped.
“I do want you to sound rehearsed. Like you put some thought into it. Cassie, this is a manifesto of sorts in which you’re asking a city to change literally everything they think they know about themselves and a lot of trained soldiers to stop shooting things. This is an uphill battle at a ninety degree incline.”
“Do you need something?” asked the guard, indicating by tone alone that Castiel’s answer should be no. Cas shook his head and tried to walk past him. He found his path blocked. “If you need something, I’ll get it.”
“I don’t see the same man staring back at me,” said Hannah. Her sadness spoke volumes. “You look like death warmed over. If that’s what leaving did to you, what is it going to do to all of us?”
“I would know,” says Cas. “It’s not as if- This body, it’s not the problem. And I know because Crowley, of all people, made sure to tell me that in excruciating detail. On more than one occasion, for the record.”
“It was selfish of me really,” Selma said, standing up and offering a hand to help Castiel up from his chair too. “I thought it would be nice to have someone around that doesn’t make fun of me for praying five times a day. I know they don’t mean to say my faith is a waste of time, but…”
To say Sam is surprised to see Amara walking gracefully beside Patience down into the dungeon is something of an understatement. That’s nothing compared to Chuck, who freezes when he catches sight of his sister. For a moment, the smallest bit of regret seems to cross his features. Then it fades, overtaken by anger and fear.
“I know you didn’t,” says Dean. “Cas, I’m not gonna make you pick. Jack’s getting out of this alive, just like you said. Me, well, we’ll see about that.”
It never had been, no. Or at least Castiel thinks so in the privacy of his mind. As private as that really is, where God is concerned. He can’t help but notice that Ash is still staring at him, as if waiting for a decision. It’s all Castiel can do not to snap at him again. Because he feels… he feels…
“I’m not the one who’s uncomfortable,” Castiel said quietly, nodding his head back slightly to indicate everyone who was closely watching the exchange. “I don’t think they much appreciate being in the presence of someone who deserted their post.”
FEBRUARY 5, 111 A.L. - SUPERBIA
“We know,” said the one on the right. Her sister elbowed her and glanced at Selma before painting a friendly smile on her face.
“Yeah,” Charlie says with a sigh. “You and every other hunter this side of Apocalypse number three. I mean, everyone keeps telling me how cool she is and like… I made out with Dorothy. Like Dorothy from Oz. She rides a motorcycle. How’s that for cool.”
A long way away, a fallen star got to his feet.
He spent most of his days lost in hallucinations. Chuck called them visions, and listened with rapt attention to the way Castiel described them. The ways the shadows on the walls watched him, circled him, frightened him. Alistair as a manifestation of hell, as his tormenter, as his jailer. The ways in which Alistair and Dean sometimes seemed to morph together in his mind. If Castiel had had his head on straight, he might have recognized this as the manifestation of a deeper fear than the fear of physical pain. The longer he was kept under the influence of Sweet Dreams, the more tenuous his hold on reality got, and the happier Chuck seemed.
Gabriel continued to choke, his hands scrabbling at his neck as white foam fell from his mouth. He looked Gadreel in the eye as life left him and the message was clear as day. Gadreel let his brother fall and then turned to look at Michael.
*****
“Al-Alright,” Charlie stuttered, looking at him as though he’d just announced he intended to skin her cat in front of her. She really did look horrified, to Castiel’s surprise, and Jo was frowning at him as well.
He set each device carefully, knowing who was on duty and which tents were empty, as well as which tents had children inside. He was sure to avoid the ones with children, while targeting ones he knew to be empty. Once each device had been set, he took out the remote Meg had given him. He had already tested one of the devices several days ago to ensure they did as Meg said and weren’t explosive and didn’t operate in a way he was unaware of.
Dean had looked at him for a long time afterwards. Then he had shrugged.
“Something you know from personal experience?”
Castiel had yet to speak up at all, though Charlie and Ash was frequently asked for opinions and were sat next to him, which meant he couldn’t really do anything unnoticed, like send Naomi notes about the meeting or ask her opinion on whether to encourage unrest in Ira or prevent it depending on what would ultimately be beneficial for the state, since the current division clearly wasn’t going to allow for a stable country.
The moment he got in the car with Kali, someone that had been lurking in the backseat wound a hand over his mouth with a strong smelling cloth pressed under his nose. Cas’ attempts to flail out were stymied by a sudden tiredness that rapidly stole his strength. He slumped down, trying to slur out a request for help from Kali before he passed out entirely.
“Making sure McCleod doesn’t get smothered in his sleep,” said Charlie. “The high ranking officials don’t like us here. And they don’t have much loyalty to the McCleods either. Just look how easy it was to get them to turn against Rowena.”
“I doubt that,” said Cas. “They know Zachariah’s tricks and they aren’t afraid to kill. Invidia is going to fall, and then they will march on to Superbia and the same will happen here. But we can stop it.”
Her eyes slip to Cas, who frowns. He opens his mouth as if to question this, but before he can, Dean’s answering her.
“Yes.”
“That’s super specific. God, do you get off on being cryptic?” asked Trisha. “Whatever. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t dead. Risa would be pissed if her buddy system didn’t work.”
“She’s mostly teasing,” said Ellen when she was gone. “Mind you I only mean mostly.”
“I was more concerned with getting you out of that room alive-”
It was longing, low and fierce, and it grew on him in the small hours of the morning, the hours he’d grown accustomed to not sleeping. The hours they had carved out for themselves. He didn’t miss the sex, rather he missed the intimacy of it. The way Dean had looked at him. The things Dean had told him.
“Out of curiosity, Castiel,” she began. “How much history do they teach soldiers?”
“You heard that, huh,” Dean said, voice revealing nothing. “I thought you were trying to quit eavesdropping. For someone who keeps saying he’s not a spy, you sure act like one sometimes.”
“Then what do you need me for?” Castiel asked them. Sam nodded to Charlie and she continued.
Castiel cut himself off with a shout as a sharp pain sliced its way up his arm and through his nervous system. Alistair let go off the viselike grip on his hand and Castiel looked down in horror to discover he now only had four fingers on his left hand. Alastair had removed his ring finger, and Castiel detachedly though that perhaps Naomi had a sense of humor after all, considering she was under the impression he and Dean were genuinely engaged. It was a pointed message.
“Hot.”
“Dean chose you,” says Cas. Which Dean actually didn’t want Kevin to know, thank you very much. It’s a lot of pressure to put on somebody, actually. That you brought them back to life. He doesn’t want Kevin to feel like he has to be grateful about it. He deserved to live and Dean had the means to do it. Not such a hard decision after all.
Claire silently stands up from where she’s been eavesdropping. She feels numb. She feels dangerous. She feels the way she used to feel when Randy told her he didn’t have the money to feed her that month and she needed to stay at whatever fucking foster family she’d been dumped off at. She feels the way she felt when she saw the rift close between her and Kaia’s dying body. She feels the way she felt when she looked down at her father, someone else’s voice speaking the last words he would ever hear from her.
“So whose side are you on, soldier?” she asked. “Because I’m honestly not sure anymore.”
“No,” says Amara, only she sounds more like Jack now. “But I am.”
“Risa-“
“How old are you, twenty two?” he asks. “Sounds a little early to be thinking about marriage.”
As many mornings before this one (and as it would be for many mornings after) he wakes up from a dream of flying. And not for the first time, he has woken mid-flight, wings he no longer possesses stretched taut against the strain. The phantom pain of those missing limbs is, simply put, excruciating. He cannot relax, cannot convince his mind that this pain is imagined. Unable to stop himself, he gasps in short spurts, unable to fill his lungs through the panic.
“I’m alive. You don’t need to check on me.”
“What are the conditions?”
“How did we know what to do after you guys had us all gassed?” Dean pointed out. “Cas here was a big help with that one. He told us all about Sweet Dreams.”
“Why don’t you just…?” Claire asks, gesturing towards Dean and trailing off. Cas seems to take her meaning.
“Why?”
“I’m done playing,” Castiel said. He gave everything he won to Jess to quickly divvy up, then gratefully took a small cloth bag Selma offered him to place the pills in. As he exited the table, Benny stood up to take his place, pulling out his own stash of what passed for currency. Castiel sat between Selma and Dean to watch the game for a while. Jess left after a few minutes with Cordelia who had decided she was fed up with playing. Jess made a gesture offering to share, and Cordelia scowled at her as they walked off together.
Cas rolled his eyes and then made to get back behind the wheel of his car. Charlie stopped him and shook her head.
“No, I mean you’re gonna kiss me like that and then just walk off? The fuck is your problem?” Dean said, but he didn’t sound angry. Cas was still trying to puzzle out exactly what Dean was feeling when a hard tug on his wrist pulled him forward again and Dean pressed a hand to the back of his neck and kissed him back.
“You could actually try talking to him about all of this.”
“I’m tired, Cas.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean can see Jack getting closer. He looks down at Dean with no expression at all on his face. Then he sits next to him and reaches out one hand. Dean takes it, thinking nothing of it until Jack’s hand starts to glow in his. There’s a little spark of energy, but it quickly fades to nothing, exhausted. Jack’s face falls.
“Okay I will,” says Sam. He turns to look at Mary. “Happy?”
“What else was I supposed to do?” she asks him. “You said you had a bad feeling about Chuck still being in control of our lives. And then you died. I thought it could be a lead. And now you’re back-”
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been… I have a bad habit of eavesdropping that I need to break.”
Castiel stopped in his tracks.
“You do know I have never had and never will have romantic feelings for Jo,” he said to her. Charlie mustered up a smile.
“Home, maybe,” she said. The dark haired soldier gave her a look and the girl went quiet. They marched on, their shoes growing hot on the tarmac as they got closer and closer to the pass.
“I don’t remember you being… so forgiving,” says Mary then. Billie looks at her and the searching glance raises goosebumps on her arm. There is nowhere to go to avoid Death’s attention, so she does nothing.
Michael reaches for the bread bowl and starts picking apart a roll, eating a bite every once in a while. Or Adam does. Amara isn’t sure.
“Alicia, Max,” the young woman said, hurrying towards them with an expression of sheer relief. “Where’s Krissy? She didn’t get herself sent to max lock up trying to escape again, did she?”
“Is discreet the word you’re looking for?” Balthazar asked when Castiel failed to finish his sentence. Castiel took the out. “When we were stationed in Ira. She spent her nights off at that terrible bar where we couldn’t get good service to save our lives.”
“Are we still talking about the same thing?” Castiel asked, seeing a slightly distant look in Charlie’s eye. She shrugged then stood up from her chair and walked around Dean, Eileen, Joshua, and Mary with Castiel tailing behind her.
“You mean besides Heaven tearing itself in two?” asks Dean. His voice sounds off, and Sam doesn’t blame him. If the other foot was gonna drop, it would be now. Charlie shrugs. “Seriously? There’s more?”
“This isn’t what I was expecting,” said Cas watching the evening bustle. Selma and Charlie looked around and then at him, looking fairly amused. Selma said something about going to get Dean and then left while Castiel was still taking in the town. “They can’t move can they? If Zachariah makes a move, I mean. This is home for them.”
Cas jolted up and went to the door. He paused a moment there, wondering ridiculously if he should say something of a goodbye to the people he’d worked with a week. He even managed to turn around and open his mouth before deciding against it and leaving. No one called any kind of encouragement or goodbye after him, so he supposed he had done the right thing. He would still see them obviously, he just wouldn’t be under the same command as them.
Dean let out a long slow breath, obviously convincing himself to stay calm.
“Your heart stopped.”
John Winchester liked whiskey on the rocks.
That made her pause. She put her knife away and crossed her arms while looking him up and down. Whatever she saw seemed to make up her mind. When Kali shoved down two drinks on their table, Jo handed over her money without another word and then drained her glass quickly. Castiel hesitantly copied her.
“You don’t need one now.”
Plus he has his own problems. Problem number one being the look Eileen is giving him right now.
“And this is where I leave you,” Dean said, edging away from the cat like it might explode if he wasn’t careful. “Get some sleep, okay?”
You have no idea, Sam thinks to himself. But he just swallows and nods.
And then the rest of it all comes back to her too.
It was difficult enough to hear about the fighting in Invidia, which had lasted longer than they had been hoping. Castiel kept to himself that it was obvious the reason why. The people of Invidia didn’t want the state to fall, and they were going to fight for its preservation until it was pried from their hands, perhaps even cold and dead ones. If the casualties were anything to go by, apparently the resistance didn’t think that was a problem.
“You going to elaborate on that?” he asked.
“Cut the shit, Aaron,” said Risa. “I need to make a report, and I should be up there anyway.”
“Who wants less ass?”
“Keep quiet,” Jack said through gritted teeth. Castiel realized at that moment that Jack was in on whatever scheme Gadreel and Gabriel and this Inias person had dreamed up. He didn’t like it one bit. “Which I was doing.”
“Seriously? Not even, like, a rock?”
“You’re about ten years too late for that, Castiel,” she says. There’s an edge to her voice. She doesn’t try to soften it. “Stop treating me like I’m a kid, like I don’t understand what the fuck is happening. You can’t manage me, okay?”
“Not forever, just…” Sam hesitates, seeing Dean’s frown deepen. “Long enough.”
“Me?” Castiel asked, frowning to himself. That didn’t make any sense.
“I believe,” he said, lost between the sleeping word and the waking one. Dean stared down at him, hard black eyes softening slowly. And yet it wasn’t Dean at all on second glance. It was Duma, the woman who did not like him. She watched as Cas babbled on, hardly in control of his mouth. “I believe. I believe.”
As Dean continued tiptoeing towards the kitchen, he reflected on the fact that he had never really bonded with new Charlie the way he had with his Charlie. He supposed that was for the better now. What was the point of getting attached to anyone or anything when God himself was sock puppeting everything attached to your life story?
“You look like you could use a hug,” said Garth, but before he could stand up, Castiel had taken a step back.
“Everyone thinks they’re fucking hilarious, huh? Heard an angel had a thing for Dean Winchester and just couldn’t resist putting on the get up to fuck with me one last time,” says Dean. The reaper flinches, and Dean can’t help but laugh. “I look like I’m resisting? Take me, I don’t even care where I go. Hell, make up some new place just for me. I’m tired, I-”
It would be Jack who ripped open everything Dean is trying his damnedest not to think about. It would be Jack who, without even trying, finds the words that hurt the worst. That make Dean realize he can’t just not think about this and hope he dies before it all catches up to him.
Someone cleared their throat behind him, and Dean knew he’d been caught.
“Depends on what exactly it is you think I want.”
Selma responded by stuttering incoherently and then tossing one of the unwashed pieces of clothing at Jo’s head. She dodged it with a smile and went on talking.
Cas sits on a barstool in the Roadhouse, invisible again. He doesn’t understand why this has become a place to congregate among his long dead friends. Of course, he could ask them, but that would involve showing his face and he’s not sure if he’s welcome. Many of them don’t even like each other. And yet day after day they show their faces and talk and act as if they were still alive. It feels like a performance, and Castiel is starting to wonder what happens when everyone stops acting.
Castiel returns sight to the man who began the end of days. And then he burns a calling card on Dean’s arm. Or perhaps not even that. A point of pride, ambition even. He doesn’t know this little rebellion, this moment of weakness is a step on a road Cas had had no intention of ever following.
Perhaps he had been too old to be effectively integrated into society, Castiel mused. Or too stubborn. Either way, it still seemed odd to Castiel that the two brothers had differed so sharply on their impressions of the state considering the level of faith they seemed to have in each other. Perhaps it was something that had transcended politics, or perhaps Dean had forgiven anything he might have held against his younger brother for believing in the state.
But John is still the reason their kids exist. The reason they grew into the men they did, when she was dead and gone because she’d loved John too much to think of the consequences of bringing him back to life. She’d just… acted. So if there is a part of her that does not like her husband, that judges him, that longs to erase the cold, hard man he turned into, she doesn’t have the right to feel that way. She traded that away a long fucking time ago.
“I wanna see Dean’s face when he-“
“Gordon tried to kill his own sister,” said Castiel. “And he hates Sam and Jess. And me.”
“I’ll take it. Besides, you already get what’s good about stories like this.”
“Closer to Claire,” he clarifies next. “A place to live.”
She paused on the last name, raising an eyebrow slightly. Selma’s mouth twitched in mutual appreciation, and Castiel resisted the urge to ask Selma who she was.
Castiel didn’t really know what to say to that.
“Maybe to you,” said Benny. “But did you ever think about what the state asked you to do before your friend died? If she was still alive, you would shoot any of us sitting here on sight and don’t say you wouldn’t.”
“Night Dean,” says Jody. And then with a funny smile, one that makes the tips of Cas’ ears turn red (very much against his will), she adds: “Cas.”
“Dean?” he tried quietly. “Dean, wake up.”
Cas stared at Dean, uncomfortably horrified at the question. He knew the answer, of course he did, but Dean had no right to ask.
“Seeing something you recognize and empathizing with it,” said Charlie. She stretched after she said it and then her stomach growled. “Hey dude, do you want to eat something? I’m starving.”
JANUARY 24, 111 A.L. - IRA
“I know,” says Jack. He tries to reassure her. “It’s a good crib.”
“Gordon?” Castiel tried. Gordon and Dean had had sex before, that was widely known. It made sense.
“Are you two seriously fucking fighting right now?”
“Why does everyone think I was in love Anna?” Castiel asked instead of answering the question. “She was my friend. Isn’t that enough?”
“The next part of- You’ll see,” Patience says, clamming up. She’s waiting for the knock on the bunker door. She needs to be the one to answer it, let the woman in. This, at least, is very clear in her head. She holds onto this for a few seconds, pleased with the certainty of it. Unlike the next few occurrences which are hopelessly changeable and shift every few minutes.
Cas sighs, squares his shoulders, and turns to face Dean. His expression is carefully neutral, empty, as if he’d been carved of marble. But the air around him seems to buzz, as if whatever’s going on in his head is just too big to be contained properly. And good. At least he feels something about all of this.
“He did what?” Castiel said, perhaps a little too loudly. Everyone went back to staring at him. “I didn’t mean to shout. I apologize if I frightened you…”
“Alright, I’m Daniel. Stay there,” he said. Daniel took out a radio and spoke in code that he couldn’t know Castiel would understand every word of. He was reporting that suspicious behavior and Castiel’s name, checking that Castiel was indeed someone who should be seeing Naomi. After about ten minutes, he had his confirmation and orders to take Castiel to the hospital.
“Never!” said Emma. She must have rethought this however, because her next question was. “Can I read the bedtime story to you instead?”
“Slept,” Jo finished for him. “Probably a good thing with the knife wound and everything. Glad to hear Winchester’s still a gentleman.”
“Shouldn’t you be taking legal action.”
“You can bring one soldier. Everyone else is my guys.”
By the time they’ve sorted out a decent amount of food, Dean and Cas are practically vibrating, they’re both so anxious to get out of there. They won’t tell Claire what they’re anxious about though, just exchange looks and then say something about Sam and a case that is vague and also unspecific. As in they could literally be talking about anything from Sam slipped on a banana peel and can’t remember the color blue to mind eating ear worms are the newest big bad. Not that Patience has given Claire any specifics either.
“I can’t believe I carried you all the way out of the hotel and I just had to wait a few hours,” says Eileen. “You’re really heavy.”
He leaned forward to say it, partly Castiel thought to impress the gravity with which he meant it and partly because it encouraged a feeling of familiarity. Either way, it was effective. Castiel’s eyes slipped to Charlie without his permission and he knew that Dean caught the movement even if he didn’t comment on it.
Letting go of Claire, Cas presses his hands into Dean’s sides, but nothing happens. Not even the electric pulse of Cas trying and failing to heal him he’d felt before. Just nothing. He looks up at Cas, a little startled. Realizes what this might mean. Cas doesn’t seem to know, just keeps pressing his hands desperately into Dean, head bowed over him and eyes starting to water.
“The way I hear it,” Gadreel said. “You knew nothing, and you still didn’t shoot her when you were supposed to.”
“I’m sorry,” Jack says again, and there is something like anguish in his voice. And ready as Dean thought he was to die again, nothing prepares him for the pain that comes when Jack implodes.
“I repeat,” says Michael slowly. “My condolences.”
It took Dean a second to process what this meant. And then his face fell.
Cas nodded, and she helped him sit on the bed, and then sat next to him, reminding him to breathe and that he was safe. It was about ten minutes before he could feel his heart rate starting to slow and bit by bit he came back to his senses.
He took a deep breath, only to turn around and see Trisha right behind him. She was lucky he only jumped and didn’t take a swing at her.
“Cas, don’t-” Dean spits out, blood running down the side of his mouth as he chokes on his own blood. Cas doesn’t acknowledge his protest, just keeps his eyes on Billie.
“You said it was mine.”
“If you’re certain he’s not a threat,” he says, pointedly not looking at Chuck as he says it. “I’m going to check in on the girls. Make sure- Well, that Claire is-”
Castiel looked away.
“You can think so,” Castiel accidentally said out loud. Dean let him go and sat back, looking at him sternly.
“How did you stop?” Dean asks. “How did you start getting it right?”
Dean’s expression softened slowly. He swallowed and nodded, and pulled Cas back in, his movements taking on a more instructional quality. He would pause every so often and let Cas try something for himself. It was a slow and careful process, and Cas felt himself grow more confident as time went on. It was strange to see Dean like this, and Cas struggled to think of a time Dean had ever looked so relaxed and happy. It was almost childlike, Dean’s wonder at the fact someone was touching him.
To say they were slightly surprised when Castiel burst in and started angrily lecturing them would be an understatement.
“I know,” Rowena says. “I’m sorry, Sam.”
“That… that about sums it up,” Sam confirmed. “Trish still hasn’t forgiven me.”
Castiel could only stare at him and wonder how in the world Dean had known he was actively working against him this entire time and let him continue.
“She’s smarter than I am,” Castiel said, hesitating a moment before continuing. “She was waiting for me to stare her down. Attempt to puzzle her out. If I didn’t try that, it meant that I didn’t need to.”
For once, Jack doesn’t back down when Cas yells at him. Instead he keeps staring straight at Cas like he’s disappointed with what he sees. It hurts more than Cas was expecting. Perhaps he’d grown more used to having someone look at him like he was a hero than he should have.
“You did,” Castiel corrected without thinking. “Well not you, but your side.”
“And I promised your mother I wouldn’t use you,” Cas muttered to himself, mostly. “I shouldn’t have told you about this.”
They’ll just get them the slow way.
Anna faded into dust and blew away in a nonexistent wind. The blackness swallowed her once more, and Castiel was left only with a profound sense of emptiness. In his dreams he waited, bearing the impressive weight of his nightmare in silence until he could bear it no longer.
“Don’t you think they’re better apart?” Castiel asked, after waiting for Selma to go on. It was strange the way she was reacting to the news. “They were never particularly happy together. If anything, they seemed to make each other miserable.”
Cas is left in the grayness, and in his hands is a note with every four letter word Dean is too afraid to say.
Aaron led them all to the five rooms that had been put aside for their return. Castiel tried to shuffle in with Trisha, Maggie, and Corbett into one of the rooms only to be stopped at the last second.
“She’s a good one,” Ellen confirmed with a hint of a smile. Deep pride simmered under the surface of what she was saying, and Castiel wondered a moment whether his parents had felt that strongly about him. If they’d loved him as much as Ellen loved Jo. “Make sure she takes care of herself, will you?”
“You’re fucking kidding me right?”
They had cut the conversation off here, when Claire and Charlie had returned. This had been the day before Balthazar had been walked back into the cell. He looked better, much to Cas’ relief. He still moved as though it pained him to do so, but it was clear much of the damage had been fixed. He wondered at that. Whoever these people were, the ones who had dealt with the soldiers of Libidine with such cruelty were treating their prisoners with a certain amount of dignity. It seemed strange to him, the about face in strategy.
“I’m sure the two of you have figured out how this works,” she said. Neither of them answered. Any word out of place meant punishment for the other person. “Good. Now, I am going to be broadcasting to the city. I know some of the soldiers are expecting Castiel’s grand speech, but I’m afraid I’ll have to use the time to deliver an ultimatum.”
“What did she do to get shot?” the man asked, after pausing to consider this for a moment.
“Ow,” he said with feeling. Pain was a new sensation for him. He was quite certain he didn’t like it, but was also quite unsure what exactly to do about it. So he climbed out of the crater falling had caused, determined to examine his surroundings.
Anna’s expression flattened into violent distaste, and she lifted her radio to her lips.
“I’m leaving,” he said, backing away when Jo tried to take a few steps towards him. He shook his head at her and fixed his eyes back on Dean. “But don’t worry. I’m sure the target you’ve just made me will ensure I don’t make it very far.”
“It doesn’t sound like nothing.”
She bit her lip nervously before going on.
“Haha, someone’s a comedian.”
“Cas,” Anna said. “You don’t want to do this. You know you don’t want to do this. You have to fight back.”
Castiel shook his head.
“Don’t bite me this time,” he said, and before Castiel could complain that that had been an accident and he was sorry, goddamnit, Dean had pressed his lips against Cas’. He held his hands on either side of Castiel’s face, and every part of him seemed to relax when Cas kissed back and started pushing his hands up under Dean’s shirt. When Dean slipped his tongue past Cas’ lips the same way he had last time, Cas could look past the strangeness of the idea to realize that it also felt good. It seemed like the kiss had barely started when Dean was taking a step back and putting a hand in front of Cas’ chest when he tried to follow forward.
Jody glanced at Castiel and didn’t finish her sentence. But despite her polite greeting before, it was more than evident she didn’t trust him much.
Billie was not with them at the moment either, which also seemed to be making the Winchesters and Charlie jumpy. If what Naomi had said to Castiel was true, he suspected it was because they were uncertain of her loyalties. Castiel was grateful for her absence monopolizing their suspicion so he wasn’t under the same kind of scrutiny he might have been otherwise. In fact, he was almost being ignored at the moment. Perhaps they all figured there simply wasn’t much harm he could do miles from Superbia and with the only reliable form of communication available unusable (unless your name was Charlie Bradbury).
“I understand. It makes sense,” Cas said. Mary almost looked sorry for a moment. “And Sam advised you tell me this. Naturally. He wants to test me, because if I run away it’s safe to kill me without hurting Dean’s feelings. It’s touching, how much he cares about his brother.”
“You don’t look so good,” Claire says, sitting next to her. She sounds offhand about it, but Patience can tell she’s worried.
“Well, we figured since you knew the big guy,” says Tasha. “You might… call him?”
“Yeah, that’s not happening,” Dean said, shaking his hand. “If we get caught, the people at the top are most likely to be executed. Jo’s mom would skin me if there was any chance of that happening. Actually, Bobby and Jody would probably skin me too.”
*****
“What Claire is trying to say,” Kaia breaks in, clearly equally unimpressed with Claire. “Is that it feels like something weird is going on. And last time that happened, I ended up trapped in an alternate universe for like two years. So we’d rather be in the know, than out of it. For example, what is all this warding even for?”
Claire didn’t finish her sentence. It wasn’t like she didn’t know her parents didn’t exactly behave the way other couples did. They operated as a team, sure, but they never kissed each other, or celebrated their anniversary, and they had had separate rooms as long as Claire could remember. Her dad had always said that was because his back hurt, but she’d never really believed him.
“I can help with that,” Azazel decided at last. “New terms. I’ll give you your ceasefire, Winchester, if you personally put this poor excuse for a soldier out of his misery. Someone give Winchester a knife.”
“We’re not related,” Jess said in a loud whisper to Cas and Selma.
“I am. Happy about it,” said Castiel seriously. “I mean it.”
“That’ll work,” she said with a grin.
“I should,” said Cas. “I would do terrible things for your happiness. You seem to think there is another choice on the table, for me. There isn’t. If there was, I would be long gone already.”
Elsewhere, Dean had found Jo inspecting bone blades. They came from the Grey Lands, and the man who sold them had sharp teeth and collected the same payment as Missouri. Jo frowned in concern at a particularly beautiful bone knife that cost a gallon of human blood.
“I hate both of you,” mumbled Selma from her sleeping bag.
“You aren’t going to-“
“Yes,” he breathes, the kind of breath that sounds like it could be his last. His eyes go unfocused with the word, his soul not quite attached.
“Oh yes,” she said. “I very much enjoy watching the rest of you make poor life decisions while intoxicated. It helps me to shore up my self esteem. Whenever I feel as though I have gone wrong in life, I can at least remember that I never proclaimed myself king of the forest and attempted to bite a tree.”
Everyone at the table knew he raised when he had a winning hand. That wouldn’t be enough to get all of them to fold, but he had a feeling Kevin and Sarah would. When he raised, they folded as he expected, and surprisingly Cordy folded as well. Jason ended up following suit, but Risa wasted no time in raising her own bet. Frank and Harriet matched her, and Castiel raised again. Risa matched him and Frank folded, though Cas had a feeling that was because he’d managed to get a glimpse at Risa’s cards while she was busy staring Cas and Harriet down.
Dean turns to see Cas and Jack standing behind him in the doorway.
Charlie wasn’t speaking to him, for no reason Cas could discern. Jack was speaking to him, and speaking to him, and still speaking to him, and Cas didn’t have the heart to tell the poor kid that he wasn’t the one Jack should be looking up to. That’s what the Mary and Dean Winchesters of the world were for, and damn it, Jack would be a lot safer for it if he looked for a better role model. Garth was less loquacious than Jack, but he still had the unfortunate habit of being Cas’ therapist and making him think of his various traumas and having to actually deal with them instead of allowing him to pretend they hadn’t happened and hope he died before that came back to bite him.
Lydia argued her way past several sets of guards ahead of Cas, and Cas told each of the guards that he had been sent to retrieve Lydia in order to get past them. He followed her up to the twelfth floor, always far enough behind that she wouldn’t catch him.
“I lost my phone, haven’t checked my messages,” says Dean, ignoring the second part of what Sam just said. Which is great, so much for leaving Dean at Jody’s so he wouldn’t get in trouble. Sam is so angry, he almost forgets why he’s calling Dean in the first place. “What’s up, the two of you get into your first couple fight or something? Surprised you think I’ll take your side.”
“Again?”
Anna had refused, and then the order had come through to Castiel to shoot her.
“Shut up, you sarcastic bastard,” said Jo. “Just so you know, I had to do a lot of favors for Charlie to get this, okay? Like a lot of favors-“
“Oh. Gotcha,” Benny said. “He is a hard man to say no to.”
Well, maybe at his shoulder would be the correct way to phrase that, Dean thought to himself, as he stared down at the glossy varnished bar top and the pitiful glass of whiskey he’d been sipping at for half an hour already. He wanted to be out of his mind. He wanted to soberly count every second before his brother said yes to the worst of all propositions, and somehow keep the sands of time from slipping through his fingertips for just a little longer.
“Don’t mention it to Gordon if you want to live,” Selma had said next, though she stopped suddenly at the end of her sentence and glanced at him worriedly. Jo had probably told her to watch him for ‘talking about dying’. Castiel ignored her caution.
When he barged into Jo’s cabin demanding she cut his hair, he ignored the worried look she gave him, or the fact that Charlie was there too with Crookshanks in tow. The cat rubbed itself affectionately against Cas’ legs, and Cas felt a lump build in the back of his throat. Jo agreed after a few minutes of Cas offering a series of more useless excuses, seeming to realize she wasn’t going to get a real answer out of him. So she sat him down on a chair, and sent Charlie out to get the scissors from Risa.
