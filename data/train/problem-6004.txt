“Yes l have thoroughly examined her and Jarvis is going to monitor her tonight at the Compound.  Tomorrow you can insist that she has a final check up before leaving so that l can map the timeline of her healing strength.
Suddenly Steve’s thighs parted and he found himself unceremoniously dumped on the floor under the table trousers still tangled around his ankles, Steve’s large hands yanked him round so that his face was scant inches away from the bulging erection hidden behind the zipper of his trousers.  One hand moved to curl into his hair whilst he watched wide eyed as the other pulled the zip down and released his huge cock guiding it towards his lips.
What are you trying to say? Oh yes didn’t I tell you, silly me.  Jarvis.2 has been running my Portal Program for the last two years, and finally for a brief window of time a portal will open between our two worlds.
“Avengers! This is the only warning I will give, if you do anything to cause Tony undue hurt I will end you all and you will never see it coming!”
Breathing heavily, hips jerking as he rode out his orgasm he traced the pattern of bruises his fingers had left on the pale skin of Tony’s hips.   There was an inherent feeling of rightness seeing his marks on Tony’s body, he would seriously need to think about having a permanent mark placed, so that everyone would know that his boy belonged to him.
Loki’s and Thor’s bastard pups will blood bond to the heirs and become their fiercest protectors, their loyalty will be absolute.”
He dared not move closer, the pheromones Tony was giving off just begged him to fuck him.  He pushed hard at his cock, willing it to go down but his alpha instincts wanted to ravage  and bond with the splayed out omega, to take what was his and remove the marks of the alien Captain.
It took more effort that he expected to climb out of the cot, his legs felt weak and his balance was off when he tried to quickly walk towards the door.   Just as he reached the door he realised that he was still naked, the towel having fallen off as he clambered out of the cot. He tottered back towards the bathroom as he remembered seeing some folded clothes on top of the linen basket, he could here Steve still taking in the other room as he struggled to get his legs in to the sweat pants only to realise they were huge on him as was the t-shirt.  Giving up on the sweat pants when they kept falling down, he made his way back towards the door, hoping that the stupid nurse had not locked it.
Steve pulled a now crying Tony onto his lap, rocking him whilst rubbing soothing circles on his back.  Dr Gottlieb and he exchanged mutual looks of satisfaction, this was a pivotal moment, Tony was actually acknowledging that he had problems and asking about age regression therapy. One final push was need to get him to agree, Conditioning therapy progressed so much easier when the patient thought they had made the choice for themselves.
“Bruce what are you doing?”
They had both laughed over the time Pepper had been so angry and exasperated with Tony during a board meeting for his lack of attention and continual playing on his phone that she had hauled Tony over her lap and spanked him hard with the paddle she kept in her purse in front of all the board members and then made him sit on his hands with the phone wedged in his mouth for the rest of the board meeting.  Tony had been so embarrassed but due to the contract he had with Pepper at that time he could do nothing about it, she had complete control over him in anything to do with Stark Industries as it was the only way he could keep the company in his name.
“Guys, he is very lucky to have survived with the injuries from whatever battle happened before he was thrown through the portal, he has a severe concussion, multiple fractures, deep tissue bruising and four broken ribs, thankfully none have punctured a lung, the most severe is a ruptured spleen .  Dr Cho has already set him up in the Cradle and full physical healing should take place within twenty-four hours.
Any omegas that fought or rebelled were subdued along with their followers and the Omega Crate made its appearance once again, not as a form of protection but as a form of containment and once the harsher Alpha Laws were passed then Omega Crates became a punishment tool as well.
"Why? I mean why is he so—"
Tony nodded his acquiescence. "So long as you promise to post it to every gossip blog within the hour."
-Tony, or her
They went down to the garage to grab the Audi, and Steve, ever the gentleman, helped him into the passenger seat — Tony putting up only a token attempt to get behind the wheel — and he sat and fumbled with his seatbelt as Steve closed the door then went around to the driver's side.
"Tony, go to bed," Natasha said.
"Not filling it out for you," Steve said with a shake of his head. And, to further drive home his point, he just turned the page on his magazine.
"You know there's no such person, right?"
He set about fastening the cufflinks, and Tony preened a little and said, "A knockout, huh?"
"Sure," Barnes said, "but you're gonna be waitin' a while for a bed."
"Fuck you."
"Yeah. Well, sort of."
"That's not true," Rhodey said.
"Yeah, no, I can kind of drive him up a wall."
She nodded, mouth pursed into a tiny, thoughtful pout. "And you don't wish to—"
Wait. Did he just say
"Look, they've said all kinds of shit about me over the years. And yeah, whatever, some of it I deserved, and some of it I didn't—"
"Meeting?" Barnes murmured as Tony said up and said, "Right, yeah, save it and close it, J." He hummed a little to himself and got up from his chair — more of a struggle than he would have wanted to show in front of Barnes, but whatever — and grabbed his sunglasses and his bag and his keys.
borrow one of those t-shirts. God forbid I breathe on them the wrong way. She's got syrup all over that one."
Barton just shoved a spoonful of cereal in his mouth and said around it, "That Trish Walker's pretty hot, though. You should do her show."
"Yeah," Tony said and flipped through a few more pages of provocative drawings. "I don't think they're as nice as these—" he added before stopping short at what was probably the first drawing Steve had done of 'Antonia,' and he frowned at the image of himself sitting at his computer, hair pulled up into a ponytail and wearing a tank top, breasts clearly unsupported by a bra (Steve really had a thing for his tits), one arm hugged around his waist while his other hand was fisted and pressed against his mouth. His brows were drawn, his eyes, even in pencil, giving the impression of being swollen and red, his face splotchy and tear-stained.
the mother, aren't you? I mean, you're a dame—
Steve merely nodded and scanned over something on a tablet while Bruce said, "Uh, but how is he
Natasha turned the tablet toward him, and he looked down to see a photo posted to one of the gossip sites that had to have been taken not half-an-hour ago of Steve on his post-run bagel-run with the headline, CAPTAIN AMERICA ON DATE WITH MYSTERY WOMAN: WE'RE  JUST  GOOD FRIENDS.
He turned to him, taking in the sight of Tony's brow-knitted concern and...embarrassment? Unease? Fear? Clearly, Tony thought he'd done something wrong.
"I've never met anyone that will fight me the way that you do and not give up. And I've never met anyone that I've
me. You broke my fucking heart, and you walked out like you didn't even care, like it didn't faze you. You left me standing there wondering what in the
"I'm not saying they're in love with each other. I'm just saying they want to fuck each other. There's a difference."
"I'm not trying to get you to change your mind. I'm trying to get you to make sure this is what you really want and you're not just doing it because you think the world would rather deal with Anthony Edward than Antonia Natasha."
Tony just stared at him a moment then blew out a breath and said, "Uh, they're called 'LEDs,' which stands for 'light-emitting-diode.'  Based on electroluminescence—
Bruce nodded his agreement before he frowned and put a hand to Tony's shoulder. "I'm sorry, Tony. You all right?"
Steve just nodded, and Tony suspected he was already figuring out a game plan for how they were even going to go about that.
anything, all right? He probably wasn't even talking about me."
"Eggs Benedict and blueberry crepes with whipped cream."
"If anyone knows what it's like to come back from being a brainwashed Russian assassin, it's our very own red-haired, formerly brainwashed Russian assassin that totally stole my name—"
Steve reached up and grasped Tony's hands, and he brought each one to his mouth, pressing a gentle kiss into each palm. "Thank you."
"One night, Tony," he murmured. "That's all I ask."
Tony stared at him a moment, wondering how he could ever doubt himself, then exhaled a slight breath and said, "Yes, babe. It's OK. You did good, old man."
"Yeah, no, I'm not exaggerating. Three most popular things on the internet. But it's kind of like the wire service — you know how you're always connected to the wire service? It's like that but a massive group of people are sending out information and messages at the same time, and they're all talking to each other, and you interface with a computer— er, a television screen. Text and pictures. Videos. Audio. It's… It's really amazing when you get down to it. Everything's done on the internet now. Which is both good and bad. Unfortunately, everyone seems to think they're entitled to their fifteen minutes of fame now, and with the internet, well…"
"No, it's just weird. And annoying. You know what it's like having a head shoved into your bladder or what I can only imagine is a foot shoved into your rib? Or an arm shoved into your liver? Or something constantly drumming on your intestines?"
And then, he smiled oh-so-slyly and turned to Tony. "Right, honey?"
Tony whirled on her, fire in his eyes. "I am
," Tony amended pointedly, "and I've sort of gotten used to, over the years, maybe not being as
with Captain America. But that was the muscly guy on the poster that was like the second coming and this perfect and noble and just and heroic, larger- than-life superman of righteousness."
"I'm starting to get the feeling you're trying to discourage me from doing this."
of this, I am so fucking horny, I almost can't stand it. So, yes, I'm sorry for taking the easy road and making fun of your age. And I'm sorry for being a little pissy about everyone else going out and having fun in the sun while I have to spend two days being bashed over the head with the fact that something the size of a fucking
A broad and somewhat embarrassed smile stretched over Steve's lips. "Thanks," he said quietly, though Tony could tell from his tone that he didn't really feel like he deserved the compliment.
Because... Because...
It was another nearly twenty minutes before Tony seemed to come out of his own post-coital haze, sitting up and groaning like he was just waking up from a long nap. He shivered a little and looked down at himself, and Steve, towel wrapped around his waist, got up from where he'd been sitting at the computer attempting to do some research on the being they'd encountered for that brief moment and stood in front of him and said a sheepish, "Hey."
Tony went to say something when he realized an older couple seated at the table beside them was giving them funny looks. Tony met their confusion head-on and said, "Yes?" like they were the crazy ones and not him and Steve.
"You can scramble eggs," Tony said and set the bowl down then tried to remember how Jarvis had made the French toast once upon a time. "And just barely at that— And before you say anything, you got lucky with the steaks last night. Actually, they were a little overdone, but I didn't want to say anything because I'm a big believer in it being the thought that counts."
"You wish me to do something to the Chancellor?" she asked the Council, but by the tone in her voice and the flash of red in her eyes, it was apparent that their answer to that query could very well be a matter of 'life' and 'death' for them.
Tony grinned and snugged further into the blanket that smelled like happiness.
sorry."
"He tried to cook for you," Barnes said, his voice a little broken but seeming to possess some amount of strength and awareness to it — a little more so than yesterday, even. "Told 'im it was a bad idea."
"I can handle seeing naked people, Tones. Just was not expecting that…full frontal…the moment I walked in the door," Rhodey said and took a seat on the chair. "How's this working, anyway? We all going out with you?"
. Did you not have the form of a human female when the conception occurred?"
"You're not going to tell me, are you?"
"OK," Bruce said and stood up again. He reached out for her hand, and she took it, and just when Tony thought they would get her out of there without any other problems, she had to go and fucking ruin it on them.
"How close?" he asked, daring to be brave.
paid him a compliment and you don't even realize it," Tony said, and Barton furrowed his brow.
"Tony, the press is going to be all over me for this."
"How do you know?"
DUM-E whirred at him and set the bites down on the tabletop.
After all the wrinkles had been steamed out of the gown, Natasha and the assistant helped him into the designer's most rushed creation (she let them know this about five times in the time it took for Tony to step into the gown and for the other two to get him situated and zipped into it). There was no mirror in the penthouse living area, and so Tony didn't know what he looked like yet, but both the assistant and Natasha seemed to think it looked OK on him, if their smiles were anything to go by, and even the designer managed something like relief when she saw the way it fit him.
about what are the proper things to demonstrate to a child."
She shrugged. "Suit yourself," she said and nodded at Maria that they'd be in presently. Hill nodded her understanding and went back into the room, leaving the door ajar, and Natasha went over and said, "Point of no return."
"Not a thing. Buck got two for the price of one, and I got—"
, before you go any further, we should move this to a more private location?"
"Yeah, how are we supposed to go about finding them?" Jim asked.
"OK, one and all. Gather 'round. The Captain and I have an important announcement to make," Tony said as they walked into the penthouse late that afternoon. "Also, what the hell? Are we on
"Really?"
"Shh…"
"Yeah, but that's you doing something to yourself. It's different when someone else is sticking you."
Did this joint have a bathroom they could use for, like, five minutes? Five was probably good enough, right?
There was a couple tucked into a table toward the back, close to the counter but away from the windows, and something told Tony this was his man (and woman), but he went over to the counter and looked over the chalked menu for only a moment before he ordered — god help him — a large herbal vanilla chai-thing.
He looked down at the contentedly sleeping form therein, some weird pang hitting him square in the chest as he considered that somehow this was his child. Not biologically, of course. She looked too much like Tony for that. But this little girl with the wispy blonde hair and the big, dark eyes that babbled at him and called him 'Daddy'…
"Of course she's not. She's dead," Tony said then turned his attention back to Ella. "Anyway, long story short, crazy space lady finds me, like, six months ago, senses I'm 'bonded'—" he used finger quotes on the word, "—to this one here—" he jerked a thumb at Steve, "—and then says, 'You know what you two need? A kid.'" He motioned over himself. "Then, presto-change-o I'm like this so that
But Natasha just smiled at him and said, "Tony, do you want to come with us?"
"Goodnight, honey," Steve said and leaned over him to kiss his cheek. Tony made a lazy kissing motion in his direction and then snuggled down, and the bed dipped and moved behind him some as Steve leaned back over onto his side and shut the light off then bedded down for the night.
He wasn't sure how long he was there before the door opened and a little girl in a too-big t-shirt toddled on through, and he looked up from where he sat working on specs for the Mark XVI and watched as she padded over, yawning and clutching a pillow.
And why had it taken so long for Steve to live his dream? Surely, he didn't wait seventy years. What about Peggy? Didn't he marry her after the war?
Tony sighed dramatically and rolled his eyes again. "Fine. You worry too much, but fine."
"How?" Steve asked, utterly perplexed. He hadn't owned a car since his old jalopy back in college, but he was pretty sure all cars came with remote keyless entry nowadays.
"You're going to have to be more specific than that, Tony," Bruce said as he joined them.
Steve couldn't help but laugh. "We're not even done with breakfast yet."
"Steven, I have a small watermelon currently strapped to my gut. Please keep that in mind."
—" he motioned at Tony's abdomen, "—is what you've been missing ever since the future version of your husband came to take her back to where she belonged?"
"I could," Steve said just as the infant in his arms began to squawk.
Tony glanced up, raising an eyebrow at the man that was doing his best to stare back at Tony, innocence written over his face. Tony stared at him a moment more before he blinked and shook his head, telling himself he was crazy. He was looking for correlations and connections where there were none. This was just some guy from Jersey that — somehow — was in possession of Steve's old photos. There was nothing 'there' beyond that.
Barton shrugged noncommittally then handed the small box over to Tony. "Here. Got you something."
He adjusted himself in the chair and tried to cover up the sudden stiffness plaguing his cock, eyes closed and face flushing with the heat of want. Sam was muttering something at Bucky, and Bucky was laughing and saying something about how this was the most excitement Steve had gotten in months, and even though he heard voices, and even though he was in public, all he could see with his eyes closed was Tony, wanton and willing, on his knees, gagged, collared, bound, and looking up at Steve with those gorgeous brown eyes of his, those inky black lashes, pupils blown wide with the desperate need to be taken and fucked into submission—
"I think it's a reasonable reaction," Tony said after a moment of watching the computer run through the test. "I mean, my pal Rhodey and me? I was straight and he wasn't and he said he didn't think I was fuckable? Yeah, I'd be a little insulted. Like, what's wrong with me? Why aren't I good enough? Am I unattractive? Am I hideous? Why am I not fuckable?"
Still, Steve shook his head and said, "Nope. Can't tell you."
"Ugh, that's stupid. What time?"
"Steve may be the boss, but I'm the one that pays for everything and builds everything and makes you guys look cool. Always have to be thinking about this sort of stuff."
Steve grinned, and he reached up and toyed with the blonde hair of the wig Tony had on his head. "I think Antonia Natasha is more of a brunette than a blonde, though."
They rode the elevator in silence until they arrived at their destination, and Tony pushed to the front and stepped off first as soon as the doors opened, and he turned back around and said to Steve, "Look, if you don't like it, I can change it back. It's no big deal. But I just thought... I don't know."
Tony hummed in thought then turned to Pepper and Hill. "How's the media treating us?"
"If that is in your powers," the first man to speak said.
She shook her head and said, "No," again.
"Don't start that again."
want a boy — but I just… I don't want to
"Because as soon as I fall asleep, someone else is going to wake up looking for a meal, and she can't just have J order her something from Mama Lucita's."
"Does this change your standing with the Avengers?"
"What?"
"Oh, I forgot. Kill counts."
Olivia just pressed her face into Steve's shoulder again, and the man turned his attention to Tony and said, "Hey, Merry Christmas, man," and put his hand out for a shake, but Tony slapped it away and pulled him in for a hug.
"Colostrum."
"Tony, it's eleven-thirty."
"Not what you were expecting, I know."
as your pal was."
"Sure," Steve said with a grin. "Couple of nice, brisk miles will do wonders for you."
Tony closed his eyes, stilling his hand atop Steve's head. "Yeah," he murmured opening his eyes but not looking at Steve.
"If you don't want to, we don't have to—" Steve said quickly, like he was backing down from the idea because he was afraid he'd pushed the limit too far.
"Outdated and stuck in his ways?"
"Really? 'cause he was fine up until—"
"And?"
Steve had learned the art of a fast shower back when he was in the service, but his fastest shower time in 1943 paled in comparison to now as he undertook what he supposed could be called a 'shower' only in the most technical of terms as he soaped up and rinsed off in anticipation of... of...
way you can buy me that time?"
He glanced over and watched as Steve pulled the sketchbook a little about closer. "Uh," he said, hesitating, "I don't know if you want to."
"I'm sorry," he said, looking anything but, "I'm still trying to comprehend the fact that
"Yeah, now. But she's going to be cranky later on if she doesn't nap, and evidently, we're having your relatives for Christmas Eve dinner."
"You told Cap he was allowed to hang out up here any time he wanted. Figured the same held true for the rest of us. I mean
"It's really not that bad," he tried to reason, but Pepper was having none of it.
Steve just finished lacing up his shoes and looked up at Tony. "With what?"
She looked up at him and very earnestly babbled something at him that he thought was supposed to be a question, but the words just didn't translate in his head, and he shrugged at her and said, "I'm sorry. I'm not your real dad, so I don't know what you're— Does he usually understand what you're saying?"
Steve will stubbornly insist until the day he dies that he's fifty-two years older than I am and that
He inhaled a deep breath through his nose then exhaled it with a bit of a sigh. "They're just… things I've noticed. Things that happened when I was asleep. Other people got to watch these changes. I didn't. I just…woke up one day and had to accept that they'd happened."
Tony continued to sob as Natasha led him out of the kitchen, and he sucked in an uneasy breath — breathing had become more difficult, too, the bigger he'd gotten — and said a pathetic, "I don't know why."
"Forever and ever," he murmured, and Tony managed a teary smile in return.
Steve pretended to think about this a moment then said, "Yeah, I guess I am."
He raised an eyebrow.
"About what?" Bruce asked as he gathered the samples together and made to carry them over to another part of the lab.
"Fuck that," he muttered. "You're marrying Tony Stark or you're not getting married at all." He scrolled down the page some more and read it over. Neither one of them had been married before, so that section didn't pertain to them, but then he got to the name change section and said, "Uh… what about names?"
He didn't bother to notice when Bruce left. Probably when he'd stopped talking. He spent his time curled up on the couch and bookmarking possible selections, and he didn't realize how long he'd been sitting there until he heard a small voice call from the top of the stairs, "Papa?"
There were questions about his occupation (he put 'entrepreneur' for that) and tobacco and alcohol and drug use ('no,' 'quit,' and 'no') and whether he was currently taking any medications.
a lie because no one had actually told him to his face that it was a boy. "Like most first-time parents, we decided not to find out. But, I mean, I'd be lying if I didn't admit we're both hoping for a boy."
Because while Steve might not have been in love with Barnes like that, and while Barnes evidently didn't go for men like that, Barnes was still part of that life that had been forcibly ripped from him all those years ago, and Tony couldn't fathom in any way how this life that Steve led now could compare to that other life, his real life, the one he truly belonged to.
Tony again watched him stuff crinkle cut fries and then another large bite of what looked like a double into his mouth then said, "Can you come up with any more bad lies?"
God, he hoped this baby was completely one hundred percent Steve's. Fucking movies. Fucking stupid movies.
" then turned to the guy and smiled some more and said a softer, "No, no, you know what?" He reached out and brushed his fingertips against the guy's arm. "I like the cut of your jib. And the cut of your jaw," he said and motioned to the guy's…rather weak jaw, if he was being honest. Well, weak compared to Steve's, but then, most guys' were.
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes. "
"Yeah," Tony all but whispered.
"Indeed, but perhaps not the reason you think."
…motion. God, it was so…
"Dunno."
everything is OK, but I'd like some empirical evidence to put my mind at ease."
Steve's lax attitude about his own safety worried him on his best day, but now with this…issue…of his, he was downright terrified. This was so far off the spectrum of life experiences that he didn't even know where to begin to process it, but the main thing keeping him sane was that Steve was right there alongside him. Changed into a woman, impregnated, forced to carry a fetus to term: the fact that he had chosen none of this was downright terrifying, and not that he didn't appreciate having the others there to support him — he did, god did he — but having Steve there beside him meant more than anything. Not just because it was Steve's child (though he suspected that was a large part of it) but because it was Steve and because he'd kind of promised Steve 'forever' a few months ago, and much as he trusted and appreciated the others being there for him, he trusted and appreciated and
"Tony, I can't be out there doing what I have to do if I have to worry about you getting yourself into trouble—"
. This is— Isn't this—?"
He couldn't take the humiliation that would come of it.
Because he was afraid of Steve seeing him like this. Because he was afraid of Steve being reminded of the broken-down, old man that he had married. Especially having possessed a body that, even through a pregnancy, was practically physical perfection.
this was his daughter from the moment JARVIS had read the DNA results back to him, but this was the first moment he'd actually
"Yeah," Rhodey agreed, "he does get like that when he's trying to put on a front."
Tony went through three-quarters of a loaf of bread by the time everything was said and done. He got two slices out of it. Steve, very gladly, ate the rest and then conveniently disappeared right around the time Tony was getting ready to clean up the mess of breakfast dishes. He stood there, staring at Steve's departing form, dishes in-hand, and he rolled his eyes and turned to the dishwasher, grumbling about how Steve would be living in his own filth if it wasn't for him.
Steve just met his gaze, and he let out one more pointed sigh then said, "Get the pillows,
leave him in a fucking iceberg for almost seventy years.
Steve sat back and rested his forearms on his knees. "Test
more where this came from."
," she muttered then turned to Tony. "C'n we watch
Steve shook his head. "Tony, no, that's not what I meant—"
"I am, aren't I?"
Steve shrugged but continued to sway with the baby, and Tony followed his lead. "Not much," Steve said. "Just having a dance with my best girl."
the team—"
"Honey!" he said with a laugh and reached out to take Tony's hands in his. "It's fine. It's no big deal. It happens every day. No one's going to take advantage of you. No one's going to do anything without your consent. And if anything does happen, I'm here, OK?"
about having a daughter?"
Steve motioned over his delicate ensemble. "This."
Cap scoffed. "What?
Barnes shrugged, but he had that look on his face like he really wasn't sure what to make of the situation, like something halfway between a sneer and a grimace.
"That's it?" Bruce called after him.
Someday soon, he was going to be greeted with the very unwelcome realization that Tony and maybe even Olivia liked him better as well.
"—exhausted. Oh, come on, Steve! She's sleeping!"
Steve stepped a little closer to him. "Stop it before you say something you'll regret."
Tony leaned closer, resting his chin on Steve's shoulder as he put his arms around his waist. "Hmm… So,
Steve picked up the one that was supposed to be him — or Captain America, anyway — posed with the shield in-hand. "But it's not even Christmas-themed."
"What?" Steve murmured, but Tony leaned forward like he was trying to get a better view of what the doctor was seeing on her tablet and said, "Wait, I didn't actually mean to write that."
Both Clint and Steve turned their gazes on him, Clint somewhat disturbed and Steve pretty bemused.
confused."
"Nothing," he said and leaned against the counter, dropping his voice almost to a murmur so that it hopefully wouldn't draw Olivia's attention to him. Rhodey would try to hold her, but she'd probably be able to wiggle her way out if she was determined enough.
"Together."
Bruce and Natasha exchanged looks, and Wilson called out once more, "Nat, come on! Cap's got that look on his face!"
"Can you be sure of that? He hasn't been your
Maybe in trying
"David Welch?
So, as he came to find out, sharing silence with Steve was not the nerve-wracking endeavor that it had once been for him. It was actually kind of nice, safe, comforting. He didn't feel the need to perform or pretend with Steve, and so he could sit there and work and wallow in his thoughts, Steve's quiet presence a study anchor for him to latch hold to. It was OK not to have to fill every single void with sound. Steve wasn't going to get bored with him just because he wasn't entertaining him constantly, and Tony knew that Steve, sometimes, just enjoyed knowing that Tony was there with him, too.
"Papa! Papa, wake up!"
"I didn't. I just said—"
"True," Barton said. "No one needs to see another repeat of last night's Shake Shack incident." He shivered like it was one of the worst things he'd ever seen before something came to him, and he grabbed his phone and pressed a few buttons and swiped through a few screens then held the phone out to show Tony. "By the way, you're already a meme."
"He needs more ammunition for his pen," Tony said and sipped his beverage through the swizzle stick it came with.
"I know what you were saying," Tony said and sat back in the seat, waving a hand in the air. "I think we all know what you were saying, and it disgusts me. I'm disgusted. Here I am,
He dropped his hand from his belly and switched the light off again. They had time, he figured as he closed up the door and went back over to his bedroom. Not like the little monster was making his appearance tomorrow.
"You just told me thirty minutes ago that you didn't think Pepper and I were right for each other."
"Seriously? What the hell's with the sex on the brain all of a sudden? Last night wasn't enough for you?"
"And now that the world knows there's a Baby Cap out there…"
my movements if we’re hitting the 'pause’ button on certain things for the time being.”
"Well, no more than might be had in what your kind might consider a more 'conventional' situation. Besides," she said and stepped up to Tony, going around Steve as she reached a hand out to Tony's abdomen and drew an index finger from his lower abdomen up to his heart, "these lives are connected and have been from the moment of conception. Where one ceases to exist, so shall the other."
He sat down and set his clutch on the table, and he looked up at the other three that were still standing and said, "What? Was I not supposed to sit?"
Tony hummed in agreement then said, "She's very relaxed with you."
Pepper sighed once more and said, "
He shook his head a little and dropped his hand, and he looked over to where DUM-E was hovering by the door, either like he was waiting for Steve to come back or he was waiting for an invitation to actually do some helping of some kind. Tony took pity on what he supposed was technically his 'eldest' and he sighed a little and waved at him and said, "OK, come on. I can probably find something for you to do here."
represent the life's work of O. L. Edwards," she said and led them over to the introductory panel of the gallery. "She went by her initials because she was afraid she wouldn't be taken seriously if it was known she was a woman."
"Dunno. Should I?"
"Tony," he said and kneaded his fingers into Tony's flesh, "that's not… Listen to me. I… Yeah, I didn't handle that the way I should have, and I know you think that it's you, but it's not you. It's me. I'm not disgusted by you. God, how could I be? I'm angry at myself, Tony. That's what that was about. I'm angry with myself because I…did this to you. It's my fault this is happening, and I… I should never have let this happen. I should have had more control over myself. I should have stopped it before it got so far. But now it's all this and I just… I need to fix it, Tony. I need to figure out a way to fix it and make it better. I just…don't want to hurt you any more than I already have."
But there was a part of him that throbbed deep down that wanted desperately for Steve to do this, to take him, to call him 'Antonia' and tell him 'good girl' and treat him like the queen, the goddess, that he was starting to see himself as. He'd always felt Steve was holding back with him — since he'd turned into this, anyway — and he wanted to know… He wanted to know what it would be like, what it would feel like, for Steve to take him, to give him everything, to treat him not as a man that was trapped indefinitely in a woman's body but as a person in possession of a female body.
"I don't know," Steve said with a slight shake of his head. He cut off another bite of steak, and he paused before he took the bite and glanced at Tony. "You know, we might not have a choice."
"Buy yourself something pretty."
Steve glanced up at her. "Yeah, but the license on file is for Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. And one of these vultures
"Oh, I'm sorry," Steve said like he was humoring him, the bastard. "Also because you can't bear to let yourself admit that Clint could be right about something."
"But I want you to— I want you to take me, you know? Maybe rough — just a little rough and possessive and—"
Steve turned to him, a wry smile on his face, and he said, "Did you really have to chase her off like that?"
He sat up and went to protest, but Natasha glared at him and said like she was trying to keep her temper, "Honey? Is there something you want to tell me?"
"Here's a shocker: Your daughter loves Christmas music," Tony said and glanced in the rearview mirror. Steve followed his eye and saw the little girl — Olivia, Tony had called her — strapped into something, bundled up in a puffy coat, and clutching the two little plush dolls that were joined together at the hands. Captain America and Iron Man.
"Wait, are we talking about actual breakfast food or dicks now?" Barton asked. "Because you have a disturbing habit of turning the most innocent expression into something about Cap's dick."
"Brooklyn?" Steve suggested, his mouth twisted into a wry smile.
"Pep? What's wrong?"
"Language."
"What's got his panties in a bunch this morning?" Natasha asked as she came into the kitchen. Wilson and Barnes followed behind, and Tony groaned and then pointed at Steve. "This is all your fault."
But Steve was not deterred, and trapped between a giant super soldier and that super soldier's loyal jogging buddy, Tony squawked out a few more times before Steve's mouth was on his, and Tony made sure to keep his mouth shut tight in case Steve tried that same bullshit he'd pulled on him at the cabin. But Steve just kissed him chastely and pulled back, the picture of innocence.
No, the serum merely amplified what was already there. Captain America was who he was because Steve Rogers was who he was. Because he was that earnest, that steadfast, that honest and cunning and intelligent and detailed and precise and caring and charitable and—
"Fine," he said and dropped the sour face to smile at Steve. "Back the way I'm supposed to be."
"Game five of the World Series," Steve muttered like he was still bitter over the events. "It was a Subway Series that year. Against the Yankees. Whit Wyatt and Joe DiMaggio almost got into it in the fifth." He looked at Barnes. "Should've known then that was the end."
And the talkative little brat sitting on his lap.
He opened his eyes and furrowed his brow at his surroundings. This…didn't look like his bedroom. It didn't look like his bedroom in
"I didn't say that—"
"Does Tony even know you work there?" Bucky asked.
They'd whittled the piles down to the last remaining few, and Steve picked up a small box that read it was from Bucky and Sam in equal measure, and he threw a glance up at Bucky and said, "You and Sam went in on something together?"
"Determined, isn't she?" Steve mused and took a bite of his bagel. Tony just hummed his agreement.
"Oh, don't be like that! You know that's not what—"
"Fine," Tony said and picked up his fork. "But don't think I'm going to enjoy it."
"Don't you?" the woman asked, and Tony realized she was recording him. "Isn't that the name you gave the restaurant when you were seen dining with Captain Rogers several weeks ago? The same Captain Rogers you were seen with at the marriage bureau after that? The same Captain Rogers you were seen with leaving an obstetrician's office on Madison Avenue just the other day?"
"I'll be fine, Bruce."
He shoved the other half of the doughnut in his mouth and chewed while Steve pulled out the container of orange juice and poured a glass for both himself and Tony. He held one out to Tony, and Tony took it, unthinking, as he chewed and stared at the piece of paper on the door of the fridge.
IDs don't match, well…"
"Why?"
and— and then you'd— you'd finally have me so loose and so wet from—
Tony frowned and tilted his head at Steve, but Esmeralda said, "Oh, you never know. Maybe not right at this moment, but it could come in handy again at some point."

She was a handful. There were no two ways around it. She was a precocious pain in the ass, and it was at that moment that he wondered if that was the kind of kid Cap had been before he brushed the thought aside. Olivia was his biological daughter, not Cap's, and her
Steve would notice that, and Tony knew which moles in particular Steve, the pervert, was thinking of.
He just shook his head and moved onto more pressing matters.
(All right, and DUM-E had helped, which maybe accounted for the kind of scraggly bow.)
this is where I leave you," Pepper said, good-naturedly but with a hint of desperation. She picked up her glass and stood up, telling them she'd catch up with them in a bit before she headed over to where Natasha was now talking with Sam and Sharon, who were being kind of handsy with each other.
Knowing what (little) he did of how the universe worked, and understanding that the world he called 'home' had been visited by beings from foreign worlds (outer space, he might have called it once upon a time), he wondered if, with that
He let out a light laugh and cradled her a little closer. Fuck, if only his nightmares were as benign as that.
"No, but it only happened because Crazy McLooney said we're soul mates—"
good when it comes to studies of anatomy."
Tony held out his hand, the ring flat in the palm of his hand. "Uh… Would you put this on me?"
"Please," he muttered and set the bag and the coffee down on the island and pulled a McMuffin out of the bag. He unwrapped it, took a large, savory bite, and said, "I fownd 'n arduckle, St'ven."
"Here goes nothing," he said and closed his eyes before he fanned the pages again and came to a stop. He pointed to a place on the page, and together, they looked to see where his finger had landed.
Tony sat down at the table and snapped out his napkin, and he set it on his lap as he looked over the spread of food before him.
Jesus Christ, she really
"Jesus, Tony, don't even say that! I just... Her fingers are so small!"
A wave of sadness seemed to wash over Tony. "I know. And that's what scares me."
Steve was focused on whatever he was reading on his tablet. "I don't know, honey. It just is."
Her phone began to buzz, and she pulled it out and checked the readout. "And so it begins," she muttered and answered it, "Hill," before taking off to another corner of the room, and Tony turned to Pepper.
He stuck the fry in his mouth and chewed it, making sure to catch Steve's eye as he did so. Steve nodded in approval and went back to his plate, and Tony stared down at his.
"Good."
He glanced down at his hands. They looked a little older, a hell of a lot more worn, but nowhere close to fifty. "How old am I supposed to be?"
"Kind of like an even, rhythmic sort of thing?" he asked. "Yeah, hiccups. Bank on it."
"Doing that sort of thing to me. Controlling me. Dominating me. Don't deny it. I can see the way you're flushing just from the very thought of it. You like the idea of me beneath you, writhing, submissive, a slave to your every whim and desire."
"I still could—" Tony went to say, but Steve leveled him with a look.
Wilson shrugged like it was an idea that couldn't hurt while Tony snorted out a laugh and said, "Are you kidding? He won't listen. 'Til the day he dies, he will remain steadfastly convinced he's too old for me."
"Steve, I'm not sure I can be in a relationship with such a backwards-thinking misogynist—"
at my breast. Why? Because I gave birth to your child. Why? Because I got turned into a woman and got pregnant by
"Well, look," Tony said, "she's not just some crackpot that snuck in off the street. Whoever sent her here intentionally sent her here."
"Papa, don't you want to see?" Olivia asked, hurt audible in her small and trusting voice. Tony just bared his teeth at her and made a gesture like he was trying to figure out if it was worth it or not to whip his glass at something.
? Are we expecting the Viscount of Barnswallow to arrive at any minute?"
Steve shrugged. "As has been drilled into my head the last two years, we do live in an area that allows for same-day delivery."
Tracy nodded and turned back to Other Tony. "He doesn't have to answer anything he doesn't want to."
But Barnes just sat there and scowled at him. "Look, all I know is what he was like during the war, and during the war, he only saw him as one of his projects that had actually gone
with Howard during the war. Howard made him what he is. He's the real McCoy. I'm the cheap knock-off."
"Fucking hell, Steve! Look at me! God, I can't even tell my husband I love him without sobbing like an idiot over it!"
"Yeah."
"Yeah."
"Whatever. Look, I don't actually need one of those doctors. You've read our files. You know us better than any of those other quacks in the outside world would. I just need you to do a quick workup for me."
"Not all of them," Steve muttered in response.
Tony did purr at the feel of Steve's knuckle rubbing against his clit — though he'd deny it was 'purr' until he was blue in the face — and he ran his hands up to Steve's shoulders and braced himself there as he said, "You're the boss," making sure to give Steve an adequate view of his cleavage. Steve's gaze zeroed in right where Tony wanted it to before he got up, standing to wiggle out of the lace panties, resorting to having to unhook then re-hook the garters, before he climbed back on top of Steve, who had already deposed himself of his clothing.
," Steve said in that stupid accent and leveled him with a pointed look.
" the second man all but cried, clutching tight to the vial in his hand.
Steve sat quietly for a very long moment, like he was giving the matter serious consideration, before he finally said, "I don't know. Sometimes, I feel like…that's where I belong. I don't belong here. I'm not… I'm not from this time. I understand it, and I can get through it, but it's not… I don't belong here. I don't have the same experiences as the rest of you. I see things differently. I remember things — I
"Yeah huh," he said and set the iron to cook again. "Just like that pizza you chowed down the other night. Taste it."
Tony hummed and considered this then said, "Depends on if you show me that sketchbook or not."
"Yeah," he said, inputting a few codes into the module and not bothering to look at Barnes. "When I was a teenager, so, that clearly goes to show how useful it is."
"Hey," Rhodey said, and Tony turned his attention back to him, "have you made any progress in the getting-her-home thing?"
no choice to be made. I didn't
Tony swallowed and looked from the phone then to the woman that he suspected was a reporter. He watched as her lips moved, and he knew there was some kind of sound being made there, but he couldn't understand the words she was quite obviously saying. Not after—
"No, I think I'm going to have to agree with my beefy, blonde friend here," Tony said, and she turned her attention to him. "It's cruel. It's absolutely cruel. You're saying if anything bad happens to this cluster of cells that I'm going to die. And you didn't exactly explain what happens when this goes to term. Am I suddenly going to develop a vagina? Is this thing going to go all John Hurt in
"I don't want to—"
"And what's 'a small amount'?"
Finally, after what seemed like ages that Steve stood there staring at him, evidently weighing various pros and cons in his mind, he heaved out a sigh. "Can you be ready to leave here by six?" he asked, sounding resigned to the fact that he wasn't in any way talking his way out of this one.
"You know, I think you're better at that than I am. We should play to our strengths. I'll feed her. You can change the diapers."
"No," he reiterated, trying to be as breezy and nonchalant as he could, "I'm definitely not dying. I'm just... First Christmas I've had with a family — with my own family — that I've had in a very long time." He shrugged and set the cutter down to pick up a snowman cutter. "Kinda nice."
God, he could have used his mother right about now. At least it would be one person that could kind of understand what he was going through. He could never say for absolute certain how she would react to this whole mess he'd gotten mixed up in, but he was sure she was strong and capable enough to accept the fact that she could become a grandmother through the most unconventional means imaginable.
"Where?" Bruce asked. "Is it around here or…"
"Yeah, it's more fun."
What did I tell you? She
takes after its father in when it comes to not just its appetite but its weight?"
"Tony, god, stop,
He took a deep breath.
"Of course."
Steve sighed and hung his head a little. "You already said that."
Barton made a gesture as though to say Thor had proven his point, and Tony frowned and said, "Howard was a complete tool to me, but you don't see me out there trying to take over the world. I mean, what would I even do with an entire world, anyway?"
"Hmm?"
Barton had already moved to the front to take the controls, so Tony sat down to the side and huffed a bit, switching between eyeing his downed suit with disdain and eyeing Steve with annoyance. No, it wasn't the suit's fault it had failed him, and he thought back to the fall and how hard he'd hit the ground, and he glanced down at his abdomen and said without thinking, "Either you're still OK or that witch was full of shit." And then he realized what he was doing, and he rolled his eyes and shook his head and folded his arm—

He held his breath a moment as he waited for the results to display, and it wasn't until he heard Steve murmur a surprised, "
Tony tilted his head in thought. There
"Wait, who lives here?"
Tony was silent a moment before he said, "Ah."

Tony wanted to remind him of the sketches he'd just seen earlier that Steve had done of his other form — those rather provocative sketches he'd drawn with so much love and affection that the ones he'd done of Tony's male form looked downright clinical in comparison — but he kept his mouth shut because he already knew Steve would deny it 'til he was blue in the face.

Steve watched him for a moment and then, satisfied, let go of Tony's legs a moment and gently pulled his hands away so that he could mouth at Tony's breasts, kissing the soft flesh of each, suckling at the teats, nipping ever-so-lightly at the sensitive and erect peaks, then began to kiss a line from his breastbone down to his abdomen, dragging the tip of his tongue down the exposed flesh to just above the mound of pubic hair where he stopped and nosed at the rounded and swollen flesh that bore the hallmarks of a new life growing within. He kissed the small bump and then, meeting Tony's eyes for a brief moment, moved down even further and licked around the engorged and heretofore ignored nub of his clit.
He'd always known that he was a bit…
"Was it that difficult?"
Steve glanced up from his tablet and eyed the TV with unease, shoving the slice of bacon in his mouth as he did so.
Tony sniffled and shrugged. "I'm hormonal, I guess. I don't know."
Steve shrugged but continued to stare at the coffee table. "If we didn't have a choice. I mean it… It would still be safer for her this way."
Steve glanced over at him. "No, he wouldn't."
"Pretty much," Steve said with a sad shrug. "Anyway, Pepper and Nat think the best thing is to just ignore it. I guess they consider this something called a 'Friday night news dump'?"
"Maria."
He pointed over to an area where a red hat with a blue stars-and-stripes band hung from the ceiling.
She looked up at the ceiling. "Friday, where did my crayons go? Did that man take them?"
For some reason, Steve got the feeling he was more babysitter to this group of nuts than anything else.
"Tony, I'm the leader of the Avengers. We're on slightly shaky ground the way it is."
"No! No, not at all. It's very
"I can control the suit remotely."
"Fix this, I know," Tony said. "You're not the one that broke it."
"I really haven't thought that far yet."
But they were.
"Pretty sure I heard him say a

"That's it?"

. I'm not— I spent forty-three years of my life as a man, OK? This doesn't— And I'm not saying— I'm saying that I'm absolutely horrified that I'm being forced to endure something that was not of my choosing and might very well kill me before everything is said and done.
"Oh, my god," he muttered. "Look, do you see what I'm doing here?" Steve didn't look over, but Tony still motioned over himself. "I am sitting here nursing
He stuck his head under the shower head and felt the water beat against his scalp, wetting and weighing down his hair as it trickled over and down him, the slight tingle he felt as the water dripped from his hair onto his shoulders and back. He watched the water as it circled the drain and then disappeared, a slight whirlpool effect that he found equal parts mesmerizing and contenting. He remembered for only a brief moment that he was supposed to have been pleasuring himself at some point that afternoon — pleasuring himself for Steve's pleasure — but he couldn't even bring himself to touch himself in the privacy of the bathroom and for his own sake. It was hard to think about pleasure when his husband, the father of the little creature that grew inside of him, and the man that some cosmic goddess had assured him was his 'soul mate,' was probably now in the middle of recalling happier times with the last tangible vestige of his former life. Of course he was recalling happier times. Why wouldn't he? What was there to be happy about here? This was the life he'd gotten stuck with, wasn't it? Not the life he'd wanted.
Tony raised an eyebrow. "In men," he said, his tone flat.
Bruce just gave him a look. "You're not the only 'Tony' in the world."
was all he could talk about when I was growing up. How great he was and how fantastic he was and how brilliant he was and how good-hearted he was. It's kind of a small miracle I didn't repulsor the bastard's ass the first time I set eyes on him just to spite my old man."
"Is this a joke?" he asked.
Steve just furrowed his brow. "And you believed him— I mean
He still couldn't seem to sleep, so he got up and quietly padded out to the living room. He remembered as soon as he arrived that Barnes was sleeping on the couch, and he stood off to the side and stared at the sleeping assassin, wondering if this was all part of some plot that Steve would never believe — not until said plot was holding a fucking gun to his head, and even then.
He ached, and his breathing wasn't as good as it had been — like his lungs weren't getting nearly as much oxygen as he'd been used to, sort of in that way his breathing had been toward the end of the pregnancy — and he just felt…
Steve turned to see Olivia sitting beneath the tree again, a small half-wrapped package in her hand, the corner of which was stuck in her mouth as she chewed on it. Steve sighed and set his mug on the coffee table then stuck the remains of his bagel in his mouth and reached out to pull the small box away from her.
"He is," he said as Natasha and Thor followed on. Thor just kept on walking like he hadn't noticed anything while Natasha held back and raised an eyebrow at him. The armor merely stood expectantly and gave the impression of looking around, and she smiled a little and murmured, "Spoiled," and continued further into the 'jet.
He looked out over the amassed crowd of journos and photogs, the journos with their recording devices at the ready and the photogs snapping pictures left and right. He purposely avoided looking to the cameras in the back and instead thought about how he'd stood and looked out at a similar crowd at the start of his superhero career, when Obie — fucking Obie — had gone off the deep end and tried to kill him once and for all. He thought about how he stood up there as Tony Stark and proclaimed to the world that he was Iron Man, and he couldn't help but think that if it hadn't been for Iron Man, he wouldn't have been there at that very moment poised to tell the world that the woman — the
"Anyway, I've been wanting to— I mean it's OK if you say 'no,' but, uh... Would you mind… Could I…?"
"I know," he muttered, eyes suddenly a little watery and voice a little choked. Fucking hormones. "Old habits."
"Yeah, because I wasn't the perfect boyfriend—"
for a moment.
Oh, good. There were more of them, and he doubted all of them were as good-hearted at their core as James Buchanan Barnes.
They followed the flow of traffic into the ballroom, the grand room done up with large sprays of seasonal flowers, rose and azure lights that melded together for a soft purple glow, and a stardust effect lighting the ceiling. Steve just exhaled a light breath as he took in the array, pocketing his sunglasses with his free hand, and he shook his head a little and said, "This seems to defeat the purpose of raising money."
instead of come home with me — I, um, went to get in the car, and he grabbed me. I think he was trying to stop me, but he forgot his strength."
"Papa! Tha's th' 'spensive stuff!"
Steve just pulled the carton away and wiped his mouth off with the back of his hand. "Why does it bother you so much?"
"Tony paused in mid-action, and he raised a curious eyebrow at Bruce and said, "Excuse me?"
Tony gave a slight shake of his head. "Don't want to back out."
Again, if he was in a better mood, he might bristle and insist that he
"Do you like it when I do?"
"Where's Friday? Friday calls me 'Young Miss.' She calls Maddie 'Lil' Miss.'"
much," he replied and sat down at the island and grabbed the tablet Steve had left there. He considered the bitten half of bagel he held in his hand and added, "Jesus, this tastes like fucking perfection."
Steve couldn't help the grimace that covered his face. "I think she wants to share her cookie with me."
. Getting my nails done and getting dressed up is
"Good girl," Steve said and gathered up the spit and come that had dribbled down his chin on his finger and offered it to him. Tony swallowed, his throat a little raw, but still kept his eyes locked with Steve's as he reached out and sucked the fluids off his finger. Steve sucked in a shaky breath, but he exhaled it in a more confident and assured manner, and when Steve had finished cleaning him up, he stroked a finger down his cheek and said, "You were very, very good, Antonia. So good." He ran the pad of his thumb over Tony's lips. "So, very, very good, Antonia. You ready for the second round?"
Steve still had that look on his face like he wasn't sure he'd done well. "So…it's OK?" he asked again.
"Hey, are you really doing this?" he asked.
"OK, squirt, here we—"
Tony nodded at the wall. "Why's the TV off?"
"So, uh, there any reason you sent Birdman to tell me you wanted to see me?"
"Is that a good thing or a bad thing?" he asked, and Barnes shrugged.
"No," he said, believing that she hadn't...done to him what she'd once done to Tony. "No, I just... I thought maybe I could feel that I was—"
"And who did it after she stopped doing it?"
"I understand that, but we're not testing it. We shouldn't— Not until tomorrow. Not until after the clerk says we're married."
He reached in with his left hand, the soft amber lights of the garage catching on the diamonds and sapphires on his ring finger. He paused to look at it a moment, and he half-considered ripping it off and chucking it across the garage, but he figured he'd probably regret it in the morning, and so he left it be and just grabbed his bag and set it on the ground to slam the trunk shut.
Tony hummed in thought a moment then said, "If you're asking if I fantasize about Captain America on his knees with his mouth stretched over my cock—"
"Where did you get these?"
"Whatever," he said and rolled his eyes then snapped his fingers and said, "You know who's really hot with a beard? That guy, that, uh, oh, what the hell is his name? He was in that movie with the train and the snow. Kinda looks a little like Steve, don't you think?"
"You were brilliant, you know," the agent continued, evidently changing tactics somewhat. "You changed the world. You still could. You really want to give it up for this bunch of freaks? Even if they did trust you, what can they offer you? They're on their way out. Their leader's dead. They'll scatter like rats, and you'll be branded the same as your beloved little Natalia — a traitor to the very organization that made you."
"But you had to send her back."
Steve took a breath, and he was silent a moment before he said, "You know I would do it instead of you in a heartbeat, but she chose you specifically. She thinks this is your…duty or destiny or something, I guess you'd say. You're the creator, not me. This is just…part and parcel of that. I know she says we're bondmates or soul mates or whatever you want to call it, but I kind of get the feeling she sees me more as a means to an end."

He took a sip of the god-awful concoction then turned to look around the establishment, his gaze settling on the counter near to them, and out of the corner of his eye, he could see Other Tony giving him a funny look — kind of a small, almost knowing smile — as he murmured more to himself than anything, "Of course you don't."
like me. She isn't really mine."
"That's all I ask," Natasha said, and she stood watch as Tony pulled down the blankets and climbed into his side of the bed, groaning at the ache and at how tired he really was. As he settled in, she leaned down and pulled the blankets up for him then murmured something in Russian again and kissed his forehead. "JARVIS," she said as she stared at Tony, "put the shades down enough so Tony can catch a few actual winks of sleep."
"I wasn't being that loud!"
"No weirder than realizing that my ex-boyfriend is now pregnant with Captain America's baby, that's for sure."
"I think they tried to figure it out," Tony said. "They took samples, didn't they?"

So, Barton, Thor, and Wilson left with Steve, taking him god-knew-where, and Tony was left in the penthouse with Hill, Natasha, Bruce, and Rhodey. Tony sat down on the couch, arms folded as he pouted while the others cleaned up the mess from dinner, and after they'd finished and Natasha and Hill made their way to the living area to take seats around the TV, Tony said, "This was rude, I want you to know that."
"Do you want my help, Captain, or do you not?"
He looked at the little girl in his arms. "You like computers?"
"Begging you to
— he pulled out of the spot and swung the car around to the garage doors, JARVIS opening them on the approach.
He shrugged. "I'll try," he muttered, and Natasha stood up.
Jim snorted a laugh at that, and he went over and unfolded his arms to rest his hands on Tony's shoulders.
"Why?" Steve asked, eyebrow raised.

A woman.

"Maybe do something about that moustache."
"It wasn't. I don't even know why I'm saying this. Hell, even my Steve doesn't believe me. But trust me, it's not your fault. You did everything that you could—"
God, maybe he'd have to take Thor up on his offer just so he wouldn't be left entirely alone.
She was about to respond when Barton marched in, bow in hand and scowl on his face.
He twitched his mouth from side-to-side. "Let's just say fantasies of me and Cap go way back. Clearly, they're from before I met the sanctimonious son-of-a-bitch with his stupid, out-of-fashion hair and his perfect teeth, but I'm not going to deny I've had them in the past.

Pepper was still grinning, and she motioned to his head and said, "

He turned his attention back to them, and they exchanged looks before Steve said, "There…might be some extenuating circumstances."
But she looked up, eyes big and brown, and she stared right at Tony and said in a choked voice, "Papa!" and scrambled to her feet before she threw herself at him, wrapping her arms around his thighs and pressing her face into his hip.
"So, the Merchant of Death is actually the Giver of Life?"
"First of all, she fell out of a…portal." He took a breath to try to quell his nerves and pressed forward, pushing the thought of 'portals' out of his mind. "But sure, let's go with your angle. So, in some future alternate universe, some former flame that's just looking for a quick payout was able to send the kid back here, and not only that, but coached the kid to say that not only am I her 'Papa' but Captain Asshole is her 'Daddy.' What would be the point to that?"
"Why? She's from an alternate universe—"
"And I can afford it. So, yeah, I know, it makes more sense for me to stay home. Not saying you're not a big help and you're not her second-favorite person in the world, but, logically, it makes more sense for it to be me than you, and— Look, I love Iron Man. I love being Iron Man. Maybe I just love my daughter more."
To be perfectly honest, Tony would be lying if he said he didn't want to celebrate his birthday. He was accustomed to, in years past, throwing himself a big, ol' bash and inviting hundreds of people he barely knew or cared about just to have a loud, raucous, alcohol-soaked time. He'd enjoyed them for what they were worth, though the last time he'd done anything like that was the year he was dying of palladium poisoning. Getting shitfaced and fighting with Rhodey had kind of taken the bloom off of that rose, and since then, things had been a bit more low-key. His birthday back when he and Pepper were still dating had been spent on a romantic weekend getaway. After they broke up, it was spent in his lab. With Steve, it was a romantic dinner and then a hot, sweaty workout between the sheets.
Poor Steve still didn't seem to understand Wilson's need to read an outdated bio littered with purple prose.
"Always get you with the 'fine print,'" he grumbled and tightened his arms. He hummed a bit and closed his eyes, and after a moment of silence punctuated with the greedy slurps of his hungry child, he said, "You know, she's a gigantic pain in the ass."
Tony reached out and took Steve's hand and gave it a squeeze but didn't say anything. Sometimes he knew Steve just wanted to talk, especially when it concerned his wayward friend.
moment, but this one was a moment of his own making.
of making plans. Now, what else did you say?"
Steve just went into the bathroom and shut the door behind him. He flipped on the light switch and peered around. It was non-descript — OK, that wasn't exactly true. It was an absolutely
"Eh, came on a little strong," Bucky countered. "Sharon, but that got weird when it turned out she was Peggy's cousin."
Steve frowned at him. "Get ready?"
"Well, good for him. No one else with Barton and Natasha?"
"OK," he said and nodded again. "Let's get this show on the road."
"You ever heard the phrase 'overstaying your—'"
He grimaced as he pulled the bread out and closed the cabinet door. "Don't take this the wrong way, babe, but the smell of it is really not sitting well with me."
"He even did the extra credit questions."
," Steve murmured.
Steve doesn't feel that way."
to me. I don't… I don't think I could handle it just being 'fucking' tonight."
"I'm not tweaking— I was just— Oh, shut up."
"Not really," he said and sat back, thinking. "So, let me get this straight." He began to count off on his fingers. "She knows who I am, she knows who you are, she knows who Pepper is. She's mentioned Romanoff, Barton, and Thor. I'm pretty sure 'Mad Eye' is Fury—"
"Flipping houses?"
Steve took a sip of his chocolate and went into the room. He stared at the TV a moment and watched sharp, colorful images flash before his eyes then stepped around the couch and began to scope out the room.
"He's been put in worse spots—"
"And anyone that does believe it — what does that say about this world we live in? Where a man can be turned into a woman with a snap of the fingers?"
"Even me," he said. "I listen to you more than I've ever listened to anyone in my life. Ask Pepper. She's the next runner-up. But you? You're the only one that can corral this gang of idiots that calls themselves the Avengers. People believe in you. They
"That's totally true," Barton countered. "They teach you that in, like, Old Wives' Tales 101."
Tony took another sip of his drink then turned back to the couple and said, "Look, I'm not trying to be rude here, but I kind of have to get back, so, if you don't mind…"
"Mmm...I have my ways."
" he prodded.
It was the door slamming that did it. He didn't know why, but it was the door slamming shut and the reporter outside begging for more dirt that made Tony realize—
"Mmm...mortal — human — like the rest of us. You were almost a mythical creature or a legend — like King Arthur or Robin Hood or Paul Bunyan. I mean, I know you and Aunt Peg kind of had a thing for each other, but it was just...hard to picture you as someone's husband or old man — like you were removed from that sort of thing."
"Us. What we're doing. What the public's saying about us. It would be better if we got ahead of it."
He glared at him, but with the way the rain water had begun to run through his hair and soak through his suit, he looked the quintessential 'drowned rat'—
"What are you doing up?" Steve whispered to him once he'd gotten close enough.
Steve shook his head to clear his thoughts, and he glanced over at Tony just as Tony glanced up at him. Their eyes met for only the briefest of moments — Tony really did have such beautiful, expressive eyes — before Tony turned his attention back to his work and said, "You don't have to hang around here if you don't want to, you know."
when I said you had a family in that other universe. I just didn't say exactly
He waited a moment for Steve to feel what he felt, and his eyebrows shot up in surprise and said, "Is that supposed to happen?"
"OK," he said and kissed Tony's forehead one more time then went back over to the door. He stopped just as he was about to cross the threshold and turned back to Tony. "Hey," he said, his face completely serious. "I love you."
," Bruce said with a pained sigh.
I can do."
"Departed? You mean died?" he attempted to clarify.
He set the red shaker down and picked up the green one.
Steve just gawked at him, and Tony laughed.
"Hmm? Oh, I'm just trying to figure out how you can love the shit out of 'Free Bird' but not like 'Stairway to Heaven' or 'War Pigs.'"
She went contemplative at that. "C'we watch
Tony…honestly wasn't sure whether or not to believe him.
Steve didn't even look up from the tablet. "Tony?"
"Well, he's a gentleman," Sharon said with an easy shrug. She then made a slight face and added, "A little
Tony laughed. "Oh, babe, would that were true!"
Steve panted a few times and stroked Tony's hair. "Still OK?"
Tony arched an eyebrow, but he froze, and all he could suddenly think about was that dream — that god awful dream where he'd been turned into nothing but a womb to breed super soldiers. Fuck, it had been more prescient than he'd thought.
Tony watched the screen go black before he stretched again and set the phone on the nightstand. Good lord, did he feel
Tony hummed a little and said, "That sound you hear is the sound of seething jealousy."
"Bullshit. You said you didn't even tell the Hardy Boys about it. Must've been pretty bad to keep them out of the loop."
Steve glanced up in a little confusion and surprise.
"I fully expect you to. You and she are… You are my priorities now, you and Olivia. I mean, you've been, but…it's different now."
He used finger quotes. "—'magic'?"
"They thought they were hot shit during the war, too," Steve explained to Thor and Tony. "Cocky, overpaid SOBs."
He huffed a breath, and as the photographer set up his shot, Tony went up on his toes and pressed a kiss to Steve's cheek. And then, because he was an ass, he nudged one of Steve's arms free from his embrace, and he grabbed Steve's hand and slapped it over his belly just as the man took the shot.
Rhodey whistled and shook his head. "Wow…my boy's all grown up."
"Wait!" Tony said, slightly insulted because
"I can't hold her back much longer! She sees the presents. She knows they're for her. Get down here so she can open them!"
Steve nodded, and he swallowed and kissed Tony's forehead again and said, "I'll be back in a bit. Any requests? So long as I can find an open doughnut shop, anyway?"
"Like his semen?" Hill mused, her voice lilting up teasingly on the last word.
"To teach you how to dance?"
," he snapped. "
Wait, was she making fun of him and Steve?
Steve shrugged. "We understood each other. It was easy. He wouldn't look me in the eyes. I kept trying to… He wouldn't… I was so set on… I didn't even think about…"
Tony snorted a laugh even as he leaned into her touch. "Really? They told you what happens if I don't, for whatever reason, carry this…
," she explained as she settled onto one of the chairs.
"Yeah," he said and took his bag back. He dug through for his phone and pulled it out. "Just had to pee, like I seem to have to do
"Whatever," he said and took a sip then went back to the matter at hand. "But what the hell? Why change what they've been doing since the dawn of time?"
Once the Council had been served, 'Viz' sat in a chair in the corner and worked at whittling something from a piece of wood while the Red Witch turned to them and got down to business.
"Limited time offer, Captain. Once it's gone, it's—"
"But for reasons kind of out of our control, we weren't able to keep that just between us, and so here I am having this nice chat with all you fine folks."
"I have—"
He took the squirming newborn in his arms and cradled her to his chest, and he looked at the assorted 'freak show' that surrounded him and said, "I'm cool with it if you guys are."
Rhodey's eyes went a little concerned at that, his head tilted like he couldn't believe Tony had just said what he'd said, and Steve grabbed hold of his hand and gave his arm a slight tug to get Tony to turn his attention to him.
to throw him off, Nat leans over and grabs me and kisses me. And she may have felt me up a little bit, too. But does it work? No, guy just says it's a sandwich he'd like to get in the middle of. I mean, did he
" he shouted, glaring down at him.
He just shook his head and turned to glance at some flashing, lighted display across the way, not even bothering to pay attention to Tony, who had wedged himself into Steve's side and was taking more pictures with his camera. Allegedly. He also didn't even think about the fact that the arm that he'd draped over the back of the bench had somehow migrated to Tony's shoulders, not until he felt the rough texture of wool under the palm of his hand as he unthinkingly rubbed at Tony's shoulder.
He then went up on his toes and pressed a kiss against Steve's mouth, and Steve allowed himself to follow Tony's lead until such time as Tony broke the contact and moved away again. Steve licked his lips, getting the last remnants of Tony's taste into his mouth, and tried to quash that overwhelming feeling of disappointment at the loss of contact with Tony's body. Maybe it was some — what did Tony call it? — weird muscle memory of some kind. If he was actually married to him, he was probably accustomed to
Then again, it might have been something that had been going on forever, but it wasn't anything Tony ever thought he'd undergo himself — didn't even think it was
Bruce made a face. "I don't think I was there when you made that bet."
He bid 'goodnight' to Bucky and Sam and said he'd see them tomorrow, and when Bucky said, "Say 'hi' to your boy for us!" as he departed, he rolled his eyes and shook his head and waved him off, figuring it wasn't worth it to contradict him. Bucky wouldn't listen, anyway, and Sam would just back him right up.
"Not anymore, I'm not," he said and looked down at the newborn nursing at his breast. Even if his milk hadn't come in yet, evidently she was getting enough of whatever it was he was producing. Colostrum, wasn't it? Wasn't that what Steve had called it? She hadn't turned her nose up at it yet. Then again, she

He didn't think so, anyway.
"Which means?"
"What? We don't usually employ it, no. You know why? Because we're two adult

stupid."
"Duty calls," he said and glanced back up to meet Tony's gaze, and he again forced a smile that didn't meet his eyes as he held up his phone as though to show Tony his plans had suddenly changed and he totally wasn't just flaking on their 'bonding' time.
"No, Tony."
Now he was thinking it would be better if they just started over.
"I can imagine," she murmured.
"Hmm?"
"See?" Steve said, arms still folded as he gave Tony that
Look, he wasn't still under the impression this was Hydra's doing, but he just…he wanted to make sure he wasn't missing anything. That's all.
"Nope, she wants her Daddy to have it."
Tony tilted his head some like he was trying to catch Steve's eyes from beneath his eyelashes. "You sure? Just so you're aware, you're a shit liar, and I know you're lying to me now. I'm not taking offense to it, but I just want you to be aware you're not fooling me."
"They get a little cold after they're born," Natasha said, quiet awe in her voice. "Body heat's best."
. After all, one little drink wouldn't hurt, would it?
Because he didn't want her to go back. He wanted her to stay there, with him. OK, look, he wasn't an idiot, and he knew it wouldn't be easy, but he didn't just
Steve just nodded at him to begin, and Tony shook the bottle, unscrewed the top, and poured a splash in each glass. Steve unfolded one arm and picked the glass up with his hand, sloshing the liquid around to coat the inside lower part of the glass.
his body as much as the other one was, and everything that went along with it was part and parcel of who he was. He had created life out of machines before; now he was creating life out of flesh and blood…with a little help from a certain super soldier, at least.
Steve just smiled at him, knowing full-well that he was full of shit. "DUM-E is a devious little thing that's always looking for a way to cut the wire — like someone else I know."
Mr. Mom. I'm not fucking him. I like Michael Keaton as an actor, but not really my type, if you know what I—"
"Besides," Hill said, and Tony shook his head at what he realized was a private moment he wasn't supposed to have witnessed and turned his attention toward her, "after SHIELD went down, what remained of Hydra fractured into several separate cells. The one that did this might not have had anything to do with the Winter Soldier."
"It is. If it wasn't, you would have denied it." He exhaled a breath and said, "OK, why are you mad about Bucky?"
Bruce shrugged at this, seeming to agree with him, but Thor said, "It is not something that is made. It is something that
the time. 'n' sometimes Unca Rhodey joins 'em, too. 'n' Unca Bucky's there a lot. He didn't go this time 'cuz he's gone somewhere else with Unca Hawky 'n' Mr. Ant-Man 'n' Mrs. Wasp."
"Yeah?" He looked up from where he was petting DUM-E's strut and telling him he would play with him again later.
Did he really just…? Jesus, the stupid gendered things he'd come to accept as 'normal' or 'appropriate.' Fucking societal expectations.
Tony slid his hands down Steve's torso and put his arms around his waist, and resting his head against Steve's pecs now, he turned in the loose embrace and said, "No one said you two had to eat breakfast here."
He stared at her, slightly open-mouthed, and he blinked a couple times before she reached out and touched a finger beneath his chin and gently pushed his mouth closed. She pulled her hand back and shook her head a little.
"Remember? At the board meeting. You said you thought you had some bad sushi or something. And then the next day you were still sick, and I—"
Steve bit back a 'Tony, be careful' because he knew it would be wholly unwelcome, and he instead just twitched at the sound of another
"Uh, how was any of what he did your fault?" Jim asked.
"Did you just call Bruce a 'pothead'?" Tony asked.
She made a face and said an actual, "Blech!" as she stuck her tongue out. "No. I want my Wucky Charms."
place he'd owned or rented in the last five years. It was too…small…and rustic. Barren and staid and kinda ugly, to be honest. Not something he would have designed for himself. Where in the hell was he?
, sweetums. It's just cartoons."
"December," Steve corrected. "Yeah, but they were manful tears," he added, and Tony nudged him.
"Teach it?" he asked and looked at Tony like the idea had never occurred to him.
Instead of glowering some more, Barnes just smiled at him. "Oh, I can't
"Uh, what for?" Tony asked, genuinely confused. "Not only did we agree on 'boy,' but Brucie already inadvertently spilled the beans on it actually
It ended up taking about half-an-hour for Steve to polish up his shoes, his 'not as good a job' being a pretty particular and meticulous endeavor that made his wingtips practically sparkle. They missed the ride with the others, Natasha calling up the stairs that they were leaving now and Tony having to call back down that they weren't ready yet because
He did, and Tony saw not anger staring back at him but thinly-veiled worry, and Tony's defenses fell as he said, "Look, Steve, I didn't—"
Steve wasn't convinced, lips twisted into a scowl, face hard and jaw clenched, but he didn't say anything, just puckered his lips when prompted, and Tony went up on his toes to give him a kiss.
Bruce snapped the gloves off then held up his hands in defense. "I wasn't going to say a word," he said with a laugh.
He averted his gaze, unable to take the pity he saw staring back at him from his oldest friend, and he expected a rebuttal along the lines of what Bruce had given him, but instead, Rhodey just reached out, clamped a solid grip of his shoulder, and said, "You know you're the one that has to explain this to the Captain, right?"
"I can't… I can't."
"Or you two could try behaving like actual adults," Tony suggested.
the point. We can afford it. It's not a frivolous expense for us."
"I meant about the date."
Steve ignored the pet name and motioned at a cabinet beside the large, dual-tub sink. "Glass cabinets?"
He stared at it a moment more before he went back to the one taken at Rockefeller Center, and strangely or perhaps sadly enough, he must have been getting old because the only thing he could think when he looked at this photograph of these two attractive young women with their long legs and mini dresses was, "
"You know," Rhodey was telling Steve, "I expected more from Captain America. Maybe that's on me, but I totally expected more of you. What was all that bullshit about you loving him and not wanting to hurt him? Was that just so you could get with him? Was that just so I wouldn't kick your ass, because I'll tell you right now, I don't care if you are nine hundred years old, I am really restraining myself from kicking the shit out of you right about now."
, the self-professed genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist that had never at any point in the month he'd known him given any thought to the idea of 'children' beyond the fact that they existed in the world, should be allowed that one thing Bruce himself could never, ever have.
"Yeah, I did."
Tony just looked up and met Bruce's gaze. "You know what other idiot does that? Cap. Always looks up at the ceiling when he's talking to JARVIS like he can actually see him up there or something. And this is the man we're trusting our national defense to."
contraceptive precautions because, well, why would I? I figured everything would just go back to normal once I got changed back. And I got changed back for two months before I realized that, yeah, I wasn't just getting older. I actually
Without another word, he let himself out of the workshop and headed in the direction of the elevator, and Steve rolled his eyes and went to follow until he felt a sudden chill hit his body, and he looked down at his naked self, the towel having slipped to the ground during the course of his conversation with Tony. He reached down to pick it up, and he thought about just tossing it on the table and going it
"Mmm…why? What would you do to me? God, I feel so used."
"Wormhole opened up in my lab a week ago," he began and folded his arms.
Bruce just shrugged and went back into the bathroom to clean up his small mess, and Barnes, with Hill's aid in steering, wheeled the bed back over to the bassinette.
He finally met Tony's eyes. "I don't think that's very fair."
Steve just quirked his lips and shoved the bite of cake into Tony's mouth, his fingers brushing against Tony's lips. Tony took the portion on his tongue and closed his lips over Steve's fingertips to get every last crumb and morsel before he fed Steve his, and Steve took Tony's fingers in his mouth and gently sucked off every bit of crumb and icing and sugar and grease that had collected.
Steve rolled his eyes and stifled a groan, but Bucky turned to him and said, "I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times. You two are fucking idiots."
He shook his head. "Nah, it's… Steve said you're good. He trusts you. Thinks you're a fucking genius. Almost get the feeling he thinks you walk on water."
Tony huffed and sighed, and he grabbed his underwear and his shorts and slid them back on. "Yeah, I'm not letting you go down there yourself. It'll be nothing, but you'll still be gone for hours because something
OK, well, maybe he wouldn't go

He frowned, chewing as he watched them load up plates with doughnuts and mugs with coffee and then make like they were heading back toward the living room.
"What do you mean?"
"Yeah, but, you're
Tony arched an eyebrow at him. "Keep it up, William Tell."
you."
"About?"
"Um, maybe I should let you—"
Tony glanced to the side and spotted what he figured had been the temporal disturbance. He couldn't get a good look at the woman, but he saw a red-tinged portal swarming off to the side — oh, god, not now, deep breaths — and over what sounded like an alarm and destruction of some kind, an accented voice spoke a low warning of, "Steven, we don't have much time."
Tony huffed and sighed. "Whatever," he muttered because yeah, OK, he did know that she was listening to everything they were saying, and even if she couldn't repeat it, she would understand what they were saying long before she could exchange conversation with them. He still thought it was a little overkill that Steve had instituted the 'Language!' warning the moment she was born (or practically, anyway), but he supposed he could humor his husband over something like this, though knowing Steve, he'd turn this into some sort of tactical maneuver that would haunt him for the rest of his—
He stared at Steve a moment, seeing the twinkle of challenge in those blue eyes of his, and knowing that deciding between those two names would be as much of a dead end as deciding between 'Sarah' and 'Maria,' he did as Steve suggested, closing his eyes and fanning through the pages before he stopped and pointed to a part of the page at random.
Steve couldn't even get us down there in five minutes!"
So, he let rationality rule the day and just wrote a simple 'pregnant.'
to kill him?
He met her knowing gaze then glanced briefly at Hill, who seemed to know something as well, before he grumbled and stabbed at the food on his plate again.
Tony melted into him at that, sliding his arms around Steve's narrow waist as he fell into the embrace, Steve's tongue in his mouth and his growing interest in the situation pressing into his hip. He moaned a little, suddenly desperate once again to have this man inside of him — he wasn't sure that feeling would ever go away for him — and he broke the kiss and said a soft but choked, "
"Look, it's not— It's not
Tony groaned and pulled away from Steve's plate. "It's
Bruce hit a few buttons on the set and said, "That's why I said he should go to a real doctor, but if you think you're seeing what I think I'm seeing..." He shook his head. "It's not possible. It's just not possible."
people accuse me of having a 'murder face.'" He used finger quotes on the phrase.
They took the offered items and bid the witch 'good night.'
"It's kinda his fault."
Stark whined even more, his eyes still squeezed shut, but Steve just grabbed him by his bound arms and pulled him away from the table, pushing him down to his knees. He took Stark by the chin and tilted his head up toward him, meeting Stark’s big, dark eyes lined with those feathery black lashes. His face was flushed, his eyes a little glassy as he looked up at Steve, his mouth parted slightly and just begging to be wrapped around Steve’s cock, and Steve brushed his thumb over his bottom lip again and assured him, “I don’t have a refractory period. I could do this all day.”
Which, to a New Yorker, was pretty much anything outside the island of Manhattan.
But he wanted Steve there. He wanted Steve there with him so badly. He wasn't afraid to admit — to himself, anyway — that he was scared, that he was terrified, that no matter what Bruce had said about him being blessed by a fertility goddess from space, he'd done the research and he knew there was still every possibility he could hemorrhage or worse. He could die. It may have been the twenty-first century, but childbirth still came with its share of risks, and even in twenty-first century America, women died during childbirth. He could very easily become a statistic, but if Steve was there — at least if Steve was there — then at least he would have that. He would have Steve with him there until the end, and a very selfish part of him wanted to be able to say that — to at least have that, have Steve with him and have Steve by his side right until the very end.
Steve found his gaze locked into Tony's, and like so many times in the past, he found he couldn't look away. Tony was several inches shorter than he, but it was times like this, when Tony's fury reached its boiling point, that Steve felt Tony was more intimidating than even an eight-foot metal murder-bot could ever hope to be.
He met Bruce's gaze, and he rolled his eyes at Bruce's little smile and shook his head.
Steve nodded and got up, and he grabbed the pillow and, instead of just handing it to Tony, worked to adjust the pillow under his arm to give him the most support he could.
"You know, it's weird, but I can kind of feel it already?"
Fuck. No milk. What the hell? Who'd finished it?
Oh, Steve was right in that it wasn't anything
your fault the last time. Didn't you hear what I just said about fondling them? You have kinks, babe, and one of your kinks is to fondle the shit out of my breasts."
Rhodey motioned to him. "See? You're checking him out!"
"Maybe I like it?" Tony mused, practically tickled pink by the knowledge that Steve could hate something so innocuous as a
"She turned you into a woman?"
"Yep. Not a problem. Give me my baby."
outside the walls of the castle had known about that silly and ridiculous — and legally binding — ceremony. How did—
"Yes, I'm sure!" he snapped at her. "I'm a thousand percent sure." He looked down at himself and realized that, true to form, his clothes hadn't changed at all in the transformation. "Oh, that's…" he said and took in the sight of a tight tank top and yoga pants that just…didn't seem to fit his frame the right way any longer. "Guess I don't need the nursing bra anymore, do I?"
(Why couldn't he have woken up there, in that universe, once again? Someplace where, if he wasn't exactly
"Guess not," Steve murmured, and…did he sound…disappointed by that?
Rhodey shot a pointed look at him, eyebrow raised and everything, and Tony sighed was about to push himself to his feet when the table began to buzz. Olivia frowned and sat back a bit as she tried to look for the source of the sound, and Tony grumbled and began to file through the scatter of pictures until he found his phone buried beneath that family portrait Olivia had drawn.
"J," he called out, "remind me to wrap those sometime before next Friday."
"All right," she said, and Tony startled back a fraction.
He motioned back to Steve, who just gave him a look and said, "Tony,
Tony inhaled deeply, and he nodded once and put his helmet back on. Steve went to protest, but Tony switched the voice modulator on so he sounded like his old self again and said, "Get yourselves back to New York."
"You sure? You're not keeping something from me, are you? You're not dying, right?"
"What gets me is that your brother is only an ass in, like, half of these stories — not even," Tony said, a water goblet in his hand.
"I know what it is, Tony."
because
"Because you love us," Natasha said breezily then added, "Why don't you go to bed and get some rest? Got a big day tomorrow. We'll finish cleaning up."
"Thank you, Thor, but that doesn't help us. Tony's—"
"Yeah," he muttered, "that's the word."
"I was talking about you, but your theory sounds a lot more romantic."
days for you and you just didn't realize it," he said and grabbed hold of a machine to help move it aside. Tony followed.
"Jesus,
"What makes you think it's a 'he'?"
He got to the top of the stairs and headed over toward the bedroom, and he was just about to step inside to use the adjoining bathroom when something compelled him to glance to the side, and his gaze caught upon the door of the room next door.
"To who? Bucky? My ma? The world couldn't care less about me back then. And, look, Buck and I were pals, but…as soon as he got married, that woulda been the end of it. Because that's what happened back then. You got married, you settled down, you didn't see your pals as much. I was never going to find someone to settle down with. But Bucky? The girls were always throwing themselves at him. You know, the last night I saw him — the night we went to the Expo and saw Howard's 'flying' car that crashed and burned? — he set me up on a date. It was a double date, and I'm not sure she said two words to me before she was hanging off Bucky's arm. Bucky just had that charm about him that I never had."
"Tony," he said, his voice soft and gentle to avoid spooking him, "we're not… We're not trying to force you to do something you don't want to do."
Steve nodded, taking this into consideration a moment before he said, "Bruce said there were tears."
Steve shrugged but couldn't really think of anything to say to defend himself. Instead, he focused on the tray Tony had set down and nodded his head at it.
Steve just smirked at him, stuck for anything to say, and Tony smirked right back.
"What decision?" Steve asked, sidling up to them. He slipped an arm around Tony's waist and pulled him close and kissed his temple.
Tony merely shrugged. "You told me."
"Nah, I was just thinking. He's not my problem anymore." And then, with absolute delight in his voice, he crowed out, "He's yours!"
"Freaked," Wilson replied.
"We wish to have words with you," he said.
"Women talk to each other in the bathroom. Did you know that? A
A drink. He wasn't thinking about how much he needed another fucking drink.
And then came the weird part with the angel and the chance to see what life had been like if the character had never been born, and Steve glanced over to Tony who, Olivia now sleeping against his chest, murmured, "We watch it every year. The one year the whole team watched it, and for a week, all you could hear around that tower was 'hee haw!'s and 'hot dog!'s."
"Don't mention it," she murmured and put the cup of coffee to her lips.
And then, instead of hitting a sad chord with Barnes, this revelation…made him
Cap just blinked at him, smiling oddly like he wasn't quite sure what to make of what Tony had said. "You know," he said, sounding a little distant, like he was more musing his thoughts aloud rather than having an actual discussion, "everyone has this idea in their minds of who or what I am. Some people think I'm a useless relic. Some think I'm some goody-two-shoes that never did a bad thing or had an impure thought in his life. Some think I'm some great hero to be worshipped or idealized." He shrugged. "I'm not any of that —
"No, you didn't."
He reached around and fastened the collar around Tony's neck, and Tony closed his eyes at the scintillating touch of leather against his throat, those particular muscles of his anatomy clenching once again as Steve finished clasping it. He felt Steve take his wrists and gently pull his arms down to his sides, and after he had, he put his hands on Tony's shoulders and slid them down his arms.
Tony nodded at him. "Like I said, there you go. Toast his memory, light a candle for him if you need to, but don't throw yourself into some overblown mourning. You know he wouldn't want you to do that. You know he'd want you to go on living your life."
"Good," Steve said and brought the hand up to his lips to kiss it. "Now, finish your breakfast," he said and motioned to the food in front of him. "It's getting cold."
Steve glanced at him then pulled up the contact name. "You'd trust Bruce to examine you, but you don't trust him to recommend someone to you?"
She frowned and considered something. "Is he even… Does he even find women attractive that way?"
with you—
Steve frowned at him and hit the button for the elevator. "Don't work yourself too hard."
Which had actually been enough to impress Johann all those years ago. He shivered. There was a memory path best left undisturbed. OK, maybe more had happened with him than he'd been willing to admit even to himself. Look, he…hadn't been in a good place at that time.
Pepper sighed, her shoulders slumping a little, and there was a little less fight in her voice as she said, "Tony, I don't think I can stave them off much longer. They're talking about filing an injunction—"
"'Large' is putting it mildly."
Tony adjusted his bag on his shoulder and followed Bruce over to the quaint street-level gallery, leaving his rose-tinted glasses on as they stepped inside.
sake—
He closed his eyes at that thought. At the mere idea of pushing. At the fact that it might not even happen for days. "Fuck, don't say that."
upon."
forty ounces of coffee in a sitting."
He shook his head to rid himself of those thoughts and went over to the shower. He turned on the water and stuck his hand under the spray, waiting for the ice cold water in the pipes to pass and the warmth to make its way through. After a few moments, the water warmed to a pleasant temperature, and he stepped in and closed the door behind him, steam already enveloping the stall and wafting out into the rest of the room. He stood under the showerhead and let the droplets pummel his face before he turned his back and let the water run through his hair and all over his body, the steam and the warmth of the water enveloping him like a blanket as the water ran in rivulets from the crown of his head down his neck and over his shoulders and breasts to his belly and down his legs. He looked down and watched the water puddle at his feet before it flowed into the drain, and he though he missed Steve and wished Steve were there, it was still nice to—
thinking about it as anything more than a burden and something done to him without any say in the matter.
Other Tony nodded some. "You could say that," he said, slowly, like there was more than one meaning behind it.
are just… There are no words good enough for what you are. You're my best friend, my greatest challenge, and the person I want to spend every lifetime with. I don't think I would have adjusted half as well to the future if it wasn't for you helping to guide me along the way. I… I love you, Tony. You know I love you, right?"
Finger quotes. Barnes used fucking finger quotes on the word 'dating.' Even Steve didn't know how to properly use finger quotes.
He motioned for everyone to calm down, and once they had, he said, "Long story short, I got mixed up with an ancient, cosmic goddess, and, well, got turned into a woman."
"You never know."
"That's fine, Tony," he said.
"Drinking out of the carton of orange juice is bad, but you're perfectly fine with me filling you up with a 'metric ton' of come?"
Steve exhaled a breath and shook his head a little. "What did I say about the language?" he murmured disappointedly to himself.
Steve fixed him with a glare that surprisingly shut him up quick, and he took a sharp inhale of breath through his nose and said, “If that’s the way you feel, you can still walk away—”
Tony rolled his eyes and pulled the baby from his breast. "No," he said and set the baby on his shoulder to burp her. "I want absolutely no help from the father of my child in taking care of her."
"Well," he said good-naturedly, "someday you'll feel differently."
"—I do believe she was distracted by a pair of bondmates in greater need of her services."
made a choice of sorts between them, and though he and Barnes had history, and though he felt he owed it to Barnes to fix what had happened to him, Steve had chosen Tony.
"I mean, you make it sound like you're
"It's fucking
him. The first thing Howard had ever said to him the first time he'd met him — a Thanksgiving holiday break that Steve had opted to spend with Tony's family instead of Bucky's for the first time since his mother had died — Howard had shook his hand, looked him over, and said, "
Tony looked over to the windows beside them. "How bad is it out there really?"
"Are you OK?" he asked, brows drawn together in concern.
"You've only been out twenty minutes — and I'm rounding up on that. You should have been out…a lot longer than that."
Aside from the media constantly picking apart every single thing Tony now did — in a different way than they had in the past; Tony would clearly say this picking was inherently more sexist — life in Avengers tower was, for the most part, a dull exercise going into that summer. Getting Barnes cleared of the charges against the Winter Soldier was slow-going, but according to Pepper, who was told as much from the lawyers, there was a pretty good job of getting it all laid to rest and allowing James Barnes the peace and security he hadn't known for almost seventy years.
Tony furrowed his brow, but Steve was the one that said, "
"A life that you've tied to the bearer of that life."
"I don't think you should be doing that when I'm holding our daughter on my lap. Well,
Steve lifted his arm slightly to peek at Tony. "'Making love' to you is never a chore. Trying to
Tony snorted a laugh. "I'm sorry. Do you see me wearing Birkenstocks and hugging trees?"
"The serum," Bruce said. "I think— I think you have traces or some form of the serum in your blood, probably partially from what I can only assume was a large amount of unprotected sex?"
He clamped his mouth shut and swayed to the rhythm, letting Steve take the lead as he was wont to do. Steve brought his mouth up from Tony's shoulder and pressed another kiss first to his jaw and then to his cheek then rubbed his cheek against Tony's and tightened his embrace just the faintest amount.
Olivia cooed and babbled to herself as Steve pulled the beans out of the cupboard. He closed the door and reached out for the grinder, and he dumped enough beans in to make a strong-enough pot and then ground them up to be relatively fine, taking a glance back at his daughter to see if the loud noise was bothering her. She was staring at the grinder, a confused and somewhat untrustworthy look on her face, and at that moment, the only thing Steve could be bothered to think was, At least she's not deaf.
Sam stared right back and said, "And you're making fun of me?"
Steve's kid, and Steve hadn't exactly been the fussiest of eaters —
Tony could do nothing but clamp his mouth shut.
"I don't know that Steve's actually dead."
"With what?"
now, but still. He was Tony Stark. He was a certified fucking genius. He'd built a fucking suit of armor in a fucking
"I am? Fuck," he muttered. "God, you want to know how bad I'm getting? Steve and I had probably the hottest sex I've ever had in my life last night, and I burst out sobbing afterward. God, it was so good, and I just started blubbering."
"What?" Tony asked him with a grumble. "What are you apologizing for? Unless you think I'm loud and annoying, too."
Steve full-throated laughed at that.
"I don't think that's possible, but go. Get out of here. I'll run these and have the results sent over to Denise."
"Have a plan for everything, don't you?"
He pulled out a large container that looked like a clear synthetic material of some kind. The top to it looked almost rubberized, and Tony pulled that off to display a wide assortment of cookies. He reached in and picked up one that was cut into a shape of some kind with red-colored sugar sprinkled on top of it, and he handed it over to Olivia, who gladly took it and stuck the top part of it into her mouth.
couch, and Tony set the tray down and muttered, "Still think that's bullshit."
"Ya think?"
"Yeah—
Tony reached out and slapped a hand over his mouth. "Steve, stop it. I get that you feel guilty, and I understand that you're sorry, and I appreciate that you'd take this burden on yourself if you could, but you moaning about this isn't helping any. And I know I'm calm now, but that's because Nat makes killer cup of chamomile, and trust me, when the reality of this finally hits me, all the chamomile in the world isn't going to keep me from going insane."
telling him that," Hill said.
Tony barked out a laugh — one mixed with sadness and disbelief — and he shook his head a little and said, "Well, that says it all, doesn't it?"
Steve nodded and dunked another fry in ketchup then stuck it in his mouth. "Yeah, but didn't I see chocolate's supposed to be good for you?"
"Maybe Steve has some art stuff down in his quarters that she could play with?" Bruce suggested. "I'm sure he wouldn't mind."
"That's the attitude you took to proposing, isn't it?" Barton asked and looked at Steve. "Figured
"You cut your hair," he said as Barnes went to make headway into the living room.
Tony snorted a laugh. "Hell, I wasn't even born yet."
"Oh." Tony brightened. "Well, then, I guess we'll just have to see about doing something for lunch then."
"We should try it."
"Even Daddy does. He says it's sack-a-lidges," she said and stuck a piece of waffle in her mouth with her fingers.
"Can't you eyeball it?"
Other Tony made a face. "I don't know if you should call him—"
"I know, babe. I know. But that building was about to come down around all of us—"
Steve chuckled and said, "OK," before leaning in and capturing Tony's lips with his own. Somebody caught them, as he heard somebody say in the periphery, "Hey, you're not supposed to do that unless we do this—" and then there was the sound of flatware tapping against glass, which grew louder and shriller as more glasses were added to the cacophony of sound.
Tony honestly wasn't sure how to characterize Barnes' reaction when he told him that. Relief, he supposed, but tinged with something like remorse or maybe even regret — like maybe he didn't deserve it.
"Of course," he replied, a little more heat in his words this time, and Thor smiled a little and seemed to understand the feeling that was driving Steve's lack of enthusiasm.
Steve swallowed and wouldn't look at him. "That...when you get turned… When you go back to… If you wanted to wear something like this, I wouldn't be against it."
"Yeah, and if I know the Cap like I think I know him, he's going to blame himself for this," Barton said.
"I think… I think it's time. I think it's time we start to let the cat out of the bag."
Basically, Tony couldn't physically hold his own as well against Steve in this form.
Tony could tell he was straining her last nerve, and she was shaking her head, her hands flexing a little as she said, "I'm sorry, are you trying to tell me that
"It is," Tony said with a throaty gasp, Steve's fingers taking a leisurely stroll around the aching nub of his engorged clit. "Oh, god, it is."
—" He jabbed him hard in the sternum. "You of
"No, I do really—"
Tony just blinked at him. "Fast? Fast what?"
Tony had expected cold like last time, but it was surprisingly warm…which didn't do much to set his bladder at ease. He grimaced a little and then grimaced a little more as Bruce set the wand down on his abdomen and moved it around, pressing in either to get some pictures or torture him. He wasn't sure which.
Steve summed up the courage to meet Tony's gaze again and said, "My best friend's dead because of me," and rather than the shock or disgust that he figured would be Tony's reaction, instead, he got understanding.
He turned to Tony, and it was like a light clicked on over his head. His lips parted as realization dawned, and Tony shivered as he saw a little hardness come into Steve's eyes, like he suddenly realized
"What's this?" he asked as he took the glass.
Unsurprisingly, the parasite had nothing to say for itself.
Bruce rubbed his eyes beneath his glasses. "I can't believe I'm asking this, but Tony, when you and Cap…did it…when you were a woman, did you…did you use any contraceptives?"
He stood back, smiling a little, watching as Thor, with Jane and Darcy flanking him, mimed something seemingly surreal and heroic to a clearly unimpressed Rhodey while Pepper and Happy stood with their plates of food and chatted with Natasha. Barnes and Wilson were having some battle of wits — Barnes still decked out in that stupid party hat but seeming to have recovered from his earlier moroseness. Barton stood between them, a plate in hand and a look on his face that Tony knew was the asshole making some comment that would do nothing more than egg him on. Bruce was over at the bar mixing up something for Hill, both of them deep in a discussion about something.
Steve snorted out a laugh that he tried to cover up with a cough, and Tony shot a look at him and said, "Something to contribute?"
"Wow," Tony said, impressed to hell with Steve's effort. "I actually feel a little embarrassed here."
"Um, security breach," he said as Bruce succeeded in pulling her away, which evidently raised DUM-E's concern, as he beeped a little and raised his arm like he was looking out for his
Steve just shot him a pointed look then popped his door open.
He collapsed back on the bed and groaned, pressing the heels of his palms into his eye sockets. "I fucking hate magic," he grumbled.
It was a ridiculously extravagant affair, and the part of him that still remembered cold nights spent with an empty stomach was almost embarrassed by it. Yes, it was nice that Tony apparently had money, but it was also a little disconcerting.
. You're still
So, he worked in silence, running wires between terminals and reading whatever popped up on his computer screen and making adjustments as he saw fit, and after several long, quiet minutes that felt more like an hour but was maybe only around a quarter of that, Barnes swallowed rather audibly and said, "I saw that... I read about Steve and you. A lot. Thought you were a fella?"
"Seriously?" one of the other gallery-goers asked from where he stood with a group beside the 'Scenes from London' panel.
He thought immediately of long, blonde hair and dark eyes; happy chirps and pencil drawings; shield waffles and pizza that was only good for the cheese that came on top of it. He thought about a little body nestled atop of his and a small voice telling him, "
about it because he's sick of you going to him about this stuff and he thinks you need to go to an actual obstetrician about it."
Wilson stared at him a moment and said, "Uh…" before something appeared to come to mind, and he cried, "Oh!" and reached into his pocket to reveal a tacky souvenir keychain.
," he finished, clipped. "I'm sorry, are you trying to imply something, sweetheart? And how would we even prove that, huh? Some private investigator swears an oath to it? You want some investigator poring over pictures of me
"OK, that's bullshit, and everyone knows it. And you, my generously-endowed love, can afford to be, well, magnanimous about it. This fucking putz can't. So, anyway, he's fucking grinding against my thigh, and I finally get him to a point where I think he's nice and interested and, yeah, definitely turned on, and I lean up to him and say, 'I used to be a guy.' He didn't quite hear me at first and asked me to say it again, so I said, 'I used to be a dude.' He, charming fellow that he is, said, 'Not with a rack like that.'"
, especially in my hips. And my breasts, seriously, believe it or not, more comfortable to leave the bra
"Call me 'Steve.' Please."
"And you didn't even attempt to correct the record?"
"I see the passive-aggressive wit is the same."
"I'm just saying," Tony said and followed suit. Of course, where Steve was able to exit the car with ease, Tony had to fight it a bit, and he grumbled and struggled before he was finally able to get himself out of the car. He huffed and straightened out his clothes then shut the door and went over to the trunk where Steve was pulling out their bags. "I'm just saying
Steve just shook his head some but couldn't help the small smile that pulled at his lips.
"Mmm...to a degree, I suppose. You are quite important to them."
He had just finished scraping his plate when he saw Steve still had a good half of his entrée left, and figuring that marriage meant 'share and share alike' — plus the whole being
It was in the way she clambered on top of him without question when they were on the couch, her head on his chest as she asked with the innocence that could only come from youth and the security that came from knowing she was loved and cherished, "Papa, did your daddy go 'way a lot?"
. You're what keeps him sane. You're what gives him a reason to get up in the morning. Like I said, he has the team and he has the mantle of Captain America, but that's not a reason to
"What's wrong?" Steve asked, knowing immediately that something was up. Not necessarily because he was good at deduction but because Tony was making it so obvious.
"I could use the Hulk," he said then looked at Tony, "but you could probably use Bruce here more, especially if we're going to be housing hospital patients for the foreseeable future—"
"Yeah? Well, what are we supposed to do about it, Steve? There's no way to— There's no easy access, which doesn't make any sense, or I guess it does because why would there be easy access? Why didn't this whole thing just go away when I changed back? How in the ever-loving fuck is this my life?"
Steve just stared at him and shoved a bite of the toast into his mouth.
"Yeah, about that 'mother' thing—"
"Well," he said and pushed closer to Steve, pressing his cheek to Steve's and snaking an arm around his waist. He reached out to drag a fingertip down the baby's face. "At the time, I thought you were dead, and it seemed like a good idea. Plus, those dark eyes, I thought— I don't know, I thought
an egg from his own goddamned body. That he would gestate with his own damned body.
if you were to, I don't know,
"You'll know when," he said and dropped his hand away. Tony silently lamented the loss of contact.
"Say, Olivia, you want to—"
But Tony shook his head to wave off his concern and said, "No, no, it's— It doesn't matter." He got hold of himself and looked at Steve. "OK, yeah, so, next time you want to surprise me, try not to give me a heart attack, huh?"
"Hey! Hey, Cap. Babe. Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it," he soothed. He honestly didn't blame Steve for this. OK, maybe a little part of him did, but only because Steve had been the one to, well,
Tony rolled his eyes and groaned a little as the host conceded that was a good question that deserved an answer, and he shook his head and went back to eating his sandwich as the host moved onto some fluff piece about a wildlife reserve, and he swiped off the feed and scanned over some stock prices and read over a reminder that he had promised Pepper some new specs for energy projects, and he sighed and finished off his sandwich and his juice — Jesus, Steve really had domesticated him, hadn't he? — and headed in the direction of his lab to lose himself in some of his projects.
Both their eyes went wide as they realized they'd been caught, and they quickly averted, both looking in different directions. Tony shook his head and went back to his phone, which buzzed with a new message.
"Side effects?" Steve asked with an arched brow.
"Oh," he said brightly, happily, and maybe even a little too eagerly, "this should be fun." But Steve, that wonderful killjoy, just sighed and said a disappointed, "
"We weren't. We were kidding ourselves. We're better off as friends, and who in their right mind would want to get saddled with me the rest of their life, anyway?"
by his high chancellor. There were some that had suspected, when the King was young, that the rather soft features of his face proved that he was a female his father had dressed up in disguise. His enjoyment at being
Forget the 'almost.' He did. God help him, he hated this man. He hated him for what he wasn't and what he had never pretended to be. He hated him for not being what Steve had wanted and hoped him to be the moment he'd seen the name, never mind the photograph, in the file. Waking up in the future — being pulled from his grave (God, please, let him go back there) — was bad enough, but he thought there'd been a slight glimmer of hope the moment he'd come to terms with the fact that he was nearly seventy years in the future. He still remembered what that Tony — his Tony (no,
OK, maybe there'd been a bit more of that dominance stuff in their relationship than he'd allowed himself to admit at the time.
"Don't you wear heels? What about those dress shoes you wear?" Steve called after him.
He shook his head. "Nothing."
him to look at me like that, but just the fact that he didn't even have to think about it. Fuck, talk about an insult."
"Huh," he said but left it at that.
"OK, so what's your point?"
that ailed him.
"I'm kind of curious how I'll do, to be honest. I mean, yeah, some women scream their heads off, and then others are really, really quiet. I think I might spend the entire time telling Steve how much I hate him."
"What for?"
He tapped at the arc reactor, but he didn't know if he did it intentionally or not.
Slouched down in the chair, Barnes rolled his head around to face Tony, and he smirked at him, face still a nice shade of pink from his laughing fit, and said, "Look, you don't need to get graphic or anything. Just a simple 'yes' or 'no' is good enough."
"I was sick," he said simply.
"Or until they kill everyone else."
," he grumbled but left it at that.
"Mmm...I'll keep that in mind," Tony practically purred as he melted into Steve's embrace, and Steve gladly held him there, tightening his arms and running his hands over Tony's back.
"Yeah," Tony said and swallowed.
Steve, but just the fact that even now, he could still get Steve with nary a question asked—
Bruce pressed down onto his abdomen with the wand, and yeah, it did feel a little funny, especially as he moved it around, his concentration — and confusion, if he was being honest — splayed over his face. He went about this for several minutes before he began to look from the screen down to Tony's abdomen and back to the screen again.
"No, I get that. I do. You did what you thought you had to do. You thought you were doing the right thing— He didn't fight you
Bagel in hand, he turned the tablet display on and began to swipe over the screens, pulling up the news and stock feeds and going over the headlines for the day. With a resigned sigh, Steve turned and grabbed a mug from the cabinet, and he filled it with a serving of Tony's liquid savior and set the coffee down beside the plate with the bagel on it. Then, leaning slightly over Tony, he reached out and, hesitating for only a moment, put his hand over the small swell of Tony's belly, somehow equal parts possessive and protective. He leaned in and captured Tony's mouth with his own, pressing a gentle, tender, and loving kiss to his lips as he rubbed the bump. He broke the kiss just as it began to get a little too heated, and he pressed his cheek to Tony's and whispered in his ear, "Nothing will be so long as I'm here."
"Tony, you're making him feel bad!" Steve said before he turned to DUM-E and began to pet him. "He doesn't meant it. Honest. You know how he gets sometimes."
set in my ways."
The first Council member to speak stepped back, and another member stepped forward.
He wasn't sure how long he lay there before someone hit the manual release on the faceplate, and he squinted at the bright assault of sunlight to his eyes before Barton's shit-eating grin came into view.
He shook his head and led the car out of the tunnel and onto Manhattan city streets. He bore to the left for Midtown and followed the roads back to the Tower.
" Steve murmured, more to himself than to Tony or Rhodey, and Rhodey shook off his concern and said, "Don't worry about it. Tones's pop culture references are just forty years out of date."
Tony watched him make his way over to the elevator, and not until Steve was on it and the doors were closed behind him did he exhale the breath he'd been holding and lean over the worktable, head in his hands.
that could be
"Hey," Bruce said, "I would have brought along more if I thought they'd be interested."
Tony, to be part of what Tony was doing to himself.
Rhodey shared a look with the rest of the table — save Steve, for some reason — then shook his head and picked up his drink.
"Did she just call you 'Daddy'?"
Tony smacked his shoulder. "Don't say that. Don't you ever say that. You were worth the world to—"
He took the pressure off his hand and looked at how the blood had soaked through the gauze. He scowled and got up to get another wrap, and he had just put the second one on when Bruce came back with the swab.
Steve nodded his understanding then looked back down and brushed his lips over Olivia's tiny fist. He stared at her, and Tony could tell there was some sort of understanding being had between father and daughter before Steve laughed a little and said, "You shouldn't even exist." When Tony peered a little closer, he saw the tangible evidence of teardrops streaming down Steve's cheeks.
work. You'll have JARVIS mock something up and send it over."
"There!" he cried, startling the others out of their assorted conversations. "There. You feel it?"
overdo it. Please. I don't need—" He shook his head some. "I don't need anything like that."
Steve nodded and, without a word of protest, pushed away from the table and got out of his seat. He dropped his napkin to the side of his plate then helped Tony out of his chair. Then, instead of leading Tony quietly and discreetly out of the ballroom, he instead went over to Natasha and said, "Did you get it?"
With a snuffle, Tony looked up at him, silent, the dim streetlight bouncing off of Tony's dark eyes.
Is it regular? How long does it last? Uh…wait, wasn't it the same for all women? Currently sexually active?
"But I'm just saying," Bruce continued in his normal logical and even way. "Doctors like to encourage vaginal deliveries. They really only like to do cesareans if they absolutely have to."
He opened his eyes again to look back at Thor, and he stared straight at him and tweaked a small smile he didn't feel and said a somewhat deflated, "Thanks."
or did they move onto something else?"
Natasha patted his arm. "You're whatever you want to be, honey. We'll support you no matter what."
"It…looks fantastic on you, Tony," Pepper said, humor and levity filling her voice.
. I still don't know what mine was."
"He changed back to being our Tony once he had conceived as female Tony."
But something was
He supposed she got that from whoever the mother happened to be. A surrogate, most likely, though why he or Cap — Jesus Christ, how in the hell did that
He looked up from addressing his belly to just in time to meet Steve's pointed, knowing look.
"No, you're right, sweet pea. War Machine is totally awesome. I mean, not as awesome as Iron Man, but still awesome. Mostly. I mean, nobody ever asks for a
"I'm sure it won't," Steve said and pecked his lips again before he loosened his grip and made headway in the direction of the elevator. "Gonna go run through some trials with Thor. Want to watch?"
Steve was silent a moment before he reached out and brushed his fingertips over Tony's arm. This time, Tony let him.
He frowned at him. "Tony, I already told you how I—"

"Yeah, whatever," he said and whipped his shirt off. Pepper went to avert her gaze to offer him some amount of privacy, but he rolled his eyes and said, "Don't bother. It's fine," and he stood up to try and better get the right leverage he needed to put the stupid thing on.
Completely pretending that that morning's breakfast had never happened, Tony took a gulp of coffee and said, "Why do I feel like we've had this conversation before? And why do I feel like I've already told you I'm not a fucking hippy. I'm not eating your crunchy granola crap."
references, J. Open the damned doors. There are literally three Avengers, one formerly-brainwashed Hydra agent, and an ex-SHIELD agent on-site. How many potential Hydra-lites do we have here?"
Tony just looked over at his best and oldest friend, Hill biting her lips and trying to hide her amusement in the periphery, but Rhodey just shrugged and said, "It's true."
"I didn't
"I know," Steve said and cradled him close. He brushed his lips against Tony's head. "I'm proud of you, Tony. I'm so proud of you. And amazed by you. I couldn't do it, and just the fact that you are — and how well you are — that's nothing short of amazing."
"Guess we'll never know," Steve said with a lazy shrug.
Natasha Carbonell," the woman said, her phone at the ready.
"Yeah, I don't think that's the word you want there," Jim said as he folded his arms and tried to
He was counting on Tony forgetting about that by next year.
Now, a child from the future that desired nothing but love and affection from him didn't seem so bad. OK, there was still the little matter of who 'Daddy' was, and that…that was a little harder to compute. He actually had been full of shit when he'd been talking to Bruce before. He didn't actually think the Cap was that way. Cap was too perfect, too righteous, too all-American to be anything but a God-fearing heterosexual from the '40s. So, maybe this
," she said before she said her goodbyes and hung up.
"Because it's her first Christmas, Steve!"
"Yeah," Steve said, sounding none-too-pleased about it.
Tony made a face. "Eh, not really feeling the 'Nate,' and, well…" He grimaced a little, hesitating before he said, "I don't know, maybe I'd like… Maybe I wouldn't be
"Hmm?" he asked and turned back.
"Don't they have pills now that you can take? You know, to
"You know, Stark," Barton said and stabbed at some of the scrambled eggs on his plate, "if you're not careful, one of these days we're going to stop coming here."
. I hadn't met you yet."
Steve to do so — and was in through a door between the bureau and the large rectangular thing on the wall. Lights clicked on, and Steve saw it was a bathroom. The door closed and water began to run, and as the odd man busied himself in the room, Steve put a hand up to his mouth, the pads of his fingers resting against where his lips still tingled from the contact of the other man's mouth against his. He would be lying if he said that the slight scratch of facial hair against his skin hadn't in any way been enticing.
Bruce's shoulders slumped a bit like that was the answer he hadn't been hoping for, and he said, "I don't actually have one, Tony. I'd have to call in a favor to get one here."
Tony licked off the tines of the fork to get as much of the chocolate goodness as he could. "Uh," he said, pulling the fork away from his mouth but not setting it down, "I'm pregnant, and not only am I pregnant, but I'm pregnant with
Now it seemed natural to let Steve take the lead and do what he asks, the urge to please his Alpha overriding all his previous insecurities at being perceived as less of a man for wanting to be dominated and taken by his partner.
Tony was not looking forward to that examination at all, he had tried to convince Steve it was not necessary as it was too soon to really tell.  Steve had just looked down at him shaking his head and informed him in that smug Alpha way that it was not for him decide and that he knew his omega’s body better that him. After all what would Tony know as he was such a poor example of an omega and had never really taken any time to study his own omega biology.
Steve gladly handed over a very ripe smelling baby, it would be even more humiliating for Tony for someone else to see that he had lost control of his bowels and soiled himself.  Pepper probably wanted to discuss their plans for the up coming weekend, he was looking forward to her reaction to the new and improved Tony Stark Rogers.
Steve addressed the crowd,
It took less than five minutes for the laser to denude the omega of his facial hair, Jarvis even shaped his eyebrows into a more feminine arch whilst leaving them looking natural and full.
“It will be interesting to see how much this has healed by tomorrow, it will l assume give you a clear indicator of the strength of Extremis with in her.”
“Sir you must hurry my firewalls have been breached I am unable to stop whoever is hacking my systems, please get to the panic room before the power goes off!  My override codes to allow you out of the workshop have been blocked, I estimate the intruders will gain access to you workshop within the next ten minutes, Sir! Plea   pleee…..”
Tony watched in horror as the cutting edge nano-technology he had developed to use with his Iron Man armour spread over his hands, curling his fingers in to his palms, immobilising and encasing them completely.  The bands round his knees tightened and once his Alphas lowered him onto his hands and knees he realised that his knees would be cushioned by the nanobots making it less arduous to crawl.
“Shhhh.. just do as you are told, you will soon be spending plenty of time on you knees, but for now open those pretty little lips and bite down, if you spit it out we will just have to start the five minutes all over again.”
Breakfast is silent, Steve likes to read the news paper as he eats.  Tony quickly eats his blueberry pancakes helping himself to the thick cream in the small bowl, set out just for him, he now knows why some of Steve’s home cooking has such a unique flavour.  He also accepts that he never really stood a chance against Steve’s plan to turn him into his omega, for a genius he has been incredibly stupid and oblivious.
Captain America was a national icon and and American hero he could not be associated with such corruption any more, he would need to atone for his mistake in allowing Bucky to carry on acting in such a depraved way.  There would be no more grey area in his morals, only black and white, right and wrong.
Good bitch, now sit on her face and gag her mewling, continue to work on her nipples, I will stretch her clit and attach it to the second ring.”
Never used products in her hair either, just that same horrid chignon full of pins, or left it hanging loose like a dam Hippy!”
Steve thought about it for a moment;
“Tony, the Court Judges have over-ruled all legal decisions made since you were de-aged.  They have declared that as an Omega you did not have the legal right to approach the Courts without Alpha and Pack representation, therefore all legal decisions regarding your person since the de-aging have been overturned.  We are fortunate that they decided that due to the extreme nature of Howard and the doctor’s abuse, and the mental and physical damage caused to you, it would not be advisable for your mental health to go back further and review all legal decisions ever made both personal and professional with regards to yourself and Stark Industries.”
teve was laughing at him, which was strange because usually he was all serious and growly, which was fucking hot and usually made his holes clench and leak slick, much to his consternation.  Being bonded was not a choice he would have made for himself but he could admit that the physical side of mating played into all his kinks.  The loss of his freedom was a bitter pill to swallow and he didn’t know if he would ever be able to forgive Pepper for her part in arranging it and keeping it secret from him.
Tony swayed as he tried to look up at his Alpha.  Oops, Winter had angry, worried face, which meant he needed to get his face to turn into worried, concerned face to avoid any punishment, and he needed to do it quick before Steve became aware of his reckless behaviour.
Winter couldn’t hold back his snort of laughter at Steve’s words.
Bruce ensured that Tony was secured to the bench, all three of his holes filled with thick long phalluses. He had already instructed Jarvis to monitor the omega and vary the tempo of the machine.
Steve watched in dismay as Tony walked forward, he was completely naked apart from a thick leather collar around his neck, he could see the brands on his hands and the mating bite showing just below the collar.  He was smaller and younger looking, his body soft and rounded, but he just felt that he was their Tony.  He couldn’t help but stare at his small breasts and his obviously pregnant stomach, what shocked and horrified him the most was the smooth area of skin between his legs as he walked closer. Tony’s cock and balls were completely gone, there was only a tiny, raised bump where the root of his cock should have been.
“Jarvis have her taken to the kennels, Natasha wants her locked up separately for now so that the hounds can get used to her scent.
Steve couldn’t believe that the Howard he had know had turned in to such a cold, hearted monster, who would do such a thing to their own child, and why had Maria not done anything to stop him.  He wished Howard was alive so that he could punch his lights out for abusing his son in such a horrible fashion.
He grinned at the startled and hesitant guard, but the telltale bulge in his pants told him that he was obviously turned on.
Winter rubbed the soft spot on Tony’s neck to calm the agitated omega, Steve cupped his face, making Tony look up at him.
Thor could feel his length thickening as he gazed at Loki’s throbbing clit glistening with juices, the ringed cunt lips already looking larger, the weight and tightness of the rings forcing them downward.
Chapter 28
“Come on Pepper, time to visit the salon before your next therapy session, sex dolls need a beauty routine the is quick and easy, can’t arrive at the next business meeting with leftover cum on your face or in your hair.
When Steve’s fingers open him up ready to take his cock he mewls and whines, his own cock weeping pre cum.  He cries out as Steve’s huge member splits him in half, his heavy balls slapping against his butt, each hard, thrust hits his prostrate and he sees stars. He knows he will have bruises on his hips and wrists from being held down, but one look from Steve and any protest dies on his lips. He screams out his climax as Steve’s knot fills his channel with cum, he can feel it his muscles massaging every, last drop of cum from the knot, his body shaking apart as he comes again.
Steve tucked his dick back in his trousers before helping Pepper off the desk, even with one nipple exposed and cum running down her stocking clad thighs she was still an intimidating sight.  Steve and Pepper both preferred more submissive partners and if not for the need to provide an heir for the company he and Pepper would never have indulged in a physical relationship.   Tony had agreed to the need for an heir but did not want to father a child himself, to scared that any child of his blood would inherit all his bad genes.  Pepper had agreed to be a surrogate on the condition that she raised the child as she saw fit, Steve had no interest in raising a baby.  The only one he wanted was his Tony once his Conditioning Treatment made him more amenable to the kind of behaviour that he expected from his baby boy.
Raider was the Alpha hound and took his turn first with each of the bitches, he would talk turns breading each bitch then leave the others to Zeus and Brutus. Any new hound that was introduced was swiftly dealt with and it was only once Apollo was introduced that he allowed another hound to join the pack to widen the gene pool.
The steel bands of Steve’s arms held him still as Steve stood and walked them over to the full-length mirror.  Tony gasped as he saw his reflection, the clear bulge of Steve’s cock underneath his skin, his stomach soft and bulging with cum.  He was dwarfed by Steve’s body, his feet dangling many inches away from the floor.
He thought for a moment he had played his hand to soon, as Steve’s face flushed with anger but then settled into an annoyed frown.  When he slipped off his sweat- pants and climbed over Tony’s head he knew it would be fine.
Steve massaged Pepper’s tense shoulders, his hands wondering down to undo the buttons of her silk blouse, cupping her lace covered breasts as he kisses her upturned face. His fingers push down on each nipple before, pinching and tugging them until they are hard nubs, Peppers breathy moans loud in the quiet office.
Hulk discarded the fluffy pink towel once he was sure his Daisy Cow was completely dry his large fingers stroked the soft skin massaging in the buttermilk oil until her skin glistened.  He purposely left her enormous udders untouched.
Thor swung his hammer disappearing in to the sky amid the crack of thunder and lightning.
Everything seemed to be in hand on the Pepper front, so he left them to it.  He wanted to spend some time with his sweet boy, it had been a while since he had him hanging off his knot.
“Yes, I’m sorry Nurse Meyer.”  He mumbled quietly staring down into his lap.
“Soon omega, now l want you to look at the data Bruce has gathered on the Extremis in Ms Potts, and Stark’s research notes.  You have until my knot goes down to earn your orgasm.”
“How long would this take to put in place? an age of five to seven would be ideal.  I Can just imagine how mortified he would be if at the Maria Stark Gala if I aged him down.  If it can be accomplished by Tuesday go ahead with the treatment.  I think it would be an acceptable alternative for the rest of the Avengers who may not appreciate my darling baby boy but also don’t want to deal with adult Tony.”
Will you order the appropriate omega food for him and bring it along with the meal plan up to the penthouse this afternoon?”
Tony’s surprised mewl of pleasure was followed by an embarrassed gasp when he realised, he had come so quickly. Then Steve’s fingers started rubbing his soft cock over and over until once again he was coming, gasping for breath as Steve nail grazed his piss slit before once again rubbing his overly tender cock.
****************************************************************
Tony tried not to cry as Sir slammed his hand down repeatedly on his naked backside, in front of all his business associates.  Men who previously would have been dealing with himself and Pepper.  He could feel another orgasm building when Sit’s hand began to target his his exposed hole, sending the plug deeper to hit his prostrate with each smack.
Steve gripped their omega tight as he tried to fight against the limbs holding him away from Loki’s milk.  Deciding a distraction was needed he pulled out his cock and impaled Tony on it, grabbing his waist he moved the mewling omega up and down, his soaked cunt easily accommodating his length.  His knot began to swell as he thrust deeper and deeper, his omega’s pussy lip stretched obscenely wide as he forced his fully formed knot in, uncaring that Tony was now screaming and begging for him to stop.
“Stay right where you are, I haven’t finished with you yet.
His gaze turned next to the small tattoo on his inner left thigh, the red white and blue image of Captain America’s shield reflected back at him.  He knew that if his wrists had not been bound in thick leather cuffs matching ones would show on each wrists pulse point.
If you are wondering why l don’t just let you voluntarily step down into Beta position, the reason is that l want to show my complete dominance and ownership of Stark Industries. Stark Industry employees know me as Captain America and see me as the ultimate Battle Pack Commander, they need to be certain that l am able to command respect and exert my power over any would be challenger to my position as owner of this Company.”
