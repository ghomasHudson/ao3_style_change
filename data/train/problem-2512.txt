The anaesthesia call room is in the same hall as those reserved for surgeons. On a whim, John goes to knock quietly on the door of the room reserved for the neurosurgical consultant.
"We've both needed some lessons in that. And you have talked to me when you've needed to."
", Joanna had told him on the phone.
"I needed to find out whether you’d be taken to the recovery room or directly to the ITU," Sherlock reminds him. "Where else was I going to go?"
that?! He's got a career better than anybody else's at King's, one that makes mine look like a failure, and he thinks he's–– he–– He's the most self-absorbed man in London, that's what he is, not a fraud!" John is pointing at the floor, his left palm on his hip. "
Usually, when people get involved with others, it adds things to their lives. With Victor, Sherlock had felt
"I've had a few of those. I can tell the difference," I tell him tiredly as I cross the expanse of my —
You want to punch him, shove everyone out of the room so that you can be the one to make the such promises, because it’s unbearable that you can’t be the one to fix this. You’re a surgeon of the wrong kind, invalided home, and you hate the universe right now with the determination of a small child, even if by robbing you of your career it also gave you Sherlock Holmes.
cases. If you were a liability and a danger to people, there would be more.
"People who aren't surgeons are useless. They don't have any answers."
After taking a seat again next to Sherlock, whose arm is now supported by a rolled-up towel on another fresh towel, John injects the edges of the wound with lidocaine. He doesn't wait long for it to take effect before he starts cleaning the wound with saline-soaked wads of gauze.
What Marsh says about risk factors for accidental awareness during general anaesthesia holds water. It does still happen, but very very rarely since we can now use EEG-based sleep depth monitoring, anaesthesia drugs and techniques have evolved, and muscle relaxants are not needed for all surgeries any more since we can use a laryngeal mask airway instead of intubation in many cases. But, for certain kinds of operations such as emergency c-sections and cardiac surgery, there is a risk that needs to be acknowledged and appropriate assessment and support provided for patients to whom it has happened. It should be reassuring that, while accidental awareness is very rare, even rarer is the worst subtype: being awake and feeling immense pain and fear during the experience. Many patients who believe they've been accidentally aware have actually had an operation under a nerve block + sedation, during which it's entirely normal to keep dozing off and then returning to even full awareness. Preventing patients getting the wrong idea and being alarmed afterwards requires meticulous explanations from the anaesthesia team beforehand on what is to be expected. When talking about sedation with patients, I never use the word 'sleep', for instance, to avoid that sort of confusion. There are also patients who falsely believe they've experienced accidental awareness even though their hazy memories are just from anaesthesia induction and/or being allowed to emerge once the surgery is over. More on accidental awareness later as Marsh comes to visit Sherlock.
You wonder if that also includes him. Mycroft seems to have made himself less involved than he usually is when Sherlock ends up in the hospital or in trouble; you wonder if he is consciously making room for you, and whether you should read something into it. It's probably just because Sherlock has signalled that he wants you here. Or does he? The signs have been few and far between. Mycroft seems to think differently, though, but then again, he's had over thirty years to learn how to interpret the strange creature that is his brother.
— sex, but they should have eased into it slower. He should have told John he needs less before he can want more.

"If you insist on getting involved with people––"
"That's why you don't have to keep stacking unfair expectations on yourself."
"I don't know if this is the best time to visit."
"His love for you does not need to be repaid with tolerance for behaviours which hurt you. I would say that your relationship with him is on steady ground in general, but during times of stress and when he needs you but you also need his support, my impression is that you cannot ask for what you need because certain past experiences are preventing you from feeling entitled to that support."
"Good luck, then, with business."
"Because you hate room service?" This is one dislike the logic of which John has yet to understand. For now, it's filed under 'Sherlock being
"Leaving him alone seems to be precisely what Sherlock is after. It doesn't seem like he wants anything to do with me."
"We'll talk tomorrow," Greg says after the silence at John's end stretches uncomfortable.
“If you could have a look at the draft, we’d be grateful. Structuring the thing is a challenge.”
"I would ask if there was a miscarriage, if you hadn't already explained about your difficult circumstances," Doctor Pichler says, her tone soft as she is leaning slightly forward. "You came to a decision to terminate the pregnancy?"
Sherlock's hands have disappeared under the table. He's blinking, eyes fixed on nothing, and breathing hard.
Somehow, as always, he can predict your words before they're formed. "Wait," he says, voice guttural and low and harsh as he rides the ache.
"John gave Dr Hooper permission to debrief me about their sessions before I saw him for a consultation, so I am also familiar with his family history. I assume you know that John experienced severely abusive behaviour from his father for much of his childhood."
Mrs Hudson looks momentarily confused, then seems to decide to ignore what Sherlock might be referring to about the past. "Everyone avoids things. I've my hip, and it's been ripe for a replacement for over five years, but I just… I know it would be better, but most days I just think that I'll manage, because going through the whole thing, surgery and hospital and all, that would just be so
You purse your lips. Sherlock has never really pushed her away, never declined her support for anything. You have a hunch she's the one he talks to about things, not you or his parents. Maybe this'll do Sherlock some good, and Mrs Hudson has certainly proven that she was weather even his foulest moods with grace.
. How can he
"Why?" I press him. Challenge him. Test how badly he really suspects things are off-kilter.
He circles to the opposite side and painstakingly, side-first with his arm muscles bearing the brunt of the work, lowers himself onto his side. You turn on the lamp on the bedside cabinet on the opposite side and grab whatever book is at the top of the one of the piles on the floor. It's on the history of London, and it'll have to do.
He nods, accepting if not your false promise then at least your motive for the transgression.
trust Collings to know what we should do, right?”
John gives Sherlock's right hand a gentle pat where it has curled around the water glass. "You tell me."
A pair of piercing, green-blue eyes locks onto John's. "Does it matter?"
"He promised cold case files."
This series features the exciting medical and romantic adventures of doctors Watson (senior neuroanaesthetist and director of operative services) and Holmes (consulting neurosurgeon) as they navigate their careers and their relationship.
John goes to his chair behind the desk and start typing up an MRI request. "We can do the imaging right now, if you want."
They haven't had any after Sherlock got sick, of course, and since it's slightly awkward to have a wank when your partner can
"You are who you are, and this is hard. It's hard for me, too. For most people, I think," John muses chewing his bottom lip. He’s moved back over to the other side of the couch and Sherlock misses his steady warmth. "But don't ever think I can't see how hard you try all the time. And that's the whole point. Most of the time I can't even understand how I could be worth all that effort, but then I realise I just need to accept that for you, I am. We don't just make each other better people, Sherlock — we make each other want to try to
John shrugs. If this man can tell everything about him just by looking at him, there's no keeping secrets, is there? "The patients I have expect a certain level of service from me, a service they can't get from public healthcare. Going above and beyond what people expect is, well, what they
"The tourist shop, but it's just cardigans and jumpers and socks and such." John glances at Sherlock's trousers. "Best get something you don't mind getting wet and dirty before we take on any repairs at your place."
Sherlock had asked him on Malta. He had seemed so frustrated even before hearing John's answer. Sherlock always seemed to assume that the things he wanted or didn't want would require others to make big compromises on his behalf.
"Thought I'd show it to you before I packed it away."
John rises, goes to the chair and gives the scabbard a good wiping with a well-wrung damp cloth that had been sitting on the bedside cabinet. "There's a meet-and-greet with cadets graduating this Spring, a lecture the topic of which eludes me right now, a tour of the re-opened museum and then a dinner in the Old College function rooms after a few hours' break. Sunday is for class reunions, and the whole thing ends early so people coming from far away have time to get home."
Not that the patient's name, profession, the name of their spouse or the breed of their dog matters when they're on the operating table. What does matter is that the surgeon has studied, down to the smallest detail, the anatomy and pathology of the surgically treatable problem. Upon conversing with John Sherlock has learned that his spouse seems to think that pointless trivia about patients' lives makes for better healthcare. Sherlock finds this difference in perspective understandable since anaesthetists need to put their patients at ease before putting them to sleep and remembering their name may play into that. It should also be easy for the anaesthetist to remember it since the patient is asked to recite it as the first part of the first section of the checklist that's done before starting anaesthesia.
"Not really. Just… it kind of stretches something back there," John croaks and grimaces.
Out in the distance, on the relentlessly rolling grey waves, the outline of an RIB appears. He shifts his balance, a knot forming in his stomach.
John can't say that he had enjoyed it — it was too modern and dissonant and… strange and conflicted for his taste, but it wasn't chosen for its melodic pleasantness. No, it was chosen because that's what Sherlock had felt like playing right now.
"It got bad
Yet I was caught in the current that takes me towards where mine ends. I
, but he still leaves no room for anyone else besides the two of you. You've committed yourself to someone without even realising — you, who's always felt the compulsion to run when you felt you were being ensnared into something by a partner who clearly feels more for you than you for them. Is it because you know he senses it, too? With Sherlock, there's no way to be certain. He may not read people well or at all, but he's taken off his armour for you, relied on you, bared his soul for you, sought your attention and your affection and you've seen him,
"Yeah," John yawns, shivering a bit as he starts down the draughty staircase. "I'm sure you know what to do."
"Nope," you say, "you don't want mediastinitis on top of everything because you couldn't keep your grubby paws off the incision. Can we try that question again? Do you remember where you are?"
He doesn't want
. Though this one is ornamental, it still carries the key design features which had made it a formidable weapon.
"Sorry," Victor chuckled. "The interest of the realm and all."
"I'll talk to the family first," he insists.
Sherlock mutters something indignant when John climbs back into bed behind him. In a little over an hour, they should be headed home.
"Precisely, Mister Holmes. If they can prove that the system — and you as the representative of the system — deprived Sylvie Fairholme of treatment which led to her death and motivated Mr Fairholme to demand answers by demanding them at gunpoint, that jury just might be inclined to feel sympathy for him. Even better if they can make this about just the two of you: a callous surgeon and a grieving spouse."
It's tempting to let someone take the fall, especially since this wouldn't be the first time an erroneous radiology report led to a surgical mistake. But that's not what happened, and Sherlock doesn't want to add being a liar to his tally of failures today.
"Can we just what?"
to people about what happened. This throws Sherlock off kilter.
Clearly, your gift is not well-received. "What's wrong with it?"
"Oh, but I do. And you make the mistake of assuming that those who you have loved also knew you in a way that would have allowed them to realise the depth of your fall."
"I have not used in two years," Sherlock tells them. "Not that you think anything that a single word that comes out a junkie's mouth is honest."
"I don't want you to be alone. I don't want to be alone," John tells me as his weight settles behind me. The big spoon and the little spoon. Sentiment.

. Victor always wanted takeout, which Sherlock ordered on most days, anyway. It's odd how this sudden and unfamiliar domesticity of being cooked a meal consumed pleasant company is making him anxious about having to let go of this moment soon. He's done nothing of note since arriving here, nothing he would consider worthy of his time in London. All he's done is interact with two odd islanders and learn about the wildlife. Why does that make him feel more invigorated than a week's worth of interesting NSY cases?
He shares an office with another surgeon, a lower gastrointestinal system specialist. They don't talk much, so his presence is usually not an obstruction to Sherlock's concentration, but now he grits his teeth when he finds the man sitting at the window desk. They exchange courteous hellos and Sherlock slumps into his chair, wondering if he could commission a partition to hide his colleague from view. What does he think about Sherlock? The man has never voiced his opinions, and Sherlock is almost certain he has never insulted or bothered the colleague in any way. Almost.
Once they're standing outside and Sherlock has stepped to the edge of the kerb to hail a cab, John digs out his phone and checks the GMC Fitness to Practise Guidelines. He sighs.
––" Sherlock starts arguing as expected, but then coughs and gasps, eyes pinching shut. A trickle of blood runs down the inside of one of the drains — not an alarming amount and probably caused by the coughing raising intrathoracic pressure, but it's still blood. When Sherlock opens his eyes again, he's left staring at the drain, alarmed.
“What’s up? This about John’s birthday?” Harry asks.
She asks if the two of you have been together long. You don't really worry that your visiting rights to the ITU would be rescinded if you turned out to not be a romantic partner, but you still don't correct her. In fact, the assumption is convenient because it means you feel that you don't have to explain any of your behaviour around him. Not even Mycroft has ever batted an eyelid at any of it — after all, he was the one who insinuated your and Sherlock's nuptials were imminent upon your first meeting. That's why you assumed Sherlock was gay; why would his brother have joked so casually about such a thing if it wasn't true?

"Because we are to
"Paracetamol's on the list regularly as well as a slow-release oxycodone, and once your coagulation panel is normal, we can put you on ibuprofen or naproxen since you don't seem to have any contraindications," Emma explains, directing her words to Sherlock. The nurses in the unit seem well-trained in not ignoring their patients when discussing their cases, even though many of them are sedated and on the vent. As alien and dehumanising an environment as an intensive ward should be, you find the staff's good attitude a potent antidote to it.
The door opens, slower than usual, as though the arrivals are reluctant to bring in their news. George is first to enter, and one glance at the man's face tells John all he needs to know. Further confirmation comes when he sees that Sherlock's eyes are red and the arms of both men are empty.
“That's a pretty casual dress code for a rep. What would a rep even be doing skulking around these parts?”
"Not really," Sherlock replies.
John is mouthing words at him again. These soundless proclamations of his love are getting a tad embarrassing.
"Because you can do all of it instinctively!"
Emma purses her lips. "Who did you say you were? I can't remember you."
Some readers have told me they sometimes forget that Sherlock Holmes is not canonically a neurosurgeon. I couldn't imagine a greater compliment.
John continues, "I realised eventually that you don't need to understand why I joined; I'm the one who has to make my peace with that. You've always still seemed to respect how much the service means to me, and I couldn't have got through the aftermath of Afghanistan without you. Plus, you do clearly appreciate the uniforms," John teases and Sherlock goes slightly red in the face.
Once he and Joanna are downstairs and out of Sherlock's earshot, John still feels like he needs to find an outlet for his anxiety — to put words to what's on his mind. "I thought you would have at least asked him how he's feeling."
Violet's youngest rolls his eyes. "John thinks I'm funny. Not that it's always intentional."
John eventually falls asleep while watching the film and is irritable when he stirs an hour later. After getting them both fresh glasses of water in the kitchen, Sherlock goes to the bedroom and picks up the packet of oxycodone to bring it to John.
And the level in the small bony hole he's looking in through is rising steadily. It's pulsing and bright.
"You won't be a part of that conversation, Dr Holmes," a woman in a dove grey pencil skirt suit informs him. She's clearly not a doctor; she has that corporate air Sherlock loathes. "Noreen Ansel, Head of Legal Counsel," she introduces herself curtly.
"Greg? I'm going to be away until Wednesday at least. Family emergency."
John takes a short lunch break at two in the afternoon after working for seven hours straight. Taking off and putting the protective gear back on again is such a chore that he won't do it unless he absolutely has to. He knows he should be drinking more water, especially since under all that plastic he sweats like a bloody pig, but toilet breaks require the same tedious and complex routine as all other decontamination-requiring endeavours. Remove gloves. Disinfect hands. Put on new gloves. Remove visor and disposable hat. Remove gloves, disinfect hands, put on new gloves. Remove protective gown. Rinse and repeat the hand stuff. Finally, remove the protective mask which makes breathing feel like it's being done through a straw.

Calculations of metabolic clearance and likelihood of NHS random drug testing swirl through Sherlock’s head. He shakes it. This isn't about using; it's about
She's taken the chair next to him instead of opposite and places her hand on his shoulder. Usually such things bother him, make him want to shake off the contact like a dog would want to evict a fly sitting on its back fur but now, he feels so rotten that he's indifferent to it, barely even notices. It's rare that he should feel so out of himself, so withdrawn from the world.
"I don't know what that means."
The fingers of Sherlock's right hand are clasping his left wrist hard and his form is tense, nervous. "I'm sorry about the biscuits. I… the skull was an heirloom, and the rest is––"
"Delightful."
"It was all very sudden, wasn't it?" she pats his arm, and he doesn't pull it away. She's one of the only people allowed to touch him without warning.
"Then why didn't he exercise that same dedication and commitment in Mrs Fairholme's case? Was it because she was old, and couldn't argue for herself? He didn’t wait for her husband to be told about her condition, he just played God with this patient," the layperson representative asks.
John never winks. What's got into him? He's wearing the uniform as though he's a good few inches taller, and he's walking around like he's in charge. It seems preposterous that just a set of clothing would transform him into something else, into something not quite the same but slightly similar to his work persona of Director of Operative Services.
"Funny name, that."
"I feel… invisible," Sherlock admits, wrapping the blue dressing gown tighter around himself. "I feel as though everyone else decided everything for me and walked away before I could even process any of it. Greg told me that I need to get over it."
"I'm still a wreck, strength-wise."
"Is that what Mycroft thought would be a good opening gambit? Dull." He almost says John's name, but he'd vowed not to use it again. This isn't
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
"That would make me a liar
"You haven't––" Sherlock gasps, "worked it… out yet, then." It sounds rhetorical. He's read it on your face that you're as uncertain as the rest of the staff at this point. "Lestrade," he adds, nodding towards the phone in your hand.
He looks away. "If they shift, I feel it somewhere inside. Where do they even go, precisely?"
“Could you verify that?” Lestrade asks a crime scene tech, who nods and scuttles out.
Sherlock wedges himself between his fellow surgeon and the door. "I'm scrubbing in."
"You must have talked to her about lots of stuff you don't know how to discuss with me." John takes his usual seat opposite Sherlock.

He doesn't want to admit he's been tempted. That was one test he
John shakes his head. There is no way they'll find a parking spot and make it to the train in just seven minutes. "We'll get the next one," he assures Sherlock.
"He’s fine, Mister Holmes," the nurse whose name he's forgot and cares not a whit about informs him. "His breathing is normal, and he’s sleeping, albeit a bit fitfully."
, John, not now, Christ you're such a---- for fuck's sake, just

"Come in. Please." Sherlock shoves the key into the lock, proud of himself for hitting his target on the first try even though his hands are shaking. "There must've been a lot of mail," he blurts out next, mind whirling.
"Quite natural, yes. Very human."
That alarms John.
, he thinks, sitting on his old bed with his fingernails digging hard into his palms. It's a cruel joke from the universe that this house, one he had spent years hoping to escape, is the only place where he wouldn't really need to conceal his defects because they've all been out in the open since he was small.
Sherlock assumes that such a thing as smugness is not really allowed for therapists but then again, he has no idea what else her face could be projecting right now than a rather relieved
"You flatter me so."
The nurse steps in to write down the measurement.
Sherlock wonders aimlessly around the quiet sitting room, wondering if John's invitation for television-viewing had been but a turn of phrase, since the mind-numbing contraption isn't even on.
_____________
, John replies. He doesn't remind Sherlock to hurry up since his spouse can hardly leave a patient without a consultation they need, and the neurosurgeon on call tonight must be still taking a report from the ITU doctors and might well get stuck on the OR floor after that. Handout time is often problematic for surgeons in terms of getting to go home on time; if there is no one to take over their case or if it's close to ending, they can't just snap off their gloves and walk out mid-surgery. John has spent many an extra hour in the break room watching TV, or in his office catching up with paperwork, while waiting for Sherlock to finish operating.
"Good afternoon," Sherlock says, tempted to slow down his words but tries to keep in mind that people often understand English more than they speak it. "How are you doing?"
You don't know what you expected Sherlock's first understandable word to be, but surely it can't have been '
While waiting for Greg to show up, you stand by the window, hands clenched into fists, repeating to yourself what Mycroft had confirmed — that it'll take time, that this is a phase that was expected. You tell yourself that this is what you should have been hoping for, that Sherlock can't process what's happened until the reality of it hits him.
He texts John to ask whether he's heard anything regarding the discharge. There is no answer, so he calls the ward again to compel someone to go check on his husband. He is told that John's mobile battery had died — nothing more sinister — and that he doesn't have a charger with him. Sherlock wants to kick himself for not realising he should have delivered it, along with John's laptop.
“Should I come?”
"I'm a private detective."
Upon arrival on the admin floor, he finds Lestrade's door closed. He can hear muffled conversation from inside, so he elects to wait. The voices continue for a good ten minutes before Lestrade opens the door. "Why didn't you knock?"
"Why didn't you wake me up?" Sherlock chides.
"If it smells or the gills have gone grey, don't touch it unless you want food poisoning. And never buy herring that's got pink cheeks," John now adds, stopping his boat-washing to catch his breath. His cheeks are pinch-pink from the rain and the salty wind that had whipped their skin raw, no matter how warm the temperature is. The rain is little more than mist now, and the ferry's horn sounds occasionally from the thick cotton enveloping the open sea further out.
"The NHS is hardly perfect and cases like this are catalysts for larger frustrations. The media frenzy isn't about Sherlock; he's become a symbol of larger issues," Mycroft reminds John. "Mistakes and bad behaviour happen in the medical world, John, as do acts of microaggression and overt abuse. I distinctly remember facial expressions of a phlebotomist from years ago who had to draw blood from Sherlock. When they saw what analyses had been ordered, the soothing talk they inflict on everyone else and which they'd already started on dried up very suddenly. Doctors are subject to standards most people could never reach in terms of being perfect in their work, and they are punished when they fail to fulfil those expectations."
When they cross the river over an old stone bridge, Sherlock is looking out the window. Leaning forward momentarily, John catches a glimpse of a small, careful smile Sherlock seems unable to suppress. John nudges his thigh which his knuckles, and that smile blooms into something more open as Sherlock turns his head to face him.
it might happen forty years from now, and not through the direct consequences of the virus. Maybe it'll be heart disease. Or cancer. It suddenly strikes me that in that case, I might plausibly keep this from John forever.
"You'll be gone in a week or whatever, won't you? I thought that maybe someone had actually bought the house and would live there, but when you came here without even a pot to piss in, it's–– it's the same as always," John slurs.
"He's staying with me," Sherlock cuts in. "He's with me."
The tea has brewed, and you deliver Sherlock his cup, placing it on the folding attachment of the bedside cabinet. He opens his eyes, pulling the headphones off. You can see the laptop screen now; it declares that what's been streamed into the headphones is
"You would never hurt someone else to get to the truth, even if I was the patient. I know you, and I trust you to always do the right thing, even if it's far from the easiest option."
When you watch the evening news and a story about the NHS comes on, he grabs the remote and shuts off the telly. Maybe it was the images of a hospital ward on screen.
Angus bangs on the door.
, look what you’ve done. I told you to suture that up hours ago. Do you listen, ever? No. It’s all infected, now. It’s going to keep bleeding."
"I need to dictate my notes," Sherlock says curtly and hurries out of the OR.
The 180 in behaviour Sherlock has executed overnight from upset and frightened to imperious doesn't surprise John; he's seen these things happen with Sherlock before.
"The new valve is doing alright, then?" Mrs Hudson asks. "Or is this rhythm thing related?"
"Well, what am
He expects John to ask what made him decide against it or if he even seriously considered it, but John doesn't. As always, walls stand erect between them with very few openings for honesty and personal details. And they seem to be both avoiding those opportunities lest it's an arrow and not an extended, open palm that comes through.
He places his palm on Sherlock's bicep, gives it a reassuring squeeze. He hates that he has to do it with vinyl gloves on. "I miss you. This will end, you know."
The garrotte around his chest doesn't let up until he's out of the station, tearing down the pavement, trying to leave the crowd before they start staring, before they see how the pricking in his eyes has manifested into tears.
Two other staff members step aside so that John can get closer to the patient. It takes only a quick sweep of his eyes up from the patients toes to their face and he understands.
"Sure," John interrupts tiredly. "I bet you could write a Cochrane review from everything you've been reading."
John crushes his mouth down on Sherlock's lower lip, which leads to some extended kissing and rolling around the messy, crumpled sheets. John is getting a bit cold now, despite having his arms full of a warm genius neurosurgeon and any movement he tries to make underneath the weight is getting uncomfortable due to their sweat-sticky skins.
John will never get tired of the sight of Sherlock climbing into bed with him. Climbing on top of him. Bending his neck to kiss him. Reaching out to run his hand through John's hair or to lay a gentle palm on his cheek. Cheeks flushed and warm, body radiating heat and barely contained urgent desire.
You need to meet this head-on, together, but he doesn't seem quite convinced that you can weather such a storm with him. That anyone could. "Not seeking the answers doesn't change how things are. As much as you'd like to be Schrodinger's genius, wouldn't you rather skip years of not knowing, of worrying — most likely needlessly?"

Sherlock is blinking, unable to even start processing what he's just heard.

[autism, family trauma, medical career, developing and established relationship]
Sometimes Sherlock talks in his sleep. Sometimes he drools on the pillow. And the more John sees of this side that isn't so carefully controlled, so calculated and perfect to ward off others, the deeper he falls in love with the man.
Halloran's lips pinch together. "Before this gets too dire, I feel compelled to reiterate that you are not the defendant; as a witness, you have the right to be treated with respect. We will rehearse your testimony and make sure that you can meet any accusation half-way by reminding everyone that the real victims are the hard-working, diligent,
Sherlock's lips tighten. He doesn't understand at all what John means.
"What's going on?" Sherlock demands. In the seat closest to Lestrade's desk he recognises the chief of radiology, Dr Lisa Spray.
"Doctor Watson was not present, and since what you just described is not an accurate account of how a valve repair is done, I can tell you with all confidence that it's a dream," Marsh says. "Have these dreams you've been having felt upsetting or disturbing?"
"Interesting, I guess. Are you looking to expand your business, then?"
"How astute of you." He crosses his arms. He is most decidedly not a prude, but discussing this is… he can't even find the right words to describe the exquisite mortification. It's not helping his nerves about Sandhurst that there seems to be a possibility that John anticipates having some fun at the expense of his alleged military fetish.
, he wants to say.
”See you soon,” you say as you retreat, because this cannot be goodbye.
"Then... what?"
Mycroft frowns and plugs in the kettle. "He clearly had the requisite talent, but little of the discipline required of such a profession. He'd constantly argue with his teachers, wanting to tackle compositions well beyond his skill level. When they told him no he would simply grind at it until he could master the techniques. And, there were… other issues during the very important formative years which determine whether one gets to move forward in a musical education."
With a curt nod, she disappears into her own flat.
"Very well. What steps have you taken, besides utilising the mentor you were assigned, to improve on these aspects of being a physician?"
Sherlock strides up to Bethany, giving John a hasty nod in passing. "What have we got?"
“It does not sound like an uplifting piece of entertainment, and the title makes no sense. Hard to terminate? To die in a gruesome and spectacular manner?”
“How’s business?” Sherlock asks, having decided a social custom should suffice as payment for information.
"How much practice time would it take for you to whip that piece up to shape?" he asks.

You know the drill — pertinent medical terms are explained at the end of the chapter.
, John reminds himself. He has thought many times that Roger Fairholme could just as well latched on to something else than the surgeon who he thinks cruelly denied her wife surgery just for the sake of his own convenience.
"Even so, you're afraid of what sort of picture the press might paint once this thing goes forward in the courts. That's why you're so upset. You can't even entertain the possibility that they might be right."
"His parents. His brother will have contacted them."
"These are not ailments I suffer from," my brother clarifies, using the tone that borders on distasteful but manages to hang, tooth-and-nail, onto civility. "They are potential side effects of antiretroviral medications. You are looking after yourself, aren't you?
"I’ll be expecting you then. Come here,” John prompts, stretching out his arms so he can briefly wrap them around Sherlock's shoulders and lean his chin on his shoulder.
"Any requests?" John asks, going for Sherlock's belt while he's unbuttoning his shirt.
"Why aren't they going in?" Asks someone behind John.
. What you have done to improve and fix and hell,
"Got a name?"
," she chuckles. "I knew it would have to happen eventually."
"Nevertheless, this piece should satisfy your longing for grand drama.
John pinches the inside of his cheek between his teeth, trying his damnedest to choose the right words. "Because it means you want me to know what's going on with you."
me discuss things which I am incapable of discussing with
"I didn't know if you and he––" John starts explaining but then regrets it when Sherlock's hands drop to his side and he steps back.
"No, it developed because operating on a person is much more interesting than drinking coffee while watching graphs and pressing two buttons an hour."
"I am myself. Who else would I be?"
"Of course not. But you're making it hard to protect you."
," John tells him.
Usually, people pick just one, but somehow, John is always a fascinating melange of not-quite-conflicting emotions.
The skin remembers. It remembers the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, the gentle caresses and the strikes of pain. It holds onto those memories and echoes back those touches years, decades later. That's what people said, and like most things that people said, Sherlock had dismissed it as the poppycock of lesser minds.
"I could reserve a joint tailor appointment."
"What? Sherlock, no!"
John wonders.
"I'm surprised you even know what that is. Have you expanded your tastes?" Sherlock asks with a razorblade glower.
"I see we share a tactic."
"I'm not sure. He isn't, either, but he's got memories disturbing enough that he refused GA for a cardioversion."
[sent at 14:31] I'm aware, but if our roles were reversed, surely John would attend to me at home.
He texts John before remembering that he's probably at the dinner with his friends.
"I didn't leave because I wanted to leave. I didn't leave because I didn't care. I just assumed our… thing always had an expiration date."
Sherlock fishes it out of his pocket and stares at it. "Battery's dead."
"It can also become a habit. You didn't share things with your mother because her responses did not make you feel very good about yourself. You were protecting yourself by keeping things to yourself. After Afghanistan, John expressed blame and disappointment towards you during a time when you needed him greatly. Now, as he is under the weather and you need support…"
Judging by what John is seeing on screen, that state is approaching fast. "What was it like, then, once you got to the hospital?"
he'd have to
perfusion = the passage of blood through the blood vessels or other natural channels in an organ or tissue
Sherlock's ankles feel stiff and he discovers his neck has a crick when he plants his sock-clad soles on the draughty floor. He must've slept like the dead.
The rain-soaked Regent's Park looks bleak. Then again, anything would look that way when looked at through the dark-tinted windows of one of Mycroft's armoured cars.
“We should probably go then.”
"Amazing."
He blushes brightly, holding back a whimper. He nods, biting his lip.
"Tell me how it feels." He smirks and strokes him.
He smiles and kisses him.
He smiles softly and nuzzles him.
“I’ve got you.” He smirks and slowly pushes into his arse.
He manages a small smile.
“What else looks good?”
"You'll thank me later."
He slowly pulls back, nipping at his lips.
John arches and moans as Clark hits his prostate, grinding back against his fingers.
He nuzzles him. He hears Sherlock's stomach growl. "Hungry?" Greg smirks because he knows Sherlock hasn't eaten in a while.
He moans and rocks his hips slightly. “So deep..”
"Good luck."
“The Gardens of Rest.” Sherlock nods.
Mycroft moans as he starts to fuck himself roughly on Sherlock's cock.
Mycroft smiles. “Needy.” He murmurs. He lays on her back and thrusts as hard as he can into her. “Take it. Take it all.” He orders.
Violet mewls and rocks back into them.
“You win wars, Myc. I assassinate.” Crystal hums. “Alright.” She sits with him.
He whimpers and nuzzles his cock.
John throws Sherlock some sweat pants and he puts them on. They get dressed and ready to go down.
“Moll, baby. It’s fine. It’s gonna be fine. You’re full term. If the baby wants out it’ll be fine.” Anthea promises and kisses her before getting in the car, driving them to the hospital.
“Mm.” John chuckles but let’s it go.
"Please." He kisses him back and smiles.
“Almost made me cum.” Morgan smirks and pulls him up, kissing him deeply.
"Please! I need you! I need your cock inside me! Oh god please!" He whimpers and tries to press back against him.
Sherlock groans and nods.
"Mm maybe but it gets you up." He smirks.
“I’m sure Mycroft has pictures somewhere. I used to pull it out when I was high so whenever Mycroft found me he’d clean me up and shave my head.” Sherlock frowns a bit.
Sherlock takes both rings at the same time and look at John. “This is for life John. If you take this, you will always be my... blood bank, until your dying breath. You don’t have to take it if you don’t want to.” He said softly.
She blushes and smiles shyly.
“Then we’ll take less cases. We run the cases now, they don’t run us.” Sherlock runs his fingers through John’s hair.
Sherlock gasps and moans breathily, arching as he's filled with the plug and the marker.
He smirks and moves to kiss his neck. "And how did you want me?"
"That's it. Good boy." He smiles softly and rubs his thighs.
"Sit." Sky command and the lions sits. "Speak." She says and the lion gives a small roar. "Open." She hums and the lion opens his mouth and she looks inside. "Good boy. Hugs." She smiles and the lions stands on his hind legs and puts his arm over her shoulders as she hugs him.
She hums happily and relaxes between them.
“You should have someone here to empty them for you.” He chuckles, squeezing her nipple.
He blushes. “Hi, Daddy.”
"I'm sorry, too." He gets into bed and cuddles Sherlock.
He kisses him and rocks with him.
Sky moans as her air is cut off again. She swallows around his cock, loving how thick it was.
He chuckles and nuzzles him. "We'll see.."
Michael gasps as the enter.
He whimpers and moans at the name calling. "Yes.."
'Love it.. Love being suffocated by your cunt.' She moans, her own pussy dripping onto the floor.
Sherlock blushes as he sees Cecil and Mycroft coming to join everyone.
He blushes brighter and whimpers softly, nodding. He thrusts deeper, stilling as he comes hard into her, filling her and moaning as his knot swells inside her.
Sherlock looks sadly down at John. “You don’t remember do you?” He asked quietly, keeping a firm hold of John. “You were talking in your sleep, we were having a conversation.” He looks into John’s eyes,noting the shades of blue and browns, and the flecks of gold.
“They’re not human. They’re monsters, John. They all are, your boyfriend included. Legally, psychosis episodes are against humans. They’re not humans. They’re not even animals. They’re monsters that need to be eradicated.”
He smirks and licks his lips. "Let me go get ready and tell the others where I'm going."
She blushes and smiles softly.
"After you, she sounds mad. I'll let my big scary Alpha go first."
She leans in and kisses him, moaning as her tits rub against his chest.
She shakes her head. "Not unless you happen to have some cocaine on you. It's the only thing that'll touch the pain."
They waded through the sea of people.
She smiles softly as they sit together on the blanket.
Michael smiles softly, raising his glass.
“I thought the whole group of us we’re going?” John raises a brow as he pulls on his coat as he comes out.
“Come here.”
“Damn, you just keep surprising me.”
Leona giggles at the tingling feeling. “Thank you.”
“Not if I give you my body in my will.” John smirks. “Wow maybe we are a little messed up.”
George looks directly at Greg as he asks his question, his cock throbbing in his pants.
“Be honest with yourself, it was never me you wanted. You were going through the motions. Some motions you couldn’t even get it up for,” Mary laughs.
“I want to get high. The gnawing and craving is there but less so when you’re around.”
He smiles and turns to kiss him.
"Mm.." He closes his eyes and holds him.
He chuckles softly and smiles.
“So, what’s up, sweetie?”
He nods. “Brent’s doing alright as well. Adjusting well.”
“Thank you. Thank you so much. Can I see him?”
He bites his lip and nods. "P-Please.."
“Bad, My. Listen I think this is turning into a your people issue than a my people issue. We’ve got a packed morgue full of bodies with their scent glands removed.”
He nods. "Alright, dear. I know that you wouldn't jump into something if you didn't believe in it."
John sighs. "Sherlock... If we do this... There's no going back." He bites his lip.
He groans. "God, yes.."
Sherlock moans and leans in, kissing Mycroft deeply as he slowly starts to ride him faster.
"Mm, I'd love to have something up my arse."
“Oh Camille, I’m sure you are. You just need to find the right person. Everyone has their soulmate out their looking for them. You just need to search for yours.” Sherlock says softly.
Sherlock sighs. “And what about what he said to you. About you and me?” He asks.
Michael blushes and nods.
Sky’s eyes widen as her air is cut off cunt pulsing as he degraded her. Her holes throb as she gets close to coming again from the rough treatment and stimulation.
He bites his lip but nods.
“What do you guys want to do?” Greg as as he walks around the casino with Sherlock and John.
Greg hums and smiles.
“John, if you’re about to tell me the dog’s writing you notes, I may have to check you into the hospital.”
"Mm. Turn around so I can get that beautiful cock into my mouth."
She moans loudly, waiting for his order whether to swallow or not.
He nuzzles him back happily.
“Dada!” Jared exclaims as John picks him up.
He moans as he looks down at him.
He blushes. "I.. I want you to fuck me.. Jake wants to watch."
“Gonna fill you up, baby.”
Michael giggles at that.
"This is going to be so much fun." She hums as they get into a cab.
‘God yes.’ He groans, thrusting harder.
He takes Sherlock’s hand and kisses his knuckles.
He smirks and rubs his arse before hitting it again.
“Mm depends.” John rubs Sherlock’s belly.
John turns his head to the side to capture Sherlocks mouth once more, hand slowly stroking his partner.
‘Feeling a bit sub, Johnny?’ Sky purrs.
He smiles and kisses him.
John smiles and carefully adds another finger. “All you need to do is ask. I’m your God, I serve you.” He says softly.
He smiles. “Yeah. I don’t think I could eat any more.”
Greg lays in bed, unable to sleep whilst knowing something like Crystal is below him.
"Just a minute, Mr Smythe." John shook his head. "Sherlock, it sounds like a very old man. What romantic enemies would he have made?"
He smirks and hums. "I love you too."
He kisses him back deeply, holding him close.
“They worked some things out I guess. They don’t even snip at each other. It’s disconcerting.” Greg sighs.
He moans louder, meeting him thrust for thrust.
Michael blushes brightly. "That was.. Incredible.."
Carol deepens the kiss and sucks on his tongue as her belly rubs against his cock.
“Good boy..”
He blushes as he watches Sky getting fucked. “Wanted to do that.”
Greg gets measured. The measuring process is very extensive and seems like it takes an age. He's fitted with a suit. Greg goes to show Mycroft. "What do you think?" He asks self-consciously.
"That was fun. I liked your cock the best. It always makes me feel the best. No one else can make me feel the way you do." She hums still out of it, relaxing as he washes her.
Greg blinks. “I’d say yes.” He says without hesitation.
"Such a perfect little fuck toy for me."
Violet smiles softly, nuzzling her.
“I’ll teach you once the pups are a bit older and Sky doesn’t need you as much.”
“Kneeling in front of me.” He smirks.
He bites his lip and nods. "Please.."
"Mm.. No.."
Sherlock wraps his arm around John's shoulder and pulls him closer to warm him.
Greg cuddles him close and kisses his head. “Check in?” He asks softly.
He continues to slowly fuck her with his tongue, ignoring how his cock starts to fill out.
"Of course we've been using protection. The moment Anthea stopped taking her suppressants I started taking inhibitors."
"I don't think I would have been able to understand why she did what she did. But now, even though our pups are little more than cells and fluid in their first stages of forming... I'd do anything for them.
He hums and nods.
He nods and lays on his stomach.
“Okay.” She nods. “Will you carry him up? There’s no elevator that goes down this deep.”
Chris smiles and finally opens his eyes, looking up at him.
“Feels so good..”
Sherlock nodded and shut off the tv.
He blushes and nods.
She cuddles her, hands constantly moving and exploring her body.
She puts her panties and her coat back on.
He blushes brighter and smiles.
Greg hums happily and softens so Sherlock will be more comfortable leaning against him. "So Ford's being a prat and putting on a show. How do we turn off the telly on this rerun?" John asks.
"Let's get these upstairs and we'll tell her when she comes up to investigate how our trip went." John suggests, wanting to put the case down once and for all to give his abused muscles a break.
"Nap.."
He bites his lips and watches him.
"More fingers.. Please.."
He smiles and hops off the counter.
“I know you could have. But if he even touched you I would have had to throw him out through the window and then we would have been banned from here .”
He blushes and nods, rocking against him. “Please. Need it so bad.”

She mewls softly.
He rocks his hips as he pisses inside him, pressing deep.
"You'll have to keep it in your pants until I can get my hands on you later." He holds his hips and brushes his lips over his racing jugular.
He smiles and kisses his cheek. "Morning."
“Here.” Collin tosses him a rag.
He blushes brighter as he eats it.
“I’ve already taken care of it.” Anthea says cooly.
He grunts and groans as he comes hard.
"Good boy. Thank you." She kisses his head and rubs his back.
He smiles. "I love you."
"Mm-hmm." She nods.
John chuckles and nods. “Alright.”
He gasps at the slow pace, whimpering as he gets closer to coming.
“So you don’t want a relationship.” John nods.
Sherlock bites his lip and hesitantly signs what she was saying to John.
He nuzzles him and smiles. "Mm sounds like Sky is back.." He hums as he hears the shuffle of shopping bags and talking.
He cries out as he comes hard.
“Do you want Mummy to ride you or do you want to fuck into Mummy like a horny little boy?” She purrs, caressing his face gently.
"As well as they can be."
Michael gasps as they enter the huge floor.
She smiles softly and relaxes.
Greg lubes another finger and slowly he presses back into him.
He licks and sucks, breathing him in.
"Merry Christmas indeed." Jean smiles and kisses him softly.
“Sherlock! Come in come in!” Angelo smiles and leads them to a table. “Oh! You have a baby! Congratulations!” He grins, thinking he and John finally got together.
He moans as he’s filled.
He blushes softly as he follows her.
Mycroft groans and arches his back. “Crystal.” He moans. “Such a torment.”
“Okay.” He blushes and nods.
John does as he’s told, lifting his arms, spreading his legs, for measurements and pinning.
“Yeah!”
Cecil breathes heavily. "Christ.. I knew your mouth was brilliant but fucking hell.."
He moans and rocks into his mouth. "You can't help touching yourself, can you?"
"Greg.. Let me come in.."
"Mmmhmm." She says proudly, then wiggles in her uncle's arms until she's put down.
He blushes as he’s moved, immediately spreading his legs.
Dark shrugs and shakes his head. “It’s fine. I’m used to having nothing.”
He whimpers, his cock throbbing. Mycroft smirks and chuckles. “I’d say at least 5 times is fair.”
Leona starts to help him, getting out some of her pregnancy clothes from before.
"Let him be right now."
Fitz whines as he feels Turks cock pressed against him.
She moans breathily, looking at Mycroft over John's shoulder.
He smiles. "Are there different types of clubs?"
“I just kind of fell into it really.” She bites her lip as her back twinges.
He smiles and nuzzles him.
A passerby below sniffed hard, and glanced up as John leaned out to grab the window, he smirked up at him, a knowing look on his face.
"P-Please.."
“I can’t believe you hid this from me, that you
He presses closer and kisses his neck.
Mycroft presses against his back and the man smirks back. "You're a cute little thing." He yells over the music.
She blushes brighter and nods. “I’ll just bend over the bar then?”
He nods and quickly falls asleep.
“It wasn’t sad. Just kind of okay. But now it knows it’ll have new heirs.” Margaret smiles.
"Then let us help you.."
“Michael. The love of my life. Which is a ridiculous thing to say because he doesn't even know me yet.." She laughs at herself.
Sky whines and nods around him, doing as he says.
“Oh Jesus Christ! I don’t think my heart can take another surprise like that!” John let out a laugh. “Are you serious?! I can’t even imagine! That’s going to take me a lot longer to adjust to,” he started giggling. “Oh,” he moaned when he stopped giggling. “I can’t believe everyone knows we’re married except me. This is so ridiculous!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Chloe giggles and smiles.
He wraps his legs around his waist trying to get better friction since their trousers are in the way. He rocks his hips up against him as he sucks on his tongue again.
"Whatever you want. I just need you." Sherlock whimpers and rocks against him.
Sky moans loudly as her arse and thighs make a slapping sound against him with each powerful thrust he gives her. “Give it to me. I want to be so full. So much fun. So many babies. I want to be so full I can’t move.” Her cunt is so wet her slick runs down his cock and balls.
He mumbles and looks up at him.
He blushes as he follows them.
“Fuck yes.” He groans. “Let’s open her up and then I’ll fuck you harder than you’ve ever been fucked before.”
He blushes and steps back a bit. "Sorry.."
“We’ll play next.” He nips at his lips, teasing him.
Mycroft smiles and takes them all. “When you’re ready, I want to show you a special room, ma’am. Only I know of it.”
Mycroft cuddles him, fingers tracing nonsense shapes over his skin.
Mycroft comes around and kneels in front of Anthea, wanting to make sure she was okay. He rubs her back softly and takes her hand.
"Mm John." Carol hums, happy to see him.
"I love you."
“Ohh..” She moans and arches into his mouth as he massages more milk out of her, her other breast leaking now.
Sherlock pouts a bit. "I am no such thing."
“So I’ll tell you what. If you pump more of William’s siblings into me I’ll give you a cunt. While you fuck me and fill me as much as you can I’ll make you a pretty little pussy that you can push more babies out of. Deal?” She nips at his neck as she teases his cock. “I already know you want to fill me with more of your babies. I know you were upset that you weren’t here to do it earlier. You can do it now.”
He blushes and kisses him back, determined to be a good boy for him. He leans in and licks up the length of his cock, keeping his hands back to stretch himself.
“Oh yessss.” Sky whines. “I should have asked you if you wanted to stay in my other form.”
"Come with me. Please." He begs a bit, so close. He thrusts harder into her, his thrusts losing their rhythm.
"Come on." Sky snaps and grabs Lilith's wrist dragging her out of the restaurant. Turk frowns and rubs Michael's hand.
“Size queen.” Chris chuckles and nips at his neck, pressing close and rocking deeper with him.
"Daddy.." He whimpers needy and ruts against his hand.
He smiles softly and cuddles into him.
He nods and stands, offering his hand.
Mycroft fucks Sherlock with his fingers and moans as he sucks his cock.
He kisses him back happily.
“It hasn’t worked so far. He’s confused. But he noticed the changes to the flat and he said that his ring finger feels funny. So subconsciously he knows he’s supposed to have his ring.” Sherlock passed Mycroft his mug.
He smiles and nuzzles him. "What are we doing now?"
"Sherlock have you taken anything? Done anything?" John frowns deeply.
He hums and smiles, kissing her head softly.
"I'm right here, love. Right here... wake up and I'll show you just how close I am. God, please... wake up."
“We’re home.” Sherlock says softly.
"Well that was very nice of him." He smiles.
“It’s hard getting out with a baby, ya know?” He smiles.
He moans loudly around him, drooling and pushing his head further down.
She relaxes, keeping him deep inside her. “When I come back we’ll go on a world tour and you can knock me up in every place you want.” She giggles, remembering he had a list.
He can feel himself start to harden in excitement.
He moans and pushes back against him. "Daddy.."
He blushes and bites his lip. "I do enjoy dressing up.."
Turk carefully puts him in the car.
Sherlock smiles as he watches John.
He cries out as he comes hard.
'Mm I don't think so. You two have to wait, remember?'
Sky cries out as she comes hard.
Sherlock scoots back to lean against Mycroft.
Leo flashes a grin before shifting into a reddish coloured wolf.
John whimpers as he looks up at him. "So good, Daddy.. he's so big.."
Crystal cries out and comes over his cock, soaking his cock and lap.
"Here." Sky hands then the keys.
He leads her back to Carol's room.
Sherlock moan around his cock and bobs his head. He loves having his hair pulled because his scalp is so sensitive it sends pleasure like a crack of lighting down his spine directly to his cock.
"I can wait. I think it would be funny to watch." She hums and fixes her glove.
“Perfect. It’s perfect. Your perfect.” Sherlock babbles. “So nice and heavy and full. Even more full when our babies are bigger inside me.”
He curls up in his seat when Jason puts him down, humming softly.
Collin moans around him as he takes more of his cock and thrusts two fingers in and out of him.
“Alright. I think we’ll head out to the garden next.”
"Have you eaten? You're going to need energy."
Mycroft blushes a bit. “Would you like to come back to the estate?”
He moans louder and deepthroats him
Sherlock smiles as he watches Kia with the dog. “Do you like doggies Kia?” He asks.
They pant heavily as they finish coming.
He blushes happily.
Sherlock blushes at the praise and thrusts harder, his cock eagerly leaking. “Wish I could go deeper, Mummy. Fuck your womb like John does with Sky.”
“All Yours Daddy. All yours.” He moans.
“You always take me so deep..” He groans softly.
"Rest, Myc.." John kisses his head softly.
Sherlock smiles. "I like the mystery...and the bones. I have a skull, on the mantelpiece...I talk to him."
He smiles. "I'd love to." He speaks aloud this time.
He frowns and nods.
“Mm, I know. Let’s go check on George and Steve, yeah?”
Mycroft leans against the door frame, starting to doze off.
"Exactly what I was thinking." Sherlock grins.
His breathing is still shaky and he curls against him.
"Brilliant as always." Greg smiles and looks at John's sweaty body appreciatively.
He whimpers and whines, needing more. "Please, John.."
George smiles and holds her.
Michael frowns a bit, lifting his head.
He strips John of his trousers and pants along with his own. He slots himself between John's legs and grinds them together as he kisses him.
He smiles and nods. "He would like to pick."
“Come for me. Come on Daddy’s cock. Be a good boy for daddy and come.” Greg rubs his prostate.
He whimpers softly.
“Jim’s taken him to a warehouse at the airport. We have two snipers in custody.” Mycroft says as he types on his phone.
Sherlock blushes brightly and smiles.
“Mouthy whore.” Another man spanks him.
He blushes a bit and relaxes against him
He smiles against his lips.
"It was for John. He would've gotten shot if I hadn't. It would've passed right through his heart."
He frowns and holds her hand.
Sherlock groans as he pulls away.
“You know I don’t do anything I don’t want.” Sherlock muses, smiling at John.
He kisses Sherlock's neck as his thrusts become more erratic with the feeling of Sherlock tightening around him. "Oh god, Sherlock.. I can feel how close you are.." He moans and strokes him.
“Is that a promise?” Crystal kisses his jaw.
"So so so tiny yet so much energy." She whispers.
He blushes brighter and moves to take her shirt off.
“Of course, Daddy.” She smiles softly, easing his concussion away as well.
Mycroft smiles and kisses his hand as they walk.
He takes out his fingers and and groans as he sinks down onto Mycroft's cock. "Fuck.."
Sherlock hums and takes a sip of his coffee, moaning softly at the taste.
“Of course I am. I’ll always hard for the sight of you.” Sherlock beams.
“Ah.. yes. Used to have a few drug problems.”
“Oh.” Sherlock blushes a bit. “When I’m with you music is composed in my head. I didn’t realize I was making noise.”
Sherlock takes his time sucking John, bobbing his head slowly and fondling his balls.
"A-Amazing.."
“I want it. I want it so bad it’s like the need is clawing at the inside of my skull.” Anthea blushes a bit, hardly ever so frank about her emotions and usually taking what she wants physically.
“What’s this?” Joann smiles as they bring her the present. “For me?”
“I wonder how many babies they’re carrying.” Greg hums, “I bet they won’t be able to fit on the same bed.” He chuckles.
“Ow ow ow.” Sky starts to shake.
Turk pulls out of her as her water breaks. "Brian."
"Maybe. At the moment you have a lovely mix of both your mum and dad's hair. It may change as you grow up. When your Mummy was little she had hair like me but as she grew up her hair changed and now it looks more like her mum's." He kisses Danny's head a bit sad Danny never got to meet his grandmother.
"Fuck.. Sky.." He moans and bites at her neck.
They all start pounding into her.
"I love you."
Sherlock sighs and drinks the blood. “Does that mean you’ll introduce us to the castle, let us into rooms? I had to protect John on a couch out there.” He begs, wanting to keep John safe.
She rides him slowly.
Sherlock chuckled and kissed him back.
“Oh my. I don’t think horn dog is a phrase you should use at all,” John laughed, screwing his face up. “But seriously, though. You never want to talk about your… interests. I’m sorry. Of course you should have them. You just never said anything. If anything, you’re always quick to shut down any conversation about it. I’ve never seen you go out on any dates! Do you sneak off when I’m asleep? You are a bit of a night owl.”
"I love you, too." She stretches up and kisses him.
He smiles and nuzzles him.
"Possibly." Mycroft admits, "if they're anything like how I remember Sherlock."
He hums and nods, soon falling asleep.
They relax into him.
"Hello." She hums and smiles softly.
Pythia frowns and wipes Diōnē’s mouth. “I love you, too. So much.”
“Love you, too Lock.” He hums, falling asleep.
Pete blushes. “Have you tried that?”
“You gonna shower?”
Eli groans and comes hard into him.
“Can I ride you, Daddy? I haven’t had your cock in weeks. Need it so bad.” She whines, grinding against him needy.
He relaxes, closing his eyes.
Greg smiles and runs his fingers through Mycroft's hair.
“Gonna fill you up with 10.” He groans as he pounds into her.
John smiles as he’s manhandled. “You’re so strong.” He chuckles.
He smiles and kisses him again.
"Mm no? How about this then?" John gives Sherlock's cock a nice firm stroke.
He smirks and leans down, kissing her deeply.
He blushes and nods, looking to Mycroft.
“The majority of Sky’s crimes were for good reasons.”
“Slut.” He nips at his lip.
"So, Jim. What do you think, alpha or omega pup? Wouldn't it be funny if I gave birth to a Beta?"
Greg smiles softly rubs Mycroft’s back gently as Dan and Donna bring in tea.
“Mm.. how about when there’s a break in the show, you take me back to the loo and fuck me?”
He relaxes into them.
He kisses him back snuggling him closer.
Sherlock nuzzles John.
"Look at you. You can hardly breathe and you're still so needy for cock." Collin smirks, pulling his hair as John presses harder against his throat.
John chuckles softly and relaxes in his lap. He kisses his head, running his fingers through his hair. “We’ll work it out.”
He grins and leads him into the water.
“Augustus found out about her and threatened that if I ever let her out he’d kill her the moment her foot hit the ground. The only places I could put her was in that room which I had heavily enchanted or that school that was made to keep vampires and other demons out.” Mycroft frowns.
She smirks and sinks down to her knees, looking up at him.
He breathes steadily as he changes.
"Have your people gotten anything yet?" John asks as he makes himself another cup of tea seeing as the last one went cold.
"In the kitchen with Collin helping Carol and Amelia make lunch."
Sherlock’s a bit taken aback by that, blushing a bit.
"Are you hurt?" He asks, still keeping his distance.
Turk helps her up.
She kisses and sucks on his neck as she keeps the slow pace when she finally realizes what she said to Darius. “Oh my god...”
Sherlock moans and sucks on his tongue as Collin sucks his cock.
But you know your desire
He opens an eye to look at him, a bit annoyed. "Would you rather I go out and smoke two packs?"
Margaret nods and jogs off after John. She catches up with him quickly and takes his hand.
"Un-fucking-fortunately." She injects the man with a needle and he blacks out.
“Just the usual murders. Anderson left his wife, she told him she was pregnant, and now they’ve moved to the countryside.” Sally rolls her eyes.
He smiles and hums. "Mm.."
"It'll be okay, My.." He kisses his head. "Do you want me to sleep here with you or with them?"
Benny grins and feels happily buzzed.
They smile and kiss him before getting up, going to get drinks.
“Mm you are perfect.” He grins and kisses him, pushing three fingers into him.
Benny blushes and smiles happily.
Carol makes coffee and tea and Sky makes it the exact way everyone likes. Anthea and Lydia are curled up together on one end of the large couch. Collin walks around rocking Danny slowly to lull him to sleep. George smiles softly as he watches his family all together finally.
"You'll be so full of me. You'll beg for it. You'll ache for it. You'll crave it."
"Have you been working out? You feel more muscular."
“Battling addiction and emotionally constipated as well.” Sherlock chuckles softly.
He relaxes against him, exhausted.
"Let's get you something to eat, yeah?"
She gasps and whines. “Yessss.” She pants as she feels him push into her with the plug.
"Brilliantly, actually." He smiles as he remembers his dream.
"Oh fuck yes." The woman moans, tuning everything else out besides Sherlock's cock. "Mm it definitely seems like it. Tell me, Sherlock. How was it to fuck Mummy?" Mycroft licks his lips.
"After we fuck you, I want Jean to fuck me while I eat our cum it of your pussy."
Sherlock blushes and nods. “You’re very handsome. Do you look like this to everyone?”
Sherlock lays back on the couch, Jared sleeping on top of him. “You need new trousers and shoes. Your jumpers should be fine. I believe my clothes should be fine for now. I can pick some stuff up if need be. We need to get more comfortable with being close together, holding hands, kissing if necessary.”
Michael smiles, feeling more at ease
“We made it, baby.”
Sherlock chuckles and gives them a few second head start before going after Lydia at a human pace.
Cecil grabs her hips as he pounds into her.
She whimpers and squirms, still leaking their cum.
Sherlock mumbles, curling up against him.
He pulls him close and hugs him tight. “You are so strong and you did so good. I’m so proud of you.”
“One day when you’re all finished with your schooling.” Sherlock nods.
Sherlock's frown deepens. "Turk.."
He sucks on his tongue, pulling him closer.
He groans softly, dipping his head down a bit. “Mm..”
"My!" He cries out.
He gasps and arches off the bed as she touches him briefly. His moans are muffled against the gag.
Sherlock screams out as he comes hard, making a mess of himself.
“I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.” He smirks a bit.
Sherlock reaches back and spreads his arse cheeks for him, moaning at how deep he is. "Gonna fuck me again, Daddy? You can, I won't tell the others that you got two loads in me. It'll be our little secret, just between Daddy and his little boy."
“How about we just relax, yeah?”
'Do you want him back, Daddy?' She moans around his cock, bobbing her head slowly.
"God yes yes. I want it. Always. Always want to be pregnant with your children. Always." She cries out as he marks her, coming hard again. "You're going I keep me pregnant constantly, aren't you? Promise me. Please please. I need it. I want it."
“And how do you think they get that blood supply? Through donations? They get it from us. Whether we let them or not.” Greg frowns. “Please John. I’m scared.”
"Did you boys have a good holiday?" Mrs. Hudson asks as everyone eats.
‘The rest of my family has arrived.’
"Can we go to Sussex? I want to see the bees.." He blushes softly and smiles happily.
"He's a wonderful dancer...me...not so much. I can do ballroom dance but that's it." Mycroft said softly.
You finally find
Crystal nods. “So what are you thinking of now then?” She brushing her thumb against the edge of his lip.
“How about we get up and have a shower, I’ll take it out if you, and then we can come back to bed and sleep for a while longer?” He suggests.
Sherlock whimpers as he finishes coming.
They lay down around him, totally chill.
. "I can't pair that shade of blue with any of the RAMC uniforms. It would clash
"No. It was a few years ago. This is just… work-related. Temporary," Sherlock emphasises.
"I doubt it. He is a very good husband and I will spend the rest of my life attempting — and failing miserably — to achieve what he manages effortlessly."
"Trainee, remember?"
They haven’t really even discussed the making of plans, or the future. Things just
John's features shift into a relieved smile. "That's better."
"Replacement or repair?"
to tell you."
"I'm perfectly capable of diplomacy and tact, John."
He'd been assisting Mycroft with some MI6 nonsense again. The agency had extracted three relatively high-ranking Russian military operatives from the war zone in Sevastopol after they had leaked information that the Russia never even intended to respect the Kharkiv pact between the Federation and Ukraine concerning the control of Crimea. Now, someone was hunting them down one by one, and Mycroft had told Sherlock he needed an outsider in finding a mole in the MI6 ranks since someone was obviously tipping off their opponents regarding the agency's moves. When a fourth defector — a Russian spook stationed in London — materialised with information and concrete proof of a larger, secret pact between Russia and its former states regarding the seizure and division of several Ukrainian territories beyond just Crimea due to their natural resources, protecting the man became a priority. In the process, MI6 caught wind of an operation seeking to take down all the agency operatives connected to the case to prevent details of the so-called Glezyieve tapes coming to light. Sherlock found his own name on that list and barely escaped a kidnapping attempt, which would have likely resulted in a well-concealed murder. He'd broken several ribs and his ankle in the process and was in agony by the time he was escorted to a safehouse.
Two members of the panel are whispering among themselves. One of them looks impressed and nods to the other.
"What just happened?" he demands.
. A part of Sherlock envies such an existence as Ardle's, living alone in a lighthouse at the mercy of the elements. Or perhaps not the existence, but the mindset living like that must require. He's always been content in his own company. Content, but not happy.
Then, the senior neurosurgeon seems to sober up. "You remember that car crash I told you and John about a few years back after he got back from the service?"
_______________
Sherlock can barely breathe as he relishes every second of observing John without being noticed, his mind racing in tandem with his heart. He has precious little time to decide what to say, how to react, and he also knows he might not be able to predict what he'll say or do when John's eyes set on his again. With John, even his best laid plans seem to be washed out with the tide.
"What's the matter?"
"He can see where my phone is in an app on his own."
"Don't–– tease––" John groans as Sherlock keeps his grip just so that the pressure won't recede, but won't build, either.
Joanna nods. "When very stressed, he externalises his feelings and thus appears detached from them. It's a coping mechanism, perhaps associated with the sort of alexithymia that is often a feature in ASD. There
"There are lots of surgical videos online. Maybe we could watch one of those valve operations; I could explain the different stages and you can see for yourself. Reality tends to be a lot less weird and graphic than what people imagine," you offer.
? What's not there?"
"How is that in any way connected to me? You've said that my career gives you an inferiority complex, and that's why you wanted that final deployment in the first place."
"Of course. But John seems to have made a certain deduction. Or, he's just teasing, based on certain fetish stereotypes associated with gay men."
"Not at the moment."
'. You don't tell her you're not gay. You're not, but that has nothing to do with Sherlock who takes boxes and rules and classifications and stereotypes and eviscerates with his words, sidesteps them with his very being — makes a mockery of the carefully guarded constructs of how people usually arrange their lives and their identities. You
"If he is, he never says." Violet shrugs. "No marriage is perfect, but the best way to ruin it is to pick every little thing apart. Believe me, I have learned that the hard way. Disappointment goes both ways in this house. Yes, he put bread on the table, but I did often wish he would have
. John's fingertips when he held out Sherlock's phone and Sherlock took it from him. Slightly coarse fingertips trailing on his finger joints until they met the violin calluses on his own much longer digits.
"I never spoke with Mrs Fairholme; when she was brought into the Accidents and Emergencies department, she had suffered a massive haemorrhagic stroke that had decimated most of her brain functions and was in the process of destroying what remained. I never spoke with her, nor did I interact with any of her family members."
The stone is surprisingly warm under his fingertips, sunlit underneath a willow tree, and his skin remembers the rest.
This is John. He's a sports surgeon. He used to be a trauma specialist, but after finishing a double RAMC tour to impose western democracy upon Afghanistan (which didn't quite stick now did it) without a scratch on him, he decided he'd had enough of gruesome injuries. Besides, coming back to England would mean a practice safer and a lot more boring than wartime orthopaedics. For many war-weary army doctors, those would have been features instead of flaws, but John has a chronic craving for excitement and adrenaline he isn't always willing to admit to.
[gift-giving, friendship, loneliness]
Hands shaking. All eyes on him. His own tiny, throat-clearing cough, echoing through the microphone system like a pebble dropped down the walls of a cavern.
"Slow… what… did they––
"We don't always do things to spite others, Sherlock. John would be the first to tell you he had a life before you, during which he made quite similar life choices.
"The way I conduct myself will reflect upon him so of course I must do my best."
You just didn't want it to hit quite so hard.
He gasps when you help him up to a standing position. Even just a week of not using his legs and having to spare all his physical reserves to healing his heart have decimated his muscle strength. He shakes like a newborn calf and grips hard the walker handles as you hang up the IV bag and the portable monitor.
"Is something the matter? Is John alright?" Violet asks, confounded.
You can't concentrate on the telly all night because you can feel the distress emanating from the other room. You need to let him think, but it's hard to see the pain he's been in this whole time escalate because you've taken away its escape hatch.
"And why is this so?"
[00:23] They’re all idiots.
"No. What you just thought was specifically about me."
Sherlock logs in and opens the records. His surgical notes tend to be slight less concise than most neurosurgeons' because he wants to make sure he can glean all the important details from them ever years later to remind himself of the case. In his notes for Mr Zezelj he states the indication for the operation, gives an account of the consent process, details the operation chronologically and finally, gives his instructions for post-operative care.
The Sister’s smile is somehow disarming yet stern. "I’m afraid the only exceptions are for parents of underage patients."
Sherlock leans on his haunches, presses his ear against the peeling, striped wallpaper. It may have once been white and green but now, it's a faded mint and the sort of yellow paper develops with age and tobacco smoke. Sherlock wonders if it’s old enough that the green pigment might contain the toxic Scheele’s green — an acidic copper arsenite which had replaced copper carbonite -based older paint pigments in the 19th century. He makes a mental note to take a sample with him to London for some chromatography.
John runs his fingers through his hair with a sigh.
John hums affirmatively. It appears this is a lead-up to something, and he has a hunch what. "And the hypo symptoms?"
"I’m c--cold," Sherlock tells him, shaking with fear and the glacial temperature. "Can’t we fix it in the morning?"
"Don't hostage takers usually have demands?"
, not the other way around. Maybe you could remind me of this conversation when you feel like that, hm? Just say
"I don't know what this is," you say, your hand indicating an invisible connection between the two of you. "But it's… us. You don't have to worry about me leaving."
"What do
"You mean the useless lot in that tent? They're not saying a word!"
He's facing away from you, topmost shoulder hunched forward and dressing gown cascading down his hips and bottom. He'd insisted on putting it back on when you made him remove his T-shirt for the stitch and staple removal.

This leaves him looking more alarmed than reassured. "I promise it'll be good for you."
"And that's what you got today. You can't hog all the fun, Sherlock, the rest of us need some, too," Lestrade teases.
"But that's… what about with friends?"
"Did you use the word mistake?" John asks, "Out loud?"
"I have been accused of lacking empathy," Sherlock speaks up, and the panellists redirect their attention to him. "I have learned that this assumption often made regarding individuals on the ASD spectrum is not correct," Sherlock continues. "I do not lack empathy, but I do lack the means to recognise it as such, and to communicate it. On the other hand, I am very competent at pushing aside my feelings and looking at cold, hard medical facts to make difficult decisions about patients. Perhaps I cannot deliver a very touchy-feely bedside manner, but I would much rather deliver impartial, evidence-based surgical treatment than let emotions cloud my judgement."
"We had to wrench him out of OR, you know. He never stopped operating. He was closing the dure when we went in and wanted to finish, but we managed to half-pull, half convince him that he'd done enough and Anderson could take over."
We don't have sex that night. Instead, the very thought that it's possible paralyses me in the doorway of what is now our bedroom, and everything is suddenly too much.

Eventually, he starts yawning. He succumbs to sleep before nine in the evening and sleeps for thirteen hours straight. It seems that the music has helped him disentangle from the fight-or-flight state he's been in ever since getting breathless while chasing a suspect.
John straightens his M&S tie, painfully aware that it looks and feels so much cheaper than his colleagues'. He just can't bring himself to part with enough hard-earned cash to buy one from a proper gentleman's boutique. It would cost more than his dad had probably spent on money at any single occasion in his entire adult life; the whole family had to rely on thrift shops and hand-me-downs.
John folds his lower lip between his teeth. He knows from bitter experience how demeaning the thought of needing psychological help is. "Yeah. You think you're supposed to be the doctor fixing patients, not the one needing a therapist."
Sherlock's anger dissipating has left behind an absence. He feels shaky, out of sorts. Not enough and too much at the same time. He extends his hand towards John, mostly to test how he feels about the impending physical contact. To his surprise, he doesn't feel like retreating at the last moment — quite the opposite. He's anxious, but longs for comfort. This is new. For once, he doesn't feel walled off by his frustration and anxiety over assumed failure to communicate.
"I recall you stating, more than once, that nothing delights you more than a juicy murder."
"That's good, then. I'm actually gassing for that list tomorrow," John realises. He'd gone through all the patient records on Friday and spoken with the patient coming in for the longer operation on the phone. The second case will be just a shunt adjustment for a patient who has had several of them, so a bedside preoperative visit or call wasn't absolutely necessary.
It's Wednesday. Two weeks have passed since Sherlock couldn't chase a suspect. It's been thirteen days since his operation. You can't decide if other visitors than Mycroft would be a good or a terrible idea, and you can't decide if the decision should even be yours. Two days ago, when you'd gone for the afternoon, you'd returned to a disgruntled Sherlock who announced that Molly had, quote 'popped by without invitation', and that she 'did not stay long'. You have a hunch whatever kind of dreadful reception she'd received had affected that decision.
"No. I… no." He curses his hesitation; she always picks up on such things.
He can imagine them all sitting in a circle, horrified at what Sherlock has done. The gossip mill will be burning hot for the next few days; doctors seem to have a knee-jerk reaction to mistakes others make where they feel a need to judge and gossip. John says it might be something they do to distance themselves from the fact that it could've been them.
You don't want to start defusing that statement. "He'll pay you back, I'm sure."
Sherlock harrumphs, but complies.
The day you met Sebastian Wilkes for the first time, you couldn't get any sleep at night — not until you realised what had been bothering you all day. It was that throwaway correction you'd made, a comment you barely even remembered about being colleagues. When you finally put two and two together, you nearly went downstairs to knock on Sherlock's door. This was a man Sherlock had clearly loathed all those years ago, someone who was a social ringleader where Sherlock was the outcast. It's not quite true that Sherlock doesn't care what people think, is it? You'd thought so, which is why you'd assumed Wilkes' opinion didn't matter.
"Is that a question, or are you testifying?" Sherlock asks.
Sherlock twists his torso to fix his gaze on the judge. "We're going round in circles. What's going on here isn't a murder trial — this is a blatant attempt at character assassination in order to shift the jury's focus from the defendant to something else."
, John reminds himself.
"How would you punish John if your roles were reversed?" Her tone is oddly neutral, her expression calm and curious.
The respiratory therapist disconnects the ventilator tubing; Sherlock is now breathing completely on his own without pressure support. An oxygen mask is readied, the air cuff of the intubation tube emptied. This brings forth a violent coughing fit and a wet groan, and the monitor begins warning of tachycardia.
willing to throw a colleague under the bus for what I did. They weren't in that OR; I was."
"Why would I be interested in your NHS records?" I snap without turning to look at him.
"Sunday," John says. He'd been out with a uni mate yesterday evening, and when he'd come back, the leftovers in the fridge had not been touched.
"Yeah," Lestrade echoes emphatically. "Go. Look after him."
John glances at the wall clock. "Not really. I came here so I wouldn't be tempted to have one. I'm sorry I barged in without even asking if you had some time."
Mycroft looks thoughtful. "I believe John did. She couldn't reach you, so she called him."
is what the audience is expecting, and it's time to deliver it.
"Why do I need a final check? If it's fine, I'll know it. No need to waste both our time."
"I detest your tone and your use of the plural form. You sound as though you think you're supposed to manage
"Ten."
Sherlock knows that Scots can study there practically without tuition fees, whereas students from England or Wales would be charged with those — smaller than in most English universities, though. He doesn't know what the rules are for that free education — had John lived here long enough to quality?
"Fuck." Yet another thing that will send Sherlock reeling since it's a concrete step back on the road towards discharge. "Can't he be monitored here?"
Sherlock buries his face in the dog's soft neck fur and tries to breathe, rocking back on his heels so he can settle into sitting on the floor, back against the cabinets below the sink. All the times he's done something as pitiful as this at Doctor Pichler's office — let his emotions get the better of him — it has made him feel better. Now, it won't stop, and he feels as though he's watching himself from afar, confused why this is even happening. It's a malignant sort of calm that takes over when he admits to himself he's lost control.
"It was treated in the private sector abroad," Sherlock says dismissively.
John wonders.
"He does this? I mean, he's asked before?"
me, then passed out across the bed and I had to shove your feet away so that I could thleep," Sherlock corrects him, apparently oblivious to the fact that the drunken lisp John adores has made a triumphant return. "Have we been here long enough? Is it thocially acceptable to leave?"
"You stayed because it was the rational thing to do." You're not going to take credit for it because nothing you've said lately, he seems to have believed or accepted.
Sherlock breathes out through his nose, and his expression shifts from warily curious to angry and disappointed. "You just want to avoid litigation."
Sherlock appreciates that. "No, that’ll be all. For
