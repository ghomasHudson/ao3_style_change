An unwilling sob wrenches itself from Cas’ chest in a way that’s nothing short of painful. Dean shifts to face Cas, and tries to catch his eyes, but Cas adamantly avoids Dean’s gaze.
It’s not even the fact that Dean almost died that brings him to tears; it’s the fact that he failed. He failed Cas. Something went wrong——Dean had to have done something wrong——because Cas still doesn’t know where he is. The eerie, quiet repetition of
is enough to draw Cas out of his delusions. The Shadow never was able to get him quite right——or Sam, for that matter——so that makes the slips relatively infrequent.
He’s not dying, and his lungs are not filled with blood. He’s not bleeding out in a middle-of-nowhere barn with a piece of metal through his spine.
Making a point to ignore that, Dean heads for one of the vintage Men of Letters cars, and starts that instead. He’d prefer to drive the Impala, but it’s gone. He doesn’t know where, and hasn’t bothered to track it, because he can’t see the point. The point it, Dean is not going to drive a
Dean knows he’s more likely than not going to have to kill his son. Sam won’t do it, that’s for sure. Cas wouldn’t, if he was here.
He’s a fucking nightmare is what he is, and he can’t believe anything but that, no matter what the remainder of his family tells him. No matter what they assure him of, or how many of Dean’s (painfully true) words they deny, Dean knows the truth. He knows what they think——or what they should think, anyway——and can’t understand why they bother talking to him anymore.
Sam is currently squinting at Dean’s cobbled together, chicken scratch spell in the dim light in an attempt to understand exactly what Dean has written. It’s all Enochian phonics, and Dean hasn’t included an English translation——some of the words don’t have an English equivalent anyway——but somehow, Sam trusts Dean.
Dean doesn’t think he could stop if he wanted to. He presses down on the accelerator, and the car rumbles down the road, bumping over small divots in the ground and purring as sweetly as if it had just rolled off the assembly line that day.
His unfounded reassurances don’t help, and he shakes out his prickling hands as he continues to walk. This is stupid. He shouldn’t be worried. It’s not like what he’s going to say to Mary is important, or a potential catalyst to tear apart his already fragile relationship with his mom. It’s just something she should know, and maybe if Dean tells her this, she’ll be able to open up to him a bit more, too.
Dean blinks again, but red still washes his vision. He stands in an attempt to get a better look at the room, which is when his body decides that this is the perfect time for his legs to decide to stop holding him up, and for his brain to short out.
Scratch that, it would mean definite death. Dean doesn’t necessarily want to live at the moment, but there’s not a doubt in his mind that death would only make things worse for him. If what he had been subjected to earlier was anything to go by, things can and are going to get worse if Dean dies again.
There were long days, yes; panic attacks don’t just disappear overnight, either, but they lessen, as do nightmares. So, when Dean really gets down to it, life is just monsters of the week, long drives in the Impala, and helping out other hunters when they need it.
Jack’s dad, and there’s nothing that Dean can do to change that, so of course Jack cares about him, and of course it had hurt when Jack had watched Dean get impaled.
That’s a road. More than wide enough for the car to drive down. That wasn’t how it had been earlier.
“I missed. I——I swung the scythe, and I missed.” Dean swallows, and the muscles in his jaw tense. As a whole, he’s tense. Nervous about something. “I mean, I hurt her, but not enough. She followed me——me and Cas——back to the bunker. We got cornered. Um, I...” Dean clears his throat and scrubs at his tearstained face. “It was my fault. I thought we were going to die. Cas said that he thought there was something that he could to to save us——save
I'M BACK. Sorry. Time is fucked, bro. Thank you for all the comments on the last chapter, and sorry for my downer of an author's note on that one. I was kind of down then :)
Dean doesn’t know what he is. He still doesn’t know what was manufactured by Chuck, and what he did on how own.
Sam shoots Dean a look, but doesn’t think too hard about the situation, and quickly opens the back door of the car to remove a wriggling, six month old baby. He tucks his daughter carefully against his chest, and steps to the front of the car so that the still-smoldering pyre is between himself and Dean. The baby gurgles and grabs onto the collar of Sam’s flannel. Sam bounces her into a more comfortable position.
He can’t say any of that, though. He’s too choked up, and he doesn’t have time to sort his feelings properly to say what he wants, so he settles for something else, and holds the blade out.
They’re in bed together, and Dean is sleeping lightly, with one arm hanging loosely over Cas’ waist.
Dean's eyes burn with exhaustion, and he grabs for the stacks of notes he had liberated from one of the back rooms. It’s papers upon papers in his own spiky print-cursive amalgamation, Cas’ careful (almost font-like) English, mixed with occasional Enochian, and Sam’s almost illegible lawyer’s scrawl. It’s everything they’ve found, everything they’ve thought of trying, boiled down to the basics.
thing is taken care of, Chuck switches a few wires (okay, a lot of wires), fries some synapses (okay, a lot of synapses), and generally fucks around with Dean’s fragile, traumatized, broken brain in an effort to fix him.
It’s no secret that Jack and Dean have hurt each other. Over the time, they all have in some way or another, and Jack doesn’t hold it against them. They’re family, and no family is perfect (their family less so than the median, but not every family saves the world on a regular basis). And when it comes down to it, Dean is Jack’s dad (one of many, but the Winchesters aren’t exactly the normal family model) and Jack loves all of his dads.
Yet another change shorts out Dean’s memory so entirely that he can’t remember his own name. Somehow, through all of that, he still manages to retain knowledge of Castiel's existence. It’s infuriating.
Dean sprints the rest of the way to Cas, and drops to his knees when he reaches him. Cas’ eyes are closed. He looks peaceful like this; undisturbed and rested.
It always comes back to Cas. Even after everything Cas said——after how much Cas praised him for being ‘loving’ and ‘selfless’——Dean will fail him every time.
Dean rolls off of the couch that he somehow ended up on, and limp-walks to the kitchen. The smell of food becomes stronger as he gets closer to it, and it ties his already pinched stomach into knots.
“I’m——“ Cas clears his throat. All of the tears have horribly distorted his usual voice. “I’m sorry.” He pushes himself into an upright sitting position, and makes it a point not to think too hard when Dean’s arm disappears from around his shoulders.
He’s angry, and he has every right to be. Two choices are in front of him: kill his son, or back off and probably plunge to world into some sort of disaster or another. It’s fucked up, and entirely unfair, but since when has anything ever been fair for Sam Winchester?
Losing time in the empty is nothing new to Cas, but this instance strikes him as strange. There’s not much of a reason for this, other than the Shadow simply getting tired of Cas’ brief mental break and wanting to speed through the insanity.
for his family. It was all for nothing, though, because at the end of the day, Dean is just a person (and not a very good one at that) and Chuck is the capital ‘G’ God.
He’s a (mostly former) hunter. He’s a father. (Not really. And a shit one at that.) He’s something of a legend in the hunting community, though everyone is afraid of him now, rather than in awe, like they are with Sam.
Sam nods slightly. The desperate, almost broken look on Dean’s face scares him, and he remembers something Dean had said a few minutes ago, which worries him further.
Dean thinks Cas might be broken. It’s scary, to say the least, and Dean has no idea what to do to help Cas. No matter what’s said, Cas can’t seem to process that he’s safe, and Dean is real.
) the place is crawling with monsters——it is their home, after all——but today (tonight, this week. Year. Who knows?) it’s empty, and quiet as a crypt. That’s a completely accurate statement, too, because Dean knows crypts better than the average person.
Surprisingly enough, that seems to hurt Chuck more than the angel blade had, and it makes him angry enough to slam Dean into a tree. Dean yelps in pain as a sharp branch tears his clothes and scrapes against his ribs. His head knocks hard against the tree, and everything blacks out for a second.
“Please,” Dean wheezes. Cas can feel the air rush from Dean’s lungs, and hear as Dean begins to choke on nothing.
Dean snatches the book from Cas and flips to a different, marked up page. “It gets worse.” He snickers at Cas’ horrified expression. “The montage is the worst part.”
Maybe relaxing would do Dean some good, though, because he’s starting to lose his mind: trapped in this silence, barely eating, hardly sleeping. It’s horrible.
“You’re real?” Cas asks, stepping into the room. His words shake, but he manages to get them out all the same.
“Should we burn him?” Sam asks after a long moment of silence. His voice is raspy from held back tears, and it doesn’t look like he can stand to touch Jack, let alone prepare to
Dean’s hands are on Cas’ shoulders now, lightly, like he’s scared of hurting Cas. It’s almost funny, considering that the Shadow couldn’t be happier about Cas hurting. Cas wonders why it’s bothering to drag this out.
And with Cas gone (gone for good; you blew your only chance, you fuck-up), why is Dean still pretending to be anything but the Darkness?
Well, about as easy as squeezing lemons in your eyes, that is. The sound of footsteps alerts Dean to Mary’s approach, and he tries very hard to look like he’s been doing more than waiting to corner her and explain a very important part of his identity that he had been repressing for decades until about six months ago.
None of that stops Dean from running full-tilt at the angel and crushing him in the tightest hug he can manage in a sad attempt to right his unresponsiveness the last time he had seen Cas. (It doesn’t help, though, because this is just Dean’s sad brain’s projection of the thing he wants most in this world.)
Cas’ heart aches for Dean, but this is okay. It’s all okay, because Dean isn’t real. He’s not real, and he can’t feel pain.
Cas reads in an annoyed tone. Like all Winchesters, Cas is saddled with disturbingly low self esteem and a skewed perception of why people care about him, but he know that this is ridiculous. “That’s it?” He asks. “I ‘helped?’ I didn’t save you from dying because I was busy ‘helping’ Jack rebuild Heaven?”
The phrase ‘absolute power corrupts absolutely’ comes to Dean’s mind. If he looks it’s easy to see where Chuck’s powers have formed fissures in Jack’s being. Cracks in his skin, dark veins... it’s too much for the kid, and his body isn’t going to be able to take it for much longer without breaking down.
Dean lets him, and it’s a good thing he does because now that he’s started, Cas doesn’t know if he can stop.
Something bubbles under the shifting black of the floor of the empty, and a dark mass congeals into a human-like shape. It steps forward once, twice, almost levels its height with Dean, and cocks it’s head curiously.
Cas sleeps in for once, so Dean takes it upon himself to whip up pancakes and fry some bacon to bring to Cas. There’s no way the guy is going to feel good enough to get out of bed. Not after the solid four hours of on-and-off panic attacks that he had gone through.
“I can make it for you,” Dean replies, probably too quickly. He takes out a mug, turns on the burner under the kettle (they should really get an electric one at some point), and grabs a tea bag.
Sam isn’t any help, though he tries to be, and that just hurts Dean even more, because if Sam can’t find something to help Cas, who can?
More like he needs Cas, if Dean is being perfectly honest. He’s all kinds of weak that would have John Winchester rolling in his grave but Dean can’t turn it off. He can’t. He’s tried. Alcohol doesn’t work. Research can’t distract him. Hunting... Dean is too scared of what he could do to even think about actually going on a hunt.
“Oh.” Well, now Dean can see why Cas is feeling off. Nothing bad is going to happen——correction: nothing bad
Chuck ignores him, and plans another section of Sam and Dean’s never ending route. Left; right; circle; right.
All the same, Dean steps out of the bunker first, just so that (in the case of catastrophic disaster) if he
the door back, and it’s not so far that they’ll need to sprint to make it. Dean isn’t sure that Cas can manage more than an on and off half-run at the moment, but they move as quickly as they can.
They’re not going to be stuck here for long, though. Just so long as Dean remembers the way, that is. All the same, Purgatory
So this was supposed to be posted yesterday but things happened, and now here we are. This was originally split into two chapters, and there was an extra subplot I took out, so they needed to be combined. I'm not the happiest with how this turned out, so I'll go back and edit it later.
The gash is too wide for Dean’s awkward stitching abilities, so he cleans it as best he can, slaps a dozen butterfly bandages over anything he can’t stitch properly, covers it in gauze and tape, and calls it a day. That’s not how it’s supposed to be done, but Dean can’t bring himself to care much.
Chuck will take care of the Winchesters once and for all——he’ll throw them into the empty, next to the angel, where they belong——and then he’ll go about ridding himself of of Jack.
Dean stands, and a wave of exhaustion washes over him. The portal most be sapping more energy than he expected. He extends his hand to Cas, and Cas takes it and lets himself be pulled to his feet. He’s unbalanced, and almost tips over at first, but Dean catches Cas before he ends up on the ground. Dean’s hand slides down Cas’ trench coat covered arm, grabs his hand, and pulls him back towards the door.
All Dean wants is for the things he cares about to be safe. Still, here he is: with a recently un-dead brother, a son
Hey, maybe if he destroys enough things Sam will lock him away. That’s one way for Dean to get what he wants.
Dean goes on a couple of hunts, but for the most part he’s passing them on to other hunters and insisting he’ll pick the job back up for real after Cas is ‘back to full strength.’ Most of his time is spent keeping the bunker running for when visitors drop by, and working on the cars. Sam goes in and out more regularly: on hunts, out to visit Eileen, on hunts with Eileen.
“It’s too dark,” Dean says after a moment. “You’re scared of the dark.” He crosses the room, and flicks on another light.
It’s not that Purgatory has changed, so much that it’s just really friggin’ huge, and Dean is noticing for the first time just how big it is. Pretty much every other time that he’s been here, he’s ended up losing and/or looking for Cas, and distance has seemed trivial with Cas’ life on the line. This time, however, there is no such motivation, so the journey drags on at an almost painfully slow pace.
It’s familiar, even darkened and slightly dusty. Blood-tacky and entirely wrung-out, the Winchesters stumble into the bunker, and it takes everything Dean has not to collapse right then and there. Sam looks exhausted, too: eyes are ringed with dark, his hair is frizzy (which
Cas is laughing. Hysterical, unhinged laughing that doesn’t stop until Dean shakes him out of it with a worried look.
He needs to stay awake, though. He can’t go to sleep. He can’t let the shadow win any more than it already has.
Chuck’s final overhaul results in Dean going deaf somehow, and that’s when Chuck decides to cut his losses and just shove Dean so far under that he can’t cause any more trouble. Then Chuck slips into a persona somewhat recognizable as Dean, and poses as Sam’s brother. Of course, the illusion is further solidified by the fact that he is manipulating Dean’s sad excuse for a body, rather than an improved version, which he would much prefer. The things he does for authenticity.
Sam hopes it’s not too late to patch things up, especially after he pushed her away. What he did, he’s not exactly sure (thanks, Chuck), but he prays it’s fixable. He doesn’t want to lose something he was so close to having. He’s endured enough loss over the years.
The spell he’s found should take him directly to Cas——to ‘the object of his affections’——but being able to pull Cas out of the empty will be a whole different story.
Oh, Dean. He isn’t doing well at all. Everything that Chuck wants him to be: the strong, ruthless hunter who couldn’t give a shit——all of that——is irrelevant as far as Dean’s current characterization is concerned. At the moment, Dean is anything but the person Chuck had designed him to be. He’s drinking, and not in a way that makes him seem cool and rugged, which is the way that it was intended to look in the beginning. What Dean is doing is drinking himself to death, and honestly? It’s not as fun to watch as Chuck had thought it would be.
Sam can’t remember what he did to the keys to the bunker after he locked down and left. Part of him hopes that he gave them to Garth or Jody, but the other part is almost certain that he hurled them off of a bridge somewhere between Lebanon and——
Luckily, Dean doesn’t burst into flames, or disintegrate when he passes through the door, so Sam follows him. They take the long way around to reach the garage, checking to make sure the sigils and protective wards on the outside of the building are intact as they walk. They are, thank...
Cas traces the faint outline of the sigil he had used to keep Billie out, which is still imprinted on the dungeon door. He wonders what would have happened if the warding had lasted another few seconds, and how Dean would have rejected him.
His movements and words are stilted, and Chuck had definitely made a few mistakes in the mental health department, because now Dean has enough newly resurfaced anxiety to kill a man, which is something Chuck thought that he had gotten rid of a few dozen edits ago. This edition of Dean is also prone to stuttering, which is something Chuck had
There are sigils scrawled across the floor of the dungeon, across the wall, grazing the ceiling, all dark ink, blood, and ground bones. It had taken a while to draw them all, but it had been worth it. It had been necessary, and Dean is willing to do anything to bring Cas back.
Cas looks idly at Dean, then the food, before taking the plate and taking a bite of one of the pieces of bacon. He chews, swallows, and looks back to Dean as he takes another bite.
Across the mostly caved-in room, a chunk of rock clatters to the floor and spins in a lazy, lopsided circle.
Dean throws the paperback across the room, and seriously contemplates whether or not to set it on fire. It’s cursed, that’s no doubt, but he hadn’t expected it to be
They make it, and Dean has just enough time to say a royal ‘fuck you’ to the Shadow before he walks through the door between worlds that will bring Cas back to the bunker. The door that will bring Cas
He huffs irritatedly. It shouldn’t be this hard to remember signs, especially when he’s been trying to learn at least some of them over the past few months so he doesn’t seem like a complete dick around Eileen.
——they’ll work. They have to, because otherwise, Dean is going right back to where he came from, and he has a feeling it won’t be pretty.
Cas releases his hold on Dean’s neck, and climbs off of Dean. He should hold on longer, just to make sure Dean is really gone, but any longer, and Cas will start crying. Besides, this is usually about the time the Shadow resets things. Hands shaking, and heart pounding, Cas stands and walks to the kitchen. He needs a drink. Just something to calm him down as he waits for the loop to start over.
Dean immediately looks up, and tries to cover his face with his hand. Cas is standing in the doorway, looking worried and confused. Dean waves weakly.
Sam is immediately next to the kid, turning him over and trying to sit him up. His eyes are wild, half feral, half confused. Jack coughs again, and his eyes crack open. They’re horribly bloodshot, and his breathing is quick and more shallow than normal.
Here we are!!! At the end!!! I hope y'all like it more than Carry On. It's been fun, and thanks for all the comments and kudos along the way. You guys are great.
Eyes not quite focused, Dean cups his bleeding palm, and crawls over to where Sam is curled on the ground. Haphazard lines and squiggles start to cross Sam’s agonized, twitching body as Dean scrawls sigil after sigil on his brother in an attempt to hide him from whatever the fuck Chuck has thrown their way this time.
Of all the off the wall, batshit things that he has done, Dean Winchester definitely never expected to kick god in the balls. All the same, that is what happens next, because what the fuck is Dean’s life.
Cas doesn’t realize he’s started crying until Dean reaches out (his hand is shaking a little, Cas notes idly) and wipes the tears off one of Cas’ cheeks.
Anger stirs under Dean’s skin, but he pushes it down. He can release it after Cas is safe. “Where’s the angel?”
“I don’t know,” Sam says. He’s sitting opposite of Dean, and his legs are bunched in an uncomfortable-looking fashion so that Dean has enough space to be laying the way he had been until a couple moments ago. “I asked you about the road,” he gestures at the now more-than-wide-enough road they’re driving down. “You were kind of spaced out, and then your head snapped back and you——you——I don’t know if you died, or...” Sam trails off, pale and small-sounding. “There was so much blood. It was everywhere.”
Sam looks like he doesn’t quite know exactly what to think. He’s still gaping at Jack, and trying to catch his mind up to what’s happening in real time.
Sam doesn’t know exactly why he had insisted on patching Jack up. Maybe it had been just to fulfill the instinct to protect Jack, to make sure he was okay. Sam knows that it was stupid, he probably wasted resources, but having at least tried to do something to help Jack heal up makes him feel a little better. He thinks that he’s finally starting to understand why Dean would get so meticulous about patching up even little cuts after a particularly stressful hunt.
Eventually, Dean reaches a bridge, and the car (he’s long since stopped thinking of it as Baby) stops. Dean finally makes himself take his foot off of the gas, though it doesn’t seem to matter, because the car had already killed the engine and put on its brakes, seemingly of its own accord.
Sam argues. “Again.” He sighs, long and tired. “Just... rest. Eat something. We’ll finish this later.”
Later, Cas overhears Dean talking to Sam about it. Apparently Cas had been out of it for the better part of an hour before Dean was able to get through to him.
Sam is close to being backed into the river: and is blocking Chuck’s angel blade with one hand on the flat of his own weapon. From the look of it, Chuck is going to overpower Sam, which is a thing that Dean cannot allow to happen. That thought in mind, he pushes himself off of the tree he’s leaning against, and staggers towards Chuck. There’s a knife in his back pocket——it’s only a plain pocketknife, but it will have to do, and it
But now Chuck is gone, and Dean’s brother has taken his place. It’s fitting. Siblings as the light and the dark. Sam: bright, noble, and respected. Dean: broken, angry, and uncontrollable.
And just like that, Chuck is alone again, and his mind is quiet. Just like that, the world is his to control and manipulate again, as it should be. So, with nothing stopping him, Chuck sets his sights on his favorite toys: Sam and Dean Winchester.
But Cas can’t stop. He can’t calm down, and he can’t rationalize his situation the way that Dean wants him to. All he seems capable of is gasping for breath between sobs, and letting himself sink further and further into the dark pit of mindlessness that the Shadow wants him to end up in.
Cas is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, trench coat shucked and held bunched in front of him. His tired eyes sweep over the room again and again, like he’s trying to memorize every bit of the room. Like he’s trying to assure himself it’s all real. Every inch of his body is taut with the tension of worry——fear, even. That emotion——fear——makes Dean’s chest pinch. He doesn’t want Cas to be scared.
He drops the book like it’s burned him the moment that the realization hits. The drop is partially from shock, and partially because Dean is shaking pretty damn hard, but it causes the desired effect. It’s been under his nose the whole time.
So he puts up with Dean's tears as he attempts to fix him. The tears (and accompanying emotions) are rather annoying, because not only do they interfere with the storyline that Chuck is cooking up, but Dean is always——
It had taken a while——Dean isn’t sure how long exactly, but it couldn’t have been more than a month——before Dean was able to get himself under control enough so that he could stumble out of the dungeon and hide in his room instead. (Fuck. Why did it have to be the dungeon? Where Cas had——had——)
Dean had called it theirs). He ignores the glass shards biting into his feet, ignores the spilled water, and bolts out of the room. Tears spring to his eyes as he runs, and he can’t stop them. He needs to get back to Dean, to see if his body is still there——to see if it’s
The ‘angel’ with a crack in his chassis. Although, maybe ‘crack’ isn’t the best way to describe what had gone so catastrophically wrong with Castiel. (Chuck still isn’t sure exactly what the problem with Castiel had been, or why it wasn’t fixable.) If anything, Castiel was more the product of a shattered mold.
Even a fake, dream-Cas that makes Dean wake up in tears is better than Dean shivering on his unused bed in his useless room in the bunker, clutching a bloodstained jacket against his heaving chest and trying his hardest not to destroy it because it’s all he has left of Cas.
A choked noise pulls its way from Dean, and he scrubs his hands over his eyes. They come away wet and slick with saltwater.
‘Dean’ is so worried about Cas that he buys Cas’ mental recovery instantly.Oddly enough, the dog pays a lot of attention to Cas, though. She seems to understand he’s hurting, and tries her best to help him feel better, even if she is really just one of the Shadow’s constructs.
Cas is looking sadly at the book. “That’s horrible,” he says, sounding as if Sam had really gone off and done all of that.
Dean thinks of Miracle, and when the gnawing fear in his stomach doesn’t disappear he stops thinking all together. It’s easier than one would think.
Chuck had locked the doors——but now all he can see is an Impala with a broken door, and a muddy smear on the ground where one of the brothers must have fallen. Other than that, the Winchesters have vanished without a trace.
Dean can’t answer. His throat is clogged with emotion, and he wants to talk——wants to explain everything to Mary——but the words won’t come.
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispers as he lets the last of his control begins to swirl away. “You should probably get everyone out of here before it’s too late.”
Dean lays his forehead against the table. He’s exhausted, and doesn’t want to fight anymore. Just staying awake is hard, and forcing out words increases the difficulty tenfold. “I found the thing,” he slurs. “The o-o-oph-ophi——“
he thinks as he slices his hand open. He barely notices the sting, what with the other various sources of stabbing pain all over his body, but he knows that he cut too deep and his hand is gonna hurt like a bitch later. That is, if he survives.
Another growl shifts the ground, and knocks Dean off his feet. He goes to catch himself, grabs for the area that should be the edge of the door, and keeps falling.
Sam grabs the shoulder of Dean’s jacket and stops his brother in his tracks. “Purgatory is where Chuck put his worst mistakes! Why would he give them a chance to sneak into Heaven?”
(The nuns hadn’t even been vengeful, and that had hurt Dean more than anything else that happened that week.)
The book hisses and spits up a patch of ashy smoke. A sad whistle escapes the foil cover as it melts.
“Don’t think I’m not going to ask about this later, though,” Sam says, tossing a glance back at the pyre.
Unfortunately, the wind——and accompanying dust——decides to change directions, and both Dean and Cas end up with a face full of ash. Cas doubles over coughing, and Dean is frantically wiping ash from his eyes when a familiar bright red car pulls up in front of them. The engine cuts, and a moment later, Sam steps out of the passenger’s seat.
“Ssssssam?” He slurs, still attempting to bring his body completely online. “Sam, whasss——“ he rolls to his side and vomits blood all over the floor of the car. “Wh-what happened?” His arm twitches up to his throbbing chest, and he moans in pain.
He gently sets down the now empty container, and holds his hand up. Dean tosses Cas a lighter, which he catches with practiced ease. He flicks the striker, and a small orange flame appears. Then he catches Dean’s eyes, and drops the lighter onto the book.
A bone-scraping shout tears its way from Dean’s throat. Everything hurts so terribly, and he scrambles for the knife in his back pocket. He needs blood. If he has blood, he can use it to draw the sigils designed to hide someone from god, and maybe——
The incident had resulted in more blood than Chuck had expected, but you can’t have two perfectly obedient Winchesters without cracking their skulls a few dozen times. And since then, Sam and Dean haven’t tripped any of Chuck’s censors, so it must have worked.
Jack’s head perks up at Dean’s question. Dean sounds tired. His voice is rough, and wrought with emotions and pain.
They head out, kill some vampires, and Dean dies. It’s touching, really. Chuck even makes himself cry a little. The kicker is when he pushes the real Dean to awareness right before his tattered heart stops beating.
Dean uses this as an excuse to brush up on his sign language. He knows a lot more signs now——and he’s even faster at signing than Sam when he has something he wants to say——something Eileen will never stop giving Sam shit about.
Dean sits up, immediately regrets the decision, and makes a half pitiful, half scared noise of discontent. He blinks away the fuzziness at the edges of his vision, and looks around.
Dean slides down, into a sitting position against the cabinets, and lets himself cry. Hot tears stream down his cheeks, and he tries to scrub them away, but to no avail. They just won’t stop, and it’s
At some point, Jack wakes up, but he doesn’t do much more than he position himself and stare blankly ahead.
No matter how much he’s hurting physically, Dean’s mental demons refuse to leave him alone. He can’t stop replaying Cas’ last moments in his mind. Even months later, it won’t leave Dean alone.
And just like that, Dean goes from being numb, to being so scared for Cas that it hurts. He can’t sleep. Can’t eat. Can’t——
Sam had needed to drive the Impala back to the bunker, and Dean had spent the entire time in the back seat biting his lips bloody in an effort to avoid destroying something else.
The minor headache Chuck ends up with is more than worth it to hear the sadness and anger that Jack screeches day and night. Apologies, promises to the Winchesters and Castiel that he has no hope of keeping, and the occasional threat when he tries to sound like Dean. The passion that goes into Jack’s attempts and rants is commendable, but——like the toddler that he technically is——Jack eventually tires himself out, and retreats back into his own mind.
Most of the drive home had been spent catching Jack up on everything he had missed, which didn’t seem like a lot until it was all spelled out. By the time they had gotten to the end——Sam had done more of the talking——it almost seemed like too much. It
Dean can’t answer. Maybe he won’t, he’s not quite sure, but the words won’t form themselves correctly. He knows he should say he’s fine, brush off the sick, tar-like sorrow coating him, and get himself to Sam and Jack so he can help, but none of that happens.
Then this. Bobby telling him that he's dead, and sounding just slightly off about it. A mention of Cas, and of Jack, but no appearance from either of them. It's not like Dean deserves recognition from them, but their absence is slightly off-putting. And now he's alone in a car he knows better than himself, flying down a road he wants nothing to do with.
“You were real,” Cas sobs, grabbing the soft fabric of Dean’s shirt, and pressing his face against Dean’s shoulder. Tears start to soak Dean’s shirt. “This whole time, and I——“
Dean flickers into view right in front of Cas, and tackles Cas in a hug before the angel has a chance to react. Cas almost chokes on his own breath. He hasn’t been touched——hasn’t been aware enough to even know if he has been——in so long.
and yet, they have. Warding, no doubt. But at least Chuck has a general idea of where they are. He would have had more certain location if Jack hadn’t been so loud, but such are grandchildren. Always messing with plans and ruining what would be an otherwise peaceful retirement.
Jack thinks for a moment, and with every silent second that passes, Dean’s heart sinks lower. He can’t leave Cas like he is now, alone, cold and catatonic in the icy-slick slime of the place that is the empty. He can’t let himself do what Chuck wanted him to——to carry on with no thoughts of what he had lost. He can’t——
And that is how they end up at a table: Dean nervously tapping at the wood of it, and Cas refusing to even potentially meet Dean’s eyes. Both of them now quiet. It has been a couple hours since they had started talking, both still buzzing with adrenaline, and every bit of Chuck’s puppetry that Dean understands and knows of has been revealed. He almost wishes he hadn’t said some of the stuff he did, if only to spare Cas the mental images.
Sam’s eyes go wide when he hears Cas’ voice, but Dean is already on his feet, sprinting as quickly as he can to the door.
Thanks for reading, comments and kudos are always greatly appreciated and will be kept in a little zip-lock baggie for me to snack on when I need some serotonin!
And, of all the possible things, Dean is currently leaning against the outside wall of a building in a grimy alley, covered in blood, and waiting for Sam to emerge from the sketchy convenience store. Sam had taken all of the money they had, and run in to get the basics: food, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and first aid supplies. He had chosen himself over Dean, because Dean was more than mostly drenched in blood in various states of drying, and dirt.
He trudges into the kitchen, blinking back a yawn, and readies himself to try and scrounge up something edible for Sam and Jack. There’s not much other than cereal and some canned goods in the kitchen, but it will have to do.
Cas squints at Dean, and arches an eyebrow slightly. “Yes? All you said is that she must have sent it as a joke, and then you tossed it into the corner of our room——“ Cas clears his throat and prepares finger quotes. “For ‘Miracle to eat.’”
Plain pasta it is. Maybe they still have some canned tomatoes, but Dean doesn’t have nearly enough time to put together a sauce that won’t taste like shit, so he just throws some bowties (the ones that are three different colors because Jack likes the orange ones the most, and Sam seems to think that they’re more healthy than they actually are) into a pot of boiling water, and rifles through the cabinets for olive oil. They should have that, at least.
It was about time Ash had gotten a hold of her when he did because she was just about to take matters into her own hands. Which, as a matter of fact, she was already parked outside Dean’s apartment when she received the email notification on her phone.
Walking away from her completely would have killed him and he couldn’t do that. They loved each other, still do, and keeping their friendship as is was perfect really.
There was a quick pause that to Dean seemed to stretch on forever as he internally panicked. What if Dean was recognized? What if it was Cas and he recognized him? He’d be so screwed!
Sleep is an interesting concept. It’s a time of rest where your body recharges and your brain catalogs information gathered during the day. Dreamland is also an amazing place to escape to, where nothing really mattered and one could do as they pleased without fear of judgment. It was generally a peaceful experience for most people and for most people, the sound of an alarm in the morning was enough to make a person angry, perhaps murderous.
Castiel huffed out an exasperated breath. “I haven’t thought about any of this in such a long time. I swore I was through with it.” He chuckled dryly.
So the move went well, I'm all moved in at my boyfriends and I couldnt be happier. Its strange tho, never moved in with a significant other before lol So it hasnt sunk in quite yet.
So, despite feeling disappointed that he never received a reply that following morning, Dean went about his day as per usual. He made it to his Theology class on time and found an open seat next to Castiel in the back.
“So the button up wasn’t just for me?” The grin on Dean’s face stretched wider and Cas, God help him, he couldn’t stop the heat from climbing up his neck and spreading to his cheeks. He tried to say something, anything to refute the accusation, but all that came out was a bunch of incoherent sounds.
“Yeah, I must look like shit though.” He took a sip of his water, the coolness of it soothing his throat.
“But…I can’t dance.” He wanted to dance, he did, but he was nervous. So he nursed his drink, his body tingled with the rush of the liquor, his edges starting to blur. And for once, there wasn’t a depressive edge to it. He watched his two friends dance like no one was watching and well, they were actually quite good. Granted, he was already pretty tipsy so everyone seemed to know how to dance in his current state.
“No.” Castiel shook his head vehemently. “There’s no way I’ll put you through that again.” The situation Castiel had found himself in all those years ago was far from ideal, but there was no one else he could have turned to in such short notice. The sense of loss was all consuming, but what was worse was how much he burned with a need to essentially breed all over again throughout the whole ordeal. He not only suffered from conflicting emotions and desires, but also the physical pain of rejection. And poor Gabe, he could only do so much to ease any discomfort, which wasn’t much at all. There was no way he’d allow his brother to see him in such a state again.
“Dean! Hey.” God damnit, it was Anna. She was suddenly at his side, interrupting his musings. “What a surprise to see you here.”
“Hello Dean.” Castiel elbowed the man beside him in a way to get him to behave. Dean knew that gesture all too well, he used it all the time with Sam, and visa-versa. “I didn’t realize you were here…Is the repairs on your car finished as well?”
That was apparently the wrong thing to say because was seething now, beyond livid. How could Gabe even think of that monster as family?! “He’s not my family! He never has been! Our mother is my family, our father! You two are my family, not him! He sent me away and cared not for the things I was subjected to.”
“I’m okay…I was just released not too long ago. Despite some bruised ribs, a mild concussion and a dislocated shoulder, I’ve been given a clean bill of health.” He took a seat on the other side of Dean, his eyes never leaving the comatose man. “How uh…Is there an update?”
Posse_Magnet67[1:22PM]: Eh, IDK. Me and my brother have been referred to as Moose and Squirrel before. Or Rocky and Bullwinkle. Lol
Castiel’s brows furrow together, miffed. “No, Dean, you didn’t do anything wrong. I…” He paused, glancing down at his feet as though to gather himself.
Dean flipped his phone over, face down and ignored the damn thing, opting to focus on his lunch instead. When he was finished he slouched in his seat and scrolled through Facebook just to kill time, though his mind continued to wander onto the subject of Castiel. And, as if on cue, his phone buzzed with a picture message from the object of his thoughts.
“Okay, okay. Hey! Why not ask him about the dinosaurs you mentioned earlier. Or, you can just straight up flirt with him, up to you.”
Gabriel hummed with what sounded like sympathy. The subtle tones in his familiar scent changed to match, instantly soothing Castiel, at least for the moment. “I get it, I’m sure it’s not your preferred course of action. But you should at least check out the clinic, get all the information you need. I’m sure the alphas there are highly credentialed and well versed in the needs of omegas. Besides, I doubt you’d want me to hook you up with one of my alpha friends.”
Castiel[5:04PM]: Its fine. It’s a nice change of pace from the seriousness that is my job. So thanks lol
“H-hey Cas. Uhm, sorry to barge on over like this but, uhm…I uh, I brought food?” Sam held up the bag of Taco Bell in an offering of friendship, a slight, unsure smile on his face.
Alright, so this was happening. Dean hadn’t be certain if the omega was at all interested, hell, the thought never even occurred to him, he acted on pure instinct. Well, just one more point under Sam’s name for being right, yet again. To hell with it all, Dean was going on an actual date with a gorgeous omega.
“Okay.” He came back with the mushrooms and added them to the cutting board. “Chop those up roughly.”
“Oh c’mon, I’m not that drunk. Well, maybe a little more than last time we were here, sure. Last time I wasn’t near drunk enough to hit on you.” He took a step forward, swaying a little as he went. Dean was getting too close; cutting off any means of escape. Castiel wasn’t going to give in to any of it, no matter how tempted he was.
Dean hummed in response, his eyes remained shut. Castiel stole a glance at him, but this time he really looked at him. The jut of Dean’s jaw, the line of his neck, his collar bones…He really shouldn’t still be attracted to the damn man, not especially after everything they went through together, but damnit…Castiel’s mind and body betrayed him at every turn.
CasaNova36[3:11PM]: Like, speak to each other over the phone? God, I don’t know…Lol I’m nervous just thinking about it. Isn’t that like, breaking a rule or something?
Castiel’s gaze danced over Dean’s face before dropping down to his lips ever so briefly. And Dean, or lord, he nearly combusted, his whole body growing warm with the stirrings of want. Shit…
A year ago, January, marked the end of Baby’s repairs. And boy, was it a rough few years without her. Dean had been stuck with a shitty truck for a little while until that kicked the bucket and then Bobby lent him an old Mustang that was fun to drive for a time, but he missed his car.
Dean huffed, eyes scanning over the rear end, checking out the new taillights and the fresh coat of paint. Flawless, absolutely flawless. “Yeah, well, the guy’s lucky he’s cute.” Came his hasty reply.
“Could have fooled me Dean.” Sam wandered into the kitchen and poured a generous glass of water and shoved it at his brother, urging him to hydrate lest he regret it come morning. “So, Castiel’s the one who hit you huh?”
“Hey, just calling it as I see it.” Gabe held up his hands in defense. “I am curious about one thing though, what happened between you two?”
Castiel turned to Dean then, chuckling. No, there was no way he could ever forget those beautiful green eyes and those damn freckles that dusted lightly over his nose. “Do I have a choice?”
Dean wore an old pair of grey sweatpants and a loose tank top that appeared to have seen better days. His hair was a mess, random little strands sticking up stubbornly in odd places and boy did he look exhausted, if the dark circles under his eyes were any indication.
Anna[3:25PM]: Hey bro! So it’s Singer Salvage and Auto Repair. Their number is 286-9327. They’ll take care of everything, Oh! And their lead mechanic is real easy on the eyes ;)
“Yeah, I never pegged you as a home wrecker.” He chuckled, sipping his beer. “No, it was a long time coming as it happened. He found out much later that she cheated on him.”
“Y-yeah, I know what you mean. I’m sorry about what happened man. And uh, hey, when you say things got heavy, whadya do, kiss him? Cause’, I mean, that might freak a dude out.” He teased in an attempt to keep the tone light. He still felt like an asshole though for digging like this, hoping beyond anything that this wasn’t Castiel and yet praying that it was too. It was a straight up dick move, but what else could he do?
“Oh! Yes, uh, touché.” It was Deans turn now to blush and Castiel knew then that he was thinking about the kiss they almost shared before Sam decided he was going to ruin it at the worst time. They had been so close, a mere breath away from each other. Castiel could still remember the way in which Dean’s fingers threaded through the hair at the back of his neck, the way they twitched against him, tempted to pull him close. Whether it was all the alcohol or not, Castiel was praying for another opportunity just like it. “Well, any guy would be lucky to have you.”
Also, side note: does anyone know how to insert pics into ur fics? Like, ive been reading some awesome fanfic and people put pictures in them, like, bruh, how do? lol Its so freakin awesome.
Posse_Magnet67[10:40PM]: Hey! Just to let you know, if you ever wanna call me up, go right ahead. Anytime you need me :)
“Hey! Ellen!” Dean slurred. “Cas! This is Ellen Harvelle, owner of The Roadhouse. Super sweet but she’ll cut you if you try to date her daughter.”
CasaNova36[3:15PM]: Yeah, you might be right…How many times do you think we passed each other in the halls?
Both Castiel and Charlie burst with laughter at Becky’s completely unexpected comment. Castiel’s cheeks burned at the implication, images of him and Dean finally coming together flashing through his mind. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Dean nodded his head, his own eyes welling up with stubborn tears. God, how he hated showing too much emotion like this. It left him open and vulnerable. His heart was breaking, the pain and desperation of it engulfing him.
Charlie laughed at his comment and sat down in the other computer chair. “I guess so. Me and Becky think he might already know the guy in real life, but we’re at a loss at how to figure that out. I mean, I can’t exactly go up to suspect number one and confront him about it.”
“I’ll text you tomorrow with the details.” Dean nodded in agreement and with it all decided, Castiel left the alleyway with his heart still pounding in his chest. This could very well be a huge mistake.
A small smile creeped up on his face at the thought of his mystery friend. His voice was really soothing, and it was so nice to be able to speak to him instead of text. Sure, it made things more real and that was a little scary, but Posse Magnet was so…He was caring, understanding, and he wanted to be there for him despite the circumstances. He had offered any help Castiel may need.
With brows creased together, Charlie nodded interested to see where the other girl was going with this. God, its been such a long time since she’s seen that movie.
“And you wouldn’t have me any other way.” Gabriel watched as Castiel finished gathering his things for work, speaking up again as he slipped on his shoes. “Just think about it Cassie. And hey, if you want, I can sniff him out and put in a good word for ya.”
It was the absolute truth too, regardless of how Castiel was taught and what he was taught. How could he not think this man was gorgeous? If only he could see the face that went with the rest of the photos.
Good God, didn’t this man know anything about scent blockers? It was all Dean could do not to pull the omega into a back room and ravish him. He was barely keeping it together here, it was a shock that Gabriel hadn’t caught on yet. But shit, there was this urge to just…Just…
Castiel was grateful to see his brother finally leave, but the short visit had successfully pulled him away from his studies and now he had lost all motivation to continue. His mind was now lost, wandering in a million different directions. He had a party he may or may not go to, depending on which one Posse Magnet was referring to. There was also the whole costume shopping business he needed to consider if he decided he was in fact going to go. Ugh. He was curious about something though.
He…He what? Oh, shit…How did he mean? As in like before all those years ago, or just as a friend? There was no way it was as simple as Dean made it out to be. Castiel’s heart pounded in his chest as he gazed at Dean, the look on the other man’s face was calm, perhaps a little calculating…Castiel wasn’t sure what to say, how to respond and just as he was about to say something, anything, the sound of the front door opening and slamming shut broke whatever tension lingered in the air.
Besides, how does one even determine if another man swung that way without being too forward in asking? Castiel was a bit of an enigma, quiet, did his own thing, had a few close friends. Nothing about him told Dean he had an interest in the same sex. Or the opposite for that matter.
Castiel eventually made it home, and before Dean too apparently because ten minutes after he got home his phone buzzed in his pocket. His heart beat quickened in the old familiar way when he saw the unknown number and knowing instantly that it was Dean.
Posse_Magnet67[8:18PM]: And I look forward to hearing about your shopping trip :) Let me know when you go?
It was nice to finally have his Baby back and in tip top shape. They had been apart for far too long and he was just itching to get her back on the open road, to feel the rumble of her engine and the wind blowing through the open windows. This wasn’t the longest Dean has been parted from his Impala due to physically damages by any means, but it didn’t matter. Even a single days’ inconvenience would be more than enough to make Dean go crazy.
Right now, however, Castiel didn’t care. He didn’t want to care. He just wanted to feel, to enjoy what he longed for while he still could. And things were getting better each day, he had a party to look forward to before any real, personal help was to be searched for; Castiel’s plan. Talking to Posse Magnet seemed to help a lot and he found, interestingly enough, the more that they spoke, the more he felt that attraction rekindle itself between them. Castiel was fond of Posse Magnet, and hey, if he wanted to feel certain things then this was indeed the safest way of doing that; as he repeated to himself, over and over, validating how he felt.
“Uhm, no one.” He could feel the heat fill his cheeks at the lie. Damn it all, he thought for sure that alcohol was supposed to give a person confidence. He should have been able to lie better than that. Except, there Charlie was, sipping on her drink with that knowing look in her eyes. Castiel didn’t know what else to say.
Dean scoffed as he took off the smaller of the two masks, the one that covered just his eyes. “Yeah, I’ve been doing that quite a lot lately as it seems.”
Was Dean apologizing? Shit. He wasn’t prepared for this, hell, a part of him thought he might have been reading too deep into things. But, no, why was he apologizing? “Dean, it’s…You don’t need to apologize, for anything. I…I’m the one who screwed up. Uhm, so your comments earlier…I deserved it.”
Posse_Magnet67[12:56PM]: If we both know Gabe; do you think we might know each other in real life? Wouldn’t that be hilarious? Lol
“Castiel.” He glanced between Charlie and Becky. “Ladies.” Zachariah gave them both a pointed look that suggested that he wished to speak with his nephew alone. They got the hint and quickly left the room after letting Cas know that they won’t be very far should he need them.
“Don’t play dumb with me. You’re secret. I know who you are and I know you’ve been talking to Cas online.”
Castiel left the room to see Sam hauling a couple blankets and a spare pillow to the couch. “Oh, uh, thanks Sam.” He smiled.
Dean roared with laughter at the unhappy, scrunched up look on Castiel’s face. He watched as he quickly chased it with his beer. “I take it you don’t like tequila then, huh?”
CasaNova36[9:34AM]: Are you speaking from experience? Cause’ there’s no way in hell that’ll ever work for me.
“Sure, that could be fun.” Castiel wasn’t normally one to drink more often than needed but he couldn’t really tell Dean no. The guy was excited about his passing score, they had to celebrate. Besides, Castiel enjoyed hanging out with Dean, it certainly had its moments, good ones.
Yesterday he had told Benny what happened after he and the two other girls left. Benny laughed, not at him of course, Dean knew that. He was intrigued. Hell, Dean was laughing too, it was all so ridiculous. Dean Winchester, having the hots for another dude and being so hung up on it too. It was way out of character for him.
He wasn’t sure whether it was because he was the first on the list or if it was because of the lengthy description in his bio. Probably the latter. He seemed very genuine and his profile photo gave him the impression that he was very kind. The biggest thing that really stood out was the bit about family and his experience growing up. To Castiel, family was incredibly important.
“I’m serious Charlie. I wouldn’t lie about this. When me and Cas got close I stopped talking to Casanova, my focus was on him and him alone. After he called it quits I needed….I don’t know what I needed; a distraction maybe? I needed something else to focus on instead of this aching in my chest whenever I thought about him.”
Fuck it, he was going to send another message himself and leave it at that. If he got a reply then great, if not then that was a sign to stop pursuing the guy altogether.
Posse_Magnet67[1:48PM]: Hm, well, you could go as an angel! I mean, you do have that angel wing icon thing for your profile here.
Castiel glanced over at Dean and his friend. Sure, Benny was attractive and being a true gentleman from the south seemed to add to the appeal. But he just wasn’t Dean. Dean exuded masculinity in the way he walked, in the way he dressed; plenty of plaid and that damned leather jacket. It was even in the way he spoke with the slightest hint of a southern accent himself. Dean was beautiful in every way a man could be.
“No way!” He took a sip of her soda. “I’m sure he was just nervous. Pretty sure if he wasn’t, he would have asked you out with zero issues.”
Posse_Magnet67[3:58PM]: I’m glad you did too :) I was surprised when I didn’t see a message from you the past few days. But I get it, I figured I didn’t hurt to try.
Castiel released a breath he didn’t know he was holding in. “You drank on a more or less empty stomach. I didn’t. You can trust me Dean, I’ll get you and your car home safely.”
“Shit, I’m sorry. I’m uh…Well, for lack of better terminology, I’m pretty sure I’m a little aroused at the moment.”
But Dean. His attraction to Dean was intense enough. It was unfortunate that they had to work so closely together now. The deepening of his attractions could be well avoided if he didn’t care about the man’s housing situation.
Their food finally arrived and Dean was beyond excited to finally dig in and eat, Castiel being particularly fond of the cheese curds.
The following morning Castiel received another email stating that Sam Winchester was interested in helping and wanted to schedule the meeting as soon as possible. And so, in two days’ time on a Friday afternoon, Castiel was scheduled to meet the alpha who may or may not be able to help him through his first full heat cycle in three years.
“He better be.” Dean turned away when he noticed another patron flagging him down and before leaving Castiel’s side, he added, “Be back soon.”
“Yeah…” This right here proved it all, being linked directly to Dean after speaking to Posse Magnet an hour ago? It was insane. “Shit, Becky, you were right.”
After a moment, Castiel gathered his courage and peeked past the wall and into the kitchen. He was gone, thank God. He was going to need another drink if he was going to introduce himself to a complete stranger, stat. Well, near complete.
“Not at school apparently.” Castiel ran a hand through his hair, a look of worry lining his features. Which was a bit uncharacteristic of him. “You’re right. We need to study.”
“I know what I said. I just wanted an excuse to show her off.” And as an after-thought; he added, “You’re cute when you’re flustered.”
Seeing Mathew for that last time hurt physically and emotionally. His recently scrubbed mark burned beneath the bandage wrap at the sight of him, at just how close they were together. Perhaps Mathew knew how badly it would hurt so he decided to move things along and ensure that Castiel didn’t need to be there any longer than he had to. At least he had hoped so.
Castiel flushed a little, picking at some of the fries left on his plate. “To be honest I’m not really sure. I’ve never really needed a heat partner...Well, not one from the clinic. I was in a relationship for…Quite a few years really.” He shrugged. “He was my only other partner, so the idea of having someone different is a little strange to me.”
That made Dean laugh. He shrugged his shoulders as though he were considering it and took another drink of his beer.
When Dean was no longer in view, Castiel released a breath he didn’t know he had been holding, gasping for oxygen. He stumbled back into his dorm room and shut the door.
“I’m sorry Dean. The truck crushed the driver’s side and you guys were pinned against a pole. It’s totaled.”
Dean awoke the following morning to the smell of something delicious cooking in the kitchen accompanied by a pounding headache. He groaned as he rolled over onto his back, eyes opening tentatively to gaze tiredly up at the ceiling. How exactly had he gotten home last night? The answer was quite lost on him, his brain still incredibly foggy.
Benny slouched in his chair, completely full from his meal. “I don’t know, weren’t you guys tryna be friends? Last I heard, being added on Facebook was a sign of friendship these days.” He chuckled. “Just add him Dean, play it cool and add the guy.”
Dean wasted no time in getting his things together. He stuffed everything he needed into his book bag and pulled on his jacket. “Got a hot date or something?” Sam was on a roll today, that was for sure. Dean grabbed his keys and paused at the door, his hand grasping the handle.
“Huh? Uh…No.” He let out a nervous laugh. “Sorry, just distracted.” ‘I could easily kiss him right now…’
“Okay…” Dean sounded skeptical. “But he thinks he’s talking to another person right now. He doesn’t know it’s actually me. And uh, our conversations, well, they’re not always PG rated.”
“Alright.” The man grumbled again in reply. He proceeded to write down a few things on a slip of paper and stuff it in a folder designated for work orders. “You got the keys kid?”
And now, here they were, in the same state, same town. They’d been under the same roof. Hell, Dean slept with his freakin sister! That alone was enough to warrant his death regardless of history. And yet, it angered him to think that Cas was demanding him and Anna to cease their extracurricular activities simply on his say so? He’d be damned if he was going to give into it.
“I’m still on the registry. I can decline a match if I want to, and I decided not to this time. So what?”
“It’s fine Sam.” Cas sighed. “I get it. He doesn’t feel comfortable talking to me after our last conversation so he’s reaching out from a distance. I appreciate it after all; it’s easier to keep our distance at this point.” At least it should be. After this gesture from Sam at Dean’s behest, Castiel almost wished it had been Dean himself at his door. A part of him wished he had been too stubborn to sit idly by and do nothing. But, Sam was here instead.
Castiel glared at Dean, his cheeks red with the embarrassment. “Are you making fun of me?” God, he hoped not. It hadn’t been fair. Dean had known who he was, had figured it out with that first phone call and Cas continued to make a drunken fool of himself throughout the entirety of the call. While to anyone else, the situation might have seemed comical, but to Cas, it was very real.
That last night together with his friends went by way too quickly, and before he knew it, Castiel was turning in his key to the office the following morning and saying his goodbyes. It was difficult having to say goodbye and get in his car, Charlie and Becky refusing to let him go for a time.
