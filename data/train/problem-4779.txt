“Are you OK?” Dean demanded again.
It’s the most fun Dean’s had in weeks.
“I know you will, Dean.”
“Yeah. You might as well have it anyway.”
Too perfect.
“Oh, this is Gabriel’s way of saying he hopes you feel better soon. You’re not allowed to be snarky about it; he and Uriel saved your life.”
No one commented on the ring, but he clocked them noticing it.
Gabriel, who hadn’t spoken a word, hadn’t moved an inch, and hadn’t answered his constantly trilling cell-phone, met Dean’s eyes then. The shrouded bodies of his brothers lay between them.
Days seemed to begin and end in the blink of an eye, whereas individual hours seemed stretched out endlessly until somehow entire weeks had gone by without Dean realising. He could never seem to distinguish one minute from the next, let alone figure out what month it was.
“Slipped,” she shrugged when Dean shot her a look over his shoulder.
Because Cas doesn’t know he's dating a lie. Cas could
“The deal will be struck, and the debt paid, you needn’t worry.”
Dean’s squad all exchanged worried looks when he walked past them, and Chuck opened his mouth as if to say something before Jo nudged him hard in the ribs.
“I know, I know,” Dean lingered helplessly at his side, rubbed at the tension in Sam’s back and shoulders, not knowing how to even start to try and help. “I know, Sammy. I’m going to get them back…”
“And you trust him?”
He felt good. Actually
“He’s fine, safe and sound, just beside himself about you and this little one.” Dean ran a hand over Mary’s head, admiring despite himself her soft hair, the gold curls.
Murmuring to her, Dean gently lifted his niece from her arms and tucked her little body to him. Mary was quiet, but she looked clean and warm enough in her onesie. Sam’s hazel eyes gazed back at him almost solemnly.
Ten minutes later, when everyone was in position, and Cas had finished trading glares with Michael, Dean stood up on his toes to press a kiss to his little brother’s temple.
When Dean next woke, it was properly morning, and sunlight was filtering into the room. Cas was gone from the bed, but Dean could hear the shower running. The palpable mood of finality was hanging in the air.
One item was a file, a manilla folder stuffed full of papers. The other was a ring box.
“In here,” Cas called back; two corners and down the short hallway – there he was, standing at the stove frying what smelled like onions and garlic in a pan. He looked like pure sin in an indecently tight blue t-shirt and a pair of Dean’s jeans, for some reason, that were threatening to slide right down off his hips, his dark hair rumpled like he’d been running his hands through it repeatedly.
“So, who the hell is he, and why did those Masters pricks have him?” Dean rubbed at his face before he rounded on Henriksen.
“Oh fuck,” Dean whispered. “Oh no, oh God no.”
“What was in the safe? Our team couldn’t crack it.”
He froze when Cas handed him the two things that had been inside, and all the rest of the shouting he wanted to do died in his throat.
“Who says the FBI didn’t know! Who says I didn’t! It’s hardly first-date-worthy conversation material! You spent a few hours with me and somehow knew everything about my work?! Impossible!”
Dean stared down at the band, then up at the car again. He looked back at the house, too. His house. Their house. Their house, where he and Cas had fucked last night and argued this morning. The manila folder that contained eight pieces of paper in Dean’s hand was both the only evidence that Cas had come back, however briefly, and the source of everything that had gone wrong thus far.
Dean reached around him and switched the stove element off, then pulled Cas back firmly against his own body so that he could feel how hard Dean already was for him.
Cas’ gaze hardened at the mention of his family, but Sam just carried on, “How did the Masters’ people get you?”
“I hacked your laptop and read your encrypted files once you were asleep,” Cas shrugged like it was obvious, like it was no big deal, like it was nothing that he’d located Dean’s work laptop – hidden in the back of his wardrobe in a locked briefcase – and read through confidential files. “It didn’t take long to rule out that your team had some information, yes, but not enough to be of concern to us. You were ruled out as being any sort of danger to my family.”
say,” Dean spat at him. “You ordered my fucking death, you piece of – “
“Crowley, for all his despicable sins, won’t harm them. I guarantee it,” Michael cut in.
But Jessica’s legs seemed not able to support her weight, and after helping her stumble to the door, Cas quietly asked if she would be OK with him carrying her. She nodded and seemed to drop completely as he hoisted her up easily in his arms. Raphael, who had been impassive and silent the whole time, took point again as the group scurried from the room.
“Is Sam with you, Dean?”
Cas punctuated his last words with a few clenches of his hole around the base of Dean’s cock. Dean almost came.
“Like I give a fuck about anything
“How do we know those
“I’m sorry,” Dean told him, rubbing at Sam’s shoulders, petting his cheek. His brother was in pain. But Gabriel’s were dead, and the man couldn’t touch them, would never hold them again.
Cas was already tapping in the code for the front door and flicking on the sitting room light. The primroses in their flowerboxes on the porch had all gone to seed, and Cas glanced at them as he reached a hand back for Dean.
“I’m gonna get her, Sammy. I will get her, and Jess, I swear to you. I swear to you.”
“You do not.”
of September 2017; Dean had met Cas for the first time in the Roadhouse the following day.

They swept the building easily, guns cradled but not needed, dodging around Jody’s team as they led swearing, struggling men out in cuffs.
“Cas? Are you alright? Are you hurt?”
“You can’t just show up, beg me to help you, beg me to fuck you, beg me to hold you, then swan off like it’s nothing, like it was a mistake!” Dean yelled at him.
Cas turns from his show of pretending to be preparing dinner, which he seems to be doing a good job of considering Dean knows there’s shit all in the fridge except for a few eggs, a bottle of Worcestershire sauce and half a lemon. And Dean’s precious, precious beer.
The pure betrayal in Cas’ eyes was like a physical punch to the gut, and Dean staggered a little into the doorframe; he had to let his brother help him through the door. He closed his eyes to try and block it all out as he slumped against Sam, the only thing he could think to do to try and wake himself up from what had to be just an awful, horrible, terrible nightmare.
“Oh, yeah, because being close to you, a mafia enforcer or hitman or assassin or whatever the fuck you are has worked out
Cas shook his head. “He won’t. I’ve made my position clear.”
Time passed.
“That’s enough, you two!” Henriksen snapped, hands on his hips as he took his place at the front of the room.
Sam came by a lot, more than was safe for his cover if they were being watched, but none of them had the energy to really care about that anymore. Sam brought food with him, homecooked meals from Jessica, or else an uber eats driver would knock and knock until Dean answered the door; either way Sammy made sure he ate.
“Dean, calm down.”
“Hey, baby,” Cas leans down and kisses Dean, once, twice. “I know I’m back from New York earlier than expected, but you could have cleaned up a little.”
“What will it take for him to let them go safely?” Sam begged, drawing attention back to what really mattered.
Dean supposed it didn’t. It was perhaps a little redundant now; the past few months had stripped their relationship back from all the lies and falsehoods, but his love for Cas felt as strong and simple as ever.
“They’ll grow back,” Cas gestured with his chin to the green shoots.
“Let me take point,” Cas said, as they moved out of their crouching positions. “It’s safer for you.”
“Dean Singer is the man I’m in a relationship with. Is it still a relationship if the whole thing is a lie? He… well I
“Oh, Dean...” Charlie pressed her fingers to his arm, and he ignored the long, worried glance she exchanged with Jody.
Sam bitch-faced at Dean, who took the opportunity to grab two more doughnuts and mash them together.
“That’s different!”
“Jesus, angel, how many enemies do you have?” The pet name slips out automatically before Dean can help it, and Cas looks away.
But Cas was pulling away, tapping the folder. “
“Stay, angel. Till morning at least. Let’s go back to sleep, come on,” Dean begged him.
Cas took a deep breath, the way he always did when he was trying to keep himself calm, and Dean felt another spike of rage up his spine that Cas would dare to even think that he had the right to be angry with Dean.
Dean returns it verbatim and takes a long pull of his beer to prepare himself for whatever the fuck is about to happen next.
“So, your family knew you were seeing him? But they never ran a background check?”
“I know you two have a lot to work through,” Sam’s voice was strained with tension. “But can we focus?”
, Dean? How did you know they had me? Have you been keeping tabs on me all this time?” The voice, Cas’ voice, all gravel and low; Cas’s confused eyes; Cas’s body bruised and bleeding.
can.”
Sam only roused himself once Dean had screeched the imposter Impala to a halt behind a SWAT van and a carload of Novak brothers at the designated site a few blocks from the warehouse precinct. When Dean looked over to check on him, Sam was already watching him, and Dean squeezed his hand once more.
“That was different,” Cas said barely above a whisper.
“I just have to get through this day. I can do that. It won’t be that bad,” he muttered. He pushed himself to walk out the door, deciding against walking down the stairs. The elevator would be easiest and he hoped to god that the cute guy wasn’t there. He knew he looked like a mess having not bothered to tame his hair or think about the clothes he threw on.
He saw his brother shake his head and plop down onto a light blue bean bag while reaching for the glass bong. Cas continued to stand at the entrance with an air of agitation surrounding him. Bringing up Dean was hard enough for him to do. Getting waved off by his brother did little to ease his frustration.
He stumbled into the house at half-past god knows when. It wasn’t much, a shabby two bedroom filled with a faint musty scent, soft music playing in the background. Did he just have that playing constantly? Whatever, Dean was too tired to consider anything more about his surroundings, It was all he could do to stumble into what he assumed was the guest bedroom and pass out under the protection of the soft comforter.
“It is?”
Cas restrained himself from shouting at him. It wouldn’t do any good with the state of mind his brother was in and he knew not a single word would get through to him, so he opted for the simpler route.
“What problems do you got?”
Cas paused and nearly dropped the bouquet of flowers. He’d heard these words a lot growing up from relatives and never missed the warning glare that his mother gave him right before he would respond. She didn’t want anyone in the family to know about him and he had gotten so used to the familiar response that he didn’t think twice when he said, “No. I’m always so busy. What with work and all.”
“It's not my fault your apartment complex is so shitty.” Balthazar’s response was muffled by the linoleum steps.
“Goodnight Dean.”
Get ready to listen to some classic rock. For this chapter, I recommend listening to Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison. It really fits the mood and it is what inspired this scene. I know this chapter was a bit late. I had a bit of trouble getting onto some wifi, but happy belated Christmas! and we hope this chapter brightens your holidays :)
“But you’ll accept one from a stranger?” Balthazar asked in a flat voice.
“Don't call me that! You're so fucking annoying. I'm trying to help you but I swear I will leave you down here.” Cas managed to get his arms out in front of him. Regretting the lack of muscle but hopefully, he could at least escape because now he really was starting to feel like he was being crushed by Balthazar.
“He left you. Left you all alone, didn’t he? Well, he's surely not going to come back for your crybaby ass,” Jorge taunted. One of his hands were pulling on Cas’ zipper. Castiel couldn't move. His limbs felt as heavy as lead. His mind strung out and tired.
“So what are you thinking?”
"Do you know what happened to Barney?”
Dean was so incredibly done pretending to be okay.
“Bro…” Dean said.
“What about a nice fellow? I’ve got a grandson about your age.”
Scanning over the rest of the text for the second time, Cas felt no urge to delve into what happened. He didn’t want to remember, let alone tell Dean about it when he had been the one to leave the second Cas approached the subject of emotions. He didn’t want to see what Dean’s reaction would be to what he had gone through.
Cas scrubbed his hands against his face. His fingers running along the cut across his cheek. A low hiss escaping him as the wound seemed to burn against his fingertips. When he pulled his hands away from his face, he saw that there was a small smear of blood on his index finger. Fucking great, he thought before clenching his teeth once more as he got up from the bed. His knees and legs screaming out in protest, causing him to nearly collapse back onto the bed. He was able to stop himself from falling when his hand grasped the corner edge of a nightstand. Cas took a few steadying breaths in hopes of gaining control of his pain. Having to grind his teeth together to stop any sounds from escaping his mouth. The last thing he wanted was to alert Balthazar when all he’d done was try to stand up.
“Don’t!” He shouted. Scrambling over to the open archway in the kitchen. Edging closer to the living room.
Jesus, this kid didn’t beat around the bush.
Castiel could see his brother wasn’t going to budge an inch.
, Cas thought. Right now he was content to keep talking with Dean. He didn’t know why thinking or even talking with Dean caused a smile to lift his lips or create a flight of butterflies in his stomach, however, Cas wasn’t opposed to the sensation. For the first time, he was starting to feel happy again. Something he didn’t think would happen for a long time, so he settled for enjoying the feelings that came with Dean without putting much thought to it. Cas always messed things up when he put too much thought into something. Dean’s voice carried him out of his musings.
“That’s the understatement of the century. His fuck up ended up landing me in government care.”
“I’m so glad to be home,” said Cas. “This is exactly what I needed.”
A medium sized dresser, that was opposite of the side of the bed, was centered on the far right wall. A desk was placed at the head of the room. To Cas, the bedroom felt overall bare to him and almost foreign. Memories from the day before had yet to take place in his mind, having already repressed many of the events, but the barrier he had put up wouldn’t hold forever. He did remember breaking down in front of his brother and acting foolishly. He, however, did not remember completely what had happened before being taken to this house. A flash here and there of something fuzzy and hardly clear enough for Cas to get a grasp of what exactly had happened to him. Part of his mind refused to think back. Almost as if it wanted to protect itself from reliving last night’s horrid nightmare.
“Couldn’t imagine living on the streets... That’s so fucked up, two years isn’t long enough for something like that. God, I’m sorry Dean. He’s an asshole for what he did.”
They stood like that for a couple minutes. Cas looking ready to flee at any indication of movement and Balthazar with his arms held out and his expression one of anguish.
“Because he said he was sorry,” Cas argued even though it sounded like a weak excuse.
“Stop bullshitting me, Balthazar. Why the hell would Dean bother coming over anyway?” Cas couldn’t help but interrupt. The very idea of Dean wanting to see him sent a thrill through his body before being followed by a churn of his stomach.
“And you would know what he looks like, how?”
“We are, but I haven't seen him. It’s complicated.”
His mind flew with emotions when his eyes looked at the heart. He felt almost rooted to the spot when he saw it. Cas didn’t know how to feel. It was all mixed up in the excitement that Dean had responded at all to his last text. He nearly let himself to begin overthinking it until he remembered how Dean reacted the night of the incident. It wasn’t too long ago. He was being too fast, too hasty. His mind was all too happy to carry on with fantasies. One of which involved Cas finally seeing Dean. There were so many scenarios… He couldn’t let himself get carried away, though. They were supposed to be friends. No matter how quick his pulse raced when seeing the tiny heart on the screen, he refused to mess up again. Dean could’ve not meant to send the heart and just didn’t notice. Although the thought sent a feeling of a heavy rock sinking down in his stomach, he had to remain logical.
Hearing his own name on John’s tongue again seemed to wake him up.
“Getting pretty defensive. Hey, when are we going to get to your apartment? I wanna take a nap,” Balthazar said, sounding every bit like a small five year old who’d stayed up way past their bedtime.
“I’m sorry. Some rough stuff is happening in my life right now.”
Just as he thought himself ready to take a few steps towards the door and get to a bathroom, a loud vibration noise came from behind him, making Cas turn suddenly around. His rib ached dully in protest to the quick movement, causing Cas to wince and instinctively reach for his side. When he looked down at the table, he wanted to smack himself. It was only his phone alerting him of a text message. Cas nearly ignored it. Meant to turn back around and go back to making his way to the bathroom, but something made him reach down and pick up the phone. He swiped his thumb against the lock screen and went to the text notification. It wasn’t a number he recognized and he almost set his phone back down when he caught sight of the words beneath the bar that read the phone number.
“He died along with my mother. It was my dad’s fault, he was driving wasted. I was 17.”
At this point Dean realized the tear rolling down his face. He quickly wiped it away and set his guitar back on the stand.
“Certainly not the type I would day-dream about,” he said, still chuckling.
Dean smiled and shut off his music.
“Bye John.”
“Just replacing the timing belt.” He thought that maybe just this once she would take the hint and leave him alone. No such luck.
“Because once you’re as high as I am, you can’t even smell it, little brother. I thought it was just some shitty weed too, but the dealer was right, it gives you the best high that no other weed has ever given you before. Just try it Cassie, and you’ll see for yourself.” His words came out slow and elongated. It made it difficult for Cas to listen to him without feeling the urge to smile or laugh. And he was still a tinge bit upset with his brother lending out his contact information to Dean.
Cas shook head, knowing his brother wouldn’t leave him alone about Dean. Part of him didn’t care about what Balthazar thought. The other part of his mind only seemed to care about how Balthazar perceived Dean. Balthazar hadn’t talked to Dean. Didn’t know his character at all, so what right did Balthazar have to judge him?
“Please. I won’t apologize if you don’t want to listen to me, but don’t leave the house like this.”
“It’s just something I was trying to learn the chords to, but thanks.”
Dean flopped on the bed and sighed. It had been a long day at the shop and he was beat. That’s when he heard it for the first time; the crying through the wall. His first thought was that there was no way in hell he would get any sleep with these paper thin walls. He briefly wondered why the person on the other side of the wall was so upset. He also wondered why he hadn’t checked if he could hear everything his neighbors were doing before moving into the apartment a couple weeks ago. After a half hour of loud sobbing dean buried his head under his pillow and settled into a sound sleep.
“So what if it is?”
“Just hope it’s not something you regret later,” said Balthazar. “And don’t be mad at me later either. I tried taking your phone away and you got pissy.”
“I knew you’d come to your senses.” Castiel let himself be lead outside to Jorge’s car. The frigid, chilly air did little to snap Cas out of his drunken haze. He clung to Jorge tightly, due to the fact that his feet refused to walk in a straight line. They made it to Jorge’s faded black Prius. Cas nearly falling to the ground when Jorge removed his arm that had been wrapped around him, to open the passenger car door.
“I hope that goes well for you.”
********
“Looking forward to it,” He meant to say more, but he was cut off by harsh coughing. His body shook until the fit ended and he was able to take a deep breath. “God, I hate being fucking sick. I feel so gross. Maybe the old lady was trying to give me a date out of sympathy because of how terrible I look. I mean I feel like I'm anything but sexy right now. Probably figured I needed help.”
Eric stared into the distance for a second, thinking. “Well I was making out with this guy Castiel last night and he gave me blue balls, does that count?”
“You honestly think I wanted to be taken against my will? That I purposely sought out to be trapped and wanted my brother to go through the hell that he did to come to save me? I know where I would be without Balthazar, you don’t have to tell me, but I have a right to be pissed when someone tries to manipulate me with my own faults. How would you like it, Dean, if I used every mistake you made against you in an argument? Better yet, someone, you trusted? No, you don’t get to be pissed at me for how I feel.”
“Shut the fuck up.” A chill went up Castiel’s spine. His heart raced with fear when the last of the feeble light drained from the room as Jorge shut the door. He couldn't escape. Trapped inside the room like a caged animal. Cas tried to scoot up the bed, but clammy cold hands clamped down onto his ankles.
“Yeah, I uh, I decided that being home was the best place for me right now. Plus, I need to get back to a routine, you know, and to start working at the flower shop again.”
“And suddenly that makes everything okay again? Castiel, you’re smarter than this. Yes, he said he was sorry. That should be expected. Nothing in that text comes off as something you need to respond to. He says he feels bad for what he did? Then let him. Maybe the next time someone opens up to him, he won’t just fucking walk away.”
“Well I could do that, then you would have me all to yourself.”
“D-Dean,” Cas whimpered. Not meaning to speak let alone utter Dean’s name but his thoughts were in a frenzy.
“My brother Balthazar interrupted us before anything could really turn into a one-time thing. I kinda can’t talk to him again since I don’t have a way to contact him. I’m worried about ever going to the bar with Balthazar again and getting horrible sexual pickup lines thrown at me. I’m starting to think I must be really ugly because only guys with really bad pickup lines try to hook up with me or complete and total assholes like Jorge.”
“Wow, you should show me how to do that. I’m sick of doing all the easy jobs like changing the oil”
“Oh, well ya know this really nice old woman comes in today and I start gathering up the flowers she wanted and she says somethin’ about me being handsome and how a nice young woman will snatch me up. So I rattle off an excuse that I’m too busy at work for such things and you know what she says to me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel felt a role of disbelief wrapped in rage sweep over him. He wanted to think that it was just the pot settling in and was messing with his hearing. Wanted to believe that his brother had not just said those words. Gave it to him out of pity? He felt his hands begin to quiver as he quietly seethed with anger. How could his brother do that to him?
“Um, hey Dean.”
“No, Cas, I think we ought to talk,” Balthazar said sternly. His brother had nearly been flat on his ass with how stoned he’d gotten, and yet in a split second, he appeared as sober as the day he was born. His gaze set on Cas’ face.
Balthazar went to respond but stopped. A puzzled expression crossing his face then more laughter bubbled out of him.
“Listen, I’m really freaking sorry for running out on you like that. I just haven’t had anyone open up to me in a long time and I didn’t know how to react and I’m really stupid.”
Holy shit.
“Did you know that people can also go to heaven?”
“He did go to jail, 2-year sentence. Not long enough. By the time the charges went through I was 18 anyway so I didn’t go into the system, I just couch surfed and lived on the street for a while.”
He’d only seen the guy once— was it twice? — and he hadn’t been in the best of moods on either occasion. Cas didn’t feel like adding a third time of him appearing as if he’d just rolled out of a dumpster to the guy’s memory. It was silly of him to even be fretting about what the guy thought. Who was he to him? Absolutely nothing, but damn did he look fine each time Cas saw him. Maybe, if Cas saw him again, he would ask for his number. Just not today of all days.
Two hands smacked down onto the counter. Cas jumped in his seat at the sound and wasn’t prepared for the amount of rage that was rolling of his brother. He shrank into the bar stool as Balthazar shoved himself out of his seat and quickly walked over to him. He didn’t have enough time to move off the chair and make an escape. Balthazar was already inches away from his face. Cas wanted to look away from those glowering eyes, but he was stuck in a trance of fear and shock.
“Shut up,” Cas grumbled. Moving over to a bean bag, he clumsily sat down onto it. There just never was a graceful way to sit on one of these things.
Cas heard him moving around and after a few seconds the starting of a guitar riff.
“No, it’s awesome.”
“I don’t want to get stoned, Balthazar. I want to know why you gave out my phone number to Dean without my knowing and then didn’t even bother to tell me that you gave it to him,” Cas said, not bothering to keep out the edge of anger that had crept up into his voice. His brother remained unfazed.
“What can I say? Every man has his kinks.”
“I'm going to pretend that I didn't hear that come out of your mouth. Consider yourself lucky and stop being a little bitch about this.”
“Hm, getting set up by his grandma sounds like a real winner.”
“Balthazar?” He called out over the music.
“So you’d look into a guy’s eyes and say, let’s put the x in sex?”
“Well the cough does give you the gruff sexy voice”
“And soon I’ll corrupt you to classic rock.”
“Hey... are you okay?”
“Tall. He’s gotta be tall but not be a bean pole either. There has to be some muscle there, ya know, and I don’t know I guess he’s got to have this confidence about him. Something in the way he smiles like he’s up to no good. I suppose a bad boy rebel vibe. A ruggish attire. Not clean and pristine. I feel like I’m makin’ an add for the paper or somethin’,” Cas joked, shaking his head and feeling embarrassed. “What’s your type, Dean?”
“True. What’d he call you for?”
“Well, I’m going to go ahead and open up.”
“It's hard to explain.”
“Sure you do,” Castiel replied tiredly. His main goal was getting Balthazar past Dean’s apartment without waking him up. He couldn’t imagine what Dean would think if he heard or even saw him carrying a half-drunk guy into his apartment.
“You what?” Jorge asked before quickly cutting off Castiel. “Doesn't matter. I hope you've learned your lesson. I'm the best you're ever going to have and next time I won’t be so generous in taking you back.”
Dean did a half chuckle, wondering what the hell Cas was talking about. It was probably best not to know anyway.
“Yeah, I’m here. What’s up?”
The body. John doesn’t--
“You replied didn’t you?”
It was only a few seconds after Cas released the smoke he’d been holding down in his lungs that he began coughing. His throat burned dully with each grating cough that couldn’t be contained and his eyes started to water with the force of his hacking.
“Just has to buy me dinner first since I’m a class act an’ all," Cas said, chuckling a little before continuing on to say, “Ah, but I could never actually do that. I’ve got eyes for someone but every time I see them it’s never the right time.”
Thank you all so much for reading! I hope you've enjoyed this newest chapter and as always feel free to comment and let us know what you thought. My co-writer and I had a lot of fun writing the last conversation between Dean and Cas before the chapter ended, so we hope you guys got some laughs out of it too :)
“What happened to your brother? I remember you mentioned him once.”
Cas debated on which gif he should send and settled on Bashful, one of the seven dwarfs, blushing and saying thank you. It was a good portrayal of how he looked now.
“Please don't,” Cas spoke weakly. His throat had gone as dry as a desert.
A few shots later, Castiel’s vision was beginning to get fuzzy. The room swayed whenever he turned his head to scan his surroundings. His heart leaped when he caught sight of a familiar dark-haired man, who was also sitting at the bar. Cas’ attention was captured by the stranger. He’d seen him back at the apartment complex in the elevator. Cas had wanted to talk to him but because of Balthazar, he had been in a hurry to get to the flower shop. He hadn't had time to stop and chat with anyone.
The conversation had been short, although that was Dean’s fault. John had said that he had something to tell him and dean hung up. He didn’t want to talk to him, not after what he had done to his mother. Still, Dean was a little curious about what John had wanted to say.
Cas blinked a couple times, stunned that Dean was still going along with this. He knew that Dean wasn't really serious. He had heard the teasing in his voice, but just hearing those words...Cas had no idea what to say back. Should he keep fooling around or put it to an end? He decided that this was all meant in good fun. It wasn't serious.
The process of getting home was a slow and steady one. He avoided the busy roads, maybe once or twice pulled over to avoid throwing up in his car, and courageously fought his way through a grocery store to pick up Nyquil and Advil, before mustering up enough energy to make it across the parking lot and to his apartment building. He passed the mailman on the way in.
“I’m sorry too. I’ve been waiting all this time for you to come back and now here you are and I need to go and act like a dick. I’m probably not the best authority to tell other people that they’re being distant anyway. I just know that if my brother was still around I would hope he could understand if I was was a bit overprotective.”
He took a deep breath and prepared himself to either turnaround and see that McHotpants had already gone on his way or if he were still somewhere in the lobby. It was a toss-up for which he was wishing for more. He gritted his teeth against yet another dizzy spell. Okay maybe he wouldn’t talk to the guy, but he had to be able to at least wave and smile for christ’s sake.
“Sorry boss, traffic you know.”
I know it's been a while since the last update. I hope you guys are still with us and enjoyed this new chapter. We get to know more about Dean! I personally loved this Dean chapter because we get to learn more about him and we see little Sammy. I find him so adorable. So, let us know what you thought and perhaps how you felt about newcomers John and Sammy. Thank you for reading! :)
Castiel would’ve punched his brother in the face if he’d had the ability to move his arms. Balthazar knew he had him pinned down. His grin widened with pure amusement. Cas wanted to wipe the smile off of his face but alas he couldn’t.
“No, I really don’t. Honestly, though I would trade that problem for most of mine any day.”
“I sent him a text, Balthy. What do you have to say to that?” Cas asked in his slow way of speaking. His eyelids drooping closed with tiredness.
That got him to leave.
Cas gave him an impatient look before saying, “Yes, and now he’s responded and I don’t know what to say. He said he was sorry and—” Cas stopped short when Balthazar held out his hand for the phone. “What?”
He saw Balthazar reach out for him, but he managed to step out of his grasp.
, Cas typed.
Cas refocused when he heard Balthazar loudly singing out of tune. He decided to get up and see if he could stick a spatula into his brother’s mouth to get him to shut up and then maybe help out with breakfast. He looked down at his phone one last time. Three little dots were now present on the left side of the screen.
“Don’t get your panties in a twist. I’ll tell ya about Dean, alright? When I went over to your place to get you some clothes and stuff, he came over and I think he was expecting to see you and—”
“Well, that was the first time we’ve talked in eight years if that gives you any indication.”
“Samson, come here.” Dean sat down on the sagging couch and patted the seat beside him for Samson to come to sit down.
“Yeah, sorry, thanks for letting me know.”
His mind drifted to Samson giggling and climbing over the play equipment with the other kids. Maybe he needs to let the past be the past. This John was not the same John that got into the accident. He wasn’t the same man who let his anger stalk the halls like a hungry wolf looking for any life to consume and who drank to try to fill in the gaps in its stomach.
“And only if they are worthy will they understand the reference.”
“Well, it’s just a bit awkward not knowing the name of the person that I just spilled my personal problems to. Guess that’s my own fault though, isn’t it?”
“Look, I’m not the biggest fan of your brother, but I’m glad you have someone looking out for you. It might seem like a pain in the ass to have someone care so much, but when it’s gone you’re going to miss it, trust me.”
“Get the fuck off me, right now.”
Fun fact about that spider scene, it actually happened to me and that experience led to the inspiration of this chapter. Hope you guys had as much fun reading this chapter as I had writing it. Please comment/like if you enjoyed this.
Castiel fought back a scream. His mind racing with fragmented ways to knock Jorge out so he could escape. His broken, jumbled thoughts only went back to the one person he needed right now. Who he knew could save him.
“Fine,” he said. “I suppose after all you’ve been through, you deserve to relax, and if getting a bit high is the way you want to do it, who am I to tell you no? Just promise me that you’ll come to me when you’re ready to talk.”
Dean paced around his apartment wondering what exactly he should do with himself. He briefly visited Samson after work and that made him feel a bit better (despite John being in just the other room). He didn’t feel like he could talk to Eric, and it was Stacy and Viv’s date night so he couldn’t go hang out with them either. Eventually, he settled on absentmindedly strumming at his guitar. He started with a couple beginner tunes, singing whatever song came to mind. Eventually, he settled on singing a song his mother used to hum sometimes as she tended to her flowerbeds.
He sent the message with a flurry of emotions inside him. None of which he gave attention to. It’s just Dean, he told himself. Maybe it’s just because of everything that happened. Cas left it as that and resumed doing what he had been doing before which was thinking of McHotpants. How would it go again? He would take me in his arms and hold me close, leading me to the couch where tea would be waiting at the table. I would snuggle close to him—
Carefully making his way down the stairs, Cas held onto the railing tightly. The skin stretching across his knuckles turning an unhealthy shade of pale white. He managed to only make a muffled grunt when he took the last step off the stairs. Down here, the smell of skunk was unbearably stronger and Cas could also smell a tinge of something floral. It smelled like the family bathroom during Thanksgiving, and Cas had to laugh a little at that before going back to wondering what Balthazar could possibly be doing.
“You’re right...I’m so sorry for bringing all this bullshit on you. I’m twenty-five, I should be able to handle this better. I don’t know why I went to a damn bar other than I couldn’t stand to be surrounded by silence. That wasn’t me. I don’t do that because this is exactly what my mother does, and yet...fuck I can’t keep doing this. Balthazar didn’t say anything that wasn’t true and it pissed me off. And now I basically just had a tantrum. I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Aw come on Cassie, stop being a sourpuss,” Said Balthazar. Not even attempting to move off his brother.
“I dooun’t want yooou,” Cas slurred. Attempting to push himself away from Jorge, but only managing to stumble back into a wall. Panic was the first strong emotion to break through Cas’ clouded mind. Next was fear when Jorge advanced towards him with a sinister grin on his face.
“Do you really want to listen to my bullshit problems?”
Cas heard a door shut from out in the hallway and figured it must’ve been Dean coming home, so he sang out the next line of the song. “Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak. I can't seem to stand on my own two feet” To his surprise, he heard Dean’s voice join in and Cas forgot about singing the next line.
“Stop. I don’t want to hear this.” Cas’ body was beginning to tremble with resentment towards Balthazar for bringing up Jorge and using him as a weapon to win a fucking argument. He didn’t care to be reminded of his past mistakes. He didn’t care to be yelled at like a naive child.
He just wanted to get his mail and hightail it to his place. No one was close by when he walked up to the beige rows of mailboxes. Cas did his best to not breathe through his mouth too loudly. How was it that a few steps could make him feel so winded? A roll of nausea overcame him for a moment that slowly passed when he let his head rest against the cool metal of his mailbox. He briefly imagined how he must look like some crackhead having withdrawals. He felt too sweaty in his t-shirt and jeans.
“I have no idea man. I don't remember how I got here.” Cas could barely understand the garbled words. Balthazar’s body shook with laughter. Cas felt the stirrings of a headache beginning to take shape.
(See the end of the chapter for
Balthazar chuckled loudly into Cas’ ear before he slowly staggered his way off of his younger brother. Swaying only a little once he’d gotten to his feet. His hands grabbing for the rusted metal railing behind him, to help steady himself.
“I might just run into Dean if I did that.”
“I'm all shook up. Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay”
“Yeah, just a wall away.”
He put his phone in his pocket and sighed. He had to tell Samson. He couldn’t wait anymore. It wasn’t fair to him, but he didn’t know where to start.
“I’m not sharing my bed with you.” Castiel’s protest fell on deaf ears. His brother’s loud snores were already filling the room. He’d have to sleep on the floor or squish his way onto the bed. The latter of the two seemed more exhausting. He thought of the sleeping bag that he had stuffed away in the tiny hall closet. For one night, it wouldn’t be too terrible to sleep on the floor. Cas glanced over at Balthazar, knowing deep down that he was glad to have his brother here in his room rather than having him driving home in the condition that he was in.
Dean suddenly felt deflated, all of the anger rushed out of him and curled into the wall separating them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure you look just fine. I mean, you must have fallen from heaven because you sound like an angel.”
A tremendous chill racked up his body while he was standing at his stove making tea. He felt disgusted by the thin sheen of sweat, as it gleamed under the fluorescent lights. Could his body not make up its mind? Cas grabbed the closet blanket off his bed and huddled into it. He finished off pouring honey into his cup of tea and shuffled to his bed. He didn’t know if Dean had gotten back yet, he wasn’t sure if he should’ve been playing this record knowing what song was on it and if it had been a good idea to have it be heard, but Cas felt it described his mood. He even started to hum along a bit.
“That him again?” he asked dryly.
“But if I do it then that means I’m making you get up on the pole too. It would be a shame to have only one of us fully nude.” Cas wasn’t sure where this was coming from. He also couldn’t seem to stop himself from saying these things. He blamed it on the fever for his lack of filter.
“A guilt trip is not what I need right now, Balthazar. I realize it was hard for you to care for me when mom and dad separated. It was hard on all of us and I appreciate you always being there for me and continuing to still be here, but I really can’t talk about what happened. I need time Balthazar, please. I’m not saying I won’t ever tell you the full story, just not right now. Right now I just want a few laughs with you. Can you do that for me?” Cas knew he had put his brother in a hard place. He was forcing his brother’s hand and he was well aware of it, but he had no choice because the second he even started to think of that bar, he could feel the wall begin to crumble. It was weak enough as it was due to the mentioning of Dean.
“You’re pissy,” Cas said with all the maturity level of a five-year old and rolled onto his side while giggling.
“Yup.”
There was a short silence.
“Because he acted like a complete fucking douche and it’s great that he feels sorry for it. Points to him for acknowledging his stupidity. That doesn’t mean you go and forgive him. That you go on to have a conversation. I don’t want you to get hurt again because
*********
“Trust me, I know what it’s like to lose someone. It helps to find an outlet.”
“Don’t go too far back inside the closest. I don’t wanna have to go in there and drag your ass out,” he said with a chuckle of his own. This was the first time he ever heard Dean get flustered. Serves him right. Shouldn’t have confused me, Cas thought while closing his eyes.
Okay, this is a good start.
“You must have a crush on him! Are you blushing little brother?”
“And how can you know that for sure?” Balthazar said with anger rising in his voice.
“Wrong it was hot. Do you need some ointment for that burn?”
Cas started laughing. Why couldn't have Dean flirted with him when he wasn't sick? Though he had to admit, it made him feel less like crap. Even if Dean was just messing around. He could play along.
An hour passed when it got to be too much. Cas was pretty sure that he had a fever now. He couldn’t tell because his entire body felt hotter than a summer day in July. No amount of medicine made his sore throat tolerable. He felt dead on his feet and all he wanted was to be held while wrapped in a blanket. Being wrapped up in a blanket while lying on a lumpy mattress would have to do. Cas didn’t see anybody willing to hold him and if he let his fantasies carry on he would begin to wonder how good it would feel to have Hottie McHotpants’ arms holding him. Now that’s The life. He grinned lazily at the day-dream. Yeah, it sure would be great. He would be there at my apartment waiting with a pot of soup and our favorite record would be playing. He would take me in his arms and—
It's called All Shook Up.
“Dean, it’s Dean.”
“No I really do, Cassie. Why do you like Dean so much?”
Cas figured that he could attempt to get his attention and damn near slipping off the stool when he tried to give a slight wave towards the guy. The man grinned in amusement before his attention focused back on the bartender. Castiel cursed under his breath, knowing he’d made an idiot of himself. He thought of going home while he could still walk, but his gaze locked onto the one person he didn’t expect to see. All common sense left him when he got up and walked up to the person. He didn’t wait for them to say anything. His emotions were scrambled but what he craved the most was to have someone love him. To not be left alone in a room tonight. Castiel wrapped his arms around Jorge’s neck, kissing him forcefully.
“Mr. Winchester?”
“No, but I’ll do it anyway.”
“Uh huh, and how different is Dean really from Jorge? You thought you knew Jorge too. You swore to me that you could trust him. Yet here we are and you’re still making the same dumbass mistakes for another guy that you haven’t even seen!”
Samson nodded again. “Daddy flushed him down the toilet, and he swimmed to fish heaven.”
When he woke the following morning, Cas’ entire body ached as if he had gotten trampled by a herd of elephants. The simple act of rolling over became a trialing act of overwhelming agony. His mind couldn’t focus on anything other than the burning sensation in his bones as he stretched his legs over the side of the mattress. Eventually, he was able to gather up enough strength to sit in an upright position, rather than in the hunched state he had been in. Gritting his teeth against a flare of pain that went up to his ribcage. For a moment, he was able to push aside the aches in his body and take in his surroundings. Having forgotten that he wasn’t at his own apartment, but was indeed in a guest room at his brother’s house.
Fine. He’d tell him later, just not now.
Once he had found the bathroom, being only across the hall and two doors down, Cas bandaged up his cheek after cleaning up the bit of dried blood and slowly made his way out back into the hallway. Always aware of the pain that each step brought to his joints, but now it was safely muted in the back of his mind. As he drew closer to the end of the hallway, Cas started smelling a skunky scent. The smell only growing stronger as Cas kept walking until he hit the landing of the staircase. He could hear the faint sounds of music being played from somewhere downstairs. The flight of stairs would be murder to his aching legs, but Cas wanted to know what Balthazar was up to and to ask his brother why he had gone and given Dean his phone number in the first place.
“Who do you think of when you have such luck?”
“I’m thinking that we should have lunch. There’s this place close to where I work, it’s called The Sunrise Diner.”

Hey guys, I know it's been a while since our last update, but we're back for the summer and updates will become more consistent. I need to send a shout out to my dad who helped sapphic_writer and I when we had to write the car scene in this chapter. He picked the car and year for us and any mechanical car issues that Dean and his employees deal with at the shop. The pronunciation of the character name Ligeia is Lye-JEE-uh.
A song to listen to while reading this chapter is: Let's Put the X in Sex by KISS. A special thanks to the writers of Twist and Shout, Gabriel and Standbyme, for we pay homage to the line, "I can dig Elvis."
“Maybe I'll just talk through the walls and whoever replies is the psycho you’re talking to,” Balthazar said starting to laugh. Clinging to Cas for support. Being this close to his brother, Castiel could smell the scent of marijuana on his clothes.
“So, what should I text back?”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
“You’re stressing yourself out over someone that’s not even worth it. It just sounds like someone that wants to cover their ass and he did a fine job of that. Leave it be, Cas,” Balthazar said sternly. He rose up from the bean bag and headed out the door. “Breakfast is ready if you want to eat.”
“Well, we all have those one time things. Just don’t talk to him again.”
“It’s just been a crazy day. How are you?”
Cas shook his head, not wanting to deal with this. Balthazar had called him around 2:30 in the morning, demanding that he come down to help him up the stairs. Cas hadn't understood what his brother’s problem was until he came down to witness Balthazar’s idiocy first hand. What Castiel couldn't figure out was how Balthazar had completely broken the damn stairs by falling on them.
Cas played around on his phone and didn’t have to wait long for a response.
It wasn’t but a few seconds later, towards the time that Cas started to put his phone into his back pocket, that his phone buzzed again. With a quick glance at the screen, he read,
“Fuck man. What parent does that to their kid?”
“I would still lo- I would still care for you even if you were blind and brain damaged. You’ve become a very good friend to me, Dean. That’s what I was going to say. You’re the one that pulled me back out of a dark place,” Cas couldn’t control the words spewing out of his mouth. It wasn’t that he was lying. It was the mere fact that Cas hadn’t meant to make himself so vulnerable. He had only meant to tell Dean that he was a good friend, and fuck, Cas nearly told Dean that he loved him. Cas didn’t know if that bit was true. He’d only just started talking to Dean, and they hadn't even seen each other face to face. But I do care for him, Cas thought. He knew that to be true, but….but what? He sat there in a whirl of emotions, trying desperately to place a finger on what exactly he was feeling and how he felt about Dean. Maybe it's because of how much he's helped me. It's simply gratitude I’m feeling, He worked this thought around in his head. It seemed to fit. It was only natural after all, especially since Dean was the one that had sat down and listened to him. No one had done that. He’d only meant to express his gratefulness.
“That's very tempting, Dean. Maybe another time when I'm not sick and there isn't a wall between us.” He let out a yawn and thought of how inviting his bed looked right now. The butterflies in his stomach had calmed and the day’s events had left him exhausted. “Goodnight Dean.”
Castiel pressed down on the button with the arrow pointing up. The soft glow of the light illuminated off of the outline of the arrow. Balthazar leaned heavily against the wall. Cas swore that if his brother passed out, that he’d leave him down here to sleep off whatever the hell he was on. It didn’t come to that thankfully. They managed to get into the small elevator, and onto the third floor without incident. Balthazar slung his arm around Castiel’s shoulders when they were halfway down the hallway.
“You know that you’re pervier than Dean, right?” Somehow this felt like a justifiable response. It had sounded a lot better in Castiel’s head.
This chapter takes place at the same time as Dean's chapter.
Cas scanned over the sentences with a goofy grin on his face. He didn’t bother fighting autocorrect or the fact that he couldn’t use the letter A, and he also didn’t bother to think of scrapping the message altogether when maybe he would’ve if he were sober. He wasn’t in the right state of mind, though, he was gleefully stoned, and his text didn’t appear to be too bad. At least to him, it didn't seem that way. Just as his brother looked over his shoulder towards him, Cas’ thumb hit send.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“You know, that little crush of yours would be really cute if it wasn’t for a crazy serial killer.”
“Soon. Don’t you dare pass out on me.”
I know this chapter turned dark, but don't worry it's going to be alright. Jorge is going to get what's coming to him soon. So, let us know what you thought of this chapter and thank you for reading! :) Chapters may start updating less frequently as my co-writer and I are currently heading into our first year of college, however, we do still plan on continuing with this story and so updates will still happen.
Thank you all for reading and sticking with this story! We appreciate you and love all the comments that you guys send us :)
“I would simply start the conversation with, ‘Have any good conversations through the walls lately?’ And see how they would respond. Better yet, I’d sit down here and wait for a pervy fifty-five-year-old to come along.”
For a couple seconds, Jorge was unresponsive before wrapping his arms around Castiel, eagerly kissing him back. The kiss was sloppy but hunger-filled. Desperation passed through Cas as he pressed himself closer to Jorge. Needing to feel wanted.
. What you saw. How the fuck do you think I felt?” Cas pushed back at his brother as he got up from the bar stool. He was beyond angry at having Jorge used against him. Having Balthazar describe what he had seen was enough to push Cas over the edge. The wall that he had up was crumbling faster than he could rebuild it, and behind it were the memories. Flashes of what had happened became more vivid. He could nearly feel the cold, clammy fingers clamping down onto his arms, shoving him back onto the bed.

“It matters to me because that guy could be some scary ass psychopath.”
Eric laughed. “It’s not all fun and games my friend, there are dangers too.”
“You’re welcome. That lyric ‘was it something I said or something I did. Did the words…”
“Sounds like a great suggestion.”
Thank you all so much for continuing to read this story!❤️ I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. Feel free to comment and let us know what you think :)
“For sure. Can’t forget about the black lace panties.” He was beginning to feel tired now, even though his mind was going about a million miles a minute. It had to be the medicine finally kicking in. Now it starts fucking working. Couldn’t have worked downstairs, could it? But Cas wasn’t too upset. He got to spend the night talking to Dean and that more than made up for what happened down in the lobby. He would do it twice over as long as the end result was the same, with Dean finally flirting with him. It would be a while before he’d be able to stop grinning like a fool.
“Guess I'm not the only dumbass that can't walk properly.”
“I’ll have to read it if you want me to help you. I knew this would happen and I wasn’t going to help you because nothing good comes from drunk or stoner texts, but now you’ve gotten yourself all in a panic,” he said.
“Hello. Hello? Are you there Dean?”
Cas looked up momentarily to see his brother’s look of distaste. His brows furrowed further when Castiel looked down towards his phone.
Samson threw down his iron man haphazardly, and sat down, looking up at Dean expectantly.
Castiel watched as water bubbled within the bong. His eyes traveling with the smoke as it rolled up the glass tube towards where his brother’s lips hovered. Although he had seen people get high, he’d never been one to partake in any of it. He couldn’t afford to back then. Not if he had wanted to keep his scholarships and by doing that meant late night studying for tests. He didn’t have that excuse to hide behind now though, and he found himself curious as to what the experience would be like.
Dean saw Frankie go bright red. He could barely keep from laughing. “Here’s your list for today.” He had purposefully put some of the more tedious tasks on there. Brian sighed but didn’t argue. Even though their dynamic was pretty casual as far as manager-employee relationships go, Dean was still the one signing his check at the end of the month.
He thought back to how throughout the whole day he had felt like someone who’d just been hit by a freight train, and even now his body still ached like that, but somehow hearing Dean’s voice made it more tolerable. It took his mind off of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas’ mind raced. He didn't know what to say. Only a few days ago Dean had bolted out the door, and now here he was talking about being Cas’. The very idea of having Dean all to himself both made his heart beat faster and caused him to wonder if Dean meant what he said.
“Well, goodnight Cas.”
“Dean,” it said, drawing out the 'e' for way too long. “Whatcha working on.”
Cas bit his lip as he instantly thought about McHotpants. Lord, did he really want to start describing him to Dean? He hadn’t really scored away his feelings for Dean yet. They were up in the air for all he knew. Still, he almost felt guilty for having thoughts about the guy and talking about it with Dean. It was silly of him, he knew, but it was difficult to describe exactly why it made him feel that way. He got on with it, though. What harm could it do?
Jorge let Castiel lean against the hood of the Prius, as he locked up the car. Cas resisted the urge to sleep, even as his eyelids grew unbearably heavy. He felt a bony arm wrap around his upper torso once more. Saw the blurry view of the grey sidewalk under his feet. Cas leaned into Jorge’s side but immediately felt repulsed. Jorge smelt of cheap cigars and beer. The two scents mixed together to make one overwhelming smell that reminded Cas distinctly of spoiled, sour milk.
He felt warmth bloom in his stomach like a thousand butterflies were fluttering around inside him. He was nervous, but why? It was just Dean saying hi.
Samson looked up when he said that. A blob of ketchup was clinging to his chin and threatening to drip down onto his yellow shirt. Dean handed him another napkin and went outside to finish the conversation.
“Just lookin’ for a hot piece of ass,” Cas said, amused. “God, that reminds me of the time when Balthazar forced me to go to a strip club for graduation.”
“Basically. I’m real fashion savvy.”
“That’s also the story of how I made nearly sixty bucks in one night. Balthazar had to beat the guys away, they were all so drunk and handsy. Had you been there who knows what would’ve happened. Knowing how drunk I was, a private showing would’ve been in the cards that night.”
A shiver rolled through him as the memory of how it had felt to be left alone forced its way to his mind. It had slipped past the cracks in his barrier and another chill went up his spine. He felt as if he were being engulfed by the memory. Desperate to escape the feeling, Cas held out his hand towards Balthazar. The first hit he had taken did nothing for him and he couldn’t stand to keep feeling this abandonment any longer. It was only the beginning of what had happened once Dean had left and Cas wasn’t about to relive it.
“He had no right coming in here and harassing you. He acts blindly and causes chaos, and expects me to be okay with it. Well, I’m not fucking okay with it. I’m not okay with him bulldozing his way into my problems and making decisions for me. I shouldn’t have to be concerned about whether or not he’s going to give out my information when I’ve got so much shit happening that I don’t know where to turn anymore. I thought I could trust him and he threw it all in my face.”
“Fuck Eric, what am I going to do?”
“....Very sexual.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I ain’t asking for much. I said, Lord, take me downtown, I’m just lookin’ for some tush.”
“I won’t get hurt again.”
“I'll drop your ass back on these stairs. I'm in no mood to be teased. Did you drive here?”
“You just going to stand there like a loner or come in here? There’s enough bud for the both of us.” With a swipe of his thumb, Balthazar flicked on the lighter he got from his pocket and hovered his mouth over the top of the bong while the hand holding the lighter lowered towards the weed held in the bowl.
He pulled at the collar of his shirt, trying to cool his boiling skin that managed to get even warmer under the idea that he was in the same room with the guy he had day-dreamed about.
Eric laughed. “Yeah right, and how would you even know that? Do you keep track of everything your neighbor does? Stalker.”
I know it was a long wait for this chapter but I hope you guys find that it was worth it :) Check out sapphic_writer, she writes awesome Supernatural fanfiction and she has one up right now that is fantastic. I highly recommend it for you destiel readers. She has significantly helped write this story, it would not be what it is now without her. She, in fact, helped with many ideas in this chapter including Balthazar's 'stoner' room. We both had a laugh about that one when creating it. We hope you enjoyed this chapter and please feel free to comment and let us know what you think.
Cas licked his lips nervously.
Dean chuckled, racked his brain for an Elvis song, and sang the beginning of the first one he could think of. ‘“When we kiss my heart's on fire, burning with a strange desire, and I know each time I kiss you that your heart's on fire too.’”
“Come on, Cassie,” he said. Lifting the bong out towards Castiel. “Just one little hit.”
“Oh, you’re not, daddy?”
He proceeded to show her all the steps involved while she doled out empty compliments and kept “accidentally” pressing against him and shoving her cleavage in his face. After he had finished he wiped his hands on a nearby rag before throwing it on the ground.
“She asks me ‘what about a fellow?’ and hands me a picture of her grandson. At that time I was sort of against it, ya know, it was weird, but I’d be lying if I said the guy wasn’t cute. He was easy on the eyes and all. I’m just not sure about it, but apparently next month she might drop him by the shop for him to meet me. Maybe I’ll go along with it if he matches up to the photo I saw.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean yawned loudly and laid back on his pillow. “It’s been good talking to you. Night Cas.”
, Cas typed.
“Goodbye, Balthazar.” Cas turned on his heel and didn’t bother to look back when he heard his brother call out for him to wait. He almost made it out the door when Balthazar grabbed onto his wrist and jerked him back into the house.
“Yeah…” Suddenly Dean didn’t feel like going into the more intimate details of his younger life. He felt drained from sharing just the basic facts, nevermind how he felt about them or how his father acted the rest of the time. Dean decided to do what he did best and redirect the conversation.
“Yeah, of course.” Dean watched Samson scamper off to get his batman action figure for him. He had a feeling that Samson didn’t fully understand what was going on, but he didn’t know how else to explain it to the kid, he hadn’t even processed it himself. But there was nothing else for him to do tonight, so he got down on the floor and did his best batman voice for Samson.
“Well, that’s where daddy’s gone. He went to people heaven,” Dean said gently.
“Yeah.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Close.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck. Cas heard that. Fuuuck. He wondered how much Cas had listened to and if maybe they could pretend like that whole song didn’t just happen.
He waited for a response, keeping in his nervous laughter and fidgeting with his blanket hoping he hadn't gone too far.
“How’d you even fall anyway? Better yet how is it that your foot managed to go through one of the steps?” A bit of mirth coloring Cas’ response.
“Yeah, but they don’t go to fish heaven. They go to only people heaven.”
God, that might be the first time he’s ever said that.
“Hold on a second,” Dean said.
, he thought. “There was that one time someone had me call them daddy. Caught me by surprise, I mean I wasn't used to having to be the one to say it.”
“Same.”
His options were far to none. Maybe he’s already seen it and decided not to respond. Cas could deal with that theory and let himself relax again while still reassuring himself. It was perfectly fine for Dean not to respond. Cas would explain later if he ever got the chance, but not right now. There was something about the idea of having to talk to Dean that sent a flurry of panic throughout his system. Already, now, he could feel himself beginning to grow nervous at the very idea of having a conversation with him after what had transpired between them. The embarrassment alone caused by his overreaction was enough to make Castiel never want to talk to Dean again. His mind worked over the possibility of never having to talk to Dean, and slowly he began to relax. He didn’t want to see the questions that Dean would ask. He didn’t want to have to write about what happened with—Cas took a heavy breath and refused to even think the name, but it still hung in his subconscious like a snake ready to strike—Him, his mind settled on. That would be the name Castiel would use. It was better than having to use
Dean stared down at the text on his phone. He knew he should be working on the pile of order forms and other paperwork stacked on his desk or helping Brian teach Frankie how to change a timing belt but that stupid goddamn text just kept staring him down. Cas couldn’t trust him. And the worst part was that Dean knew he was right. He had fucked up everything, in the span of a few hours he had destroyed Cas emotionally and physically. And to add to that he felt like he had betrayed Cas by sleeping with Eric like he somehow had a responsibility to save himself for Cas despite the fact that they weren’t dating in the first place. Maybe it just had to do with what Cas said, it made him feel like he needed to protect him. And the fact that Cas wasn’t even sure himself if or when he might be coming home made it even worse. Finally, Dean just typed back a simple you do what you need to do, set his phone in his desk drawer so he didn’t have to look at the damned thing, and got back to work.
It didn’t seem as if Balthazar was going to accept Cas’ words. He kept watching him with careful eyes as if Cas was going to break at any second, and as he kept searching for a sign of weakness, Castiel made sure to keep all that he was feeling hidden. It wouldn’t do to have his brother see how close he was to the edge of breaking down. After a few more seconds of silence, Balthazar seeking out a reason to deny his brother, and Cas maintaining his resolved composer, the older brother finally gave in.
, Cas thought. And as he considered the option, the image of Hottie McHotpants flickered through his mind.
“No, you’re not. Don’t believe a thing that fuckass said to you, Cas.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. No one should have to deal with that shit. People like that...they belong in jail.”
Cas accepted the humiliation that filled him. Knew that he deserved every insult that was thrown at him. He didn't bother to tell himself differently or refute against Jorge’s words. Of course, even if he had wanted to defend himself, his mind was too muddled to form a good enough defense. He felt grateful that Jorge had even bothered accepting his request.
“Loosen up Cassie. How’d you find out about that anyway?” Balthazar kept his tone light and as easy as his smile while he turned back around and made his way to the table where the bong was.
“Well you being ‘completely okay’ has kept me up half the week”
Jorge snatched Cas by the shoulders, yanking him over to the door that had a rusted metal plate over it, with a number three engraved on the cheap metal. Cas squirmed against Jorge’s grip, but his movements were sluggish. His body was giving up to fatigue. Jorge got the door open, shoving Cas inside. He collapsed onto the lumpy, old mattress. Feeling the springs dig into his sides when he turned to face Jorge.
, Cas thought. How was he supposed to respond? How would anyone respond this? He kept going over possible responses in his mind and even attempted to type out some of them, but all of them came out sounding lame. A simple ‘okay’ wasn’t something that someone would text back. ‘Hey, no worries, I’m an idiot for even saying anything’ Just didn’t seem like the best answer either.
“Dean? You alright?” Cas knew that he had overshared. He feared that he had ruined their friendship. Castiel’s pulse raced as he waited for a reply but all Cas got was the sound of Dean’s door shutting and the quick footsteps of retreat. A brief thought of Dean coming to his door crossed his mind. They’d finally meet. He’d be able to see Dean and he’d….Well, Cas didn’t know what would happen next, but all that meant the most to him was finally getting to meet Dean face to face. Except that didn’t happen. Dean never came to his door. He’d left him. Left him alone in his apartment without even a single word of warning. Cas felt his heart plummet to his stomach. All hope quickly crashing down inside of him. It left him unbearably cold. Tears began to sting his eyes. Cas attempted to hold them back but his mind flashed back to the conversation he’d had with Jorge. His words echoing in his head.
“Sleep well Cas, talk to you tomorrow.”
With a long and heavy sigh, Cas reluctantly nodded his head and walked into the room. He shut the door behind him. Taking a look around the room, he noticed the stereo system in the corner that was now playing a much softer tune than before. He also saw two pinball machines standing next to each other against the left wall. One themed as the movie from Jaws and the other of The Doors. When he got closer to his brother, he couldn’t help but see a large amount of chip bags surrounding the area from which Balthazar sat. The majority of them being Dorito bags. A half-full liter of Mountain Dew was perched near one of these bags. A box of Lucky Charms cereal laid on its side on the floor next to the table, and next to it was a bowl that only contained the rainbow marshmallows. On the opposite side of the table from where Balthazar sat was a few more bean bags. It wasn’t until Cas looked up a bit more, that he saw the many posts it notes scattered around haphazardly on the walls. Each showing a sketch drawing or boldly written letters. One of them showed a rough drawing of Mr. Clean with biceps the size of Popeye's, and underneath it read: Mr. Clean, but sexy.
“And you understand what that means?”
The door groaned open and Eric stepped outside.
“Yeah right. Put me in a pair of heels along with those panties and I could rock that better than anyone, but I wouldn’t be against seeing you in some lace.” Cas grinned smugly to himself while he heard Dean’s nervous laughter.
“Stop flailing around Castiel, get in the car.” Cas flinched at the harsh tone but hurried to get into the vehicle. Not wanting to piss off Jorge and have him leave too.
“...I just met you dude.”
They were back at the apartment now because Dean didn’t need to hide from John anymore. Already he could tell this place wasn’t going to be big enough to raise Samson. The kid was making laps around the living room and kitchenette with his iron man action figure in hand. God, he was already thinking about raising Samson, but that’s what was going to happen wasn’t it? There was no more family left, John had destroyed the rest. There was a chime from his phone.
“He was right,” Cas gasped out. He’d made himself vulnerable to Dean and he’d left him. Hadn’t wanted to deal with his sorry ass anymore. Cas had known all along that Dean hadn’t truly wanted to be friends with him. That Dean had only talked to him out of obligation and pity, but Cas had hoped that he was wrong. That Dean might’ve felt something for him too. Now he’d run out on him. Castiel wiped the tears away with the back of his hand. His body shaking terribly as if he’d been dunked into the Atlantic ocean. One clear thought passed through his mind. He could go to the bar and drink away his problems. Go to a bar and forcefully make himself forget about Dean.
Breaking away from the embrace to catch his breath, he whispered into Jorge’s ear, “Take me home.”
“It’s therapeutic.”
Alrighty, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter :) My co-writer and I are really happy with this chapter and we really loved writing it. Next chapter we're bringing in a surprise new perspective. I think you're gonna love them haha. So let us know what you thought and thank you for reading!
, he typed.
“Of a fifty-year-old smoker, maybe. I see what you're into Dean,” Cas said jokingly.
They arrived at Jorge’s apartment. Jorge parking the car in the spot that had a faded number four painted on the asphalt. Most of the lights were already out except for the spare few that lit up the sidewalk adjacent to the apartment doors. Castiel could see flecks of black appearing in his vision now. Felt the sensation of being disconnected from his body. He hadn’t seen Jorge get out of the car nor hear him open the passenger’s door but suddenly, Cas was being dragged out of his seat and back into the bitter cold.
He blinked at him and nodded his head. “Yeah, I understand. He went to people heaven.”
“I made an excuse, something about paperwork, I don’t really remember. Somehow after all this time she still hasn’t picked up on the fact that I’m gay. It’s amazing, really, when you think about it.”
“What about music?”
“‘...not come out right. Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried.’ That’s one of my favorite parts.” Dean smiled out of the corner of his mouth while hoping that Cas wouldn’t notice how much the lyrics pertained to their situation.
“I will and you just watch me.”
Cas shivered, a chill going up his spine at the idea of being corrupted to anything by Dean. His mind carried on with how exactly Dean would corrupt him with classic rock. Right about now he’d be okay with snuggling on the couch with Dean listening to one of the band's he liked. It’d be even better if Dean, by chance, looked like Hottie McHotpants.
“No, but I wish I was right now,” Castiel said with a strained voice. He turned around, phone still in hand, and said, “I think I may need your help with this one.”
After a bit of thinking on how to word out his response without coming off too hostile, Cas typed out,
“Oh jeez, I’m sorry.”
, he typed.
Cas took a good look at his brother's face, seeing the way his eyes were heavily dilated. Either he was incredibly stoned or drunk. Knowing Balthazar, he could've been both.
Cas was quick to respond.
“Well, I do listen to Elvis sometimes.”
“Well, that makes me feel less upset about being sick. I've always been into musicians,” Cas paused and wondered if he should mess with Dean.
He tapped his fingers nervously on the back of his phone trying to get out some measure of his nervous energy, but it wasn’t working. He felt his chest tighten and he was on the brink of panic before Cas replied.
“You just gave it to him because you felt sorry for him? You could’ve asked me. Hell, maybe you could have thought to tell him to mind his own business. He doesn’t care, Balthazar. He never did,” said Cas, heavy resentment ringing throughout his voice towards the end. He couldn’t hide it. He could try to block the memory, but he couldn’t hide how he felt when he was left alone. He knew he shouldn’t have opened up. Especially with how they had only known each other for a short time, Cas should’ve thought before he spoke and if he had the chance to go back, he wouldn’t repeat what he had said. Maybe then he could’ve kept a friendship with Dean. If friendship is something they even had. Cas highly doubted it at this point, but he would’ve preferred to kid himself into believing that Dean had wanted to be friends rather than find out the truth the way he had.
Dean glanced at his closet, full to the brim with flannels and levis.”I would call my wardrobe more standard.”
can’t handle a situation like a human being.”
He set his phone down and looked to the clock that showed he had a few hours left or he could always close up early. It was hitting into the slow hours anyway. His phone gave a buzz and Cas grabbed his phone, pushing away his excitement as just being happy to have a distraction from being bored.
Cas steadied himself, locked up his mailbox, and turned around not at all expecting for his eyes to get immediately drawn to the man that stood a mere few feet away from him. Their gazes locked, as the other man had been already looking at him when Cas had turned around. He didn’t know what to do. His cheeks became warmer when the guy gave him a look over, a sexy grin playing on his lips when he returned his focus onto Cas’ face.
“Are you going to join me for breakfast or keep staring down at your phone?” Balthazar’s question startled him out of his inner turmoil. He nearly dropped his phone. “Are you still stoned, man?” He heard his brother ask.
He was jerked out of his thoughts by Balthazar’s harsh coughs. His shoulders seemed to shake with the force of them and when he lifted his head to look up at Cas, his eyes were watered, and yet, the lazy smile remained on his lips as a few more short coughs escaped through him.
“It's okay, Dean. I shouldn't have...look, I don't blame you for leaving. I should've never laid so much stuff on you. And I can’t believe that my fucking brother barged in here and told you about Jor—”
“You know what you should do? Find a t-shirt that’s all rainbow colored and wear it to work every day. I nearly had a run in experience with being set up with a chick when I was working today.”
“That’s, uh, that’s a good,” said Cas, stumbling over his words, not knowing what to say. “I mean, um, good. That is good.” He winced at his response. It sounded as coordinated as a flailing seal and had the same intelligence as one. He tried to think of something else to say, ignoring the soft laughter he could hear coming from Dean. He gave up, sighing in frustration. “It’s not funny Dean.”
“I’m not sure –“ Sammy started, but Dean cut him off.
“No,” Cas murmured, and Dean’s heart sank. But before he could let him go, Cas had peeled off his sweater and was moving back onto the bed to clamber on top of him.
Cas frowned a little. “I don’t keep much of that stuff here; my weapons are where you’ll never find them. And since I know your people have already gone through the house with a fine-toothed comb, I doubt anything else is in any danger of being discovered.”
“What can I say, I like it dirty,” Dean gathers himself and sits up, shoots a nod to the guy still in the doorway. “Who’s Happy?”
“And as far as you are aware, he did not know until today that you’re allegedly the Novak family’s most prestigious hitman?”
There’s a strange tone to Cas’ voice when he calls out, “Baby, you home? I'm back!” and Dean can hear another voice with him, the two speaking in low, urgent tones.
It was just safer that way.
“He’s not one of the assholes who blew up my car, is he?”
“Dean. Please,” Cas’ murmur was both reproachful and comforting, all at once.
“Victor Henriksen,” Dean’s boss shook Michael Novak’s hand. “I’m sorry for what happened to your family.”
“Backbreaking and boring. If I see one more shredded timing belt this week, I’ll kick the owner into the Hudson. All I wanted all day was to come home to you,” Dean kept his tone bland and neutral. The last part was the truth, at least.
“Cas! Baby, don’t do this! Stay with me. Please?”
“Please don’t let go?” Cas’ whisper lingered in the warm, thick air around him, and Dean kissed the back of his neck as he dragged the sheets up around them. “Don’t let me go… Don’t let go, please…”
“Oh my God, Dean, you had me worried!”
He cooked a meal all by himself that night of steak, eggs, and chips, adding a single broccoli floret on top. He was pretty sure Sam had some sort of spidey-sense directly linked to whether Dean was consuming vegetables, and he’d been nagged enough by his brother the past few months about his eating habits.
Michael’s eyes flicked to Dean, and down to the engagement ring once more.
“They’ve tried. They usually fail.”
Henriksen let him go with an awkward pat, then promptly snatched up a pot plant from his desk and threw it at the wall with a howl of “FUCK! THOSE FUCKING, LYING PIECES OF SHIT! BASTARD ASSHOLES!”
Six hours later and Dean was curled up under a blanket on the couch in his sitting room, where he’d collapsed as soon as he’d got through the front door. He simply lay there, his gaze fixed on one of the porch beams visible through the window, trying to wrap his head around how his life had completely exploded into pieces in the space of one day.
Cas didn’t answer until he’d shut the water off and was towelling his hair dry. Dean brushed past him and started the shower again, shivering as he waited for the water to get up to temperature again.
“It wasn’t nothing. And it wasn’t a mistake.”
“I do what I have to, for the sake of my family. Are you going to try and pretend that you’ve never killed, in your line of work, to protect people, to keep your brother safe? It's the same thing.”
By way of answering, Cas surged up and kissed him, using his momentum to wrap his legs around Dean’s waist and pull him down hard on top of him.
He keeps up his cover, albeit half-heartedly; it’s almost redundant now that he really doesn’t care who comes after him or why. But spending a little spare time with Bobby and Benny at the garage is welcome distraction – drinking beer, shooting the shit, messing about with car engines, wrecking so many of his t-shirts with grease that he has to start wearing ones that Cas left behind.
“Wind’s messing up your primroses out there, baby. I’ll figure something to shield them this weekend,” Dean told him as he moved through the open-plan room, shrugging off his leather jacket and dumped it on the dining table. Cas’ phone, which lay on the counter alongside a pile of folders that were probably book reports from his students, was playing ‘Talk’ by Kodaline. Cas was singing along quietly under his breath, though he cut off with a little hum when Dean pressed himself to his back. He wound his arms tight around Cas’ torso, his fingers making a beeline for the hem of his shirt.
Cas strides straight over to Dean, and the man who’s followed him into the room must be a foe, not a friend, because Dean can tell he’s got a cocked gun hidden inside his coat.
I suck, I know.
Henriksen was in his office, looking defeated and worn out, though he tried for a comforting smile with Dean slipped in through the door.
“I got you, I got you, shhh…” Dean murmured to him.
He goes to work each weekday feeling non-corporal, imaginary, like a ghost floating down the halls. Sam bitch-faces as he comes up with a billion stupid suggestions to try and get Dean out of his funk, all of which Dean firmly rejects via eyeroll; Charlie hugs him a lot, which is nice; Jody slips whiskey into his coffee.
Dean flung himself out of the car and pelted straight to his brother, who was being restrained by Henriksen and about three officers. Sammy was fighting them with all he had, howling wordlessly at Gabriel Novak, who was white-faced as he knelt between two covered bodies lying the pavement.
Dean ignored him.
He came quicker than Dean expected him too, with just a whimper of “Baby! Oh fuck!” before Dean’s fist was coated in wet warmth. Dean leaned down so he could kiss Cas through it, thrusting his tongue into his mouth in time with his cock in his ass. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck to hold him there even once he was spent.
The ring was rose gold surrounded by black titanium. When Dean slid it onto his finger it was the perfect fit.
Cas cleared his throat. “Practically nothing, now that I think about it. And what I do know, I’m no longer certain is even true. He told me he dropped out of high school at 16 and got a job at the garage with Bobby, his uncle. I never knew much about the rest of his family, but I know he had a rough childhood, so I never pushed him to tell. I know his mother is dead and his father disappeared when he was very young, leaving him to care for his little brother.”
“Dean?” she whispered, her blue eyes wide with hope.
“Is Sam with you?” Cas’ voice was weird, strained, like his throat was too tight to get the words out properly, so he was pushing them out half-formed.
Dean noticed over Jody’s shoulder that Gabriel wasn’t amongst his brothers. Neither was the strange one who had visited Dean at the hospital, Zachariah.
They didn’t get round to eating dinner until pretty late that night.
But it couldn’t be him, it couldn’t be
The rest of Dean’s words were cut off by his own groan of delight; he let his head fall back on Cas’ shoulder as the warm hands on his chest slid down and began stroking him to hardness.
“Why is he giving himself away?” He muttered to Charlie, who’d just re-entered the room in time to hear what his brother had said.
“Listen here, asshole. I am going and getting Jessica and Mary. I can do it with your boys; I can even take a back seat and let y’all run the show. But I am getting my niece the hell out of there and away from all of you bastards, and I sure as hell don’t need your blessing to do so! You have absolutely no authority over me.”
“Why are you even here? You broke the fucking stairs and then you call me up at two in the morning because your stupid ass couldn't walk properly.” Cas had never been a morning person. Not to mention he’d been having a very pleasant dream before he’d been rudely awakened by his obnoxious brother.
“Don’t they wear make-up? A bit odd isn’t it?”
“That’s for fuckin sure.”
Dean felt his face go red.
Hey, we're back! A big thank you to all who have stuck with us and continued reading our story throughout the years. Hope you enjoy this chapter!
Balthazar merely grunted in response. Tripping up on his own two feet. They would’ve fallen had Cas not leaned against the wall. By now, they were only a couple steps away from Castiel’s door. Cas heaved Balthazar upright before he carried on walking. Quickening his pace when he felt his brother beginning to go limp. Cas hurriedly reached inside his pocket to pull out his keys, nearly dropping them, but able to keep them from slipping past his fingers. Getting Balthazar into the room wasn’t as bad as he thought until Balthazar collapsed onto his bed.
His phone chimed.
Dean let out a half chuckle. “I think the rainbows may mess up my macho aesthetic but I’m willing to try anything at this point. But what’s this about you getting set up today?”
Cas began to worry if he'd taken it a step too far. He hadn't meant for his words to come out in a romantic way, and it wasn’t until Dean didn’t respond that a wave of panic washed over him.
“He’s dead,” Samson said matter of factly.
“Goodbye Son.”
“I’m not.”
Dean blushed and knotted his hands nervously together. So he had heard that.
“Go on and talk to him then. See if you can even type an actual message,” Balthazar said with an edge of a taunt in his voice. Cas rose to the challenge.
“I don't fucking know, okay? I just tripped over my own feet and fell. Are you going to help me up or not?” Balthazar said in a snippy tone. Lifting his head to glare up at his younger brother.
There was a brief moment of scuffing sounds coming from the room and a stumble before the door opened fully to reveal his brother wearing a lazy grin. The open door also released more of the potent scent that had been the source of Cas’ curiosity. It took him two seconds to piece everything together from Balthazar’s dilated eyes to the origin of where the smell was coming from. It was a bong sitting on the table. Wisps of gray smoke were still swirling out from the top of it. Cas could just barely see it over his brother’s shoulder, but there was no mistaking what it was, not when Cas had seen his fair share of bongs and pipes at parties and dorm rooms when he’d gone to college. The only thing that stumped him was the intensity of the foul smell. He had smelled pot that had been a bit skunky or quite frankly smelt like weeks old garbage, but this weed, however, stunk of vomit and of something else that had rotted and had been overgrown with mold long ago. Why the hell is he smoking this shit? Cas wondered before he blurted out the question. Balthazar responded to his question with a lazy grin that was followed by a low chuckle.
“How dare you fucking throw that in my face! I didn’t get trapped there on my own free will. I didn’t choose to be beaten to hell. I don’t need you to remind me of what happened! All you talk about is how it affected
Cas’ eyes narrowed when he heard what sounded like disappointment coming from the other side of the wall. Was Dean interested? The sole reason he asked what Dean’s type even was, was to find out if it matched his own appearance. He hadn’t given him much to go off of, but then he hadn’t made it sound like he was serious either. He seemed interested when they’d been texting.
“He could actually read it?” Balthazar asked with a laugh.
Cas didn’t miss how Dean’s voice seemed to shift when asking the question. It was so subtle yet Cas swore he heard some inclination in it. Maybe it was just wishful thinking… It did make Cas’ grin grow wider, though, at the idea that Dean might be anywhere near jealous.
. It was a daring thought, but at that moment Cas was in full fuck it mode.
“I love you soooo much Cassie,” Balthazar slurred. Leaning more of his weight onto Castiel’s small frame.
“Well you know me, I’m Mr. Romance.”
Cheers to anyone who figures out what Cas' number spells out. It was my co-writers idea and we both thought it'd be brilliant as well as awesome if someone knew what it stood for. Comment and let us know if you were able to figure it out and what you think it stands for. Thank you again for reading! We hope you enjoyed this chapter and Balthazar :) We both really loved Balthazar's perspective and we hope you did too. Feel free to send us feedback and let us know if you're liking the story so far.
Dean settled himself on the bed and knocked three times on the wall.
Cas tried hard to keep his cheeks from heating up. He almost succeeded until an image of Dean being in a crowd of other guys watching him dance and strip on stage crossed his mind. Dean, being Hottie McHotpants, giving him that sexy smug grin as gazed at Cas. Cas wasn’t prepared to feel pleased by this idea nor the sudden rush of heat that pooled in his stomach as the image stayed in the front of his mind. It wouldn’t be going away anytime soon.
********
Cas nodded his head and accepted the bong given to him. He felt a twinge of guilt for not telling his brother the events of last night. Out of everyone, Balthazar had every right to know the full story, given that he had been the one to save him, and yet, Cas couldn’t bring himself to change his mind on not telling his brother.
“Your brother was taking care of you Cas, he gave enough of a shit to come over here and try to plow over the first guy he saw for you and to go get you from Jorge’s house and I’m sure he would do it all again. And you go and put yourself in a situation where you were in danger; you have people that care about you Castiel. Don’t you dare take that for granted. Don’t you dare throw that away.” Dean could feel his cheeks flushed, every muscle in his face wound tight as if trying to keep him from falling to pieces.
“Is that what you do all day? Seems pretty boring.”
“Classic rock mostly.”
“Oh, yeah.”
“But he’s not. Stop talking about Dean that way.” Cas felt his cheeks grow warm. He didn’t honestly know why he felt such an urge to defend Dean from Balthazar’s insults but what he did know was that he cared a great deal for Dean. He just didn’t know how to place his emotions towards Dean.
“Cas, you’re home.”
, Cas thought, pushing the button for floor one. He stood waiting for a few seconds. It turned out luck was on his side. Then again maybe it wasn’t. He didn’t catch a glimpse of the guy who he was beginning to think of as Hottie McHotpants. His cheeks burned a little at the foolish nickname. He was thankful no one could read his mind or ever know about this school-boy crush. He would rather be faced with the spider from hell again than to have his thoughts about the guy out in the open. It was much better to have those few rare looks because he didn’t have to know the truth of what that guy thought of him or if he actually swung that way. If he did he was too damn attractive to give a single thought about Cas. At least he could still look from afar.
“No, I’m working tomorrow, We can do it the day after.”
“Hm,” Cas hummed. “And I guess if I follow suit then that one fellow and I will be getting on pretty well.”
He let out a deep breath, then wrote,
“I did a ton of paperwork and boring stuff. I’m thinking of hiring someone to help advertise and run the shop. I’ve got no idea how I’m going to afford to pay them though. Oh and I don’t think I’m going to try and get in contact with the guy I met at the bar because, for one, I didn’t get his phone number and two, he seemed to be into some serious weird kinky stuff.”
The call was casual, too casual. The woman on the other end of the line had obviously been doing this too long to get emotional about it now. This was just another day for her and he was just another family member caught in the crossfire of someone else’s fuckup
“Nothin’ is set in stone. He’s not the only one keeping me on my toes. I guess I’m just like the song. I’m all shook up. Nice singin’ by the way,” he said. “We sounded pretty good together. I would like to take credit for corrupting you.”
“Of course, Mr. Winchester, and my condolences. Do you know what your father’s wishes were for the body? I don’t believe an open casket will be an option.”
Cas glared up at Balthazar. He knew Dean couldn’t be fifty-five. He also knew that it was better to ignore Balthazar but still the urge to defend Dean kept digging at him.
“Cremation I think.”
“Cas?”
Cas fought to not laugh. He had never heard such a bad impersonation of a British accent. He rolled his eyes, a witty response already forming.
Drunken Dean is the best lol Let us know what you thought and we hope you enjoyed this chapter!
“Perhaps I’ll bring him around the next time I need flowers,” She said with a wink.
“Dean? You still with me buddy?”
“You wouldn’t have to hear this if you weren’t acting like a fucking idiot. I’m not going to stand here and act like this is all okay and that everything is rainbows and sunshine when just two days ago I saw you lying on the ground, hardly conscious, and a guy that you had once trusted towering over you, getting ready to-”
Dean couldn’t bear to go into any more detail. Even just laying out that much left his head swimming in a fog.
He had missed-calls galore from his brother, and eventually remembered he was supposed to be at work. Three hours late was better than not at all, right?
“I’m fine. I just… needed to hear your voice. It’s been so long, I… I miss you so much.”
“Everything’s fine now. They can’t get to you now.”
“What the… oh, hell, Winchester… oh, fuck… that… that
“Yeah, baby... I can explain –“
It’s a relief, because it instantly answers the question that Dean’s asked himself every time he’s opened his eyes since he was four years old: is Sammy OK, is he safe?
Cas laughed, then shook his head. “Ah, no. I have no idea what I’ll do. But whatever it is, I’ll be with you. If you still want me, that is.”
“Yeah,” Cas grinned, as he pulled Dean into their home.
Cas looked down at Dean once more as he hefted his sole bag onto his shoulder, the battered leather carryall that Dean always made fun of because it looked so shabby.
Dean’s eyes flicked back to Cas in relief, “You’ve heard from him? You swear they’re fine?”
“Is that the best idea?” Henriksen asked.
“You want me to beg?” Cas gritted out, when Dean let his thumb swipe under the head a moment before he took his hand away completely.
Cas was all perfect.
“You are no less emotionally compromised than your brother. You’re also significantly more stupid.”
When Cas kicked the locked door open Dean ran straight in, even as the woman inside screamed and huddled over the baby in her arms, shielding the infant with her body.
“Duly noted. I understand your feelings perfectly. It’s an awful situation and we’re doing all that we can to rectify it.”
Dean looks around from where he’s laying, in the bed of a stark, white hospital room. Sam is slumped in a chair that he’s too tall for, looking uncomfortable even in his sleep. Outside, the sky is the purple-orange of dusk.
Yeah, Dean was going to enjoy the fuck out of this, too.
Jody reported that the building was all clear and they were safe to leave.
Dean still hadn’t put the pieces together when Sam came slamming through the door; Chuck, Dean’s second-in-command, was hot on his heels. Cas flinched back from them as they barged in and Dean automatically moved to shield his love before he could help himself.
“I was gonna propose on our anniversary,” he told him, and Cas whimpered a little through his tears.
“You think I’m going to talk, think again you fucking… what the… Dean?!” Cas gasped, the shock evident on his face, even under his split lip and the cut over his left eyebrow that was dripping blood down his face.
he wanted to say. He doesn’t. Instead he shoved Cas back down and licked a line from his hole, over his balls and all the way up to the tip of his cock. He made that path again and again while Cas rubbed at his neck and shoulders, his sweet whimpers filling the room.
“Sure thing, Angel. Whatever you want.”
“Winchester!” Henriksen barked, so Dean finally decided to go easy on him and settled back to listen.
“No. Well, now he does, obviously. But until now he thought I was a mechanic. I’ve got an iron-clad cover worked out with Benny and Bobby.”
It’s all of his details, his real details; everything Cas could have ever wanted to know about Dean Winchester’s life, from his family, to his high school grades, to his social security number, to his cover identity working at Singer Auto Repair, all spelled out in Times New Roman size 12 font.
“Great. Wonderful. Perfect. You’re all done then? Get out of my house.”
At some point, Henriksen laid the folder carefully back down on his desk, got to his feet and paced around the room for a few minutes, agitated and angry. Then he crossed back over to Dean and wordlessly laid a firm hand on his shoulder, squeezing the muscle and bone through his shirt in some attempt to offer comfort.
“It’s because of Dean that this has happened!”
“You get this dealt with and you get Jessica and the baby back THIS INSTANT, NOVAK!” She roared, one hand on the wheel, the other clutching her phone to her ear, as she floored the accelerator all the way back to the office. No one dared to try and stop her.
Dean ignored the upheaval in favour of pressing his forehead down against his brother’s.
“You’re not hungry, then?” Cas asked, when they eventually broke apart for air, only for Dean to immediately start trying to get Cas out of his shirt.
“Of course,” Cas turned to him, all politeness once more. They both ignored Dean’s pointed grumble of, “
Cas had lied in so many circles, so many different directions, so many different ways, that he probably didn’t know what the truth was anymore; he was probably so used to it he could do it in his sleep.
Everything had changed.
He still couldn’t find the words to explain himself, even now that he was out of his gear, back in his normal clothes and had been given some time and space by the rest of the team to get his brain back online.
“Oh, no,” a voice from the doorway startles them both. Sam hunches forward protectively over Dean’s torso. “That would never have happened. The goal was to send a message to us. If Dean’s life was really going to be threatened, the bomb wouldn’t have been detonated on a Sunday, at a time when he’s usually safe and sound in the house, bugging Cas to make him pancakes shaped like mickey mouse ears.”
know what Dean really does, who he really becomes when he steps outside their front door each morning.
“Oh, my angel... Baby, you didn’t have to get up.”
“They ran a check, yeah. It came back clean. He completely checked out; Dean Singer, mechanic at his uncle’s garage!” Cas’ voice was tinged with hysteria, as if he were as shocked as Dean by all this.
Not five minutes passed before Cas was calling back, though Dean had finished two more glasses of whiskey by then.
“Let him go, if he wants to go,” Raphael told Michael, as everyone drifted away to start gearing up. “You’ve asked much of him, all these years, and he’s done everything you ever wanted. But you must listen to him now. Let him go to retrieve the civilians, and I’ll go with him as an added protection.”
“It’s OK, Junior Junior. Mama’s right there, and Uncle Dean’s got you now.”
Dean couldn’t take his eyes off him, couldn’t align the fact that the man before them, the man he’d stumbled upon in the back room of that shady warehouse just one hour ago, was truly him, his love, his Cas. He felt like he was waiting for something to happen that would explain it all – a pin to drop, Sammy to suddenly scream ‘April Fools’, or for Ashton Kutcher to pop out from behind the door telling him he was being punk’d.
given it to him, but he’d given it to him.
Dean groaned as he came with his face buried in Cas’ neck, panting against his sweaty skin. Cas whined again in pleasure as Dean filled him, but still wouldn’t loosen his legs. Dean flopped down on his chest, so spent he was practically cross-eyed, and tried to catch his breath.
It took Dean a long time to haul himself up from where Cas had left him, sitting at the bottom of the stairs with the ring on his finger and the folder in his white-knuckled hands.
“Mary,” Dean murmurs to himself. “Mary. After mom.”
“Wanna feel you always, want it as rough as you can. Never want to forget,” Cas mumbled as he started to reach for himself. As much as Dean loved watching that, there was no way Cas was going to get away with it this time.
They held each other with the finality thick in the air between them. Cas rested his forehead against Dean’s but wouldn’t kiss him. Dean gazed into his eyes, tried to memorise their exact shade of blue, the feeling of holding him. He pressed Cas as tightly as he could to his chest, but he couldn’t bring himself to tell Cas he loved him because he didn’t know what he felt anymore. The last time he’d said it had been in this same spot twelve hours earlier when he’d kissed Cas goodbye that morning, not knowing that it would be the last time.
Cas sighed, “Dean.”
Dean had punched the first officer that had come forward brandishing cuffs at Cas until Henriksen’s bark of 'WINCHESTER' and Sam’s arms clamping around him had put a stop to that.
“Nothing that I need anymore.”
“I’m going to get them.”
He headed over to the armoury van and pulled on his SWAT gear. Cas joined him after a few seconds, and Dean quietly helped him and Raphael dress in the same gear. Sammy tried to help but kept fumbling the buckles with how badly his hands were shaking.
Michael opened his mouth, but Cas moved forward and grabbed his arm, forcing his brother to look at him. Michael shrugged Cas away, scowling, and all the brothers seemed to retreat a few steps under the strength of his gaze, even though it wasn’t directed at them.
“No.”
They were strangers now; the love of his life had been relegated to no-one, a liar, and a fraud.
“The guy in there is my boyfriend. We’ve been dating for three years. We live together, bought a house last June. Up until today I thought he was a civilian, but I was wrong about that, it seems. There’s been an engagement ring in my dresser drawer for six months, wrapped up in an old pair of hiking socks so he couldn’t accidentally find it. Guess I won’t be needing it anymore, huh?”
“Why would I be… what are you talking about? What are
“Dean, what the hell, you –“ Sammy probably would have started scolding him too, if Dean hadn’t thrown the last bite of his doughnut at his head.
“You really think I want to talk to you? Why do you keep doing this to me?!” Dean spat when he picked up, because of course he fucking picked up.
“Does it matter?” Cas shrugged, as they handed back their SWAT gear to the inventory leader and started their trek back to the Impala 2.0.
“No. That was another family altogether, who we’ve silenced. They can never hurt you again.”
The rest of his desperate pleas to calm his brother were cut short by a troop of men striding through the doors, led by Charlie. Henriksen moved to meet them with a hand extended. It took Dean a moment to realise Cas was amongst them, his heart skipping a few beats as he drank in the sight of him, pale and scruffy-haired, red-eyed. It took his brain a little bit to click into gear and realise that this must be the Novak family.
When Dean’s home, during evenings and weekends, he seems to just wander about the house, feeling out of place. He finds himself picking up things at random and putting them down elsewhere just because he can; just because it might summon Cas to his side to complain that he was messing up the neatly arranged shelves or the order of the remotes on the coffee table in the living room. The house gets dirtier and smellier because Dean can’t summon the energy to clean and his diet comes to consist of toast, coffee, takeout, and beer.
“Nuh-uh, that’s mine,” he slapped Cas’ hand away and wrapped his own fingers around Cas’ leaking cock, settling back on his knees with Cas’ hips tilted up onto his lap so he could keep fucking him even as he stroked.
“What do you mean he won’t!” Dean bristled. “If Jess and the baby’s safety depends on it, he can have the fucking moon if he asks for it!”
“Winchester Junior Junior is a girl, huh?”
“Baby, it’s OK. You can go back…”
“But who has taken them, and why?” Charlie demanded, her hands on her hips.
Come @ me on tumblr, I'm jean----ralphio
Thank you so much to my amazing betas from tumblr; @studio-hatter, you have been so lovely and supportive and I couldn't have done it without you, I <3 you; @gracelesstars, your endless patience and epic help have been so amazing and your comments elevated this fic so much, and I <3 you; @whosthathufflepuff, my parabatai, my better half, my bff (Felicia Day said it, so its canon), you already know I <3 you.
Sam was on his feet before Dean could say anything, and Cas waited for Dean to precede him out of the room.
Overall, life tries to roll on as normal, except for the massive, gaping wound in his chest where Dean’s heart used to be. He works. He works out. He eats … kind of. He sleeps, fitfully. He ignores his brother’s nagging. He refuses to think about Cas, tries to shy away from memories, from his wants and needs, from his feelings, all while drifting about their home, chasing the scent of him on their bedsheets and the clothes he left behind.
“Tell me about Dean Winchester?” Sam was a professional, didn’t let his familiarity with own brother, and his own surname, slide into his tone. “Assuming that name has any meaning to you?”
“Dean. Jessica and the baby have been taken.”
So at midday, their four 8-man teams would converge on the warehouse. The Winchester brothers would lead their two teams inside, with Charlie’s and Jody’s people covering the outer perimeter of the building in case any escaped or reinforcements showed up.
Dean can’t look at him anymore, can’t let his pain be magnified.
“It’s because of you! It’s because of you, and our family, and what you’ve turned me into! Crowley has struck in the worst possible way to hurt me by hurting the one I love. He’s taken an innocent woman and a baby, because that’s unfathomable, unbearable agony to Samuel and in turn it’s
Dean can’t cook to save his life, but he manages a piece of toast and fried eggs that don’t look too atrocious. When he brings it up to Cas, he finds him rumpled and warm from the shower, wearing one of Dean’s old sweaters, dozing against the pillows in their bed.
Sam gave him a long look that might have been scepticism but was probably jealousy because Dean’s team was the best, and far better than Sammy’s.
“There’s no point talking about what Dean
Dean had shot the pretty guy in the trenchcoat a smile in return, and hadn’t really been able to look away ever since.
“But why are you
Cas raised his chin, blue eyes glinting with anger even as they narrowed in hurt.
“No,” Cas agreed wanly. “Not this time.”
Charlie peeked around the door not long after, ducked aside as Henriksen kicked a filing cabinet in the corner, and hunkered down on Dean’s other side to hold his hand. She eyed the folder with wide and worried eyes, and either read it upside down or didn’t read it at all.
Dean gritted his teeth, but Michael cut him off.
“Angel,” Dean moaned again, his brain fogging up with delight.
Something in his tone dragged Dean off the couch, to trail after him to the door before he could stop himself. Cas looked at him, one half of his face lit up gold by the glow of the lamp.
“Like you haven’t been lying to me too? Isn’t that half the problem here?”
“SO WHAT THEN?! What am I to you now? What are we? Who the fuck
At 2am, Dean stood and stretched his stiff muscles, blinking hard to try and wake himself up. He wandered about the desks looking for Henriksen, trying not to disturb his colleagues, be they resting too or hunched over their computers, trawling CCTV for any sign of vehicles or men associated with the Novak family’s rival.
Dean was ten minutes late to HQ for the briefing and didn’t care one bit. Some things were worth being torn a new one by Henriksen, and Cas’ mouth was definitely one of them.
The only response was a sigh down the line before Cas hung up.
“You want me to leave you alone with a guy who a few hours ago told you he wished you were getting beaten up and that he never wanted to see you again?”
Dean followed straight after Henriksen through the empty doorway into the warehouse, keeping enough of a gap between himself and his boss to ensure quiet. The small entryway held only a mishmash of chairs and a sad looking snake plant, slumped in a pot. The short corridor beyond, if their plans of the building were accurate, should open immediately right into the warehouse. Henriksen was on one knee at the corner, and he shot a quick look back at Dean to check on him before he slunk around it.
Dean and the strange man eye each other with barely concealed suspicion, before the stranger turns and says something to Cas in a language Dean doesn’t know.
(See the end of the chapter for
So, Dean went to work in the morning and spent his day investigating cases, clearing dens of iniquity and chasing down criminals. Then he’d come home, leave his veneer of a cool, calm and collected special agent at the door and turn back into Dean Singer, Cas’ kinda goofy boyfriend, who was oh so very civilian with his love for classic rock, lazy Sundays in bed and anything deep-fried, that it was almost painful.
It can only be one man.
“My cover’s barely holding by a thread, but it’s safer to let him report to his superiors that I’m who I’m still trying to pretend to be.”
A few more months limped by before Dean managed to resume some semblance of a normal life. He made it to Friday afternoon one week in August without even realising it, having worked his rostered hours every day, eaten proper meals and gotten a good amount of exercise and sleep the whole week.
“You do understand, don’t you, that everything I did, every day, was just so that I could be with you? You were my lifeline. It was all I wanted; you were all I had. Everything else was just an obstacle to get through, a fight to win, a test or a trial, until I could be home with you. And now I feel like I’m cut loose, severed from my
“None of this is safe, Angel,” Dean murmured, but he stood back to let Cas take the lead like he wanted, too tense to argue.
Nothing had changed and everything had changed, all at once. It was going to be easy to work through some things, and nearly impossible to address others. But Cas was here with him and willing to try, and Dean didn’t think he’d ever loved him more.

She shrugged. “Yeah, Sam sure as hell doesn’t always make the best choices. But is there really a need to preserve identities anymore, now we’re making a deal with the Novak’s? Maybe Sam wanted to give Castiel a sense of a bond forming between them, to make Castiel feel like he wanted to open up to him more? Or maybe your brother just wanted to feel a little closer to someone who means so much to you?”
Charlie surprised them all by getting over the shock and fury the quickest; she was screaming down the phone at Michael Novak when she came to pick them up from the hospital in Baby 2.0, which Dean had left in the street outside Sam’s place with the keys in the ignition and the engine running.
The mob family hadn’t paid any of the detectives mind all night, not until Dean bullied his brother into standing and started hustling him from the building, passing the briefing room without a second glance as he did so. But when Michael spotted them leaving, he pulled his phone away from his ear and held his hand over the mouthpiece in order to utter a few commands to Castiel, who nodded and was coming out of the room after the Winchesters in half a heartbeat.
,” Dean continued. “I was getting by. I was coping, kind of. Now I’m talking to you and I feel like pure shit all over again and all my progress has been blown sky-high. You just… you fuck me up so much!”
He shot a look at Sam over his shoulder as he and Cas walked away. His brother was back on his feet and was holding his daughter up over his head, cooing to her. Jessica smiled and waved to Dean, even as a paramedic started to fuss over her, and Dean waved back.
