Dean didn’t want to, he
"I know what it's like to lose people under your command," he said eventually, "to be the only one left and feel like you failed them because of that."
Dean looked like he was about to snap at her but there was a click from the phone and he was diverted when a curt, tired-sounding voice answered.
“Why would anyone-?”
one of the now-abandoned houses, though he was pretty sure Sam was going to start moving people who already lived inside of the magic line back to their homes to make more room for those who had been ousted. Dean closed the door behind him and turned back to see Cas waiting for him in the hallway. Dean felt a pang of
else to do. Because your purpose since Lucifer fell has been preparing for the apocalypse. But you never planned what you would do afterwards, did you? It never crossed your mind that after all of the accolades and the pride you would still have to go on with the knowledge that you killed your brother because your Father told you to. And then you get a second chance and you come here, and you get to kill Lucifer all over again and you have your purpose back and now you have your sword. But you won, again, and now you're floundering, again, because you're afraid that there is nothing else to you. So you want to tear it all down so there will be no one left to watch you grieve."
“I didn’t say it would be easy.”
those things, but at this point, he didn’t really need to.
The fight seemed to last for days. He cut down zombie after zombie but it didn’t seem to make any difference to their numbers. He was covered in blood; some of it his own, most of it not. He tasted it on his tongue, mixed with earth and rot, cold and congealed. He spat and gagged, his ears rang with angered howls and roars and screams, and still they kept coming.
Love was kinda like that.
Dean harrumphed in the way Castiel had learned was mostly an automatic response and said nothing.
“I’m sure she’s fine,” Rowena said, though she was sure of no such thing. She’d never met Jody but the boys talked about her she was like a second mother, a capable hunter and a strong woman, someone worthy of respect and deference. She, and those girls she looked after, especially Claire, were clearly dear to them.
“He used the gun.”
Castiel listened attentively while Dean caught him up on the workings of Seattle Mercy Hospital; even when he finally played the episode Dean kept talking over it, nudging Castiel when Doctor Piccolo made a dramatic entrance.
If you like, you can tell me
“It’s not his first,” Dean said immediately, “but this one’s important, he wants it to be right.”
He gasped as a hand wrapped around his own throat, a burbling screech sounding in his ears and his instincts came back to him. He struggled and barely managed to pull the thing’s hand away. Once free he ducked and swung a leg out, trying to send it crashing to the ground as Cas ran forward, angel blade in hand.
“I- I
Dean scoffed and shrugged him off, jerking his chin over to Jack, who had emerged from the bunker and stood next to Sam now, his expression sombre.
He trailed off as their eyes met. It was that awkward kind of eye contact that happened between them sometimes, just a hair too serious for the situation at hand, almost expectant, like they were both caught in a moment of waiting, though he didn't know what for. He doubted that Dean knew either, but the hunter was almost always the first to look away.
No, not ask, not with words,
Cas' heart went out to the man. Sam had grown so much in the last few years; ever since Cas had returned from the Empty Sam had been different, he had taken on the parental role in Jack's life while Dean had kept his distance, trying his absolute best to make sure that Jack never felt the same loneliness that he had as a child. Cas would be forever grateful to Sam for fulfilling his promise to Kelly when he himself couldn't. Not that that was why Sam had done it, of course, he was just that kind.
whispered a small voice in the back of his head.
Dean huffed a laugh, "Yeah, I guess it would. So is that what you meant, about leaving?"
"I-" Castiel hesitated, looked down again, at the light blue t-shirt with a little cartoon bee on the front, sporting a scowl and a pair of crossed arms, a speech bubble that emanated from its mouth said 'Buzz off', at the yellow and black striped woollen socks, at the pocket of his jacket, onto which he'd sewn a patch of another brightly coloured cartoon bee, this one happily leaving a trail of wonky lines in white thread that Castiel had sewn himself to try and make it look like the bee had come out of his pocket. He'd been proud of himself for this small accomplishment, under Dean's heavy gaze though, his effort suddenly felt stupid and pointless.
“A room?” The man asked. His name badge identified him as Walter.
Cas smiled at him and placed a hand on his cheek for an all-too-brief moment before stepping away.
So you tell him you're gonna leave again… if you sent him back there… I don't even wanna think about what he might do."
His stomach growled at him but he ignored it. He tended to avoid the set mealtimes. All of the Apocalypse World survivors—were they hunters now? People of letters?—seemed to have made a rota for cooking and chores that ticked over like clockwork and Dean felt like a spare gear. He usually waited until the rush was over and then would sneak out to grab a bowl of something as inconspicuously as possible. The good thing about having so many people around was that there was almost always a vat of something bubbling on the stove or a plate piled high with sandwiches. He hadn't had to cook once since being back, although that wasn't an entirely comfortable feeling either. It had the feel of a dormitory to it, or a military base. Like he wasn't really living here, just staying for the duration of the mission.
Sam dropped them into her palm with a smile and she stowed them in her handbag.
"I understand your feelings of failure, Sam," Cas said eventually, "you weren't there for people you felt responsible for and they suffered because of it. But if I had turned back to try and save my brethren, I would not have saved Dean. And the only way to have prevented Maggie and the others from dying would have been to lock Dean in the Mal'ak box and drop him in the ocean. But your choice wasn't so clean-cut as choosing who to save, you couldn't have foreseen these exact consequences, and even if you had, would you have chosen differently? And it's hard, because you cared about them, but you have to forgive yourself. Dean is here, and Michael is dead and those are good things and we will deal with the rest. You proved yourself a wise and capable leader, Sam. Don't let this discourage you from trying to help those that survived. Don't shut yourself off to the possibility that this time, things might just work out."
That thought stung at his chest, his own grief yawning wide. What the hell were they gonna do now? How did they even go back to being just Sam and Dean against the world? It had always felt that way, even as their family kept growing, but he’d fallen into a support system of ‘not-Dean’ too. And he hadn’t realised just how much he’d been relying on that until the last vestige of it was stripped away. He thought of Rowena then. She was a great ally to have and he trusted her, but that trust didn’t extend to being able to dump all his problems at her feet. She might be observant, but she didn’t have the insight that Cas had had, or the motherly instinct of Mary, or even Jack’s charming guilelessness that never failed to make him feel better, if only for a moment.
"Any other deathbed confessions while we're here?"
"But I got to know them, and that's what counts, right?"
Dean was a dead weight against him, throwing his own balance off a little. But he was practised at this, and it was one of those times his extra height came in handy, so he bore up better than the last time Dean had had to get
Dean rolled his eyes, "Whatever, man, take the time you need, it's not like I'm going anywhere without those flappers anyway."
Rowena guessed that it had been Sam to actually insist on the switch and Dean was just trying to save face. She leaned her hip against the side of the Charger. “No word, then?” she asked.
"Love you, man," he mumbled into Sam's shoulder after a particularly hard hunt, during which Sam had been surrounded by vamps and Dean had lost visual for a few, terrifying seconds. Castiel knew that it had brought flashbacks of the other world when they had gone searching for Mary, noticed the way Dean's hands shook as he grabbed tightly onto Sam's jacket after he had emerged from the press of bodies, bloody but mostly intact.
"Sam's right," Cas said, "this was a great idea, Dean. It was nice to get out of the bunker for a little while and just have some fun," his smile was faint and sweet and it caught in Dean's chest. More than ever, Dean regretted falling asleep and missing out on their first family picnic; even though it had been his idea in the first place he'd just conked out as though he hadn't actually wanted to spend time with his family in a situation that didn't involve killing something or avoiding being killed, as though it didn't actually
This was a goodbye, this was Cas committing suicide right in front of him and laying his soul bare as he did it,
Michael huffed impatiently, "I am
Castiel would say that it was important, therefore, that his favourite season was autumn; though he'd say it with a smile and an insistence that he didn't need to bridge the gap between the brothers, glad that he did anyway. It had taken him a long time to accept his place of belonging as a fixed thing and he always felt it more keenly in autumn. Though autumn wasn't fixed by any means, it was the season of change, which is what Castiel liked about it best.
Cas looked up at the pressure and followed the line of Dean's hand back to his face.
And this one could be seen as connected to the last one... they are in a very similar (*ahem*, the same) vein. So if that's your headcanon, go for it, just remember that tomorrow's is almost certainly not going to to be in any way related :P
had made when he had decided that Jack was too dangerous to exist. His hand clenched over his skinned palm again, stretching and pulling at the tightened skin, probably cracking open the scabs a little.
"Fine." He reached for the radio and turned the volume up, way up. Sam jumped as AC/DC blasted from the speakers and Dean peeled out of the parking lot and through the residential estate, where they probably had a lot of curtain-twitchers ready to call the Neighbourhood Watch for a noise violation but whatever, they'd hit the highway in ten.
He emerged into the night air, dewy grass soaking his feet and the hems of his pajama pants, great sobs heaving out of him. He stopped in the garden. He was outside, he made it. And now he didn’t know what to do. Where had Daddy gone? He looked around. There were people on the street, all of them staring at him and at his house with horrified eyes, but none of them came forward to tell him where his daddy was. Sammy had settled in his arms again now that he was no longer running, but he was heavy and Dean's arms were starting to ache.
Gadreel, and-"
"Let me? That's cute."
," Michael spat out the name like a bad taste, "will stop fighting me when he no longer has anything to fight for." He sighed then, apparently the expression on Castiel's face was pitiful. "I am not without mercy. Once this task is done, I will re-fashion his paradise and he can stay there. I will do that out of respect for his work against Lucifer."
Cas’ face pinched and he shook his head, his hands falling away from the bite wound in his arm. “I don’t know. I lost him.”
Charlie laughed brightly, grabbing her friend by the elbow and tugging him along, “I’m so glad you could come, Dean. It’s been way too long since you visited Moondoor.”
Love Tibbins xx
my brother Castiel, just when he'd finally learned his place, too."
He stays within these walls because I ask him to.
Dean patrolled the border around town, watching ghosts appear and vanish on the other side of the line; some he recognised, others he didn’t. How they were going to get rid of them if all the doors in Hell were still open was beyond him. If they found and burned some bones what was stopping them from just… coming back? Also, he was pretty sure that the clown hadn’t been a ghost when they’d fought it the first time. Hadn’t it been a Hindu creature? A rasa- something? Or was he mixing up his cases? Didn’t things like that end up in Purgatory rather than Hell? Or had God ripped open those doors too?
“Ghosts that don’t work right.”
take forever ordering something custom.”
“Here!” he tried to yell back, though whether he was heard or not he had no idea. He could barely see through the press of bodies; sunken eyes and grey skin hanging off bones, all in the ragged Sunday best they’d been buried in. They gave off a putrid smell, different stages of decomposition mixed with some fresher embalming fluid. It was strong and more than concentrated enough to make Sam want to fall to his knees and throw up. His shoulder burned, his every muscle ached with fatigue, and still he fought. Another head went rolling, another brain impaled. He wrenched the spike free and whirled around to deflect another attack. Gore dripped from the end of it, crusted and black in the artificial darkness. The flashes of red that still sparked from the fissures in the ground were pretty much the only light source. Well… that and the occasional blaze of white grace that told him Cas was still alive, or at least he had been a few minutes ago.
Maybe it was okay for him to keep to himself a little while longer, Cas was right, Sam had everything under control and that was a good thing. It's not that he's not
"Yeah, well, karma's a bitch," Dean said, "what did you mean about Cas' downfall?"
"You should eat," he said, "Mary said she hasn't seen you at meals."
Everything fell silent, the clouds hung metallic and waterlogged over them but the rain was barely a patter now. The crackle of electricity in the air vanished and the thunder along with it.
Mary and Jack stood waiting for them outside the bunker. Either Sam had texted them with an ETA or they had been waiting on their best guess and probably been stood there for hours. The impala eased to a stop in front of them and when Sam turned the engine off and removed the keys, the car let out a series of mournful creaks as it settled. Sam patted the dash before getting out, the tension that had eased slightly during their long car ride was back in full force. Castiel watched the way he braced himself, shoulders rigid, as he opened the door and unfolded himself from the front seat. Castiel felt it too. Having the time alone to process, then the time with Sam to grieve had been a slow easing in to the pain that they faced. But there were other people that loved Dean too, and they would be looking to him and Sam for guidance, Sam especially. Castiel did not envy the mantle he carried and hoped he would be able to help bear it. He got out too, the cool air on his face was pleasant, as was the smell of recent rainfall on earth, though it didn't have the same lingering charge in the air that the barn had had; just an ordinary change in weather then. He hesitated after closing the car door behind him, unable to look the others in the eye as Sam carefully pulled Dean's body from the backseat, face still covered with the trenchcoat. Mary strode forward immediately and yanked it off, letting the fabric fall to pool on the ground, her eyes fixed on her eldest son. Castiel saw her throat bob as she swallowed and heard Jack's sharp gasp. Mary's eyes were ringed with shadow, underlining her pain. Her jaw clenched in a way that was so reminiscent of Dean that it panged in his chest. Her fingers hovered over the rip in his shirt where the blade had gone in, clear of blood now but no less telling. After a few moments she stepped back.
Cas watched him over the lip of his mug thoughtfully, his head titled in that confused owl way he had. Dean tried to keep his eyes averted but found himself being drawn in at intervals. Cas was worried, about Jack, about him and Sam; he was also grieving, he had come to know the Apocalypse World survivors too while Michael had been joyriding around in Dean's meat. Not as well as Sam maybe, but the loss seemed to weigh heavy on him all the same. The creases of his face seemed a little deeper, creases that he hadn't had when they'd met, creases that by all rights should never have formed. Guess Dean had managed to screw that up too.
I can't say I'm very happy with this one, I might change it completely in editing. But I didn't have any concrete ideas and I ran out of time so this is just kinda angsty word vomit. Sorry!
are the ones with free will, Castiel. Not angels, not you."
"Do you think he will enjoy watching me tear out your grace to crush it in my hands? Do you think he would want to
"I think you could say we killed each other at the same time," Dean said, glancing over to where the misshapen lump of the minotaur lay. "I just… haven't gotten around to dying yet."
"I'm sorry, Jack," he said, "I know you mean well but you don't understand what Dean… what we've been through together. He was in the position of saying yes to Michael before, many years ago. I stopped him then," he smiled bitterly at the memory, "well, truth be told I beat him to a pulp in an alley and locked him in a basement. I had given up everything for him, he convinced me to rebel against Heaven, he told me that it was the right thing and he made me believe it when that shouldn't have been possible, and I couldn't stand the thought of him giving up when he had just given me a reason to fight."
Surprisingly, when he saw Castiel stand, he didn't try to bolt. Instead he walked towards him and extended his arm.
The angel let out a relieved laugh when Lilo produced the paperwork that would allow Stitch to stay and relaxed back into the couch cushions as the jaunty music that signalled the final montage began, though he still looked contemplative. Dean turned his attention back to the snacks on the table, so he wouldn't be caught staring. Cas let the credits roll, despite the fact that the remote was closest to him. After the final credit song ended, Sam raised an eyebrow.
"Quite the opposite. It was the most important mission of my life," Cas paused a moment, "I never did tell you the story of how I raised Dean from Hell, did I?"
it when they’re burning up.” She shuddered. Fire was a horrible way to die.
Cas didn't know what to say to that. Dean looked so
“Screw you,” came the muffled reply somewhere in the pile of debris and Sam let out a sound of relief at the confirmation of life before forcing himself to refocus on his own threat.
Through his lids there was a sudden white flash and then the breath was knocked from him as something heavy hit his torso. He cracked an eye open and after blinking a few times to clear the spots there was Cas, slumped against the wall, panting hard. Dean rolled the body off him, shuddering, and wiped his sleeve across his head, probably smearing blood everywhere but at least it got rid of the horrible tickling feeling as it dripped from the cut.
"You're gonna have to." Dean repeated, matching certainty for certainty, "Whether you promise me or not, the day is gonna come when I have to get inside that box and seal the door."
Cas nodded lightly.
we barely made it out alive and Michael could have disintegrated every being in that bar without so much as blinking. We can't even
Castiel curled one wing around his writhing charge as he fought the demon. He didn't need both to fly. He actually didn't need to fly at all. Anywhere in Hell was floor if you demanded it be, though not all of Hell's residents had figured that out yet, but for travelling directly upwards flying was necessary, it was also quicker.
at his jaw, getting the jut of his rotting teeth right in the seam below his ear and

and now he was supposed to just accept that all that work had been for nothing? That he would've gotten here anyway because Chuck's fucking
Cas sat on his motel room bed and watched a cockroach scuttle its way from the dresser to a crack in the wall. The fact that he had needed this room at all was demeaning. The fact that he’d had to use the Winchesters’ money to pay for it even more so. It was only the thought that it wasn’t even really their money to begin with that soothed his ire.
, they weren't risking drawing any unwanted attention. He also resolved to listen to Sam if he said something was too dangerous. Dean might be ready to jump on board with the first thing that looked promising but he also knew that the Empty wasn't something that they could take a swing and a miss at. If they didn't get it right first try, they'd all be screwed.
Rowena wondered if she should use that term anymore, ‘miracle’. It implied God’s intervention, and although it turned out that God
Dean's courage put Castiel to shame; his chest was tight, his lungs didn't seem to be working properly, and the only image in his head was of Dean trapped inside a metal coffin, a mockery of his original salvation.
Castiel sighed deeply, pressing his lips to the side of Dean’s neck before pulling it from its nest to draw back and look at Dean, catching the edge of that smile. He smiled too, the same kind, and for a while they both just stood there smiling at each other, barely remembering to rock their hips, to make sure they were still dancing.
"I'm sorry," Dean said, still holding Cas' hand where it gripped his shirt, "I didn't know things were that bad."
“Damn,” Dean said. “Head-chop still work?”
Dean, the Dean that didn’t have to hold so tightly to the macho bullshit he’d wrapped around himself since he was six years old, this Dean could admit that he felt betrayed, that it hurt that his prayers—the most he’d prayed in his entire faithless life—had gone ignored, and he could also admit that he even despite all that, he didn’t want to leave Purgatory without his best friend.
"I'm sure he appreciated the effort nonetheless," Cas said diplomatically, "as you appreciate his efforts in cleaning up the bunker and doing your laundry and suggesting this. Isn't it the same? It doesn't fix the problem, but it helps."
"What?"
"Not that much," Dean said through a mouthful of eggs, "I did a few loads last night. I had to chuck that shirt you were wearing in that vamp nest though, Sam,"
"I'm-" Castiel said, looking around at the barren field the barn had been in as though for inspiration, decorated only by the rust-brown truck he had driven here. The earth here was changed now, he could feel it, though blessed or cursed he couldn't tell, nor could he decide which he would prefer. "My body is no longer injured." He said. It was stilted and formal but it was the best he could manage while still being honest.
Castiel's jaw worked but the words wouldn't come out. He couldn't say them; he was cradling Dean's cold body in his lap but his heart rebelled against him.
, he was so goddamn angry at the angel, though he couldn't explain why. It wasn't just Mary and it wasn't just Jack and it wasn't just Rowena but all those things were tangled together in a huge ball of
Dean slowly began to open up about things that he missed on Earth. He talked about food, and women, and his car, and alcohol, but it took him almost ten years to ask about his brother.
"So," Castiel said, standing to walk up the steps to the library and standing in the doorway, "I will do everything in my power to make sure that it doesn't come to that. We
Cas didn't need to hear about that.
Cas joined them about an hour later which considerably sped up the process; he could carry even the largest of bodies with ease and his angel strength made chopping down trees a one or two swing job.
"Mary." Jack said, placing a hand on her shoulder, which she promptly shook off. "It's not his fault. He did what he could. You did, right Castiel?"
“My loyal and valued subjects,” she began, scanning over the tables. Many were people she knew from her daily life, others were familiar only in Moondoor, others still were people that she had only spoken to online. She might not know all of them, and she certainly didn’t
"Can't I?" Castiel said, steel in his voice now. No hesitation, pure reaction, pure instinct.
If you like, I'm on
“But the kid said—”
Castiel took in a shuddering breath and let it out just as painfully. Why did it hurt so much? The demon had proven useful so far. Sam had called it a ‘necessary evil’, though he hadn’t been able to look Castiel in the eyes as he’d said it. At least Sam seemed to find it as disturbing as he did, he wasn’t
Jack looked at him then, wide eyes pleading. Castiel nodded miserably.
“Exorcising doesn’t kill the demon,” Dean said, sounding almost hesitant.
"You agreed with me that what you were doing, how you were keeping him locked up, it wasn't sustainable. That you even held out as long as you did was nothing short of miraculous. It was only getting your head slammed repeatedly into a wall that loosened your hold enough for Michael to get out. And that's the thing, Dean, even unconscious you were fighting him. His walls didn't disappear, he had to break through. You did everything that you could and more. If it had been Sam in this exact same position, you wouldn't have blamed him for a moment. How can you expect more of yourself?"
tell Sam and Dean about the deal he'd struck. They would definitely try to help him get out of it, and giving their past record of dealing with such things it was at least possible that they would find a way. But what would be the point? He was going back to the Empty one day regardless of what the Winchesters did, why risk putting them in the crossfire just because it was going to happen sooner than expected? Besides, he might still have months left, years even.
Damn Cas. Damn Cas and his damn insight. Dean nodded again.
Demon Dean didn’t waste time and charged at his brother with a maniacal laugh that still haunted Sam’s dreams. They collided with a crash and Sam had to force his attention back to his own looming fight.
Dean hesitated for barely a moment before nodding, the movement smooth against Cas’ skin.
to be said aloud, the words exchanged with every touch, every meeting of their eyes, but before he could even try to voice them, Dean's head snapped back, dying grace exploding from his eyes against the flow of the rain. Lightning crashed around them, the wind screamed alongside him; the scream resonated with Castiel's grace, transcending Dean's human voice, straining his vocal chords like a guitar string about to snap.
Miss Chaudhary was a small woman who looked to be in her mid-thirties, her black hair was bound in a long plait and she had a smile that seemed almost too large for her face.
Castiel nodded, disappointed.
"No, Cas, I don't think there is."
Perhaps it was that desperate thought that caused him to dash through a brief crack in the defending forces the second it opened. It was pure luck that he had been right next to it and he just acted. The opening closed behind him just as quickly and although he hadn't gone completely unnoticed, the distraction at the gates proved too large for more than a few creatures to peel off and attack, though once he had dispatched them, he knew that he wouldn't have long before the very presence of his grace drew attention like a beacon.
Her smile warmed. “Which is precisely why it’s sticking.”
? Why doesn’t Chuck want everyone to know?”
Dean laughed and took the end of the tie to examine it. "Sure, buddy," he said, his eyes crinkling at the edges as he looked up. "It's nice. Matches your eyes."
"I don't pity you," Cas said with a sigh, "I just don't like watching you suffer and I want to help in any way I can."
he'd be able to- he could feel the torn muscle and sluggish blood under his palms.
"Dean-" Sam said, then he cleared his throat, "Look, I'm just gonna say it. You're in love with Cas, you have been for years. There, it's said, it's in the air and now we can talk about it."
wasn't the issue, there was no way he would be interested in Dean specifically. Dean was
"I should probably do a load too," Sam said conversationally, "I think some of the stuff at the bottom is starting to grow mould."
“So I should look for a case?”
"He-" Castiel took a deep breath in an attempt to steady himself. He didn't have the same understanding with Mary that he did with Sam, He had to say the words. "He's dead, Mary."
Sam snorted into his own mug. Rowena smiled at him and placed her tea down on the table.
I didn’t think it needed saying.
Dean flinched but Sam had already turned away and didn’t see. Rowena did though. He flushed at the pity on her face.
"Sure, Cas, come on in."
“Shh,” he said softly, “I know.”
He heard Dean shouting goodbye as well before the call was cut off. He smiled, pleased that Dean had refrained from charging in recklessly and hoped that it would become a habit.
"Night Sam" Cas said without looking away from Dean's eyes.
"Don't you bother coming here! You will never be welcome here again, and that was your choice!" John hangs up and Dean looks up at Cas, scared and angry. At the sight of his lover, the wave of emotions that race through his imagination made it to his physical body. He falls to the ground at Cas' feet and a single tear runs down his face. He bites his lip and tries to control the panic bubbling up inside his brain, consuming him.
"Sam, go grab my phone from the counter! I'm going to document this!" Cas starts to blush as Sam tosses Mary her phone with a slightly disgusted expression, the joy for his brother and close friend only showing in his hazel eyes. "Stay just like that!
"Ok good. Anyways, I know you won't believe me, but he's in love with you as well. Now, before you object, try faking falling asleep and see how he is in his sleep. He's always been so honest in his sleep. The first word he ever said was "Mama", and he was sleeping at the time. So just hear me out. See what he says." Before Cas could reply, Mary shoots him a signature wink, grabbing her milk from the microwave, and dancing her way to bed.
"Yep."
Sam's up!" Dean loves messing with his little brother.
"Mom said she got you something from the store."
"Ok let's get going." And with that they all rounded into the Impala and drove to the nearest Dairy Queen in town. As they pulled up, Dean didn't expect anything but a simple night out and some Dairy Queen.
and wasn't being too successful. Mary and Cas have been gone for over 20 minutes without so much as a text. He is fully aware he shouldn't worry, but what could he do? He was finishing putting the cheese and pepperoni on top of the dish when he figures he needs to do something. He pulled his phone and scrolled for the contact he was looking for.
“Life ain’t the trolley problem, kid,” Dean chimed in from across the room, having got to his feet. He was keeping his distance from the younger Sam though, which was surprising really, Sam thought Dean would have attacked by now. “You make your choices as best you can in the moment, and you don’t always have the time to theorise about which saves the most people when the other guy is family.”
He forgot what he was still waiting for.
Cas started the engine, which rattled Sam’s head even more, but the relief at leaving this place behind trumped it. They all seemed to feel it. In fact, none of them said a word until they hit the main road and the graveyard became obscured by trees.
Dean portioned out the food and sat with his own, staring at Sam, his eyes narrowed,
"Dean," Castiel said, his voice measured, Dean, who had taken up his pacing again, stopped and backed up so he was in view.
Castiel actually took a half-step back, "what?"
His lips pulled up into a small smile even as Michael spilled his guts onto the soiled ground. "It's alright, Dean." He whispered, reaching a hand up to rest it against Michael's cheek, his thumb brushing over the freckles that softened the hard lines, adding a child-like quality to the face of the man who had been forced to grow up too fast. "It's going to be alright."
Jack was dead. Cas’ brain kept repeating that moment, Chuck’s fingers snapping, Jack’s head thrown back, his grace streaming out of him, burning,
"Do you think he'd want it any other way?" Jack demanded. They stared at each other for a few seconds; Jack with an angry set to his jaw, Castiel unable to move until Jack seemed to think he had made his point and turned away to head back over to the library, leaving Castiel with those words echoing around his skull, made even worse by the fact that his answer was immediate and wrenched at his gut.
"They look like peas." Castiel mused aloud.
After about three hours of heavy silence, Castiel pulled something out of his trouser pocket and began to turn it over nervously in his fingers. Sam glanced over at the movement and his expression sank into soft understanding.
He always kept a few fireworks back though, and he'd wake Sam up in the middle of the night a few days later to complete the show. If Cas noticed (which of course he did), then he was gracious enough to not intrude, understanding that this was a tradition for the brothers alone.
"I dunno," Sam said frankly, "but I think, eventually, we'd both understand why you went back."
“And if we don’t make it?”
The green eyed man shifted awkwardly in his seat. “I uh- I kinda wanted to talk about us.” Dean saw Cas’ eyes flash hope then fear, fear that he rushed to dissipate. “Not “I never want to see you again” or anything like that, in case you were worried. The opposite of that actually.” Cas nodded, looking rather confused, but very focused.
kissing you and can't get enough," His point shown by a small, lingering peck on the lips. "You moved in, remember? Let's unpack and make it official. Mkay?" Cas lets out a groan.
Before Dean knew what he was doing, he ran in there and was talking faster than his brain could process. After a few seconds he heard himself saying something he had never said out loud.
Dean smiles and kisses Cas' forehead. "Well, in that case, see you up there Cas. I love you." Cas nods, walking away slowly.
Dean chuckles at his adorable boyfriend before him. Looking into his bright blue eyes, he could almost forget his worries, focus on what he has instead of what it would be like if he didn't. "I love you Castiel. Also, I made pancakes!"
"No, no of course that's ok with me Cas. I like hangin' out with you." Dean said as he started to get lost in Cas' pretty, big, blue eyes until Sam made a coughing sound from behind them mumbling about "eye-sex" and "irritating canon-teasers"; whatever the hell
The way he talked to people, the things he and Crowley did as a team. It still makes him sick. The only positive, if you can call it that, is that Dean had to address how he really felt about men. Don't get him wrong, he didn't much care for acknowledging the whole demon thing at all for at least a year, then Mom popped back up. Basically he had to wait a few years for the totem pole of unearthed desires to get to it, but now it's all he's got left. He could continue to ignore it but the itch under his skin isn't going anywhere fast.
"Can I talk to you in the library? You look like you need to leave this room for a bit." Cas nodded his agreements and pushed himself off of the bed, bringing the chocolate with him. As they walked to the library in silence, Cas imagined this is what it felt like to be sent to the principles office. Once they made it to the library and sat down, Sam was ready to start the conversation.
"I've eaten an apple and some chocolate." The look Sam gave him was confusing. From what he knew, it was a mix between happiness and sympathy.
"I love you, Dean," Castiel says with a shine in his eyes.
"Yes, thank you Gabriel where ever you may be." Cas turned to look at Dean. Their eyes met and then they shared sleepy kisses until Cas pulled away.
"What's the matter, Dean? You don't like the way I look in your clothes and jacket? Your staring from earlier would disagree with you." Cas was pretty much humping the air by now and Dean's dick was about to become fairly visible in his jeans.
!!! Dean was
Cas!" Dean rushes to his angel's side, ignoring his mother for a moment. "Babe are you alright? Let me check you real quick."
Still, there was something about it. It didn't shrink away from him or run to him, it just glared at him defiantly, there was something interesting in that.
"What?"
They shared a look, Sam nodded, "Yeah, Jack. We're sure."
It had been a close call back at the motel. She didn’t think she’d ever seen Sam that angry, and certainly not at Dean. Sure, they bickered almost constantly and argued about the best way to do things all the time, but there had been a coldness to Sam that she’d never seen before, his usual lining of fondness had been absent, lending his words a sharper edge, something that Dean had clearly picked up on. The moment had passed with her distraction but she was sure that wouldn’t be the last time that anger would raise its ugly head. There was only so much that could be buried, even by the Winchesters, and the loss of a child was one thing that would never stay down. At least in her experience.
"Besides," he said after a few moments, "you raised him. You raised him and he is smart like he is because of you."
"Something."
He felt Cas tense next to him as he pushed his fingers along Cas' palm until they reached the gaps that they would slot into so perfectly. He kept his movements slow, careful, giving Cas plenty of time and opportunity to move his hand away if he wanted. But he didn't. Cas' gaze was hot on his face but he didn't turn to look, keeping his eyes trained on the sunset, swallowing hard. Sam and Jack were
Sam looked at him strangely but didn't ask questions, picking up the can of gas and splashing it heavy over the pyre. The sharp, heady stench seemed to bore directly into his brain and when Mary tossed her lighter onto the wood, the resulting surge of flame was hot enough to make most of the others step back. Castiel stood his ground, the heat pawing at his face, his eyes fixed on the white shroud in the centre of the pyre, already beginning to char. He swallowed hard and the thought that he would never see those green eyes again hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest. Sam might share a heaven with him when he died, but Castiel would go to the Empty. The horror of eternity stretched open in front of him, countless days without Dean, and soon, much sooner than he would like, without Sam and Jack too. Years would pass, all the humans around him now would age and fade with time until all Castiel had were memories.
was the right time for this talk, especially when Dean couldn't even wrap his head around the deal Cas had made.
"Yeah,
It wasn't a lie, not really. Heaven
“Your line of work being the systematic destruction of our kind,” she hissed. Yeah… definite snake. “I won’t be threatened in my own place of business. I’ve had dealings with your ‘network’ before. They make us hide like rats whenever they come into town, throwing their weight around, interrogating my people!” Dean could feel power radiating from Isla now and Rowena was looking at him like
to Jack instead of showing up with a gun that Cas had never seen before and revenge in his eyes… perhaps the ‘scene’ wouldn’t have been ‘dramatic’ enough for Chuck to barge in with an edit.
Only a thin trickle bled through Castiel's fingers and it was then that he realised how badly damaged his grace was.
"I figure if anyone's got a right to be selfish, it's you," Dean said, "you've already given everything you got. Why shouldn't you get what you want at the end of it?"
Castiel did not enquire, but he recognised the point about scars. They were imperfections on Dean's soul, true, but Castiel had found that they only added to Dean's beauty. They were a testament to what he had been through, a story told through puckered skin and raised tissue. Perhaps they were important to him.
She turned around to face them after placing the now empty box on top of one of the cabinets and folded her arms. “So, what can I help you with?”
"Promise or let you go?"
Dean fiddled with the zipper on his jacket. "I didn't know if you'd answer the door."
Cas' frown deepened. "Rowena did warn us that there might be side-effects to the spell she used on you, it's one of the reasons Sam and I were so against it in the first place. It was something she found in the Grimoire, something that was able to make you powerful enough to fight Lucifer. It was dark magic but Rowena assured us that none of the consequences would be… cosmic. I'll call her tomorrow and see if your memory loss is related. Though, if you feel alright in every other way then I guess a couple of hours of memory lost is probably the best-case scenario."
They all blurred into each other, motel rooms. They were like Biggerson’s, close all the blinds and you could be anywhere. The décor was generic (unless you went to a specifically themed place but that was a whole other ball game), off-white walls, threadbare carpet, linoleum to mark where the kitchenette began, a single framed picture over each bed of a forest or a ship at sea. The chairs were straight-backed and wooden, the sofa had caved in on either side from the weight of so many asses, the TV reception was shoddy, as was the wi-fi, and it was ten to one that the heater was broken. Everything had stains of some kind, the kinds of stains that you could easily ignore if you were only stopping the night, but that once you noticed, you could never un-notice.
When they were about halfway back to the car, Cas once again helping him along as his body decided that enough was enough, there was a sudden, deafening cracking sound from behind them and the earth began to shake violently.
“You and...”
“An angel who sleeps.”
Another few seconds passed, then, because Dean just couldn't stand it anymore, "I love you."
"What the hell did you guys do to the kitchen?!"
There was no blame in the statement, Castiel sought only to understand.
"Well… at least you didn't kill her," came a rough voice from behind him. Dean jumped and spun on the balls of his feet to see Cas standing there, three feet from the open passenger door of the white Muntz, which he hadn't even heard rumbling to a stop.
"It's
Dean turned to him. Cas looked determined and grave.
Cas shook his head, a sad smile on his lips.
“Because it’s right here!” Sam pulled a gun from under his shirt and smacked it down next to his phone. “I had it on me before we left the bunker and Chuck was definitely watching when he sent our evil twins in. He knew I had it and his goal was still to drive us out. If he was worried about the gun he would have found another way to get it away from us by now.”
"It's not relevant."
Without another glance, Dean resumed walking, past the Hell-creature, in the direction of the dungeon. He didn’t check to see if it followed, he knew that it would. The plan was to take it towards the dungeon where it could be more easily contained, though the plan now seemed distant and unimportant.
Having Rowena here would be a distraction from that at least.
“Let’s go,” he said on an exhale. “No point waiting around.”
Dean deflated a little at that. Sam was right. Getting mad wasn’t going to make anything better. He’d learned that the hard way, with Cas. It wasn’t lost on him how they seemed to have completely switched positions from the previous day, with Sam set on a course of action and Dean floundering for ideas, but a lot could change in a day. They’d lost the bunker with the gun and Baby inside and all their hard-won hunting knowledge was on shaky ground; it was a coin-toss as to whether any of it was still useful.
"What's the difference?"
“About our colleague—” Dean began.
There was his beauty in pride of place, of course, even if the grenade launcher would probably be useless against a deity, he'd be willing to bet she could still be a hell of a distraction.
Well… that put paid to Sam's brilliant idea of forcing Dean to talk about it. As soon as he saw Dean bury his face in his hands he cursed, swerved the impala to the side of the road and yanked on the handbrake, then he was out and around, dragging Dean from the car to prop him against it instead, manoeuvring him like a rag doll when he coughed up some bile, forcing his head to the side and leaning him over, rubbing his back soothingly while Dean vomited what looked like the last three days' worth of ingested food and alcohol, trying not to gag at the smell. He didn't think Dean felt it, he wasn't sure he was even conscious; he was trembling and sweating and wheezing hard enough that it sounded like a faulty engine, like a death rattle. Sam clasped Dean's hands in his own, startled at how clammy they felt; he pressed them to his own chest and took slow, measured breaths, in and out, in and out, as rhythmic as he could make them while watching his brother have an actual freaking meltdown.
Donna and Alex were filling a plastic bag with the boxed up food, though there were still a few portions left. Alex wasn't joining them then. Claire tried not to be too disappointed. Alex's job was important and she could get into serious trouble if there was any kind of screw-up with the law and she was caught with the smuggled medical equipment in their go-bags. Not that she had smuggled it for them, Jody would never have asked her to compromise herself like that, but they
. Lauren unlocked the storage room, juggling the box between her hands, and she headed straight for the filing cabinets.
Castiel had tried to mention this to Dean but upon hearing the word 'beautiful' Dean had blushed and scoffed that chicks seemed to dig it before loudly changing the topic, he had also avoided eye contact for several days afterwards. Castiel hadn't broached the topic again.
Now he had nothing. And Cas had even less.
let Sam know that).
To Cas' credit he didn't falter, one hand went straight to Dean's hair, nails scraping gently across his scalp; the other broke free of the grip on his wrist and sought out his shoulder, fingers pressing bruises into the place Castiel had first touched him ten years ago, where he had branded into him a claim, a salvation.
"If I let you go, will you try to run or attack me?" Castiel asked him as they alighted on the non-floor once more. Castiel's legs actually gave out from underneath him as they hit a solid surface and he crumpled ungracefully. That was embarrassing. His wings trembled with strain and he let them relax behind him, not folded tightly into his back or stretched out. Dean eyed them, then eyed him, and shook his head.
“I was just comparing different versions of the Bible,” he said. “But kicking us out the bunker wouldn’t stop us from doing that. I mean, there’s a King James in every motel room,” he gestured to the nightstand, “and the internet is a thing. Pretty sure every religious text ever written is on there if you dive deep enough.”
“What do you mean?” Sam asked, frowning, leaning further forward now, fully focused on the phone.
“Maddie was gay.” Lauren began without preamble, pushing the folder towards him across the table. She looked up at him then, as though waiting for a reaction, and seemed heartened when she didn’t find one. Cas merely folded his hands on top of Madeline’s file and waited for her to continue. “Our parents are good folks, though not everyone in this town is as supportive.” Her dark tone told Castiel exactly what she thought about that. “She always had plenty of friends, moved away to college. She loved people, big cities, you know? Always needed something to do, couldn’t bear being stuck inside. One of the traits you get growin’ up in a farming town.” Lauren’s smile turned wistful.
It was a strange descent. Not only was he getting weaker each day, his wounds taking longer to heal, the power of Hell beating down on him relentlessly, but it felt… empty. It was draining, more draining than he would have expected. Constant battle would have kept him alert, finding his way through twisting paths would have engaged his mind, but as he flew towards Dean Winchester there were no landmarks, no walls, nothing to indicate that there was anything except for the prayers and that tug and the infrequent encounter with a feral creature. He was beginning to get anxious; he had left his siblings to die all so he could complete the mission, but would he even make it that far? Angels were not supposed to be in this place; it was everything they stood against, concentrated and acidic and it was grating on his very grace.
Dean hunched into himself tighter and Sam regretted the question. Now wasn't the time for anger.
"It's okay, Cas. You'll be okay."
“Waste of the taxpayer’s dime,” he muttered instead, which Rowena found extremely amusing, considering she was pretty sure that neither he nor Sam had
The assistant who had spoken to him dipped her head.
. It was simple and comforting. He could do this. He couldn't take away Sam's pain, or fix Jack's soul, or get Cas to open up about whatever was going on with him lately, or even talk right now, but he could sort and fold clothes.
“His bed was slept in, Dean!” Sam said loudly, finally turning back to face him. “He was eating and sleeping and after the cemetery it took him the whole drive home to be able to heal us. He wasn’t as powerful as he used to be. He was taken by surprise and you know as well as anyone that it only takes a second.”
that he couldn't push away anymore.
He'd expected some awkwardness after that conversation but the next morning Sam had caught wind of another case and they'd re-packed the impala and headed out. Castiel didn't hunt much with the Winchesters anymore. Instead he spent his time training Jack in combat. They had all agreed that they would not take Jack on another case until he learned more control over his powers, and Castiel had insisted that when that happened, he would need to know how to fight like a human. Sam and Dean helped out too, Sam taught him more hand-to-hand combat while Dean took over teaching him to shoot and Castiel focused more on the art of fighting with a blade. Jack excelled at all three, though he needed to work on his patience and his instincts, which Dean argued would only come with actual experience out in the world. Castiel was less sure, he wanted to give Jack the opportunity to hone his skills in a safe place where his emotions—and therefore his powers—wouldn't overwhelm him and lead to another accident like Dodge City. He missed hunting but Jack needed him more. He knew that the brothers could handle themselves, but that didn't stop him from worrying. Even if they did check in every couple of days.
Cas didn’t even look at the third sketch, the second one was perfect.
He spent pretty much the rest of the day in the library, though he was making more of a mess than any actual progress. He wasn’t even sure he was looking in the right books. There were several editions of the Bible and a few religious scrolls and cross-referencing them was a bitch. Plus, it only made him angry whenever they praised God, which was all the freaking time, and reiterated how immortal and invulnerable he was. He did his best to channel that anger into his research but a lot of it was leaking out the sides. He kept glancing up whenever a pipe gurgled, in case it was actually Sam coming to help him out, even though he knew the kid probably needed at least a day just to become functional again, let alone employ his galaxy brain to the best of its ability. In the meantime, Dean could at least cross a few things out.
"Wiping you and that wretched bunker from the face of the earth is not a priority." Michael said quietly, a hint of danger in his voice, "But I will get to you eventually, whether my meat suit wants me to or not."
Castiel grimaced, their guess at how Nick had come out of being possessed by an archangel,
He heard the gasp, heard the gulp and the choke, hated himself for it; because Cas would have to live with this moment forever. Dean would be dead with the words no longer stoppering his lungs but Cas would have to carry them around with him for the rest of his life, or at least until he learned how to set them down and leave them behind. Dean didn't like to think about either option.
“Goodnight, Samuel,” she said, closing the door to her room behind her.
Dean glowered at them both but seemed to realise that no denial he could make would work in his favour.
Dean swallowed and tried very hard to keep the hope out of his voice. "Then I'd say there's a pumpkin pie cooling on the counter and Sam's waiting to watch
"I could have destroyed you."
“Good.” Cas said, his face softening to happy. He leaned over to kiss Dean’s temple. “And if
“You idiot,” he said. “You think that would make any difference at all?”
He flopped onto the bed nearest the door and then grunted with pain as an errant spring dug up into his ribs. This mattress was barely worthy of the name and he missed his memory foam. The bunker had spoiled him, having a room for the night had been a luxury growing up; for every night John had left them in a motel there were two spent in the backseat of the impala, which got gradually more and more cramped, especially when Sam hit his growth spurt in his teens.
. And I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I wanted to stop the apocalypse!”
It took him a moment to realise why; he was standing outside Jack’s room.
road more times than he could count, no, he just… he didn't want to spend his last minutes in a stone box listening to Cas lose his freaking mind.
So there you have it. The fix-it fic that a lot of people asked for. I hope it lived up.
The rain and wind was louder against the warded corrugated steel shutter in the garage. The thing used to have to be unlocked from the ground, then raised or lowered by hand but soon after arriving, Dean had engineered a simple mechanism that meant it could be done remotely. At least,
“It sounds like Chuck has changed the rules.” Castiel said carefully.
” Cas said, and was that… exhaustion in his voice? “It’s what you say, it’s what you do. What you mean doesn’t actually mean anything unless you can back it up.”
Sometimes he took the lyrics at face value, took comfort in a song that told him to just keep on chugging. It was more soothing than any of those stupid cross-stitched messages that adorned the walls of far too many homes in his opinion. Stuff like
"You looked through his mind?" Castiel bristled, voice shaking with rage. Another flash of lightning charged the air with static and the thunder wasn't far behind, a low roar of immense power that made his ears pop with the pressure of it. Castiel could taste the electricity, bitter and sharp on his tongue, it tasted like wrath.
She still had a haunted look though so he offered her a seat and she took it, he sat down too, flipping open the first file for Leslie Pratt. “How about we start with the accident victim and work our way through, if you don’t mind. Sheriff Wyatt wasn’t very… forthcoming and I’d like to get a full picture before I form any theories.”
"Just living. I like the sound of that."
Castiel grinned, ignoring the way his chest seemed to clench at the words,
Dean sung quietly, his voice scratchy and ever so slightly out of time,
Leave a comment or come find me
“What makes you think it’s the gun?” Sam said, confrontational now, as though this was an old argument. Or an ongoing one.
“Okay,” Dean said, keeping his voice low as he turned to her with a couple of worn band t-shirts and some half-decent plaid folded over his arm, his patience officially run out. “You’re older than everybody in here and right now, it shows.”
that I was doing it and I knew that he was too but I never really thought about it. Man, now that you've said it it sounds so stupid."
"This is not your fault, okay? So this plan didn't work out, it was a long shot, but we'll come up with something else and we won't give up. We'll get him back, Cas. We will. I believe that."
bad day, they binned the clothes they'd been wearing, like the garments were cursed in the way that children thought of curses, like bad luck magnets rather than the far more real eyeball melting, skin bubbling, throwing up pins kind of curses that they dealt with on the daily.
His eyes were tacky with sleep and he rubbed them clear, the rough cloth of the bandages helping to kick-start his brain again. He stretched, bones popping, muscles complaining, and rolled out of bed, heading for the shower. So priorities had changed, he would clean his own blood off the walls first, and then he could get back on track.

So he spread his wings once more and flew past the remaining cages, towards the source of the tug. Attacks from Hell's swarms were becoming more frequent now as he delved deeper, more twisted creatures lunged at him from the dark, those that had forgotten what light was. He reminded them with a flash of grace; eyes burned, demons howled and alerted others. They were all searching for him, he knew it; they knew that he was inside and they knew what he was there for, it was only luck that the very nature of Hell made it difficult to find anything at all, including an angel actively trying to avoid detection.
Cas stepped into the room, confused and worried, why wasn't Dean in here, where would he go? The bed had clearly been slept in so what on earth had caused Dean to get up before six am?
(See the end of the chapter for
Whoop.
expression that Dean almost laughed, almost, because his courage was draining away fast and he used the last of it to skirt around the table and press himself into Cas' space, sliding a hand around the back of the angel's neck and up into his hair, gently holding him in place while he leaned forward to claim a kiss. His other hand was still grasping at Cas' sleeve, but before he could worry that this was too much, that he'd crossed a boundary he could never undo, that he'd just ruined
“Um… Agent Cyrus, are you alright?”
and expect me to come running. It’s over, I’m
"It actually went really smooth, Cas," Sam carried on in his reassuring way, "once we figured out what we were up against we made a couple of silver witch-killing bullets and iced him before he could curse Melissa too. Dean got there first but the guy hadn't actually started the ritual yet so he waited for me to get there before we went in. It actually gave me an idea, if we can combine all the bullets we need on a regular basis: iron, silver, gold, devil's trap, witch, and coat them in dead man's blood then we'll have all the basics covered in one round. Of course it won't work for everything, and it'll take a lot of work to make them, but it could really help us narrow down what we're looking for if one of those doesn't work."
"Take me back." Dean said after a pause.
As he said that, one of the lightsaber-wielding children came charging behind them, shrieking with laughter. Rowena almost stumbled over her when she turned to find a booth. Pursing her lips in disapproval, she headed for the booth furthest away and didn’t look back to see if Sam and Dean followed her. She slid into the cracked vinyl and winced when a particularly sharp piece snagged on her skirt. Sam came next, and then Dean, forcing her to shuffle around to make room so that Dylan could have a side to himself.
Nani remained stony-faced as she passed the two one-dollar bills back and forth between her sister and the shelter lady. Dean grinned, remembering a time when snot-nosed little Sammy had forced him into that exact exchange for a book he'd seen at a flea market they'd been passing. Too small to see what was on the tables, Sam had been hoisted onto Dean's shoulders while John moved to a different stall to inspect some army surplus stuff. Sammy had almost poked one of his eyes out to get his attention when he spotted the book and Dean made a great show of picking out several wrong ones, one of which was about knitting, much to the amusement of the round-faced, matronly woman who was manning the stall. He'd rolled his eyes at his brother's insistence that
" Sam disputed, "he's more confident than I've ever seen him.
There was a pause and the lights flickered. Dean tensed, eyes darting around the garage, but they settled again and stayed steady. Cas glanced up, shaking his head.
the blade, there are no archangels left! We're not ready." Perhaps he had deliberately misspoken. What he had meant was that
When Sam had compared him to Chuck,
“So… you don’t have an appointment.” Dean concluded.
Cas was grateful for the reassurance, but he was still nervous. He just didn’t want to be disappointed. This felt important and he didn’t want to mess it up by choosing the wrong thing. The artist, Giva Chaudhary, was exceptionally talented, but none of the images in her portfolio had really spoken to him. He was worried that they would get there and she would be unable to produce the thing he wanted on his skin forever and he would either have to go home with nothing, or settle for something that was less than perfect.
"Is there anything I can do?" Cas' voice was carefully bland, the way Dean knew he got when he was trying not to pry despite his curiosity. He appreciated it, especially with that fear crawling just beneath his skin.
Castiel raised his hand to his face, sure enough, his fingers came away wet. He wiped at his cheeks impatiently with the back of his hand and then he sighed, letting go of all his anger at Jack in one breath. The boy's logic was sound after all, it wasn't his fault that Castiel was incapable of listening.
The song faded over to
"Leave that one."
“How long did you think you’d be staying with us anyway?” Dean grumbled, lugging two suitcases and a large pink holdall. Sam had the remaining case and his own ratty duffle.
"And now he doesn't."
Dean scoffed. “Yeah. But I can't help wondering what the point of that is. The second we get a grasp on ’em, Chuck can just change ’em again.” He let out a sigh and glanced at the hallway to make sure Rowena wasn’t on her way. Her door was still closed but even so, Dean dropped his voice. “Don’t you think it’s kinda… hopeless?” He said, looking at his brother, silently begging him to understand that he wasn’t giving up, he just… he needed to say it. “I mean, we’ve spent our whole lives, more than thirty years learning what these things are and how to kill ’em to keep a fight fair between super strength and magic and whatever-the-hell-else kind of powers they can throw at us. And there have been thousands of hunters before us, learning this stuff, writing it down, passing it on since the beginning of freaking humanity. The bunker library’s full of journals to stab this thing seven times with a bamboo shard blessed by a Shinto priest, or to chop off that thing’s head, or to return that other thing to its own grave and trap it in with a specific kind of wood stake. And now none of that matters. History,
It took half a heartbeat for his confession to sink into Cas' face, when it did, those blue eyes widened in surprise, his chapped lips parted to form an 'o' and that frown stayed put, it was such a ridiculously
“A domestic dispute?”
“Err… Well… I suppose you could say I come from a very strict background,” he began, picking his words carefully. “When I first met Dean, more than a decade ago now, I pulled him from a dark place; it was a duty for me at the time, to keep an eye on him, look out for him and his brother, to try and keep them on the righteous path. Dean… Dean disliked being led.” He felt a small smile tugging at his lips. “I found myself admiring that, helping him more that I was supposed to and as I grew closer to Dean, I began to see my family for what they truly were. They tried to get me back, keep me under their control but I fought for my freedom because Dean showed me how.”
“That’s… concerning.”
“You guys, uh—” Dean said, his voice thick with an emotion she couldn’t quite identify. “You guys don’t really think that... do you?”
to do nothing.
"No." If he said it firmly enough, if he believed it hard enough, maybe he could make it true.
That feeling was building in him again, watching Dean so unrestrained, talking about something he liked that didn't have anything to do with hunting, Castiel's questions encouraged him to take tangents, some childhood stories about teaching Sam to drive, about the first time a car he'd jacked for a case had broken down on him; he never seemed to tire, and so Castiel kept questioning, as many questions as he could think of, some Dean found more ridiculous than others, but he answered them all. When there were no more questions to ask they headed back inside, where Sam was making dinner.
"Well alright then," Dean said, nodding, staring out into the dark corridor, the light of the kitchen bouncing strangely off the tiles, making the shadows curl into eerie shapes; he took a step forward and took Cas' hand with him, their fingertips had hooked together, although Castiel didn't remember moving them. Dean took a breath and another step and Castiel's hand fell back to his side. Dean didn't look back, although he hesitated in the doorway for half a second, his head turned to his shoulder as though he was about to say something and Castiel felt a sudden rush of panic, but the moment passed and Dean continued around the corner and out of sight.
was balking at the idea of experiencing that pain a second time, he certainly wouldn't last another thirty years.
ever wanted to face, she was sure of that much.
Castiel found Dean, as he had so many times before, sitting at the kitchen table, a beer in hand and despair etched into every crease of his face. Dark shadows framed his eyes and his hand trembled slightly as he lifted the bottle to drink, his throat working slow to get as much beer as he could between each swallow; another nightmare, then.
"What's up?" Dean appears from fresh out of his shower.
"Well, I know you're in love with Dean for starters." Her glance shifts to Cas, gauging his reaction. Not disgust, always a good sign, but a face of guilt. Perfect. "Now don't say anything just yet. I'm glad you have fallen for my boy! I'm not going to give you a hard time about it either. Now, am I right here?"
This could be bad. When he heard his brother ask for them to move to the library, he ducked into the doorway he was creeping next to waiting for them to pass. After he heard the two people he loved most talking, he moved to a new vantage point so he could hear them. Sam was talking. Great.
he had messed up.
"So, what have you eaten today?" This is a strange questions. Cas didn't find this when he searched for conversation starting questions for when he talked with Dean. Well Cas was determined to answer anyways. He had thought it over, and decided that if he was completely honest with Sam then he would help get this thing with Dean sorted out.
that."
"Hey Dean, is there anything you need me to pick up for you at the store?" If Sam wasn't such a good brother he would laugh at how pathetic Dean was being.
Cas woke up sweaty with soiled boxers. There was no
Dean feels the full effect of the call from his father.
Non-the-less, Dean gave him the jacket. Dean didn't know what reaction he was expecting when he gave Cas his jacket, but a
"Love you too Cas." Dean admits with the warmth for his bestfriend filling his heart.
"Hmm Cas. I've wanted to do this for a long time. You're a hot little thing you know that? Hng!! So hot Cas. Love those eyes, that sex-hair, those kissable lips." Dean was
"But seriously, do you know how long I've waited for this? Years, people,
"I remember a year ago when Dean's father told him that if he didn't stop seeing you and sleeping in the same bed as you, he'd kill you. Dean got so pissed that he stormed off and we didn't see him for three days! He found out later he ran off to Charlie's. That was the few weeks when Dean ignored you and started sleeping around with girls. It wasn't anything you did. He never told you but it was because he was scared for your life, Castiel." Mary recalls with a distant worry in her eyes. "Don't hurt him, which I know you won't. You see why I know he's so devoted to you." They walk in silence for a moment before Cas decides to speak.
"It's ringing." Cas cuts through his spiraling thoughts as though he knew they weren't happy ones. Before Dean can properly reply, Cas' phone call is answered.
"Thank you, Cas. I won't let him hurt you, I promise."
"I get that, I really do. But Hun, we won't always know everything. Not even what we feel like we should know. Worry is a part of life, as is pain. We unfortunately just have to live with that. We will all be fine, and if not, we will live with a few scrapes and bruises physically, mentally, or both. We will all survive, and that's all that really matters." Dean nods again not trusting his voice anymore, Mary always knew just what to say. Dean cleared his throat.
Movie night was fun. Mary, Cas, and Dean watched How To Train Your Dragon and ate junk until they couldn't fit any more food for fear of passing out. Or combustion.
"No it's fine. Just as long as you tell me why..."
Half way through his brooding, Sam walked in with a look of concern. Dean was ready for him to laugh and say something rude and moose-like, and was pleasantly surprised when it didn't come. Not that that did anything to improve his mood. What he really needed was for Cas to love him. Ya right. Then his brother asked him if he wanted anything. Booze. He had basically just cooked everything in the kitchen so maybe something so he could cook some more. That sounds good. After his brother left he went right back to drinking and
"Do you have any more stories I'll never get to hear elsewhere?" Mary smiles at the question. She's more than happy to share her knowledge of their relationship. It was something she had dreamed of doing and had no reason to stall herself now.
"Cas, buddy, please. We'll talk about this in the morning. Ok? But you need to not be here right now. Ok? You're not fully you." Ok. Dean Winchester doesn't worry. Not like this. But he wanted to do
Dean turns to Cas and sees him, luckily, still asleep. Dean wishes he could say his boyfriend looks peaceful but that was the least accurate description. His eyes look a bit puffy from lack of sleep and he was still tossing and turning as though he had been all night.
onto his bed he was asleep. Thank God. His breathing was still heavy though, and Dean thought he heard Cas moan "Dean" a few times. Dean went back into his own room, and after 20 minutes or so, he decided to take care of himself in the bathroom, take another shower, then go to bed. He was totally ignoring any thoughts of what could have happened in his room if he had given into Castiel's buzzed wishes as he... dealt with himself. And he didn't cum all over the shower to the thought of Cas moaning underneath him with those innocent, blue eyes of his lust blown. Oh and Dean Winchester was neither gay nor bi! Just, maybe a little bit for Cas...
"Ya night Sammy." Ok. Cas had waaaaay too much to drink. He wouldn't stop
"Oh. oh! Shit, um, just thinking about what mom said. You moving in and all that. I've already cleared another drawer for you, so you can bring more stuff. And the bed mom got us er um,
"Um. Well... I'm in love with your brother. I'm in love with one Dean Winchester."
Dean Winchester is also neither gay nor bisexual. That said, he wasn't in love with his fallen angel friend. He simply thought he looked outstanding in his old clothes. The way it showed his shoulders and collarbone from time-to-time was purely addicting.
Okay, he can reason that wanting to settle down is more of a sign of maturity than desperation, but some of his other major character flaws rattle his head just to think about. A beer would help this therapy session for one cruise along, a couple fingers of whiskey would help a hell of a lot better.
Dean knows that he is not
"Nah, not anymore." Dean stalks over to Cas and puts a hand just above his hip., slightly startling the blue-eyed boy. As soon as Cas turns around to face Dean with a surprised expression, Dean presses his lips to the irresistible ones presented to him. It's blissful and for a few moments, the two forget about the other people in the room... That is until Mary makes a noise that Dean swears can't be human.
Dean tries to smile in relief. "Thank you, Mom. Sounds perfect." Mary gives him a nod and a kiss on the cheek before saying goodbye and heading out with her phone in hand.
"Well, we weren't gone for very long."
"What is it
"Night Cas."
And then, Cas get's to the actual cone part, but he first takes his tongue and flicks it down, and
"I would like you to explain sex to me." Fuck life.
"Then why are you yelling at Cas?"
"I've wanted to do this for so long angel. The way you look in my old shirts? Hottest thing I've ever seen. Wanted to fuck you on the couch last night baby. Looked so good in my jacket angel." Dean jumped up for just long enough to rid Cas of his pants before he climbed back on.
Dean looks at everyone, at Mary and Cas, at Sam who just finished another 300-page book. He smiles to himself. The feeling growing in his chest as he smiles brighter while a chuckle tries to loosen the glowing fondness around his heart. Before he knows it, he's laughing harder than he has all week. Everyone looks up at him with confused faces. After a few minutes, he regains his composure.
"Be careful, he doesn't like to talk about feelings like that." Cas also knows that Dean just doesn't want his already stressed mother to be disappointed in him. Unfortunately, John had left a few scars that weren't physical. At least Dean had grown to trust Cas.
"I'm sorry to interrupt and all, but your son isn't some.. some
"Cas? Buddy? I know you're looking up some stuff on Nephilims with Sam but I have something important to tell you. Keep a straight face or get somewhere private. Don't come sniffing me down either, left my phone at the bunker on my way out the door." Dean bites his bottom lip in frustration. He sounds like he's angry and he's trying not to freak Castiel out here. As much as possible.
was a gentlemen and would never take advantage of a sexual partner while drunk.
"I wouldn't have it any other way." Mary hands Dean his plate, and sits at the head of the table, across from Sam. Cas plops down to Mary's right and Dean in front of him.
Cas continues jerking himself quick to the speed of his mouth bobbing on the hard shaft that's leaking precum into his mouth, some dribbling past his lips to trail down his cheeks. Luckily, the water washed it away as soon as it appeared. Neither of the boys was going to last long, Dean shaking slightly against the shower tiles and Cas' mouth practically going slack. With a few more quick thrusts into his boyfriend's mouth, just shy of gagging him, he was spilling down Castiel's throat. The sounds coming from Dean along with the taste of him sent Cas over the edge as well.
at her did you? Wait...Did you?!"
"He'll hurt you." The words force more trembles out of the older boy. He can't bear the thought of Cas getting hurt because of him. Dean doesn't want to lose Cas. The thought scares him to the point where he couldn't care less if Mary or Sam saw him cry, the shame adding to the burning trail of tears racing down his cheek. He can't relive those weeks where he ignored Cas for the same reason he's shaking now.
"Then I'll tell you when my heat comes and you can take care of me. For now though, I'll just take care of the dishes. You have to go put some clothes on babe. I don't think Sam wants to see all that flaming libido."
"Bet you want me to ride you soo good. Wanna be my good little boy huh Cas?
"I know Honey, I know." They spent the rest of their walk home in comfortable silence, arms linked and Mary's head on Cas' shoulder.
"You know I love you no matter what, right?"
"Maybe you just haven't picked up as many tricks as you thought Sammmmmmmy."
"Shhh. Come on baby boy. You know I got you. Gonna make this soooo good for my precious little angel." Dean reached his hand down Cas' boxers, (
"Can you
"Well, what did she want?"
don't leave." Wow. That was sweet, making Cas feel all sorts of things trying to figure out what exactly Dean was dreaming about.
"Sure thing Dean."
"Morning Sammy!" Dean exclaims with a cheeky smile, "I'm bi!"
"I'm going to open my hole until it's just dripping for you, but I'll do it slowly. So slow it tortures you more than me." Cas wonders just what he would do when Dean wakes up. How would he get Dean and himself to become romantically involved? Should he just wait until Mary hinted at something, and just agree instead of denying? He isn't sure how to go about this. He'll figure it out in the morning. Now, he was going to sleep because he already got the information he needed. He shifted back into Dean, ignoring the small puffs of air as his dream trekked on and fell asleep.
"So what did you want to talk with me about? You don't just drag me up here like that for no reason." Cas looks at Dean's face. Not the right expression for "I need to talk to you Cas, alone."
Dean is pondering all the things they can do while Mary and Sam are out when he gets a devilish idea to tease his now boyfriend. "Tell you what, I'm going to give you... thirty? No, twenty minutes to get ready for me in any way you want. Wear as many or as little clothes as you wish and open yourself as much as you want to be open. I'm setting the timer now so get ready. That ok with you?"
"Ya, ya 'm fine."
"Dean, here's yours, Cas, and then mine!" Perfectly timed Sam interrupted right in the middle of Cas saying something.
don't leave." Dean really did want to see Cas. They hadn't seen each other in a long time, and he wanted to see Cas as much as he could now.
Dean looks over at Cas, who was already falling asleep and decides to try and do the same.
His blue eyes were wide and dark, half lidded, and begging. Thats when Dean realized what Cas was begging
"Nothing much, just some... um. Chocolate." Dean has to physically refrain himself from licking at Cas' neck right then.
"Dean, it's ok. He's not here. He won't hurt you." Dean looks up at Cas as anger and worry flash through his eyes.
"Mhgfsjm!!!!" Castiel agreed through his gag. Dean was glad Cas loved him back and all but he was all play right now with no brain space for romance.
The thought is enough to make Dean blush so he spins in his chair to try to hide it. He knows he's in deep with Cas, but he is still too scared to make any sort of move on the blue eyed boy. He remembers when they were in 4th grade and Meg had a crush on Cas. Cas was so disgusted, scared, and shy that he would hide behind Dean whenever she showed up. Dean remembers how cute he was clutching to Dean's arm and peeking up at his green eyes with his equally blue ones. He remembers telling Meg to go away and stop torturing his friend, remembers the rushing feeling to protect Cas. Dean still thinks it's cute how whenever a girl, or the occasional guy, will flirt with Cas, he still just hides behind Dean slightly with a blush on his face. He fills with pride knowing that Cas feels so safe with him. It only makes sense, they practically live together. Dean looks to Cas' two drawers in Dean's dresser. They're filled with clothes and even some toiletries for when he stays over, which is practically every night. Cas' toothbrush is in the bathroom, right next to Dean's
"Dean
"Relax Dean! I was just giving him the same speech I gave Jess."
"Well, "morning look" is certainly a different... appearance from my usual one I suppose." Cas said with a slight smirk as he sat down. He almost didn't want to end Dean's staring at him, but he knew it meant nothing.  The former angel had been pinning over Dean for years, and had grown used to the feel of sadness that came with his one-sided love for the hunter, that somehow increased with his new human status.
Dean needs to get out of this line of thinking if he ever wants to get over Cas.
yes!" Dean swoops down, leaning over Cas with green eyes almost even with the black of his pupils. He looks down at the long expanse of skin and muscle below him, all for his own. He a rush shoots through his nerves thinking how no one else would ever see
him through prayer to get their brothers to "just bang already". Lastly Gabriel mojoed some lube into Cas' hole and flew them to Dean's room.
“Just go in and do it right” Dean thought to himself as he opened to door and stepped inside, praying to all his deities that he wouldn't look like an idiot or drown in his own sweat.
he knew Cas was just being strange and his almost flirtatious words were
"What is it, Dean?"
is." What was
"WELL, I got the result I was wanting, but I still have to worry about the actual conversation."
It must have a time limit too if Dean was pushing her so hard. Someone was in danger. But it wasn’t family, or the scant inch between the pedal and the floor wouldn’t be there.
Jack bit his lip but lowered his gaze and began to carve out the J. It took quite a while, Jack seemed very intent on making the edges as neat as he could; woodchips occasionally pinged around the room and Jack's tongue poked out between his teeth as he concentrated, the weight of the task at hand seemed to have sobered him almost entirely and his hands were steady. When the first letter was done, Jack paused, blew away the dust and looked up again.
Cas pressed his lips to Dean's cheek before stepping back, taking his hand.
She was much too tired to try and figure out any of the last 24 hours right now. After pulling her cases from the bed and onto the floor she climbed between the lavender-scented sheets and hoped that it wouldn’t seem so bad in the morning.
"Like… outside of the bunker?"
"Don't test me, Michael. I will protect my family."
"And if that were your only reason, you'd be an asshole," Sam said conversationally, "but it's not. Don't be so hard on yourself."
“Oh, so
which is another reason I need to leave. I'm adding nothing right now. I can't keep these people safe, I can't convince you that our choices matter, I can't stop you being angry or come up with a solution about what to do next, I'm not even sure I can
Once the healing was done, Castiel raised his palm to Dean's head. He felt an intense sorrow that Dean was not going to recall anything about him, but Heaven had a plan, and Castiel was made to follow that plan.
Dean shifted his grip on the body and began to drag it up the stairs of the war room. This one was a large man, bald, terry-cloth green shirt with streaks of sticky red on the front and black, burned holes where his eyes should have been. His heavy, military-style boots clunked and caught on each step as Dean tried to angle him to make for easier carrying. His back and arms screamed with the effort, that all-too-human bunch and seize of muscles that he'd never thought he'd live to experience. It sucked. In multiple ways, it sucked.
Sam bobbed his head slowly, not judging, just considering. "Maybe."
"God may have invented the concept of free will, but Dean gave me mine," Castiel said, shaking the image from his mind before it changed to something even worse, "and I can't let his story end the way that Heaven said it would. I was supposed to prove them wrong. Dean told me I could prove them wrong."
Cas didn’t deserve. He had forgiven him for Mary, wasn’t sure he’d ever really blamed him in the first place. He could still barely believe that two weeks ago he’d had everything: his brother, his mother, his son and his best friend. Things had been stable, or as stable as they ever got. Michael was gone, his family was happy, he and Cas were… well… he’d felt like he had the time to figure it out.
isn't one."
Dean rolled his eyes, "See, this here is the carburettor," he said, pointing to a large chunk of metal in the hood of the car, before launching into a lecture of what it was used for and how it worked and how it connected to other parts. Castiel let the topic change easily and peppered Dean with questions simple and complex that kept Dean talking for hours, his eyes alight with pride when he asked Castiel a question and received the correct answer. After he fixed the problem on the continental, walking Castiel through every step, he kept going, and even showed him around the garage and pointed out some of his favourites of the old cars and what made them special (Baby of course was in a category all her own). Castiel was fascinated, less by the cars and more by Dean's passion for them.
Castiel sniffed and pressed play, then re-wind, then play again to get it to the beginning of the next song,
Sam's smile grew and he nodded. Dean said nothing, though he looked between the two of them for a moment before snorting and starting on the soup.
Dean laughed, okay, it was half a laugh, half an extended, pained cough. It was a horrible, hacking sound, not one that could be passed off as anything other than concerning. "Man, I'm so glad I made you watch Star Wars."
Castiel smiled, suddenly sad that he would never see Dean Winchester restored to life. "No, Dean. My wings are too deeply damaged, it would take more grace than I possess to heal them enough to fly again, and changing my form into something non-sentient would be permanent."
They pulled up at the bar and headed inside. It was busy despite the early hour. Couples and families sat in booths around large, greasy-looking pizzas and bowls of chicken nuggets. Rowena wrinkled her nose, fine dining was clearly not the goal here. There was a large space towards the back with music playing from a battered jukebox which she assumed was supposed to be a dance floor. There were very few people taking advantage however, just a sickeningly sweet elderly couple practising what looked to be a salsa and a few of children running around, bashing each other with toy lightsabers while their exasperated parents stared at their menus like they might offer a full night’s sleep alongside dessert.
"Of course I chose it." He said warily, shifting his grip on the blade.
“Wow. Subtle subject change, Dean, real smooth.”
left the bunker to find and kill Jack. Would have done it too if God hadn’t showed up and made it into a game, as though killing a kid he’d helped care for and teach and raise wasn’t the ugliest thing that had ever crossed his mind. As though seeing his son kneel there, guilt and acceptance in his eyes hadn’t just about shattered whatever was left of his warped heart.
He got out of the car and hobbled back over to Cas, who raised an eyebrow at his leg but said nothing.
to throw himself into the Pit. He remembered countless fights they'd won while unarmed or disadvantaged, he remembered shooting Azazel in the face, he remembered slicing his way through Purgatory when he'd arived there with only a blade barely one step up from a butter knife. He remembered Cas glowing, yelling for them to shut their eyes as he smote a diner full of jefferson starships. He remembered being lost outside a military base with his brother and reminding their pursuers that
… Dean, this plan won't take your life. You will be trapped with Michael in a box in the middle of the ocean for eternity; fighting for control, kept alive through his grace. Even when he takes over, you think he will be kind to you? You think he'll just send you back to that bar to be buried in contentment? You think he'll let you die?"
"Sam… what… what am I gonna tell him?"
"Because you said you were fine."
So Dean held his brother while he broke down, allowed himself to feel the years of repressed loss and disappointment, everything shut away came tumbling into the glaring light and could no longer be ignored.
it isn’t.” Rowena countered with an irritating
Dean looked up at him with haunted eyes and seemed to sense that Sam was not in the mood to be brushed off.
"Excuse me?"
“Right.” Dylan didn’t look convinced, and Rowena had to agree that Dean’s shock was a bit much. Sure, Castiel was an angel but she’d seen him inhale coffee and swipe the occasional potato chip. Then again, she thought of that rumpled bed in the motel room. If he’d gone out of his way to order food then it hadn’t been for Jacob’s benefit.
"Alright, stand still," Castiel instructed, raising his hand once more. Dean shuffled a little but did as he was told.
“Ahh.” Dylan said, none the wiser. “I guess. Well, anyway, that’s where they went.”
Cas sat in the waiting room of the tattoo parlour, tapping his foot nervously while Dean sat next to him. Dean had insisted on coming with him and Castiel hadn’t thought to object, the last time he’d gotten a tattoo he’d been alone, and although the pain was minimal compared to some of the torments he’d endured as an angel, experiencing it as human pain was different and he had wished for company, even if Dean only would have mocked him and compared him to an infant.
“As long as necessary.” She held out her hand. “Keys?”
"But he's not-"
As per their tradition, yesterday's clothes had been dumped in a pile by the door, ready to be disposed of. Dean wondered why Sam hadn't taken them out to the dumpster himself on his way out this morning, but then he shook himself, Sam probably hadn't been able to bring himself to touch them after taking them off. Their little ritual had apparently become full-blown superstition. Whatever, Sam had at least two other pairs of jeans and more shirts than he could stuff into three drawers, if getting rid of these ones would help ease his brother's mind then it was hardly out of his way. He retrieved his own clothes from the previous day and a black trash bag. He thought about going to Jack's room to request the same thing but wasn't sure how, or even if the kid would be interested, he had far fewer clothes than either of the brothers.
Sam tilted his head, considering, "I dunno, I mean, I suppose I should probably catch up on some chores, I know there's a bunch of laundry to do."
Castiel shook his head, "You don't have to," he said with a sigh, "I'm not sure it's even making a difference."
And Dean was a damn good hunter. He had saved not only the world but hundreds of individuals over the years, surely that counted for something. Or was Castiel just trying to paper over the sick feeling in his stomach that burned like acid when he thought about living on without Dean? These past ten years had been barely a few milliseconds in the span of his life but they were undoubtedly the most important. Dean had changed everything for him and after a long series of harsh lessons, now that he was just starting to remember what it felt like to be sure of himself and what that
“I do have a question of my own, if you would indulge me.”
"Not so common anymore." Castiel replied, refusing to let his stoic exterior slip. That
, and not in the more familiar case-gone-wrong, weight-of-the-world kind of way, not even in his almost constant self-disparaging way, this was deeper, this was
Castiel had been around beauty for as long as he could remember. Angels were beautiful creatures; each one's true form was exquisite and dazzling in its own uniqueness. Heaven too was richly decorated; not the utilitarian corridors and artificial perfection of the office spaces of the angels, but the heavens themselves; each one was intricately woven to a person's own bliss, containing wonders glimpsed or imagined, music and light and sights natural and man-made that adorned every room. Even the simpler ones of beloved homes or comforting—though not necessarily aesthetic—places had a texture to them that made everything just a little more pleasing to look on. No two were exactly the same but they were all beautiful.
Still, he set to work; stairs first, methodically working his way back from the door, attacking every little smear of blood, every speck of red, every loose fibre from a shirt or pair of pants. Removing the drag marks, the fine specks of dirt he'd tracked in from the multiple trips and all the evidence of the past few months of foot traffic. Water and soap sloshed in his bucket, the mop slapped onto the stone with each pass. He mopped the whole staircase first, and then he got a thick brush and set to scrubbing. Sam would want to stay outside until the pyres had finished their work, which would take hours, what with the sheer amount of heat it would take to burn all those corpses. At least he wouldn't freeze.
Should he go back and get them at some point? Or should he ask Sam to send them on if he found somewhere steady? He would want them back when that happened; they might not be treasures but they were his, and what else did he have to show for his existence? His wings were beyond repair and useless, his siblings either hated him or were indifferent, his father was gone, hopefully for good and the friends he had clung so tightly too had finally managed to shove him off.
"Would you know if she were?"
Jack lifted his bowl to drink the remaining milk and then stood to place it and his spoon in the sink before turning back to them,
"I'm real glad we did this, Cas," Sam said quietly, watching the branches of a willow tree where they trailed lazy patterns in the water, "I don't know how he knew that this was what I needed but..." he gestured at the beautiful scene around them, the beginnings of spring making itself known; flowers beginning to emerge from the earth, greenery budding on branches, the sound of demanding chicks hassling their poor parents for food. They'd taken a walk around the lake, the three of them, left Dean sleeping, though Cas had made sure to keep the area within reach of his enhanced senses, just in case. They'd returned not twenty minutes ago, and all of them seemed much calmer for it.
He swallowed hard and looked away, placing his hand over the cuts and sending healing grace through it to close them.
him. And saying it had sealed his doom.
Dean was content to be ignored for the moment. He watched the two women warily. The tension between them had vanished and now they were having an in-depth discussion on the properties of fairy wings in spells (apparently there were many, but they were very hard to come by which led them on to talking about some of the best substitutes). In less than five minutes, they seemed to have gone from potential rivals to best friends and Dean wondered if any of it was genuine.
"Sam never complains when you cook something from scratch," Castiel said casually, taking his place at the table. He didn't look at Dean, he knew that the hunter got uncomfortable when Castiel stared at him in moments like this, sometimes he ignored that in favour of getting his point across, but Castiel didn't want Dean to think of his comment as having any significance on his part, he just wanted to give him the words to mull over in his own time.
If you want a (very small) head start on the next chapter, or if you want to read some Tumblr exclusive stuff I've done, you can find me
"Hey, open your eyes, you winged dick," came a ragged voice from in front of him. Automatically Castiel obeyed and the hard edges of Dean Winchester's face swam into view.
"Where are you?" Cas was all business now, and he could hear the light static of air passing through the speaker as the phone moved, keys jingled in the background, the sound of a door.
Phew, so I'm running late and I really need to go to bed but I'm on a roll and had to get it done on time.
A few minutes later Dean came back in, a lilac towel wrapped around his waist and a positively
“I can’t manifest my wings,” Cas said quietly, “but I want you to see them as I see them. They are perhaps the thing I miss most about my old life; the symbol of what I was, powerful and grand and sure. But I’m not bound by their rules anymore. And what I am has changed into something more compressed, more human but infinitely more free. That transformation is largely because of you, Dean, and I can’t thank you enough.”
"Michael-"
"I apologise for any discomfort," he said instead before using his wings to propel him forwards quicker than the soul could retreat. He grasped it by the shoulder and the Righteous Man screamed as his flesh sizzled from the contact with his grace.
He wondered if there would just be a Cas-shaped hole in his life forever now, merging with all the other gaps where people should be. He quickly dispelled that thought. No. Cas’ loss stood on its own. How could it not? Cas hadn’t become bound to them by blood or circumstance, he had chosen them. Even when they let him down, even when he’d been misguided or manipulated or straight up reprogrammed, he had always found a way to choose them. And that loyalty had in turn given Dean something to believe in, a faith that he’d lost when he was four years old.
“Regardless. Seeing as I’m here I’d like your records of all six deaths. And any information you have on the victims would be much appreciated.”
Cas sighed and dropped back into his seat, hands still wet where he hadn't dried them properly before Jack's outburst. He flicked the droplets of moisture off as though they were offensive, eyes trained on the door Jack had just vanished through.
, his mind hissed at him,
gesture.
He'd mentioned it briefly to Sam, just a 'isn't it funny how this song is always playing, no matter what state we're in?' Sam had just shrugged and said he hadn't noticed. Of course, Sam had never really been into music the way he was.
This moment was a gift, like the tape, something to keep and carry around with him as proof that Dean cared.
"Whoah! Hold up, I'm not
Michael scoffed, even as a stronger wave of light shimmered from Dean's soul, even as that spark glowed a little brighter in Michael's eye. Michael straightened his posture, forcing Dean back down. "This has to be done." He said, his voice empty, "For what it's worth, your…
“Do you… do you need me to come back?”
