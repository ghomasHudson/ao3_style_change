Sherlock snaps his mouth shut and shifts his eyes over to John, who is looking back at him with a disarming smile.
Lestrade and Molly look at each other. “Well.” Lestrade slings an arm around her shoulders, and looks back to Sherlock with a glint in his eye. “We have dinner.”
I could feel myself racing precipitously to release--it was not in the cards for me to last very long--and all too soon I spent myself inside Holmes.
“I know you think little of such things,” I said without pause, having anticipated Holmes’s dismissal, “but it would mean the world to me for you to be my spouse, in that way."
this, and Sherlock’s never not known the parameters, when it comes to them. What does John like? How much does he want? Sherlock should know the answers. He’s observed John in relationships before. (Are they in a relationship? They’ve not classified it. Shouldn’t they be talking about it? Isn’t that what people do?) But he is having a difficult time coalescing historical data into something he can use to his advantage; he feels unsettled and unsure and he can’t
Mycroft’s regarding him with a shadow of amusement. “It’s a fundamental human trait to create meaning where there wasn’t any before.”
She flattens said lovely, perky tits against John’s chest, and they’re soft, so soft, and she wraps her thin arms around his neck, purring in his ear, “Are you going to take good care of me tonight, Daddy?”
“Sherlock!” John yells after him, and he sounds angry. Sherlock doesn’t care. In fact, he welcomes it. Angry sex has all sorts of delightful potential.
“Fucking rude,” Starr huffs, clutching her nose, which had just become well-acquainted with John's chest at a particularly painful angle.
. Their proximity had been...new. They’d never, in the many years they’ve been friends, been so intimately close, and all at once it’d become clear John had been starving for it. That day at 221b, he had felt a powerful pull for them to be even closer yet, dangerous, stray thoughts threatening to become action, but had reasoned and decided, quite judiciously, that the point had been to learn how to ballroom dance for his damn wedding to Mary, and unequivocally
Sherlock can’t quite picture himself as a husband to anyone, let alone to John. And the image of him as a father: that's even murkier.
They tuck themselves back into their pants, pull up their trousers, and collapse onto the grimy ground, legs outstretched, John’s left pressed against Sherlock’s right. John takes Sherlock’s hand and holds it tight.
John barks out a laugh. “Greg, he's great, but he's not you. You were never an alternative, Sherlock. The connection thing I mentioned--I’ve always felt that with you. Since the day we met. I really,
That self-imposed, self-involved isolation had made him forget about the very few people who’d actually
, for god’s sake, Janine!” he grits out, then opens his eyes to find a very confused Lestrade. Sherlock flaps a hand at the door and rolls his eyes. “Ignore her. She’s drunk.”
John gives him a withering look. “Okay. Earlier: when we had our tongues down each other’s throats. In public.”
John looks attractively rumpled and soft beneath him, his eyes glimmering with meaning and truth unquelled, and it is a marvel that Sherlock could be loved this way, by this man. That Sherlock could be loved at all.
Sherlock freezes mid-tea-stir. “Why wouldn’t everything be all right?” he says, robotically continuing to stir his tea.
I was surprised to find Holmes had kept the bottle of Glenkinchie I had given to him in celebration of the conclusion of a minor case some years after we had first met. He had tried the whisky then and liked it well enough, but had not taken a sip of it since that convivial evening. He was glad to offer it to me as we sat by the fire in his Sussex home, and I was happy to accept.
For a majority of the excursion, we walked in silence. I was unnerved by the prospect of what I was about to do, and I hoped Holmes’s keen observation skills had taken the day off. My agitated state caused me to glance at Holmes excessively, my trouser pocket laden with the gold bracelet (wrapped in cloth to prevent Holmes’s suspicion), fearing his judgment and ridicule for my prospective overture. By no means was Holmes a man of society; he was a Bohemian through and through and did not worship at the altar of the institution of marriage. But I had reasoned, in the many days leading up to that especial one, that my grand statement coupled with our certain brand of partnership, was, if nothing else, in some  defiance of the very institution.
John giggles, and Sherlock can feel the vibrations in his nose, mouth, in everything pressed up against John. He kisses John’s pulsating carotid artery, presses a kiss to John’s jaw, angles his head and dips down so that their mouths--warm breath with a sweet scent of alcohol intermingling--hover a hair’s breadth apart.
“You know our father cherishes that sorry excuse for an automobile,” Mycroft continues, unflapped. “Mummy will have your head when she finds out what you’ve done.”
Sherlock watches a button pop open on the man’s wrinkled button-down, exposing a triangle of undershirt. The woman pats the man’s potbelly, laughing.
But it’d been said, and all Sherlock can do is wait and see how John takes it. And prepare for the worst.
John had had Sherlock on his hands and knees last night, it’d been erratic and rough, and they had both come far too quickly.
Greg gives him a crooked smile. “Hate to sound like a sappy fuckin’ arsehole, but I’ll only enjoy it if you’re there, you know?”
“Yes,” Sherlock says, feeling blindly on the counter until his pinky comes into contact with the opener. “She taught me how to play.”
John huffs out an uncomfortable laugh, but feels a surge of affection for the man. “Christ, well, what the hell can I say to that?”
“Mycroft Holmes,” Mummy reprimands with the authority of a drill sergeant, turning Mycroft into a cowed rabbit. “You know better than to raise your voice to me.”
Nearly a year into my new living arrangement, Holmes had lost significant mobility in his hands and fell into general malaise and fatigue most mornings. The RA was triumphing.
“Could be better,” John says with forced brightness, and Sherlock admires the seamless shift of tone. He marches toward Sherlock, and for a wild moment Sherlock thinks he will throw a punch, but instead John’s hand snakes into his inner coat pocket and withdraws a pack of cigarettes. John raises them up for all to see, rattles them for emphasis. “I was just having a go at Sherlock for trying to sneak a fag.”
--Sherlock’s mouth floods with saliva and his lips slide over John with slickened ease. When he pulls off with a wet pop, stringy saliva tethers to John’s cock from his mouth, and he swallows it back up, pressing a kiss to the head before tonguing the side, then underside of John’s shaft, tracing a bulging vein with the tip of his tongue on the way up, all while fondling John’s bollocks between his index finger and thumb.
Later in the evening, Rosie is showered with gifts then put to bed in the cot they’d installed in John’s old bedroom, leaving the adults to their own devices.
John’s gaze is wavering between his hand on Sherlock’s chest and Sherlock’s eyes and Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock is flitting his eyes over John’s face, trying to understand how they could have possibly ended up here, wishing to penetrate John’s very grey matter.
“Oh, yeah?” John says, nostrils flaring, hand curling into a fist on the bed. “Would this ‘good authority’ be someone who works for Scotland Yard? Who attended my daughter’s second birthday party? Who was supposed to be my fucking
“Actually, I want to talk about something else first.” John tips his head at the bandage. “That? It should be a wake-up call. You need to be more careful.”
, one hand braced on the wall by John's head as he thrusts up into John’s hand, and then John is grunting and coming.
John digs out an olive and pops it into his mouth, sitting back and grinning with wry amusement. Sherlock can’t help but think about how immeasurably attractive he is when he smiles.
The year was Nineteen Hundred and Four, six unhappy months after my wife’s funeral, and I was suffering from a miserable trifecta of emotions: loneliness, heartache, and grief.
“It’s...nice to meet you too, Mr Holmes,” Hafiz says carefully, drawing back his hand the moment Sherlock loosens his grip.
with his eyes, but somehow John has already been bewitched by Mummy, has his chin resting on his fist and a dreamy smile on his face.
“I’m trying to find this funny,” John says. “Because it should be, shouldn’t it? If this had happened to anyone else, it’d be a laugh.”
“Someone swap with the boss so we can do this proper,” Wiggins says, looking directly at Molly, who blinks back, oblivious.
"Ah, yes." Holmes held out a hand, began ticking off his fingers. My eyes were drawn to his long, elegant appendages immediately. "The military."
Sherlock is hard, has been hard since he’d woken up, and now that John’s awake, something can be done about it. Seeking friction, Sherlock moves his hips in a small thrusting motion, cock sliding against the cleft of John’s arse.
“Irrespective of any...situation,” Mummy continues delicately, if transparently, “in which you would have ended up, John, I knew Sherlock would have you by his side. But I simply couldn’t have dreamt of this
John sucks air between his teeth. “It’s unavoidable, I’m afraid. They say you need to kiss a tonne of frogs before you find your prince.”
Despite the frowsty atmosphere of the pub and his perpetual state of exhaustion that certain people have felt the need to point out as a visible marker on his face, John is enjoying himself. For one, it’s a blissful reprieve from Rosie duty, for both him and Mary. And two--John gets to see Sherlock in a purely social context, which is a rarity these days. As he listens to Sherlock expatiate on the tragic love triangle involving the two women and a man sitting at the booth across from theirs, he becomes very aware of how much he’s missed the madman. Every so often, when Sherlock pauses for a breath, Mary peppers Sherlock with questions and challenges his reasoning (to no avail), while John keeps mum, sitting back and allowing Sherlock to perform his magnificence unimpeded. Because it's what John does; it’s what John likes to do.
fucking pissed--one night and, well. He, um. Asked me if I’d want to--if I’d be game for a bit of--for a bit of fun, I guess. A one-off thing. And we
“John,” she interjects, tone clipped. “You keep telling me the same thing; I know you want to believe it, but we both know it’s not the truth. You don’t want this,” she gestures at the ring-box, indirectly indicating the life they’d built together; the life that had rebuilt John from the shattered remains of the man he’d been. “You don’t want
“Yes, it’s very similar to the Scandinavian tradition,” Dad pipes up excitedly. “For them, standing under mistletoe was the place for a truce--whether you were a soldier or a spouse. Kissing was, of course, the spouse’s means of reconciliation.”
Everyone is waiting to see what Mycroft will do, but he still hasn’t moved, looks as if the entire world has conspired against him. “He is seven years younger than me; surely, the formality is that those who are of a more advanced age--”
John sucks Sherlock down with slow, undulating mouthfuls, kisses and laves his tongue over his frenulum, reducing Sherlock to an unintelligible noise-emitting, squirming thing. It is all done with such expert finesse that Sherlock can’t help but conclude in a strangled kind of way, “You
John looks at him, blinking off the blur he'd inflicted upon himself with the eye-squeezing, then smiles softly. “But we've gone off topic a bit."
“How fortuitous. My car has arrived early,” Mycroft drawls, gathering up his laptop and luggage before gliding to the front door. “My assistant will be in touch regarding the deed. Expect to hear from her in the next two days.” Mycroft opens the door and pauses, peering meditatively into the dead of the night. “Many happy returns, brother mine." A dramatic pause. "And I suppose they may very well be happy.”
When John finishes his circuit, his eyes drop to the hypnotic waves Sherlock’s making with his hips, tilted at counterpoint to his torso.
John isn’t looking at him, gazing unblinkingly out at the stretch of suburban solitude. “And if you were to tell me to sod off, right now, which you probably should do, I’ll be glad you at least gave me a chance.”
“Sherlock,” I said, voice gritty with need. The wait to kiss him had reached its breaking point. “Might I--”
“Uh,” John says. “Sorry, I’ll just--move a bit….” He slides himself to the right until the gap is lessened--or, rather,
Holmes slipped the finger shallowly into his mouth, his lips enclosing it, and hummed consideringly. He removed the finger and drawled, “I rather wish that could be bottled.”
supping up the view in front of him. John wants to take Sherlock by his waist and bring them flush together, wants to feel angles and hard length, wants to run his hands over his broad chest, wants to bury his face in Sherlock's crevices, lick saltiness off skin, breathe in nothing but his heady scent. Sherlock notices John's renewed efforts, maybe even reads John's thoughts, and turns so that they are face to face again, his eyes latching onto John’s groin. The old trousers that John’s wearing are one size too tight these days, and they’ve clearly exposed his desire. But John finds that he very much doesn’t mind.
He bows his head, lowers his voice, and Sherlock strains to hear, can only catch snippets: “...regret...hard feelings...something, back then...nothing...you...”
John relents without a fight (Sherlock notes smugly) and sets to pushing the passenger seat forward while Sherlock shucks off his trousers and pants, hitting his elbow hard on the door handle in the process, and crowds back against the door, spreading his legs, right foot planted on the seat and left foot on the floor.
He rubs his cheek against John’s like a cat. John dips Sherlock's head down and presses a kiss into his curls.
“We are absolutely not shagging in the back of your father’s car,” John says, but he is a bit out of breath and his pupils are blown wide, so Sherlock thinks the gentleman doth protest too much.
At the impact, they tumble back onto the sand, Sherlock landing heavily atop John. John wraps arms around Sherlock and holds him, secure.
“Armchair,” Holmes said, unusually taciturn, standing up without any grace and offering a hand to me. I took his hand and he hoisted me up, immediately set to removing my trousers and drawers while Holmes removed his own.
Beggars can’t be choosers, Sherlock supposes. At the very least, John’s still in his life, which is something that almost hadn’t been a certainty just a year ago. And they’ve come so very far since.
When John sits back, he looks down at the wilted leaf and twirls the stem between his fingers with a pensive expression. “Didn’t suit you, really.”
A clever mystery can do it, usually. And John can do it, sometimes. But Rosie, she can always, unfailingly, do it. It only takes Rosie being Rosie, Rosie being boring, or interesting, for Sherlock to smile like a complete idiot.
“Jesus,” John punches out, reeling backwards but maintaining his foothold, catching Sherlock by the arm.
Sherlock removes his arm, uncrosses his legs, and stands up swiftly, feeling intolerably awkward and bared. “Apologies, I took your seat.”
And when he musters the courage to turn his head, John isn’t even looking at him, is boring a stare into Mémé’s headstone with his jaw set tight. It strikes a perplexing note of discord, John’s tense comportment against their gently clasped hands but, then again, John is naturally, exceptionally perplexing.
“Sure is,” is John’s sardonic reply. When Sherlock looks up, John’s concerned face floods his view. He reaches out for Sherlock’s battered forehead. “You all right?”
“Who that?” Rosie stage whispers to Sherlock, though she sounds far away, too invested in watching a ball being sucked into a water vortex to really care about John’s mysterious companion.
?” As John’s about to turn his head and look, Rosie begins trampling over a perfectly manicured flower bed, making Godzilla-like noises to create a fully immersive experience. “Oi! Off the flowers, miss!” Rosie doesn’t listen, mutinously continues to destroy the flower-town. “
loved her, he would have made the effort to see her, to speak to her more often. But as he’d grown older, he’d convinced himself that the best way not to get hurt--the best way to funnel the most energy into what he'd thought really mattered, the Work--was to move through life alone.
to do what Sherlock is about to propose, but John has been game for other forms of affection today, so why not try one more?
Holmes sat upright immediately, regarded me with amusement. "I don't believe you ever succeeding in learning it."
If he were to, it’d only catalyse the inevitable: horrified, John would hasten to run off with Rosie into the arms of a faceless girlfriend, a wife. And while Sherlock had seen John and Rosie often in the past year, John has only just moved back into 221b, and Sherlock would like to have him there for as long as practicable.
John runs an exploratory hand up Sherlock’s body, tracing over the hill of his arse, the dip of his back, raking fingers through Sherlock’s mussed hair.
“As astoundingly unobservant as ever; I can’t but appreciate your commitment to consistency, Lestrade,” he says brashly, sounding more like himself. “Now, tell me about the case. And don’t be boring.”
John’s hand slides up Sherlock’s neck this time, cups Sherlock’s cheek as they kiss, small movements of lips that rapidly become wide-mouthed and desperate. John flings a part of the blanket over their heads, which isn’t quite putting them under the cover of privacy, makes what they’re doing even more obvious (and hotter, in the literal sense [and perhaps the metaphorical sense]), even if the particulars are obscured. Soon, there are tiny whining noises, tongues against tongues, and Sherlock is sucking John’s bottom lip into his mouth--
But then John drops a lit match to all of Sherlock’s paper-thin conclusions, setting them aflame with the words, “It’s kind of the point.”
Unfathomably, John does not seem as adamant about kickstarting the fucking as Sherlock does--though, Sherlock supposes
wish. I don’t know if it’s yours. I mean, I didn’t, really, before. But then, earlier, in the kitchen, I thought--I’m wondering now if it might be yours too.” John slides a hand into his pocket, drawing Sherlock’s eyes to the movement, and withdraws the mistletoe. He turns it over and over in his hand, smiles down at it ruefully. “I wish I didn’t need an excuse to kiss you.”
John says pointedly, and Sherlock deflates a little. “And we don’t need a plan. Just go on as you are. Your parents won’t expect us to do anything to prove ourselves. That’d be...weird.”
Later, when the woman finally leaves them be, they settle back onto the bench, John propping Rosie onto his lap.
Sherlock turns his head toward John with a grin, verdigris eyes sparkling, pale skin ghostly, limned by moonlight.
Janine leans in, all conspiratorial tones. Her breath reeks of alcohol. “Am I stepping on any toes, then?”
“There’ve been men in my life who I’ve felt--who I’ve connected with. On another level, I guess. I knew it was different. But we never dated because I didn’t want other people to know that I was bisexual. Took me awhile to even admit it to myself. Bit weird saying it aloud now, to be honest. And after that night with Greg and up until I met Mary--I, yeah, I just wanted to be with men. And I was, I did, I mean. It was just--just sex. There have always been times in my life when I just wanted to be with men. It’s how I’ve always felt." John hasn't looked Sherlock in the eye once, had told all of this to the floor. "Sorry, that all came out a bit. Muddled." John pinches his eyes with a thumb and index finger and presses down. “God, I’ve never told that to anyone.”
Sherlock knows, on an intellectual level, that his rancour is misdirected. It’s a fairly rational assumption for this woman, and even the rags, to believe Sherlock and John are a couple. They are living together, and Sherlock is someone valued enough in John’s life to have responsibility for John’s child, to mind her even in the quotidian: picking her up from daycare, taking her to the park or to a restaurant, etcetera. But he can’t help himself; these well-meaning strangers keep dangling the painful untruth of his and John’s relationship under Sherlock’s nose.
Sherlock’s expression must betray him, because John leans over to kiss him with confidence, lifts his face, their noses a hair's-breadth apart, and looks directly into Sherlock’s eyes. “Her parents.”
John's always known it, but he'd often dismissed it as background noise. But now, it's unavoidable. It's too loud. And it shouldn't be like this. It wasn't supposed to be like this. It's not what John had planned for his life's trajectory. And it isn't as if John doesn't love Mary; he certainly does. She's perfect. She’s his rock. She deserves the world.
There’s no telling how long the kiss lasts, but when they pull apart, John turns his head, breathless, and finds their heckler gone.
John blinks at him, hand still poised in the air.  “Is this about earlier? I’m sorry, I’ll admit I was a bit arsey. Janine didn’t deserve that. But, in my defence, you
They hadn’t answered his question, and he doesn’t know what to make of their two-man act, is adrift at sea. So it's unsurprising when he makes up an excuse, says his goodbye, and disappears into the depths of the museum.
On a whim one day after I had seen my last patient, I told my charming secretary Janie to notify my patients that I was to be away for the next day or two. I also requested that she forward the address of the practice of my colleague, the intelligent and more than capable Dr. Pendergast, in case a patient had a dire emergency.
The receptionist has her head bowed over a filing cabinet drawer, finger skimming the tops of folders, tongue between her teeth in concentration, when Sherlock glides up to the front desk.
John’s running as fast as he legs can propel him, pulse loud in his ears, ball in hand, tryline in sight.
"Mm." Sherlock sits up and rolls off the bed onto his feet with acrobatic panache. "Dangerous," he says with a wink, twirling around toward the closet. John watches Sherlock's bare arse as he bends over to rifle through a box for his treasure.
Mrs Hudson tuts as she affixes a red nose to the bison skull. “Oh, hush, you. Don’t you want the flat to look nice for the party?”
“Yeah. Reckon he does go in for that sort of thing after all, eh? Boyfriends.” Greg says, tone dripping with
Sherlock huffs and jumps off the bed onto his feet. "Keep it in the bag. I'd rather be ready to leave at a moment's notice.”
“Oh. Well. Yes, of course, I suppose--I suppose I shall,” I said, prattling like a fool. I was not to pay any mind to Holmes’s queer behaviour. It was simply Holmes being Holmes, I reasoned to myself, his idiosyncrasies heightened by drink. “Did you know it was also believed that what you were doing on midnight would reflect what you’d be doing for the rest of the year?”
Starr O’Harra, former escort, has been targeting wealthy, lonely men no younger than 50, plying them with alcohol and rohypnol and robbing them blind. The chemical cocktail is concocted with such scientific precision that Starr’s victims remember nothing come morning; their only souvenir is an eye-poppingly high credit card bill that includes purchases of top-shelf liquor (purchased from, what Sherlock had discovered, restaurants that don’t exist) and designer clothes.
Holmes and I spent our eighth and most memorable Hogmanay together in that dismal and whirlwind year, 1888. I remember the day vividly, even after all these years: the uncharacteristic quiet of London, repellent to revellers because of a biting and bitter cold, the delicious burn of whiskey down my throat, the licking warmth of the fireplace and, what remains most colourful in my mind’s eye, a young and wiry Holmes.
“Slow,” Sherlock repeats, dripping with derision. “Yes, perhaps we should wait another year, just to round off the decade?”
Sherlock looks very satisfied. “An unorthodox medium for communication, to be sure, but the message was received.”
These days, Sherlock’s childhood bedroom has taken on a dual purpose, serving as Mummy’s office and a guest room.
I was immensely moved by his speech, and felt an overpowering urge to be closer to him. I inched close enough until our knees were touching and took Holmes’s hand and held it in mine.
Holmes and London--Holmes and 221b--were like warp and weft, so intertwined. How could he possibly leave?
Certain it is safe to do so, Sherlock turns around and finds John marching purposefully toward him and Rosie, fury palpable. “Let’s go,” he growls, clomping on past them and out of the garden.
When they pull apart, John melts back into his seat, a wisp of a smile on his face. Sherlock has rarely seen him like this, without any trace of his usual sharp edges. It makes him look younger.
“My mother was a highly superstitious woman,” I told Holmes. “She felt it necessary to practice many of the traditions, especially the first-footing. Do you know of it?”
After a few more languorous laps, John changes tack and pistons his tongue in and out of Sherlock until he’s breathing heavily through his nose like a bull. Pre-come pearls and trickles down the side of Sherlock’s rigid cock, and he is completely at John’s whim, writhing, bowing, clenching himself around John’s slick, wild,
“Suppose I’d be offended if you weren’t,” John says, the most cheery he’s sounded since Hafiz’s appearance. “It’s all out there, isn’t it?”
Sherlock glances at his wristwatch, which reads 19:50. “The shops” close in ten minutes. Sherlock judiciously does not point this out.
I thenceforth locked up my practice, returned home, packed a singular luggage bag with basic travel necessities and retreated to the countryside to see the only person I knew could pull me back safely from the brink of desolation—Holmes.
Sherlock had noticed, of course, that John had taken to exercising in his bedroom, a steady bang bang bang permeating through the floor and rattling the glassware like clockwork. He’d been spare-looking when he’d moved back into 221b four months ago, hadn’t been himself, but a year of grieving had wrung the life out of him. But now--there is a notable transformation. Sherlock had been monitoring the progress
A few days ago, Sherlock had conducted burn tests on various articles of clothing for the purpose of learning more about fibre classification. John hadn’t appreciated the smell, particularly from the acrylic fibre (bit fishy, that one).
After planting a kiss on John’s kneecap, Sherlock resettles between John's legs on his haunches and presses a prim kiss to the head of John’s cock, lips in a moue, before sucking him down.
Mummy levels Mycroft with a dastardly look. “It’s Sherlock’s birthday. He is not lifting a finger today.”
Months after I was situated in the homey Sussex Downs cottage, I asked Holmes with not insignificant trepidation if he would accompany me for a walk. He agreed easily enough, and we set off into the mild, cloudless June afternoon.
The moment John’s hands lock around Sherlock’s neck (teeming pulse), John is hauled none too gently to his feet, his shoulders nearly dislocated, and manhandled out of the restaurant.
The finger dips lower, stops at John’s waistband. Sherlock looks up at John from beneath his lashes. “You wanted her.”
Moments later, in a boneless haze, John fumbles with incredible incoordination for the lube in the sidetable, and Sherlock gets on all fours and presents his arse for John’s taking.
Sherlock had not heard Mummy’s approach, but she has perfected the art of creeping up on him unawares; one of the very few people to succeed in such an endeavour. Her face and eyes are swollen pink, but she is, quite paradoxically, smiling, and dare Sherlock think it, but there’s simply no more picturesque way to describe it--she has a
That was the first time I felt the love so viscerally that it threatened to claw its way out of the recesses of my body and make itself known to all.
“Yeah!” Wiggins agrees spiritedly, clearly hoping to get in Molly’s good graces, but Molly doesn’t notice the attempt.
Sherlock’s finger slides across the notches of John’s leather belt. “You were attracted to her to the degree of distraction.“
“If I were someone who had grand ideas about fate, I would say that perhaps all of it was ‘meant to lead us here.’”
But she’d have to be, wouldn’t she, if she’d wanted to be successful at her chosen criminal enterprise.
“You want to wear the frog hat?” John says, digging in his duffel bag for the monstrosity Mrs Hudson had bought Rosie the other week.
Mycroft eyes Sherlock warily. “Then again, perhaps we should leave the cake for Sherlock alone. He could stand to gain some weight, lest he disappear.”
John takes the sketches and gives them all a cursory glance before placing them aside. “She seemed like an incredible woman. So much talent.”
--doesn’t look at a mate like that. Sherlock knows what he’s doing (not ballroom dancing, indeed), and he is taking advantage of their relative privacy in the anonymity of a crowd to express this to John, to tell him something without words, loud and clear.
Being in closer proximity, Sherlock can more effectively scan the woman from head to toe, and he reads her story in her brittle hair and fingernails, in her sallow skin and cheap clothes:
These days, he and John are closer than they have ever been, their friendship fortified by years of tragedy and strife. Bloodied, but unbowed. Sherlock will take what they have, cherish it, and never let it go, no matter if it never becomes
John grins wickedly, then picks up their duffel bag. “Shall we unpack or just pull stuff out of the bag?” Sherlock gives John an incisive sweep-over. “
Rosie outstretches her arm toward Sherlock, a cakey, saliva-sheened finger pointing at him. “Sher wants?”
. I kissed you because I thought, maybe, that you might want me too. But I know it’s not--it may not be what you want, it may not be what you really do, relationships, and I respect that. I can learn to live with you being Rosie’s parent and us--remaining as is. But I need you to know that, this?” He waves a hand between them. “It’s all I need. You. Rosie. I’m here for good. And if you don’t want--”
John nods sagely, as if he’d deduced the very same facts about the woman. “And I suspect she doesn’t get out much. She was starving for conversation.” John gingerly pushes back the fringe from Rosie’s forehead while Rosie pokes her fingers in John’s breast pocket to see what treasures lie within. “To be honest, I probably would’ve ended up like her.”
John realises he probably looks like a tit just standing around and gawking, so he starts to move, eyes straying from Sherlock to skitter over the crowd twisting rapturously around them. He and Sherlock are not standing close, per say, could fit two people back-to-back between them, but it’s clear to anyone watching that they’re two men dancing with each other--or, more precisely, two middle-aged men dancing together to a song that begs to be twerked to at a central London pub, aggressively blokey in the way most local pubs are.
When Mummy and Mrs Hudson run into each other on their ways to and from the kitchen, Sherlock winces preemptively.
Janine peers into the kitchen where Lestrade’s leaning against a counter, engaged in a deep discussion with Molly.
A flurry of activity bursts around Sherlock--the overloud crunch of gift wrappings and trappings being balled up for disposal and the hum of excited natterings over new gifts--so he enters the cosy room he’s built in his Mind Palace in honour of John to dissect the card in peace.
He takes them down side streets and country roads, unable to stop stealing glances at John along the way.
And so John manfully follows Greg back into the humid, loud pub, and tries to enjoy the rest of the night. For Greg’s sake.
I entered the messy sitting room, familiar paraphernalia from 221b and papers with Holmes’s inelegant scrawl strewn across the floor and furniture. He considered a few papers on the settee before, queerly, raising his foot and kicking them away, imploring I take a seat, then asked if I desired tea, which I responded to in the affirmative. I sat down, placed my luggage aside feeling, finally, at peace.
With a sharp intake of breath, John’s hands gravitate to Sherlock’s bony hips, his fingernails digging into cloth. John’s cock has swollen to full hardness, is painfully stiff, and he pushes his hips forward as Sherlock grinds back into him in a delicious figure-eight.
We drank and conversed and laughed into the wee morning hours until unfinished tea had gone cold and all the whisky was drained from the old bottle. I was more at ease than I had been in a long while. I knew Grief would not disappear in that one evening but in the weeks to come, Grief would rapidly release his grip on me, leaving me to look back upon love lost fondly instead of miserably.
My hands fell to Holmes’s waist, bony, protruding from his skin, I kissed him again and I pulled him--warm, lanky and undeniably masculine--close. Holmes did not respond to my kiss, I noticed a moment too late, absorbed in the kiss, and I extracted myself, my heart thudding nervously against my chest.
Holmes’s eyes glittered dancingly in the firelight. “In my experience, fair-haired men bring anything but bad luck. Quite the contrary.”
“Yeah. You changed my life.” John keeps his eyes trained on Rosie as he speaks. “I’ve never been a lucky man--god, not in the least--but, somehow, I was allowed this. Somehow, I was allowed Rosie. And you.”
She raises Rosie off her lap and passes her over to Mrs Hudson so she can freely accept the drink. Rosie lets out a squeal of indignant protest at being womanhandled, but quickly restores an alliance with Mrs Hudson when Mrs Hudson boops her nose.
And, if anything, Sherlock has the perfect cover. He’ll tell John it was all for the sake of their lie. John is the one who’d insisted they attempt this farce, after all. He will understand.
John lets out a sob or perhaps a laugh but who gives a toss, really, because he's kissing Sherlock again. And again, breathlessly. The kisses are unparalleled and positively heart-bursting. But they are also eloquent.
Her abrasive personality and cold demeanour had left much to be desired. But Sherlock had loved her, and she had loved him, in her own way. Or, at the very least, she’d been tickled by him: constantly amused, always encouraging of his scientific (and morbid) pursuits. She had understood him, and he had understood her. And while she’d been an artist, and he a scientist, there had been a symbiosis of minds.
“Speaking of,” John says when they pull apart, smiling beatifically. “Shower, first--then let’s get our daughter.”
a stand-in, if you will. And I am immensely gratified to have been allowed such a role, but I am all too aware that you will soon find a mother for Watson. Or--,” it pains Sherlock to add, “a...father.”
look exhausted. Their recent case (referred to, egregiously, as the "Bermondsay Bijoux Bafflement" by John) had involved quite a few early morning stake-outs, and they're both still catching up on sleep.
“What?” John snaps, stabbing at his laptop keys with an angry flourish and finally looking at Sherlock.
John carefully begins to move his hips, nudging directly at Sherlock’s prostate; Sherlock’s mouth drops open and his eyes flicker closed. “That feels--” he breaks off, lets out a moan instead.
“As always, John, you aren’t thinking ahead. Do you expect us to pretend to be,” he nearly chokes on the word, “
John starts to edge away, but Dad keeps their hands clasped. “There’s much to celebrate today.” John stares down at his detained hand. “I can’t tell you how chuffed I was when Vi told me the news about you and Sherlock.”
Sherlock fumbles for the car keys and opens the door, throws his coat onto the seat, flicks the dial on the heater, and unlocks the rest of the car so he can climb into the backseat. He’s just unlaced his shoes and thrown them aside when John flings open the door and clambers onto the seat beside him, snarling like a feral dog.
“Now I know,” John says slowly. He drops his eyes to the floor, lets out a little laugh. “That’s us, then.”
John waits until Mycroft’s out of sight to turn to Sherlock and say, “Probably a long shot, but is anything open at this hour? Anything you want to do, it’ll be my treat.”
. All her stuff, all the memories. Most aren’t...good. Obviously. So. I mean, I’m also bored out of my fucking skull." He sighs the sigh of a world-weary man. "Again, maybe not fair to Rosie, yeah, she’s already got playmates in the neighbourhood, and bringing up a child in Chelmsford makes more sense, I guess, than London. More space, families, whatever. But I can’t do it anymore.” He looks Sherlock in the eye. “I want to start over. And, besides, Rosie’s...family is here. So. I hope you’d take pity on me and allow me back in. Rosie and I, I mean. If you’d have us, that is.”
John cocks his hip onto a balustrade, watching Rosie talk animatedly to herself as she collects dead flowers and blades of grass strewn across the ground and fashions them into a sad-looking bouquet. “So I’m not average, then?”
“You know I’m always going to want you,” John says. It is imperative that Sherlock understands this. “I've wanted you for so long that I don't remember how it feels to not want you. And, yeah, I’m a thoughtless, randy bastard, and I’m sorry for it--but I need you to know that I will only ever want you.” He brings Sherlock's hand to his lips, kisses his knuckles. “That I’ll only ever love you.”
After a good thirty seconds, she plucks out a folder triumphantly and raises her head, takes Sherlock in with dawning astonishment. “Oh my god.”
People are speaking, but he hasn’t the faintest idea of or concern with what they’re saying, because what Sherlock had learned in the past twenty minutes is gobsmacking information to take in and digest; it rather requires his full attention.
“I suppose if we were to choose just one of the many cultural interpretations of mistletoe,” Mycroft begins, a blessed interruption of the charged silence that’d fallen, “the most apropos one for the good doctor and myself would be the Roman interpretation, which is that of peace. Enemies of war met and reconciled under mistletoe. Though, I am rather certain that this reconciliation was not accomplished with a…,” he wrinkles his nose in disgust, vomits more than says the word, “kiss.”
Splayed on the floor, Sherlock, looking oddly contrite and small and nothing like the Sherlock John had once known, holds out a placating hand. “Let me explain.”
Afterwards, we remained still for a few moments, our foreheads together, our chests rising and falling in tandem. He climbed off me to retrieve wet cloths to clean our soiled selves.
It’s largely cleaned out of Sherlock’s curios, but a few select ones remain: a statuette of Edmond Locard, a taxidermied dog’s paw, and various entry-level forensics and art of detection books, the likes of which include
, you feel so good,” John says rapturously, and Sherlock rolls half onto his back and twists around to kiss him sloppily, panting into John’s mouth as John fucks him with slow, undulating thrusts.
Mrs Hudson waves a hand in the air. “You two. You’re….” she chokes off, pressing her fingertips to her lips, her eyes welling with tears.
“Truly,” Hafiz says with a note of sadness. He pushes his son to the forefront. “But, yes! This is my son, Danny. Danny, say hello to John; John and Daddy went to school together.”
They probably won’t have to “prove themselves,” which Sherlock assumes would involve some degree of physical intimacy. Over the years, anyone from strangers to close associates had mistaken him and John for a couple, and they hadn’t even been
“One must keep one’s spirits up by pouring the spirits down,” Holmes had quipped in his mystifying way of knowing precisely what I was thinking without me saying a word aloud. My mind had indeed often been wending to the tribulations of the year and back to the present. Holmes was too right; it had been a year that merited a peaty descent (or any flavour of descent) into numbing oblivion.
Holmes brought our clasped hands close to his heart, looked up at me and said, with unvarnished sincerity, “Watson, you count for everything.”
He knows John has no preference with the women he dates, in terms of appearance--he has no apparent "type"--and their personalities run the gamut (though, they're universally boring, with the exception of Mary).
John opens, closes, opens his mouth, but not a peep comes out. His expression then transmutes into wary disbelief. “Okay. You’re having me on.”
With a sharpshooter's focus, John slides and locks his arms beneath Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s shoulders as John continues to pound into him with abandon, and Sherlock bites down at his bottom lip to stop from crying out again--his body is screaming for him to come, so he wraps his hand around his cock, and with John grunting filthily in his ear, white-hot pleasure roils in Sherlock’s core and coils upward through his body and disperses, making him flush, scorching him from head to toe, his mind going static-quiet, and then Sherlock is coming with a dizzying, thunderous intensity, John following shortly thereafter.
“And so, it would behoove you to keep in mind,” Mycroft continues smoothly, “that if a former soldier were to be shipped off to such a facility, no one would ask any questions. It would be--”
With no small amount of fear, Sherlock wonders if something all too revealing had slipped through a fracture in his stony mask.
Sherlock half-heartedly smudges the window-come, wipes it on his already soiled shirt, his movements languid. “I can help.”
“It will be exponentially more insufferable with Mummy acting like a mourner from Greek myth,” Sherlock says in an undignified tone of desperation, hoping for John to take pity on him. “Also, Mycroft will be there.”
John has his fingers fisted in Sherlock’s curls and is tugging, ever so slightly, as he makes all sorts of wonderful strangled noises and says Sherlock’s name like velvet and it’s this simplicity--hearing his name from John’s lips, woven with need, encouragement, pleasure--that is most exhilarating. Sherlock blurs his hand over his own cock, continuing to lavish John with his tongue, lapping up a pearl of pre-come, bitterness exploding in his mouth--
John finally looks at Sherlock, and any trace of amusement is gone. Unreadable. “Are we meant to do something about it?”
,” Sherlock says breathily, sliding down the door so his hips are higher. All at once, he has no other word in his typically vast vocabulary, repeats, “
The back of his eyes prickling with welled emotion, Sherlock kisses John, speaks his heart against John’s lips, “You made me realise I was capable of falling in love.”
Once they’re fully dressed and everything looks marginally more presentable, they settle into the front seats.
Mummy and Dad bid Sherlock, John, and Mycroft good night, Mummy pressing kisses to Sherlock and Mycroft’s unwilling, upturned cheeks, and wringing the life out of John with a hug. Dad gives everyone a wave and a smile.
He finds a closed shop and collapses against its graffitied roller-shutter, aluminium echoing with the impact.
“No,” John agrees, tipping his head back against the seat, looking straight ahead with a faint smile. “No, it wasn’t. When it was good, it was incredible.”
“Then allow me to clarify: I would not be able to abide in a world in which you do not exist. Why would you think you are anything but necessary?”
Sherlock stops talking mid-sentence and turns to look at John from the kitchen. He’d been explaining pipette best practices to a very attentive Rosie. “Did you need--”
“Aw, man.” Wiggins looks at Sherlock with the faintest quirk of an eyebrow, almost mute encouragement. Sherlock blinks, surprised by Wiggins’s sudden generosity of spirit. “Guess that’s me out.”
himself to be attracted to Sherlock. If the events of the past decade had taught him anything, they had shown him, in a torturous and roundabout way, what he wanted all along: Sherlock. In friendship, in work, and, well...in life. And if the events of the past several decades had taught him anything, it’s that he’s always had a simmering attraction to and affection for close male friends, but he’d never nursed them, never let them bloom, always cut them off at the root. But now he’s giving these feelings room to grow, and it’s freeing. And now those feelings are unlike anything he's ever experienced.
Greg's form of dance expression involves shadowboxing and bobbing his head like a chicken, so John has to press a fist to his mouth and look away to hide his grin. He catches Mary’s eye as he does, and she has her teeth digging into her lower lip, also practicing restraint. But Greg is going full steam ahead, looks a bit like a malfunctioning robot, now, so John loses it and bursts out laughing.
Sherlock looks expectantly at Lestrade, wide-eyed and nearly bouncing on his toes. Lestrade glances over cagily at Janine. “Uh, never mind.”
“Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!” Rosie is saying, and John wonders how long she's been saying it. Sherlock stops kissing him, and John, numb with delight, turns his head and finds Rosie sitting cross-legged beside them. “Sherlock’s not a frog!”
“You’re intolerably slow,” he said as I helped him out of his shirt with teasing calm. He slapped my hand away and attended to disrobing himself, his rushed desperation causing me to smile, and tore the shirt off to reveal an expanse of alabaster with prominent bone and sinew. I wonderingly ran my hands up his torso, which was sparse of hair, and when I paused to fondle his nipples with my thumbs, he made the prettiest noise.
John snorts. "Could never, for the bloody life of me, tell if it was what you wanted too, and I didn’t want to take a chance to find out.”
blindspot. Because of sentiment. Because of protective mechanisms he’d bolted in place twenty years ago.
Rosie is beside herself at the idea, throws herself off Sherlock to skip in a circle, chanting, “Pizza! Pizza!”
“I wanted to ask--and take as much time as you need to think about it, yeah? My lease is up next month, and Chelmsford is. Well. Not London. I know I’m here a lot anyway. And I know we have cases. I just don’t--” John looks down at the floor, in the space between them, his brows furrowed. “I don’t want to be reminded of Mary anymore.” He looks up, attention fixed on something over Sherlock’s shoulder. “I know it sounds horrible. I know I should want to preserve her memory for Rosie. But it’s driving me round the twist to just
“I hadn’t spoken to Mémé in years,” Sherlock says, more to himself, lifting his head and looking unseeingly at Mycroft. “Why would she give this to me?”
Later, John stands in water that meets his mid-calf, basking in the sea breeze and watching Sherlock wrestle his way back to shore. The waves are mighty foes. When Sherlock manages to get to thigh-height water, he trips as a wave spins him around and onto his arse, skidding him backwards through the muck of wet sand.
John tries not to think about anything outside of the moment. He needs to bloody well focus on allowing Sherlock to get the wallet.
John snorts and makes to hoist Rosie up and place her aside but Sherlock blurts, “I’ll get it,” then
, “Though, of course, we wish we could’ve seen you twice under happier circumstances.” Leaning back, he takes Sherlock in. “Forty years old--my god.” A squeeze of Sherlock’s shoulder. “Where has the time gone?”
But Starr had slipped on her last victim. The man had remembered the night--albeit in snippets, but enough to get a good idea of the full picture. He’d got to talking with a mate who’d had something similar happen to him just a week prior; the mate had, at first, explained the night away, chalking it up to overdrinking and a night well spent with (what he’d assumed was) a beautiful woman. A worthwhile expense, in his eyes.
They sit side by side on the loveseat as Mummy and Dad go back and forth about some inanity or other; Sherlock can’t be bothered to listen because he can feel John’s eyes on him, and it is distracting. Nor can he look at John because, if he does, he will want to (now now
John blinks, hard, his vision bleary, but through the blear, he sees that Sherlock is wild-eyed and unmoored--but just for a moment. There is a shift. His expression softens. Lips stretch faintly upwards. Eyes turn bright.
“Mm, lovely. Hopefully there wasn't a ‘you’re a fucking moron’ squeezed in there,” John says blithely. “I’m guessing your grandmum taught you.”
Somewhere along this good-bye tour, I found myself in Hatton Garden, that area of London reputed for its jewelry shops. As I strolled before glass windows with glinting, opulent wares on display, I did not expect my mood to turn dark. It was twice before that I journeyed to that very place to purchase marriage-rings for my wives, who have long since passed from this earthly plane. Their premature deaths were uncommonly cruel, their abundances of kindness and beauty great losses to the world, and an outsider would not hesitate to categorise me as an unlucky man; a habitual widower.
“I mean, Jesus, roll the bloody tapes. I’m not proud of some of my past behaviour when it comes to you and our--whatever
“So it's a cheat day?” Not Mary says as she glides into the sitting room, eyeing Sherlock up, then targeting in on John with the cake.
lyrics. John has always admired Sherlock’s confidence in every aspect of life, but also envies him for it--the freedom of being himself, no holds barred.
Once John closes the door to the bedroom, he drops the duffel bag onto the floor and scrubs a hand down his face. “Your parents are--they’re lovely, of course, but also...a lot.”
Sherlock undoes the latch and opens the lid. Placed in the centre velvet compartment is a postcard, and it becomes clear that John had deliberately chosen a jewelry box as the vessel for the true gift to throw off Sherlock’s deductions.
“There is a facility in Wiltshire that used to conduct highly dangerous experiments involving the aforementioned agents, amongst other things,” Mycroft says coolly. “The facility has quite a history--it’s been around for almost a century now. The nerve agent trials went on up until the late ‘80s. Military volunteers were recruited to participate in these trials; fatalities were not uncommon.”
Holmes’s hand left my prick and he climbed off me with great alacrity. I was so attracted and enraptured by the shift of his buttocks as he retreated to his bedroom, and then by his engorged member slapping obscenely against his stomach as he made a hasty return to me. He had acquired pomade, which he slathered generously onto my prick, then applied some inside himself. I opened my legs wide as he turned around and positioned himself betwixt my thighs, lined my cockhead with his opening. I placed my hands on each protruding hip bone to help guide him as he very slowly sank down onto me.
Sherlock is back to imagining greener pastures, such as his flesh sloughing off bone in that acid bath.
Holmes smiled and stroked my face with delicate care, his thumb brushing over my bottom lip. “Then we shall, without question, be married.”
Mummy laughs. “I suppose if he were to listen to anyone, it’d be you, John. My opinion never seems to matter. But who am I? Just his
Mrs Hudson chooses to coo like a dove, this time, and Lestrade pitches in a resounding “here, here!”
To Holmes, it was the year that birthed the mother of all failures: the Irene Adler affair. Holmes wasn’t accustomed to being bested, proud man that he is, and it smarted. Not long thereafter were the grotesque Whitechapel murders, still very fresh in our minds that day, the fifth victim murdered a month prior and a sixth possible victim killed just a week before. The killer, until this day, remains unknown. Holmes claims Scotland Yard bungled the evidence to the point of no return, called him in too late for a consultation, but was self-abasing for many years for his inability to track down the deranged “Jack the Ripper.” (I never put the case to paper for the sake of Holmes’s ego [it was also unsatisfying for everyone involved to leave readers with an unfinished case]. In any event, my account would have been but a mere drop in the bucket, since nearly every paper and rag chronicled the case in prodigious detail.)
For these reasons, on that especial Hogmanay, Holmes and I tried our best not to reflect upon the past year.
“My apologies,” I murmured as I continued into the sitting room and sat in Holmes’s armchair. Holmes opened his eyes, and placed the pipe aside, flinching nearly imperceptibly. This little display was but one instance in a deluge of instances where Holmes appeared to be in pain (evidenced that day when he picked up the kettle, prodded at the fire with a poker, removed a book from a bookshelf). No matter how many times I had insisted to aid Holmes in these tasks, Holmes had rejected my offers. I could not allow Holmes to deteriorate.
He returns to the surface with a gasping breath, mouth flooded with brackish water, which he wells up with saliva and spits out. Waves sweep him up, and he rides them back to shore.
on violin for the thinned-out crowd, some of whom are maudlin with drink, and when Sherlock trills the last note, his audience breaks into gentle applause.
“I know. But I felt like such a shit person for even thinking about it. And I thought about it all the time.” He laughs, a sad sound. “I swear, Mary died thinking I was a bloody saint.”
“There were just such beautiful women at Cambridge,” Mummy says. “I couldn’t stop thinking about them.”
“If your Dad didn’t feel motivated to murder me before,” John murmurs as he rubs at a stain on the seat with paper towel, “I think I’ve just given him good enough fodder.”
Sherlock flops onto the bed, flings an arm across his face. They’ve not even been here 15 minutes and Sherlock’s parents have reduced him to feeling like a Victorian woman who’d taken too much laudanum. “Welcome to the past 40 years of my life.”
Preening, Sherlock grabs John's wrist as he sits back in his chair. "What'll you do about it?" He draws John's index finger slowly into his mouth--humid warmth--lashes fluttering downwards to watch his work in progress. John licks his lips as he watches the lewd display and his cock twitches, feeling a bit left out. Sherlock draws the finger out and looks up at John darkly. "Any ideas?"
He pulls apart Sherlock’s arsecheeks and dives in, flattening his tongue over Sherlock’s arsehole in one luxurious wet stripe.
John kneels at Sherlock’s feet, pours out more sun cream, and glides it over the backs of Sherlock’s calves, up to his thighs. Near the hem of Sherlock’s trunks, John brushes thumbs down the sides of his inner thighs, into the sweaty vee of his legs, and Sherlock spreads his legs the slightest bit wider, accommodating.
Mummy steps outside, hugging herself, and looks between Sherlock and John accusingly. “Everything okay out here? I heard shouting.”
“Yeah,” John says, leaning back on the bed with his elbows, spreading his legs into a V. “I’m not sure why we’re wasting any more time.”
It’s a sweltering Saturday in July, so nearly every family in existence have decided to while away the dog-day hours in the cool indoors of the Science Museum.
.  It’s a little junk science-y, sure, but it’s fun, semi-believable factoid! As to the rest, men ages 35-44 (John’s supposed age bracket) do account for 16% of convicted murderers in England and Wales, per the latest Office for National Statistics
“Good god,” I said in awe as I became fully sheathed within Holmes. I marveled at our union, him stretched around me, the long expanse of his lithe body above me.
And he’s still holding John’s card; it’d softened with his sweat and bent with his grip. Best say something about that. "Thank you.”
His pulse drumming in his ears, Sherlock pulls his hand away, scraping against the stone. Because he cannot, in good conscience, allow John’s reputation to suffer. “You don’t want to do that.”
“Hey!” rings out a booming man’s voice at the end of the alleyway. It’s the opposite end of the alleyway, this time.
Sherlock cottons on to her meaning, a lump in his throat. “You are mistaken about the nature of my relationship with Dr Watson. We are colleagues and friends; nothing more.”
Sherlock slumps miserably in his seat, though he knows John’s right. Bigotry is a charmless staple of the pub and, by extension, the town.
Their chests rise and fall against each other in one entwined breath, and Sherlock wishes it were possible to burrow into John’s skin, his bones, his cells.
When John had been grieving Mary, Sherlock had hugged him—just the once. It’d be a rare moment of physical connection for them, and Sherlock had felt guilty for finding comfort in it himself. For finding security and warmth, and for wanting to keep John in his arms.
He looks down at John’s hand on his thigh and feathers a finger over John’s knuckles, back and forth.
He stands up, straightens out his shirt, shifts his weight from foot to foot. The physical embodiment of discomfiture. This frank conversation--it's not the kind they usually have. John will want to flee, to be alone. He will fixate on the conversation, coming to the conclusion that he regrets revealing his truth.
Before I could even think to restrain myself, the elation spurred by that joyous moment overcame me. I surged forward and planted an impassioned kiss upon Holmes's lips.
“Don’t oversell it, now,” John says, amused, placing the pint gently back onto the tabletop and sliding his hand out from beneath Sherlock’s. “So. Was this your spot then, back in the day? Down the pub with the lads? Bit of football hooliganism?”
Holmes said nothing for a moment then, in a whirlwind of annoyance, turned sharply, bounded past me and flopped dramatically into his armchair.
,” John chides, exasperatedly prying the plate from Rosie’s hands and placing it aside as she begins to cry. “Christ, I’m sorry.” John throws Jenna? an apologetic look over his shoulder. “Sorry.” He props up Rosie against a fortress of pillows and gets at eye level with her, points at the mess on Jana’s? dress. “Now, that wasn’t very nice. Say you’re sorry to Jamila.”
Sherlock traces his eyes over the curve of John’s bicep, his short shirtsleeve hugging the muscle, straining against the fabric.
“That was merely a consequence of ‘keeping you around;’ a consequence I never anticipated, I’ll admit.” John looks stricken, and Sherlock blathers (unhelpfully) on, “And my self-restraint has weakened over the years; I suppose I am susceptible to human urges on occasion. I can assure you it won’t happen again.”
“I do not seek crime, Watson. Somehow, it finds me. Even in the remotest of places…” Holmes noted wistfully.
“And what? Be more like you?” Sherlock snipes. “I pity the women unlucky enough to have you foisted upon them. How none of them have died of boredom mid-coitus is beyond me.”
The day before Christmas Eve, Sherlock returns home late from Barts to find that Mrs Hudson has indeed stopped by, though the only decoration she’s added to the already-bursting sitting room is a sprig of mistletoe in the entranceway to the kitchen.
I knew Holmes sought solace in the violin. In the first year of our friendship, Holmes had trouble baring his emotions to me. When he could not express himself properly as Holmes, the man, he would do so as Holmes, the musician. If I could not read Holmes, I could read him by the tone of the piece he had chosen to play.
Months later, after we had gone for an evening ramble along the coast, we entered the sitting room and Holmes stopped dead in his tracks. I followed Holmes's line of vision to see that  he was staring at a pile of books lying harum-scarum in a corner of the room, dusty and long unused.
“Watson, stop lurking in the shadows like some common prig scoping out his victim,” Holmes interrupted my musings, his eyes remaining shut, smirking around the pipe’s mouthpiece.
a hardship, because Starr looks like a relic of John's youth, like she'd stepped out of the '90s, kitted out in low-cut halter top and short-shorts with a glimpse of g-string. And, more distractingly, she is dancing up on John in very,
John’s barbed mood softens significantly when they get to Hampstead Heath, though it’s impossible not to be mollified by the majesty of the Pergola, a veritable maze of verdant greenery that winds around trellises and archways and stone pillars.
He carefully picks up his head and peers over his shoulder to find John fast asleep on his back, arms hugging his stomach, trying to take up as little space as possible.
I took Holmes’s hand and padlocked the bracelet onto his wrist, as if he were then and there bound to me, then pressed a kiss to the palm of his hand.
You may have twigged it, but the grandmother plotline was inspired by canon--Watson and Holmes get into a discussion about genetics (a topic that was en vogue during the Victorian era), and Watson says something along the lines of “you must be the way you are because you worked hard at it, no?” and Holmes responds that, yes, that’s true, but with his grandmother being the sister of a great French artist, he also believes that “art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.” It’s one of my favorite canon quotes, and I wanted to explore it just a tiny bit. I...also wanted them to have sex in a car. So. Win-win.
John could kiss Sherlock and tell him without words everything he wants to say. What he's always wanted to say; what he had planned to say on this holiday.
My eyes opened. We had lost track of time, so absorbed in each other were we. I kissed the top of Holmes’s sweaty head. “Happy New Year, my dearest.”
Vacillating for a moment, John decides to slide into the booth on Sherlock’s side, reaching out to pull his pint in from the edge of the table. Foam sloshes over the side of his glass and John laps it up, Sherlock’s eyes drawn to the pink tip of his tongue--and then the stretch of his neck as he takes a generous pull of the beer.
John nods. “Grandparents on my dad’s side. But that’s the extent of my Gaelic: anything drink-related.”
“Sorry!” she says, stumbling over to the counter and sparing a glance at his ID. “Sorry, yes, I actually--I know who you are.’” She offers him a nervous smile. “Dr Watson knows we’re all fans of his blog. And he talks about you quite a bit.”
Sherlock raises cool, inquisitive eyebrows, contradictory to the stirrings of internal tumult that John’s unspoken words inspire.
“Wasn’t it just so?” Sherlock chirps sardonically, and he hears Janine snigger beside him. Jamila’s sweet expression falls.
They all lapse into silence, but Mrs Hudson does not take the cue that the conversation is over. In fact, Sherlock is horrified to see that she looks to be on the verge of tears.
“No, not--obviously I meant,” John gestures vaguely at the house, “I meant doing things circuitously. Realising we want to jump each other’s bones whilst pretending to be people who jump each others’ bones on the regular.”
John is being pushed and pulled by the tide like a ragdoll, but he likes the fight. He always likes a fight.
Sherlock continues to not move, the pinioned rather than the pinionee for a change, uncertain of how to act or what to say. Or, in all honesty, uncertain of how to breathe. He is not a stranger to attention nor does he cower from it, but John’s is a foreign breed.
“You need not convince me,” I said playfully. I placed my hand at the nape of Holmes’s neck, and we kissed, our lips moving in tandem, wet and hot, my heart fluttering.
“Ah, no,” he said immediately in a brusque tone, indicating to me that there was certainly something amiss. Holmes filled the kettle with water, hung it in the fireplace then sat delicately in the armchair across from me, staring at the crackling fire.
John watches, riveted, as Sherlock leaves a ring of lipstick around his shaft, as he bobs his head, cheeks hollowing, and groans indulgently, a vibration that travels down to John’s curling toes. Colour continues to bleed off his lips onto John’s cock.
Rosie catapults herself off the bed onto the floor, landing on all fours, and hops, the two French braids that Sherlock had so deftly fashioned for her--and which John may not have been able to replicate even at gunpoint--flying in the air.
John runs a finger over Sherlock’s bottom lip with great self-satisfaction; thanks to their enthusiastic activities, the lipstick had rubbed off almost entirely.
John takes this in blankly for a moment, and Sherlock thinks he’s got him, hook, line, and sinker, but then John huffs out a laugh and says, “God, you really are a master bullshitter.”
John slides a hand up Sherlock’s flat stomach to his hard chest, slides his fingers sideways underneath the opening of Sherlock's shirt, splaying his finger's against hot, slick-sweaty skin.
Sherlock thinks bitterly, listening to John continue his stream of invectives from the bathroom. “Boys?”
Some uncertain amount of time passes, and John blinks awake and turns his head, meeting Sherlock’s undiverted stare.
“Oh, no--no, not at all, John,” Hafiz replies with overcompensating gusto, at a more than decent volume. “It’s water under the bridge. I know you had a rough go of it. Can’t imagine how hard it must’ve been to still not be out at 29.”
John slides a hand leisurely over Sherlock's hip and down the cleft of his arse to sink a finger inside him, draw out, and paint a streak of come across the swell of his arsecheek.
It’d been too different from his previously focussed, sharp state of mind. It'd blunted the edges of pure chains of reasoning and thought. In a way, the only logical explanation for his altered headspace was, in fact, the encroachment of this very real and all-consuming sentiment.
As we walked, I tried to ignore Holmes’s newfound keen interest in me and my doings. I knew I could not prolong the inevitable any longer, otherwise Holmes would expose me, somehow. We happened upon a secluded wood, colourful and fragrant with scarlet pimpernel, heartsease, violets, and primrose and so quiet that I could hear Holmes’s intakes of breath. It felt as if it were millions of miles away from the thrumming city, as if Holmes and I were the first human souls to set foot on that ground.
” John is saying at a booming volume, causing Mrs Hudson to slap a dramatic hand to her chest, so John dials it down, continues more soberly, “Sorry. I’m--sorry. Thank you. Again. For watching Rosie last minute. I can stop by in the morning to pick her up?”
Holmes’s elegant and slender hands were no more. I recalled Garrod’s 'Treatise' which I read in the mid-nineties on the subject of what Holmes’s affliction appeared to be. His fingers were enlarged, there was slight radial deflection of the terminal phalanges, and his knuckles were large and nodular. The diagnosis was undeniable.
“‘Course. ‘Course,” Lestrade says, flashing a winsome smile and thumping John on the shoulder as he passes him into the hall.
Sherlock watches the next moment in slowed-down, dreamy time: John lowering his eyes to Sherlock's lips, turning his head, leaning in. The gentle press of John's lips against his. Sherlock's heart is pounding with mad abandon, surely John can hear it--it’s what John does to him; makes him feel too alive.
“Sherlock,” John says, and it is a poor excuse for a reproach, so Sherlock frees the belt fully from its loops, slides down the zip after a couple of failed attempts, and shoves his hand into John’s pants to wrap around his cock: hard as a rod, silky, and hot.
When John raises his eyes, the look on Sherlock’s face is Sherlockian scrutiny, but of a different kind.
John sidesteps between Sherlock and Wiggins, back turned to Sherlock, and Sherlock’s eyes drop down and up in a flash, possibly stealing a look at part of John’s body that is enticingly pert in his jeans, possibly not.
“You were never in,” John says, his eyes sliding sideways to Sherlock, a ghost of a smile on his lips.
have known. He obfuscated, but I still should have known. I wasn’t myself, yet. And I didn’t make that mistake again.”
“...When he was home for summer one year, I found him shirtless on the roof. Said it was for an experiment, isn’t it
Sherlock eagerly skates the palm of his hand over the tent in John’s jeans, which causes John to inhale sharply and wriggle a bit in his seat. John has his eyes trained ahead, trying valiantly to keep his naturally expressive face at bay as he grows firm beneath Sherlock’s curious caresses, but when Sherlock bunches up a handful of John’s cock and gives it a squeeze, John falters.
John takes a few steps toward the bed and stutters to a halt, darting his eyes from the bed to Sherlock, as if waiting for permission. Sherlock wriggles to the right, a go-ahead signal, and places a pillow against the wall at arm’s length. John climbs onto the bed beside him, situated against the pillow...and they’re left with an embarrassing, yawning chasm between them. It’s too far for John to see the sketches.
Lestrade decides he can’t bear the anticipation and lumbers over to get a look. He reels back and gives a low whistle, then leans back over Sherlock’s shoulder and squints at the postcard. “
The honesty is not only refreshing, but emboldening, so Sherlock pulls the car into the deserted road’s shoulder, kills the engine, and turns to face John.
Holmes sighed in a pained way that suggested obliging me was the most difficult thing he would ever have to endure. He pulled off the gloves, flinging them aside carelessly, and held his hands out, head turned resolutely away from me.
Making little bitten-off noises, Sherlock lifts and spreads his legs wide in the air, throws his neck back, submits himself. “Oh,
Once they’re out of an earshot, John glances at his mobile and purses his lips in disappointment. “It’s only half 9.”
John blinks through a blur, his eyes watery with tears, and he wipes the back of his hand over them roughly, angrily. While, earlier, the alcohol had cocooned him like a plush blanket, he’s now tumbled from the rose-coloured high into a black nothingness.
John glances around the room, looking perplexed. “Where’s my daughter gone? Who left this human-sized frog in my room?”
Wishing you all a happy, healthy (emphasis on the healthy) summer (or winter, if you’re in the Southern Hemisphere) and a Happy Pride Month (for those of us here in the States)! And thanks very much for reading. I've been so heartened to find that people are enjoying what I'm putting out there these days.
“Mrs Hudson, I don’t think it’s possible for this room to be any more festive than it already is. I think there’s a quota on that sort of thing.”
“Oh, hell,” John says after the fourth peck. “What time is it?” He sits up, wipes his hand on his chest. “We’ve got to get Rosie; Mrs H will think I’ve forgotten I have a daughter.”
The words had been whispered into Sherlock’s hair, quiet and muffled. Too delicate and handspun to be loud.
In the final days of my residency in London, that liminal period between my old and new life, I endeavoured to visit landmarks and districts of which I was fond. Although I could, of course, return to the sombre metropolis whenever I so chose, I did not foresee making the effort all too often. Holmes’s sudden move could not have been more opportune; I was getting long in the tooth, had grown weary of crowds and noise, and found I was very amenable to the pastoral solitude of the South Downs.
Once outside in the sharp winter air, they take one look at each other and double over with laughter.
John punches the blanket off them, unsuctions himself from Sherlock, and rolls away in one swift motion, leaving Sherlock bereft. Catatonic.
I closed a shaky hand around the jewelry in my pocket and withdrew it, holding it aloft to glitter underneath the slivers of sunlight that filtered through the tall trees.
song, which exists more than a century away from the music John associates with him. With John's wife.
The gesture is so innocuous, but at the same time so very heavy; it could be a question, an accusation, or even a proposition. But John won't allow himself to think about it.
They’ve been avoiding the subject quite assiduously, which is something they are both very skilled at--avoiding talking about things they do not want to talk about--but Sherlock has been able to do nothing else but think about it since Mémé’s funeral. There are experiments that need doing, a monograph that needs writing, so he must clear the air (and his mind).
John follows after him, shutting the door, then takes a few steps forward, stops, eyes unfocussed on something in the beyond. He looks at Sherlock with ferocious intensity for a beat, then begins to pace like a caged animal, hands balled into fists at his sides.
"Oh, sorry." With John's other hand, he picks up the flannel again, gestures at Sherlock's arse with it. "Did you want to--or I can...?"
They’re in a very good place, currently. How could they possibly revert back to the here and now if Sherlock doesn’t want him
“It’s far from rubbish, John. As we all know, extramarital affairs are a common motivating factor for uxoricides--the philandering husband, frustrated with his life, and his wife, may murder her and try to start anew. Typically, a philanderer will lose an average of 3 kilos and/or ‘bulk up’ in order to impress his paramour. By monitoring your progress, I now have a reference for how long an affair could have potentially been taking place based on muscle accumulation in males of your age bracket, a demographic which accounts for 16% of convicted murderers in the U.K.”
“Ooh yeah. Loads more, mate. Did he not tell you? Figured you just couldn’t make it, what with the little one and all.”
Sherlock makes a noise of acknowledgement in the back of his throat, doesn’t raise his eyes from his mobile.
They’ve been on three dates, John and Jamila; this is the fourth. There’s not been very much physical affection instigated by John, from what Sherlock’s observed. Since Mary’s death, John has gone through girlfriends like his life depended on it. Sherlock would be hard pressed to remember them by face or name. The fourth date seems to be the one in which John abandons his prospect. Sherlock sees this one going down the very same path.
