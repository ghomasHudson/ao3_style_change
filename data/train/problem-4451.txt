Ellen turned away, and Cas followed. But at the very last moment, almost like he couldn’t help himself, his eyes locked onto Dean’s. For that split moment, their eyes held between them, and Dean couldn’t stop his small, hopeful smile. And then, almost of its own volition it seemed, Cas’s face lit a bright red, and Dean felt his heart swell.
“Not really that important,” he explained. Right then, the waitress returned with their drinks, drawing everyone’s attention. It was just enough for Dean to act.
To have hope renewed like that, only for it to be torn away once again…Hannah had walked down the aisle the next day, her expression somber under her veil, and Castiel had forced a smile even as his heart ripped further in two.
“As his mate, your connection to him grants you power.” Hannah smiled. “He needs you now, more than ever before. Your presence will give him the help he needs to defeat them.”
“Excellent!” Gabe clapped Dean on the shoulder, tightening his grip for a moment. Dean grimaced but gave no other indication of discomfort as Gabe squeezed the damn feeling out of his shoulder. And then Gabe winked one more time and spun away to return to his booth.
He smiled. “That’s awesome, man! I’ve only talked to Cas a couple times, but he seems really great.”
“Happens all the time,” Lucifer said. He reached over to give Castiel's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “Although I am sorry that you got caught up in the middle there, Castiel. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of him.”
Dean’s head shot up, and he found the dark-haired man with the striking blue eyes standing there...at their table, in this very restaurant.
The way he said it, almost shyly, like he didn't know if he would be allowed even this, tugged at Castiel's heart. Castiel almost reached across to peck him on the cheek, but thought better of it at the last moment. He still wasn't ready for that just yet.
“What’s going on is that I’m finally getting what’s mine,” Gordon seethed. “That asshole thought he could keep me away with a couple empty threats?” He laughed darkly. “No, see, I’m the one who follows through. And look, I’m standing here while he’s down there, dead.”
“It’s in the lab now, so by noon tomorrow we should know everything about him. What kind of shampoo he uses,“ Dean’s eyes landed on the Head and Shoulders behind him.
“My product guarantees a bond with the omega,” he explained as he led them into his study. “Or rather, it guarantees a bonded omega. As the alpha, if you do not wish to bond, you will not bond. This allows for a single alpha to be bonded with as many omegas as he chooses.”
Finally he agreed that moving away was the best way to make that happen. So we’d made the call on the flight home from St. Bart’s: we’d move to Arizona together, get an apartment somewhere near campus, and then someday get married when we were ready. And then he’d spent the rest of the flight staring up at me with those star-struck eyes, the same ones he’d given me on my basement couch way back at our beginning.
How would Dean even find him? And that’s if the man felt inclined to do so… Lucifer had been right: Cas was now just a successful mission to Agent Winchester, nothing more. And even then, there was still Cas’s deal with Lucifer, and through him Crowley. If Cas went back on either of them, especially given their shared history...he was a dead man for sure.
He slowly stumbled up the stairs, not even bothering to apologize as he pushed his way through the crowds. He finally made it to the bathroom, dizzy and disoriented, and stumbled into the last stall. He suddenly felt very...very...
“Dean’s been moping all night,” Sam muttered. “Apparently Cas has been avoiding him since the game on Mon—”
“Well, you’re welcome,” Cas answered woodenly. He held out the basket. “But the food is still unnecessary.”
Castiel offered no further clarification, but Dean had already realized that was his way. The man was a spy, through and through, never sharing more than necessary.
He and Sam settled on the couch, Sam with his Coke and Dean with his cider. He downed a giant gulp just as his breath caught in his throat, making him cough violently.
The tears finally escaped as Cas collapsed against him, burying his face in Dean’s shirt as soft sobs shook his frame. Dean ran gentle hands over his back, toyed with the short hair at his neck, leaned down to nuzzle his temple, until Cas finally pulled back enough to look up at him.
Crowley chuckled. "No more than you're lying to yourself, Darling." He brought his lips down to Castiel's, a kiss that Castiel eagerly returned despite the hollow feeling in his chest.
Castiel kept the phone against his ear long after Uriel had hung up. He couldn’t fail this again. He just couldn’t. He had to get Dean this time, even if it killed him.
So Bela had been the one to spread the rumors about Castiel, and now Dean had fucked her... Shit, Castiel wasn't gonna forgive him for this one easily.
Castiel trudged down the hallway at school on Monday, his head pounding in rhythm with the slam of lockers and the calls of friends. He should've just stayed at Crowley's for the day.
Castiel sent him the thumbs up emoji, and Dean breathed a sigh of relief. He was going to make this better.
. Make sure you don’t let anyone but the best catch you, for his sake.” He gently set it down on the back stoop and shut the door between them.
“Look, the boy’s got himself a guy, I don’t care. But he can’t be endangering…” Bobby began, but Dean waved him off.
Dean and Sam tread carefully through the dark, yelling for Gordon and the others. They’d been walking for five minutes when Sam just stopped.
“You know it’s safe here, right?” Dean assured him, well aware that his own voice had turned condescending. “Nothing’s going to happen to it.”
Their dinner plates had long since been cleared, as had their dessert dish, but here they still sat, hours later. The conversation had flowed easily, naturally. Castiel would be hard pressed to recall a first date that had gone so well, especially given his...peculiar personality.
Yes, but that was Henriksen talking. As Ash had once said, his secrets have secrets. Dean felt the tension tighten his frame as he dropped into one of the empty chairs. “I just hope he’s okay.”
“Yes,” Castiel confirmed. He blushed under Dean’s steady gaze. “We have this charity golf game and supper at the club.”
Dean sighed contentedly as Cas leaned further into him, watching as the sun set behind the mountaintop. He pressed his nose into Cas’s temple even as his fingers played at the mark on his omega’s neck. He glanced behind them, to the dark forest that stretched into the distance. The wall was gone now, and the town was already on the mend.
Cas nodded, and a soft smile tugged at his lips. Dean couldn’t help return the smile as he stole another kiss. When they separated, he rubbed his thumb along Cas’s jaw, reveling in the shiver it evoked.
“You didn’t have to rush back,” I assured Cas as he curled tight against me to make sure the blanket could wrap snug around both of us. “You could’ve stayed at Lillith’s party.”
“I know that was hard for you,” Dean started. Cas didn’t respond, instead shoving past him to the hall.
One time Mr. Singer had asked him what his favorite color was. The dude had said brown. Who the fuck chooses
“I know!” Gabriel agreed. “He just started speaking like nothing had happened. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an omega with that much control.”
“You mock the power of the Council?” Cas seethed. “We’ve locked you away in the deepest vaults of hell before, and we'll do it again.”
Crowley turned his head to stare at his best friend, his eyebrows pulled in concern, but Castiel was fast asleep. It didn't matter what Cassie said; Dean Winchester had to be held accountable for his actions.
Dean felt something dark and painful rising in his throat as he remembered Hannah’s months of lackluster responses and vacant stares. He didn’t know Castiel that well, didn’t even really like him, but the thought of anyone going through that, but worse...it didn’t sit right.
Ana stepped up beside him, her hand gentle as it rested on his forearm. “She is one of our lost sisters.”
“Which is so dumb, right?” Dean admitted with a hoarse laugh. “I mean, I’m barely out of school, you’re still in your senior year. But…” He nuzzled his nose along Cas’s temple. “You’re just...you’re meant for me, and I'm meant for you. I can feel that.”
He shoved the phone back in his pocket, not bothering to wait for Victor’s response. He was already beginning to hate himself as it was, even without Victor’s damning praise and affirmation.
He didn’t let himself overthink it, didn’t let himself worry about what would happen that weekend with Dean and his family, didn’t let himself wonder if this was too much too soon. Instead, he let himself revel in the blankness of his mind, the heaviness of his limbs, the feeling of Dean pressed against him.
Castiel looked at her, his eyes swirling with blue light. “I have more than enough to deal with this
From the doorway, Dean watched in mild amazement as Castiel got all 32 of the children settled into a circle on the floor for something called “the silly game.” Rachel and Hanna, along with whatever volunteers they could wrangle in for the day, they were great. But watching Castiel now, it seemed obvious by comparison alone that the two women didn’t have the childcare experience this omega had.
Castiel shrugged. “It was intimidating to be working with you and your team. I didn’t know if you all would accept me...my help. And I didn’t want to say anything embarrassing.”
Dean spun to finally look at him. “Leaving again. Just like that? Not even going to stick around, maybe help deal with the backlash we’ll get from this mission?
Cas caught Harvelle’s eye and tilted his head toward the door, signaling that he was headed out. Her brows furrowed, and she shook her head. Why the hell was she so adamant about him staying here? Cas just pointed at his watch and mouthed “Plane.” He smiled sadly and shuffled from the room.
Only a few months later, the townspeople stopped seeing Lord Dupuis altogether. It took another several weeks for anyone to go check on the estate, with full expectations of finding him dead in some upstairs bedroom.
Anna agreed to keep Dean a secret from the rest of the family, at least for as long as she could. Because, as she warned him on her way out, “You know that Hester will find out about this. She always does, somehow.”
“Nice pull, by the way,” Dean called after him. “Did you get that little tingle up your spine when you snatched it, that little tug in your gut?” Dean paused. “Or is that none of my business?”
“Castiel?” Dean whispered, his fingers timidly curling into the front of the alpha’s button-up shirt.
He walked slowly, his eyes scanning the shadows, until an arm slipped out of the darkness and tugged him in.
Long minutes ticked by, each excruciating in its uncertainty. Then sudden relief coursed through Cas as he heard the deadbolt turning in the lock; only he and Dean had keys to this room. He jumped up from the bed to greet Dean, but the smile froze on his face. He stumbled back a step at the looming figure that filled the doorway.
She sighed and set down her devotional book, patting the couch cushion beside her. She took a sip of wine as Castiel padded across the living room to flop down onto the couch beside her.
Dean’s thoughts settled again. He’d seen for himself that the bond hadn’t taken on Castiel’s end. He let out a rough laugh. “Those damn prototypes.”
The young man, Castiel’s savior, came to stand next to him. “Are you okay, you don’t look so good...”
“You been harassing omegas?” He shook Gordon roughly. “In my compound! I brought that omega here, promised him safety, and you attacked him?”
He slid from his barstool, instantly on alert. “What? Where are they headed, I can meet them there.” He tried to ignore the fact that he wasn’t asking about Gabe as an agent looking for a connection to Lucifer, but as a man worried about his boyfriend’s cousin.
Dean turned to look at him, trying to gage his reaction to being so unceremoniously thrown into the team, but Castiel’s gaze remained on Hannah as he nodded. “We are connected now, beyond just blood and birth. Of course I will help your friends, yes.”
“Cas…” Dean took a deep breath. “I think we should wait.” At Cas’s wary look, Dean hurried to explain. “I just...I feel like I'm building something with you here, and building things takes time, right?”
Well, Dean couldn’t really blame the girls for falling over Cas like they were, but he could send them a clear message.
I took it slow at first, kissing over every inch of soft skin, opening him up with lubed fingers, dragging him to an orgasm with nothing more than my lips and tongue. After, as he shuddered his way down, I sucked fresh bruises into his inner thigh.
With an internal groan, Castiel wrenched his thoughts away from the alpha’s physique. Not the time or place...
"Well, you've asked me a question, so now it's my turn," Castiel said, using his straw to play with the ice cubes in his drink. "Why's a gorgeous guy like you using a bathroom wall to get dates?"
“Just Dean, Mother!” Castiel called back as he tugged Dean out of the chilly November air into the warm house.
I finally dropped him off close to 7 then drove myself home...only to find Sammy sitting in the living room, his expression uncomfortable.
So I've finally finished the fic. Sorry if it seems rushed or anti-climactic...I'm just proud to have finally finished it! And only 2 years late!! Wow!
“He made it clear, Sammy. He doesn’t want me.” The obvious pain in Dean’s voice cut Castiel to his core.
Dean was waiting, leaning against Baby's bumper. The sunlight made him look like a god. Castiel could stare at him forever. He stopped in front of him and Dean stood up straight.
He didn’t see what was inside the sack until they were safely back within the confines of the labs in the bunker. Castiel, him, and Sam stared through a thick, blast-proof window as a lab technician in a hazmat suit ran a scanner over the machine again and again.
A flush rose on Dean’s cheeks, even as his grin turned suggestive. “And you’ll be judging this for yourself...how?”
When Mr. Thompson paired them up for the lab for that year, Jessica knew it was the universe pushing her toward him. During that first lab with Sam, talking to him, listening to him speak, learning how passionate and smart and kind he was...it was a sealed deal.
Dean looked away, mulling the threat over in his mind. He finally looked back to Henriksen. “You’re probably right,” Dean said. “But since I am such a low-level goon, I just...I don’t know what level officer should have access to this type of information…” he met Victor’s gaze levelly. “So I just sent a copy of it to everyone on up the line.”
So, um... I know I haven't updated this story in almost two years...that's my bad. Between some major health problems and the busyness of work, I haven't had much time, and if I have ever did have time, I just didn't have the energy. I mean, I've even had the plot outline all finished since I started writing the story...so again, my bad.
Minutes later, Dean was turning the car onto Cas’s street. He pulled to a stop across from Cas’s house, and Cas could tell with a glance that his mom and Chuck were both gone. He looked back at Dean, blushing under that heavy green stare.
“You need to talk to him, make nice,” Sam said. He pointed at Dean as he walked down the ramp. “That’s an order.”
man slid from the bed. He was completely bare, apart from a bloody bandage on his ankle. He walked toward Cas, the slightest limp marring his gait.
He wouldn't dare hope that the boy had found his way into the third floor east bathroom yet, the nearly abandoned one that Castiel knew bore his name.
Castiel opened his locker and took out a bottle of aspirin. He took two and swallowed them with the help of vodka hidden in his water bottle. He'd snuck it when Crowley was in the shower.
That little smile should’ve been her clue, though, because somehow she was still shocked when she found out.
Dean's eyes widened as he nodded emphatically. "Of course! I just...I don't want you to feel like you have to, like I expected it. I don't."
Ironically, because it was a duplicate of their own blood, the Winchesters had never undergone the treatment, so Dean held no secondary gender. Before Sam had gone missing, he’d also held no secondary gender, but when he’d returned from his years-long disappearance, he’d been an alpha.
Raphael, who never missed even the most minute detail, paused in his conversation with Charles to call out for Naomi. The older woman bustled in, and Raphael pointed at Ana. “Let’s see if we can’t get a little more color there. She’s supposed to be porcelain, not ghostly.”
“This is the end of your path.” Ana said. Hannah opened her mouth to protest, but the supreme shook her head. “I am going to go in with half my Council. The others will remain here with you. If we fail…”
Castiel stared at him, at the green of his eyes in the dim light of the library. He’d spent years working with different types of people in the military, and one thing he’d learned to spot above all else: the player who hid a winner in his back pocket.
He dropped to his knees and retched into the toilet bowl, tears streaming down his cheeks as the puke burned its way up his throat. He tossed the water bottle aside as he clutched onto the cool, glass bowl for dear life, his stomach offering another heave and then another.
With a nod, Castiel slowly levered himself down into the chair. As soon as his weight had settled and his feet were relieved of their burden, Cas let out a long, happy sigh.
“That’s good,” Cas admitted, somewhat inanely. He tried to ignore the fluttering of his heart when Dean smiled beautifully,
“We gotta get out of here, Sammy,” he crawled towards the answering groan, feeling along for the giant body. When he hands brushed over something warm and wet, he gripped it tight and shook. “Sam!”
"Time for you to go. Naomi and Michael will be back soon," Castiel murmured, slowly sitting up. Crowley sat up as well, stretching lazily.
Brady waited while the bartender returned to set the fresh Old-Fashioned down in front of Dean then moved away again to see to other guests.
Castiel couldn’t seem to find the words again, so Meg explained for him. “There’s been an FBI agent playing house with Cas for months now, damn near crushed his heart to bits, apparently all to get to
Work was, in essence, as busy as ever, but Castiel found that Dean somehow helped create a perfect balance in his hectic life. No matter how stressful a day had been, Dean would always be there at the end of it, with smiles and soft words of encouragement. He’d treat Cas to a night out at some fancy restaurant followed by a show or walk through the park. Or, if Cas wasn’t feeling up to actually being around other people, Dean would cook him dinner instead.
Down in the basement, Dean stood at the back wall—or rather, where the back wall used to be—as Victor explained what had happened just after dinner.
them to look away and never say a fucking word. I had to cultivate that image if I wanted to be successful, or just, you know, avoid a record.
Castiel stared up at the front of the ritzy restaurant, his heart slamming in his chest. Dean came up beside him, wrapped his arm around his waist.
Cas’s cheeks heated as his gaze became inescapably caught by bright green, a color that matched the ribbon around the Castilleja in the basket he held. He could only stare as the beautiful man walked right toward him, the crowd somehow parting easily for his measured steps.
“Don't go lying just to appease his ego,” a deep voice called from behind them, but the tone was teasing. Castiel glanced back to find a tall, tan man with dark hair heading towards the kitchen with Sam following close behind.
He opened the top drawer and plucked his silky red panties from the top of the stack, grinning wickedly as he slid the soft material up his legs and let it settle over his hips. The material stretched over his cock just right.
And then his hand was there, warm and gentle and strong against Castiel’s cheek, tilting his face up, up, up. Castiel followed eagerly, arching up, searching. Their lips met in a chaste kiss, just the barest press of lips. But Castiel knew immediately that he needed more; he’d been craving this, craving Dean, since he’d first laid eyes on him across that crowded restaurant, and now he was finally getting his first taste.
He walked up the familiar staircase of the house that was almost like a second home to him. He paused in front of a solid wood door that hid the room that had become a safe haven to him. The first place that he’d finally felt understood, normal….cared for. He took a deep breath and twisted the knob.
“Cas,” Dean echoed with a soft smile, the name tripping off his tongue. He gestured towards the basket Cas held. “And I see you are receiving my baskets. Why haven’t you—“
The omega scrambled to the furthest corner of the bed and curled in on himself. God, he wished he had something to cover up with.
It was well known around the compound that Dean’s omega had the alpha wrapped around his pinky finger, and soon their young tot mastered the same trick.
He’d guessed that Castiel would be a good link to Lucifer, and snippets in their conversation tonight had verified that. It had only taken a couple gentle nudges for Cas to talk about his uncle who “wasn’t really in the family in the more...” He’d chosen well. Castiel was the perfect mark for this.
Dean smiled warmly and inclined his head toward the bedroom door. “It’s amazing, how well you handle them.”
First there was the appointment with Balthazar so Castiel could appraise a new piece he’d “stumbled upon in that tawdry little neighborhood downtown, you know the one.” After careful examination, Castiel offered an estimate, Balthazar tried (unsuccessfully) to hide his delight, and then it was on to the meeting with Anael.
This only added to the reasons that Castiel should stay away from Dean. He needed to protect this dumbass since this dumbass wouldn't protect himself, but then again... it felt nice to have someone who just...didn't care about his reputation, someone who just cared about him.
... Castiel had only ever seen them in sketches, because they did not grow here. They did not grow anywhere
Cas smiled, but it didn’t seem like a real smile. “I’ll be there in a minute. Just had to, uh… had to get some air.” He turned away, as if expecting that to be the end of it. But it wasn’t, not for Dean.
Why had he ever started letting Victor fuck him? What had he seen in him? Every day the memory of the football player dulled in his memory. He was sure he had long since been forgotten, just another notch in Victor's belt.
“Ah, that’s one of my personal favorites,” Cas murmured. It was a picture of Dean licking at some gelato. “I call it Thief a la Mode.”
. Not when I could talk to someone about that gorgeous guy who’d been exactly what I wanted: sharp and funny and smart out of bed (or in this case, backseat), but so soft and pretty and hungry in it...not that I told her anything about any of that.
Crowley was laying in bed, reading. He looked up when he heard the door open and smiled when he saw Castiel.
They were going to trade with that asshole? But if Cas sent the chip to Dean instead of allowing Luci to use it as a bargaining tool, that meant that Cas had something else in mind for Crowley. His mind flashed back to the conversation he’d listened to in Gabriel’s club… Cas didn’t have something else in mind--he had some
"Anyways," Charlie began, launching back into her story she'd been recounting about the night before, "We defeated the troll, and right as I was about to recite the ancient incantation..."
As before, Winchester walked up to Brady’s window to make the exchange, tossing in a paper bag as Brady handed him the money.
His eyes widened. “Watch out!” he pointed behind Dean, who turned to find two undead soldiers right there. He tried to raise his blade, but they were already on him, reaching for him.
With a shrug, Henriksen settled down onto the bench across from Dean. “I don’t know. His message was short, incredibly cryptic. But it sounds like something to do with secondary genders.”
“I need to find him,” Dean said, uncaring how desperate his voice sounded. “I...we...” He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
Castiel groaned and flung a hand over his eyes. "I don't know! I don't know..." He trailed off. "I, uh... I met someone during lunch, up in the bathroom."
It wasn't long before they fell into a routine. Each morning before school, Dean and Sam would pick up Castiel from his house, and then they would drive together to pick up Crowley from his corner. Despite their initial dislike of each other, Dean and Crowley seemed to have reached some sort of agreement, a pact that held Castiel at the center.
to go…you’re running, and you know it,” Dean accused as he slowly started to climb the stairs toward his detective.
As she sat and listened, he found himself happier than ever that they’d managed to maintain their friendship. He could always count on the alpha to hear him out...and occasionally set him straight. He was even happier that her fiancé was okay with her former kind-of flame dropping in to talk.
“When I was much younger, when I fell in love for the very first time... I can still remember what it felt like, being wrapped up in him so completely. I felt loved, protected. This...” she looked back at the painting, “somehow this is exactly what it felt like.”
Hannah nodded. “And the fact that he had a forest and a field and a mountain here since before you bonded shows how strong he was then. But now, I think that most of his energy goes toward maintaining the wall.”
“Oh, cut it out with all that ma'am stuff,” she chastised, flapping a hand at him as she pulled away. “I feel like we're already old friends. I mean, Dean’s certainly talked about you enough!”
Before he could do anything stupid, like stalk over and kiss Dean until the omega completely forgot about that idiot Ketch—forget about anything and anyone that wasn’t
Meg had told him about the meeting with Dean, but other than that, there’d been no mention nor trace of him.
He peered through the keyhole, and sure enough, New Guy stood there, shifting from foot to foot. Castiel realized that he should probably get the new guy's name; it'd be weird to call him New Guy as they fucked.
"I know. But I want a change. I thought we could go through my closet and get rid of some things and I'd like to get a haircut. I just...I need a change."
“Oh, um...you...you could never be, I mean…” Castiel paused and took a deep breath. “I apologize. You won’t disturb my work, no,” he assured Dean. “Are you sure
Dean turned back toward the village, already forming a plan in his mind, but paused. A lone figure now crossed the plain, walking slowly towards him.
“I never saw him,” he argued. Hannah just stared at him, waiting for him to catch up. That last conversation before the nightmare, Cas had had that look when Dean had talked about never seeing him before...
Sam returned home to marry Eileen, as he’d wanted to all along. John wasn’t happy about it at first, but Dean managed to convince him.
Castiel didn’t know how to explain the truth: it wasn’t a matter of beauty, it was a matter of exposing his heart. His anger, his bitterness—these were evident in his painting, and for those to be put on display for others to see...for his family to see...it was unthinkable.
As the children started to walk toward the table at the far end of the room, Castiel slowly pushed himself to his feet and meandered toward the door. Dean smiled at the way Cas threw one final glance over his shoulder before slipping out into the hall to join the alpha.
Castiel nodded, blushing softly. "I'm giving him another chance. He's taking me to meet his parents tonight."
When the jet landed, Cas all but ran from the ship. Dean watched him go, feeling more idiotic than he had for a long while. He brought a hand to his nose to test the break. What the hell had gotten into him?
“I don’t know who you are, or who you think I am, but I’m not that,” Castiel tried to keep his voice firm. “Your games aren’t interesting.”
I ran a soft hand down his spine, then back up into his hair. He still needed silence, so I pressed my nose into his temple and brushed a soft kiss across his forehead as I felt him shaking with his quiet sobs.
"Yep! Helped Dad rebuild her myself," Dean bragged. Castiel slid into the passenger seat as Dean climbed in on the driver's side.
"I've been worse," Castiel shrugged. "I feel different now, you know? I don't want to be that person anymore."
When they reached the bunker, they headed straight for the lab. Finding no one there, Cassie dragged Dean to the kitchen. Everyone, including Henriksen, sat around the table, drinks in hand. As Dean’s gaze flitted from seat to seat, his stomach dropped. Castiel wasn't there.
"I don't want to have sex," He blurted. "I want to wait, maybe for a long time. I'm not a whore. Not anymore. I want you treat me like I deserve to be treated. I want to meet your parents, go on dates."
Dean couldn’t keep his hands off Cas as they walked up to the front door of the club—only to be ushered right in past the waiting line. He glared at the few guys and girls who spent a couple seconds too long admiring Cas, tightening his hold on Cas’s hand as he followed the others inside. He didn’t let himself wonder too long about when he’d become so possessive over a mark.
"I'm glad." Naomi closed the magazine and stood. She walked over to him and kissed his forehead. "I'm glad you're making friends. I know it's been a hard year."
Castiel pondered what she'd said, but found he couldn't fault her logic. He had been happier since he started seeing Dean, which apparently made him more approachable.
He knew he would though, as his fish store depleted into nothing. But he’d made his decision on that last visit into town, and so he refused to return.
Dean almost growled, but then Rachel’s soft voice was right there behind him. “Is everything okay, Dean?
Perhaps, with Dean so far away, he could finally kill that monstrosity he’d trapped in his own mind. It wouldn’t hurt Dean, because he’d be in a completely different world, in a time and place when that part of him didn’t even exist yet.
,” he said. “I think it is time for you to return home. They will have plenty of tasty fish for you there.”
Not only had Cas preserved his life, but he’d also provided answers to the questions that had plagued Dean’s mind for
Sam stepped forward and offered a handshake. “I’m Prince Samuel Winchester, and this is my brother Dean.”
Dean had never actually had to use a bug on Cas yet, but there was a first for everything. So later, when they were out on the dance floor, grinding together and pressing hungry kisses to cheeks and lips, Dean slipped the little device under the collar of Cas’s blazer with one hand while he pretended to feel him up with the other.
Benny and Dean exchanged dubious glances, but both quickly agreed. Crowley pressed a button on his desk and barked out a command in Russian before smiling back at the men. “Come, let’s go meet him.”
“Let’s go check it out,” he grunted. Benny nodded, imperturbable as ever as he wiped off his machete then fell into step behind Dean.
here, and yet they looked as freshly picked as if they’d bloomed right outside the baker’s front door.
“Good, cause I'm planning on sticking around for a long time,” Dean promised as he leaned in for another kiss.
“That’s it,” Dean soothed. He wasn’t sure why, but he needed Cas to trust him like this, to feel safe in his arms.
“I don’t care how you do things,” Cas retorted. “You haven’t been here for the past months, watching his cruelty toward those girls, experiencing it for yourself…” His hands twisted slowly, and Crowley’s screams grew louder.
he’d gotten from that one guy and the generous donation his dad had made, his Stanford spot was on the line. He couldn’t afford another bad grade, not now.
Finally finished, he once again scooped the cat into his arms and carried it upstairs to his bedroom. Laying it gently on its usual pillow, he stripped and slipped under the covers.
Cas glanced past him to where Benny and a few other guys were gearing up with a variety of firearms and blades.
A hint of night breeze floated in through the open window, ruffling a couple of the papers from their stacks...and affording Cas a gulp of fresh air that cleared his lust-hazed mind.
He thought of the unbearable agony he’d endured in the nightmare. That pain was contained within Cas’s soul, had been for months now.
Cas pulled him back in, this time curving to wrap a leg over Dean’s hip, keeping Dean in place as he met his gaze levelly. “Don’t ever think that,” he whispered. “She left, she chose him.”
He had to know that he could trust the person, had to believe that they were as invested as he was. He had to want them, beyond the passing fancy. And yes, one could argue that he’d well surpassed that point with Dean already. Yet, ever hesitant, he hadn’t moved beyond increasingly familiar touches and hungry kisses.
His thumb froze over the call button. He hesitated. It was late; Victor wouldn’t even be there this late. He didn’t absolutely have to check in right away...
“Most people don’t. It’s always the one or the other, separate and distinct. So few people realize how much of ourselves combines both.”
“Honestly,” Meg shrugged. “I don’t know. He skipped out sometime early this morning, left a note that he’ll be back in six we... actually, you don’t need to know that. He’s no longer your concern.”
Hannah nodded tersely, then looked back at the wall. “It doesn’t matter where the break was last time; he’s mended it.” She turned to Dean. “You’re going to have to break through again.”
He did draw up short when they actually got inside the club itself. From the outside, it had looked like a plain brick building; inside, it was a mass of people shouting and music thrumming. A throng of people mobbed the open dance floor, jumping and grinding and laughing.
He knew they couldn’t help it. Their instincts demanded they care for the pregnant omega, claim it. Castiel hid a shudder.
Saturday, Dean showed up shortly after lunch, his grin huge. “Ready for our study date?” he teased when Castiel opened the door.
“But there’s a difference at being good at something and achieving the impossible,” Castiel countered.
“Yes! Tell him that hiring a male assistant with a sexy accent is so cliche! And tell him not to forget about the other thing!” The other man hung up.
“Of course!” Jess cried. “I couldn’t stand seeing you so sad, not when you’ve been so happy recently.”
He took off down the hall to catch up with Ruby, who’d started walking toward their literature class. He hooked her by the elbow as he caught up.
“Best boyfriend ever,” Dean declared. Cas couldn't help his smile, despite the nagging voice in the back of his head.
"Castiel, you obviously don't remember any of this, but..." She shook her head. "I chased your father away. He was a drinker, drank all the time. Well, not all the time, but just enough that I thought I had to cure him of it. But it didn't work; I just made him run."
“Long enough,” Castiel responded. He took one step forward, then another, while Dean stood stock still, caught in the headlights.
Castiel rolled his eyes. "Fine. A double date. But if she's really a serial killer, I'm not saving you."
All of the figures stalked forward in perfect sync with their monstrous host. Still the council chanted behind Cas, and Dean somehow knew what they were doing: they were offering their power to the new supreme in this fight.
Dean excused himself to the restroom and took off toward the back of the apartment. But instead of going down the hall, he walked through the kitchen, out to the fire escape. The same spot he’d first met Cas, the same spot he’d first felt that fire in his gut and that need in his heart.
Only then did Cas catch sight of the flowers wrapped neatly in M. Winchester's basket. They were red, with spiked petals that grew atop a long, thin stem.
Memory Dean stalked forward, and real Dean braced himself for his next words, flung from a place of hurt and stupidity. “At least I’m not playing up to some stereotype, hiding behind a face that isn’t even my own.”
Dean had guessed that Castiel would be a good link to Lucifer, and snippets in their conversation tonight had verified that. It had only taken a couple gentle nudges for Cas to talk about his uncle who “wasn’t really in the family in the more...”
But here they were, on a quasi date/group activity with Sam and his almost-girlfriend Jess and his best friend Sully. It was the last Saturday in October, the last Saturday the corn maze was open, and Sam had pestered Dean until he agreed to take Sam and the others. Even though he had grumbled about it some, Cas could tell that Dean was enjoying himself.
“To protect my family.” Castiel said this like it should be obvious. “Plus I happen to be a pretty good strategist.”
Dean turned, grabbed Sam by the arms, and shook him gently. “Listen to me. You and Anael, the boredom and disinterest is obviously a mutual thing.” He drew in a deep harsh breath. “With Castiel, that is not the case. It’s just him that doesn’t care.” Another pause. “Do you know how much that will hurt? Can you even fathom what that will feel like for me, a fucking omega?”
Castiel shuffled forward to examine the wall more closely, his eyes squinting, head tilting to the side. Grabbing a pencil from his breast pocket, he began to poke at the wall, carving out a piece of plaster that had obviously been applied very recently. As the plaster broke loose from its mold, a subtle flash scent rose up with it. Cas froze, allowing the scent to invade his senses. His eyes slid shut as the memories began to wash over him.
She clung to his arm as she read the letter over his elbow, then turned to me. “You know, this scholarship means that Sam’s pretty well covered.”
“Dean, you’ve practically got a mate with pup who needs you. I couldn’t have that on my conscience!”
Crowley shook his head. “No, I just happened to be in the right place at the right time. I haven’t told.”
But he knew that even if he did track all of them down, even if he did tell them what he now knew, they probably wouldn't believe him;
Dean pressed his face into the curve of Cas’s neck, trying to hide his own tears in the sweat-damp skin. Cas knew what he was doing, but didn’t call him out for it.
“My grandmother. She lives in the city, about a twenty-minute drive. Benny could drive you over tomorrow.”
Sam frowned, opened his mouth to argue, but Hannah shook her head and pushed on. “Just for now, just until...”
“Seriously?” Sam groaned, his expression conflicted. He stared out over the hallway for a long moment before looking back down. “But I can still despise him though, right?”
“You are the most wonderful man I’ve ever met, Dean Winchester, and I adore you.” Then he grabbed me by the collar and dragged me up into another kiss.
Castiel frowned, ready to ask why they allow such a man to hold a position of power, but Dean must have known where his mind would go, because he was already answering the unspoken question: “No, we haven’t been able to get a finger on him. He has too many people in the line, like Ivan, who can take the fall.”
As usual, the children’s chatter was peppered with random comments and questions that ranged from “I like macaroni the bestest,” to “What if your baby has too many toes?”
“He’s stronger than anybody, even Ana,” Hannah explained as she ran beside him. “But Kazimir…” she paused for breath. “Cas is fighting against an old god
The next morning came far too early as the screech of his alarm pulled Castiel from his dreams. He turned it off and forced himself from his warm bed. He dressed quickly and slipped out the door before his mother or Michael could stop him.
She knocked on the door twice, and Cas pushed off from the wall where he’d been leaning to follow her from the room.
Before she could supply an adequate response, the waiter appeared to set down their plates. The rest of their brunch, as usual, was spent in silence, broken only by the muted clink of silver and crystal.
Dean watched as Castiel formed a blue cloud that carried him upward, rushing toward the dark, crackling cloud.
“Is that all that drives you toward him? Guilt? Duty?” Ana asked. “Because if that’s all you have to offer...it’s better that you stay away.”
"Castiel, calm down. I'm not trying to get your pants. To be friends with benefits you have to be friends, right?"
They worked for the next two hours with Dean studying from the book then taking one of the quizzes. He actually looked impressed when he scored a 75%.
This time, when he looked up at the others, he found Crowley still talking, but Benny was studying the two of them, his expression inscrutable. His gaze slipped to Cas with his face buried in Dean’s neck, his body molded against the bigger man’s perfectly.
Castiel giggled as he leaned up to brush a kiss against Dean's mouth. "I think I may insist on beds with all my conquests from now on, actually."
As if he could hear his rebellious thoughts, Victor added, “Thank you for letting me know. We’re only doing this for your own protection.”
And thank every god out there that we’d been stopped at a light, because I would’ve crashed the damn car with the way my hands jerked. I turned to look at him wide eyed, and he smiled through the blush.
The mother floated forward, laughing shrilly as she threw bolt after bolt at him, precise hits that sent spikes of pain coursing through his body.
The memory was banished as an older woman poked her head from the window to glare down at Cas. “Watch where you’re going, filth!”
“Like I’ve now said multiple times,” Victor replied lowly, “that was for your own good. We had to keep tabs on you after that last mission.”
“He woke up and took off right after you did, man,” Garth answered. “Said he needed some fresh air.”
“No, Gabriel,” he cut in. “I can’t do that again. Remember April? Or Lillith? Or even Eve? It will be the same all over again.”
Cas tried not to let his thoughts show, tried not to give his traitorous mind away, but he could feel his cheeks flushing. Damn Dean Winchester!
At the door, Crowley paused long enough to turn back to Castiel, his expression serious. "Listen, whatever's going on, you'll figure it out. You always do.”
Crowley shrugged. "I know. Best not take any chances." He winked at Cas. "I'll see ya around, Love."
Later that evening, when I was back home, my body somewhat recovered from Cas’s drugging kisses, I realized how dumb I was acting. Like some little girl with her first crush!
Dean shook the offered hand as he replied, “Always good to be back” through a false smile. He wouldn’t break first.
The path was old, given the way it was grown over, and that made it more treacherous than most. More than once Castiel’s foot was caught on a root or his hair was tangled by a branch or his cheek was scraped by a hedge. Eventually though, the path broke open into a clearing, and Castiel gasped.
Castiel was shocked at how straightforward he was about it. Castiel was even more shocked at how little the accusation affected him. Dean hadn't even been that straightforward and it had somehow hurt more. Maybe it was because he'd known Crowley longer?
When the dance with Crowley ended, he excused himself to the balcony, needing some fresh air to clear his mind.
“Here you are,” Cas conceded with a smile before standing. “I’m very tired. I’m going to...” He pointed toward the bedrooms, and Dean nodded.
Brady screeched up to the curb and threw his BMW into park. He leaned forward to peer out the windshield, but even with his wipers going at full, he could only see dim shapes through the downpour.
Helpful as ever, Charlie actually pulled a double-take when she looked up from her phone and saw him.
Castiel smiled a pleased little smile. "People are noticing but...in a good way?" He said it like a question, and Charlie giggled.
“How close do you think they’ll let me get to those cars?” he yelled as he dug through his suitcase. The green t-shirt, that would be good with his brown leather jacket and some jeans, plus it was super soft from all the washes and wears.
“And you don’t?” Sam countered. Dean didn’t argue, couldn’t argue, because whatever he had with Cas, it was more than passing, and even Sam knew it. “You’re my family too, Dean.”
The interaction in the bakery, brief as it may have been, was enough to leave a flustered, unsettled feeling roiling in the pit of Cas’s stomach. He hastened back into the crowd, toward the town square, which would lead him to the trail that—
“Sounds damn fantastic, Sir,” Benny enthused, his voice set in a heavy southern twang. But Dean saw how his fists clenched in his lap, unseen by the man behind the desk.
“Sam took care of it,” Castiel assured him, his tone that same soothing level he used with the children at nap time. “And I haven’t seen him since.”
“You mean you still don’t—” the omega gulped and forced the question out. “You still don’t want me?”
Both were too focused to realize that silence had fallen over the others. They didn’t see the way everyone’s attention had shifted from Sam and Ana to themselves. They didn’t know anything beyond each other for that moment...
“Ew!” Sam suddenly yelled as he walked into the dining room. “Not on the dining room table, guys!” He called out exaggeratedly.
Castiel stared out the private jet’s window, tears streaking from red-rimmed eyes. God, it had all been too perfect, hadn’t it? When he’d stepped from Dean’s side for a quick moment, fully planning to return within minutes, he hadn’t known that it would be the last time he ever stood there beside the handsome man who’d unequivocally stolen his heart--and then crushed it just as thoroughly.
Castiel froze at the low voice right next to his ear. He didn’t recognize it, whoever it was. Instead, he shook his head.
“That was a little painful, yes,” Dean admitted. “But when you began to befriend me as a cat, I knew I still had a chance to be yours.”
And then Cas’s voice was there, surrounding him, coursing through him. He was babbling in a foreign language, yet Dean somehow understood every word.
There, at the back of the deep closet, sat the omega, and curled up on the floor with his head in the omega’s lap, lay the alpha.
"You were the one who texted me, asshole. You were the one who wanted an easy lay. So either shut up and fuck me, or get the hell out."
The next morning, Castiel actually felt optimistic about the day ahead, and he was already looking forward to his time with Dean as he strode through the front doors. He headed straight for his locker, his head held high, his back straight. He'd learned long ago to ignore the snide looks and whispers that seemed to haunt every step he took, both in school and out. He didn't stop to talk to anyone. He was sure that they wouldn't want to talk to him, and even if they did, he didn't have anything to say to them.
“Remember,” he murmured, “it’s just a visit to see if there’s compatibility. Nothing has been decided yet.”
Castiel offered a flat look. “Especially the PBS cartoons. Far too liberal for young, impressionable children! According to them, at least.”
He brought his hand up against Castiel's ass in another light smack, the sound echoing off the ugly green tile walls.  Castiel moaned and stuck his ass out further.
Castiel smiled. "That's good that he has you." He climbed off of Dean's lap with a reluctant sigh. "I did tell Naomi only a couple hours."
Cas flushed but kept his gaze steady on Dean’s so they could read the truth in each other’s eyes. “The few council members who remained gave me her title—the youngest supreme in memory, and the only male ever—but I was trapped in that forest. I couldn’t even try to help. I had to maintain the power flowing into a very uncertain world.” He looked at Dean through his lashes. “When you came to get me and the machine, all I could think about was how you were the one who’d brought my supreme back to me, and through her, my freedom.”
"I know. I just...I mean that this feels like more, you know?" He sighed heavily, glancing away. "I don't know if that even makes sense, but..."
When they finally managed to part long enough to walk back down the boardwalk, hand-in-hand with the setting sun behind them, Castiel couldn’t help but think about how much had changed since just that morning, how whole his heart felt, how different his smile curved. And with Dean at his side, wearing his own grin and full heart, Cas was grateful that it had been a day unlike any other.
Mere days later, Dean stood at yet another grave, this one deep in the quiet of the forest. He kept his arm around Cas as his omega, the new supreme, murmured words to grant Ana her peace.
"Do you not want to?" He asked weakly. Maybe the whole 'fuck you in a proper bed' was really just a way to get out of fucking Castiel altogether.
“It’s all a giant shit show, so I’d actually rather not talk about it, especially with the guy who literally shoved him towards it.” She stood, grabbing her purse. “Have a terrible life,
"It looks like you have a little problem down there, Sir," he teased, reaching back to skim a hand over Dean's erection through his boxers. "Would you care for some assistance?"
Dean stared at him for about two seconds, then burst into laughter. “Oh my god! That paperwork was just some old stuff about land disputes between two families.”
Castiel reached down to rub gentle hands up his torso, nothing more than feather-light touches designed to drive Dean insane. His hands were so soft and and sweet as they traced nonsensical patterns over his abs, his chest, up to his throat and neck; it was so at odds with the rough thrusts of his hips.
“I realized that being a witch, having these powers...it wasn’t nearly enough. I saw ugliness in the world, evil and betrayal. I knew that I couldn’t be like my brothers and sisters, couldn’t simply remain in hiding and hope for the best, or if the evil won out, weather the worst.”
When Brady called me that Friday afternoon and I agreed to meet him in the usual abandoned lot, I had no idea how my life would change. But then I was stepping under that bus stop, soaked from the rain, and everything slowed, because all I could see was
With a sigh he propelled his feet forward. He was already here, might as well finish his shopping. Next time though...next time he wouldn’t come.
"Your brother and I are going to the church to help with the food drive. Do you want to come?" Naomi's clipped voice called through the door.
Dean was in Ottawa when he saw the pictures Sam posted of his paintball battle with Cas and Jo, all of them fake-glaring into the camera. It got a ton of likes on Sam’s Insta, and according to Dean’s social media guy Dick, a spike in searches for
Castiel stripped and plopped down onto his bed, staring up at the ceiling. So he had a...boyfriend now? Is that what Dean was? Or just friend?
He smiled blandly and nodded at the security guard behind the front desk, lifting a hand in greeting to a colleague as he passed. Generic but likable, that was Dean Smith.
But two nights later, Jess was over doing homework with Sam. She was just as smart as him, probably more, so she was taking a senior AP lit class. Ok, yeah, she was way smarter than my genius brother.
Cas sighed heavily as he strode toward the house. “Hopefully the crime scene hasn’t been contaminated yet.”
In fact, he preferred it, this gentle build that allowed him to savor every moment. The weight of Dean on his tongue, the imprint of long fingers on his hips, the slow stretch of being opened so completely. He accumulated beautiful bruises across his collar bone, his chest, the inside of his thighs.
But on the fifth day, a new sound arose, so painful and wrenching that Cas gasped. The cat was crying out in real pain...
Castiel shrugged. "Go for it. I don't care." Which, at the moment, was the absolute truth. He couldn't bring himself to care about anything besides getting that boy's weight on top of him.
I rolled the condom on and lined up, then began pressing in slow. His blue eyes, already so dilated, rolled back in his head.
“Because—and I was about to get to this if you hadn’t interrupted me—I’m on another watch list. Some low-level IRS pencil pusher,” the disparagement dripping from his tone was almost comical, “has tagged me for some drinks I brought in from—actually, it’s not important where from. What is important is that everything I’m importing is being monitored.”
He hadn’t meant to moan when Dean nipped at his neck, and he knew Dean probably hadn’t meant to be so loud with his rough, “You like that, Sweetheart?”
“You were my alpha, for a brief moment, in case you’d forgotten,” Cas turned to whisper over his shoulder. “There’s no telling how your biology might react to seeing me with someone else.”
“Castiel!” he turned to find Anna standing with an elderly lady by the entrance. He headed their way, smiling warmly at the ladies.
Castiel was struggling to come up with a retort, when Dean pushed off the wall and moved in front of him.
“Uh…” she glanced at Sam, who shrugged. “Yeah, he’s in my AP lit class. Really sarcastic, but in a funny way.”
That evening, when the cat came to his door, it had the promised key tied to a string around its neck.
Cas’s eyes flicked up to his, bright blue and angry. “Dean, the next time I see you, I’m arresting you, and Sam and Bobby and anyone else who I know is working with you.”
He waited til he was out in traffic, where the speed and noise would deter any eavesdroppers, before thumbing through his contacts to call Smiley Dental Works.
"So fucking hot!" he scolded, and Castiel gasped as Dean's free hand suddenly swiped up against his ass, the smack ringing in the empty bathroom.
But as he neared his exit, he closed the sunroof, rolled up the windows. The volume went back down, the station changed. By the time he pulled into the parking garage for Sandover Investments, he was mild-mannered Dean Smith once again.
Around the dance floor, several seating areas of varying styles and sizes were already packed full, from couples to large groups. Bars lined the three walls at the back of the room, with multiple bartenders shouting and performing at each one as they poured drinks and flipped bottles back and forth between them. Throughout the room, there were tables with poles attached and dancers prancing around, winking and flirting with the people below them.
Dean scoffed. "Dude, I can communicate just fine." He gestured toward Cas. "I'm communicating with you now."
"What's wrong?" Crowley asked. Castiel shook his head, only able to sob. Crowley sighed and wrapped his arms around him, holding him through the tears. When Castiel finally calmed down, Crowley wiped the tears off of his cheeks.
How silly he’d been, thinking that Dean might have felt something in those brief interactions they’d had at the hotel and in his home. Dean had been playing Cas, just like before, keeping him
“Fuck ‘em,” Dean answered firmly. “I’ve been miserable without you, and I need you back in my life.”
Dean moaned at the pure ecstasy that rushed through him. Castiel’s lips moved in a way that seemed designed to drive him insane with need, but Dean didn’t care. How could he, when his mind went so beautifully blank, quiet for the first time in years? Everything within Dean focused on Castiel, this kiss, this moment.
The bell rang then, forcing their conversation to end, but Castiel wasn't paying attention to the morning announcements. His mind kept replaying her words, and he couldn't quite ignore the logic of them.
"See ya tomorrow!" Dean called after him through the open window, and Castiel waved before running up to his front door and hurrying inside.
Sam stepped forward to watch the single line of melted wax move toward Italy, to Sicily, before it finally stopped on Cefalù.
Dean stepped up beside Cas and took his hand. He had to yell to be heard over the screams and chanting, “You beat Crowley, and all the rest of these nightmares. You survived! You’re here with me. Right here, right now, and you can do it again.”
. He brought his hand up, reached, was about to touch his palm to Castiel’s, but then the panic in his mind surged, halting his hand at the last moment.
“I say we call in some help from Belarus,” Garth suggested. “That old woman Hannah stayed with would probably know what to do.”
Dean’s brows furrowed as he checked his pocket for his phone. He was sure he had left it right…his mind suddenly flashed to mere moments earlier, when Cas had brushed past him to get into the room…
He gently picked up the cat and, cradling it against his chest, carried it into the house. After laying it out on the kitchen table, he ran gentle hands over its fur to check for other injuries, but the damage seemed limited to its paw.
By the time he danced with Crowley, a sarcastic alpha whose hands roamed and words grated a little too much, he felt he had enough information to present three plausible alternatives to Charles and John. He just had to double check his facts before they headed home.
“If you so much as step within twenty feet of him again,” Dean paused, let his words resonate. “I’ll push you out the front gate myself.”
“I tried to hold him back, I really did, but he’s determined. I think…I think it might’ve been what Jo said.”
Castiel nodded, his expression tentative. “Hester came to see me yesterday,” he paused, deliberated. “Actually, make that ambushed. Hester ambushed me yesterday, after our lunch. She wants you to come meet the family this weekend.”
, barely in passing, and everything in me jerked to attention. I knew I should play it cool, just walk away and text one of my usuals, but I couldn’t...not when I could learn more about
Cas turned to smile at him. “I said I wasn’t moving there.” He glanced at Dean. “I’d still like to bury Ana near her home.”
Castiel winced at how close to escape he was, then slunk into the kitchen. His stomach flipped, and he hoped that his mouth wasn't too swollen. Even if it was, he doubted Naomi would notice.
Dean frowned at the idea, but Hannah was quick to correct his assumption. “To protect you, not push you away.”
“I certainly hope so,” Cas murmured, then he was out the door, running through the pouring rain to the still-empty house.
And if what Mary was saying was true (and there was no reason for her to lie) then It wasn't all some pathetic, one-sided crush that would never be reciprocated. This whole time, Dean had been just as crazy about Castiel as Castiel was about Dean.
The cat rushed forward and rubbed against his legs, purring happily. With a shake of his head, Cas turned and continued on to the house, the cat right on his heels.
“Who is Castiel,” Dean finished. “We’re made for each other, Cas. The alpha gene came from my family. The omega gene came from your temple.” He shook his head. “You and I, we never stood a chance. Even without that stupid machine, we would’ve ended up here together.”
She looked up at him, her eyes damp. “There’s been some kind of emergency with Gabe. Hester called saying Cas and Meg both had to go now.”
Dean had never really believed in that “True Mates” nonsense. There were so many other factors that went into a solid relationship, elements that were needed to maintain the connection even after that rush of “first scent” wore off. But here, staring into this gorgeous alpha’s blue blue eyes, Dean was second guessing himself.
Dean‘s hands curled into fists as he shook with rage. “I did everything right! We’d cleared the building, triple checked every cam—“
Ana arched a brow at him then stepped inside, and immediately Sam realized how silly his worries had been. Yes, a stone giant jumped from the shadows ready to attack, but with a flick of her fingers, Ana sent it tumbling back into the earth.
“How did he find out?” He forced the question between numb lips, even as he felt his insides shriveling away with the realization that he’d been found out...this was really it for him and Cas.
Castiel’s eyes flashed over the rim of his wine glass as he took another sip, his mouth turning up at the corners. Even with his attempt at hiding the smirk, Dean caught it.
So if Cas was saying he had a thing with his parents, it was obviously a ploy to avoid me. And that was only confirmed when I texted him the next night, and he begged off because his dog was sick.
Cas sighed. “I know. Dean…” He looked so lost, and for that split moment, Dean saw him. Not Europol Detective Cas, no, but
to the third person on his way to his locker the next morning. Even then, it didn't really click until Anna stopped to ask him how his day was going and if he wanted to study sometime for government.
The royal family all took breakfast in their separate chambers, which was so different from home. John kept a rigid schedule, and every moment of his family’s day was micromanaged. So Dean and Sam were reveling in their veritable lawlessness as they pigged out in pajamas.
Dean turned to Victor and the few remaining men. “Wait here, on your guard. If we’re not back in fifteen, shut it.”
Castiel heaved out a heavy sigh. "Because I know that it'll get him so pissed when he realizes that it all is true."
Castiel sighed and slowly shut the door behind him. Maybe he should text Dean back, apologize?  But even as the thought passed through his head, he dismissed it. Dean probably didn't want to hear from him.
I told you all before, I’m not new to the game. But goddamn if that shy little smile of his didn’t completely undo me.
That little wink had stayed with Castiel all afternoon, until long after both school and chess club had ended. Castiel had barely made it into his room before tearing off his pants and briefs, his hands eagerly reaching to touch and please. Afterward, he'd lay there panting and sated, smiling dopily.
Dean leaned in for a soft peck then snuggled into Castiel’s neck and gave a muffled ”Thank you, Alpha.”
He glanced at his watch. 7:17. He needed to leave now if he was going to catch that 7:58 back to Amsterdam. Harvelle had this interview under control, despite what she had said about needing his help. So far, all he’d managed to do was get his heart broken by Dean all over again.
"Have you been wearing those all day?" Dean wondered, and Castiel nodded happily. He climbed back up over Dean, dropping down on top of him to kiss him again.
Blue eyes flashed through his mind, and Dean moaned again, this time with a hoarse sob. Why did his memory keep replaying those brief moments with his alpha? It only served to torture him more, drive him insane with the knowledge of his rejection.
“This machine creates bonds between alphas and omegas. It does not require any emotional, spiritual, or physical connection. It simply...creates those connections with a fresh bond.” Castiel sighed and muttered, “Even as he tore souls apart, Zeus could only dream of the chaos mankind has created.”
Sam frowned in confusion, but Cas immediately understood. Omegas’ heats were brutal to begin with, and according to the rumors Castiel had heard, they only got worse after meeting their true mate.
Pain, excruciating and visceral, lanced through Dean’s mind, his heart, his very soul. It felt like someone had ripped open his consciousness and shoved a thousand knives in deep. He thrashed, trying to wake up, to get away from the pain, but a fist had closed around him, trapping him in his sleep.
Dean’s smile matched Cas’s as he asked, “Will you marry me?” Before Cas could even answer, he was rambling on. “Not now, of course...but in a couple of years, maybe? Like, after we’re settled and ready and—”
Dean nodded silently and motioned for the alpha to continue. He ignored the fresh spike of hope in his heart.
So when the cat started meowing plaintively, staring at him with its pleading eyes, Cas just offered a sad smile and shook his head.
They’d just left the lemonade stand, jumbo cups of the sugary beverage held in the free hands that weren’t clasped between them, when Castiel pulled Dean toward a secluded bench off the major path. He settled down, pulling Dean with him, and offered a tentative smile at Dean’s questioning eyebrow.
Cas scanned the area, wondering where Ketch might be, but his one-time schoolmate was nowhere to be found. Even so, there was still a flush to Dean’s skin, a shininess in his eyes. Castiel almost growled at the thought of Ketch being the one to tease those changes from Dean.
Something in Dean’s tone must have pierced through the haze, because Brady finally shut up. “Right, of course. I didn’t mean to overstep, Man.” He stood and offered a final wave before spinning and stumbling from the room.
The only times he’d come close to feeling anything there in that vast pit had been those few moments when he’d been with Dean.
Dean led Castiel further into the house, reveling in the way the dark haired boy’s fingers tightened around his.
“Sam,” he choked, and just as Sam spun around to look at him, at what he’d found, the dark silence of the oppressive chute exploded in a cacophony of light and heat and sound, flinging both men backwards.
So New York it would be, and Cas could hardly wait. The only downside was his distance from Dean, but they'd already talked about it and agreed to just roll with the punches. No promises, no demands, just themselves and what they could give. And, as Cas kept reminding himself, if he and Dean were truly supposed to be together (they were) then these years would fly by like nothing.
He squirted some more lube onto Dean's cock, smiling flirtatiously as he lined himself up and sunk down, taking him all the way to the base.
Cas slipped back into the gallery, humming softly under his breath. He didn’t like overanalyzing these things; it inevitably led to self-sabotage on his part. He still couldn’t help but marvel at how little it took to lift his mood when it came to Dean. Lunch hadn’t been anything special, just soups and sandwiches at a little deli. Even so, his mood had lifted substantially.
Yeah, it would’ve gotten attention from some tabloid or other—those damn reporters were everywhere. This tour though, he’d done a pretty good job of staying out of their sights. It’s not that he minded the tabloids, they gave him free advertising. He just hadn’t once felt like
“And I’ll invite Dean,” Cas announced as he whipped out his phone, missing the fond smile that Jess and Sam shared.
Dean shushed him as he ran a soothing hand down Castiel's back. "We'll get there. I just gotta make sure you're ready," he murmured, his hand slipping down to Castiel's hole. He found it already slick and open for him.
The cat, which had somehow snuck in the back, meowed loudly, plaintively. Cas rolled his eyes again and opened the door.
"Yeah, but that was hours before. So what happened between my text and yours that made you so desperate?"
All of his classmates at his richy-rich school had their BMWs and their...Lexuses? Lexusi? Who gave a fuck. All Cas knew was that they never got caught in the rain, never had to stand and wait for a smelly, dirty tube to transport them only half of the way home.
Castiel glared at him, but spit the painful words out anyway. “Look at Dean and tell me they didn’t have sex.”
Dean pulled him into another long kiss, one that seemed somehow sweet and gentle and fervent and enthusiastic all at once. When they parted, Cas smiled dopily, but suddenly drew up short.
“I figured it was time for us to finally catch up, face to face,” Victor led him to the empty conference room with its opaque glass walls and waved him inside.
After a long pause, she allowed her magic to fade from his. She stood beside him, listening as he recited the spell carefully, slowly, so that she heard and understood every word.
"They're my favorites. Do you wanna know why?" Castiel teased as he began to stroke himself through the fabric.
“Please tell me,” he whispered for Cas’s ears only. “You’ll be spending the night in my room as soon as they release me. We don’t have to do anything, I just...”
Cas crossed his legs at the ankle, his entire pose nonchalant. He glanced down at his shoes before looking back up at Dean through his lashes. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
As they played this game—him pulling his hand away, the cat chasing it with the key—his decision grew clearer in his mind.
Rachel stepped up beside him just then, and Michael smiled down at his mate as he took her arm in his to guide her into the dining room. Castiel trailed behind them, watching the way their heads leaned together, allowing the mates to whisper and giggle, just so...so damn
“Exactly,” Cas hissed. “Because she may be an overbearing, controlling bitch,” he spit the word out, “but she doesn’t make me do anything illegal to prove my loyalty. She doesn’t try to sell me off to some disgusting thug.”
“I’m sorry, but that’s just the way it is, Dean.” The alpha frowned. “I know you’re still young, but I’ve seen it all too many times.”
He slipped into the bathroom during his lunch period just to get a break from it all. He went into a stall and, after making sure the seat was clean, sat down for a moment. He looked at the graffiti on the walls around him, rolling his eyes at the usual bullshit until one blurb caught his eye.
Dean caught it, though, and suddenly it all made sense. He smiled at Castiel, his eyes bright, before turning back to Crowley.
“Oh, my bad” Dean said, then let the subject drop naturally as an elderly woman stepped up to greet Cas.
“Why would I go see…” Cas hesitated, “any of them?” he finished harshly, the corners of his lips drawing down as he signed another form with an angry flourish.
He knew, somewhere in the back of his mind, that he really should stop staring. Common sense demanded it...and yet, he didn’t feel inclined to listen to common sense in that moment. And if he was reading this correctly, the stranger wasn’t planning on looking away anytime soon either. He stared his fill, just like Castiel did.
I knew he was smart enough to make it happen, and he’d get himself into a good school. But I also knew, even as a ninth grader, what else that meant: more money.
Dean brought a hand to Cas’s chin and gently tilted his face up so their gazes met. “First time we met? Definitely.” He brushed Cas’s dark hair behind his ear. “But after London, I realized that I felt more in that five-minute conversation with you than I had for Lisa in a long while. I had to admit I was holding onto a memory.”
And then he turned away and strode back out. Tossing out Castiel’s name like that had been bold, risky, but it should keep Zachariah off his back for a little while, at least. He hated those last-minute judgment calls, whenever they arose, but that’s what he’d been trained for.
A moment later, Cas mumbled a sleepy “I’m so glad you’re home.” He pressed a quick kiss to Dean’s chest then drifted away again.
And Dean usually set aside most of his cash for Sammy’s college tuition, but he’d used some of it to take Cas to St. Bart’s for Spring Break. So when he’d popped the question as they lay panting into each other’s cooling skin, Cas’s answer had been immediate and sure:
play the long game. Yet even as he gasped and moaned and breathed my name, something about his behavior made it clear that sex wasn’t happening.
The serenity was ruined when Dean burst into the room, startling Sam into nearly sloshing his wine, and then rushed past without a word.
The house was warm and full of light. The most delicious thing Castiel had ever smelled filled his nose. He could hear singing from one room and laughter from another. He suddenly felt...safe. Like he belonged here. He leaned into Dean and nodded.
He watched as smaller children grabbed onto older children, thrilled at the prospect of being “buddies” with a big kid. The older children, having already been given a talk about helping out and doing their part, loved that they were old enough to have such an important responsibility to help Cas.
“We should go paintballing soon,” Sam suggested. “We haven’t been since before…” he trailed off for a moment, then pushed on, “since before.”
Cas sighed. “That was...that was the only time I’ve ever been without Ana. She was taken, but I was left behind.”
She sighed dramatically and placed a hand over her heart. Castiel just rolled his eyes and kicked her desk before turning to face the front.
"He didn't know," Castiel pointed out, pulling his knees to his chest. "And it's not like we were exclusive. I just thought... I thought he..." Castiel shook his head again. Crowley pulled him to his chest.
“I honestly didn’t think he was serious!” Balth gasped out between his laughs. “Our valedictorian ran off with the town drug dealer!”
“Did he seem upset or in pain or...” Dean trailed off, again overwhelmed by the damage he might have caused the young man.
“What?” Dean hissed, his anxiety spiking as the awful possibilities tripped through his head. Cas had been found out, he’d been taken captive, he’d been hurt, or even killed… Dean’s eyes skipped to the shed in the distance. Maybe he was in the cage.
Dean shrugged. "All over. We lived in Cali for a while, then Florida, then moved around the Midwest some—you know, Illinois and Indiana and Ohio."
So when Cas had realized the truth about Dean, his unassuming mechanic from the States, it had hurt…it had hurt so much. But not nearly as much when Dean had left without a word. He’d hopped out of a bathroom window, leaving nothing but a worn-down pair of boots and a few toiletries behind. And now Cas was left with nothing but the memories, beautiful smoky memories that danced around Cas’s periphery, taunting him.
