Auntie Peg looked taken aback, eyes wide. An Alpha, friends with an Omega? It was unheard of, especially in the upper classes of society. I watched as her eyebrow furrowed, rose and then furrowed again.
“Oh.”
And as I lay in my bed, tears falling down my cheeks, I held my ring finger up to the moonlight. And I felt a strange feeling. A feeling of hope.
The thug bled to death as Natasha sobbed against another dead body, this one with several stab wounds. Still warm.
It didn’t happen, however.
“I hope you’ll be able to see me.”
I have it tucked into my corset. The page is wrinkled and the spelling is wrong in places, and the ink has ran. But is still my first diary entry. Even if I use a cat, rather than myself. It’s hard to write about yourself when you don’t understand who exactly you are.
The Alpha stopped, shoulders stiffening. “How could I send you away? Who else would I have to annoy?” He spoke curtly, quickly. “Now come on, you big lug.”
“I like to create things.” I let the statement drop out of my mouth, the taste like led. My eyes creased shut; afraid of a twinge in her expression or a fall within the crevices of her mouth. There was silence, and it felt like dirt falling on top of me. I repeated myself.
“Agent Carter, this is wha-“
We had not spoken since that fateful day. I wanted to tumble out of the carriage and speak to him about what had transpired and what had happen to my ring, but I also knew that it would be improper and would lead to serious consequences.
“Oh Tony, I’m making sure you get the wealthiest, best Alpha I can find.” She told me with a slight bump on the hip.
Natasha:
“My sister is turning sixteen tomorrow.” He told me suddenly. I nodded softly.
Of course, most books in the room were written by Omegas, oppressed individuals, self-confessed Nomads. Diaries. I picked one up, enjoyed with little floral motif that had been drawn so delicately onto the front of the book, bound by lace, and opened the front.
I fell in love with the idea of making my own wooden prince and princess and castle and horses. Dara, the maid who was with me, was young and seemed to hold the ideals most young people do, until it is beaten or married out of you. Had bought it for me and paid two teenage Alphas to carry it to the house. My mother was out, and my father was probably drunk in bed, so nobody was able to spot us and tell us what was wrong. I was eight at the time, and not particularly attractive at that age. I had grown, and my body had not caught up. I was nothing more than a strange distortion of youth and lankiness that was merely an embarrassment at that age.
It makes me feel ill.
My chest heaved, heart pounding; cracking my ribs, forcing the fine splinters to splice through my skin. Had they murdered Rhodey?
I had a lot of questions about Natasha, as I ate thick cuts of bread layered with freshly churned butter. I wonder now if I should have spoken to her then, or if she would have been just as weary of me as I was, initially, of her.
It wasn’t until a nightdress was pulled down over my head that I finally responded in a manner that did not resemble a child’s doll. I grabbed her hand, pulling Dara close. She appeared shocked, but sat beside my anyway.
That evening I returned home after a long journey with Pepper. She then told me that I would return to Totleigh Manor with her once every three weeks. She got out of the carriage to get my bag, which was also stuffed with reading material and pencils and paper, and gave me a large hug. I hugged her back.
“I guess so…” I tapered off, looking around. “It’s really warm in here.” I commented, earning a slight chuckle from Pepper.
… I’ll share it regardless:
“Good morning, Tony.” Natasha spoke softly as she ate some toast covered in a red jam. I nodded, still sleepy. She took my nod as a reply and went back to… writing? I believe at the time she was writing.
In many ways, she saved me from my demise.
That evening, Dara told me that a week on Thursday, Miss Potts would pick me up in the morning and I would not be back until Friday evening.
Pepper, true to her word, picked me up a week on Thursday.
That was up to people like my Father and Lord Obidiah Stane.
“Actually,” I began “Miss Potts gave it to me for free.”
“Why yes… But don’t worry about that. It is the sign of well-taking to the binds.” My mother waved her hand in the air flittingly, eyes rolling in a whimsical manner with a bright smile. I watched her perform for Virginia, letting out a quiet sigh in relief as my lungs took in air that I did not I had been declining them. She petted my shoulders comfortingly.
Loki raised an eyebrow. “Well, obviously she will. She isn’t as kind as father. She doesn’t want you around, Thor. You’d be a nuisance – I mean, you are anyway. Now come on.”
I take it out and read it:
“Please, drop by anytime.” My mother said, though she only extended the welcoming offer to Pepper as a form of politeness. I knew she had no intentions of seeing Miss Pepper Potts again until the next check up.
But it would still be private.
“I’ll sort it, Tony… Now, go and get in the carriage.” She ordered gently, flicking my nose. I nod, clambering up the steps into the handsome oak travelling carriage, tracing the velvet padding with my forefinger.
Obadiah removes his finger and waved it in front of me. It is covered in slick and blood and sweat. He removes his other hand from my mouth and roughly jerks my head into a kiss. He doesn’t care that I am sobbing uncontrollably. Instead, he finishes the kiss, licks his finger clean, and gives on final sniff.
“I’m not sure who I am.” I told Pepper gently. “I’m not my mother or my father, or anybody else I know.”
My worries are unneeded, however; he stands with a look of tranquillity about him, face tilted towards the clouds, arms outstretched, body glistening, almost.
I can imagine it in my head, exactly how it would have happened. The satisfied smirk shown through the corners of an upturned lip, eyes narrowed as if calculating the amount of newly added prestige, nostrils flared from the stench of my mother’s gushing body, still in the midst of delivering the afterbirth, the fists clenched as if to punch the sky or punch the doctor. Hair a mess from the heat of the room, masses of the humid warmth swelling from my mother’s stretched belly.
“But her buying it would get her into trouble too.” I pointed out.
Hundreds of personalities left themselves on that wall. It was a wall of evidence that we were not alone and I, for the first time in my life, might not be as wrong or as unsuitable or as un-Omega as the people in my life had led me to believe.
The song came to an end at Pepper used slightly too much power was she pushed me away, sending me flying. I landed, of course, where no decent Omega should land.
“The contrary, Madam Stark.” The sad, sympathetic tone made the hair on my skin stick up; kindness was something rare between myself and strangers, especially in my youth. Whether the cause was my gender or name, I am not certainly sure. It might have been a dark, sickly amalgamation of both now that I reflect back on it all. Virginia Potts rubbed a soft finger down the tender flesh of my inner waist, causing me to mewl from sensitivity. There was a pointed look towards my mother, who let out a distinctively maternal cluck. “Do you suffer from damp spots, Madam Stark?”
Tony makes a new friend and celebrates his tenth birthday in an interesting fashion.
“Where?” I ask.
Pepper took me to a room that had two beds and again, more books. I assumed that every single room in this manor probably was crammed with them, which was in no terms a bad thing. The beds were large and covered in knitted blankets and goose feather pillows that were guaranteed to drift you off into a heavenly sleep. The windows were wide and the length of the room, with alcove ledges that were raised. They had been padded with cushions, a make-shift seating area.
It would not belong, however, until I learned what such thoughts and feelings were actually called.
I had to stop thinking that way.
Pepper walked into the dining room, holding the door open for two men.
I sat back down and began to draw my new plan.
The bed was wooden, oak, four poster, with dangling muslin. Between two posts that lined up against the wall, the phrase ‘Today I am fighting, tomorrow I am free’ painted in thick black paint.
Her hand left my shoulder and I keened at the loss of such a comforting touch. Virginia walked over to the bag she had bought with her and took out a light yellow box, decorated with a lime green bow on the top.  She handed it to me, with a kind smile. “Happy birthday, Anthony.”
“It’s a promise ring.” Rhodey whispered to me gently, taking it out the box. It shone in the light, as Rhodey inspected it. It looked smooth and delicate. A promise ring. I did not understand what a promise ring was at that age. Rhodey went on one knee and I felt my face flush deeper. He took a hold of my hand.
He always said stuff like that. It made my chest heavy, because saying stuff like that was illegal but could it really be illegal when he was an Alpha and Alphas decided what was illegal? I stroked the hem of my sleeve absently. The conversation was dead; he knew I would not respond to that and he could not say anymore, despite the list of things that he wished he would say.
… A girl that haunts me…
Obidiah spoke about the mutilation of the Omega-child as if he was speaking about the ripest of fruit.
She wasn’t allowed to be alone with me then, but the damage had already been done.
I would be punished severely and father will ensure that I am given to the most destructive of Alphas, an Alpha who would crush my spirit and amputate my hands if given any reason.
When Pepper came to collect me in the early morning, the deep orange sunbeam rays lighting up her red hair in a flair of hope, only Dara was there to say goodbye.
It sounded amazing. It also sounded like something I couldn’t trust. Another trap, my brain sprung up to the forefront of my mind. I quickly shoved it back with an inwardly huff. Not Pepper. Not when she had already broken many rules regarding what was traditionally expected of both her role and mine.
Thor wanted to fight. He wanted to show-off… but he was kept in a watch tower far from the battle with an older man with the fiercest eyes one could ever see.
The city sounded like a place that would allow me to be free. Whatever freedom was. But first I had to figure out a few things.
I looked down at the twentieth draft and nodded. Maybe twenty would be my lucky number? Pepper grinned at threw some clothes at me. Cords, I noted, Alpha clothing. I blushed despite myself. There was nothing wrong with not wearing a dress or skirt for once in my life. Cords would be a change. Why worry about being Un-Omega regarding clothing when clearly, I had already committed much worse sins.
Though, he also earned a pretty penny through other works; there was a world somewhere that respected Omegas, a world that was not obsessed with stressing the place of an Omega or keeping an Omega oppressed by rules.
“I’m glad you have a friend Tony. That Alpha boy you speak of. It’s good to meet a range of people.”
He looks beautiful.
I felt a slight give in my lower thigh and I fell back, onto the sofa. There was something covering my neck and my breathing came in a series of short puffs. A hand on my arm. I suppose that the intent was a comforting gesture on my mother’s part, but it did not help. Instead, I yell out, thrashing. I felt my palm make contact with flowery lilac skin. The hand disappears; I had struck my mother and the punishment would be severe.
People, strangers, were trying to understand who I was and would become downstairs. Back at home, in the village, my mother and father think they know who I was and who I would become. It was a simple waiting game for them; just ironing out a few mistakes and then presenting me at the age of sixteen with a pretty white bow wrapped around my virginal body.
The ceremony usually went as followed: Omegas only, besides the Match Makers, who sit in a semi-circle around a raised stage. The of Age Omegas would sit at the front, the younger ones at the back. The Omega who the ceremony was for would kneel on the stage as their Match Maker stood to the left of them, their mother on the right.
Another Omega who could read? I was not aware that was… a possibility?
“Smooth cunny.” He praises into my ear. “You little angel.” He presses his forehead against mine and stares into my eyes. I stare back despite the tears and the pain. Let him see the fucking putrid feeling in my gut. He frowns and jabs something  filled with nerves. I squeal and he throws his head back. “Hmm… Making me feel like this, with just a finger!” He laughs. “Good boy, clinging to my finger. So tight…” He jabs that place again and I squeal. I am bleeding below, and I have a headache. It hurts, it all hurts.
‘Of course dear… I just want what is best for our son.’
“Well, surely she knew that it was a bad idea to allow you to have a workbench? She certainly did not seem impressed by me when we met last, so I doubt she is aware of the movement.”
“Come on, Dr. Banner will be up now… is your plan ready?” She asked.
I shake my head violently.
It still was constricting and made my waist impossibly small once again, but this time it didn’t feel sore or to too tight, even as she pulled at the stays with a light grunt. The cream colour met nicely with my flesh and I blushed as I caught my expression in the mirror. For the first time, my body appeared attractive to my own eyes.
“Forgive me, it’s just…” he pointed at the workshop “Your father won’t like to see this in here.” He tilted his head to the side, letting out a low chuckle. “You were organising it? That’s good. Afterall, a good workspace is-“
She was going to free them.
But it couldn’t be obvious, surely? If it were obvious, then it would be a waste of time!
The sentence of course being something so simple, so easy that now I yearn for the straight forward knowledge and understanding that came with it.
I tentatively touch her shoulder, wishing that speaking my mind wasn’t such a risk.
“Um… I can make wood stuff… Like, um… Chairs? I can design good though. I have the correct tools to design at home, not so much build… Sir.” I added the sir on at the end, like Pepper did. It was the wrong thing to do, it appeared, as the doctor’s body went stiff as the word left my mouth.
Pepper:
“I’m afraid not, Madam Stark. I must travel back to the city for a meeting this evening. It has been an absolute pleasure meeting you and Tony.”
At the age of five, I was poked and prodded and wrapped up tight so that I might achieve a size 23 waist at the age of sixteen. Most Match Makers work with the family for life, but the old, haggard woman with breath like sour milk and whiskers that belonged on a dying cat died when I was 10. It was then her granddaughter, only six years my elder, who took over the position. I was her first client, and she tutted in shame when she first saw the tender flesh under the five-year-old cloth wrapping.
Because they could conceal it easily.
Yet I would be forgotten. I’d watch the Omegas present themselves, like a selection of fine jewellery. Alphas would give them gestures, and the Omega would either ride back to the stables or lurk around, waiting for a thumbs up and the swish of a wrist. So, I’d watch this strange type of courting before I knew what was happening.
“Plan… Dr. Banner… Plan…”
“Dr. Banner, Tony Stark is no threat. I am his Match Maker. I have permission from Howard Stark himself! He thinks I’ve taken him on a manner’s course.” She laughed at the thought. “Trust in me, sir, an ill-outcome is impossible!”
There was a pang in my chest. Pepper didn’t live five minutes away like Rhodey did. She was a city Beta, somebody who was used to busy schedules and busy streets and a busy mind. My mother would not dare allow such influences into my life; it was the very reason she had to make Auntie Peg’s visits fleetingly short and always within her or Dara’s earshot.
Thank you for reading so far. I'm sorry for the long break; I needed it.
Her eyes darted around, looking for a tool, something to help her.
I love Thor; I hope he’s well.
I still never touched it at that age. I was too afraid that some monster would eat me if I attempted to stroke to prod the passageway to my womb.
Sawing took time. I feel ashamed at admitting this now, but sawing terrified me at first. Rhodey had to place his hands over mine and steady me as he pulled my body forward and back.
Miss Drayton, an elderly woman who had Dara’s position as ‘nanny’ before the events I am about to reveal, took pity to my circumstances. At first, milk. Then cream, then porridge. All liquid-based and just about palatable. My mother, who had seen my sudden downhill turn in health as a punishment from the lord for speaking about becoming a knight, did not know at first what Miss Drayton was doing. Instead, she believed the return in energy was a sign that the lord had changed my mindset into becoming more Omega. Whatever it means to become ‘more Omega’ in the first place, heaven knows not I.
There were books on all surfaces of the hall. Shelves, drawers, cabinets, chairs, even the floor were covered in thick, leather-bound novels and anthologies and theories and research papers. I had never seen so many books, in my entire life! Newspapers, certainly. But never these thick things with more information than I could possibly ever retain, even if I lived a thousand years.
“You’ll probably be engaged next time I see you, Tony.” She said with red eyes. She wiped them with a swipe of her sleeve, letting out a choking laugh. Her hands, rough from hard labour, ran through my hair. “So you be good and you work hard, but whatever you do, don’t let them kill that spark.” She squeezed my shoulder tight.
Natasha went and took my bags, whispered a quick word to the driver, handed him money, watched him leave and close the gates. Every action she performed was done with such precision…
Of course, many details of the Asgardian Civil War were changed and protected; ‘Queen’ Hela was an influential power and consequently, made finding out the details of the war difficult to read without great passages about Hela being inserted.
Thank you again!
“The present is inside the box, silly.” He cooed at me. I flushed red and opened the box. Another box was resting inside. I tried not to look hurt as I took it out and opened it.
I could dance. Not very well, since the teacher found me far too hyper-active and quit after only six lessons of teaching me. I wanted to turn and swoop and move all around. That was expected of Omegas and, as expected from my youth, I was punished for making a mockery of my family through being so un-Omega like. Being locked in a room for three days straight sounds fun, so long as there is some sort of relief for the brain. But Father had removed all of my toys and I was without much stimulation. I think that my brain compensated by growing my imagination. An unsuitable thing for an Omega to use.
I smiled, enjoying the opportunity I now had to show off my room. I know now that the size of one’s bed or the plumpness of one’s pillow is not an accurate or correct method of identifying one’s happiness or contentedness in life. It was a hard lesson to learn, however.
“Then, we’ll see in six months how well it works, Miss Potts. Would you like a cup of tea?” She went to refill Pepper’s tea cup but was stopped with a curt shake of the head.
“Yes. Breathing is an option today.” She hummed in agreement, and ran her dutifully painted nails down the present she had given me. She then wrapped it around me, tight. I took in a quick breath, ready to feel my organs shift and deform.
“Dead, sadly. Suicide. Could not live with his sins. Of course, his time as a painted harlot must have affected him a great deal. The death was not a loss, more food to go around.”
“Why?”
“Loki? If you were King, then would you send me away?”
He smiled at me, toothy and wide. I felt embarrassed at that smile. He was a handsome boy, small muscles forming, ready to take shape into Alphahood. He and the other Alpha, a 15 year old named Maria who was, in all accounts, quite terrifying, placed the workbench and accessories in the middle of my room. Dara paid the two and sent them on their way.
“What now, Mother?” I asked, knowing of three possibilities.
The second man to enter was quite a bit shorter and plain-looking than Thor. He seemed nervous, which is something I could appreciate given the sort of atmosphere he was in. The man smiled at Natasha and me, before looking down.
“That is-“
“Then yes. Mother says it’s bad to rub education in the face of the less privileged.” Rhodey let out a scoff and I sudden felt a little bit foolish.
“It’ll prove to be quite fun, I feel.”
I hugged him tightly. The fourteen-year-old smiled and ruffled my hair. He had a sack slung over his shoulder, and I gazed at him in anticipation.
“Because if your Pa finds out I’m here, then I’ll be toast and you’ll be in trouble to. I don’t want you to be in trouble.”
She told him that, in layman’s terms, he should fuck off and die.
“Nobody ever seemed really happy. It all felt fake. So fake.”
Things were quiet until Mother came back. I spent my time in bed, thinking about Rhodey and the events that had transpired thus far. I was the one who initiated the kiss, who made the strange moan-noise, who had gotten Rhodey into trouble. I would be punished by God for ruining my purity.
The Omega only child that can only do wrong.
I wonder now if it was instead the promise of whisky and whores that really got the Alphas attracted to becoming soldiers? There certainly wasn’t any other benefits to the work; that was, of course, unless you were high ranking.
It was only to be expected; Alphas wouldn’t want an Omega to play with something so potentially dangerous. But I wasn’t his Omega, and I certainly wasn’t going to allow him to tell me what to do. He wasn’t my Alpha.
“Pepper, do you dance?” I asked. The read head shook ‘no’. “I can dance, Mother said I had to prepare for my wedding.”
I ran to the window to see Rhodey glide down the lawn and around the corner, assumedly back to his other Alpha friends. My heart felt light and hot and wobbly, and I smiled to myself. “Rhodey.”
“Make sure she doesn’t get on that throne, of course. Does mean you’re swearing allegiance to me, Valkyrie?”
He let out a soft yelp as I landed full bottomed on his lap. His book dropped down the side of the armchair and I took in a deep breath, awaiting a telling off about acting proper. He was still an Alpha, after all. And had every right to belittle me.
I knew that Alphas who entered romantic or sexual relationships with other Alphas were castrated. Omegas who entered relationships with other Omegas had their wombs and tongues removed.
I hoped that I and Rhodey would find a way.
“Wherever it is Miss Potts has found.”
Loki, despite his stoic and unfriendly front, cared about his older brother. The two of them together had challenged ideas on what makes an Omega an Omega and Alpha an Alpha. They had trained together, and even though he knew his older sibling could pick him up and throw him if wanted to, they trusted one another.
“Loki, talk to the Meister. There’s going to be some changes.” She ordered.
Snorting, Natasha placed her lips next to my ear. “He and the Doctor were dancing, she’s jealous that nobody asked her to dance.” She faux-whispered.
… I could have been her.
God. A worthy comparison, I suppose. God has always been a sadist.
“Aun-aunt Peggy…” I began, only to be met with a steel-bone gaze. I bit back another pathetic whimper that hung in my throat like a bad breath. I had to speak! “Rhodey is… is my friend.”
But Pepper would to right by me.
There were not many occasions for an Omega to feel like the centre of attention, but during the festivities after the ceremony, Omegas seized the opportunity like a cat upon a mouse. All who were part of the ceremony must give the Omega a gift. A needle set, a new tea cup, some dress lining material. Something useful that they could use once they moved into their Alpha’s home.
I would be taken away, re-educated and made into a mindless Omega.
“No?” Obadiah gets closer. “Perhaps I should inspect you again? More thoroughly?” He sniffs at my sex again and I wail. “Thought not. You’re a mess down there.” He gets off my bed, staring over me. “Like some kind of corpse.” He mocks. “That’s what the Rhodes boy will be.”
“What?” I looked confused. Rhodey smiled nervously.
That had been the issue; her attitude. Her need to play pretend. I remember when one day, she never turned up to our play date, Mother first explained to me Lord Stane’s role in our society.
“Smile, you whore!”
Virginia crushed that desire with her quick, joyful response.
Hela was near-lethal with her moves, often landing a kick that came in hand with a sickening sound of a crunch. Loki was often too fast, but sometimes she would get the corner of his mouth, top of his knee, the tip of his big toe.
“Madam Stark, I believe that I have a much better method that will stop the skin from becoming dry, blotchy and irritated. It will certainly prove to be far less painful than what the wet rag-
Dr. Banner didn’t look up from his work. “Good morning, Tony.” He said calmly. I placed the design on top of his work. He froze. “What?”
I let out a sob, hugging her close. “We never did anything, Mother. I can promise you this, never!”
“I love this room, the view from the windows is breath taking.” Pepper took my hand and sat me down beside her at the alcove. She pressed her forehead against the glass and I did the same. The room was to the back of the manor. The garden was long and filled with colour, a pond residing in the middle. A barn was also in close proximity; with a shed also close by. Horses, sheep and chickens roamed the land freely.
“I would love to spend the day with you, Miss Potts.” I told her. I meant it, truly. I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be sold to Rhodey if I had to go to any Alpha at all.
I throw up over myself, and collapse into a dreamless sleep.
It was why she resided at Totleigh Manor, where Omegas were given choices and freedoms. She could not help the ones who she personally had doomed, so instead she settled with preventing such things from happening.
I felt my head go light once more at the thought of being added to Obadiah’s list of Omegas. I do not wish to become an empty shell, when I have recently learned how there were others in my situation, shamed and isolated and ready to learn.
“You don’t talk much about your homeland.” I say, unsure if what I was saying was appropriate.
Pepper gave a quick nod to the head, smiling easily. “Certainly, Madam Stark. It can be tightened throughout his growth. And can, unlike the rags, be removed for bathing.” She informed my mother, who in turn just nodded in response.
I could read and write.
Father was away. Mother was sleeping. Dara was visiting her seamstress sister in the city whilst I was away.
Then they’d be alive.
So I put my ear up against the oak, listening intently.
Dr Banner was sat at the table, as was Natasha. Thor was nowhere to be seen, however.
The door opened. “Go away, Da-“
It was early, the sky red from the sun’s entrance back into our skies. I had always wondered about the sun and the moon and the stars; what where they? How did they get up there? How long would it take to reach one? What did we look like to other humans on the stars, if there were any at all?
“What if Hela heard you, moron?!” He hissed, hitting the back of his head. Loki jutted forward, before laughing.
It was idyllic.
I was going to destroy him; there was no way I could not succeed.
“Heimdell, let me out, please! I know I can help!” Thor would shout, body slumped against the wall.
I asked her again for information regarding where precisely we were going. Totleigh Manor, she responded.
“So, what do you do all day, Tony?”
James Rhodes stayed behind, waiting until Dara had gone back to the kitchen before appearing back in my room. I had been admiring the new gift, inspecting the nails. They felt dull and heavy in my hand, mothing like the shining steel that were fastened tightly into my bedroom wall. It didn’t bother, though; they felt so different to the wooden toys and the felt toys and the paper toys that I had been surrounded by all my life.
Pepper:
When I was younger, my fifth birthday to be precise, I was made to undergo the first stages of becoming what, at the time, was expected of me. The cloth had been soaked in lavender infused stream water, sourced from the mouth of the river Fern, six miles north of my settlement. The material, a light blue I think, had been treated and stretched and wrapped and stretched again by my mother’s staff, so that they would give me the perfect waist in years to come. It was an honour, my mother had told me as I sobbed openly at the feeling of my body being squeezed and packaged into the itchy, damp confines of the cloth. An honour.
I had once voiced these thoughts to Dara, who was always around and always boring unless you took dominance of the conversation. She had rolled her eyes at me as she folded my clothes, all freshly washed and smelling of roses.
The air was cool as Pepper carried my overnight bag to the horse and cart that had parked in front of my home. The coachman, a shy looking Beta, began to climb off his sea as to assists – Pepper dismissed him with a casual shake of the head.
Thor Odinson was born a month earlier than he was supposed to be. Despite this, he weighed 14 ounces. The doctors checked his body three times before confirming that he was indeed Omega.
Frustrated, I decided to look at the books for inspiration.
“Tony, my boy, you’re acting as if I have punctured you with a baton. It was a finger, smile for me.”
“Your brother sounds like quite the trickster.”
“I know you are, I know. But… Things will be hard for you, Thor Odinson. For a long time. But I know you’ll find your place.”
I wished they looked like the mixed wild of Totleigh Manor. Walking through the wooden door was like getting a hug from somebody special and warm. The hearth was fire-full, purring out heat, and it kept the hall in a constantly cosy state.
I would marry James Rhodes, live in my own little cottage and make my own furniture. Not much else could stop me.
I felt like something was wrong. Had I done something wrong? Oh lord, learning a whole new way of thinking was difficult. Natasha and Thor both called out good night to me, and Pepper ushered me out the door.
“You can say that again. Very creative, though.” Natasha added as she walked towards me. “He’s a fast learner.”
“Tell me, Tony, do you like it?” Virginia seemed excited, eyes wide as she watched me. I grinned at her, jumping a little on my bare feet.
“Play and take lessons.”
“You aren’t coming?”
It had been two days after Pepper had been to me and my father had gone to the city once more, my mother out to visit other rich Omegas. There was animosity between my Mother and her so-called Omega friends. Everything was a competition. A competition that my mother was bound to win regardless of the any effort put in by the other Omegas because she was richer and therefore better.
Tony tries to do Thor's past justice. He takes the time to consider his own position in society.
I cry and whine and sob as he continues to jab and roughen me up. He is sweating, too, and he keeps making strange faces, His penis is rubbing up against my thigh, and he finally stops, with one final jab. His crotch feels warmer and I understand now that he had ejaculated.
Not that he had anything to worry about.
I love Aunt Peggy.
I doubted blessing me would save my soul now.
Birthday. Pity for the man driven to drink and death despite having everything.
“Because the privileged have less privileges than the common man sometimes. They speak about you. Your father and his friends and the soldiers he hires. They speak about you like you’re a bag of shiny new coins and it makes me feel sick.”
Still, my ten-year-old brain wondered what life with breasts would be like. The corset was designed for the male body-type and did not come with breast cups. I wriggled the corset down slightly to give easier access to my chest, and pushed the minuscule amount of fat behind my nipples together.
When Thor was a toddler his father bought home a scrawny babe. He hadn’t seen Odin in four months and when man revealed the child, he giggled, petting the dark hair and burbling about being a great sibling.
“Your mother does not decide. It is your father who does, and once I write to him and tell him that I must get to know you personally as to find you the best match, he will not say no. You mother has no influence over what I do, Tony Stark.” Again. The confidence she displayed, in herself, in her beliefs, in what potential lay in our friendship. So much confidence in me, too, not that I understood at that what having confidence in another human meant.
She spoke openly and freely about such things, about such forbidden things.
Two days in the back of a farmer’s cart, covered by fleece and leather and sheep skin. Heimdell told Thor at night about the unrest within the general population.
It was then that Pepper explained to me the plans; she would write to my mother and father about the ‘progress’ I was making, tell them about her search as the Matchmaker of our family for my Alpha. I would write, too, using her advice and her words in order to orchestrate the perfect illusion.
Pepper snorted. “Okay, Natasha, whatever you say.”
endlessly.
She hugged me close, soft and clean-smelling. “Tony, this is just an infatuation.” She whispered carefully in my ear, as if the words she chose had the power to murder me. Alternatively, she could make me see sense; Rhodey had no place in my life. “Pepper Potts is a great woman and she will make sure you have an Alpha who is fair.” She smoothed out my hair.
“Well… What would you like to know?” He sounds genuinely curious but confused at the same time. I walk towards the paved veranda, sheltered from the rain.
And since that whole incident, eating had become particularly hard. And it was all the sun’s fault, really. The sun and it’s red sky.
It was repetitive and bought about a sweet sort of comfort between the two of us. I especially enjoyed the action after he had complimented my intellect, where the squeeze was for something that should, truthfully, have landed me in prison.
I sat on my bed, pouting.
“But I disagree. You are young, and times are changing. In the rural areas, life is so ancient and… and stifling. Your poor mother is a prime example. She sits in that room, knitting and knitting and knitting, until your father comes home. Then she sits on his lap on kneels by his feet whilst he works. It’s just so… static.”
“I do love you, Tony.”
“No. All this came from that.” (Your heart, your genius, you.)
He dumps some first, saying “it’s me, it’s me, it’s always me.”
“It's fine.”
It's a rough start with the Captain, but after one alien invasion, one self-sacrificing flight, and a few months on the road, they find themselves…somewhere. (And slowly getting closer.)
Pepper makes a decision.
“Tony, I can't be the one.”
His things are out of Tiberius’ house by the morning.
“I’m sorry Tony, but I don’t feel…”
If you ask his midnight lovers what he's like they'll say–
It’s a month later when Tony relaxes. When Steve cooks breakfast after his runs, and reminds him to go to bed, and to eat lunch, and to take a shower. When Tony sings for him a little, and lays his head on Steve’s chest and smiles a lot more than he frowns. Steve’s affectionate in a quiet kind of way, with forehead touches and shoulder massages. They still argue, but they learn to communicate better too. And they still bicker of course, but now it’s filled with even more flirting. The team is disgusted.
“You can’t Steve, every fucking person I’ve ever- I don’t-” Tony’s eyes screw shut and he screeches backward in his chair, shrugging off Steve’s hands.
“No, the more I know of you, the more I'm convinced you're a good man hiding behind layers and layers of masks. That you are kind and caring and incredible.”
So when he smells someone else’s cologne on Ty’s neck he shrugs it off. When he catches Ty walking with someone else into a high-class restaurant he let’s it be.
“Weird, like kissing your–”
“Pep–”
“...no Tony, I don't know.” Now he gets Rhodey’s ‘you’re an idiot, but I love you’ look.
Tony is young, stupid, and loves too hard, too fast.
Moments with Rumiko are precious because he knows they’re numbered. When he tells Rhodey this, his best friend points out it was like that with Sunset too. ‘This is different’ Tony says, Rhodey sighs, and the “I know, I’m sorry” goes unspoken.
They sit in a comfortable semi-silence and only go inside when Rumiko starts coughing.
Liam doesn’t look at Tony’s face the whole time, and fidgets with the menu. Tony takes solace in how Liam at leasts looks apologetic.
“But no exceptions right?”
“I can count the number of people who think that on one hand.”
It’s something sort of love-hate, childhood friend and childhood rival.
It’s a month later when he thinks that maybe this time it’s okay to get his hopes up.
“Come on Tones, it’s just a little fun. You’d do the same, wouldn’t you, Tones?”
Tony sputters, chokes, and his hands leave their death grip on the tablecloth to take a sip of water before attempting to speak again. His calming down method doesn’t work.
While Liam was stolen kisses in the lazy afternoon, Sunset is heated makeouts during the edges of the evening. Sunset is wild and exciting, warm and bright and miraculous. She is streaks of red and orange and passionate pinks. She fills up that something missing. and Sunset is supposed to be quick, a beautiful fleeting experience much like her namesake. But Tony falls and falls and falls, never learns his lesson.
Liam gives him the same shy smile from a party months ago. He packs and he goes. Tony finds that knowing how it ends doesn’t soften the blow. (This is a lesson he learns over and over)
“I’m not straight Tony; I’ve been reading about current issues and such in the google.”
Pepper is loving him every step of the way. It isn’t good for her heart.
Tony approaches her, steps quiet. He tucks a strand of her hair behind her ear and they study each other for a bit. Tony’s proud when his voice wavers only a little,
Rumiko he finds in a park.
Pepper leans forward, taps the arc reactor lightly,
“ ...I know.”
“Are those bullet holes?”
Rumiko tells him she’s sick and got months to live.
“All this came from you.” (Your love, your support, you.)
And others dump him, saying “too much of this or not enough of that.”
“If you believe I’m good, we’ll just let each other down. Or, I’ll just let you down.”
Tony is introduced to Tiberius when he’s still young enough that he actually believes his father will someday pay attention to him. The Starks host the Stone family and a 7 year old Tony meets a 6 year old Tiberius.
When Liam invites Tony to eat and says they have to talk, Tony may or may not have called Rhodey to get two beers ready.
“Oh come on, do it for your oldest friend. You've got to live a little Stark, I could definitely help you with that.”
But really, Tony mostly chooses those he’s sure won't kiss and tell.
She’s selfish, but so is he. There’s a team of the best doctors in the world he calls behind her back. Rumiko wants vacations and five star hotels, and all of Tony’s attention. Rumiko gets that and more. Neither of them get a cure.
Rhodey shoots him the pity eyes when they video call, Tony ignores it.
Steve rolls his eyes, but he grips Tony’s hand a little tighter.
“There’s so many fish right?” Sunset says, winking when Tony, (or anyone else,) asks. “Why not try them all?”
“I’m sorry too y’know. For the shit I said, and the shit I give you on the battlefield. And I, I think you’re great too. A good leader, and a good person and… and a good friend.”
Tony knows somewhere in him that this is destined to crash and tries not to get attached. But he falls in love anyway with long fingers strumming on guitar strings, two moles on the back of a neck, quiet sighs and commonplace smiles.
Sunset laughs, full of mirth yet tinged with sadness.
“I truly am sorry, for all those words I said when we met. You do have a pretty big ego, I admit, but you’re intelligent, and kind, and you learn from your mistakes. You fix things, and you pay attention to things, and you make incredible inventions.”
An eye roll and something that’s part laugh, part sigh, part huff. “Will that be all Mr. Stark?”
“Ty-Tiberius, don’t call me that anymore.”
“It's been a wonderful time, Darling.”
“You’re dating me honey, anything you want to do, we’ll do it.”
“I know. I’m sorry.”
From there, they continue to sleep in the same bed, and go out on things like dates, and Tony realizes Ty is sort of courting him. He resists at first, ignoring the five star hotel reservations, and declining the cars and flowers and chocolate. But Ty has always been charming, and Tony succumbs to his loneliness. He wants to love again, wants something warm to hold onto, if only for a moment. So they sleep together; The panting,  flush skin, eyes screwed tight, and lips biting kind of ‘slept together’.
“How ‘bout it Stark? It’ll be fun.”
Liam can kiss and dance under the covers, but it will never be the romantic attraction Tony has. It will never be as intense. It will never be love.
“Steve,” Tony amends, smiling. “Of course I’ll date you. I wouldn’t dare to disappoint our country by saying no to the golden boy.”
Tony looks into Steve’s eyes and smiles wider, maybe a little cheeky. “Maybe a good boyfriend too.”
“You've been going on dates with Captain America?”
Tony scoffs, “They're not-dates Rhodey bear, not ‘not-a-date’ and not, y’know dates.”
They'll tell you he's every bit as good and even better in bed than everyone says.
“Wait, I-”
“Yeah? Well I’ll make one more and convince everyone else I’m right.”
Tony attempts a scoff but it comes out more like a saddened sigh.
(When Rhodey comes over they drink beer, shit talk celebrities and pointedly do not mention the Chardonnay on the kitchen table. )
“I know you know it’s not called ‘The Google.’”
“Ty… Ugh, what?” Tony sits up rubbing sleep out of his eyes and Ty’s laugh is low and rumbly. Tony can feel it from where one of his arms is on Ty’s chest.
“I just.” Steve stops for a moment before he leans forward and takes Tony’s hand. “I just think you’re great Tony, and I like going out with you. And I wouldn’t mind actually going out with you. Making this official.”
“I feel like I won’t really know unless I try. I mean, I am attracted to Tom Cruise a little but who isn’t right?”
“I really am sorry.”
That sort of breaks both of their hearts.
That his hands are calloused and rough but his touches soft. That he sweet talks and dirty talks in equal measure. That he's a pleaser not a taker. That he is heated and warm and moving one moment and slow and tender the next.
It's classy, (of course) the way she leaves. It’s been exactly three months, and Sunset wakes him up with a kiss to his forehead. They eat smoked salmon, fresh fruit, and costly coffee for brunch. They talk of everything and nothing while Tony tries to memorize every inflection in her voice and every detail on her face and wishes, for the first time, that he was an artist or a poet. They finish much too early and she kisses him quick on the cheek.
Interlude
Tony takes him to the park, to museums, to ten different bookstores, and to anywhere else Steve wants to go. Tony offers him companionship and a place to sleep, hard-to-break punching bags and someone to talk to in the too-early morning. Tony listens to Steve’s thoughts on the future and ignores the feeling growing in his chest.
Tiberius pulls the old friends thing, saying remember this, or recall that? Tiberius glorifies halcyon days of no worries and living parents. Tony downs every drink he’s handed. He tells Ty he’s not interested in dating or relationships right now. Ty winks.
“How's it been Rhodey-bear?”
“I don’t know what happened to make you believe that, whether it was the constant limelight, or past relationships, but Tony,” Steve exhales and lets go of the napkin, running a hand through his hair before continuing, “These have been dates, haven’t they?”
“Pepper, light of my life?”
It’s a meet cute, he’s walking Rhodey’s mother’s dog, a cute little Yorkie that jumps onto Rumiko’s bench the moment he sees her. They strike up a witty conversation, and Tony finds himself admiring her diction, then her ideas, and then her mouth and bright eyes. Rumiko laughs at him, covering her mouth with her hand, and they agree on coffee the next morning. They walk around the park on Sundays and Tony kisses her first underneath the arch tanks in the New York Aquarium.
They meet at a party. Tony doesn’t even remember the host or the event but he can recall the flashing purple lights on Liam’s face. He can think of a gleam of white teeth and endearingly crinkled green eyes.
They grow up like this, fighting over toys, then cars, then girls, and a myriad of other material things. Tony will never say that he actually sort of liked it, that it was some sort of normalcy, a steady constant that was exactly the same through the years.
There are the in-betweens of course. A week long love here and a couple day romance there, twinges in his chest and cracks in his heart.
Except this isn’t a romcom, this is a tragedy.
(Pepper cares and gives him the validation he craves. Self-depreciated)
Sunset Bain buys him a drink at a high end bar somewhere in Malibu and asks him to dance. Tony refuses at first, but after another drink and the scent of strawberry-vanilla hair, he’s swinging her around and listening to a tinkling laugh and music full of bass.
The moment Virginia “Pepper” Potts walks out of the room, head held high and heels clacking away, Tony knows she's going to break his heart somehow.
The next-to-last thing she says to Tony is, “Ha, I’m too pretty to die like this” Tony offers up a weak chuckle, tells her he loves her. Her responding smile is a dulled and softer version of the one she gave him months ago.
Peggy squinted at Steve’s work, leaned in a bit then patted Steve on the back. “I don’t think so,” she said, a playful smile ghosting her lips.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you,” He said, rubbing the back of his neck.
on the side of the Tupperware, Steve found himself smiling.
Tony gave smiled, not bothered at the fact that he was practically begging for war against someone twice his size. But this is Tony, life’s nothing when there’s no thrill in it.
As he fixed the kitchen, Steve’s eyes travelled back towards the fridge. His eyes stayed firm on the glossy exterior of the fridge and suddenly he found himself with a piece of paper in hand, a pen on the other, and the pen’s cap in between his teeth.
Steve definitely didn’t missed this one.
In response to the bizarre idea, Thor laughed. “That seems exciting,” he said.
Steve stared at Bruce, reassuring if what Tony said was true. “What he said,” he replied taking a sip of his tea.
Thor immediately stilled, his cup of coffee (which suspiciously looks more like milk) a few inches away from his mouth. He was silent for a moment. “Not by blood, no,” he finally answered. “He’s the son of one our family’s rival, I am not aware of the entire story, but… nonetheless, he’s still my brother.”
Steve opened his mouth, then closed it, before opening it again. “Cap?”
“No I wouldn’t” The boy said disinterested. “I would be a god, and the villain of the story.”
“No shit Sherlock,” Tony replied as he fumbled with the DVD player that he brought, insisting that if they use Clint’s monstrosity again he’ll commit suicide. “We seriously need a smart TV, is the owner even aware about Netflix?” He added as he jammed the cable a little too harshly.
Steve blinked and readjusted his messenger bag. He was halfway towards his next class when Thor’s words registered inside his head. Steve frantically turned around, as if he was expecting to see Thor’s blond head against the see of heads, his eyebrows raised.
Tony watched him walk down the hall until he disappeared into his room. As soon as he was out of his sight, Tony whipped out his phone and contacted Pepper. She picked up on the first ring.
“If I don’t get an answer in ten seconds, because hello, college student, I still have a class to catch, we’re watching Titanic.”
“Now I’m good with Science, and Math—let’s not forget Math—so if you think I’m hanging out with you because of something else—probably connected to the missing mirror in our bathroom—stop it immediately, because you can’t possibly think that Clint can appreciate my wisdom.”
boxers before registering the situation. “Hey, this is mine,” He said before grabbing it from Steve’s hold, then the situation registered even more.
“Unhand me!” He immediately screeched.
Thor shrugged. “I know, there was a period where I wanted to change my name to Donald Blake.”
“Wait, you said it was a hearing aid, right?” Jane asked readjusting the sling bag on her shoulder as she tried to get comfortable sitting on the sidewalk.
Thor thought back to his lonely lunch hours, the always busy students, Loki’s unresponsive behavior, and finally, the unanswered notes. That got him thinking at the weird place he was living in and the strangers that reside with him.
Clint frowned “Wow, imaginative,” he threw a wrapper at the kid. “Will you stop being a dick for a moment,” he said. “Or I swear that will be your last burger, ever.”
Though Thor’s note looks more like it was addressed to everyone.
He wasn’t that much of an asshole when he was a kid, right? Barney maybe, but he was pretty sure he didn’t reach this level. Or maybe they both did but they didn’t notice.
The kid’s in rehab for a reason.
“The feeling’s not mutual,” Clint told Tony before turning to face everyone. “What the hell was that?”
“Clint won’t shut up about a peephole.”
Steve twisted from his seat and stared at his professor. A streak of yellow paint was on his left cheek, a few splotches of red, violet, and blue above his left eye and his hands were a mess of colors. For once, Steve wasn’t having a hard time painting something new, and he didn’t know whether to feel bad or not about that small fact.
Thor stopped walking and watched the passing cars before staring at his feet. What was he even doing here? He never found out why. Okay, fine, maybe he does know, but he couldn’t wrap his head why his father would go as far as send him here. And he’s not even sure what it is that he’s supposed to do.
Putting both her hands inside her pockets, Natasha made a beeline towards the front door and left for class, unaware that she was somewhat smiling.
Steve wears earplugs in his sleep.
Everyone was standing still, their eyes still locked on the closed bathroom door. Then Natasha suddenly turned and left as she climbed up to the second floor.
Clint frowned at him. “I got you your stupid Back To The Future that you’ve been bitching about,” he said. “So now, it’s your turn to put a peephole on the door.”
It’s not that Steve needs to have sessions like hers, in her opinion therapy’s a stupid waste of time and money, but the guy is weird. As if he won’t get a grasp on what’s going on, like he can’t catch up or something.
But was replied with a shake of his head.
He didn’t reply.
“Oh poor Thor, poor older brother of mine!” He yelled turning to the view of the city before standing up and taking a step away from the edge, turning to stare at Bruce. Well, at least he was away from the edge“Did he forget to mention the mayhem he caused last year? Where it went too far he had to go to court? God, he’s so full with himself, all I ever sought was an equal, and he just couldn’t turn his head to look. He’s the one with the problems, and yet I’m still the freak! I’m still the disappointment! So stop defending him!”
“Even Steve and Thor combined, they still had a hard time calming Bruce,” Natasha informed in a flat voice. “If it’s your turn and Bruce got out of his chains, who knows what will happen. Wanna test it out ? I have a key.”
Jane sighed.
They all got home with the sun peeking from the sky, everyone was exhausted and Bruce was already planning to spend the whole weekend in bed. They invited Pepper to rest, but she was more adamant to rest at her place, and mentioning something about the fact that she can’t promise to not kick Tony when she sees him.
“Remember the night you punched a hole on the wall?” she said flatly after leaning on the fridge.
No one asked, and Bruce found himself deciding to not ask  why he was with Loki in the first place. Maybe it wasn’t an important question, to begin with, Clint used to be in Loki’s position, maybe he found a common ground.
“Which was also totally Steve’s fault!” Clint exclaimed.
Bruce concluded.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha raised an eyebrow from her place on the couch when Clint entered the building with a scream of victory. Tony, who was making himself some coffee by the kitchen, stared at him as if he’s got an alien parasite leeching on his back.
The boy didn’t bother saying anything.
Blinking again, Bruce looked up and was face to face with the biggest man he’d ever seen, other than wrestlers in WWE—
Taking a few calculating steps backward, Bruce cautiously grabbed a book from the shelf—none of it was his, leaving him to believe that Tony owned way too much, and slowly made his way towards the unidentified organism. Then again, it could probably be a cat burglar—not that that sounded better.
Natasha’s eyes narrowed. "It’s a figure of speech.”
“Right, sooooo…” Tony said. “Thanks?” He mentally winced.
Steve sighed, his shoulder slumping. “Well, I know, but I’m not really familiar with the song.”
Natasha turned and stared at the big blonde guy standing at the bathroom door. She furrowed her eyebrows at him as she turned off the faucet and dried her hands on the towel hanging by the side.
She was even more surprised when he actually started attending classes at SHEILD, even more, when she realized he was using a fake name.
Edit: Yow, to those who already read this part, I may have forgotten to add a very important fact in this chapter and that I decided to change a few things because i did some research and I think taking Masters Degree works differently, so it would really be nice if you'll reread it.
Steve blinked, too much to be considered as normal, before dropping his gaze to study his nails. “I guess I just missed it.”
Thor blinked as Clint adjusted his seat and continued watching.
“Maybe next time you shouldn’t leave used underwear lying around,” Steve replied sharply.
Jane laughed and waved before she left.
“D-don’t you think ‘bombarding’ is a bit, I don’t know…” Bruce said rubbing his nape, “Exaggerated?”
“Hey, it’s not your fault you’re bigger than most humans,” The brunette said.
Thor smiled and Steve wondered how his mouth was able to show all his teeth on one smile. Steve could practically see the gums sticking out. “I look forward to the next one,” He declared slapping a friendly hand on Steve’s shoulder before leaving. “See you around!”
Clint snorted and opened the fridge, true to his words, there were leftover spaghetti. Glancing at the notes taped on the fridge, he couldn’t help but notice that he and Tony are not the only ones good at changing topics.
Bruce rummaged through the cabinets, aware of the voices from the living room, and of Natasha’s presence near him. As soon as he found the water boiler Tony had bought a few days ago, he straightened up and proceeded to fill it with water.
Bruce nodded while, oddly, but not surprising, starts singing the national anthem inside his head.
Clint came out from the bathroom a few minutes after Tony left. He gave Bruce a nod, acknowledging him, along with a face that says ‘Why are you still standing there?’ before climbing up the stairs.
Natasha’s brows furrowed. She tilted her head and studied Steve, then glanced around the room before settling her eyes back at him. Apparently, one of them would still rather spend the evening alone in their room.
And as stupid as it sounds, Bruce thinks that Tony’s a vampire, either that or Tony have a very strange sleep and eating pattern.
Bruce said the fifth time Tony asked him about his milk carton), Bruce found himself quite giddy with the prospect of having another human being joining their…complex? Apartment? Dorm? Whatever.
He couldn’t really say that he and Tony were in friendly terms, more like if-I-see-you-then-I-see-you-but-we-don’t-talk-like-we’re-friends kind of relationship. They barely see each other, but it was still something. Unlike the other two, who were starting to look like real ghosts, at least he could still see Tony.
Bruce sighed and turned to Thor. “It
“How about the others? Have you talked to them, made any friends?”
“Right,” Clint said. “Clearly you did a good job at fooling me.”
Steve blinked, which he realized he has been doing a lot lately, and turned to look at Peggy before looking back at his painting.
Not that he wasn’t expecting it, he knew the guy was bound to complain about it and it wasn’t that hard to figure out he was the culprit (The nameless lady doesn’t seem like the type to steal food—or to actually participate with anything), but that was just grade A skills with changing topics.
Tony slowly tried checking for his wallet.
But she didn’t answer, for the rest of the session she kept her mouth shut.
But the annoying voice inside his head keeps telling him that maybe it wasn’t because of the bathroom incident. The ugly huge scars that cover most of Tony’s chest suddenly flashed inside Steve’s mind. He sighed.
“Are you really that desperate?”
But nobody knocked on Tony’s door. Clint could already see the sun shining through his window and his bed was still vibrating. Granted, his room was next to Tony’s, and therefore the only one who can feel the vibration, but what about the noise?
That feeling when you feel like you’ve timed travel into the future and everything you once knew had changed, and now you’re stuck in that timeline that no matter how hard you try to keep up it felt as if you’re falling backwards instead. That’s basically Steve’s life, everyday.
Natasha glanced at the empty-noted fridge and did her best to suppress a frown.
Bruce stood by the threshold, with a bloody fist covered in splinters, his whole frame shaking all over Natasha could see it from where she was standing, looking like hell.
Natasha stared at him.
When Clint didn’t receive any response other than a very long, very weird stare, he glanced around awkwardly before staring back at Bruce.
Tony must have stayed silent longer than necessary because Bruce started to backtrack. “But it’s okay if not, I mean,” he gestured at Tony’s disorganized belongings that covers the whole table. “Yeah, sure, see you around.”
“It’s nothing,” Bruce said, “By the way, thanks for the coffee.” And he took another sip.
“Where is this heading?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sunset leaves him with pieces of his heart on the floor, a bottle of expensive Chardonnay, and the smell of strawberry and vanilla lingering in his sheets.
He’s content with Ty, and though it’s not love that drives them into the other’s arms, it’s something Tony can live with.
He doesn’t cry at the funeral, he cries when he drinks with Rhodey and sees one of her yellow headbands on the counter.
Tony tells her he loves her.
“That was so–”
A laugh, a wink. “You're giving me some mixed signals here Pep.”
“Steve-I-Why-Wha-”
Ty’s tone turns flippant and Tony’s eyes are hard.
It's on one of those not-dates where Steve goes quiet and sort of stares at Tony. It’s an intense look, Steve brow furrows slightly and he gets that little twitch down on one side of his lips and his eyes are shining; ocean, sky, crystal blue,  and Tony just-. Tony sets his sandwich down.
“The Silver Platter?”
“Don’t worry, I know”
They pick slowly at their food, and Tony tries not to think about how this is the place they ate their first real meal together. He ignores the memory of Liam’s winsome smile, and the way his voice sounded when he suggested they go out again.
It’s all over the tabloids the next day, that Tony Stark is Sunset’s new 3 month relationship. It’s a thing she does, dates someone for 3 months, no more, no less, no exceptions. (Last month it was a Calvin Klein model, and before that a pretty doctor from France.)
They smile at each other again and Tony thinks, this is a love, this is a love that no one can take from me.
Steve doesn’t respond for a moment, gathering his thoughts as he grips the napkin in his hand tightly.
“Please, you’re a moping alcoholic covering up your issues with one night stands and extravagant parties. I know, I’ve been there.”
(Pepper is crying as she watches him fall down, down, down)
Steve cheeks grow pink and Tony laughs, leaning in. Steve meets him halfway.
“To the park, where we met.”
Interlude
Every time after that Rhodey gets a kiss on each cheek and a,
Tony understands. Pepper needs someone stable, someone to lend her an ear when she complains about him, someone less busy than her, someone to give her all the time in the day. (Pepper needs someone better.)
“They’re not, They’re not dates. Besides, aren’t you like-” He pauses to gesticulate to all of Steve.
“I live well enough Ty.”
They fall into bed and go for brunch the next day. They visit the beach and kiss undercover from the sun. They run from paparazzi and laugh in the rain. It’s like some tv drama, and the days go by as fast as a montage would.
“We were here for brunch that one time, remember?”
“Steve-”
“I'm sort of experimenting. Y’know what I mean, right Stark?”
A soft caress of her face and a brow furrowed slightly. “Yes, that will be all, Ms. Potts.”
And then Pepper has her hand in his chest, Pepper is waiting for him, hoping, Pepper is being kidnapped, Pepper is saving him as he saves her, Pepper has her heart in her throat and her hands clenched, knuckles white as she sees him fly up, up, up.
