Something sinks in Dean’s stomach. “Oh,” he whispers, the horror of it beginning to sink in. “That—that was you.”
“I don’t know. Maybe the healing process is just painful? I’m sorry, Dean,” he whispered, tilting his gaze down to his shoes, “I wish I knew more but I don’t.”
happy about it. He whined and tried swiveling back around, even grabbing and twisting fistfuls of Dean’s sweatpants in frustration, but Dean wouldn’t give him an inch.
and drunkenly slurred back
“I—me too, Cas,” he stammers, blinking furiously. He can’t stop looking at Cas’s face, how utterly radiant he looks with that soft little smile of his, and he’s suddenly hit with the urge to kiss it away. He blinks.
Dean took the salt, flicking the shaker over the pot a couple times. "Thanks, babe. And, um, same here. Nothing too interesting. In fact, I, uh, saw one case that's basically just a textbook haunting. So easy I could probably do it myself." The last sentence was rushed, exhaled, and Dean could feel Cas physically tense up next to him.
"Hey, buddy. What's up?" Cas looked up at Dean, quiet and still, before worming his way under Dean's arm and dropping his head in his lap. Exhaling a small sigh, he closed his eyes and curled his knees up closer to his chest, body draped half on the seat and half on Dean.
Cas didn't respond, just kept shaking in Dean's lap.
“Not… not stupid shit if it kept you safe. I’d d-do it again if I had to.”
"I think Jack woke up. I'm gonna go make him a bottle, 'kay?"
"No. I barely said anything at all, actually. I should've stopped him though. I could tell he was starting to get upset, I shoulda said something as soon as I noticed, I shoulda done more to st—"

crayon, then? Jesus kid," Dean huffed, "I ain't that much of an artist."
“Alright, follow me.” Sam gave them a reassuring smile and walked towards the couple of concrete steps preceding a large entryway. The floor turned to smooth, shiny hardwood as they crossed into an even larger room, adorned with hanging lights and symmetrical white pillars. The brick walls were lined with shelves of books, and the middle of the room was occupied by a set of long, rectangular tables, the same deep mahogany as many of the bookshelves. Each table was outfitted with a little lamp and rounded wooden chairs, and the whole room was illuminated by warm light, a sharp contrast to the room they had just been in. The library felt much cozier, much less… industrial. Something about that other room just didn’t sit quite right with Erin; this place felt much, much better.
Dean knew what agony sounded like. After his decades in Hell, tortured and torturing on the racks, he'd heard just about every single pained noise possible and then some. He knew what it sounded like when you choked someone with their own intestines. He knew the noises a person made when you sliced into their body with their own sharpened rib, splitting their skin slowly, deliciously. He was very well acquainted with the sounds of suffering.
"Yeah, 'course. Scoot over." Cas smiled and rolled himself over to the other side, allowing Dean to plop down next to him. He sat leaning against the headboard, hand still held captive by Cas, who was drowsily tracing his palm.
unnatural and contorted were broken beyond repair. Not to mention the fucking

“Um, Dean?” Cas suddenly scrunched his eyebrows together, pursing his lips in adorable confusion.
—" Dean couldn't stop the sob that exploded from his chest as he watched Cas's labored breaths get shallower and shallower. "I love you," he said helplessly. "I
plan I've ever heard. Cas is gonna end you." Dean blinked at Jasmine, vision blurring towards the edges. "And torture me all you want, I can guarantee he's not gonna give you the nephil." He'd rather die than let Jack get taken, and he knew Cas felt the same way.
“I don’t know if that’s a good idea. I couldn’t ask Dean to leave his home, not now that he’s finally found somewhere to settle. He would never ever leave Sam, either. I know he loves Jack but I wouldn’t want him to feel obligated to parent him. He already holds himself accountable for so much, he doesn’t need to feel responsible for Jack as well. Dean didn’t ask for a baby. I knew what I was getting into when I took Jack, but Dean was never supposed to get involved. He didn’t even want me to agree to help Jack, before he was born. He loves him now, of course, but I know he never wanted this.”
"C'mon, Cas. You gotta wake up, Rowena's here and she might have something to help us. I wanna get you better but we can't if you don't get out of bed, okay?" He kept running his fingers through Cas's hair, stopping when he huffed against his shoulder with a grumpy hum.
"Buddy, it's way easier to sleep in the dark. I'm not gonna be able to sleep with the light on." Dean bit his lip. "Are you scared? Of the dark? 'Cuz I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right next to you the whole time."
"Dean! I finished the bowl." Jack stood triumphantly next to a full plate of stacked pancakes, chocolate chips melting on each other.
"You have to remember I'm a witch, Dean. Not an angel, not a deity. A very powerful witch, yes, but ultimately still just a woman with a knack for magic. You can't expect me to venture into utterly uncharted territory and not have a few wee accidents, aye?"
Something in his voice squeezed around Erin's heart, made her throat close up, induced a prickling sensation behind her eyelids.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dee, Dee, no,” he whined, shaking his head and tickling the underside of Dean's jaw. “Dee, Dee.”
Sam cleared his throat. "Um, I'm gonna leave now if you don't have any more questions. Maybe try to keep Cas from screaming again?"
"Cas? Are—are you okay?"
Of course, none of that will matter if everything goes according to plan. Dean will have no need for a bloody facsimile because he’ll have the real thing back. It’s just the niggling voice that keeps saying
Dean picks the beer back up, because he’s not drunk enough for this conversation. Not even close. Sam sighs, long and exhausted.
A few beats passed. “You don’t need to apologize.” Another beat. “And you’re wrong. I value your opinion of me very highly.” Castiel finally turned to face Erin, wearing a shy smile. “Thank you, Erin. Your words mean a great deal to me and I feel lucky to know you as well. I look forward to our conversations every time I come into town.”
"Mm, Dee, no. No no no, Dee," he stuttered into Dean's ear as he turned his face away, like a child stubbornly refusing to eat their peas and carrots. Rowena dropped her hand in shock.
Dean exhaled in relief. He didn't want Cas wasting his grace on him, he wasn't worth it. As that thought crossed his mind, Cas stopped rubbing his face against Dean's collarbone and looked up at him, growling. He grabbed Dean's face like he had earlier and Dean felt that same warm, hug-like sensation rush through him. All thoughts of worthlessness and self-loathing dissipated from his mind.
still do. You’re supposed to teach me more things and show me more movies and tell me more stories. You have to stay with me, you
"You're right. I
"Hey, I'm not mad, I promise," Dean said gently, trying to soothe Cas. "You'd be able to feel if I was, remember? You could tell how I felt yesterday. You gotta feel now that I'm not upset." He poked where Cas had his wrist in a death grip, extending a pinky like he had last night. Cas immediately let go and latched onto the finger instead, humming and sniffling a bit.
Jack opened the door a bit wider so he could poke his head in and smiled. “Hi, Dean. I just wanted to say goodnight and check on Cas. Is he doing any better?”
"Hey, sunshine," Dean said quietly, gently running his fingers through Cas's hair. He hoped he found the sensation grounding; Dean didn't want Cas waking up startled or disoriented. He might not be able to soothe him with grace but this was about the closest substitute he could offer.
Dean pauses, breathes in and out. He’s scared—he’s always scared, he’s never stopped being scared, not since he was four years old—but he knows in his heart that Cas will say yes. He knows it.
Erin nodded and stepped forward, bending down to gently pry a burbling Jack out of Cas’s arms. He whined as she pulled him away, but it was more annoyed than sad, and he quickly relaxed back into the carrier. “Thank you, honey,” she said quietly, patting the top of his head. Jack responded with a happy little nonsense noise, and Dean gave her a grateful look.
"Hey, angel, c'mere and try this. I'm usin' a new recipe but I think you'll like it." A few seconds later, Cas rounded the corner from the living room and snuck up on Dean from behind. He wrapped his arms around his waist and hooked his chin on his shoulder, sagging against Dean's back.
i would love for y’all to give me feedback on it!! anyways enough w the self plug lmao pls enjoy the chapter
“Okay, okay, we gotta get you to cool down,” Dean murmured, delicately touching the back of his hand to Cas’s forehead. Yeah, his temperature was
Cas is looking at him a bit like he just grew a third eye, but he nods nonetheless, still cupping his probably bruised nose. Dean winces in sympathy. Oops.
. Were all of Castiel’s friends marred by tragedy? Again, Erin realized she probably didn’t want to know the answer to that question.
to leave Dean. It physically pained him to be away. There was nothing in the world he wanted more than to be at Dean’s side, always, but he knew this was for the best. "It's better for me to stay away, where no one else gets hurt. And—and it will make it easier."
four times before letting go, leaving him to collapse on the floor, limp and pliant. He lies there for a second, knowing Dean isn’t finished, and manifests his blade so just the tip is exposed, peeking out of his sleeve. It glints in front of his wrist, only minimally obscured by his hand, practically offering itself to Dean.
Dean thinks hopelessly. God help him, Cas still smells like Cas.
"And… you're not mad?"
happy late cas day!!!!!
"He might just not have a total grasp on his grace yet. I'm sure existing in the Empty was exhausting, as well as your escape from the Empty, and if Cas was too tired to suppress his vessel's need to rest, he would probably fall asleep to recuperate. I'm not sure what exactly his true form would've been doing during that time, though."
Familiar energy flowed through Dean, thrumming under his skin. Everything began to dampen. He was surrounded by softness, held,
” she sang quietly, pressing her cheek to the top of Jack’s fluffy head, “
"I don't know what's worse—Dean not checking in because he just wants to hurt me that badly, or because he's been… incapacitated." Cas ducked his head and fixed his gaze on the rug beneath their feet. Erin could see him biting his lip nervously, and once again she couldn't help but give into the impulse to hug him.
And fuck if
Erin stopped and waited, unsure of whether Castiel would respond. She forgot she was still holding his forearm and loosened her grip, mildly embarrassed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to force you to stay. I just thought you should know.”
Dead silence. Erin had felt every single one of those words pierce her heart like a bullet; she couldn’t even imagine how Cas must be feeling. ‘Devastated’ probably barely even scratched the surface.
For a second, Erin wondered what the hell Castiel did for a living before deciding maybe she was better off not knowing. “It wasn’t explicitly romantic, and no matter what I say, Dean will have a hard time believing what I feel is legitimate. So I don’t really know what he thinks.”
Again, Jasmine frowned deeply, like it was out of both unhappiness and intense concentration. Jack gurgled, growing sleepy in the carrier.
Dean ran his fingers over Cas’s back and felt two slight protrusions near his shoulder blades. Something soft was lightly poking out of the rips in the cloth, and Cas shivered as Dean lifted up the shirt to investigate.
“Uh, yeah, you too, thanks,” he mumbled, not meeting Erin’s eyes before grabbing the cup and quickly exiting. Her smile grew even wider. A buzz emanated from her pocket.
he whispered urgently. "I
Dean relived Cas's memories from his perspective; some of them he remembered himself, some he didn't. He saw himself raking leaves in Cicero. His soul was muted and fuzzy, everything muffled behind a layer of gray. He saw himself sleeping, the reds and purples of fear throttling him. He as Cas touched his unconscious forehead, the white-blue of his grace battling back the nightmares bringing darkness to Dean's dreams. His soul clung to the soothing grace as it dissipated, and Dean (Cas) felt a pang of affection as well as sorrow.
is something SO personal SO brain worms inducing. absolutely seared into my brain. truly one of thee most insane episodes like the horny energy b/w them in that room? unmatched!!! they rly had dean knock over a statue of an angel, LITERALLY making it fall, then panned the camera to cas immediately after!! minutes later cas deadass created free will for the entire universe bc he fell in love w a man oh my god!!! and then he fucking DIES!!! i hate this show omfg… anyways!!!! sorry for that lol but i hope yall enjoyed the chapter!!! comments are v much appreciated, if u have any feedback pls lmk bc i haven’t fully written the story yet so i’d love to hear if yall have any opinions abt the direction this should take :)
Remembering how upset Cas had been when he didn't immediately take the shirt offering, Dean realized Cas had probably been asking him to share his nest. His heart sank; no wonder Cas acted so devastated and scared. He didn't want to be rejected.

"I don't know what makes you think you have the power in this situation, but you don't. I have your boy toy, and you're, like, Angel Lite right now. Diet Seraph. Running with less than a mile left in the tank, my guy. I can literally see your grace, your fucked up trueform, and it's
“Holy—” Erin’s words caught in her throat as Cas’s entire body was enveloped in soft blue light. Jack had his eyes squeezed closed, whining quietly, but his hand stayed still against Cas. A hint of color returned to his face, and the gashes on his back stopped bleeding; not completely healing like Dean’s injuries had, but definitely much better than before, the edges cleaned up and the torn skin a little less ragged. Jack removed his hand with a coo and sat back against Erin, smiling for the first time that entire day. A few seconds later, Cas’s eyes flew open, shining electric blue. He jolted up in Dean’s lap and gasped, clutching at him weakly.
from his perspective 'cause he wanted to show me what my soul looked like." He tilted his head towards the floor, away from their faces.
you, goddammit, you
"Okay, Dean," Jack said softly. "Thanks for explaining." He eyed Dean uneasily for a second, fiddling with his hands.
“So what—what does that mean, Cas? Do you still have your Grace, your wings?” Dean’s eyes widen. “Holy shit, did I see your true form? Earlier? Was that what that little spinny ball thing was?”
And dammit, Dean is
"It's Cas. He's having some… issues." Sam opened the door and froze, taking in the disastrous room before looking at Dean, still sitting on the bed, and exploding into laughter.
She let Cas keep talking though, making a mental note to come back to it later.
skin, fitting itself to the body forming right in front of him. Shadows mold into features and the last thing to come together are his eyes, blank and milky white until those electric blue wisps of a star dissolve into his face, absorbed into his skin, flashing as they concentrate into irises.
“Cas,” he starts, and his breath catches because he can feel the energy thrumming in the pads of Cas’s fingers. He can see something more in the blue of his eyes, something even more than Grace, than angel, and he’s not scared but he doesn’t understand.
“Thanks, Dean.”
"Alright y'all, here's your order." The waitress interrupted their conversation as she returned with plates of fresh food, setting them down on the table with an impressive amount of grace. "Salad for you, darlin," placing the dish in front of Sam, "chicken for this handsome young man," winking at Jack, "and a burger for the guy with the cute kid," turning towards Dean last. She spotted Cas dozing on his lap and smiled, eyes crinkling at the edges.
but Cas is different. Really special. How could you tell he's an angel?" Dean groaned internally.
“I… was just reminded of some old times, the beginning of a friendship with someone very important to me. He was the first person to ever give me a nickname." Castiel paused, and his face darkened ever so slightly. “Well, the first nickname that wasn't derogatory, anyways. I have many siblings.” Erin nodded knowingly. She had an older brother who was kind of a dick.
"Shh, it's okay, baby," Dean whispered, scooping him up and out of the crib. "I got you, gonna make it better, 'kay? Everything's okay." He let one of the blankets rest on his shoulder, acting as a pillow for Jack. Cradling his head against his upper chest, Dean held Jack close, lightly bouncing him as they moved towards the kitchen.
of all places? It was simply unfathomable to Dean. He knew it was real; he felt how Cas felt in that moment, but he just couldn't understand why. It made him feel so small, knowing the sheer magnitude of Cas's love. Not only that, but the knowledge that Cas had been in love for twelve fucking years without saying anything had Dean feeling
Fuck. Dean could quite literally feel his heart getting ripped out of his chest and torn to shreds.
He should've taken it off before getting the tub.
The easy thing to do
"Alright sunshine, she's gone. No need to hide." Dean couldn't help thinking how bizarre it was, seeing Cas hiding behind
******
“Yes,” Cas whispers. He sniffles and repeats. “Yes, yes please, yes, Dean, of course I’ll marry you—” And he’s sobbing again, forehead against Dean’s sternum, and there’s a warmth spreading through Dean’s whole body. “I love you, I love you so much, nothing would make me happier—”
have found that as sexy as he did, but god
Dean’s eyebrows scrunched, and when he turned around to look at them, it was as though he’d temporarily forgotten that Erin and Jasmine even existed. “Oh, the one holding Jack is Jasmine. Jack resurrected her after she got killed as a demon’s host. We’re takin’ care of her for right now. The other one’s Erin.” Erin waved awkwardly at the man—Sam?—, who simply stared.

Huh. The lyrics jarred Dean for a second, and he stilled. Jack's laugh still rang out in the background.
on his lap? Holy
The conversation paused as Jack started to wiggle in Castiel’s grip, making grabby hands at Erin. She was secretly delighted when Castiel dropped a kiss on the top of the baby’s feathery, blond head and extended his arms towards her, silently offering to let Erin hold Jack. Beaming, she accepted the baby and hooked her hands under his arms so he could stand on her lap. Erin cooed and Jack responded with a giggle, bouncing his legs up and down excitedly. Damn, he was one adorable motherfucker.
“Yeah, sunshine.” He slowly walked them back to the bed, setting Cas down in his little circle of towels. He still wouldn’t let go of Dean. “We were taking a nap, remember? You just had a bad dream.”
Erin grinned.
He hears the
About half the formula was gone by the time Jack's eyelids started drooping, finally growing sleepy again. Dean took the bottle and started rocking him, humming some indistinct tune. Slowly making his way out of the kitchen, he spoke to Jack quietly, knowing he generally found his voice soothing.
“He's sick so I want to do something nice for him, and I think he likes this place.” He blushed fiercely.
A knock on the door jolted Dean out of his thoughts. “Dean? It’s Jack.”
“So, basically what you’re saying is he’s a grumpy intolerable little shit until he gets his daily caffeine fix?”
Well then. Dean honestly felt a little sick to his stomach, a little light-headed. "Jesus fuck," he breathed, sounding mildly hysterical, "all those years and you
“Ugh, Jack, you
did Cas just promise to stay?
Then Dean felt Cas stiffen, back straightening unnaturally, shoulders tensing. The air buzzed, crackling with electric tension.
"Can't," Cas whimpered, so quiet Dean barely caught it. His hand froze and he bent down closer to Cas's face.
Castiel was rising slowly from his chair, suddenly looking very worn out, when it dawned on Erin that he hadn’t bought anything.
“Say it again,” he chokes out, because he’s nothing if not insecure.
Oh yeah, because those are definitely normal thoughts for someone to have on the daily. Erin doesn't know why she's surprised anymore.
. This took the fucking cake. She focused on Jack now asleep in her arms, trying to push down the lump that had been stubbornly rising in her throat.
"... Dean?"
"He's alive, don't worry." Jack's voice cut through the otherwise total silence in the room. "I can see him, he's just resting for a second."
hands are the ones that made the thing is good enough for me. Besides," Dean added, grinning, "I think it's kinda cute you like using my crap."
“Uh, is something wrong with Cas?” Jack nodded wordlessly, still fixed on Cas’s shaking body. He sucked in a breath before looking at Dean.
“Look, I can’t say I disagree. Cas deserves better, but he
Erin pursed her lips; what the hell is she supposed to say to
hey guys!!! this is literally just 2k of pure fluff lmao but i hope yall enjoy <3
Again, Castiel just goes ahead saying whatever the fuck he wants, like these are normal things to be telling a barista first thing in the morning. Erin wondered, not for the first time, if she was in some kind of fever dream. It was entirely too early for this shit.
"Dean. You were forgiven a long time ago. I won't lie, living alone as a human was very… painful. Frightening. I didn't understand the world and the world didn't understand me. I didn't understand you." Cas breathed but kept his face tucked in the space between Dean's chin and collarbone. Looking at him right now would be too hard.
Erin stifled a laugh. "Nah, it wasn't too bad, you know I got mad baby skills. Besides, you really needed a break."
in the tub." Dean grinned and poked Cas in his side, provoking a disgruntled chirp and a feathery smack upside the head. The angel was sitting on the kitchen counter, wings draped over the side, watching over Dean as he mixed a huge bowl of batter. “Hey! Do
A couple weeks later, Erin woke up at the asscrack of dawn full of regret and a hatred of capitalism. Against her better judgement, she had agreed to take the earliest shift as a favor to one of her coworkers. Whoever decided Starbucks needed to open at five in the motherfucking morning was a sick, sick bastard. No one fucking lives in Lebanon anyways; they don’t even start getting customers until well after 8am, if not later.
save you, always." He coughed, blood coating his lips and dribbling down his chin. “J-just promise me you’ll take care of Jack, ‘kay? Make sure he knows how much I love him.”
"Look what I made!" Jack stood proudly and Sam laughed, impressed.
In just a couple strides Cas was across the room, where he dropped to his knees in front of Dean. He carefully removed the gag and moved to cradle his face, his hands impossibly gentle. "Dean," he breathed, "Dean, are you okay?" The familiar tingling sensation of Cas's healing grace flowed through his skin, easing the pain residing in every inch of his face.
“Dee,” he whispered, kind of breathy and high. Something definitely seemed not right. Dean’s stomach began to roil; Cas had been perfectly fine, even happy earlier.
“So, uh, I've never really been here before but I need a drink for my best friend?" The man's words lilted as he went on, sounding like he was asking for approval, as though Erin might tell him
(yup). "Tell me if it hurts though. We'll stop when you want."
"Dean, it's okay," he's saying, and Dean doesn't understand why. Then he realizes he's hyperventilating, still standing only because Cas is holding him up. He opens his mouth to tell Cas that he knows, that he's fine, but what comes out is a sob, and that's when he gives up. That's when he stops pretending.
“I’ll go to bed then too. Goodnight, Sam.” Jack rose from his seat, walking towards his room. “Goodnight, Dean,” then softer, “goodnight, Cas.”
Dean had carefully lifted Cas's face from his soggy shirt and adjusted him so his head rested on Dean's shoulder, pillowed by his flannel. Cas's wings were relaxed and drooping, and Dean fought the urge to pet them by gently running his fingers through Cas's hair instead.
"I don't know how to convince you I genuinely had no idea it would pain Castiel that badly, but I didn't, I promise," Rowena said with ostensible sincerity. When Dean's face remained stony and cold, she sighed.
Dean knew then and there that Cas would absolutely pitch a fit if he tried to shake him, so he continued to let Cas hang off him as he exited the car. He sent a silent prayer of gratitude towards Rowena; Cas's wings were flapping like a damn hummingbird's and only getting faster. No way they could've gone in public had his angelic appendages been visible.
"Cas, this is me begging for something I don't deserve. I…" Dean swallowed, "I love you, man. Of course I love you. I'm sorry it took me this long to say it. And I understand if it's too late, I do—" Cas grabbed his face and pressed a thumb against his mouth.
His first mistake? Leaving. Period. It felt all wrong from the get-go. The instant Dean pulled out of Lebanon, the
“Can you walk to the laundry room?” Cas nodded silently and they started down the hall, Cas leaving a trail of little wet footprints in his wake.
“Thanks, Jack,” Sam said finally. “You know you’re good too, right? We don’t even have to see your soul to tell. It doesn’t matter that Lucifer was your father or that you were soulless or any of that, okay? You’re not broken either.” Jack’s eyes went wide for a second, then he smiled shyly.
"And even if you don't, you'll never be as bad as Cas. I swear, some of the conversations we've had…" Dean shook his head with a smile. "I mean, you know how he was, Sammy. Like that one time, I told him to get outta my ass, and he just squinted and said 'I was never in your… '" He did his best Cas impression, voice gravelly and pitched even lower than usual. Both Jack and Sam laughed. "Or when we were talking about that one joke, the 'why is six afraid of seven' one, and he said some shit about how seven is a prime number and prime numbers are intimidating?" Dean paused to take a bite out of his burger while Sam wiped his eyes.
"Great! Let's get started," Dean said, happy to finally get some pancakes on the stove. Handing the cup of batter to Jack, he maneuvered his shoulders until he was standing in front of the pan. "Alright, make two or three small piles of batter. Don't overdo it, they expand in the pan, so make sure they each have plenty of space." Jack nodded and meticulously began to pour, the pan sizzling as batter landed on the hot surface.
"I need three black coffees. Our coffee maker broke, and Dean requires his morning cup to function adequately throughout the day.”
"Nuh uh. No touching, not after last time."
"He's been way fussier than usual, won't stay quiet longer than an hour, wails uncontrollably when I try to change his diaper. It doesn't matter what I do, he's never happy with it. It's torture, pure torture. "
Behind him, Dean heard a kind of strangled sound, stifled, barely audible. He whipped around, not sure what he was expecting to see, but it definitely wasn't Cas leaning against the doorway, hand over mouth, shoulders shaking, shiny baby blues flitting back and forth from the crib to Dean.
So when a case only a few hours away popped up on their radar, Dean jumped hungrily at the chance to take it. All signs pointed to it being a classic salt-and-burn, a walk in the park, easy as pie—if there was any hunt Cas would be even remotely okay with, it'd be this one. He brought it up casually, sprinkling it into conversation as he stood at the stove.
As Erin futilely attempted to keep Jack still in her arms, he let out a particularly ear-splitting shriek, and there was a weird crashing noise from the other side of the house. The baby went right on crying uncontrollably but Erin froze, holding in her breath. There wasn’t supposed to be anyone else in the house, and she knew Cas didn’t have pets. Her heart raced behind her ribs; so not only did she have to deal with a hysterical baby, she might have to deal with a fuckin’ intruder-slash-murderer too. Great.
“Swear on it, Dean.”
"He doesn't just love you either—he adores you, he
was that? Were your parents, like, Jesus freaks?" She opened her mouth to say something else but stopped, eyes going wide.
I can’t even see you, what—what if I’m dreaming? Is this the Empty? Oh, oh no, oh no no
"Yeah, sure, go ahead." Dean was practically growling, eyes still fixed on Cas, not even sparing Erin a glance. He jabbed a finger at his chest. "You ‘nd me are going to have a quick little chat."
"You'll make me wish I'd never been born, you'll put a bullet in my brain before I even get the chance to blink, so on and so forth, etcetera, etcetera. I get the point." Rowena tsked. "You Winchester boys really are so predictable."
. Dean tipped his head towards the ceiling and exhaled slowly, trying (and failing) to control his breathing. A burning sensation was expanding in his chest, creeping into his throat and behind his eyelids. Fists clenching and unclenching, he willed himself not to cry, or scream, or bash his head against the wall. All equally enticing options at the moment.
Still walking, Dean looked down at the kid he was carrying.
did i make my ocs flirt for absolutely no reason other than im a shy lesbian and we deserve representation? perhaps 🙈 friendship ended w destiel sorry erin/jasmine is my new best friend now
"Actually, angels don't normally sleep
Man, it fucking broke Dean’s heart to hear how unsure Cas sounded. Like he really didn’t know how loved he was. His eyes were starry and far away, looking like he was expecting the worst but still praying against all odds for the best. It made Dean want to reach inside his head and rip out all the lingering doubt as to whether he cared about Cas, because the truth was Dean cared so much it fucking overwhelmed him sometimes. It
Erin's jaw went slack as she looked at Cas, feeling some combination of impressed and slightly afraid. "Dude, what the
"Haven't you already said enough? What else could you possibly have to tell me? You've made it perfectly clear how you feel, h-how you feel about me and Jack. Just take me back to the bunker, we'll leave first thing in the morning. You don't have to tell me to go again. I 'got the memo,' as you say." He kept his face in his hands, not trusting himself to look at Dean without completely losing it.
“I-I know things are weird and different for you right now, but you’re still my dad, and if Dean hadn’t been so desperate to do it alone, I would’ve taken you out of the Empty myself. I would’ve done it because you don’t belong there, you belong with us, with me. With your family.”

“Mmhmm, we have a pretty large variety but I'd probably recommend the honey citrus blend. Never tried it myself but it's supposed to be soothing.”
“That is probably the one thing I worry about the most. I hate to separate Dean and Jack. They’ve bonded so much already, and they’re good for each other. Jack brings out a side of Dean he doesn’t get to indulge often, and I think it’s healthy for Jack to develop early relationships with people other than me.”
(with broken resolve,
Dean wouldn’t give to have him stay and never ever leave again.
He reached into the carrier and pulled out the little stuffed bee, handing it to Erin. “He likes having this while he sleeps. I think it helps him keep his arms from flailing around.” She held the bee in front of Jack, who immediately wrapped himself around it. He began turning his body inwards towards Erin, attempting to burrow into her stomach. She hesitantly scooped Jack up into her arms, supporting the back of his neck with her hand and rocking him gently. Erin looked at Castiel, unsure if she was doing this correctly, but he simply smiled and nodded in approval.
"Yeah, I'll take the cheeseburger, side of fries, thanks." She nodded and gathered the long laminated menus from their table, then looked back at Dean.
Ain’t that the million-dollar question. “Um, yeah? I think so? Just—just incredibly confused.” She smiled weakly at Cas. “I don’t know how we got here, and I have no idea what the fuck it was I just saw Jack do to you and Dean, and don’t even get me fucking started on the fire and the goddamn dead girl in the corner, but, uh. Physically I’m good. Just not totally sure I’m not dreaming right now.” The laugh that bubbled out of her throat was more than a little delirious, and she cringed at the note of hysteria it possessed.
Dean exhaled shakily. "Okay. Okay, good. Thanks, Rowena. We, uh, we really owe you one." She smirked, eyes devious.
"Cas? What's wrong?"
“It’s okay. I wish I could grow up too. Being a kid is not very fun so far. I think I would much rather be a dad again and take care of you.” Jack sniffled in his arms, lifting his face up to look at Cas with pleading eyes.
Yep, just call her the human centipede, because Erin's pretty sure she just put upwards of twenty feet in her mouth.
The trench coat had somehow moved across the floor, now only inches away from Dean. The material folded and creased as the coat
Erin looked at Castiel in surprise but quickly nodded. “Oh my god, I’d love to.”
to die for love. For Dean. He knows this might just be enough to get Dean to snap out of it, to gain control over the Mark as Cain managed for so long. Admittedly, there might be some wishful thinking with that comparison; Castiel’s no Colette, could never be Dean’s Colette, but he’s willing to at least try. He knows killing him would affect Dean to some degree, and if there’s a chance it could be enough to make Dean stop, it’s worth it. And there really isn’t anything else Castiel can do to help. Alive, he’s utterly useless—however, his death holds potential, and he wants to be useful. After all, his life is a small price to pay for the safety of the world. It would be selfish, really, to
“Hey, dude. I got Jack fed and put to bed a few minutes ago. I know you haven’t eaten yet so I brought you some soup, but I can turn off the light and go if you want me to,” she said, sitting on the very edge of the mattress. When Cas didn’t respond, she let out a tiny sigh. “Alright, g’night Cas.”
"Excuse me?"
"What the hell?"
"Yeah, Cas. Always."
"I do. Let's hear what else you can remember since the first Apocalypse." Dean wanted to start after they'd met; Cas had millions of years worth of memories, and it'd be way too overwhelming for him to try and sort through all those snippets and moments in time. Most of them probably weren't even comprehensible to the human mind anyways.
alive, safe, by being here for us. You're the only reason this house hasn't collapsed on us yet, the only reason I'm not eating peanut butter jelly sandwiches and instant ramen every night. We need you here—not just because of what you do, but because we love you and
"You and Sam stay the hell away from me. Next time, I won't miss."
and pulls off to the side of the road, gravel biting into Baby’s tires. “Let’s, uh, take a break from driving for a minute, okay?”
Jasmine threw back her head, but the explosive column of black smoke he was expecting never came out. No, the only thing that left her throat was a bone-chilling laugh. She closed her mouth and wiped her eyes, leaving both Dean and Cas frozen in surprise.
"No, not as of yet. I haven't checked my phone since last night though, so maybe there's something new? I doubt it though," he said sadly, dipping the spoon into the baby food and positioning it in front of Jack, who gurgled and stuck out his tongue in a clear sign of rejection.
“Hey, do you guys wanna hang in the library while we take care of Cas? It’s just right over here, and you’ll probably find it more comfortable.” Jasmine and Erin turned to look at each other, unsure of what to do or say. Jasmine shrugged, making Jack bounce up and down. He burbled as Sam waited expectantly for an answer.
Dean looked back down at Cas, still shaking but considerably calmer, currently in the process of ruining his shirt with tears and snot. He felt him humming against his chest, high-pitched and breathy and fragile. He really missed his Cas.
It was obvious Cas didn't believe him in the slightest, but nevertheless he drank the whole cup, pouting as he held it back out for Rowena to take. She laughed and turned to Dean.
He'll forgive you for anything. Hell, you could probably stab him and he'd apologize for being in the way or bleeding on you."
"Yes, Dean," Cas replies gently. He's smiling but it's a little sad. Dean feels like shit but he has to ask one more time, chokes out one last "Cas?" for good measure.
“Nah,” he huffed, a little out of breath by the time he finally got his feet on the ground. “I got it. You go ahead and get the door unlocked, I’ll be right behind you.”
"Okay. If you say so," Cas said shyly. He opened and shut his mouth as though trying to decide what to say before opening his mouth again and asking, "Can I, um, use your shirts again too? I won't make as much of a mess this time, I promise."
"If the spell works, the changes should occur within the next few minutes. Until then, we'll just have to wait." Even though Rowena had already reassured Dean that nothing harmful would happen, he still felt his heart rate increase at the thought of Cas changing, all the possible things that could go wrong. He took a deep breath, trying to quell the churning in his stomach.
Unfortunately, this girl was
"It's beautiful," Dean said sincerely, "really beautiful, Cas." The angel visibly swelled, chirping fast and beaming with pride. He pushed the paper to Dean's chest, big eyes peering expectedly into his. "You want me to have it?"
for once. Where once Dean was Cas’s charge, and now Cas is dependent on Dean. He didn’t mind—he would gladly take care of Cas, anytime, anywhere, but he hated that Cas was like this involuntarily. It wasn't fair, that after all he'd sacrificed this was his reward. Being reduced to a fraction of what he once was, just a child with wings, dependent on a couple of washed-up hunters and a nephil with God powers.
It’s Cas, and he’s walking towards Dean, who can’t breathe, can’t even open his mouth.
“Of course we know each other. Why do you think Cas comes here so often, anyways? It's sure as hell not for the coffee.” Erin waggled her eyebrows obnoxiously before giving Cas an exaggerated wink. He looked like he wanted the floor to swallow him up.
“Feel free to explore any of the books while you wait. I’ll be back in a few minutes.” Sam gave them one last smile before turning around and walking back out the way they came, leaving the two girls and the baby alone.
“Shh, Dean. It’s okay. I’m okay,” Cas said softly, pressing one of his hands flat against Dean’s chest. “I’m okay. What happened?”
"Oh yeah, the whole supernatural world knows about that. It's kinda impossible to miss a cosmic disturbance of that great of a magnitude. I mean, the flesh-and-blood kid of the literal motherfuckin’
hi guys!! as always thanks for reading, if u have feedback lmk i'd love to hear it :) @ the ppl giving me consistent comments - i see u, i love u, i am giving u forehead kisses *mwah* yall are the BEST!!! also. um. if any of yall are interested in other stuff i've written i am working on
“You’re supposed to talk about it with me, not completely ignore me and shut me out. I expect you to act like a fucking adult. Jesus, it’s literally the bare fucking minimum, Cas.” Dean sighed again, rubbing his face in exasperation.
"Hush, love. It's okay, go to sleep. I'm right here," Cas whispered, his chin resting on Dean's shoulder.
"And if we don't want to wait?" Dean asked, the question coming out a little more impatiently than he intended. Sam shot him a dirty look from behind Rowena, who just looked kinda amused.
you son of a bitch. Tell me where the fuck he is or I swear to G—”
“You—you love me too?”
"I'm the—the spanner in the works, the angel with the crack in its cha—ch—
Dean's body flooded with ice. Then he felt his resolve cracking, some of his sadness giving way to anger, hot and pulsing and overwhelming. He pulled away from Cas, needing to see his face.
"I swear to God," Dean grumbled, "if you catch a cold because you freakin' refused to dry yourself off, I'm gonna be
When they got back to the bunker, Jack was the one to carry Cas inside. “G’night, Cas,” he whispered, hugging him tightly before handing him off to Dean and walking to his own room for the night. Sam silently excused himself, leaving Dean walking the hallways alone. His room was still a disaster from earlier that day, forcing him to carefully step over the clothing strewn across his floor. Gently placing Cas on the bed, he left to take a quick shower, praying the whole time for Cas to stay asleep. Luckily, Dean returned to find the kid still peacefully sleeping, snuggled into his makeshift nest of shirts.
So Dean ran back into the store and asked the register lady if he could just buy a ring box, please and thank you. He paid and drove home, humming the whole drive back, and that box has been burning a hole in his pocket ever since.
"Feel any better?"
"Cas?" He hesitantly poked the shaking pile of shirts and got nothing but a pitiful chirp in response. Dean was about to try again when someone knocked on his door.
“Hello, Erin.” Impossibly, his voice seemed even lower than usual, scratchy and grating.
"Who the fuck are you and what the fuck do you want with me?" Dean grunted, straight to the point. Now that he was awake, he could tell he was on the floor, arms behind his back and tied to a metal column. He wiggled a bit, testing the ropes, but they were taut and thick.
"Please don't be sad. You're good, and I forgive you for whatever you think you did bad. It's okay." Dean didn't respond because he didn't think he was capable of speaking without either hurling or sobbing, which prompted Cas to hug him tighter. "I can talk about other memories instead, now, if you want."
And how is it that one word could make Dean want to burst into tears again so badly? He dropped his chin to his chest, jaw beginning to tremble again. God, this was embarrassing. Even if he wanted to speak, he didn't trust himself to open his mouth without letting a sob escape. His eyes screwed shut without him even thinking about it, his mind trying to pretend that Dean was the only one in the room. Maybe if he stayed still for long enough, everyone else would eventually leave him alone.
Castiel had been sitting outside for some time now, resting on the curb, head in hands. He was a fool. A goddamn fool. Of course Dean would never want him. Of course he would be repulsed by Cas’s feelings, mock him for his “domestic wet dream,” his absurd fantasy of attaining even just a semblance of normalcy. Of course Dean would take a shot at Cas’s inadequacy as a father, his inability to provide Jack with a real family, parents who actually know what they’re doing. God, he missed Jack so bad. He wanted to kiss his forehead, hold him close and feel his heartbeat against his chest, reassure him that he will never be a burden to Cas, that he is so loved, that Cas considers himself the luckiest man alive with Jack as his son.
"Yeah, I'll take a plate. Thanks, kiddo," he said, smiling weakly but with genuine gratitude. He sat on the bench, scooting next to Jack, while Cas quickly climbed up his leg and stationed himself on Dean's lap with a happy hum. He was still repeating 'Dee' about every thirty seconds for no discernible reason other than he simply liked saying it, which freaked Dean out just a little bit.
Sam opened the door to the diner, holding it for Jack and Dean as they walked in. Jack led the way to a booth in the corner, far away from any other customers.
After finishing the bottle, it didn’t take long for Jack’s eyelids to begin drooping, body going full boneless against Erin. She rocked him back and forth, humming absentmindedly. “
It took a few minutes of Cas screaming into his chest and dampening the sleeve of his shirt with tears, but gradually his voice quieted. His breathing steadied, and Dean could feel him shudder with each wet exhale. A small shaking hand grabbed the fabric of his shirt, holding onto it so tightly Dean was a little afraid it might rip.
freak out a little bit (okay, maybe more than just a little bit), so she simply chose to Not Think About It.
Dean was seriously not in the mood to handle a toddler breakdown.
” she sang somewhat frantically, “
"So, do I hang or fold the shirts?" She held up a black AC/DC tee, trying to grab Cas's attention as he walked back in from the kitchen. After they'd finished their soups, he'd volunteered to return the bowls to the sink and do the dishes, so Erin offered to get started on the laundry she knew Cas had meant to get through that afternoon.
“You know I—I love you too, right? I know I’ve done some—some really messed up stuff, and, um—” Dean tilted his head back, unable to look Jack in the eyes, ‘cuz he’s a coward and they both know it. “I don’t deserve your forgiveness. Hell, I don’t know how you haven’t smited me yet, God knows you’ve got every right to, but for what it’s worth, I’m sorry. I’ve—I’ve been selfish and stupid and unfair, and all you’ve ever done is try your best.” He sniffed. “You ‘n Cas are real similar like that, y’know? He’s always,
And that’s the end of that.
“I'm afraid sometimes Dean just pretends to be happy with me, the same way he did with her, that he just fakes how he feels and what he wants. I love Dean, and we’re both trying to be better and more honest with each other, but he has always acted from a place of duty, of obligation, not true desire.” Cas stopped to take a deep breath.
This is not how Dean had pictured their reunion going.
"Um, I didn't know I could still, uh, do that. Sorry?" A fierce blush rose in Cas's cheeks, growing hot under Dean's hands. Dean raised his eyebrows and then burst out laughing, shaking his head.
"Hi, Dean," he said through a heaping mouthful of Cookie Crunch. "Sam 'n Rowena are in the map room, I think. Rowena said she brought some supplies and needed somewhere to spread them out." He swallowed and put his spoon back down with a metallic
"I'm sorry, baby, but I have to go," Cas mumbled, speaking against the top of Jack's head as he clutched him tight to his chest. He kissed his forehead before cradling him even closer. "I love you so much. I'll be back soon, I promise, okay honey? And I'm bringing Daddy back with me. We'll be right back, promise. I love you, Jack."
"Have you heard from Dean yet?”
"You like? Got it done as soon as I went topside and took this sweet piece of ass for a ride. I realized this one's a real keeper, and bam. Sealed myself in. I can't be expelled from the vessel. You can try if you want, of course. Gotta warn you though—it's hardly even a tickle for me, but it's pretty fucking excruciating for the poor bitch in the backseat." Jasmine—no, the demon's grin made Dean want to hurl. He couldn't help thinking about the girl that must be trapped in there with it, desperate for escape from her own mind, her own body.
“It comes from old Arabic,
“Are you really that stupid? Oh, you poor thing,” the Empty drawled. “You really think Dean cares enough to come back for you. How… delusional.”
“I just don’t understand, and I don’t know what to do,” he said, very quietly. He looked Erin in the eyes for the first time the whole conversation. “I’m sorry for rambling. I’m sure none of this makes any sense and—”
you here with the Empty spell. You gotta keep track of all the angels and demons, you can't just ignore what you are."
Dean, singing to Led Zeppelin behind the wheel of the Impala.
Dean tried to say something back but all that came out was a pathetic choking noise, wet and desperate and full of pain. He slid his hand behind Cas's head and cradled it to his shoulder, burying his tear-stained face in Cas's hair.
“No. You told me yourself, that first year you got me back into hunting, that you were tired of it.” He slams his fist against the table. “
Cas looked to Dean with big, baleful eyes, clearly still reluctant to take the drink but willing to do just about anything if Dean wanted him to. He chirped once, sad but accepting, and took the offered cup in his hands.
"Um, could you turn on the water? Let it run cold," he said, wincing at just the thought of how freezing the bath was gonna be.
“Your Grace?”
It took a couple more minutes before anyone spoke again. Sam was the one who broke the silence, Jack continuing to sit at the table quietly.
Erin beamed. “Ditto, dude. You’re by far the most interesting customer I have.” She paused for a second.
"I love Jack more than life itself, I'd do anything for him, but I can't lie. He's been absolutely
“M’kay. Just for you,” Cas whispered, voice hoarse. He closed his eyes, let the weight of his head rest in Dean’s hands. Dean used his thumb to swipe away a stray tear hiding underneath Cas’s bottom lashes.
“This is me askin’. Cas, I love you. I love you more than anything. I love the way you try to hum along to all my cassettes, even though you don’t know the tunes. ‘Cause that just means I get to teach ‘em to you myself. I love the way you get clingy in your sleep 'cause it makes me feel safe when I wake up. I love the way you can’t cook for shit ‘cause it keeps you outta the kitchen, and I get to make you all my favorite foods. I’m crazy about you, man. You’re my best friend, and one of the only things left on this godforsaken planet that makes me happy, and I wanna make you happy for the rest of my life.”
Unsurprisingly, Cas refused to budge, shaking his head against Dean's chest frantically. Dean sighed and chewed his lip. This was not gonna be easy.
to get this point across. "No need to say sorry, I forgive you, but do
Dean barely had time to think
Despite the knot growing in his stomach, Dean mustered up a smile for the kid. “Sure thing, Jack, as soon as we’re done.” Jack beamed.
"Alright kiddo, let's get you cooled down, 'kay?" Dean looked down his nose, trying to meet Cas's eyes. "You gotta scoot away from me so I can take off your clothes."
letting you go.”
“Hey. Cas, it's okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have teased you about Dean. You can trust me. I know how important he is to you, I'm not gonna tell him the stuff you tell me.” Erin spoke softly, trying to be reassuring. “If it makes you feel any better, now that I've met Dean I can almost guarantee he is just as smitten with you as you are with him.”
"Holy
"Maybe it's hypocritical, me questioning whether he stays here out of obligation when he could just as easily be doing it of his own free will. But I know Dean, and I know his actions have always been motivated more by duty, debt, guilt than want. And it really just doesn't make sense that he'd want this, anyways." Cas sighed, wilting a bit where he was planted on the bed. He grabbed another shirt and began fiddling with the sleeve.
The lights went out and Cas's arms immediately tightened around Dean's neck with an unreasonably adorable squeak. "Dee?" He sounded so scared, and it was starting to really freak Dean out. Cas had slept fine in the dark up until now, and Dean couldn't think of anything that had changed. He gnawed on his lip again, a little seed of worry beginning to grow in his chest.
And then Cas touches
Erin broke the silence, speaking quietly. "I'm sorry, Castiel. I'm really, really sorry." She wasn't sure if she was apologizing for the cold drinks or her intrusive questions or Castiel's situation with Dean. Maybe all three.
"Bet you feel better now, hmm? See, no big deal. Told you I'm always gonna take care of you." Dean kept walking down the hallway, holding the baby a bit closer. "Me 'n your daddy are gonna keep you safe, protect you, always. I know I haven't been so good at that lately but I'm gonna do better, promise. I'm gonna work for it, for you."
“I… I love him, I love him so much, and he still doesn’t see it, and it breaks my heart.”
Cas to reassure him that he wasn't still the man he'd been in the Pit, that he was better than the animal Alastair had carved him into, but Cas was just staring at him blankly, hand limp in Dean's grasp.
Cas left the kitchen, hand lingering on Dean's shoulder just a second longer than normal. Unfortunately, the shitty feeling in Dean's stomach stayed. It festered behind his rib cage during dinner, appetite nonexistent as he stared at his bowl of soup. Violently churned when he crept out of bed, sliding stealthily from underneath Cas's arm to pack an overnight bag in the dark of his room. Roiled in choppy waves when he woke in the morning to an empty bed, his bag lying open on his desk, visibly rifled through.
"Of course, grace is an incredibly fickle and volatile thing, so full disclosure: I haven't the slightest clue whether this will actually do anything. Figure it's worth a shot though, aye?"
He couldn't have been more wrong.
“We are stopping here?” There’s no judgement in Cas’s voice, just confusion, and Dean rolls further into the empty field before putting the car in park.
said anything? I—I don't… I don't understand it, man. How could you possibly—all the things I've done—and still?" Choking on his words, Dean just leaned against Cas helplessly, not even sure how to articulate what he wanted to say. Cas looked up sharply, pinning Dean with a surprisingly fiery glare.
"Well, yes, but that's besides the po—”
Dean’s heart sank to his gut as he realized what Cas was talking about.
. Erin jerked at the sound, startling so hard she damn near ripped the plastic buttons off his tiny clothes. It was the kind of scream, the kind of noise that made her feel downright nauseous. Not a
"Besides, my love is not conditional on his reciprocation. Dean tends to shy away from serious long-term relationships, and I know he doesn't 'swing my way,' as one says." Erin grimaced. She knew from experience that falling for straight people totally sucked ass. All that unrequited love shit hurt like a bitch.
does he sound like a twelve year-old girl. Then Cas is smiling even wider, and he’s leaning towards Dean with happy eyes, and Dean is breathing again.
Cas freaked the fuck out after Erin told him about meeting Dean. He stormed into the Starbucks a few days later, catching Erin off-guard sitting at a table during her break.
"Hello, sweetie. This is for you, special custom-made." Cas, however, did not seem interested, and turned away, hiding his face in Dean's shoulder.
protruding from her guts. It was disturbing to look at, in no small part due to the fact that she was probably only a few years older than Erin.
“Don’t talk about Jack like that. If housing us is such a burden, by all means, kick us out. It’s not like you’ve ever hesitated to do that before,” Cas spat, glaring at Dean. “And you should know I actually have found somewhere else to stay, weeks ago. I’ve wanted to talk to you about this for a long time but I knew you’d react poorly.” Cas suddenly looked very tired, deflated, all the fight simply dissipated from his system.
Erin nodded. “Okay, we’ll stand by the door until you’re ready.” Jasmine opened her door and began walking towards the entrance immediately, carrying a still-sleeping Jack against her chest. Erin lingered in the truck, eyeing Dean as he clearly struggled to get out of the car with Cas limp in his arms.
Dean resolved to tell Cas the second they got back from the Empty. He had still been fucking livid at the angel—who gave Cas the fucking right to just, just
"It’s okay, that’s it,” Dean said softly, rubbing the back of Cas’s neck as he heaved again. “You’re okay, baby. We’re halfway there, just gotta hold on a little longer. You’ve been doing so good.”
Cas made a half-hearted
"Cas?" He’d heard Jack’s wings before he heard him say his name, flapping to a stop a few feet behind him.
, conforming to the shape of what appeared to be a squirming lump in its center. Eyes widening, Dean could only watch as a tuft of black hair emerged from the heap, rising above the collar. In a second, he found himself staring into a pair of very familiar baby blues, their foreheads and noses almost touching.
"Did…" Cas's face screwed up in a mixture of confusion, amusement, and surprise. "Did you just quote the Bible to me?"
Jack flipped his first batch of pancakes perfectly, with Cas humming in encouragement on his shoulders. "You guys make a pretty good team," Dean noted. Jack laughed and tried to look up at Cas, holding his hand up for a high-five. Instead, Cas wrapped a few feathers around the hand and petted Jack's head, chirping with what seemed like approval.
Dean grabs his tie just below the knot, right by the collar of his shirt, and in a moment of weakness, Castiel slaps his hand against Dean's arm and holds it. If this is how it ends, he wants to be touching him. Feel the warmth of his skin one last time. Grip him tight. It appears to make Dean hesitate for the slightest second, a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it pause.
"You really thought it'd be that easy? And to think you were once supposed to be Heaven's finest." Jasmine stood facing both of them, profusely bleeding from a gash on her temple.
"No. No, Cas." He felt Dean's hands cupping his face, thumb rubbing slow circles on his cheekbone. A sob was working its way up his throat. "Look at me."
“Alright. Name for the order?”
safe. I've tweaked it to work with grace rather than souls and whatnot, but at its core it's still just a healing spell. No bells and whistles, no unnecessarily complex nonsense. Also, I knew you would burn me at the stake should any potential harm befall your wee angel, so I tried to air on the side of caution." She tipped the water into Sam's bowl of ground ingredients and paused to mutter a few words in what sounded like Latin over the mix. The liquid flared electric blue for just a second before returning to normal, and she poured it all back into the cup before picking it up and holding it in front of Cas.
Ten minutes.
(yeah, but I wanted to). Cas leaned against the back of Dean's neck, really wrapping himself around his head. Dean huffed in fake annoyance; truthfully, he kinda liked Cas perched on his shoulder. It felt right.
Rough, calloused fingers wrapped themselves around Cas's, gently tugging them away from his face. Dean was being entirely too tender. Cas felt raw, all his nerves flayed and exposed.
"Or maybe they
A few seconds passed in silent darkness before the door on Cas's side swung open, startling him so badly he whacked his head against the window and almost fell out of the car. Dean let go of the handle and rushed to steady him, bending a bit to support Cas's weight.
"You gon' watch over me?" he asked, voice thick, eyes already fluttered closed. Dean smiled, thinking back to the days when a certain angel would do the same to him.
Dean, where is he? Is he safe?”
for his trauma, and was fucking
Only a few seconds after being laid down, Jack screamed, loud and clear and
"Yes, I'd like that."
It took a moment of heart-stopping silence for him to respond, but Cas answered with a shaky “Dean? I—”, which was all he managed to get out before Dean started crying again, drawing him closer to his chest until he was basically suffocating the man.

“I don't think so, Cas. He
His most recent text was from a few days ago, a shot of Jack bundled in a puffy coat and knitted hat, cheeks rosy with cold. Cas's arms were wrapped around him tight, securing him on his lap as they sat together on a bed of snow. The photo captured Jack’s smile and Cas mid-laugh, eyes sparkling at whoever was behind the camera. Erin would bet the farm it was Dean who took the picture.
"Hey, you know where the pans are, right?" Jack nodded. "Can you grab me one?"
"Dude, seriously, you're gonna hurt yourself."
"Uh, you good, dude?" She could tell from the emptiness in Cas's eyes that he had checked the fuck out, retreating to some spot deep in his memories, which scared her more than she'd like to admit. A chill began to inch its way through her body. "Cas?"
"Nope, get over here. Can't get away that easily." Dean pulled him into his lap, wrapping his arms around him. Cas's eyes were shiny, his cheeks wet and blotchy. He struggled briefly, wiggling against Dean, but quickly melted into the hug and began to hum happily. "I'm sorry, Cas. I didn't really know what you were doing but I get it now, and I screwed up. I didn’t mean to mess up your nest, I was just bein’ stupid and forgot. I think it looks great, and I’m happy you wanna share it with me.”
“Please… s-stop it…”
to change it, but she’d rather be safe than sorry. Diapers are just one of those things you simply do
"My hypothesis is that exiting the Empty put too much stress on the boy's grace, causing it to fracture, and the process of changing realms left his shattered grace too weak to properly restore his vessel in time. Going from one plane to another is traumatizing to the body, even for celestial beings."
alright buckle in friends this one is a bit of a doozy. warning in advance for egregious abuse of italics and em dashes lol
A soft sniffle drew Dean back to reality. Cas twitched in his lap, cheek rubbing against the rough denim. His face was scrunched up a little, shoulders tense and raised to his ears. Dean wiped his hand on a napkin before bringing it to Cas's head and mussing up his hair affectionately. He relaxed with a quiet, content sigh.
Opening the fridge with a grunt, Dean grabbed one of the bottles of formula Cas had made earlier that day. He put it on the counter next to the sink before turning on the faucet, waiting for the water to turn warm. Jack had quieted down a bit, and Dean shifted him to his other shoulder, giving his right arm a break. He couldn't help it—babies got heavy after awhile. So sue him.
"So, uh, we kept drawing after you guys left, and Cas wanted to give me his picture so I took it, which I guess made him so happy that he blew out a few lights"—Dean chose to omit some details there—"so I had to calm him down a bit. Thing is, I couldn't actually tell what the drawing was supposed to be so I asked him and he did this insane thing with his mojo where I, uh," Dean swallowed. "I saw my soul in his memories. He was drawing my soul, and he did somethin' with his angel powers that made me see
Dean processed what Sam said for a second. It still didn't explain why Cas kept trying to 'fix' his emotions, but he wasn't about to mention
Heat blasted from the dryer when Dean opened it, reaching in for the armful of fluffy towels.
