“-to make things as best as I could. You have no IDEA how much I wanted you two with me, how much I need you two, and now Sam’s off away at school and you-”
“I...I know I bug you way too much about that Dean Winchester guy, and it must be annoying as hell,” she admitted, shuffling her sneakered feet over each other, creating a quiet yet mildly painful squeaking noise. “I know you started talking to him just because you’re an awesome bartender and you were just being polite, and whatever reasons you have for talking to him isn’t any of my business, and I just wanted to say sorry for making it into something it wasn’t, or being intrusive. I don’t know…”
“Yeah. You’re right. We’re…God, we’re stupid. Sam was tracking this hunt, we were lost back at the bunker, we drove in here without a plan. Without a thought. I guess…you know, we’re so damn used to having backup these days that we forgot what it’s like to fight alone.”
Kevin laughed dryly, a laugh that I’d come to know was one of sarcasm and didn’t actually mean humor had entered the conversation.
“Before you ask, you can keep the change. Take it as all the tips I’ve been cheatin’ you out of,” he said with a sly wink and a smirk, yet the usual grace he possessed in doing so faltered due to the substance running through his system. And before I could register was what occurring before my eyes, let alone ask like Dean had said, there was the adrenaline rush of hands running against my arms, barely there but the light touch so intensely present, and Dean was rising up from his seat and flinging his jacket onto his shoulders. He almost missed the left arm hole, and I grew concerned as to how impaired his vision was.
I was so caught up in the magnitude of Dean Winchester’s changed appearance that I nearly missed his response as he called out to me, the syllable of his one word response fading into a murmur and accompanied by a small wave of the hand,
The dark eyed man, the hue of his irises deepened by the circles under his eyelids and the shadows his deep brow was casting downward, nodded his head vigorously after being reminded of my name, which I’d told him a good six times that evening, and I imagined myself rolling my own tired eyes in annoyance. I held them still, however, choosing politeness over my irritation’s relief.
The sincerity dripping like ooze off of each syllable she spoke was making it increasingly difficult to shut her out and not feel rude in doing so. She couldn’t know the truth of the matter though, no matter how caring she came across as, for I had little chance of surviving the swell of embarrassment.
Dean didn’t want that bitterness. No, he’d never wanted it. He’d built it up, constructed monuments to its name, lined his innards with the stuff, carved moats of lies and back alleys out of those testy, sweaty conversations, hammered the windows shut with broken, almost-something stares, bolted the doors closed with unsaid words, huddled in the dungeons upon every resisted touch.
“Raphael was the hard-nosed one of the group, and I believe it is appropriate to deem him the ‘asshole.’”
"Not a problem," I replied with a small smile, the one my boss taught me on my first day that had become muscle memory to my face, and went about my business of serving the angry and leathery customer. And while I went to work, I swear I could hear his very breath move in and out of his slightly parted lips. Something had seriously gotten under his skin.
“Listen man, I can tell you’re just tryna do your job here…” He began, rubbing a strong hand along the back of his neck and avoiding eye contact at all costs. There wasn’t much else to look at but his eyes trained themselves on whatever was not my face, whatever was not the face of the annoying pestering he was being forced to endure.
It wasn’t that what she was saying didn’t make sense to me. It did. I totally understood what she meant in her blunt, expletive description of Dean Winchester’s eyes and the way they sunk into avoidance whenever he was confronted in a way he couldn’t combat, or the way they got darker and darker as the moon hung higher and higher in the sky. I knew what she meant by his jawline, and the way he clenched it tight every time a question he deemed unanswerable was directed at him, or how it tensed just before he was about to deliver a particularly rude response.
“Cas. Please. I’m sorry. I need to tell –”
“All the guy wants is a Coors Light, Castiel,” Charlie answered once I arrived at the scene, swinging her arm around me as she flung her rag over her opposite shoulder in that casual, carefree way she seemed to always do things in, including embarrassing the hell out of her coworkers. “Woulda thought you’d remember, ya know, being such a good bartender and all…”
“Your brother seems to have faith that it will turn out well. I doubt he would come otherwise, right?” I suggested in sad, pitiful attempt to amend his negative outlook on the idea.
We were the same in one aspect, however: we both tended to use people. My dad had used me to dump his responsibilities and stressors onto, and now I was about to dump all my worries, pieces, and fragments onto Cas’s undeserving shoulders. I just hoped that Cas wouldn’t leave me like I’d just walked out on my dad, quickly realized how unfair that was, and as I pulled into the pub’s parking lot, I wiped away the last of those insistent tears.
“I-I don’t mind,” I stammered, noting how my voice was awkwardly monotone. I needed to work on that.
I shrugged my shoulders without meeting his gaze, but I felt it remain on me, a stare that was heated and intrigued, desperate to know more for reasons that continuously evaded me. Was this Dean Winchester only slightly buzzed, and interested?
She turned around on her heels suddenly, now standing next to me and facing in the same direction, and flung her thin arm around both of my shoulders, pulling me in close. Placing her head next to mine, she extended her hand outward and waved it across the pub like a tour guide showing off a particularly beautiful patch of scenery. I was struggling to find the beauty in a vacant pub though, besides the shine of the tables that Kevin had just cleaned.
“If I hadn’t have had Dean, I wouldn’t even be here right now. He put up with all your bullshit, all these years, stuck it out for me, and you have the nerve to say that at least one of us doesn’t know what it’s like?”
“Hook me up.”
Contrary to my companions belief, that is not where this story ended. Not enough action or interaction had occurred, and I could see straight through the few flimsy remaining walls surrounding the structure of Dean Winchester. Booze, destressors, and women were what he’d used to treat whatever hidden emotions, vices, and undealt with past demons in the past, but they hadn’t worked. Their failure was evident in that same slump of his shoulders, the way his lips were trained to meet a bottle, the way he was skilled in the art of denial and lack of formal, polite eye contact, and every other defensive trait he’d exhibited in the three occasions I’d had the pleasure of interacting with him, no matter how minimal such interaction had been.
Sam left two days after Dad dropped out, saying he wasn’t in the mood to be trapped in another episode of “Family Feud: Drunk Edition,” and while I couldn’t blame him, it felt as though he was tearing open a wound that had just begun to heal upon his arrival. He promised me to stay in better touch nowadays though, and he delivered, after giving me his younger brother advice. According to Sammy, Dad did nothing for me, and if he was still at home he would physically force me away from his very entity. I didn’t doubt his ability to achieve this, because even though Sam was a bit lanky, he had a good two and a half inches of height on me, but I pushed his suggestion away as far as I could once he was gone on the jetplane, into the sky, and into his future success.
“No, not really. All while he was telling me about his childhood and his family he made it very clear that he was okay, that he was only concerned with how their homelife had ‘screwed up’ Sam.”
“ya, but they’re not as fun to screw with as u.”
“I don’t know what the hell you are talking about. Dean...Dean was...he was being your brother, it wasn’t-”
“Dean, where are you-?”
“I thought that was just a fictional concept,” I admitted.
The way Dean’s face had fallen after hearing me say that send stabs of guilt into my stomach, as well as the feeling that there was far more to the story of Sam and Dean than he’d previously told me. The desire to know eventually beat out whatever guilt I had, anyways.
I clamped Cas hard on his back, the sound echoing throughout the room, dismissing his troubles and silently thanking Charlie for letting me in on Cas’s little description of me so many months back. It served as a great bargaining chip and annoyance to hang over my rather poetic companion’s head, though it didn’t seem to be quite as effective that morning since he was still willing to pull me in closer one last time and lock lips, deeper than I’d expected, with his top lip slotting between both of mine and threatening to pry them open, and I began to doubt my previous statement about him being the one to pull me from such distractions like the one we were presently caught in the middle. That would have to be my job then, but I let it continue a little longer than my counterpart would’ve had it been any other, more typical day.
I liked the smiling faces that Charlie typed out, usually to signal departure, and couldn’t get over the novelty of that colon and singular parenthesis. Kevin had once tried to explain to me that it was something usually done out of irony, or that sarcasm he was so fluent in, but when Charlie used it, it seemed genuine, so Kevin’s lesson went unused. I turned off my phone and slid it into the back pocket of my pants, feeling its weight pull down on my waistline.
“I was more of a ‘live in the moment’ kinda guy, went through tons of girls during school, drinking whenever my dad was outta sight...the works. I barely scraped by, really. Not cuz I’m dumb or anything like that, I just...never had the room to care.”
“No matter what I did, it wasn’t good enough. I raised Sammy, and I wouldn’t take any of it back in a heartbeat, but, hell, a dad is what he needed.”
I prepared the drink all while feeling mercilessly watched, though there were no green and brown-flecked eyes anywhere on me, and I struggled to understand how he was able to carry such an air of intimidation. If I ever wanted to win, if I ever wanted to redeem my status of “excellent people-watcher,” then I would have to get over the trembling of my fingers and his many, many walls of defense. There had to be a way to get inside, a backdoor. There always was...it was simply a matter of finding it.
Bobby was not a soft-talker, did not have an inside-voice, so Cas heard the length of his comment and chuckled proudly to himself as his fingers danced along the back of my neck, flicking my collar down. I gave him a rather dubious look but it did little to dampen his spirits, and I went back to the quickly failing conversation.
That reassurance didn’t stop there though. Two weeks after he’d arrived back home, Sam returned back to Stanford, but we’d departed on better terms than the previous separation. After Dad and I’s episode, I believe it was Bobby who’d filled my younger brother on the extent of what had transpired throughout my childhood, behind the closed doors of Sam’s own ignorance, and he’d begged me to let him help me help Dad. So the two of us entered John Winchester into rehabilitation after earning some sort of half-coherent agreement to try, “for his annoying as all hell boys,” something I never pictured happening outside of the dreams I kept private, let alone with my once-estranged brother, and it lasted ten days. A record, I tried to boast, but just like Bobby’s tire-rotation prices, we didn’t have any baseline for comparison.
After taking in my response, Dean’s face darkened with humor over whatever slick reply had popped into his head, egged on by the drink he’d consumed, and I waited on the edge of my seat to hear it.
“Be my guest,” my dad spat. Sam took every liberty available to him, exhausted my dad’s hospitality, and certainly was his guest in every sense of the damn word.
“And basically his ultimatum was ‘I’ll come and visit if Dad agrees to hop off my ass, and if not then I won’t be seeing you guys for awhile.’ You can probably guess what the outcome was.”
But, again, that was later. The only thing I had to routinely stare at while I was at work was the rusted hands on the clock which seemed to drag on agonizingly slow, and around ten-forty-nine I could’ve sworn that they’d frozen in place. I was in the middle of a particularly long and dreadful story, told to me through the lips of a college junior, consisting of his promise to me that he’d seen a ghost routinely for three weeks now, telling him to breakup with his girlfriend because in the distant future she would cheat on him with his uncle, of all people. I was asking for the ghost’s appearance, as if the shade of dead that her eyes possessed would make the tale any more bearable, when I wondered if the clock had stopped at the odd, unspecific time, staring at it for a good twenty seconds while the storyteller went on about her unruly hair, and let my mind wander.
Dean was actually the one who reminded me of this, and had he not I would’ve kept listening far into the early morning hours until my eyes drooped shut with exhaustion. Once he finished telling me his potential career in cosmetology that Sam had suggested too many years ago, he nodded towards the clock hanging on the wall behind us with a bittersweet look on his face.
Among the things that I was struggling to handle was the way Dean’s throat was flexed upward as he downed the remains of his drink, and how his adam’s-apple bobbed upwards as he swallowed, and how I wasn’t able to watch without splotches of red appearing on my cheeks to complement the purple and blue circles under my eyes.
My head shifted sharply to the right, where I saw two off-yellow headlights shine their beacons of now fleeting hope into the snow globe outside of the pub, and treated it as my final destination. It was him, it had to be. I felt my legs switch into high gear and dash in that light’s direction, moving at a pace I didn’t know they were capable of achieving, and nearly slipping on the slick sidewalk with every step, but I never took my eyes off the vehicle about to depart from the parking lot until I could see the driver in the front window and wave to tell him to stop. As if by some God-send, the driver saw me, recognized me, and ceased revving his engine.
“What about you...you into cars or anything? Know much about ‘em?”
“I lost everything when Mary died. You were his brother, Dean. You HAD to look out for him, you had no choice, just like I had no choice to carry on when Mary died-”
In minutes I’d learned a couple’s entire situation, their demeanor, (the wife being a workaholic, probably the boss of many, judging by the way in which she ordered her drinks and the wrinkles on her face. Certain wrinkles on the face were caused by certain things, of course. The husband was a follower, the complement of her and not the other way around. But anyone could figure that out if they had even just a brief amount of knowledge of family dynamics.) and could even tell you the ways that they both held their drinks and what the man’s breath smelled like, yet all I knew about Dean was that he was into cars. It was mindlessly frustrating to say the least, and none of that frustration subsided until the very end of the night.
“Dean...seems lost. There’s a lot going on his life at the moment, with his brother leaving for Stanford and his father being in the situation he’s in. I don’t believe he has anyone to unload on, so I’ve tried to take on the role.”
I didn’t know. The lady obviously felt some kind of emotion for the man, or her makeup wouldn’t be running and she wouldn’t be on her fifth glass of wine with tears in her eyes. I gave the lady one last look and, again, couldn’t understand her emotion if the love wasn’t real.
“Yes, that’s typically how such establishments work.”
“C’mon, don’t let this be the one that got away.”
And Dean glanced upwards, right at me, for the first time all night, and smiled an unsure grin of disbelief and amusement, and I quickly decided to pretend that my statement was supposed to be amusing.
It was certainly stretching things, but I needed an unbiased listener. I needed someone to tell me I wasn’t being selfish and that maybe I deserved to take just one day off from the rampage of chaos I called my life. I needed to listen to the shitty jukebox in the corner, I needed to marvel at the oddities that passed on through, I needed to lean lazily against the bar’s old, weathered surface, I needed to drink scotch without any aggravating ice cubes, and I needed to hear the rough around the edges yet soothing voice of the only person in my life who was totally on my side.
it. I don’t get those things. And you’re supposed to...dammit, Cas, we work these things out
I shot up from my slouched position, my own elbows leaned up against the bar in a fashion similar to Dean’s though I doubted I carried the same charisma, and waddled over to his own and otherwise vacant area to supply him with more of his drink that he seemed to so desperately need.
Car grease. That was the sting in my nose.
I was too busy gazing at Cas with betrayal and utter disbelief and I hardly heard Bobby’s chorus of hearty laughs and chortles as he said his true goodbye and hung up, the line going dead.
“Of course.”
That wasn’t fair, either. Dean knew that Sam’s suffering was not fair.
fair?
“Yeah, we went. Found our way to his latest dump of a house. He moves once every two months, for Christ’s sake.”
Every so often, between my gazes at Dean, which he returned by shooting me a similar, sympathetic look that mixed rather unsuccessfully with his poor mood, I glanced briefly at the clock and watched as the eleven o’ clock hour dwindled away, as well as the swell of people. Soon the bar was far less crowded, and those who still remained by fifteen minutes past midnight were on their last few drinks of the night, the limit drawn by myself, because despite my thorough observation of them, I still could tell when they needed to be cut off. The last thing I needed was someone coming down with alcohol poisoning and completely ruining the night for good.
His lips form over
“Because, Cas, we have some very important business to discuss, you and I, and privacy is essential.”
“Damn, that was uncalled for. All this emotional talk’s got me all soft ‘n shit.”
Cas’s smile deepened as his gaze softened, stretching as he spoke,
“Ask Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of-of course not, I was just listening to her story, that’s all,” I answered honestly. Charlie didn’t seem to buy it.
I do feel like Cas is the type of person to get hopelessly absorbed in other people, and not in the creepy way, but in the "I need to learn how to fit in better and improve my social skills, so I'm going to watch people until I can act like them exactly." Yes? No? Oh well.
Dean tossed me two twenties, a large amount of money that far surpassed the total that he owed, and my memory drove backwards to view the week before where he’d done the same. I imagined it what the amount of alcohol he consumed that caused the varying amount of dollar bills. If my theory was correct, he was much more hammered then than he had been before. It was also explain the halfway conversation.
One o’clock came too fast after those last few sentences died down, once the buzz had faded, and the night could been seen painting its way across both of our sleep-deprived faces, the bags under Dean’s eyes more accentuated due to the chemicals pumping their way through his strained veins. It was with a sad heart and a feeling of longing, if that was the correct term, that I informed Dean that we had to close up shop, but just like he’d been laid back with everything else that had occurred or been said that night, he left without a drop of annoyance. He’d even left a significantly less amount of spare change, this time the amount of money placed in front of me only exceeding the necessary amount by one dollar, and I watched him leave through blurring eyes and with a thumping heart.
I liked Amelia the best. Gabriel had a girlfriend when he was eighteen named Amelia, who had long blonde hair and a smile you would find on a toothpaste commercial, with a laugh to match. Once Gabriel and her had ended over what he told me was “a silly, dumb as shit misunderstanding that someone created to get back at me from some fuckin’ thing that I didn’t do,” he left. He called me a few times a month to make sure I was staying in school, not doing drugs or drinking too much, but he also kept me posted on his risky attempts to make it in Boston, and I guess someone found his voice iconic enough to stick it on a radio wave for mass amounts of people to hear. When he forgot to call, I found the radio station, listened through the static and the strained connection, and pretended like he was speaking to me directly. Apart from the poor signal, it was just as good as his used-to-be routine phone conversations. He was just as funny.
“Y-yes...he did. Last night we spoke for a while,” I stammered. It seemed, out of the blue, like Bobby and I’s conversation had occurred many days ago, not just a mere twenty four hours. So much had conspired in that span of time, not necessarily to myself but to Dean, especially, and that made it seem as though the length of the typical day had increased tenfold. But then, it made sense to me.
No, what had I done?
“Damn, am I that transparent, or are you just that good?” he said, exasperated, but now looking at me once more and searching for an answer. I would’ve responded in full with the latter, the second option hinting at how much I was able to collect about him, but quickly evaded that plan in fear of coming off as prideful and unnervingly creepy.
“It’s just that...he doesn’t get it. He ruined our lives, really. We never lived in one place. We never stopped. We never took a breather.”
“The usual,” was his answer, and boy did it make me grin.
I denied the presence of a red hue streaking across the skin beneath my eyes.
was okay. There was someone missing here. There was an absence so palpable that it halted the tingling, halted Dean’s demise for agonizing, painful seconds.
“I’ve always wondered what that’s like…” were his closing words.
The familiarity of his voice, echoing the fading memory of what it sounded like exactly one week ago, was enough to blow me backwards and lose my voice, but it persisted as the curiosity outweighed the minor terror, and I nodded my head.
He sure as hell is mine, of course.
“What car do you drive, if you don’t mind me asking?”
My saving grace turned out to be one that I wasn’t too pleased with, but I knew not to be too picky when it came to such things. The fact that it was a predictable, cut and dry Friday night served as somewhat of a comfort to me, due to the lack of surprises it posed. I knew who would arrive, what they would order, how long they would stay, and how to deal with them all as a whole and individually. It would stress-free, relaxing even, and then I could crawl back home and spend the night drilling Charlie’s stinging, burning victory into all the unwilling parts of my head as I stared as those stucco bumps in my ceiling. Mental anguish was something that I saved for my home life.
I read once in an article online, a science article about emotions humans experience in relation to physical reactions, that there was a phenomenon called frisson, or the feeling of getting chills or goosebumps on one’s skin after hearing or experiencing something of great emotional value. When I read it, I couldn’t relate to it much, much like I couldn’t relate to Dean’s explanation of his bond to his father, but now I had to change my stance. I felt like a cool breeze had consumed me, wrapped its cold arms around my middle, and my heart was in two.
And before I could protest, scold her, or voice any amount of my exasperation, she disappeared behind the doors along with the sound of her lighthearted laugh, carrying away like a beacon of all things annoying yet impossibly loveable. As much as Charlie drove me up every wall in remote proximity to her, working would surely not be the same without her.
“It’s on the house,” I finally announced weakly, not able to take the perplexed look Dean was giving me, though I was beginning to suspect that he was simply mirroring whatever foolish expression I wore.
“Lucifer, er...Luke, was the odd one out, and I suppose there’s always one of those, too,” I continued, mirroring Dean’s quick remark about Raphael. “He’s full of dry humor, the feeling of being misunderstood, the need to be rebellious...those sorts of things. He used to recommend music to me.”
“Just what?” He teased.
The source of my faltering was sipping leisurely, yet gratefully, at his drink without a care in the world gracing any section of his features. If anything, the slight buzz in his system that was dilating his pupils made him seem even more bright, more captivating, and I wanted to know how he was doing that, how he’d taken control of that conversation, what in the world he was trying to accomplish, and just what the warm, excited feeling in my stomach and lower abdomen was. It was like grasping at straws, but with three blindfolds on and with a clock chiming midnight in the background, and it took me ages to find any sort of reason or answer.
My brother continued,
Charlie was wrong. She was only pulling my leg.
“He was hardest on you though, correct?”
“Well, if you’re really interested, 'friend',” he began, the amount of intrigue pumping through my veins almost enough to combat the adrenaline and utter confusion at what in the world had possessed Dean to say such a thing?
Again, I made note of the humor in his tone and I let it fill me up with a warmth that I knew for a fact that it shouldn’t be feeling, but I was in the middle of a conversation about not suppressing things and I wasn’t about to be hypocritical.
“Hey, you sure you brought the pretzels? I looked everywhere but I didn’t see any-” Kevin began, a worrisome glint in his dark eyes. Charlie extinguished it swiftly.
And, to my immense relief, Sam’s frown evaporated into the brightest of smiles, brighter than even the color of his eyes, and not only did he accept my final attempt at satisfying his questions, he leapt up from the chair we’d stationed in the bathroom, turned around it in one clumsy, lopsided movement, and wrapped his thin, lanky arms around my middle. Even then, being a whole five years younger than myself, his head still came up to just under my chin.
“Everyone was cleared out by like eleven though. Couldn’t have been that difficult. Did something happen at home?”
“Ya know,” she began, dropping her voice lower in the sentimentally serious range, and I knew a load of hefty subject matter was coming my way. That annoying piece of my mind that wouldn’t stop running at a mile a minute just wouldn’t let me prepare for it.
“I mean it, Cas.”
Cas beamed, and it was moments like then where I realized that while he might’ve corrupted me with his innocence, I’d infested him with my rudeness and my sarcasm, and sometimes it really did catch me off guard.
“Oh...that’s great to hear…” I murmured, exasperation evident in my voice. Evidently, that false closure I’d gotten hold of the night before had come far too late, and by the time I had to start my day, I’d gotten merely half the appropriate amount of sleep and the side effects of such a change were making themselves evident in my features. I’d realized the state I was in just before leaving for work that afternoon, but my foolish and apparently selective optimism had managed to convince me that it wasn’t all that bad, that it wasn’t too noticeable. At that point, the only thing frustrating me more than the frequent interruptions was my own stupidity and my one-night stand with insomnia.
“That’s all we can ask for these days,” Cas said into Dean’s cheek.
“I’m just trying to convince you to act on it,” She went on, her voice increasing in severity. “I don’t want you and your lack of people skills--which I do love you for, don’t get me wrong--to get in the way of a real chance here, okay?”
“It’s...getting rather cold out there, isn’t it?”
“I swear,” Kevin called now from the opposite side of the main room, kneeling underneath one of the larger booths as he reached for the spray bottle he’d placed atop the table. I watched with the smallest inkling of a grin across my face as his hand fumbled for the object and listened to his complaint,
Kevin gulped before replying with a shaking tone, “It wasn’t anything about that Dean guy, was it? Cuz if so, I’m sorry man. I didn’t think it really mattered, or else I wouldn’t have brought it up.”
With a flick of my wrist, I flung Dean’s drink to him from across the bar, its underside screeching against the wood and dragging the moisture it had accumulated out in a cold, wet stream, and it landed just outside his fingertips, like the vacant version of the glass had done to me earlier that night. There must’ve been something different about my demeanor in doing so, however, because we’d finally met eyes and he was sending me a trying, inquisitive, yet overwhelmingly sly look, as if he was daring me to say whatever it was that was ghosting my lips, trying to pry my mouth open. Eventually my self control had worn too thin and the sound of my own voice, a sharp contrast to Dean’s, was echoing throughout the pub before I could convince myself otherwise and draw away.
Dean Winchester didn’t change or shift his line of vision until he’d reached his destination, perched himself heavily onto a barstool at the very far right corner of the bar, away from all other life forms, the motion earning a great, hefty creak from the chair’s structure, placed his hands on the counter, loosely folded, and let out the most minute yet poorly concealed sighs of what I hoped wasn’t despair that I’d heard pass his lips. I tried my hardest to reassure myself that everything was okay, feeling the quakes of a nervous terror bloom somewhere in that part of e that had accepted Charlie’s incessant theories, and would’ve been successful in doing so, had Dean’s head remained cast down and had I not dared to approach him in the way I was so obligated to do.
“Not really. I was just the average one of the group, which is fine by me. My brothers are all so different that it made life rather awkward. I like just being me, no matter how normal I am. It’s easier that way.”
“THIS!” Sam exclaimed. “THIS is why it all is so fucking hard. THIS is what is holding you back!” Suddenly I saw the bottle be flung from his grasp, cascade to the floor, and the rest of its contents spill onto the shag flooring in one large, damp spot. I watched it seep inward with too much attentiveness as the scene played out in front of me, and I felt Bobby’s laser-like gaze burn its own hole into the back of my head. What was he waiting for, me to step in?
“Yes, of course,” I replied. “It...it seems like this was rather out of the blue though, if you don’t mind me saying so.”
She sighed, shoulders going lax, and rolled her blue eyes that were so bright and excited and correct that I could barely look away before calling out to me her famous last words before I inevitably changed my life,
The leather of my jacket touched down on my shoulders before I even knew I’d picked it up in the first place. It’s touch startled me into sudden awareness of my audience and their gobsmacked expressions, as well as my Dad’s version of a reply that I would be lying, again, if I said I didn’t expect.
“N-no, it’s alright, I can handle it,” I replied, keeping my tone as level as possible, though judging by the way her eyes met mine, lit up with mischief and amusement at my expense, she was perfectly aware of the mental strain she was forcing onto my already weakened shoulders, since I was presently carrying Dean’s load. “I wouldn’t want to put Kevin on the spot, of course.”
Her distressed face dropped into one of grateful relief, but her thank you was drowned out by her chugging the drink’s contents in moments, excited by the lack of money she would have to depart with that night. I felt like an enabler, to a point, but also soothed. Hopefully a night of breaking and letting loose would be what she needed to start back up again, to give her that necessary kick of motivation in her step to help her through her troubles. But, in the end, all I probably did was sprout an alcohol problem.
What in hell had John Winchester said?
Now, in the present time, I had found myself rather attached and interested in a girl of twenty two who had long, dark dreadlocks in her hair and who smelled fiercely of cigarettes and tears. The scent was fitting: she had a cigarette near its end in her left hand and her right hand was busy drying her eyes, smearing her deep purple makeup in the process, and I couldn’t help but feel my stomach lurch with sympathy at the sight of her. After merely one drink she’d had no trouble telling me the source behind her trembling lip and drippy eyes. She’d just been fired from her job as a secretary and it was the only source of income she had to support her younger sibling, for their father had abandoned them after their mother died tragically in a car accident.
Charlie was wrong. She was only pulling my leg.
“Dean!” Sam exclaims.
He didn’t mind one single solitary bit and sat up straight at the thought of his own vehicle, which I could tell he worshipped and loved like a partner by the look in his eyes. It was hard not to smile at the adoration...or not to smile in adoration.
“What I need...is some booze, some time to destress, probably some pretty lady to help pass the time, and, well, more booze. And I’ll be fine. End of story.”
Even slurred and hardly distinguishable, his words sent rolls of fear up and down my spine and cemented my feet further into the hardwood underneath my shoes. Talking or explaining myself seemed out of the question at that point, and I realized this upon noting the dryness of my tongue and palette, so I left it up to Dean to continue the exchange. He’d started it, of course, and before long he delivered once more.
“Uh, sure, Bobby. I can do that,”I agreed, solemnly. “What time were you thinking?”
“So, K.C., what’s this I hear about you becoming a priest…?” Charlie teased, plainly illuding to the names that the drunken phony had called me, and with a glance in his direction I saw that he was now singing some sort of psalm I could recall from my distant childhood.
“I bet it gets pretty annoying,” he finally concluded, but he didn’t seem very satisfied with his ending statement and dumped the remainder of the conversation’s weight onto my suddenly unable shoulders, which were still quaking much like my knees.
Dean sent me another one of his quizzical looks, still without judgement though, and I suddenly remembered how abnormal our collection of names sounded to those outside of the family, and even me when I was forced to list them aloud. I quickly hashed out an explanation, eager to avoid much talk on the subject of my siblings. Just like their personalities weren’t easy to handle, neither was my telling of our history together.
Parts of me had been hoping he’d show up before the following Thursday, which was still a torturous five nights away, but if he did, that would break what little sense I’d found in him: his pattern. Other than my flimsy theory of him enjoying cars, his Thursday night presence was the only thing I had to hold onto, and it wasn’t enough.
“Tell Castiel I said hello, will ya? Hope he’s keepin’ ya busy.”
I swallowed, composed myself, and humored him, as he asked me to, because I was always there for Dean Winchester and willing to do whatever it was that he needed without any protest.
“Ah, I see, Novak. You’re not interested in that suburban lady at all!” She chortled.
As I said though, I’d missed something important. It came in the form of the door bell clanging over the Friday night commotion, like a beacon throughout the decipherable chaos, in the form of a tall, more than six-foot figure walking with heavy, stomping footsteps to escape the cold, and in the form of familiar green eyes, freckles, and a sad slump that I’d hoped had vacated his system. Something had brought it back…
I wasn’t lying, at least not at that point in time. But immediately after those words had passed my lips, I began thinking too much and regretted letting Dean bring my family up. The flashbacks gave me too big of a headache to focus much and I had to be concentrated if I wanted to succeed, and at that point it seemed as though Dean was racing ahead of me. I was left helplessly struggling to keep up while I was swimming through the sound of each of my brothers’ voices, confused as to why I could remember Michael’s most vividly and Gabriel’s the least.
“N-no, nothing like that…” I whimpered. It was like being cornered by two equally as impending and strong foes: one being Charlie knowing what had really deprived me of my sleep, and my denial making her frustrated and angry with me.
Dean’s vision flicked upward with more speed than he’d shown in the whole six minutes and forty-one seconds he’d been at the bar, and I saw the lights of recognition illuminate somewhere in his pupils, a satisfying process to watch. I noted the easing of his expression, evident in the lessened crease of his brow and the relaxation of his jaw. He was relieved to see me, and it nearly floored me.
I was growing frustrated with the large gaps in her reasoning, and maybe I was dwelling to intently on a matter that was just meant to swallowed, but I couldn’t fight the fiery, curious inkling dinging somewhere in the back of my mind like that damned front door’s bell.
It was an honest answer, and one that applied to him as well. I wondered if he was intuitive enough to pick up on that. I wanted to doubt his abilities, perhaps in a vain attempt to make me feel more secure in the current situation, but I still wasn’t allowing any assumptions. They would just make me look more like a fool than I’d already accomplished in the short window of time Dean had been in my company that night.
“Dad, are you KIDDING ME right now?!” Sam shouted, with desperation flooding into his voice, but Dad ignored him without so much as a pause in his relentless output of denial and defense.
“C’mon, you know exactly what I’m getting at. Why all the interest in him? And don’t deny it like last time! I’m not fooling around here.”
“Very much so...to be quite honest,” I answered, unable to fight the pull my current emotions had on the corners of my mouth, drawing them up into my cheeks to form the smallest, most discreet of smirks. I could see from the outskirts of my peripheral vision that the same expression was written across the face of my companion but, yet again, it didn’t mix well with whatever anxiety was flooding his system, and I remembered my original mission: I had to discover what was so plainly wrong.
My dad had never met someone quite like Castiel Novak, and had never experienced the same emotions I still was, even as the street the pub Castiel worked at came into view over the horizon. He’d never had someone listen and be there for him like Cas had for me in the short amount of time that I’d known him, and that’s where we were different. I had a positive purpose in traveling almost religiously to my new favorite pub, while my dad possessed no such thing. I knew a familiar face there and relished every second I got to spend time with it, while my dad simply went to get fucked up.
It’s not an excited kind of happy. My blood didn’t pump swiftly through my veins and arteries and there isn’t some life-changing event waiting to happen at the end of each day. It wasn’t the kind of happy I felt during those compromising situations I’d mentioned earlier, though that sort was definitely new and very much appreciated. It wasn’t even the calm sort of happy, like the time Cas and I traveled to Virginia to see the beaches because apparently he’d never gotten the chance to touch ocean water and nothing could beat the look in his equally as oceanic eyes when he stepped barefoot into the soggy sand along the shore. No, it wasn’t any of those kinds of happiness specifically, it was some kind of inexplicable mix of all of them together.
Was that it?
But Dean Winchester didn’t seem to care.
It looked like the honesty that was bubbling inside of me, now poured out into the small bit of atmosphere between Dean and I, was having its effects on my counterpart, because the grin already on his face became even more relaxed, even more at peace, flattered, red, and for the first time I didn’t profusely regret saying something of sentiment out loud to the one person who deserved such statements the most. He’d taken it well; he’d taken it mutually.
“You couldn’t have controlled or changed my deal with the Empty, Dean. Why do you insist on bearing responsibility for it?”
It was the simple joy of assurance, of safety, of just be able to be and live in peace and enjoy all the little things that came with that. Sometimes it was a Hallmark kind of life, like our beach adventures and all the meals Cas liked to have outside, perched on a sheet under a tree, sometimes it was something far more racy and intense than that, and sometimes just the chance to look at Castiel at work was enough to turn my insides to mush and my head go blank with love that 13 months, two weeks, six days, and a good twenty minutes past seven hours ago I would’ve told you didn’t exist. That’s what Castiel Novak could do to a person, I suppose.
“Don’t Fridays get kinda boring though?” he inquired with something close to a scowl as he observed the remaining customers now spread out far and wide across the hardly vast landscape we both were standing in the center of. “I mean, it seems like the same kinda people come in over ‘n over again.”
“Heh...I appreciate your concern then.”
It wasn’t until the chime of the doorbell had long since ceased and Dean Winchester had seated himself in front of me that my eyes regained their full vision and I was able to physically respond to the new party of one. He looked up at me with the same ironic, fake smile and sparkling eyes full of more stories to tell, and that alone was enough to spark energy within me, set my interest and deadly curiosity ablaze, and I fought hard to ignore Charlie’s earlier remarks that were singing their tune of accuracy in the back of my mind like an ear worm. She wasn’t right, she was only pulling my leg like she always did.
“That’s not my fault,” I retorted, pursing my lips and just waiting to see what he’d say.
“Please,” I mouthed, sure that our father wouldn’t see.
“What’s gotten into her?” He demanded, teeming with concern. “What’d you guys talk about?”
“Bobby Singer? Old dude, baseball cap, smells like liquor ‘n smoke?” he prompted. I’d forgotten to answer after getting so embarrassingly distracted.
“That’s bull. C’mon, what’s your life like? Got any siblings?”
I had little time to dwell on our odd friendship though, because I had a job to do and I felt guilty for ignoring Dean for so long. For what is was worth, however, he probably wouldn’t have been very happy to hear our conversation if it had continued on while I served him, so I’d chosen the best of a bad situation. But now there were no more reasons to avoid him, no more secret opportunities to gaze at and analyze him from afar, and no more time to busy myself with other mindless activities. I needed to truly interact with Dean Winchester, and once the decade long walk to where he was seated ended, I forced a few words of apology and politeness from my throat.
“That’s it? That was what I’ve been waiting this whole damn time for?” She exclaimed, now approaching me and slapping a hand on my forearm. I nearly flinched from the blow’s intensity.
“You’ve…you’ve got a shirt in the trunk,” Sam declares, an archaeologist discovering the apex of his quest. “Wait here,” he instructs. “I’ll grab it. You’re full of…
“I mean, I know Sammy’s happy, so I couldn’t have screwed up too badly, but...shit, I don’t know,” he breathed. The color across his cheeks had deepened as the amount of alcohol he consumed increased, and each time he spoke he revealed more and more until he really was becoming the open book every other person I served was, the open book I’d wished he’d been upon meeting him for the first time, but now I couldn’t ignore the gratification that came with earning his trust over time.
As predicted, Charlie was now standing behind the bar, rubbing her hands clean on a rag as she motioned to ghost story boy with not anger, disappointment, or annoyance in her eyes, but a the look of all-knowing, of victory, and snide. My teeth ground against each other in anger and just the general misfortune of the moment. It was very conflicting to have Dean there, off schedule, and be so unrequitedly happy about it, but also be cursing the inconvenient time.
He paused, sighed, and ran his hands across his reddening face.
Dean’s never had the courage to do what Cas did three days ago. Dean’s never said that to anyone, not really. Because it feels like a lie when it comes out. Dean’s love is so huge that it doesn’t physically fit into words.
My thoughts were distracting me. I stopped myself from walking out into a busy street, full of cars buzzing both ways, when I heard two drivers engage in a particularly angry exchange from the stop light about how driver A had cut driver B off, and apparently driver B “couldn’t give two shits,” which didn’t go over well with his companion. I had to side with driver A, of course, because it was common courtesy to apologize for one’s reckless driving. So I stood at the edge of the sidewalk, toes peeking over the curb as I rocked back and forth in wait for the volley of vehicles to cease, and pulled my trench coat further across my shoulders and into my chest. It was just occurring to me then that the last of fall was fading away, along with its red and orange and yellow coloring, though I suppose the stop lights and electric colored cars would suffice as fall foliage. Living in the city prohibited much of nature’s natural progression of the seasons.
From the outskirts of my vision I saw Sam let out a long sigh and run his hands through his hair, the hair that he still hadn’t cut even when I’d insisted he keep it at a reasonable length all throughout his time in high school, and had a sudden, bittersweet flashback to all the times I’d given my younger brother haircuts. I assumed that my late mother had given him his very first haircut, since he’d been born with with a head of hair that quickly accumulated into the smaller version of what it was today, but I’d snipped away at his messy mane countless times over the years. One occasion stuck out the most to me, an occasion upon which three whole inches of dirty blonde was removed, was the first time Sam had asked me where Dad was.
“Perhaps a little bit of both…?” I suggested with mostly sarcasm, and the joke was well-received. I soon corrected myself by saying, “No, nothing like that. I’m just able to tell when a friend appears to be sad.”
The Dean that I was being faced with then, the one with the sad eyes, slouching shoulders, crumbling walls and inability to find any worth in himself, was the aftermath of his trip to his father’s. Bobby had been right, and now his words weren’t only echoing in my ears like a flashback, they were being blared against my eardrums like a megaphone was inches away. I didn’t wince from the volume, however, just my stupidity and ignorance, as well as my shattered hopes. I’d thought, maybe since Sam and Dean had reunited and reconciled well, that the same luck and family-born love would transfer to the second of visits, but I’d been very wrong. The evidence was refraining from staring me in the face, of course, but it was just as plain to see nevertheless.
“Oh, a guy you met at the bar, you say?” Sam continued, and all the glares in the world wouldn’t get rid of the gleam his own eyes possessed, the one that knew he’d backed me into what he considered to be a pretty amusing corner, and I rarely agreed.
“Never thought priests would come and hang at local pubs…” Kevin murmured to me as he entered behind the bar with a damp, darkened towel in his hand and a line of sweat across his brow.
Dean swallowed and his throat stretched, contracted, and ceased movement, but not before I’d memorized each fluctuation and each step in the process. He blinked twice and then stared, but not before I could paint a mental picture of the long lashes on each of his eyes. And his lips moved to speak, parting slightly before retreating back as if lost on words to say, but not before I could trace the ridges on their surface with my eyes.
Eight o’clock was better than never. The pub didn’t close until one in the morning, this I knew for a fact, so I could easily carve out some time to see Cas. It would be even more similar to the old Thursdays.
“Hell no. After doin’ alright in high school, I was done being taught things like that. Just wasn’t something that I was into.”
“Hello, Kevin. I’m not late, am I?” I asked, checking my watch.
“Is everything alright?”
Instead of my hurried pace improving the amount of time it took me to properly adjust my belt, my fingers only continued to fumble along its surface, and it wasn’t finally secure until the leathery source of my mental torment had sat down on a barstool, this one closer to his fellow bar dwellers than before, let out several puffs of anger, and taken his time to run his eyes up and down my figure, examining just what the hell I was doing.
thing. I was dealing with it, but when you…when you…”
Dean didn’t seem to agree with me, however, and shook his head no rather furiously, hinting that perhaps his previous drink was now beginning to affect him. I liked to think that it was helping him bring forward and unveil the hurt and the wounds he was trying to hard to conceal.
“Yes?”
I don’t think I answered in the way that was appropriate, which would be something resembling a “you’re welcome,” and there followed a brief yet awkward silence that I felt sting the air around me until my scrambling for something to help the conversation resurface. Unfortunately, Dean’s passion was not something that I found myself well-versed in.
“Heh...I...I don’t have much good news to bring to the table today…”
After a few torturous hours of guesswork, half-hearted conversations with people of all shapes, sizes, and stories, and several glasses of scotch without any ice, I glanced at the clock hanging just above the bar’s back wall to see that it was just about closing time. After bidding Charlie farewell, telling her I would do the honors of closing up again, I made my tentative way back over the Dean to bring him the news. We needed to close up shop and, yet again, he was the last person in the now dimly lit and nearly silent pub. The only noises to be heard were the faint sipping of Dean’s lips along the the rim of his glass and the minute clinking of the dishes I was putting away against each other. The sounds were so solitary and singular that they were enough to discomfort my ears.
When I placed the bottle on the counter and went in search for a sufficient glass, I heard Dean let out something of a snicker and froze, wondering if I’d gotten something wrong already, but it seemed entirely impossible. Every time I’d served him he’d ordered a scotch without any ice, no questions asked, but now my throat was burning and my stomach was flipping over itself in the torturous suspense over what his laugh meant.
“No, don’t apologize, especially not for something you enjoy. It’s admirable, really.”
“And how do you feel about it?” I questioned, trying to remain as neutral a party as possible as not to put thoughts into his head or offend him by disagreeing. “About Sam coming to see you and your father?”
“See ya man. Have a nice night.”
Everyday that I got to wake up with Castiel beside me had the potential to be great, of course.
The rest of the evening played out in a similar manner. I received a text from Charlie, asking if Kevin had let me know about her absence and that he’d been the one to inform me because I only ever checked my phone around seven o’ clock. I replied with a “yes i am aware,” but felt a little agitated about my newly found predictability. The cause of such agitation, however, quickly switched sources when I slid my finger across the “read” button to see what her reply would be.
Dean continued to ramble on about his reluctance to be so “touchy,” apologizing several times over for his dumping of problems and reassuring me he wasn’t so emotional all the time, that he had a backbone, that it was the alcohol talking, and maybe I would’ve believed him, had I not done such a great job in understanding his quirks.
“Besides your father, what has you so worried?” I asked, rather starkly, suddenly determined to find the basis of the problem, the root of his fear, desperate to lure the right words from his mind and attempting to steer clear of coming off as too persistent, too insensitive, because that was the last thing from my fast-paced, racing mind.
“What’s got you up at night then? This is highly out of character for you, don’t cha think?” Charlie continued as she cocked her head to the left in interrogation, and I wished her concern would leave so she would too and so I could get on with my day. I wasn’t excited to slave through a Friday night shift and deal with so many predictables at once when my mind was clearly and entirely elsewhere, and other people’s pestering was certainly not making it any easier, even though it was Charlie and I knew I owed her several benefit-of-the-doubts.
“Sounds good.”
Dean Winchester had long since entertained internal monologues. They weren’t productive. All of a sudden, however, he was encountering his last thoughts, yet even
I’d even failed Sammy then by leaving him to fend for himself in that hellhole of a home, a home that would be vacated by its current dweller in the next four weeks or so, and then this entire process would be repeated again, eventually, the difference being the fact that my younger brother may just have to do it alone. I couldn’t pinpoint what exactly it was that had made Dad’s words sting so much or what had made Sam’s defense of me so hard to listen to, but there was no way I was capable of putting myself through it again. There wasn’t much point. Obviously it was clear that I was a failure in my father’s eyes, I was letting my brother down once again at that very second, and the only other friend I thought I had had sat in almost full silence as I’d been torn apart.
Dean’s expression changed, the corners of his mouth drawing upward into a sad sort of halfway-there grin, but instead of the small indication of happiness inspiring the same sort of emotion within me, it brought a secondhand kind of nostalgia, and I knew Dean was imagining Sam explaining to him just what he was interested in doing with his life. I imagined that his older brother was one of few people that Sam was able to confide in.
In no time at all Dean had put the glass to his lips and was letting the slightly-less-than-deadly poison into his system, and I was left to observe in a tense, solitary silence. Often times I’d wondered what it’d be like to have just one singular customer on a Thursday night, but my curiosity had not been so daring as to ask for that lone soul, the one that just happened to be the epicenter of my current turmoil, frustration and fascination, to appear seated before me, oddly sociable and friendlier than usual. It proved to be a much too intense situation for me to enjoy and I was torn between wanting him to speak again, just so his low voice could fill in the quiet that had settled like dust, and knowing that I wouldn’t be able to handle it for very long.
And Dean knew this.
I placed my hands on the edge of the bar closest to me, directly across from Dean Winchester, and watched as he downed the last of his beverage in one foul swoop, the orange and brown liquid traveling down his gullet slowly and steadily. I liked to pretend that he didn’t see, or at least feel, me staring, but that was only wishful thinking.
Everything was background noise apart from my words of departure, which I mumbled in a tone so shaky and trembling so intensely that I barely recognized it as my own. It didn’t seem to do much to calm the storm my weak and somewhat vain attempt at a confession to my father had started. I doubt still that anyone else in the room, even Sam, had heard it, but it flew into the electric-infused space air around us that was being sucked in by angry lungs and returned with the fiery aftertaste of hurtful, long suppressed words. I even watched it fizzle out, just like the last of my spirits had the moment it crawled past my lips.
“Thank you, Dean...I would appreciate that,” were the words that I eventually settled on, said to my conversing counterpart as I looked him straight in the eye and without and sort of faltering. I meant what I said, and I began to hope Dean had meant what he’d had the nerve to say as well.
“It looks like something has upset you,” I announced. It was said more matter-of-factly than intended, but it got the point across. Everything about Dean’s outward appearance screamed inner turmoil; I was merely pointing out and observing what was obvious.
Upon receiving his latest beverage, Dean eyed it up thoughtfully, though I wasn’t sure what was so captivating about a glass of rusty liquid at the time, and clutched it firmly, his long fingers wrapping around its whole. And, in a volley of very deliberate and very desperate movements, he threw the drink back and swallowed it hole. The burn it must’ve caused couldn’t have been pleasant, but it was the result of that burning that Dean needed to get through his rendition of his childhood: an absent, worry-free mind, free of the chance of consequence.
Ring!
“Do you mean that?” Charlie whispered, breath as fleeting and chilled as the breeze cascading up and down my button-down’s sleeves, somehow touching down on my skin, and I was enveloped in goose bumps.
“That’s very ambitious,” I remarked. Sam Winchester was shaping out to be someone to idolize.
He was exhausted, more so than he had been before, to the point where the bags under his eyes had surpassed the normal shades of purple and had entered blues and blacks until they appeared to be pushed back into his angular face. His lips never shut entirely, a sign that he had little energy running in his system, and I could hear each deep breath he took like the air was rattling around somewhere in his lungs. Combined together, I estimated that it had been at least thirty-two hours since he’d gotten any time to sufficiently recharge.
She rolled her eyes, flung her arms into the air in exasperation, and looked as though she was seconds from grabbing me by the shoulders and shaking me vigorously back and forth. I hoped, if she did end up doing so, it would somehow insert the solution into my brain so I could fix the disaster I’d created before it was too late, and that didn’t alot me much time.
I shook my head the moment she ceased speaking, desperate to let her know that it was okay, fine, great, even, because even though her constant murmurings and sly smirks about Dean had made me want to rip my hair out piece by piece and strand by strand, they’d really helped me realize something. And, regardless of how ridiculous the something was, it meant a lot to me.
“I know you do.”
Flinging myself into my car, I switched on the radio and removed the Van Halen tape, trading it out of the angriest rendition of Iron Maiden songs I could find, and I drove in search of my place of solace. At a red light I wondered if the feelings running through my system then were at all like what my father had experienced every time he ran away in search of a drink to numb out his system, but quickly discarded the notion.
He was so intoxicated that I almost laughed, which would’ve painfully strange after having shared an act even more intimate than our endless stares from earlier, but the happiness lighting up his features, brightly enough to illuminate the darkness one one o’clock in the morning, was enough to make my head go blank with a bliss I couldn’t define nor describe. I knew, despite the drinks that I’d supplied him with, that this was for real and that such a bliss was overwhelmingly mutual. It was written all over his face, in the creases of his mouth, and across the lines of his hand’s palm.
And upon voicing my following question, I was met with a sound that I surely did not expect in the least: laughter. Dean Winchester was laughing. It was a laugh full of self-doubt, of a sense of failure, and the sense that he just couldn’t care less at that point in time, but it was a laugh nonetheless, and it was three times as loud as the doorbell had been each time I’d wanted to rip it from its position on the door. Fortunately, his laughter was not a noise that I wanted to be rid myself of.
I had thrown him quite the curveball by using his name as a tool to prompt him into sharing his story. Fortunately, by the time I got around to explain how I’d learned it in the first place, he was too far away from the knowledgeable light of sobriety to consider the general creepiness and oddity of it all, for I highly doubted memorizing the name on a driver’s license peeking out from someone’s wallet as their trying to pay is considered normal. To be quite frank, quite little of the situation I’d found myself in with Dean Winchester was considered normal by any means.
“Damn it...yeah, I know…” I muttered angrily and I arched my arm backwards to reach into my pants’ back pocket where my phone was ringing profusely and at the most inconvenient of times. Without reading the number displayed across its screen I answered the call, breathing my introduction heavily and awkwardly into the speaker until I was sure whoever was on the other end would be entirely convinced that I’d just been running some sort of marathon.
Cas props Dean against the barn’s exterior. To his right is a bale of hay, to his left a pitchfork, to his front a once-deceased angel looking as he did eons before. And he removes his grasp from Dean too suddenly, too confidently, as though it isn’t insanity incarnate that they were able to touch again in the first place.
It only took about another month to realize my less aged yet painfully more logical brother was right, and only another week after that to take his advice in full and build that wall of separation between father and son. I suppose a key piece in realizing there wasn’t much left to salvage between the two of us was his utter disgust and appallment at the fact that I was seeing someone, someone that he did not approve of in the least, and, much like Sam had given his ultimatum, my father gave me his. It consisted of many slurs and phrases I dare not repeat, and the stench of liquor rumbling deep within his throat. And, for the first time in my life, I truly got sick off the smell and decided to not put myself through it anymore.
That was it: the million dollar question, and the correct response attached to it like a pricetag was one that pained me to read aloud.
I could not pinpoint a location from which his interest was coming from, nor could I find a reason for his curiosity and inquisition, so my mind flatlined and settled on staring at him, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, until I should’ve weirded him out. It should’ve caused him to fade back into a reclusive silence, regretting even bothering to give me a chance, and he should’ve never flashed me his distracting grins or his forest-like stares.
It appeared as though Dean spent a long time contemplating my statement, and perhaps he was wondering whether I was worth his breath or not. Of course, I was appalled when he simply acknowledged my existence and I expected next to nothing in return, but the curiosity had worn down my logic and sanity until nothing but dust remained, and I had to know. I couldn’t hold back the obnoxiously loud sound of my voice that was startling the singular person it was directed towards.
“Nah, I’m changing into ‘fresher’ clothes, thank you very much-”
“Talked to that Cas guy, too. Weird fella,” he answered, itching the front of his head underneath the bill of his hat, along his hairline. “Seemed mighty excited to know I knew who you were.”
She had to know.
All traces of familiarity were gone in an instant, blown out like a candle, along with my doubt and whatever kind of gameplan I had. I almost couldn’t bring myself to look at Dean as he spoke, but there was no way I’d be physically able to look away. He’d caught me with his words and kept me with his green and brown hues and his, still present, brokenness. It wasn’t as strong then, seeing as though the night had begun, but I could still hear it rumble, its tremble. Though maybe that was just my shaking hands distracting me.
Dean swallowed and, suddenly, pushed his now empty glass forward, nearly sending it off the edge of the bar closest to me and I scrambled to catch it before it plummeted downward. After placing the glass in a safer position to be washed the next morning, I saw my companion begin digging through the inside pockets of his hefty jacket, his hands shuffling back and forth clumsily until they landed upon his wallet.
“Not a problem,” was my answer, and I was about to say my goodbyes when Bobby beat me to the punch, adding one last remark that made me want to reach through the phone and physically detract my acceptance of his favor.
“Okay, there’s two things wrong with that argument.”
“I’m alright, it didn’t mess me up too bad, but I’m so worried about Sammy. He grew up like that, right from the start.”
“That’s...damn it, that’s not what I meant, you asshole,” I grumbled, though was trying my best to share in the laughs.
But, in terms of Dean Winchester, there was little optimism to be found in the world. It was a rare occurrence to hear laugh or see him grin ear to ear, almost impossible without the aid of alcohol, and I guess that’s where that illogical hope was blooming out of. I couldn’t ignore it, of course. It was swelling up in the pit of my stomach, making my limbs tremble and twitch with excitement until I had to steady myself as I poured the pretend-deacon another glass of whatever his poison of choice was, I don’t remember, and each creak in the floorboards, mumble of a hello, or any such sign of an entrance enveloped every ounce of my attention until I realized Dean was nowhere to be seen. I would then proceed to sigh, ignore my coworker’s giggles, and carry on glumly.
“I’ve sure heard that before.”
“Well is his face covered in blood or something? You’re lookin’ like you’ve just seen a-”
I chuckled, ruffling his freshly cut hair until it stuck up in frayed bunches at the sides of his head.
"Do you need me to call a taxi?" I inquired anxiously. He definitely was not fit to drive.
“You’re tellin’ me…” he began, letting his hands cascade down his face as if to wipe away the stress and exhaustion that had accumulated atop his brow. “I haven’t seen the kid in what, like two years? I have no idea what he’s thinking, coming down to visit now…”
“Yes, Charlie, I’m alright,” I replied, sending the source of the voice the most sincere of smiles and head-nods.
I gave her another look of exasperation, sighing at Charlie’s never ending flow of sly remarks but surprisingly warm and kind advice, but didn’t mean it in the negative, denial-laced way in which I had before. It took a great deal of effort not to smile, and an even greater amount of effort not to consider her bogus suggestion. Upon receiving my gaze, my redhead companion broke out into a fit of giggles, releasing me from her grasp and holding her stomach as she did so, and when she turned to leave and enter the kitchen, she clapped me hard on the back.
Several instinctive answers battled to reach the surface, fought for domination and victory. The first was the defense: Dean was nothing more than a regular of mine, a face I could recognize and a story I could retell, much like the hundreds of other passerbyes I got the chance to meet, and there was nothing special about him and our abnormal sort of connection. The second was complete denial, the kind of dismissal that drove Charlie up walls and merely egged her on to pry deeper and deeper, until she reached whatever well of information she needed and danced in the leaking waters. For her sake, that would’ve been the first one I hid and drew back into the swell, but the third instinct proved to be the most problematic:
“Dude, you gotta be kiddin’ me! Your big bro knew what he was talkin’ about.”
“I’m meeting the boys at their dad’s house tomorrow...and that’s sure to be exciting. Not the good kind, either.”
“So, with that out of the way...mind hookin’ me up?”
“I…I need to –”
“Dean...what’re you…”
“I got home at two in the morning, Dean,” He reprimanded me, his peevish tone of voice not enough to distract me from his shifting, until he was nearly on top of me, hands against my wrists with a smile struggling to appear along his pale face, an expression contrary to the mood he was trying to convince me he was in.
Even if I wanted to speak up, even if I wanted to voice whatever inner demons I’d had locked in some backwards hall of my heart, I wouldn’t know where to start. I didn’t know how to break away from my dad’s grip, how to pry open his fingers from around my shoulders and throat until the force left pinkened fingerprints in my skin. And perhaps the reaction was psychosomatic, but I felt my own hands crawl upwards along my neck and rest on its back, fitting in the place where those markings had appeared so many years ago.
I knew that the stuttering in my dad’s speech was brought on by nothing but the lack of oxygen in his brain and the poison making its own way through his bloodstream, but I liked to entertain the thought of his words failing him. This argument, like I said, had happened many times before, and each time I allowed myself to pretend that my father was failing in putting together full, coherent sentences because he knew what Sam was saying had some right to it. And yet, at the same time, I wished Sam would shut up. There was just nothing in the world to gain from the yelling and I couldn’t bear to think of him leaving again, being thrown from my dad’s latest dwelling, and finish the deja-vu session I was trapped in.
Soon I found my elbows leaning up against the bar’s surface with Dean’s robust hands in between them, clasped loosely together, with his own forehead no more than six or seven inches apart from my own, and story upon story came flowing from his lips like the floodgates in his head had been torn away, blown into nonexistence, and I took every word in like it was the last I would ever hear. There were times where I struggled to remember each one, because getting lost in the whisper of a usually gruff voice was very easy to do, but if asked I could probably recite everything that was told to me in order.
“Cars are something you’re passionate about, then?” I chimed in, wanting to confirm my theory once and for all, but mostly just wanted to hear him say what I knew aloud.
“Of-of course not. I was just...just…”
Snip-snip. I decided to block out his complaints and his interview-like inquiries for the time being so I could concentrate. I didn’t need anyone remarking about my poor haircut job because the subject had been talking my ear off the whole time, but I could feel Sam’s searing hazel eyes stare at the top of my head in the mirror as I worked, probably searching for the answer he was looking for in my mere body language, in the way I stood, or the way I spoke. I’d long since concluded that he was one of the most observant people I’d ever known.
“I am not into him, Charlie!” I exclaimed, a little too loudly. The moment the words passed my lips, every muscle in my body seemed to tense in fear of the conversation catching the subject’s attention, but with a millisecond glance in his direction, I saw him still in his painful silence, scrolling through his cellphone. I knew I needed to go and get him a drink, be a courteous bartender and do my job, but Charlie was being much too persistent and the beating in my chest made so much noise he was sure to hear it if I approached him.
It was Sunday now, four-twenty-seven PM, and the street had finally cleared itself of bustling vehicles and drivers shouting profanities from the luxury of their interior, leather-bound seats. I walked to the opposite side, being sure to walk within the white walls of the crosswalk, and against the cold breeze of foreboding whiteness and ice. The pub was located at the corner of Ash street, the street to which I was walking towards, and I could see through the frosty windows that the lights were already gleaming through the front room and another co-worker of mine was scrubbing furiously at each table in the hasty and desperate manner that he seemed to do everything in.
“What, just can’t let me tip you? Came to hand over the excess cash?” he teased, laughing at his own nagging joke while still maintaining the desire to know what in the world had possessed me to brave the cold and speak to him. I didn’t even have a good answer myself, so I settled on the first emotion to cross my mind:
“I was merely returning the hello, Dean. Nothing more than common courtesy.”
“I know.”
It had been months since I’d seen my father in person, going on a year, actually, and while I sent him monthly checks to make sure he had some sort of roof over his head, and while I still thought about what exactly it was that I was leaving behind (before I met Cas, the definition of family was something that I ashamedly held onto, and it was a hard thing to have torn from one’s grasp.), it didn’t hurt quite as bad as I’d expected it to. It was liberating at times, especially when those times were spent with elbow grease and a mix of oil and sweat running down my forehead, or hearing of all the wild campus stories Sam had to tell me, usually only consisting of something a professor told him, because he was never truly able to shake the “teachers’ pet “ title since at least the fourth grade, or leaning against the bar I’d come to know so well in my signature spot, chatting up the redhead waitress in a way that was entirely casual and friendly while I snuck every chance I could get to talk to the dark-haired, blue-eyed bartender,
I wondered when my knees would give out for good, or when the wiring in my head that kept me sane and socially able would permanently fry up, or when the flushing of my neck and cheeks would completely blow my cover, the cover that I still wasn’t ready to admit to myself all the way. I knew that if Dean kept saying things of that caliber, regardless if he was serious in his words or not, the end would be fast approaching. Hopefully he didn’t notice the way my fingers were digging into the bar’s edge for support until my knuckles were white with the pressure.
I saw his tongue flick over and around his lips, as if he was collecting his choice of words, while his eyes were still trained everywhere but on my own.
but break the shape when Cas turns his head to the left – always the fucking left – and drags his hand down to Dean’s shoulder.
“And then there’s me,” I concluded, eager to snap out of memories that I hadn’t gotten the chance to think about or relive in ages, and I remembered why.
I cut her off by placing a few more inches of distance between us and sending her the most intimidating stare I could, given my current mental state. Any other day I would be able to suffer through her jokes, maybe even enjoy them to an extent, but I had a mission that needed carrying out. A game that needed to be won as soon as possible.
“You know I don’t judge. Hell, I have no room to judge-”
I was getting better at picking up on his jokes and humor, and I heard myself utter what sounded similar to a laugh, the noise so foreign to me that I felt as though it had come from somewhere outside of myself.
“I think you’re the only person.”
“Nah, don’t feel bad for the lady. If the husband cheated, especially with a dude, it obviously wasn’t meant to be between them.”
“Why do I even bother?”
But then a strange scent made its way towards me, teasing my memory and wrapping its fumes around my mind until the picture to go with it faded from the smoke into clarity. Gasoline and car grease.
Just as quickly as the ID had appeared, it vanished and was slid back into its designated pocket inside his ages wallet as this Dean character slapped down the necessary amount of cash needed to pay for the last couple beverages he'd consumed. In fact, the wad of money he'd forcefully placed on the counter was about five dollars more than what was required, and as I carefully took the green slips of paper in my hands and began counting out the change, I was alarmed for a second time in no longer than a minute and a half…
“I-I didn’t screw up!” he shouted and his voice reached its peak volume, just as I reached my absolute limit.
Friend.
“no, i’m just messing with u. i’ll leave u to ur bartending duties. adios castiel :)”
The walk in the chilled rain had started at the pub, after I’d closed up shop for the fourth day in a row since Charlie’s want to alleviate me of the task seemingly evaporated into thin air and memory, once the clock had chimed one in the morning and Dean Winchester had left the premises a little more sober than usual. I liked to attribute the increased amount of coherent thoughts and the lack of dangerous alcohol pumping in his system to the awkward yet slightly charming and kind conversation we’d kept going for the better part of two hours. It was one of the few pleasantries that kept my spirits from falling into the murky puddles below my feet on my journey homeward.
“Why is it so damn hard to get close to you? To be enough for you? To please you? To be the ‘son you always wanted?’ Have any idea?”
I grimaced and bit my lower lip, a way much less sensual than what had been done in the minutes earlier, and immediately my eyes flicked down to Cas. Predictably, he’d heard the proposed favor and while he didn’t look entirely happy about it, he nodded his head as an “okay,” and I mouthed a silent,
“Of course I’m not interest-” I retorted, temporarily oblivious to her intentions and the meaning behind her words.
He looked truly, perpetually guilty, and Kevin Tran was someone it was just impossible to be any sort of upset with, seeing as though he followed through on every favor, every task, and every job asked of him with at least one-hundred and ten percent effort, and I couldn’t hold it against him anyways. The confrontation was bound to happen eventually, I should’ve seen it coming the previous night, and it wasn’t like he was the one asking the questions. Charlie was the one who deserved my anger and my frustration, as well as all the mind-boggling thoughts and question circling in my brain like vultures, waiting for the next event to occur and die out so they could swoop in and pick away at it.
“I don’t mind it much.”
“No...no, it’s quite alright,” I answered. My hands had drawn away from his after sensing that we’d brushed knuckles, and they now were stuffed violently into the pockets of my pants. “I’m glad you’re here.”
He looked sad, distressed, and very much broken and exposed. The angry had transformed into a raw kind of helplessness, the side effect most borderline, or full-blown, alcoholics, tended to forget about in my experience. His face hung loosely, unable to contain any true emotion in his face other than that lost and bored kind of depression, and I could only imagine what the waves and waves of intoxication looked like as they swirled inside of him. Certainly what was on the outside was nothing compared to within.
That didn’t even make any sense.
I did mean it. I meant in every possible way, truth, context, and situation, but it suddenly became six times more difficult to admit out loud again once my intuition told me the identity of the newest customer. Yet, perhaps it was the tightened grip on my shoulder accompanied by several heavy, distressed, and achingly familiar footsteps that snapped me back into my train of thought, back into reality, and back into my ability to speak.
“He did a hell of a lot more than just ‘be my brother,’ that’s for sure!” Sam spat. “You walked all over him. You let him pick up your pieces.”
Another thing that seemed to be becoming habitual, regardless of whether it was intentional or not, was my lack of a voice when forced into conversation with the illusive man leaning with shoulders hunched and breathing heavy just a foot of bar in front of me.
Finally, abandoning my efforts and pulling away from my sleep-deprived partner and rolling my eyes in defeat, I answered, glumly,
“Ya know, to be honest,” Dean began. The appearance of apology was no longer painted across his face or dulling the shine of his eyes, and I knew this for sure, because they were staring right at me. And, much like I had, Dean took in a mouthful of air before filling the anticipation-ridden silence with his gruff, deep, yet oddly sweet and charming way of speech,
“Bobby stopped by, right?” he added suddenly, after taking a smaller, shyer sip of his drink and I denied the fact that I watched his neck contract as he swallowed.
“That’s good to hear,” Cas answered, with a level of sweetness and honesty that only he could achieve,  before lowering himself down to press his lips against the corners of my own, breath warm and smile large, and he released his grip on my wrists as he spoke once more into my cheek,
would
“He’s probably savin’ up for one of those stupid Honda hybrid cars, the ones that look like mini-spaceships or something like that,” he said with disgust, but those undertones were echoing underneath his voice again, and I could hear the traces of that eternal brotherly love. “I always hate when someone brings one of those to the shop, ya know? Why not just go by a new one, if their mass-producing them so cheaply anyways.”
“I work down at our good friend Bobby’s auto shop now, fixing deadbeat cars and makin’ phone calls,” He said quickly after, as if attempting to defend himself in fear of making it look like he wasn’t all that important. I, in contrast to his belief, was utterly fascinated with his life and his life’s choices, as well as the fact that I’d been indisputably right.
I couldn’t marvel over the way Dean carried himself: with long strides but hunched shoulders, a sign that I took was of confliction, or the way his leather jacket fell expertly across his broad wingspan, or the way in which he downed drinks that caused the muscles in his throat to contract and release like the machine I’d so closely compared him to. Except, upon reconsideration, there was little mechanical about Dean. He was painfully human, and that’s where a lot of his problems seemed to lay, and that’s why I didn’t have time to daydream about such things. I was distracted by the fact that he’d had a childhood full of someone else’s, how his brother Sammy had essentially been dumped onto those very hunched shoulders, and how he’d never once complained. He still didn’t, twenty-two years later. And how, when Sammy left to do what Dean had encouraged him to chase after his whole life, the rest of Dean’s life had been shipped out to California along with his brother.
that, okay? I’m trying to tell you that I
“Yeah...I’m later than usual. Sorry about that.”
“Has it ever hit you?”
I did need someone to start it with, though, and even though the sleeping figure next me had only arrived there a good six hours prior, I was lonely and still a little irritated over the my lost two minutes of rest, so I was selfish and leaned in closer, kissing the sleeping pout off their face for it only to be replaced by a more intense, conscious one.
“N’ugh…” was my choice of grumbles as I pried myself out of the soothing solace of sheets and the familiar grasp of Cas’s arms and legs. In a few painful moments I’d emerged in full and was stretching my arms upward once more, causing my back to give a loud crack and creak of bones being dislodged from the night’s position, when I heard a snicker from behind me and turned around on a shaky heel.
I watched him as I conversed with a woman and her newlywed husband, both of which were seated three stools down from the mass of silence that Dean had no become, both clad in their wedding attire: a white, cascading gown and a crisp black suit. In a few minutes I’d gathered that they’d run away during their own wedding, feeling overwhelmed and pressured by the amount of guests and their families, and had tied the knot on their own in the park just down the street. I was a terrible person for not congratulating them to the degree that I should’ve, utterly terrible and inconsiderate and I could feel the guilt swelling up in the back of my throat, but it was no match for the curiosity.
I had to get through that day though, and upon reaching my favorite method of transportation, her surface shining and freshly cleaned after I’d given her the usual hand-cleaning at Bobby’s, I concluded that it wasn’t so bad. Driving to Bobby’s to work on cars all day wasn’t too bad, eating lunch with the best father figure I’d ever had wasn’t too bad, and driving no more than fifteen miles to Castiel’s place of work as often as possible wasn’t too bad either. In fact, when I thought about it, as I drived out of the parking garage, waving to a few familiar faces as I went, probably halfway recognizing their features from the pub, this life was exponentially not as bad as it had been just over a year ago, and that was a thought that could get me through the next twenty five years, let alone the upcoming few hours.
God, a man’s last thoughts were loud, only broken by Sam’s clammy palm reaching for Dean’s fully numb hand. Dean blinked at the touch. His eyelids were on fire. He smelled flesh and iron, somewhere faraway.
“Yeah, he’s an ambitious kid. It’s always worked out for him though.”
“Did he ever plan on it though?” He tested, raising his eyebrows. “Or was this another one of those ideas you went ‘n planted in his head, Dean?”
Dean agrees but fails to convey this.
“Well, that’s good then!” I answered. There was no blatantly toneless voice there. I was enthusiastic and engaging. “It never gets very nice around here anyways. A shame, really…”
I spent ages running it over in my head, even as I wiped the sticky away from the bar and made my rounds throughout the pub to clear away the remaining shrapnel from the night. I almost chuckled to myself as I bent underneath a table to retrieve several carelessly discarded napkins from the floor at how intensely captivated I was by this Thursday-bar-crawler, because they typically came and gone like passing scenery, scenery that just happened to inexplicably odd.
After pausing for a moment to consider what the rest of my answer would be, I made a rather split-second decision and decided to follow the advice I’d begged Dean himself to follow: confide in someone. Confide in a source you knew you could trust, one that was unbiased, and I knew if I was serious enough, Charlie would suffice just fine.
My first thought was that I wasn’t arguing, but the one that immediately followed was an overwhelming punch of hopelessness, like someone was forcefully holding my head under freezing water.
“Hm?” was my reply, still dazed and about ready to dissolve upon meeting Dean’s wide, romance novel-worthy eyes.
“If the husband cheated on her, he didn’t feel love between him and her like he should’ve. It wasn’t real then, ya know?”
The bell.
Dean is still gripping Cas’s coat.
“We ready? Shouldn’t be out too late, or we’ll freeze to death.”
“Well, nothing a few drinks can’t help, I suppose!”
“That probably sounded a bit creepy,” he confessed, rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment. Habit.
And I would’ve socked him right there, given him a piece of my mind, but I happened to care very deeply for the blue-eyed, slim-toned, eternally awkward yet now slightly more socially able, gentle, and simply kind bartender and goddamn angel lying pretty underneath me, so I settled on ruffling his hair and releasing him from my death grip. It was ten minutes past eight now, and I needed to get going.
“What the hell-”
“I thought you understood that I enjoy being able to listen to you. We went over this earlier!”
“It’s always been here. Before you, even, back when it was an even bigger secret. Always something I couldn’t have, so eventually I…I just told myself that I
“His homelife really must’ve been awful. His dad totally checked out, hm? You can’t do that to your kids, no matter what the situation is. I really hope his brother is alright, too...what was his name…?”
“Yes, very, but it’s nothing abnormal. It is Friday, after all,” was my answer. “Er, it was Friday. It’s twenty-two minutes into Saturday now.”
“Doesn’t bother me much.”
What he had just said, within the current context, along with the tone of his voice and the raise of his eyebrow gave me the discrete, barely-there impression that he was implying something other than simply kindness and the help to educate me further in what I considered to be an overly-masculine form of a pass-time. Flashbacks of Charlie’s countless lessons on social cues and the scary world of relationships came to mind, causing me to swallow hard and bite my tongue. That was a matter to be thought about a different and more private time.
There was no sense in lying: the fact that he was right was evident all over my face and in my mannerisms. His appearance had blown be backwards, thrown off my entire night, and yet, somehow, I managed to devote its remainder to him. It was funny to me how it all worked out.
“You were stupid for the right reasons.”
“I don’t believe it’s really the evening anymore…” I answered, but it wasn’t a serious reply, and I made sure to let Dean know this by giving him a brief, fleeting grin. He seemed to appreciate it and stopped rubbing the length of his fingers together so furiously.
Dean hears the trunk pop open.
I wiggled my way out of her grasp, now feeling another, more imperative pair of eyes staring at the back of my head, observing a scene I did not want him to witness one bit, but it couldn’t be helped. Dean Winchester arriving for a few drinks on what was now a hellacious pre-weekend night was the furthest thing from my mind only eleven minutes earlier, but now it was all I felt capable of thinking of. And, along with many other things that I did not care to admit to her, Charlie knew that, too.
Dean neither heard nor saw little of the time between his fourth, third, and second to last breaths, but the voices in his head raged. They sounded just like him, despite the former being way more impassioned and the latter unsettlingly jaded. As his stare slid down Sam’s person, their foreheads eventually colliding with a defunct
I couldn’t gage the level of boredom in his voice, because he seemed like the kind of person who, if made uninterested, would simply cease speaking. I counted a total of three sentences that he’d omitted from his mouth in one singular evening, and if that didn’t scream only a tolerable level of boredom, than I’m not entirely sure what does. But, since his latest reply was not one that I could do much with, I simply smiled and attempted to busy myself with other tasks while the amber liquid made its own slow way down Dean’s throat.
Where was I supposed to go then?
“But it’s my brother that I’m worried about. I just wish I coulda done more, made homelife a little less shitty. I owe him that much.”
“Bye Cas...and thanks for tonight.”
The previous time Dean Winchester had graced the pub with his presence, it took him about sixteen minutes to finish one drink. On this occasion, it had been approximately six minutes and he’d drained his glass about two thirds of the way, a rate that I couldn’t imagine felt physically pleasing in any way, shape, or form. I myself wasn’t a fan of scotch: it burned too intensely when it touched the inside of my throat. I must’ve felt like his own personal forest fire at the speed Dean was inhaling his beverage, and I couldn’t help but wonder if that was the point.
Maybe compliance wasn’t too bad when Dean was asking for it though, and his interest translated in my mind into some kind of stranger-to-stranger care, and maybe after all the people I’d had the pleasure, and sometimes the pain, of listening to, I could confide in someone else for a change. It wasn’t me who’d asked for it, of course. I was just answering Dean’s inquiries so as to prevent him from being an unhappy customer. My job.
Dean paused at the door as his right arm fell onto the frame for support. In a long, drawn out movement, he turned his figure around once more to face me, and the face I was met with was rather shocking and drastically different from its appearance at the start of that long night.
“I mean, I know we’ve had our rough patches for the past few months, er...years, maybe, but I was willing to work through it. I was willing to put the effort in!”
Dean Winchester is a man who had a passion for cars and worked on them often. He is a destructive person who drinks too much and liked to use alcohol as a remedy for his terrible anger. He doesn’t know how to deal with his emotions.
Dean Winchester and Castiel are standing under the cover of scant darkness together. Dean’s wounds are healed; Cas is clean of the Empty’s blackish sludge. Things feel real. They feel fair. His jaw relaxes.
The bell attached to the front door gave one last chime, the chime of closing and the chime of rest, before I was wrapped up in a firm silence of solitude. There was no creak of stressed floorboards under heavy feet, the clinking of beer bottle necks on beer bottle necks had ceased, the delirious laughter was but a mere ringing in my ears, and the poor, lonely, old lady with the dishwasher-neglecting husband’s seat suddenly looked painfully vacant and quiet. But, feeling the sticky surface of the bar underneath my drumming fingers, fingers drumming in thought, I noticed that I could still hear one sound echoing somewhere in my mind, a place that I couldn’t identify.
