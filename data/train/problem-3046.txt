The redhead that’s with the group whispers something to the blue eyed man, but he says nothing in response. Dean looks at the man for a moment too long before he sees his friend Charlie out of the corner of his eye.
An hour or so passes, and Dean finds himself just a little inebriated and ends up dancing with Sam and Charlie and the other guests. Gabriel and some of the other “angels” are even happily dancing with the crowd, but Castiel stands at the edge of the room, just watching. Dean, feeling even braver than usual thanks to the alcohol, makes his way over to the man and gestures at him questioningly.
Sam shrugs, sharing an amused glance with their mother, Mary. “It’s the easiest way to investigate them. We can’t just march into their house, but we can invite them into ours.”
Naomi smiles back. “But why would your parents raise you to be a hunter? Isn’t that dangerous for a child?”
“I’ll take the beer,” Castiel says after what feels like hours, and when Dean’s face lights up, all doubt Castiel feels melts away.
“Dean, you have to get away from Naomi,” Cas is telling him quickly. “She’s going to show up here any moment, but you- you can’t do what she says, it’s too much. I-”
Castiel searches his face for a moment before averting his gaze. “I’m sure you know the angels didn’t set up your brother’s kidnapping, but they let it happen. They believed it was necessary for the upcoming war. I tried to get them to leave you and your family out of it, but they insisted.”
“Ah, this is my nephew, Castiel Novak. He’s staying on the premises to help protect me,” Naomi says, a convincing smile on her face.
Dean looks at his brother and considers it, but also doesn’t trust them enough to use some sort of mysterious magic on Sam. “That’s okay, I’m sure a bed will be just fine.”
“Makes sense.” Dean is now hovering over Castiel where he sits at his desk, causing the angel to move his paper out of sight. Dean snorts. “C’mon man, I’m not gonna reveal any of your angel love letters.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says, and Dean sighs in relief. He can’t help but hug the angel, overcome with gratitude for what Castiel did. He’d be lying if he weren’t relieved that the angel’s alive, too.
“Well, yeah, it’s the family business,” Dean replies, taking full advantage of the pastries put out for them as Naomi digs her claws into him. Unlike the other angels they’ve met, Naomi is far more aggressive, but the eclairs she’s offered him almost make up for it.
The two promptly step out of the room before Dean can offer to leave himself, so he decides to look around a bit. Lady Naomi is probably an angel, and this is probably a front for investigating hunters. But why?
“I can’t help but notice you got me alone right before the next song started,” Dean says. They’re surrounded by people who’ve already started dancing, and it would feel odd not to join. Dean begins to follow suit, and Castiel gives him the most puzzling look before begrudgingly going along with it.
Dean’s gut twists at the thought of all of their interactions being fake, just an orchestrated scheme to get him to go with the angels and never return. He stands up from where he sits, suddenly feeling the need to be outside. “I’m gonna get going, Charlie. I need a walk.”
“Why do you call the humans that?” Castiel asks his brother, and Uriel just laughs. “There’s something about him that makes me think he’s a hunter.”
“You and your brother are welcome to stay as long as you like,” Castiel says, and Dean looks up at him. He can tell he’s trying his hardest to be polite, but it doesn’t quite reach his tone. “The storm will be going on for quite a while, and Sam clearly needs some rest.”
Uriel nods at his brother before the two are approached by Anna, talking about the people she’s met and how excited she is to be on Earth.
“I know you guys have been hunting me for years, wanting to take me for a ride while Michael destroys everything,” Dean says, fiddling with the knife in his hand. “I really threw you off, huh?”
“He’s right,” Dean says, and Castiel looks up at him. “My family loves a good joke. Keeps the mood light, you know?”
When Castiel arrives in the mountains, he’s not sure where to start. He’s been sent here by Heaven to track down a killer who’s hidden himself away, but he’s surrounded by trees. He travels until he finds a “country store,” and decides to check inside.
“...Dad’s orders don’t matter,” Gabriel is saying bitterly, while Castiel’s features only become more conflicted looking.
Now that Sam is miraculously cured, Dean is almost sad to leave the Novaks’ house the next day. He’s gotten used to bothering the angel with the stick up his ass and has found it brings him great joy to see Castiel’s head tilting to the side, his brow narrowing in confusion at almost everything Dean says.
Dean shakes his head, feeling like they don’t have much of a chance here. Their only hope is interrogating another angel, something he would prefer not to do, but he would do anything for Sam.
Castiel thinks to himself. His thoughts are quickly interrupted when an arm wielding a knife is wrapped around his neck.
Dean tried to slow down his hand so he could respond. The energy coursing through him now had him right there. He was so close to his orgasm it was in his ears, and his body didn’t want to stop. It took serious effort to try and multi-task.
Getting lost in the feeling more than he should, Castiel let his other hand simply roam Dean’s body to re-familiarize himself with it. He was firm and as well filled out as he remembered. An explosion of desire shot through him with the memories and flirting they had shared so far. It caused him to begin caressing his side with the same fluidity of their mouths moving together, until finally he dipped into his pants wanting to feel his heated skin.
All the while though the man continued to stroke him generously through his orgasm. It felt short lived, but it was intense enough to make up for the short period of time he got to experience it. Especially when Dean began nuzzling his nose under his ear like he was enjoying the warmth or the scent of him. The action made him attempt a laugh that he didn’t have enough air for yet.
“Have you thought about adding a little shade around here?” Dean asked, pushing his flannel sleeves up to his elbows as they began walking around the middle beds slowly. “I mean fuck I don’t even have fur, and I’m already sweating.”
Chewing on his lip Dean let his thumb swipe over the screen of his phone slowly. Tracing the bubble of words and outline of the picture once again. Was this some stroke of good luck or just some kind of fucking tease? Was it a test? It could be any of them he guessed, but why would someone include a picture? What were the odds of any of those scenarios?
Plus he was always praised for a perfectly sculpted face. All angles with just the right amount of softness. Pouty lips and eyelashes that could get him whatever he wanted with the simplest smolder.
Giving you some Dean POV into the situation, and past! I enjoyed writing this chapter a lot! Hopefully you enjoy it also. <3
Did I force smut into this? Maybe. Am I sorry for it? Absolutely not. My depraved soul feels guilty enough for not giving you more naughty times, especially since Dean cock blocked me last chapter xD
Watching as Dean rocked back and forth on his heels, Castiel shrugged off his lab coat. The coat wasn’t something required of the job, but it reminded him of his trenchcoat, and he enjoyed the familiarity of it. It gave him time to note the man’s nervous habit, and the awkward stiffness in his body language. Was he still that uncomfortable around him despite all their lighthearted and playful texting?
After cleaning the furry troublemaker up, Castiel sent them on their way with reassurance and a smile. Despite the dog’s confusion for their new torturous necklace, he went to the front desk for his next patient's paperwork. Just a routine yearly check up for heartworms, and flea and tick prevention. They weren’t here yet though so he would give them five to ten minutes before moving on to the next one as long as the patient after them didn’t arrive early. So he allowed himself to slip away for a moment and indulge in his private life by checking his messages.
“Hell yeah it will,” he said, and Castiel couldn’t practically see the man’s hair standing up on his arms, if the hard twitch of his cock hadn’t been a dead give away to his excitement.
“May I?” Castiel asked breathlessly, tugging his trigger finger along the waistband of the panties until his hand was in the front.
Opening the door Castiel smiled seeing the sable and grey-colored husky greeting him. Its bushy tail swishing around at top speed. Their muzzle was torn and bloody looking, although it appeared the owner had tried to stop the bleeding. He ruffled the top of the dog’s head as they waggled and talked. Because talking was the only way to describe the familiar husky noise. It wasn’t exactly a howl, but it wasn’t exactly a bark either.
That’s why he had his private phone. This phone. The one place he could indulge, and be himself. Well as much as you could be virtually anyways. Aside from going by the name Michael, and saying he was a mechanic like his dad, the rest was pretty true to who he was. The only other time he could come close to who he truly was, was at home with Anna.
Walking towards the kennels Castiel tried to judge the distance that would leave room for them to grow to maturity while also leaving room for any additional kennels. Those were definitely needed to be as close as possible to the outside kenneled dogs to keep them the coolest. The closer shade would allow them to be even cooler than the simple coverings they currently had. Perhaps a third tree on the side of the shed that faced north as to not prevent the current flowers from their needed amount of direct sunlight would also be beneficial. How had he been so stupid not think of any of this?
“Nothing. It’s adorable,” Dean elaborated, gesturing to the kittens. “More power to ‘em. I mean come on. I call my brother Samantha, and friend Charlie Charles all the time. I actually think it’s kinda cute. Isn’t that right you little fuzz balls. Yes, yes I am.”
“I’m surrounded by animals everyday. Why would I need to take pictures from the internet?” he asked, curious about the weird assumption.
The sass Dean could hear through those five words caused a low chuckle to escape from deep within his chest. Even through his dick as he continued to stroke it lazily, he could feel the low vibrations. Usually he was the one with an attitude. All his partners just did what he wanted in bed. Someone with a little fight in them made him ache with excitement.
The man’s idea to come by his work had been an exciting suggestion. Not only could he show and share the professional part of his life with him, but he could see him again without asking him out on a date. Something he wasn’t entirely sure if Dean wanted or not. There were only so many clues he could pick up via text, and he wasn’t all that great at it if he was being truthful.
Dean winked, probably trying to lighten the mood, but part of him felt incredibly sad the man hadn’t pursued something that had been of great interest to him. It was wonderful he enjoyed his job now, but he wondered what had stopped him from trying. No doubt he would have been exceptional.
Castil shook his head. He still didn’t understand the whole “kitten” thing. Dean had used it towards him a few times, and he couldn’t tell if it was some pet name or what. Then if it was, he wondered where the name had come from in the first place. Was it because he was a veterinarian? Then add on some of the odd things he said sometimes, and Dean just baffled him in the best ways.
Castiel frowns and nods, but is still dancing with Dean, and he can’t help but smile at the fact that he’s danced with not one, but two angels tonight, the second of which he feels a remarkably strong pull towards whenever he’s in the same room as him. Dean tries not to think about it, knowing an angel probably wouldn’t feel that way about a human, never mind a screw up like him. His expression must have followed his train of thought, because Castiel is tilting his head at him questioningly.
Dean’s eyebrows raise, while Anna nods. “Of course, Castiel,” she says, with what looks like amusement on her face. “Go right ahead.”
“I wouldn’t talk like that, Dean. We have more than enough force to kill you and your brother in an instant. What makes you think you’re in control?” She steps forward. “You nor Castiel have any say in what’s happening. You are mine to control, do you understand?”
Naomi is suddenly standing behind Cas, looking absolutely furious. “Castiel-” she’s saying before Cas reaches Dean’s forehead and zaps him out of there, back to the comfort of his own home. Dean’s laying in his own bed, and the racing of his heart is the only indication that he was anywhere else seconds ago.
Zazzles wounds could easily turn into infection if he were to go without a cone, and wasn’t properly monitored at all times. Getting his nose dirty would be too easy given the nature of dogs in general. He could already see the young dog burying it in the dirt looking for moles since it liked the chase.
The whole thing had been Anna’s idea though. Childhood interactions among the Hollywood elite, best friends through some of the most mentally trying times in his life? Anna understood his problem. Well...more like problems, but being gay was one thing she was able to help him with. Being famous with a fanbase that leaned towards the kind of people he’d grown up with in Kansas, bible belt thumping bigots, his career would be over within a week of coming out. Having a wife really helped prevent any doubts, even with how his eyes would linger on men against his own will.
To say he was angry with his brother was an understatement. The vase had been worth smashing against the wall, even if he hadn’t thrown it at Gabriel's head like he had wanted too. It didn’t matter if Dean had been trying to sneak out. He would have tried to contact him through Eileen although given the opportunity obviously he wanted to speak face to face. Which was what Gabriel had ruined.
The action for some reason caused Dean to laugh lightly, although he didn’t know why. Probably the kiss he realized. It wasn’t like the tattoos were actually any kind of damage. They were just symbolism, but still. Just imagining that scenario as an adult was horrible. Then imagining his child having to go through that was painful.
Castiel grimaced realizing he hadn’t heard his receptionist call for him. Dean was incredibly distracting. Yes he was definitely going to have to start leaving his phone in his bag. At least he told himself he would.
“Dean,” Castiel breathed, bringing the man’s hand up instinctively to kiss the tattoo like it was a wound. “I don’t know what to say. That’s incredibly brave for such a small child.”
Half of the time he didn’t know what the man was talking about. That only spurred Dean on further, trying to educate him in pop culture. Castiel didn’t mind though because he loved listening, well reading, the man’s passionate attitude on whatever subject. It kept telling him more and more about him.
Castiel was not all that surprised to see what was revealed looked just like actual womens panties. There was no extra space for his testicles let alone his full blown erection The flushed swollen head was peaking out of the tight band where a tiny black bow rested. Both the angry red colored skin of his cock, and the black contrasting beautifully with the pale blue fabric.
There were only a few other contacts on his list besides her, and none of which he actively texted anymore since they were foreign contacts. Dean had merely saved them for when he was in their country again hoping for an easy hook up since they were the only places he ever risked getting laid. Otherwise he preferred to just correspond with people like him via Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr.
“Was I presumptuous?” he asked, beginning to feel foolish for letting his emotions take over, as Dean looked back towards the visible parking lot nervously. They hadn’t kissed since that night after all, and they had just come off a sensitive subject.
After recently learning Dean had a cat allergy and was hesitant about them, he had taken to sharing with him some of the more loving cats he had ever come across. A few stories, and even a few about his patients. Crookshanks was an orange male tabby cat he had seen earlier that day, but definitely was not one of the nice stories.
Looking down like he would easily see what he felt, he resisted the urge to dig his fingers into the meat of the man’s backside and pull him closer. Dean’s hands tightened and loosened where they were resting on his own hips. It told him the man was uncertain of what his reaction was going to be. Although Castiel didn’t see how he could think it would be anything other than good. Already his cock had gone from half hard to filled out after only seconds of the discovery.
“Sure,” Dean agreed easily, taking one last look at the kittens before standing up. “My allergy ain’t that bad though. It’s only when their fur is all over my stuff.”
Aside from gossip as teenagers, and general conversation over who Anna was currently seeing, they didn’t discuss their sex lives. Mostly because it was awkward, for him at least. After coming to terms with being gay, and they’d agreed on their arrangement, that kind of talk had died down quite a bit. It wasn’t that he was embarrassed around her, that much, but part of him still always felt a little guilty.
Nodding, and mentally stashing that information away for later, Castiel resisted guiding the man out of the room by the small of his back. That was an urge he never had had before, but the thought of doing such a casually intimate act sounded enticing. Dean just made him want to hold him. He wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing really given their current status of….well he didn’t know what they really were.
Hearing his humour and relaxation completely return though, Castiel guided Dean backwards a little until they were hidden by the lip of the kennel shed. Then he actually locked lips with the man like he truly wanted to. Deep and heavy in an effort to soothe him. The responding groan told him he was successful when he pulled away again.
“Never known any kind of doctor personally before,” the man told him. “Plus I may have a mild obsession with Dr.Sexy.”
Dean looked down at himself debating the idea. While he’d had more blow jobs than he could count, it had been years since he’d risked sending a dick pic. There were no distinguishing features on his crotch though. No birth marks or tattoos that would scream this is Dean Winchester’s dick. Surely a little visual wouldn’t hurt in the teasing, and he knew he was large enough to gain the guys attention. Hopefully. Especially if he was already horny.
Castiel had a feeling from what he had observed about him that it was the latter. Sure it may have been a bit much trying to contact him the day after a night of drinking, but he had felt the need to apologize for Gabriel once more. To let Dean know he was serious about wanting to see him again.
Dun Dun Dun…...more Dean POV as it’s another continuation of the date. I’ve had most of this written for a while, but getting from point A to point C was difficult. Point D of course was easy LOL except when some how in my head it suddenly gets transferred to the next chapter which actually pisses me off a little -_- I blame Dean 100%, and he will suffer for it in another fic of mine to make me feel better xD
Feeling a sudden spike in bravery, and perhaps the underlying need to comfort the man, he leaned in for an actual kiss. Dean inhaled sharply when their lips brushed, but he still puckered them and returned the kiss, albeit hesitantly. Not wanting to push his limits though he left it chaste.
As soon as he did Castiel began sinking slowly to his knees, desperate to discover the unknown. There was a desperate need to see what was hidden in the man's jeans up close, and he undid them with the same slow speed drawing out the anticipation. If he didn’t feel blinded by desire he would take him into his office, but it felt too far away at the moment.
It had been nearly a week since his and Dean’s first not date. He had taken to referencing it as a not date because he didn’t have another thing to call it. While texting was incredibly satisfactory he was still pondering when the right time to bring up seeing each other again would be. Maybe come Monday, and they could make plans for the following weekend.
“Why do you keep calling me doc?” Castiel asked, looking for a less sensitive topic, and out of actual curiosity. “Yes I have a doctorate degree, and yes I’m an animal doctor, but we are always referred to as vets.”
Taking himself in his hand Dean stared at the picture intently, licking his lips and reading over the person’s words again as he stroked himself to complete hardness. They could suck him. They could definitely suck him if that was the way they talked. Then again there wouldn’t be any talking in this situation on his end.
“Head wounds, like with humans, bleed a lot more but doesn’t necessarily mean it’s severe,” Castiel informed him, sharing a small laugh at the husky determination as one of his vet techs walked in to help hold Zazzle still.
Dean nodded his head approvingly, so Castiel reached forward and cradled the man’s jaw with one hand. Softly guiding their lips back together he made his own hum of approval. His face had just the tiniest bit of stubble on it that was enjoyable to brush against.
Castiel snorted, imagining Dean’s blush. He always got what was clearly playfully defensive whenever he brought up any of his confessions from the dance floor. Even to the point he wanted to argue romantic comedies and music with him.
“Sure did,” the gruff owner spoke, encouraging the dog to sit, which it didn’t. “Broke some of the wire fencing by the shed trying to get a mouse and just….blood everywhere. He was a determined little shit.”
Taking the dog’s head in his hands he studied it closely as they tried to lick him. It definitely wasn’t severe despite one cut being large enough there was a flap of skin. Nothing was too deep that needed stitches though. A general cleaning would work.
Second half of the date that I decided to split in half for good reason considering this is nearly 7k O_O. So still Cas's POV. I probably should have waited longer to post....but my broken muse says go ahead LOL especially considering it contains the goods (or at least I hope you classify it as such). May have gone over board however I'm totally not sorry for that.
Dean appeared to study the various flowers and shrubs for a second, taking it all in. Everything from cosmos and tiger lilies to irises, and roses. All were placed aesthetically to Missouri’s liking. The woman had insisted he couldn’t just throw it all out “willy nilly like that” like he had originally begun to.
Sam’s cold only gets worse, and Dean starts to feel desperate. They’ve spent a couple days at the Novaks’ house now, and Sam’s fever isn’t breaking. Dean realizes he needs to put his stubbornness aside and take a chance on the angels.
The storm continues throughout the night, and Dean wakes up the next morning with a crick in his neck from falling asleep in the chair. Groaning, he notices Sam is still passed out, so he decides to do a little snooping.
Sam just snorts, and sure enough, Dean finds himself in a suit and bowtie the following week. It’s a good enough time, Dean figures. Dean’s keeping close to his brother and looking out for any signs of the Novaks when a new group of people enters the ballroom.
By helping Dean, Castiel would be perhaps creating a rift in his heavenly family. But he couldn’t be a part of a family who treats people like pieces of meat, sending them to slaughter for the sake of war.
“Mornin’,” Dean says to the angels. Anna nods politely at him, and Uriel smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. Castiel doesn’t turn around.
Dean kisses him, and Cas is surprised but kisses him back. Dean laughs breathlessly. “I’ll prove to you that this was a good choice,” Dean says, willing the angel to believe him. “You deserve it, Cas, I- I love you.”
“No, just you,” Castiel says, so seriously but quietly that Dean almost misses it. The song promptly ends, and the dancers are bowing to each other.
Dean smiles bitterly. “Sounds like I’m still not good enough for you, then.” He suddenly feels too exposed, and the rain pouring down on them is only making it worse. Dean sighs. “I’ll see ya later, Cas.”
As Castiel and Dean sit at the bar, Dean watches him curiously as Castiel takes his first sip of beer. His face scrunches up, and it feels strange in his mouth, but he swallows, and it is cool and refreshing. Dean laughs and pats him on the back.
“Your cause, huh?” Dean shakes his head, annoyed but not surprised that they would be secretive about their work.
Castiel carefully studies his face before sighing. “My apologies, but I don’t know what you’re referring to. Your recreational activities don’t concern me.”
Anna almost smiles. “We’re angels, Dean. We can simply heal your brother if he’s coming down with something.”
“No angel can locate you now,” Castiel says, and Dean feels around his chest in question. “That’ll buy us some time.”
Castiel looks at both Dean and Mary before sighing. “My deepest apologies, this is grave indeed. I will leave you now. Goodbye.” And with that, the angel had vanished, leaving Dean and Mary upset and confused on his doorstep.
“I sent word to them that you were on the run, and that you seemed to have protection against angels. They won’t check in as long as I keep them updated.”
“The other angels will arrive soon, wondering why I haven’t carried out my orders,” Castiel says, earning them a weird look from the bartender. Dean puts a hand on his shoulder, guiding him to leave, and Castiel is struck by the sensation of a warm hand on his arm before it is pulling him out of the bar by the sleeve of his trenchcoat.
“Thank you,” Dean says quietly. Castiel nods and promptly leaves the room, leaving Dean to wonder what in the world the angels’ true intentions are.
Castiel’s eyebrows furrow. “These letters contain classified information that only angels can know. None of them mention ‘love’.”
Once they make it to the guest room, Sam immediately crashes on the bed. He’s out like a light, and Dean takes a seat nearby.
“The one on the right, his name is Uriel. The guy with the smirk is Gabriel, and to the left of him is their sister Anna.”
“Don’t give me that crap,” Dean says, maintaining a smile on his face despite trying to sound threatening. “I overheard you and your siblings. I figured I might try to confront you while there’s still an audience, in case you guys are waiting to gank me once I’m alone.”
As soon as he hit send, Castiel cursed himself. Dean was so bad about that. Making him get lost in the moment. Was that an inappropriate way to breach the topic of seeing him again or could it be taken as a flirtation?
Feeling the vibration in his pants pocket, Castiel ignored it despite the urge to reach for it. As much as he wanted to keep texting Dean he did have a job to do. Although it seemed to be growing just a little bit harder since they had taken up texting. Perhaps he needed to leave his phone in his bag. Then again how were emergencies supposed to contact him? During the day he supposed they could just call the office directly, and at the point they needed his cell he would be off the job free to do as he wanted anyways.
Dean’s thumb stilled, and his grip tensed a little around his hand. Apparently the meaning was a personal topic. He instantly regretted pushing the boundaries. Perhaps they were much like scars. Most had a reason or meaning, and some were less than pleasant memories.
The guy wanted to suck his dick though, not the other way around. Well….not his dick, but still the visual was there. At least for him. Maybe the guy needed his own visual since they didn’t know who they were talking to. Obviously it was someone they had a thing with, and whoever they were was at least pan or bi. They had to be if they had a cock and was also itching to suck one.
“It just wasn’t meant to be,” Dean sighed. “I mean I still think about it sometimes, but I enjoy being an artist. It’s a great outlet, I can make people smile without acting like an idiot, and I get to be my own boss. Plus it might boost my ego with all the praise. Lots of wins.”
Anna had no interest in nerdy shit though. Her knowledge of the phone, and being in the contacts, was merely a precaution in case something bad was to happen to him. Even Sam didn’t know the full truth behind the curtain.
It’s Dean who gets the intel from Charlie, telling him the Novaks just moved into the next town over. She still has to do more research, but they’re suspicious, and an investigation from the local hunters wouldn’t hurt. What’s shocking is what his mother and brother suggest to him in order to get to know them better.
We wanted to thank you for your kind hospitality at your ball and your welcoming of us to town. Our business takes us to a new location, but we wish you good health, happiness, and prosperity.
The smell of the fresh food hits Castiel as he walks through the door. He sees all the cheeses and meats, and milk too. He’s never indulged in eating human food before, but the sheer quantity of it all is tempting.
Charlie looks surprised. “I’d be careful, Dean. These guys are super powerful. If Castiel’s job is to collect hunters, then he could be messing with you.”
Dean is at a loss at how to further investigate the angels, and he finds himself heading outside with the intent to walk to their estate. In their mail, however, he finds a letter addressed from the Novak family.
“I know you’re hunting me, asshole,” a gruff voice speaks into his ear, a warm body pressed against his back.
“To enjoy life’s greatest pleasures,” Gabriel drawls, his eyes locking onto the dessert table. He breaks off from Uriel and Castiel, who are just feet away from Dean and Charlie but separated by a few degrees of people.
Naomi blinks at him, not unlike the other angels, but her eyes are burning with rage and her smile is gone.
One of them is a smug man with perfectly styled hair, and next to him is a half-miserable looking son of a bitch with piercing blue eyes and a deep frown. Dean catches his eye and is surprised by the intensity in his gaze before Sam notices, and the man soon turns away. Sam opens his mouth to say something before one of them is standing in front of them.
“What do we have to do?” Dean says, and he is all business, all hunter all too quickly. Maybe not before when his edges were softened by the beer and talk of his family, but Castiel can see it now. Dean is staring at Castiel, waiting for orders, and he isn’t used to giving orders. It feels strange to even try. But he has to, if he wants what he thinks he wants.
Dean laughs, bitterly. “This is how I go, huh? Five years of vacation and then I kick the bucket?” He closes his eyes and holds out his arms, giving Castiel plenty of opportunity to come at him with the knife.
“Which one of you feathery bastards took my brother?” Dean says, stepping forward. Castiel’s eyebrows narrow as he looks at Dean, and he tilts his head.
It’s raining, but Dean doesn’t mind as he walks across the green grass, trying not to think about angels or blue eyes or anything in particular. That is, until he hears a familiar flapping of wings, and he freezes.
When an invitation comes to the house for a ball thrown by the angels, Dean is more than a little surprised. Nevertheless, he assumes this is another way for them to complete whatever angel business they have cooked up, meaning he basically has to go.
“I am, am I?” Dean says, almost rolling his eyes. “Care to share any more? I haven’t been given much to work with here.”
“Your garrison, huh?” Dean says, thinking about it. “And what are you guys doing? Just dancing with all the local hunters?”
“Yeah, I dunno… do you paint? Do you read? He seems to be writing a novel over there,” Dean says, gesturing to where Castiel is still scribbling away.
Unsurprisingly, Sam and his mother don’t mind having an angel around the estate. Castiel is amazed by Dean’s tour of the place, and is especially fascinated by all the cats running around. Dean enjoys having him around, and loves knowing he doesn’t have to worry about him disappearing again.
“Uh, no, not really,” Dean says, remembering the angel wanting a favor from him and then deciding against it. Naomi also clearly wanted Dean for their mission, but Castiel stopped him from joining them. “He’s mentioned wanting me to help him with something, but then something changed his mind and he took it back.”
“Which one of those chumps is the leader?” Dean asks his friend casually, knowing all the research she did with Bobby about this case over the past week.
“We know they’re targeting hunters,” Mary says, reading over the notes scattered across the table. “So we could be their next mark.”
The Novaks have separated now, Anna off on her own while the other three are walking by where Dean and Charlie are standing. The hunters pretend not to notice, but pay close attention to what they’re saying.
Castiel looks at him, and almost agrees, until he realizes that he doesn’t. He’s always cared for humanity, and always believed he was helping them. But with Dean’s story, he’s not so sure of that anymore. While Castiel wasn’t aware of what Heaven’s goals were until now, what he does know is that Heaven should act with the utmost caring towards human beings.
Dean tries to pretend he’s not looking around at everything, but he’s sure Castiel can probably figure out what he’s doing. He doesn’t enjoy the fact that they’re investigating him and his brother as much as they’re investigating the angels.
“Cas, wait-“ Dean says, reaching out, but the angel is gone. He hears someone clear their throat, and he looks to the front doorway to see Sam looking confused.
Anna asks him to dance, and Dean is once again caught off guard. She’s all smiles and the picture of grace, but Dean feels as though they’re being observed by someone. He looks past Anna and sees Castiel looking at him with a strange expression.
Dean reads the letter a second time in shock. Whipping the door open, he sees his mother and brother in the living room.
“Angels?” Dean says, a little too loudly. They had come across vampires, ghosts, even demons… but angels were certainly new to him. “Huh.”
Castiel shares an unreadable glance with Dean before the two angels stand, leaving Dean alone in the huge sitting room for the second time that day. The fireplace feels nice, however, and Dean decides he doesn’t mind waiting here.
She stands in the doorway, looking more than angry. “Castiel is an angel of the Lord. He obeys our orders, not yours.” She doesn’t beat around the bush, either.
Castiel blinks, the reality of the situation settling in. He has orders to kill this war criminal, who is standing in front of him and offering to buy him a beer in exchange for his life, and he’s never had to deal with anything like this before. Everything had always seemed so obvious, the right answer always being so clear to him. Castiel had deep respect for his superiors, and had never truly doubted their judgment until now. From Dean’s perspective, it seems as though Heaven hunted him into hiding out forever, because they needed to use him and his brother as vessels. He didn’t know why he never thought of it that way before, but maybe because he needed to demonize them to justify Heaven’s actions. Thinking about it was starting to make Castiel feel cold and empty, because this meant all of the angels had been lying to him his entire life.
Castiel shakes his head. “I was sent to these coordinates to explore the area and no further instructions until a few minutes ago. I don’t know how heaven found you.” He holds out a knife towards Dean’s chest, deciding they’ve talked long enough. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Sighing, Dean looks out the window, trying to think. He watches the rain pour and drench everything outside, and it suddenly gives him an idea.
Dean finds himself walking by the drawing room, where he spots some of the angels in question. Anna and Uriel look over at him as he pauses in the doorway, while Castiel has his back turned to him and is busy writing something at a desk.
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel says, breaking his silence but still writing. “Even though we’re angels, some people are easier to reach through the written word.”
That night, Dean prays, because if Castiel is alive, he wants him to know how much he appreciates his help. He hears a fluttering of wings and opens his eyes.
“Damn,” Mary says, throwing the letter onto the table. “We never even figured out what they were doing here in the first place.”
Dean looks up and gives her a forced smile. “Why yes, indeed. All accomplished killers of monsters.”
Days pass, and Dean has not heard anything from the angels. He spends a lot of time outside, trying to make sense of Michael and the angels and Castiel, but it doesn’t do any good. It only makes him feel more eaten up inside, as if he’s actively doing something wrong. A yell coming from their house snaps Dean out of his thoughts, however, and he runs inside to see what happened.
Here it is. The end of the road for this fic unless for some reason it explodes and people want a sequel or something. I say that because it does feel like I’m robbing you a little and there is potential there, but I truly can’t take anymore fluff. It’s been more stressful than fun. I wanted to pull my hair out, and that’s not how it should be for me.
“Oh….” Castiel gasped in surprise, parting their lips only a hair and opening his eyes from where they had shut.
Castiel tried hard not to feel smug by the reaction. It was hard not to though when the man was so responsive to him. Vocally and physically it wasn’t taking that long to break him apart. Maybe Dean just really liked blow jobs, because he wasn’t even deep throating him. You’d think he was the way he began thrusting into his mouth.
It had been too long since he’d masturbated. That all had to be it. Definitely. It had absolutely nothing to do with this stunning man with his enticing cock wanting to bury his face in his ass in the most filthy way like he’d never experienced before. His scruff would probably leave a burn between his cheeks, as he did things he couldn’t even imagine with that wicked tongue, but he’d surely relish it afterwards.
“This is Seraph,” Castiel told him, gesturing towards one of the medium sized kennels that held a scrawny black cat they guessed to be about two years old, and her fresh litter of kittens. “She only came in about a week ago. Very pregnant at the time as you can tell.”
Good god the guy was paying attention to that? Those little details? He’d hardly gotten any of his hair in the picture. Mostly because he’d been focusing in on the top half though, but so what if he liked a little manscaping? Just because he never actually got laid didn’t mean he didn’t like to feel pretty.
Dean’s upper lip twitched, staring at the hardened cock standing tall and proud. Completely swollen with it’s defined head bulging, and shining with what was obviously precum smeared over the slit. Two fingers were spread around the bottom of it’s thick base pushing down the curls to frame it. Honestly the most enticing part was what those long fingers were attached to. The large hand was big enough to almost cover the entire black bush of pubic hair. Almost.
Pulling on the fabric, Castiel wiggled it around until it was wedged between Dean’s ass cheeks. He didn’t want him to doubt the decision for even a second. Just as through text, or that night they were grinding together, the idea….no, the knowledge, that this handsome man wore panties? Then this time it was for him, and because he had simply playfully asked? It caused lust to start coursing through him. His mind became muddled with images of what was covering Dean’s bulge that he had felt growing steadily against his own crotch as they pressed together.
“Fuck,” Dean mumbled leaning over him, and bracing his hands on the metal shed. “Are you gonna suck me doc?”
Castiel grabbed Dean’s ribs to steady himself. This Dean was overwhelming in a way that made his knees weak. The man wasted no time at all, not even bothering to tuck his wet spent cock away or fix his pants. He just shoved his hand down his while continuing to ravish his mouth. Wrapping his long fingers around his neglected and aching cock he couldn’t complain though as he started stripping it at a rate that could almost count as desperation. Like he was determined to yank the orgasm right out of him.
First he had to force his eyes from the pictures and messages to the keyboard. He had to force his thumb to move, and he had never been more grateful for the swipe texting option in his life at that moment. All the while his other hand continued trying to stroke himself. His body was determined to get him to his release.
Glancing down where the man was stroking the back of his hand with his thumb in a calming gesture, Castiel noticed the colored flames wrapping around Dean’s wrist and traveled up his exposed forearm. He admired the watercolor-like art before realizing his other arm had the same tattoo. Winding large, flaring fire swirling upwards with his muscle. In their drunken naked night together he hadn’t got to truly study all his tattoos in the dim light. Something he sorely regretted as even just what he could see was beautiful.
What Dean really wanted to know though was who that hand, that cock, belonged to. The picture actually looked genuine, and real with a sliver of bright orange underwear nestled under what he could see of the heavy scrotum sitting on top. No, it wasn’t like some stolen image off of google.
Still Dean didn’t recognize the phone number it had come from, and the only person in his real life that knew of
For days now he had been texting Dean. At first he had worried he wouldn’t get a response once the man had left his house, and he hadn’t for over twelve hours when he finally caved and the sent the first message. Castiel wasn’t sure if that was due to Dean’s job or nerves.
“Uh..well there was one year when I was younger that I got really into firefighter and forestry research when I’d considered going to college,” Dean admitted with a small puff of air that was probably an attempt to laugh like it was nothing.
I don't find it a big deal at all, and find it unnecessary really, but for the sake of risking unfavorable comments I'm going to put a warning <---- that a/b/o is DISCUSSED briefly. This is NOT an a/b/o fic. Just the dynamics are thrown around a little in conversation.
“Thank you. It only cost me my future first born child,” Castiel told him honestly, and Dean’s resulting laugh was a deep, beautiful sound. “Would you like me to show you around? I can show you the kittens I sent you a picture of.”
“No. No I just never really…uh been public with a guy,” Dean admittedly sheepishly flickering his eyes between his face and the grass with pink cheeks.
“Ezekial, and her siblings don’t bend to gender forming names or stereotypes that come along with everyday society,” he said, raising his chin proudly, and Dean smiled widely at him. “What?”
“Was the mouse worth it?” Castiel asked Zazzles seriously, and the dog leaned forward trying to lick his face which he took as a yes. Huskies and their play drive he chuckled inwardly.
“I suppose I hadn’t thought about it,” he admitted, suddenly feeling bad. “How could I have not thought about that?”
“Really, it’s fine doc,” Dean tried to laugh it off further with a dismissive wave, but it was obvious he came up short.
It would be a lie to say that the night they spent together hadn’t been the best one in a long time. How could he not want to see that beautiful man again? While there were no expectations, and he didn’t know what Dean thought of what happened, he couldn’t let the possibility slip away like a drunken one night stand. Their casual conversation during dinner, and before they had gotten wasted was far too much fun for that.
A smug sense of satisfaction washed over him at the nearly instant response. It meant the guy was still there, probably thinking of him. Waiting to see what would happen next.  He was probably just hesitant like Dean assumed, especially since he messaged back instead of ignoring him. Not that he was sure he could blame him considering they were strangers, and he obviously wasn’t who the texts had been for.
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” Castiel started trying to get his attention and calm him down, but he realized it was pointless as it quickly became a chant driving the man to go faster.
Glancing up at the confession, Castiel thought about how the man had been thinking of him as he put these on. Holding his eye contact as he leaned forward and mouthed at the part of Dean’s cock that was still covered by fabric, and he widened his mouth to suck on the side of his shaft when the man’s breath stuttered. He wanted to taste him, but for a moment he debated the action. The internal debate didn’t last long as he pulled the panties down while he licked upwards. It was just enough to take the head of his cock between his lips, and tease the slit without anything in the way.
Castiel’s eyes narrow as he slowly dances around Dean and the other guests. “This is serious, Dean. There are lives at stake.”
Dean nods, giving the angel a winning smile. “It’s appreciated. I’m sure we’ll be out of your hair shortly.”
Castiel looks at him, exasperated, but doesn’t answer him. “Goodbye, Dean,” he says, before disappearing from Dean’s room. Dean throws himself back down on his bed, wishing the world would make sense to him again.
“We don’t engage in many human activities, if that’s what you mean,” Anna explains. “Castiel is drafting letters for our cause.”
Castiel sighs. He knows the humans like to deflect from their problems with humor, and Dean Winchester is no exception. “I’m serious, Dean. If you claim to be hunted by Heaven as you say you were, I want to defend your case to them.” Castiel puts his drink down, looking over at Dean. “If my superiors are acting without honor, then they need to be held accountable for it.”
Dean resisted the itch to snap a selfie, and prove it. Make the guy weak in the knees like all his fans. He was constantly being told he was hot, worthy of being a model, and a walking dream. There was just the right amount of stubble on his jaw to appear rugged, and his hair was always kept at the perfect length on top. Not too short, but not too long to appear messy. It was enough that the guy could get a good grip if he was into that.
Pocketing his phone, yet again, Castiel straightened himself up and opened the door to the exam room. It was a busy day, but there were no major cases unless an emergency was to come up. All in all a standard day that allowed him the luxury of relaxing and truly enjoying his job. Although he was pretty sure even a worst case scenario wouldn’t completely dampen his mood.
“I have some here, and at home,” he explained. “I thought it would be good for the animals to have something to explore, and some extra smells when the handlers and owners walk them around. Plus they are beautiful and add to the scenery. Not to mention it encourages the bee and butterfly populations as well.”
It was torture. Pink plush lips parted with his wide thumb resting on the corner, and his forefinger on the other. There was his clearly wet tongue curled up around his upper lip.
“Well good news Mr.Claymore. None of the cuts are really deep. Yes the one is rather large but it’s more similar to a scrap. I want you to watch it though just in case. A bandage is pointless with the location so that does mean someone,” Castiel drawled lightly, glancing at the dog. “... is going to be getting the cone of shame after I clean them up with a cleaning solution.”
Thankfully the man seemed much more comfortable texting than he had been in person. Well more like sober in person. He was on a whole new level of comfortable with himself when he was drunk. The playful and teasing connection came naturally between them apparently, and even via text Castiel was enjoying it greatly. It just slipped in through their basic communication and questions. Dean was, for the lack of better wording, something else. Something else that intrigued him.
Castiel got up from his crouched position, and went to go get his cleansing solution most often used for these kinds of situations. Just like kids, sometimes these things happened, and he admired owners who would bring them in when they were concerned versus letting things go without care. Especially with animals since they couldn’t tell you how bad something hurt.
More Cas POV because for some reason when I wrote this fic all his chapters turned out longer -shrug- As always I present to you more fluff. Or at least that's what it feels like to me. Hope you enjoy though <3 you were originally going to get phone sex, but the boys just wanted to chat playfully. Blame them for denying your smut needs. Otherwise the chapter would have been longer. I suppose some like short ones though? I hope anyways.....
Without conscious thought he started to walk a little faster with more focus trying to scope out what might be ideal areas to plant. While he wasn’t as knowledgeable on trees, and landscaping wasn’t exactly his speciality, it wouldn’t be hard to figure out where a few should go. Perhaps a few flowering ones on the front sides of the building, and ones specifically meant for shade in the back.
Palming own chubbing cock through his underwear Dean scrolled back up to look at the tempting picture again now that ideas were beginning to swim around in his head. It was times like this where he felt like a total cock slut. The way his mouth would water, and a little tingle would build on his skin imagining how hot that smooth red flesh would be against his cheek. How it could spark fire by running his tongue along it’s underside.
Deciding to take the risk, Dean reached over and turned on his bedside lamp. It was dark outside, and the light would be just dim enough to carry an air of seductive mystery. Besides, it would make for a better picture anyways. Using the flash option often made whatever the focus was too bright and unflattering.
Castiel felt an odd amount of happiness hearing the man remember him talking about them. Especially since the topic didn’t sound like one he was all that interested in. The same way he wasn’t exactly into cars, but he enjoyed reading Dean’s enthusiasm behind the subject.
“Now don’t try and clean it at home with anything as it could damage the tissue further,” he continued. “There may be a scar from one spot. Just keep an eye on it, and after seven to ten days depending on how it looks you should be able to take the cone off. Give him breaks if you want, but watch him the entire time to make sure he isn’t rubbing or pawing at it which could reopen it and start the healing process all over again. Pat down with a damp cloth gently if there is any drainage. Don’t wipe. There shouldn’t be any though.”
“So this is where your flowers are?” Dean asked as they walked towards the backdoor. “Here at the clinic? I thought they were at your place?”
He only went an inch or so past the waistband of his jeans as a tease. Testing the man’s reaction for how okay he was with what they were doing. Despite his own want, Castiel didn’t want to go too far after all. However he went far enough into his pants that he was able to feel the lacy texture skate under his palm giving him reason to pause.
Castiel pursued his lips in thought. He had made sure they had just the right amount of flowers to not look uncontrolled, but now that he thought about it, what good did that actually do for his patients' health besides scent entertainment? The hot and occasionally muggy weather of summer, dogs specifically needed shade to stay cool. Especially those with double coats. Had he really gotten so lost in something so menial that when it came to the big picture he forgot about something so crucial?
Dean let out a steading breath, and opened his camera while slowing his hand. Instead of gripping the bottom of his cock tightly like so many people did with these kinds of pictures, which in his opinion were dull and unsavory, he chose to loosely hold himself. Keeping his first two fingers behind the middle so his erection stayed steady, he pressed his thumb up against the edge of his tip to show them the definition. Show them where they could run their tongue.
“Would you like to go outside?” he asked. “Get some fresh air and see the back? I have been stuck here for the last eleven hour. Plus I don’t want you to start sneezing everywhere.”
“It was a long time ago. It’s fine,” Dean said more or less to himself. “Yes and no. I….when I was little our house caught fire. I was four, but it was bad or well ‘traumatic’ enough they call it, that I retained a few memories. Sammy was only like six months old at the time, and I can remember him in my arms running out of the house. Nothing but orange, red, and yellow on each side of me. Like a hot ass tunnel. Then I remember watching my dad throw himself out of the front door just as a loud crash or explosion or something sounded. After that I only remember the feeling of Sammy’s weight in my arms.”
Opening the door Castiel was taken off guard by the heat, having spent the day inside in the air conditioning. The sun was still shining without even a trace of a cloud, but at least it gave all of his plants the direct sunlight they needed. All along the property line he owned he had planted flower beds, along with some directly in the middle. Although he had made sure not to plant anything but some evergreen shrubs against the opposite sides of the outdoor kennels. There was also a wide variety of wildflowers he had chosen to grow against the large shed’s lip on the backside of them.
With a new approved mission Castiel didn’t waste any time. He quickly tucked the panites down beneath the man’s scrotum before taking his balls into his hand. A gentle tug earned him a small groan from Dean, and he could feel them tighten in his palm as he sucked him down without hesitation.
Then the man pulled him up by the hair making him hiss. It also forced him to let the softening cock fall from his mouth which was something he briefly missed. When Dean crushed their lips together though the loss was replaced with even more arousal. Especially as he probed his mouth, practically chasing the flavor of himself.
Dean exhaled in relief, and smiled at the back to back responses. It appeared to be an actual accident with the flustered apologies. He didn’t even have to see the guy's face to know it was probably adorable. Wide eyed and flushed with embarrassment. Not that he had anything to be embarrassed about with an impressive cock like that.
“Well even though he works with humans, and my focus is animals….I think I could make it work for you,” Castiel said, incredibly pleased with the change of mood. “I did start off with a focus in human medicine after all.”
Another chapter I've split in half because apparently I've been groomed into chapters that are 3-4k long versus my original crazy 9k long chapters. Blame my friends for working me down if you like longer chapters. I can't seem to shut it off now. My brain says split the long ones, which apparently usually tend to be date scenes.
I present to you....more FLUFF. This is the original fluff scene I got stuck on long ago because here was where I reached my fluff max. Dean basically put me in a prolonged panic attack which was fun though xD dramatic
“My defense, I was drunk off my ass and you were….everywhere,” he said, seeming to settle on a word that made little sense to him.
Instead he focused on the second picture. The true tease. While his mouth had only slightly been open in the first one, just enough to tease him with what he could have, the second was a close up.
Reaching around Castiel just let himself go, and slipped his thumbs into the man’s ass crack, stroking the fabric as he moved him forward so his jerks were more controlled by space. It created smaller, looser tugs that had his hips beginning to rock as he thrust up into Dean fist. The man twisted his wrist in a clearly practiced movement, and rotated his thumb in a circular fashion under and on top of the head each time he tugged upwards.
When the phone in his hand vibrated less than a minute later, Dean nearly vibrated out of his skin along with it. The little red number one for a new message taunting him before he pushed through the worry and opened it.
Song lyrics included belong to “Love Runs Out by OneRepublic” and “Diamonds by Sam Smith”. I only listened to them about…..whatever six hours worth is for this, because they are epic and inspiring.
“Cas,” Dean warned, tugging on his hair, and he hummed in response. “Cas I’m gonna…” he could hear the man trying to control his pants from above, but it just made him want to hear him come unleashed. “Cas man you’re…”
“I thought that was just some google picture,” Dean said with a hint of impressiveness, although he wasn’t sure why.
Settling back onto his bed Dean lifted his hips to slide down his briefs. While he preferred to sleep naked he always kept a shirt and underwear on. Despite having separate bedrooms he did live with Anna after all.
phone was Anna. Even disregarding the unfamiliar number she wouldn’t be one to send him what he was reading and looking at anyways. While his wife knew of his sexuality, supported him with everything, she wasn’t about to send him dick pics and dirty talk. That was just fucking weird.
“What do these mean?” Castiel asked, tracing their lines with his eyes although he wanted to with his fingers. “Did you get it because you considered being a firefighter?”
Can you believe my original goal word count for this fic was 15k? This is why I can't be given word limits or one shots. They are just impossible. O_O
“Who’s this little guy?” Dean asked in a soft sweet tone, bending down to look at the five tiny kittens and specifically pointing out the mostly black girl that had a variety of orange and white spots.
Gripping the small wedge available of the man’s panties tightly, Castiel moaned shamelessly trying not to bite down on the man’s lips as his orgasm started to crest. Then it turned into a full on whine when Dean abandoned his mouth to latch onto his neck. The increased pressure all around him caused his entire body to spasm as he started to come. For a hand job it was surprisingly short circuiting in a way that had him holding onto the man like a lifeline afraid he would fall. Until he remembered he was pressed up against the shed, and at that point he briefly felt embarrassed for coming so quick and hard.
Plan in place, Sam and Dean successfully make it to the Novaks’ house. What they don’t predict is the monstrous thunderstorm that only gets worse the further they get, and Dean is forced to go inside for shelter.
The angels are as courteous as they can be, but it’s clear they haven’t had many guests before. Sam, Dean, Castiel and Anna all sit in an awkward silence in their drawing room until Sam starts sneezing. Dean doesn’t think anything of it until the kid starts sweating and teetering in his seat.
Castiel sighs. “Is it worth it, do you think? Running away from your problems, cultivating a life for yourself in the woods? You don’t have anyone nearby, you don’t have any future here. I don’t understand.”
Dean scoffs. “Whatever. Let the feathery bastards investigate some other unsuspecting hunters. They didn’t hurt us, maybe they’re just collecting intel.”
“Your job, your whole reason for being here! Isn’t it to gather up hunters for some mysterious reason?”
“I wish,” Dean says. He doesn’t sound like he’s being dishonest, but Castiel hasn’t been around the humans long enough to tell. “I always thought if angels did turn out to be real, they would be all holy and powerful. Turns out you guys are just dicks.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, was it?” Castiel asks, his voice deeper than Dean expecting it to be, and he feels the smirk come before he can stop himself.
Dean nods slowly. “Followed some blind orders myself back in the day, wouldn’t recommend it.” He takes a long sip of his beer, and Castiel wonders what he’s talking about, but they don’t have much time.
Castiel sighs. “The fact of the matter is, the time I’ve spent with you… the things I’ve done for you… have all made me happier than anything I’ve ever done for Heaven. Angels complete orders out of obligation, but everything you’ve ever done, you’ve done for love. You reminded me that I have a choice, and I… choose you.”
When Dean gets the case from Charlie about Lady Naomi’s ghost problem, he accepts it without knowing. When he’s at her house and Lady Naomi is explaining the issue to Dean, it’s believable enough before Castiel steps into the room and blinks in surprise at Dean’s presence.
“That’s not the point, Dean,” Castiel says. “I proposed that we leave you and your family out of this, and I want to keep it that way.” He steps forward, and Dean can’t look away from him. “Truth be told, it wasn’t just me that was encouraging our departure. There was also question of where my loyalties lie, whether it’s with the angels or with you.”
to save my brother.” Dean thinks for a moment, the pieces of the puzzle falling into place. “Wait, did you set up that whole thing? The damn devil kidnapping Sam?”
One thing still bugs Dean, though. He still has no idea what the angels’ true mission is. They only have any clue of what it could be because of the conversation they’d overheard at the Winchesters’ ball.
Dean feels oddly offended, despite having no interest in actually being Michael’s vessel. “What’s the matter? I’m not good enough for you?”
This mission isn’t like the others, Castiel has noticed. His orders have been vague so far, just to stake out the area until more orders are sent, but he doesn’t understand their hesitation. Castiel is an excellent soldier, he could easily take out this killer if he could just track him down.
“It’s about his position within his garrison. We think the Novaks’ garrison was sent here to collect hunters, and Castiel is the one who's supposed to be reeling them in, if you will. We have no idea what they’re doing with the hunters once they get ‘em, though,” Charlie says, leaning closer to Dean. “Has he told you anything about it?”
“I have to say, Dean, I’m not pleased with how much has been revealed about our kind,” she says, an icy glare directed at Cas. “But I’m happy to indulge a hunter. You’re very important to us, after all.”
“See? Blend right in,” Dean says, amused at how annoyed Castiel looks. “No one would ever suspect that you’re an angel of the lord.”
A concerned guest turns and looks at him, and Dean laughs nervously. “Oh, he’s just kidding,” Dean says to the man, who just purses his lips and looks away. He sighs, and leans in closer to his dance partner. “Could we discuss this later, man? Too many curious ears.”
Dean’s smile falters. “My father died when we were still kids. A demon got him. My mother kept hunting after that, but I wouldn’t say she ‘raised’ us to be hunters. She kept us a respectable distance away from it, actually.”
“He’s messing with you, Castiel,” Uriel says, an amused look on his face. “The monkey loves to laugh.”
Dean stiffens, unsure what to say. “Great weather we’ve been having,” he says to his new partner, who just shrugs at him. The dance spins, and Dean returns to Castiel.
Dean is taken aback before shrugging. “Hey, I don’t have to hunt anymore, aside from the occasional things lurking around here. I have almost complete faith in my brother and his wife to support themselves. I don’t need much to be happy aside from a good beer and a sappy sunset.”
“Bring the horse,” Dean says, a smirk on his face. “You’ll get soaked and they’ll feel bad for you.”
“Yeah, cause they were gonna get my brother ganked by Lucifer!” Dean says, becoming increasingly infuriated by the second. “What the hell is wrong with you? You think you can just waste my brother and then kidnap me too for some fucking archangel to ride me until the end of time? I didn’t tell Cas to do
A couple of days later, Sam stomps through the door covered in blood. Dean and Mary rush to his side, asking if he’s hurt, but he insists he’s fine.
Castiel is looking at him, that usual intense stare, the one that’s searching his face for answers. He sighs. “Nothing, Dean. We’re leaving you out of it.”
Dean smiles. It looks like he wants to say something, but he just laughs to himself and shakes his head. Castiel looks at him with a raised eyebrow, and he just shrugs.
“I need to do what’s right,” Castiel finally says, and Dean looks up at him. He waits for more explanation, but then nods in agreement. “You’ll explain your whole side of the story to me, and then we’ll be ready once they catch up to us.”
When the light is gone, Castiel is in awe. He’s amazed that his superiors have trusted him with such an important mission, to secure Michael’s vessel for him so that he can save the world from damnation. He’s heard Dean’s name before. The cursed man. The one who caused the apocalypse and promptly abandoned it, leaving Heaven and Hell with no weapons but themselves. He was hated by all the angels, and seemingly demons too. He turned everyone’s world upside down and then ran away.
“We have to follow our true orders, Uriel,” Castiel says to his brother, his face serious. “Whether Gabriel agrees or not, the hunters have to be investigated. That Winchester…”
Dean bristles at this, feeling his own anger bubbling to the surface. “You know what, lady? Eat me.” Dean slams the door in her face, hoping she was done with her tirade and would just leave. After a few minutes, he looks out the window to confirm she’s gone, and then Dean goes outside, heading towards the river.
Dean’s eyes widen a bit. “Sounds like you have a little living to do, man,” he smirks. “I’ll buy you one if you don’t gank me.”
Castiel grabs the arm and easily twists it away from him, sending Dean backwards and putting some distance between them.
“Is something wrong, Dean?” Castiel asks him, and Dean opens his mouth when the dance partners swap, leaving him in front of a stranger.
Castiel thinks for a moment before sighing. “We were sent here to locate hunters that would help us with our mission. We were seeking the perfect vessel for Michael, so that he may fight Lucifer.”
Dean huffs. “They wanted to use me and my brother as cannon fodder. Here, I can work on my car, drink beer, do whatever I want, all while knowing he’s safe and off the grid.” He narrows his eyebrows. “How did you know I was here?”
Dean takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, more serious this time, more somber. Castiel looks at the man, rugged and bearded, his long eyelashes evident with his eyes closed, his freckles apparent in the sunshine.
“I guess you could say that,” Dean says, looking almost amused by this. “I’m a hunter, or I was at least. I killed monsters that were killing people. And as for the apocalypse…” he draws in a breath. “That one’s on you, bud.”
“What about me screams ‘hunter’, huh? Is it the hair? Is it how damn weird I feel being at a ball? Am I that obvious?”
The door opens, and a man steps into the store, sporting a raggedy beard and a blue flannel shirt. He goes straight to the cooler and grabs a six pack, and then heads over to pay. Castiel hangs back, observing him, before the man notices him staring. He looks Castiel up and down before nodding in acknowledgement and exiting the store.
A carriage is waiting for Sam and Dean outside, and Anna and Castiel are seeing them off. Without being asked, Castiel helps Dean up into his seat, the angel’s hand firmly grasping his.
“What Michael does will be righteous,” Castiel says, bristling. “It will be more righteous than anything you’ve ever done. You had an important role in Heaven, one you could have excelled in. You could have atoned for your sins, even.”
“His name is Dean Winchester,” he hears from the angels above. “He’s a killer amongst humans who started the apocalypse, but has a powerful vessel that would be useful to Michael. Extinguish his soul so that Michael can have what’s rightfully his.”
Not caring about Sam’s bloody shirt, Dean hugs his brother, eternally grateful that they have people looking out for them.
Dean finds himself nodding, thinking about staring into blue eyes as he’s dancing, and how he won’t get to do it again. They truly formed a strange friendship with the angels after all. Now they would move onto a new case, and he’s sure it won’t feel the same without them.
Dean and Mary head straight to Naomi’s house, where Dean hopes Castiel still is. He knocks on the door impatiently and prays that Castiel will be the one to open it.
Castiel closes his eyes for a moment, sending a message to the angels in Heaven. Once he opens them, Dean is looking at him in bewilderment.
Castiel walks towards Dean and holds his hand out towards Dean's chest, and he stiffens at first, but lets him. “This may hurt,” Castiel says, before searing a protective angel sigil onto Dean’s ribs. He draws in a sharp breath from the pain, but doesn’t react otherwise.
“We’re not sure how powerful they are, but if they’re the real deal…” Charlie says. “We’re screwed.”
