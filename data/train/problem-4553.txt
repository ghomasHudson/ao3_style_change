And then there had been his conversation with Balthazar. Of course, Cas knew the weird eye contact thing wasn't just a weird happenstance. Then, he had mentioned the tension in the office, the way Dean smirked when he said Cas's name, they way he had to know he was toying with him, and that he kind of liked it.
"De- Dean, I can't, I-," Cas gasped, and Dean slowed himself to a stop, pulling back to look at this artfully disheveled man in front of him. Cas blushed, catching his breath, "I'm sorry, I- it's been a while," he panted, casting his eyes down.
With the caffeine starting to bubble in his veins, he smiled enthusiastically, blue eyes wrinkling at their corners. Charlie, the Winchester Roasters hiring manager, had hit it off with him over many emails and a handful of phone calls, eager to bring him in and show him the place. She had admired his pages of work experience, as well as the enthusiasm he had for the company and his knowledge of the Roasters media presence.
At that, Dean glanced behind them towards the booths of Winchester Roasters employees, as if he forgot they were there. This had been Cas's intention, to distract him enough that he might forget where he was. While the idea of taking Dean home was, at this point, something Cas was definitely interested in, he was having a perfectly fun time with their banter. He glanced back at his table, where Charlie had taken his seat and was deep in conversation with the guys. "It seems Charlie took the last seat, huh," he mentioned, hoping Dean would take the bait to continue their one on one time.
Dean cleared his throat, rubbing the back of his neck. "Nice. Good. Warmer than usual." He glanced to Balthazar, who was sipping his coffee with a smirk, eyes flitting between the two of them.
Cas smiled, appreciative of the small caring gesture, "I don't want to take over your whole weekend, Dean. I should go."
, or maybe it was because he had too many. It wasn't Cas's business to force that on him, either way.
Cas grinned at them both. "Good morning gentlemen." He said, almost playfully. "Enjoying this sunny day so far?"
Dean fucking Winchester felt good about finally having a new personal assistant after a solid night's sleep and an espresso to get himself out the door. But then he got to the office.
"I hate that" he said as she strode into the office, a smirk playing at her lips. Charlie and Dean had met in college, bonding in their business classes over their similar taste in nerdy things. When he and his brother had inherited the company after their father fell ill, Dean knew he wanted Charlie with him every step of the way. At least she had remained loyal.
Through gritted teeth, Dean mumbled, "I'm on vacation, I'm not stalking you. I figured you'd have hit the east coast by now."
They stare at each other for a moment, before the pie and plastic container is clattering to the concrete and Dean takes two long strides forward. His arms are around the Angel before he knows it, fists balled into his trench coat at the tears spring back to his eyes.
Post shower, he heated up some leftover pizza, opting to eat curled up on the couch than like a civilized person at his little kitchen table. He was thinking about all the places he'd been in the past, and more specifically, all the people he'd been with in the past.
"Uh, what the hell dude? This guy is a nervous wreck and you couldn't even give him a warm welcome? What's going on?"
They were pulled from their conversation by Cas clearing his throat, walking toward them with Dean's phone showing Sam waving enthusiastically. "I gotta go guys, I'll talk to the guys over here and get more product up there by next week! Love ya'll!" Sam disconnected before anyone could respond.
Cas feels his face flush, but he lets out a laugh, trying not to let the embarrassment get to him. "Yes I suppose you're right, but I wouldn't mind seeing some more" he raised an eyebrow, playing into the joke. Might as well.
Dean, trying to play coy, smirked back at him, but faltered when he realized he hadn't thought of what to say when this confrontation eventually occurred. He held Cas's gaze over the rim of his cup, sipping slowly to buy himself some time.
Peering around the corner, Cas watched as a rain slicked Dean stepped from the doors and headed toward his office. His breath caught as Dean pulled his shirt off only midway to the doors, jogging the rest of the way. As the door clicked shut, Cas smirked to himself, nerves alight once more as he quietly made his way down the same path Dean had taken. He pressed an ear carefully to the door, making sure he heard nothing for a good minute before taking a deep breath and pushing inside.
He had mostly finished unpacking into this new little studio, not that he traveled with much anyway. Cas was grateful to be in a city with such excellent public transportation and also to be living kind of close to the office, not having to spend money on gas as frequently would be a blessing to his hopefully steady paycheck. His Kia Soul had taken up residence in a little permit only lot around the corner, where Cas was hoping she would stay safe. He was planning to take some weekend trips to drivable vacation spots around the Pacific North West, maybe even up into Canada, after he got himself settled here. He spent a lot of time on the road between jobs, and he loved it, but it was nice to have something bigger than a car to call his own for a little while.
“Oh, yeah? And what makes you think that?” Dean’s not really paying attention to Crowley. He moves parallel to the base of the rock, one hand trailing along it for balance, his eyes roving over the cliff to see if there’s a place he might be able to scale it.
The DJ works on setting up her booth at the head of the room as the meal gets underway. Their guests are seated at twenty-five circular tables positioned around the tent. He recognizes people from all over: Jesse and Cesar Cuevas have come from New Mexico; Aaron Bass, not accompanied by the Golem, has flown in from Europe; a couple of hunters who work as Park Rangers in Denali are sharing a table with a rowdy group from Virginia.
A woman’s screams fill Dean’s mind, and he’s back in that windowless room. Fire dances at the edge of his vision, shimmers in the blood pooled on the floor.
Dean’s fingers find Castiel’s dangling tie and he grips it, tugging slightly as he leans forward, closing the distance between them.
Castiel pushes himself away from the mantel and crosses the room to the table in the kitchen, where he picks up a chair. Watching him, Dean wonders what he’s going to do with it, and then he brings it back to the living area. Dean looks up in surprise as Castiel turns it around and places it squarely in front of Dean, then straddles it.
For the first time since he started walking, Dean stops. The sudden lack of motion feels strange but it barely registers; Castiel’s words are tumbling through his head.
Castiel folds his wings tightly again and thinks about it, then eventually he says, “They’re part of my true form—scaled to a sensible size for my vessel—and they don’t exist on this plane of reality. They’re connected to me so I can move them, and I feel them as a part of me, but I don’t feel them passing through this chair, for example. They don’t interact with anything that exists here.”
He looks Castiel in the eye. “But you deserve that. You deserve me telling you what’s in my heart. So um…” He withdraws a slim red envelope from the breast pocket of his jacket. “I wrote you a letter, and I wanna read it to you.”
It’s a modest place, a little run-down and far from perfect, but it’s got a big yard, tall trees, and a roomy detached garage. And it’s well-situated: their neighbors are far enough away that no one can get nosy, and they’re about halfway between the bunker and Mary, Sam, and Eileen—a twenty-minute drive either way.
play the victim. Even after I attacked him, he was only pretending to be dying. And that whole story about how if he died, the world would die? Just a story.”
“It’s really nice,” Dean says, nodding as he casts his eyes around the tent. “It’s great. And can you believe pretty much everybody dressed up!” He smacks Castiel’s arm with the back of his hand.
Dean walks with his hands jammed into his pockets, eyes narrowed against the wind. The going is slow, but only because of his knee; underneath a stiff crust the snow is fairly lightweight, and not too deep—maybe six inches in some places, a foot in others. The cold and the wind are worse.
After a few moments he grips the back of his chair, leaning over it. “Like you said, Sam, we have no idea where Michael is, or if he’s even still here. He could be out on the other side of the universe, for all we know.” Dean straightens and starts pacing again. “But we do know for sure there are three archangels in the Empty. And Billie was able to stick Jack in there, so you could get us in, right?” Dean says, turning to Death.
Dean doesn’t say a single word as Castiel prepares dinner, but follows his every movement in the kitchen. He’s trying to wrap his head around the sight of Castiel, his incredible wings folded against his back, stirring sauce in a pan on the stove. Castiel ignores him the entire time. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think Cas was making dinner for himself.
There will be an epilogue and at least one bonus work, to be posted some time after this year’s DCBB wraps up in December, so I recommend subscribing. ✨
Death wrenches the scythe from Chuck’s back and plants it on the ground. Dean and Sam grab hold of the handle, and it’s as immovable as a steel rod set in concrete. They brace themselves and pull with every ounce of strength they possess, Amara’s hands clasped in theirs.
“I can only assume that’s a result of having been imprisoned for an eternity. We don’t have time to put all the pieces together right now,” Castiel says firmly, “we just have to fix this.”
“Tell you what,” Dean says, “how ’bout we get T-shirts made: ‘I was tortured really bad and it sucked but then I helped save the world.’”
Dean rolls so that he’s facing the sky. The sun is low on the horizon, the sky streaked with wispy orange clouds. Is it sunrise, or sunset?
Dean sits down on the edge of his bed and rubs his face with both hands. If this is his last chance for sleep, he’d better take it. He stretches out and moves to turn off his lamp, and his eyes fall on his jacket hanging by the door.
“Let’s see,” Donna says, and she lists everyone off on her fingers. “I’ll bunk with Jody—if that’s okay with you, Jodes,” and Jody nods. “Patience is sharing Alex’s room while she’s home. Claire and Kaia share, and I think the girls were talking about Jack sleeping on the floor in there anyway. That leaves the pullout sofa. So, yep, we got the space!” She gives Dean a sunny smile, and he can’t help but smile back.
At the top of the stairs in front of the altar, Michael whirls on them, and the candle flames shudder in his wake.
“When you’ve warmed up, I’d like you to explain what’s going on,” Castiel says. He goes to the kitchen and begins looking through the cupboards.
Castiel isn’t looking at him, gazing instead off into the trees. If Dean knows anything at all, it’s that there’s something
Dean swallows at this. He and Sam have racked up a hefty body count between them, but Cas… once upon a time, he’d told Dean,
On the hour, they pull on their backpacks and depart; Jack flies them to the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. They land in morning sunshine on the cobblestones, a short distance from the large wooden double doors. Remarkably, the place seems to be undamaged.
They circle around Castiel’s wing to stand in front of him and Dean is dismayed to see that Castiel’s eyes are still glowing.
“I want to do all the stuff people do when they feel like this: I wanna bring you flowers, and leave you dumb little Post-Its with hearts on ’em. I wanna look up at the stars with you, and have you tell me about all the constellations, and about creation.” Here Dean swallows, and when he speaks again, his voice is soft. “I want to always come home to you. I want to make love with you. I want you to know, every day, for the rest of my life, how much I cherish you.”
There are lights on in the house, though. A slight warmth fills Dean, but it’s not enough to dislodge the blank expression on his face.
A second hand emerges, and Dean lets go of the scythe to seize it in both of his. Amara’s grip on him is desperate and painful, but it doesn’t matter because saving her is the only thing that matters; he holds on just as desperately. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees that she’s let go of the scythe—still embedded in Chuck’s back—and Sam has her other hand.
For all Cas’ leaving, he’s always shown up again. Of course, the first time they ran into Chuck, Cas had still been a soldier of Heaven, sent to protect the “prophet.” He’d still been coloring inside the lines of Chuck’s grand design.
“Suits, tuxes—whatever you want to wear.” Dean opens his mouth but Sam, not even glancing up, says, “Dean, you’re not wearing Fed threads to your wedding.” Dean shuts his mouth, and Sam moves on. “Rings.”
Jack withdraws the key to Death’s Library and holds it up. “There might be something in there—some way we can open and read this,” he says, resting his fingertips on the book’s cover.
“And then he hunted me down,” Castiel says grimly. His expression is so grave that Dean can’t take his eyes off him; in this moment Castiel is once again the fearsome being that strode into Dean’s cell and pulled him out of the fire.
Dean stays busy with hunting and helping Sam manage operations at the bunker, and Castiel, back to wearing his usual trenchcoat, helps Jack understand and use his powers. Dean, Castiel, and Jack all come and go as they need to, but they make time to have dinner together and to watch TV as often as they can. They’ve decided to work their way through all the series of
He sees red, nothing but red. He’s standing in a room with a locked door—the door is always locked—and no windows and there is blood everywhere. He can’t believe how much blood, he can’t— Did he do this? He couldn’t have, he couldn’t have, but— Oh, god, oh god oh god—
“I don’t know,” Dead admits. “But I’ll figure it out—just like you and Sam are gonna figure out how to find Michael.”
He lies on his back in the sand with his eyes closed, pulling in deep, shuddering breaths. His injured hand rests on top of his chest, throbbing, and in his other hand he clutches the vial of Jack’s grace.
Dean clenches his jaw. This has to be a result of Jack’s detonation, and Crowley’s right in that it might not be restricted to the Empty, considering Jack didn’t have his powers on Earth. “Damn it,” he hisses.
Jack doesn’t smile; worry creeps into his face. “I hope you can find Gabriel. I know you might not have a choice, but…” His voice becomes hushed. “I don’t want it to be Lucifer.”
Dean slowly rubs his palms together and casts his eyes around the empty clearing. Though the day is already warm, autumn is approaching. There’s the barest hint of it in the air, in the quality of the morning light, in the trees’ shade of green and the leaves that drift to the ground when the wind kicks up.
The younger set drifts into the living room where a big Christmas tree is still set up, and Dean follows Jody and Donna into the kitchen.
“Hey,” Dean says, glancing at him. He pulls off his coat and tosses it over the back of a chair, then goes to the fridge and opens it.
He says, “You two better not be talking too much shit about me.” This, he doesn’t sign—not because he doesn’t know the word for
Dean meets Castiel’s eyes, smiling a little, and squeezes his hand back. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you worry.”
“Oh, relax,” Gabriel says. He steps to the side of the corner cupboard and gestures lazily. From nowhere in particular comes a sound indicating a slot machine jackpot, and then a cascade of Reese’s packages tumble from the cupboard.
Dean picks up the cold, stiff toast and bites into it, and it tastes like nothing, but he chews and swallows and is determined to swallow everything else down, too—
Dean drops to his knees and slides, letting go of the angel blade to grab Castiel’s shoulders and pull him into his arms.
He gets up, staggers over to his sink, and gulps down a glass of water. Gasping, he wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, then refills the glass.
Dean’s hands are moving over Castiel’s body, grasping at him roughly, and when he reaches his shoulders, he tugs. “Please,” he says breathlessly.
“Anyway,” Charlie says, “I’m sorry it took me this long, but in fairness to myself, I did have eight years of technological advancements to get to grips with. I got there in the end, though.” She beams, clearly proud of herself.
He manages to fall asleep somehow, but he wakes before Cas and goes downstairs to get his clothes out of the dryer. The shirt’s a little wrinkly but the stupid vest will cover up the worst of it. He stuffs a crumpled twenty into the pocket of Cas’ jeans, then drops the clothes off back in the room. Cas is still asleep, so he heads across the street to get some McDonald’s since the motel sure as hell isn’t offering a continental.
Dean climbs into the boat and collapses on the floorboards with a grunt, soaking wet and breathing hard as the fear coursing through him gradually dies down.
Death sets it down on the table and opens the cover. Without looking up at them he says, “You’re welcome to have a seat while you wait.”
In the months since then, little has changed, overall; life at their farmhouse is simple and content. They are Jack’s primary parental figures; Dean has nicknamed Sam and Eileen “Unit Two,” and Mary and Gabriel are also highly involved. They hunt part-time and assist with operations at the bunker as the network and its resources continue to grow.
“In a few weeks, I’m gonna marry my best friend. I can’t believe how lucky I am. Thank you for saying yes, and for loving me.”
Dinner is served soon after: Gabriel snaps his fingers, and three buffet lines are suddenly heaped with food and drinks, and a bottle of champagne appears on the wedding party’s table. Though Castiel is indifferent to the food, Dean insists on filling a plate for him. So he eats, and lets his eyes wander the tent.
When Dean pulls away, opening his eyes, Castiel finds some indefinable reservation there, the barest hint of strain in his slight smile.
After a while, Castiel is able to make his way outside. On his way, he passes the memorial table, where many of the candles have been lit. It’s a sobering yet beautiful sight.
“We’ve been arguing for the last day or so. But trust a Winchester to break all the rules and beat the odds.” He smiles slightly.
They wait an interminable time, but it’s not as though they have anything else to do. Dean clasps his hands and rubs one thumb back and forth. Although he’s relieved there’s another heavy hitter in the game, Dean can’t let himself be hopeful. Even if the original Death was never anything like Billie, there’s no guarantee he’ll be on their side.
Jack. Dean nods and says, “Yeah, I might know something about that.” He stows his blade and walks past Crowley to push onward into the forest.
“You…” Alastair coughs and he gasps in shallow, wet bursts. Dean’s got both hands on the hilt and his arms tremble beneath the weight of Alastair’s body, held up by the blade. “You always did… such a good job.” He smiles at Dean, and then his dead eyes are truly dead, and the smile fades.
Castiel remains silent for a moment. “So you’re saying that… everything down by the lake—that was just you,” he says evenly. “Not the spell, impairing your judgement.”
They smile at each other, then Dean presses into Castiel’s side and points to the ring on the right. “That one’s yours. I made it second, so it turned out better than the first one.”
“Because there are two different types of turns,” Gabriel says. “Tacking is when you move the bow across the wind. It’s nice and easy. Jibing is when you move the
He points at them, eyebrows raised. “You two stay outta trouble, now,” he says, then jerks his thumb over his shoulder. “And I’m gonna head out.”
“It looks like you already have your ‘something blue,’” she says, her eyes on his bow tie. “Do you know that one? Something old, something new—”
“Well…” Jack says. He rubs his palms over the knees of his jeans, gathering his thoughts. “It was… nothingness.” He shrugs, as if unsure how to explain it further. “Infinite nothingness.” Jack shakes his head, but he begins picking at his blanket, squinting thoughtfully, so Dean waits.
Eileen rolls her eyes. “Don’t be ridiculous.” Her hand fists into the front of his shirt and she pulls him close, her fingers sliding through his hair as their lips meet.
“We were gone for some time…” Amara falters and she purses her lips, looking away. The shadows of rolling, blossoming clouds pass over her face, dulling its celestial shine, and the dome is pelted with a brief but violent shower of rain. Michael and Gabriel are visibly upset.
They stretch out, heads propped on their packs, and take out their books. Jack has a manga he picked up recently; he doesn’t seem to mind not being able to read the Japanese. Sam’s rereading a battered copy of
Lightning strikes somewhere close by, and it’s like a shotgun going off next to Dean’s head. He flinches but doesn’t let go of the scythe, and fear and adrenaline lend him strength.
Sam gets up from the table. “Actually… I was thinkin’ I would, too,” he says to Dean. “Eileen…” He gives Dean a shaky grin, complete with puppy-dog eyes.
Garth says, “You’ve also fought yourselves: the fear that presses in on us from outside, takes up residence in our hearts and minds, and leaves us separated from one another, distanced from love and from acceptance—acceptance of each other, and ourselves.”
There’s an even longer pause this time, long enough for his phone screen to turn off. Dean is just starting to think that Cas isn’t going to answer when he finally does.
Dean begins tracing the different feather segments with his fingers, and after a few minutes, apparently able to tell what Dean is doing, Castiel lifts his head and opens his eyes, watching Dean’s hand as he places it on the portion of his wing that’s like a shoulder.
Castiel sags with relief and collapses on the ground next to him, and they both lie there, breathing hard.
And he is careful, but what they’re hunting turns out to be a large pack of Nachzehrer. He hasn’t even changed out of his Fed threads when it goes sideways. Before they manage to kill the alpha and restore the pack’s humanity, there is a brutal melee, and Dean experiences a close call that leaves him hurt—not too badly—and shaken—badly.
“I agree,” Eileen says as Sam returns. He sinks into his chair and Eileen says, “Now I am just pretending to talk to you.”
Gabriel barks a laugh, opening one eye. “A boat like this, in a storm? If that happens, it was nice knowing you.” He sits up. “You said all this was you, right?” He gestures at the water surrounding them.
Inside, he glances around the familiar space, feeling strange for a reason he can’t identify. It could be the fact that, for the first time since he found Castiel in the Empty, he’s alone again. Or simply that this is the longest he’s ever been away from the bunker, his room, since they moved in.
Castiel tastes like how it feels to stand in a summer thunderstorm: wet and warm and bursting with the wild urge to laugh. He tastes like the second breath you take after coming back from the dead, the one where your brain has caught up to your body and it remembers:
For the most part, the master bedroom is Dean’s. Many of the things he kept in his room at the bunker have their own designated places around the house: his record collection is in the living room, and weapons and case-related materials are kept in the study downstairs. The bedroom is minimally furnished: there’s a dresser, an armchair next to the window draped with a blanket, and a bookshelf.
“You were making a joke,” Jack says, turning to Gabriel, who has found the candy stash in the corner cupboard.
Castiel looks over at Dean. “I chose to go to sleep,” he admits. “I thought it was the only way I’d ever see you and Sam and Jack again.”
“Yeah, true,” Dean says. He smiles wryly. “Unfortunately I’m not doing a whole lot of cooking these days.”
“These pages are censored,” Death murmurs, gazing down at the book. “I don’t know how that could be possible.” He actually looks confused, and it unnerves Dean.
Castiel places a warm hand on Dean’s cheek, and Dean reaches for Castiel’s shoulder and his hand grazes feathers. He opens his mouth to Castiel’s tongue, and grabs a fistful of his shirt and pulls him closer, as close as the chair between them will allow.
After a little while, when the cold has seeped out of him, he stands, toying with the keys as he moves off down the slope toward the tree line. It takes him a long time to reach the forest, but the walk is blessedly easy.
Dean pulls back just enough for them to look at each other, and he rests a hand on Castiel’s cheek. “You don’t have to say anything,” he murmurs, shaking his head. He smiles a little. “Say, ‘Let’s go home.’”
“You want to say all that stuff to me and tell me you love me, just so you can sacrifice yourself?” Certain vicious words are eager to spill from his lips, but he swallows them down and chooses different ones instead: “
On other days, Alastair reacquaints him with the rack, the whip, the knife. This often coincides with the times when Dean returns to himself, horrified by what he finds himself doing, by the shocking amount of blood, by how cold he feels. Despite the closed door, Alastair always knows when this happens. It doesn’t happen very often now, but they’ve never stopped locking the door.
Dean pulls onto the access road and drives slowly through the woods, aware that his breaths are becoming shallower with every rotation of the tires.
The ground is steep and rocky enough that Dean keeps his eyes on his feet as he goes, each step cautious. He doesn’t want a busted ankle putting him out of commission so soon after his knee has healed up.
“Yeah.” Dean debates with himself for a second, but decides that since Gadreel gave up his life to help Cas, he can trust him. “I’m looking for Gabriel.” He pauses, then adds, “And Castiel.” There’s a brief, dull flare of anger in his chest.
, and he could have walked out of there, but he’d chosen not to. He comes back to himself, on his knees with a bloody knife in his hand, surrounded by bodies. A girl screams—Claire screams—and Sam is begging Dean to tell him he hadn’t had a choice. But all Dean can say is,
He continues, “That money that Charlie secured to help us all out—there’s some of that for us, too. Eileen and I have been talking about getting a place in town, or maybe further away—but not
Dean comes in, carrying a half-melted pillar candle, taken from the “hunter” category of items in the closet. He sets it on the nightstand and lights it with his Zippo, then crosses the room to crack the window. The sound of the rain grows louder, sharp and soothing.
Castiel blinks at him and says simply, “I wasn’t ordered to stay with you.” There’s a pause and he adds, “I stayed because…” A faint, confused frown pulls his brows together. “I wanted to stay.”
He watches his reflection shift in the flickering torchlight; it twists momentarily into a face that resembles Alastair’s. He squeezes his eyes shut, terrified at the idea of his own dark transformation—and terrified of the being standing before him.
Dean makes a dismissive sound, and Sam ignores the exchange entirely, continuing to write. “A guest list… A location, which is gonna depend on the number of people you invite.”
They’re sitting on Baby’s hood on a warm, sunny afternoon, parked at a scenic overlook on a twisty little highway through the mountains. Dean gives his head a small shake and gazes out at the view, and Sam remains silent next to him.
Dean grins. “Yeah, I am,” he says softly. He glances down the path behind Castiel. “Come on,” he says. He takes Castiel’s hand.
Gabriel needed that position, that power, because he knew that the only way to force the Council to make changes he needed, was to do it from within. Gabriel had been patient, he’d played the long game and it was nearly time.
“Do an extra set for me later this morning when Gabe visits? You feel a little tense still, so he'll need to massage the internal muscles too,” Dean just nodded, he knew how important it was for him to keep his pelvix floor flexible and strong. Cas then slipped in both of Dean's daytime dilators, much smaller and more comfortable, designed to move with Dean’s body. They're more for monitoring purposes than anything else, as they had a full range of internal sensors.
Castiel considers his response to this very carefully. He knows Dean is likely to have developed maladaptive behaviours in response to past traumas, in addition to triggers and anxieties that will require extensive therapeutic intervention. He's tempted to ask Benny whether Dean's told him anything specific from his history, but he knows he will need to tread extremely cautiously when it comes to unpacking Dean's past.
“Not much. Just that he knew him from before. That he probably shouldn’t have spoken to him though.”
“Please,” Dean practically begs, “I need to finish this. I asked them. They didn’t want to but I convinced them.” Cas doubted that was very hard to do.
Cas worked his way up the spine until he reached Dean’s neck and then fanned out, sure fingers finding every knot, ache and tension in the muscles and guiding them back to complete relaxation. It’s a feat few have time for but his patience is seemingly eternal when it comes to Dean. Dean knew he enjoyed seeing him pliant and needy that’s exactly what he became. Arching up into the touch, letting him guide him under into utter languid calm, a quiet submission under his hands.
“So, I’ve got a couple of classes today and then I’m just in the studio in the afternoon. When are you thinking of coming by?”
Apparently, they drove me to the OSP centre and dumped me at the front door. No plates so they couldn't do anything. I was unconscious the whole time and the drug was out of my system. I didn’t wake up again for 36 hours.” Dean sighs, sounding ashamed but honest.
“I’ll tell you what I know of it, but I haven’t been told much. My Dad doesn’t like to talk about it. I’d suggest you speak to my uncle Bobby, he’s my Dad’s best friend and was there at the time. He might be willing to give you more details.”
Dean sits up easily, his Heat still pushing back much of the exhaustion, but his eyes are still vacant. He looks lost. They guide him into the bathroom and help him over to the toilet to release his bladder. IV nutrition is convenient, but it does mean a lot of liquid flows through Dean’s body.
“How was his first actual heat? It says here he needed hospitalisation.” Cas is almost afraid to ask.
Sam looked down at the object in his hands, he had picked up a picture frame from the side of his desk and was looking at the image of a brown-haired woman. Her eyes and face were smiling, easy and bright, her mouth open as if she’d been about to speak just as the photograph was taken, “This is my mother. She died giving birth to me, and Dad never remarried, so I was raised an only child. I always hoped we’d find him so I could have a brother.”
“How do I…?” he tried to ask, but she’d already walked out, “I guess I’ll just have to figure this thing out…” he peered down at the device doubtfully. He hated learning new technology.
“Yeah, I know he did,” he says it plainly, like he’s reciting a learned verse or pledge, not like he believes it, not fully, “He was still my father. I owed him.”
“Yes.  He placed Dean under the ‘Full and Permanent Guardianship’ of Caladh House. He named John as his primary guardian and me as his secondary. Due to the violent nature of Dean’s crimes, high flight risk and extreme vulnerability, his guardianship contract includes an exceptionally strict set of care requirements. I’ll give you a copy of the contract, but for example, he is required to wear a ‘full and leash’, be fitted with a  GPS tracker, a locked collar with the Caladh House name and contact details and be supervised whenever outside of the estate, and that’s just the supervision requirements. You should see the list of behavioural constraints!”
"Not since we've kept him isolated. It's the main reasons we made that decision. We’re doing our best to keep illness away from him, but we’re quite concerned about the development of immune deficiency syndromes.”
“Almost there sweetheart. I want to feel you as well as see you come,” he says wanting Dean to have the full simultaneous orgasm possible only for Omegas, knowing Dean struggles with it, but he wants to give him this. Make him know just how good it can be.
“I know you do, Honey, but I’ve finished my rut.” when he can't hold himself back any longer, Cas pulls Dean into his arms from behind, encircling him,  “It’s going to be both of us helping you now.”
Castiel shakes his head. “I was only human in the sense that I was more vulnerable than I had been, and I had no powers. To be truly human you need a soul. An angel without their grace is just a graceless angel, and would still go to the Empty upon their death.”
“That kinda thing used to scare the hell out of me. Now the only thing that scares me is the idea of losing you, or what we have. I mean you and me, but I mean Jack, too, and our home.
Jack beams at him. “Happy wedding day,” he says. “It was going to rain, but I was able to delay it.”
“Why?” Alastair sounds bored. Dean tenses and waits for the lash, but then he sees Alastair in his peripheral vision. He flinches before realizing Alastair is wearing a human face.
And some time after one in the morning, Dean’s in his room, propped up in bed on his laptop. There’s a time-lapse video of a classic car restoration playing, but his attention has drifted from it. He’s absentmindedly basking in his relief that Jack is alive again. The strength of his feelings is a surprise, but then, over the years the losses have become harder and harder to bear.
“Me, too. That reminds me…” Dean tugs the vial of grace out from beneath his shirt and smiles at the look of wonder on Jack’s face. “I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for this.”
An idea is taking hold in Dean’s mind, and a sudden restless energy pushes him to his feet; his chair scrapes the floor, the sound of it loud and grating in the quiet library. He begins to pace, and Sam and Jack half-turn to watch him.
Dean gathers himself, and then he continues reading. There’s a look of concentration on his face, and his voice is hushed and tight, but firm. “I love you, Castiel, and I always will. Until no one remembers we ever existed. Until the stars burn out. Until the end of everything… And I will love you for whatever eternity comes after that.”
One day—though it is always day—Dean spies a figure in the distance. They’re leaning against a boulder, arms folded, their face turned upward to the sun. Dean doesn’t know who it is, but even from this far away he can tell it isn’t Cas or Gabriel.
“It’s a good-luck tradition for brides,” Mary says, opening the box carefully. “This wedding doesn’t have any brides, but you can’t say no to a little luck, so we’re setting the both of you up with everything you need.”
Castiel says, “This past week, you were so quiet… I thought something might have happened in South Carolina.”
After Dean had gone, they’d plugged in all of their electronics to charge up while they still had power, but yesterday they’d lost internet access.
Dean says, “So those times you got brought back—after Raphael, after Lucifer, the Leviathans—that was Chuck, making sure his secret stayed safe in the Empty.”
And god help him, Dean glances down at Castiel’s mouth. Heart pounding, he drags his eyes back to Castiel’s, and they’re staring at each other, and Dean is thinking,
In the hazy darkness, Castiel takes off his suit jacket and tie and rests them over the back of the armchair, then removes his shoes. He lies down with his hands clasped beneath his head and listens as Dean rummages through the closet in the hallway. It houses an odd mix of ordinary domestic items (towels, bedsheets, bars of soap) and the kinds of things that would only be found in a hunter’s house (a spare machete, an urn of Baku ashes, a vial of dried Niedzwedzkia petals).
“Hey,” Dean says, “you wanna watch a movie or something?” He grabs his laptop. “There’s a Western I haven’t seen in a while—
“You could have an officiant,” Sam says, “even if the ceremony’s not legal. To walk you through it.”
The outcropping he’s been aiming for is a long way away, and the passage beyond might as well be on the moon—and his soul hadn’t bothered to put one of those in the sky.
Castiel breaks away from the group and strides over to Death. “Maybe, or maybe not. They told me there were pages you couldn’t read because they’d been censored.”
There’s a sudden, almost painful pulse in Dean’s chest, and he realizes the pull is straining desperately in the other direction. He drags his eyes away from the horde, looks down into the valley.
This door isn’t completely closed, and Castiel wonders if it’s an indication of anything. If it’s an invitation.
“I used to think maybe I wasn’t built for what we have together. But it turns out I am—you just have to find the right person. And I know the way we found each other wasn’t anything pretty, and the road to where we are now was rough, but I wouldn’t change a single thing about it, and if I had to, I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat. Because I can’t live without you.” Dean frowns down at the letter, at the idea he’s just brushed against. “I think you know that, but I’m telling you just in case you somehow didn’t know.”
Jack’s set them down right outside the library, a freestanding building that hadn’t sustained any damage. It’s unchanged from the last time they’d seen it—even the few scattered backpacks on the walkway leading up to the doors are still lying where they’d fallen when their owners had disappeared.
“Since you were apparently excited to go buy a chainsaw,” Sam says. “Let me have my coffee, would you?” He waves Dean off. “Go have fun with your new toy.”
If only he hadn’t been so afraid, they wouldn’t have ended up in that room—that room, and so many others, both figurative and literal.
“Sam—I dig the beard,” Chuck says, gesturing to his own face. “Dean, you’re looking a little feral. With the bloody handprint, and the angel blade. That’s cool.”
With difficulty, Dean tears his gaze away to look at Castiel. Castiel reads the unspoken question in Dean’s eyes, and in a low voice that’s almost a growl, he says, “Yes.”
He forces himself to take another bite, and imagines that he and Sam and Jack will wander the Earth eating food out of cans until they die. Dean’s lips twitch into a ghost of a smile at this, thinking how infuriatingly boring that will be for Chuck to watch.
A soft sound, like something ruffling in the wind, reaches Dean’s ears. He opens his eyes and breaks their kiss with a gasp.
Dean closes his eyes and breathes against the surge of hurt and anger. But despite everything, neither of those are a match for the desperate relief he feels at the sound of that voice.
“Seriously, Cas.” Dean cranes his head so Castiel will look at him. “I don’t want you going down that road.” Dean understands the compulsion, though, so he adds, “But if you gotta, then you’re not going by yourself, okay?”
Castiel sighs and drags his eyes to Dean’s. “Yes, I’ll still be here,” he says wearily. “I said I would stay, so I’ll stay.”
“It couldn’t be more perfect,” Castiel says, gazing outside, and then a thought occurs to him. “Wait a minute…” He turns to Jack. “Is this your doing?”
He realizes that they’re all watching Dean, who is standing in a circle with a group of hunters. Just then, a new song begins, but it loops after only a few seconds. The drums and cymbals are familiar to Castiel, but he can’t quite place them. After a few more loops, though, he recognizes the song: it’s one he heard often on the Continental’s radio.
“Breakfast,” Dean says, going to the rickety table in the corner. He sits down and focuses on pulling stuff out of the bag until Castiel sits down across from him.
He finds a stream and it aligns with the pull, so he follows it, walking through shafts of sunlight. Other than the wind in the trees, the happy splashing of the stream, and his footfalls, the place is silent. Through the canopy, massive clouds scud across a bright blue sky.
The photo session ends up being surprisingly comfortable. Nikita and Steven give them gentle direction, but for the most part it feels to Castiel like he and Dean are simply spending time together while they happen to be having their picture taken. They talk, and laugh, and kiss, and the sun sinks toward the horizon.
The sea is choppy and the sky leaden, with flat, low-lying clouds stretched across it as far as the eye can see. The sun is obscured and the water has gone from a glittering blue to a dull iron gray. It’s not raining anymore, but the temperature has dropped slightly, and Dean winces at the chill of the sea spray when it hits his face.
Castiel sits down next to him. His hair is still wet and carries the scent of generic hotel shampoo, and he’s radiating warmth, like the humidity of the shower is clinging to him.
He murmurs, “I don’t know if I’m the person you think I am… But I want to be. And I’m sure as hell gonna try.”
He gets dressed and sits on the shore, allowing both himself and Jack to have a little time to themselves. Soon enough, though, the mosquitoes become unbearable. Although Chuck had made most of the earth’s animals disappear, insects remained. And with many of their predators gone, their populations have increased.
wasn’t legal. No one got hurt or anything like that! But I think the less anyone knows, the better. I’m not a very good liar, so please don’t ask me any questions.” She looks at Sam with wide, imploring eyes.
Sometimes, through the heat haze, Dean sees a thin shape arced over their back; eventually he realizes that the person is an angel, and he’s somehow catching glimpses of the tattered remnants of their wings. Although the angel doesn’t give any indication they’re aware of him, Dean draws his blade as he approaches.
Dean swivels on the stool and his eyes land on the sink. He laughs softly. “Washin’ dishes at the end of the world. Had no idea how things were gonna go.” He looks over at Sam. “But we had each other.” He smiles and takes a drink of his beer. “Now here we are.”
Either way, Dean’s here now: sailing across the sea, the tiller in one hand and the mainsheet in the other.
Castiel sighs softly and rests his cheek on his wrist, eyes still closed. Dean looks at him and he seems to be mostly at ease, except for the way his hands are gripping the chair and the way his breathing doesn’t seem entirely relaxed.
“It’s nothing like that,” Castiel says, radiating impatience, and Dean finally realizes that he’s deeply agitated. “Let’s go.” He drops his hand onto Dean’s shoulder and then they’re standing at the bunker’s front entrance.
Dean looks away from it, focusing instead on Jack, who sets Chuck’s book down on top of the mess on the table. After a brief search under some papers he finds the box with the grinning red skull on the lid. Dean’s fingernails bite into his palm.
Next, he opens his notebook, where he keeps a detailed log. He starts his entries off with the date; time doesn’t mean much anymore but his watch still keeps it, so he does, too. He records the areas they’ve visited, and jots down notes that might be helpful later on:
He rubs his eyes and checks his phone; it’s six in the morning. He sits up on the sofa bed and stretches, then grabs his bag and gets changed in the downstairs bathroom.
Dean is just starting to think that if they can hold their position for long enough, Jack and the angels will be able to finish things, and then Sam lets out a sharp gasp.
Castiel approaches the garage silently enough that when he steps into it, Dean doesn’t notice his presence. He’s perched on the barstool at his workbench, intently focused on the notebook he’s writing in. His T-shirt and jeans bear swipes of grease and motor oil. As Castiel watches, he appears to rethink what he’s just written, then crosses it out, his dissatisfaction audible in the scratches of the pen digging into the paper.
His attention is drawn from the carcass by a pleasant rippling sensation beneath his skin. He lifts a crimson-coated hand to examine it, frowning with detached curiosity. His skin seethes for a moment, like boiling water, and then it settles. As his eyes trace the shape of his fingers, he observes his skin darkening to an inky blackness that swirls like smoke.
Once, Dean would have struggled to accept this, but now he just smiles as he pours himself a cup of coffee. “Does this mean I get to call you Samwitch?”
When Dean gets to his room he stands at the foot of his bed and surveys the weapons on the wall over the headboard: various rifles, his Purgatory blade, a Bowie knife, a couple of machetes.
Then comes the day Dean fails to keep his rage under control, and he strangles his victim… and for the first time, Alastair doesn’t carve him up again.
He opens the book and Jack looks over his shoulder. “What do you think?” Sam asks, running his finger down the table of contents. “You want to do country by country? Or random?”
“How long,” Castiel says, dragging his finger all the way up to his shoulder, “do you think we should let this go on, before we tell them the truth?” He raises his eyebrows.
Dean shoves the centerboard in, takes the tiller, and then gathers the slack in the mainsheet until the sail is taut and they’re moving again, following the pull in his chest.
The next song is a slow one, something Castiel thinks might be by The Rolling Stones. He and Mary sway gently, and through the crowd he spots Dean and Claire slow-dancing, too. Dean catches his eye and winks at him.
Staring down at his hands, Jack says slowly, “We’re not even halfway through the United States and… the world is a big place.” He looks up at Sam, wearing a frown. “It feels like it’s taking such a long time, and all we can do is move around, and pray, and hope that Michael will answer us—if he can even
His wings can’t feel earthly winds, but he stretches them out and ruffles his feathers before folding them against his back. In birds, rousing indicates contentment. But for Castiel, it’s more like the human action of shaking out one’s arms. Every part of him is filled with nervous energy.
“No, no,” Gabriel says, shaking his head. “Just… wanted to say thanks, y’know.” He shrugs awkwardly. “For everything.”
Amara nods. “Many of the monsters you’ve encountered were created by Eve, who was created by Chuck. But humans also developed their own magics, their own beliefs, their own gods.” There’s a slight, admiring smile on her lips. “For better or worse, the supernatural is woven into the fabric of this universe. And thanks to Chuck’s constant and significant interference, that fabric is now incredibly delicate. There’s only so much I can—” She cuts herself off, pauses, and then says, “There is only so much I am willing to change.”
Castiel turns over in his sleep and goes still again, and Dean looks over at him. It’s so fucking weird to see him
Sam grins and sweeps her up into a bridal carry, and Eileen lets out a startled laugh, wrapping her arms around his neck. He strides up the walk and into the house, both of them giggling, and kicks the door closed behind them.
With gasping praise, they coax each other to climax. Dean moans raggedly, staring into Castiel’s eyes, and Castiel breathes Dean’s name, gripping his hand.
Dean lifts his head and props himself up on an elbow, looking down at Castiel. Castiel searches his face for any sign of the burden he’s been carrying, but Dean lowers his lips to Castiel’s for a long, unhurried kiss.
Sam grips the scythe’s handle above Death’s hands, and Dean gets hold of it below them, and they start pulling.
Chuck folds his hands, appearing pleased that Dean has brought this up. “I am, yes.” He shrugs. “But knowing everything
Jack is sitting up on his bed. The laptop is plugged in beside him, closed and with the flash drive resting on top of it. Dean realizes he must be waiting to watch the videos Kelly left him.
There’s a picture of Sam and Cas, Dean and Jack, taken by either Charlie or Stevie; they all look like they’ve just been laughing about something but Sam can’t remember what it was, now. Another of him and Dean, at Bobby’s having a couple of beers, Sam smiling and Dean grinning at someone outside the frame—Cas. There’s a photo booth strip of four pictures of him and Eileen; they’re crammed into the tiny space together, laughing, making goofy faces, smiling at each other, kissing.
The foliage at the edge of the clearing bursts into a wall of flames, throwing a hellish light over the terrible scene.
“He did seem different when I talked to him, that night we all got back through the portal,” Dean says thoughtfully. “Less of a jerk.”
“The battle was so instantaneous and confusing, we never even knew you’d been there,” Gabriel murmurs to Castiel.
There isn’t much in the fridge. He should have eaten on the way home, but he just hadn’t had the appetite. Dean closes the fridge with a small frown.
“Hold up,” Sam says, frowning as though Dean has lost his mind, and hell, maybe he has. “We don’t know ‘for sure’ there are three archangels in the Empty.” He stands as Dean continues pacing. “Jack detonated in there—it probably wiped everyone out.”
A few minutes later Sam is startling awake, talking about visions from God, and Dean’s finding out Sam had gotten infected by Rabids and hadn’t told him. The next day, Dean’s getting the shit beat out of him by some undead freak. And down the line they find out Chuck is actually God, and they have to kill his sister, so Dean becomes the weapon that’ll do it.
Castiel rolls his eyes and opens his arm invitingly, and Dean presses into Castiel’s side and rests his head on his chest.
He doesn’t need to be protective of Cas. Cas might be wearing a ratty old Zeppelin tee with a hole in the armpit instead of his trenchcoat, but so what? Just because he’s graceless and sleeping in a shitty motel, instead of powered up and able to fly wherever he wants to, doesn’t mean he’s helpless.
Now all he has left is the ugly lie, and its wrongness is unbearable. So he lets go of it—the idea he’s been clinging to.
Dean runs his hand lightly along the firm edge that reminds him of a bicep, and he feels Cas pressing his wing back into his touch.
Sam’s mouth is tingling, and his face feels strange. Frowning, he touches his cheek to find it clean-shaven. He realizes he tastes mint, and he laughs.
Crowley hesitates, appearing to consider it. But then his expression smooths over. “Thanks for the offer, but I’ll leave you to it. This type of do really isn’t my style. Too much rock and roll, too little nudity.” He smirks.
Eventually Mary breaks the silence, saying, “It’s been more than a year since we all came back through the portal.”
He gets up to wash the dishes, and Sam grabs a towel to dry things off. Given their situation, this chore is probably unnecessary, but the normality of it is soothing.
The words themselves hadn’t been a surprise, because: of course. Of course that’s what’s at the core of their friendship. Why the hell else would they do all the things that they have for each other?
One day, Rowena arrives at the bunker accompanied by a dark-haired woman with a slight but playful smile.
Sam digs through his pack for the pictures he’d brought. He spends a long time looking at the photo booth shots of him and Eileen, rubbing his thumb absently along the edge of the strip. Where Sam might once have prayed to God, now he just thinks,
Sometimes Sam will suggest wrapping up a prayer session early, or he won’t have an appetite, or he tries to get Jack to let him have his night shift because he’s not sure he can sleep. But Jack will insist that they continue praying, that Sam eat something, that he get some rest.
One day, Jack requests that Castiel and Dean take him to the playground where Heaven’s gate is located. He sits in the middle of the back seat on the way there, with a long cloth-wrapped object laid across his lap; it nearly touches either door. When Dean asks what it is, all Jack says is, “You’ll see.” But he smiles and, with a hint of pride, adds, “I built it myself.”
Sam nods, but he doesn’t answer immediately. The fire crackles and the leaves sway in the trees above them, and the night is filled with the sounds of crickets and katydids.
Dean stands slowly, then scuffs at the ground with the toe of his boot, savoring the gritty sound of it. He’s unsure what to make of this development, and decides that all he can do is keep walking.
The stream gradually widens, and after some time Dean picks up on a familiar sound. He reaches a waterfall and peers over the small cliff; about thirty feet below, there’s a sizable pool, and it seems as though it might actually have some depth to it. Dean gazes down at it, playing with the keys.
he says, shaking his head, but his voice doesn’t work; his throat is raw and all he can do is mouth the word over and over again, like if he can say it then it will make it all untrue. But his voice is broken and it is true, will always be true.
Night has brightened into a new day that is an old day; it’s windy enough to rival what happened during the battle.
Dean grabs Alastair’s wrist, trying to push him away, but Alastair is indifferent to his efforts. He tugs on the chain until the pendant of Jack’s grace slips free of Dean’s collar, and Alastair cups it in his palm. He drops it quickly, sucking in a sharp breath as if in pain, and Dean glimpses a sear on his hand before Alastair straightens and kicks Dean again.
He sets his eyes on one of the lower outcroppings of rock, takes a deep breath, and starts up the slope.
“No, no…” Dean whispers, shaking his head in dismay. He turns in a full circle. “No, you were supposed to be here.”
Sam looks over in confusion. Gabriel raises his beer and winks slowly at him, in a way Castiel is certain could be described as “seductively,” then adds an air kiss, all while holding eye contact.
Dean places a hand on Castiel’s cheek, and kisses him so gently it makes Castiel ache. Dean exhales a shaky breath, his forehead pressed to Castiel’s.
Dean stares into Cas’ eyes for a long moment—longer than he ought to, probably, but Cas has always had a tendency to stare anyway, so it’s not like he’s going to call him out on it. Dean finally nods and slumps back against the Impala. Their shoulders are brushing, and his hands feel empty; he wishes he had the keys to play with. “Bluest eyes I’ve ever seen, I think,” Dean says, offhand. But he doesn’t think, he knows.
They part, just enough for Dean to press his palm to Castiel’s cheek, and Castiel places his hand over Dean’s heart. Their noses brush, and Castiel exhales against Dean’s lips, and their mouths find each other.
Dean whirls on Crowley. “Yes, Cas is here. And yes, we broke a big cosmic thing, okay. I’m in here trying to fix it.” He spreads his arms:
But what had Chuck said to Cas, the last time they’d seen him? That after Cas had raised Dean from Hell, he hadn’t done what he was told—unlike all the other Castiels. Their Castiel—
His body clock had gone haywire after what he’d guess was a matter of hours, but he couldn’t say how many. He thinks that maybe at this point, he’s been walking for days.
He finally comes to a stop half-buried in the snow, the cold burning his face. He lies still, just breathing. He’s shaken and his body hurts, but he doesn’t think he’s seriously injured. His knee is throbbing like it has its own heartbeat, though, and he hopes it isn’t any worse.
“I knew it wasn’t gonna be easy,” Dean says, refocusing on his laptop, “but no one ever told me it’d be this frustrating.”
Dean pushes himself forward to sit on the edge of the couch, unable to help himself. “How do they…” He gestures. “How do they do that?”
Stepping over the threshold into the bunker, Dean absently brushes a hand over his chest; there’s something stirring between his ribs, cautious but alive. He crosses the room and retrieves the damaged book from the floor, then sets it gently on the table.
“It’s probably for the best,” Jack says, stooping to pick up the rest of the packages of Reese’s from the floor. “Hey, can I see the rings? And can we watch
Castiel, who seems not to have been paying attention to this exchange, says, “I thought something felt wrong, when I was looking for you.” He frowns at Dean. “Gabriel is right—the entire planet is vacant.”
As usual, the situation they were facing was pretty bad—they’d released the Darkness and they had to deal with that somehow. But Sam was okay, and Dean had gotten rid of the Mark, and Cas was cured of that goddamned spell.
“It’s true that I’m his older sister,” she says. “We co-existed quite happily for a very long time. And then eventually, I began to create.
coursing through his veins. He remembers clutching the blade in his blood-slick fist, striking her burned-out face again and again, until the bones caved in.
Dean pauses, lips parted, looking into Cas’ eyes. He draws a shallow breath. They could stop right now, back away from all of it. Dean licks his lips, and Cas glances down, watches the movement of Dean’s tongue before letting his eyes travel slowly back up to Dean’s, and Dean can feel Cas’ warm breath on his lips as Cas exhales, leaning just a little bit closer.
, he’d have a chance to trick me into giving him my power, and then nothing would threaten him. And it worked. But of course he underestimated you.
Dean turns his head and sees that snow has begun to fall in thick, whirling flakes. He smiles. “Good thing I’ve got you here to keep me warm,” he murmurs.
Dean looks over at Castiel. The suit jacket and trenchcoat are still lying on the front seat where he’d left them, and who knows where the tie ended up. The top two buttons of Cas’ dress shirt are undone, exposing a distracting amount of skin. Compared to what he usually wears, he’s practically naked.
Jack appears to think about this for a long time. Finally, he says quietly, “So maybe he’s just as lost as we are.”
Rattled, Dean sits up and opens his eyes, but the words are loud in his head and heavy enough to slip out of his mouth. “What if I can’t find you?”
“Listen,” Dean says, grabbing Crowley’s arm and pulling him a few paces away. “I need you to find Gabriel.”
But for now, he unbuttons his jacket and shirt and settles himself on the grass to catch his breath.
Castiel opens the door and finds Jack sitting on his bed, wearing the pendant containing his grace. He’s holding his headphones and Kelly is paused on the screen of the laptop sitting near him.
He’s been here now for much longer than he was ever in the forest—weeks, maybe. Dean closes his eyes as he recalls the deep cool beneath the trees, the caress of leaves as he pushed through foliage.
“And Alex is a workaholic, which is why she’s not here right now, but we still love her,” Claire finishes.
“The three of them are still up there talking,” Gabriel says, making a vague gesture with one hand. “Four of them, I should say. Sounds like Michael and Adam are gonna stick together and help Amara out.”
“You’ve certainly earned it!” Mary tells her. “I'm the last person who’d have any idea what you did, but thank you for all of your hard work.”
Death smiles at him but doesn’t respond. Instead, he turns to Jack and raises his eyebrows, indicating Chuck’s death book. “That’s a weighty thing to be carrying around.”
“No! Help me!” Jack wrenches his backpack off and starts tearing through it. He finds the box holding the key to Death’s Library and thrusts it at Sam, then resumes digging through the bag. Sam hurriedly stows the box in his own pack and turns back to Jack as he’s stuffing his flash drive into his pocket. Jack stands, leaving his pack on the ground, and holds his hand out to Sam.
Dean’s world narrows to the ground beneath his feet. He focuses on each painstaking step, on keeping weight off his knee, on maintaining his balance.
“Cas,” Dean gasps. “Hey, hey—Cas!” Castiel’s eyes are moving under his lids. “Wake up—I need you to wake up.”
Still. Dean grits his teeth. He’ll wander through this damn forest for as long as it takes him to find Cas and Gabriel.
His hand is swollen and aching, and his knee hurts. A lot of things hurt. Fortunately nothing is broken, but he’ll have some spectacular bruises later. Swallowing is painful, and he’s lost his voice.
She turns on her microphone and says, “Good evening, everyone! I hope you enjoyed dessert. We’re going to kick tonight off with a first dance between the grooms. Gentlemen, if you want to make your way to the dance floor…”
A small laugh escapes Dean as they close the distance between them. Castiel’s hand finds his waist, and Dean’s fingers curl around the back of his neck, and they kiss for a long, drawn-out moment as the people they love most applaud them.
Dean can’t see Death or Castiel from where he’s standing just behind Jack, but he’s got a clear view of Michael and Gabriel. Hands held up before them, they are formidable statues as the howling wind tears at their hair and clothes. The glow of their eyes is especially unearthly in the low light, bright enough to illuminate their faces: cold like carved marble and fierce with inhuman effort.
And he can use it. As he climbs higher, surpassing the point he’d reached earlier, he uses it like an ice axe, driving it into the new, unbroken snow to anchor him for each step.
“Jack,” Castiel says, “Dean asked me to marry him, and I said yes.” Castiel smiles as Jack’s face lights up.
A wave of respect rises inside Dean, then turns to regret as Gabriel screams, light pouring from his eyes.
blue.” It occurs to him that he sounds like an idiot, but fortunately thanks to his good mood and the whiskey he doesn’t care.
Dean finishes a long and treacherous climb out of a ravine only to find a towering rock face hemming him in on all sides. He heaves a sigh, then rests his back against the wall and slides down it. He’s going to have to climb down again and find some other way.
Jack gets out of Mary’s car and hurries over. Mary, Garth, and the photographers aren’t far behind. Jack is practically vibrating with excitement. “Are you ready?”
Home, not home—whatever it is, he figures he should get there. Whether Cas or Jack will be there, he doesn’t know, but at least his bed will be waiting for him.
He hesitates for a second, but Jack is an adult and deserves to be treated like one, so he says, “Lucifer would wail on one of us and when he got bored, he’d switch targets.” He shrugs. “I’m the one who put Michael in the Cage, and we never tried to get him out again, even after we freed Lucifer.
The walls are made almost entirely of stained glass, the panels almost fifty feet tall and packed with thousands of intricate details. Early morning light pours into the chapel, and the place is a riot of soft color, a delicate rainbow held in the sturdy embrace of Gothic architecture.
Mary nods. “And got him back to this world. Crowley spent a year with us over there,” she says. “And it was a hard year—I don’t need to tell you that.” Jack is nodding earnestly. “Maybe after being there, after going through that with all of us, he just... doesn’t want to contribute to the suffering of the living, anymore.”
He opens his eyes to see earth and sky rolling together in a nauseating blur. When he finally has the presence of mind to spread out into the shape of an X he stabilizes, only to find that he’s utterly alone.
He stands at the just-frozen edge of the lake for a long time, hands stuffed in his pockets, breath pluming before him. The winter stillness, settled over everything around him, envelops him, too. He thinks about the decision he’d made before falling asleep earlier: moving out, moving on.
Dean turns the paper over; and Castiel sees his hands are shaky. His own heart is pounding. Dean takes another deep breath as his eyes find the top of the page, and he continues with greater confidence.
In the corner, sheltered from the wind and far from the dance floor, is a small table. On it rests a tall pillar candle and dozens of tea lights. A simple sign invites guests to light a candle. Castiel and Dean stand on either side of Jack as he uses Dean’s Zippo to light the pillar. Once the flame catches, Jack gazes at it for a contemplative moment, and Dean rests a hand on his back.
But Dean can’t handle pulling into that driveway again, hoping there might be someone waiting inside the house for him. He can’t do it.
The kitchen is deserted, but someone has been cooking. There’s a foil-wrapped baking dish on the island with a note resting on top:
He says this in a matter-of-fact way, but Dean still feels a stab of guilt. If he’d gotten there five minutes sooner this wouldn’t have happened. It also wouldn’t have happened if Dean hadn’t kicked him out of the bunker.
“Besides,” Castiel says. He smiles down at Dean, eyebrow raised. “If you think there’s anything in creation that could keep us apart, then you haven’t been paying attention.”
Dean should be asleep, too, but he’s not tired. He’s staring at his laptop screen without really seeing it, thinking about what Sam had said earlier.
Dean turns his head, and the horde fills his line of vision. There are hundreds of them on the front lines, and Dean can clearly see Lucifer leading the march. Dean has minutes, maybe, until they’re here.
As he works, Dean realizes with utter detachment that his toast days are numbered. The people who make butter are all gone. Hell, the
Dean turns to look at them. Jack is gesturing as he speaks, and Castiel has a hand on his shoulder as he listens intently. Sam nods at whatever Jack is saying, then adds something to the conversation. There’s nothing remarkable about what Dean is seeing, but it takes his breath away for the simple, yet profound reason that these are the three people he loves most in the world.
“Ever since Jack fixed Cas’ wings, the two of them haven’t been around much. They’re always off doing… I dunno, angel stuff. So…” He trails off and shrugs.
When he gets to the top he dusts off his hands and observes that Crowley is still standing on the other bank, with apparently no interest in following him to the other side. “What’s next for you?” Dean asks.
“Yes,” of course Cas had, it was an ugly line, deep and sore looking still, circling right across from Dean’s lower leg till it reached up behind, almost up to his backside. He’d known it hurt Dean to think on so had never mentioned it, once he ascertained that it no longer caused Dean any pain or loss of mobility he had let it lie, let the past remain past.
Dean turns a little guiltily in his seat and looks over at Cas, “Sorry, yeah, let's do that. Morning got away from us.”
“Remember sweetheart. Nil by mouth until I say so. You can suck on some ice to wet your mouth but that’s it.”
Dean fights the cuffs, struggling as they rise up into the ceiling, pulling him relentlessly up till just the tip of his feet rest on the ground.
Cas brings him his ice chips, kisses him affectionately on the head before casually arranging the tubing.
By the time Cas led him over to the toilet Dean’s eyes were watering, his hands clenched at his sides in the effort. Cas sat him down, letting him rest his head against his stomach as he let go, shushing him and running his fingers through his hair comfortingly.
“Thank you for taking the time to meet with me,” he shook Sam’s hand warmly, “I appreciate all the information you were about to provide and for these files. I’m sure they’ll be very helpful. I think it’s time I met Dean and his treatment team.”
“I let him fuck me. That man yesterday. In the club. I asked for it,” Dean says it so quietly that Cas barely catches the words, ashamed and whispered to the water that surrounds them. Cas had run a bath and now they rest, curled around each other, limbs entwined, soaking away what they can of the earlier pain.
Dean’s bedroom was also fairly large and well lit, with a huge window on the side facing out into the garden. It was painted a sunny sort of light green, with darker green curtains, wooden floorboards, and a large cream coloured rug in the centre. It looked nice, like someone had tried very hard to make it feel nothing like a hospital room.
And he wants it now. Wants to get to the part where he had Cas’s inside him. Where he can feel Cas’s fingers smoothing down the straps, working him open. He’s had enough waiting.
Gabe could see the moment Dean fell back into subspace. His eyes grew wide, his irises blowing out, then he swallowed instinctively. Finally docile in his lover's arms.
Castiel nodded, he’d finally had a chance to read over Dean’s recent medical records. He’d have to read the older ones later, when he had the time. There had been copies waiting for him in his room, and overall, he had been quite impressed with Dean’s care team. Their records we comprehensive and informative, detailing a long list of attempted and abandoned treatments, changes in medication regimes, test undertaken and so much more.  He still he also had a long list of questions, but he knew that Sam wouldn’t been able to answer the medical ones.
“That’s good sweetheart. Just one more thing.” Cas says as clips a new bag to the waiting IV stand, it can drain while they talk, Dean glares at it but doesn’t protest.
“Sure. I’m not certain if he’s always had them, or if they’re a symptom of his DDS, but they’re definitely getting worse. He’s particularly sensitive to texture, sound, taste and touch. He struggles with loud noises and bright lights, although he didn’t used to have major issues with those. Taste has been a constant problem, but recently it’s gotten so bad that, this morning we had to fit him with an NG tube. And boy, did he kick up a fuss about that!” Benny grimaces.
Luckily, the medical supplies were kept by the door so it was easy enough to grab a tube of glucose gel from the shelf, the injection kit and an energy bar for Cas.  He brightened the lights a bit, signalling his presence. Dean pulled his arms up to cover his eyes, growling low and frustrated. Cas, however, seemed more lucid, pulling himself up to meet Gabe’s eyes calmly, but obviously not up to talking much.
Gabe doesn’t touch him yet, he’s waiting for something, searching Dean’s face for some signal that he’s obviously not getting. He looks so sad all of a sudden.
But Cas is there, knowing him, finally entering him, finally sliding in like he was born to be there.
“Awesome!” Charlie was practically vibrating with excitement. With his agreement, her whole demeanour had changed, like he’d passed some sort of unspoken test, but he could tell she had something more on her mind,  “When I heard they were hiring a progressive to help Dean, I was thrilled. The thing is, this place never hires outsiders when we have qualified people available, not for in-house roles anyway, let alone a Progressive! They must have realised that they needed someone with more experience, with something different to try. Everyone just adores Dean. He's funny and clever, and such a sweetheart! He’s nice to everyone, although he’s actually kinda shy, but he tried so hard to fit in. I feel so awful now that he's so sick. Everything they try is just making him sicker and sadder. Everyone's really scared for him. I just hope maybe you can help him, turn things around?”
This chapter has somewhat intense medical and caretaking aspects, as well as kink. A gently reminder that this world doesn't resemble our own in some key psychological, social and medical aspects.
“I hope so. Couldn’t check the flavour so I had to guess.” said Dean pulling the muffins out and setting them to cool on the rack.
“I’m sure it will. Thank you,” Castiel flips to the back of the file and peers at the date on the final sheet, “The final date listed here is just after Dean’s seventeenth birthday, are there any records from after that date?”
“That’s good.” Gabe encourages as he slips inside. It’s definitely not the first time Gabe had done this, he’d checked the dilators Dean wore and even slicked his fingers up and worked lubricant inside him. But this was the first time Dean truly let himself feel Gabe’s fingers, didn’t mentally take himself some place else for the short time it took for him to do it.
Dean whimpers a little, hands clenched tight to the outside of Castiel’s thighs, tight enough for bruises in the morning, a little unconscious revenge. But Cas doesn't rebuke him because Dean’s trying not to touch, to speed this up, taught that lesson through frustration and denial early on. Plus for Cas, a little pain of his own only feeds his desire.
Castiel reached behind his neck and picked up the end of the feeding tube, checking that it was clean and getting the port ready to connect it to the nighttime feeding machine.  He’d set it up earlier and readied the tube. All the was needed now was Dean to lay back and relax while he attached everything. It would take around five hours to complete the feeding.
“Pretty soon after that they came in with a lawyer and explained what a Guardianship Contract was and how important it was that I sign it. I didn’t want to, but Sam begged. He said that he didn’t want to lose his brother. That he didn’t think he was enough and that I needed more help than he could give. He was so desperate, but I just felt numb. Like nothing of myself mattered anymore, just Sam. I didn’t want to see Sam so scared ever again.”
Dean is panting, his chest rising and falling in the water but Cas waits him out, gentling him with reassurances, till his breathing returns to normal. Before starting up again, his own desire secondary to the need to care for the man in his arms.
I just remember waking up in the ambulance. The paramedic told me I was lucky I had been wearing a seatbelt or I would have been thrown from the car like my father. He told me that I was lucky to be alive.
“...my beautiful Omega. I knew you could do it. Look at you...” the stream of words Cas is speaking finally breaking through to his jumbled mind. His voice the anchor he needs not to fall apart, not entirely, but Cas notices anyway, he always does.
When both are fully seated, the first and then the second begin to move, in and out gently, at first just rocking in a smooth flow to help him get used to the feeling. Over the next six hours, the device will vary it's motions constantly, with phalluses of different sizes swapped out as well as sensations such a heat, cold, vibration and pulses will also be used in varying sequences. He can't imagine the oversensitivity Dean must be experiencing, with all of that machinery, moving into him, working on him, while he's forced to just endure it all. Although Cas and Dean had chosen each of the programs, discussing in advance the necessary size of each phallus, and the duration of each setting. The truth was the Dean would still struggle to cope, he'd swap between begging for more and for it to stop, he'll scream and cry and curse and moan. And until the program is completely finished, he'll be powerless to escape it. And even then, after the first program has run its course, he'll be given nutrition, sleep and then placed on another device and run through a different program.
“I was stupid. I should have said something,” his voice grew more determined with every word, “I want this ok. I want to trust you.”
‘Thank you,’ Cas mouthed, not wanting to shatter this moment. Even he looked better, more collected. He lay down on the camp bed by the wall, curled his body purposefully away from them and tried to go back to sleep.
“You should eat,” Gabe reminded Cas sternly, holding out the energy bar and making sure to catch his eye, “and drink too. Or I’ll be back with a tube for you too.”
“Dad and I flew down to talk to the judge in person. Since he was affiliated with Coille House, one of the Societies we’re loosely affiliated with, he was quite sympathetic to our concerns and supportive of our bid for custody of Dean. He couldn’t drop the charges, but he was able take his DDS and Pure designation into account.”
“I know it's hard sweetheart. But we’re going to practice because we can't let the past ruin this for you.”
“Cas.” he gasps out, desperately wanting the world to stop hurting so much all of a sudden. But he can’t breathe, can’t focus.
Is the story making sense so far? Anything you'd like explained? Anything you'd like read more about? Please do comment and let me know what you think!!
And finally, finally Dean is allowed up and back on the table. He doesn’t even complain about the stirrups once. Because soon enough it’s Cas’s fingers working him open, Cas taking away all the other doctors hands, replacing them with his own. And though it’s not arousing like it normally would be, not with Sam watching every small detail closely, it’s comforting, known.
“That was perfect sweetheart,” He said as he measured out a length of tape and fitted it carefully across Dean’s cheek.
“Bye,” Dean replied, still panting a bit from the kiss. God he wished he could get off! He wished Castiel would just reach down and touch him, ease him through another of those earth shattering orgasms it seemed only he could ring out of Dean’s body. But no, he was in the middle of some plan, something about training Dean’s body to accept denial or something. Dean didn’t care he just missed the tender rather than clinical touches.
But honestly, and he does need to be honest with himself, he’s learning that, he also wants to be denied, he wants Cas to use his body for pleasure without receiving any himself because that in some way will be true submission, let him give Cas everything for once, everything he has.
And though he didn’t picture the day including Sam walking beside the gurney, tear reddened eyes and hand clasping his tight and warm. Or the gentle, kind expression on the face of the man, forehead creased with worry as they loaded him into the ambulance for transport. He did expect the numbness to burn through him, apathy searing away the despair, shutting him down. Finally, he’d thought to himself, finally it’s happened, I can stop fighting now, I can give up.
It’ll be fine Gabe told himself, he could always call the OSP if he needed too. But that didn’t stop the gnawing worry settling deep in his chest.
He’s holding his breath he realises, lightheaded and gasping for air as the last of it passes in gentler movements now, Cas’s still working him through it, giving him every moment possible before it becomes too much, too sensitive.
Dean can’t reply, but Cas doesn’t seem to expect him to. Instead he says, “I’m going to hang up now because I need to drive, be strong, I’ll be there soon. And let Charlie take care of you…” and after a moment “I love you.” Then he’s gone, a lifeline cut much too far from shore.
“I was being unfair.” Sam continues, oblivious to Castiel’s frustrations, “I know it’s the illness and that he can’t help it. It’s just hard to not feel rejected.”
“Well, it should help. It shouldn’t hurt, if it even stings I want you to tell me. I’ll be utilising it more and more as we explore your denial and submission needs so I need to know that it’s working properly.” Dean grunts his agreement, looking forward to having Cas in his ass again, even if it’s just his fingers.
So they sat, for a comfortable hour going over the different design elements and construction strategies while the meal slowly made it’s way into Dean’s stomach. Castiel for his part had a turkey on rye sandwich with an apple juice, nothing fancy but enough to make Dean’s mouth water already, not even a full day into the process. Dean couldn’t help but feel a stab of jealousy but tamped it down quickly, he wants this he reminded himself, he needs to train himself to remember to eat and if a couple of weeks of denial is what it takes to incentivise him to remember then so be it.
“That’s good sweetheart, you took that so well.” Dean liked feeling clean, even if sometimes he had to grit his teeth to get there, and the praise for it didn’t hurt either.
“Shhh…” Cas comforted, “Keep your breathing steady, that’s it. Just ignore us. Focus on keeping yourself calm.”
to allow him the necessary access. Even though Cas went out and bought special padded ankle and foot rests, that he kisses the inside edge of Dean’s foot before he pulls the velcro tight, that he should be
He made a promise to himself and to Nick. He vowed to devote his life to helping others like Nick and to making sure that never happened again. A year later he began university. It took eight years, three degrees and four different cities, but he was finally officially registered as a Clinical-Dynamic Therapist, the only Pure Dominant to have ever done so.
“Thank you. Castiel is fine. It’s good to finally meet you in person,” Castiel took his hand and shook it firmly.
Cas drops the file he had been annotating and runs, crashing into the bedroom. Dean isn’t wake, he’s begging but he’s still asleep, somewhere else, somewhere monstrous.
“Yes, of course,” Sam honestly sounded relieved to be escaping the difficult conversation, “Right this way. I’ll call Charlie to show you the way, she’s been assigned to help you during your stay here;”
Sam arrives just after eleven. He’s smiling cheerfully but looks exhausted enough to collapse, a whole day’s work and a long drive will do that to you. Cas knows Sam hates flying but it cuts so terribly into the limited time Sam and Dean have together, it frustrates Cas a little.
“At first he tried to go on like he had before, but without Dad telling him what to do all the time. The cracks really started to show. And on top of that I took away his meds, flushed them. Stupid! I know that now. So fucking dumb. I could have killed him! He went into shock when he couldn’t get any more. I came home one night to find him seizing on the floor of our apartment. I called an ambulance, so fucking scared I was about to loose my brother.
“Sam rang last night, while you were asleep and I didn’t want to wake you, he asks if you could please ring him back,” Cas and Dean were sitting at the kitchen table, breakfast laid out in front of them, Dean tried desperately not to look at Cas’s eggs and toast.
Dean pulled on the sweatpants Castiel offered him, there was no point getting properly dressed, he’d just need to take it all off again in a little while. Might as well be comfortable, not gonna be dressed for very long anyway.
Gabe came at 11am as promised and Dean couldn’t help feeling his heart start to speed up. He could do this he told himself, it’s not like it’s the first time Gabe has examined him, hell, he does it almost every time he visited. It’s just for a little bit longer, he scolded himself.
As expected, Gabriel’s version of the story had spread like wildfire throughout all the Houses and soon everyone had learned the heartbreaking, but inspiring story of Pure Submissive Dean Winchester.
At first scent, Dean bucked angrily away from him, instinctively reaching up to pull the mask off, but Cas held his wrists, harshly yanking them back down to his lap. Fists turning white in the effort.
The first touch of fingers makes him jump a little, but he catches himself, easing his hips back down to the cushions.
Last night had been so nice that all he wants to do is ignore the new day. Friday nights were always indulgent; watching movies snuggled together on the sofa and long baths soaking in eachothers arms.  But Saturdays... Saturdays meant his weekly physical and any tests Cas might want to run, it meant new obedience and body movement exercises were taught. And though he groaned and moaned because right now all Dean wanted to do was sleep, he knew that once he was up, he would totally be into it. But, right now, now the blankets were soft and all he wanted to do was cuddle back together and ignore the day for a little bit longer.
Castiel made himself a simple meal of reheated stew and set Dean at the table with another glass of ice and a full bag flowing down steadily inside him. Once they were done, Dean made to head into the training room where they usually spent a couple of hours after dinner working on various physical movement and obedience exercises.
“Okay, tuck your arms around your chest, just like we practiced,” Dean obeyed, gritting his teeth but otherwise staying silent.
“Oh Dean,” Cas pulled Dean’s hand across the table and kissed the knuckles, “I know you struggle with this but I promise you, I’ll never let anyone hurt you ever again. If you can’t deal with Gabe touching you, we’ll work something else out. Maybe I should ask Benny to come back early?”
“Time to get out I guess. Your brother is coming tomorrow so we should get an early night,” Cas sounds a little sad to be ending the moment, but resigned.
Dean hangs his head, watching the soap run down the drain. He takes a breath, knowing he's got a long way still to go.
But no matter what the previous treatments had been, they obviously weren't working and Castiel would need to try something different, Dean would need everything Castiel had to give if he was going to survive this.
Sam scratched his eyebrow and looked a little overwhelmed at the question, “Uh… its really complicated. I don’t really know where to start.”
“Yeah, these helped a lot. Thanks,” Dean stretches slightly feeling the resisting leather against his chest holding him down to the bed.
“Then I want you to work on accepting his touch, trusting him to look after you. I don’t expect you to allow just anyone, in fact I would be angry if you did, but I need someone who can act on my behalf that we both trust. If Gabriel isn’t the right person for that job, we can try and find someone else.”
“No,” Sam confirmed, “They kept him at the hospital while they looked for next of kin. Dean told them he was an orphan. So, they got a judge’s permission to DNA test him and search the government databases. They got a hit immediately. Dad’s investigators had been monitoring the kinship databases for years. We got our lawyers out there the same day.”
“I’ve got a few follow up consultations and Dr. Meyers has asked me to assist him this afternoon. Apparently a young Omega patient of his is having trouble stabilising her heats and she doesn’t want to look for an Alpha till she is regular.” Dean nodded sympathetically. He’d gone through a similar thing a couple of years ago and could appreciate just how draining it could be on the body and the mind never knowing just when a heat would hit. His were still awful, but at least he knew when they were coming.
Then he checked over the room, setting the air conditioner to cool it slightly and flicked off the lights everywhere except over the bed. Dean didn’t need the reminder of the rest of the room until he was too far gone to care.
“Tomorrow will be fine. Just meeting with Benny and Dean will give me plenty to do for the rest of today.”
He shifted from foot to foot, nervous need pouring off him in waves, he wasn’t too far gone yet but it was building. He looked terrified and desperate all at once.
“Oh man! I’m so glad to see you and you look so good! I honestly didn’t think I’d ever see you again.”
But Cas is being kind tonight, wanting to release the tension for Dean not build it up. So he reached up behind his head and pulls up the key fastened to a chain around his neck.
“Shit, ok. Sit down.” She helps him move backwards, towards a bench on the side of the path and sits him down. Crouching in front of him, but not touching him.
“Okay.” Cas shuffles the papers slightly, taking a breath, to ask the first question, “We know you first started exhibiting signs of increased stress about February of 2013. It says you had to leave a class due to a panic attack on the 14th but was able to convince your OSP welfare officer that you were fine. I assume this the approximate time that John returned?”
“How was Sam?” Castiel enquired, sipping contentedly on a cup of coffee, Dean wanted nothing more than to yank it out of his stupid hands and gulp it down in one hit. Instead he shoved his hands in his pockets, slumping back down in his seat at the table.
At least he tried to wait but the liquid started to flow the minute Cas grasped his cock. Dean groaned in annoyance but didn’t attempt to stop the flow, obviously overwhelmed by the urgency. It was a lot Castiel could see, it must have been rather uncomfortable to hold so long.
“Gonna finish off this section,” Dean gestured to the roughly six foot pile of twisted metal, “and then see if we can get to the next section in the afternoon.”
“Yeah, they sent someone who knew all about us and interviewed me and Dean separately. I thought they were going to take him away.”
He fell of the radar for a couple of years after that. He was working as a mechanic, and he seemed to pull himself together. He even paid taxes and bought himself a car, a gorgeous 1967 Chevy Impala. We managed to find it and buy it back for him. It’s stored here in the garages for when he’s healthy enough to work on it again.
Suddenly he was pissed, anger and resentment surging up and raging out his mouth. He screamed, angry and defiantly, struggling hard against the bench, the harness, even Cas's gentle hands. He screamed and screamed, right in Castiel's fucking face, furious and desperate. He wanted that thing out of him, Right Now!
Before Dean dressed, Castiel reattached the various biometric and monitoring devices he uses on him. Technology has come a long way in the last few years and Dean’s almost obsessive need to find the least intrusive and easily managed models means that they’re all wireless and can be accessed instantly from Castiel’s phone or computer at work. He slipped his hand between Dean’s legs feeling his passages for lubrication, not enough he decided and retrieved his spare bottle from the draw by the bed.
Earlier that morning, as part of their usual Heat preparations Cas had inserted an IV catheter in Dean's arm but hadn’t yet hooked him up to anything. In the past, they had discussed the possibility of fitting Dean with something more permanent but felt it was premature at this point.
“You’ll stay with me?” Dean replies instead, calmed enough by the process to find his voice again finally.
“Ok,” Cas sighs, “Ok. Gabe, you can give us a little space now. I'll need you in a couple of hours so stay close. The cctv is on and I have this,” He holds up his wrist to show the wireless alert bracelet, “I'll press when I need you.”
Then he met Nick, a Pure Submissive, and the only other Pure designated patient Castiel had ever met. He was clever, funny, and incredibly kind. He liked terrible 80s hair metal bands and go-kart racing.
“At first, he seemed ok with it. I think he figured that coming here would be better than going back to prison. And he just kinda played along, telling us what we wanted to hear, showing us what we wanted to see. He was even starting to learn a few of the basic Protocols and taking part in social events. He was able to put up such an incredibly charming and charismatic façade that we didn’t realise that he was suffering. For a while he had everyone fooled.”
Short angsty chapter before we drive headfirst into backstory (this chapter makes references to previous traumatic experiences, possibly triggery!)
For most submissives, going down is instinctive, like breathing. They constantly want it, crave it, because for them it’s an escape and a release. It feels so good and right that they genuinely don’t realise that unconsciously or not, they’re making the choice to drop every single time they go down, that their Dominant is just the guide. Submissives who were raised accepting their headspaces can’t understand why anyone would fear and reject it. For most, it does genuinely feel like their Dominants are fully in control and they’ll thank their Dominants for ‘forcing’ or ‘taking’ them down.
Dad was angry at first, but it was a token gesture, probably happy to be free of the ‘burden’. He eventually just drunk himself into oblivion like usual, didn’t even see us off at the busstop.”
Gabe nods and writes some notes in his tablet, "Sixteen seconds duration, not too bad. Ideally he should be able to achieve 25 to 30."
He sleeps. For hours he sleeps, peacefully, bonelessly. Better than Cas could have hoped, till daylight sneaks across the floor, intrusive and unwanted.
“Please!” Dean begs, suddenly needy, the headrush of touch making him a little delirious, the desire hitting him harder than he ever expected.
Dean didn’t wait for Castiel’s assistance, instead barreling into the bathroom, obviously desperate for the release.
Gabe knows how hard it is to control Dean alone during his heat, later on they'll strap him down, but right now he has too much fight in him, too much desperation, he needs to get it out, to move. If he's immobilized now, he'll hurt himself fighting it. But, this small amount of privacy to feel a little normal, like Dean's heat isn't going to be the trial they all know it will, Gabe desperately wants to give both of them that.
“Damn! No. He can’t talk about this shit,” Sam’s voice growing angry, “Would probably tell you it was all his own fault anyway.” Cas can hear him sitting down in the background, obviously settling in for a long conversation. He sounds strained, upset but keeping it together.
“Jess says goodbye. She's off to catch up with a few friends till later tonight, told me I needed a bit of brother time,” he laughs, delighted and casual, Dean wishes he felt the same ease. But he nods, thankful for her thoughtfulness. Time alone with Sam was always a rare luxury.
Cas shifts him so that Dean’s back is completely resting against his chest and his head heavy against his shoulder. He can tell that Dean wants to move, to thrust but he’s being so good, letting Cas maneuver him, letting his Alpha take control.
“Yeah, I know he's high risk for OSS Syndrome, but he's still lucid, just panicking. Okay, yeah, I've got it right here,” She pulls out the med kit he carries and opens it up.
When Nick entered the facility, at first, everything seemed to be going fine. He smiled and joked with his therapists and other patients, he even joined in the baseball games they often played in the afternoons. Castiel was stoked, begging his therapists to allow him to scene with Nick, sure that he could help drop him like none of them could. He was Pure too, he argued, why not let him assist at least? But they always refused him.
“That’s completely understandable,” Castiel offered gently, “He’s only been living here for a little over a year? Can I ask where he lived previously?”
“What other compression techniques beyond the CRP frame do you use? Compression clothing for example?”
She laughed quick and easily, which was nice. When Castiel had first arrived in Dean’s life she had been the first to condemn him, insisting that the university take back its threats to fire Dean unless he got help. They hadn’t backed down, Cas had stuck around and eventually she had grown to respect Castiel for his commitment to helping Dean, even if she didn't always understand his methods.
Gabe gently toggled the device and lay the extra tubing against Dean’s shoulder so as not to pull at the tubing taped to his cheek.
“Okay, take a sip of water now,” he said releasing Dean’s neck and lifting the cup up to his lips, the water helped the tube slide down into the right position, with only a small amount more gagging as it went. He reached across and checked the length inserted.
Though Cas was careful to keep his distaste of that particular way thinking off his expression, Benny must have caught on anyway, because he quietly added, “Can’t say I agree with it. Coming in here and chatting with the clinic staff and patients in the waiting room was one of the only ways Dean still got to socialise. He was even helping out a bit, tidying up, fetching equipment, stuff like that, and people liked seeing him around. Lots of people miss him now that he’s confined to his rooms.” Benny sighed, before looking up and levelling his gaze directly at Castiel, “At this point, Dr Novak, I’d agree to try anything with even half a chance of keeping that boy alive. I can’t say I think we’ve done much of anything right.”
He’d wanted that for Sam as long as he could remember, feared neither of them would ever find it. He’d always hoped to see him with kids underfoot, a good job and a lovely woman like Jess. He couldn’t help the choked gasp and tremor that started in his hands, he opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. His emotions running too high.
“Yeah, got tanked each night and slept through the day while I worked… He’d wake as I got home and crack open new bottle. Make me share it with him as he...he talked, told me how worthless I was, how useless life was anymore.” Then his voice changes, turning to Cas to explain, the guilt evident, “I swear I didn’t want to drink, I know I’m not allowed to without supervision,” Cas nods, an old rule between them, borne from experience “and the meds they had me on then anyway, it made me just feel sick, want to vomit.”
Sam is quiet for a long time, mulling over what to say, his loyalty to Dean’s private nature battling with his need to help his brother.
Cas could imagine it, Dean finally, finally getting the help he needed. He’d grumble and put up a token resistance but the beautiful man who just wanted to please could finally come out, find release. Cas was sad he had missed that time, a time of awakening, of growth into the amazing man Cas knew. Of course, it had all come crumbling down once again. But for a moment there, there was hope and a chance he had never had.
Dean laughed, he probably looked like a sweaty mess, but he appreciated the pun even if he pretended to miss it, “Shut it Gabe. You try drilling through 70 pieces of sheet metal and see how you feel afterwards”
Sometimes he leaves Dean like that for a while, up on the table while he gets ready for whatever he’s planning to do. Pulling instruments out of the sterilizer and fussing with the temperature of the room. Sometimes he’ll just strap Dean in and sit with him a while, talking to him about nothing important, holding his hand and waiting him out, letting him decide when he’s ready. Sometimes it’s longer, sometimes it’s less but it’s always like he’s waiting for some invisible signal, some sign, letting Dean work through it while the minutes tick by unhurriedly.
But he understood why, that even though there were lots of things that he hated that Cas did anyway, it was only because he had to. Because Castiel knew that without it, there was no way he could get through his heats without damaging himself.
“Yeah, yeah. I remember,” Dean dismissed the concern lightly, crunching down on an ice cube just to spite him. Cas choose to deliberately ignore it.
Sam’s heart leaps, and he grins at her. “I was going to tell you that you don’t have to say it back.”
Sam takes a deep breath. “I guess so,” he says, then releases a sigh. “We’ll have another look around here for summoning spells, see if there’s anything we missed. If not… we’ll start looking for him.” He shrugs. “If Jack’s wings heal up okay, we should be able to cover decent ground. Between that and praying, maybe we can reach him.”
Dean gets to the cabin around nine. He sends Jody a text to let her know he’s arrived safely, then turns off his phone and slips it into his coat pocket. He takes all the groceries inside in one trip and puts everything away.
Nikita and Steven hurry off down the forest path to the clearing so they’ll be ready with their cameras. The group follows Jack at a leisurely pace, and he frequently looks back over his shoulder, smiling.
Castiel’s breath hitches. He’s no stranger to standing before a crowd, having commanded hundreds of Heaven’s angels, but this particular experience is a new one for him. He looks over at Dean and sees him swallow hard. Their eyes meet, and they smile.
He divides his attention between his footing and the approaching horde, becoming gradually more unnerved with every upward glance. They’re relentless: a dark, unstoppable tide moving far more swiftly than he would have guessed possible.
Next, Gabriel explains how and when to utilize the centerboard—the retractable keel in the hull. He teaches Dean how to hold and maneuver both the tiller—which controls the rudder—and the mainsheet—the rope that controls the sail—and how to position his arms to avoid fatigue. Dean won’t ever simply be able to sit back and let the boat carry him; he’ll need to be in control at all times, making adjustments to the tiller and sail as needed. It’s a lot more like driving a car than Dean would have guessed.
Cas fights back the urge to wake Dean up and check him over, check for damage he knew wasn’t there to be seen. He also knew of the test results, the originals were right there in his file. But he can’t get the image out of his head of teenage Dean panicking and frightened over something he has no control over. Fearful and ashamed when he should have been reassured, protected.
He wondered how Dean felt about using the frame. Many patients needed several unrestrained sessions to acclimatise to the feeling of being restrained in such a complete fashion, after which they often found it soothing and reassuring. It was medically proven to lower anxiety, induce a sense of calm and improve sleep. But unless the frame was introduced properly, used judiciously and only with the full consent of the submissive, it could have the opposite effect, especially when the submissive perceived it to have a disciplinary purpose. He hoped that wasn’t the case with Dean but judging by the need for sedating medication following its use, he very much suspected that it was seen as exactly that, a punishment.
Dean is familiar enough with it now to know that doesn’t help much but it’s all Cas can offer. He balls up his courage and remind himself that he wants this, damn it, stop being such as pussy!
He remembers seeing Castiel just once before they’d been contracted, but that was enough, enough to light the flicker, kindle sometime waiting deep. Though he can’t explain it, something in that nothing and otherwise insignificant moment changed everything.
Cas drags the chair over to the table and digs out the full set of restraints. He doesn’t give Dean a choice about using it but he does ask “How many do you want?” Gesturing to the small pile of leather sitting on the table.
Benny gestured to the doors that opened off up the central space they were currently standing in, “That’s the bathroom, the gym, treatment rooms 1 and 2, the cinema, the library.” He pointed to each door as he went around, “and finally the bedroom.”
“Even in our community, it’s really rare, only eight in every thousand. So, finding out that he was Pure, it felt like a fate. Also, he’s completely charming when he wants to be. Everyone adores him. For the three months he was healthy enough to publicly enter the community, he managed to win over half the residents here. I just wish he’d had more time to get to know us before it all went to hell. Now he’s just so sick… and angry, he’s just always so angry….” Sam peters off, obviously lost in thought and regret.
Castiel appears puzzled. “Souls are for humans.” But even as he says this, he seems to realize what Dean is getting at. “You want me to have one, to ensure we won’t be parted?”
Breathing hard, Castiel holds Dean in his gaze; there’s a beautiful wildness in his eyes. Castiel’s feathers twitch and quiver, smoothing into place, and then his wings fold and fade from sight.
He asks for Sam and Dean’s help for “a mission,” and takes them to a strange camp in the woods near Sioux Falls, where a young woman who looks exactly like Kaia Nieves is waiting for them.
Throughout the night, as Castiel chats with their guests, he catches glimpses of Dean, and their eyes often meet, as if Dean is constantly searching him out, too. It becomes a subtle, flirtatious game between them, one with an intense undercurrent. At some point Dean sheds his jacket and bow tie, and the sight of him in his vest, with the top two buttons of his dress shirt undone, is making it difficult for Castiel to focus on the conversations he’s a part of. Castiel suspects Dean is aware of this, and it’s confirmed when Dean gives him a knowing grin.
“We’ll see you there,” Dean says. They get into the car, Dean puts on a pair of sunglasses and shoots Castiel a grin, and then they’re off.
Jack explains to Sam and Dean that Kaia is alive and they must rescue her, and this woman needs to get back to her own world. Without any visible effort, Jack opens a rift to the other world, and then one by one they all pass through it.
As Dean gets a feel for the boat in the water and the wind in the sail, things quickly come together. The first time Gabriel directs him to tack, he ducks under the swinging boom, moves to the other side of the boat, and swaps the controls over to his other hand, all in one seamless motion.
Dean glances at Jack. They still don’t know how he’d survived detonating in the Empty—or how his grace and soul had remained intact. He still has his wings, but they’d been damaged by the detonation, and his powers are gone. The kid looks like a kicked dog. He’s wearing the same frown as Sam, only sadder somehow, the corners of his mouth turned down.
,” Gabriel says, rolling his eyes as he rests his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath. He glances up at them. “Whatever door you opened wasn’t open for long.”
After they’ve eaten, Sam takes their bowls and utensils to the river to rinse them out, and when he returns, Jack has the laptop balanced on one knee. He’s got his headphones on, and he wears a focused expression with a hint of sorrow in it.
They let go after a long moment, and when they do, Dean is smiling again. Castiel catches sight of his boutonniere of white waxflower paired with long, thin green leaves. Dean glances down at it.
Dean stares into the fire. He’s gotta move out. He’s gotta find somewhere new, somewhere there aren’t happy memories ruined by bad ones—or just plain sad ones.
Hunters are sent out in pairs or parties to take care of cases, and hunters from farther afield visit for information or a night’s rest and a hot meal before hitting the road again.
As she works to pin the boutonniere onto his lapel, she says, “I was talking to Rowena a while back, and she said that although the Victorians were a little uptight for her, she appreciated their love of the language of flowers. I poked around on the internet, and apparently the waxflower symbolizes love that endures time and trials. And forget-me-nots represent fidelity, long-lasting connection, and remembrance.”
Castiel shifts to face Jack directly. “I know you said you’d like to help Amara with everything she has planned, and it’s entirely your choice, but she and I want you to know that you can live your life however you choose.
He pushes aside apprehension and redirects the boat, nudging it close enough for him to see that it’s some
Dean lets the mainsheet out so the sail flaps, slowing him down, then pulls up the centerboard and raises the rudder so they won’t be damaged when he lands.
“Hey, listen,” Dean says. “I know you’ve been having a tough time since you lost your powers, but you didn’t need ’em for that idea you had earlier, right?” Dean cranes his head a little so Jack will meet his eyes, and when he does, he says, “We need you, Jack—powers or no powers. Sam’s gonna need you. You two gotta watch out for each other.”
Sam takes a few steps into the room and looks around slowly, awestruck. It takes him a moment to notice that Jack is overwhelmed, too; he’s standing motionlessly near the staircase.
“No,” Castiel says, shaking his head, and relief washes over Dean. “I heard you just before I woke up, but… that was all.” He peers at Dean, curiosity written on his face.
It’s probably freezing, but he has no idea what’s ahead, and he’s been through the wringer so he might as well take advantage.
She squeezes his hand and smiles a little sadly. “But I never wanted this life for you boys. I hope that maybe, now that things are more stable, and you’ve got a network of support… that you might consider…” She trails off and gestures vaguely with one hand. “Something more for yourself. I know you’re an adult, and I respect whatever decisions you make about how you live your life, but I wanted to tell you that.”
“I saw your wings,” Dean says suddenly. “In the Empty—after you took your memories back. And during the fight with Chuck. I saw everyone’s wings.” He frowns and adds, “I don’t think Sam could, though.”
“Oh, I’m sure you did,” Crowley says lightly, reaching into his breast pocket. He removes a flask and begins unscrewing the top. “Nevertheless, I’ve dealt with four major jailbreak attempts in the last week. They’ve been desperate, but no one’s getting out of Hell unless I say so.” He takes a sip from the flask. “And I say no.” He smiles. “Still, better safe than sorry, and all that.”
The climb out of the ravine took something from Dean, and the fragment of memory from Hell stole the rest.
They open the door to the library, and Dean follows Sam and Jack inside. Where yesterday they crept in, uncertain, today they stride with purpose.
“Sam!” Dean yanks on Sam’s sleeve and they race into the fray. Into an epicenter rippling with power, where something baleful is seeping through the air, where the forces at play have some primal part of his brain screaming at him to flee.
“Yeah, I kinda figured. But Death didn’t say we needed Michael, specifically. He just said we needed ‘an archangel.’ Maybe you’ll get your powers back once we get out of here.”
Overhead, feathery clouds swirl through a crimson sunset, and Castiel smiles sadly. “Then you know that I broke.”
“You fucking lied to me.” The words burst from Dean, startling him. He hasn’t said a word for days. Or maybe it’s been a week… or weeks? He really has no idea, and there’s no way to know for sure.
People are beginning to look around toward the DJ booth, wondering what’s going on. Dean finally tunes into the looping music, and Castiel enjoys the transition from ‘puzzled’ to ‘outraged.’
, or something. I didn’t tell him I was proposing; I thought you could be the one to tell him, when he gets back.”
Dean jumps into the boat and settles himself on the floorboards, then turns the boat, pulls in the sail slightly, and he’s off.
Dean sucks in a hurt little breath, fighting the urge to sit down on the sand and put his head in his hands. He stares down the length of the hazy beach, swaying slightly in his weariness.
“And you need to get across the sea, because that’s where Jack’s grace wants you to go. But you don’t know how to sail.”
“Dean Winchester’s finally ready to settle down.” Sam grins and begins writing. “So you need… a date.”
Castiel gives him an exasperated look, then relents as a violent shudder passes through Dean. “Yes, I’ll stay.”
“You ready?” Dean murmurs, eyebrows raised. Castiel gives a tight nod, and Dean says soothingly, “It’s just you and me right now, in the living room.”
The ceremony isn’t until five, so after they’ve eaten, they stick around to kill time over coffee. Dean holds Castiel’s hand under the table, thumb stroking back and forth, as if to tell Castiel that his mind is only half-focused on the chatter.
“Go get some rest,” Sam says, clapping Charlie gently on the shoulder. “We’ll figure out the details later.”
Dean sees he’s veered too close to one of the crags that tower over the tundra, so he redirects himself toward the center of the plain. He takes a dozen steps before he realizes he’d been following the pull.
Castiel glances over at Dean. “I’d like to lend a hand, yes. There’s a lot we need to do, and countless souls and beings who need our help.”
On the drive to Sam and Eileen’s that morning—with a stop at Mary’s planned for afterward—Dean had suddenly said, “Dude… Fuck.”
living room—and talk about potential cases, or nothing at all. Sometimes they go for late-afternoon drives on the country roads, the windows rolled down and the radio turned up. Sometimes Dean cooks certain dinners just because he wants Cas to try them.
“Thank you for welcoming me into your family,” Castiel says. “Jack, too.” Mary follows his gaze to where Jack is keeping Gertie and the twins entertained with shadow puppets while chatting with Garth and Bess. She smiles.
“No,” Dean says firmly, shaking his head. “None of it was okay. You deserved better from me, because you’re a good person, Jack, and you always have been.”
She pauses invitingly, and Death says, “I am not a being, as such. I am the manifestation of a natural force.”
Afterward, it’s time for dessert. One of the buffet lines is laden with pies of every conceivable kind, and Dean has Steven take a picture of it.
Castiel presses a hand to Dean’s lower back, holding their bodies flush; his other hand slides over Dean’s chest to rest against his neck, thumb brushing his jawline. Castiel’s head tilts to just the right angle to deepen their kisses, and with every momentary parting his breaths become more ragged.
“Alright, I will. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ll call if anything weird happens. But I don’t think it will.”
“There was a larger force at work, as well,” she says. “Some effort on the part of creation itself to attempt to right the wrong that had been done so long ago. Which is, I think, how the Empty came to be the final resting place of angels. Why you,” she says to Death, “felt you ought to step aside and allow things to unfold the way that they did, which set me free.” She turns to Jack. “And how you survived your detonation in the Empty with both your grace and soul.”
Even before the kiss, though, things had changed the moment Castiel had allowed—invited—Dean to touch his wings.
He puts himself between Sam and the fire, and with a hand fisted in Sam’s jacket, Dean guides his path so he doesn’t touch anyone’s wings. They lean into the wind, holding onto each other as they make their way to Castiel.
Charlie gets her hands on a computer and requests that she be left alone, because she has work to do.
Gradually, Castiel hears steps approaching across the grass. He closes his eyes and breathes deeply, and the footsteps stop a few feet from him.
—striding into a barn, sparks flying, the shadow of wings on the walls, turning everything Dean thought he knew on its head.
Dean makes a face as if the answer should be obvious. He fishes around in his pocket, then pulls out Baby’s keys.
She continues, “By the time his Apocalypse storyline had started to play out, Chuck was aware of an inconvenient fact: the Empty had become the final resting place of angels and demons.” She smiles wryly. “He’d never intended for that to happen.”
When he returns, Castiel is awake and pulling his shirt on. Dean glimpses the tattoo on his torso before averting his eyes.
He finishes with the frog and judges his efforts to be decent: the blade slips into it easily and he can draw it quickly, and it feels secure and doesn’t get in his way.
Dean’s mouth drops open. He looks at Castiel with new eyes, and he’s got a terrible feeling, like a knife slipping between his ribs…
Dean leans against the Impala, staring up at the stars, at the moon. There they are, hanging in the sky like a miracle, the moon nearly full and impossibly bright. “Look at that,” he murmurs.
Finally, Dean takes off his shoes and collapses onto the bed with a sigh. He looks over at Castiel and swats at his protruding elbow. “Get this outta here,” he grumbles.
The air conditioning shuts off, and Dean stares at the ceiling for a long time, listening to Castiel’s deep, even breathing. He doesn’t feel tired.
Jody makes a rueful face as she pours him a glass of water. “You just missed her. She’s working a twelve-hour shift today so she won’t get home till three-something in the morning, probably.” She passes Dean the water and he drinks it gratefully.
“I hate you for making that deal, and for sacrificing yourself.” Tears are streaming down his cheeks, and flames are climbing inside his rib cage. “I hate you for telling me you love me when you knew it meant you’d be taken away.”
“I flew. I needed these,” Castiel says, lifting the papers. “And I thought you might like this.” He passes the beer to Dean, who takes a long, grateful drink.
Dean stands wearily, a small sigh escaping him, and he tosses a crumpled bill on the table next to the coffee, cold and untouched.
“Why? He’s already got you for a father. Can’t think of a better angel for the job than you,” Gabriel says, and for once his tone is serious.
Despite Castiel’s best efforts, Dean had remembered enough of Hell that he was never going to be the same person afterward. Some scars run too deep for even an angel to heal.
Castiel points up at the stars. “Libra,” he says. The constellation is low in the sky but still clearly visible.
Crowley adjusts his suit with huffy indignance, then gestures around them. “They’re guarding the perimeter of your little celebration, here. I know you’ve got an archangel and a nephilim up your sleeve, and you’re certainly not one to be trifled with, either, but come on.” He spreads his hands. “Castiel and Dean Winchester? Wedding of the century, for those in the know, and you can be sure that includes an awful lot of baddies.”
Energy renewed, they flip through their guidebook and make a series of flights in rapid succession: Saint Basil’s Cathedral in Russia, Hagia Sophia in Turkey, Cologne Cathedral in Germany, the Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia, Las Lajas Shrine in Colombia.
“I know,” Castiel says. He stops pacing, but he’s looking anywhere but at Dean. “I know you didn’t. It’s not like ‘that,’ not exactly. And you didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just…” He puts a hand on the mantel and leans against it, continuing to avoid Dean’s eyes.
Jack leads them through the halls, and for a moment Dean thinks he’s taking them to the dungeon. He balks until Jack strides past the door and goes into one of the other archive rooms clustered nearby.
Dean tilts his head, considering it. “Actually,” he says, “I was kinda thinking… You wanna hang out in bed, listen to the rain with me?”
Castiel nods. “Better.” Before he takes his first bite he says, “I appreciate you doing all of this. You didn’t have to.”
In the kitchen, Castiel pulls Dean’s favorite mug from the cupboard, the one he’d stolen from the bunker, and the sound of singing in the shower reaches him faintly as he waits for the coffee.
There is a brief silence as they consider the idea, and then Mary says, “Right before you were born, Jack… Crowley said that if we helped him cage Lucifer, he would close up Hell for good. Do you remember that?” Mary looks between Sam and Dean.
“Yes, we have quite the mess on our hands, haven’t we?” Death sits back in his chair. “Chuck has destroyed the other worlds, absorbed Amara and her power, and eliminated most of the earth’s living beings.” He looks at Sam and then Dean, unblinking. “I imagine it’s nice to have a day off from being the world’s primary source of chaos.”
For Dean, these are sounds that would never warrant his attention on Earth: his pulse—a constant beat in his ears, astonishingly loud in the stifling silence—his breathing, his muted footsteps upon the featureless floor, and the rustling of his clothes.
“The craftsmanship on both of these is excellent,” Castiel says, bringing the box closer to squint at the rings.
Castiel smiles at Dean’s amusement. “I’m sure he never would have,” he says. “Eileen didn’t seem too bothered, though. She said she hoped Gabriel ‘enjoyed the view.’”
“Hey!” Dean bellows, breaking away from the other hunters. He spots the girls, who are howling with laughter. “You’re not playing this at my wedding! Uh-uh!”
He remembers pointing his gun at Sam’s chest and screaming at him to move, and then pulling back the hammer, thinking he might actually pull the trigger next. On his brother.
“Well,” Dean says, “they’re not gettin’ out. Not if I can help it.” He looks over at Gadreel. “I might be able to get you out, though.”
Castiel stands at the edge of the yard with his back to the house, gazing out over the field that adjoins their property. The long grass waves in the wind and the breeze plays with his hair.
Amara nods, then takes a breath and continues the story. “When Castiel and I returned, Chuck attacked.”
Gadreel says, “They believe they will find Castiel, and a way out of the Empty, through your efforts.”
Castiel looks back at Jack. “We thought we’d like to get married this summer,” he says, “but a lot of venues and photographers are already booked for summer weddings that were sensibly planned a lot earlier than ours.” He gestures at the multitude of tabs open on his computer.
Castiel thinks about it for a moment, still looking up at the stars. “When the Entity took me away, that was the first time I’d come into contact with its true form, if you can call it that. And it felt… familiar to me, in a way.
Always, Gabriel makes Dean repeat things back to him, until they get to the point where Gabriel listens as Dean describes and demonstrates each concept himself.
When he finally speaks, his voice is soft. “I’ve been in this vessel for so long that in a way, it feels like my body. But my wings are still a part of me. They’re a part of my true form, and to know that you can see them, or touch them, when normally you can’t… it’s…” He takes a deep breath and says, “It’s
Dean has embraced his anger, self-immolating over and over again. But there is one thing he hasn’t fed the ravaging fire.
“Hey, no, that’s okay. My birthday’s in January, so let’s say you’re early. I’m sorry I don’t have anything for you,” Dean says, suddenly embarrassed.
“There’s… there’s something going on, here.” Dean is cradling the phone between his shoulder and ear now, digging through his duffel for his gun. “I lost some time. And the fire’s weird.”
An awful certainty floods Dean: this fight is taking everything the angels have. He has no idea what to do, but they have to do something. He tugs at Sam. “Come on!”
He kept the Leviathans away from Dean in Purgatory. Helped Sam cure him when he was a demon, and refused to give up on him when he was changing because of the Mark. In that tunnel in Apocalypse World he’d stopped Dean from seeing what the vampires had done to Sam, and kept him from winding up just as dead. And Cas had been there with Sam, to break Dean out of the prison Michael had locked him away in, in his own mind.
He pulls Castiel to him, runs one hand through Cas’ hair, the other through whatever feathers he can reach, and kisses him deeply.
Dean realizes this must be why he hasn’t experienced any hassle since he got here, despite so many hostile residents being awake.
A wave washes over them and Dean wrenches himself from Alastair’s grasp, diving for the blade. Alastair grabs his ankle, but Dean gets his hand around the hilt and rolls onto his back as Alastair lunges for him.
“You’re a danger to this world,” she says. “To everything in existence. I can’t let you hurt anyone again.” She extends a hand toward his chest, and at first Dean thinks she’s going to kill him, but when light begins to flow from Chuck and into her outstretched palm, he realizes that she’s taking his power.
“He’s not a normal kid.” The reply is automatic, but Dean speaks in a neutral tone, rather than the obstinate one he used to use, back when he hadn’t trusted Jack.
Castiel strokes a hand over Dean’s hair as he watches the candlelight dancing on the ceiling, the flame teased by the cool spring air drifting into the room. The rain pours noisily from the gutter and in the background, the night is filled with an unceasing patter upon the leaves and the grass.
And everyone makes it through before it closes: Mary and all of the Apocalypse World refugees, Jack and Castiel, and even Crowley, who’d been resurrected by Michael in an attempt to gain access to their world. Sam and Dean and Gabriel are the last ones through, and the portal fades with an unceremonious crackling sound, leaving Michael and Lucifer behind.
Sam nods, and it takes him a moment to speak because he’s fighting a swell of emotion. “I hear you,” he says. “And to be honest, I’ve been thinking the same thing, kind of.”
Castiel breaks their fall, his arms opening as he hits the ground with a grunt. Dean rolls away and finally comes to a stop sprawled on his back.
In the midst of planning, life goes on. Dean and Eileen accompany a group of hunters to Montana to take care of a nest of vampires, and they successfully cure their two most recent victims. In Colorado, Mary and Jack are able to bring another new hunter into the network after assisting with sending a ghost to its final rest. When a trove of lore and artifacts is discovered in Texas, Castiel and Sam arrange its transportation to the bunker and as soon as it arrives they begin the task of cataloguing it.
Dean makes a choked sound. He swallows his mouthful of food and then he’s laughing. “Sam didn’t mention that.”
Alastair holds Dean’s face underwater and Dean flails, manages to gouge at Alastair’s eye. The pressure lets up and he explodes out of the water, going for the blade, but Alastair seizes the collar of his jacket and hauls him backward. Dean strikes out with an elbow, then whirls and plants his boot squarely in a kneecap, and as Alastair goes down he pulls Dean with him.
Sam's eyes went wide for a moment, but then his face split into a grin. Cas leaned over slightly to make himself visible to Sam, "Hello Sam," he rumbled, and Dean couldn't help but smile.
His steps faltered a little. So the guy was going around making friends already? Why couldn't he just be the quiet, keep to yourself type? They didn't need another friendly face to hurt them all down the road. He just needed someone that could do his work and go home.
"He, uh, runs to work on Fridays" came Gabriel's voice, his smirking face poking out from between other amused employees.
His mind continued to over think the rest of the way home, and for the remaining time he sat staring at nothing in particular as he waited for Charlie. She let herself in, immediately going to the fridge and grabbing a couple beers. This conversation would need it.
Cas looks at Balthazar for more, but the man is paying very close attention to the way his straw moves through his cocktail. Turning back to Aaron, Cas says "What do you mean guy? I thought it was just some young interns or something?"
"Alright, alright. He's a good looking dude, I can't deny that. But I'm not getting into that crap again, you know that. I just can't. Besides, I don't even know him." He wouldn't meet her eyes as he reached for the last bit of fries. She knew him too well, but she would never tell him how to live unless he was being an idiot. In this case they both knew he couldn't take any chances, not again.
Dean reached out and pulled Cas quickly into him, pressing their lips together hard for just a moment. "I guess I should have come up with a Plan C, huh?" He mused. Pausing for a moment to think, he placed a quick peck on Cas's cheek. "Let's get us dry, alright?"
"Well, my god, now that you've had it, you need to play hard to get." Cas stared at him, unsure how Balthazar formed these plans in his head. With a roll of his eyes, he continued, "Look, now he's going to be 'asking for a refill' whenever he pleases! You need to exert some control of your own." He stopped, sipping thoughtfully at his drink while Cas waited for his plan to unfold.
When he came back, sliding a mug of lighter coffee in front of Cas, the other man still wouldn't look up at him. Dean hesitated, unsure where to began, when Cas suddenly cut him off.
“Wha- Cas?” Sam says, taking a slow step forward and reaching out to grasp Cas’s hand. He hauls them to their feet, Dean still clutching tightly to Cas and Cas’s free arm firm around Dean’s waist as he turns to repeat to Sam the same few words he had given Dean.
Letting go of Dean's wrists, Cas positioned himself between Dean's legs, holding one of his knees up to his chest. He kept his gaze on Dean's face, who was watching impatiently, lips parted slightly, cheeks flushed. As Cas pushed forward, he watched the green of Dean's eyes disappear behind his eyelids, a deep moan escaping his lips as his head fell back against the bed, waiting for Cas to bottom out. Once he was settled, Cas wrapped his hand around Dean, stroking him slowly while he matched the pace with thrusts.
Dean had proposed having lunch with Cas as a way to kind of face his fears and get to know the guy. It was the least he could do after he'd so easily slid into life here at Winchester Roasters, even after Dean had treated him like crap. He had invited Charlie to alleviate some of the conversation so Dean didn't have to do all the talking. He was usually pretty good with conversation, making small talk, being his usual charming self. But there was something about the way Cas's gaze held such intensity, it made his face warm and his mind go blank. One on one at some tiny booth? There was no way that could be avoided.
"Sounds good" Cas replied, standing to take his leave. As he reached the door, Dean called to him again.
Monday had, as usual, made an unwelcome appearance far too quickly. The weekend had been full of rain and not much else, and the easy laziness had followed Dean into the start of the work week. He had come into his office to find a piping hot cup of dark roast alongside his stack of morning paperwork, but when he had poked his head out the door to thank Cas, he hadn't been at his desk. Dean had made a mental note to say something later, and taken the cup and his paperwork over to the armchair by the window to ease into the week. He wasn't in the mood to dive in just yet.
This was a very important business man, someone whose business practices, mission statement, and face were admired by people world wide. And now, Cas had the responsibility to… to, what? Not screw it up like past employees had? Maintain his reputation? Make sure he got his coffee in the morning? No, he was in the coffee business, he had to get his own coffee. Did he? Was this Cas's job now? Never in his life had he doubted his confidence in his job, it defined him, this was who he was. But this was different, and he felt all too warm as a wave of nerves flooded through him.
Wednesday, however, Dean wasn't so lucky. He woke up reaching across the bed, grasping at empty sheets before he felt a hollowness settle in his gut. Reluctantly opening his eyes, his impulse was to text Cas that he missed waking up to him as he did on days they didn't sleep at each other's homes. His body clock demanding that he stay awake, Dean decided to drag himself on a run, and he slipped outside into the surprisingly warm air.
They take him off the rack and since he can’t walk, they drag him down the hall to another room. It’s a cell just like Dean’s: small and windowless, brightly lit by the torches on the walls. It’s never dark here. The flames burn eternally, dancing as if in celebration of the endless torment.
At the time he hadn’t known whether what he was feeling was relief or terror, probably both he’d supposed. He’d always known it would end like that, being handed over to an Alpha, a random owner like some piece of property, he’d always known it was all he was worth.
Consciousness comes back slowly for Dean, the ache of sore muscles, heavy limbs finally easing and he can feel the familiar weight of Cas’s arms draped over him. The straps weren’t tight but he didn't try to test them, having them there was enough, having Cas there.
Benny read the subtext immediately, “I can assure you that that is exactly what we want too. Everyone knows that we need a new direction and will follow your lead moving forward.” Castiel was pleased to see that his gaze was steady, and his voice sounded genuine.
He knew the day had been hard on Dean, the first couple were always the hardest by far and he wanted to reward him. He had several ideas in mind.
“It wasn’t all bad. There were times when we were happy. I can remember him smiling, laughing at my stupid jokes, I remember good times too!” his voice like shattered glass, fragile, brittle.
Cas is reluctant, he hadn’t planned on this but upon reflection he should have expected it. He had needed to do this to Dean almost every night when he had first come to Castiel.
But then his head is forced up and he comes eye to eye with a very worried looking Castiel. His voice however doesn’t waver when he speaks.
Castiel pulled him into his arms, easing their bodies together and letting Dean soak up his scent and presence. Calming him as best he could.
Cas cups his jaw and leans in for another gentle reminder for his lover, lips pressed chastely against lips.
This was to be expected, and had happened before, but never this early on. Hopefully, he could still get Dean to take glucose orally. He really didn’t want to resort to Glucagon or IV dextrose yet. He scratched his head, considering his options.
Unfortunately, the hospital bed in the centre, the IV stands, monitoring machines and screens, medical equipment cabinets and drawers, all worked against that image. Especially the CRP frame currently dominating the centre of the room.
“He got good you know, at hiding it. Worked out, built up muscle. He’d watch Dad and other alphas, copy their movements, their way of speaking. He’d get me to help him pick clothes and stuff. If you met him then you would have sworn he was a beta, maybe even a weak alpha. But for Dad it was never enough, I’d come home to him taking his belt to Dean for speaking in a certain way or sitting wrong. I swear, nothing Dean could do was good enough. He was black and blue more often than not.” And that was it, the cruelest thing, because that was all a Submissive ever wanted was to be accepted, to be good enough, to be loved. Cas’s heart broke for young Dean.
, “As he is literally the only Pure Dominant in the entire country who is also a qualified Dynamic Therapist, I don’t have much of a choice in the matter. Am I happy about handing over the care of my son to someone with such a reckless ideology? No, of course not! But I’m desperate enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now.”
Dean nodded, sweet and obedient. It was disconcerting, seeing him act so unlike himself, unnatural. He didn’t even resist as Gabe checked over the fit of the mask, only giving a token protest as he increased the gas flow rate again slightly.
“Dean,” Sam’s voice is reproachful, “You got to take better care of yourself. Cas can’t do everything.”
