An awkward beat passed.
John finally calmed himself, and suddenly looked exhausted.
Sherlock took Victor’s now trembling hand in his own. “Victor, are you frightened of him?”
John forced himself into doctor-mode. “Superficial. He didn't break the skin but in two places, and that’s healing fine. No sign of infection. It’ll be gone in a week or two,” he said stiffly.
The students laid Felipe on the operating table because it was the only free bed besides their own cots. Blood ran between the Spaniard’s fingers as he pressed on the wound. He tried to speak, but it caused pain to radiate up through his neck and into his head.
“Are you alright?” he asked softly. “Quite a hero, you.”
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. "You're placating me," he said. "I expect more from you, John."
It was only a fifteen minute walk into town, but by the time the two men arrived Willam was exhausted. He sat on the grocers stoop to catch his breath as John did the shopping. They took it easy on the way home, stopping every few moments so William could rest.
“Nope.”
John looked down at where the older man was gripping his shoulders, and he realized with utter sadness that he had forgotten what it felt like to be touched.
“Tell them that they have to the count of three.”
*****
Sherlock sat up, trying to explain. “Watson, these are men on the cutting edge of scientific research. They don’t care about protocol or British society. Berlin is a rather modern city.”
They both watched in horror as the mob became violent. The villagers began to throw rocks at Felipe, who threw up an arm to cover his face from the assault. A large, sharp stone hit him hard in the neck, puncturing skin and drawing blood. He fell to his knees as the crowd descended upon him and towards the hospital.
“Two men attacked you?” John crouched down in front of the bed. “Are you alright?” He took Sherlock’s hand in his own.
John closed his eyes and sighed, crumpling the note in his fist.
Sherlock tilted his head toward the bakery.
Sherlock spotted his Boswell waving wildly and was at his side within moments.
John nodded. “Yes. More than I deserve.”
He immediately sat down on John’s lap and wrapped himself around him like a kitten.
“Rest well, m’lord,” John said softly as he smiled and pulled the blankets up under his chin.
Sherlock didn’t answer him. His demeanor suddenly stiffened as his breath slowed.
“All of the evidence, the clues...I could see it, in my mind, exactly how it had transpired, like some horrible, disgusting play on a stage. Like the murderers had set it up just for me to see.” Sherlock covered his eyes with his hands. “I felt, I felt so...”
“I’d be honored.” John finished off the wine and wiped his mouth carefully with his fingers. “You’ll stay in the city?”
“What is it?” he said wearily.
Sherlock smiled and sipped his tea.
“Yes,” John replied.  “We were flatmates. In London.”
“They believe his body was lost to the falls,” he continued, his voice hollow. “That type of force, it...the waters are freezing and very deep, I’m told.”
The man, mid-thirties, hair dark and slicked back from his face, assessed him with coal black eyes.
“I believe we should go back to the way things were,” John said, lifting the dinner jacket off the hook and opening it for his lordship.
As he took his final step onto the ledge and made his way around the giant rock overlooking the falls, John held his breath and prayed.
“My lord,” said Roberts. “With all due respect, I cannot have a lame footman. It’s not fair to the others.”
Sherlock sighed. “John, we haven’t the time.” He jumped out onto the platform and with long strides made his way back toward the station. He quickly realized John wasn’t following behind him.
It was several moments later before John realized he'd thought of Sherlock without a piercing stab to his chest. Instead, the memory of the man had wafted warmly through his mind, mixed with a bit of sadness perhaps, but it hadn't been painful.
John stuck out his palm and Ahad took it.
“This place,” said John, panting. “This place is a catacomb.” It was painfully obvious that John was patiently talking himself out of any other possible, more morbid theories.
Professor Brook's stare deepens. "You know what I do?"
William saw John shake, and his face suddenly flooded with courage.
“I’m afraid I am not sure of who you speak, Dr. Watson."
John listened in amusement as the two volleyed a few more insults back and forth. Mr. Roberts brought in the tea and poured Sherlock a cup. Sherlock dropped in three sugar cubes and leaned against the bar.
In the dream, he finally collapsed to the ground.
Felipe kissed him and stroked his chest. His fingers lingered over John's bad shoulder, inspecting the mangled tissue. They settled into each other's arms, the safety of the cot serving as a brief respite from the chaos outside the tiny sitting room. They kissed lazily off and on, resting and enjoying each others soft touches and caresses.
His look of confusion prompted the woman to repeat herself. John finally understood.
“Oh so you don’t give a fuck about any of this?”
Sherlock knew he should go back to the Sliver, change out of his sweat-soaked clothes and go to sleep. The crisp, night air quickly chilled him to the bone. He perched for a moment against the main entryway, out of the wind.
Sherlock oddly felt as if he were sitting across from a lit bomb about to go off. Brook leaned in, the maestro's eyes briefly locking on the young man's lips. “Are you sure this is what you want?”
What? "Sorry?"
The room was quiet except for the sounds of Siger shouting at his dog outside on the grounds. John’s heart felt as if it might beat out of his chest.
Sherlock didn’t answer, his eyes closed as his curls bounced with each deliberate thrust.
There was a pause. "I’m not sure."
John leaned in so closely his eyelashes fluttered against Sherlock’s sharp cheekbone.
“Where are you going?”
"I want you in my mouth, in my throat."
"Yes, I'm fine," came Sherlock's muffled response. "Now."
Sherlock ordered two hot buns and two coffees. The two men found a table near the window and ate in silence, until Sherlock pressed his leg discreetly against John's.
“John, I barely cough anymore,” he scolded. “Besides, once I start harvesting the honey, it should disappear altogether. Honey is excellent for coating the throat.”
“No?” Felipe sauntered up beside him, his hand gently brushing up and down his back. “There is little difference, except…”
John reached up to brush his knuckles against the Spaniard’s stubbled cheek. “Felipe,” he said softly. “Your offer is more than I deserve.”
Sherlock stepped inside first, the thin beam of light from his torch the only thing keeping the darkness from completely enveloping him.
John wanted to object to the formality, but didn’t. Instead, he held out his hand. Dimmock took it. The two men shared a steady, firm handshake.
Sherlock started towards the noise, but John held onto his coat.
“Watson,” Sherlock answered.
John ran upstairs and got his medical kit.  When he entered Sherlock’s bedroom he couldn’t believe his eyes.
“My phone,” groaned Sherlock. “I must have left it back at the cavern.”
"Yeah," answered John, sounding annoyed. "Just step carefully."
“Victor,” said Brook, nodding his head.
He gently cradled his wet, curly head.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and followed Roberts downstairs. Sherlock trotted eagerly behind.
The Earl continued, drawing in a long breath, as if what he was going to say next was very difficult.
“You’ll go with me, then?”
“221B Baker Street,” he said to the cabbie.
Out of nowhere, Brooks slapped Sherlock across the cheek.
John stepped out to watch the Captain Lestrade and his soldiers march away. He realized after they’d disappeared from eyesight that Felipe was not among the crowd. He went back inside and ducked behind the curtain. He crawled up the ladder pulled himself up onto the covered ledge.
“Let’s try this again,” said the dark haired man. “What’ll you have,” he said sternly.
,” groaned Sherlock. His fingers slid through soft, flaxen hair as John directed his slender sex inside his warm, soft lips.
If he thought Felipe would actually come, he’d forward a sum for his travel. With the vines at a crucial point in the growing season, and the Spaniard’s disdain for the English countryside, there was little chance of convincing the man to leave Spain for England.  John said so in the letter, knowing his lover would see straight through the excuse. Both men knew he could come home at any time, yet if loyalties were being threatened, it was still too early to tell.
“Come to bed.”
“Yes, thank you,” said Sherlock. “Oh, and Watson. Let’s keep this discussion between us.”
“How did it go?”
The afternoon sun was bright enough it lit up the sitting room without the need for lamplight. John pretended to read the newspaper, but his stare kept meandering over to the stack of papers on the end table that contained information about a serial killer, a strangler.  William had read through the information and summarily had a panic attack, in which John had forced him to sit for several minutes with his head between his knees.
Wiggins took another drag. “That’s what they say, anyway.”
Silent tears fell openly down the Earl’s cheeks.
“I’m feeling quite ill, actually. I’d like to leave. Out the back door, if there is one.”
Mrs Turner poured them each two fingers of expensive whiskey and disappeared downstairs. John refused to sit, but just stared out the window, worried out of his mind.
When John first mentioned the idea, William seemed amenable. The stories from the old Strand articles seemed to have piqued his interest in sleuthing. John knew he had to be bored out of his mind cooped up in the flat all day.
“Does that feel good?” John whispered to him, softly nuzzling his ear. “Do I make you feel good?”
Sherlock’s crystal eyes flickered to the ceiling for a moment.
“Hold still,” murmured John, holding firmly onto the needle. He pinched through William’s reddened skin and his patient grunted in pain.
Sherlock disappeared as he said he would, engrossed in the conference while John relished the quiet privacy of the suite.  He spent a good part of the day writing and eating a tremendous amount of the complimentary sausage and cheese left by the housekeeper. After washing up he headed out and flagged a cab to take him to Friedrichstraße. He drank a delicious pale ale at the Bierhaus Siechen beer palace and practised German with a few old gentlemen standing outside one of the supply shops. As the afternoon sun lowered in the sky he sat and attempted to sketch a beautiful old baroque building. He finally gave up after the dusty air kept causing him to sneeze and mess up his lines.
The water was hot and glorious as it poured over the two young men’s cold and clammy skin. John wasted no time in massaging Sherlock's dark curls into a mess of suds. The soap mixed with the shower stream became obscenely slick. John dipped his fingers into the cleft of Sherlock's behind, soaping the inside of the young man's body just as his tongue slipped firmly into Sherlock's hot, open mouth. Rivulets of water trickled from Sherlock's long eyelashes and down his pink-stained cheekbones, his hair dark and slicked back, exposing his long graceful neck, his slender fingers holding onto John, balancing himself against the onslaught of pleasure now wracking his body.
“Reeds. Five-six-and - ”
“His name is Sherlock.”
“Quite sure?”
Sherlock glared at him, his nostrils flaring. “I don’t need you to protect me!” he shouted. “Brook killed Carl Powers, he may have killed Victor, and he’s parading around like he’s done NOTHING!”
Sherlock glanced at him gratefully. He stood up and turned towards the entrance.
"I think I'm vibrating," said Sherlock humbly.
“Dr. Watson.”
“Why? Did you blow his cover? It he awaiting deportation? They'll kill him you know.”
“Thank you so much, dear,” cood Mrs. Hudson. “You’re a lifesaver!”
“Yes, of course,” he said knowingly, and left it at that.
Molly felt the ring, the weight of it now heavy on her finger, and she was suddenly desperate to explain herself. She needed Sherlock to understand that Bill was a lovely man, a good man. He had a good family. He loved cats. He loved football. And most importantly, he loved her.
Sherlock stomach flipped over involuntarily as he forced himself to meet Brook's stare.
"Hold yourself against the wall," he breathed, as he grabbed Sherlock's shaking hand and planted it against the tile.
-----------
“Isn't this what you've been waiting for? To bring that horrible woman to her knees?”
He paused to take a sip of his drink.
“Beat you with stick, see how you like it.”
Sherlock pulled him up to his feet, letting his tongue explore the inside of John’s hot little mouth.
“No, it’s not,” said John firmly. “You are asking me to risk my position.”
He turned on the metronome as he settled into his chair and began to play his assigned music. Within a half an hour, he’d mastered the piece. Satisfied, he turned off the metronome, and began to play for pleasure. His fingers led the way to piece he had composed over the summer called Violet (avec les beaux yeux). It was a sentimental piece that reminded Sherlock of his childhood, when his mother was vibrant and beautiful and loved to shamelessly dote on her children, especially her youngest.
He began to run as thunder rumbled all around him, and large drops of rain began to fall, pitter patter on the bridge and splashing into the lake.
“Did you ever ask him?”
William stood back from the hives and looked back up at the house. John watched as he moved slowly back up the pathway, as if he were terrified of setting off his cough, which seemed to overtake him at the first sign of overexertion. He had lost a significant amount of weight while ill and had yet to gain much of it back.
John finished his fifth letter ensuring the Spaniard he would be home before the harvest.
Mary shoved the phone into Sherlock’s face.
John quickly closed the book and placed it under his pillow. The soft sheets rustled around his thighs as he turned on his side, feeding the ember burning deep in his abdomen. He dared to place his hand on his body below and press firmly, the relief only brief as he helplessly curled his fingers around his hard length. His hips bucked a little as his legs fought the hot linens twisting around his ankles.
John felt his chest swell with emotion. Never had someone offered him so much. It rendered him speechless.
Evidence of a struggle.
“Tell me what I need to do,” whispered John eagerly. “I’ll do anything. Anything you want.”
John was reading in the chair next to the bed when he heard Willam’s breathing change. He glanced up from his book to see crystal eyes staring back at him.
“And this one  - the long one - was handmade for Henry Wood. 24 inches. Can you imagine, handling 24 inches?” Brook dug his hands into the pockets of his impeccable trousers, a smoldering gaze holding Sherlock's attention.
“Yes, M’lord.”
John whimpered as he breathed deeply, his lips and tongue pressing into the silk and making it wet. Sherlock in turn gripped the sofa cushions. He was determined to let John have his way, but he wanted so much more from those trembling lips torturing his swollen sex.
“Do you have any idea what the calls were about?”
“Wonderful,” he said as he kissed her on the cheek. “Thank you, Molly,”
“J. H. Watson?”
John stopped, and Sherlock collided with his backside.
Sherlock tilted his head, as if waiting for him to continue.
“I’ll catch up!” he yelled back. “You mind?” he said, pointing to the open space next to where Sherlock was sitting.
“You have it, too, I suspect. You would appreciate my Sant Sadurni d’Anoia. It is beautiful there. Vineyards, olive trees, beautiful women, beautiful men…”
Behind the door was Mr. Thomas, holding a candle with one hand and a small thick envelope with the other.
“Was that the Messiah?”
"John," whispered Sherlock. “I don’t have a condom.”
John opened the door to find Maria standing at his door, her face contorted in panic.
“What went wrong?”
John was touched at Mycroft’s sentiment. He looked over at Sherlock, who seemed to be struggling with his next words.
“Watson, you coming?” yelled one of his teammates.
John stepped forward, hands behind his back. He bowed his head respectfully.
“What about now?” he whispered roughly. “This better?”
“What do you see?”asked Sherlock.
"What else did he teach you?"
“Watson. We’re here for the view, nothing more. Two days. Two days and we are on our way to Marseilles. Now go to bed.”
Sherlock’s entire body shook as he drew in a long breath, helpless as John hooked his shaking leg over an arm to spread his narrow thighs. Fingers reached between to massage his tight, smooth testicles. A palm worked its way up to his neglected sex to deliver firm, delicious strokes. John kissed him everywhere as he played with Sherlock's lithe, undernourished body. Sherlock reached back, digging his fingernails into the back of John’s thick neck.  A pair of sun-kissed hands fondled his pubic hair and teased his opening.
“I said, what are you doing in my space?” he commanded in perfect English, though his accent was detectable and quite elegant.
“He’s going to be alright then?” Lestrade asked delicately.
The University of Edinburgh School of Medicine’s teaching hospital was internationally renowned for its advancements in surgery. The operating theater was large and state of the art, with eight rows of benches looming over the surgical table below. John broke out in a cold sweat the first time he stepped into the room. Physicians from all over the world stared down at him from the benches, some bespectacled with notebooks, others scowling with critical eyes. He took several deep breaths and continue on, joining Dr.MacDougal in assisting with his first successful surgery as a fellow.
John turned and fled without a word up the stairs to their suite. He darted into the bedroom and pulled open the end table drawer.
“Moriarty slipped up,” Sherlock said softly. “He made a mistake. He thought the one person that didn’t matter at all to me was the one person who mattered the most. You made it all possible. But you can’t do this again can you.” Sherlock said glanced down at her engagement ring.
“Alright, everyone. Reichenbach, from the top,” said Brook, looking directly at Sherlock. “Sherlock -- just do your best.”
Sherlock observed deep skin flushing at the base of the young man’s neck. He wished he were in a position to take Victor’s pulse. Love affair?
“Where are you going?” John asked gently, hovering a bit like a mother hen.
John shook his head. “He wouldn’t talk about it. But he’s not the same. He couldn’t sleep, wouldn't eat, just drank all the time. The morphine and cocaine started maybe a few months ago.” John hesitated, but then asked the question he’d been dying to ask the officer since he appeared the day before. “Were you with him, down there?”
The silence returned. The doctor’s rage began to quell just a bit.
“I trust you will be stopping by the falls on your hike?” he said, smiling.
“I’m coming,” he sighed with content, and rose to meet him.
Which was why Cromwell had become so important. It was where Sherlock could redeem himself, to jumpstart a career he could stand to pursue. Mycroft had blustered around for a good two weeks once Sherlock announced his wishes to enroll in the prestigious music school. His big brother even went as far to dissuade their father from using any influence to secure Sherlock’s very late registration papers.
Felipe in turn groaned softly. In one swift movement, he lifted John into his lap. John slid his legs apart and straddled the Spaniard’s thick thighs, all the while still hanging on to the man’s neck, lips still pressing over and over, the passion intensifying with each kiss.
"Sherlock, I think we should turn around. My torch's battery is going flat."
The next morning, despite a few fallen limbs and some pummeled plants, there was no sign of the storm that had raged through the night.
“What the hell,” he mumbled.
“So young,” he moaned, rubbing the long stick along Sherlock’s chest, poking at his nipples. Sherlock tried to cover himself, but Brook told him to stop.
Sherlock nodded. “Raibert was suddenly there, and he pulled them off of me.” Sherlock looked up, his pale eyes glassy. “He helped me up, got me some drinks to calm me down. And later it just...happened.”
Sherlock snorted in reply.
Sherlock grabbed his hard, flopping cock and rubbed it vigorously up and down. John's thrusts were becoming erratic, his arm gripping his waist hard so hard he could barely breath.
The marchioness paused again to sip her tea.
Ten weeks to the day had passed since he’d seen Sherlock in the flesh, and a telegram arrived at the hospital. With Mrs. Hudson on the mend, Sherlock was finally back in Alnwick, staying with Lady Katherine.
Suddenly, the agony subsided. Then, the pain was gone.
John collapsed onto his back next to Sherlock, his chest rising in jagged swells as he recovered from his release.
William blinked back at him.
John stared Dimmock down, looking for a tell in the servant’s demeanor. It had to be a joke.
"He had me play yesterday," he said nonchalantly.
It was then the hot water disappeared. Both men shouted in unison and jumped simultaneously out of the bathroom to avoid the freezing water pouring out of the shower head.
Sherlock nodded in understanding, but felt the familiar feeling of his stomach twisting into knots at the thought of such intimacy. But instead of dwelling on it, he caught John’s lips with his own, and kissed him sweetly, trying to show him with his mouth and lips and tongue how much he wanted to be with him.
“Oh, Sherlock,” he replied. “Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes!” He let out a laugh that sounded mostly like relief, as the tears released and slid down his cheeks.
Brook’s face grows stone cold, yet his eyes are still burning with dark amusement.
Felipe was right. By the end of the week, the hospital was filled halfway with symptomatic patients from all over the city.
John Watson’s flat is only 300 square feet, but the two young men make the most of it.
John’s eyes dipped. “Your lungs. They’re damaged, and some of it will remain permanent. You won’t be the same.”
John follows Felipe into the city to fight an outbreak.
. John had done unspeakable things to that mouth over the years. He licked his lips and stared at it.
The boys and girls would groan and respond, “Ja, Herr Lehrer”.
Felipe’s eyes dimmed as he moved back to grip his shovel.
John’s face turned crimson as he processed the information. The thought of being alone with Sherlock where no one would know them made his stomach flip. His mind momentarily began to wander into that fantasy, but he then pulled back. His mind was made up. Some things were just simply out of reach.
“Please, call me Peter,” the innkeeper replied. His smile widened as he followed John’s gaze to the water. “What you are seeing is the river Aare. You’re suite has a lovely view.”
John watched the wind whip the trees and the lightning light up the cobblestone streets as they passed through northern London. The road became darker the further they got from the center of the city. Within 45 minutes or so, the large body of water loomed before them, in the night looking like a black, reflective oil slick stretching as far as the eye could see.
*******
Thanks again for getting this far with me!
“Alright, Watson.”
“Not so much,” said Wiggins. “He targets certain players. Can’t find any rhyme or reason to it. I haven’t seen anyone humiliated like that in a while.”
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been playing, but the sweat trickling down his forehead fell into his eyeball, and he stopped briefly to rub his palm over his eye socket.
“Yes.”
"Mmm? Oh no, our former governess. Mrs. Hudson. She would take us here as children, to the chess set," Sherlock shifted, allowing his long legs to stretch out in front of him. “Our father felt chess was ‘food for the brain’. Mrs. Hudson worried we didn’t get enough fresh air. Hence, Postman’s Park.”
The Spaniard closed his eyes, as if wounded.
"Did you just-"
“I do love you,” he said seriously. “I want the best for you. You deserve the world, Felipe.”
“Wait, you don’t know how he ended up working in Munich?”
Both men chased their pleasure, taking from each other and giving back in a messy, expert rhythm of two familiar lovers. Felipe cried out first, in a thrust so deep and vigorous it lifted John's feet clear off the floor. John’s cheek smashed against the wall, his moan muffled by the flowery wallpaper as he grabbed Felipe's hand still around his prick and thrusted hard over and over until he was pulsing between both fists.
Felipe finally held John’s hips and slowly guided himself into his soft, slicked body. John welcomed him with a gasp, the absence of pain a surprise and then pure pleasure as the Spaniard began to move inside of him. His careful thrusts were aided briefly by a stroking hand, then Felipe leaned forward and pressed his muscled abdomen onto the younger man’s thickening length. He held John’s small, compact body against his wide chest and powerful hips, kissing his lips as his behind moved up and down in a gentle, relentless rhythm. John moaned in pleasure as he wrapped his short, thick legs around the Spaniard’s curved spine, tilting his bottom up to eagerly receive him.
But John was silent, seemingly struggling with his next action. He finally closed his eyes and said, “Will that be all, m’lord?”
Sherlock solemnly clicked off the burner.
“I owe you everything.”
Sherlock glanced wearily at John, but continued.  “By your age and the wear on your textbook you’re a fourth year. You come here often, to study and to play with a local rugby team. You like to compete, you enjoy the violence of the sport, it’s a form of stress relief for you. Barts is a block and half south from here. That’s where you receive your medical training. No doubt your father was a military man, judging by the army rucksack in which you carry your books. You plan to follow in his footsteps and enlist after your studies in medicine, specifically in surgery, are complete.”
He stumbled back to keep from falling, landing on his behind. He knew he could jump down into the passage, but he wasn’t sure he could scale it on his way back, so zipped open his bag and tied a rope around a large, buried rock and threw the rest of it down to the drop.
It was all quite simple, really. John didn’t want to deal with it. With him. Sherlock had been mourned and buried and John had moved on. William was nothing but an inconvenience. A living, breathing, terrible inconvenience.
“Adequate, m’lord,” answered John, as his stomach turned at the sight of sausage.
Sherlock took another long drag, and then flicked the cigarette out the window.
John threw his head back and groaned.
He leaned forward, and with a handkerchief from his jean pocket, gently wiped Sherlock’s chest clean. He then pulled him back up to his feet, just like that day in the park. Both men buckled up their trousers, but John made Sherlock turn around so he could brush the bits of grass off his coat and out of his curls.
Felipe collapsed back into the bed, taking a come-soaked John with him. The headboard slammed against the wall, leaving a dent in the wood.
John cursed under his breath, but was still grinning as he made his way back to his steed as quickly as his cane would take him.
“You have your father’s eyes you know,” he said suddenly.
The young man played as the maestro hovered over him. Sherlock looked around the room and was shocked to find that everyone was afraid to watch. Only a few players dared to glance out the corner of his or her eye.
“Your favorite baton is a useless one?” asked Sherlock skeptically.
“I’m sorry to hear it,” replied John, concerned.
John had never felt so vulnerable, yet so powerful and desired. He felt safe and protected in Felipe’s arms. He knew he would always be safe with him. He would take care of him and love him. The day he’d met the Spaniard he’d fallen head over heels. Dr. Felipe Canales was the living, breathing example of everything John had ever desired.
“Tell me more about Baker Street, Dr. Watson.”
“It looks like an office,” he whispered. “It’s empty.” John dropped to his feet, then knelt down. “Here, I’ll give you a boost,” he said, his hands clasped together.
The good doctor’s arm reached up behind him, grabbing a fistful of the younger man’s curls as Sherlock slowly penetrated him. Both men were still half asleep, moving on instinct and lust. John closed his eyes and enjoyed being filled. He pushed his hips forward into Sherlock's slicked hand, then pulled back, his round bottom slipping easily onto Sherlock's cock.
“I'm excellent violinist,” said Sherlock matter-of-factly. “My instructors however don't seem to think I'd be a successful concertmaster."
His mind drifted to Sherlock. It always did, no matter how hard he tried to forget.
“You’ll catch your death if we don’t get you back down the mountain and into some dry clothes soon,” Peter replied.
"Idiot!" he hissed. Rage bubbled inside of him. He struck his temple with his fist. The pain radiated through his eyeball.
"I thought-" Sherlock stammered. "I misunderstood -"
“You're spoiling me,” he whispered.
“It is,” answered Sherlock, forcing himself to not avert his eyes.
“You’re going to make one hell of an army doctor with those nerves of steel,” he said, praising the young man. “Come on, let’s go change our pants.”
********
“Aaah, yeah, Plan B.” John looked around, then looked back at Sherlock.
Once the courtyard was deserted, the two young men quietly wove through the overgrown bushes, John watching Sherlock’s back as the young man pushed the thick ivy vines aside, exposing the door. A subtle nod from John and Sherlock pulled the lever, the heavy door opening with a groan.
“I heard your friend’s fever broke.”
Sherlock nodded as a throb of pure want pulsed through John's cock at the sight of his blunt fingers edging inside the plump limps. A wet, slick tongue played with the tips, and suddenly it was John moaning aloud.
“John, I need you to come with me, now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John stilled his hips and kissed him gently.
John was on his feet in a flash, dressing and down the ladder within seconds.
Sherlock grunted and roughly pushed John away. He curled back up tightly against his pillow.
"You do know the secrets between us have to stop,” John said wearily.
John takes William to London.
He lowered his lamp and pulled off his nightshirt. As he slid into bed, he sighed at how good the cool sheets felt against his bare skin. John pushed the covers down to his knees and cupped his half-hard penis gently, slowly rubbing it up and down.
“SHERLOCK!!”
John ran to the British soldier’s side. He checked to make sure the two men were dead, then began to untie the hostage. The man, beaten and exhausted, looked up at him with almost translucent eyes, smiled, and then collapsed to the ground.
William bit his lip. John had to hand it to him. He really did look remorseful.
“Well, let’s order, shall we?”
When he opened the door, Sherlock found a tall, skinny young man with stringy hair and a pencil thin mustache staring back at him, looking bored and maybe a little bit high. He wore an undershirt with cargo pants and sandals with socks.
“That pretentious arsehole is your brother?” John stopped and shook his head. “Ah, probably shouldn’t have said that.”
“What’s this?” he said. “Ah, brought a bit of Baker Street with you, I see.”
Sherlock collapsed against the wall and hit his head again. "Are you okay?" he asked. When John didn't answer, Sherlock touched his face. "John?"
John was grateful the innkeeper had followed them. He was able to interpret her condition for him, and he realized within minutes that the woman needed emergency surgery to save both her and the baby.
A week later the regiment joined forces with General Roberts’s brigades outside of Kabul and the real fighting began. The Fusiliers attacked from the east along with the Earl of Cornwall’s Light Infantry commanded by the Earl himself, Major Holmes. Like Bill said, John was moved to the front line and saw first-hand the horrors of war. Men dying, dirt flying, smoke so thick he didn’t know which way to fire. For a whole day and night they pushed forward, the Afghans in retreat.
Peter urged John to accept the inevitable, but he refused to even entertain the idea.
John did as he was told. Sherlock slid down to his abdomen and sucked him, keeping him very wet. He then straddled him, and spit into his hand and rubbed into his behind. He looked almost angelic in the moonlight, so regal, his pale skin glowing and glistening with sweat.
Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes hard and dead.
The Beginner band classroom was simple and soundproofed, with chairs in a semi-circle five rows deep and ten chairs wide. Sherlock referenced his syllabus and found his seat. A thin, long-faced man sat to the right of him, dropping his folder heavily onto the music stand. He glared at Sherlock.
Sherlock is promoted to concert band. John and Sherlock do some more exploring.
“I think we’re dealing with a ghost,” he said.
“John!”
John didn’t know how to finish the sentence. He found himself desperate to confide in someone, but he didn’t want to betray Sherlock’s confidence. The line between keeping the secret and saving his lover’s life was blurring considerably more each day.
Sherlock’s lips.
I can here the WTF where did that come from? shouting in my brain. I'll explain in the next chapter. Sort of.
“I’ve written three times,” he said. “I have called on you twice, to be turned away each time. This time, Miss Turner -”
“Don't belittle yourself.”
“How did he deal with it?”
“Mr. Thomas,” he managed to choke out. “Yes, it’s me.”
It was obvious, at least to Sherlock, that Mr Watson was exhausted, hungry and in pain. He admired the young man’s tenacious composure. A fierce intelligence and self-reliance sparkled in his eyes, and though the odds were stacked against him, John Watson was a fighter. He was not leaving until he had either secured employment or had exhausted every possible angle to do so.
“I found it, over there on the bookshelf.”
"Do you want to sit?"
"Oh God, Sherlock," whispered John, his breath quickening. "What are you doing to me!"
“S’alright. I can't say no to you. My only weakness.”
“Oh, all squeakers start in Beginner band,” he said, opening the door for Sherlock. They entered into the building, and Sherlock was temporarily distracted by the gorgeous arches and gold leaf trimmings along the massive hallway. “As they await to be called up by Maestro Brooks.” Victor’s eyes narrowed. “You do know who Richard Brook is, right?”
He remained still until John dug his fingers into his skinny hips. He squirmed as John pushed his thighs apart and positioned himself between his legs. A gasp escaped his pink, insolent mouth, his body responding to the heat and pressure of John's flat abdomen.
“Dr. Watson, we need to talk.”
Sherlock tears into it like a five year old. He opens the box and pulls out a long, blue scarf.
John buried his hands in his pockets and dipped his head.
The young man trembled, blinking back tears.
“Open wide!” said the blonde, laughing, pulling his arms even tighter behind his back. He reached forward with one hand and violently began to squeeze his jaw. His lips parted slightly, and the dark-haired man pushed his cock into Sherlock’s lips.
“It’s certainly not the most beautiful man on earth in my bed.”
“Yes, looking forward to it,” answered John, adjusting his hat. “We’ll be back tomorrow before dark.
John knew it was getting late, but he couldn't bring himself to wake him.
“Am I not good enough for you, just as I am?”
“But why?”
But John only nodded.
“I hope it’d be alright if I came down later, to say hello to everyone?”
“Si,” answered John, nodding.
John grabbed his slender, pale hand into both of his and brought it to his lips, kissing it over and over.
John and Sherlock looked at each other and tried very hard not to laugh.
Dimmock left the room, but John followed him out into the hallway.
“Not in the slightest,” John answered immediately. He locked eyes with Sherlock. “Does that put you off?”
He’d do anything for Sherlock Holmes.
“‘Who solved?”
Sherlock shuffled through his music sheets to find the right composition as Brook raised his arm.
Sherlock sat down his teacup. “My friend Friedrich has invited us to dine at Reinstoff. He knows the chef and is adamant we join him.”
“Me either,” he replied softly.
"Yes."
William paused.
He leaned forward and softly, so softly pressed his lips against John’s. John groaned at the contact and deepened the kiss. He was trying very hard not to think of William as untouched - a virgin, at least in his mind, for godsakes- but every tiny noise that he pulled from the man’s throat went straight to his cock with the words
When John awoke the next morning, Sherlock was sleeping soundly. He didn’t stir at all while John washed and dressed.
“Yes,” answered Peter uncomfortably. “How could you possibly know…”
John gazed longingly back at him, his eyes hooded, darting between his beautiful eyes and the sinful lips stretched wide around his sex.
Sherlock was surprised by the warmth in Brook's voice.
“Bueno,” he murmured.
John makes a breakthrough with Sherlock's treatment.
“In most combat situations, you will not be able to move your patient to a secure location,” he said sternly, pulling out his surgical dressings. “You’ll treat the patient under possible threat or live fire, so keep it simple. First, stop the bleeding. Place pressure on the wound to restrict the blood flow. Dr. Canales is doing quite a lovely demonstration for us here,” he said, smiling down at the Spaniard.
He leaned in and pressed his prick against Sherlock's, gathering them both in his hand. “Alright?” he murmured. He thrusted his hips and Sherlock let out a surprised “Oh!” as John rubbed his thick member in rhythm against his partners long, solid cock.
He found the strength to roll onto his back, still panting from the unexpected exertion.
“But you won’t be here,” he pouts. “Baker Street’s our home.”
“That you were pretending to be a farmer to gain access to an ore mine. That a family who attested to your character were murdered when your identity was discovered.”
The tender touch disarmed John in a way he did not expect. Mixed with the whiskey, it caused a chain reaction in the doctor’s mind, and every emotion from the past two months - remorse, happiness, fear, resentment - came bubbling up all at once.
“God, you’re amazing,” he whispered passionately. “I’m going to make you feel so good. I’ve never wanted anyone so much.”
......
“Sounds right,” John said, trying to sound nonchalant. The truth was, his heart was pounding in his chest. The memories of his time spent with Sherlock on cases were the best times of his life. He longed to sift through that book alongside William.
He raised his baton.
John Watson’s employment began immediately. He moved upstairs and was given a room to share with Dimmock, the first footman. He didn’t mind. He was relieved to have a clean bed and a room free of vermin. He unpacked what little he had into his tiny dresser. He reported downstairs to be fitted for his uniform. Afterwards, it was late, and he joined the servants at the large dinner table for supper.
“Where’s Victor!”Sherlock demanded. “What did you do to him?”
“Why is Dr. Canales bleeding all over my table?” he barked at the young men. “And why are you all standing around with your head up your arses? One of you should be administering treatment here, and the rest should be checking on, oh I don’t know, our other one hundred and fifty patients!”
He stopped, and blinked slowly.
“Sherlock,” whispered John. “I know I'm being foolish.”
John watched the Spaniard fold his hands carefully over his journal. There was a wariness to his movements. It was obvious he was uncomfortable.
John smiled and began to hand him a book one by one. “Why are we putting them at the top?”
He had a needle in one hand and a vial in the other. His crystal eyes flashed with fear and shame as he watched John hover in the doorway.
“I'll write him tomorrow.”
Sherlock took off and John followed behind, looking a bit confused but curious as to where they were heading. They made their way back to the tube station, where Sherlock stopped and bought two coffees before they just made the train. John sipped the coffee continuously, the hot liquid perking him up.
John's mouth went dry as his heart beat wildly in his chest. "Why?" he whispered.
"Oh god, what did he say," said John. "Please tell me it wasn't about horses."
“Ok, little trouble there,” he said. Sherlock looked back at him, confused. Brook licked his lips. “No problem. Let’s pick it up from 17.”
Sant Sadurni d’Anoia.
He fell asleep.
He looked like an animal tracking his prey. He eyed the third trombonist, a young man, a bit overweight, with the disposition of being picked on his whole life. Brook seemed to smell the weakness rolling off of him.
The ride back to Baker Street was done in silence. By the time the men got Willam home and into bed, it was apparent the injured man was in an extremely precarious state.
“I don’t know - ” said Sherlock.
John threaded the needle. William’s cut was going to need at least 12 stitches.
echoing in his head.
John looked up, confused. “Go out?”
The man laughed and ran toward Felipe.
Sherlock stopped. “I think it was more than a fight,” he said sadly.
Some of the dialogue in the Concert band scene was taken word for word from Chazelle’s Whiplash script.
“If you will excuse me, gentlemen. I have an appointment, and if I don’t leave now, I shall be late. Dr. Canales, it’s been a pleasure.” He turned towards the door. “Watson, I’ve taken the liberty of making the four of us dinner reservations at the restaurant. I hope that wasn’t too presumptuous. I’ve let Mrs Turner know, but I can always cancel.”
“I don’t mind at all,” answered Sherlock. “I haven’t been to the museums here since I was a child.”
The inspector’s brows knitted together tightly.
He glanced over again at his new operating room. He gave Felipe an assured, small nod.
The word he’d purposefully omitted from that sentence was
"I'm going to take some liberties down here."
"From the beginning."
“I’m going now.”
Mycroft nodded as Lady Irene took the baby, holding her son to her ample bosom. John immediately joined the other male servants in putting out the fire.
He first spied two sets of footprints in the mud….no three...no two…
“Like I said, he’s nobody,” said Wiggins with certainty. Sherlock glanced up, his curiosity peaked.
"Thank you," said Sherlock gratefully. "You may have saved my life."
There was a moment’s hesitation. There really was. But within seconds they had both stripped off each other’s clothing, and Sherlock had pulled John into the shower.
“Cause you made it up.”
He finally smiled and said, “I’ll call the car.”
He pulled out the brace and handed it to John.
“Where-”
“Mr Frank,” said John softly with earnest. “Thank you, ever so much.”
The Golem was laughing.
John watched as Sherlock relaxed in his chair, his speech a little slurred, his movements slow and melty. He seemed soft and content.
He felt huge hands massaging his behind, then a finger gently rubbing along his center. Raibert’s slick tongue began probing his mouth like the fingers now inside his arse. The fingers fucked him over and over until he found himself grinding down onto the Scotsman's hand, wanting more.
John’s heart fluttered so forcefully in his chest that he had to dig his heels into the floor to steady himself. He gazed in wonder at the slender, aging man, still as graceful and beautiful as the day John had met him so long ago.
He knew meeting Felipe had changed everything. John had been living deep in denial regarding Sherlock's addiction. He was desperate to hold on to his new found freedom, and Sherlock was determined to keep the tragedy in South Africa buried deep. In the end, both men were responsible for the destruction of their relationship.
John, quite shocked at being addressed so formally, took her ladyship’s hand and kissed it. “Yes m’lady,” he answered, his voice a bit shaky. “I am humbled and grateful for your hospitality.”
“Precisely,” said Sherlock, taking the phone back, his eyes glistening at John. “He is always wearing his neon green headphones. Shy, introverted, in a world of noise and chaos, headphones allow control of at least one of his senses,” he said matter-of-faculty, picking his noodles back up and shoving a few strands into his mouth.
But the play in the bedroom happened only when they had the luxury of time to do it properly. Otherwise the two men engaged in a sexual routine that of a normal couple, albeit their appetites were a bit more vigorous than the norm. It was unusual for the two men to go more than a day or two without touching each other in such a way, and with traveling for weeks on end, they were now practically starving for each other.
Sherlock nodded his buried head. His long fingers were curled in a death grip on the front of John’s nightshirt.
*********
With those words, Brook closed the door. Sherlock stood in the hallway for a moment, then turned and walked into the loo. He needed to scrub the touch of Maestro Brook off his skin.
Sherlock observed. Blonde, tan, deep blue eyes, gentle and clever. Kind expression. Trained in first aid, but with an experienced bedside manner. Medical student?
John, unable to understand the language, watched for Felipe and Ahad’s reaction. Felipe answered immediately, throwing his hands up passively.
“Because, my dear John, you're going to tell me how he was murdered.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, then thought better of it. He bit his lower lip, his chin flattening against his jaw.
Felipe didn’t answer. He placed his foot on top of the shovel and pushed hard, severing the ground and lifting a heavy pile of dirt, flopping it ungracefully to the side.  His pace quickened, the hole growing deeper.
“I will burn you,” hissed Moriarty. “I will burn the heart out of you.”
Sherlock quickly returned to his seat as everyone began to whisper. The director stepped back onto the podium and rapped the baton against the music stand.
"Pick it up!" Brook commanded.
“John,” he said weakly. “I saw them.”
John’s sudden enthusiasm caused him to lose his balance, but Sherlock saved him before he rolled off the bed. He held John closely after that, mesmerized as his partner forced the tight jeans further down his hips, his fist fighting against his pants as the head of his red, glistening prick peeked out of the top. John's hand eagerly moved under the fabric while Sherlock shyly reached out and touched him. The shorter man’s chest heaved, his head thrown back in pleasure. On impulse, Sherlock leaned up and placed his plump lips around the head of John’s cock, his tongue gently lapping up the wet drops that had formed along the tip.
William looked over at him suspiciously. “What else?”
Sherlock held John upright as the soon-to-be doctor suddenly went weak in the knees. He stared at Sherlock, mouth open.
The middle-aged man chuckled. “Oh no, a team of oxen couldn't pull me away.” He spied the whiskey bottle and snatched it up. He turned abruptly and walked out of the room.
Lestrade appeared relieved the young man already knew. It seemed to help him continue with the story.
Sherlock, clad in his nightshirt, hair still damp from his bath, slid under the covers. John sat on the side of the bed, mixing up warm milk and spices that had just arrived from the kitchen. He gave it to Sherlock to drink.
“Right behind you,” said Sherlock, turning and following John back toward the cavern.
John scoffed and glared at Sherlock.
John knew as a doctor he couldn’t allow that to happen to a patient. And even John had to admit, William wasn’t just any patient. Some would say it was his duty to look after him. The fact that law and social norms didn’t allow them to declare it didn’t mean what they’d had together was anything less than a real marriage.
"I'm going to murder them," said John, his anger rising as he bolted off the bed. He reached past Sherlock to grab the bottle of Scotch, filling the tumbler full, only to chug it down in a few gulps. His whole chest and neck were flushed, and much like Sherlock, he was trembling.
“How is that possible?” he whispered endearingly.
John cleared his throat, and stepped between them both. "Sherlock, this is my cousin Raibert. Who was supposed to be in Malta until Boxing Day."
John smirked. “Do you remember a brown bottle?” Sherlock nodded. “Amyl nitrate. Poppers. That’s probably why you have such a terrible headache. You’ve not got a normal hangover.”
“Watson, what is it, what’s wrong?” he asked.
The room went deathly quiet.
His big brown eyes flashed in frustration as he demanded to have a word in private.
“Take care, Dr. Watson.”
It was Sherlock who broke the silence.
He studied the book closely, and surmised the penmanship was definitely Sherlock’s. He flipped through the pages, realising the book may have been a gift intended just for him.
John rested his chin on the taller man’s chest.
Sherlock closed his eyes. He felt strong arms holding him, a huge cock pound up into him over and over and over, and his throat burned, and he sobbed as that gigantic prick made him come untouched so hard and for so long that he cried out, “John, ooooh Jooohhhnn!”
"Why would it not be?" asked Sherlock. He was completely confused. What was John getting at?
Sherlock smiled. “His name is James Moriarty, 3rd Baron Femroy.” He pulled out a slip of paper from his jacket. “Donovan and I have laid a trap for his capture.”
John nodded his head. “Of course.”
“Enjoy this. It does me good to see others appreciate my family’s labor.”
“Excellent work,” said Sherlock.
******
John responded with a shout, ”Jesus fuck Sherlock, just fuck me."
Sherlock got up to stoke the fire, and refilled his brandy glass while pouring John his first. “So you aren’t regretting being here with me.”
Sherlock manhandled the smaller man so a knee was bent over his own slender thigh. His large palm was generously slicked, and he tugged and twisted and held fast to Johns length as he pressed into him.
“There’s something I didn’t mention in my letters,” he said. “William’s tried to kill himself. Twice.”
“Aye, he was. He came looking for you. But he promised his men they would see home soon. They left this morning.”
“Yes, it’s supposed to be quite a spectacle,” said Sherlock, reaching into his jacket pocket and handing John two tickets. “These are complimentary operetta tickets at the Apollo-Theater for Saturday evening. I won’t be going, but please feel free to use them as you like.”
Sherlock surmised quickly that yes, the shadow indeed belonged to Richard Brook.
“When you said you wanted to speak to my father, I knew you were the one who had saved him from death during the war.”  Sherlock smiled at the memory. “I had made you into a hero in my mind without knowing it. And there you were, before me, in your worn out suit, your hat and cane -”
“He’s not you.”
Lestrade pulled a torn piece of paper out of his pocket and handed it to the surgeon.
Raibert released John, and stood in front of Sherlock, assessing him up and down, even licking his lips as his eyes grazed his groin. "Raibert MacDougal," he said in a thick Scottish brogue, holding out his hand. "And who might you be?" he purred.
Felipe suddenly laughed, squeezing the tears from his eyes. They streamed down his cheeks.
“You must get out of the house, m’lord,” he said between breaths. “Get him into fresh air, for his lungs.”
Lestrade’s face lit up. “Aye,” he said, nodding his head. “You know him?”
Sherlock peered down the spiraling staircase. He couldn’t make out where it ended. “John, close the door.”
It felt odd being in the flat without John.
The two men fell into another fit of giggles.
With grace that rivaled a danseur, Sherlock slipped over railing and dropped down behind the overgrown bushes, right where he’d seen the two young men earlier that day. He lit the torch on his iPhone, the weak beam of light highlighting the broken strands of ivy hanging down over the stone wall. Sherlock pushed the thick, old vines aside and felt carefully along the wall, his fingers coming to rest on an old metal lever he'd seen earlier, attached to a large, wooden door.
“What did I do in London?"
“No, not quite.”
Sherlock rose from his chair and approached the maestro. Brook immediately stopped giggling.
John shook his head. “No, I was a footman, training to become a valet.”
“What - “ said John, clearing his throat. “What did you two talk about?”
"Oh, John," groaned Sherlock, his plump, wet lips searching for John's as his body was pressed deep into the mattress. Sherlock's legs parted and John slid comfortably in between, his hands slipping underneath the tight button-down shirt stretched over the young man's flushing chest.
“I want you to listen to me carefully,” he said softly. “I’ve always known your heart belonged to Sherlock. Even after he died, I knew I was still only borrowing it.” He squeezed John’s hand. “It is a miracle that William is alive.”
As the carriage turned into Land’s End, John placed his hat upon his head and smoothed out his coat. He still felt butterflies in his stomach at the thought of walking through the front door. He wondered if that feeling would ever go away.
Sherlock lined himself up with John’s tight arsehole, spitting generously into his hand and rubbing it all over his cock. He didn’t wait for permission, but pushed down on John’s hips and thrusted up. John cried out the moment Sherlock breached him, his thighs trembling, his breath ragged, a look of sweet elation on his face. Sherlock held onto him and waited patiently, whispering soothing words and kissing him sweetly on the lips. John began to grind his hips, and Sherlock's head fell back hard against the stone as intense, exquisite heat squeezed his prick.
The next few weeks passed quickly. John worked on repairing what he found to be worrisome draft in the kitchen as William set up the house to his specifications. He bought a large table that he placed in the parlour to hold his microscope and slides. He began cataloguing insects and soil samples, and kept a honeybee diary as detailed as anything John had ever seen.
Sherlock stirred minutes later, rubbing his hard, naked body against John’s backside. He pulled John’s back to his chest and kissed his bare shoulder.
“Would he have gone back to Land’s End?” asked Felipe. “Caught a train?”
He heard the door open behind him. John turned to see Felipe enter, looking weary. He smiled and approached the Spaniard.
“I think I need to go to bed.”
“Yes. Cromwell. Live there, in the dorms.”
The Spaniard’s face wafted back and forth between disbelief and rage.
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” John gasped. He closed his eyes. “That makes me very happy.”
Felipe pointed a finger at his chest. “Last Thursday. She was dying. Asfixia. You didn’t hesitate. Hands as steady as Job.” He held out a large, calloused hand to demonstrate. “Cleanest traqueotomía I have ever seen.” He leaned forward, his eyes twinkling. “In the war, in the infirmary, how many surgical procedures did you perform? As an assistant? By yourself?”
Sherlock looked away, shoving his hands into the pockets of his coat.
He shook violently as he orgasmed. Sherlock could feel the warmth inside of him, filling him up. His eyes fluttered closed and he found he couldn't help himself. He wiggled and pressed himself over and over into John’s abdomen, the pressure building until he finally succeeded in releasing himself, his seed spilling between them, his body writhing underneath the heaviness of a collapsed and recovering John. He dug his fingernails into John’s arms as he rode the waves of pleasure, feeling the wet spill off the sides of his belly.
Sherlock moaned and gagged, but recovered expertly as he continually swallowed the good doctor's prick. John then released his grip, whimpering Sherlock's name like he was whispering a desperate prayer, and eased back onto the table, his chest open and his hips bucking in rhythm with Sherlock's bobbing head. Sherlock stretched a long pale arm up John's chest, massaging from nipple to thigh as his swollen lips relentlessly sucked John Watson's cock.
Felipe managed a short laugh.
“Told you he was bully.”
“Sherlock,” he said firmly. “It’s John. Wake up. You’re dreaming.”
“Oh, don’t pretend that was you,” answered Sherlock with a scowl. In a huff he glided inside his ancestral home. John Watson gingerly followed behind him, hat and medical bag in hand.
"Now," John said matter of factly, leaning in to give Sherlock a long kiss on the lips. "Show me around your fancy music school, yeah?"
Felipe shows up at Baker Street.
“Yes,” John whispered back, leaning up to take his mouth once again.
“You’re too kind, my dear Siger,” he said. “But please understand, this decision is made. I will be leaving for London within a fortnight.”
Sherlock stood in front of the fireplace, slowly peeling out of his wet clothes. John could tell something was wrong. His shoulders were slumped and he seemed weary.
John headed downstairs to the servant's hall. The housekeeper stood in the hallway with an envelope and a basket.
Felipe hovered over John as he sat down his buckets.  Anxiousness rolled off of him in waves.
“I'd settle for you taking a shower,” said Sherlock, crinkling his nose.
“And your mom?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and Raibert walked off, strutting around the room, looking for his pants.
“Alright,” said Sherlock, turning back to the Duke and Duchess. “Walter, this way to the marvels of the new scientific age,” he said grandly. The Duke laughed and the party disappeared inside the doors as the servants returned to the side entrance to get to work.
“Yes, thank you for your services,” said Mycroft, approaching his brother. “It’s good to know there are those with some civility in your sport.” He turned and glared at a tall, muscular rugby player standing off to the side.  “I hope you’re willing to compensate for any damages that he may have sustained.”
The man’s eyes sparkled at John, amused by his gall. “And you are?”
His lips continued to lavish tender licks until Sherlock's body was supple and relaxed. John ended with a long, deep kiss, and tenderly placed his fingers back inside of him. He licked his way back to up to Sherlock’s sex laying red and leaking on his belly, and sucked him and sucked him until he was a writhing mess of glistening pecs and whimpering lips.
"Professor Brook would like to see you."
John visibly trembled with rage. His chest heaved as he glared at the older man, as if searching for the most vile, piercing words imaginable.
He didn’t realize he’d fallen asleep until he awoke from a hand gently shaking his shoulder.
“William’s recovery will be arduous,” said Felipe. “You know as well as I do he may never return to full health.”
John looked up, taking a glimpse of each painting until his eyes settled on one he’d seen before.
"Sherlock Holmes, sir."
“Thank you, Dr. Watson,” she said. “For being such a kind man to my sister. I know you must be very weary after these two horrifying months.”
“Don’t,” John warned, and kept walking, leaving Sherlock behind in the courtyard.
Sherlock stumbled forward in disbelief. His eyes bored into John’s. John stared back, his gaze steady.
Sherlock was eating cold chips when he heard Mary shouting for him from below. His blood ran cold as he stepped out onto the landing.
The weather was dry and glorious and the sun shone brightly for the next two weeks. Sherlock’s progression to health was slow but steady. John hired men to pack up the house in the village for shipment back to Cornwall. Both men were determined to return to England as soon as humanly possible.
“Johnny, there’s been a terrible accident. Your mother -”
John cursed, growing frantic. He tried to scale the rocks next to the ledge, to see behind the falls, but he stumbled and fell.
Oh would to God he would but pitty mee,
On Christmas day, the servants were allowed to have the evening off. Most of them headed down to the village for the service and caroling.
Sherlock groaned and wrapped his long legs around his lover’s waist.
John chuckled. “Your surprise. Well done.”
Huge kudos to my precious BanimalQ who was the sick fuck who came up with the idea that Raibert had slept with all his cousins sans Harry. It was a stroke of genius that added another dimension to the Watson family mess.
“You know, some day you’ll grow to enjoy this,” said Brook causally. “I know it’s hard to believe, but there’s pleasure in pain. You just have to learn how to receive it.”
Midway through the second round of libations the plates were cleared, so John pulled out the package left for him by Molly earlier that morning. Sherlock watched the doctor carefully unwrap it.
“This happens a lot when you let yourself sleep, yeah?” asked John, though it was more of a statement than a question.
John’s face contorted in confusion. “Murder? Why would you think that?”
“That’s what I like about you, Sherlock. The others, they gave up too easily. You've got spirit. You’re not afraid.”
“Dr. Watson,” he said. “May I take your things taken up to your room?”
Then he and I with love would soone agree,
Sherlock held out a gloved hand. John gripped it tightly, his gaze heated.
"There’s excellent Chinese around the corner.”
“Oh my God,” he heard John exclaim behind him. He turned to see John, his back up against the passageway, shining a light on an indentation in the wall.
“Watson, you’re a bloody genius,” remarked Sherlock. He threw the packing straw all over the floor as he pulled out a set of large, leather-bound books with gold lettering.
“It never does.”
---to be continued----third installment to appear in early 2017
After a particularly bloody surgery where he’d lost the patient, John shuffled wearily into the tiny sitting room off to the side of the main hall. He closed the door behind him and collapsed onto the cot.
“No, I mean it. I could see through it. I could see you,” he said adamantly, his voice reflecting reverence and awe. “You were a soldier that came home from war, but no one was there to take care of you, not like we were able to care for my father. You saved his life but you yourself suffered. Greatly. I could see the lines of starvation in your face, how your leg shamed you. You were in such pain.”
John stared at Sherlock with his puffy eyes and swollen nose, and tried to compose himself. He shook his head, and swallowed, then tried again.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “He got away, Mycroft. Or have you been paying attention?”
Sherlock leaned in, his lips close to Victor’s ear, and whispered: “I saw you.”
He dropped his gaze and shook his head.
John was flat on his back again as Sherlock began to move his hips, slowly grinding onto John’s body as his lover filled him up.
Early the next morning, John walked down to the village to personally post his letter to Felipe. He wanted the Spaniard to be aware of Sherlock’s...reemergence, as soon as possible.
The fame, very unexpected, upset John at first. Sherlock, who had become more beautiful with age, was constantly propositioned. Everyone wanted him; men, women, young, old, rich, poor. He loomed over crime scenes, could see things others couldn't, observing and dissecting and making connections with ease. Women would throw themselves at him, men chatted him up. Sherlock seemed indifferent to the whole phenomenon.
“Maybe. What’s your business with him?” John demanded.
Sherlock cut him off, whirling around the carriage like a mad man. “That’s why she dismissed you John. Your mother must have used the knowledge as leverage to gain employment. A vicar’s widow, a young child - it all makes sense now!”
“Then what?”said John, growing impatient. “Sherlock, I can’t protect you if I don’t know what’s going on.”
The villagers, cold and tired, surrounded him, all with looks of sympathy and concern on their kind faces.
The old man nodded as if he could care less, and shoved the pencils into a small bag.
John held his teacup to his lips and blew at the steam rolling off the top.
John forced himself not to roll his eyes in frustration.
“Yes,” he said. “My white tie. Please.”
Sherlock looked up, annoyed. “No, thank you.” He shook his head in disbelief, and continued to text.
“So I’m replaceable, just like that?”
“I need a bath.”
“Oh, you went easy on me then?” Sherlock said, his eyes flashing. “Did you bother to wake me this time, or did you just have your way with me while I slept?”
John finally resigned his curiosity and leaned his head against the side, hoping to catch a little sleep before they boarded.
“Name’s Anderson,” he said. “I don’t care what your name is. But you’re my second chair, and your job is to turn pages and stay out of my way.”
Sherlock pulled his knees to his chest and drank generously from the flask, deep in thought. Wiggins stood up, and lightly placed a concerned hand on his skinny shoulder.
“Ah, hmmm...I was reading your file. Cambridge before this?”
Sherlock refused to look him in the eye as he broke down. He cried tears of regret and sadness. John held him close and comforted him the best he could.
“I thought it might come in handy.”
John nodded wearily. “What else am I do to?”
Surely, he'd come around.
He took John's hands and placed his palms on his behind as he rode him, his milky thighs fluid and rhythmic, pulling John’s desire out of him one pulse at a time.
The two men from the bar forced him inside, one holding him against the stall wall as the other locked the door.
"I really don't want to break down this door."
“How ‘bout a little broth?” he said, in an attempt to compose himself.
“John -”
The man was responding kindly to Mrs. Hudson. “He’s coming ‘round. See?” He cradled Sherlock’s head. “Sit up, mate?”
"No." Sherlock didn't move from John. He clung to him like wet towel.
He paused to study John with intense interest. John stood silently, blinking back at him.
“What are you doing?”asked John, confused. “Shouldn’t we go back?”
Alone, without prying eyes of an audience and his former partner pacified, he lay there and allowed himself to simply feel. He let his eyes wander over Sherlock’s sleeping body, a body he used to know intimately, fixating on a few wisps of chest hair peaking out from under his loosened shirt. His curls had been swept aside by a well-placed arm, so the scar over his cheekbone was prominent, red and angry. It led deep into his scalp, much deeper that John realized.
Sherlock reached up and hit the ceiling twice with his fist. The carriage jerked and took off, heading up the lane to Lands End, to home.
He poured another glass for himself and John.
John again tried to protest, but Jean was stubborn. John took another look around. He knew he could do it. If it didn’t work out, well, he was out nothing.
John lowered his gun. “Aye,” he said. “John Watson. Enlisted, Fifth regiment, Northumberland Fusiliers.” He tucked the gun into his back and saluted the officer. The officer saluted him in return.
He dressed and went down to breakfast. Mycroft, Irene, Singer and Sherlock all sat around the table eating toast and eggs. John was shocked to see that Sherlock was bright eyed and bushy tailed, the exact opposite of how a man who had matched him drink for drink should look. John was bloody well convinced the barmaid had emptied the entire bottle between them.
Felipe hummed in response and buried his face deeper into his body. He worked thoroughly to open him with his tongue, leaving him aching for the Spaniard's cock. John slid his hand between his body and the mattress and palmed his own prick. Precome slicked his fingers as he felt his testicles full and taut against his pelvis.
John stopped and looked back at Sherlock, his eyes surveying his body.
A tiny spark of understanding shimmered in Sherlock’s translucent eyes. His breathing slowed. “How?”
“A surgeon? One, you are good with your hands, steady, and two, you have small hands, surgeon hands. If you hadn’t decided to become a surgeon someone would have eventually suggested it. You still study your first-year anatomy textbook but it's nowhere near exam time, so you are on rotations, mostly on your own. You’re practice year is approaching, so you want to be prepared."
“Love,” he said. “People use that word all the time. Rarely do they know what it really is.”
John nodded, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.
“You smell odd. Are you drunk?” Felipe held him at arm's length and assessed him critically.
The cavern was surprisingly warm despite the freezing temperature outside. Sherlock placed the white allergy mask over his nose and mouth as he approached the archway to the second and unexplored corridor. He was taking precautions, because he wasn’t stopping until he found something to put Brook away, even if it took all night.
Early the next morning, John knocked on Sherlock’s door.
John dropped his rucksack at his side. Army-issued, at least 20 years old, observed Sherlock. A textbook jutted out from the corner.
“I knew you’d come around,” he said.
They should have been back by now.
When John awoke the next morning, he found Sherlock curled up next to him, breathing softly. The sheet had fallen to his hips, leaving his chest exposed and his soft cock peeking out from the bottom. John licked his lips. He had dreamt of Sherlock’s body all night in strange, broken scenarios that made no sense, except he knew he’d spent his entire sleep aroused and wanting more.
“There's an outbreak,” he continued. “Enteric fever. The flooding-”
Mr. Thomas’s visit had indeed given John the “kick in the arse” he so desperately needed. He’d stopped the heavy drinking and cigars, and his health had improved significantly with daily walks and regular meals.
He remembered later that the bottle was brown. He leaned forward and smelled it just like Raibert told him too.
The old man behind the counter looked up at him behind round, tiny spectacles.
He gently lowered himself onto John, the tip sliding inside of him. Excitement filled his trembling body. He braced himself with both hands against John’s abdomen as he pushed down more, feeling the stretch of his body fighting against the invasion, a feeling of heat and fire and pain briefly sweeping through his senses.
Sherlock raised his blunt chin and narrowed his eyes. “I gave you this life.”
“It’s not about the money, it’s about this, isn’t it,” John said softly, swirling the burgundy liquid around the tin. “Losing this means losing a part of yourself.”
So he wrote more adventures, and in turn, they made Sherlock famous.
John's teeth bit and tugged at his full lips. He ran his fingers tenderly down the concaved belly, where the hard, slender organ lay. He stroked with a loose fist as Sherlock groaned helplessly. Raw desire had replaced some of the anger in his beautiful, translucent eyes. John locked his own eyes on those crystal orbs and stuck out his tongue. He licked at his throbbing, red nipples, leaving them wet and glistening with saliva.
“It is not vazey. It is a very noble, distinguished name!”
Donovan gave John a look that he clearly read as “get on with it”.
No one argued with the housekeeper, and instead traipsed one by one up the stairs and into the sitting room.
John held Sherlock against his chest and slowed his breaths. The young nobleman began to calm himself with each inhale and exhale.
“If you haven’t found his body, then he could still be alive,” he whispered.
“I was told this was a beautiful place I should visit someday, so here I am.”
“My memories are gone,” he said. “I must make new ones in order to become...someone.”
“Hello boys,” she said, her voice cracking with age. “It’ll be five quid for the self tour. 10 for the guided.”
"I don't know," answered John. "I mean, you've had past relationships. Everyone's different and likes different things. To each their own."
“Alright?” he whispered as Felipe released his lips.
“You solved,” John corrected. “I was just along for the ride.”
He then opened his eyes, his gaze settling softly on Sherlock’s odd and distinctly beautiful face. “What's done is done. Marching into Halidon Hall and shaming an old lady won't erase my suffering. it will just create more torment for others.”
Sherlock was still a bit sickly, too thin and pale, but the twinkle in his pale silver eyes had returned. John selfishly wanted the man with him in Edinburgh, but as usual Sherlock refused to listen to reason and often traveled by rail back to the Alnwick’s estate to call on Lady Katherine. His constant back and forth made a full recovery difficult, but the arrangement remained until mid-winter, when Mother Nature interceded.
“Knight to B-7” said Mycroft with a boorish yawn, as he pushed the black piece four spaces.
“I confronted him about that night. The night you said you saw us,” He shook his head, as if wanting to erase the memory. “I told him that I wasn’t going to do that anymore. That it was too dangerous and people were going to find out.”
“That will be all, Watson,” Sherlock answered softly, avoiding eye contact. “Goodnight.”
Sherlock buried his face in John’s neck as he felt warm lips pressed tenderly against his temple. Sherlock was beginning to understand that John wasn't anything at all like his former lover; the one who had taught him all those tricks with his mouth and throat, all those sessions of getting it just right, over and over again. The only release Sherlock had ever received was by his own hand. Sebastian Wilkes had never touched him in tenderness, never kissed his forehead, never stroked his chest. John had done all three in the last few hours, on their first date no less. Sherlock was trying to respond in kind, to give what he thought John needed. He'd resorted to the only way he knew how to be sexually intimate with another person, and he realized it wasn’t normal. Shame and embarrassment momentarily overwhelmed him.
John’s brows were knitted tightly and his eyes were closed, but he gasped as Sherlock’s lips moved over his shoulder. He opened his eyes and watched in amazement as Sherlock worked his lips down into his abdomen, licking the hairless patches with his tongue, kissing the scars, brushing his lips against the tough skin that had grown around the shrapnel cuts.
“Oh, I don’t know,” smiled John. “I dare say it was luck that bounced that rugby ball off your head.”
Embarrassed, he slid out of bed and padded to the bathroom to clean himself up.
Sherlock didn’t answer him, but kept looking along the wall. He heard John sigh behind him.
William managed to latch onto the thing’s neck and hang from his back, but was flung off to the floor. John reached for his gun, but no sooner had he pulled it the strangler knocked it from his hand and it skittered across the waxed floor. Giant hands yanked William to the floor, and those long fingers wrapped easily around his delicate throat.
John began to retreat, but Felipe’s legs held him tight.
The Earl of Cornwall had complained of acute, severe pain in his abdomen. The local physician had surmised it was simply a flare up of his wound from the war. Within days, however, it was evident that something was seriously wrong with Siger Holmes. It turned out his appendix had ruptured, and it was too late to stop the damage.
John was gobsmacked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Felipe turned around, his kind, brown eyes full of pain and longing. John felt his own heart thump in his chest as he licked his lips.
“Stop, stop,” he begged, as he felt himself close to climax. He forced himself off of Felipe’s lap, and fell ungracefully onto the hard ground. There he lay, catching his breath, and giggled.
He reached for his pocket watch, and suddenly rose from the bench.
He leaned forward and gently tugged at a pretty pink nipple with his teeth. Sherlock bucked into his abdomen.
“Speaking of Christmas, I have a gift for you.” John pulls out a wrapped box from under the couch.
“Ahad,” he shouted. “Ahad!”
Sherlock didn't answer right away. The silence was deafening between them.
John stared, dumbfounded.
John’s face brightened, his eyes glancing gratefully at Sherlock. “Yes, sir, in Kabul. We convalesced in the same infirmary. His lordship was very kind and offered me employment in Land’s End, as I am a trained footman and valet. My former employer was the Marquess of Berwick.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. He handed it over to Roberts. “I am eager to fulfill any position. I can start today.”
"Nonsense, John," replied Sherlock. "The chances of dying during sexual activity is abysmally low."
John finally looked up. Sherlock’s stare was intense. He looked disappointed and sad.
“He sells fresh honey to all the bakeries in a three block radius. I’ve been studying bees for quite some time, ever since…” William stopped himself, as if forcing himself to stop rambling and make a proper point. “I think I can double his honey output just by configuring the placement of the hives. You see, the bees need access to the plants in the park, so -“
Sherlock, on the other hand, was in his element. His observational skills mixed with his nobleman authority and increasingly good looks opened almost every door to him in the city. Unlike John, who focused solely on his surgical practice, Sherlock infiltrated all sorts of professions and trades, as if trying to find a niche for himself that didn't include being an heir to a earl.
John's eyes grew dark with want. He licked his lips.
“We’ll hold on to you. Three tugs, and we pull you up. If I think you’re in danger, we pull you up. Yes?”
“I endeavor to be more of myself each day.”
----------
An idea formed in his mind.
Sherlock nodded eagerly. John removed his hand from his mouth, noticing the impression of pink fingerprints on the side of Sherlock's pale cheek.
“Have you ever been to Berlin?”
John hesitated, then boldly stepped into the kitchen.
During these moments, John could almost smell the mix of pipe tobacco and spices, wool and tea, the scent that was distinctly Sherlock. The memory would calm the ache long enough to get him to sleep, but it returned every morning when he was fully awake.
“Well, I had no idea.” said Sherlock appreciatively, winking back. Victor laughed, his dimples making him look several years younger. The young man disappeared into the crowd, but Sherlock continued to gaze after him. There was something about Victor, something unusual, that Sherlock couldn’t quite deduce. He made a note that further data was needed.
“All your little puzzles making me dance, all to distract me from this!” he bellowed.
Brook finally took a step back.
“See you at eight!” he shouted behind him.
Sherlock gently cupped his cheek. “What do you want to do?”
Sherlock let out a quick sob of distress, and he felt John hold on to him steadily, letting him adjust to his girth, his length. Finally, Sherlock pushed oh so slowly back against him, and John groaned in pleasure.
“Of course! Everyone is anxious to hear about your trip.”
The trip was long but not nearly as uncomfortable as John had imagined. He could actually stretch out and sleep on the boat and the train and there was food to eat and beer to drink. The further south they went the warmer the air, and when they finally reached Tangier the sea breeze felt like heaven on Earth.
Sherlock looked around the tiny dorm room, but his eyes finally landed on the bathroom floor. He reached forward and turned off the shower spray.  “Carl Powers was murdered, but no one noticed. No one cared. A young man’s life was taken away, for no reason, and I knew if I had the time and the resources that I could figure out who did it.”
"Where in the world did you learn to do that?" asked John, still out of breath.
John looked at him incredulously. “Don't you think she already has? Worried every day her dirty little secret would be exposed?”
“No, it would be rather...cumbersome,” answered Sherlock. He knew Brook was enjoying the flush appearing on his cheeks from the blatant innuendo.
When Sherlock opened his eyes, they were filled with pain.
"Friend of yours?" quipped John.
John shook his head. A smile tugged at the corner of his lips until he was beaming ear to ear. Sherlock smiled back, the edge of his lip catching on his teeth. John’s heart ached from fullness as he watched Sherlock’s crooked smile fill his cheeks and light up his beautiful crystal eyes.
“Not beans on toast again.”
Not long after, there was a loud knock on the door.
The room reverberates with a complex chord screaming from a violin. Over, and over, the wail of the crescendo is overwhelming, piercing the ears, pressing on the heart. Strike, strike the bow against the string, long, delicate fingers tapping the fingerboard as the young man - eighteen years of age - moves effortless with the notes, a serenity displayed clearly on his face, eyes lightly closed. His alabaster neck and forehead glistening with sweat as he effortlessly commands another run of the strings. His dark curls stick against his forehead, his lithe frame graceful against the pull of the delicate instrument against his chin. The run becomes frayed; there's slight hesitation...a missed note...a trickle of sweat makes its way over a squeezed eyelid…
“Alright if I take in here?”
A fresh wave of relief troops finally poured forward at daybreak. The Royal Horse Artillery flew by the soldiers, shouting and galloping and blowing their horns. In the disarray John found himself near the foot of a mountain. He hobbled over to get out of the way and to rest his body against the cool rock. It was abnormally hot for the time of year and his canteen was almost empty. He was afraid of the hot sun rising in the east.
John washed Sherlock’s hair and then bathed him gently, using his expensive soap scented with sandalwood. When he’d rinsed him, he gathered him in his arms and held him, the bath water still hot but now filmy with soap.
He kept whispering his name until Sherlock kissed him on the lips to still him.
Peter thanked the duo once again, then disappeared, pulling the door shut behind him.
Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly. “What?” he said in disbelief.
Translations
“It’s alright, John,” he said soothingly. “We’ll get to the bottom of this.”
“I don’t know what you’re up to, Holmes, but be careful. He may be a ghost, but he’s also a very bad man.”
Finally, as dusk settled in, Mr Frank approached him and asked if he would like to sit down. When John went to move to the chair, he collapsed to the floor and didn’t awaken until the following afternoon.
John rubbed the tip of his cock against that plump lower lip, before pushing himself into that warm, open mouth.
Felipe mouthed and flicked at the puckered entrance then pressed firmly inside. John gasped and gripped the slats of the headboard. He pressed himself back into the Spaniard’s jaw, deepening the breach and impaling himself on the man’s tongue.
“I had no idea,” he managed to say, as heat began building in his chest.
Two figures were barely visible behind the greenery. A tall, gangly ginger boy stood in front of a shorter boy with sunkissed blonde hair. They were laughing and touching. The ginger boy gently pushed the blonde up against the stone wall covered in ivy and kissed him. The kiss grew passionate as the ginger boy’s fingers were brushed the blonde’s cheeks.  The ivy moved along with them, tearing and falling around them. The boys chuckled.
Sherlock’s eyes were drawn to the one in the middle, the initials J.H.W. stitched in blue in the corner.
Felipe shook his head, his eyes glistening. “You are back in my life.” He stepped forward and gripped his shoulder, careful not to embrace him with the workers sitting so close by. “I'm so grateful. And so, so happy.”
I honestly thought this was going to be the last chapter but I have more to write. Bear with me. I'll try to make it worth it haha
“I’m sorry,” he said softly. “When would you leave?”
“Maybe you can’t.”
“If you don't let go.”
They briefly shook hands as Victor nodded toward the front door. “Come on. I’ll show you where Beginner band meets.”
“Is this in response to Anderson tripping you in the courtyard?” asked Sherlock. John didn’t answer. His eyes had been on the unlit fireplace the entire time Sherlock was patching him up. “You of all people should know better. Your leg-”
“Sherlock, listen to me,” said John. “You have to stop thinking about it over and over again. It's the only way to heal. The only way to forgiveness.”
“What do you mean?” Donovan asked.
“Come on,” he said. “We’re going riding.”
“Yes, he replied. “Now. Now I’m alright.”
“Mycroft,” said Sherlock. “Roberts, may I speak with you outside?”
Sherlock kissed and nuzzled along his solid neck and into his left shoulder, which was strong and muscled. He then caught sight of the opposite shoulder, and for John's sake, suppressed his reaction.
Mr Thomas scoffed good-naturedly. “It seems you both enjoy appetite-inducing activities, especially those that take place in the wee hours of the morning.”
“Yes?”
William blinked, as if a bit wary to speak.
John sighed, gave up and left.
“You’re sure your memories haven’t suddenly returned?”
“Catacombs in London are rare,” he said, glancing up at the main hall. “Yet rumors persist there are treasures hidden within the tunnels or the coffins themselves. There’s an urban legend that states wealthy patrons hid their priceless possessions in these particular passages during World War II.”
“I didn’t want to tell you because I thought it a surprise, but now I realize I didn’t quite think it through…”
John whimpered.
! How could someone have known?”
John trudged forward, following spatters closely with his lantern. He heard the water splashing against the boards below him as the wind blew. The railings along the bridge were but rope strewn on either end, with a fastener and loop on a wooden pole every six feet.
“I thought you understood. I can’t just report him!”
After a few moments the sounds from the orchestra again filled the hallway. Sherlock felt his heartbeat reset to the rhythm to the hypnotizing concerto. He leaned against the door for a long time listening to the piece of music.
The man crosses his arms, giving Sherlock Holmes an appraising look. "You know who I am?"
Tiny little gasps escaped Sherlock’s throat as John pressed up against him. The ailing man’s head hit hard against the wooden headboard.
As they approached the entryway to the flat, it opened. Mrs Turner escorted Detective Inspector Donovan through the door, and he almost collided with John.
It had been one month to the day since he’d left. At this point, John knew there was a chance Sherlock was no longer alive.
He had no idea how long he was lost in the pleasure of Sherlock as he rocked back and forth.  He felt his desire beginning to peak, so he ground himself shamelessly back onto Sherlock's groin.
John nodded, his eyes fierce with resolve. “If I have anything to do with it, he will.”
John nodded his head with some reluctance. “Alright.” He wished he had his Browning on him. He’d bought a gun in London with the last of his savings after the war. It was the only thing of value he owned. He'd left it in his luggage back at the hotel. Now he wished it was safely tucked against the small of his back.
-------------
"Sherlock! Come in, come in, close the door," said Brook. "I like to chat with students new here to the school."
“Where have you been?!” He said, wiping tears from his cheeks with the back of his sleeve. “The last we heard you’d went into the army never to be heard from again. How long has it been?”
“Join me?” asked Sherlock.
He stretched his lover's arms out over his head, his slicked fingers threading through Sherlock's. The young surgeon let his weight drop onto the nobleman’s sweaty body.
John cut him off with his lips, devouring him with one deep, passionate kiss after another. He carefully thrusted inside Sherlock as far as he could go, and held himself there for a moment.
Sherlock let out an “umph” sound as John forced his way into his bespoke trousers.
John couldn’t help but smile.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
It was Mike Stamford who encouraged him to submit his stories to the local paper. John felt utter shock when he received the publishing notice - in fact, they wanted to offer him a column if he had more.
“Then, he plied you with some strong, sweet alcohol, sucked your cock, shoved some Brown under your nose and fucked you until you passed out.”
“John!”
He went over to the elegant, trim desk and pulled on the drawers. They all revealed nothing but letters and tests tubes and random findings from Sherlock’s scavenger hunts. He then noticed the bottom drawer’s appearance was off. It was too shallow. He pulled out the letters lying on top and lifted the base inside. Hidden underneath was a long box.
And as John came back down to reality, his body completely and utterly satiated, he discovered with shocking clarity that he was not in love with Felipe Canales the man, but with the life the Spaniard led.
The man glared at him and said nothing.
“Watson. I don’t want…” He paused and looked down at John, who was staring back at him a bit mortified. “I give you my word. My intentions are true.”
“Blasted hat,” he mumbled. “How did he ever wear this thing comfortably?”
John chuckled. “That too.”
He carefully touched John’s bad shoulder. “How did this happen?”
“Of course I welcome your insight on such matters,” he said softly. “But I’d hope you would consider...moving. To the country. With me.”
"That means you're kipping on the sofa, my cousin!" said Raibert good-naturedly.  "And my first chore will be to wash my sheets. They must be filthy. I'm sure Johnny's shagged you rotten many a night."
“No!” Victor responded vehemently. It was loud enough they caught a few glances from the room. Victor managed to compose himself just as Brook entered the room.
But then, he unexepectedly smiled. “When I ran into your father again, I had just been tossed out of another job interview.”
“Answer me, goddammit!” he growled.
“What?” said John, grinning and giggling at his comrade, who was now in tears.
The Hon. Earl of Cromwell
“Yes, bravo indeed.”
“Other interests? Hobbies?”
Sherlock pressed his fingers into his stomach as the warm liquid pooled along his erection. He gathered himself in his hand and glided his fist along his organ, using John to slick himself. John watched him with wide eyes as Sherlock worked himself into a frenzy, his hips bucking as his palm stroked and twisted. He whimpered and spilled onto the same spot John had moments before, their seed mixing on his slender, white belly.
“Sherlock?” whispered John.
“Thank you,” William answered, and began to get up from the tub.
The grate easily opened, and with John’s help Sherlock pulled himself up and into the office.
He laid back down next to Sherlock and sighed.
Sherlock’s words were the tonic to his malady. What did it matter, after all? It would change nothing if he were recognized. He’d survived, made something of himself. He had nothing to be ashamed of.
Lady Cornwall looked after John, insisting he stay at Land’s End. He stayed only a few nights, however, as he wished to return to London. Mrs. Hudson had fallen ill at the news of Sherlock’s death, and though her sister, Agnes, had arrived from France to look after her, he still wanted to make sure she was receiving the best care. Irene and Mycroft were secretly relieved when he left, as the thought of losing Mrs. Hudson so soon after Sherlock was almost too much to bear.
He pushed her hands away, but nodded.
Sherlock felt the blood drain from his face.
John scrolled through the pictures.
He then convinced John to stand, and after wiping him down, dressing him and wrapping him in his coat, took him back to the Sliver, where he helped him shower and put him to bed for the night.
TWO YEARS LATER
He grabbed his hat and jacket and followed them out to the street.
Sherlock paused. Was that good or bad? "I thought you'd like it,” he said honestly.
William acted as if he could care less about Dzundza, still critically assessing John’s body to make sure he was free of injury.
As routine, John knocked on his door and entered with riding clothes and boots. Sherlock, still in his robe, was packing a small bag with paper and pencil and small glass tubes.
The innkeeper obliged, though grudgingly as John tied the rope around his waist. As the villagers arrived, he convinced them all to lower him down the side of the cliff. With a torch in hand, John shimmied down the rock.
“Careful, Sherlock,” said John, following him. “I’ll be right behind you.”
Sherlock eyed him for a moment, then went back to his phone. "Not having. Working."
“I want to fuck you,” he murmured, voice heavy with sleep.
John stood up and leaned in to Sherlock, his hot breath on his cheeks. “If you don’t stop injecting yourself with those drugs, you will die. There are signs, and you have them. Your organs are shutting down. It’s only a matter of time.”
"Promise me," John said seriously. "Never find yourself alone with him. If you do, leave immediately."
“He doesn’t remember me.”
“Thank you,” he murmured. “Thank you for your patience and understanding. For caring about me.”
John shook his head. “He would’ve stopped by here first. At least packed a bag, I would think.”
Sherlock stepped inside and began to take photos as fast as his iPhone would let him.
He fell asleep with hope in his heart.
The fire crackled and popped in the hearth.
If it be sinne to love a sweet-fac'd Boy,
John Watson had fallen face down onto the cold, hard ground in between Anderson and Dimmock. His cane lay haphazardly in the middle of the Courtyard.
“I should have stepped in sooner,” said John, feeling guilty. “The fact I even let you stay in that place is a reflection on my-”
Inside, a huge, ancient desk was squeezed against one side of the narrow lobby. An even more ancient woman greeted them kindly.
John sighed. "Sherlock -"
John just sat in his chair, stared out the window and drank.
He slumped against the wall to catch his breath.
“Sherlock, I choose you.”
“Mama is livid, uncle Felipe,” he said in impressive English. “You forgot to pick up the fish yesterday and her potaje de vigilia is on the verge of ruin!”
“I received a letter from Commander Lestrade requesting my presence in South Africa,” said Sherlock.
“Now you’re in control,” he said gently, running his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. “I’ll help you, but you decide how much, how fast, how slow. And believe me,” He lifted Sherlock’s chin up to meet his eyes. “I’ll be enjoying myself. Stay out of that mind of yours,” he said, grinning.
John couldn’t help but stare as Felipe took him deeper into his throat with every bob of his head. He watched as the Spaniard unfastened his own trousers and shove his free hand inside to palm his own prick. The sucking sound from Felipe’s expert lips echoed in the room, a glorious, filthy reminder of how much John missed having sex.
John's palms pushed against Sherlock's pale chest and as he rolled his thick, muscled hips in a steady rhythm on his lover’s lap. His tanned thighs, toned and strong, moved like consistent and unrelenting waves, milking Sherlock's cock buried deep inside.  His neck arched as he threw his blond head back, an errant tear trickling down the side of his cheek as he gripped onto Sherlock's forearms.
Anderson’s expression went from elation, to confusion, to embarrassment. Brook shook his head and continued to giggle as Anderson, shoulder's slumped, made his way back to his seat.
“Fuck off!” the blonde yelled back.
John watched as Felipe gave a few hard thrusts into his own palm and doubled over, his breath hitching as a groan escaped from deep in his throat. He managed to prop himself up from the floor with his one clean hand, the other still cupped in his trousers.
“That’s it,” he mumbled, running his fingers through the Spaniard's thick, dark hair. “Oh, God, Felipe, yes…”
"But did you liked it?"
Fucked senseless, it wasn't until he felt Sherlock's large, slender hands turning him over that John realized he was still on the kitchen table. Sherlock dropped to his knees as he slid John's cock into his mouth. John groaned as he leaned against the table, burying both his hands in Sherlock's curls, forcing him to take in his cock a little further each time until it was touching the back of Sherlock's throat.
John’s heart was beating so fast and his breath had quickened to the point he was worried he might faint. Never in his life had he read such outrageous claims. How was it possible this was published?
They stroked each other's cocks through the fabric of their trousers until John sneakily slid his fingers between cloth and skin. Sherlock responded by biting John's neck, and then possessively bent his lover over the kitchen table.
Sherlock blinked a few times, as if unsure how to respond.
*****
Sherlock felt lips graze his shoulder, and reality hit him like a punch to the stomach. Just as he began to protest and turn, John gasped.
It suddenly dawned on Sherlock that they in fact, did.
“Felipe Ovilo Canales.”
“Is that what worries you?”
“I’ll let you smoke in there if we can do this time and again,” said Wiggins, opening the window.
“Yes, very much.”
“Alright,” he murmured.
“You were the Marquess of Berwick’s valet?” asked Anderson skeptically.
“No, Mr. Dimmock,” said Sherlock weakly. “I think we’ve got it from here.”
Sherlock chuckled. They sat for a moment, listening to the clap of the horses hooves and the squeaking of the carriage’s wheels.
“Hard, you said?” John smirked. He slowly rubbed up and down, feeling the member lengthen under his fingertips. Felipe’s head fell back as he exhaled, giving in to John's deliberate, devilish ministrations.
“Don’t say that to me,” John said, shaking his head. “Don’t.”
“And? What are you getting at?” John snapped. “What do you want me to say?”
Sherlock groaned obscenely. John had never heard him make a noise like that, and he wanted to hear it again. He pressed his tongue back in and kissed and licked deeply, forcing his body to open further. Again Sherlock let out a noise that sounded more animal than human. It did nothing but encourage John to go deeper, to spread him wide.
John nodded but still looked as if he’d rather be anywhere else. The door to the carriage swung open, and Sherlock gave him an encouraging look as he stepped out onto the grounds. John took a deep breath and followed, holding his medical bag and hat in front of him as if some sort of protection. He followed Sherlock as they made their way up the drive. He looked around timidly and spotted Dimmock, Molly and Anderson. Molly smiled at him. John nodded to her gratefully and smiled back.
