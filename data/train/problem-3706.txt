"You better," Emma says, arms finally unfolding and hugging him back just as he moves to go. When he does disentangle, Emma pushes past him to the door. "I'm still mad at you."
There's a pause where they both watch the steam from Jody's coffee, before Jody speaks. "Your dad never told me. I figured whatever you are, it can't be that bad if he'd leave you with me."
She leaves a note. She doesn't want Jody thinking something happened to her again, but she knows Jody would stop her if she tried to say goodbye in person.
"I'm also single, low income, in a high risk career, have no savings to speak of and no family support," Cas responds. His voice is tight with anger and helplessness. "Naomi and Crowley will be seen as a more stable environment, and I have no more claim to them as their uncle than she has as their aunt."
She doesn't get a chance to confirm her identity or explain what the hell she's doing here before the ruckus attracts some of Purgatory's natural residents. Dean tries to put Emma behind him, between the three of them where they can protect her, but she ducks out from under his arm and joins the fight with enough fluid competence that Dean finds himself thinking dark thoughts about Jody Mills. His kid couldn't fight like that when he left, and no one learns to fight like that without fighting for their lives at least a few times. Rough and opportunistic and holding nothing back for reserves.
" Dean says dangerously. He's met Naomi a grand total of three times before now, and each was unpleasant enough to make him dislike her. But this is seriously testing his ethics regarding hitting women. If this was his house she'd have been bodily ejected from the front door by now.
"Okay, so food. What are we thinking?" Dean asks. "Buffet? Might be easier and cheaper than a sitdown."
Emma must look like a kidnap victim. Which Dean supposes she kind of is. She's wearing one of Dean's shirts and a pair of jogging pants Dean used his limited sewing skills on so that they'd stay up. He doesn't know how they'd have handled things after she hit five if Dean hadn't kept spare clothes in the car. He'd skipped town without getting his stuff from the motel room he and Sam had been staying at. Her hair has grown without interference and looks like it's never seen a hairbrush (it hasn't). She has no shoes and her terrified face looks white and gaunt in the dim lighting from the motel's ancient ceiling light and the sunlight leaking in around the drawn curtains.
Being topside again is no less strange than the first time he came back from an extended period of being dead. Even weirder is watching Emma and Cas dance around each other, both equally cautious and curious. Benny thinks it's hilarious, as he lets be known loudly and happily once returned to his body.
Sam shakes his head. "Never." He looks at Dean far too seriously for a drunk man surrounded by the strains of the Ghostbusters theme song. "Hey, um, when you get a minute after... everything. There's something I need to talk to you about."
"No," Dean says with as much finality as he can muster. "I'm not puttin' you in harms way. You stay with Jody and you go to school, just like you kept naggin' me about, and you stay out of trouble. We'll be back when it's done."
"I know he doesn't want me around. And that's why we left Benny, isn't it? 'Cause Uncle Sam wouldn't like it?" Emma continues. "And Cas. He's not human either and he doesn't stay."
Dean digs around ineffectually for a good few minutes before his fingers wrap around the coat. It's the one thing that's consistently in every car they use these days, folded neatly in the trunk, or sometime in the backseat if there's no room among all the gear. Sam hasn't mentioned it, if he's even noticed. He's got a lot on his mind. They both have.
"He's a big boy, I'm sure he can take care of himself," Dean says, though honestly he wonders the same thing. Cas isn't exactly in peak condition to be fighting off the armies of Heaven if things go south.
The sudden pounding at the door throws those plans straight out of the window. Dean has a gun in his hand and his daughter behind him before the third knock.
"Well? What'd he say? You gonna break the spell?" Dean says accusingly. "You gonna make it all go away so we can pretend that we're just super good buddies?"
"You could say that," Emma says. She comes from a family of hunters after all. And for some reason she doesn't want to tell Jody about murdering two dozen Amazons in their sleep. Sometimes she thinks she can still smell the smoke in her hair.
"I'll take Claire to the store tomorrow for buffet food if you write out a list," Cas says when they've well and truly determined that they've done all they can tonight.
Which is what makes it very awkward when she comes running at them through the trees shouting 'Dad' at the top of her lungs.
Dean wakes up nearly a full two hours before his alarm. He didn't drink enough for a drunken slumber, and once he's awake that's it. There's no chance he's getting back to sleep, not today.
Dean wants to tell him it's okay, that he had the best intentions, but Dean of all people knows that isn't good enough. This is Cas's mess, and he has to deal with it, no matter what his intentions were. No matter that Dean wants him here. Needs him. "Yeah, well. We'll always have you. Don't be a stranger."
With that he leaves his asshole brother to it. Dean doesn't want to fight with him anymore, and that's all they'll do if he stays, so he decides now is as good a time as any to go find a quiet place to call Jody. She'll know a hell of a lot more about what Emma's been up to the last few months than Sam does.
One of the weirder parts of being an Amazon is the clarity of her memories from pretty much the moment of birth. She doesn't know these women, doesn't know their faces or voices, but she does know who they are. She remembers her mother telling her about them. She never told Dad she remembers him stabbing her mom to death. He'd only get that dumb sad look on his face that he always got when he was thinking about what a terrible parent he was, and knowing what she'd have been raised to do if he hadn't, Emma can't find it in her to blame him. He took her away from that and he raised her like any other kid. Or as close to as was possible.
Dean frowns. "It's not a problem, Cas. You know that. You'd do the same for me. Hell, the stuff you've done for me over the years, I'm barely holding my own in this whole thing."
He's so close. All he has to do is finish these vows, accept a few congratulations, and then he's married to the guy he's now realised is the freaking love of his life. They can figure out the rest later. "-In sickness and in health, to-"
"Dean, wait!" Castiel says, grasping hold of his wrist as he stands. "Sam, I need you to explain this to me. The witches thought Dean wanted to be in a relationship with me..."
Sam's eyes dart between them like he's watching an invisible fencing match, waiting to see who takes a hit, who backs down.
, this is real. How I feel is real. I remember feeling like this every day for five goddamn years! Like hell is that from some stupid spell!"
"Oh?" Dean asks. He feels like his chest is splitting in two. It's hard to take a breath. If she's initiated, if she's killing people-
The coat is neatly folded in the backseat before he even exits the car, heaving into the bushes lining the quiet road where he'd parked.
Besides, Dean was driving highways at younger than... well, not younger than a year old. But younger than she is physically and legally.
Castiel’s face shifts into a frown and he comes at Dean with the same ferocious, steely authority he had levelled at Azrael. “I can conceal myself so that the angels cannot track me, yes, but every angel in existence knows my face, and as Bobby rightly said, my wings are rather conspicuous. I cannot move about without drawing attention from angels and humans alike. You, on the other hand, benefit from a certain amount of anonymity.
Cas enters with an awkward smile, carrying a pile of folded clothing. “As promised, I washed everything I wore,” he says as he places the pile neatly on the end of Dean’s bed.
More so than his father ever did, Bobby just wanted him and Sam to be happy and healthy.  He loved them pretty much unconditionally, And Bobby, though he was always too gruff to really show it or admit it, loved Cas too. If anything by proxy, he loved Cas because Dean…
His jailers deposit Castiel with a forceful disdain onto the cold, hard floor. He is not bound or in any way restrained, though why should he need to be here? What hope could he possibly have of any kind of retaliation?
He brings his knees to his chest and sits there in a ball for a minute. He knows what he should do but he really doesn’t think he can go and do it. Eventually, the build-up gets the best of him and he’s careening off for the showers. In there he tries so desperately to keep his head clear as he gets it out of his system, but the picture of Cas over him, the memory of the sensation of his body so close, he can’t shake it. And Cas’ name is on his lips as he finishes in his hand, all other rational thought gone in place of a wave of pleasure piercing though him.
“Doesn’t it seem kind of odd?” Sam says, leaning over the table like he’s on a hot piece of gossip. “I mean, that nobody showed up to- I don’t know, to make demands or try and make their point? They just sent Dean here, then nothing.”
“Dean, if you can- if you can hear me, which, I know you can’t; I changed my mind. It’s not enough to say it. I- I want to…” he trails off, even here still struggling to indulge in the act of wanting.
“My apologies,” Cas says, eyes shifting downwards as the embarrassment catches up with him. Probably serves him right for playing dirty.
Cas spends the night in the room he had once called his own. He’s surprised at how easily he slips into the same Cas-shaped dips he carved out decades ago. The last night he had spent there had been a few days after Bobby passed.
“You stayed all night,” Dean says, pushing himself up to look at Cas as he speaks. “Didn’t you get bored?”
Dean pockets the feather in his satchel then plops onto the cool grass. “Sit. I brought lunch with me. I know you don’t eat, but I brought some berries ‘cause I noticed you seemed to like them.”
Castiel takes it in both hands and holds is there in front of him. He runs a hand over its cover, its spine, already broken in, it’s pages worn and frayed and yellowed at the edges. It’s well-loved and many times read. He presses it into his chest. “Nobody’s ever given me a gift before,” Castiel confesses, suppressing a smile. “Thank you.”
Sam lets out a motorboat sigh and stretches his long arms way up. “Yeah,” he says through a yawn. “I think you’re probably right.” He gets up and starts gathering up empty glasses. “Thanks Jody.”
Castiel tugs at Dean’s collar in a familiar move as he drags him out into the open one again. “Second only to the butterfly that landed on my left wing this morning.” Castiel lets go of Dean’s collar and levels a stern look in his direction that burrows into Dean like an arrow. “How many times do you intend to do the exact same thing and expect different results?”
Jo raises her eyes to Dean and passes him a pitying, if judgemental,  look. “No, he said we have some time while they settle in. I also asked Garth if he had any headache tonic. He did. It’s on the floor to your right.”
There’s a rustle in the brush, one that doesn’t quite match the pattern and direction of the wind— Castiel didn’t have to wonder long it seems. All his wonder fades into disbelief that any man would be
“Yeah, it’s only my travel set,” Jo comments, flippant. “I got way more at home, but they were too nice to take with me. Couldn’t risk someone at camp stealing ‘em.”
The guy’s just so preciously naïve it forces a laugh out of Dean. He claps a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Cas, buddy, we’re brothers. This is just how we communicate.”
“God, you looked good though,” he breathes. Cas frowns and Dean clears his throat. “Just- I mean when you took that one from behind, you looked cool as hell, man. I mean, you’ve always been able to hold your own in a fight, don’t get me wrong, but the holy tax accountant look was never really all that threatening.”
But not this one night, with Jack in the expert care of Carol, Dean and Cas’s lovely, if not over-enthusiastic neighbour-to-the-right. Finally, they had a night to themselves, and while a night in was certainly the most appealing option as far as Dean was concerned, Cas had insisted on going out.
“No, Dean. I could have— I could have tried to resolve the situation. I could have confessed to what I did sooner, absolved you of any crime. Then maybe— maybe they’d only want me.”
Efram remains tight-lipped. Cas nods, and after a moment, he lunges at Efram and gets a good slice in on his arm. Efram curls into the wound, hand grasping at his injured arm, blood spilling over his fingers.
Sam pauses, then chooses violence. “Yeah, have you noticed you always wear the same shirts Cas does, like, right after he wears them?”
Some of them are old, the edges of the paper frayed and worn, the white paper yellowed. Some of the oldest are all written in the same handwriting. Whoever wrote them has beautiful handwriting, they’re signed ‘Dad’. Castiel skims through them, they’re autobiographical mostly, detailed accounts of what the boys’ father had been doing. They usually end with some kind of warning or instruction, often along the lines of ‘don’t cause any trouble’ or ‘look out for your brother’.
Dean beams with pride. He’s totally winning ally-of-the-year for being totally on-the-level. He’s also a teensy bit wobbly. “Can we go? These drinks are like… fifteen dollars.”
“Get used to it,” Eileen says, smug. “I was just asking if I could tease you or if you’d freak out.”
“That doesn’t matter,” Cas stresses. “You shouldn’t be afraid to buy a fruity cocktail, or be close to a friend, or anything, just because of how some people
“Yeah, uh,” Dean clears his throat, and tries to push the words out through his dry mouth. “Me and- me and Cas- Cas and I are… romantically entangled.” Dean winces at his own clunky wording.
“C’mon Cas, siddown,” Dean says, pulling a seat out beside him. Sam and Bobby eye him, faces neutral. Neutrality is certainly not a rejection, but it’s not an invitation either.
Sam’s head pushes forward and his face screws up, eyes searching the room for what the hell he’s missing. “You got caught by an angel sneaking around outside the citadel… and you’re here telling me about it?”
“I— I don’t know anything about any angel tablet,” Efram says through gritted teeth as blood slowly pools around him.
“I believe the court has seen enough,” Naomi says, savouring her victory if her smug expression is anything to go by. “To the charge of indecent fraternisation with a human, in the view in indisputable evidence, this court finds you guilty. As for you sentence…”
Castiel follows Dean’s movement, then follows through even further, straddling Dean’s lap to get in even closer. Dean’s hands work their way into Castiel’s hair and there’s an exchange of tongues as the kiss deepens. Dean is overcome with warmth as Castiel’s wings spread around them, enveloping the two of them like a shield from both their worlds.
“You know Lucifer came back from the cage and he didn’t bring me back either? So rude. I really know how to pick ‘em huh?” Meg said, shaking her head in resignation
Meg’s face had contorted into a shocked confusion. “Okay, I changed my mind. Give me the short version.”
Sam doesn’t hesitate to start rifling through what knives— mostly trade tools like gardening equipment— they have. Dean pockets his dad’s hunting knife and leans down to drag Castiel to his feet.
It’s a dynamic shift for sure. After so long spent with Dean looking after Sam, now Sam’s the one taking care of him. It’s a good feeling, just to have the freedom to fall down every now and again, knowing that there’s someone there to pick him back up.
“That’s-” Cas begins. He sighs. “There are a lot of reasons, I imagine. I would say it has a fair bit to do with how someone is raised.”
Cas licks his lips. He supposed he hasn’t been very subtle. With the veritable storm of panic and emotion bubbling and burning under his skin, it might be fortuitous to let some of it out by confiding in someone. “It’s— it’s Dean.”
Dean and Castiel both startle as Sam interjects. Dean had almost forgotten his brother was there. He clears his throat. “Yeah it’s a favourite of both of us,” he says, eyes darting over to Sam, who’s brows are raised in his signature judgement and disbelief combo.
It’s been a few days since Dean’s last visit. He’s worked his way through five books total now, and Dean has apparently been taking mental notes on Castiel’s response. The last book he’d read was, according to Dean, ‘not really his thing’, but he was right in thinking that Castiel might like it. It was about a prince who fell for a commoner, and who tried to run away with her to live a simple life. It was, as Dean had put it, ‘sappy and lame’, but Castiel found it sweet. He couldn’t quite put his finger on why, but he liked it a lot.
Finally Bobby looks upon the mess of angel before him. “And what about you?” he asks, an accusing tone present somewhere in his voice. “You escape? Are more angels coming for you?”
“I know, I know.” Rachel shrugs, shrinking somewhat from her earlier excitement. “I’m still working up to it, but if I see him again I swear I will.”
Cas looked over at Dean with a pained expression. That was the last time he deferred the decision making to Dean.
“Why would you come back here?” Castiel snaps, an uncharacteristic impoliteness born of a shock and frustration.
The beer doesn’t really help. It’s to be expected; one beer can’t really do much to a regular person, let alone someone who’s conditioned themselves with over two decades of binge drinking. But there was only one in the fridge. There’s whiskey around somewhere. Maybe. But there’s also a good chance Dean already drank it and then forgot.
to take notes of course. That would be ridiculous. Eventually as the day drifts by into night and the air takes on a chill, Dean takes his leave. Dean seems saddened by their parting, and though Castiel is very possibly reading that wrong, he chooses to believe it to be the case. At least then the feeling’s mutual.
“I dragged you back in, didn’t I?” Dean continues. “Before I got zapped here I- I was thinking about going to Stanford to get you. I did it, didn’t I? I took you away from your normal life and brought you back in and I ruined your life. I don’t get it, how are you so zen about all of this, saying all this crap about helping people. All your life, you wanted out. The whole time. It’s my fault you’re back in it so why don’t you hate me?”
“Okay fine,” Dean sighed. Jack immediately cheered and jumped down onto the floor. “Hey, hold on there, kid,” Dean stopped Jack in his tracks as he headed for the door. “You can
lives? Standing at that damn gate,” Castiel says, flat. It elicits a snort of laughter from Sam, and it’s nice to see on a day like today. Castiel brings his hand back to Sam’s forehead. “I’d just like to examine you, if that’s alright?” Sam nods and so Castiel proceeds.
“I’m not getting on your case, man,” Sam says, raising his hands up in a gesture of truce. “I thought it was sweet.”
“Just one, he’s four.” Dean grinned proudly, his earlier reservations melting away as the joy he felt at the opportunity to talk about his family took over. “My brother’s bringing him over tomorrow once we’ve settled in.”
“You’re right. Yes, my contact is an angel,” Cas says. “Beyond that— it’s complicated and it’s easier for all of us if we leave it at that. Is that alright?”
Cas is breathing a little heavy - taking out a nest is pretty strenuous work and he hasn’t exerted himself like this since turning human. His brows are furrowed as he drops his arm down to his side, blade slick with blood that slides down its edge and drips down onto the grimy floor. “Do I?” he asks, incredulous, between heavy breaths.
Dean blinks at such sincerity, delivered with such exasperation. “Cas, what are you talking about you’re-” His lips start to form another syllable, but all that comes out is air. There’s a million different ways that sentence could end. Cas is amazing, he’s badass, he’s the only person outside Sam that Dean trusts. He’s funny (in his own way), he’s caring, he’s beautiful, he’s ethereal, he’s everything, he’s
Dean chuckled before pulling Cas’s face toward his. Cas pushed his lips against Dean’s, hands gripping Dean’s shirt tight. He broke the kiss only to say,
“I think you need a key,” a gravelly voice sounds off from behind, low and quiet right by Dean’s left ear.
The walk back from the edge of the angels’ citadel is long. The sun, which had only begun to set as Dean turned tail, has now dipped wholly over the horizon, leaving the world entrenched in darkness under a star speckled night sky.
Cas takes the book in both hands and stares at it, eyes wide and glistening. His lips are parted in a slight gape. Then there’s a splash on the cover, as an honest-to-god tear drops onto the cover. “Why—” Cas’ voice breaks as he starts. “Why did you get this?” His question comes across as urgent, making Dean tense up in panicked confusion.
Dean surveys the area from where he’s standing, but there’s nothing but Castiel off in the distance, standing by the wall. He almost takes that step despite himself until— matte black wings. There’s no iridescence to them, only a flat colour, absorbing all the sun’s light and offering nothing back. From this distance Dean cannot make out facial features, but he knows; that is not Castiel.
Dean’s chest tightens. He hates sentences that start like that, especially when they come from someone like Cas. “What?”
Cas purses his lips as he ponders the proposal. “Yes, theoretically that could work,” he says. “Although borrowing power from one’s past is a dangerous thing to do. If we take it from the wrong moment we could seriously disrupt my own past.”
The days pass in a way that is uncomfortably ordinary. Dean goes about his daily business as usual, with the exception of carrying a weight in his heart. Sam, good kid that he is, starts picking up some more slack; doing grocery runs, making dinner, even taking a couple of jobs off Dean’s hands. It’s all part of his easing back into regular life, it just so happens to be really well timed with exactly what Dean needs.
“Don’t start.” Dean waves a hand in dismissal before Sam gets the chance. Not that it deters him any.
The sun begins to set around 7:30. This is the gang’s signal to begin final preparation. There’s a barn out back where they intend to lure the angel, where the four of them are laying traps and wards. The angel warding is light so as to avoid deterring the angel, but enough to prevent them from communication with any others while they’re inside the barn.
Victor speaks up again, “Well we gotta find out if the thing exists, so we’re gunna go right from the source.”
In just a moment, Efram breaks and lunges for Cas, but Cas is ready, and turns Efram’s momentum against him. He manages to relieve Efram of his blade, and throws the spare outside the circle. In the scuffle, Efram’s scrabbles have left Castiel with a bloodied lip, but he’s otherwise unscathed.
Dean leaves him there to help Jo load up outside. “About time you moved your ass,” she remarks with a grunt as she lifts a heavy bag up onto the back of the cart.
Dean stumbles back a step, breath catching as he stares back at the angel. He may not surpass Dean in height, yet Dean is looking up at him and he is massive, a force of nature. By contrast Dean is tiny, powerless. Whatever fortitude his desperation and devotion to his brother had afforded him fades into fear.
Cas chuckled slightly at the suggestion; it’s the type of wishful thinking Cas had learned to disregard a long time ago.
Dean clenches his jaw for a moment. “Hmm,” he hums. “Yeah, I kinda forgot how much of a mess I used to be.”
Cas shakes his head. “When you say it like that you make it seem like sex between two men is somehow different to sex between a man and a woman,” he explains.
. You know, because if Sam already thinks they’re fucking, then it wouldn’t matter if they were— they could and it totally wouldn’t matter.
“Honestly?” Sam starts, looking at Dean, exasperated. “You two are so goddamn weird, I just didn’t wanna fucking ask.” Dean’s face in contorted into an affronted rage.
“I’m already damned,” Castiel says with a defeated shrug. Dean’s face shifts into a smile and he starts to chuckle. Without any of his usual control, Castiel too begins to snicker. They’re both ridiculous, he supposes.
Dean’s lips spread into a smile as he fights back a laugh. Like this, even as Dean looks up at Castiel, an angel, almighty and all-powerful, he seems so human and so small. “Jeez, I mean, don’t they let you have books or something?”
junk. He slips past the coarse hair and parts the lips with his forefingers, tracing along the contours of skin, trying to visualize based on feel. He's a little bit wet, but not that much. He finds his clit easily. He doesn't know why it's such a big thing, men not being able to find it—it's literally right there, kind of hard to miss, unless you're a fucking idiot. Touching it doesn't feel good immediately. Just kind of weird.
"It wasn't his fault," Dean says, and he feels her mounting a protest without even looking. He doesn't need to explain it to her, explain that he could feel his bones cracking under Castiel's fist, that he knew with certainty in that moment that those words would be the last he ever said to Cas if he didn't stop. It would just make it sound worse. He hadn't even told Sam what Cas did, not all of it. And Dean's mad at him, but he's not trying to make Cas sound like one of the monsters they hunt. That's not the point. The point is that the other angels are
It's Dean's turn to look at her like she's stupid. Of course he wants the fucking truth. "You're not gonna hurt my feelings."
He groans, rolling over onto his back. He's sore deep in his guts, and it's not just the Jack still working its way through his system. His chest hurts, shooting pains that he winces away from, and he thinks maybe he hit the ground harder than he thought he did fighting off that witch with Sam the day before.
"No, that's not—" Cas says, and Dean looks up, startled. "You don't understand. Of course you don't, because I didn't… I didn't explain myself. I'm sorry."
He doesn't flinch at the sting. One drop and it's over, just as she said. Then Rowena directs them all to sit in a crescent on the floor at key spots on the chalk drawing, and to hold hands. Jack sits between Sam and Dean, and he looks to each of them in turn with an anxious smile. Dean squeezes his hand once, trying to return it.
"Hey," Dean says, his voice rough and cracking. He shifts again, tightening his arm around Cas's midsection and hugging him closer.
Boromir's gone still, his face slack. Aragorn cradles him and lays a solemn kiss on Boromir's brow. Dean wipes his eyes, covering up the wet sound of his sniffling by opening another beer and knocking it back.
"It's… good," Cas says, and her hand stills on her hair, like she's only just realized what she was doing.
me, and I wish everyone would stop fucking trying to. Everyone's always so careful, all the time, all this sneaking around. At least when I'm pissing you off you say what you're really thinking."
Dean's mouth crushes itself to his. Cas grabs the back of Dean's neck, fingers through the short hairs at the base of his skull, and Dean tilts back into them, lips parting on a sigh. The duffel bag drops from Cas's shoulder heavily. Dean's grip on his coat slackens, and then Dean's hands are snaking under the lapels to ruck it off, down over his arms and falling in a heap to the ground, half on top of the bag.
He curls up on his side, holding himself, heaving soundlessly, letting his makeup run. The pillowcase is already a lost cause. He doesn't know what to do. He needs someone to tell him what to do, but there's no one. No Dad to tell him he needs to get up for Sam's sake, no Lisa to tell him he needs to get up for Ben's. No Mom to hold him and tell him angels are watching him.
Something in Castiel rattles loose. He has tried to keep it tethered, but it wails within him now, a powerful hunger of his own, with claws and gnashing teeth. Cas feels unworthy of this, undeserving, but he
Provided he manages not to screw this up again. His head spins at the thought of more mornings like this, letting himself be held by Cas, his best friend, who looks at him like the sun shines out of his ass. He wonders how the hell they got here, and that question wars with another in his mind: how the hell have they not been doing this for years? Dean knows how, of course, but now that he's got it, he doesn't want to give it up again. He feels like an idiot for not getting here sooner.
"Lucifer is gone," Sam says, bent to one knee. Dean hates the way Sam sounds as he says it, like he's a child again, in need of protection that Dean isn't big enough or strong enough to give him. The very thought of Lucifer reverts Sam to a smaller version of himself, and he doesn't even have to be in the same room to do it. He doesn't even have to be on the same damn plane of existence. "He's trapped. He can't get to you here."
Sam's eyes trail them as they leave the room. "I don't know if I should go over there to rescue him or not."
could see them. Icy cold panic lights up his nerves, killing all the giddy excitement of the minutes before. Someone
There's a musty smell, the air thick with dust and humidity. Everything feels thick. Dean's tongue is thick in his mouth, and his clothes stick to his back, his skin tacky with sweat and grime.
Dean looks down at Castiel's socked feet on the tile, because it's easier than looking him in the eye.
, got her just as I hit the deck. Didn't think she'd done anything worse than knock me on my ass until the next day."
"I'm glad for her," Castiel says. "I don't mourn the relationship, if that's what you mean. But Daphne was kind to me when I was alone in the world. She didn't have to be."
It's not that it isn't good. He knows it's good, has figured out himself how to make it good, and by all definitions, he should be tipping overboard by now. But he's not. He's hitting that same frustrating wave of diminishing returns, and all the low and pulsing want he'd been feeling recedes.
That startles Dean into a weak smile. More than anything, he's just relieved Sam is giving him an out not to explain himself, because he doesn't know that he could if he tried. It's all such a stupid, tangled mess in his head.
"I gotta make some calls, then," Bobby says, tossing his notepad to the desk and knocking a jar of pens askew. "Cause I've got no goddamn clue."
"How am I winning in this scenario?" Dean grouses. He doesn't care that they're third cousins twice removed or whatever the hell, he's not gonna start singing "Closer to Fine" on Gwen's command just so she can get drunk. (He'll take the fact that he actually enjoys some of the crap on Sam's iPod to his grave, whenever he ends up back in it again.)
Dean's eyes stay closed, but his hand grasps out and finds Cas's leg. Obliging, he sits on the edge of the bed. Dean drifts closer with the dip of the mattress beneath him.
Dean glances back, holding in a laugh. He's pretty sure he's used that line on a girl before. Never expected to hear it from this end.
Dean's head drops between his knees, his hands grasping the back of his neck. His ears are buzzing. "Great. Awesome. I'm just gonna go fuckin'. Jump into a lake or something, then."
Dean grips Cas by the hips, tugging him closer, until he's seated in Dean's lap. Dean has his shirt in two fistfuls, and he tugs until he can slide his hands up, over Castiel's ribs, across his back. Cas gasps, melting against him, only mostly managing to kiss his mouth.
Jack's face shifts into a hopeful smile, which he tamps down into something contrite. "I'm sorry about the kitchen."
Dean and Sam eat a gas station burrito and a gas station granola cup, respectively, and wait while Castiel selects a new uniform, which turns out to be pretty close to her old standard: sensible slacks and a blazer, sensible shoes, a white button-up, presumably some underwear more suited to this century, and a beige coat to complete the ensemble. For all that she's Heaven's little rebel, Cas really is a creature of habit. She comes out of the store with an overfull bag, still wearing Dean's overlarge shirt, apparently perfectly content to head all the way home before giving Dean his damn pants back.
He loads up a tray with whatever's quickest. None of it looks that good to him at the moment, honestly, but he can't have Sam giving him any more Concerned Sam™ looks. Yogurt cups, a few dinged-up bananas and oranges, a single-serving box of Apple Jacks, a muffin, and two coffees. He can probably choke at least one of those things down.
He's been thinking about their dad a lot, these days, about how much Dean hears his voice coming out of his mouth when he talks. Ten years ago he might have said that was a good thing. Now there's Jack, looking at him like Sam used to look at him when they were little, like he was looking for Dean's approval, or his guidance, and he can feel his dad's lessons taking over again:
"I do... check in on you, from time to time, Dean. The fight demands most of my time and attention, but that doesn't mean I don't—" Cas breaks off, head moving in uncertain little tics. "You've been ensorceled. Are you well?"
Sam, cowed, lets out a wobbly sigh. When he looks back down, his expression is grim. "Did Dad know?"
Rowena is starting to look better, now that Dean's actually paying attention. She's taken to sitting in one of the leather chairs in the library while Sam distracts himself with cataloguing everything on the shelves. Right now she's reading through one of the books with a mug of tea beside her. Her hair's grown out a bit more, and she's got enough energy to start looking like a gilded beetle again, her eyelids glittering with powder. She can get around more easily by herself, too, which is both good and bad, because now they really have to make sure they watch her around the books. Sam's started hiding the really dangerous stuff in the basement store room and keeping the door locked.
"I coulda died," she says, talking around her finger before she releases her cheek. "It was infected as hell, but you know hunters, we don't really 'do' doctors… or dentists. Like, I was born in the back of a van and my mom cut the cord herself with a silver knife, you know? That's just how it is."
They do everything short of cutting open the upholstery and taking apart the engine, but there's no sign of a hex bag. Dean swears, kicking the tire, then muttering an apology to the car for it.
"Maybe that's why," Dean says, eagerly seizing on any explanation. "Because we burned his body, so he needed… I mean he had to get one
"You took it out," he says. Cas stills, but doesn't look at him. "You want me to fix it again, or d'you like it better down?"
Sam grabs Jack by the shoulder and guides him out. "We're going, before Dean decides he wants you to try Ding Dongs."
Dean's brain screams, imagining Cas slotting up behind him, fucking him from behind while this guy takes the front. He's seen that in porn before, too, but this is
Cas sets his phone aside when he sees that Dean is awake, rubbing at his eyes with the back of his hand. When he's ready to get up, they share the shower, taking longer than they would if someone were waiting on them outside. Dean spikes up Cas's hair with shampoo, then darts out of the bathroom to grab his phone and snap a picture.
On his way back to the motel he stops at a CVS, sidling past the makeup displays and slipping things into his pockets without lingering long enough to draw attention. He feels like some kind of teen runaway, stealing eyeliner and lipstick from a drugstore, but he can't shake the feeling that someone will yell at him if he brings a handful of makeup to the counter. He might not end up really using any of it, but it's worth trying, right? He stocks up on first aid stuff, 'cause most of his stash ended up in Lisa's medicine cabinet, and pays for that. Everything else he doesn't shake out of his pockets until he's safely back in his motel room. He undresses down to his underwear and lays it all out.
Dean waits until he's alone to call Bobby. That conversation is less one-sided than his prayer to Cas, but he doesn't end it feeling any more assured. He considers calling Jody for half a second—she offered her number, after all—but he doesn't know what she could possibly do about this, and he abandons the idea pretty quickly. He goes to sleep with his hand by his pistol. When he wakes, Sam is already up, with coffee and a muffin, like some unspoken apology. Dean eats it without tasting a bite. He drives, one of Dad's tapes in the deck, fingers slotted into grooves in the steering wheel well-worn by his father, and he hears his father's voice in his ear, his dying words:
"Just stay," he says, barely audible. He rolls back an inch, like he wants Cas to lie down with him. Uncertain, Cas lies down beside him, shoes and all, over the covers. "M'tired."
Cas doesn't speak for such a long time that it startles Dean when he answers. "What do you think I should do?"
) and looks Dean up and down with a sneer, like he's exactly the freak show he feels like. Samuel just frowns, squinting at Dean in mild disapproval.
"You manipulated little girls into bleeding themselves for you," Dean says. "How much teen spirit you got coursin' through your veins right now?"
"All right, so we can go around like this in circles, forever, or we can agree that either we're both assholes, or neither of us are, and say we're even."
He scrubs down as thoroughly as he can while keeping it quick and strictly nonsexual. When he comes out, wiping the steam from the mirror and brushing his teeth, he sees himself a little differently. He's pink and soft, and he's washed all the product out of his hair, which hangs limp against his forehead, his eyelashes clinging wetly together. He spits, rinses out his mouth, and when he's done, his lips are red and swollen. He looks… pretty.
"This is what we do," Dean says. Haleigh looks between the four of them, her hands shaking, looking like she'd have bolted already if they weren't blocking the door. "Now just calm down, and tell us what's going on."
thought about it. Maybe once he's had a chance to prepare a little. "Later. Definitely. Uh, rain check."
"It's not fine, Dean," Cas says, and steps toward him, brow furrowed, reaching out as if she might touch him before she freezes, her arms hovering uselessly at her sides. Her eyes are focused on his with Castiel's typical intensity. It's uncanny, seeing all these familiar gestures play out in an entirely unfamiliar body.
He'd been nine or so, he thinks, cause Dad's still real tall in his memory, and that was the year Sam stopped wanting to hold Dean's hand and follow him around. He remembers that Sam was off chasing a dog around the yard instead of trying to copy everything Dean did like usual. The dog belonged to some old military buddy of their dad's, and the house and the yard must've been his too. The guy had a shooting range out back, and Dean was practicing just like Dad told him to.
Sam doesn't trust Cas. He thinks something's wrong with him. Dean thinks he's right, but he's afraid to say so out loud. He's afraid to bring him up, to say his name. He's afraid to even think about him too hard. He still doesn't know how Cas got out of Purgatory, and he's been acting weird the whole time he's been back. He flits in and out without warning, but he hasn't seen him since Crowley nabbed that Weenie Hut angel. The whole thing left Dean feeling off-kilter. He can't spend every day worrying about Cas, and he feels like Sam would be the first to tell him they can't afford the risk of praying to him, but he'd kind of gotten into the habit. Dean doesn't know what to do if he's not worrying about Cas.
"Jesus, Cas." He grips Castiel's hand tightly where it rests on his shoulder, too overwhelmed to look up and put a face to the bare desperation in his voice. "Why didn't you say something?"
Dean heads for the bathroom himself after finishing off a second fruity little apple drink and is surprised to find the girl still in there, hunched over the sink. He feels weird being in here, like someone's going to catch him and toss him out, but it's not like he can go to the Men's looking like he does. He can hear her sniffling and trying to breathe evenly while he's sitting in the stall. When he comes out to wash his hands, he peers over at her. She's a short little thing, light brown skin, with tight ringlets curling over her trembling shoulders while she tries to keep her hands steady enough to pluck out her contact lenses.
"She's not hurting anyone now," Dean says. "But what if the junior arsonist decides the shrubbery was just practice for the class bully? Shouldn't we, y'know, intervene before she escalates?"
you?" Dean crosses his arms. It's getting easier. It also props his tits up in a way he thinks would have drawn Cas's attention had he been a regular human guy and not a weirdo bird-brained angel guy. "It was a witch, a couple days ago. I'm about to head up to Bobby's to try to figure out how to… you know, fix it."
"I, uh." Dean clears his throat. "Okay, so. I guess you heard most of it, but I kind of wanted to say some of it anyway." He realizes he is very underdressed for this conversation in a t-shirt and boxers, but as long as he keeps the blanket over his lap, maybe he can maintain some of his dignity. "I'm sorry I… I'm always pushing you away and stuff. That isn't… I don't really want that."
"I'm surprised you like these movies so much," Dean says. "I mean. There's only, like, two chicks in 'em. Three," he corrects, remembering Eowyn.
"Don't be. You helped us take down Dick Roman," Dean says, and nudges her knee with his foot. She's stripped out of her leather jerkin and her boots, but she's still wearing the undershirt and leggings from her costume—sorry,
"Dirty little—" Thien pants, sweat beading on his temple. "Making him watch you take some other guy's dick. Begging me for it."
Cas doesn't answer. He doesn't move. He looks like a statue, sitting there in that chair and gazing up at him, carved from marble, like one of the ones about saints seeking mercy or benediction.
Sam's always been the one who knows how to relate to people at their lowest. Mr. Sensitive who doesn't drink too much and make an ass out of himself at bars, who crying girls relax around like he's the physical embodiment of a tub of Chubby Hubby, who takes Women's Studies and eats salads and listens to podcasts about Martin Luther's theses. And it'd be one thing if he were anywhere else but here in the shit with Dean, if he'd gone off to Stanford like he planned and became a bigshot lawyer, working pro bono to defend the rights of innocent puppies or something, but he's not. He's still just Dean's goofy baby brother, too earnest and open-minded, always ready to believe in something Dean never would've thought up on his own.
"It's fine. Whatever, like I'm his keeper?" Dean scrubs a hand over his chin. He forgot to shave again, and his scruff is nearing beard territory. "Yeah," he growls, "I just fucking died, but sure, I'll run off alone to do who knows what without saying anything."
to understand what it's like for someone else. Do you, uh…" Dean backs down off the chair, bare feet shuffling on the grubby carpet. "Masturbate?"
Dean leans down, catching Cas's lips. It's nothing like the first time they kissed. He takes his time, lingering, cataloguing the way Cas molds against him, the way his rough chin scratches at Dean's, the way his voice resonates in his chest when Dean draws a pleased sound from him.
sluts. But people are assholes and society is a prison, so they have to act a certain way in public."
"Pizza's good," Dean protests. Rowena looks at him with all the bedraggled hatred of a cat that fell in a bathtub. Cas comes up from behind him, and taps her on the forehead. In an instant, she's dry, her face clean and bare. She blinks owlishly.
"What, you sure?" Dean raises his eyebrows. "Arwen. Liv Tyler, that's a good distraction if I ever heard one." Sam's mouth twists.
"That's it? Huh." Sam looks at Dean again. Dean can practically see him crunching the numbers in his head. "Well, until then, as a feminist—"
Dean sinks down onto a stool at the kitchen table. "Thing is, I can't narrow it down for you at all, because I dunno if he was talking about Cas, or Bobby, or—or Benny."
"I'm…" Castiel's mouth works silently, trying to form words and falling short. "Just trying to… adjust."
"Yeah, well, he did that anyway," Sam says. Dean's teeth clench, and he breathes out hard through his nose.
This is how the Angel finds him. Its thousand eyes burn with holy fire, its many wings flapping so greatly it nearly sends Dean to his knees. He can't look directly at it. It sears with pain when he tries, pain he didn't know he had the capability to feel any longer. God help him, it
"Jack," Castiel says by way of greeting. Her smile isn't as easy as it was at their first meeting, and Dean tries not to feel like a dick about that too.
Dean holds his hand in front of his eyes, wincing away from her. His head shakes, not as an answer, but as a question. The motion makes him heave, his stomach turning. Cas sits, grasping his head in her hands, and cooling energy melts into his temples, rushing over and through him, like drinking a cold glass of water. He instantly feels better, more clear-headed. He's also pissed. He yanks himself away, her hands falling from his face.
Mary is quiet. Sam is gentle when he asks how she knew Wally, what he was like in life, but she just sniffs and shakes her head. Her fingernails still have ash underneath, though he knows she washed them the first chance she got. There's still a rusty streak of Castiel's blood in her hair. None of them are surprised when she excuses herself early, presumably to shower and then lie awake, unable to sleep anyway. After so much time on Earth, this, at least, Castiel understands.
"I just wanna focus on you," he says quietly, coming back to kiss her again. She hums into his mouth, acquiescent. That's good. Now that he's this far undressed, he sort of doesn't want to go further. Maybe it's stupid, but they're pretty, these new clothes of his, and somehow they make him prettier just by being on him. He sort of needs that right now. He's not interested in thinking about why. It's much simpler to just lean his head back, tugging Mina's hips up until she's straddling his chin.
at it. He needs some new clothes. Just a couple things. Bobby was joking about him getting a bra, but Dean's fed up with free-boobing it. They're heavy and sore and they move around too much when he walks, and if a bra's gonna help that, then god damn it, he'll get a bra. And if it makes his tits look nice, he might as well just fucking lean into it. Go big or go home, right?
"I mean, I don't really, but this is a cool freaking car," she says. Dean comes around the front, sliding in next to her and starting up the engine. Mina startles next to him, laughing nervously. "Haha, and
"Cas," Dean says. It feels good to say it, feels good to have his eyes on him, looking at him hungrily, good to have him tucked up under Dean's arm. Castiel winds his arms around Dean's neck, leaning in to press his nose to Dean's cheek, letting his lips brush Dean's jaw.
"It's… good. Thank you." Cas shrugs out of the towel, then flicks his hands. In a blink, all the hair clippings have vanished.
bit of blood. If she'd drained herself dry, it might have been a real dark magic power boost, but on its own, it wouldn't do much.
Something in Castiel's expression shutters. Dean waits for him to respond, but he doesn't. He just watches Dean, maybe imagining that Dean will think better of it and apologize, or say something to make it better. But that's not the kind of man Dean is. Better Cas finally realizes it, even if it is years too late. Dean's always going to disappoint him. That's what he does best.
Dean makes another frustrated sound. He's hidden his face in Cas's neck. Cas can feel Dean's heartbeat where he's pressed against him. He wants to hold it in his hands, and settles for resting his hand between Dean's shoulder blades. "I want—" Dean cuts himself off, and paints over the broken sentence by pressing his mouth to Cas's pulse. His hand nudges Cas's zipper down to cup him through his boxers. He's not quite hard, the touch tentative and exploratory. Dean's voice, when he finds it again, is a rasp. Nearly a whisper. "Want you to mess me up, Cas."
If Dean had kissed him like this in the mausoleum he wouldn't have cared if Sam or Eileen or the cops or God or Death herself were watching. Dean sighs again, shoulders shaking with it, when their bodies slot against each other, "Fuck,
red. Not Blood Red, or even Apple Red— it's more like Sexy Devil Halloween Costume Red. When he's all done, looking at himself in the mirror, he thinks he's just one smear of glitter short of looking like a stripper. In Dean's opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with looking like a stripper. He loves strippers. He's met some very loveable strippers. But it's not exactly the mood he's hoping to strike when visiting Bobby. He smears the lipstick off on a scrap of toilet paper. It leaves a little residue behind, but not too much. That's actually a lot better. Yeah, he likes that.
"Okay, then you'll just keep doing this. Whatever this is," Sam says, gesturing at the two of them, awake before dawn, talking in circles in the kitchen. "Until Cas finally leaves for good. Cause that's working out so great for you."
Dean paints on a smile. "Oh, that's real kind of you, ma'am. You know, we do our best to stay healthy. Just clean living and, uh, godliness."
Cas lets his thumb slip from Dean's mouth when he looks ready to take more of his cock, but Dean surprises him, ducking his head to the tightening skin of his balls and sucking one into his mouth, then the other. His cock slots up against the side of Dean's nose and over his brow, and Dean grips it while his mouth works Cas over, practically nuzzling him. Then he's aiming Cas back where he wants him, mouthing the head and running his tongue along the leaking slit.
"Your boyfriend left pretty quick, huh?" Thien's still out of breath, but he heaves himself up to throw the condom out. Dean feels a hand on his hip, not tender, not cruel, just a bracing point of contact. "You good? You ever did that before?"
Dean shuts his mouth. Cas looks at the ceiling, eyes darting back and forth like he's trying to read through the script of his own memories.
"If I'm rushing this— I mean, I was having the worst fucking day, and then this cute butch comes to my rescue, and I just thought…"
Happy Birthday, Dean Winchester! For your birthday I got you this chapter! What's in it? Oh, uh, well, yikes.
The moment the door clicks shut behind him, Dean's fists are in the lapels of his coat. He goes where Dean bids, back pressed to the wood paneled wall. Here it comes. The wave of Dean's anger, his worry, his fear, cresting—
He's a little nervous, walking Mina outside. He likes to show Baby off, but Mina's already shown how few shits she gives about cars. It makes him relish the little look of surprise that rounds Mina's eyes when she sees her.
"Did you guys have another fight?" Sam's using the same voice he uses to talk to scared animals and little kids, which is about the limit of what Dean can handle from this conversation. Dean pulls out his phone, tries to ignore that his most recent recieved text is that photo of Jack grinning and Cas making that dumb little frowny face, and starts typing something to Cas before he can think better of it.
"Aw, what the—" Dean, with a determined set to his jaw, tosses the next ball twice as hard. It knocks the top bottle off, but none of the others. The third ball smacks a bottle on the base hard enough to nudge it an inch, but the pyramid stays standing.
"Don't think you can bribe me with all-you-can-eat waffles, either." Dean mills around the room, peeking into what he hopes is a mini-bar, but is actually just an empty mini-fridge. He slaps the door shut with an irritated noise.
This ride is much gentler than the others, the shouts and laughter of the fair's guests growing more distant the higher they rise. Dean's gazing out at the grounds, sitting across from him in the car rather than next to him. Cas mourns the loss of contact, but their knees touch when Dean grows careless, and Cas can't argue with the view. In the growing dark, the lights of the fair spreading out below them glitter in Dean's eyes like a cluster of stars. He looks impossibly beautiful.
, slid it up over her arms, but every time Dean manages to get all the hooks in place he feels like he's getting strangled, and the twisting and turning only makes it worse. Eventually he sorts out that the numbers have something to do with the band size, and he needs to go for the higher numbers, but then he's got issues with the goddamn straps falling off or digging in too hard, and then the cups are all wrong and he has to start all over again.
"Good morning, sunshine," Dean says. He lifts the slice of toast to his mouth and bites. Savory yolk spills over his lip and down his chin, clinging there. His tongue darts out to swipe it away.
Heart in his throat, he even tries getting a hold of Cas. "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray Castiel will pick up the damn phone," he says quietly. His hands make loud rustling noises on top of the blankets in the dark room. "It's just you and me, buddy, if you're listening up there. Or wherever you are. You there, Cas, or are you too busy shanking halos? Cas? Castiel?"
Rowena's eyes slide open, ringed in electric violet. Her chanting grows urgent. She reaches out, snatching Sam's hand, then Dean's, her grip firm and relentless. Dean keeps his eyes on Cas, willing him to make it through this, to come out the other side in one piece. It's a little like praying, so he does that too, silent but insistent:
gay, because it's not like he was faking it with all those girls, he's just got, you know, some exceptions. Benny's not gay either, he had a girl he was with before he got turned. He had a
Cas looks at Dean. He must really want to go on the ferris wheel, if he's lying like this about it. That was one of the first things he taught Cas, after all. Cas says, "Let's go."
Bobby spends the afternoon ringing up some of his contacts while Dean tries to repay him by doing some of the chores he knows Bobby's not great at keeping on top of. Bobby holds his hand over the phone while Dean sweeps the floor, muttering, "You don't gotta do that, boy," to which Dean responds, "Shut up, old man," and Bobby smothers a smile in response while Dean keeps doing it. When they were kids, Bobby used to bark at them that this wasn't a motel and he wasn't housekeeping when they turned the guest room they stayed in into a sty. Now, when Dean tries to help him keep things clean, he acts embarrassed, like it's none of Dean's business how he keeps his home.
"No—" Dean starts, then coughs again, but he's shaking his head. His voice is rough and abused, but he's got a pleased tilt to his smile. "It's okay, it's good. For me, anyway. It's
is a generous descriptor—it's a metal trailer with a mural of carnival tents and murderous clowns painted on the side. While Cas doesn't quite understand why humans have decided clowns are something to be feared, he's beginning to see why Sam didn't wish to accompany them on this particular outing.
"No. Fuck no." Dean's had his fun, and now he's done with all that. Hell, he should have thrown it all in the trash, the makeup, the dress, everything. It's all stuffed into a plastic bag and burning a hole in the bottom of his duffel.
Dean grabs himself coffee and a sandwich, considers it while he eats. He could try calling up Cas. It took a Biblical plague to get him down here last time, but maybe now that Dean's back on the board, he'll consider him worth a minute or two of his time. He doesn't know what's going on with that guy these days. He just went and traded one Holy War for another, no time to pause in between. Dean supposes he can't blame him. Dean tried to go domestic, and look how well that went. Cas has been an angel for aeons longer than Dean's been alive, but they're both soldiers. He knows peacetime isn't really
It still feels different. And Cas left. He flew off without a word. Maybe he's just busy, like he always is. Or maybe this was just a step too far. Maybe he really was frozen in terror, a deer in Dean's headlights. Maybe Dean won't see him for another year after this. Or ever again.
He vanishes from the bunker, and appears before a drunken 26-year-old in a dingy motel room, sitting on the edge of the bed, handgun in his hand.
Missouri hums. “I only wish I was wrong… To be blighted by a demon to such a degree, it’s terrible.”
“Because it’s true. And I don’t want the same things I used to want,” Sam sighs, a decision being made in his head as he continues on. “I used to think I hated hunting, because I was hunting the way dad wanted us to. But I don’t hate it, not when I do it my own way, on my own terms. I’m helping people. And not just people.”
Dean had been ready to do this, in theory. It’s totally different when he’s stood over an angel’s body, blade in hand, about to desecrate the poor man’s corpse. Looking at the angel’s lifeless face, it’s difficult to see anything other than a man. He may have had wings, and followed a different set of orders, but Cas’ words resonate in his mind. Angels don’t always want to hurt you. Angels don’t want to die.
Dean presses his lips together and nods decisively. “Right.” Dean scuffs his foot on the grass. “Well, I’d better get back to Sam. He’s still recovering.”
Castiel frowns, a hand poised over the hilt of his blade on instinct. Dean’s face is warm and open, the low light glittering off his cheek, his face bathed in a golden glow illuminating the smattering of freckles gracing his cheeks. Castiel’s hand lowers.
He knows it doesn’t matter, that there’s no alternative ending for him, but Castiel cannot make himself say it. When he looks back at every moment, every conversation, laugh, every kiss he has shared with Dean, the word ‘guilty’ could not ever describe it.
Dean’s eyes widen. He doesn’t remember ever praying, not once in his life. Not to anyone, not to any higher power, not to God, not to any angel and not to Castiel. Maybe, in his desperate tossing and turning, as he asked into the empty air for Castiel to answer him, to find him— maybe that need constituted a prayer.
Castiel chews on the inside of his cheek. In truth, he’d been intending on taking the coward’s way out, letting himself perish by indecision by allowing himself to succumb to his wounds. It’s not possible anymore without deliberate intervention, so it isn’t worth mentioning. “I hadn’t,” he answers honestly.
‘Nasty few days’ is one way to put it. Castiel, a being who has lived for literal eons, is more inclined to call it the most gruelling and painful days of his entire existence. Following his first night, where the physical pain was dulled mostly by shock and grief, the days hence allow him no such luxury.
Sam grimaces then takes his leave, muttering under his breath, “I think I preferred it when you were faking.”
Cas’ hands clench as he balls them up in the fabric of Dean’s t-shirt. He buries his face in Dean’s shoulder. “Fuck,” he breathes out into Dean’s chest, before pushing himself up and off. Standing there with a hand over his forehead, he looks over Dean for a moment, sprawled out on the sofa before him. His lips press together before he walks away quickly, not sparing a second look at Dean, leaving him there alone to cool down and catch his breath.
The blade burns cold just as he’d expected, but it doesn’t spread through his entire being, doesn’t tear him apart completely. Outside of the point of contact, a chill spreads through his body, a cold numbness. The feeling of oozing blood is a sickly warmth against his icy skin. He screams and screams and squirms and struggles, and he can feel the visceral howls resonating through his bones, feel the echoes bounce off of the floors and the walls and back.
Dean considers for a moment, before answering, “Normally I’d say human, but I guess that doesn’t apply.” He offers a small smile. “Look, man, not wanting to kill me makes you, like, the best of any angel I’ve ever heard of.”
“Don’t you wanna settle down with her? Raise a couple kids or whatever?” Dean pushes, honestly just waiting for ‘the truth’ to slip out and confirm what he fears.
They make it over to the Impala where Cas drops his hand. Dean leans on the side for a second checking his messages from Sam again, since he’d been dealing with a second grave a few towns over to wrap up the case. “Sam just got back to town,” he announces. “He said he’s five minutes away from here. Figured we can wait for him, then head to a motel for the night. We can drive back in the morning when I hurt a little less.”
“Is it weird that I kinda wish my senior prom was like that?” Sam asks, pouring out another glass for everyone.
Cas draws in a long breath. A totally unnecessary action for an angel who doesn’t need to breathe to live. “No.”
A cheery female voice chirped from behind Dean as he began to close up the U-Haul. Dean turned and was greeted by the broad smile of a mid-thirties woman in yoga pants.
At this Castiel finds his strength, scrambling frantically to lift his weakened and weary form from the blood-stained floor. “No, stop!” he demands. “I am the guilty party; I healed his brother of my own will, I am the one who betrayed my brother and sisters. I— I chose to lie with him. If we as angels cannot show mercy— show forgiveness to the sins of humanity, then we have truly lost our way. Execute me if you must, but let him go free,
"Emma's found the Trans," he tells Sam as soon as they've hung up. Which takes awhile in between Dean ranting down the telephone at his only daughter for disobeying him and putting herself in danger like that.
Mrs. Tran folds her arms and looks at Dean expectantly. "You never talked about that part? Very reassuring."
"No!" Emma yells. Her eyes are still human, but her usually watertight control seems to be slipping at the edges. "You don't get to just leave me behind!"
"I'm not cutting you off. I never did," Sam continues in the face of Dean's utter defeat. "You can still call, visit sometimes. Just not for the job."
“What’s his problem?” Dean mutters to Cas. The guy’s burly-looking, dressed in an old beat-up leather jacket and jeans. He might have a lovely smile, but he looks as if he hasn’t worn it in an age and his face has permanently morphed into an expression of misery and rage. He looks kind of like John, Dean thinks. It’s in the eyes.
Sounds about right; Dean’s heard from the guy’s fan club that he’s ‘mysterious and aloof’. Of course it drives that lot wild. Dean already doesn’t like the sound of this guy, since he himself always favours whipping out the charm with new people, and doesn’t particularly appreciate people who give him nothing to work with, who like to make his life more difficult than it needs to be.
“What?” Dean’s face drops. He should be relieved- scratch that, he should be ecstatic. But instead it feels like a gut punch. It feels like being dumped.
Dean freezes, having almost forgotten about the bet until Jody’s comment brought awareness tumbling down over him. “No, yeah, you’re right,” Dean says, shrinking into himself a little as he tenses.
“Well don’t just look.” Cas set the bottle down and moved his free hand to cup Dean’s face as he leaned over and pressed his lips against Dean’s in a soft kiss. Cas pulled back a fraction, face millimetres from Dean’s.
“I can’t even imagine you drunk enough to puke in a dumpster,” Dean chuckles, feeling the shake of Cas’ body flush beside him as he snickers. “The part about you throwing a guy in there, now that I can picture clear as day.”
on duty. He doesn’t take breaks. He said— Sam the angels already have enough reason to doubt him they— if they found out about me or you or any of it, I think they might kill him.”
Dean doesn’t know what he wants outside of wanting Castiel to stay. It’s a desperate, selfish want. In this moment he couldn’t care less about heaven and earth, about demons, about war, the apocalypse, eternal damnation. He just wants what he’s always wanted, what for a fleeting moment he thought he might have had; a family, belonging, understanding and acceptance.
Cas’ head is hung low, his hands drooping onto the ground, just limply holding onto his own blade. Victor rushes into action, extinguishing the ring of fire and swooping in to pull Cas up from under the arms. He moves like a ragdoll; limp and lifeless, his eyes glazed over and lost. Victor slings Cas’ arm around his shoulder, supporting him there.
Dean stares at the vial, the bright light reflecting in his eyes. “I don’t— Thank you.” He looks up at Castiel. “What do I— I mean how do I use it?”
Dean frowns. “Have you seen yourself lately? You look like hell— you look like you could pass out any second. You think it’s a good idea for you to be up on a roof?”
It’s Dean. He slips into the room and closes the door behind him, isolating them together. Cas feels his pulse quicken, and exerts great effort into steadying his breathing. “I’m fine,” Cas responds plainly.
Castiel pulls back quickly, his attention turning towards the front door just a few moments before Bobby comes bustling in, empty handed. Dean and Castiel stand to attention and follow Bobby into the kitchen with Sam.
But there’s a hand over his, ring over ring, as Cas looks the older Dean dead in eyes. “Dean,” he says, his voice kind but stern. “Don’t.”
Bobby sniffs and looks over Castiel, eyes narrow in a silent consideration. “Well you can stay here while you figure that out.”
Up close, Dean can see Cas’ expression. He looks like he’s about to throw up, he’s breathing heavy and deep, but it doesn’t seem like it’s from exertion. “Victor, could you—” Cas begins.
“Awesome.” Dean nodded. Despite typically being effortlessly charismatic, Dean definitely felt out of his depth; he was simply not accustomed to the rules and decorum required in scenarios like these.
Demonic blight; an unholy corruption of the soul that spreads through one’s entire being from the inside-out. In some cases it can be purified if it’s caught early, but in an advanced stage such as Sam’s, there’s really no walking it back. Some day, likely in the next year, he will succumb.
“Oh hey, you’re up,” Sam says, walking in carrying an empty plate. Dean grumbles in response. “Here, wash this for me.” He dumps his plate in the sink.
There’s a laboured sigh from Sam which prompts a huff from Dean as he braces himself for the oncoming—
“No, I’m calling you a coward,” Cas says. “You’re afraid of what other people will think of you. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, it’s perfectly natural to fear the judgement of others. I just think it’s rather humorous how you try to deny and justify it.”
“I would be lying if I said I was feeling optimistic,” Cas answers, trying to make as much eye-contact as he can stomach, but ultimately gazing down at the bowl of swirling soup before him more than anything. “I will be able to send messages to my contact, but I won’t be able to receive any response, so we’ll have no way of knowing if he’s even agreed to meet with us…”
“Hell if I know, but it’s not here, so right now it’s looking pretty damn good.” Dean turns to Castiel, who has zoned out, despondent and lost. “Cas, hey, you with me? We gotta go, bud, and I can’t carry you all the way, I’m not as strong as you are.”
He makes his coffee and his breakfast to the tune of silence and the beat of the quietly ticking clock. He eats in silence too, playing sudoku on his phone with one hand (a game he only downloaded because Sam told him his brain was gunna start deteriorating
“Thank you, Jody,” Cas answers for him, able to feel how stiff he’d gotten. “I think maybe it’s time to retire for the night.”
“Yeah,” Dean muses. “Yeah, I don’t know, maybe this place ain’t all bad.” He bumps Castiel on the shoulder and Castiel bumps back, not sure of the protocol but just enjoying the moment as it is. “Do you think the other angels could be cool if they spent more time around humans?”
“Yeah,” older Dean states casually, before seeming to realise himself. “Yeah, that whole mess blows over.”
Cas squints. “You haven’t beaten me yet. In fact, if we’re keeping score, you’ve barely been able to affect me at all.”
“There wasn’t really time for him to say anything,” Cas stated, his voice quiet. “I think- he- he just asked me not to go.”
“Something like that,” Dean mumbles, collapsing into a chair with a beer in his hand. “Whatever, doesn’t matter anyway.”
Castiel’s eyes are wide, his breath heavy enough to see the rise and fall of his chest. He clasps a hand flat to his mouth and sinks to the floor. Dean passes a glance to Sam, who’s visibly rattled, but okay, then kneels down to grab Castiel’s wrist. He can feel his pulse running hard and fast.
Missouri’s roof is in dire need of some refurbishment, several tiles having slipped off having been battered by several years of summer storms. Dean gets to work shortly, aiming to get the bulk of the work done before the sun hits it’s peak and starts beating mercilessly down on the unforgiving black tile.
“Several reports from townsfolk about potential demonic activity,” Zachariah explains. Castiel struggles to keep his wings for flinching— Dean could be in danger. “Supposedly a pair of local miscreants have been consorting with demons. A boy on death’s door suddenly back on his feet— textbook demon deal.”
“What are you-” Sam began before spying Dean and Cas’s awkward expressions and dropping the apron with immense disgust. “Guys, gross.”
A wide, empty boardwalk painted amber by the setting sun, slipping over the horizon, basks a 26-year-old Dean Winchester in buttery warm sunlight.
As Dean pulls away, Castiel can see his face more closely. His eyes are glistening with a film of unshed tears, and his throat is tight like its holding back a well of emotion. “It is my pleasure,” Castiel offers.
Cas frowns and straightens his neck pulling his head back slightly. “Sam and Eileen aren’t here,” he says.
As Castiel recovers, Bobby spends more and more time with his head in a bottle, as if helping Castiel was the only thing keeping his head above water. Castiel can’t judge him for that; the intense pain was the only thing doing that for him, and with it subsided, all he has left is his grief.
Cas looks at Dean’s collection, organised meticulously by colour creating a rather aesthetically pleasing gradient effect. “I don’t believe that’s the saying,” Cas says, nonchalant as he brushes his hand across the fabric as he thumbs through them. Most of them are rough, worn and pilled after a hundred hot-washes to scrub out the grime of the latest hunt.
In a moment, Cas strikes from behind, with one hand over the angel’s mouth, and the other plunging his blade into the angel’s side. Cas wastes no time in shoving the angel into the brush to dim the flash that accompanies an angel’s last gasp of life. Once it’s done, Cas beckons the rest of them over.
“It’s frowned upon, but it’s not forbidden, strictly speaking, provided there are no… side effects,” Castiel says, giving Dean a knowing look.
With permission now granted, Dean starts carving in heavy straight lines. In a matter of minutes, he’s made his mark, his initials ‘D.W.’ etched into the bark. He can feel the grace radiating from it, almost like he’s let it leak out, but it stays put, mingling with the carving and binding it to the root.
“Right,” Sam nods. “The book mentions that. But I thought we could modify the spell a little. What we could do, is instead of borrowing all the power we need from a single instant, we borrow a little bit from a whole bunch of different instants. That way it’ll barely register to past Cas, but we add it all up here and now and it’s all the power we need.”
Sam returns after about an hour of suffering (that felt like much, much longer). Dean may as well have been stranded in the desert for how he’s been laying there dying of thirst, having accepted his fate to surely die.
“Well, Dean, they might,” Cas says with a sigh. He puts his hands over Dean’s and looks him in the eye. “I can’t tell you that people won’t ever judge you, but that shouldn’t stop you from being proud of who you are.”
Dean dragged himself up off the floor and sauntered over to Cas, wrapping his arms around him, kissing him with an almost desperate pressure, nearly knocking Cas off his balance before Cas brought his free hand onto the back of Dean’s neck, pulling him closer still.
In one of the bars that lined the street, a group of early-thirties women gathered together to toast to another week of work behind them. Pushing past their exhaustion was their relief, their ecstatic joy at being free at last, even if only for two days. The ladies sat around a high circular table covered in a rainbow of different fruity cocktails, curly straws, and paper umbrellas. Already the table was littered with empty glasses of drinks long since backed.
Bobby passes his gaze over the three of them before stepping back, relenting and allowing them entry. Castiel enters last, Bobby’s eyes tracking him warily as he crosses the threshold. Castiel follows Dean’s lead here, keeping his hands close to his core and his wings tucked tight to his back. Sam and Dean stop in the kitchen, standing around an old, scratched up wooden table, and wait for Bobby to join them.
“I guess,” Dean says, shrugging and releases his hands from Cas’. “I think I learned that my dad was kinda homophobic. I mean, at least a little bit.”
As soon as Dean makes it home, he collapses onto the floor, back sliding down the back of the front door until he’s curled up at the foot of it with his face buried in his knees. Castiel is gone. He’s gone. Gone. He’s
“How conscientious of you,” Dean mocks. He shuts up pretty quick when Cas’ arms are wrapping around his waist from behind.
benefit from a little angelic strength. Dean’s contracted into weeding duty which is just about the worst job on Jody’s little list, not least for the fact that he doesn’t get to watch Cas carry heaving things around as if they weigh nothing. Which is fun to watch just because it’s cool how strong he is,
Sam presses his lips together into a line, making that face Dean recognises as him holding his tongue instead of getting shot down. “What is it?” Dean asks.
There’s something different about the energy in the air today though. It’s strangely stagnant a there’s a static in the air, noise feels like it’s swallowed up— echoes fall flat and footsteps don’t resonate at all. The movement of the crowds is quiet and ordered. And there’s a million and one eyes on him today.
The two lie there, breathing deeply through the come down, sharing each other’s warmth. Cas rolls over onto his back beside Dean, having fared better than Dean in terms off mess. “There’s a washcloth,” Dean says, words lazy and contented. “There.” His arms flops down and points. “Could you pass it?”
Sam isn't finished though. "This has nothing to do with Amy, okay? I'll admit, I was pissed at you for killing her, and then for taking in Emma like... But it doesn't matter! What matters is that Emma's not your kid, she's an Amazon. She's a killer, and if you're not careful it's gonna be us she kills. Or our friends, who you keep leaving her alone with."
After fruitlessly walking the highstreet for awhile, the only thing that's even a little appealing is the minimart.
Claire, on the other hand, seems satisfied with the plan. "She can't just take us away because she's our aunt. We barely know her, or her creepy husband."
"So you remember the door was jammed and no one could get it open until it just, like, flew open for you?" Charlie's bright voice comes through into the dull room.
"Alright, alright," Dean holds up his hands. "Think we've established we're not demons. Can we stand down, now?"
"Wait," Dean says quietly, only loud enough that Cas, Claire and the officiant hear him. All three turn towards him, but it's only Cas he's talking to. "Cas..."
"Is the marriage even legal? I mean, how did she get you an identity and stuff without going to the police?" Emma asks.
"Why isn't Uncle Sam here?" Emma asks after a moment. She doesn't pass it off as casually as he can tell she's trying to.
Emma takes a sip of her drink and mulls it over some more. There's little chance she'll find an answer she didn't find in the hours of driving, but it seems the thing to do.
"You've never kissed me before," Castiel offers, wincing as he waits for the fallout. Perhaps Dean hadn't fully noticed what he'd done and now he'd withdraw or become angry.
"What do you want me to say, Dean?" Sam asks wearily. Dean's been alive again all of five minutes and his baby brother's already tired of him. Fantastic.
There's a chuckle and Dean looks up to find that Cas and Sam have snuck up on them. Sam looks amused, but the worried look from before hasn't disappated.
"Well, he's alive," which as far as Emma's concerned is doing pretty good. After all, her circle of family and friends contained pretty much five people and two of them died, even if she did kill one of them herself and resurrect the other one. "I'll have to double check he's still where he was last time I looked, he moves around a lot."
Emma swallows. "We, uh.... We found a lot of stuff out about Purgatory while we were looking for you."
"No deal," Charlie blurts and reverses the summons. Emma hadn't even known that was a thing. Dad and Uncle Sam had only ever mentioned summoning and exorcism.
He wants to spend his life with Cas. He wants to kiss him, to take him to bed on their wedding night, to wake up far too early on a Sunday to feed the baby he wants them to raise together, to be Claire's embarrassing kind-of step-dad and be there when she really does get drunk for the first time, and when she's getting married and planning her debauchery filled hen night. He wants to never have to go 'home' and have that mean somewhere Cas isn't.
"I can do that," Dean says, scrubbing roughly at his face and choking out a laugh. "Man, I get why you freaked out earlier. It's kind of a lot, right? Hearing that kind of stuff. God, never tell Sammy that I-" He cuts off with a long blink and an inhale.
Dean nods. "Okay. We'll apply for a license tomorrow, find a priest or whatever, set a date. And like we bullshitted to Naomi, it's not like we need to plan this huge princess wedding or whatever."
"Where else would I go? I already said I'm not going back to Jody. She's great but I'm done playing normal," Emma says. "I know you won't take me on the road, but I-"
"It still could be," Sam points out. "It might seem pretty harmless right now, but spells have a nasty way of getting out of hand."
Rachel nods, satisfied with her answer. "You know they'll find you someone else to complete your initiation, right?"
The man waves off her gratitude as his dog comes sprinting back to him, accounting for his somewhat suspicious presence on the empty land. He leashes the dog and sets off at a slow and steady pace.
Dean presses his fingers and thumb to his eyes and takes a breath. Rattles off the motel they're planning on stopping at. Sam says he'll be there soon and Dean almost believes he means it.
"When does it end, Dean?" Sam says quietly, but no softer for the decrease in volume. "Say I stayed, say I kept hunting. When does it stop? When we run out of miracles and stay dead from whatever awful thing kills us? When we're eighty and hobbling around using shotguns as walking sticks? Don't we deserve a little normalcy? A little peace?"
Emma finishes up the phone call while Dean broods, and before he knows it she's changed into her pyjamas and pulled out the take out menu the motel put out alongside a few brochures for local attractions and a complimentary bowl of mints. Her wristband is still in place.
Charlie shrugs. "I found a few references here and there, but it wasn't completely clear whether they were talking about female Men of Letters or just people that helped them out. Like psychics or occassionally witches. There might have been one or two, I guess."
There isn't anything Castiel can say in return. His head is buzzing with words, but there are too many to make them out, just merging into static as his lungs refuse to fill.
"Is a criminal justice lawyer, not a family lawyer," Cas points out. "So is Eileen. No, I'll have to find someone with the appropriate experience. Thank you, though."
She violently flips another page and this one does tear a little. "Dammit." She closes the book, and then the others spread out over the table.
She rolls her eyes and slumps into him in a way she'd never allow herself if she knew she was sober. "It's fine. You and Cas are too old and gross for strippers anyway."
Dean's practically moved into Jimmy and Amelia's house by now, the same way Cas did over a year ago to look after Amelia and the kids. He does laundry and dishes and cooks food nobody's in the mood to eat, and crashes on the sofa to stay nearby. And it's fine, it's not a problem. Cas is his best friend, and he's done way more for Dean over the years than a little light housework. But it does make Cas' absence at work all the more palpable.
"Actually I don't give a shit. You're grounded. And you're homeschooled. Your dad didn't leave you with me so you could go off on your own and disappear for months," Jody rants, pulling Emma inside. "Sit your ass down. I'm getting a coffee and then you're telling me every damn thing you've done for the last seven months."
"Yeah. Dean," Dean confirms shortly. "What do you mean you don't want a part of this? A part of what?"
If she took a picture of Rachel with her when she left, then no one will ever know who it's of. And if it's a little water damaged in the corner, no one's there to know where the drops of liquid came from. She still aches from sparring and from the torture her 'teachers' included as part of their lesson plans, and she's exhausted from watching the fire burn down to embers. She couldn't leave until she knew it was done. It had to be done, it was only a matter of time before everyone in that building, including Emma, went out to kill innocent men and give birth to a new generation of girls who would be tortured and brainwashed until their DNA was the most human thing about them. But they still deserved a proper funeral. A proper vigil.
The minutes pass and the group grows more and more anxious by the second. That is until Cas snaps to attention. He passes a look to Victor, silent. Victor is poised with an unlit match, ready and waiting.
Dean dodges the pillow and snickers. “Sorry, it was too funny not to,” he offers as a half-hearted apology.
Dean waits by the map table at 7:25. He ended up wearing the red shirt, because fuck it, right? Sam wanders past and eyes him up. He’s expecting some teasing comment, but all he’s treated to is a harmless “Have fun!” to which Dean responds with a meek “Thanks.”
Cas passes Dean a furtive glance. “Yes, I— I have some experience with them.” It’s delightfully vague. Jo presses a palm to table and leans in.
Sam’s eyes widen as he raises his hands defensively. “Jeez, thought you’d be chill since you and Cas are all loved up.”
Castiel turns and his mind is returned to the reality of the cool late-autumn afternoon. He hadn’t even realised how heavy his breathing had become. “I— It’s surprisingly calming.”
Dean’s face falls flat. He shoots Cas a vicious look, but despite his best efforts, Cas isn’t winning that easily. A little teasing is nothing to him, he’s been getting worse shit from Sam for decades (he still hasn’t forgotten the time Sam called him
“I’m going to stop this war, and wipe as many angels off the face of this Earth as I can in the process.”
The couch is decidedly softer and more comfortable than any motel bed Dean’s ever slept in. There’s no weird draught, nor is it sweltering hot. The blanket is soft, clean, it smells nice. So much so that Dean can’t help but draw it up to his nose and just breathe it in.
sick, if the pitying looks and uncharacteristic kindness the people of Lawrence have afforded Dean the last few months are any indication. So if Sam were to suddenly be bouncing around town doing hard manual labour, people may talk.
Victor turns to grab a small case, placing it square on the table and flicking the latch. Opening the case he reveals two pointed silver blades. “These are yours for the duration of this assignment,” he says. “You know what they are?”
Dean turns round, his eyes meeting the source of the yell’s own eyes dead level, not a millimetre in it. The face Dean finds himself staring down is familiar. The man’s eyes are a little wearier, his face a little weathered by time and struggle, but the face is undoubtedly, unmistakably his own.
“So…” Dean starts in an attempt at normal, polite conversation. “He yours?” he gestures between his older self and Cas.
“No Cas,” Dean says, soft. “You gave me an out behind that diner. I chose to take the bet the first time and I chose to keep going after that. You don’t need to feel bad about that.”
Cas shrugs. “Not worth it. I thought the threat of it alone would’ve gotten you to back out by now.”
“You’ve done enough for us, honestly,” Dean says, finally looking back down at Missouri. “If it weren’t for you we wouldn’t even know what’s wrong with him.”
Cas took a moment. He was no longer the unguarded open-book that was exposed by a dose of hell-trauma. Then again, the empty is a vault of secrets like no other; there’s no grapevine here, no prying eyes or repercussions. So Cas answered,
“Right,” Dean says, getting there. “Well it’s semantics. When’d you become spokesperson for the gay community?”
“Yes, Sam’s bringing Jack by tomorrow morning,” Cas agreed. “We need to have his room ready by tonight at the very least.”
” Sam says. “Do you have any idea how stupid that is? If Castiel hasn’t in fact been caught then all you’re gunna be doing is outing him.”
“There’s something wrong with him, I can feel it.” The angel passes his eyes over Sam once more. “It’s like his very being is corrupted.” He turns his attention back to Dean. “What’s wrong with him?”
“Woah guys, oh my god!” Rachel hissed, patting Yulia’s arm furiously. “The guy, the hot dad, he just walked in. Don’t look, but he’s right by the bar!”
“Whose house is this?” Jo asks, as she dumps a couple of bags on the flagstone floor of the once-homely kitchen.
Sam’s eyes widen and brows raise in pained agreement. He lets out a big sigh, and stretches his arms with a long blink. “So I’m guessing you’ve been making the most of your time? Introducing Cas to every terrible western ever made.”
“What, just because he’s a mechanic? That’s so judgemental, Sara, you can’t make assumptions like that.” Yulia scoffed. “He seemed really sweet. When he was talking about his wife, you could tell he really loves her. I didn’t get a typical ‘I hate my wife’ vibe from him.” Yulia gave a sympathetic look to Tia. “Sorry, Tia.”
It’s funny how quickly even the lowest of expectations crumble at Dean’s feet. As if he couldn’t even have this, not even on the run and in hiding, even that would be too sweet.
Dean doesn’t respond, focussing on his work. He sees Missouri’s twisted expression out of the corner of his eye before she eventually goes back inside, leaving him to work in a silence scored by the recently woken birds and crickets.
“And what cunning scheme have you devised this time?” Castiel asks dryly. Dean doesn’t seem at all deterred by the derision, marching cool and confident up to Castiel wearing a half-cocked smile.
Cas’ expression softens with understanding. Being an angel never protected his clothing from damage; it was never a part of his vessel. He had spent a fair amount of time, usually when everyone else was sleeping, washing, sewing and fixing up that old coat of his. It provided neither warmth nor protection, it was entirely superfluous, but it had always been with him in the moments that mattered; when he first met Dean on earth, when he rebelled against heaven, when he traversed purgatory - in a sense it was his lucky coat. If he could find that original coat, even if not to wear it, he could understand the desire simply to possess it again.
They scan through the list together in silence, each unable to wrap their heads around the idea that they might actually be done for now.
He knows he shouldn't ask, that asking is just buying into this fantasy and he can't afford to do that. But the weight and nearness of Dean has him feeling edgy and unreal. As if nothing he says right now can possibly matter in the real world. "How do you feel about me?"
"He has Dean," Claire says abruptly. She raises her chin under the sudden attention of all three extremely tense adults. "Dean has a job, Dean helps look after us."
"Did no one tell you not to talk to strangers on the internet?" Dean adds. He doesn't know the details, but he feels the need to draw Linda's glare back to himself.
There isn't really time or resources available for bachelor parties, but Ellen insists they come down on the Friday night for a few drinks and well wishes, and Kelly happily takes Jack for the night seeing as the plan was for her to take him while they set up in the morning anyway. Dean really wishes they'd been warned about Ash's quazi-strip routine so they'd thought to palm Claire off on someone, too, rather than be half deafened by her well and truly justified shriek of horror when Ash got up on the pool table to the opening strains of 'I'm Too Sexy'.
"Why did it let me in?" Emma finishes for her. She's been thinking about that a lot on the trip over. Not only is she not one of the Men of Letters, but she's not even human. Presumably the last person they'd want in their secret place was a supernatural creature.
Emma glances at Dean, perking up a little with a glimmer of renewed argument in her eye. "Then come to the bunker."
It's Cas. Alive and whole, freaking unscathed apart from his apparent amnesia. Living with some chick who found him naked by the lake (where Dean would have found him if he'd just stayed longer. If he'd just looked) and convinced him to marry her. She seems nice enough, kind enough. Dean hates her more than he hates the house. More than he hates the ugly blue sweater she's dressed Cas in.
In all of his observation (or creepy stalking as Dean would call it) Castiel has never witnessed Dean become flustered with a romantic interest. It's more endearing that Castiel would have imagined. "Neither have I. At all."
Dean takes her in. Does his utmost not to flinch away from her inhuman eyes and takes a step closer. "You're not a freak."
He walks away a little to make his call, watching with an amused grin as Emma pesters Cas with questions. The angel sure does seem to bring the annoying brat in her to the fore, and he seems no less confused and bewildered by it than he did as Emmanuel.
"Claire, you deserve a complete family unit," Naomi says firmly. "A stable financial situation. Guardians in careers that don't put their lives at risk."
Something lights in Dean's eyes, a realisation. There's fear and determination in the clench of his jaw when he speaks again. "I know that I haven't said it. I've said everything but, but I get it if you need to hear it for real. I get it. It's just hard, you know? But if that's what you need to hear then I'll say it. Hell, I'll say it everyday if you want me to. I just..."
"That he knew how to get into Purgatory!" Emma replies easily. "He was going to tell me, too. We were just figuring out terms, and then he realised I was a Winchester and it went to shit."
