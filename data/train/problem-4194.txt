Sam makes a half strangled sound in his throat. And Gabriel is strangely quiet.
Dean frowns at his dad but nods and listens to him lets himself out.
"Do you?" he asks and Anna wants to scream. "Where are you running off to? Zachariah?"
"Where are we anyways, angel?"
He's ignored completely for a few moments before the fallen archangel yawns, then turns and looks at Gabriel like he's nothing very impressive and then smiles politely at Castiel before inclining his head in the barest of nods, bringing his hands to his front. He greets him in their tongue using the formal words for family as if nothing has changed at all.
Dean knows this isn't good, because if Michael is out of it then who the fuck wants him? If Michael isn't giving orders or pulling strings...
Barachiel and Remiel are trying to scout before they're overwhelmed. He sent Dean down to the panic room with Emily and Elle. Bobby is very quickly undoing the lock on his weapons cache and handing things to Sam.
. Naps that Gabriel has to wait through or risk him waking up in the middle of his business and Castiel is fiercely angry if he gets woken up before he’s finished.
“You have to behave or I’m not bringing you.”
His soul.
“Remiel,” Lucifer speaks as the sun begins to wane.
He doesn’t think the baby understands but apparently Dean talking is more interesting than trying to yank his clothes off. Dean rubs his wings and lets him roll around on the bed with his pig for a bit before he looks at the clock.
Sam runs his tongue over his bottom lip, then turns around with the bottle in hand. "Here, sweetheart," he tells the baby, giving her the bottle.
and fishes a beer out of the fridge. And he's got to talk to Sammy about putting green stuff in the vegetable bin. Everyone knows that bin's really for beer.
. Make me be a good boy and say yes." He smiles tightly. "Didn't quite work as you can see. But the future... it was a mess. I never... I never went after Sam, never even tried. So Sam went to Detroit, and he said yes. Zach sent me years after that... I saw Sa... Lucifer. Saw myself. Saw Cas. I was dead inside, lights on but no one home. In the end all the angels took their toys and went home. They left Cas. And I had to be dead inside for what I let happen to him."
Emily is gone, and Raphael is holding Elle.
Shit, Sam, he's a step from going up the stairs when he hears the sounds of fighting coming from downstairs. No.
"Another angel?" Dean snaps, if someone doesn't tell him what the hell is going on right now...
"Interesting," Gabriel frowns.
"Kiss?"
Great.
Castiel forces him self away though, because Gabriel needs him and she's safe with Dean. He runs to the gate and Gabriel is pressing the woman into his arms through the wards before he rushes to Barachiel. She's bruised and smells faintly of sulfur but is otherwise whole. Castiel waits a moment before he turns back to the house, Gabriel and Barachiel are speaking low and frantically and he can't take the pain he hears in Barachiel's voice.
"Hang on, he ain't supposed to be doin’ that. Not his job if it's the proper apocalypse."
Gabriel laughs at that then shakes his head. "Take the kid. I'll go have a talk with Pru." He shifts the baby into Castiel's arms, and watches them protectively; already adoring way Castiel holds her to his chest. Gabriel swallows hard and places a hand on Castiel's shoulder, then squeezes gently. "We will talk when I return."
"Raphael's had me in London." Blank. "England." Blank. "Britain? Europe?" Finally, Michael nods.
Dean thinks that more than an understatement. Sam closes the gate, and they follow Bobby up to the house. Sam yawns again, and Dean's hand is starting to throb.
He can't help it, he laughs. He laughs until it chokes out into something desperate and sobbing. He lets Gabriel wrap his arms around his shoulders because he's knows the Archangel won't tell a soul.
"Luc's got a warrant out on him," Dean says with a proud grin.
They stand there for a moment side by side, putting away memories that neither wanted.
All the plates on the table shivered and for a long moment Dean didn't say anything. But when he did; he started slowly, "Now I never said..."
"We do not mean to be a imposition on you, Robert," Castiel says, trying to keep his hold on the baby. She stretching her hand out for Dean, as if she thinks if Castiel lets go she can just
"'S not that bad..." He slurs as she helps him sit up, because really, it's the broken knee that's the problem.
"No," Barachiel says with a smug look. "I did not personally sink Atlantis."
It only takes a moment for the air around Raphael to shiver and Dean to scream, "Go after her!"
Anna's face softens. "He did it for Dean though, so I'll forgive him. I think the poor thing was in love with Dean since the moment he pulled him from hell. He just didn't know what to do with it."
Sam raises an eyebrow. "Any marching orders for me commander?"
“Ever?” They’d nearly forgotten that Castiel was in the room, perched silently on the edge of the bed. There's something disappointed in his voice, and he looks at Dean with an intent that makes even Sam feel guilty.
The house pretty much turns into a zoo when Luc wakes up the next morning. He and Gabriel had a long fight about him going home that ended with a ‘not while your wing is like that!’ and a bunch of frowning on Luc’s part. Now Gabriel won’t leave his shed and Luc won’t get out of the nest.
So it isn't Cas and it isn't Elle.
He wonders what her dreams are like, if she remembered more than shadows and smells. It's a long moment of silence before he realizes that was probably not the thing to say.
of them, and they
Sam's head falls forward unable to hold it up on his own. Jhudiel walks around him and pushing his chin up with the tip of his knife. "One little word, Sam. It's all we want from you. Just one little word."
"It's nothing wrong. It just makes some more sense now why they'd send her. If you knew her, and Rem and I knew her, then she could cock a lot up before someone figured out exactly what was going on. If Rem hadn't been all guard dog at the gate then... Well, I'm not sure what that demon could have gotten away with."
"Don't give me the credit for finding her, she showed up on her own. I wish I could have found her for you months ago." Bobby sounds pained, regretful. Dean feels a fresh stab of guilt about Bobby's legs, even healed as they are now.
"I will not allow her to be needlessly hurt. This is all the promise I can give." He places a kiss of blessing on Mendel's forward. "Now go."
He’s standing in the kitchen waiting for coffee because coffee makes everything better. Even though he’s pretty sure it can’t cure the feeling of his sinuses wanting to burst out of his face like a baby alien.
Dean's jaw clenches and the baby stirs against his chest slightly, sleepy eyes opening again.
Something in the sky shimmers, then blooms with colors. A cluster of blue and purple flares up and feathers out across the stars, followed by a stripe of pale green then a rippling ribbon of silvery white slips out around the edges before weaving itself with the group again. It's beautiful. It makes Dean think of the Northern Lights, but they're too far south...
Castiel watches Dean smile and reach down to pull her onto his chest, sliding down the bed again, ignoring her sleepy grumbles and smoothing his hand over her head until she settles.
"He'll kill you?" Raven asks, her fingers sliding out of her hair. "If he catches you?"
Elle fusses softly against Dean's shoulder, her eyelids drooping and her lion tucked against her chest. He rocks her gently. He and Cas need to talk. They need to plan a way to keep her safe, even if it means separating if things get really bad. God, he'd say that magic word to Michael to keep her safe. To keep Cas safe.
Gabriel nods. "I want you to leave immediately then. The sooner we know how he sides on this, the better." Barachiel will be fine, it's an easy mission and Barachiel is the only one that can pull it off.
"I think I've figured out how to control Elle's shifts," Sam offers and Gabriel's fingers still.
Anna sits down in the spot he left as the front door slams and Sam hears Bobby shout before a "Sorry!" follows. Sam sighs and shakes his head, grinning.
"Because I will not lose this."
"Well, what the hell could have done that to her? The demons?"
of all people, grabbing onto the couch like a fucking three year old.
He nods. "Yes, my lord. I even know the motel they're at."
Blood is poured into his mouth again. Sam gags against it, fighting as much as he still can. It’s useless. Jhudiel's hand clamps over his mouth, forcing him to swallow. Tears leak from his eyes. "Good boy."
“Of course, Father. Where am I off to this time?”
He puts the cup in the sink and wraps his fingers around the edge of the counter. The colors shimmer and move in the night sky, and he wonders how many people have gone out into their yards to watch. How many will believe the news channels the next morning that will talk about fronts and flares and the
"Sam," Gabriel gasps, holding him still with the hand on his neck. Sam almost whimpers because
"You will be content to watch?" Castiel asks.
"To what!? Worry me!? Castiel, how are you even teleporting?"
Fuck, he doesn't want to make choices like this. He doesn't want to risk Anna going somewhere else with the demon though, not in either of their present states. And damn it he can't even blame her for doing what she did, going after him. As stupid as it was for her to
Anna smiles and nods. "I told him he needed to trust you and Dean and give it to you." Her face falls. "I... I'm sorry it didn't work. I heard about Ellen and Jo, Sam, I'm so sorry."
"Interesting storage space," Gabriel says.
Dean focuses on the problem at hand, “Then why’s he...?”
“How did you know Luc was with us?” He blurts, because he’d thought they hadn’t told anyone.
deserving."
"Fertility goddess?" Gabriel interrupts, well, that explains a whole lot. He lets the anger seep out of him. There were rituals that were best not thought about...and it was far better if this was an outside influence.
Cas presses in. He lifts Dean's leg, arranges him, and slides in all the way in one long movement that leaves Dean shaking, gasping. He can't really thrust like this, but he rocks against Dean. Each little movement sends little sparks of pleasure jumping across Dean's nerves. Cas' hand stripes Dean's cock, his thumb stroking over the tip spreading wetness. Dean gasps and keens, his mouth hanging open.
“Home.”
And the way he still holds the baby so protectively, maybe he is.
There's a figure in gray in the yard, on the
The dude’s wearing jeans and a jacket and in an instant is hovering over trench coat speaking, fuck, Enochian.
"I am healed," he hisses and attempts to sit up, but his damn body won't listen to him. Winchesters, had to be the damn stupid Winchesters.
He hasn’t seen any of his brothers for weeks now, so it’s a bit of a surprise when Anael drops out of the sky and approaches him as carefully as if he possessed a chimera.
Anna is on the ground just outside the gate, clutching something... someone to her chest. It takes Gabriel a moment to realize it's a demon, and then he knows what it is Anna holds.
Dean sees it when Michael looks up, the same hollow regret he saw in the mirror every day. Before Cas. Before Elle... Dean looks up at Lucifer, the Devil, talking with Remiel and standing half in and half out of the front door like he’s trying to not bolt.
Gabriel is perched on a junked car a little ways off from the front porch; he'd taken his coffee with him, although it sat forgotten in the grass now. He didn't much like healing the sick, there were other angels that were better at that gig then he was. But Castiel had looked at him like a helpless puppy and Cas is his fledgling. His fledgling that is currently
Gabriel doesn't allow himself to turn and look at Sam. If he looks he'll have to see that open devastation. He'd have to remember that he could have prevented it. So he focuses on Anna, and tries to remember how her grace once looked.
. There aren't enough vessels on Earth to...
"Where did the baby come from?" he asks carefully, perhaps a little sharply. He can see Castiel clearly in the child, but there are other bits that he can't quite --
He sounds like an idiot with that accent, smashing vowels together with abandon. It's messy and reckless, it suits him.
"Gabriel?" He turns as Castiel comes up next to him.
Gabriel frowns, tilting his head back and forth as he contemplates the baby in his lap, before pronouncing, "She looks like an Elle."
There are fingers trailing up Dean's hip, just barely dipping into the curve beneath his belly before skirting back up to his side in a loop and then coming down to smooth in an uneven line up his spine. He arches into them, half awake and unthinking, and gets a soft warm kiss on the back of his neck for it. His room smells like cotton and old wood and angel; exactly how he wants it. He mumbles something, some half formed thought of concern, something that he was supposed to remember.
A sick clawing feeling works it's way up Dean's throat, choking him. "What happens to Cas then if..." he cuts himself off and carefully sits his beer down on the counter. He rubs his hand over his face before going on. "Zachariah sent me to the future once." That seems a good place to start.
Barachiel is grinning and he's about to say something when Elle whimpers, then makes a sharp wailing sound.
Dean frowns. He better not fuck this up.
“Gabriel,” the storm thunders and the Archangel dips his head in greeting, “Good, I have been waiting. I have a job for you.”
Gabriel doubles over laughing.
There's blood all over both of them, and Gabriel can't tell whose it is, can't even tell if it's his sister that's wounded. Anna's reactions aren't helping either, and Gabriel will yell at her for being an idiot and running off her on her own much, much later. And there had better be a later or someone would damn well pay.
Dean has this epiphany about half a second before he realizes that the room feels like all the air has been sucked out of it and is about to collapse. Some tiny animal part of Dean’s brain is screaming at him to run but he’s frozen because
she's alright are you gonna let this go? Just for a little bit? Just until you're better, eh?"
“Luc,” Sam grins, he’d been hunting imps with Gabe the last two weeks and hadn’t heard from the kid since before then. “What’s up? Good to hear from you.”
“Nothing!” Jo hisses. “I just started making breakfast and he freaked out when I started cooking the bacon.”
- HG Wells
“Yes,” Luc says from where he’s tucked against Sam’s chest and Sam chuckles.
Dean has got to give it to this kid. He’s quiet. Even when Dean plops him back in the laundry basket and carries him into the bedroom.
"Just give it to Dean. Now get on up there," Bobby orders him.
Zachariah's face twists with revulsion at the noise. “I know you’ve created this outrage! This sin of flesh and lust! Not only do you deny your fate and the entirety of the Host, now you mock it with this
"You will not cross the wards again," it's a mixture of a statement and a question, something hesitant and Gabriel swallows, tensing for a moment.
"Come on, Gabriel, don't be a bastard. S’why I'm here, innit? If there's a new little’un kicking around, I wanna take a look at her. We’ve not had one since Castiel, and you know I’d never lay a finger on her, so I don't know why you’re eyein' me like that."
Gabriel turns and leads her into the house.
He stops for a moment, thinks about turning around and just
"Shit," Sam breathes out. Because this changes everything. It changes the battlefield. It changes the enemy. It means that Zachariah is really running the whole show angels and demons alike and... shit. Just shit.
come up with?"
Bobby nods, watching as the baby flutters her hands over Dean's broken hand. "Sounds about right. Well, he managed to mix himself up with some fertility Goddess. She'd saved his life or some nonsense and she wanted
Sam closes his eyes under the covers, “It’s the rainy season, isn’t it?”
Michael is healing him as fast as he can but it isn’t enough Lucifer can feel the edges of his brother’s grace slip away. It would be so easy to... Lucifer reaches, digging his grace into Gabriel’s, pulling him back, keeping him in place while Michael works. It takes more than a moment and they’re all bloody when it’s done.
"Well, I'll take what I can get at this point."
"You should also see where they sit." Anna adds. "I mean, they sit even with each other which isn't actually traditional, but we're talking about Dean here so... Cas is usually to the right of him and that implies enough of their status when they're in public."
"Crowley," He says, and she nods because she at least wants to know who she's gonna be dying with.
More squealing and shrieking, a bit more annoyed this time, Dean huffs a breath. "What is Sam doing to that baby?"
"Sam," It's barely a whisper and it's barely left his lips when he turns his head towards Sam. He presses his face into the long curve of Sam's neck and breathes in deeply. "This is the worst time to do this. To want this," he brings his own hand up, over Sam's back so it rests against the base of Sam's neck.
"Look," he starts. "She's alright. She's safe. I didn't hurt her. Gabriel didn't hurt her. She's fine. Robert's gonna take care of her, you gotta let me take care of you, okay?"
That gets dry and slightly forced chuckle from Robert, but it's still a chuckle. "That she would," he says, moving to help Barachiel. "You'd better be careful with her."
The hand pushes inside him. Sam screams over that wet laugh. It feels like Jhudiel is tearing apart his insides. It goes on and on and Sam's choking on his own saliva when he feels the thread of connection to Gabriel start to fray.
Sam shakes his head. "No."
Dean finally takes the bear from Castiel's hands. "I haven't seen this thing in years. He's held up pretty well considering this bear is old as me." Dean smiles again looking down at the stuffed toy. "Didn't know Bobby kept him after Sammy left him here."
Sam rolls his eyes as Barachiel laughs weakly, dropping his head to rest against Remiel's as the tension finally starts to ease out of the room.
Maybe it was a trap, maybe he'd been on Earth too long and had seen too many spy movies or maybe...
"Well," Barachiel growls. "He's not giving out any orders."
"Kali and I aren't getting along again and I didn't really want her to eat my eyes. I tried Odin but he pretty much told me to fuck off before I even got past the front gate. Everyone else either laughed, tried to kill me, or were drunk."
Dean thinks he laughs, something high and frantic, how the hell can he just show up and say things like that? Where was he when... When they needed him?
“Is it crying?” Uriel asks, partially in disgust and curiosity.
"Alright, alright. So, Goliath here’s the one that cocked it all up then? What’s that got to do with your fledgling?"
Lucifer doesn't move, though his hand stills and his head tilts just slightly to look at Sam.
It takes a moment for it to dawn on Sam why. Wings. He's pressing his fingers, digging them in, where the base of Gabriel's wings would be. Sam flattens his hands and pulls Gabriel towards him. Gabriel lets himself be guided, pulled, into Sam's lap. He straddles Sam's legs, and nips at Sam's chin then his lips. The pinpricks of light in Gabriel's eyes have grown slightly.
The blade hums for a moment in Sam's grip and Anna raises an eyebrow.
“He’s-” and then Gabriel says a word that isn’t English and Dean has never heard before.
Gabriel stays lounging in the grass during the six hours it takes Anael to finally catch him.
“Erm, what I am I to call him?”
The look Jo gives him obviously means he can’t.
“Good luck,” Gabriel grumbles ignoring the look Anael shoots him.
Raven rolls her eyes but hops out of the window with a flap and a thud.
Barachiel looks up at him and frowns. "Lucifer didn't send it. Rem says that Zach did. That somethin's wrong. He says that Lucifer is gone, he kept saying he couldn't hear him, call him."
"Well..." Dean starts but then he catches sight of the whirling hands on the watch face, spiraling too quickly, like sand through a sieve.
Slowly, he unwraps the chocolate from the paper. When he turns the paper over he see's words written in black ink.
"Is that what I fucking think it is?" Barachiel snaps, anger and horror mixing in his features.
Gabriel's smile is smoldering and his eyes blown. His gaze is full of lust and possessiveness and so many things that Sam wants to name but doesn't dare. Gabriel moves from his position straddling Sam's hips and settles between them before Sam can protest. Sam spreads his legs to give the smaller man more room, bends his knees and thrusts upwards just to see what it feels like.
“We are no longer allowed to return. It is forbidden for angels to leave Heaven during a war. We’ve been branded as deserters and cannot petition to regain entrance until the current war is over.” Gabriel says it in a rush but at least he loses that pinched look he had.
"I... A while," Sam manages and feels guilty when Gabriel closes his eyes.
"Dean," Castiel says softly touching Dean's arm, "It's alright."
Sam doesn’t have a chance to process that, all he hears is Zachariah muttering, “You left…” and then Gabriel snaps his fingers.
“A number of years I should think.”
There's a pause behind him, but Dean's still more asleep then awake so the moments slide together and then Cas is kissing him. The angle is awkward, but it's almost more of a nuzzle then a kiss. Dean doesn't mind. He's warm and content. He doesn't have to think about anything but Cas. Dean tries to roll over but Cas cups a hand over Dean's hip holding him in place.
"Yes," Cas says, eyes going beyond Sam standing in the doorway. And there just behind Sam, holding his baby girl, is Gabriel. Dean wants to kinda tell him to get his hands off her, but she's smiling, babbling at Gabriel, and reaching out to try and grab Sam's hair. "I did not mean keep anyone from dinner."
“Will it be as futile as the cuddling conversation?” Castiel crosses his arms over his chest and he so learned that from Dean.
Newly made, Gabriel thinks. He frowns, eyes narrowing.
He doesn’t see anything trying to kill them. “What are you doing to him now?”
Gabriel cringes. "And I bet your brother responded with all the grace and poise of a gorilla?"
to me. He was about to destroy your soul. No soul means no Crowley. No coming back from hell, no new bodies."
His eyes are a flaming gold when he looks up.
Then comes the epic battle of trying to get the baby redressed which Dean finally wins after distracting him and working fast. He gets a long whine for his troubles that almost makes him deaf as he watches the baby wriggle around on the bed trying to get his jumper off.
Castiel's posture relaxes just slightly, and Dean wonders what he was afraid of, Bobby wouldn't not take them in. Dean can't even fathom Bobby doing that. He does know from Bobby's tone, that explanations are expected, damn good explanations at that.
Dean had said fuck it after the first week of insistent questions and showed Gabe the internet. Which was a terrible mistake for the first few days but the angel had mellowed out.
She leans down and kisses him once, softly; he's never been able to just be angry at her. All the harsh words and the lies he tells to himself just slide off her like nothing, like she knows he doesn't mean it.
"Angels don't need to breathe," Gabriel mutters, "Somethings up? Barachiel, how did you find us?"
He can hear Bobby’s smile over the phone, “Anyway, since I’m sure your dad left you jack and squat to do with supplies for him, I’m sending Jo out with a care package and some extra groceries. She should show up sometime soon.”
"It seems that way," Barachiel grumbles, because he really doesn't want to think about it either. Because how did her parents not
"Sam is my friend, Dean," Castiel says firmly. "And I will not hear you speak of him that way. It is unfair to him and you know this is true. And we are not... 'fucked'."
"Yeah well, Gabriel's a dick, don't get me wrong, but I'm pretty sure Cas will kick the shit out of me if I wake the kid up again."
? "My Father," he tells her. "Your GrandFather," the word grandfather is clumsy as there is no true word for it.
Castiel makes a soft noise in this throat. "You marked her?" he asks quietly in their tongue.
Dean chuckled into his pillow, trying to not fall asleep again as Cas practically petted him. Hm. Wait. Dean pushed himself up rolling over and blearily looking at the angel with the least amount of suspicion he could muster. "What are you up here for?"
He wants to laugh because this is... It isn't real. The house is gonna come down around them and he doesn't know where Sam is. He doesn't know what they'll do to Elle, he doesn't want to think about it... At least Cas got out. At least.
“Awesome,” Luc says then quickly adds, “He’s not going to hug me again, is he?”
Draping his long arms over Gabriel's shoulders, Sam rocks his hips upwards. Gabriel moves his hips with the motion, the kiss turning messy but not hard. "Clothes," Sam gets out, his voice ragged. He pushes his upwards again, relishing in the low moan that causes. "Jeans off."
She glares at him. "Anna. I go by Anna now. I only told you that at least a dozen times."
A long bored sigh echoes in the air above his head before a firm hand cups his chin and tilts his head up. Icy blue eyes and pale hair, the angel... His eyes flutter as blood and sweat seep into them.
"What exactly would I do?"
"And now she sits there, weaving the most delicate of webs that shine brightly in the night sky so everyone down on Earth has to look up and marvel at her creation," Gabriel finishes, turning his head slightly to look at Sam.
"Barachiel..." Gabriel warns and Barachiel puts up his hands in surrender.
Sam doesn't have much time to think about Bobby's words, before Gabriel is standing over him.
Then Cas pulls away, his mouth red and wet, and it always sends a jolt of pure arousal through Dean's belly to see Cas like that. He's made Cas look like that and damn if that ain't a good feeling.
He can’t remember the last time he’s heard his brother laugh. “These are what I thought they were. They gave him to you?”
When Anna and Gabriel finally return about an hour after dinner, Anna's the only one that enters the house. From the way she looks at Emily, still asleep or unconscious on the couch, Sam figures she stopped in the barn first. She talks to Castiel in their language for several minutes, then presses a kiss to Elle's forehead. She snags two beers from the fridge and a bowl of stew before she heads towards the stairs down to the panic room.
Dean narrows his eyes. "And how would he figure out anything from your empty bedroom? What did you give him a map to Bobby's house or just loudly proclaim where we were staying at?"
There's a small shake of the angel's head. "You'd be more able to hide. There are those that would take more pity on a mortal and his child than on a son of Yahweh," he touches the gold lion Elle cuddles almost reverently.
"Bobby?" he asks, as she carefully presses dough into a pie dish. There's a can of blueberries out on the counter. Okay, she's baking, and yeah, he's seen stranger things.
For a moment Michael looks vacant before he shakes his head. "You don't change, Barachiel."
The words seem to stick in the small room, fading but not disappearing completely as Dean sighs and closes his eyes. "Yeah, I get that," Dean says softly. "And he left heaven because you didn't need him?"
“They’re gone,” Dean chokes, “They’re gone...”
Dean’s whistling Boston the next morning. He had a really good night. Slept amazingly, even with a baby on top of him and Cas trying to curl underneath him. His fucking knee doesn’t hurt, all his shitty reports are caught up on... Of course he sort of forgets all that the second he comes around the corner and Gabriel is glowering at him from over a mug at the dining room table.
“Both. No. Luc.” Gabriel growls. “I don’t see why he has to stay in that creaky dump when we have a perfectly good nest here.”
After a moment Barachiel shushes Remiel, smoothing his hair back before he looks up at the gathered household and frowns.
Dean can't help but give off a sound that's more of a laugh than a snort.
"Remiel."
the blade hum across his skin as he falls back, barely hanging onto any semblance of balance.
"Anna?!" Sam yelps.
Dean nods and for a moment it's just as strained as it always is. Another flat apology with them not knowing how to look at each other or how to...
Sam's head lulls against his chest. "No," he whispers again.
Cas looks up at that. "I'm glad," he starts to raise his hands as if to ask for Elle, then lowers them.
Dean holds Elle protectively to his chest as he glares at the newcomer, whose speaking to Castiel and Gabriel in that odd lilting tongue. Elle seems to be listening to them and she's calm in Dean's arms. Calm and quiet, watching the Barachiel curiously as she chews on her lions ear (Dean figures she's going to have a few new teeth coming in soon).
Gabriel glares at them both and there's the sound of rolling thunder in the distance because he's at the end of his tolerance now. "Are you both quite
"Stay in the house!" He snaps, feeling only a little guilty when Castiel flinches but this... this is bad.
It’s almost midnight when he gets the playpen assembled. He tosses all remaining blankets, assorted stuffed animals, and some of his clean laundry into the thing followed by the baby who wriggles up against a stuffed pig and promptly falls asleep.
Whatever was on that blade is playing merry hell with his equilibrium, he can't see or hear... He
It's good, so good. It's like... it's like it was with Jess... it's not just pleasure, it's connection, it's a promise.
"Kiss?" Elle asks, reaching out to pat the lion. Her hair is still damp from her bath, and for some reason so is Dean's hair. His flannel shirt is draped across a chair, damp spots slowly drying. Castiel wonders if that's a side effect from the bath. He had allowed Sam to bath Elle alone that morning.
"You just gonna sit there in the kitchen with him?" Robert snaps as Barachiel sighs.
Sam tries to not blink because Luc’s wings are out, sleek luminous things but there’s a dark stain across one of them. He loops his arm around Luc’s waist and together they fumble up the stairs and stop when they reach the kitchen.
"They've got the wards to trap us on their own skin." Remiel hisses and Anna feels her heart drop.
Dean rolls his eyes and rolls onto his side on the bed as his fingers get tugged on, he curls them around the baby’s hand and watches him wrinkle his nose.
Gabriel is barking orders before he even knows what's going on. But no one is
Dean rolls his eyes. "Great. I'd say it was a pleasure but I'd be lying. We've got no reason to trust you."
“And what are you supposed to be?” The woman asks, crossing her arms. “The cavalry?”
"You two know her?"
Barachiel knows he's got that haunted look, that one that he tried so hard to shake after the flood, after Rem's Fall. The one that takes way too much alcohol to get rid of. He plasters a smile on his face and is saved from having to answer his brother by Robert, angry and insistent.
Sam watches as Luc shakes his head, “They pushed me down and started tugging on them and...”
, Castiel sleeps, because Abe does.
“It makes sense,” Gabriel says as Sam finishes up dinner and Gabriel gingerly unwraps a red velvet cupcake.
"You're not going to kill me," Amon's voice echoes through the smoke, though there's not a single point where it originates from. He'd be stupid to think that Amon is at the same disadvantage as him. The demon is toying with him, drawing him... where? Away from the wards? He can still feel them hovering behind him through the smoke. He shifts back until he meets the wards again, pressing his back to them, waiting.
"Oh?" Dean raises an eyebrow.
Whatever the kid is, whatever the hell was going on in those angel brains, Dean will handle it. The chances of the baby still being there by the end of the week, given the Winchester track record for weird things hitting them then going, is next to zero. Dean might just put money on it.
“You are not helping, young lady,” Dean turns, but his voice has gone soft and he isn’t trying to not smile anymore.
Sam to hide it. He doesn't dignify that with an answer, he just licks the edge of his mark,
Gabriel makes a face, like Sam isn't supposed to see it, like he was supposed to be blind to the flinch that went through Gabriel when they shut up the panic room. He wasn't supposed to see how quickly the archangel tore himself away from everyone. But despite what some people think, Sam isn't stupid and to be frank, the idea of Gabriel in his bed in any situation has been prodding at the back of his mind since Anna brought up courting.
Castiel learns. Gabriel shows him how to fly. How to unfurl tiny wings of shadow and light and just dive, not fall. Castiel flies, and then
“No,” Castiel swallows. “War.”
His Father is there, waiting on the mountaintops as He said He would be in the shape of a roiling storm but there, running around on the mountain pell-mell through the mists is a little slip of shadow. Gabriel can just make out the wings on it as it squeals past in laughter, the storm rumbling in joy around it.
Gabriel only bought them time.
"I don't think Crowley is the first he's gone after," Remiel says, pulling a handkerchief from his pocket. He methodically starts wiping blood from his hands. Gabriel would be amused under different circumstances. "From what I pulled out of Nuriel's head they've been going at it for the last week or so. Demons, humans, angels, pagans, anything the Winchesters might have come in contact with over the last few years or that they thought would know anything."
could have
Gabriel inhales sharply, taking in air he doesn't need too quickly. Sam sat on his right, brought him food and drink, listened to him talk, touched the back of his hand, left him chocolate...
Gabriel shuts his eyes for a second and Sam knows it for the gesture it is. Gabriel's just as scared as the rest of them. He doesn't know if that's comforting or...
to know, because there's one of Lucifer's lieutenants in Bobby's yard, and he's going to pretend that Sam's worried about what's going to be done to make him say yes and not for any other reason. He wraps his fingers around Cas' wrist as it's the only skin he can reach. Dean thinks about the Colt and wonders if it would take down a fallen angel like it wouldn't Lucifer.
use the formal words for family. "Remiel, please state your business," Castiel finishes in English.
Zachariah is crazed, his hand sliding from his face where Dean hit him and he starts screaming, “
Dean walks closer into Gabriel's field of view, Castiel just behind him. "Yeah. Held Sam just fine." There something almost too casual about the way he says that, and Gabriel stores that away for another time. Dean gives Remiel the barest of glances, focusing instead on Anna.
The sound Crowley makes, though unconscious, is inhuman and full of pain as Anna's grace rips into the demon's already tattered soul. Anna screams and Gabriel can't stop Barach as he slides through the wards, carefully this time and kneels by her.
"New developments, Samuel?" Lucifer looks almost amused. "Don't tell me you've gone and gotten some pretty thing in the family way. I didn't even know you were seeing someone."
. Gabriel takes a bite out of the chocolate and stuffs the note in his pocket, before heading back towards the house.
She barely reacts fast enough to throw Jhudiel away from her, barely ducks, barely turns as his blade flashes by her head, just catching the edge of her hair. She twists and then tumbles, landing at Crowley's knees. It's a scramble to get up again as the knife sinks into the marble next to her side. She rolls, dips and then, something is on her. Another angel! She didn't even... Jhudiel smiles as he stands and he's too close to Crowley, too close, she screams and jerks up against whomever is crushing her into the floor.
"The hell was that?" Dean yells, spotting Bobby with blood on his face but still moving.
"Wow," Sam's voice comes from behind him. "Is that the angels?"
Barachiel shrugs. "Mated now though. Reckon Cas figured it out."
Castiel hesitates then presses on. "What are you planning?"
"That there," Barachiel frowns, "That's not teloch, that's different."
He stares up at the slowly turning fan, wrapping her hair around his fingers. "Why did you come for me?"
Another kiss is pressed to the top of Dean's spine. "Dilectus meus candidus et rubicundus electus ex milibus," Cas whispers against his skin; each word a brush of lips against Dean's skin.
"That really doesn't help us," Sam complains.
He rubs a hand over Castiel’s head, smiling when the wisps of shadow that adorn him stay curled up and messy.
All the Western Hunters had their panties in a twist because of some fucking meteor shower and...
It's Cas, and it's Elle, and maybe even the two Archangels. Dancing in the sky.
Lucifer opens his eyes when he hears the rustling of wings. The sun is barely rising over the steeple of the church's whose roof he's perched on. The city below him is silent, everyone slumbers on ignorant of the danger in their midst, they are blind, they are naive, they are content, and for that he hates them. There's a man standing in front of the steeple before him, at least he appears to be a man. He's smartly dressed in a gray pinstriped suit, covered with an immaculate black wool coat. He's young and handsome, androgynous, with pale gray eyes and dark wavy hair. He looks the perfect picture of a young wealthy socialite.
He wipes his hand across the mirror and scowls at himself. Right, he can handle this. The baby is cute and fires up all their protective instincts so maybe she's a trick or a trap. Possibly this is the work of a real Trickster this time. Or a glamor put on a perfectly normal human baby by a Fertility Goddess. Because babies did not
Chapter Eight: Four Sticks
"It wasn't your fault," Sam says, his voice rough.
"Formally courting?"
“We did.” Sam grins and Dean stops pacing for a moment to shake his head, but he was still almost smiling.
Then he pushes his feet into his boots, pulls on a t-shirt, and heads down the stairs. The first thing he notices is that Emily's not on the couch and the kitchen lights are on. Curiously and cautiously, he enters the kitchen only to find Bobby sitting at the kitchen table watching the very awake Emily. Death's blade rests on the kitchen table between the salt and pepper shakers. The young woman seems to be... cooking? Baking?
“Castiel?”
His fingers are back in her hair, and he breathes her in deeply. The fear and pain have eased away for the most part, now he knows that the blood on her is old. The blood is proof that his Anna can be, if one would excuse the term, a little hellcat. He wishes he could have seen her slaughter those other demons. She's glorious in battle. "An angel shield?"
So it was all about sitting, and standing too, he guessed. But Gabriel hadn't said anything. Of course maybe it wasn't about saying anything. That would actually explain
Gabriel smiles before he blinks, “I thought you said it was Sunday and no one was gonna make you put pants on?”
"Uh huh," Sam nods, and Gabriel thinks that maybe Sam Winchester is the only human in the world that can look at him and be completely and utterly unimpressed. "It better be good or I'll leave you out here."
Gabriel huffed and leaned against the gate. This wasn't going to go anywhere. He could probably chase Remiel off if he had to but that was a dangerous move. If Remiel was provoked he could probably find a way to tear the house apart, board by board. Castiel had the right idea and even though Gabriel really wanted to know everything that Lucifer had told Remiel, he knew that bastard wasn't going to share anything he didn't want to.
More pleased when Raven leers at Sam and shakes her head. "That boy is far too good looking for you, Gabriel."
"I suppose the short answer would be to say that it is complicated."
Lucifer stands and smiles. "Yes, I have a job for you."
sank Atlantis?"
She whips her head around towards Barachiel. "Or
Gabriel rolls his eyes and Castiel makes a soft sound. Oh, yeah, Prudence hadn't made any friends with Castiel by flirting with his boyfriend. Gabriel would find all this hysterical if he wasn't holding something that by all his Father's laws should not exist. "You're her type, Deano. She likes them pretty with very little upstairs."
Elle reaches up and touches the pendant curiously. "Warm," she says in English. She abandons the bear and lion, and hauls herself up using his shoulder for leverage and balance. Her tiny legs hold her unsteadily. She reaches for the pendant again, and Castiel has the sudden urge to keep it from her.
. Your hands don't look broken, Barach."
"Fuck me, Sam," Gabriel tells him nuzzling his ear, rolling his hips against Sam. "I want you in me. Think you can do that?"
"Oi! Who says? Maybe I was gonna ask him how his day went, eh? Or how he slept?" Barachiel's eyebrows raise in the customary lewd gesture and Anna rolls her eyes.
Remiel looks at them, as if he can see straight through the house, looks at Elle. The fallen angel bows his head slightly, and all of the angels look pissed and scared at the same time. Then he turns away and walks towards the gate. It opens for him and Remiel walks through the wards like they're nothing.
"Carefully," Castiel swallows. Dean is looking at him while Sam is looking at Gabriel and Bobby, quite pointedly, doesn't look at any of them.
“So,” Dean nods, “There’s that.”
“What happened?” Lucifer says, his voice has gone dark and low.
"Problems, Gabriel?" Sam asks, moving into the kitchen.
Gabriel got on the news when they finally killed the thing and Sam has been listening to him be insufferably smug about it for the last three hours since they got home. Dean and Cas are rolling their eyes as Gabriel tells the story again but Abe is all giggles and keeps shouting ‘Duggin!’ and flapping his wings.
"You?" Barachiel looks Sam up and down, his expression turning amused. "Sorry mate, but you don't look like you could start a piss-up in a brewery."
NC-17 this chapter
From the laundry room she hears Bobby say, "Son of a bitch."
Sam is tired of hauling boxes of books down to the basement in this ramshackle old house that Luc lives in. The kid owns one set of clothes, and a mattress; but enough books to start his own public library.
Castiel feels his human chest tighten, and his grace flare brighter than it had in what seemed ages.
"Yes, it's very subtle, I mean, it's an old system and not especially meant for humans. Really, we were a bit surprised to see Gabriel doing anything like that. We thought..."
Gabriel was walking down the road to the house, his hair tousled and coat flaring out behind him. He paused for a moment at the gate, frowning and then seemed to sidestep through something Sam couldn't see, making his way towards the porch. Sam wasn't sure if he should tell Bobby that an Archangel just wiggled through the wards. He'd bring it up later. Gabriel stops in front of him, tossing Bobby a cursory glance, before smiling down at Elle, then looking around.
There's the sound of wings bristling and then the female voice. "Gabriel..."
Sam swallows and looks at Anna. "So, what gifts are supposed to be appropriate, then? I mean, it doesn't seem like angels need anything."
Dean can't even bring himself to want urgency, it's too good and he knows Cas will take care of him.
"I think I have the right to," Dean points out. He's not even angry... he just wants to know. "And Anna's my friend."
Raphael closes his vessel's eyes for a moment. "Mendel." Fearful eyes are turned towards him. Raphael wonders when he went from the healer even the least of angels trusted to something to be feared. "Take your mates and go somewhere safe. Somewhere away from here."
Sam is almost certain he can get back to sleep. That is if he can ignore Abe squealing, Dean shouting at someone over the phone and the sound of power tools.
Slowly, Dean swallows and he remembers what Barachiel said. Michael didn’t know. Dean’s been down here dealing with this shit for years now and what the hell would it have been like if he’d been like everyone else? Oblivious, apathetic, when he could have done something about it? He can’t imagine what Michael is going through, what he’s gonna have to fix. Dean’s not sure he cares. He just needs to fix this, right now-
Behind him, Cas keens, his hips jerking forward. "Guttur...guttur illius suavissimum et totus desiderabilis talis," Cas half wails. The windows shiver as if pressed by wind.
“I think I killed every demon in Detroit.”
"You can choose where he sits next," Barachiel grins. "Now he's sittin' to the left of you, which means you haven't quite given him the time 'o day yet. But you haven't told him to bugger off either. He also sits there as a warning, if any others come sniffing around he makes sure they know he's got first crack at you."
He remembers the Home, him and Sammy only stayed there a week while their dad was on a hunt in another sector but it was shit. It was where orphans and crippled hunters and every thing that had ever lost hope lived. Dean had been lucky after he was hurt he had his dad and Ellen and Bobby to set him up as a Hub.
"Dean's gonna be pissed," Sam mumbles when he's done, letting Gabriel wipe his face with his shirtsleeves like he's five and has fallen off a junker in the yard.
There have been issues...
“He will grow. He is an experiment, to raise one of our own. Like a human child. Here.”
"Chuck?" Dean keeps his voice low, although he sees Cas lift his head, sees the small frown he gives him.
“I could leave...” Gabriel starts and Dean tries not to facepalm.
," Anna insists again. She presses her forehead against his. "You
“Are you mad?” Dean asks.
"Report."
Dean’s getting sick. Not that he’s gonna admit that. He’s got too much weird shit with Cas going on right now to get sick. He can’t afford it. He blames Jo, who came by last week after a drop off at the Home. The filthy germ ridden Home.
"I told Castiel about Lucifer. He'll tell Dean," Gabriel tells him, eyes watchful.
But Luc doesn’t get into trouble. He’s quiet and clean, he helps Cas out in the library, or sits outside in the sun while Gabriel works. He pretty much goes out of his way to stay out of everyone’s way. Then one afternoon while Sam’s doing the dishes he hears Abe laughing. Not just regular laughing, more like completely uncontrolled, out of breath laughing.
"That makes me feel so much better," Dean snaps.
Something knocks his feet out from under him.
crying from two states away?” Zachariah asks in a disgusted tone. His smile sharpens, becomes something more.
"What the hell does that mean?" Bobby frowns. "And you're replacing that."
She stirs again and raises her head, blinking at him sleepily. Reaching out with a hand, she pats his face and smiles.
The sides of Castiel's mouth curve downwards, and his eyes focus sharply on Gabriel, "That is an unfair assessment of Dean," Castiel protests earnestly.
Anael blinks as Castiel pushes himself to his feet.
Sam crosses his arms and narrows his eyes. "Yeah, because Zachariah wasn't trying to kill her, and all those other angels haven't been trying to kill Castiel. Angels are totally trustworthy," he says probably more harshly than one should speak to an angel. "And why the hell do you have a British accent?"
"Gabriel?" Castiel's voice carries and Gabriel looks up at Castiel standing in the doorway, Dean right behind him.
“It’s bothering you,” Gabriel frowns and he’s doing that angel thing where he’s looking at Dean but he’s not looking at Dean.
A demon was... "A demon?" Gabriel repeats incredulously. He's had his share of pagan demi-gods and goddesses in his bed over the centuries but he drew the line at demons. He can't imagine any angel, fallen or not, allowing a demon to touch them willingly. And that meant... "What did he do to you?"
Dean's tongue feels heavy in his mouth, and he takes a swig of beer, then another. "What does that have to do with Anna? I heard Barachiel tell her she couldn't heal him. Why is that?"
Dean laughs. "He probably will but don't worry about it. He'll be more interested in how two Archangels got past his wards."
Dean's arms slide around Castiel offering silent comfort. Castiel takes it willingly, greedily.
There are just sometimes when a facepalm is all you have left, archangel or not, "Pru, how on Earth did you mix a human and an angel?"
“Decisions?” Dean prods because he really would love to know what’s going on sooner rather than later.
Once upon a time Dean Winchester used to be the most kickass hunter in the continental United States. At least that’s what he used to claim. He didn’t really have any statistics or anything on it.
Dean laughs. "Don't worry, baby girl, you'll get there." He plops down on the bed on the other side of her and passes her the bottle.
Castiel's wings dip slightly. "I haven't had the chance. Things happened rather quickly. I did not think it would be safe."
“Is it a clean gift?” Sam asks.
When he promised Castiel his help, Gabriel hadn't said anything about behaving or quitting being a Trickster, so here he is grinning and chewing on a Snickers bar as he stands in the corner of a young man's room.
. Elle snuffled and wriggled, Sam watched Gabriel run his hand down her back until she calmed. There was something to that, something to the way that Gabriel smiled when Elle held her lion out to him; something to the way that he looked at Cas when he wasn't being a furious trickster.
Dean lifts his chin. “Did he just say something? 'Cause I can’t hear shit. Was he trying to be witty or scary? Come on, someone throw me a bone.” Dean is holding the baby to his chest, body angled protectively around her. She shimmers in his arms, and Sam really hopes she doesn't pick now to shift.
There is the sound of leather creaking, but the demon keeps his eyes on the ground. He doesn't trust, no demon fully does, but given the options it was better to serve him than --
Dean wakes up to the silence. He stares long and hard at the empty bed and crib. He pulls himself into a pair of jeans and a shirt, and he's putting on his boots when his fingers start shaking. When he goes down stairs nothing is going to be what it was yesterday morning. Dean takes breath to steady himself.
“What is it doing?” Anael hisses, still off a good few feet.
know what he needs,” Gabriel breathes against the side of Sam’s neck and he can feel the hurt, the helplessness, buzzing around Gabriel.
"That's not true," Barachiel hisses, so suddenly that Remiel's head snaps up in shock to look at him. "Don't ever think that's true."
"Don't you 'what the hell' me. You were the one banging on my door at some godawful hour. At least that's what Seagull told me. I was out. People to do. Things to see," Raven tilts her head from side to side. "So who's the hottie? Don't tell me that's the reason you came over? 'Cause if you got a new toy the gossips usually find out in a week or so and by then you've already broken up so it's not really news..."
Elle tilted her head to the side, looking at him with uncanny blue eyes. Castiel has the sudden revelation of why humans find his eyes so unsettling at times... or in Dean's case appealing. "Father?" she asks, sounding curious, confused.
Gabriel rolls his eyes. "Castiel would have thrown such a fit if someone had even touched his lion. It was his favorite toy. Of
Gabriel ought to know, he was the one Father sent to seed war and destruction among them. But none of them were like this child.
Slowly Anna tilts her head from side to side. "Power mostly. He's willing to think of you as an equal..."
"Well, first we find out what they want," He starts as Dean comes thumping up the stairs with Anna behind him at the same time that Barachiel comes in the front door. "And then we don't let them have it."
orders, yeah? Dunno if you got the memo, what with you being all Trickster-like, but when Dad buggered off he put Michael in charge upstairs."
you!”
The baby reminds Gabriel of Castiel - shadow, light, and space - but the wings are different. The tiny wings shimmer and move like liquid metal, occasionally losing a drop onto the faded motel carpet. He gets the impression of sleepy eyes, peering at him curiously.
"There are fucking
"Your mate?" Raven tilts her head at the van and then closes her eyes. "Am I to believe that you are actually asking for...
It is only once he leaves, and sets down in an empty parking lot near where Dean said he could find good ol' Prudence that he allows himself to really think --
The sound of lightning striking splits the air and Dean can feel the wards shattering. He's felt this power before. Cas inhales sharply and says the last thing Dean wants to hear.
Barachiel rolled his eyes. "You're one to talk. You're a blooming
"Go on before she shifts and gets chrome everywhere," Dean tells him, as Elle shimmers again.
rather big and loud and occasionally stupid.”
Vivid blue eyes peer up at him. "Can we go fly?" There's some hopefulness in her tiny voice.
But he still raises his hands and let his dad slip the tiny thing into his arms. He’s warm and his wings flutter as Dean settles him. He knows why his dad brought him here. It’s a baby, he’ll need somewhere safe, with someone that... mostly knows what they’re doing. Plus, angel’s are sensitive, they pick up on emotion. Dean’s had experience with that from Sammy. God damn, he’s a giant pushover.
Sam had insisted on driving after that first stop, and Dean grudgingly agreed. His hand ached, despite the pain pills he'd popped (and he'd never been so grateful for angel mojo as when they discovered all their gear stowed safely in the trunk).
Cas’ wings. He spends a long couple of minutes just huddled against Cas until he feels less like shit.
Then there's the smirk, warm and familiar. "You're asking
Because if they can't fix the demon then he's not sure they can fix Anael.
"You do not wish to discuss our child," Castiel says flatly. "Robert informed me that the idea of commitment scares you. I will not press the matter."
“You hear me, boy?”
It's wonderful, brilliant, and the tiny, almost surprised noise that Gabriel makes is totally and completely worth it. Sam thought kissing Gabriel would be like fire, sharp and burning. But this isn't anything like that. This is sweet, slow, and almost chaste. Gabriel tastes like beer and chocolate and something Sam can't name but it makes him think of warm summer nights and a buzzy feeling of contentment. This isn't the Trickster, there aren't any sharp edges or hidden shadows. When Sam breaks the kiss the only thing staring at him is pure angel.
Sam opens the highchair and lifts Elle out, holding her to his chest. The gold lion sits in the chair momentarily forgotten. "Hell changed Dean," Sam points out.
Cas and Abe rub noses, while Abe laughs that squeaky laugh he’s got. That’s when Dean knows he’s completely lost.
Something very close to fear starts to work its way up Remiel's spine. He'd gone to report last night and the church had indeed been empty. He hadn't thought much of it, Lucifer could come and go if he wished. If he could call...
He starts laughing when Cas says ‘shit’. It turns sort of hysterical after awhile but the angel just holds him and lets him gasp tears into his feathers until he’s wrung out.
"Castiel named her," Sam says, because it's important and he might be a little proud to tell someone.
Sam closed his eyes and frowned. This is supposed to be wrong and complicated but... but maybe it didn't have to be. He just has to
"Yeah, you don't need to give him the whole list, Cas. Baby stuff. It can't have changed all that too much since Sammy was this little," Dean says with a shrug,
Jhudiel just smiles, dragging the knife away from Sam's skin. "What shall we do with you?" he asks, moving towards Raphael and Elle.
He leans heavily back against the door and rubs a hand over his face. He can handle this.
He doesn't turn when the front door opens, or when the sounds of footsteps make their way over to him. It's Sam, he knows before he even looks up. He can sense him, smell him and right now the boy smells like chocolate chip pancakes and is radiating joy. He grins when Gabriel looks up and then he says, "You're amazing."
Bobby looks up and gives him a tired but genuine smile. "She woke up about an hour ago, and wanted two things. A shower and to bake," he shakes his head. "She ran a bakery in town before she disappeared."
Gabriel smiles, then laughs. "Might be." He tilts his head, watching the way the moonlight paints Sam. "What do you think?"
He takes the wide stare as acknowledgement that he’s at least being paid attention to and just lets his mouth run with it. “Gabe said you were an archivist. I am assuming this involves books right?”
"I will," Lucifer grins, coming around the couch. "Although I did expect better of you. Honestly, your world is coming to an end and this is what you choose to do?"
Cas looks up from the floor where he's been talking to the baby in a strange lyrical tongue. The baby had been cooing back happily, and occasionally answering back in the same language. Now she's making excited noises and wriggling to turn around as Dean dumps lunch on the table and scoops her up. She squeals, and he and Dean both briefly close their eyes but she just sighs and cuddles into Dean's shirt, thankfully not shifting this time. They should really watch how excited they make her.
There’s a hum in the air, the sound of wings and Lucifer turns his head in time to see Castiel. Castiel on the ground curled around... It takes Lucifer longer than he would have liked to recognize his brother. Gabriel’s grace is always brilliant. Bright. Now it isn’t much of anything and... There’s blood
The first thing they do is cut off Gabriel's mark.
"All I'm saying is that if you wish to continue to discuss the incident at the gate without coming off as somewhat of a hypocrite..." Remiel trails off as Elle waves her lion at him and burbles something in angelic.
Raphael presses his vessel's lips into a thin line. "I will handle this. You serve our Father well by speaking to me of this. Now go back to your post."
Castiel stands ramrod still next to Dean, his hand spread across the baby's back. The baby is looking around curiously, making soft bird like noises, then smiles widely at Bobby. "Bobby!" she declares happy, spreading her arms in the air.
"Yeah," Sam agrees. "It is better. You know in the Middle ages they thought auroras were signs from God."
Dean opens his eyes just slightly, he can't tell the time of day from half darkness. There's light spilling in from behind the curtains and Dean thinks maybe he should start moving. "I'll get up," he murmurs, stretching his limbs.
"There are a couple of things you could do..." Anna looks up to meet his eyes. "I'll walk you through them."
“What does it look like Anael?” Gabriel whispers, “He’s taking a nap.”
Dean's face twists, guilt and confusion in his eyes. "Cas, just --"
“It was a trap,” Castiel breathes. “They knew we’d come. The place, a fort or a bunker, it’s shielded. We couldn’t get to them. We couldn’t get past the barrier. There’s an army. Angels and demons, and we couldn’t get to them.”
“Good, I believe that means he likes you.”
But then Dean cuts in with, “Don’t be a chickenshit. Go get your boyfriend.”
Dean's not, though. It would have been easier if she'd disappeared after the first night like he thought, but he's not getting attached. Sure, she has Cas' (Jimmy's) eyes, and is soft and warm, and cuddly, and curls into his chest trustingly like Sam did all those years ago (though she's older than Sam was and Dean's quietly grateful for that). Sure, what he saw of her other -- angel -- form made something in his chest tighten. And the way Cas looks at her -- eyes soft, adoring, like he's holding the most unique thing ever known in all creation --
He can't tell what's coming to rip them apart. Heaven or hell. Feels like both.
The baby makes a sort of grumbled accepting noise and leans back in Cas' arms returning the lion to his rightful place, her mouth. The microwave beeps and Sam pulls a bottle out of it while Cas sits down at the table.
"Distracted," Sam tells him, wrinkling his brow. "I don't know, he's harder to read than Castiel."
"And what exactly did your... Lord tell you to do? If you would, please."
Shit. Maybe. Wait. He didn't know if he even wanted this. He didn't even know if Gabriel was aware he was doing this. They hadn't even talked about anything well... important. Like... Like what would they talk about? I like you? Do you like me? Yes? No? Maybe? Circle one.
Castiel's stomach drops when he realizes they're trying to take them out of the house. They're trying to
"Well, Zachariah can go fuck himself. Ordering the Archangels about and trying to kill your fledgling... He was always a pissy little tosser." Barachiel frowns and digs through his pockets until he pulls out a crumpled cigarette, which he frowns harder at.
He hears Gabriel grumble and then Cas, “You should wake Sam up.”
"Mate? Mate!? Are you out of your mind? You're tricking me aren't you? This is a trick," Raven straightens up as tall as she can with her arms crossed as Gabriel hooks his thumbs into his belt loops and waits and for the first time in decades, hides nothing.
Dean watches as Elle shoves her lion off the edge of her highchair and Remiel catches it without breaking the amused glare he's giving Barachiel. She giggles when he places it back in front of her and starts the game all over again.
"Our Father was simply copying the growth cycle of a human. I was an experiment."
"We're better," he says and Dean nods just as Elle starts up the call again.
Ummm, shit. Of all the damn times for his mind to go blank.
"What I want to know," Bobby was saying as Dean got back upstairs with Elle who, surprisingly, had fallen fast asleep on his shoulder, "is how he got through the wards?" Bobby glares at Barachiel who looks more than a little guilty and sheepish.
"A baby."
“Thank God for that.”
Wait. What? How the fuck is Sam in on this 'mission' and he's just...
"She's beautiful," Barachiel says, voice full of awe.
Mendel nods and with the sound of feathers is gone.
They’re both laughing ridiculously hard and finally Luc flops onto the rug in front of the fireplace while Abe giggles hysterically on his chest. Sam isn’t sure he’s ever heard Luc laugh like that. He watches as Luc sits up and rubs noses with Abe, both of them grinning before Luc spots him and blushes.
Gabriel listens again. It's like the sound of a far off conversation, or a car on the street. Muffled. Two of his siblings approaching the well warded "base" the Winchesters had set up at Bobby's home. It isn't a fast approach, and once... once Gabriel would have known them even at this distance. Something twists inside his chest, and maybe he's been in this body too long.
“Never.” Sam breathes and the smell of rotting flesh is strong. An angel forced into a long dead vessel.
But Sam knows all about throwing yourself into familiar things when you can't deal with something. He does raise his eyebrow at Bobby who doesn't even favor him with a look. So he looks back at Emily. "Mind if I heat up the pot of stew on the stove?"
"In the middle of the apocalypse?" Sam asks suspicion and hopeful relief on his features.
"Sam, stop being such a goddamn mother hen," Dean says, watching the baby. "We can handle whatever comes along."
