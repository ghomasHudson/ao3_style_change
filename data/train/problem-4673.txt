Cas nods without saying a word. That is the best he can manage at this hour before he’s sufficiently inoculated against the day.
Right?
Cas would give him the world if he could.
“Lube?” Cas doesn’t dare think too deeply on Dean’s eager expression, not when a condom is still clinging to his hard dick and the echoes of Dean’s lips wrapped around him are still creating sparks low in his gut.
By the end of the first movie, the pie is half gone and they’re pressed together from shoulder to hip.
“We can’t all be accustomed to seeing family members splashed across the tabloids,” Michael rolls his eyes but Cas counts his brother’s venomless tone as a success.
“Go away,” Dean teases and shoves Benny’s shoulder playfully.
As soon as he clears the wall of flags, the crowd starts to scream joyously and Cas can’t help the shocked little laugh that escapes him.
Dean looks between Cas’s rosy cheeks and Meg’s predatory grin with the beginnings of a smirk before he shakes his head. “No, thanks.” He flashes Cas a grin that can mean absolutely nothing good before opening his mouth again. “But I would
Cas hums with a frown before shaking off whatever thought is bothering him and returning his attention to Dean. “I just need you to help me lift them. They’re not all that heavy, just a bit awkward.”
Until Dean had let his hand slip under the hem of Cas’ borrowed shirt to feel the warm skin underneath and Cas had tumbled away with wide eyes and heaving breaths.
He swallows around the lump in his throat as he reaches for the button of his jeans as Mick climbs in over him, reclaiming his lips in a searing kiss that has Cas’s stomach lurching.
The barn. Cas would rather sleep in the filth with the animals than endure Dean’s presence.
Dean surely would have been driven insane by his worrying.
Cas shrugs. “Nothing.” He has no interest in telling Dean how close he came to be cornered by Samuel.
. He wraps his arms around Cas’ back, holding him close on the off-chance Cas was thinking about moving and presses a kiss against the top of Cas’ head.
Castiel huffs at that thought. He knows what Dean wants, Gabriel said as much, but Dean isn’t willing to simply take. He wants Cas to give himself freely. And that is something Castiel doesn’t think himself capable of.
Halfway to the door, Cas steps up behind Dean quickly and spins him against the wall, trapping him there with a searing kiss. Dean kisses back with a questioning furrow between his brows and squawks with indignation when Cas pushes away quickly and all but sprints to the answer the door while pulling his wallet from his back pocket.
Samuel hums and nods with a frown. “You do realize this will hinder our relationship with my brother. He already seeks to unseat me, and therefore you. Do you think our family will not face consequences?”
“You saved Dean’s life you know. If you hadn’t...” Balthazar starts, giving voice to the ugly little whisper in the back of Castiel’s mind.
Bobby sucks in a long breath and lets it out slowly. “Then what gives? An no bullshitting me, you can’t bullshit a bullshitter.”
“Benny!” Dean calls as he breaks into a jog to catch up with his friend.
Dean shakes his head, not having the patience for Cas’ continued reticence. Not after the crime he has committed. “Cas.” Dean glares, forcing any warmth from his tone.
Cas clears his throat and takes a breath. “It’s just, I was thinking,” he trails off and drops his head into his hand as his thoughts barge toward the tiny little thing hidden in the drawer of his nightstand. “I did something stupid.”
Dean hums contentedly as Cas tucks him back into the skimpy lace and presses a kiss to his hip before stepping back just enough to leave a cold spot at Dean’s back.
. Dean thrusts harder, grinding on the push up before dropping back to the mattress and starting once again.
“I’ll go get them.” Cas volunteers and holds his hand out for the keys as Dean unlocks the apartment.
Cas shakes his head and stifles a laugh. “We need a few minutes!” He calls back with a smirk.
“I asked him what he wants,” Sam tells Dean by way of explanation.
Cas’ heart rate increases enough to leave him almost breathless and he shakes his head vehemently despite Inias’ scalding tone. Truthfully, he doesn’t know if Dean would allow him to go but he doesn’t care what Dean’s opinion on the matter is.
“Dean!” Cas cries out as he squirms, trying to escape despite his peels of involuntary laughter. “Stop it!”
A flash of bright blue eyes and messy dark hair forms in his mind. Dean had been the one who nearly loosed his arrow, mistaking the monk’s brown robes for the hide of a deer. Had the man not turned when he had, Dean surely would have ended his life.
“Ooh, good choice. This Dean of yours won’t be able to resist. Now, let me fix your hair.” Balthazar grins and almost dances in place with excitement. “It’s good to see you not looking like a disgruntled tax accountant.”
” He taps Uriel’s chest once, hard, to make his point before spinning away and pinching the bridge of his nose.
Dean carefully takes Castiel’s hand, palm up and locks eyes with his Angel for confirmation before tipping the candle just enough for it to drip. “Ok?” Dean asks quietly and Castiel nods fervently.
These savage beasts that parade about as men, these pagan idolaters will be the death of him, Castiel is sure. “O good shepherd, seek me out, and bring me home to thy fold again. Deal favorably with me according to thy good pleasure, till I may dwell in thy house all the days of my life...” He mutters a prayer he learned long ago, his voice pleading for this torment to end.
Dean huffs and shakes his head, hating himself just a little bit more for everything he’s done to lead them here.
Dean smirks and nods. “You’re not wrong.”
Castiel’s pained thoughts circle until the sun returns color to the grey world around him. He shrinks in on himself when Benny pushes to his feet and rouses Dean from his slumber.
Or at least a jail cell for public indecency if his dick doesn’t stop trying to perform tricks in his pants.
“Uh. So is it like, one a day? Do you want to do all of these?” Dean’s mouth goes dry at some of the suggestions and he feels his cock stirring in his pants at the thought of Cas in leather turning Dean’s ass red before fucking him hard and rough. His thoughts stall when his eyes land on incest and his stomach flips. “Cause some of these are a no go” He shakes his head and points to the offending item. “No way in hell am I bringing Sam into any of this”
Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair and nods. “Very well. Where and when?” Cas asks as he extends his hand to James. Dean doesn’t miss the iron and silver blended band on Cas’ finger, knowing instinctively that this is as much a test as a gentleman’s agreement.
“I’m so sorry Miss,” Dean says, lowering his voice into the recognizable bass of his public persona. “You’ll have to excuse my fiancé’s brother…”
“Leave it. We need to get farther away.” Dean bats the monk’s hand away from the broken arrow still lodged in his shoulder.
He fails.
“Hell no. I said I want to try it and I meant it,” Dean says with a little too much determination in his tone. “Besides, we’re almost there.”
“We need to get to our clearing,” Sam helpfully supplies and Dean nods.
“I don’t want to hurt you either,” Dean admits, finally risking a glance at the other man.
“Sorry, I, uh,” Dean’s cheeks redden and he stares at the table.
Perhaps it is for the best the Inias kept his silence for so long.
He refuses to rush this.
“Eight?” He mutters, mouth going dry. “Yeah. Sounds good” He nods.
Dean grumbles and Sam grins.
Dean leans forward and presses their lips together sweetly. The tender touch makes Cas’ shoulders sag and the urgency of the moment flees in favor of reveling in the minty taste still clinging to Dean’s lips. “Slow down, baby,” Dean murmurs as he rakes his nails gently over the sharp cut of Cas’ shoulder blades and down his spine as they scoot closer on their knees. “Are you sure you want this?”
“Dean” Cas whines, dropping his chin to his chest for a half second as his fingers flex against Dean’s throat. “Dean!” Cas cries out as his cock begins to spurt, painting Dean’s stomach and chest with ropes of white.
Finally, Cas flashes him a smile and jerks his head toward the bed. “Lay on your back, knees spread.”
“I,” He starts as he draws back to put some space between them. “I cannot,” he says with a hard swallow.  His heart clenches with worry and he hates that his fear has little to do with seeking permission to go.
“Awww, come on baby. Sunshine,” Dean says with trouble in his eyes. “You can’t lay there like that and expect me not to react.”
Simple concrete.
The squirrel jumps in surprise and darts off the TV stand and scurries toward the couch as Dean jabs with his broom and gives chase.
Cas is quiet in thought for a moment, still tracing patterns on Dean’s soft skin. His hair tickles Dean’s nose when the hunter tilts his head up to kiss the top of his head, but Dean doesn’t mind. These are the best moments of the day as far as he’s concerned. “I do not know. I might need to research, or find a spell”
Sam hums into the phone. “I’m glad you called,” Sam says with a voice full of touching concern that Dean
With that thought, he settles as comfortably as he can, as far away from Dean as his rope allows, and lets his eyes slide closed. Perhaps sleep will be its own escape.
Cas smiles and ducks his chin. “I would appreciate that, Mr. Winchester, but I’m afraid I can’t afford...”
“Come here, sweetheart,” Dean says, lifting his arm to wrap over her shoulders and pulls her close. “This okay?” He asks, tone softening into something far more vulnerable and Cas nearly melts as he watches just how sweet Dean is being with her.
can be tidy. Meg is beyond hope.
It’s after Gabe shows him more pictures, of how old his father has become and how his childhood bedroom hasn’t changed a bit that he decides calling his dad might not be the worst thing in the world.
He will be two steps ahead of everyone and if he has Asmodeus’ ear, their plan will fail.
Cas deserves to be looked after and cared for.
He makes short work of the security latch and the deadbolt, opening the door just a crack as another knock comes.
The rest of their meal passes with teasing laughter and silly conversation that makes Dean feel years younger, more like he had when he still had hopes and dreams for the future. Before he had to grow up even though he had still been just a kid.
No matter what Dean might think, Cas doesn’t want just anyone and he most certainly does not want Inias.
repeats in his mind like a chant, his world consumed by the man already pawing at the front of his jeans. His fingers tangle in the back of Cas’s shirt to hold him closer as he groans into their kiss and spreads his knees for Cas to settle between.
“Me neither,” Cas agrees, relishing Dean’s warm presence and promise of getting out of here soon.
“My turn to pay,” Cas reminds as Dean pulls open the door to the Zap Zone ahead of him.
The crowd screams ever louder, arms waving wildly in Cas’s direction. He swallows hard and shakes his head at the fervent excitement of the audience. He’d be willing to bet (anyone but Balthazar) that Dean could tell them that aliens are invading and they would still cheer happily.
The shower passes in a blur of soap and hands, water slick bodies and frantic touches, soft pants and needy kisses. Cas’ legs wobble and Dean barely has his robe tied before a knock sounds on the door announcing their breakfast has arrived.
Meg swats them both away and drops backward with a huff. “I’ll be fine. Go enjoy yourself.”
It’s nearly foolproof.
Suddenly, he’s being smashed against just over six feet of firm muscles and wrapped up in an octopus grip.
Charlie has always been full of cheer and good-natured smiles. The woman standing in front of them now is all sharp lines with an even sharper glare who carries the bluster of a mom who is about to three name her wayward child.
“Doesn’t matter,” Benny quips as he takes their tickets and points them through the entrance.
Cas drinks his mead happily but doesn’t ask for more when his cup runs dry. He doesn’t need to. Dean is quick to offer and Cas doesn’t tell him no.
“Yes. Let's get back to the grill. I think the chicken should be ready to come off.” Cas is already tugging Dean away before the words finish leaving his mouth. His skin itches with the way Samuel rakes his gaze up and down Cas’ body.
Dean nods and his heart aches. “Flowers would be nice.”
Cas’ glare only grew more severe when Dean had to bite his cheek to keep from smiling.
Cas nods against Dean’s shoulder and presses a chaste kiss to Dean’s skin. “You have me.” Cas pulls back to prop himself up on his elbow.
“Did you just quote Princess Bride at me?” Dean stops walking and spins to face Cas he rolls his eyes. “Seriously. I try to get you caught up on the important things and now you’re quoting movies at me.”
With an amused wave, he ducks out of Dean’s room and heads for the bathroom.
No human can do something like this.
Dean leans closer, and it’s too soon, far too soon, but Cas can’t help the way his breath catches and his body freezes as Dean’s mouth moves closer to his until maybe an inch separates them.
Abandoned Dean.
A combination of scents bring back his most treasured memories and create a surge of protective emotions that are wholly unfamiliar.
Anything.
“That way.” Dean gestures. “I think.” He stands close enough that their hands brush as they walk and Cas’s stomach flutters with each gentle touch.
“He’s terrified of you, you brute,” Inias sneers as he grasps Cas’ elbow to lead him away before Dean can say another word.
“Cas?” Dean calls out and Cas ducks his head out of the bathroom. “Come here a minute,” Dean says, turning his phone back so he isn’t yelling in his brother’s ear. “Alright, Sammy, I’m gonna facetime you in a minute. Yeah, yeah, bitch, I know.” Dean rolls his eyes. He hangs up before Sam can say another word and turns to Cas. “Would you be up to meeting Sam right now?”
He can’t spin fast enough and he sprints to Meg’s door in a few easy strides that leave his heart hammering wildly. She hasn’t used in years, he never thought…. “Meg!” He pounds his fist roughly on her door, no longer caring if she’s asleep or not.
Cas strains to listen before shaking his head and deciding to go wash up.
Dean notices his hesitation almost immediately and whimpers with regret as he tries to pull back, but Cas holds on tightly, keeping Dean close.
“Mead?” Cas says as a question, glaring at his cup as he coughs.
Dean shifts against the well-worn leather of his seat and wrings his hands. Baby purrs around him, enveloping him with familiar comfort but doing little to soothe his racing heart. “I think I’m gonna be sick,” he mutters as he drops his forehead against the steering wheel.
Then why does he squirm in his seat under the man’s scrutiny?
“My choice? My CHOICE was to have some self-respect and stop hiding who I am!” Castiel seethes, years of pent up frustration making his fists clench at his sides.
For now, the rest of the apartment is fair game.
Cas still wears the tux from the party and Dean cannot keep his hands off him any longer. They had taken most of the night to pinpoint the shifter and then another two hours to corner them. Dean’s hands had twitched at his side as he spent the time watching women in fancy gowns fawn over Cas every time he offered them bite-sized appetizers or flutes of champagne off his silver tray with a wide smile.
From the outside, the building doesn’t look like much and the stale scent of garbage permeates the back.
“What?” Dean questions, already crossing the kitchen to settle at the table across from his brother.
Sam swears Cas’ eyes darken when Dean’s tongue darts out to lick his lips and Sam suddenly remembers why he was thinking about Cas a few minutes ago. He nods with a sly grin.
“We always have had a very profound bond,” Cas answers smoothly, drawing a smile from James even as Dean continues to sift through his confusion.
Dean had been furious that the iron band around Cas’ wrist was gone and he refused to replace it. His words, translated by Sam, where that Cas must live with the consequences of his decision.
“Dammit,” Dean scrubs his hands over his face before rolling out of bed to make his way to the bathroom.
Gabe is far too stubborn to leave it at that, but for now, the imp seems content and Cas tries not to dwell.
Cas sucks in a breath and closes his eyes. “Please, just leave it alone.”
“Me, Samandriel, Balthazar and some of the others are going to bathe in the stream just north of the village. Will you join us?” Inias asks lightly and sudden nervousness tightens in Cas’ throat.
“You wouldn’t turn all red if she were nothing. You like her.” Dean elbows Sam and Cas narrows his eyes at him over Sam’s shoulders.
“Yes,” Dean says, holding tighter to Cas’ shoulders in case Sam decides to send this entire meeting south.
Minutes or hours pass, Cas can’t tell with Dean muttering soothing sounds and occasionally speaking to someone on the other end of the line.
He still stands almost nude in the middle of Dean’s room and he has no way of knowing when the man will return. Cas usually gives Dean an hour, so he suspects that Dean will do the same.
“Sure,” the word leaves his mouth before Dean and bite his tongue and Cas’ expression lights up brighter than the sun.
Dean chuckles and nods. “Me too, Cas, me too.”
Castiel’s mind reels as he waits for the right words to come. Of all the things Dean could have said, this is entirely unexpected and yet completely unsurprising. He knows, every alpha knows, that omegas have a superior sense of smell and are particularly attuned to scents of distress. He may not know Dean overly well, but the man is righteous.
The worst part is, he knows it’s futile.
Dammit.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas pushes to his feet before remembering the woman he was talking to. Jo, maybe? “It was nice to meet you,” he says politely as he offers her his hand.
The idea warms Cas in a way that leaves him smiling softly as he works and discreetly watches Dean as he hauls the buckets from the room.
The coffee is a plus, but he isn’t going to count that.
Dean chuckles and stares at the card. “Castiel James Novak, Ph.D. Castiel, huh?” His eyes dance with amusement as Cas squirms.
Dean is good, sweet, and caring. Everything Cas wants and needs.
Kinks accomplished: Dirty Talk with discussions of others.
Dean takes a sip and makes to set the glass aside, but an arched brow from Cas has him drinking down half the cup in one big gulp until Cas finally nods his approval.
“Mornin’ Sunshine!” Dean bursts through the door far too cheerfully and Cas shoots him a withering glare that has Dean laughing as he strides across the room and presses a kiss to Cas’ pout. “I brought coffee.”
“Cas!” Dean almost yells as he gives Cas a violent shake. “You are safe,” Dean urges as Cas finally stills and he meets Dean’s gaze with wide and terrified eyes. Blood seeps from Dean’s cheek in a graceful line just below his eye and Cas’ heart lodges in his throat.
By the time Cas sinks into him, Dean is whimpering with desire and Cas’ heart feels like it could burst with affection. They rock together slowly, the pace unhurried as they bask in the emotions swirling around him.
He nods against the pillow and writhes. “Please, Cas, I need, I need,” He tries to say but he isn’t certain his words would make sense to anyone’s ears other than Cas.
Cas whines like a petulant toddler, nearly stomping his foot to complete the effect. He is so not ready for this. He sucks in a deep breath that does nothing to quell the cresting swell of nerves roiling in his gut and hits the little green circle to answer. “Hello, Gabriel.”
“I’m going to see what I can do,” Cas whispers before leaning forward to press their lips together again.
“Dean,” Sam says with a stern look etched in his young features. “I already missed four years of ‘your shit’, don’t make me miss more.”
“My treat,” Cas declares as he fights to hold his ground when Dean tries to shoulder him out of the way.
Dean nods with a frown that is interrupted by a gigantic yawn. He stretches his arms over his head and his spine pops with the stretch. “I should probably get going, it’s a bit of a drive back to my hotel and I don’t want to keep you up.” He looks sleepily at Cas with a halfcocked smile.
Dean’s breath hitches when a flash of blue eyes a tinkling laugh comes to mind but they disappear before Dean can grasp them tighter. He swallows hard and flounders for a thought to grasp.
Until Cas orders one for him.
“Still in bed” Dean answers honestly, not willing to pretend otherwise.
Dean can almost see Cas’ dismissive shrug. They may have only spoken for a little less than two hours, but Cas is easy enough to read. Dean hadn’t needed to look very closely to see the simple disregard Cas has for his own well-being.
By the time he gets back to his tiny little apartment over the garage, it’s barely past two and putting away his groceries takes nowhere near long enough. He sits on his couch, drumming his finger against his lips while his phone taunts him.
Cas shakes his head fondly at his brash brother and turns back to Inias. “Shall we?”
“I wanted to ask, Charlie suggested it and I have to admit she’s probably right, I hate to make things more than they are but I don’t want you to get…” Dean starts to ramble, his words coming faster and more worried until Cas grasps his hand and squeezes tightly.
Dean scowls at the words that leave his brother’s mouth, but he feels a tinge of jealousy and regret. If he had bothered to study with Sam, he would be able to speak with this Castiel. He quickly steps across the narrow space and wrenches his brother back with a growl. “He’s mine,” Dean says in their Norse language, making his intent toward the monk clear.
Dean’s breath hitches and he fights to keep his eyes open. This is it. This is how he dies. His supposedly endless life cut short by the sudden release of the palpable tension that’s been strung between them for so long. “Cas,” Dean whispers, nearly a whine.
“There is an emergency, I must attend to Benny immediately,” Dean says firmly as he pushes to his feet. Cas takes a step back and casts his eyes downward. “I will return as soon as the matter is dealt with.”
“Are you sure you’ll be okay by yourself?” Cas questions, hovering uselessly as Meg wipes the blood from her lips and sips on the water.
His breath stills in his lungs as he heaves the spade directly toward Lilith before he spins to pull open the heavy door. He hears her grunt and sidesteps his makeshift weapon but her feet scuff through the straw quickly.
“Right this way, gentlemen,” the host says with a patented customer service grin and gestures for them to follow.
“It’ll be fine, Cas,” Dean whispers.
Dean doesn’t say that, of course, one of the things he’s been trying to take to heart in his recovery is to take responsibility for his actions. Cas was ignoring him because of something
“Good,” Dean finally says with a nod. “Work mainly, my Uncle Bobby’s been kickin my ass even after I got done kicking my own.” He bites his lip, realizing he said too much and stares straight ahead, hoping that Cas won’t ask.
Those are words he knows.
“It’s okay, Dean.” Cas comes to a stop at Dean’s side, his proximity warm and comforting. “Rufus was the only adult I could trust growing up. He taught me how to feed myself when my mother was too high to bother coming home. He was ready to kick my ass when he found out I was dealing drugs to pay the bills, convinced me to find a real job. Gave me my first tie when I graduated high school.” Cas huffs a laugh and shakes his head at the memory. Dean knows that Cas keeps that tie in pristine condition and wears it any time he has to do something important. “Rufus was my family long before I knew what that meant.”
“Awesome,” Dean says
Dean feels his cheeks flush as the abstract idea in his head becomes real. Cas was serious. Cas is serious. There is a club within reach and they could… is he ready for that? To let Cas fuck him where anyone else could see?
Dean crawls up Cas’ body and draws him into a lazy kiss that has Cas moaning and breathless.
Dean manages to mumble a no. He knows he’s plenty stretched, and his dick is completely on board with these proceedings. He doesn’t even care if he comes or not. This is going to be one of many times getting fucked today, he’s sure, he’d be sobbing in overwhelmed tears if he came every time. That thought gives him an idea. “Cas?” He squeaks just as his Angel rubs the head of his cock across Dean’s rim.
“Castiel. As in Cas, Castiel? Your Castiel?” Sam asks as he pinches a frown and Dean’s heart sinks. He knows that look.
He doesn’t know whether to stay sitting and wait for Sam to come to him or if he should take a minute to talk to Sam privately.
Dean huffs with disbelief “Like there’s any chance of that, you’re about stick a metal rod up my dick” He shakes his head. “The crazy part is that I actually want you to” He tugs his lower lip between his teeth and watches with wide eyes as Cas sets the lube aside and grasps his cock.
“I’m glad you’re here,” Cas whispers into the scant space between them as he runs his fingers through the short hairs at the back of Dean’s neck.
Cas trudges to the barn and grabs the tools he needs to prune the small plants growing under his tender care and to dig out the weeds that insist on marring his perfect rows. He has beans nearly ready for harvest and… his frustrations boil over and he rubs his eyes with the heels of his palms as his thoughts stutter to a halt.
Dean nearly swallows his tongue. “What?” He manages to squeak.
“Cas,” Dean says as he parks the Impala behind the school. He shakes their joined hands to pull Cas out of his nervous mumbling. “I haven’t either. We’ll figure this out together.”
Cas raises a brow and glances to the man at Sarah’s side. “That’s good, Dean” Cas smiles, hugging Dean closer to him. “Do you like what you see?” He questions, nodding towards the center stage where the sub is now bound to the point where he can’t move a muscle. Even his very excited cock is wrapped with thin strands of rope. His mistress holds a riding crop and smacks it against her palm, letting the loud smack of leather on skin fill the room.
Even for a waste of space god like himself, the action of smiting is intensely satisfying.
Cas opens readily, smiling still, and hums at the first swipe of Dean’s tongue against his. His hands tighten on Dean’s hips, pulling him down harder against his lap until the swell of his ass is nestled against Cas’ interested length.
His heart aches with this newfound knowledge and he wants to push everything away and pretend it never happened. Coming here was a mistake. He sniffles hard and pulls back to wipe his eyes so that Dean can drive but he stares out the window absently as they make their way back to the hotel.
One finger quickly becomes two as Dean rocks back against him, watching himself in the mirror with fascination. Each twist of Castiel’s fingers pulls a fresh moan from Dean and the man pants through parted lips.
He isn’t sure whether to be touched or insulted but he reaches for the money all the same.
Dean skims the short menu to see what Cas is talking about and he hums thoughtfully. Blue cheese isn’t his favorite and the thought of passing up a bacon cheeseburger is blasphemous. “I think I’m going to get the cowgirl with bacon cheese fries.”
He would be willing to bet that Lilith is the mastermind between the two, following Asmodeus’ orders most likely.
Cas’ heart skips a beat from being on the receiving end of the adoring look that he was entirely unprepared for and he turns away quickly before his cheeks burst into flame.
It had seemed huge to him when he was twelve but looking back, he’s pretty sure that one wasn’t of legal size. Most of the snappers he’s caught since then have been quite a bit larger.
“Dean?” Cas asks from the entryway to their room. “What we talked about yesterday, about going back to a club?”
Cas sucks in a breath, still uncertain about the situation but six hundred dollars is almost a month’s rent on their shitty apartment. For one fuck, that would be well worth it.
“Jesus, Cas.” Dean takes a half step back with furrowed brows when Cas nods.
, as he’s come to think of that horrible Monday. He wrings his hands, stomach quivering with nerves.
“Dean? You’re here already?” The bathroom door opens and Cas steps out wearing nothing more than a too-small towel around his waist and Dean turns to him with wide eyes as his stomach lurches with sudden panic.
He knows exactly what his brother is asking.
“You know I don’t understand,” Cas says flatly. Truthfully, he understands more than he’ll admit. Dean thinks he doesn’t deserve him?
Dean’s hand balls into a fist and Cas gives him a nervous glance. Dean had warned him this might happen but he’s hoped that maybe having Cas right in front of her might help his mom accept that his dreams weren’t a delusion.
Cas sighs and shakes his head. “I will remind you as many times as it takes before it sinks through your stubborn skull,” Cas says, butting his forehead against Dean’s playfully. “You deserve happiness in your life and I am determined to be the cause of as much of your joy as I can.”
Sam nods and returns Cas’ slight grin. “Yeah. I’m so excited.”
He drops his phone into a drawer and reshuffles the papers across his desk. He doesn’t expect to hear back from Dean any time soon. Or really, at all.
Cas’ hands come up to grip Dean’s wrists, trying to push him away but Dean refuses to be moved. He glances down when Cas’ fingers dig into the tender underside of his wrist and notices the section of bare skin where Cas’ sleeve rides up.
“Yes, Sir” Dean responds quickly, forcing himself to relax and prepare to take whatever Castiel dishes out. His cock twitches with fervent interest and anticipation.
He busies himself reading the banners on the wall detailing the eruption from the weeks before until the day Herculaneum, Pompeii, and other small cities were buried. The bottom half of the large poster is a detailed account from Pliny the Elder who watched from afar on his ship and then perished looking for survivors.
“Gabriel,” Cas answers without hesitation and James’ smirk grows.
Dean grins. “And yet you still like me.” He takes the napkin and dabs at his chin with a cheeky wink.
Still, the handful who remain offer engaging and thoughtful discussion, negating Cas’ plans to let them all go early.
Dean drops to a crouch in front of him and reaches a hand to brush a damp lock of hair from Castiel’s brow. “You don’t want to wash?” Dean asks, tilting his head to match Castiel’s confused expression.
Cas tilts his head. “I fail to see why that is of import.”
“What is wrong with me?” He questions the darkness, blinking in search of something, anything. His heart aches with the depth of his sigh and he closes his eyes to force himself to breathe through his nose.
“What?” Cas gapes and his eyes widen in mild horror.
Cas’s frown deepens and he shakes his head. “How about you let me decide that?”
“I’m sure it’s lovely,” Cas says with a smile as he forces himself to move. He trails behind Dean as he lets them in through the back and his stomach twists as he watches the sway of Dean’s ass as they climb the stairs.
Dean’s brow furrows at that and he turns to Cas who is already reaching for the phone.
Charlie twitches a smile and nods. “I have a good feeling about you. Even if you guys don’t end up liking each other, I don’t see you deliberately hurting him.”
Dean hates that the thought sends panic racing through his veins. They love each other. Making love is something people in love do. Why does the realization scare him so much?
“Alright,” Cas says without reaching for his phone. “I can do this.”
Dean swallows hard with a reluctant nod. His brain sparks and sputters in the face of Castiel's gravel filled tone, nearly incapable of forming a coherent thought when Cas is looking at him like he could eat him alive.
“Sam’s about an hour south of here. I thought maybe we could drive down there after the studio? Grab a hotel for the night?” Dean speaks in questions and his cheek flush adorably.
Cas tilts his head, vaguely remember reading something about Dean having a less than traditional childhood but he can’t remember.
Shuffling comes over the other end of the line as Dean shifts. “Where are you? I’m coming to get you.”
Dean sucks in a breath and shakes his head. “I dunno, man. You know I don’t use poisons.” At least Cas ought to know given how much he watches Dean.
The woman claps his shoulder with a smile and steps aside, gesturing for Castiel to take her place at the register and Dean grins at the sight.
Balthazar breaks into a laugh and playfully punches Cas’ shoulder. “One day you’re going to show us all how wild you can be, Cassie,” He says playfully as he steps away to join the others.
Nothing like the healthy mess that the plants usually are.
“Good, Cas,” Benny says with a smile and gestures for them to move.
Cas shakes his head harder despite his wide grin and shaking shoulders. “Still disgusting.”
He nearly chokes and his cheeks flush hot when he hears the filthy moan come from Dean and he looks over in time to see the man’s pink tongue licking a long strip up the already dripping white ice cream. Dean’s eyes are closed and Cas is grateful that he can’t see the way he has to adjust his pants at the sight and sound of Dean’s lewd behavior.
“Good boy, Clarence,” she says with a soft smile as she pats his hand.
“Salve, Cas. Now,” Dean says, impatience bleeding into his tone as he points to the jar.
Now, every shot he pulls is perfect and his coffee consumption has increased ten-fold.
“That’ll be ten fifty,” the girl says flatly as she holds out their cones.
A slow grin spreads over Dean’s features as he turns to Alastair. “Alastair, son of Asmodeus, you are hereby found guilty of breaking our laws and harming another’s property. You have dishonored yourself, your father and our people. You are sentenced to die. Do any of you object?” Deans says, his voice raised so that all may hear and voice any opposition they may hold.
He takes a careful sip, watching Benny warily, but the man seems to urge him on and soon Castiel forgets to care. The cool water slides over his tongue and soothes the pain in his throat, a moment of relief in the torment of his new existence.
Cas nuzzles against Dean’s brow before pressing a chaste kiss where his hair ends and smiles. “Good morning, Dean.”
Ridiculous.
Dean shakes his head and presses a kiss to Cas’ temple. “I’m full of surprises.”
Cas flushes and dips his chin again as he takes a step toward the door. “I didn’t,” He starts but stops to take a deep breath that makes Dean inherently nervous. “I didn’t tell anyone about you until Chuck,” Cas says with a quirk of a smile. “He demanded answers when I came into work smiling like a loon after our first kiss.”
Dean will never live up to anyone’s expectations.
“I wish you boys would just fly out there, the thought of you on the road for so long,” Mary says and shakes her head as she trails off. She doesn’t need to repeat her concerns, Dean has heard them a dozen times over.
He doesn’t wait for an answer. Of course, Sam wants a beer. Cas follows him inside and Dean wastes no time in crowding him against the counter and dragging him into a tender kiss. “It’s gonna be alright.”
The gentle rumble of an engine has him straightening and he steps forward out of instinct when a black beast of a car stops on the curb. He dips down, careful to keep his back in a straight line to catch a glimpse of the driver and a wide smile spreads across his face when he takes in Dean’s grin.
Maybe this morning’s tension was a simple misunderstanding.
Dean swallows thickly, clenching around the plug nestled in his ass as if he needs the reminder of its presence. He had nearly swallowed his tongue when Sam had shown up. In all his half-assed planning he had not even considered the possibility of having to face Sam while wearing a plug in his ass. Now that he has though, the thought terrifies him. What if Sam had noticed something was different?
Benny laughs outright, the sound especially loud in the quiet of Dean’s room. “Exactly.” He agrees as he sits gingerly at the edge of Dean’s bed. “Ephraim will be in soon to check on you. He has barely let anyone other than Cas and Sam in here while you’ve been out.”
“Cas here was nice enough to come downstairs to
Dean rolls his eyes and slides behind the wheel, delighting in the lingering soreness in his ass. “Shuddup and get in the car Sammy” He barks good-naturedly.
And he does.
But now, people are bustling everywhere and the sky can barely be seen.
Kinks explored: Collaring and orgasm denial. Warning for mild sub drop.
Cas nods. “There’s a reason I suggested this place.”
Bobby claps Dean on the shoulder and squeezes. “I know, son. I know.”
Dean flashes him a pleased smile and reaches for his hand across the bench seat. Their fingers lace together in the middle, warm and comfortable as they settle in for the long drive.
Dean is a little bit envious of that.
“No sense of adventure,” Dean says, shaking his head fondly.
Cas shakes his head with a widening smile. Dean’s little pout and the stubborn glint in his eye are far more endearing than they should be on a grown man. “Of course, Dean.”
The hour passes quickly with various crew members stopping to chat and introduce themselves. Everyone seems polite and excited to meet him, as if he’s someone important. He is, more than one person assures him. Dean doesn’t bring people around like this.
Cas chuckles low in his throat as Dean’s hands tug his shirt free from the confines of his cummerbund. “I thought I was supposed to be the one begging,” he says, whispering low in Dean’s ear, “sir.”
Dean.
Dean hums with a growing smile. His tongue darts out to moisten his lips and his smile widens. “Forever sounds perfect.”
Cas watches Benny cautiously as the man points to Castiel’s bound hands before holding his own together and then pulling them apart. He points at Cas’ hands again and then gestures for Cas to come closer.
“So, Cassie,” Gabriel says as he leans back in his chair and stretches his arm over the back of the empty one next to him. “You and Dean-o set a date yet?”
Cas hums and sags against Dean as he burrows his nose into the column of Dean’s throat. “I’m okay.”
He watches Dean go with a soft smile playing on his lips until Rufus startles him by dropping a heavy hand on his shoulder.
Cas lets out a sigh and closes his eyes to send a prayer for strength heavenward before he uncorks the leather pouch and tips it to his lips. He moans wantonly as the first bit of cool, fresh, water splashes over his tongue and he’s certain he’s never tasted anything so divine.
“Come,” Dean says gruffly as he jerks Cas to his feet, hands now bound tightly in front of him. Dean ignores the cut still dripping blood from the monk’s palm with an irritated huff.
He swallows hard but steps through the door that Benny props open. Security guards flank them immediately and together they push through the crowd toward the center. The stage is close enough to touch and Cas risks a glance upwards, eyes widening when he takes in Dean with his guitar standing so close to the edge of the stage that people can almost reach him.
Dean nods. “You should. I think with your education, plus being gay, you could really get through to people who might be struggling.”
Dean nods. He knows Cas is okay. No mortal weapon can harm them, but that is going to take time to fully sink in. He’s only just found Cas, he isn’t prepared to face losing him already. He forces himself to move on and scoots further down the bed.
The delightful pressure has Dean trembling with desire, the tendrils of pleasure reaching out through his veins until he can feel his toes start to curl and his mind feels weightless. “Cas!” Dean gasps when Cas leans forward and gives the head of Dean’s cock a tentative lick.
Dean lets the act go unremarked. He knows all too well of his brother’s thirst for knowledge. Sam loves to read and his research has served them well on this trip. Sam has a curious mind and Dean will not begrudge him that.
Cas shakes his head and rolls his hips languidly, lifting just enough to steal Dean’s breath and ability to remember what he was apologizing for.
“So it seems,” Cas says with a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.
and is more than ready to be done.  He carefully lifts one hand, the one furthest from Cas, and flexes his wrist before placing his hand down again. He’s certain he didn’t move his shoulders, and unless Cas is watching him more than the movie, he’ll never have noticed.
Try as he might, he cannot imagine a better fate.
He can hear Dean exit the Impala behind him and sense him following at a polite distance. He needs Dean here, but he’s grateful for the space. He needs a moment alone with Jimmy.
wash over him.
Cas shrugs. “Maybe if you hadn’t been late, you wouldn’t have missed Billie’s introductions.”
Dean nods. “You’d be good at it.”
“Steve?” The man finally comes to a stop in front of them. “Are you alright?”
Cas leans closer, lips brushing against the shell of Dean’s ear to send a shiver down his spine. “You want me, Dean? You want my big, fat, cock splitting you open, wrecking your hole like…” Cas trails off when Dean bucks with laughter as he remembers today’s kink list.
No good could come of it.
Castiel responds with a firm smack to the center of Dean’s ass that has Dean yelping and pulling away in surprise. Castiel hauls him back into position and knead the sting into the already pinkening palm print on Dean’s ass. “You’re being a brat”
Cas simply smiles and adds soap to the washcloth before gesturing for Dean to turn around. “And you are.” He presses a kiss to Dean’s shoulder before starting to lather the soapy washcloth in lazy circles. “Just by being you.”
“Not getting any argument from me,” Sam says, watching them both as Dean struggles to get himself under control. “They sent me to tell you guys that breakfast is ready.”
Morning dawns too early and Cas grumbles when his alarm chimes a full half-hour sooner than usual. He slaps around his nightstand blindly to try to quell in infernal noise while cursing the existence of the sun.
“Wait, what? Missy?” Dean shakes his head. He has at least a dozen questions, but who the hell is Missy?
Cas shrinks on himself, cursing his oversight as he stares at the heaping bowls of spaghetti. “No?” He forgot. He completely forgot any sort of meat and any sort of vegetable.
He turns back to his task of dressing without another word while Cas cleans up their mess with a wave of his hand. Dean finishes struggling into his jeans and soon, they’re stepping out into the hallway to find James leaning against the wall.
The boats beach themselves with a gentle lurch and the raiding party begins to pile out with whoops of joy and praises to the gods for their safe journey home. Dean wishes he could share in their celebration, but he has a duty to his Jarl first and foremost.
Cas rewards him with adjusting his position and lining up the blunt head of his cock with Dean’s entrance.
His face scrunches and a single tear tracks down his cheek before he wipes it away roughly, scratching his eye in the process.
He chews his lip for a moment and glances at Dean timidly before looking back to Benny and steeling his nerve. Cas shifts carefully, barely resisting crying out at the sharp paint movement bring after sitting for such a long time and reaches for the promise of water. Benny hands it over with a nod and Cas forces himself flinch a smile and return Benny’s nod as thanks.
“Anything” Dean rasps, pressing his ass back against Castiel’s front.
Damn Balthazar and his damn bets.
Dean’s mouth goes dry. Cas isn’t wrong and he knows it.
Dean nods dumbly, in full agreement, as Cas zaps the small amount of alcohol from Dean’s body and vanishes; leaving Dean to slump against the shower wall, panting for breath. That was intense. Way more intense than normal and Dean absolutely loves it. “Damn” He shakes his head with a laugh, staring down at his still eager cock. He cuts the hot water and stands under the freezing spray, not willing to disobey his Angel’s wishes, until he’s flaccid and shivering. Fire still burns in his belly, but he now only have fifteen minutes until he’s supposed to be downstairs.
Cas sighs and frowns but hands over the empty vessel for Dean to refill without complaint. He doesn’t have the fortitude to fight Dean over his willingness to treat him properly.
“Come,” Dean says, waving his arm with his unwavering smile when Castiel takes a step toward him. Dean slings an arm around Cas’ shoulders and pulls him close without another word.
Cas nods and bends his knees, opening himself to Dean even as his cheeks heat with the awkwardness of this position but Dean’s gaze is hungry as he brushes his hands over Cas’ trembling thighs.
Cas shakes his head with an amused huff. “I remind you of your brother?” He’d be willing to call bullshit on that after all the talking Dean has done about how perfect his little brother is. How smart, how determined, how kind. Dean must be crazy if he sees those things in him.
In the dark of night, hidden safely in his room, Dean had wondered what Cas would be like if he ever had him like this. Dean would stroke his cock lazily, picturing Cas’ tender smile as Dean would sink into him, fucking slow and soft until they were both panting.
“Wait, Cas? This is Cas? Castiel.” Bobby scrubs a hand over his beard and nods with a grimace. “This that boy you been pining over for weeks now?” Bobby grumbles and Castiel feels his cheeks heat as he takes a step back to hide behind Dean.
“Hey, I just got it to lay down,” Cas pulls Dean’s hands away with a pout as he tries to fix the damage.
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean meets his eyes as Cas shoves the butter toward him. “Can I ask you something?”
Cas nods dumbly as Dean leads the way, not needing a map. Benny’s looming presence keeps people at bay and Cas is grateful. “She seemed very excited that you have a boyfriend,” Cas whispers, needing to know what Dean thinks of that interaction.
“You weren’t broken” Dean croaks with a frown. What the Angels had done to Castiel will always be a sore spot, no matter how much time passes.
Cas stumbles along beside Dean silently. His cheeks are flushed red and his jaw is held tightly clenched as Sam follows behind them.
A larger than expected drip falls from the candle and Dean imagines he sees it splattering as it lands directly on the tip of Castiel’s cock. Cas cries out and bucks his hips away. “Too much! Too much!” His rough voice cracks into a tone resembling a sob and Dean yanks the candle away quick enough that some wax splatters on his hand as he reaches for Castiel’s cock to rub the sting away. The still hot wax smears under his hand and Cas bucks into Dean’s light grip. “Dean” Castiel’s voice quivers, as he reaches for his hunter.
Dean’s fingers retreat so quickly that Cas is almost surprised he didn’t hurt himself. “Seriously?”
“And to think I was gonna let you have your way with me tonight,” Dean says sadly as he turns to pull a pot out of the cupboard. He can almost hear Cas’ jaw drop and he smirks to himself. When he turns, Cas is standing only feet from him but his expression has grown dramatically somber.
“Dominant and submissive relationships” Cas turns his head to stare down at Dean like he’s asking stupid questions.
Typical.
“Cas, hold on a sec,” Dean pleads but Cas shakes his head, the ringing in his ears drowning out all sense of what Dean is trying to tell him.
The rough drag of their stubble has arousal spiking in Cas’ gut, the feeling foreign but entirely welcome as Dean’s work rough hands tickle over his back with more care than he’s experienced in years. He licks inside Dean’s mouth, the other man’s lips parting readily with a heady groan that goes straight to his thickening cock.
Cas groans and Dean vibrates with laughter. “You’re horrible. Cuddle-fish. Really?” Cas tries not to laugh. He really does. That pun is
“Why are you telling me this?” Dean asks, voice small and uncertain. He scrubs his hand over his mouth and pinches his nose as he tries to find just a little more strength. “He doesn’t want to talk to me.”
James’ brows arch comically and he shakes his head with an amused huff. “Only a few weeks? Damn. Usually, it takes years to learn to read each other like you two seem to be doing.”
Dean sucks in a breath and shakes his head. “It’s not the same.”
Sam and Benny bring the monks the meager rations they will be allowed on the journey. Those who prove to be adequate rowers will receive more to keep up their strength, and the rest will receive only enough to keep them from falling ill.
On a Saturday.
This monster dared put his hands on what belongs to Dean and affronted the gods by harming such a beautiful creature.
Dean shouts as Cas jabs forward, seeing stars as his prostate is battered over and over. The thick heat inside him, moving and stretching his already stretched rim has his legs shaking as Cas continues the steady motion. “Cas, gonna...gonna” He throws his head back in a silent scream as his body tenses and his cock feels as if his climax is exploding outward.
All too soon, Dean’s movements become sloppy and his legs tremble when Cas runs his palms down his thighs and they rock together slow enough to catch their breath.
“Let me take you to dinner then,” Dean offers suddenly and Cas’ heart stutters as he shakes his head.
Cas nods with a hum. “Sam rebuilt Eileen in a way.”
Cas nods and takes another sip through. “Refreshing, isn’t it?” Cas asks with just enough of a waver to his voice for Dean to know he’s trying to be brave.
Dean nods and takes Cas’ hand. “Aunt Karen, Uncle Bobby, this is Cas. My boyfriend.”
This is going to take
Uriel steps forward, the dark-skinned Alpha shows no sign of fear, and that only makes Castiel more agitated. “Winchester, Sir. I told you before, this is no place for an omega and now he…”
Dean nods and slides out of the booth, holding his hand out to Cas.
Cas straightens his shoulders with a choked off whine and Dean fixes him with a glare when he shifts as if about to stand. Cas swallows hard, eyes glued to the delicate lace covering Dean’s erection.
“Jessica,” the young woman answers and Cas nods as he begins to write.
Even Bobby seems impressed, a near impossibly feat.
“I’m proud of you too. I know this wasn’t easy for you.” Cas leans into Dean’s shoulder, not minding the lingering sweat emanating from underneath his jacket.
Dean prays, thinking “starting to worry” might be a huge understatement.
Cas lets out a burst of rough laughter and shakes his head. “No, ma’am. Promise.”
Mary nods but her expression remains troubled. “I’m sorry to hear that, I hope you’re at least close with your mom.”
“As if there is anyone else I’d want to talk to first about a new relationship,” Dean says, his tone warm but the way he rolls his eyes says another thing entirely.
circle around in his thoughts, each one more depressing than the last until Cas takes his chin and pries his lip from between his teeth.
Cas chuckles a little to himself at the memory. And it
“Maybe I don’t
Sam barks a laugh. “Noted” He calls as the door shuts behind the two men.
He can’t bear the idea of leaving his brothers behind. Gabriel would be so disappointed and he fears what might become of Inias if Cas were to disappear.
And especially not when he also knows that Gabriel is on a business trip just a two-hour drive from Austin.
“Mmmm, my lord,” Another voice says in response and Cas bites down on his clenched fist to keep himself from whimpering. He’s going to throw up, he’s certain of it. His stomach riots and twists, demanding he run far and fast from the two people whispering in the darkness.
day, Dean has to walk by the unkempt gardens and fight the tingling itch in his fingers to do something about the mess.
Cas sighs and shakes his head fondly as he settles back in.
“Good boy.” Cas presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s brow before kneeing his way back onto the bed with a bottle of lube in hand. How he managed to find it without Dean noticing is something that Dean isn’t going to think about.
Cas nods and Dean continues, letting the wax pool in Castiel’s belly button; causing the Angel to roll his hips with a hiss of pleasure. A sense of spellbound calm fills the room, neither man in a rush for this to end but both knowing it must eventually. The safety candle begins to burn low, little more than an inch above where Dean’s fingers pinch the end. Dean’s stomach clenches in excited concern as he drips the wax nearer and nearer to Castiel’s straining erection.
“Dean! No!” Cas cackles when Dean leans down to cup water in his hands and he dances away when Dean tries to soak him with it. Soon enough, they’re kicking water at each other and running over the wet sand to escape.
Dean nods, mind seemingly made up as he reaches for the phone. “Let me give Charlie a call and see where our schedule is at. When did you say this thing is?”
“Cas!” Dean shouts, trying to wiggle away from Cas’ hold before he comes. He wants to be good for his Angel and Cas told him not to come. Tears streak down his cheeks as he forces his impending orgasm back and Cas doesn’t stop his ministrations. “Cas, please. I can’t” Dean babbles. “Stop!” Dean shouts, fingers tightening their hold on the ropes holding his arms up and spread.
Cas hums but doesn’t say anything as he wraps his arms around Dean and holds him tight. The voices from the kitchen grow louder and Cas narrowly resists a groan as he recognizes Meg’s sultry voice added to the mix.
He steps around Benny, telling him to stand down with a simple brush of their shoulders, and lets himself be squeezed in the death grip formed by Gabriel’s open arms.
Benny chuckles and shakes his head as Gabriel holds a hand over his heart and leans back on his chair with a laugh.
The instinctive fear of intimate touch seems misplaced with Dean hardening underneath him.
“Woulda thought this one would have told you not to call me ‘sir’,” Rufus grumbles as he shoots a glare at Cas.
How did this happen!
“Do you know what my father told me? In a brief moment of lucidity when Lucifer possessed my body?” Castiel questions and Dean shakes his head minutely. He has never mentioned a word of this to Dean and the hunter is clearly eager to know. “My Father told me that he made each of to be exactly who we are. He made your soul to compliment my grace. He gave us a precious gift, something few of his creations share, and he begged me not to waste it”
Dean arches and brow before his expression turns scandalized. “You’ve never played, have you?” He questions as if Cas has committed a dire crime.
“Castiel is fine, Balthazar.” Inias snags Cas’ elbow and draws him a step back.
Cas pinches a frown. “What about your grandparents? Samuel and Deanna, right?”
James nods and then shakes his head. “For this, you’d stay dressed as long as you’re comfortable. I wouldn’t be touching any of your intimate places, just arms and legs mainly as I guided Castiel in how to tie you.”
that.” His grin turns more devilish with each word until Cas is sure that somehow their father will be able to sense the impending perversion of the sacred holiday. Luckily, no one at this table would agree with the old bastard.
Clarence?
Dean shrugs and gives him a thoughtful smile. “My wager still stands.”
He turns the burner under the sauce back on after giving the stove a quick wipe down and then fills a pot with water for the pasta.
“I love you” Dean blurts out before his better sense can trample the words and bury them where they might never be found. A laugh bubbles out of him as he turns to take in Castiel’s confused expression. “I love you” He repeats, cupping Castiel’s jaw and stroking a thumb over the Angel’s stubbled cheek.
“You two are perfect for each other!” Sam cackles and nearly doubles over as a small laugh escapes Castiel.
Cas takes a shuddering breath and shakes his head as he pulls his hand away and adjusts the pillow under his head. He doesn’t meet Dean’s eyes when he opens his mouth to speak. “Food play, suspension and, uh, branding.”
Dean swallows hard. The resignation laced in Cas’s tone says more than his words and Dean doesn’t know what to do with that. He clears his throat and risks a glance toward the passenger seat. Cas is staring steadily out the window with his chin tilted toward the sky as if the waning light of day will somehow make everything whole again. “So, this, uh, burger place. Where am I going?” He flinches a smile when Cas’s head whips around to face him, blue eyes wide.
with him since I was twelve. My devotion to him, our devotion to each other, spans a time period approaching two thousand years. I could never hurt him. I am his to do with as he will, for as long as he wants me.”
Dean shakes his head as if casting off a spell and he turns his baleful green eyes toward Castiel.
Time passes, he’s sure of it, but he couldn’t tell you how much. He’s barely conscious of people in uniform coming and going, bagging things from the kitchen and taking them away. Of the stretcher leaving, much heavier than when it came.
“Because, Cas,” he says, “this is the easiest way into the party.” Dean fiddles with Cas’ bowtie despite the tremble in his fingers. Seeing Cas like this is doing things to him and Dean cannot stop his cock from taking an interest. “Besides, you’re damn hot dressed up like this.”
“Yeah, we’ve been living together for a few years,” Cas answers easily.
He doesn’t date.
Cas opens to him easily, already slick and ready as Dean slips inside as slowly as his patience can muster. He doesn’t think he’ll ever tire of this. Either him inside Cas or Cas taking him apart piece by piece until he’s nothing more than a whining puddle of need… Dean isn’t going to let this go for anything.
“I need to get ready for work,” Cas finally says before letting out a heavy breath.
Dean lets out a sudden bark of laughter and shakes his head when he can’t stop. “We are something else, aren’t we?” His laughter increases even as he tugs Cas to his feet and guides him toward the bed. “Can’t do anything normal.”
“I am as well as I can be. And you?” Cas answers and turns the question on Inias. The shy smile he receives in return is enough of an answer.
His stomach coils tightly when Cas seems to understand and presses Dean down slowly. Dean lets out a low moan of appreciation and Cas’ cock twitches hard at the vibrations.
“Thanks, Benny,” Cas whispers as he lets the man lead him toward Charlie.
Dean shrugs and gently slaps Cas’ thigh through the blankets as he gets up. “Of course.” Dean steps around the bed and leans forward to draw Cas into a chaste kiss as he pries the empty mug from his fingers. “If you hurry, breakfast will still be hot.” He turns to walk away, leaving Cas behind once again to appreciate the view. “And yes, there is more coffee,” Dean throws over his shoulder with a playful wink.
Dean breathes heavily at the sudden release of pressure but his stubborn erection flags immediately and Dean buries his face in Cas’ shoulder. “M’sorry,” Dean mumbles and Cas tuts at him while rubbing soothing circles over Dean’s spine.
Pride bubbles in his chest when he glances at Dean and notices the pleasure gleaming in those green eyes as he watches Sam shake Cas’ hand with a smile.
“Yeah?” Dean whispers, cautiously tightening the hold he has on Cas’ shoulders.
He shakes his head and drops his chin in resignation as Benny nudges him forward.
“Good luck, Sam.” Cas nods.
Dean lets out a heavy sigh and hangs his head before pinching his brow with his greasy fingers. “I thought I was making a friend out here, finally, but now he won’t answer my calls or return my texts.”
Or maybe because of the money in his pocket.
“No, you just always wear a size too big.” Balthazar crosses his arms over his chest and stares.
The knots look far more complicated than anything Dean has done, he’s never bound someone for any reason other than to keep them prisoner. This is something entirely different and his cock starts to harden in his pants as he considers how good it would feel to have Cas’ fingers brushing against his bare skin as he’s bound.
Cas shakes his head against her shoulder. “Didn’t need to. He made his opinion clear enough.”
Dean knows he shouldn’t make assumptions, especially regarding sexuality, but he is not in the mood to give his higher thought processes a chance to rule his actions.
His lungs heave even though not breathing sounds like a wonderful idea.
“We’re here!” Garth cheerfully announces as Benny exits the car and opens the back door for Cas and Dean.
“Dean!” Cas gasps, finally recognizing who he’s collided with. He reaches for the man and ducks his chin. “Sorry, sorry, I’m sorry,” he says the words like a plea and his fingers tighten in the loose shirt Dean wears.
Tonight, he will stand witness to the execution of his first love.
Butterflies swarm in Dean’s gut as he pieces together the few words he knows of Cas’ language. Dean could fly over the moon with giddy delight.
“Hungry?” Dean asks, pressing light kisses to the back of Cas’ neck.
Cas nods with a frown. “He is... protective.”
Sam doesn’t need him anymore.
“That’s right. You said you were on an internship in Herculaneum?” Mary asks and Dean lets out a relieved breath, hoping that she’s not going to drill Cas on something uncomfortable. “What did you do there?”
Dean laughs nervously, abs clenching with in response to the tickling touch of Castiel’s stubble dragging lightly over his skin. Cas kisses his way down before taking Dean’s soft cock into his mouth.
Castiel’s eyes blow wide and his stomach drops. “What are you talking about?”
“Are you sure you want this? We can stop right now.” Cas continues to stare in a way that would have made Dean uneasy only a few months ago but now he basks in the sensation.
Dean glances over to see Cas staring at his phone with a furrowed brow. “Hey, what’s up?” He asked, curiosity getting the best of him.
“Cas,” Dean whines and rolls his head at the sickly-sweet gesture. Cas snorts a laugh and scoots back to his side of the car but their hands remain tangled together between them until Dean needs to make the turn into the restaurant parking lot. “We’re here.”
“What do you want, Dean?” Cas pauses, resting his chin on Dean’s hip as he stares up at his hunter. His hand still pumps Dean’s hard length slowly, without any real commitment to get him off or even to drag him to the edge of orgasm. Simply a slow tease meant to torment.
“How do you know Bobby?” Cas asks, reclaiming the dropped fishing pole with a furious blush when Rufus eyes him critically.
As long as he gets his cheap coffee without scornful judgment, he’s happy.
to flit across his consciousness.
They look little like the scared men in brown robes who volunteered to be taken into slavery. They have all changed, found their strength, and adapted in ways that Dean can only be proud of.
Cas’s eyes brighten and he nods eagerly. “Coffee would be lovely.”
“Come,” Dean orders and the blond-haired man frowns as he pushes to his feet.
Nora scoffs and waves a dismissive hand. “I was already planning on letting him out an hour ago, but he wanted to learn the register. Most trainees only work two-hour shifts for the first week.”
“Oh, shit, lemme get that,” Dean says, hurrying to his feet to get the door so Cas doesn’t have to juggle yet another thing.
