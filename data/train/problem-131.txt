John walked inside with trepidation, something about the boy rubbing him the wrong way. This entire scene reeked of something sinister, leaving him to wonder if he'd knowingly walked right into the lion's den. He felt no comfort from the fact that Sherlock was somewhere close by. Alphas were of no use to an Omega when they were in peril. They were of no use to anyone at all, really. Not unless you were an Omega in heat who needed their knot.
Ichabod stormed off down the hallway, leaving an enraged John standing in the middle of the bathroom. He could feel anger bubbling up inside his chest, traveling through his veins until every part of him was alight with it. His fists clenched so hard, he was sure his nails were digging deep into the skin of his palms. Who the hell his father thought he was, John wasn't sure, but the words he'd just screamed echoed in the walls of the boy's mind, strengthening his resolve to stay as far away from married life as he could. This entire thing was a hoax, a veil that these people are putting over their heads to get the illusion that it'll actually be the key to solving all their problems. Well, it won't. John wasn't stupid enough to believe that, and he hated his dad enough that he'd still protest this wedding even if it was their salvation . . .
The thought of his friend associating with Mycroft in any way, shape, or form had John stewing in anger. "What the hell do you want with my friend?"
He could vaguely register his hands being placed in different positions, one on his chest, the other on his stomach. His face was cradled and the one touching him said something he didn't understand. When the message that he wasn't paying attention was received, the person put their forehead up against his, a familiar scent permeating his nostrils. Something about the aroma made him come back to himself, allowing him to finally see the man in front of him.
Emotion flitted over Mycroft's face before he schooled it into his usual mask. "All in due time, my dear boy."
The boy smirked. "Moriarty is a man who gets what he wants; no exceptions, no mercy. He's ruthless, predatory"-he paused to smile at John-"sexually aggressive."
The men in the doorway shared a look, followed by a chuckle from the elder. "I knew something like this would happen, though I must say, they all far superceded my expectations by introducing a murder to our little circus."
? John won't last a second in Jim's presence. He'll chew him up, spit him out, and then I'll have to kill him. I don't want blood on my hands, brother. It stains."
Huh? Oh, fine. We'll just leave it up to the story to do that for the you. You people certainly know how to make a narrator feel special, don't you? Cretins.
Except there wasn't one. Not the one John was expecting anyway. No, this one didn't involve physical violence. It was rather passive aggressive in nature, a rare thing for an Alpha, though Sherlock and his brother tended to fight that way. A silent battle was being waged in this room, challenged by Moriarty and accepted by John. The boy whose name John didn't know stood beside him. He could feel the kid's body tense, John's peripherals picking up on the slight tinge of weariness plaguing the poor Omega's features. Yes, the boy was definitely an Omega. John could sniff out his kind like nobody else. It was a shame that he allowed an Alpha to bully him in such a way. John and Greg really were alone with this Omegist thing, weren't they?
Sunlight peeked through the curtains of John's bedroom window, yellow slivers falling on his face as he stared up at the ceiling. Despite his current train of thought, every bone in his body was so relaxed that he melted into his ivory sheets, lashes drooping from lack of sleep. Fatigue might have won the war it waged on him, had John been anything other than the stubborn bastard he knew himself to be. Luckily, he was just as headstrong at that particular moment as he ever was, which was probably the reason he suddenly found himself using the excuse morning provided to stumble out of bed in a half-assed attempt to stay on his own two feet, all the while thinking of how great a world it would be if only he'd resisted getting drunk out of his mind the night before.
Before the boy had a chance to construct a counter argument, his food arrived on sparkling white china dishes, color made beautiful by the dim light above their heads. It almost seemed like a cruel joke to order the pan-seared salmon, but how could he resist? It might have been Pontius' last meal, but it was also Greg's favorite, and damned if he was going to let that stop him from enjoying it.
His father's head peeked out as he moved his gaze from left to right, sniffing the air as if he sensed an alien presence he wasn't quite sure was really there. He breathed in and expelled slowly, growling slightly. Whatever he detected from the hall was a secret John would never find out, as his father turned and shut the door without a word. John immediately disappeared into his own bedroom and sighed in relief when he was alone, happy that he'd managed to escape such a harrowing situation with his balls still intact.
Of all the people who have wronged him, none of them stood out in his mind as prominently as Pontius Watson. Hypocrite. Wife beater. Child molester. The one who told an 8-year-old John that it was okay to touch himself as long as uncle Ponty was allowed to watch. A beast. A demon. An
," John said the words as if they were distasteful. "Your entire purpose is to make my kind miserable. You breed us, then make us forfeit our freedom and take care of you for the rest of our lives. I won't have it."
"The boy you probably thought was Sherlock. That's actually his twin brother. I asked him to bring you here so that I could have a word with you. We both knew you'd think he was Sherlock. However, we weren't sure you'd actually come. Glad to see you did."
"Alright, enough of this," John interrupted, trying not to roll his eyes at the nauseating stench of Alpha pride. "I've had just about all I can take from the both of you. First of all, how did you get here, Sherlock? You weren't in the limo."
The shaky legs that barely managed to hold up the body of John Watson finally gave way beneath him, causing him to fall to the floor in one semi-big pile of limbs as he tried to contain the panic attack destroying whatever remained of his self-control.
Mycroft rolled his eyes. "Don't be such a baby, John. So I manipulated you. Don't feel so special. I do it to everyone."
Greg grinned. There was something funny about a slightly amused Mycroft feigning disgust at his "date's" table manners. He could have fooled anyone with that scowl, but Lestrade somehow knew better. It was as if some invisible force gave him an insight into the man's mind that nobody else would ever share. It surprised Greg because that kind of intimacy was only shared by an Alpha and his Omega, so how he carried that ability was . . . was . . .
. I'll give you the additional 500,000. I'll be damned if I'm going to give up the only thing stopping the Holmes' family from destroying everything I've worked so hard for. But make no mistake when I say that he'll never get his hands on that boy. You can try to feed me that bullshit about some stranger killing Pontius, but I know it was him. I've forked over enough of my time and resources to that man. After this, our business is done!"
John slapped his hand over his mouth, mortified at the small gasp that slipped from his lips. His entire body shook and he couldn't quite contain his uneven breathing long enough to get himself in control. Sweat dampened his clothes and hair, and he realized with horror that his Alpha father would smell the Omega's fear from inside the bedroom, a fear which was given voice when Ichabod's head shot up toward the door in surprise, the anger on his face making John retread into the shadows, holding himself steady in anticipation. Ichabod slowly came to the door, each step sounding like the quiet stalking of a predator.
"Cold compresses!" the other man admonished, outstretched fingers pointing to the sky. "An ice bag, a slab of meat. Something!"
"Negative," Ichabod replied. "The Holmes's still haven't provided an amount regarding the Omega token we'll be receiving as payment for the loss of our son."
The funny thing, though? None of this would be presently happening if it wasn't for the jackass on bended knee beside him. Once upon a time, John could have taken one glimpse at those dark locks and piercing blue eyes and retched in disgust, but now? As much as every part of his mind wanted to hate him, all John could feel when he looked at the bastard was love. It filled him with unwanted admiration and idolatry, the unmistakable scent of his Alpha making the inner Omega within him purr in contentment . . . asshole.
* Ahem . . . before one can explain John's freak out over his impending marriage, one must first go back to the day he was born. As some of you may have deduced from the previous chapter, talk of such an event has been whispered in the ears of every single member of both families since John and his betrothed-
"You know, I can't help but notice your distaste for the idea of sharing your company with me. I'd have thought it was my choice of restaurants, but something tells me the scowl present on your face has something to do with me being a Holmes. This is about John, isn't it?"
In all honesty, this has got to be the best story I've ever written. It's not perfect, but it's good enough that it would be a shame to leave it unfinished. So, with that being said, if you're all still out there somewhere and would like for me to continue this story, just let me know. It'll take me some time to revisit some plot points, as I'd forgotten where I was trying to go with it, but the juices are flowing and the muses are all over me like stank on shit so I'm guessing it won't be much of a problem to pull out the old writing cap again. Even if nobody responds, I'll probably still finish it on my own time. I just won't post it.
A sudden and violent need to compose himself without the watchful gaze of Mycroft Holmes analyzing his every move went unmet as some part of his consciousness registered the familiar clicking of neatly polished shoes approaching his huddled form with deliberate steps. It took all of two seconds for the man to stare disapprovingly down at John as if he were a parent scolding their child's unacceptable behavior, making the boy glare back up at him with hatred.
John froze in the hallway when he heard the whispered hiss off his father's voice carry from the master bedroom all the way to where he now stood. It was always like this: his father going off on someone over the phone regarding matters that were of no interest to his only son. However, while this was usually seen as the norm, something in Ichabod's tone had John following the sound until he was directly in front of the room. The door was ajar, giving the boy just enough space to peer inside.
-falls on her fat ass, apparently. My . . . this is, er . . . this is embarrassing. It's okay, though! While we may be here with our lovely John, he is in the past, and therefore cannot see us.
Sitting on a chair, both arms resting on the ends, was John Watson, staring defiantly at the clock on the wall as it ticked closer and closer to the dreaded time when the Holmes brothers would return to once again wreak havoc on his life. He could feel every muscle in his body twitch with a mixture of irritation and excitement, unsure if he was 100% disgusted with the idea of being so close to Mycroft's infuriating little brother.
It seemed there were many mysterious surrounding the lives of the Watsons and the Holmes', and one way or another, John was going to find them out, and when he did, he would make sure to burn the entire foundation of their families to the ground.
The fact that such an event took place on the very day that the adult version of their "play date" was about to . . . take place, could be seen as either fate, or a practical joke done by the most comedic of gods. No matter the reason, this day would always be an important one for both the boys and the reader, as this marks the beginning of the "Johnlock" relationship; in the past, as well as the present.
John tried to hide his panic. "But that's impossible. I made those cookies, and I can assure you, I'm not the one that killed the guy."
followed his lead and glanced at John with a smug expression, lips forming a smirk different from that of Pontius Watson, less unpleasant but far more obscene. Whereas Pontius looked at John like he wanted to devour him alive, this person looked at him the way any Alpha looks at an Omega: like the person before him was inferior. The rage John could feel building when Sherlock walked through the door morphed into defiance as he took a competitive stance. The other man noticed the change and his smirk grew, making John feel as though he were looking into the depths of his very soul.
It took the Omega some time to answer. He was too busy fuming over the way the older man looked at his house. While the Watson's weren't as well off as the Holmes', he couldn't help but feel a certain pride in the fact that each and every single member of his family worked their bums off for what they had, and seeing an Alpha who was born into money look at John's dwelling as a place of inferiority made him want to scream.
"Breathe with me, my Omega," Sherlock responded, holding the other boy's face in his long fingers. John breathed. "Good. Keep your eyes on me, John. Don't go. Stay with me."
your problems. Take them to someone else 'cause I don't give a shit! I am done being treated like garbage. There's a new Johnny in town, and guess what? He's someone who's going to stay single and delight in the downfall his relationship status brings you. Get used to fighting, ladies and gentleman, because Johnny boy has left the building!"
"Boys!" Agatha exclaimed, shock slowly fading enough to where she could speak. "I smell cigarette smoke! Were you two being naughty again?"
Ichabod's laughter breezed through John's memory uncomfortably, making the nauseous Omega stumble over his own two feet on his trip to the front door. Ripping it open, he threw himself over the front of his porch and vomited into his mother's flower bed. Relieving himself of all his stress was no easy task, but his body refused to let up, forcing his disgust up and out of his mouth until he found himself dry heaving to his own disturbing thoughts. Shaking profusely, John waited until the feeling in his throat and stomach lessened before sinking to the floor in a panic, trying unsuccessfully to cease his rapid breathing.
This was all Mycroft's fault. If he hadn't called the previous night just to drag Greg into the mess his world had become, John would have easily fallen into the warm embrace of unconsciousness without so much as batting an eyelash. But that would be too simple, wouldn't it? Those damn Holmes' found life much more satisfying when they were destroying a member of the Watson family. Heathens, the whole lot of them.
How could he have not noticed the other day that Sherrinford wasn't Sherlock? The reaction he'd had to seeing someone that resembled his Alpha was nothing compared to the pure lust coursing through him now. It must have been the smell. Sherrinford didn't have a smell. Sherlock did, though, and it took every ounce of self-control John had not to bend over like a good little bitch and rub his needy hole all over the Alpha's crotch.
. But how does an Omega say no to an arranged marriage that not even an Alpha could break free from? The answer was simple . . . they couldn't.
Had John believed in telepathy, he would have thought his dear old uncle had read his mind, because it was at that exact moment that the monster turned his eyes, slick as a serpent's, to John's, the corner of his foul lips drifting upwards into a sly smile that the younger man wanted to slap right off his face.
Mycroft's expression was intense, too intense for John to think the man's involvement in Greg's life was something he could just will away. "Absolutely nothing."
John's forehead creased with resolve. There was no way in hell that was ever gonna happen. While he had no choice but to be subjected to a dinner surrounded by Alphas, he'd rather die than waste his life with one. When those boys came through his door, he would be polite, yet firm when he told them that he didn't plan on ever giving Sherlock what the world tells him he's supposed to. He'd marry him, sure. He was left with no other option. However, he'd be damned if he was going to sleep with him, cook his dinner, bear his pups, or further inflate his already giant ego. He was an Omega. He was strong, independent, and he didn't need Sherlock to take care of him. He didn't need his money, his influence, or his physical prowess. All he needed was himself.
in wonderment did nothing but suffocate John. Even now, he could feel the dark energy from the place sucking the life out of him, and he couldn't help but think that, should he move into the Holmes,' he'd be in the same position, only that destination would surely kill him for good.
John whipped his head to stare at Sherlock, horrified. Sherlock looked back, rolling his eyes. "Don't tell me you haven't noticed. I thought you were smarter than that."
Kneeling at the feet of a damsel in distress, he placed his hands on her thighs in what he hoped was a soothing gesture, concern and unmovable devotion shining through his eyes. "Are you quite alright, my darling Agatha?"
Angry tones started to fill the Watson household. John sat and listened without saying a word, sipping from his wine glass without a care in the world. It wasn't that he didn't care about his family . . . he just didn't care about his family. They could scream and yell all they wanted. In the end, everyone in that room had a hand in the ridiculous marriage that he was being forced into, and as far as he was concerned, they could all rip each other to shreds until the cows came home. The only thing he wanted in return was a promise from the Almighty himself that memories of their existence would never come back to darken his days again.
John looked bewildered, but took the offered hand just the same, reveling in how soft the Alpha's skin was. "Uh, J-John W-Watson."
Before he even knew what he was doing, John destroyed everything in that cramped little space, breaking mirrors and ripping both the shower curtain and the rod from their place above the tub. Taking the rod, he banged at the tiles on the wall until all his rage was spent, causing him to fall to the floor in a pitiful heap of misery and despair. Ignoring the bleeding knuckles aching from his abuse, he slowly put his head in his hands and wept, hating the tears that trickled down his face. They were nothing more than a reminder of his weakness and his failure, salty badges of emotional truth that laughed and mocked him for his inability to control his own emotions.
John opened up the bathroom door, looking at his father in confusion. "You really were banging on this thing for a while, weren't ya?"
John scoffed. "Ah, 'Course you did. Anyway, it doesn't matter. As fascinating as it is to stand here and watch you two clowns fight like babies over something I don't think I'll ever understand, and as much as I'd love to find out why it is I'm here exactly, the only thing I give a damn about right now is finding me mate. Now, are two going to come with me up this walkway here, or am I going it alone?"
Instead of doing all that, he somehow opted for looking stupidly at his uncle while a transformation took place that his own eyes couldn't believe even as he stared at the man with lids wide open. Coughing and sputtering, followed by an overthrown chair and a couple shuddering breaths lead John to believe that he was in the process of witnessing a murder. He didn't know how or why, but the thought suddenly occurred to him that his uncle, someone who he hated with an intensity akin to the contempt Satan has for the Lord up above, was poisoned.
The cab stopped in front of Angelo’s. John paid the cabbie and the two males got out; they went in and the waiter seated them. They both flipped through the menu and the waiter came up to fill their glasses with water.
“Guess that's his name.” Sherlock replied before latching onto John's neck, suckling at it and causing the smaller man to moan.
He jolted and glanced at the time. It was indeed eight fifty-seven. He closed his browser, made sure his desk and himself were presentable before he made his way to the door. He ushered in his client and made his way to his desk, asking his usual questions.
John stared at the screen perplexed, keeping it in his hand as he tuned back into the woman's rambling, which was something having to do with being sure her neighbour was stealing her dogs food and giving it to aliens. The phone vibrated.
He made his way down the body and lowered his head, his ears ringing with the deep, enthralling moan that escaped the teen. He slowly worked the others erection...
Sherlock pulled back, his hair messy and wild, his eyes glittering fiercely as he muttered out, “My brother is the government. I can make him pull strings to hide this until next year if it's needed. After all, I have leverage against him.”
John didn't like smoking, he found it a disgusting habit to say the least, but this man somehow made it alluring. He watched the smoke as it blew from his nose and the glittering eyes focused on his own, a smirk twitching at the corners of his full lips.
“Oh right, food.” He let out a sigh and entered the kitchen, grabbing the dog's dish, filled it with food and placed it down on the floor. He exited the kitchen as Gladstone started to eat. He turned on the telly hoping something good would be on today. He flipped through the channels and was hoping his phone would go off, but Sherlock was probably working on an experiment or something.
He looked up at Sherlock whom was standing at the window with his violin in his grasp, whom then turned to look at him with a cocked brow.
John let out a small groan and a tongue made it's way into his mouth. Sherlock climbed onto the desk and braced himself on the armrests of John's chair, sliding closer until he was in the therapist's lap. John moved away quickly and gasped out, “Sherlock! I'm your therapist, you're a minor, and I can loose my job and get thrown in jail!”
“Have a nice evening, Dr. Watson.” The receptionist said. John turned and smiled, responding, “You too.”
John stared at him and sighed, "Look, I'm just doing my job. What do you want me to say? You can just leave? Well, you can if you want."
He sighed, glared at the ground as he contemplated following the obnoxious git or just going home. He weighed both options and decided he'd rather follow this eccentric teen than go to his lonely apartment with a bag of crisps to watch crap telly.
I hesitated. There did not seem to be a great deal to say. "The maid, Margaret, appeared to be in quite a state. Do you think it is of any relevance?"
"I have followed my heart," Georgiana said flatly. "I don't believe God will judge me harshly for that. I would have thought you of all people would understand, Nicholas."
It was after midnight by the time we returned to Baker Street. We let ourselves in quietly, careful not to wake Mrs Hudson, and crept upstairs to the sitting room.
"No. But when I asked him whether Lyndale knew in advance that Pinet had an interest in cameos, he must have put two and two together on the spot, and decided to lie to us, and go in for a spot of blackmailing instead." He folded up Pinet's letter and returned it to its envelope. "A minor point, but one always likes to tie up loose ends."
I took a deep breath, and plunged into the gathering storm. "It's nothing, really, I assure you. It's merely - sometimes, when we're in public, and I touch your shoulder without thinking, or smile at you in a particular fashion, or - oh, a thousand other unconscious gestures! - you look at me in a way that turns me cold. And this, even though in many cases they are things I have been doing since we first met, and things to which you never objected, before Christmas."
"It seems to me to be the impossible crime! There are far too many witnesses, and even an expert lockpick cannot do his work in the blink of an eye."
The younger Mr Lyndale greeted us much more quietly, shaking us each by the hand with a few murmured words. He did not blush and stammer, as Mr Willis had suggested he would, but perhaps that was because we weren't young ladies in search of a husband.
Over breakfast he read through his stack of newspapers, as usual, while his toast grew cold. As usual I ate it before it was too late, and replaced it with another slice.
My chest was painfully constricted. I struggled to comprehend the exact significance of his words. Did he mean to suggest that I could no longer accompany him on his cases? Even worse, that one of us should move out of Baker Street? Or even - my heart clenched at the mere thought - could he possibly be suggesting that we should never see each other again?
"Quite so, Mr Lyndale," said Holmes, which meant nothing at all, and then changed the subject. "What did these cameos look like, precisely?"
"Oh yes, they were very thorough indeed," said Lyndale, with the satisfaction of the honest citizen who sees the forces of the law in the enthusiastic performance of their duty.
At this point the coach came to a halt at the Haymarket. We climbed down, and walked slowly back to the Gordons, Holmes' arm in mine. I knew that the risk I would take that night weighed as heavily on his mind as on mine - indeed probably more so - and I tried to entertain him by recounting the stories of some of the recent popular literary works to come out of Edinburgh. This gave him the opportunity to scoff at tales of cut-throat pirates and Robin Hood's merry men, and thus we both passed a very agreeable half an hour.
It struck me as a little odd that Lyndale was sharing so much detail with us, but Holmes did always invite confidence. It was one of the characteristics that made him so successful at his chosen profession.
Holmes asked him a few more innocuous questions, but nothing interesting emerged from the answers, as far as I could tell. Holmes thanked him, and we left the soup kitchen.
I was grinning, enjoying the rather incredible image of Holmes tending to something as boring as watermelons. "Do you really think that's very likely, my dear fellow?"
He winced at that. "I feel heartless, nevertheless. My reason tells me that it is wrong to risk ruining your life through my foolishness, even when I am perfectly happy to risk my own life. My reason will always win, Watson, no matter what my heart holds."
"I know I have no right to ask anything of the sort, Watson, but I wish - I would like - that is to say, I find I cannot bear the thought of letting you go into danger tonight with your last thoughts of me being that I am a heartless bastard."
My mind raced, scrabbling desperately for the words to derail his mind from these inexorable tracks, but I knew that I could not, for that would have been the equivalent of convincing him he did not love me.
"It's quite an antique, I take it?" Holmes asked, stepping back to view the cabinet in its entirety.
He was not in the least surprised to see me, of course. He caught my arm, and pulled me into the deepest shadows beside the wall. Following his gaze down the long shadowy lane, I saw a short stout female form disappear around the corner.
He took my breath away. It was one of those rare glimpses of his soul that made up for every unconsciously cruel comment or slight his brutally honest nature inflicted on me. Indeed, they made up for everything a thousand times over, without difficulty.
After a minute he turned away from the cabinet and cast a quick, searching glance around the rest of the room.
"Less than a year ago," he said readily. "We have only lived here a few months, like most of our neighbours."
"Don't try to move, my love," he said in a gentler voice, seeing my return to consciousness. He was kneeling beside me, pressing something into my shoulder, which burned unbearably. It was night-time, and the ground beneath me was cold, damp, mossy stone. Slowly, memories returned to me of the late-night assignation we had spied upon in the kirkyard, and the subsequent chase through the town, culminating in my being shot in this grimy courtyard.
"Surely the servants—" He broke off, shaking his head and looking chagrined. "Oh, I don't know what to think! All of my servants have been in my employ for several years at least, and I am extremely reluctant to point the finger at any of them."
"You also have many business interests here in London, I understand," Holmes said, and though his tone was casual, something in his posture told me the question was not.
"Oh?" I said, for I had not noticed anything of the sort between them. Indeed, I was not even quite sure if he meant what I thought he did. "You mean to say—?"
Monsignor Pinet's eyes widened. He looked as though he were trying to decide whether the comment should be taken as some sort of subtle insinuation against himself.
He laid aside the scrapbook. For a moment he sat staring into the distance, his gaze thoughtful. Then he glanced down at me.
We spent the evening reading by the fire. The hour was still early when Holmes caught my attention by laying aside his book and standing up to bank the fire for the night.
Father Briggs shook his head. "It was the first time I'd been in the house, so I'm not sure what was usual and what wasn't. I don't generally go to those social events. I was only roped in because another friar was ill."
Our first port of call was Miss Lyndale's married sister, Mrs Spencer. Our visit was brief, and we left the Spencers' house in Montague Square with righteous anger and bitterness ringing in our ears.
I retired directly to my room, for I had slept poorly on the sleeper, one of our fellow passengers being a very noisy snorer.
Instead of the explosion of ire he was trying teasingly to provoke, I found myself grinning foolishly.
I felt fingers on my breast and Holmes withdrew my pocket watch and held it out briefly to a patch of moonlight to read it. He swore softly. "Three minutes to eleven. That was all too brief an interval."
I opened one eye to give him a baleful look. "Holmes, I swear, if you are thinking that you are looking forward to years of correlating my ale consumption with my growing waistline - "
My own taste in music runs along different lines, and I looked around myself as we waited, enjoying the music without letting it take over my mind. The church was considerably more ornate than those I was familiar with: decorated with the trappings of Popery, as my father would have said. We could not see the organist; he was presumably hidden away somewhere up in the choir loft.
Briggs frowned. "If you're looking for Miss Georgiana Lyndale on behalf of her family, you may as well save yourself the trouble," he said bluntly.
His lips were pressed together in a thin line, whether from discomfiture or merely because he was deep in thought, I could not tell. In fact, I had no idea at all what was passing through his mind.
We had met Georgiana Lyndale only once, at the Lyndale residence the day after the cameo theft. I remembered only a rather quiet girl, and a clear antipathy between herself and her sister. And Holmes had predicted her "elopement", of course. But a thief? I was amazed.
Despite their knowledge of the situation, of its origin and development, the measures imposed by the government became a shock. Looked like Mycroft had moved the King, or rather the Queen outright, on his chessboard.
Accurately, without haste, did Sherlock put his violin into the case, rubbed the bow with rosin and placed it into the designated compartment next to the violin. He locked the case and turned an unhappy face to John.
At the very end of the report Sherlock saw that the laboratory was requesting permission to produce λ-Panther and tentatively informing that it won’t hurt to test the respective version of the vaccine on two more dozen volunteers.
were nothing short of mocking, as such prefixes were habitual to naming virus strains, not vaccines (it went without saying that mass production would require renaming). And it was the last version that proved most efficient. All the volunteers who received different vaccines were kept under 24-hour medical surveillance since administration. They were tangled with sensors for measuring blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulse and all things nice, as they were of help to the virologists without any special equipment. Cruel as it was, the situation was extreme.
Transcript of records by Sherlock and John with notes, where applicable. Sherlock’s text in italics, John’s in bold italics.
With his eyes burrowing into Sherlock’s back, John noticed that his index was still up. Then the conversation came to an end. It had lasted no longer than three minutes, which in terms of the two brothers was equivalent to a full-fledged, hour-long ordinary people’s talk, for they could hear not just the words, but also the subtext and breathing along the line. Knowing each other since childhood, they made sense even of silence.
Only when Sherlock had settled on his cot and relaxed a bit, he was suddenly struck by a thought that had not yet occurred to him before, — probably gone astray amidst his Palace, —
“Mycroft promised to send whatever we need through his minions, once a week. We only have to make a list. We will hold on. Go and talk to Mrs. Hudson, you’ll make a better job of it.”
“Indeed, John, that would have been stupid if it weren’t you to say it”, — Sherlock uttered, as he placed his palm against the screen in sync with John, peering into the lens. — “I love you, John.”
They were sitting on the sofa, against each other, holding hands for dear life, afraid to let go even for a second. John was taking in Sherlock’s eyes and saw determination there. Determination to attempt confronting the new plague, to throw all his genius and that Mind Palace of his into curbing the emergent danger that threatened to engulf the world they knew.
Now that was a good idea, — John thought, as he reached for his own one. As soon as the system got loaded, an incoming call window appeared in the bottom right corner of the screen.
Could everything just pass by? Could Mycroft’s scientists not have brought that virus on them? Could they manage to develop the vaccine before the threat turns global and boils over the plagued district? Could, might…
Upon arrival, they were accommodated at comfortable isolated boxes, equipped with everything required for unmanned surveillance after vaccination. From one side, a box was fully transparent and had a small window with built-in gloves, for the staff to insert their hands and perform whatever manipulations that might be necessary, and, certainly, for visual monitoring. Individually, they had passed physical examinations, as thorough as those could only be, and by the evening they were left alone, for the observations to be commenced early in the morning.
“Probably because I love you, bloody bullhead, and won’t survive the second time if something happens to you, God forbid! Either we go together, or we stay here. Together. End of dispute!”
“Don’t you utter a word, John! I read in your face better than in an open book! You can’t tell anyone. Do you hear me? It’s only a handful of people who are informed at the moment. You know it only because Mycroft called me, and I decided that I have no right to keep secrets from you. Just think what your words would lead to. As a minimum, they won’t believe you, or would still hold doubts. As a maximum, you’ll incite panic, which may hamper what Mycroft is doing. He needs time! He spoke of a couple of weeks, could be a month. Within this time his geeks must sort things out, or at least outline a plan of action. And I’ll be indeed more useful there, with them, than lounging here at Baker Street.”
It was unprecedented. A total lockdown. Total isolation. Their minds went blank at once. There was no way to make forecasts, or schemes, or diagrams of what was going to come out of it. The virus is not something to handle with logic or statistic analysis. It spreads in leaps and bounds, sporadically, especially with a virulence that high. Both the genius who had read virtually all books and reference on virology, and the army doctor understood that all. Not that it made them feel easier.
With the experienced vision of a lover and a doctor, he noticed how chaped and peeling they were — as a result of fever along with Sherlock’s habit of worrying his alluring lower lip with his teeth. His pert curls had withered a bit, albeit with no detriment to their bouncy glory.
“Ironically, a month ago,” spoke Sherlock with regained composure, carefully weighing word by word, “they were informed that something weird was going on in South Africa. People are dying. Virtually burning down, within a week or a week and a half, their skins going black right before death. Apparently, in torturous throes of pain. All corpses were found twisted in an unnatural manner. And no, there was no one to mutilate them. Witnesses say that a person is suddenly thrown to the ground, arms and fingers crooked forward like animal paws, spine arching up. The face acquires a bestial grin, with a curled upper lip and bare teeth. But the most eerie thing is their eyes. Even after death, they keep looking mad. Rabid. Which is a far cry from conventional rabies, as you, being a doctor, should understand perfectly well.”
“No more pain, love. Don’t fret over me. I’m all the same,” — John reassured, knowing that Sherlock would deduce it all from his face. No need for words.
As a result, α-Panther turned out the weakest. Not surprisingly, as it was the first try. The vaccinated MI5-er did contract the infection, but still stayed alive. Alas, he would remain invalided for life. The virus took over the host, wrung out his joints, but that was all it was able to do.
One ordinary morning John was sitting in the sitting room, sipping his tea, squinting contently as he flipped through a newspaper. Sherlock stood by the window, his back towards John; lazy and sated, he was fiddling a serene melody. There was nothing to interfere with peace and tranquillity at Baker Street. Sunbeams bounced all over the sofa, the table and the floor, leaving merry dapples on Victorian wallpapers and trying to peep into John's cup, or to show Sherlock how to modify the melody to give it even more light.
And it’s been a month since they had come back to their senses, beginning to admit the surrounding reality as it was. Still, not a bit of their delight and lightness was missing. Those just lurked deep inside John and Sherlock, to run amok by night, when they surrendered to each other in totality. When one initiated, and the other accomplished the move, or the fondling, or the tongue-tip teasing of sensitive spots.
“What’s that he needs again? I have not a slightest wish to listen to his preaching first thing in the morning,” Sherlock grumbled, yet he fished the phone out and pressed Call, lifting it to his ear. “Mycroft, have you got nothing better to do than raising hell bright and early? You sure know I prefer texting…”
John was sitting bug-eyed, with his jaw actually dropped. All his world turned upside down. As a doctor, he understood the prospective threat. A complete lockdown, that would unlikely stop, yet would slow down the epidemic. Wait, what “epidemic”? It’s already a pandemic! John’s terrified imagination was already picturing, most vividly, the consequences. As an ex-military, then, he knew that closing borders, even with the entire perimeter cordoned off by the army, won’t help. It’s not an enemy who can be seen, and knocked down by a rifle butt or, at worst, by a shot in the arm, the leg, wherever. It’s an invisible enemy. Moreover, a new, yet unknown one. It’s a catastrophe. Global catastrophe. Of which no one, absolutely no one, is aware. Even those people in South Africa. They are simply afraid. They don’t fathom the scale of the event.
“But you are not a damned virologist, Sherlock! How are you going to fight the virus? You’re a chemist! You detect crimes! But it’s a virus! It’s a whole other thing!”
Sherlock was reading the report and couldn’t believe it. As a scientist, he understood that a vaccine had to be tested on somebody, he himself would volunteer if it were possible.
Any change?” — he asked, meaning the joints and the sensations he had experienced after the vaccine shot.
Calming down, Sherlock inhaled and exhaled deeply. His brother should not hear him in such a state. He remained seated for a few more minutes, listening to John talking to Mrs. Hudson from their bedroom, explaining their absence for the next two weeks and reassuring that everything would be fine, that Mycroft’s people would take care of everything, and that she could call them whenever she wanted.
“I’m ok, Sherlock. It’s all over. We have overcome,” — John said in a soothing voice. He didn’t mention his dropping out into nowhere — there was no use worrying the genius when it was all in the past. — “How are
Guessing on the possible scenarios from the medical — and military — points of view, John got so lost in thought that he didn’t even notice when he clutched at Sherlock’s hands and squeezed them so hard that the points of pressure turned white, even John’s fingers did. It was but Sherlock’s pleading voice that woke him up:
. I don’t believe that this new virus is going to subside as suddenly as it has emerged. Judging by the reports, the virus was created artificially, you see – on purpose! It’s all much in the vein of one criminal genius, but we both know that himself and his web are terminated. Forgive me once again.”
Sherlock’s back straightened – shoulder blades almost forced together by the sides of his spine, neck frozen, every curl on his head expressing the tension of the talk. To be on the safe side, John meticulously folded his newspaper. Set the teacup at the table by the armchair. Crossed his legs and locked his fingers over his knee.
In some half an hour, Sherlock heard the familiar slam of the door downstairs and John’s heavy steps.
The PM had finished her speech, the news reel went on, but the dwellers of 221 Baker Street sat in complete silence, caring no more about the murmur of the telly.
One year since he’d returned from the dead, and for a while paraded with his nose and lip battered, as his reunion with John had gone a bit differently from what the detective genius had planned.
Sherlock was honest, he indeed felt sleepy, which was strange. Normally his "transport” wasn’t so demanding. Before he gave up, Sherlock opened the text editor and started making notes.
Sherlock was wearing his home clothing: pyjama pants, a grey T-shirt inside out, to spare his delicate skin from irritation, and a blue silk gown on top. He was barefooted. John, in his armchair, had thrown on a terrycloth bathrobe after a shower. His hair, brushed back, was still glistening with the remaining water, and there were slippers on his feet, considering a noticeable draft above the floor.
“John”, — Sherlock whimpered in relief, reading into the change that had left its trace on John’s face. — “Thanks God, you’re alright! Those were terrible days without you! How have you carried on, John?” — it was only with him that Sherlock allowed himself to be so open and vulnerable, only with his one and only John.
Subject A, in total, has undergone vaccination significantly more easily than Subject B, despite the former’s history of addiction. For Subject B, everything lasted longer and harder than for Subject A — evidently, for the reasons of age and previous injuries. To be factored in for future research. Blood tests to perform for Subject A and Subject B.
“Yes?” – John reacted instantly, putting of his book out of harm’s way. He felt that the talk would be serious, that the genius had finally come to some conclusions that had been tormenting him for several days in a row, which he was now ready to share. – “What’s up, Sherlock?”
John rushed towards Sherlock, wrapped his arm around his waist, and ushered the non-resisting detective to the sofa. Then he seated him, ever so carefully, and sat by his side.
“Discuss it with John. Make up your minds soonest. Before the panic begins, I can send a car for you. Let me know. And, Sherlock… take care of yourself and John.”
. This is not the matter now. Don’t you understand, everything is in danger! I can help, why don’t you want to wrap your head around it?”
Sherlock simply turned the screen to John. Having read the message, he went to bring the remote and cried out for Mrs. Hudson to put her own telly on.
A Government vehicle arrived early in the morning to take them to Baskerville. It was just dawning when they exited with two bags, Mrs. Hudson seeing them off, holding a handkerchief ready for blotting her tears. John re-reassured her that everything would be alright, and that they would come back soon, and that she should call at any moment.
Sherlock’s glance squirrelled from one John’s eye to the other, while John, in his turn, gazed steadily into Sherlock’s eyes.
Those final words of his brother convinced Sherlock that everything was more than serious. Never had Mycroft Holmes allowed himself such expressions of sentiment, for anyone, the more so for his little brother or for Dr. Watson.
John watched him from his chair, disturbed. He understood that, for the genius, it was unbearably hard to stay trapped within such a relatively narrow space. He was astonished by the very fact that Sherlock had refrained from investigating and didn’t do even remote consulting for the inspector, but devoted himself to a new cause – more large-scale and more complicated.
“Ah? Oh! I’m sorry, Sherlock, I didn’t want to… I… just… have no words! It’s a catastrophe, Sherlock! What’s next? What if Mycroft’s scientists fail? What if the virus is already here, in Britain?”
Just two words, other than John’s name, but the silence in the room, as well as all around 221B, was so thick that one could cut it with a knife. John’s mind halted abruptly. He tried to connect all the events: the brother’s persistent call, their relatively long conversation, a silent and non-interrupting Sherlock, his gestures, and this muted voice. The latter was the scariest of all.
Slowly, very slowly, Sherlock distanced the phone from his ear. Just as gradually did he let his hand go down, still holding the phone. That was even more suspicious, given the lingering left index upright. As if he forgot about it. As if his mind was astray, which was likely true. Perhaps his brain was already processing every word and every intonation that the elder brother allowed himself addressing the younger one. Sherlock’s Mind Palace was meant to weave probabilities into solutions and find the answers. Who knows what Mycroft said to bewilder him so much that he retreated to his Palace right after the talking.
“John! Mycroft is afraid! I never thought I’d ever hear his voice trembling. He tried to urge us to go to Sussex, to our family cottage. He says we’re going to be safe there. But I refused to listen: surely this would not work.”
Straightened in his chair, hands on the armrests, he leaned forward. He disliked all this very much. Firstly, never had Sherlock communicated with his brother for such a long time; secondly, and most frighteningly, he was listening in silence. No snapping, no sarcasm, no interrupting. He just turned towards the window and listened to his brother quietly. That was creepy enough to make the retired captain’s knees wobbly. Something happened. Something not good at all. But what exactly?
Both of them believed that it was not all in vain, that their consent to voluntary testing had helped the people in white coats to make the required improvements to the vaccine, and that the rest of the UK populace would not have to undergo the same anguish that they had.
The outcome of β-Panther was yet better. Upon vaccination, the subject experienced slight malaise, increased heart rate and perspiration, with a steep temperature rise up to 102,2 °F. It persisted for about seven days. To make it worse, the joints of his limbs swelled. All this time the well-trained officer was lying unconscious. On the eighth day the temperature began to go down. Unfortunately, his joints could not be brought back to their initial state.
“Yes, John. Unfortunately, Baskerville is overwhelmed. Mycroft is closing borders. MI5-ers got infected. Not all of them, though. He advised that we should stay at home and somehow explain the situation to Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock briefed, worrying his lower lip with his teeth. He was more than upset with the whole thing as well as with what he didn’t want but had to say next. “Brother offered us to go to Sussex. With Mrs. Hudson. I refused. We will be even in more danger there than here — no connection, no news, no help…”
“John… I… I don’t want to wait, don’t want to guess if we are going to get the virus or not. With high probability, one way or another, everybody is. All the world is, can you understand?! You have seen the stats! And I… I won’t survive if something happens to you. I won’t be able to live in a world without you. Yes, it’s the very sentiment that I used to despise so much, but not when it goes about you, John. I have understood and re-evaluated a lot… I became a different man. Because of you.”
John knew that trying to reach out to him would be an exercise in futility. There is no Sherlock here. One has to wait. For a kind of relief from the grip of nervous tension, he picked up his cup, almost dropping the saucer, cussed, and went to the kitchen to make one more. It’s so true, as Sherlock says, that a properly brewed cuppa calms down any imagination and nerves gone wild. John wished he knew what Sherlock used to do, — and how, — that resulted into that
Just like the Prime Minister had promised, the Government tried hard to keep the citizens informed. Reassuring them when needed, pledging that everything was under control, but… People were scared. Hell, they were terrified. The streets turned still, without ever so noisy crowds of tourists or even ordinary citizens running errands or coming back from work. Neither strident car honks, nor the rustle of tires could be heard anymore. The city was covered with silence. And that was even more frightening. As if the ever-vivid, colorful, bustling London suddenly fell ill. A bit not good an association.
Sherlock sunk his hands into his curls and pulled them ruthlessly, eyes squeezed shut. What kind of a genius was he, if he could do such a thing to the only one he loved? He didn’t deserve his love! How could one ever love a person who had purposefully exposed their significant other to danger? And was that even the first time he had? No, he was constantly rushing forward, with no regard for danger, shrugging it off like something negligible, outshined by the luring call of the riddle! How many times, after another crazy chase, had they both — or in turns — ended up on a hospital bed with injuries of varied severity, while the other was sitting by, praying for everything to turn out just fine still another time!
It’s been several months already, when one day Mycroft forwarded a report informing that Baskerville had developed several test vaccines. Not without Sherlock’s invaluable input. The brother used to maintain secrecy, triple-checking all the information before sending it to Sherlock, to exclude inspiring false hopes. Different versions of the vaccine were tested on volunteers, namely, the survivors from the MI5 staff. It was more than two weeks ago. In the confines of the labs, the vaccine was called bluntly – α-Panther, β-Panther and, God knows why, λ-Panther. The
“No, Sherlock, you made the right choice. I support that the three of us should rather stay here. But I think we ought to warn our friends and Harry. When…”
As each of them came up to the glass wall, they made it possible to get all necessary sensors attached to them, helping to adjust or tighten something whenever needed. In a while, another paramedic came — or still the same one, go figure with those twin-like white overalls, head-high, faces covered with plastic masks, — to administer injections into their forearms.
changed a lot, once he came back from the dead. Why didn’t he notice that before? Why didn’t he bother to look, to really look at Sherlock returned? Cherishing his own rage, nursing his grudge, petting it as if it were an abandoned kitten. Idiot. Blithering idiot!
My apology to the readers for possible errors in medical matters! Feel free to correct me via Tweeter or Tumblr!
“Listen to me: if you don’t let me around, as you say, this virus will spread all over the globe. And then it would no longer be a question of miles!”
“Alright, but first I’d rather go to Tesco myself and drop by a pharmacy on my way. And then I talk to Mrs. H.”
The lab test vaccine sample under the working name λ-Panther to be considered suitable for further development, as the most efficient one.
John could but hug his impossible genius and hold him tight. Sherlock saw and knew more than anyone else, more than John with his medical degree sans virology that he had never actually needed much. Now it was clear he better should.
John contemplated the screen of his laptop, silent, and with Sherlock looking straight into the camera, it appeared completely like he was in front of him, looking right into his soul. Then John felt warm and easy. Sherlock was with him, ever so close! They would be released soon, to be together again. They would come back to Baker Street and hug Mrs. Hudson – now that they could. Would probably get back to investigation immediately, or Sherlock would dedicate some part of him to that, and continue his cooperation with the virologists for the time being, as long as they might need the genius consulting detective’s ideas.
“Sherlock, love, tell me what happened?! Tell me how I can help? This is not the person that you are! Did anyone die? What’s the matter? Talk to me!”
Along with the still disappointing reports on the work of the virologists, Mycroft was sending brief stats on contagion worldwide. Due to the unprecedented measures taken early, the UK was at the bottom of the list. For quite a long time, it was headed by the US, China, India, Spain, Italy and Russia. Now the best minds of the whole world were targeted at struggling with the virus. “Panther” was seizing the world.
After that, everything got better. Not just “better”, — amazing! Incredible! The world went ablaze with new hues of their own making, from ordinary colours combined. They took beige and red, only to get bright chartreuse with a purple glow. Or, say, dark brown plus dark green made bright yellow, brighter than the smiley face on the wall. All their newly created colours appeared shining from within and sparkling at the edges. No one, nowhere had experienced such unity of souls and bodies as they did. They levitated above the ground, light as balloons. They were bubbling with happiness, which splashed out through their joyous smiles and twinkling eyes at the sight of each other. They stuck together constantly, appalled by a mere thought of letting each other go two feet apart; even taking one’s hand off the other was difficult.
Both finished their inspections at the same time and, looking each other into the eye, exhaled just as accordingly:
“It’s ok, you were right in your assumptions. Several years ago, I would have done exactly that. There’s nothing to forgive.”
“Brother mine seconded the best of the Baskerville staff there. Equipped them well, with all means of protection, and attached some people from MI5. ‘Cause you know those nerds, they won’t notice a threat, facing a curious specimen. They took samples of blood. From the dead and the diseased. And from a dozen more people, just in case. John, it’s some new kind of a virus. Very dangerous, according to Mycroft. High virulence. Transmitted through the air, by physical contact with the infected, and, of course, through blood and shared utensils. Mycroft says there are already thousands of cases in that region of South Africa. The virus is spreading with the speed of light. Mycroft plans to seal the borders of Britain, and to make those lab eggheads study this virus inside out and develop a vaccine ASAP.
, according to John, would remain in his fists. The phone gave a bleep of an incoming Skype message, as if it had perceived Sherlock’s condition.
“It’s the wrong time to joke, brother dear. The epidemic got out of control. I’m sealing the borders. The situation is very serious. As you know from the reports, we haven’t made much progress in understanding the virus. The pandemic in South Africa is in full swing. But worst of all, the MI5 staff that had followed the virologists have been staying quarantined in Baskerville ever since, and not in vain, as it turned out just recently. Many got infected, although, each of them locked in a separate cubicle, massive contagion was prevented. Text John, get him home right away. He’s on indefinite leave from now on, respective documents already sent. And try… no, better task it to John, that he should talk to Mrs. Hudson. You’ll be delivered foodstuffs once a week. As long as we manage. Nevertheless, brother mine, give it a thought, if it’s worth moving to Sussex. Along with Mrs. Hudson.”
Reaching out into the gap between the back and the seat of the sofa, Sherlock fished out the phone, gave the last deep sigh and speed-dialed Mycroft.
“You know, Sherlock, I am as happy as upset with what you just said. Happy, because you stopped hiding your sentimental side at last, and allowed yourself to love and be loved. And upset, because you could ever harbor an idea that I won’t be on your side, like I always am, in all your crazy ventures, won’t follow you without asking where we’re actually going on such a rush. But I value so much that you’ve got the guts to discuss, instead of making a decision of your own. Wherever you go, I go, Sherlock. Just like you, I won’t survive if something happens to you. I understand the risks and see that this virus is there for more than a couple of months. It’s serious and lasting, if not permanent. If – or, better, when – a new, improved vaccine is invented, and if-when the virus mutates, then we will be talking something else. Call Mycroft, tell him about our idea, and I will do the packing and call Mrs. Hudson to warn her that we’ll be away. She must not have a shortage of anything, all this time.
Holmes bent to look at the man who lay facedown on the cobblestones. "Your man of business, I presume, Mr Lyndale?"
"Mrs Spencer and I spent most of the evening on the sofa in the salon," Mrs Tyndrum said. "I'm sure we would have noticed anyone opening the cabinet."
When I woke I was lying between clean sheets, and someone was throwing open the curtains. Cold, bright sunlight flooded into the room. I blinked for a while, and finally succeeded in distinguishing Margaret Donnelly standing by the window. She gave me a wan smile, and I noted that her eyes were red-rimmed once more.
"I find myself frustrated by a lack of information. I haven't yet met most of the potential suspects."
"The idea does go against the grain somewhat, Watson, but I find I cannot let you go blindly into danger tonight, without knowing precisely why."
"About ten years now. It was an endowment from a group of charitable gentlemen. Including Mr Lyndale, whom you know, of course."
"The Lyndales are one of England's more well known recusant families, I believe. That is to say, one of those Catholic families of the gentry who managed to hold on to their land and wealth through the Reformation and since then."
Holmes smiled ruefully. "Not exactly. It is frustrating when some minor details come to pass in a different manner than one had predicted."
"One day, Watson," he said over his shoulder, "I shall take you to visit the settings of my own youth. I spent a large part of my formative years on the Continent, you know."
He put out a hand to pull me to his side while he went on studying the map. "It is not every day I have the opportunity to visit the town which formed my Watson," he said. "Indeed, knowing what I now do of this gruesome city, it seems I have to thank God you even managed to reach the age of eighteen, and escape with your life."
This caused me to raise my eyes sharply to him once more. Holmes rarely spoke of the future, or of what part he saw me playing in it, and now he had just done so twice in a matter of ten minutes. I did not have long to ponder on this, however, for Holmes was already throwing me my coat and donning his own.
"But now...?" he echoed. His voice had been quiet, but in his gaze I saw the importance he accorded to my words.
He made an impatient noise in his throat. "Yes indeed, I am Sherlock Holmes, as you so dramatically exclaim - surely the most heedless, unintentionally cruel man you have ever known. Why, from day to day I live in dread of the possibility that one of my thoughtless comments or actions will drive you out the door. I did not even dare to hope that we would last as long as we have, in fact."
"After him, Watson!" Holmes cried, and we took off in hot pursuit, while Lestrade went to Boyle's aid, blowing his police whistle as he ran.
"I meant rather that the theme is in disaccord with my feelings of—of contentment, these last few days."
His fingers stopped moving, in a distinctly guilty fashion, and I took this as sufficient proof to justify a retaliatory leap at him. However he had been prepared, and instead of dealing some well-earned retribution with the feather-filled bolster, I found myself flat on my back, my arms pinned down and Holmes stretched at full length over me, his face the picture of feigned innocence.
"What a wonderful organ you have," he was exclaiming when I joined them. "It's a Henry Willis, I believe?"
"I speak of the younger daughter, Georgiana, of course," Holmes went on calmly. "Though it is possible she won't act today, but rather tomorrow or even Friday.
He began by kneeling to examine the deadlock. I held a pocket-lantern to light his work, and watched him peer through the key-hole and scratch at its brass plate with his fingernail, before turned to the door casing to examine the striking plate. There were two other locks on the door, of different designs, which received a similarly close examination. His final objects of study were the door jamb and hinges.
Holmes said in a reassuring voice, "I have not come to you today on behalf of your family. All that is none of my business. I'm here because of a case I have been working on for several weeks, concerning a series of robberies and arson attacks in Limehouse."
I frowned. "Holmes, what is the matter? If you are in a taking because I was hurt again on one of your cases, I assure you, it's nothing serious. Why, if I had stayed here and gone on drinking whiskey, I'd probably be feeling much worse just now!" I laughed, but Holmes did not.
"Yes," Holmes continued. "The Monsignor confirms that he told Father Garner of his interest in cameos upon his arrival in London, several days before the party where the theft took place. I think we may assume that Garner had mentioned this casually to Lyndale, thereby allowing Lyndale to construct his elaborate plot."
I was simply glad to know that he had managed to find some kind of equilibrium in his mind over the past week, and that his ever-present paranoia would not spell the end of the happiest period in both our lives. I hastened to reassure him that the overture of peace was heartily accepted.
Holmes' eyes sparkled. "It seems poor Mr Lyndale has been the victim of two crimes in a row. What a coincidence."
A housemaid answered the door and showed us into the drawing room, where Mrs Georgiana Smith, formerly Lyndale, awaited us. As on the first time we had met, she struck me as a very reserved, self-possessed young woman. She sat with two small children, a girl and a boy, as neatly and soberly dressed as she was.
"My dear Watson, my theories are not yet fully formed," he demurred, with a wave of his hand. "But tomorrow will bring new developments in the matter. I guarantee it."
Shortly after that, Margaret Donnelly arrived, still out of breath from her long march on foot across town. She glanced around nervously before joining the man in the kirk doorway. I was sure that the choice of the graveyard as meeting place had not been hers.
Holmes was the voice of empathy quite as often as I was, but I did not point that out. Nor did I try to prolong the conversation. I was curious about what might have made him speak so, but did not wish to push him on the subject, this fledgling thing between us still too new and raw. "We should get up," I said instead, looking at the clock on Holmes' bedside table. "Mrs Hudson will be serving dinner soon."
Five minutes later we were in a hansom cab, rattling across the cobblestones of Edinburgh city. We quickly left behind the imposing sweeps of beautiful sandstone town-houses, crescents and private gardens of the New Town, and plunged into the narrow, twisting, grimy streets of the Old Town. The cab left us on the Royal Mile, at Holmes' request, and we continued more discreetly on foot. I was amused to find that Holmes' anticipative study of the map of Edinburgh had been sufficiently thorough for him to be able to lead the way, and I was happy to indulge his penchant for flaunting his knowledge.
"It is far from true, Holmes! I believe I know you better than that - despite the evidence you have furnished to the contrary today."
He went on in a low voice. "I behaved unforgivably last night. I don't know how much of it you were conscious for, but unfortunately there were many other perfectly conscious witnesses - which is the problem, of course." He began to pace up and down the room. "I lost my head completely. All I knew at the time was that you were bleeding and unconscious, and I could not bear not to cradle you in my arms. I don't even remember clearly - I only remember how terrible you looked, and how terrified I was. I'm sure I used several incriminating terms of endearment out loud, fool that I am!"
"Yes, indeed," he said. "And I also foresaw Mr Lyndale telling us to abandon the case." Ignoring my cry of surprise, he went on, "I must admit, however, that I didn't expect the two to be connected. I'm impressed. Lyndale took advantage of an unexpected event. A very adaptable man."
I laughed. "Well, Holmes, if you will insist on buying a penny-dreadful guidebook, instead of one of those excellent brochures by Mr. Thomas Cook, you are bound to finish with a biassed view of the city."
Smith winced, his hands tightening on the back of his wife's chair, but he did not speak. Mrs Smith's face was set in stone, her spine rigid.
"Under his influence, she has become very hardline, very strict," Willis went on. "Doesn't get on with the sister and brother, I hear."
I was in the my bedroom at the Gordons', and by the light shining through the window, I estimated the hour to be close to midday.
For a wild moment, I wondered whether Briggs had stolen the cameos and sold them to fund his work here. But that seemed farfetched.
I saw he had misunderstood me, and hastened to reassure him. "No, no! I did not mean to suggest that the future you described was unlikely in its entirety - or unappealing."
Briggs frowned, but said finally, "Very well. I shall contact Miss Lyndale myself, and if she agrees, I will send you her address."
My mind was filled rather with the details I had just heard of the case. "Isn't there a risk that Brodie will divulge her secret anyway when he knows he was betrayed by her?"
He stowed everything quickly and tidily—coat, hat, gloves, umbrella—and then turned back to face me. For a second or two we stood there, still awkward at the last. Then Holmes moved, and so did I, and we were kissing.
Suddenly Holmes turned back toward me. His head bent, warm lips brushed mine, and then he was already striding to the door, grabbing his hat.
Lyndale cleared his throat. "The fact is, my daughter Georgiana has eloped, this very afternoon. And it is now clear to me that she was behind the theft of the cameos, in order to finance her, ah, her departure from the home. She left a note explaining her actions."
We soon came to the place I had had in mind, a boatman's hut where I had sheltered once when caught in an unexpected downpour. It was clear that no one had passed this way in months. There were no tracks in the ground before the door, and small climbing plants grew undisturbed by the threshold. Inside there was a wealth of old ropes and crates, and even some mouldering cushions on the wooden bench by the wall. I pushed these aside and sat down, as my leg had been demanding for quite some time now.
As Father Briggs had said, they weren't much use to humanity, but then the same could be said of any jewels.
If he expected Holmes or me to exclaim in amazement, he was disappointed. Instead, Holmes murmured, "What a coincidence that the theft should occur precisely on the night when someone was present who could instantly detect it."
Holmes' eyes were bright. "A marriage has many facets," he said slowly. "You are already my trusted companion, my esteemed colleague, my right-hand man. The most gloriously handsome man I know. My deepest desire. My dearest friend. In short, everything. I want you to be everything to me."
"You've been rather preoccupied this evening," He started with a grin, raising a brow as he glanced back at John, "You must be thinking of some pretty lady. Perhaps the next Mrs. Watson?"
"Does that make them exempt from everything, now?" Sherlock sniffed, sulking further into his chair.
The brilliant sea-foam eyes pierced him as they stared at him fiercely, "Oh, cut it. We both know I'm not here because I want to be, that I'm forced to be here, and nothing you can say or do will change who I am."
John just smiled and shook his head, “I don't even get why you're still here. There's no reason for it. Sure, you have most definitely mental issues- don't give me that look, we all do- but there's no reason to come to a corrective therapist. Your brother is really extreme.”
John let out a sigh, “Yeah, that would be Greg Lestrade. He must be trying to protect me again.” Sherlock cocked a brow in question. “We have been friends for a while and any time I date someone new he goes and investigates them.”
He froze and put a hand to his face as he realized he was thinking way too much about his client. He shook his head and quickly went about making himself tea. Now was not the time to get attracted to clients, he was far too busy and had no room for romance in his life.
He pulled out the folder of information that was given to him at the booking and sipped at his tea. He sighed as he put a hand on the file, staring at the age; seventeen. "What do I look like, a rich-kid juvenile facility?" He muttered.
He drifted off into a light doze, mainly daydreaming about his next client in an entirely inappropriate way. When the intercom crackled to life, his face was flushed and his pants tented due to his improper mindset towards his client. He coughed, told his receptionist to send him in, and quickly shoved a hand into his trousers to shift his aching erection into a much more comfortable-and discreet- position in his pants.
Sherlock was waiting outside the lobby for John to come out. The blonde doctor walked out and saw the brunette standing before him. John walked in the direction of the road and Sherlock walked up next to him.
Today he got to see Sherlock for his appointment. He tried to hide his excitement over it for the teen always made his days brighter, but the skip in his step simply refused to leave. He patted Gladstone on the head, checked his water dish then left for work.
It really was no surprise when Lestrade ended up with Mycroft, truly no surprise. Sherlock was deeply thankful for it since that meant his phone was blissfully quiet when he was working now.
He looked up and saw the teen was far in the distance and ground his teeth before setting off at a run to catch up to the other, whom, when he caught up panting for air, was looking straight ahead with a devilish smirk on his full lips.
Sherlock looked down at him; for once a bashful expression rather than an arrogant one was on his face. He smiled and put a hand on John's shoulder and nodded, "Yes."
“He was fine. Mycroft is driving him a bit mad with the secrets and they got into an argument.” John replied, tucking into his steak with gusto.
John pocketed his phone and stood up, turning off the telly. He grabbed his coat and quickly left his flat, a spring in his step as he made his way to the restaurant. Once he arrived, the tall teen came into view dragging on a cigarette. He blew the smoke into the atmosphere before walking towards him with a blank expression.
He had spent the majority of the night with the teen, just walking aimlessly down streets, talking and just getting along. Friendship. They had become friends. His lonely mind was just taking that new found affection and turning his mind weird. He wasn't attracted to- Oh, who was he kidding. He was bloody attracted to that boy.
He freed one hand and had both wrists in the other; with this free hand he trailed down the long body until it rested at the hair nestling and protecting it's jewels.
“Didn’t expect to see you tonight.” John said, walking down the steps and sitting down; the brunette sat next to him.
John was walking to the café near where he lived, he just had to get out of the flat. Everyday he seemed to feel more alone in the flat; he had finally got the divorce papers and signed them, sending them off to the lawyers. The more time he spent with Sherlock, the more he wanted to be near the teen. He entered the café and saw Greg waiting so he walked up to the grey haired male.
“I could ask the same of you.” He glanced down at his hand and went to say something when a long, cool thin hand pressed against his mouth. With a shush, the brunette nodded towards the door and left out it briskly.
John scrambled for his clothes, pulling on his pants and trousers and sliding behind his desk, buttoning up his shirt while Sherlock pulled his own pants and trousers up and at an almost inhuman speed quickly placed the papers, computer and files back on the desk. He kicked their socks an shoes behind the desk and had just sat down in the chair when the receptionist opened the door.
