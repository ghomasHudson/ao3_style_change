The thing is, no Disney movie ever prepares you for the pain of betrayal, or the finding that the 6 years that went by meant absolutely nothing to the person whom you shared every joy and sadness. All the good moments, all the kisses, hugs, laughs, dinners, plans, movies, travels... all thrown in the trash can.
Eight months went by, the year came to an end, and I spent the New Year's Eve of 2017 to 2018 sitting in the beach, drunk, crying and looking like a fried meat ball from all the sand glued in my body, while Peter tried to make me get up and skip the seven lucky waves and Wade yelled at me that I needed to react.
see you guys next chapter,
He disconnected the call and stared at the tweet on his screen with a growing smirk.
“Of course you did, I'm not mad.”

MOMENT NUMBER THREE: when I got into NYU and you bought me that ridiculous "first day of class kit" with only Hello Kitty products, that I use up until today and makes all my friends feel embarrassed.
I imagine that the Astrology scholars are probably cursing me and yelling that "the sun sign itself means almost nothing", and I know that! I know that the others aspects of the birth chart are just as important, but I'm going to limit myself to the sun. Firstly, because this is going to be a simple research. Secondly, because I'm still learning about the subject and I don't want to come off like I'm a Steven Forrest or something, and thirdly because it's easier to find an Aries than a guy with sun, moon, and ascendant in Aries (for that, I'd have t go to the pits of hell)!
- Anthony, lift this ass off this bed, take a decent shower, put on something slightly vulgar and a hint of makeup on that face. Tonight we're going out!
“Obviously not. Can't you stop saying those things? Let's just move on from our issues”.
Good times, those of Orkut.
"Of course, I'm a gay villain who wants to corrupt the world", the brunette closed his body to the actor’s, noticing how he was extremely fragrant, exactly as Stark imagined. He took a deep breath, trying not to be tempted by the sweet scent and the see-through blouse that seemed to attack him, and whispered: "When you leave here with a woman, remember my video."
“You may have hearing problems, have you been to the doctor? It might get worse.”
"Sorry sir," he said quickly, not even having a clue what he was saying – maybe the drink was affecting him more than he thought. He widened his eyes when he recognized the outfit, and soon he was staring into the blue eyes that tempted him so much.
@THEtonystark: “I don't need that for fame, I have fans being honest @SteveRogers”
“Tony, only in your dreams I’m gay”, he answered, apparently annoyed with the direction of the conversation. Tony loves when the older one gets annoyed: his feet start thumping the ground and he has no idea where to put his hands – simply perfect.
He spent a good full hour choosing, before picking three to take – Morgan's 12 Star Signs, Ecstatic! and (Un)forgettable –. When he arrived at the cashier he could not believe his eyes, because there he was, the
People, I never dated Loki. What kind of question is that?" He looks away from the screen for a second, saying "We never had sex Pepper; quit that look, what the fuck? Are you guys high? I'm a respectful, family young man.”
- What are you doing here, Stephen? What about the show?
The problem was - as it was obvious it was going to happen, because teenagers own the emotional depth of a cotton swab - that three other boys also believed he was their prince charming, and received the same loving promises and the same uncoordinated make out session behind the school gym. When I finally heard about the cheating, my heart shattered with the strength only the first love and first disillusion can have. My mom tried to console me with romantic comedy movies, books and chocolate, but all I wanted was to act like a wacko with no proud or self-love, and call him to convince him I was the best out of the four suitors. In the end, neither me or the other boys had to go through the humiliation, since the boy ended up picking, among all princes, an older socialite princess.
Unless you wanna join
Steve gives a humorless laugh – he highly doubted that. His posture in his last video and his absurd offer showed just how universally far he was of him being a family young man. I mean, offering himself to prove that Steve liked dicks?
. He clicked on the start button and made himself comfortable in his big soft armchair, and soon a brunette boy appeared on his screen, and he couldn't not notice the intensity of his eyes -
I would really love to be spending our sixth anniversary by your side, probably pretending we're a refined couple and eating in a fancy restaurant to later return home, put on our holed onesies and watch a low-budget reality show while eating popcorn with melted chocolate - because the food in the expensive restaurant wouldn't get close to fulfilling the black holes we call stomachs. But, unfortunately, you a have a dream to realize and, as much as it breaks my heart not to have you around on this so special day, I will always support you.
“Pepper, count me in. I’m going.”
M O R G A N
“Oh, and by the way, this week's video will feature Pepper, do you remember her? The crazy blonde. She will probably talk about her love life –
Tony desperately wants to turn around and ask him if he’s okay, if there’s anything he can do, because fuck, this has got to be setting Steve back some in his mental health, but all he can hear and feel is the roaring blood in his ears, drowning every other thought. He wants to scream and cry, loudly, but he knows that won’t help anything.
Bucky bites his lip. He kind of misses his star. “Can you do paint jobs?” he asks, tentatively, wondering what the answer will be.
Pepper had needed a moment to process, but it seems Rhodey needs no such thing. “Are you kidding me? Jesus Christ, Tony.”
“No, I mean, Tony, this is exactly where I grew up.” His voice cracks, but he continues on. “That’s my old apartment building.”
“And say what?” Tony asks sarcastically, turning back around.
Steve grumbles and makes no move to get up, so Bucky arranges him for himself, propping the other man against the headboard. Steve thunks his head back against it and stares, dead-eyed, at the ceiling. He looks like a bomb could go off in the room over and he wouldn’t care. Bucky hates seeing him like this, but he knows there’s not much he can do beyond trying to make sure he doesn’t spiral.
“I am
He clears his throat. “Do you, uh, want to step out with me?”
, this is the man he loves–
Steve’s legs give out on him and he collapses to the floor, clutching at Bucky desperately. His face is screwed up and red, he’s crying so hard, and his body is weak and limp. Bucky drops down with him and wraps his arms desperately around Steve, trying to gather him up through the haze of his own grief.
“What’s this?” he rasps, and Bucky smiles a little, stepping in beside him. “The nursery.”
“That’s true,” he had rasped, then shook his head. “But I can’t ignore it anymore, Stevie. It’s killin’ me.”
“Did he know me?”
The Soldier gives him one more appraising look before tightening his grip on the firearm and aiming carefully at the center of Tony’s forehead.
Bucky wakes a few hours later, the counter digging uncomfortably into his ass. His head had, fortunately, stayed in the slightly leaned back position of resting against the cabinets, and not lolled to the side while he was asleep. Thank God for small mercies and zero cricks in his neck.
Steve looks down at his hands and pushes his palms flat against the table until his hands are white with the pressure, before he sighs. “Bucky found out about when we, you know…” he looks quickly up at them before looking down again. “We got into a fight and Bucky left, and when he came to apologize a little later, I provoked hi–”
Steve has to stay in medical for a week in case he tries to hurt himself again, going to therapy every couple days and spending the rest of the time sleeping. Dr Matty recommends several other psychologists to him and even some group sessions, but Steve is quick to shut those down. A couple of days in, Bruce hands him his new antidepressants. They make him feel a little weird; he’s tired and nauseous for a couple of days, but he overcomes the symptoms fairly quickly, not even noticing them by the end of the week.
He points to the food in her hands, then looks back up. “What are those?” he rasps, and she smiles again.
And yet, he did. He imagined them over and over. He drew some of his fantasies, some in full color and others in black and white. He even drew the man himself in situations that actually happened, like Tony in the suit with the faceplate up and eating a taco over a sticky plastic table, or doing something in his workshop, muscles bunching and flexing as he worked.
“It was,” he agrees, “but I can’t even be mad, Rogers. It was a hell of a kiss.”
Between the gum, and the oil puddle and the likelihood of that puddle not actually being oil but actually piss, it doesn’t seem like a very good spot to have a rest. Bucky does, anyway.
Fuck. That kind of stung. He knew it, of course he knew that the little girl in Tony wasn’t his, but to hear it so blatantly said, just flung out carelessly, it made something hot and sharp twist inside of him, carving a deep hole. It hurt, actually, really really fucking bad.

Thank you so much for leaving kudos and commenting <3
There’s silence for a few dragging seconds.
The last is of Tony, him, and Pepper, at the only social event Tony and Pepper ever convinced him to attend. His expression is the absolute picture of disgruntled, and though Rhodey can’t remember the exact thoughts he was having in that moment of time, he can imagine it has something to do with being shoved into a monkey suit. Pepper’s stunning as always in a stunning red gown that drapes off her shoulder, and she’s clearly holding in a laugh like the gorgeous man next to her, probably at Rhodey’s antics.
“It won’t work,” Bucky says, shaking his head. “He has way more of the serum than me, and they just barely work on me. Won’t do anything to him.”
“For… for her?”
He doesn’t look back.
He remembers hating himself, letting grief and pain and frustration and
“I may have… pushed him a little too far. I, uh, reminded him that his daughter is no longer
His arm doesn’t work. It’s a fucking deadweight. He tries in vain to rotate his shoulder out from where the arm is trapped under his body, but it doesn’t move. Tony had planned for this, he knew, told him that there was some sort of switch that will kill the whole thing and remove it…
“What, no, let me go without you. We need you here.”
. And… shit. Where the fuck did that come from?
he screams. Bucky clenches his jaw so hard he’s relieved he doesn’t crack a tooth. He has no idea how they got to this point, or why Steve is suddenly so worked up, but Steve isn’t finished.
“Yeah, how about no. Waddle out on the street like this? The media’d have another field day.”
It works. Soon, his skin isn’t feverish and tears aren’t trying to force themselves out. The lump in his throat goes away and he laughs wetly, slipping a hand under his shirt to rub the small bump gently.
Tony grins happily. “Oh, I don’t know about that. You’re left handed, no?”
He pulls his phone out of his pocket and stares at his messages for a long time. It’s obvious Steve is going through something, and although his instincts scream at him to text Tony, because Tony will know what to do, Tony
Bruce rolls his eyes. “We just want to make sure you’re okay.”
“No.” Steve shakes his head and looks up and his best friend, and fuck, his eyes are red with tears.
“You love him.”
Immediately after thinking this Bucky feels guilty. For him, it was fine, because he didn’t even know who Bucky Barnes was, much less Steve Rogers. God, he can only imagine how bad it was for Steve.
For a moment, no one breathes, and Bucky stares at the ruined pieces of paper on the floor, heaving with too much adrenaline for such a small activity.
“What can I say, Legolas? It’s a fine ass. Could bounce quarters off it, probably.”
The pancakes are delicious, actually, drowned in maple syrup and covered in butter. They’re fluffy and sweet, and Tony fights the impulsive urge to lean across the counter and steal a bite of Bucky’s just because, as he usually would during breakfast.
The Soldier watches him wearily while he regains his breath, and removes his hand only when Tony looks at him. “Don’t move,” he says, and walks off.
He’s even lost interest in his art. He had started again, after a long break, but it didn’t hold the same luster for him it used to. It was no longer a safe place for him to document his memories. As he had found out a week later from Bucky confronting him, just looking at them was enough to sweep him back to the memory, forced to relive events he had tried to hide away in the sketchbooks to
He steps into an alley, the first one he sees, and slides down the wall, cradling his head in his hands. He gulps in breaths of air, his thoughts tumbling through his brain and trying to fish for some sort of plan, or something he can do to get in contact, anything,
Tony is in the rocking chair, reading from a tablet peacefully, when Bucky arrives at the nursery. He slumps against the doorway, exhausted and manages a small smile when Tony looks up and positively beams.
He remembers a Bucky of the age seventeen, sitting across from him at their dining room table, staring morosely at a drink in front of him that Steve was ninety-nine percent sure was not yellowed water or herbal tea.
After he had finished his paperwork he had pulled the blasted thing towards him and was shocked and slightly turned on to find that the Soldier had crushed it in his hand. The grooves where fingers had curled around it weren’t deep enough to be from the metal hand, and Tony was extremely aroused by the thought that it probably hadn’t even taken that much effort.
, Bucky muses, but
“You’re starting to show,” comes Natasha’s soft voice behind him.
Tony laughs. He seems to be doing that a lot today, and the thought warms him on the inside. “Yeah, I know.”
Tony isn’t sure what to expect when he hears Jarvis inform him of an emergency.
In the back of his mind, something Bucky had said is echoing over and over:
Barnes comes back a few seconds later, a plastic cup held in his right hand. His left hand is hidden in the sleeve of his jacket, probably to hide it from people in the store, but now he shakes it loose and lays it on Tony’s shoulder, providing a comforting weight.
Not in lust, like he was some odd eight months ago, or even just starting to love him, like he loves Rhodey or Pepper or Happy, but is really, truly, falling in love with him.
“Sure it isn’t, Steve,” Bucky scoffs. “Ever since we were kids you’ve been too goddamn stubborn to–”
” Bucky roars. “
Steve nods, and pushes away the apple and tea. “Go away,” he mumbles, shifting back down the bed. “Just let me sleep, Buck.”
“Pepper and I used to do work at this table,” he says, tracing the edge with his thumb. “Glad it’s being used again.” He takes a deep breath and looks at the two of them, making eye contact quickly before looking away. “So? Are we playing twenty questions, or is someone going to talk?”
He thinks maybe Natasha has some sort of affection for him, but maybe she’s just doing her spy thing and wrapping her around her little finger.
When he’s done he closes the book and stares at the plain blue cover for a long time, shakingly convincing himself to do what he’s done so many times before: reach for the red sketchbook, open it, and pour over every page. This one is nearly as worn as the previous, though not because it was opened so frequently. In fact, Steve has only drawn in this particular sketchbook five times, but each time has spent hours carefully filling the blank pages. This one holds pencil sketchings of long lines and compact muscles, watercolors of whiskey brown eyes staring off into the distance, vibrant drawings done in pastels of bright, bright red and captivating gold.
“I heard you had a laboratory?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wanted you to see,” Bucky says simply.
Tony releases the breath he’d been holding. “Okay, then. I’ll leave you two alone, but, uh, thanks for hearing me out,” he mutters.
Still, Steve politely thanks the psychologist and goes back to the main part of the Tower, where his room is. He, Bucky, and Tony probably need to talk. But first, all he wants is a shower, as hot as he can stand it.
He leans over, tickling Steve’s sides relentlessly and blowing a big raspberry onto the soft skin on the side of his neck. Steve shrieks with laughter and his torso convulses as he tries to duck his head away from Bucky’s mouth, which is on any part of him he can reach, blowing raspberries.
The Winter Soldier comes in cautiously, hand resting on the tell-tale bulge of a gun in his pocket, but he doesn’t draw it. Progress. He’s also not wearing a mask, but his hair is drawn and it’s impossible to tell the exact features of his face. Tony also notices a distinct lack of the sleek black uniform he had been wearing in earlier sightings. He’s in civilian clothes now, tattered ones at that.
Tony just sighs and looks down at his swollen stomach, silently blaming his hormone-addled mind for saying such a thing.
Tony has also started researching babies a lot more, and even inadvertently forced it upon Bucky as well, often launching into a discussion about something or other that he’d read about, fully expecting Bucky to be able to follow his train of thought and the single-sided conversation.
The doctor frowns. “Are you feeling nauseous the whole day? Or only in the mornings?”
Right when Dr Matty opens up her notebook and asks him to tell her what happened, he’s off like a faucet. Steve can see she’s surprised in the crease of her brow and the pucker of her mouth, but she hides it well. Tony later informs him that for most people, it takes several sessions for them to trust a therapist, much less tell them everything at once.
Actually, don’t answer that,” Tony says, holding a hand up. “Why were you talking to him in the first place?”
He wishes Steve was out already.
“Alright.” She breaks off into thoughtful silence for a few seconds, seemingly thinking over something. Her next words are soft. “Steve?” she all but whispers.
“Tony, have you not been sleeping these past three months?” Bucky asks, confusion and horror warring within him. How long has this man been suffering from them?
Tony is startled out of his reverie when the doors of the elevator open with a slight hiss, exposing him to the empty kitchen. He
. Tony throws up his hands in disbelief, swearing a blue streak.
“Tony?” calls an uncertain voice from the bed, and Tony swears quietly, not having meant to wake Steve.
Even so, Tony’s gaze immediately snaps up to his, and he regrets it dearly. Steve looks
About a week later, Tony finally approves him to be the receiver of a new motorcycle. They’d quickly realized taking apart an engine with only one hand was next to impossible, so he’d just decided to declare Bucky capable.
They’re silent for a little longer.
he thought.
“Steve? What the fuck?” Tony sounds confused, and a little pissed.
“What do you mean?” Tony asks, and pulls away to look at him with a confused expression. “I mean sure, you kind of went all ‘unneeded PSA’ on me, but you didn’t break anything or break up with me, so…”
Rhodey opens his mouth, looking ready to go off on a whole tangent, but it’s Tony’s turn to interrupt him. “Leave him alone, Rhodey. He’s my
“If I don’t know myself, how am I supposed to answer that?” Steve shoots back. “I don’t have a damned sentence for you!”
Bucky’s tired and his stomach
“Let’s do that,” Steve says evenly. Professionally.
“Bucky Barnes was found. He’s going after him,” Tony says, and ignores the lump in his throat.
“I knew you were in love with me,” Steve interrupts, and goes back to his food. “I was, too,” he says and looks at Bucky, eyes twinkling. “Apology accepted.”
Bucky nods. He knew the old Bucky Barnes loved Italian; one of the few clear memories he had were of him eating maccheroni with the Howlies, Steve a warm presence at his side as he scarfed down his meal. Was it watery? Yes. Was it greasy? Yes. Was it the same thing they’d eaten for four days straight? Yes. But did it remind Bucky of the small Sicilian place on the corner of their block, that was run by a sweet old lady who would always sneak them cannolis? Also yes.
These thoughts and the self-loathing that accompanied them was as unexpected as it was unwelcome because, after all, what did it matter? What did it matter if Steve was part of the reason Tony felt like he had to hide behind that awful, awful smile? It wasn’t like he was going to change his behavior towards him, because Steve had really already gone too far in his whole act of hating him. To go back would seem suspicious.
Bucky might not have all his memories of the thirties and forties, but Steve sure as hell does. He remembers every last minute of everything whether he wanted to or not, thanks to the serum improving his memory.
“Okay.”
“Bucky,” Tony says conversationally from the other side of the workshop.
“I mean, seriously, what is in the juice you drink?” Tony asks, disbelievingly, and Bucky smiles slightly.
He keeps eye contact with Tony as he gently brings his hand up, keeping it close to his lips for a second, simply breathing slightly warm air over them, before kissing the knuckles tenderly, gently, reverently.
As Tony orders Jarvis to open the door and makes a beeline for Steve’s room, one thing’s for certain: while Tony isn’t sure whether they’ll pull it together, he’s starting to think that for Bucky, Steve, and his daughter’s sake (and maybe for Tony’s, too), they’re going to have to try.
“Bucky!” cries a voice, and the man can vaguely feel someone shaking him. But no,
Steve Rogers always shaves.
“I love you just as much, please don’t think I don’t. I know that right now, I have to try and be there for Steve to try and make up for the time I wasn’t, if that’s even possible. But the last thing, the absolute last thing I ever want to do, is leave you behind. Tony, I’m serious. You’re amazing and I love you
Tony’s sentiment exactly.
“She is yours, too, you know.”
Steve’s mouth is on his, his lips warm and gentle on Tony’s. The kiss isn’t quite passionate, and it isn’t chaste or loving either, but that delicious middle ground Tony wishes were all of his kisses were, just sort of sweet and demanding and Tony feels like he could
Just like that, the ice is broken and Bucky feels a smile stretch across his face. “I think it’s the ugliest fuckin’ building I’ve ever seen,” he tells Steve.
Tony’s hands are nothing like Bucky expected. He thought they would be soft, for some reason, soft like he imagined the man’s hair to be and his affection to come across as. Instead, they’re rough and calloused from working and holding things all day, and bigger than Bucky previously thought. He can feel the strength in them as Tony’s fingers flex minutely around his, but he can also feel the dexterity, the fine motor skills they’re sure to possess. They’re also warm, and Bucky desperately wants to bring Tony’s palm to his cheek to see if it’ll warm his cold demeanor.
“Shampoo and conditioner, Mr. Barnes.”
“Sorry, Tony,” Bucky mutters, running a tired hand through his hair and wincing slightly when his fingers pass over the tender spot. “Guess I wasn’t paying attention.”
Bucky thinks about it. He does want a new arm, wants it very badly, because who wants to be lopsided? However, he cannot help thinking about the excruciating pain from earlier, and to say he’s not eager to repeat the experience is an understatement.
also! I need ideas for cute baby and boyfriend shit. come talk to me on tumblr: 21greendragons
Tony’s set Rhodey up on the fifth floor, the floor specifically reserved for when he or Pepper visit. It’s cozy and homey, and the only floor with any sort of pre-planned personal decoration. For example, on Rhodey’s bedside table there are three photographs, all framed and glossy moments in time from MIT and after.
“Stark,” Bucky grits out, and Tony leers at him.
He stalks to the back of the room, disappearing behind the door. Tony looks after him, hands on his hips. He sighs. What even is his life.
Bucky swallows heavily and sets his food carefully down. “We were fighting.”
“What’s my name?” the Soldier asks abruptly, turning to look at him. “You said… Bucky? Bucky Barnes?”
“A while ago,” he admits, then laughs breathlessly. “Bucky, I’ve been in love with you since I was fifteen. And Tony,” he thinks for a minute. “As soon as I realized what I’d thrown away.”
Tony can hear an odd raspy sound as Bruce clears his throat. “Actually, do one of you mind getting me a sample of that goo? I’d like to take a look at it if you don’t mind.”
“It’s your child,” Bucky mutters, and turns back curiously to see what Steve’s reaction was. The other man looks like he’s been struck, and Bucky feels a shiver of sadistic satisfaction run through him at the thought that he’d finally managed to say something to get them out of the whole “what I think doesn’t matter anymore, you two are together” from Steve and “but you two love each other, there’s no reason for me to be around” from Bucky.
Steve edges around Bucky and pushes it open, revealing the sudden bright light of the streetlamps and car headlights. The sky is significantly darker than they left it, however, so it’s not horrible, but Bucky still spends the next few seconds blinking spots out of his eyes.
He doesn’t. All memories of Steve he has are tinged with love and desperation and want, but because there are so few he can’t … he loves Steve, of course, he does. Bucky doesn’t need memories to fall in love with this man. But Steve had
“Sir, I’ve finished the scan on Mr. Barnes’ arm.”
, only to be a little shit about it and ungrateful in every sense of the word. This motherfucker turned around, fucked you,
“Tony, what were you
“Thank you.”
Bruce clenches his jaw, takes a deep breath, and walks over. “What happened?” he asks gruffly, and gently resettles Steve in Bucky’s arms, the better to look at him.
“They look lovely,” she says, “I’m sure the baby will love them.”
Steve comes down to the workshop two hours later like he said he wouldn’t, the mangled remains of something small and black in his hand.
He suits up and flies away front the tower, asking JARVIS, as he flies, for the Winter Soldier’s coordinates. He’d slipped a small tracker in the hem of the shirt he’d given him, thinking that it would be useful at a later time. As it turns out, he was right. It was maybe a little underhanded, but so was the Winter Soldier, so.
“Ah, Steve! No, no!” Hot tears squeeze out from the corners of Bucky’s eyes and his stomach hurts from laughing so hard, but he can’t fucking stop. Finally,
He’s at breakfast one day, however, when Steve finally brings attention to it. He’s been doing his very best to keep his pain hidden by forcing himself not to flinch when he moves it, and using his right hand for everything he possibly can.
He gets up on shaky feet and stumbles to the wall, slamming his fist against it and releasing a hoarse “fuck.”
“Eva, mind telling me how you built your suit?”
“Beautiful cars,” Tony says lightly, but doesn’t ask further, and Bucky breathes a quiet sigh of relief and appreciation. The man is surprisingly observant, Bucky is starting to realize.
Bucky approves, and not just because it’s something affiliated with Steve, but because he’s seen, up close and personal, the old Captain America uniform from the forties, and this is a hell of an improvement. He licks his lips and shifts his eyes to Tony’s.
. His hair is plastered to his forehead from the shower, trails of water dripping from the strands down his face, mingling with tears as Tony sobs in pleasure, mouth slack and eyes rolled back as Steve pushes in again and again.
Tony nods, defeated. “Thank you.”
“Bucky?” he rasps, and the man turns a tear-streaked face towards him.
“Look, Buck, he kept pushing me and I snapped, okay? I didn’t mean to. It was an accident.”
Tony clears his throat, a raspy, guttural sound that turns into a coughing fit halfway through, and makes Bucky snort and roll his eyes while Tony sputters in front of him, grabbing a glass of water DUM-E places next to his hand. Bucky thinks he remembers something Sam, or maybe Steve, told him about Tony not liking to be handed things.
“Tacos carne asada,” she answers and jerks her head in the direction of the door. “In there.”
Bruce nods. “Just a shirt and sweats, but I figured something like this would happen. No underwear, though. Sorry about that.”
He grins when Bucky swears and nearly burns himself on the stove, knowing even if he did he’d heal in a couple minutes anyway. He watches in delight, however, as Steve blushes a bright crimson, and looks away, giving Tony a good view of his ears which are burning a steady red at the tops.
, then fucking
Tony looks at him then, shock written clearly on his face, and Bucky panics for a single boiling moment, and he wants to take the words back oh God oh God, but Tony doesn’t reject him. Instead, he laughs slightly breathlessly and buries his head back into Bucky’s chest briefly before tilting his head back up again.
Bucky knows this is where he needs to stop. This is where he needs to sit down and collect himself, where he needs to take a step back and remember that this isn’t all about him but, for the life of him, he can’t.
ShadowsintheClouds - the paisley rhino
Clint rolls his eyes, but he looks pleased. “Congrats, man. You gonna go in to find out the gender?”
Bucky, internally bouncing on the balls of his feet, responded simply, “Steve.”
Bucky swears it was.
“See that, J?” he asks his AI inside the helmet, grinning widely.
Bucky makes up with Steve. He knows it wasn’t really his place to get in the middle anyway, and he apologizes for trying to get in the middle of it, and asks, shyly, if he and Steve want to maybe get dinner that evening, or visit their old stomping grounds.
“You know what,” Bucky says awkwardly. “Steve kno–impregnated you.”
He doesn’t retaliate, however, and that makes Bucky, if possible, even madder. He feels more and more detached from his body as he grows angrier, however. He’s losing control, fast, and he doesn’t know how to stop.
Tony watches him go, wondering what to do. He ultimately decides to trust him, and leans back against the dirty wall, watching passerby at the other end. He can see them, but he knows they can’t see him unless they actually poked their head around the corner, and the fact comforts him.
But Steve is done. He is so done, and he is also sick of feeling this way, of feeling like it’s a chore to get up in the morning, to draw, to do anything that isn’t sleeping. Even then, he has slight insomnia that keeps him up well past three and forces him to be alone with his own thoughts while he stares at the ceiling, an experience that can be best described as… not fun.
. Not scared, or hurt, or betrayed,
“Just trust me, huh, jerk?” Steve told him quietly and grabbed the collar of Bucky’s shirt, using it to steady himself as he went up onto his toes and very gently fit his mouth to Bucky’s.
“Son of a bitch,” Pepper swears, and the lump in his throat disappears with a sudden laugh.
Bucky snorts and Steve flinches at the sound. “Carrying your child,” he says, and shakes his head. “God, how pathetic.”
“Colonel Rhodes,” he greets, and his voice is friendly, amiable. It is obvious that he doesn’t sense the tension thickening in the air, or tightness of the colonel’s shoulders.
A bell jingles as a door is pushed open…
“Bucky?” Tony asks again, trying to follow Bucky’s eyes with his own. “Are you with me?”
“The soldier’s been spotted,” Tony tells him, then curses as a robot goes flying above his head, impaled by one of Clint’s arrows. “Damnit, Legolas! No food fights!” he yells at Hawkeye, who grins back waspishly. Clint gestures towards his ear and… oh, great. He lost his comm again.
“God, yeah, like that,” he groans as Bucky’s hand begins moving faster, his thumb carefully rubbing places that make fresh noises tumble out of Tony. Tony looks at the ceiling and closes his eyes, savoring the feeling of being touched by another human being, by something that isn’t his own hand, something as
“Fine,” he mutters. “Jarvis, nighttime protocol. Rogers, get the fuck out.”
He doesn’t make it.
“I can explain,” he hears himself stammering out, inwardly cringing as it comes out sounding like a pathetic plea instead of a confident statement. He figures he might be able to say something else,
“Cool, Buckster. We’re gonna make it cool.”
Buck, that’s how fucking pathetic I am. I just – growing up was like
“What don’t I get, Steve?” Bucky asks through gritted teeth, but not unkindly.
, Bucky, I’m so sorry.”
“That’s true,” Tony agrees, “but I think you’re lying. I think you’re waiting until our backs are turned before you jump some poor girl.”
“Have you been drinking, Stark?” Steve’s voice is as hard as his eyes, and Tony stares at him. So he’s Stark again, is he? He shakes his head. “No, no, haven’t been drinking.”
Rhodey looks back as well, and does a double-take when he sees the super soldier. “I–hello,” he says, and Bucky forces the edge of his mouth to go up in a smile.
That was too far.
The day is cloudy when they come back, having finally tracked down Bucky a week ago, and Tony’s standing with the others on the landing pad, heart beating faster than he thinks it ever has. One of his hands is clenched into a fist, and the other bunches up his shirt a little to conceal the bump, the side of his thumb pressing against it subtly, protectively, as if making sure it’s still there.
Steve swallows heavily. “It wasn’t like that,” he manages
They’re quiet for a moment, and Bucky tries to pick his thoughts apart in his head from where they’re all tumbling around in a frenzy, clamouring to be said.
“I, uh, I know who he is,” Tony mumbles.
He takes the stairs to his room instead of the elevators, even taking them two at a time. He wants to go fast, but he wants to work for it. There’s a single cardboard box laid out on his bed, sealed with glossy transparent packing tape that makes the brown material look like it’s been covered in resin. He shoves the box between his knees and cuts a slit down the center of the box with his fingernail, opening it carefully.
, it’s summer and he and Steve are going to play with the hose…
yes, that last line was a reference to him falling off the train, sue me.
the last two chapters will all be condensed into one when I release next weeks chapters, because they're a little too short on their own
“Not much,” Bucky admits. “I just remember trying to convince you to tell people you liked men. Think I was tired of hiding.”
Tony sits in his chair for a long time after the Soldier leaves, cradling his head in his hands. He found Barnes. Barnes is alive. James Buchanan Barnes, Steve’s best friend, the one from the comic books, the one that should have died falling off that godforsaken train seventy years ago… is alive.
Tony looks at Steve hesitantly, then nods a little.
I mean, Jesus, Steve, is kissing all you could think of?”
Steve sets his jaw stubbornly but still refuses to turn around or otherwise speak to him. Bucky grabs his elbow and whips him around. “You’re not stupid, so quit acting like you are,” he hisses, fingers tangling in the fabric over Steve’s elbow, yanking him closer.
“It’s not funny, Barnes, I had to sleep with a body pillow last night! A
, and Bucky nods without thinking about it.
Bucky’s shaking.
“So I’m just supposed to forget I saw this?” Bucky snaps. “Were you even planning to tell me?”
“It’s fine–” Steve starts to say, but Bucky talks over him, not finished.
Best to not push his luck.
“I think it’s a definite improvement to the monkey suit he wore in the war,” Bucky rasps, and Tony grins widely. His hair is sticking up, and his smile is manic, but Bucky feels a sense of camaraderie with him, one he doesn’t feel with Sam or even Steve, in a way.
“Because he’s with
Still, his hand is steady around the gun he has trained on Tony, held with his right hand. His left arm is crossed slightly over his body ready for shielding. It’s uncovered and all smooth and shiny metal and Tony
“Wonderful, JARVIS,” Tony says absently, already pulling up glowing screens that seem to float in the air transparently, his fingers flying across them. Bucky has no idea what they are, but he’s seen Tony use them a few times and is desperate to try. Unfortunately, now doesn’t seem the time.
Bucky twists around and growls at him, but Tony only looks back defiantly. “You tore your stitches, asshole,” he says angrily. “Jesus, do you know how much pain you should be in right now? Do you feel
To say Steve wasn’t happy was an understatement.
Tony just snorts and rolls his eyes. “Half a year of fucking another super soldier has robbed me of any chance to feel intimidated by your muscles,” he says drily. “Put them away.”
He knows he’s on his own with this one.
Bucky coughs, awkwardly. “I just remembered all those times you’d be sick and stayed home.”
“I imagine.”
“The kicks are getting a lot worse,” he admits, “and my back is being a bitch. This morning my hip flared up, too, so here we are,” he says, and rolls his eyes when Bucky very obviously fights a smile.
He was right to trust Steve. Bucky positively licks his plate clean before sucking each of his fingers into his mouth, closing his eyes in bliss as he savors it, completely oblivious to the burning gaze drilling into him from across the sticky red table, Steve’s slice forgotten.
“You’re not doing enough,” he accuses. “You should be doing more, at least trying to be friends with Tony–”
, and Tony doesn’t know what he wants, damnit.
Tony makes a noise of want and snakes his hands up between their bodies, tangling them in Steve’s shirt and tugging him closer. Steve’s warm, so warm, and Tony thinks he can stay wrapped up here forever, just soaking up the warmth that’s emitting from the man curled around him.
He drew and drew and drew and poured his heart out doing it, every emotion he ever had about his subject clearly depicted on the page for anyone to decipher. He should have known his safety wouldn’t last.
Another thing he’s started doing in the week following his talks with Pepper and Rhodey is a lot of research. The nursery isn’t done yet, far from it, in fact, but it’s still a quiet and safe place where Tony can take his tablet or computer and sit against the wall, back straight to stop it from aching more than it already is.
When Tony looks back to the kitchen, he sees Bucky smiling approvingly, and Tony rolls his eyes. He can get rid of that shit fairly quickly.
“God, Tony,” he breathes into the other man’s hair, “I’m so happy for you.”
“I wasn’t doing anything,” Tony hisses.
His back is, once again, aching, and working for hours on end had done nothing to alleviate the ache. Besides, he has several things he needs to take care of, most of which he should have done months ago.
i know this was boring, and I'm sorry, but we'll be getting some action soon!
Steve looks up sharply. “What?”
Instead, he barely enters the hallway leading out of the kitchen before sinks down to the floor and draws his legs up to his body. He wishes the room would stop spinning.
. He doesn’t mean it, of course, he doesn’t. He wouldn’t trade Tony’s unborn daughter for anything, but he can’t think straight. He’s not in control.
“Yeah, you and my mother,” Steve replies thoughtfully, lifting a forkful of pasta to his mouth.
He stumbles slightly when he reaches the first step, but Steve’s hand settles between his shoulder blades, steadying him, and he’s able to pick his way up the stone flight with no further problems. There’s another small hall at the top of the stairs, and, once again, Bucky stumbles from the change in evenness. Steve grabs his shoulder to keep from falling forwards this time, and Bucky mumbles a “thank you” as he's righted by the strong hand.
Bucky laughs again, and this time it’s full of self-loathing and deprecation, and it’s just like Tony’s smile; it makes Steve’s fists itch for a good fight, itch to find the person who was the cause of those smiles and laughs and pound them into the ground.
“You’re welcome, love. Hug before you go?”
Bruce, thankfully, finds him passed out from the former, snoring lightly with his hand curled around the remains of the comm he had given the Soldier.
He remembers being sickly and weak, coughing up phlegm into loose sheafs of toilet paper, getting VapoRub rubbed onto his chest and back by his mother or Bucky, the yellow tea that tasted like rotten cabbage but did wonders for his deteriorating immune system.
“Hey, hey,” he says soothingly, and hops up on the bed as gracefully as he can, which is to say, very ungracefully.
Bucky takes a half-second to appreciate Steve like this. This is the most open and carefree he’s seen him yet, and this is the Steve Rogers he has broken memories of. He almost wants to break up the moment of silliness and laughter and curl himself around Steve and say how glad he is that he’s here, but he knows that will bring nothing but confusion and will put them on a funny note.
historians might carefully say.
His eyes are already trying to slide shut against the wave of exhaustion that comes with coherent thought, but Bucky stubbornly opens them wider. He can feel the beginnings of an escape plan tickling the edge of his consciousness, something to do with the boxes, and the little window in the divider that the driver can just be seen through, and the gas stop…
it starts.
“The poison was meant to drip into you slowly, and then all at once, and from what I’ve managed to extract from Cap, that’s what’s been happening. Frankly, it’s a bit of a miracle you survived that high of a dosage, but uh, for the record, I’m glad you did,” Tony says, rubbing the back of his neck and looking away. Bucky feels something warm and soft curl around his heart, but he keeps silent as Tony takes it upon himself to blather on.
“Sure,” she answers.
He also has a looming doctor’s appointment for his fourth month, or right around the time Sam said he, Steve, and Bucky would return. To say he’s nervous is an understatement. He avoids thinking about it and instead puts his all into finishing the damn nursery, knowing it’s too early to be doing this, but he knows the alternative is him going insane.
“Of course you did,” Rhodey says somewhat exasperatedly but with a heavy amount of affection.
So… that brings him back to Steve’s question. What
Bucky glowers at him, but can’t stop the small twitch at the corner of his mouth, and the knot of tension in his sternum that suddenly dissipates. Clint’s still talking, presumably saying something about getting back to the tower, or meeting up with Nat or Steve, but Bucky’s vision is blinking out, the darkness in the alley becoming darker, if possible, and suddenly there are large hands on his shoulders, gently holding him up.
something, for me. I need you to make an effort.”
Although, maybe a little pushing couldn’t hurt? “Do you want a sweater or something, Steve?”
It wasn’t just that one time that he drew, however. After beginning the initial plunge, it was all too easy to become enraptured into the task of categorizing then cataloging his memories. It was fun to have a hobby again, actually. And as the weeks began to pass, he kept at it more and more, even bringing his sketchbooks with him to the common rooms to draw by the huge windows, sketching the skyline or the bird nest he could see tucked into the rafters if he craned his head just right.
Alone in the room, Steve keeps his gaze on the table, where twin rings of moisture have bled onto the glass from the bottoms of the teacups. Bucky tilts his head back and stares at the ceiling, determinedly keeping his thoughts empty.
“Yes,” Tony says, clearly growing frustrated, “but I still don’t know what happened.”
There are exactly three people in his train car; two women and one other man. A young girl and her father are near the doors, the girl swinging back and forth on the bright blue pole, the man grabbing the back of her puffy red jacket to catch her lest the train lurched suddenly. They seem occupied enough, and Bucky’s heart hammers at the thought of trying to talk with the dad, asking to borrow his phone while the little girl just stares. She’s too young to politely look away, and he just doesn’t want the extra gaze on him, he realizes, so they’re out.
“Wonder what’s wrong with Tony,” Clint murmurs.
Howard would always glance at him sharply after these requests, because Tony was meant to be seen and not heard, but ultimately comply. Howard never really could resist talking about the sons he wished he had.
God, how is he supposed to keep this from Steve? Furthermore, when he
Steve’s jaw works and he opens it, but nothing comes out and he slumps, defeated. “Do you have any idea how that feels?” he whispers, finally, and Bucky feels his heart drop.
A large square shelving unit with cubicles and drawers for clothes and diapers sits in the corner of the room, painted in green and yellow with some more wildflowers dotted throughout. The top has a changing pad already set up, although the cover isn’t on it yet; it’d only collect dust. That’s where the purple platypus, Bucky bear, and other six mismatched creatures sit now in a sea of odd features and colors and names.
Better not to be around people.
creeping into his voice.
“Tony won’t care,” Steve mutters, and turns away from Bucky and the sunlit window.
His father spent more time talking about Steve Rogers and the things he did, even going as far as showing Tony an old newsreel of Captain America in action, but Tony was far more interested in Bucky Barnes. Sure, he had Captain America action figures and posters of the man up on his walls, but Bucky fascinated him in a way that Steve just never did.
“Go?”
“A couple of weeks ago,” Tony says, and rests his fingers on Bucky’s hair, just letting them sit there.
It isn’t enough, however. It isn’t enough to stop the flood of his earlier thoughts and everything he’s realized in between. In the beginning, he always thought Tony was the worst thing he had lost, the worst thing that he had dealt with. Then, he thought it was Bucky. It was true, he was a big part of the reason Bucky was alive, but Bucky had already met Tony, by then. He already had someone and Steve? Steve had no one.
“Able? Can I just
God, does Bucky’s heart ache for this man.
He even finds a small box with multiple pairs of gloves, and his heart swells with the simple thoughtfulness of such a gift. He tugs on some black ones, hiding his metal arm from prying eyes.
Bukcy says all of this in less than twenty words, which is still too many, but the beam Steve gives him in return is well worth the discomfort. He leaves the conversation feeling a little icky and a lot feverish, but he tells himself that if he hides he’ll forget about dinner, and a sad Steve Rogers is the last thing he needs.
Oh, he hated him.
His conversations with his friends, particularly the sex parts, have really spurred him on, and more than ever he was missing a proper fuck, not just a quick date with his right hand before bed.
Steve has no fucking clue about anything, Bucky rekindles and starts friendships, Tony works on a Cadillac, and a slice of cheesecake is featured!
Alone in the kitchen, Bucky fights the urge to scream.
Tony sneaks a glance at Natasha again.
my fault.”
“‘We?’”
“I’m nervous,” Bucky says quietly, pressing the button for the elevator. “What if…?”
“Oh my God. You–you’re… you’re Bucky. You’re Bucky Barnes.”
“Oh, I don’t know. You tell me,” Tony drawls, hiding his glee when Steve looks at him.
This particular morning, Steve and Bucky are having pancakes with condensed milk, a surprisingly good combination. Bucky reaches for the little cup with his left hand without thinking about it, flinching violently when it puts too much strain on his shoulder and sends a twinge of pain that reaches up to his collarbone.
Only a couple of minutes later, Steve’s eyes were rolling back into his head as Bucky’s hand continued it’s tugging motion wrapped around him, and soon he was giving a hoarse shout, going boneless against the bed.
Hurt flashes through Steve’s eyes, but he doesn’t budge. “You need sleep in a real bed,” he insists, and Tony grinds his teeth together.
Bucky had nodded, and Steve gave himself a moment to think before he nodded hesitantly, heart quickening as Bucky cautiously lifted the sheet up, slipping off his cot and approaching Steve. His cock was still pointed up towards the ceiling, curving up towards Bucky’s belly and bobbing with each step he took and Steve eyed it wearily as Bucky came closer.
Tony does not, in fact, get any sleep. At least not right away. More pressing is his rumbling stomach, already being lanced through with flashes of hunger pains. Damn the second human inside him needing food, too.
Bucky nods, because what is there to say?
Near the small sink there’s a plastic rack of shiny pamphlets, and next to the door are several yardsticks taped to the wall on top of each other for measuring height. Giraffes are painted on the ceiling, and stuffed fish hang from the ceiling, dangling on skinny pieces of fishline.
“I– what were you even
“I can’t detect anything beyond the ordinary, sir.”
Steve looks up slowly, and meets his eyes. “What do you mean? I’ve seen you smile.”
Tony’s answering grin is wry and his voice is self-deprecating when he says, “That’s the newest model. What do you think?”
, his mind screams.
The noises abruptly stopped, and Steve’s pulse spiked. Had Bucky
What an awful thing to say, first off, and second, that wasn’t really true, was it?
Bucky blinks. “So what’re you going to do?” he asks carefully, and Tony grins wryly.
. Belatedly, Tony realizes he’s right. Getting Bucky back
“Lost you for a second there,” he says, and he’s trying to smile, trying to make a joke, but Bucky can see the concern in his eyes.
After, he goes through the fully stocked medical cabinet that Pepper had forced him to have after finding him one too many times with burns or scrapes wrapped in grease-stained rags, and unwraps a package of underwear, taking out some new boxers.
Tony can hardly believe what he’s hearing.
This upsets the cup and its contents, sending creamy liquid spilling across the table and ruining the newspaper Steve had flattened out on the table to read. Steve jumps as Bucky yells, “fuck!”
. He missed Bucky so much, and when he was around Tony, the hurt nearly went away, and that aggravated Steve to no end, and put so much guilt into his mind that Steve began looking for faults, for cracks, forcing Tony to darken in his thoughts.
“I do mind, actually,” the Soldier tells him, crossing his metal arm over his chest and lowering the gun, but not taking it off of Tony.
Tony Stark was no longer vibrant or gorgeous or a genius, he was an ex-weapon mongerer with a narcissistic personality disorder and so much arrogance he could fill a lake with it. He was no longer social or passionate about his work, but a workaholic who couldn’t keep his mouth shut or legs closed for a single soul on earth.
Tony laughs a little sadly. “I’m not blind, you know. A little too much, too late, though.”
Fuck.
“The blood of my enemies,” he answers lightly.
“I’m scared,” he whispers into Bucky’s firm chest.
expect cute pregnant fluff the next few chapters!
Bucky is slumped against the wall, tears running down his face as he heaves out sobs, his arms clamped tightly around a nearly unconscious Steve, who’s making funny twitching motions and keeps gasping, trying to mutter some sort of phrase over and over. They’re clinging to each other as if they’re each other's last hopes, and the scent of blood and vomit is thick in the room.
He shoves Steve away as forcefully as he can, lurching backward, ripping himself from the warm and comforting hands at his back and neck... he shivers and firmly puts distance between them, forcing his breathing to even out. Steve stumbles back more out of surprise than Tony’s strength and stands there, hands limp at his sides, lips cherry red and glistening, shirt wrinkled and disheveled.
“Steve,
She responds in a matter of seconds, something Bucky appreciates, telling him that Steve is having a bad day, depression wise, and that to help him he should try to get him as stimulated as possible.
They’re all suspended, and Tony knows that sooner or later they’ll all come crashing down, ending up in one of two ways: either Bucky chooses Tony, or he chooses Steve. There is no alternative to either Steve or Tony getting the boot, and all Tony can do now is pray selfishly that they will fall in his favor.
. A new wave of tears are pressed into the sheets, and Tony shivers from the sheer amount of self-hatred.
Tony looks absolutely
He’s said his piece, even if it was a bit small and pathetic, and it almost feels like he’s given himself a new mission to add to his list. His list has three items now: protecting Tony Stark from the demons of the world, figuring what the fuck happened between Steve and Tony, and smiling more.
“Black Widow, I need you and Hawkeye on top of a building. Hawkeye, I want clean shots, Widow, I need you to be my eye on things. There only seems to be a few dozen, so this shouldn’t take long. Thor, take out as many as you can, but avoid lightning.”
Well, that’s an easy question to answer. “Yes.”
His second mistake is continuing to turn the pages, continuing to live out his worst memories and fears in lifelike drawings. Dammit it all to hell, he
“Tony
“Anyway, as for that
Bucky shrugs and gives him the drink and apples, telling him to eat at least three slices and drink half the cup. Steve obliges with the same kind of resignation as before, and Bucky’s heart
“I was just helping,” Tony says. “You know, blasting robot ass, the usual.”
Now Thor is gone, probably to go see the rest of the team, and Tony has returned to the workshop to do God knows what, and Bucky’s just left in the nursery.
Dammit.
But he still couldn’t help but let his mind wander to times in the future where maybe he did let himself feel like this, did let himself be drawn into the magnet that is Tony Stark. It had felt like cheating on Bucky, to imagine him being the one to offer Tony his coffee in the mornings, let the other man curl up against his chest as he sipped the steaming liquid, to imagine hitching a ride on Iron Man to get back home from a mission instead of taking the quinjet, to imagine slipping his hand into another, slightly smaller and more calloused, hand.
“Alright, then. Patch me through, would you?”
“I was willing to wait!” he shouts. “I thought you needed time, not…”
It was an accident.
Steve’s looking at him, unimpressed, and Bucky fights the urge to flinch. The answer might be believable to Tony, who’s never had to pick splinters out of Bucky’s hand when he was kid while Bucky muffled his tears in his shoulder, but to Steve? Forget it.
to the people who gave the damned thing to him in the first place.
Tony huffs. “I’m not going to go.”
“Dammit, Tony, this isn’t supposed to be hard.” Steve sounds tired as he rubs the bridge of his nose.
Tony falters. “I haven’t really thought that far,” he finally answers. He opens his mouth to say he is going to keep it a surprise, but snaps it shut as a wave of new fear sweeps through him. Yeah, maybe he’s done with surprises. “I’ll find out in three weeks,” he says instead.
His heart begins to beat faster, and the fingers on his right hand start to twitch, yearning for something to twist between them. So asking for a phone is out.
Jarvis tells him Tony is in the workshop, so he heads down with his lemon and lets himself in, waving for Jarvis to turn off the music. “I brought you your lemon,” he says helpfully, alerting Tony to his presence.
Tony snorts and moves to stand up to take his turn. “Not so fast, Stark,” Natasha calls. “I actually have the stuff on me, unlike you.”
Bucky shrieks, trying valiantly to pull his feet from Steve’s grasp, but Steve’s hands are too tight and his strength is weakened as he cackles, breathless laughter echoing throughout the room. “No, no Steve!” he gasps, throwing his head back and laughing uncontrollably as Steve reaches up one hand to tickle the back of his knee, causing Bucky’s whole leg to jerk.
She sighs. “This might have something to do with that serum of yours, so let me run some things by some others, and we’ll let you know.”
“I’m going after him.”
Tony sits back then, having not realized he had been leaning forwards. Steve’s face opens, suddenly, and there’s nothing to be seen but pure unbridled anger and hatred, all directed at
So maybe that’s what’s missing…? Although that does seem a little obvious. Of
A smiling doctor comes into the room not two seconds later, his long black hair pulled back neatly into a braid. He walks up to Tony, the customary clipboard tucked under his elbow and offers his hand.
Tony waves his hand impatiently. “It’s fine. C’mon, sit down. Read your book, whatever.”
Dr Matty suggested that he, a little at a time, worked his way up to being more comfortable around people. As the Winter Soldier, he had never cared about people around him, because he had a mission. As Bucky Barnes? He did care. He cared to the point of his breath coming a little short and panicky when someone stared too long, and the point to where he didn’t want to go out without something to cover himself, especially his face.
They look mostly alert, their suits pulled on properly and weapons at the ready, but he knows the midnight call affected them more than they’re letting on.
He thrusts as fast he dares, chasing his own finish, before he’s suddenly pushed over the edge and bites down on the nearest bit of skin, trying to be as gentle as possible but knowing he misses by a mile when the metallic taste of blood fills his mouth. His vision whites out and he groans, pistoning weakly as he shakes against Tony, pressing him more firmly against the cold tile.
Bucky nods, relieved that Steve’s going along with it. “Got someplace in mind?”
” Bucky snarls. “This isn’t fair to anyone.”
Still, he’s free.
,” he mocks, leaning over and picking up the red sketchbook from the floor, almost tearing it open to the page of Tony slammed against the wall, a moan dangling from the man’s lips that’s nearly audible from the page.
The punch is sharp, quick, and Bucky’s neck snaps to the side, his cheek lighting on fire.
“He went to find the Winter Soldier. And I didn’t get pregnant on a bed with silk sheets and rose petals, Rhodey.”
mothers couldn’t afford it.
isn’t a small man.
Bucky winces and pulls away completely, bringing up a silver hand to rub the nape of his neck. “About that… you ever wondered how I got the information in the first place?”
Tony does think he knows, and he’s pretty sure Bucky knows too.
“You’re such a dork,” he laughs, and Bucky looks confused, as if he didn’t know what a dork was.
“What’s
. He should have remembered that he could never leave well enough alone.
“Oh? And how shall I please my Captain this time?”
“I still love you
Tony refuses to leave Bucky’s side, and as soon as they’re let into Steve’s room the next morning, Steve’s side, too.
“He, uh,” he clears his throat. “He had an urgent mission he had to take care of, so he’s not here right now.”
Tony reels back, putting a hand on his chest and exclaiming in mock outrage. “How dare you! I don’t need that much attention!” Bucky raises an eyebrow. Tony huffs and turns away. “Yeah, yeah, okay. Maybe I do.”
He doesn’t exactly know what he’s doing here, and he doubts he’ll ever really know, but for now he’s content to stay in this fragile space of tenderness and racing hearts, enjoying and appreciating each other’s presence.
Steve breathes out a gusty sigh and relaxes further into the chair. “I won’t pretend that didn’t hurt, but I…” He sighs again, “I guess I can forgive you.”
The next day they’re called on a mission, and Tony is very kindly but firmly denied his request to go out with them. He huffs but has fun building his own rocking chair, so it’s alright. Besides, this way they won’t find out about the projectiles he built in.
Then he looks down at the helpless man in his arms, who’s now clutching Bucky’s shirt as if it’s his last defense against the world. Steve’s making little whimpering hitches of breath in between sobs now, as if he’s in pain, and Bucky’s never felt more helpless or afraid in his life. He should have known, dammit, he
“Who are you?” Rhodey asks casually, leaning back and peering at Bucky.
, but no.
Tony looks up, startled. “A what?” he asks wearily.
So far, he knows what to expect from every single week he has left, has been eyeing a few facebook groups, and has ordered brightly colored vitamins.
Tony suddenly realizes that he’s standing pressed against the wall in the armor as if he was trying to blend in with the cement of the changing room. All of the bluster and bravado seems to have been drained out of him, and he swallows, suddenly nervous in the small room with only Steve for companionship, who hasn’t so much as said a word since they left the quinjet.
(See the end of the chapter for
im so fucking sorry. feel free to scream at me in the comments, I know I deserve it.
Regardless of the saliva, it only takes the faint hint of rosemary to hit his olfactory senses and he’s sprinting to the trash can, retching and gagging. Steve watches him like he always does when this happens, with a tight look around his eyes and a clenched jaw, almost like he’s watching his nightmare come to life. Tony doesn’t know how to approach him about it, so he doesn’t.
“Her.”
Tony bounces a little. “This is comfortable,” he notes.
Well fuck them, too.
It certainly hadn’t seemed like that a couple of minutes ago; Bucky had seemed fine by himself.
“Well, hurry up,” he grumbles but sits back down.
“I don’t think there’s a need for Hulk, especially at this time of night.”
“What are we going to
“He should,” Steve replies miserably.
that voice. That isn’t Steve Rogers, no siree, but it sounds just as familiar, just as comforting. “Tony?” he asks, cautiously, and his breath grows labored. He’s scared. He doesn’t know where he is.
Tony smiles a little and goes into the hallway to make the call.
Bucky raises both his eyebrows this time. “You want my metal hand?”
Friends.
I know a lot of you are ready for the angst to be over, and IT NEARLY IS I PROMISE. Thank for being patient <3
“What the fuck is his problem?” Tony growls as he stalks down the hall, his hand still firmly clenched around Bucky’s flesh one.
“But, I just wanted to say sorry to you. He’s your boyfriend, and you guys look happy. I’m sorry I’m in the picture at all–”
At the moment, however, he had more pressing concerns than any underage drinking. “You’re
He was different from other people Tony had started to fall for too. He was sweet where Steve was mean, and firm where Steve was lax. He was understanding where Pepper wasn’t, and supportive where she would try to coddle him. The less said about Tiberius Stone and Sunset Bain, the better, as it went without saying that Bucky’s flaws were better than their entire personalities.
Seemingly overnight, new clothes appear in Bucky’s wardrobe. Most of his clothes have disappeared; the only piece remaining is his black leather jacket. Now he has stacks of shirts in tasteful colors and another coat, a stormy blue one that probably matches his eyes, a pile of trousers and jeans, a small stack of soft-looking pull-overs, and a pair of comfortable-looking combat boots. He closes his drawer with a snap, feeling overwhelmed.
Bucky nods.
“Yeah, he is.”
... Bucky feels like
“You too,” she says, and he can almost hear her smiling over the phone.
easy to just run away from his mistake and cowardice.
“I left it off. I didn’t want you to get hurt by ricocheting bullets.”
with his pupils blown wide and his lips cherry red and glistening with spit. “Wh–” he cuts himself off with a moan as Bucky’s hand finally dives down his very convenient sweatpants to grasp him firmly through his underwear.
“Flerken,” Bucky corrects, handing over the damn thing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think I’m okay, Tony. Just got some of my memories back,” he finally murmurs, and Tony sighs with relief.
Frustration clouds Bucky’s vision. “Why are you doing this to yourself?” he asks, and Steve raises an eyebrow. “Why are you so adamant that he hates you? Have you ever tried to talk to him
“What’s your name?” he asks conversationally, smiling at her.
Steve sucks in a breath because that was
Tony winks flirtatiously in response to the icy look, and Bucky rolls his eyes. “Quit bein’ a menace,” he says, voice soft and full of Brooklyn.
“So you
“I don’t want to,” Steve grumbles, but he swings his feet over the side of the bed. He’s wearing nothing but a pair of boxers, and though not quite ideal attire for flouncing around the Tower, Bucky’s also fairly certain that a suggestion of putting on any other clothes will only end them up where they were ten seconds ago.
Steve swallows harshly and shakes his head a little, before burrowing further into his blankets. “I don’t want to get up,” he whispers.
When he responds, “I think you know, Tony,” his voice is ragged and rough, caught on all the thoughts running around his mind, screaming.
“You know, if you gave me–”
“Head forty-three miles East, sir. The scene is the downtown of a small suburban city. Any havoc should be impossible to miss,” JARVIS answers smoothly, sounding as calm as always.
She answers on the third ring.
Bucky can see a little badge sticking up from the open hood, and he squints to try and see what it looks like, before lurching back in surprise. It’s a Cadillac, and the longer he stares at it the more a memory edges closer. He frowns and looks down, trying to tug it out in the open.
“I didn’t know where you guys were!”
. You ran away with the man I loved, no less… did our love mean
“I’ll be here when you wake up, Steve, I’m not going to leave you, not again,” Tony whispers, making up his mind in that exact instant.
Regardless of what is happening, however, there still begs the question, will Tony and Steve be good together, anyway? Bucky has only been gone for three days and already they’re at each other’s throats, falling right back on where they were at the beginning.
Steve looks away to the window, eyes thoughtful. “I don’t know,” he says quietly. Bucky doesn’t push, because he can see it in Steve’s eyes: He really doesn’t know.
“Mind smelling this for me, Steve?” he asks when he presents the meager snack to the other man.
He’s shirtless, so he tugs on the blue running shirt easily, pulling it down and wincing, as always, at his reflection in the mirror across the room. Natasha swears it’ll help him pick up ladies, but Steve just thinks it’s unnecessarily tight.
“Couldn’t bear to leave it in the workshop,” Tony confesses, and shyly offers it to Bucky. Bucky takes it with his flesh hand, not trusting his metal arm to be so gentle with something so precious. He holds it very carefully and studies it with meticulous eye movements, taking in every curve and dip of the baby-resembling white blob floating in the black.
“Of course, sir,” the smooth British voice answers him, and a few seconds later Bucky hears the hiss of a door opening, admitting the super soldiers to the workshop.
To his horror, there are tears collecting just behind his eyes, a blindingly hot pressure that’s just begging to spill over. Tony blinks them back. Between him and Steve, he needs to be the strong one here. “I don’t know,” he chokes out in a strangled voice that absolutely conveys he had been about to cry. “I just don’t
The quinjet touches down soon after, and Tony feels the pit drop out of his stomach as he registers what this means. “I have to de-foam myself with Capsicle?” he says incredulously, looking at the other man sideways. Steve clenches his jaw but doesn’t outwardly acknowledge him.
Bucky’s able to open his eyes much quicker, this time, though it’s probably because the truck is currently traveling through some sort of forest, from what he can see through the teeny window and the much larger ones beyond. The branches are filtering the light that’s filling the tiny back of the van, and a part of Bucky is thankful. The other part of him is concerned, because he has no fucking clue where he is.
God, how he hated Tony Stark. The man was uptight, a righteous asshole, a swanky rich kid who thought he was better than everybody else because he was a genius. He was just a man in a suit of armor, take away that, what was he really? Just an emotionally repressed man with no filter. How arrogant. How rude. What a pathetic excuse of a person. Steve knew dozens of men worth ten of him, hundreds of men he would call a hero sooner than the man before him.
He laughs. “Goodbye, Ms. Potts.”
“Alright, that’s it,” Bucky decides, yanking the covers away. “Steve, I know you’re feeling awful and I know you don’t want to get up, but I need to see something, to
Bucky and Steve sit across from each other on the bed, Steve’s hands firmly tucked into his lap, Bucky’s spread out on the bed to support himself.
Tony glances at her thankfully before lifting his chin and looking the rest of them in the eye.
“No, no,” Bucky hurries to reassure him. “I’m not, we’d really be dating.”
“Why should I? Perfect specimen, indeed.” He licks his lips.
“Well, I don’t know if you noticed, but it’s very…” he licks his lips, wondering how to phrase his next comment so it comes off as sultry, instead of creepy. “...private. Nice place to go and let off some steam, if you know what I mean.” He inwardly cringes because, okay, smooth.
The team more or less knew in the first week, but it was completely confirmed one morning, when a sleepy and caffeine-deprived Tony wandered blearily into the kitchen and accepted a fresh cup of coffee from Bucky with a quick kiss over Bucky’s jaw, which was more a skim of lips than anything else. Bucky and the team had immediately frozen, but Tony remained oblivious, murmuring quiet
“Think we can go on a walk?” he asks Steve, an idea already forming, and Steve shakes his head, muttering, “I don’t want to leave.”
“That was,” he says back, and Steve closes his eyes briefly, before he opens them with a groan and heaves himself up to go get a damp cloth to clean them off with. He even tucks Bucky back into his pants, and somehow, even Steve’s huge but gentle hands can’t get him going again.
Bruce winces. “I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but decontamination showers are probably our best bet.”
A hand stops him, however, and Bucky looks down at the other man in confusion.
Bucky looks at him, takes in Steve’s cautiously optimistic face, the heartbreak written in between the hope. He looks away. He can’t take this now, maybe not ever. And anyway, something’s just occurred to him; two pieces have slotted together.
“Steve,” he sighs. “We got into this mess because I was being a persistent asshole and you lost control. At this point, I don’t think either of us are quite father material, but then again, yours died when you were young, and mine was an alcoholic who liked making things to kill people.” The corner of his mouth quirks a bit. “I think we’re definitely an upgrade and, Steve?” he asks, and watches the man across from him suck in his breath.
“Sure thing,” she answers easily. “Would you just like the whole lemon?” she asks, and it’s clear she’s trying for a joke, but Bucky brightens.
Bucky drapes himself dramatically over the foot of Steve’s bed, shoving his feet into Steve’s lap. Steve sighs loudly, and puts the book he was reading onto the floor before idly rubbing Bucky’s heels.
Dr Matty. The only psychologist that he’d ever trusted, and a hell of a woman. Her full name was Mathilda Offman but, as she’d told Tony once,
Tony hesitates a moment before stepping in with him but ultimately makes the step through the doorway, sliding it shut behind him.
The next four weeks are a blur.
, feeling like I’d betrayed Bucky by liking you–”
For her.
and just buying a Baby Depot. Thankfully, he hasn’t quite reached the point of brashness yet, but he feels like he’s getting close.
“I think I can take care of myself, thank you very much.”
A sentimental soul is one thing Bucky Barnes has never been.
When Steve deems him stretched enough he grunts as he lifts Tony even higher, before lining himself up and slowly sliding in. He groans, a low and guttural sound, as he’s slowly buried into Tony. Tony’s eyelids are half-closed with pleasure, and breath slowly leaves his body as he lets himself be impaled, moaning with Steve when he bottoms out. Steve leans against him for a few seconds to catch his breath before Tony cuffs him on the back of the head, saying breathlessly, “I thought you were going to fuck me?”
There’s nothing, then…
“I even named them,” he says, grinning proudly.
Bucky snorts. “Sam took it. Said I couldn’ be trusted.” His face distorts for a second, giving Tony a brief glance of the layers and layers of pain and guilt he has hidden away from his time of the Winter Soldier before he manages control of his expression once again. He peers at Tony. “You alright?”
“You went swimming?” he asks, surprised, and Bucky shrugged.
The day dawns brilliant and blinding, the bright sun reflecting off all the shiny surfaces in the city, warming passerby. Steve comes down to the workshop to tell Tony personally, but he says it quickly as if he’d rather be anywhere than there.
“Bucky, I don’t want to be left alone again,” he says, and Bucky softens, going down to the other man’s level so he can very carefully wrap his arms around him.
“Bucky?” comes a tentative voice from behind him, and Bucky startles, jerking himself up until he’s standing, his left shoulder stump moving forwards in front of his body instinctively as if he still had his metal arm. His right arm reaches for a gun that isn’t there and grabs the nearest sharp object, which happens to be a screwdriver. It hurts like a bitch, and he clenches his jaw as the cut on his back and shoulder is pulled, sending ribbons of agony down his spine.
One surprising aspect of their relationship so far was the lack of any sexual activity it had, and the thoughts Tony had on this. To be absolutely frank, he loved it. There was never any pressure, and he knew the wait was just as much for Bucky was it was for him. Sure, he
“There’s nothing to say,” Steve says through gritted teeth, and Rhodey forces himself to take a few breaths, calming himself.
“Ain’t that neat,” Bucky says, accepting the pad of paper and pen. “Can I rig it like you did your rocking chair?”
“Sarah…?”
All along his front is a warm weight, and he looks down, smiling helplessly, at the still asleep Tony Stark. The other man’s still tucked into his neck, the tip of his nose brushing Bucky’s ear, and as Bucky watches, he breathes out in a little puff, sending a small burst of warm air skittering across Bucky’s skin.
“Maybe you should stay home, Iron Man,” comes a firm voice behind him. “If you’re sick, you shouldn’t be fighting.”
“I just… I don’t know what I was thinking. I’ve just spent so long trying to get over what happened, get over
“You haven’t eaten since lunch, have you?”
“I miss you, Tony! I’ll visit you! Bye!” Rhodey all but yells and hangs up.
Tony is frozen for a second before he shakes himself out of his stupor and tells himself to pull it together, damnit. He clears his throat. “Yeah, they’re for you. You can change… oh, I guess right here is good too.
“Steve?” he calls, and raps on the door harder. “Jarvis, you said Steve was in his room.”
Clint’s voice is uncharacteristically gentle when he carefully pulls Bucky to his side, holding him up with a muscled arm around the waist. “I’m going to need you to stay with me, Barnes. C’mon, let's get you to a car.”
He laughs weakly. “That was fun.”
“Like hell you are!” Bucky roars, and the fragile thing, the thing that Bucky had been wary of, snaps. It’s almost visible, the way the light in Steve’s eyes suddenly splinters, and he’s feeling too much all at once.
“I’d pay you back,” Bucky hastens to add, thinking of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he has sitting in his back account, both from army back pay and Shield.
Sam comes out first looking exhausted, but still grinning at the rest of the team. Bucky follows hesitantly, eyes just as haunted as they were the last time Tony saw him. Still, he looks marginally better, and he’s regained a little color.
Tony grins. “Yeah, meet me in the workshop in two hours.”
“Tony.”
Still, the star is important to have, somehow. He sees it now as a mockery of
“Ooh, what things?” Clint asks, sounding enthusiastic.
“All day, but I usually only lose it at breakfast.” A thought’s starting to tickle the back of his mind and he forces it away aggressively because no, it can’t be.
“What are you still doing in bed? Are you sick?”
she’d explained in a soothing voice that made Bucky want to punch her, just a little.
Bucky never hated Tony’s rambling before, but right now he does, with a burning passion. He hates the obvious insecurity in his eyes, the walls going up and defenses solidifying. “I don’t think it would be a good idea for me to let me go,” he says carefully, and he means it in every sense of the phrase. He hopes Tony catches his double meaning.
Holy fuck. She’s right.
“I noticed,” he notes mildly. He nods at the closed fridge doors. Well, as closed they can get. The metal has bunched on both edges of the doors, identical dents in the shape of hands. “Want to tell me why I’ll be ordering a new fridge later?”
Tony snorts. His stomach suddenly gives a rumble, and he presses a hand to it, wincing.
He gently distangles them and holds Tony out at arm’s length, giving him a onceover. Rhodey looks pointedly at his stomach and the ever-growing bulge, raising his eyebrows. “What’s this about a baby Stark?”
,” he says, his voice cracking and lets a single sob slip out before he clamps his mouth shut against any more. He will
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve beams at that, and starts walking off. “You coming with?” he calls over his shoulder, and Bucky can’t help but grin down at himself, because this is the Steve Rogers he’s starting to remember.
“Is that my full name?”
“No idea,” he rasps.
Also, thank you so much for the comments and kudos from last week's chapter, y'all keep the world spinning :) Also, I updated the summary to make it a little more relevant.
. We just talked about this.”
He lost him the first time going off to the war, when his best friend had walked away in his damn uniform, taking all the stupid with him. The second time when he fell off the fucking train, and the absolute anguish that had filled Steve in that very second still makes him weak in the knees to think about. After that, Steve was almost relieved to be directing the plane’s nose towards the ocean, because he knew he would finally be free of the pain. The third time was much less catastrophic than the last two, and was when Bucky said he didn’t quite remember Steve, at least not the way Steve remembered him.
Rhodey wipes away the kiss, rolling his eyes affectionately, but then he grows more serious. “Tony, he uses your house and money and resources, not to mention your
He’s lost Bucky, his first love and his soulmate, the first person to make him feel adequate like he was, to make him feel like he didn’t have to reach to have everything he ever needed, because it was all right there.
“Can you? Can you really?” Steve asks, looking up incredulously.
Tony grabs the carcass of his comm, dragging a light over to see it better. He looks up at Steve, wanting information.
“I’m here, though,” Steve tells him just softly. “I’m not a figment of your imagination. I’m
“If you’re not careful, I’ll make you do something you regret,” Bucky drawls.
“You’re not fine,” he says softly and looks down, gathers his thoughts, and looks back up.
“Bullshit,” Bucky growls. Tony presses his lips together. Bucky desperately wants to pry them apart and force him to answer the question:
A much gruffer voice, belonging to the driver, calls back that Bucky is pressed up against the divider, and knocked out cold. The other man laughs, and Bucky breathes a sigh of relief when the driver steps out of the car too, the van creaking and then letting up as he exits.
To Tony’s surprise, he doesn’t actually feel any ill feelings towards Steve when Bucky nods happily. Instead, a dull ache in his heart throbs, but it’s way less pronounced than he would ever guess it to be when he thought about this moment of Bucky confirming he was sleeping with another man. He’s… happy for Bucky, he realises with a jolt, and
Materialistically, everything’s there. The painting on the door is the last thing that needs to be finished in the nursery, and Tony has done so much research on baby clothes and things you should buy for them that he’s this close to saying
He moans obscenely when a finger squirms into him, and the next few minutes are spent in silence, broken only by soft grunts from Steve as he fucks Tony open with clever fingers, and desperate murmurs of “oh, God,
“Can I see it?” he asks gruffly.
“Okay,” he whispers, and lets himself lean onto Bucky’s shoulder, securing himself in the warmth there.
“I had to find you,” Steve says, eyes pleading.
“Your new arm…” Tony says slowly, a bit of
“Just… just for sleeping, tonight?” he asks hesitantly, because oh God, yes, that sounds
Tony thinks about ignoring him and keeping silent, but he ultimately decides:
Steve’s in the kitchen when they get up there, cooking scrambled eggs and bacon. He looks up when they enter, offering a small smile for Bruce and a nod for Tony.
Sure, the memory’s slightly sour from the fact that he left not ten minutes later, but for a brief moment, just a couple of minutes, really, Tony had seen Bucky’s true nature, however hard the man tried to hide it.
If it came down to it, however, he would be able to figure it out. The only issue is that at the mere thought of distangling himself from his heap in the corner of his train car and leaning over to ask for his phone, maybe having to potentially raise his voice for her to understand, starts a cold sweat down the back of his neck.
“You offering to carry me to one?” he asks, actually curious to see how the other man will answer.
“No, you’re not. I miss him, too. I, uh, should have realized that I was…”
“God, Tony,” Steve says, and he sounds resigned as if all he wants is to be somewhere else. “Does everything with you have to be about
Nat, sweet beautiful Nat, finds him like this, twenty minutes later, and gently pries his fingers from where they’d sunk into his hair, pulling him close against her lithe body. She gently pets his hair as he turns his head and sobs into her stomach, murmuring to him in Russian.
Bucky and Steve begin separate therapy right away, and for both of them, it’s hell.
Steve’s fingers finally stop their relentless attack on his feet and Bucky breathes a sigh of relief, before Steve suddenly is crawling up his body, a mischievous glint in his eye.
Bucky never said anything about keeping the conversation secret, and Tony knows him well enough now to know that was on purpose. So, he makes an appointment with one Steven Grant Rogers. Well, not really. He just shows up unannounced.
“Who am I?” he asks, and it’s not cheesy, it’s not corny, it doesn’t sound silly, it’s just… honest. “Who do you think I am?” he asks, voice uncharacteristically quiet.
Bucky has done this before.
He’s already fallen in love once, and from the vague memories that tease the edge of his mind, he can remember it being warm, and soft, and thrilling. That’s what it feels like now, here with Tony, and he takes a moment to realize that,
Instead, he makes his way down to Tony’s workshop, only hesitating slightly before knocking on the door. It slides open with a sudden hiss, and Bucky jumps backward in alarm. After a second or two of nothing moving, he cautiously enters the workshop and cringes when music fills his ears.
“Miss you too, and of course. I expect you to be in that hospital room with me in five months, holding my hand as I scream.”
“I just–” he goes back to pacing. “There were people in cars who got into car crashes, and instead of helping, you’re talking with a teenage girl?”
“Well find one, then,” Bucky roars. “The man’s
He hears the one outside calling to the driver, telling him to check on Bucky to make sure he hasn’t gone anywhere. The sound of someone twisting in their seat and looking behind them can be heard, and Bucky keeps absolutely still. He doesn’t breathe.
During this time, the team has been called on three more missions, all of which Tony politely declines. The Winter Soldier hasn’t been spotted at all, and when Tony combs through the videos later he can confirm: Barnes wasn’t there.
“I don’t know if it’s so new,” Bruce says, smiling slightly. “You’re, what? Fifteen weeks along?”
“I’ll find something to do,” Tony says, and winks.
Tony smiles a little, and holds open his arms. “You still want a hug?” he asks, and Bucky rolls his eyes fondly.
. One hand finally settles on the small of his back, stabling Tony as the other curls around his head. The second hand completely covers the nape of Tony’s neck, cradling his head gently, and Tony tilts his head back, panting slightly, giving Steve access to his neck.
Tony Stark, the
In honor of our six years dating, I would like to list the six most special moments of this time we spent together. Maybe you're thinking I suffered some kind of stroke to be acting so romantic, specially because the high moment of my romanticism was buying a box of Shawarmas from the Arabic diner when you song first played on the radio, but I came to the conclusion that six years is a great milestone to start making clear everything I feel about you.
“Nothing, I’m just an underappreciated
I spent my days between college and Instagram, digging every movement of both, sunk in my own misery, crying and listening to a highly destructive combination of Lana del Rey, Taylor Swift, Sam Smith and James Bay. My mom tried to talk; Peter tried to cheer me up, but nothing worked.
I would like to start stating that my name is not Morgan, that is just the pseudonym I chose so I could write to you guys - the reason of the choice is a bit personal, and I'd rather to not say it.

The title was “STEVE ROGERS, you don't fool me”.
“Oh yes, mister stressed pants. I don't know if I can classify it as a crush, but come on, I'm not blind. He is super hot, I noticed it in his last movie, in that shirtless scene. So... hot.” Pepper was staring at him with raised eyebrows, holding back a laughter, and Steve's jaw dropped once more. What the hell was that to keep observing him shirtless? “But, he gets pissed when we talk about him.
, he's a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.”
One minute later and he received a mention:
“Moving on, next one is from Mantis. She wants to know my favorite super-hero. Ownt. Cute. Definitely Iron Man. He obviously uses sarcasm as a form of personal defense, plus,

, run as if your life depends on it, no looking back. I don't want anyone crying in my timeline later ‘cause I'm no therapist.” A pillow went flying directly into Tony's face, and Steve made a mental note to thank that person later. “Guess I forgot to mention, Pepper is here right now playing video games, so in a bit after she loses for the millionth time she might be joining us.”
“Do you like working at these parties?” Tony asked, attempting to start a conversation with the bartender next to him, not knowing whom he should talk to. Pepper had disappeared at the party and he didn't even catch a glimpse of Loki's face the whole night, and, if he’s being honest, the person he wanted was probably fooling himself of a non-existing heterosexuality by kissing Peggy somewhere, and the bartender
Steve knew Nat had told him to stop arguing with this guy and dragging himself into more polemics – in a 5 minute long lecture that ended with her reminding him she had no problem hitting men, client of hers or not - but he just couldn't help it. So although he absolutely hated the guts of that crazy youtuber, if he said anything bad about Steve again, at least he would know first-hand.
“You said ‘my body’”.
Tony stopped right beside Steve, arms touching, and he promptly decided to ignore the energy that waved through his body that moment. “Thank you so much!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve for his bad luck and for choosing a small library with only one cashier. He took a deep breath before approaching.
My heart sank in my chest.
Then I grew up. And found out that the prince is more of an asshole, who doesn't know much about grammar and orthography rules. And it's not exactly a shoe he wants to fit in you.
“I'm a huge fan of both of you”, her voice was slight and shy, and Steve directed a smile in her direction, like he was used to, but Tony simply gave a fake smile for a few seconds after returning to his bored expression “Hum… Can I take two pictures? One between you and the other just you two?”
In the moment Steve was getting his card to give it to the brunette who's life mission seemed to be pissing him off, a shriek was heard from behind him, drawing the attention of both men. He turned around slowly, and behind him was standing a little blue-haired girl with a big smile and wide eyes shifting between the two of them.
"I know you did it on purpose", the smile on Steve's face and his tone of voice were incandescent – proof that the alcohol was also taking its toll on the actor, seeing how he hadn’t got mad at Tony for touching him.
I am sending this letter so that it strategically arrives one day before our anniversary there in Los Angeles, because I want you to make this show thinking about me; if I'm the only the person in your head while you transform music into art, I don't mind us been separated for a little while.

. So just shut up, we are not going to talk about Rogers, even though you all know I'd fuck him. Which already answers Clint's question: I'm top and Steve is definitely a bottom.”
Before the bartender could answer, a loud, familiar voice rang in Tony’s ears, who turned to see the person he wanted so badly. Steve Rogers was standing in front of him, a glass in his hand and a see-through black blouse down the front, and all Stark wanted to do was run his fingers across those pecked abs.
been honest with yourself? @SteveRogers”
It seemed like it would never end. Each picture of them together in social media crushed me, the videos of Stephen's shows were bookmarked in my computer, his smile stamped in the back of my memory, and I would sleep and wake listening to an audio he had sent me before it all came to ruins, saying "don't forget I love you, Tony".
“Do you think I wanna go now? I’m touched by your love and consideration, Pepper, really. Good luck finding someone as cool and stylish as me to go with you. Bye.”
“Oh, sorry, love”, and Tony heard Steve’s sigh of frustration towards the nickname. “You really didn’t catch the fashion tip from my video, did you? Although this one I don’t mind that much.”
"And last, but not least, relationships. Besides acting, Steve did one good thing in his life, which was breaking up with that Sharon. I'm gonna make an impression of the little thing acting.” he adopted a serious expressionless posture, quite different from a few seconds before, “Sharon smiling, Sharon depressed, Sharon dying, Sharing getting dumped. Ok, the focus here is not Sharon. Steve Rogers, honey, you can kiss all the actresses in the world, but let me tell you something: you like dicks, I bet my balls on that. You haven't discovered yourself yet, but you can't fool me and you never will – I can say that fore sure as a gay man, because my gaydar never fails. And if you want someone to prove that to you, just give me a call and I'll gladly do it. Just pick the time and the place." A wink and a playboy smile accompanied that. "Well, I guess that's it guys; watch the new movie of our friend who's in real need of some new pants. Use the hashtag #TStarkVid in twitter to suggest new themes for the next videos, which I promise won't take that long.

Despite the traumas and the holes in my self esteem, I still believed the prince charming would come - he would maybe take a while because he was stuck in the traffic of the 5th Avenue, or maybe he was wasting his time with the wrong duke (not prince). I thought maybe the prince could be my first boyfriend, with his beautiful light eyes and the maximum cheap talk a 16 year old boy can have, with pearls like "hey, babe, can I put my hand inside your pants today?"
“I didn't say anything
After the rage, came the tears. At least, I was already far enough to not give Stephen and Loki that taste. In a cab on the way back home, I soaked Peter's shirt while Wade tried to calm me down with pats in the back, like I was a Golden Retriever taking its first vaccine - I didn't judge him, after all, that was a really generous gesture given his emotional capability.

“But I don't have any issues with you”, he shrugged, giving that sarcastic toothless smile and directing the card machine in Steve's direction, as if telling him to get on with it “Don't flatter yourself, movie star. Card or money?”
@steverogers: “Fashion Week, here I come! Excited to see some old friends again.”

“Secondly, what the hell is going on inside his head? I doubt that there is someone capable of explaining to me, at least, three pictures of his Instagram or those philosophical-like tweets – which I'm sure he finds at those Quotes websites. They don't make sense, and plus, only speaks in codes those who have something to hide. Oh, and before I forget,
He then remembered the huge amount of notifications he'd gotten that morning and entered in Twitter. The top one topic trend was #Stevelovesdicks, with over 100.000 tweets.
, things were finally going to start getting interesting.
He goes silent for a few seconds looking at the screen of his phone, probably looking for some weird questions to answer, Steve thinks.
“Go away,” Tony mumbles, and cracks one eye open. Bucky refuses to find that adorable. “Let me sleep. Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve had a full night of sleep? Three days.”
“I’m sure it does,” Rhodey says, and scoots over on the couch cushions, letting Tony sit down next to him.
“Get out.”
That’s a good question, actually. What
All three are lovely, and Rhodey makes a mental note to take them when he leaves so he has some photos to remember them by. His bed is made perfectly, as always, and Rhodey neatly sets his bag down, before realizing he didn’t have his phone. He must have left it on the workshop couch, then, after taking the picture of the ultrasound. Yet another thing he wants to remember.
“Yeah,” Bucky agrees sadly. “Tony. He was like this...
“For a second…” Bucky starts, and swallows heavily. His next words come out in a whisper. “For a second I thought I had my best friend back. For a second, I thought you were there to tell me it was all a bad dream, that I still had my arm, that I hadn’t really been through seventy years of torture, that I hadn’t really killed hundreds of innocent people. I figured everything would be alright,” Bucky says, his voice cracking as he swallows his tears.
“Steve?” he asks, and the other man looks up slowly.
Over the last week, something seems to have shifted in his metal arm, leaving his shoulder in near-constant excruciating pain.
They go silent then, but it’s a comfortable sort of silence. They’re simply basking in each other’s presence, each in their own heads. They stay like that for a long time, and all Tony can think after a while is how fucking glad he is that Bucky is still alive.
“Yeah, well, he would’ve done the same if he’d stayed. He knew before I did, you know.”
“Why would I be here often?” Steve asks with a cocked eyebrow, and it’s not a genuine question. He’s mocking him.
He wants to scream,
makes a warm feeling bloom through his chest, soothing the ache. The ache disappears completely when Bucky leans down to kiss him long and slow, murmuring a quiet, “thank you” before turning around and gathering ingredients for pancakes.
As for Natasha and him and where they stand with Tony’s new predicament, he made her agree not to tell anyone, and in return, she demanded that as soon as he started showing he had to stop being on active duty. He’d grumbled about it at first but ultimately accepted her terms.
“Holy fuck.”
“So, uh, if you could just let go of me, we can be on our way…”
He turns the page and freezes, because he definitely forgot about this one. He must have done it in the rush of everything because the sketch is unfinished, hurried, crude, but the emotion it captures…
“Maybe a little,” Rhodey grumbles, rolling his eyes fondly, and leads the way out of the workshop.
“No,” Bucky says at the same time Steve says, “What’s that?”
He spies the guy they’re trying to take down… no, scratch that. It’s a girl, and she isn’t mutated, or magical, or even clad in a silly costume like most of the “villains” they fight, as far as Tony can see. Instead, her torso and head are just visible in the glass cockpit of a huge metal robot crashing down the highway, cars veering out of the way of the clunky feet with awful screeches of their brakes.
Bucky holds up the sketchbook so Steve can see, and flips through the pages, exposing drawing after drawing of Tony Stark doing various things. “He made you feel the same. Like there was hope in the world. When he talks to you, you feel like you’re the only person that exists in the world, put in his mind before everyone else, including him.”
He wanders down to the gym for a few hours, checking the simulators to make sure they’re still in good condition. When he’s done with that he goes up to the kitchen and makes himself a sandwich, cautiously sniffing it before cramming it into his mouth.
“Tony, you need to listen to me. I need Bucky back just as bad–”
The next day it happens again. He wakes up, goes to get breakfast, and throws up from the stench of whatever they’re having that morning, even if it’s as bland as porridge. After two more days of this happening, and the team starting to insist he goes to medical, he decides to just stay in his workshop all the time.
They continue, taking the color idea and running with it. Thor seems excited at the prospect of stuffed animals, and they offer the job to him, limiting him to buying seven, no bigger than his hand, which is already larger than Tony’s head. Thor pouts but accepts their terms with a defeated sigh.
“Look, just… Can you do me a favor? Promise me to get it done?”
” Bucky croaks out. “Tony, why aren’t you sleeping?”
Tony shakes his head. “I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, probably that.”
And what a whore. Tony Stark is a whore. He was dirty. He was probably the easiest man alive. It seemed every week there was a new supermodel he was bringing to his bed, yet another person he ensnared to do depraved things with. And God, did that make Steve one of them? Was he just another notch in Tony’s bedpost?
And he is. He’s fucking terrifed. But he’s also done waiting and thinking and sitting on the idea. Yeah, maybe Bucky’s impromptu vacation has sped things up a little, but there’s no time like the present.
The doctor keeps talking to him in a faintly patronizing voice and Tony falls silent, because what else can he say?
He figures that the black leather jacket the Soldier had been wearing was still sufficient, and only stopped to grab a pair of clean socks before making his way to the back of the workshop and rapping on the door.
He finally comes down enough to slowly pull out, an action that makes both of them grit their teeth from discomfort, before he slowly lowers Tony back to the floor, panting and turning himself to the side to lean on the wall next to the other man.
The door opens a few minutes later and the Soldier steps in the room. Tony looks back. “I have your cloth–” his voice dies as he takes in the bare face of the Soldier, hair wet and hanging limply on his shoulders.
Steve sat in front of the computer, sighing while he clicked on the link popping up in his timeline for what felt like the millionth time, soon recognizing the smooth voice and whiskey eyes.
“No, no I didn't.” the youtuber lightly shook his head, while cupping his cheeks and backing his elbows in the balcony. Oh, Steve could be lots of things, but
I was wearing my special pj's for lazy days and it was past shower time. It was a Sunday and I had college the next day, and just to think that my entire body crawled in sadness.
I know we're living a moment kinda weird in our relationship - you didn't express it out loud, and neither did I, but we both know this weird vibe is present, like a dark cloud in the middle on a blue summer sky -, but I also know that we will go through it together and everything will turn out great.
Until, in a fateful day, my story started to take a completely different path. And that only happened because Peter barged in my room with no authorization, kind of like Hurricane Katrina, plucked my earphones out with all the strength he had, looked me deep in the eyes and said:
for me to be here because of you.", to which the blonde looked offended, but tried to hide it. Tony knew him, in a strange way – he could read his expressions, even though Steve often tried to hide them.
It's very simple, imaginary person whom I'm having this dialogue with! I intend to offer my personal experiences with each sign!
make jokes during his interviews? Buddy, you're terrible at it, people don't truly laugh and as an actor, you should recognize a performance. They laugh because you're famous, rich, and cute, but not close to funny. So just stop, ok? STOP.” Steve raised his eyebrows, feeling an anger rising in his veins.

That's it. He was pretty sure by now he had

The intention of this final assignment, by which I'll be evaluated and graded, is to demonstrate by writing, in an online page, the result of an investigation of a theme -
I had all my firsts with Stephen. First relationship, first time, first fight, first DTR, first hungover. And, on my 22nd birthday, first cheating. And public.
“Hm. Does Rhodey know he wasn’t invited?”, Tony asked with malice in his voice. He loved being the preferred friend.
“Bye, love” the youtuber said, returning to behind the balcony, and Steve gave him his card with a serious expression, noticing the other's sarcastic smile.
“I think it's Rogers? You did a video saying you would show him he likes dicks if he wanted to.” the girl said again. Repeating it was really that necessary? Steve knew Tony knew who he was, the entire United States knew who he was, for Christ's sake. Not to brag or sound egocentric, but it
?” he thought. There was a scary amount of notifications, even for someone like him, but given his half-asleep state that early in the morning, he just bothered to check a message from his agent, Natasha Romanoff, with a link, saying, “Watch it. Now.”. That sounded serious enough for him to only be able to deal with after breakfast – thing he told her in his reply text, which granted him a very rude message from her as answer –, so he got up, made his beloved morning cappuccino with Chantilly and turned his laptop on, clicking on the YouTube video Nat had sent him.
youtuber, so he might as well read something. He then got a little sad realizing he did not have any new books in his house. He'd been so busy with work he just hadn't had the time, he supposed, which resulted in him getting on his car and driving to what Waze told him was the closest library, arriving after 15 minutes in a cozy, vintage place.
I'd like to welcome everyone to the first post of my blog, created specially for the final assignment of the best subject of NYU's Journalism course, Online Journalism, taught by the amazing, wise and sexy professor Nick Fury (five points for the compliments, professor).
I'm going to try and update it three times a week, but iIm a really volatile person, so don't quote me on that. Also, i'd like to apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, that's really not my forte :(
“Oh, but in those you indeed are. Very much.”, Stark laughed, making Steve even more annoyed. “Now, if you don’t mind, go back to your friends, because I’m trying to get the bartender's number over here”.
Starry kisses on all of you,
Steve had woken up to that beautiful Saturday morning with his phone buzzing non-stop. “
“Ok, I was nice, now let's put some things out in the open that I know lots of people will hate me for. Yes, I think Steve is a good actor and deserves the awards he's been getting, but can someone let him know to
friend.”
Rogers scoffed.
Proper explanations are due, I finish here my opening post. As soon as I'm able, I'll come back here to describe my first date, preferentially in astrological order, that is, starting with the first star sign of the Zodiac.
However, reality was a bit harsher with me. What actually happened was: my cousin and best friend Peter, alongside his boyfriend Wade, organized a surprise party for my birthday in a Japanese restaurant to which we used to go all time. Stephen went by my house to pick me up, and even if he was trying hard, I felt him really distant. We still went, and, on the middle of the dinner, Peter announced there was a little surprise for me, made by all my friends. A small retrospective of my 22 years of life started to pass on the restaurant's big screen. Everything was going just fine, thank you, until the pictures of my childhood as a toothy and happy kid were replaced by images of Stephen and Loki, a friend from college; they weren't very pleasant, a few very compromising, all incredibly incriminating.
“If I had to stalk a famous person, it would probably be... Bucky Barnes, definitely, he's really handsome and goes to the gym, not to mention he's super nice. That youtuber married to that agent Natasha Romanoff.” He replied to to the person outside the camera, who soon showed their face. She had a cute expression, who radiated joy, not looking anything like someone who would be Tony's friend, Steve noted.
. My copy of
Then Steve’s face breaks open, and the anger is gone, leaving a startling cocktail of emotions that should never be seen on Captain America’s face. Tony reads relief, and wonder, and hope, so much
Tony sets himself down a few feet from the Soldier, flipping up his faceplate. He thinks he sees a flicker of… something... when his face is revealed, but he shrugs it off and holds his hands up in a placating manner.
They fall into silence, and it’s slightly tense. Bucky knows they’re both teetering on the edge of, “what now?” and the problem is, he
“C’mon Stevie, I know you don’t want to, but I need you to sit up for me, okay? I won’t make you leave your room, I just need you to sit up and drink and eat something, alright?”
Steve looks pained for a second like he doesn’t know what to say.
“Sort of, but that’s, um, not the point.”
“Me too. If it wasn’t in the Smithsonian, I’d burn it. That old rag needed to go.”
He’s woken up several times in the middle night, silent tears making his cheeks damp as he clutches at his shoulder desperately, trying to alleviate the fire working its way through it.
Once they’re both situated, Tony still tense and uptight in the warm arms around him, Bucky tucks his head in Tony’s neck, and tells him, “Just relax. You ain’t any help to anybody all strung like this.”
cut on your back, that’s from me cutting you open to take the arm out. Damn Hydra assholes connected the arm to metal framing on your spine. With that amount of weight and strain, you should’ve permanently broken something a long time ago.
Tony’s right: something should’ve broken a long time ago with that kind of strain in those places. Horror rises in Bucky’s gut, but he clamps down on it, knowing it won’t do any good. Tony’s going to do the best he can with what he has, and Bucky has to trust him.
Steve had hated that, had let the guilt and self-disgust rise up within him until he simply couldn’t stand it and had to leave. He’d forgotten all about his suit, all about whatever he had gone to ask Tony, about everything that wasn’t the bitter smile gracing Tony’s lips.
He sets the clothes on the blue bench by the door, separating the two piles. There’s a button on the wall and Steve hits it, a sudden hiss filling the small room as the showers turn on in the next room.
Bucky sighs. “Do you want me to go?” he asks, knowing he’s backing himself into an impossible corner if this backfires on him.
Tony takes one last breath. Okay, this is it. “I’d also like to apologize for dating Bucky once you found him.” Out of the corner of his eye he can see a wounded expression crossing Bucky’s face and he hurries to explain. “I really shouldn’t have, not when you’d just found him, but I just was hurt and pregnant and
“Even I would stalk him. And I'm a lesbian.” the girl declared, receiving a slap from the boy next to her.
“You talked about my body”, Steve said almost between gritted teeth, to which Tony simply smiled in return.
“Um…Hi?” he tried to get the attention of the boy who seemed to be focused on something on his cellphone, not sure how to act. That really
Stephen had beautiful golden eyes and played the guitar in a band that was already starting to make some fame with the pre-teen public. He was very different from the boys my age, starting with the fact he had a car! We went together everywhere, just to sit in the front seats, talking and appreciating each other's companies. I felt the luckiest guy in the world, living a beautiful romance with my very own
“What kind of question even is that??? You're just trying to create a polemic! @THEtonystark”
I loved Journalism.
“How are you going to pay: credit card or money?”
Of course I never even imagined that it would all end the way it did. In the few moments of clarity I had during our crisis, when it started to hit me that the end was near, I just believed that that we would break up and live our lives, until we meet again in a not so distant future, when we'd both be more mature, with good jobs and ready for a lasting relationship.
Yes, yes, another one! But I'm pretty sure mine possesses a significant difference, that will interest both men and women (or any other gender you identify yourself as).
The girl stood between them and asked for a random customer to snap the picture.
“5 million, real 5 million people. You guys have no idea how much that means to me. It's more people than the population of my birth town! Ask me questions through the tag #TStark5M and I'll try to answer them all! Kidding, just the ones I find interesting.”
“Why are you insisting on that? Do you
I hope you're having a wonderful night, doing what you were born to do, and that you return soon to New York (or I'll go to Madrid, hihi). I'll see you next Saturday and promise to even wear a tie for our yearly romantic date, because I know it annoys you how I only wear the same clothes.
MOMENT NUMBER 6: when you accidentally burned my right hand's ring finger with the ashes of the cigar, and in the following moment, burned your own finger, claiming we wouldn't need commitment rings anymore because we had a burn pact.
"But you should at least be able to hook up with a model, right?", Tony asked, analyzing the blonde's expression as he ran a hand over his beard. Definitely gay, "Or YouTubers who have no idea why they're here."
“You say it's trash but you still watch it. What is it: my eyes or my mouth, Steve? @SteveRogers”
I hated waking up early.
"Professional stalker much?" the actor said, to which Tony smirked, noticing every detail of his face – his hair falling lightly across his forehead and his blue eyes that sparkled more than what should be allowed for a human being.
- They'll be fine without a guitarist. That's why we have two of them - he answered, putting his the two warm, familiar and full of calluses musician hands in my face. - I received your letter and drove for six hours to tell you that I love you.
See you next chapter, Mariah
Dear Stephen,
He smelled like the the perfume I had given given him at Christmas and the pollution from New York. Stephen wasn't much into smiling, but he was making an effort.
"That you like dicks and loved our approximation. And that I would love to do a lot more with you.", Tony bit his earlobe, enjoying the fact that the actor looked paralyzed, and walked away laughing. Steve Rogers,
, his favorite super-hero would be Iron Man. He's just as arrogant. He was much more of a Team Cap guy himself – he'd seen the movies after all, the only thing Iron Man really fought for was himself.
Therefore, I, male, young, homosexual, and single will be going out with the twelve star signs of the Zodiac, and will describe everything to you, in this blog; detail by detail, stereotype by stereotype, surprise by surprise.

First, Stephen appeared in my house with all my belongings in a cardboard box - he did not apologize, did not get down on his knees, did not ask to get back together, nor cried in regret; actually, he couldn't even look me in the eyes, just arrived with that stupid threadbare leather jacket, my books that had remained in his house and his guitar's case on his back. "I'm late", he said, putting the box on the floor. "I've got a show nearby and used to opportunity to give back your things".
“Oh.”
Steve took a long deep breath, closing his eyes, trying not to lose completely his reason. He just really liked the black and white.
“Honest????? You don't even know me to say that you're being honest @THEtonystark”
bad”, he said laughing, and Steve was dying to know what was so funny. “I just gave my opinions on a few things, but if you want me to do another, just let me know”.
He dialled the first contact on his recent calls, and said:
“What invitation?”, he asked, letting his curiosity slip in his voice.
I, just like many of you (I hope so), started to search about astrology quite recently, and realized there are many theories out there, but almost zero practical experiences on the subject - is there a better way to learn something than to live it and feel it in your own skin?
“TONY!!” she screamed in excitement, to the point he had to remove his phone from his ear from how loud it was, “I have an invitation for you”.
"That I don’t know how to dress?”, he said, playing the obtuse card, and the smile on Steve’s face was more than perfect.
Steve was still facing the screen of his computer jaw-dropped, in complete shock. That motherfucker had just said
5 million people and he's already being arrogant. Steve couldn't help the eye roll. He really wanted to understand why people would subscribe to listen to the shit he says, which is apparently the only thing he does.
handsome, no denying
I hope you enjoy the blog and that you can, at least, have a few good laughs over this crazy anthropological research! I also hope to get an A+ in the subject, because I'm pouring my heart and soul here (I'm just gonna leave that hanging here, professor).
Yeah, that wasn't quite what happened.
bitch, Steve wanted to smash his face in that balcony until his whiskey eyes were blood-crimson.
Steve was so angry he could almost feel his face becoming red. He entered in Twitter, already hearing the complaints he would listen from Natasha later, and tweeted
He slammed his computer shut so strongly he probably broke it.
The party went by in a blur (he kissed, drank and actually had a great time talking to two Natasha and Bucky, who were not nearly as constipated as the ginger’s client, in Tony’s mere opinion, which allowed for a great conversation), and Tony found himself thinking maybe he should go dancing, or looking for Pepper in the middle of the crowd, but just the thought of having to see the girl kissing some model makes him bored. He decided to get up from where he was and choose what to do as he went, not at all expecting to run into someone.
Tony Stark.
So..... it's been 8 months. I have no excuses for myself. But I PROMISE this time I'm going to be finish this au, AND it's going to happen in a very acceptable time range!
Tony was sitting on his couch, finishing his latest assignment for one of his classes. He loved solving equations, especially the tricky ones, but he was just so tired from work, school and his channel that being a math genius that morning felt more like a burden than a gift. Suddenly, his phone rang. It was Pepper.
OOOOH, and fun fact because I love those: Pepper's and Loki's major is Fashion - that's why they had tickets and etc; that's also how Loki ended up joining the squad, because Pepper, Rhodey and Tony are all childhood buddies and such, and after Pepper met Loki in one of her classes, they ended up adopting the little gay devil.
Hey guysss, soo, this is something i've had on my mind for quite a while, really hope u enjoy it! :)
My favorite childhood movie was Cinderella. I used to watch at least once a day, until I drove my mom mad with the hallucinated and out of tone singing of an 8-year-old - that's probably why suddenly the tape decided "not to roll anymore".
“Third, button up those shirts you steal from your grandma, they are ugly as hell, and coming from someone who doesn't have any knowledge on fashion, even my mom dresses better. It's like you are from the 40s and just woke up in the 21st century and has no clue how to dress."
In pre-school, boys called me a rabbit, because my front teeth were the size of ultra tampons and my mom used to be quite generous when it came to feeding me. In middle school, however, I went through my growth spurt and lost the spare weight, but, on the other hand, my nickname affectionately became faggot, because, well, I was the most likely among them to be gay, which was entirely true - at least the growth rhythm of my teeth slowed down and soon they were all the same size and proportional to my face. In high school, I used to spend most of my free time hidden in the library, reading romances and classics, since life didn't turned out to be the Adam Sandler cheap comedy movie I thought it would.
Every time a paragraph starts with “he remembers” it’s a new memory :)
Tony coats his fingers in lube and wraps a hand around him, squeezing very gently before slicking it up and down Bucky’s cock. He reaches up on his tip toes and kisses Bucky, lazily sliding his tongue into the other man’s mouth as Bucky gasps in pleasure, before trailing kisses down his neck and sucking a mark into his clavicle.
“Aww, Brucie, don’t get all soft on me now. I’m perfectly fine, see?” he does a little twirl, mindful of the hot cup of liquid in his hand, to demonstrate the fact. “I’m always okay.”
“What?” Steve asks sharply, and looks up, pinning his gaze to Tony’s. His eyes are wild, panicked. “I thought you said you could track him. Through his arm.”
Bucky looks away.
It makes things twist inside Tony, ugly, not pretty, things. He ultimately decides to ignore it and pulls the plate Steve offers towards him, inhaling the scent of the eggs. His stomach suddenly rolls and he claps a hand over his mouth, running to the trash bin and leaning over it where he promptly empties the contents of his stomach.
So no, it isn’t the stuff he’s worried about, or even his daughter, by extension. The doctor’s informed him several times that his body and the baby will be fine before, during, and after the delivery, and there’s nothing he should really be worrying about (he does, anyway. It’s something all expectant people do).
His prosthetic arm is the only limb and part of his body that isn’t trembling like a leaf and he holds it in his flesh hand, digging his fingers in between the metal plates, trying to make that hand stop shaking, too.
“You still love him,” he continues, and he sees Tony’s eyes flash with fury. “I know you do, and that’s fine. I’m not asking you to not. I just… I just want to know your standpoint.”
Bucky laughed hollowly, and Steve hated the sound with a burning passion, hated the emptiness of it, hated how it sounded like Bucky was
Bucky smiles indulgently. “You are
Whatever it is, it makes Tony want to run over and give him a hug, but he doesn’t. Instead, he hardens his own expression and turns to Bucky, giving him a firm kiss. “Let’s go,” he mutters, and gently leans his weight away from Bucky’s body, wincing and wobbling slightly as his legs and lower back protest loudly.
Clint loses his croissant to the sidewalk, the Winter Soldier shows up twice and plays nurse, Steve clenches his jaw too much, and Tony... Tony's been seein' a lot of his toilet bowl.
He exits the elevator in jerky steps, walking through his quarters, barely taking in the familiar sparse surroundings, and making a beeline for the bed. Instead of laying in it, he sits down and hunches over himself, cradling his head in his hands.
The third is grey, and contains any memories or scenes he might remember from before the ice. Drawing after sketch after painting of the Howlies, his mother, Peggy, the girls Bucky would try to set him up with, his old Captain America uniform, and so much more peek out from between the pages. Steve spends an inordinate amount of time combing through it and smiling, mostly trying to distract him from the last three he has to go through. Eventually, though, he has to close the book with a watery smile and pick up the remaining sketchbooks, his heart doing something funny as he opens the first one.
“I really don’t,” Bucky agrees, going over to the dresser to gather all the stuffed animals in his arms. He plops down between Tony’s legs, setting out the animals in front of him. “What do you think he was thinking, with these?”
She scowls at him, and he notices vaguely that she looks really young. She looks pretty tall and there’s a mature downturn to her mouth that suggests some sort of sadness or tragedy, but upon closer inspection, she couldn’t be any older than seventeen.
“Steve?”
She hums thoughtfully. “I don’t think even he knows.”
Tony’s not ashamed to admit he gets a little choked up at hearing his oldest friend’s voice. “Platypus,” he breathes. “Oh, God, Rhodey I miss you so much.”
“You too, Tony,” he says genially, and Tony finds he doesn’t even have to force the small smile this time.
Next chapter we'll get to see way more Stony, and possibly the beginnings of the birth of a certain baby...?
So, escape. If he piles the boxes haphazardly in front of the little window, he can make it look like the van tumbled and blocked it. They probably won’t think much of it. Or will they? Bucky tries to lean forward to inspect the cardboard boxes and immediately starts listing to the side. He hits the van floor with a dull thump, and he can’t stop the quiet groan that escapes through his lips for that.
He’s angry and tired, and he wants nothing more than to curl up into a ball and sleep. He fights the urge, however, because there’s something he needs to do first.
They sit in silence for a few minutes, letting JARVIS do his magic, and Tony’s eyes keep flicking to his, as if he wants to say something, but can’t quite bring himself to. Bucky grows extremely curious, but manages not to say anything, figuring that pushing him isn’t going to do anything.
“Do you have a picture?” he finally offers, and Tony nods before fishing through his pocket and pulling out a glossy black and white photo.
Now, a couple of weeks later, Tony looks up from the half-assembled motorcycle on his floor, scowling. “I told you not to let anyone… Rhodey!”
, disrupting his world, his life, his
Tony’s just laughing, rubbing his hand in the other. “Don’t worry about it,” he grins. “I shouldn’t have snuck up on you.” He nods towards the table. “What were you looking at?”
Bucky, alarmed, shoots a hand out to try to steady him, but Tony grits his teeth and catches it before it can land on his shoulder, using it to tug Bucky out of the room and into the hallway.
He can’t stop running his tongue lightly over his lips, still slightly puffy from the kiss. His arms and hands are limp at his sides, hanging like an unmanned marionette's. They feel clumsy, stupid, where before they had purpose, they had reason, they were there to pull Tony closer, to curl around the smaller man and draw him to Steve, to cup the sharp line of that beautiful jaw and gaze into those soft brown eyes.
“You coward,” Bucky yells. “Always taking the easy way out. How could you? How could you do this to Tony? Why did you do this to
“What’s wrong with my old arm?” Bucky asks, thinking about it on the table behind him. Can’t Tony just fix it?
“Tony.”
Bucky takes a deep breath, trying to master himself as Bruce’s words tumble around in his head.
“With you?” Bucky asks skeptically, and Tony laughs.
Beside him, the Soldier is silent. “I have… a fixation, if you will, on your Captain. My instincts scream at me to shoot him. Who is he?”
Armed with instructions, Bucky reenters Steve’s room, crossing the floor to pull open the curtains. Light floods the room, washing everything in the bright yellow of the midday sun, and Steve hisses. Bucky pays no mind and very gently pulls the covers away from Steve’s chin a bit, muttering to his friend all the while.
“...being insensitive.”
Steve doesn’t say anything. He doesn't acknowledge Bucky. “
From where he’s sitting, Bucky can see that it’s a diagram of his arm, laid out in painstaking detail with arrows and calculations and jotted down words. The whole thing seems chaotic and unorganized to him, but it makes perfect sense to Tony, whose intelligent eyes skim over it thoughtfully, adjusting margins and writing down new things with his finger.
