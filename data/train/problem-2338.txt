I glanced at Holmes. His black umbrella was leaning against his chair. I frowned and shook my head – how on earth would I notice such a thing?
The smell by the red umbrella handle – the smell by the first painting on the wall – the smell by the second – ah! Epifanes varnish. Sherlock makes a pirouette, his Belstaff twirling around his legs, a heavy, woollen tutu. It nearly knocks Donovan out of the way – irrelevant.
He moves around John as if he owns him, counting on John constantly being there. John doesn't know whether to be offended by being taken for granted, or flattered that Sherlock seems to enjoy him being there. In his own way.
Something in that expression makes honey pour through Sherlock's limbs and his stomach warm like hot chocolate.
John tries to catch his breath, but he keeps twitching against Sherlock's palm. The pleasure doesn't lessen, instead it keeps building, and soon his pelvis is moving again. Sherlock's hand tightens, almost imperceptibly at first.
“Do you have any idea how disastrous it would have been if you were found?” His voice was low and flat now, lacking the smarmy quality I had already come to hate.
It seems far-fetched that Mycroft had set out to disrupt Sherlock’s sock index when he gave him black socks for Christmas. John thought it was sort of nice, giving Sherlock something practical he would no doubt have use for – and apparently Sherlock
I reined in my smile before I walked up to them, crouching behind their chairs. “Excuse me, Sherlock.”
With every passing day, I felt more at home at the Moulin Rouge. The contrasts of the extravagant and the worn was charming, and the motley ensemble of optimistic people was interesting to work with. People were having genuine fun with the scenes I was placing them in, and seeing it all come to life before my eyes was one of the more beautiful experiences I'd had.
His mouth fell closed, and he stared into my eyes. We were frozen in place, my room turned to unforgiving ice around us. The only warmth was the connection between our eyes, like a living thing vibrating between us.
“Without the lead actor, there is no show”, he said mildly. “Do you realise what you are doing to the Moulin Rouge?”
I look up again and see that William has turned. While he plays he's moving in a slow circle on the spot, so that his eyes can always be fixed on me. He creates the music entirely based on the way I move.
I tried to catch his eye, but he avoided it, keeping his real reasons hidden. “We have to end it”, he repeated, because what good would it do me to keep risking everything by seeing him, only to be destroyed when he died?
“I shall hold the deeds to the Moulin Rouge. And if there are any complications, my manservant Moran will deal with it in the only language you underworld show-folk understand.”
John is entirely on top of him now. At some point, Sherlock's legs have wrapped around John's hips. He cannot for the life of him remember making such a bold decision, but he keeps clinging to John with strong legs, wanting him irrationally closer.
And it is. So here I am. Still haven't touched that razor, but I did change clothes. Not anything decent, really, just a vest with an old waistcoat thrown over it, but at least I don't smell now. My rooms are filled with a deep golden morning light, just like it was that agonising morning last autumn… and I am going to finish our story.
He knows from the way John's weight evens out between his feet that he got it right; John is desperately bored. He is completely starved of mystery and surprises. So Sherlock makes sure to keep surprising him, never giving him a chance to keep up with their conversation, baffling him over and over again. John's cane sits loosely in his hand, and Sherlock brushes past him, adding the absurd line about a riding crop in the mortuary just to solidify the impression.
thinking about him – tall and strong, dark voice, heavy scent – makes John feel strangely dizzy. Time stops moving in reality and pours instead into the memory, letting it move in a new direction.
The second day, I went over to the Moulin Rouge with a spring in my step. I wanted more time with Sherlock, to see him act, to see him smile. Yes, he had been difficult to get to the day before, but I was hoping that I had passed some test and earned his respect.
Lights were shining from the red-tinted windows in the enormous belly, but the chamber in the head was dark now. I tried to see something through the heart-opening, but all I got was a glimpse of the interior glowing softly with the lights from the ground below and the mill itself. I wanted to go back in there. I didn't feel finished. Yes, I had gotten the job which was all I should really ask for – but in the process, something else seemed to have started, something that frighteningly felt as important as the work, if not more.
“Sherlock”, I gasped, my hands roaming fast all over him, unable to decide how to hold him in a way that would allow me to keep him. “I-”
When I approached, I recognised Moriarty. They were watching the rehearsal on stage, both looking bored. Sherlock's eyes were sharply painted with black, which made him look unapproachable and frail at the same time. He didn't move a muscle when I passed them by, not even a flicker of his eyes. Something undefinable in the air between their two bodies made me stop myself from walking up to greet him.
At some point it was more hot breaths than kisses. I gave him his air to breathe and he gave me mine.
The thirty-first year, Mrs Hudson shrinks and fades. John is there with calm and steady hands. Sherlock tries to be there too, but he is buzzing with all the terribly sad things he has encapsulated in his chest. He can't be with her without pacing around her, his strides long and his coat as dramatic as ever. He loathes himself for causing her stress like that, until she roars at him that she isn't stressed, she just wants her dear boy there, even if he is so afraid of himself that he can't be still.
When Sherlock is too absorbed by his experiment, John tries to distract himself by cleaning the flat. But under their bed, he finds something that makes his chest even tighter with longing.
I started walking again, slowly passing through the audience. They were all looking at me, but I didn't look back. I stared at the doors in front of me, the entrance to the theatre. Through the windows above, I could see the turning red blades. They went on and on, implacable.
Sherlock turns to stare at his husband, standing half a step behind him and looking critically out at the garden. “I didn’t get as far as I hoped”, John says sheepishly. “I never knew gardening took so much time.”
I want to freeze time the moment the words leave his mouth. I want to gather them up before they can evaporate in the air, mould them in iron and save them for all time.
Sherlock's brain kicks into gear, frightening his heart into a pounding rhythm. How did they end up like this? How long has John been awake? Is it okay for friends to sleep like this? Where does the line go? Should he move away? Or could he get away with moving closer?
She is still dozing on my chest. The complete peace on her face is fascinating to me, especially in view of what John and I are currently discussing. There is something beautiful in her ability to live on and sleep on a stranger's chest even in the ashes of a world that could have been.
Sherlock's body pressing against him is familiar and new at the same time. The tall man ducks his head to tuck it by John's neck, letting himself be held. He fits in John's arms better than he should. Delicate hands slide lightly up to John's shoulder blades, and John feels the tension easing out of his shoulders.
“Sherlock, I cannot fix everything.” Holmes' voice had turned sharp. “If we lose this chance, there is no guarantee that I can get you another-”
Actually, he's seen pretty boys through his whole life. That blonde who always had his clarinet lessons after John's. The James Bond crushes. Brian, oh, Brian, how much John's been turning that one over in his head. And then there's
The piece of furniture is large for a cupboard, but small to contain two grown men. It is impossible to stand there without being keenly aware of everything John Watson does. The way he audibly tries to control his breathing. The way he clenches and unclenches his fists. Sherlock can practically feel the adrenalin in John's veins, making John buzz with hot blood.
He was sitting with his back straight and his silk stocking-clad legs neatly folded, the polished high heels on his foot dangling over the floor. The slim sleeves of the dress reached just below his elbows, and he held his arms close to his body, hands in his lap. His posture was unfamiliar; subdued, small; his body slightly angled toward the suited man sitting on the chair next to him.
The great silence was starting to be disturbed by the confused shiftings of the audience. A murmur started somewhere in the middle, steadily spreading to all sides.
And that was enough of that. I rose from my chair and folded my arms across my chest, trying to take up as much space as I could with my short build. “It's not your call, Sherlock.”
, Sherlock wants to accuse him. But really, he only has himself to blame for creating all that space for John in the first place. So instead he just snarls.
I sat down beside Gregory in one of the alcoves. He had made his way through several glasses of absinthe already, and he wordlessly handed me one. I brutally downed it all in one go, my face twisting.
It is redundant and they both know it. Sherlock sighs and accepts it as John’s wordless understanding.
The whole show was coming together, my carefully chiselled script playing itself over and over right before me. It was an unearthly experience to see it so palpable and real, and to stand on the floor, knowing that in a few days it would be covered with rows upon rows of chairs, filled with people decked in their finery coming to be entertained. And Sherlock… seeing Sherlock on stage was magical.
The Moulin Rouge. A nightclub, a dance hall, a bordello. A kingdom of night-time pleasures, a feast of colours erupting when the sun set. A sea of glimmering eyes like diamonds, uncut and raw, a place where the rich and powerful came to play with the young and beautiful creatures of the underworld.
“Because the moment I saw you, your image was burned into my mind. I saw that you were extraordinary”
The forty-eighth year, Sherlock refuses to have a large party for his eightieth birthday. John chuckles at the fact that he believed John would even try to force that upon him, and takes him to the ballet to celebrate. John cannot take his eyes off Sherlock in his dark tailcoat, and the air around them is vibrating and reverent during the performance, stolen kisses scattered through it.
Sherlock is back in the third room on the right, throws himself out of it and into the opposite door. Bedroom. In the armchair; John's breathing. Steady and calm, a quiet sort of poetry in the way his lungs absorb oxygen and discard carbon dioxide. Sherlock listens and breathes with him. It makes his own lungs rejoice.
It got worse when I arrived at the Moulin Rouge. It wasn't only the journalist that was visiting that day; Moriarty was there again. His hand rested on the small of Sherlock's back when I first spotted them.
“Really, John-”, Sherlock starts, deflective scowl already in place, and John is quick to interrupt.
You know what, you're right. It doesn't matter what you say. You stood on the edge and told me to keep my eyes fixed on you when you jumped. You asked me to watch that, you asked me like it was something I had to do if I loved you. And you must have known I did. Still you left me with no answers, no idea why you wanted to die. We were together, Sherlock, we had been together for less than four months, and those months were the happiest of my life. Then you took your life and I hated myself for not having noticed you weren't happy.
In the dance barn of Sidensjö, people have realised that he and I are friends. They stop looking at us oddly and instead simply move to make room for the two of us to sit together. When he plays, I dance, but when he doesn't, I sort of… forget to. It's far too interesting to sit with him on the bench.
, John?” He scoffs, but I can tell that he's pleased. And he eats more than half of them in one night.
The bed creaks, and Watson's boot appears on the ladder. He hasn't undressed either; only removed the jacket, leaving a sand-coloured tank top. Watson lowers himself to the floor, remarkably quiet in his sturdy boots, and steals out to the restroom. Sherlock's heart starts pounding inexplicably when he thinks about how when Watson comes back, their eyes might meet through the semi-darkness.
“His life is the only one that matters.” Sherlock's rasping voice was nearly unrecognisable. “I have no time left, anyway.”
“Try to sleep on your left side tonight”, John says, and Sherlock complies at once, curling into a ball as tiny as he can with his long limbs. “Good night, idiot”, John whispers, sliding his hand through Sherlock's thick curls before leaving.
Yep, even Sherlock Holmes gets brainwashed by the popular music of his time. This makes it all even more wonderful, because he obviously didn't choose to do this.
“Of course. Follow me.” Sherlock strode away towards the door without even glancing at the costume assistant who had been working with him.
A tremble goes through the earth beneath my chair. I look down at her peaceful face and realise that is indeed what I am to her. Every day, I hold her when she sleeps; and when she needs to sleep but can't, I sing until she does. I feed her; I dress her. I do not know her as intimately as John does, but I am there every day. To her, I am her second parent.
Sherlock thinks for a while. He has never had a reason to tell this story. He is surprised that on this particular day, he doesn’t mind.
After a while, he leaned in to me. I ducked my head when he put his mouth close to my ear. “See how Mycroft's umbrella is furled the wrong way?” he murmured, smooth French tickling fine hairs.
There is a special sort of warmth in a bed that John Watson is sleeping in. Sherlock didn’t realise he was chilled until he crawls in under John’s duvet in the early morning and gets to share his sleepy heat. Perhaps Sherlock has in fact been cold his entire life, because he has never felt warmth like this. It seeps into his very bones.
something more for John, and he wonders how on earth he will know what that would be. He wonders if he should loosen his grip.
John's jaw drops to release a tense breath, and without further ado he reaches out to open Sherlock's belt.
“Well, I should think this is already clear to you, but-” Sherlock quashes his shyness and speaks instead with his practised, detached voice: “Penetrative intercourse will not take place during this vacation. I have no reservations to the act itself, and no objections to performing it with you, but I simply cannot see myself being… ready in only four days’ time.”
“It might get weird living together”, John says. “I mean, moving in together is something you save for later. When the relationship is more established.”
By the end of the year, John publishes his second book about their adventures at the same time as Sherlock publishes his beekeeping handbook.
But if I don't – if I refuse to remember this one moment – I think I will stop being John Watson. And if I don't, I fear that Sherlock Holmes will cease to exist. I can barely live in a world in which he is dead – if he disappeared entirely, I think I would too.
It makes something in the bottom of my soul change. I can feel it; hot iron moulding around a new reality.
“Sherlock.” Holmes walked into the room, stopping next to his chair. “You know it's in the contract.”
Let me remind you that I have written this fic to the end, and I'm posting new chapters when I'm done editing them with my beta. This time I actually have some more chapters queued up, but I'll still take a few day's break from posting in order to, in my beta's words, "allow the emotions to fully mature - think of it as allowing fine cheese or red wine to reach room temperature for maximum flavour". (The flavour, in this case, being heavy angst. You're welcome.)
It fits so well in his hand. Sherlock makes sense in his arms in the mornings, in the evenings, within the four walls of their home. But Sherlock is male and it's not enough.
She sighs from John's lap and my gaze drops to her. She is content in such a simple yet profound way, inspiring the same in me. Her face serves to remind me that this is reality. This is as real as the sleeping loveliness of her.
He’s not entirely certain what it is he’s doing, but he can feel it in his almost defiant posture; everything about him demands to be looked at. And oh, John
“No, I don't mean just that. His mind… he's an actual genius.” I studied my fingertips lightly stroking the space key on my typewriter, not wanting to show the insecurities shining through my eyes. “I don't know what he's doing in a place like this. This show…”
Martha joined Stamford by the wall that is almost entirely covered with poems and short stories. Since Stamford talked me into finishing this script, I've found myself inspired to write other things, too. It baffles me, the way the words keep melding under my hands. It's been so long since I felt the pure joy of it, but now, I think I do.
Sherlock's mind is dancing. A light allegro in major key. Data is perched upon the notes, facts cradled in his outstretched hands, deductions appearing underneath his feet to set him off into the next position.
The suits were quiet as though they were dead. The unforgiving truth of human fragility didn't belong inside the thick walls of the Moulin Rouge. Only one person moved; one of the older dancers, a woman in an elegant purple dress, with a thin veil of curly, dark blonde hair falling over her forehead. Her whisper when she reached Gregory was loud in the large silence:
Thank you to everyone who has read, squealed, yelled, and cried with me throughout this journey. This fic has been one of my greatest writing experiences, and I am so happy to see you share my love for the story and the boys. I'm very sad to end it, especially as I for the first time in two years won't jump directly into a new fic project - right now I'm focusing on my original novel. I do have several Johnlock fics planned though, and I can't wait to get back to it and give them some fluffy, happy moments with a vibrantly alive Sherlock!
“Badly.” The word is almost indistinguishable. All his consonants seem to have disappeared. He thinks about touching John in return, but he cannot move his arms.
”, I repeated, a warning hidden in my low voice. Stamford didn't move, and at once the pain clawed up through my throat, choking me and making my fists clench. “Go away!” I yelled.
”, John counters, and then blushes. “Er, I didn't mean…” His voice sounds strangled. “I just… well, you know you're my best friend.”
When he glanced into the mirror, he gasped and dropped the bottle he was holding. Holmes stood motionless in the doorway, watching him.
The orchestra played the last crescendo, cutting off dramatically. As soon as the music silenced, everyone turned to the one person in the audience, eagerly waiting for his applause.
“Why are you here?” Sherlock breathed, and he wasn't aware of saying it out loud until Moriarty answered him.
“I know you're an army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you had a string of casual lovers there, all male, and that you've had one long-term girlfriend before you enlisted. I know you are not out as bisexual; possibly because you see no reason to as you don't have a boyfriend; more likely because your sister is a lesbian and you feel obligated towards your parents to be the 'good' son. And I know that you have been wanting to put your fingers in my hair and kiss me since the moment you walked in.” Sherlock takes another step forward, breaching John's personal space. “That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?”
how he acts when he's in my arms. He's not a sociopath. He's a person who thinks the night sky is beautiful, who loves dogs, who gets shy at innuendos, and who looks at me like I'm the whole world when he touches me. He's the cruellest man I know, but he's also all that.
At night, he asked me to sing our song to him. And I did, quietly, so that only he would hear me. He rested his head on my chest, listening to my song from inside of me. If I felt something wet on my chest, I simply held him closer, stroking his hair until he fell asleep.
“So you think that we could be more than friends.” Sherlock is impressed by the steadiness of his own voice.
He doesn't meet my eyes, but he doesn't try to hide either. He watches the sky wearing an expression of awe, as if he's witnessing magic he didn't believe in. It makes him look very young, and very human.
I glanced at the door behind me. Its golden solidity was much too far away, and Moriarty was standing right in the middle of the room. There was no way I could get out of there if Moriarty wasn't thoroughly distracted – or, preferably, gone.
At first, I'm afraid that William won't be there this week either. But when he is, I understand that his presence doesn't help the flutter in my stomach
Another chapter that doesn't really have a song of its own - so if you want to listen to something while reading, I'll drop the same one as in the previous chapter:
I gripped my cane tightly and shook my head. The magic of the red Moulin Rouge vestibule wasn't enough to strip off my limp. The woman got a mean glint in her eyes when she moved away, still turned to me.
He stopped by the window, looking out over the rooftops, or perhaps at his own reflection. I watched his back, the red silk, the black braces.
As he straightens and scoops up another handful of bees from the cluster, he has the most marvellous feeling of connection with the tiny creatures. They let him move them without protest as if they trust him. And with the fourth handful, he can finally spot the queen. She is crawling on top of the bees he holds in his hand, gold-brown and beautiful.
The sun is setting over the desert. The colours flashing outside the bus window dissipate, settling into the darkening turquoise of the sky, the sharp black contours of the hills, and the warm gold of the last sun glow just below the ridges.
Holmes played the game well. Even under Moriarty's motionless stare, he went on and on about Sherlock's devotion, knowing how to tempt the duke's weak spots. Moriarty played the game even better. He saw the dread under Holmes' diplomatic mask and deduced that the owner had finally caught on. Holmes knew about me.
This is the man that everyone thought was a heartless machine. How far he had evolved from the time when he pronounced himself incapable of emotion and empathy, when even in that moment, he knew that this would haunt me. With his precious last breaths, he wanted to make sure that I wouldn't be in pain.
When I open my eyes I notice they are wet. I can feel John watching me surreptitiously but I ignore him. I do something I have not yet dared to do in his presence, afraid to lay a claim that is not mine; I duck my head to place a kiss on her forehead.
After midnight he's getting tired, and at one point he almost falls asleep. He jerks himself awake for fear that he'll dream of a deserted house, Sherlock standing in it with a pill between his fingers, the two window panes too thick for John's scream to be heard.
He has been through hell. A whole different kind of hell than mine. I know about the kills, I know about the scars. Soon the only thing he hasn't told me is the story of the 12
A low-lying mist flows across the meadows. “The fae are dancing”, my grandmother always says on nights like these, when the white fog shifts and rolls just above the ground. In the swirling mist, you can almost see delicate women in sheer white silk, dancing together, surrounding the house with their dreamlike haze.
John's lips immediately part to nip at Sherlock's lower lip, and very soon there is a hint of teeth as well. All of a sudden John is in complete control of the situation, and Sherlock is an awkward mess, simply gaping and hoping John will guide him right. And oh, he does. His little soldier holds him steady with hands locked in his curls, and his mouth is – is –
“You know exactly what I want to hear, don't you?” I murmured. “You've deduced it from the creases on my shirt or the way I arrange the pages on my desk – that's what you do, that's your job.”
John means to keep the kiss short, but at this point, he really should have learned that that sort of plan never works with Sherlock. Sherlock's mouth is tender and attentive, keeping the touch light so that when he parts his lips, a thrill goes through John with all that he wants and almost has.
I don't know how to explain it. It wasn't something I chose to do, like I would have chosen to start kissing him. I didn't, I distinctly didn't choose that. Instead, in his arms, I slipped into something far more erotic than that, and when it started for real, we were already so far gone. I know I wrote that I don't cheat – but it's Sherlock
“I think I put a lid on it very early on. We were going to live together and I didn’t want to, you know. Complicate things. And also because you’re a man, I guess. Anyway I’m not sure I should go near that lid now, because what happens if I
Moriarty remained on the balcony for another second. His eyes on me were frightening even from that distance. Then he turned and followed Sherlock inside with an eerie calm, closing the balcony doors behind him.
“Um, are you sure?” Stamford's gaze was fixed on something behind my back, and I guiltily turned around.
They stared at one another. Sherlock was breathing heavily, not quite managing to hide the pain of betrayal on his face. There was something soft in Holmes' eyes, something aching to reach out and comfort. Instead, he chose to stand his ground.
I watch him in silence. Every time he touches something I've carved with my own hands, I imagine I can feel his fingers ghosting over my skin.
It was a bold promise. Some days I think how stupid it was to promise something I so obviously couldn't keep. But then, some days, I believe that perhaps I did keep this promise. Perhaps there is a way for him to be with me now, even if I cannot be with him.
By the time they rolled into London, Sherlock had grown accustomed to John's hand in his. His breathing was steady, his heart calm. Without the nervousness he could
He had to let them think they had it right, of course. If they found out he was Sherlock Holmes, it would have been worse. And the thing was, he knew the things they asked him about. He had deduced it during his time in the city, some things he deduced in the actual cell they kept him in. But he couldn't give it up too quickly, because that would have blown his cover. So he let them whip his back.
Martha didn't look at Holmes. “He just fainted.” Her voice was thin and she shook her head. “We don't know.” She visibly abstained from looking at the doctor and whatever she would be able to read on his face.
He always says it with an air of superiority, as if he's surprised that these little people dare speak to John Watson-Holmes' chosen
“It is.” Sherlock sucks his lips in between his teeth, then adds, because this much at least is an obvious fact: “I’d like to spend the rest of my life with you.”
I have been writing all night. I couldn't bring myself to stop once I'd started. The tapping of the keys that sounded fateful through the first chapter of our story has lightened in pace with the day. Now it sounds homely and calm. The ruins outside my window don't look as grim in the soft morning light, and the emptiness within my walls isn't so unforgiving when I'm surrounded by papers upon papers filled with Sherlock's name.
He stood motionless before his reflection. His skin was transparent, the rings under his eyes were bruises. His lips were pale and cracked.
“Yes, Doctor”, Sherlock breathes, and shocked at his own daring, he drops his hands to his fly and unzips it.
“You will transform from a dirty cancan-dancer into an actor, because of me. I hold every possibility for you in my hands. I can make you a star. I can consume you until you stop craving drugs and start craving
John puts his hands behind his neck and looks thoughtfully out the window. The sky is overcast, giving the summer day a bright grey shade.
“The dialogue doesn't flow! This scene doesn't keep with the pace and tone of the rest of the script. I can't speak these words.”
“Really, Mary?” A deep voice made her jerk and pull her hand back. “You couldn't be bothered to change into a fresh suspender belt after yesterday's client?”
This is why they're looking at us in confusion when we're speaking. No one else bothers to talk to him, and they wonder why I do. They don't know. They don't see.
Sherlock looks over at him, startled. John looks back at him with steady, blue eyes, and cups his face in both hands.
After that, we hardly speak. Soling Jacob plays as though his fiddle is possessed, never stopping to think or rest, just pouring out a stream of the most achingly beautiful tunes I've heard. And William… William is so lovely that I don't dare say a word. I'm afraid to break the spell that makes him want to dance like this with me. The fourth polska ends and the fifth begins, and William and I barely pause in between them, simply dancing on. Soling Jacob never so much as glances at us.
the uncomfortable situation pushing against his fly. He just has to power through until he gets home.
There is no doubt that this girl has come from John, and she is a whole person. Tiny and complete. I cannot quite believe it. She is brand new, and just by existing she is now the sole focus of all my attention. Suddenly, carrying her through this building feels like the most important thing I have ever done in my life.
at this man, having the audacity to refuse to take care of himself properly when John can't live without him. “Get into the shower, now.”
Where Sherlock had thought Moriarty wanted something young and fresh to control, what he really wanted was something sharp and clever to conquer. Holmes knew this, and so he knew what to say.
“Does it still smell?” she asks, wiping her underarm over her forehead. “Damn, I was hoping it was just me. Hang on, I'll open the window again.”
. And now, it held the end of my world. My mouth pulled into a hateful smile, a substitute for the crying and screaming that raged inside me. My words were bitter, only just concealing the pain lodged in my throat.
In a corner behind the stage a suited man stood and smoked a cigar. He looked ageless and unyielding, the bearing of a man who has a right to be anywhere and everywhere. And although I had knocked him out the night before, Moran didn't have a scratch on his face.
“John, what do you think about this line?” Stamford asked, showing me the piece of text that had led to a row with the writer that same afternoon. The writing really was poor, and I could easily see what needed to be done to improve it. I wasn't thinking about what I was doing, but the others seemed stunned by the words that came out of my mouth.
I reacted too fast for thought, violently pushing her off me. As if everyone had been waiting for the tension in the room to snap, there were immediately several arms there. They captured Mary before she could fall to the floor, and hooked around my abdomen before I could come after her.
“Moriarty”, Holmes begun, finally tearing his eyes away and glancing up at the man. “I believe that there are other ways to-”
“Um.” John closes his eyes. “Being inside you, I guess. Or you inside me, but I’ve never done that before, so I don’t-”
Our eye contact was a physical presence in the room. Someone passed us by, and I realised I was still holding on to his elbow. I dropped my hand.
Somehow, in a way so simple I wouldn't be able to say how we did it, we took care of each other. He saw my pain and I saw his, neither of us backing away, holding each other through it. Two survivors from the same catastrophe.
It's so cold in the flat. Every time Mary comes into the room my stomach cramps. When she talks to me, I have no breath to answer. I haven't kissed her in… I don't even know how long.
“Oh!” Sherlock exclaims, taken aback by the unexpected deduction that John is about to kiss him. Actually kiss him, right now, in the inn of a godforsaken village outside of London, before they have even said good morning. How did he miss the signs? There must have been signs leading up to this. He must have spent so much time in his head trying to calculate this moment that he completely overlooked any evidence that John was planning to actually try it.
Simply lying there feels so good that Sherlock doesn't even want to push for more. He just flexes his foot, snuffling out a satisfied sound, and John's arm tightens around him.
Something flashed across the face of Holmes; a shadow of another kind of concern, one that had more to do with a breakable body tumbling towards a hardwood floor than with the opinion of faceless suits with money in their fists. But Holmes wouldn't name it, and Sherlock missed it.
Sherlock was alone in his dressing room. I was in a meeting with the composers that morning, and the ensemble was enjoying their coffee break.
I set my typewriter up at a small table in the coffee room. Stamford sat next to me, scribbling notes in the margins while I added pages to the script. I was in a foul mood, and it didn't help that I couldn't seem to write without imagining the dissatisfied frown on Sherlock's forehead. That frown was all I had been looking at all morning, and it made me second-guess every word choice.
Yes, I did run my other project by my beta and yes, she did still deliver this chapter in a week. I really can't praise her enough - she puts up with my second-language English, dedicates hours every week in the middle of her crazy life to follow my latest Johnlock whim, and hasn't had a single day's break from betaing my fics for two whole years. Trust me, we love her.
On the fourth day of rehearsals, Sherlock was doing his best to be as unpleasant to me as he was to everyone else. But unlike everyone else, I saw through it now.
Stamford's rooms were chaotic. In one end, there was still a set piece from the abandoned play by the previous writer, and flimsy props and instruments were lying around, thoroughly ignored by the partying people stumbling around them. The colourful Moulin Rouge dresses looked tacky in the light from a naked light bulb in the ceiling, and everyone was too deep into their bottles to notice the clutter and dirt. The floor was stained with beverages and the air was hazy with tobacco smoke.
I could have cried at the sight of him. It was ridiculous, how much I had missed looking into those eyes during the few hours I'd been without them. His face wasn't unrelenting and hard as I'd feared it would be; instead it was tentative, almost shy. His eyebrows twitched upwards, barely noticeably, and he jerked his head minutely to the side. I lowered my chin a bit, holding his gaze.
With that, I walked to the bottom stairs of the stage. It was all dead silent when I descended them. Before the front row, I stopped for a moment, for the evil duke and the penniless writer to share another look. I forced myself to look into the blackness of Moriarty's eyes, going down like a soldier.
“Sherlock!” I called after him, just when he was out the door. I swore under my breath and rose to follow him.
It's the first time I see him let his guard down enough to laugh in Sidensjö's dance barn. It feels incredible to be the cause of it.
At the end of the hallway, I saw him slip through a door. I called after him again, and the silence was a guilty one; that was decidedly
I slowly kissed the pale throat offered to me. The breath kept stopping in his chest before rushing out with barely-voiced sounds. The lighter my kisses, the more his hips squirmed. Hands fumbled with clothes; he slipped one of the braces from my shoulder, undid a few buttons of my shirt before he could bend down and suck at my trapezius muscle. I tugged his shirt out of his trousers, sneaking my hands in under it, and when I brushed over a nipple, a whimper escaped him louder than the ones before.
I started with cleaning. It felt strange; novel. When the floor was done and I had the vacuum cleaner in hand I realised that this was the first time in my life that I had voluntarily cleaned. And the most curious thing was that I did not mind it. I didn't even do it for fear of not being good enough; not really. I did it because I genuinely wanted to do something nice for John, help him so that his life would be easier.
The waiter comes in with their food then, putting it on the table for John and Tori, eyeing Sherlock hesitantly: “Should I fetch a menu for you as well, sir?”
“Far from it. But if we do this, then that’s it. That’s all in for me. Because it’s you, I can’t do casual. If we decide to try, we commit.”
Sherlock's stoic mask fell the moment no one was looking. He was tired to the bones, so tired that he felt it carve hollows into his cheeks and circles under his eyes. He felt the fever rising. He watched me walk away, taking with me the haven of my embrace, and his eyes slammed shut.
“Relax, he doesn't know what I have in store for you. You will be hearing it first; I wanted it to be special! No, he just trusts me to get certain things done. He's grateful, unlike some others.”
“In Paris, you will. You'll meet other artists who would be delighted to work with you, and then the inspiration will come.”
You allowed me to be uncertain. You allowed me to be cautious. You smiled at me, then waited. You came out to me, you touched me lightly, you flirted not-so-subtly, then waited. You let me see your affection, driven by something else than biology. You respected me, to the point where it drove me to wishing you would stop doing so and make me yours. And that's when you did.
He is well on the way to working himself into a panic when John pauses in front of him on his way to the bathroom.
Sherlock stretches his neck and gives John a quick kiss on the mouth. Then he goes back to his scrutiny of the sock lying limply in his hand.
Worst of all is that John must have noticed that Sherlock has woken up; his heartbeats are all but shaking the mattress beneath them. Meaning that if Sherlock doesn't move away very,
Sherlock lingers on the final note, holding the bow in the air for a moment, keeping the music in the air even after it has silenced. Then he lowers the instrument, and John clears his throat.
At the dress rehearsal, everyone was working themselves into a sweat to put it all together perfectly for one single person. Moriarty sat alone in the middle of the former dance floor. He was unmoving, watching the show with his usual mild disinterest; only when Sherlock was on stage did something spark in his eyes.
He growled and grabbed my wrists, keeping them against his chest when he lifted his head from the mattress to kiss me. The fact that I was straddling his nearly naked hips, and that both of us were already out of breath, quickly acquired a new meaning.
Once I'd started to move, I instinctively knew that I needed to be faster. It was like a clock jolting to life inside me, ticking loudly and telling me that every second was critical. I was back in the army, where I would just
He looked like a thundercloud, his scowl as dark as the blue of his shirt. “I am going to rewrite this scene”, he announced.
He's been looking anyway, though. Secret, quick glances that he fought not to remember, pretended weren't burned into his mind to surface whenever he didn't guard himself enough.
Stamford looked at my blushing face, his eyebrows only twitching a little bit in amusement, before he left and closed the door behind him.
We walk back over the ice-cold sand to the waterline. The grey surface is dotted with raindrops. “This is a stupid idea”, William says behind me as I step into the water.
After a few hours, it's time to leave for Harry's. Tori has warmed up, excited to meet his sister for the first time, while John is more cautious. As annoying as Sherlock's prediction about their Christmas was, he was likely right. And as nice as it is to have a woman by his side, who chose to spend Christmas with him and will get on her back for him later, he aches when he leaves Sherlock in 221B.
Sherlock had no idea how wonderful it would be to see John so sexually frustrated. John fights not to let his hands drift towards Sherlock to settle on his forearm, shoulder or back – and Sherlock feels as though he has John’s entire sexuality in his own hands. It’s irresistible. And so, the more John struggles, the more Sherlock teases.
he'd seen it somewhere). Before he leaves, he almost walks over to the sofa to hug Sherlock goodbye.
Sherlock releases a loud breath through his nose. He starts rolling his head on the pillow, trying to contain the building pleasure in his groin, and his lips part again, panting out short bursts of air.
I'm too deeply moved and too tired to think about the implications of it right now. I just know with complete clarity that this isn't only for the summer. This is something special beyond words. I will never find it anywhere else – and I don't
When I turned to Sherlock, he looked overwhelmed. I remember that. Looking up at him, feeling my own face about to burst in a giddy grin, and seeing him so moved by what we just did that he couldn't smile, couldn't speak. He just looked at me in awed disbelief.
At the sound of that fond voice of John's, Sherlock looks up. This is when he truly understands how close they are. John is standing before him, only slightly taller than Sherlock is when sitting on the swing, looking down into his face with clear eyes. His hands are on the ropes on either side of Sherlock's head, shielding him from the summer night.
“Obviously.” He rolled his eyes. “Nothing else will fit.” He shrugged into his long coat, hiding the shirt underneath, and crouched to put on his shoes. When he straightened, his eyes met mine. “What?” he asked, and I realised I was smiling stupidly.
“I'm making you a cuppa, yeah? We could both use something to wind down.” John waits another moment on the other side of the door, then moves into the kitchen and fills the kettle.
? Yet it flows so effortlessly through my head. With Sherlock, all the impossible is real. All the beauty and all the ruthless destruction. Even the destruction is beauty. Made into art in my nightmares; the black wings expanding and swooping down, darkening the pale day, imposing on my eyes, frightening me with its speed; the sky leaking drops that smear out in the air like a painting; the red blood glowing and slipping into every crease of the ground and of my hands.
My hands wandered over him, couldn't decide where to touch him. Everything I could touch is so unbearably sweet, and it's all
Even the first, unmoving, feather-light touch builds John's arousal impossibly fast, because he can't, and he shouldn't, and he needs to stop and he needs
The position in the army provided me with adventure and purpose, and I was immortal right up to the day when my shoulder was ripped apart by a bullet.
I undo the top buttons of my shirt. John carefully lifts her out of the blankets. She is unbelievably little; smaller than any other human I have encountered. The sight of her hands stops the breath in my throat; they look like John's, and they are perfect in every detail – only so, SO much smaller.
It was remarkable to get to see Sherlock Holmes when he didn't hide. His eyes were soft without make-up and his face was open to me. When I stood by the foot of the bed, leaning back against the table, wearing his silk dressing gown and reading him a poem from my notebook… then he gazed up at me with unveiled adoration, chin resting in his hands and legs bent at the knees, feet swaying softly in the air. He looked so young, and I
The cupboard was filled to the brim with panting, humid breath. His breaths were mine and mine were his, drawn heavily from each other's cheeks, chins and mouths.
It ends two hours into the twenty-ninth of January. John's phone wakes him, Tori cries through the speakers. John tells her he'll come to see her in the morning and he hangs up, falling back asleep before what happened slots into place in his reality.
; he looks as though he's burning on the inside. It's a frightening expression, and I want to look away but can't. So I stare back at him, and the seconds tick by until I lose count of them.
how beautiful the earth has become at summer solstice. How kind the sun, the winds and the earth all are to my senses.
At noon, they kiss in front of the window. The first of January looks grey and stagnant on Baker Street. The bright daylight reveals the chaos of stuff in 221B and the dust on the floor. John holds on to the lapels of Sherlock's dressing gown, and Sherlock looks tired and soft like the day outside.
Sherlock went back to the shelf. He was still without his jacket, and I made a feeble effort not to look at the way his body stretched under the thin silk when he reached to put the Bible back.
John Watson is delightfully vocal about what he likes. He repeatedly praises Sherlock’s ability to kiss, he admires Sherlock’s appearance and tells Sherlock so, and when Sherlock kisses his throat, he moans. It is a beautiful sound; soft, high-pitched and entirely unashamed.
“Please”, I slurred into his hair. His curls were damp with sweat. The Hindu crown was hard and unforgiving against my cheek. “You'll be all right. You'll be all right.”
“Are you letting your sweet curls loose for Moriarty?” Martha said, her voice calm though her hands were forceful, lacing his black corset with sharp, decisive tugs.
He can hardly believe that this is happening to him. Is he still Sherlock Holmes? Did John Watson just kiss him for… God, it must have been at least half an hour, surely? He checks his watch.
Afterwards, we lay side by side on top of the covers. Our hands were touching, but I didn't dare take his properly. There was a question on the tip of my tongue that I didn't know how to ask.
“Moriarty!” Sherlock exclaimed, taking a step back from me. “Good that you're back. Allow me to introduce you to the writer.”
Sherlock was incandescent when we came to the climax of the song. He didn't need fuel, he didn't need air. He stood tall with music, with love, and with joy.
John gently guides him to lie down, and Sherlock pliantly obeys. His breaths are even and deep when John takes off his shoes and socks. He hesitates for just a moment above Sherlock's fly, then tells himself he's ridiculous; he
Martha hung the thin lace of the negligee over Sherlock's bare shoulders. Sherlock eyed his hair critically in the mirror, fingers flying to correct little imperfections. Holmes watched them, on the verge of saying something more, but he changed his mind.
Another metal clang and I'm back on the dance floor with William. It's time for the hat-trick that everyone in the room's been waiting for. I've arranged for Klockar Ida to help us, and Stambro Mikael has given her his hat.
My entire skin comes alive when I rise from the water. This is what I love most about swimming in a cold lake; the prickling feeling all over when my body starts warming me from the inside. The pleasure of my hot blood trickling into the small capillaries just beneath my skin, meeting the firm cold on the outside. And the air doesn't feel chilly at all now. I stand tall underneath the vibrant sky, unbothered by my nakedness.
“I'll be right out!” John reaches for the shampoo. The bottle is almost empty and makes a noise when he squeezes the liquid into his palm.
He pockets his phone and watches the nape of Sherlock's neck, bent over the microscope. A pool of warmth in his stomach spills over to the corners of his lips, forming a tiny smile when he falls back asleep.
“Gregory, I need you to walk slower. Look at him, you want to have him, you want to conquer him – yes, that's it, okay Sherlock, go again.”
He rose from the bed and went to get his coat. When he turned back to the room, I was standing right behind him, so close that he was unable to hide.
John was right to stare. Their legs tangling together is the most erotic thing Sherlock has experienced in ten years – no, more, much more – in fact, nothing has ever felt this way. He immediately grows fully hard, as does John.
John has barely seen that lazy cat awake in all the time he's spent at Tori's flat. He finds it hard to imagine it messing anything up too badly, and assumes it's just Tori being pedantic. When he finally opens her door, he is proved wrong.
John moves to the edge of his bed, leaving room for Sherlock on the pale pink sheets. Sherlock lies down and is immediately aware of a tension that was not there yesterday. Lying in a bed together is no longer uncomplicated.
John wonders if this is somehow an extension of the experiment he’s been busy with – but that doesn’t seem very likely, as the experiment appeared to mostly involve bile, and John fails to see the connection between bile and socks. He watches Sherlock for a few moments before asking: “What are you doing now?”
When she was in the kitchen, I went to the fireplace as usual. She still has that picture of us from my birthday all those years ago, with my goofy smile and Sherlock's shining eyes. We were so in love. Always have been.
The second year, John's thoughts make an unpleasant reappearance. He accidentally analyses his feelings, he immediately damns them, then acknowledges they have no intention of going away. He chokes on them when Sherlock insists on keeping that bloody phone from that bloody woman, he loses himself in them so badly he thinks Sherlock must see how he stares.
He shifted, a hand letting go of the covers to grab my shoulder. “Hold me”, he said in the whimper he had fought to keep in.
, they say, and John feels stupid for thinking he would be. He still has this, and it matters more than he can comprehend. It matters more than being fooled and betrayed and losing a regular sexual outlet.
And then… I could never have guessed how that would feel. The moment the discomfort turned into this delicious, deep pressure. It never really stopped being
Now I can only see the upper half of her face. Her tiny nose peeks out of the blue fabric of the scarf. She has a shocking amount of hair; dark-blonde streaks of it are plastered against her forehead. Her eyes are open. She blinks, silent and alert. I try to shield her face without quite succeeding, quietly asking her if she is sure she shouldn't close her eyes for a bit. But she stubbornly keeps them wide open, looking at the strange world she has been abruptly brought into.
Sherlock turned away to hang up his coat. “Moriarty came to see him about it today”, he said distractedly. “He has, as of now, exclusive ownership of me.” He spun on his heel, spreading his hands ironically to the sides to show himself off.
All words but one. If only the reader could see the way my fingers shake over that name. If they could sense the way my eyes fill with tears when I look at its beautiful shape on the paper. If they had any idea how long it takes me to bring myself to type it.
Our eyes meet when we pull back from the embrace. The smile on his face grows. I smile back at him stupidly, stuck in the moment until someone throws an arm around my neck.
supporting me. He is preparing a new dressing room for me as we speak.” Sherlock smiled confidently. “All that money he invests in the show? He appreciates art just as much as I do. I'm certain he recognises that the work is the most important thing.”
I remember that it felt as though the walls could see us, taking in and keeping our secret for us. Looking out over my room now, I can almost see us still here, stumbling naked to the bed, beyond feeling self-conscious about the vulgarity of it all.
The sun was out earlier. These days it's warm enough to seduce people out of their jackets. God, how I've missed feeling that gentle glow on my cheeks; those first days in the spring when the sunlight is actually warming. There are still heavy patches of snow in the shades behind the houses, of course, but they are slowly being melted away by this newly-wakened sun.
Sherlock's breath was still in his throat as he listened to the sauntering steps disappearing. Moriarty's presence lingered in the room, as if he might come back at any time.
“The water is never as nice as when it's raining. And the sun hasn't set.” I gesture towards the sliver of gold above the mountain ridges.
The tradition is that at Midsummer's Eve, the girls go out and pick seven different sorts of flowers in complete silence. They put the bouquet under their pillow, and if they manage not to say a word from the moment they pick the first flower until they fall asleep, they will dream of their future husband.
“I haven't quite finished writing that new scene”, I went on. In the corner of my eye, I saw Moriarty slowly turn his face to me, but I didn't allow myself to check his expression. “You know, the…
“Come on”, I soothed him, sliding off and lying on my back, pulling him with me. He fumbled to line up his cock again, and I moaned when the pressure returned. “Come on, Sherlock.”
They lie down facing each other in the small space. Their legs slot together. John shuffles until he finds the way they fit best, where they touch at as many square inches as possible.
, because without John, Sherlock would have been caught by that damned suspect in the study tonight.
don't have to stand.” He froze, staring at me. “I mean, it- it's quite long. I don't want you to be uncomfortable.”
We didn't stay for long after that. The look they all gave us when we left told me we hadn't needed to keep up the pretence of heading for different beds. Sherlock looked befuddled at the way they wished him goodnight, using his name as though he was a friend.
This chapter doesn't really have an attached song - the atmosphere is very different from the original movie scene, which is a lot lighter. But if you are curious about the original, listen to
Sherlock, dumbfounded, finally tries to. But his hands are clumsy and he can't quite coordinate his swallows; it's a miracle he doesn't choke. His stomach decidedly does not want food, it's too preoccupied with a swarm of delighted butterflies. He inches lower in his seat, slotting his legs more thoroughly against Johns, just to see what John will do.
Sherlock blinks his eyes open when John’s hands move towards the safer area of his lower back. “Wh-? What?”
Next thing I'm aware of, the candle has burned down. I'm still lying on my side, but I have moved closer to the warm boy beside me; my face rests inches from the warm skin of his neck. He smells incredible. I keep my eyes closed and draw a deep breath, letting the sweetness of his scent keep me floating in that wonderful state of not-quite-awake.
John’s hand reaches further up, caressing his chest. Sherlock sighs in pleasure when John skims over a nipple. John does it again, and again. Sherlock’s shirt is getting tangled and is clearly in the way for this.
Sherlock still heard it in my breath. “Whatever it is, just say it.” His voice was drowsy and content.
I walk back to Drömme that night filled to the brim with a new certainty. It changes everything, I know that. But right now, I let myself just be in peace with the feel of the polska still stirring in my blood.
I smiled around the painful constriction in my chest that always came with hearing him recite my words. “
Their shirts are tangling awkwardly between them, maintaining the illusion of a barrier, both reassuring and endlessly annoying. Sherlock strokes the skin of John's lower belly, his hand bumping against the bulk of John's trapped shirt.
Sherlock narrows his eyes at him. John has a habit of clearing his throat when he’s nervous or unsure of something. That, and rubbing his hand over the back of his neck – ah, there it is. Conclusion: there is something John is not telling him. But when Sherlock tries to deduce what it is, John turns his face away in quite a deliberate way.
But I was just reading through my unpublished drafts. Haven't been able to bring myself to do it since he died, and it took some liquid courage. And… well, that's not all fake. No way.
“You really have no idea?” John laughs sadly. “I’ve been staring at you for months now. Tried to be discreet about it, but, well, it’s
As we get closer to the centre, we meet other families dragging Christmas trees behind them. The village green is brimming with people this Tuesday night. On Valborg almost everyone gathers, pulled in towards the promise of a bonfire and the need of a ritual to welcome the spring. Everyone is wearing their best coats and friendliest smiles.
me!” Sherlock exploded, arms flying out to his sides. “He has always tried to save me. First, he tried to show me how to work our way up in society, to '
The case looks promising at first. Locked room, obscure cause of death. Sherlock's eyes are gleaming and John is quietly pleased. They've gone a few days without a case, so Sherlock's had time to sleep and eat after the last one, but still haven't gone long enough to start climbing the walls. He is concentrated and communicative – until suddenly, he's not.
I frowned at him. There was something off about him, something in the way he moved that I didn't recognise at all. He looked up at me from the bed with docile eyes, his lips still obviously pursed.
Smiling, he snaps a picture of us. I am entirely unprepared for the wave of emotion this stirs in me. I am unbearably proud to be seen as someone who held this most precious weight in my hands; I am overjoyed that he sees the loveliness of us and wants to remember it; I am desperate for him to take more pictures and immortalise the fact that I am here; that at this moment in time, I matter to her.
As we speak, we watch the couples dance by. It's quite the funny little schottis tune Soling Jacob's playing, and I see Mikael try to spin and laugh so hard he cries at the same time. All this talking about dancing has my feet tingling and longing to move.
I didn't turn. But my feet had stopped walking without me telling them to. I held still not to miss a single sound.
I'm staring at the words but it doesn't help. It doesn't make it real. Seeing him, now that would make it real.
Next chapter might be a while longer - I have another small project I want to run by my beta in between. It shouldn't take more than one extra week though! (And if you know the original story, you might actually be relieved by the delay - I know my beta will be.)
“Mycroft, you made it”, Sherlock interrupted, swiftly striding across the room. “Good, I have already told Moriarty about the emergency script reading.” He didn't stop until he stood right in front of Holmes, his face not visible to anyone else.
John laughs even harder at that, because he's right; she'll take her posh curtain poles to her next flat, and then, what, she'll have to move again?
Once, a few months ago, there was a knock on my door. I took far too long to answer – I was not in a good state that morning – but when I did, I found a paper bag of baked goods. I really don't know who in Paris would leave me those if not her – Stamford would have barged into my flat regardless of my state, so it wasn't him.
But my heart would not so easily be silenced. You entered my life and you made a room for yourself in it, and I found myself more fascinated by you than by any other human I have met. I was embarrassed to see in pictures how my gaze on you gave me away, but I was unable to stop looking. When you finally started pursuing me, you know how terrified I was, but it was also everything I had ever hoped would happen. At that point, you had proved time and time again that nothing I had previously learned applied to John Watson, but how could I be sure? Was it enough to revoke a decision I had reached, based on solid evidence?
, and everyone – children, youngsters, parents and elderly – start singing. I have a sudden vision of William outside the Sidensjö village hall, tricked into joining the dancing circle around the midsummer pole, a horrified expression on his face as he tries to preserve his dignity while jumping like a frog. The thought makes me snigger to myself.
John is the idiot who smiles at this and obeys, going to change and skipping breakfast. They leave less than five minutes later. Sherlock is in his case mode, infuriating and brilliant, and John clings to his every word with the heady mixture of annoyance and fascination.
Stamford and Gregory fell silent, and Molly did a little jump in her chair, turning to me with a squeak. “Oh. It fits perfectly!”
Sitting on my narrow bed that day, I was certain that Sherlock could never love me. I was too plain, too ordinary, had too many ugly scars. I recalled him kissing the marred skin on my left shoulder, and I was humiliated to have bought the lie.
I raised my gaze through my lashes. “I feel like there's something else you want.” I reached for the lowest button of his dress.
“Oh, God.” I felt my face heat with mortification. “You never heard about me, did you? You thought I was… oh, God.”
When we sat together at the dinner table, we both stared at a changed man; I didn't like to dwell on what he saw, but
Sherlock sat with his chair turned towards the dirty window. Weak sunlight got through the glass, but nothing else did.
John smiles sleepily, melting into Sherlock's embrace. They take their time waking up, slowly kissing. When John makes to leave for the bathroom fifteen minutes later, Sherlock stops him with a last firm kiss and another “Happy New Year”.
After our fifth dance, we start on our sixth, and seventh and eighth, until I lose count. There's no need for pretence at this point; everyone in the room knows what this is. And we're not the only couple here tonight who have danced together for longer than is innocent. Lestare Greger and Klockar Ida haven't taken a break for a while, as far as I can tell. Good for them.
John doesn't get the last word, after all. Sherlock spends the rest of the night yelling deductions at the telly, working himself up more and more over the idiocy of the programme, the participants, the camera crew, the adverts. John lets himself sink deeper into the sofa cushions and the sense of comfort.
John can't help his laughter then, echoing across the tiles. He calmly washes his hair while the lock rattles. “Seven seconds, John!” he hears Sherlock shout just before the door bangs open.
were the sun in the room, he said my name at every opportunity, and his back was so straight, his chin so high. As soon as we were alone in a room, he was melting into my arms, lips already hanging open for me to claim, needy sounds lurking in the back of his throat.
