Mixed blood and saliva was important during mating, it wasn't the same, but near thing. Loophole. Bloody alpha!
Sherlock went home. His thoughts swirled. Sentiment. A simple thing can destroy big minds. Maybe one day he would loose a game, because of someone. That certain someone waited him in the sitting room with a luggage at his feet. Sherlock frowned.
'He is missing me. I feel it. I want to be with him now! Go or I'll force you!'
Few weeks later he visited Sherlock's grave with Mrs. Hudson. Her eyes watered while John only stared numbly.
"Of course, he is okay. Why wouldn't he?"
"There is no fair play in love."
"You stopped her husband being executed?"
The blood run out from Sherlock's face. No! Not John!
"We've only just met and we are going to go and look a flat?" Ridiculous.
"What?" John sat up. "It's impossible. No human could be alive without it's alpha or omega."
"That's not what people normally say."
Sherlock examined the shoes.
"Thank you."
"Sweet." John said coldly. "Pity, it's in vain."
"Did I just text a murderer?" Frowned John. "What good will that do?" Suddenly his phone started to ringing.
"I am so angry!" Mrs. Hudson said suddenly.
"I apologize. Everything they told it's true. I created Moriarty."
Sherlock was named as a witness for the prosecution.
"He is also my friend. He needs me. We will chat. You can also come."
"I'm sorry, what?"
Disguised as an attacked priest, Sherlock walked in Mrs Adler's sitting room, to find her naked as a fresh born lamb. In a minute, he dropped out of his role.
"I deleted it long time ago, so I study again."
"That's ridiculous. Let me up!" John protested.
"You call that a risk? This is a risk." He pulled out two little bottles, each containing a pill. "There's a good bottle and a bad bottle. You take the good bottle, you live. You take the pill from the bad bottle, you die."
"Take it! The detective handed the pen drive Moriarty.
"You could have written a letter, as last time."
Victor wanted to Sherlock fight over with other alphas for him. Sherlock said, it's an unnecessary display of power. He rather used his brain. He craved for puzzles, mystery cases. Victor didn't understand him. None of the omegas could. He stopped try to understand with them. When desire started to outgrow him, he tried to rid it with cocaine. It worked... For a while.
"I'll call Mycroft."
"I will explain everything in print." Kitty said as she shoved a dossier to John with full of articles. "Sherlock is a fake, he invented all the crimes. He invented James Moriarty, his enemy."
"Aren't you boring Sherlock?" He asked, while carded his fingers through the detective's hair.
"Nothing" Angelo answered. "But for this man, I'd have gone to prison. I'll get a candle of the table. It's more romantic." He winked at John as he leaved.
He stepped close to John and bent his head down. He gently nuzzled his temple, rubbed his cheek to John's. His mind chanted JohnJohnJohnJohnJohn. He should do the hardest step first: leave John.
"Mrs Hudson, the landlady given me a special deal. Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out."
"We heard when she told you she did."
The detective tried reach the water surface with his blogger after the explosion. He dragged John out. The doctor coughed water up. His head hurt. Someone leaned above him.
"He has someone."
"Prove me, I am right. Because if not, my brother will be dead at the morning."
"Good night, Sherlock."
"And you want me!"
Everything happened so fast, but when a warm tongue licked a wet path under his chin, John felt it was time to take control a little. He took Sherlock's face between his hands.
"Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?" Well, that's get better and better. "You're not the only one to enjoy a good murder. There's others out there just like you, except you're just a man. And they're so much more than that."
"Says who?"
"John is fine." MH
"You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you." Sherlock stepped on his gunshot wound. " The name" Now!" He roared.
"Sherlock!" Breathed John.
"Where are you going?" Puzzled Lestrade.
"What are you talking about?"
They started on their way, when a black car stopped them. An elegantly dressed man with umbrella got out from the car.
"Catch you later!"
"Bit of trouble too, I bet."
"I know you."
The air stuck in John. Dread crawled in his skin.
"Stop that! I loved your brother. I really loved him, but I can't mourn for him forever."
"It's ridiculous! He was the one who brought back Mary anyway."
"Do you know the big problem with disguise Mr. Holmes? However hard to try it's always a self-portrait."
"What?"
"Your inspector friend and his company found nothing. He escaped." Mycroft gave Sherlock a picture. "Do you heard about her?"
"Bloody Mycroft" grumbled John.
"...to be your partner, your friend, your mate even, if you wouldn't be an absolute idiot! He is a great man, a good man. Faithfull with a strong moral compass. He saved your life, never let you down, and you... How can you be so blind?"
"Are we dating?"
"Not anymore! He tried to shut me down! I wont let it happen again!" Saw his mate's terrified expression, he changed tactic. "You don't have to be worry, I will take care of you. I love you."
"No, Sherlock!" John started to panic. Sherlock lifted his head up, he watched his omega face intently.
"It stops being pretend if we find anything."
"Would you like a cup of tea?" Sherlock looked at him with an odd expression. "It's Grey's Anatomy, I thought... Doesn't matter. It's only a book." The doctor stared at the floor until Sherlock reached under his chin.
"You will see I'm right."
"I know you are an army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know that your limp is psychosomatic... and I know, that you are an omega for sure." John froze. The hell? How did he? "That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?"
"Oh, thank you."
John shocked again for a moment. He didn't had to thinking on how his jumper got there. He just tried to imagine Sherlock as he sleeping in some dirty place, squeezing his jumper.
"Can I see you tomorrow?" Sherlock asked John hopefully.
John found himself tangled with Sherlock when he woke up. Sherlock was on his back, John upper body lay on him, his arms were around the detective, his nose in the detective's neck . Yesterday night he didn't payed attention, but now he felt how thin was Sherlock, thinner then before. The doctor stroked the ribs. Sherlock twitched a little, still asleep. John looked carefully under his shirt, and saw bruises, they  did not come from him. Moriarty's men must have caught and tortured him. He wasn't only beaten, he had cuts and burn injuries. His body was still sensitive, is spite of that he let John to beat him and thanks to the doctor, the face of the genius was also swollen. Sherlock's eyes suddenly were open. John moved away from him and got away from the bed.
Mycroft only didn't dared to tell his little brother that John is dating with someone.
"What do I say?"
"Good to see you, Dr. Watson! What can I thanks for your unexpected visit?"
"Broke into all of those places and never took anything..."
"And I did. John will never see her again, I guarantee."
"No. I'm done with you" answered Irene as stopped in front of the older Holmes. "You know I have so much more on my phone outside of compromise pictures, so much more. I have few demands, to not use them against your superiors."
"Isn't it too soon? Just survived an explosion yesterday."
"Mrs Hudson took my skull."
"It's the only right thing!" He grabbed John's wrist and pressed them next to his head.
"I know. I appreciate it." John kissed his head.
"John chose her. If he is happy with her, if he is in love..." Sherlock's voice trembled.
"That's it!" His alpha praised him. "So good, John!"
Sorry for the cliff-hanger again. I'm progressing slowly.
"You don't have a right to take it!"
"Yeah, I'm fine. Calm down, Sherlock!" But he just pacing furiously near the pool.
"How is John?" SH
Sherlock's visit on the Yard was successful. Their chin was dropped. Even Lestrade gave him a hug. Everything went too easy, until now.
"I'm not done with you! Come, sit on my lap!"
"You are so deep inside in me!" John moaned. As his doctor moved more and more wildly, the alpha became more exited. He felt his knot started to form. He grabbed John's neck as he trusted upwards. He wanted to knot and breed.
They didn’t talk much on the way to the restaurant. Sherlock's courage began to wane. He expected that John would be irritated, but he hoped he can warm his heart a little with endearment. Flowers, dinner with candlelight... Ordinary things for ordinary omegas. John wasn't ordinary, he knew, however Sherlock loved the idea of a proper date. It was too unusual for him. He wanted to know what it feels like with John.
"Nest, John."
"Sherlock, would you please explain me, because I don't understand!" John  turned to him, but Sherlock was too angry to do something else as snarling viciously to Moriarty.
"Problem?"
"I have men for brake your phone's code."
"Sebastian Moran. He is your last target. When you are done with him, you can return back to London." MH
John woke up alone in the bed. It was strange. He always got up before Sherlock to found him possessively wrapped around his body. Instead he was found in the sitting room, sat on his chair wearing his robe.
"Don't you worry! I take care about her."
He stood at the door, frozen.
"I've outlived four people. That's the most fun you can have with an aneurism."
Sherlock felt a sudden pressure in his head.
"Are you all right?" Sherlock looked at John.
"Course, because Sherlock Holmes payed for him and also bought the juries."
When he opened his eyes, he saw John leaned over him.
"Don't worry about John! I keep an eye on him. I promised. Concentrate on the case. As soon as you liquidate Moriarty's organization successfully you can return home." MH
"How?" John was surprised.
Sherlock lifted John up and went to Mycroft's car.
"My alpha is speaks and speaks in my head, but it doesn't really help."
No, no, no!!! It was only yesterday when he put John in danger. His alpha was still in alarm. He felt his vision turns red, and the fangs in his mouth ready to kill.
"The demolition too smart. Give me my phone."
"John, look at me! I want you to know, you were perfect to me. I want you to be safe. Be happy. Good bye John!"
"If you were dying... If you'd been murdered, in your very last few seconds what would you say?"
"Almost, love. Almost. I'm near..." He growled.
"It's been two years! You could have given a signal that you were alive!"
"My alpha said, you wanted me back."
"Seen a lot of injuries, then. Violent deaths."
"Don't! Look, I don't say no to the sex. But no mating!" Sherlock growled. "Please! Alpha..."John licked his alpha's chin, he hoped with a little submissive act he can convince him. The tightness on his wrists eased.
"Than I will tell you a story about the bees and flowers."
"Hello, John."
Sherlock looked him thoroughly and sniffed. Still nothing. How odd.
"You won't join to MI6! Never!"
"The MI6 would place Sherlock in East-Europe, such a secret mission which in Sherlock would die within half a year. Do you really suppose from me I wish my own brother's death?"
"I've sent you a little puzzle just to say hi." Her voice hiccupped.
"Shh. You're perfect." He lay on the bed with John on his chest. He sight satisfied. He nuzzled John's forehead. "Lovely. You are lovely. I love you so much."
"I doubt it."
"When I met you for the first time, I said Afghanistan or Iraq. You looked surprised."
"No! No, that's impossible!"
"Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?" John gaped his mouth in outrage. "Not good?"
No answer. The flat shrouded in silence. The air was heavy and an unmistakable smell hit his nose.
They met in a park. Mike doesn't changed. He was the same puffy, kindly smiling guy.
"I looked you up on the internet last night." John told Sherlock.
"Seriously, could you just put on something?"
"So this is the big story? Moriarty is an actor." John shook his head.
"And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people."
"I heard you are demilitarized. Wanna meet for a coffee?"-Mike Stamford
John stopped beating him. His expression reflected shock. He wanted Sherlock to be alive of course, but he can't just forgive so simple what Sherlock done to him.
"Gas leak."
"Get over to the car next to the cab."-MH
John done what Sherlock told him, there was a languorous beauty on his face what filled the alpha with adoration. He cuddled him, his doctor pulled his face into Sherlock's neck.
"It's the truth!" She lowered her eyes. "I was an assassin, and someone showed up from my past..."
Something was definitely strange with Sherlock. It's his alpha!
"So it's state is unchanged." MH
John saw in Sherlock's eyes the insecurity.
Sherlock ached for touch him, but he didn't dare. When he took a step towards John uncertainty, John backed away at that moment. He kept the distance between them. It hurt Sherlock.
"It never will be. You close yourself from the whole world. You are depressed again. I know an excellent therapist..."
"I love your lips." John hummed.
"I know you don't trust her, but it's an emergency."
"No, no, no!!! It's too simple. There is no binary code you stupid! I'm so disappointed!"
"I suppose this Adler has compromising pictures. From who?"
"John!" Sherlock's deep voice came from behind him.
"I don't know the code."
"Are you planning to travel somewhere John?"
"That was amazing" praised John.
"I don't lie." MH
"Consulting criminal. Brilliant."
Sherlock seemed pleased. Feeding each other meant courting behaviour.
"A little bird told me. You looks good." John doubt that. Mike poked with his head towards John's cane. "I see you are limping. Foot shot?"
"You were the little bird, weren't you?" John realised suddenly. " You told Mike Stamford to introduce me to Sherlock."
"I own you for took care of my brother, and I promised him..."
"But lying on me is not."
"It's truly huge."
"I would like you to wait with the bite a bit."
John opened his mouth. Sherlock's tongue licked inside his mouth softly. John started to move his hip. He rubbed his cock to the skin of the alpha's stomach.
"Government's intelligence communities, terror cells, they all want me."
"Damn my leg!" He shouted. "Sorry, I'm so sorry. It's just sometimes this bloody thing..."
"Don't bother."
He took the smaller man into his nest, their bed.
"Just like you?" A vein throbbed on the doctor's temple. "I've had enough of the lies!" He yelled.
"So what we were doing there?"
As soon as John finished, he turned on all fours. Classic mating position. The alpha understood the hint. Seeing his omega's beautiful hole, he had to taste it. John almost fell for his nose when he felt Sherlock's tongue on his rim. A second later the alpha grunted in disgust. John giggled.
"You can talk, Johnny boy. Go ahead." Sherlock's alpha growled warningly. The doctor only nodded.
"I am never wrong."
"Oi!"
"He doesn't work well with me" he annoyed.
"She was an assassin John, she had to leave." Sherlock said while he fiddled with the napkin.
Come and play.
"Enough!"
Instead of explaining, John dropped himself on one of the armchair in front of the fireplace.
The recognition hit him like a rock. And still he stood in the room naked.
"Finally!" Sherlock thought.
"Why would I need you?" John trembled with rage.
John felt a finger penetrated him. He counted something else, something much bigger. He didn't expect the alpha be so thoughtful and patient. Sherlock caressed the skin of John's back and the doctor smelled soothing hormones in the air.
"No, look at her hair. She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking..." Something got in Sherlock's mind. "Oh... Serial killers, always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake."
"Will you come?"
"Because he loves you, and he thinks you love her."
One rainy day Irene Adler returned back. A black car stopped next to doctor Watson at the street.
"Cleared off before we got here. We've got nothing to go on."
The room was cold and dark. Only a bed and a desk were in it. Doesn't matter. He didn't planned settle down for a long term. He watched the gun on the desk. How pathetic. He survived the war, and what for? His parents are dead. His sister is an alcoholic, and don't want to see him. They never understood why he wanted to go to the army. An omega... To be an army doctor. He wanted to be brave, strong, proud and independent. And what is he now? A depressed, broken soldier. He glanced his cane in the corner of the bed. He limped, since the shot. He is not a soldier, nor an omega anymore. He was taking experimental suppressants, to disguise his gender. The drugs prevented his heats, and then he realised, he slowly damaged his own body. He doesn't even have  a smell at all. He is getting older, with no chance to get an alpha, pups, family... His parents would be so disappointed. Why would be worth staying alive anymore? He is so lonely. He reached for the gun, when his phone chirped.
"It was the couch, Sherlock." Maybe Mycroft was really better in observing.
"Not interested."
"How dare you blaming me!"
Sherlock would be a liar, if he had said he expected the kiss, but he returned it enthusiastically. He opened his mouth for John's demanding tongue. It was too exciting, he felt dizzy. Before he could lost his mind in delight, he felt a sudden sharp pain on his lips.
"So this is what bothers you. In my opinion you don't have to worry." Sherlock looked at him questioningly. " Don't you think your alpha doesn't presenting because it don't feel necessary to control you? Because now you want the same."
"Sherlock..." John wear nothing expect his underwear.
"I don't understand." He felt like scalded.
"You flirted with Sherlock Holmes."
Before he could realise what he was doing, Sherlock sharp fangs were in Moriarty's throat. The criminal's crimson blood spurted everywhere. When Sherlock could hold back his alpha, Moriarty lied dead, his eyes bulged. Sherlock breathed hard. What should he do now? He stood at the edge of the roof. He looked down. He saw John gets out from a cab. He reached for his phone. He has to speak with John for a last time.
"That's my room."
"You can't stop if, unless my man see you fall."
"It would be useless, John. I consulted with a gender specialist. His opinion is only the chosen omega can move out from this state."
John was curious.
"The mess and the noise he made! Body parts in the fridge!" She started to be hysterical. "I go now. Leave you alone with him." She went.
John was left alone with Sherlock. He was clueless, but he tried his best. He have to keep Sherlock warm, and hydrated. He prepared extra blankets, and massaged the detective's muscled to helps the blood circulation. He fed Sherlock from his own mouth, he swallowed it uneasily. Nothing seemed help. What would an omega do? A real omega. In normal circumstance, the alpha react sensitive the omega's smell, the hormones. The other important thing is the bite, during the mating process. The bite on its own meaningless, the blood and the saliva what is important. John bitten his own lips and took Sherlock's head close to his.
"It doesn't do any good for you."
On the paper Sherlock's name was written with beautiful letters. Female writing, obvious. And what is inside?
"It sounds very scientific, doctor." Sherlock smirked.
You'll be safe and happy, I'm certain. I wish for you the best.
John saw the confusion and hurt in the alpha's face.
But then, he felt something strange.
"I needed to disappear."
"Well, yes."
"What do you normally say? You've texted him a lot." He knew this, as well as that he sounds jealous, but he can't control himself. Irene only smiled, she was satisfied with herself.
"Mate with me!"
"I prefer to text."
"She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it. She never leaves her phone at home."
"Thanks." Mike suddenly stopped walking, like he had a very good idea. "Would you like to visit St. Bart's?"
Sherlock excitedly approached John.
"Want to see more?"
Oh, faithful John! How much I love you! He had to smile.
"I don't want a therapist!" John blew up at Mycroft.
"I hope so."
"Well, from your reputation, I conclude, you can solve it."
"Finally we are here. Only you and me, Sherlock. And the final big problem. Staying alive. Sooo boring, don't you think? All my life I hunted for great games, and you were fun. But now you are not entertaining me anymore, cause I defeated you. And you know what? It was child's play. Now I can go back to the ordinary people, and you are one of them as I found."
"Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face. Because I'd surprised and a little disappointed. Of course you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long. Ciao, Sherlock Holmes!"
The doctor moaned loudly as he ejaculated into Sherlock's mouth. The alpha swallowed his semen smugly.
"There is something wrong with my alpha." SH
"Who warned you about me?"
"The police don't consult with amateurs." That hurts. How could John think he is an amateur?
"Of course I know. You're the one who chooses. Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one. I wont cheat, it's your choice. I'll take whatever pill you don't."
"Oh, power game. This is entertaining. I'm in."
"It doesn't happen for no reason." John insisted. "It can help you get in touch with your lost alpha part and bringing me into a full heat."
"No you didn't. That's how you get you kicks, isn't it? You risk your life to prove you're clever."
Sherlock raised his head. John seemed to be sure of their relationship. It was good. It was very good. Sherlock was satisfied. He laid John back between the pillows.
Sherlock frowned, but let himself led to the bedroom. John wrapped him with the duvet.
"Good for you. Congratulations." He tried to smile.
John squatted down to the body.
'Another alpha will steal him from us!'
"I think we should get rid of our sticky trousers."
"Course I wasn't. Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up."
"I can prove Richard Brook is fake."
"You will need red meat, maybe with some fibrous, and lots of fluid of course."
"Than call Irene. She owns you, I'm sure..."
"I don't know it's a good idea."
"You should eat as well. You barely ate all day."
Since when he became so possessive?
"What happened to the lipstick?"
"His name is Richard Brook. Moriarty is not real. He never exists." Kitty explained to John as she talked to a confused little kid. "Just look at him! Richard Brook is an actor hired by Sherlock Holmes to play Moriarty."
"Yes, or?"
"What the hell I am doing here?" John asked himself. He stood before 221B Baker Street. The area seemed nice and the flat itself looked good from outside, but he originally didn't planned move out his previous place. "And now here I am."
Life with Sherlock wasn't easy. It's not enough he was messy, he kept a jar of eyeballs in the microwave and a head in the fridge. He manipulated Molly to get body parts from St. Bart's. John also arranged the shopping, he felt himself a housewife. John sometimes fall asleep at work, because Sherlock sent him different places getting information at night to his cases. Sherlock was unbearable, when he got bored, shot into the wall, terrorized Mrs. Hudson, and insulted John. He usually sabotaged the doctor on a date. Watson was even kidnapped by Black Lotus when they confused him with Sherlock Holmes. Despite all this, John stayed. He felt himself important, his life was interesting. He started writing a blog about their cases, however Sherlock offended, when John mentioned, the detective against his brilliant intelligence, he is ignorant in a few things. During their fights, John left to Sarah Sawyer, his so called girlfriend. Sarah was a beta, also a doctor. How dull. John must felt safe with her because of her gender, it wasn't a good excuse he went to dinner with Sarah instead of him.
"I've been thinking about you the whole time. That kept me alive. The thought I can come back to you, that I can be with you."
"I have to tell you something about John."
"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson." Mike introduced his buddy.
"I saw men die before, good men, friends of mine. Thought I would never sleep again. I would sleep fine tonight." Sherlock watched John intense. "You were going to take the damn pill, weren't you?"
"Nor sleep. It's not healthy." Sherlock looked at John carefully.
"Why do you tell me this?"
"I'm angry too." It was the firs sentence he told since Sherlock's death.
"He never replies."
"I called her back to figure out what do you really feel. If you wanted to be with Mary, you wouldn't be here." Sherlock smirked.
Bart's rooftop.
"Four. There's been a fourth and there's something different this time."
"Aren't you a little bit selfish?"
He was angry, yes. Why he had to kill himself? What was all the stupid thing he said?
John blinked at him in confusion, then burst out with laughter.
"I'll go with Greg to the pub."
"Mother. Our mother. This is my brother, Mycroft." John was speechless. There are two of them. It's tragic. "Putting of weight again?"
"Hush!" Sherlock breathed harshly into John's neck. "I decide when you are ready."
"You can choose your men better."
"Deep breaths. It was the right choice." He tried to believe in it while he felt awful. John knew it will be hard to be far from Sherlock for a while, but for long term it would be easier. His mobile chirped. He wondered it would be Sherlock.
"Her phone. Where is her mobile phone? We know, she had one. You just texted it."
"What are you doing here?"
"I'm in shock, look I've got a blanket!" Sherlock resisted. "And I just caught you a serial killer. More or less."
"What do you think?" MH
"Just someone out there who's noticed."
"I know what you think. But Irene Adler is only a shiny little thing, what get Sherlock's interest for few moments. It was frivolous, trust me. Flirting with The Women was easier, because it wasn't real emotions behind it. Sherlock Holmes was nothing, only a big intellect without a heart. And you are that heart, Dr Watson, what he's missing. He can't live without you."
"You know what? I give up. Just don't want to pay the rent alone."
John gathered his clothes he planned to wear today, he wanted to get ready to work. He wanted to take a shower and have breakfast. Alone... Sherlock understood the hint. It's time to him to go away.
"Do you think I'm a cheater? This is why you are sad? You think I tricked you too? Moriarty manipulates all of you! Don't you see what's going on?" In the end of his speech he shouted and hit the table.
The alpha didn't know why his partner's slick tasted like chemicals. It was wrong. Slowly he began to understand what his omega was waiting for.
"Saved you. I'm a good mate." His face was bloodied. His claws too.
He wanted to bite his neck, John felt in his core, so he quickly grabbed Sherlock's chin. He didn't intent to provoke a fight. However he was a soldier, alphas was stronger in its state. He simply cupped his alpha's face and kissed him.
"Why aren't we back at the restaurant?"
"I need you to send a text from your phone, my number is recognisable, it's on the website. on my desk there's a number. Enter it in your phone." With a sight, John started to typing. "These words exactly: What happened is Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland Street, please come. Type and send it quickly." He stood and put up a pink suitcase on a chair.
She gave him the coffee, when Sherlock asked.
"So he didn't know either." It was a statement so Sherlock didn't answered. "Right, he wasn't an important person in your life either."
I know I updated a long time ago. I was busy and I suffered with stone in my kidney. Anyway thank you who still reading it!
"Sent something from John! I have to know it is fine." SH
"Surprise me."
"I don't have to." Sherlock blinked embarrassed, but tried again. "Yeah, but if you were very clever, Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers, she was clever. She's trying to tell us something."
"I'm so sorry!" He babbled perplexedly. "He hired me." Pointed to Sherlock." I needed money, I'm an actor..."
'Don't you dare say his name!' His alpha growled. John's name on Moriarty's lips seemed a threat. The alpha couldn't tolerate that, but Sherlock controlled that part of him.
"Don't be obvious. I will kill you someday. I don't go rush it though, I'm saving it up for something special. If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you. I'll burn your heart out of you."
"Stop it Mycroft!"
"Sherlock?" John checked Sherlock's fangs, dried blood was still on his lips. The detective was in his alpha state, but he spoke more clearly and John didn't take it as a good sign, still he was relieved. Sherlock is alive. "You have to drink and eat." He tried to sit up, but Sherlock held him down. "Sherlock, I wont leave." He caressed Sherlock's dark hair. " I thought you wanted to be with Irene..."
"What have you done?"
Yes, he would. John's heart clenched. Sherlock was sad because he thought Irene is dead. John wandered if he knew she is alive, that kiss would have happened between them at all. They didn't talk about it. It never happened again. John tried to approached, but Sherlock drawled back. He must thought it was a mistake.
Sherlock can't breath. He stood in the middle of the room numb and frozen while John left. His chest started to hurt. It hurts so much, like he was shoot in the heart. He collapsed.
"You have just killed a man."
"You gather yourself now and go home to John."
"It had temper tantrums all the time. It constantly protested against leaving John. Couldn't bear the idea never see him again." SH
"So you set up a pretend drug bust to bully me?"
Since he was dated with Mary he could almost forgot Sherlock. Sometimes it felt like cheating. But Sherlock was dead, and it was time to move on.
Sherlock gave no signal from himself for more than two weeks. John missed him, however he was the one who asked more time and space to be alone for thinking. He didn't go much with it. He was still angry, at the same time he felt warmness and regret for him. Deep inside John knew Sherlock suffered the same way as him. There was nothing left but the terrible, aching loss.
"Your smell... very interesting. I also smell Sherlock's on you, but it can't covers yours. Your recovery is a miracle. Maybe you two destined be together."
"Well, you're not my doctor."
"How sweet! I can see why you like having them around, people do get so sentimental about their pets. So touchingly loyal, but oops... Rather shown your hand there Dr Watson." A red dot shown on Sherlock's head. "Got ya! Do you know what happens if you don't leave me alone? "
"I have cameras in the flat, you know. I see everything, I have take an eye of my brother. You left, he collapsed."
The detective found himself on his back in a minute, when John kick out his legs under him.
Soon John opened the door.
"For God's sake!" John started to pull his jacket while Sherlock's alpha enjoyed the doctor closeness.
"I investigated." Sniffled Sherlock. "Before we met. It was a trick."
"I knew you had something to do with her disappearance!"
"What if I don't choose either? I could just walk out of here." The cabbie pulled out a gun under the table.
"Sherlock?" John reached out his hand toward him, but the detective pulled back, before he could touch him.
He stood in front of Baker Street again, and knocked on the door. It was weird. He never thought he would wait for permission to entry his apartment.
John sighed again, but now it was a satisfied one. He enjoyed the attention.
"You came to the closest, now you are in my way."
"But they are just for my hip. They are herbal soothers."
Sherlock pressed the jumper tight to his chest, curled on his dirty mattress and cried.
"You've got questions...
"I will stop you."
"Can't be!"
After dinner Sherlock escorted John home. They stopped in front of the flat.
"Oh, let me guess. I get killed."
"For the trial you showed what you can do."
"I have to go to work."
"You are a good alpha, Sherlock. Could you please get off me?"
"What do you expect from me?"
"Is your flat? All of it?"
"You did it together." John stroked the detective's raven black hair with adoration. "However I had no heat since I joined the army, if our bonding would not be possible, my recovery would not have been possible."
"It's not a proper bond, but it's useful."
"I didn't order a taxi. Go away."
"Well, what?"
"For God's sake!" told John. "The woman knows the code. Ask her!"
"I don't remember invited you here." Answered John angrily.
"Congratulations, Ms. Adler. I wish have men half as good as you."
For a moment Sherlock didn't even had a clue what offer he mentioned. He was too busy with the feeling that John's hand caused.
"Thanks the coat by the way. It helped."
"Oh, it's always hard to remember an alias when you've had a fright, isn't it, Mr. Holmes?"
Sherlock blinked at John with awe. Mating with John was everything what Sherlock longed for, but he wasn't sure he would be able to.
Sherlock looked out the window.
He slowly took his way to the stairs, up to his room. He felt frozen. He just sat on his bed, he felt more lonely than ever.
Sherlock got closer to him.
"What does that mean?"
Well, hello again!
"Don't you want me, John? Don't you love me?"
"Wait, who's Mummy?" John was curios.
"You can't tell me what to do!" Sherlock rubbed his chin to John's head. John pinched the bridge of his nose. "You can stop it."
Sherlock inhaled deep breaths, his alpha upset him. He wanted to shout, shooting to the wall, wrecking something, but John would be angry.
Sherlock's state was unchanged. John got several text messages from Mycroft, but instead of reading them, he throw the phone to the wall.
"What's so funny?"
Sherlock shook his head.
Suddenly from the nothing a gunshot roared. Sherlock dropped the pill, and the cabbie fell to the ground. The detective looked out from the window, where from the shot came, but saw nothing. He went for the murderer.
Sherlock's head wandered to south. He slowly approached John's groin.
"Maybe she left it at home." Sherlock was annoyed John always tried to find easy explanations to his questions.
"I'm not crying, I'm typing and this stupid bitch is reading it out. You have 12 hours to solve the puzzle Sherlock or I will be naughty."
John sighed.
Soon John was also able to smell. He was aware the person by it's odour. Mrs. Hudson smelled like lavender, Molly like cherry blossom. Greg's scent was similar to gunpowder, very different from Mycroft's ink and chocolate cake aura. But none of them was as pleasant for John as Sherlock's fresh, wood after rain smell. John liked this scent on himself, and Sherlock usually scented him, but it was more his alpha's act, like the detective's. He returned to his cases. So John found himself on a crime scene. Triple homicide. Sherlock seemed exited, he clearly missed the work. Lestrade stood by John.
"She don't want money or anything."
John went out to the kitchen, Sherlock followed close behind him, like he was afraid John will be disappear again.
"There wasn't a case."
"Clearly. Well, this has been very interesting. I look forward to the court case." Sherlock got up, ready to go.
"Why did you refused it? Aren't you bored?" Sherlock just shrugged. "Oh! Sibling rivalry. Great."
"We are dating."
He didn't remember how to got home or how to spent days, weeks, weekends...
"I think I own you with an explanation."
"The name is Sherlock Holmes and the adress is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon." He left, and John only could stare at Mike, who just smiled.
"Says Mr I slept on you naked all night. And you didn't even bothering with underwear." Even Sherlock's neck and ears were crimson colour.
"I don't want to bore you with the details of my average life."
"Yes, you did."
"It couldn't be!"
"I need an assistant."
"Yes, where is it?"
Sherlock could concentrate on his job again. The doctor closeness and touches totally diverted his instincts to another way which he didn't want to deal with. But now his brain wheels moved in motion. The owner liked his shoes so much, he kept them clean. He suffered from eczema. There are mud on the sole from Sussex, on it sole from London, he knew this from the pollen analyses. So the owner came from Sussex to London, and left them here, but why? What happened with him? Oh... Oh!!! Carl Powers. His first case! A kid came for a swimming competition, he got some attack and drowned. His shoes were missing. These are his shoes! He analysed the shoes further and found clostridium botulinum on the shoelace. It could be in Carl Power's eczema ointment, caused  muscle paralysis while he was in the pool. He solved it! John will be satisfied.
"Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?"
"Well, you were wrong."
"The genius detective is only a cheater. I read in the newspaper, then it's true. I love the journalism."
If it was the last night, I would tell John... but I can't, and maybe I never will, because it's complicated and terrifying, and this... this is more simple. He couldn't answer, because a tall and muscular man came for him to take him to his brother.
"But it's not right!" His omega protested.
For what? Sherlock blinked.
"I made a mistake. I sent something to Sherlock for safekeeping and now I need it back, so I need your help."
Sherlock smiled, he has to because his alpha smiled too.
John only gaped like a fish. Sherlock would join to MI6? No! It wouldn't happen!
"John would be fine. My own doctors gonna take care of him." A tall man with umbrella shown up. He smelled familiar to Sherlock's nose. His own blood, his brother. He can trust him. "But now it's important to take them to their nest. John to recover and Sherlock to calm down. If you'll excuse us..."
"Okay. We'll pull you in tomorrow, off you go."
There will be what will be, decided John. He reached out for the strawberry flavoured lube on the bedside table. They bought it together in the Tesco. Sherlock watched as John poured a lube on his fingers and he started to finger himself. The alpha disliked it. It was his duty. Take care of his omega. He growled.
"He didn't took anything. Your rejection did that."
'Still he is with him. You are doing something wrong.'
John started to get wet. When Sherlock realised it, he blanketed John with his own body.
"The hell?" He quickly checked him. "What's wrong?" Sherlock pressed his head to John's abdomen. "What is this tantrum about? You scared me. It was only a drink with a friend. It doesn't matter he is an alpha." John massaged his scalp.
"As ever, I'm concerned about you. We have more in common that you'd like to believe. This petty feud between us is simply childish. People will suffer. And you know how it always upset Mummy."
"Give me a good reason to stay then."
"Well, the symptoms are clear to me."
"Good evening, Mycroft. Try not to start a war before a get home, you know what is does with the traffic." Sherlock said goodbye to his brother and leaved with John by his side.
"Who's on forensics?"
John was uncertain. He dreamt several times Sherlock came back to him alive, and the awakening was always painful.
"Fine." What else could he say?
Mycroft sighed.
"But we both know it's not quite true." Sherlock blinked. He started to sweating his shirt over. "Well, I'd be better be off. So nice to had a proper chat."
"You can't be that ignorant, Sherlock! You stayed in alpha mode not just a few hours. It's dangerous! That's what I told you for a long time. You can't deny your alpha's want."
"Oh, God!" Moaned John. "Stop it!" Sherlock only licked him more vehemently. He not only licked his rim, but nipped the skin on the cheeks.
"No, Sherlock. I'll go down to Mrs. Hudson. I'll call your brother."
Sherlock-from hour to hour-felt worse and worse. Mrs. Hudson left the flat. Sherlock can's stand anyone in the flat, expect John. He sat on his armchair, his head clenched between his hands. He was sweating bullets, hyperventilated. Distress was in the air.
So when he heard a knock on the front door, John was relieved. But instead of a black curly head, a blond one appeared in the flat.
Sherlock's head started to ache. Moriarty couldn't got him again that easily.
"Well, what do you call this then?"
"Sherlock's business bloomed since you two works together." Mycroft told John. "I just recommended him a case." He got up from John's armchair an gave him a file. "Andrew West, a civil servant was found dead at the station this morning, he was worked on a missile defense system for the Ministry. Bruce-Partington project. The project was on a pen drive, it's missing. West could take it with him. It must be found, before it falls into wrong hands."
A muscle twitched in Sherlock's face.
Sherlock raised his head with alarm.
"John, you smell..."
"We were not a real couple." Protested John. "You didn't wanted it. Not really."
"Relax, you doing fine" Sherlock smiled at John's annoyance. "Well?"
"Why do you keep saying suitcase?" Lestrade interrupted.
His alpha chest rumbled with joy. He pulled John's hip up so he could touched his cock. He pulled it firmly at the same time he was tender. John moans were loader. It excited his alpha further. He slipped his penis between his omega's arse cheeks, rutted rhythmically while bite angry kisses at his neck.
"John!"
Sherlock knocked John on the floor in a moment. He grabbed John by the hair, forced him to look into his eyes.
"I'm glad no one saw that. You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool. People might talk."
"Oh, dear. They are making such a mess" complained their landlady. "What are they looking for?"
"Do you love her?"
"I want to solve the problem. Our final problem. It's gonna start very soon Sherlock. The fall. But don't be scared. Falling just like flying, except there's a more permanent destination."
"What to do with this? Whistle and a picture?" asked Lestrade.
"It's natural. An alpha misses his omega..." MH
"Use your imagination!"
Sherlock was so serious, John frowned. The detective didn't know where to start, but he saw from the features of the doctor, he demands answers.
"Sexy." A female voice.
The detective forced him to look into his eyes. It was unpleasant. Even without it the genius could read him well.
"Is that three patches?"
Just then he realised... Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?  Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd? The taxi driver came for him.
John saw Sherlock from the window. He called Jennifer Wilson's phone, but nobody picked up. He tried to search it it with the laptop. Lestrade didn't understood why the detective leaved, he felt Sherlock let him down, so he left the flat with his people.
"No! No, you stupid git! I want the bond, but we have to wait. For the heat. Maybe I'm able to..." He sighed. Why is the alpha slow-witted? It is because of the rut? Or because Sherlock and his alpha is in balanced?
"So, how do you know, I am back?" John inquired.
Mrs. Hudson's voice also seemed weird, when she called him that day. She told John she has to visit her sister, so John would stay alone in the flat for few days.
"No, you came for the photographs, but that's never gonna happen."
John was confused. Mary quit her job and left, not only the job but also the city. She wrote a letter to John.
John was left alone.
"She could have checked in a hotel, left it there" guessed John.
"Neither am I, Mycroft."
"I'm so frightened." Sherlock whispered.
"What point?"
"What are you doing?"
"Who are you, what do you do?"
"What about your taxi?
The alpha's chest rumbled with joy. The head of his cock drove into his partner. John spread his legs wider. Inch by inch Sherlock's penis went further in John's channel. When he was full inside, Sherlock snuggled to John's back.
"Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi is here Sherlock." Mrs. Hudson came.
"He planned it thoroughly." Sherlock paced up and down on the street. "People will believe him because he incorporated the truth with his lies. I have to do something."
"God, Sherlock!" He grabbed his lover's hair, and trusted deeper in his mouth. "Sorry! It's too good."
"My what?"
"Have you talked to the police?"
"Are you sure?"
Sherlock watched the street from the window. It was odd to being in the flat again, still it was familiar. He was at home, safe and sound. He was waited for John, he couldn't imagine how would the doctor react. Mrs. Hudson screamed and screamed until she fainted. Sherlock didn't assume John would faint. What would John do?
The other guests in the restaurant started to watch them, meanwhile their dinner arrived.
"I can't."
"Oh, I'm playing. This is my turn." John would enjoyed this, seeing him brilliant. " There's a photograph of children in your cab. Their mother's been cut out. If she'd died, she'd still be there. The photograph is old, but the frame is new. You think of your children, but you don't get to see them. Estranged father. She took the kids, but you still love them, it still hurts. Your clothes recently laundered, but everything you're wearing is at least three years old. And you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What's that about? Three years ago. Is that when they told you?"
Sherlock jumped up as he was poured down with icy water.
Sherlock found himself laying on the ground and John hit him wherever he could. The detective let him. He didn't even tried protect himself, only clutched John's jacket as he feared John would vanish.
But something definitely was.
John only perceived the screams and howls, the death rattles. He saw The Woman ran to the safe, punched the code and take out her phone, then run away through the window. When the doctor dared to look up, the room looked like a battle field in Afghanistan. Blood and dead bodies everywhere.
"You blackmailed the jury."
"You bastard! You torturing me!"
"Very good."
"That you're a dead man walking. Am I right?"
"You. You will take the room upstairs."
John ejaculated again.
"Your sponsor. Who was it? The one, who told you about me, my fan. I want a name."
The taxi stopped at Roland-Kerr Further Education College.
"No!" Sherlock spoke again.
"Lestrade is dull. John would never interested about him."
"Yes, you need to sleep."
He was thinking about suicide yesterday... What has changed? He desperately tried to hold on anything to frees him from nightmares, self pity and the throbbing pain in his leg.
"What do you expect from me?" Sniffed John.
"It's time to take things in my own hand." John put his gun into his jacket.
"You could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational." Sherlock's heart warmed a bit at John's outburst, but he just silenced the doctor.
"I hate you!" The doctor gasped.
"Actually you can't." Sherlock smirked. "I read after it in the Alpha-Omega courting etiquette lexicon. You can refuse me, but can't forbid the courtship."
"In my jacket."
"Bit risky, wasn't it? Took me away under the eye of policemen. And Mrs. Hudson will remember you."
"Not in a police car. I'll be right behind."
"Well, the question is where is her phone now?"
"Good shot." Sherlock told him with his "I knows everything" look. "Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers... Are you all right?"
They understood each other without words. The air changed, shifted back into something that resembled comfort and cosiness.
“They were, but then I didn’t want to risk this brilliant opportunity to examine a previously poisoned, then badly beaten body’s bruises post-mortem.
He handed him a tissue and Sherlock had to blink twice to process John’s outstretched hand. And when he blinked, he felt something wet on his cheeks, slowly making its way to the ground.
John stared at him a little longer than one should expect, then turned in his seat to face the blurred streets behind the window pane.
“We can go home, if you want”, was all he said.
“You should shut up, too.”
Sherlock didn’t say a word, only nodded.
“You mean you love me like your best friend?”
“No.” Sherlock was deadly serious, John could tell. “No, it isn’t, and it shouldn’t be.”
“I honestly don’t want to talk about it. No, Sherlock”, he said when he saw Sherlock’s protesting hands raised by pure desperation. “Seriously. It’s over.”
“Over.” He echoed the word, but it sounded empty. “You say it’s over.”
Sherlock’s face was as blank as a sheet of paper when he sank back into his chair and looked into the dancing flames.
Sherlock stood up, grinning happily as he soothed down the crease on his coat.
“Enlighten
“What the hell are we even doing here?! You solved this bloody case an our ago! We even reported everything to Greg!
“Yes. I couldn’t bring myself to it. Because if I hadn’t been able to talk to my best friend for long years, why should I be bothered about the faceless crowd waiting for my words? I don’t care about entertaining the housewives with our stories. I only care about the man whom I shared those adventures with. And that man was lost to me.”
That was… well, that was awful. From me. You didn’t deserve it. You’ve gone through tough shit as well, and I just made it far worse. I was selfish. You really didn’t deserve it.”
“Why should I?” Sherlock asked, but he was already on his feet, taking a step toward a hysterically laughing John.
He was afraid of what would come after the silence, what would break the newly found peace if not him. What will come next?
Sherlock made a huge effort to cover the whirlwind of emotions in his eyes; he smiled, smugly, although a bit weakly.
“You lost me?! I was grieving you, Sherlock, for years! For nothing!”
John didn’t want to look up, and he couldn’t. Everything he held inside wanted to burst out of him. He felt lost, just like after the Jump, or after Mary’s betrayal.
“You cried first, you bastard. It’s my duty to follow you in every kinds of shit, isn’t it?”
“Then come here, you bastard.”
“You have! You have so many things you haven’t told, not to anyone. You… you are so quiet.”
“Yes or no?”
“So you like that hugging thing after all, huh?”
“Sentiment. Do I sense some sentiment here?”, he teased. “Sherlock, it hurts now, I can name those bones without feeling all of them at the same time.” Sherlock stared, and his grip loosened a bit. “So, can you add to the conversation now? You were the one demanding answers: now you are a mute but it’s your turn now. I don’t like rambling to myself, I feel like I’m an idiot.”
“John, answer me.”
“Is it settled, then? Are we all right?”
“Get what?”
And he wanted to make it right, to correct this huge error he didn’t dare to think he would ever cause.
It can’t be. He can’t be. He can’t be
„I’ve heard it an hour ago, hardly a surprise” Sherlock murmured, maybe more to himself than to John, and still his gaze was fixed on the victim’s face. John gave a disapproving grunt.
Obviously, Sherlock seemed kind of happy – that bizarre smile was sitting across his thin lips, his eyes were sparkling with great interest and amusement. And when he looked up, his expression made it perfectly clear that John’s irritation only fuelled his amusement.
“Wha…”
The soft, silent plea is his eyes caught Sherlock off-guard.
“You’re impossible. I want to hug you. I got so tired of arguing with you. Bet you enjoyed that, you drama queen.”
“Greg?”
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Of course, you are an idiot, John” Sherlock snapped instantly, out of pure reflexes. “You are an idiot if you don’t know how I feel about this, about you. Is this still a question?”
“You stopped blogging.”
He didn’t say a word, just shook his head and the doctor quickly stuffed the tissue back into his pocket like nothing had happened.
In a sense, it was all Sherlock’s fault, he knew that.
The minutes passed and Sherlock grew a bit impatient; he wanted to shape his thoughts into words that would make sense, just to break the comfort before something else does. Cosiness crept under his skin, marching into his soul with great triumph, effortlessly. For some reason it made him fear of something.
Sherlock didn’t even acknowledge his own tears; there were just a few, they escaped his notice.
“Alone is what I have” Sherlock’s voice was trembling like his hands. “Alone protects me.”
“Finish the sentence, I’m listening”, Sherlock said, a bit more dryly than he actually wanted to. John looked a bit puzzled, like a deer in headlights.
“Yes” John sighed “I do.”
He missed his best friend.
Sherlock’s voice was deep with determination. “Never do that. Ever.”
“I can’t follow your flawless way of thinking.”
“That I love you!” John shouted a bit frustrated, but somehow calmly, like he was preparing himself to say this sentence out loud for decades. “For all those years I did, but I was so bloody scared to tell you!”
“I’m so sorry for making you unable to write. I know it means a lot to you.”
“It kind of is now, though. You die, I die inside too. You return, I return too. You lead, I’ll follow. You solve crimes and I blog about it.”
Usually he hated peace, he rushed to tear it down into little pieces. It reminded him of laziness and unpleasant waiting, what he would avoid at any cost. But he discovered another type of peace – a peace around John. It wasn’t lazy nor unpleasant, it felt natural and good. He sometimes didn’t like this feeling, because he grew fond of it, and he hated loving it.
“I do too.” After a short pause, he added:
He wasn’t ashamed of them. He saw just the same emotions inside the detective’s always cold eyes.
“Are you
They were now sitting in a cab, which gave them a bit of comfort and warmth after the chilly winds of London. Silence heavily fell on them, but it wasn’t uncomfortable nor awkward. It was a silence filled with unspoken words, with something like a promise lingering in the air.
“Well, yes. That would have been a shame, really.”
The following silence was awkward. Sherlock gaped like a fish, John looked relieved but a bit uncomfortable. Suddenly the look on Sherlock’s face darkened.
Like before. And there is no why.” He squeezed his hand in his. “I don’t understand… oh my god, this sounds cheesy, but it’s… We… It had been years. Years passed and we never said out loud… the things we should have. And when you died, I thought there is no way to ease the pain. That the words are helplessly stuck inside, and there will never be a single soul on this Earth whom I could share those words with.”
John was leaning to a stone-cold garage door, arms crossed, patience wearing thin on his face.
John, who had been gathering breath for the forthcoming yells, stood, his mouth hanging open. The air left his lungs in a violent hiss.
John wanted to get up, with the determination of running away a hundred miles at least, but Sherlock’s firm grip in his wrist stopped him.
It was almost like
“I’m an idiot, you never forget to remind me of that. So, enlighten me, great detective.”
“Yes, I do. Love you. And stuff. Don’t look so amazed!” When there was still no reaction from Sherlock, John swiftly added: “You are my best friend, of course, I do.”
„I’m getting extremely impatient, you know.”
“Why?” Sherlock asked with raw disbelief in his tone. “I hurt you more than I hurt anyone, I lied to you…”
“Oh, shut up or I’ll let you go!”
“That’s why you stopped blogging.”
“As I mentioned before, I have nothing to say.”
He’d had enough.
But John, from time to time, gave him side eye, and looked rather perplexed. John
“You hadn’t told me you wanted to go home. You shall be more specific and not that cryptic about the wishes to be fulfilled, John.”
He couldn’t look into the detective’s eyes because he was sure he would only find depthless pain and sorrow gleaming inside. The melody he was humming was so heart-breaking: it was a mixture of the waltz he composed for John and Mary’s wedding, intertwined with a sad lullaby that resonated deep in his bones and ears. When the melody reached its highest peak, the flames climbed up high in the pit, devouring everything in its wake, dancing wildly and vividly. Then Sherlock went silent, the flames went dormant, and it was achingly cold in the room.
to death, starving and bored as hell. And you say that
He deeply missed this look; after the Jump, he didn’t really get to see it in his blogger’s cold and empty eyes. He missed the mocking, the nicknames, the laughs they used to share so often. The naturality of their seemingly inconvenient relationship.
“Oh, don’t pretend you don’t have a clue what I’m talking about! Lestrade, you git!” John was practically shouting and stepped closer to the lying body on the ground, and to the consulting detective hovering above it. Sherlock was looking intently at the blackening scars, the colourless, distorted expression, and the venom-poisoned veins under the deadly pale skin. Well, it could be interesting for 10 minutes maybe. But for an hour?! It was just way too much for John. The sky got darker and darker, the wind blew under his jacket, its cold fingers ruffled his hair, harshly tickled his chest.
Then Sherlock started to hum.
“I didn’t mean to make you cry. I apologise.”
“Well…” John looked at him, carefully adjusting his facial expression to the situation; it moulded into a worried frown. “You are… whatever. Here.”
He slowly raised his head up. He locked his gaze with Sherlock’s, feeling the tears running down on his cheeks.
“No, it isn’t.” John finally managed to get himself together. “So you say that we should head home. Now. When I’m
"Maybe she left it when she left the case. Maybe he took it from her for some reason. Either way, the balance of the probability is the murderer has her phone."
"And if it want's so much more..."
"Would you care about the highest bidder."
The lady, named Jennifer Wilson, lay on the wooden floor. He was dressed in pink to the feet. The grey haired inspector, Lestrade provided details about the circumstances of her death. Sherlock closely observed the body.
He couldn't wait for John to make the first step. He got closer and hugged him. He smelled John's hair. It turned to grey a little, reminding Sherlock of the wasted time. He felt John sniffed into his neck before he wrapped out of his embrace.
As Moriarty gone, Sherlock jumped to John.
Sherlock was sure, it has to be somewhere, so he ran out, and asked about it from the others outside.
"I know." John's voice fainted. "But..."
"What do you think then Dr. Watson?" Mrs. Hudson inquired. "There is another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms."
"You are so ordinary, really. She gave you a puzzle and watched you spinning. How quick you figured the e-mail out for her?"
Oh, God, how he missed it! He missed John. His dark blue eyes, his warm smile... He ached.
"Of course, I'm all right."
"I already tested it. I let Sherlock try to solve it for months and he can't."
"My alpha is an idiot!" You are an idiot!
"Right." Sherlock watched the floor, he felt a massive vertigo, so he grabbed the doorframe. He can't cry in front of John. "I excuse for robbing your time."
"No, there's something else. You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic. Love is a much more vicious motivator. Somehow this is about your children."
"Sherlock always replies to everything, he's Mr. Punchline."
Then he realised the door was open. Strange. Yet Mrs. Hudson at home?
But Sherlock only wanted to go home, working on the case.
"That was the most ridiculous thing, I've ever done" told John as they arrived home.
The doctor touched the other man's face. Sherlock stopped sulking. John kissed him and Sherlock kissed back.
"Brixton, Lauriston Gardens."
John wondered it's just some kind of manipulation from Mycroft, to keep him with his brother, but what if it's really important? What if Sherlock is in danger or took drugs again?  He got in the black car.
Irene knelt front of the detective and take his hand.
"Sherlock!"
"I told you I'm able to handle you." He pressed a kiss to his lips. "Sleep! You will need your strength."
"Irene Adler, better known as The Woman or Dominatrix. What she provides could be called pleasure author torture. She has a website."
"You are safe. I keep you safe." He rubbed his face into John's neck.
"Anderson."
"Anything happening opposite?" Sherlock constantly watched out from the window.
"What do you want, my omega? I'll give you everything."
I know you don't understand what's going on, but I can't stay with you.
"You."
"Her coat slightly damp, she's been in heavy rain the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London that time. Under her coat the collar is damp too. She's turned it up against the wind. She' got an umbrella in her pocket but it's dry and unused. Wind was too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried. Where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?" Sherlock shoved his phone to Lestrade. "Cardiff."
They were lying on the bed, Sherlock's head on John's chest. They did nothing in these few days except feeding, sleeping, showering and sexual activity. Sherlock didn't penetrated him with his cock, but he was really talented with his tongue, and those long fingers. It was long time ago, when John had sex, he started to forget the feeling. As for Sherlock, John suspected he never had sexual connection with anyone.
"I got into the Tower of London. It was child's play. Have you told your little friends yet?"
"Sherlock run!"
"It's a threat. They warning us it will happen again."
'He hurt my omega. I want to rip his throat out!'
The man walk to the door and opened it.
"What do you mean?" MH
"But I just talked to him."
"She worked as an assassin."
John looked down at his leg confused, and realised, he forgot his cane at the restaurant. Sherlock only smiled, until Mrs Hudson wouldn't come to inform him, there's the police in upstairs.
"Any good?"
Sherlock went to find the suitcase, and he found it of course, it wasn't so complicated. Of course she had a suitcase! He thought of the message Jennifer Wilson scratched in the wooden floor with her own nails: Rache... Rachel. Who is Rachel? It wasn't suicide. It was a murder. This serial killer is very interesting. John must find the killer interesting too. John... In his excitement left the doctor behind. His inner alpha started to feel restless. "Call him home!" Sherlock sent a text for John.  The detective believed John's gender won't be a problem, because it damaged, but still his alpha acted strange in his presence. Company seemed a good idea, he could talk about the cases not only with the scull. He didn't count John would raise his alpha's awareness. Maybe because John valued his intellect as others have not. Sherlock put on himself few nicotine patches to silence his wolf inside. He laid on the couch and immersed in his mind.
"What about these suicides then, Sherlock? I thought that would be right up your street. Three exactly the same.
"We should have dinner."
"How is the case?" MH
"Then I don't bother."
"It was necessary for the assassin to believe I died, just as for you. You are, you were my omega. Your reaction mattered the most. Your grief had to seemed real, and I'm sorry but you are not a good actor."
John went up the stairs with trembling legs.
"I can shoot you in the head. No one's ever gone for that option."
"I'm really not."
He took out a cream coloured jumper of the box. He lifted it to his nose and smelled the scent in.
"Where?"
"It's also your flat." John's voice was neutral.
"Boring!"
"I had to John. I had to. Moriarty would have killed you otherwise."
John was sitting in a cab. He blindly stared out from the window. His eyes watered.
"Yes." John immediately got up from the armchair.
"I'll have the gun, please." The old man raised an eyebrow.
"Excuse me Mary, but I have to kick someone in the ass."
"It won't happen. I trust you. As reassurance I remind you, I was a soldier, I could kick your ass anytime."
"Mrs. Adler." There was something very strange in this woman. He can't read hear. Even her smell was confusing. Is she an alpha or an omega?
"I care!" Protested Sherlock. "But I couldn't afford myself in that situation to think about it."
John poured from the lube again into his palm. He gently oiled his partner's penis with it. Sherlock shivered at the touch. Maybe the omega wants him after all.
Suddenly Sherlock could breath again. It would be fine. He just didn't knew how.
"Yes, I feel that too, but I feel something else." He sniffed deeply. "It smells like sunflower field, old parchment and clove."
Sherlock rutted against him like a wild animal, his lips wandered from John's lips to his neck. He sucked and nipped the skin while took deep breaths of his omega's scent.
Slowly John started to move. Sherlock let him ride.
Sherlock  swallowed his cock immediately.
"What do you mean?" Watson had a bad feeling.
"I have this theory: all hearts are broken. My brother only interested in omegas once. It wasn't serious, however my brother deeply disappointed in relationships. He didn't thought feelings are right or necessary, cause he was broken. He didn't listened to his wolf anymore, he said it gives him false impressions. But when he met you..."
"You left! You can't leave me!" he grunted.
"Be careful!" MH
He only wished it would've been Mycroft who he met. Irene Adler even in her restrained clothing were beautiful with her long eyelashes and blood red lips. John felt the ground run out under his feet.
"Time is changes, so are we." Mary squatted down in front of John and took his hand. "He said to me if you choose me, he step aside and join to MI6."
Lestrade sat on Sherlock's armchair.
"Yes, I'll heal you." He smoothed John's ribs with his hand, while he also paid attention to the doctor's nipples.
They met on a plane.
"What happened with him?"
Mycroft tried to handle Moriarty with his method. It was the beginning of the end.
"John! Stop! Go back and look up! I'm on the roof."
"Because I was terrified! I was terrified my feelings will take place my intellect. I was terrified you will be disappointed in me one day, and leave for another, because I'm not a real alpha, not a good alpha. I didn't know how to make an omega happy, how to make you happy. I only know I want to be the one for you."
