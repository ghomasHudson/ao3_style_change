He was curious though, no one ever really called Sherlock. Anyone with his number knew better. That’s when the shouting and running and leaving John behind happened.
John stood up swiftly, clearing his throat. “Not with a bandage on your head, you need rest, you can shower later.” Sherlock grumbled and stood shakily.
“Could have just come along, no need to sulk about it. Although I suppose if, as you say, it doesn’t interest you anymore then-oof” John threw the shirt at Sherlock's face.
'Doesn’t appear to need stitches. I’m patching this up and you are going to go straight to bed.’ John bent down and opened the cabinet under their sink to pull out some supplies.
“Amwell and Margery,” he said rolling up the window and slumping back into his seat to answer more of Lestrade’s annoying texts.
Sherlock stared at him with an eyebrow cocked, he got up slowly before immediately sitting back down.
'I’m fine.’ Sherlock turned in the doorway of the washroom blocking John from following him further.
Sherlock woke up slowly to the feeling of cool hands pressing to his forehead and carding through his sweaty hair.
John made his way out of the bathroom. He hesitated a moment before swinging back around the corner and narrowing his eyes, “don’t let me hear a shower running.”
“Jesus! Relax it’s just me mate.” John said shaking Sherlock’s hand off so he could reach for the first aid kit he had laid out on the tub’s ledge.
“Us.” John said flatly reaching for the mug. He took a sniff, coffee. John set it back down, looking up at Sherlock just as he looked away.
"Maybe it would help if you told him these things. You know how dense he can be dear." Mrs. Hudson patted his hand gently.
His phone buzzed on his night table and he quickly opened it to read 13 missed messages. Rolling his eyes he quickly started typing as he made his way to the shower.
'You know what? Get stuffed. I could.’ John snatched his mug from the counter and stormed into his room to sulk.
“I want to shower,” Sherlock said. John could feel him shivering, still nestled between his legs. His hand absentmindedly gripping John’s ankle. When did that happen?
John stayed silent as he pulled a shirt out. Grinding his teeth, willing himself not to get into another argument.
The sound of dripping in the doorway broke his train of thought. He jumped. Sherlock was standing in the doorway. Soaked to the bone. His thick curls glued to his face.
John had been blankly staring at the tv screen for the past 3 hours. Image after image flitted past his eyes but he absorbed none of it. It was raining outside. The rain pattered against the glass in a dull thrum. To John it was the loudest noise he’d ever heard. His ears were numb with the roar of it.
John leaned over Sherlock, light fingers parting hair and gently searching out the damage he knew was there. He grimaced as he revealed the oozing gash.
“Only me.” Sherlock smiled, before rushing down the stairs at the sound of a horn beeping, no doubt from the cab waiting to pick him up outside.
I growled, the wolf for once agreeing completely with my sentiments. No one took Sherlock Holmes without infuriating John Watson. “Let’s go!” I cried, dashing upstairs to get my gun, loading the other silver bullets I’d had made just in case. I clattered back downstairs just in time to see Phoenix take a pair of knives out of a coat pocket, slip one up each sleeve, sheath and all, and buckle them in place. “They’re silver, and more reusable than bullets,” he explained. “I’m also an ambidextrous fighter.”
“Oh, don’t feel sorry for him – or me.” RJ waved away the platitude. “Here in the UK, the threat is just about non-existent, and Phoenix only pretends to be a telepath out of habit. After all, there are more of us here than even we realised. Skye was just one of them.”
When the night was over, Skye, RJ, and Phoenix were nowhere to be found, and the only response I got from Phoenix’s number when I texted him was ‘Sry, got 2 dash, can’t tell u y, rlly sry, give SH our regards. ~RJ’.
“He’s been taken too,” Phoenix pronounced, in a tone that was a mix of finality, rage, sympathy, and desperation.
“Although he was declared dead over ten years ago, he still holds the title. Because he’s the prince, a werewolf, and my brother, there are many people who would love to get their hands on him,” the young king stated emotionlessly.
Phoenix tossed a newspaper at me and began digging around in his pockets – he was wearing this ridiculously voluminous coat over a green plaid shirt and black tie. “Might want to have a look at that.”
“Maybe he doesn’t want your protection,” Phoenix said mildly. “He’s twenty-two, Reyalon, he’s an adult both in Canarim and in England. He doesn’t need your help.” His voice turned cold. “I don’t think he wants it, either.”
At that very moment Lestrade and Donovan strode in. Phoenix whirled sharply. “Police, here about a case – Rollo, what kind?”
“I’m off again. And, John? Sherlock’s a keeper.” He nodded at my flatmate, and I tried to shake myself and not let him see how much his words affected me. God knows how much I wished for more, but that just wasn’t Sherlock’s thing.
“For one, your senses should be sharper, much sharper, than a normal human’s, even than Sherlock’s. Because of a wolf’s need to hunt, you should be able to track scents anywhere from a few minutes to a few days old, sometimes even older than that. That is, if you can ever accept that wolf of yours. He appears to be a completely separate entity. Sherlock, take care of him.” This last was said to my flatmate, who was in the middle of research, so I doubt he heard him.
Lestrade handed me off to another officer and bounded back up the stairs; I realised what had just happened. Wolf-John had just been unleashed, and he was
Thankfully, he relented. Skye, when he came by and heard about this episode, backed me up strongly, so I tried not to be too smug about it, though I don’t think John would have minded. He himself looked relieved.
“Shhh, I can smell the tracks.” I gave no other explanation, but it wasn’t necessary. Phoenix watched with eagerness as I applied my own version of Sherlock’s methods. I didn’t know London nearly as well as he did, but in the end, if I didn’t have an exact address, I had a general area that wasn’t too big.
Give Sherlock a speck of dirt and he’d give you an address. I wasn’t him, but I was a bloody dog, and the wolf in me could decode the mix of scents in the tracks to tell me vaguely where the intruders had been (hopefully, they’d been to base recently). I knelt on the floor and sniffed.
He began to unwrap it, not looking at me. “Thank you. –It’s stirring up such a commotion I had to investigate it. I’ve got contacts in the underworld and they owe me a favour or two; the information isn’t state secrets, but it’s sensitive enough to need to a patch job ASAP.” He pronounced the letters separately.
I was frightened by how easily John could be set off. Things that he would have slipped past without even a comment now elicited growls that sent a frisson of terror up my spine, much as I hated to admit it. I could tell even he was confused by it, so I tried not to tiptoe around him so obviously.
But I had plenty of evidence to support the former claim; that wolfsbane was lethal even for normal humans. I could name all the murderers who had used it in the past century, as well as going through what details of each murder I had saved.
His vehemence had startled us all, even Sherlock, who had such a stricken look on his face that I don’t believe I’d ever seen before. He’d been confronted with many emotional clients before, but the controlled intensity of this particular teacher made even me stop and stare.
His familiarity with his wolf was astonishing to me. He shifted so fluidly, so naturally, as if it was normal to him to be a fanged, raging monster of the night.
“You think Sherlock Holmes is a psychopath?” he continued. “Then you don’t want to see what I can do. I’m not clever like Sherlock or Moriarty, because yes, they’re brilliant, but I
I was mortified to find out later that I’d jumped and tried to take the casket, and it took a wiry young werewolf and a determined DI to restrain me until Sherlock was buried.
RJ took over. “Basically, if someone says that phrase, the lock system activates. That lock is only triggered by active feed from your auditory nerves.” To my raised eyebrow, he said, “In layman’s terms it only works if you
Sherlock relied heavily on his senses, and when he lost the use of even one of them he was lost too. I began feeling wildly around for him – or at least I hoped that was what I was doing, because I couldn’t feel myself.
His brother curled up on the sofa with a huff. I interceded. “Maybe it was a – I dunno, trick of the light or something?” Dammit but I was still uncomfortable with the idea of him knowing about my lycanthropy.
“Sherlock,” and this time there was a bit of a growl in it, “let me bandage those things or they’re going to get infected. Now.” Knowing what would happen if I pissed off the wolf – he was the alpha, after all, I was the beta – I obeyed.
Beside me, John cocked his head to look at the blond and the ginger, squeezing my hand in a gesture of comfort and protectiveness. “Why haven’t you shifted yet?’
I gave him a hand up, and then Phoenix was in front of us, weary and sagging but unscathed. “Thank you,” he told us. “I really wish I could find a brilliant murder just to thank you for your help. I would’ve been too late without you.” He was blushing as red as his hair and looking down.
I didn’t think that British lycanthropy could be that different, especially when Skye told me that Ayhan lycanthropy was a sort of amalgamation of all the types in the world. He knew what a British werewolf was because he’d seen one before. “
John seemed to suggest the first thing that came to mind, probably second-guessing himself. “Is he an empath?”
Working side by side on the sofa, each on our respective laptops, John would sometimes peek over my shoulder to look at my assembled articles. At one point he told me, “Look at this.” Apparently you could become a werewolf by sleeping outside with the moonlight shining on your face – absolute hogwash. “I’d have a Wolves’ Network,” I remarked whimsically. John laughed.
John, resourceful John, had pinched me as soon as he took a good whiff of the girl’s room – her specific scent – and whispered, “You find evidence. I can track them.” It would’ve looked a bit fishy if John knew exactly where they were, especially considering our position at the moment, so I did as I was told.
I scowled at him. Even if he could see so clearly through me, why did he have to broadcast it? I had long admitted my sentiment for my blogger – though not to him, or to
“It was when RJ’s case came up and Phoenix and I lived here for a bit,” he answered. “All your little mannerisms that said you were so comfortable with each other were everything an alpha pair’s should be. I knew then that your wolf had chosen Sherlock as his mate.” He raked back his hair. “You’ve met my brother.”
“Playing tag, huh?” I asked, quirking an eyebrow and easing into my chair so as not to spill my drink.
“What about you?” I snapped. “You’re no less a civilian than Sherlock is. I’m not; I’m an invalided soldier.”
Was this Mycroft’s idea of making sure I was ‘seen to’? He knew what I was. He’d probably been dying to dissect me since I’d told him. The wolf in me whimpered at the thought of being inspected and stuck under a microscope, and a pit began to form in my stomach, quite apart from the hollowness already there. Was he just planning to make me a lab rat or did he want to kill me outright for his scientists to perform post-mortems on?
“Hello?” The voice on the other side is strained, undoubtedly from the effort of dragging a considerable amount of luggage up to the fourth floor.
Here John paused to glare at Sherlock again, only to find him feigning interest in a particularly large snail, making its way towards his right shoe.
Sherlock didn't get to finish his thought as John's fist collided with his jaw. Sherlock fell on his back out of sheer shock, and by the time he got to his feet John was flexing his fist.
After Sherlock had cleaned up and dressed in a pair of gray trousers and a white shirt, he helped John pack the tent (it wasn't terribly difficult, really) and fished in his bag for some biscuits (miraculously dry) and a Sneakers (partly melted). He wasn't particularly hungry, but John was, so it made for an adequate breakfast under the circumstances.
Sherlock picked up his phone and snapped a picture of them, then wrote a quick message and threw his phone somewhere at the foot of the bed.
'Enlighten me, Sherlock. What were you hoping to prove by replacing the floor cleaning solution with highly corrosive substances?'
John followed the billowing coat to the spot where the latest victim was. A woman in her mid-thirties, naked except for a pink tutu, was suspended from the ceiling of her kitchen with thick ropes. Her hands and one leg were bound together in a caricature of a ballerina's pose. "The Puppet Master", as the author of these serial murders had been dubbed, had left a note this time, addressed to Sherlock:
'It's not my fault-' Sherlock began, but when John turned around to face him with a death glare, he stopped. Somehow, the army doctor was even more menacing while soaking wet, his white cotton shirt clinging to his skin.
Sherlock bit down and John gasped, his jaw going slack. He could only moan as Sherlock's tongue traced the abused skin, then louder as he was pressed back into the wooden door.
“He and I had... an arrangement. He was more tolerable than most people and sufficiently frustrated in order to... experiment. I was bored.” Sherlock tasted the almost-lie on his tongue and decided this was to be, from now on, the truth about the 'Victor experiment'.
'No, it was kind of them not to look for me. The housemaids would always pack me food and some of my equipment whenever I felt like disappearing, and everyone was glad I wasn't underfoot. I found nature infinitely more fascinating than the mansion,' Sherlock added. John was still not convinced that it was alright to leave unsupervised children in an uncontrolled environment, but he supposed Sherlock's upbringing had to have been as unconventional as the man himself.
“Sherlock Holmes. Second year Chemistry. I occasionally blow things up, I play the violin at ungodly hours and I annoy people with my deductions.”
'Idiot. Of course not. You didn't wake up, I moved you and you calmed down. Must have been the pressure on your shoulder that triggered the nightmare.' Reluctantly, Sherlock rolled on his back, letting John go.
“I... I've never done this before, you know, with a bloke,” confessed John, and he suddenly realised he was nervous.
'John, did you hear that? Wolves are fascinating creatures and in these woods they grow bigger and stronger, because of the climate.'
'Checked, have you?' John pulled back and rummaged through the drawer, finding two condoms and nothing else. John held them up with a raised brow.
He opened the door before the person could knock. He took a step back and the startled lady on the other side took it as invitation, quickly recovering and making her way inside. She took a quick look around, a huge grin lighting up her face, then she seemed to catch herself and quickly schooled her features in a more composed expression.
“Sherlock!” John definitely did scream then, head falling back and hitting the headboard. He could feel Sherlock's smug smile as he took him deeper, and John's hands instinctively fisted into Sherlock's dark curls. He loosened his grip at Sherlock's warning growl, stroking his scalp apologetically. He could already feel the heat in his lower abdomen, the tightening of his balls, and he knew that he had to stop or things would be over far too quickly.
Sherlock closed his eyes and rested his head against the headboard. This was a conversation he was most definitely not ready to have, least of all with John. When the latter returned with a pack of ice and a frown, Sherlock knew it was inevitable.
Sherlock was moaning steadily now, skin ablaze, head buried in a pillow, dark curls wild against the crisp white sheets. For some reason, it was that image that John found the most arousing, making his cock twitch. He was losing his patience and his composure, so he pulled his fingers out gently and asked:
Sherlock's legs pulled him closer and John let out a blissful moan. He waited a few moments for Sherlock to adjust, and then pulled back, snapping his hips forward. He hitched Sherlock's leg over his shoulder after a few tries, and found his prostate again, setting up a steady rhythm. This was somewhat familiar territory, John thought through the haze of pleasure and heat, licking into Sherlock's mouth and nibbling at his collarbone.
'Now what?' John asked, looking forlornly at what used to be the road. 'We can't climb all that way though the mud, with no proper equipment.'
Sherlock arranged his body in a thoughtful pose, but John could see the mirth crinkling the corners of his eyes.
John used one hand to pin Sherlock's writhing hip to the bed and the other to hold the base of his cock tightly as his lips moved over the shaft, flicking his tongue at the slit and circling the sensitive crown. John swallowed him down and used the free hand to pump his own neglected cock. He could feel Sherlock's quivering thighs as John's moaning added to the sensation.
“John, John, John,” Sherlock chanted, and with a final twist of his hand, he came, coating their stomachs in his seed.
“Sherlock, please. If you're sick or anything, maybe I could help. I am a doctor, well, almost...” John carefully sat on the edge of Sherlock's bed, but didn't dare check for a fever.
John let out a sigh of relief and arched into Sherlock's touch. Sherlock took this as encouragement and slipped his tongue between the other's parted lips, carefully grasping his erection. John's surprised grunt dissolved into a moan as Sherlock's hand began to move with deft strokes. When he added a twist at the end of his upstroke, John bucked and dug his nails into Sherlock's back.
'No, of course it isn't,' John spat sarcastically. 'It's not your fault that you can't be left alone without a case, lest you blow a skylight through the roof with a home-made grenade. It's not your fault that you had to come with me to this perfectly nice resort in Transylvania, complaining the whole bloody way, and I had to endure everyone's comments about how you and I had the same room number.'
They walked in silence until sunset. Somehow, they were still inside the woods and had to settle for yet another night in the tent. John was disappointed in this lack of progress, but at least they managed to find themselves closer to that stream (or was it a different one? He had no idea). Sherlock took it upon himself to set up the tent this time, and John was content to lie back and watch him struggle with the task. He was quite the fast learner, managing to finish in ten minutes. The look of utter satisfaction as he stepped back to appreciate his own handiwork warmed John's heart to no end, and he went inside to prepare for bed.
“Oh, of course! Someone in your family has a drinking problem, probably requires special care and treatment, and you help out the only way you can.”
Most of the time, people contacted them in the hope of catching a glimpse of them together. The cases were either made up or incredibly boring, but Sherlock found new ways of amusing himself.
“Happy New Year, John,” Sherlock said instead, then did a double take. “Oh, I'm sorry about your sister.”
Utterly spent, Sherlock collapsed on the mattress. John's leg had started cramping and fatigue was finally catching up with him. He rolled to the side with a groan, pulling off his condom, and he felt Sherlock turning away from the wet spot to curl around him. John realized with a start that this was becoming a
“Off, off!” John urged impatiently, and Sherlock paused his ministrations to oblige. They both stripped their tops with surprising efficiency, and Sherlock returned to his earlier task, slowly running his hands down John's ribs. John pulled him up for another kiss, hungry to taste and touch every inch of this impossible man. Sherlock's hand sneaked lower and popped John's jeans open.
'They don't. It's a feral dog, probably infested with rabies,' Sherlock breathed determined, standing straighter. The dog growled louder, fixing them with wild, beady eyes.
“We're both idiots,” John conceded, tracing Sherlock's collarbone. The man was far too skinny, the doctor in him supplied. Sexy though, John's libido countered, and he mouthed lazily at Sherlock's jaw.
Sherlock cursed sharply and batted John's hands away, undoing the button with a swift motion, then carefully lowering the zip. He pulled the jeans down along with his pants, making a keening sound in the back of his throat as John's cock sprang free. Full and already leaking, it rose from the blond curls at the base and Sherlock cupped it in his hand, running his thumb over the top and then down the swollen vein.
'Okay.' He fumbled for the condoms, tearing the packet and fumbling with the slippery latex. 'Okay,' he repeated, positioning himself at Sherlock's entrance.
“Jooohn...” The breathy sounds coming from Sherlock were clearly starting to affect John, and he started grinding in Sherlock's lap, only to find an answering hardness in the other man's pants.
'John...' Sherlock murmured affectionately, tracing the shell of John's ear with the tip of his nose. 'You're magnificent.'
'Christ, oh God,' the doctor groaned as the sensations coursed through his entire body. He was getting more and more uncomfortable in his jeans so he gently nudged Sherlock's head away while he fumbled with his fly.
John woke slowly to the sound of chirruping birds and a warm body beneath his. He cracked an eye open and saw the sleeping form of his flatmate, one arm thrown over his head and the other draped around John's shoulders. He smelled of rain and earth and something soothingly familiar, and for a moment John stroked the milky skin of his chest in small circles. Sometime during the night, they had shifted so that John's head was pillowed on Sherlock's chest, one arm around his waist, their legs tangled beneath the blanket.
John reached for Sherlock's hand and pulled him closer, lifting his arm and settling Sherlock against his chest.
Sherlock turned around in his chair to face him. With the sun behind him, he looked like an angel with a halo. Shit.
The storm turned into a light rain shortly. John lead them down towards a small flat area near the stream that ran along their path and cleared it of twigs before Sherlock set up the tent. It was an odd sight, Sherlock on his knees in the mud, trying to figure out how it was supposed to go up. After watching him for a good ten minutes, John took pity on Sherlock and under the pretense that they both had to sleep in there, preferably before dawn, he made quick work of the small tent.
'Well, strip. Those clothes won't get you warm,' John's feeble attempt at sarcasm didn't manage to mask the genuine concern in his voice.
'John, John, I'm... You...' Sherlock screamed as his cock was engulfed in the hot, tight wetness of John's mouth.
Sherlock, who had stood still as a statue during his little speech, startled as John got up and strode toward him, a sly smile on his face. He realised, belatedly, that, should he try to get up, his legs would not cooperate. Just like that, John was inches away from his face, stroking the side of his neck as he leaned in to whisper, “I know.”
It was John who hissed as he breached Sherlock, watching his finger disappear into that yielding passage. Sherlock just pushed against him and arched his back, sighing and guiding John deeper.
Sherlock nodded, speechless, and tore at the paper to reveal a strip of deep blue cashmere. He took the scarf out and held it, carefully cataloging the texture of the fiber. He finally looked up at John, who was smiling broadly, eyes crinkling at the corners.
John sighed and steeled himself for a new wave of weirdness. Ever since the picture incident last week, Sherlock had been eerily silent, hadn't shot the wall once and had refused to let John anywhere near his own laptop. John still couldn't figure out how to efficiently browse the Internet from his phone so he resigned himself to his fate.
Sherlock looked over John's shoulder at his laptop. The browser page showed a site he'd never seen before.
'Seeing you with them is torture,' Sherlock glowered at the junction of John's neck and shoulder, punctuating every pause with a kiss. 'My John is better than them, better than all of them, he's alive!'
Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed to take it all as a sociological experiment. He was fascinated by the concept of influencing the masses via
Sherlock folded his arms and sat on a flat rock, looking surprisingly unaffected by their current situation. His black suit was completely ruined and his curls were plastered to his forehead, yet he didn't seem to notice or care.
John threw his hands in the air and resumed his pacing. There was a loud, crackling thunder and the birds scattered from the nearby trees in a flutter of wings.
“That's all... your stuff?” John said, eyeing the cardboard boxes which made up a barricade around the spare bed.
'Yes?' John replied coyly, tracing his index finger around Sherlock's rim. He was relaxed from his orgasm, wet from John's tongue, and John's finger went in easily to the first knuckle. 'Is this what you want?'
Sherlock sucked his lower lip into his mouth and spread his other hand on John's chest, moving slowly towards the bulge in his jeans. When John gasped he leaned down and brushed his lips to John's chastely, then again, a little slower, until John moaned and grabbed the back of his neck, pulling him in for a deeper kiss.
'My family had a mansion in Scotland. I used to wonder the woods when I got bored. It was very good for hiding. No-one ever came looking for me, they all assumed I was smart enough to eventually find my way back.'
"Well, no-one seems to be paying any attention to you right now. It's not that they don't trust you, that's just the police, mostly. But since you can't go to them for work, you're not in the papers, and that means zero publicity. You were gone for three years, we need something to draw the attention of the media!"
Now John sat in his chair, laptop open on his knees as he checked his blog again. No new messages, no more hits on his page, not even hate mail. John sighed and put the laptop away, absently massaging his thigh.
Without thinking, Sherlock cupped John's face in both hands and adjusted the angle, so he could deepen the kiss. It was John's turn to moan, and he temporarily lost his balance, propping his hand on Sherlock's knee. Impatient, Sherlock pulled John on his lap and felt the older man's fingers gently tugging at his hair.
“Do you have any...” John knew how this worked, in theory, and he knew it wouldn't be fun for either of them without some sort of lubrication. Sherlock fumbled under the bed for a while and finally produced a half-empty bottle of lube and a pack of condoms. He parted his legs even further and John squirted some lube on his fingers.
“Oh, god, yes.” John sat up and Sherlock reversed their positions, discarding the rest of his clothing in the process.
"If you remember, the arrangement was that, if the project was a success, and it obviously is, you would send us-"
which to John was a little disturbing. Needless to say, Mycroft appeared to be quite proud of his little brother's scheming and, after he made sure there was no need to have the explicit websites taken down, he amused himself by ordering prints of the artwork and having the Homeless Network put them up around London.
John was standing straight, his gun still trained on the dead animal, his breath coming in harsh pants. Sherlock looked at him in awe and finally John put the gun away to look at his friend.
'We know we had been headed south, but veered east. The hotel is north, and the moss shows us the way. There's also a town south-east of the hotel, around 20 miles away, but we can't be on the right path towards it, since those hills you see on your right should be directly in front of us. Our best chance is to try to reorient ourselves and pray that we can find that hotel again.'
John sighed. He just hoped they painted a pitiful enough picture to melt the manager's stony heart and soothe his ego. Steeling himself for a long hike, John fished his track boots out of his bag and, shaking his head at Sherlock's Italian leather shoes (of course he had refused to pack anything more appropriate for a mountain resort), he started to make his way through the trees.
Sherlock was back. He didn't have any cases. He was seriously considering calling Mycroft to give him
'And it didn't occur to you that maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to upset the manager of the only fucking hotel on a fifty mile radius, fail to apologize, insult his wife and make him throw us out in the fucking rain?!'
Sherlock smiled, a genuine, warm smile, and kissed John slowly. That was something he definitely looked forward to.
It turned out the serial killer was a salesman with a psychotic disorder and a fascination for Tchaikovsky. Sherlock solved the case in less than three hours and the papers were demanding interviews and photo shoots with the rehabilitated hero and his "partner".
“John, John I need you in me,” Sherlock pleaded. John's jaw was already aching, but he was pleased to note that even after his inexpert fumbling, Sherlock's erection hadn't faltered.
John pulled back a little, sitting on Sherlock's thighs, and held Sherlock's gaze. They were both panting and their lips were swollen. Very deliberately, John parted Sherlock's dressing gown and popped the topmost button of his shirt open. He could see Sherlock's pupils dilate even further, and he bent over to taste the newly-exposed skin.
Without looking back, Sherlock darted through the trees with a smug smile. John looked like he wanted to object but decided against it and quickly followed Sherlock, throwing a last doubtful glance at a sparse patch of moss.
“John,” Sherlock murmured, like a prayer, but he couldn't tell what he was praying for. John seemed to know regardless, as he pressed himself flush with Sherlock and sucked eagerly at his pulse point. Sherlock very nearly screamed.
'Yes, fuck yes, yours,' John managed through Sherlock's ministrations. The taller man pulled back a little.
John stormed in the tent with as much dignity as he could muster, considering he had to crawl inside through the mud. Sherlock picked up his bag and stormed off towards the stream, the effect not quite as dramatic without his coat.
Ever since Sherlock had returned, a couple of months ago, his life had changed surprisingly little. John had imagined countless times what would happen if Sherlock showed up on his doorstep one day with an explanation and that spark in his eyes that John associated with a particularly interesting case. He never gave up hope, no matter how much everyone around him seemed to think it wasn't healthy to hang on to the memory of a dead man for so long.
“Don't be silly, John,” Sherlock chided and put the cigarette in a strange contraption sitting on his desk. John watched in fascination as the strange mechanism came to life at Sherlock's gentle prodding and the cigarette was now smoked by a sort of air pump.
"Why not? It would be tremendous fun to watch how people react to it. And it's not as though anyone but Alex and Devin know who you are."
John shook his head and headed to his duffel bag instead, and pulled out a neat package wrapped in plain brown paper. He threw it at Sherlock and crossed his arms, waiting. Sherlock looked up, annoyed at the interruption, and carefully picked up the small package.
John cried out and fumbled for Sherlock's zip, managing to get it undone and pull out his hardened member. He was a bit longer than John, but not as thick, fitting perfectly with the man's slender frame. Sherlock groaned loudly and thrust up into John's hand. The doctor pushed him onto his back, straddling his hips and licking the long column of his throat, leaving bites and angry red marks. He nibbled at his collarbone, sticking his tongue in the hollow of his throat and following a straight path downward.
Sherlock promptly confiscated John's laptop and began scrolling through the page. His eyes widened and he gaped, but when John wanted to look over his shoulder Sherlock quickly scrolled through and shook his head. He was blushing, John couldn't help but notice, but he knew it was a lost cause trying to distract him when Sherlock fixated himself on something so he went and made some tea.
With an uncharacteristic lack of coordination, Sherlock managed to twist onto his front. John urged him to fold his legs and kneel on the bed, and Sherlock braced himself on his forearms as John parted his cheeks and pressed a slicked finger into him.
“I doubt you can see much in here, though,” John put the kettle on and once again scrunched up his nose as he saw Sherlock reach for his lighter again.
He turned to face Sherlock, who remained silent still. He crossed his arms, averting his gaze and studying the dead beast.
"So... what are you..." John waves vaguely, a confused look on his face. Sherlock sits up and steeples his fingers, clearly intrigued.
Sherlock took in the curve of his backside in his white cotton briefs as purely objective data collection, of course.
“Why are you here? You are in your third year of medical training, you have nearly perfect grades, so surely the College has a cozy little room for you somewhere near campus.”
“I'm going out, there's too much smoke in here,” John declared, setting his cup down with a loud clatter.
Just as he was about to lie back down, he heard John call his name in an urgent whisper. Frowning, he crawled outside and stood next to John, whose face was frozen in a mask of tension, his eyes wide. His terrified gaze was fixed on a huge gray dog, standing no more than ten feet away from them, its teeth bared and growling. It was larger than a common wolf and was frothing at the mouth.
Slowly, deliberately, John lowered his lips to Sherlock's, giving him plenty of time to refuse. But refusing was the farthest thing from Sherlock's mind as he felt John kiss him, just a simple press of lips, but so tender and sweet that he felt his chest constricting. When John probed with his tongue, Sherlock moaned, a deep sound reverberating through their ribcages, which had somehow got very very close.
John realized he was supposed to give some sort of answer but all he could do was stare at that mouth and imagine running his tongue over the pale lips until they were red and wet and-
'Doctor,' John corrected, wriggling his fingers suggestively and tilting his head back for a kiss. Sherlock's laugh was light and merry and John thought that, of all the sounds he'd coaxed out of Sherlock, that one was his favourite.
'Mmm,' was the only response as Sherlock snuggled closer, draping himself over every inch of warm skin he could reach. John chuckled and ran his fingers through Sherlock's damp curls, massaging his scalp until they both fell asleep.
There was a long pause in which Sherlock welcomed the cool sensation on his bruised eye and John tried to deal with several realisations at once.
'Look!' Sherlock called to him from outside. John popped his head out and focused his gaze in the direction Sherlock was indicating.
'I probably deleted the instructions for this, didn't seem useful,' Sherlock mumbled and began rummaging through his bag.
"You are American. Young, I'd say early 20s, probably a student so you're here on a scholarship or some other programme. Not rich, so not on holiday. Not relatives, either. Photographer. Also possibly a writer." He pauses, his eyes narrowing.
"People only care about the cases insofar as they are about you. You remember the success of John's block skyrocketed once his posts focused more on your personal life?"
The knob turns and a rather short man with a shock of sandy hair enters the stuffy studio apartment, dragging a large duffel bag and wearing an uncertain half-smile.
He looked up from his screen to find Sherlock staring intently at him. He was sure his pupils must be blown up and he felt a little flushed, not to mention his elevated heart rate. Sherlock didn't say anything, though, just looked at him with his intense gaze, a small smile tugging at the corners of his perfect lips-
"So a criminal mastermind and the largest organized crime ring are not interesting enough for the public?" Sherlock scoffed and crossed his arms. John could almost swear he was pouting.
'How do you know how to orient yourself in the woods?' John asked. 'You don't seem like the type to go hiking with your family...'
It was all Sherlock's fault, of course, for being such an irresponsible child all the time, but it didn't make John feel any better. No, in fact, having to babysit the consulting five-year-old was an even harder task while outside, in the middle of a bloody forest, in bloody Romania. In the rain.
“If you plan on getting me a present, don't,” Sherlock said sternly from behind his laptop screen. John stopped dead in his tracks, one arm caught in his jacket and the other fumbling with his scarf.
For the past two weeks, John couldn't stop thinking about Sherlock. Ever since the Victor incident, John has been trying and failing to act normal around his roommate. Initially, it had been hard for John to piece together the information he got out of their little talk: Sherlock was gay; Sherlock broke up with his sort-of-boyfriend, or, he suspected, the other way around; Sherlock had chosen to keep both of these things from him; and Sherlock, it would seem, thought that HE was gay. The whole thing made him feel so many different emotions (confusion, enlightenment, anger, disappointment, confusionconfusionconfusion) that he could barely recall that afternoon, so busy was he, sorting though all that. But later, as he lay wide awake in his bed at 4 am, he had an epiphany.
He let out a frustrated groan as he popped the first few buttons only to reveal another layer of cotton underneath. Without much consideration for John's wardrobe, Sherlock tore at his shirt and roughly pushed his vest up, licking a wet stripe from John's navel up to his sternum. John's hands came up to his sides and fumbled helplessly with Sherlock's shirt, as the younger man latched onto a nipple.
'Look, that tree there has been struck by lightning. You know, there is a big chance of us getting struck if you're planning to settle on that plateau there.'
John turned to face him fully but otherwise didn't move. He waited impassively for Sherlock to continue.
John tentatively grabbed Sherlock's cock, trying to remember every blowjob he'd ever got, but his brain seemed to freeze. Sherlock's hand gently stroked his hair and John parted his lips, licking the clear fluid from the slit. Sherlock gasped and John felt a wave of adrenalin go through his system. Boldly, he wrapped his lips around the head and stroked the frenulum with his tongue. Sherlock shuddered, fingers twitching against John's scalp, then tugging sharply as John accidentally grazed him with his teeth.
'Bloody hell!' John grunted and twisted his finger, crooking it a couple of inches in, against Sherlock's prostate. The man let out a surprised little moan, then canted his hips to grind John against that perfect spot. John indulged him, allowing a few strokes before pulling out, spitting again and attempting to fit two fingers in.
than in his work, and it was starting to worry John. They hadn't had a serious case yet, but Sherlock didn't seem to mind as much as before as he stood cross-legged on the sofa and read the blog Devin and Alex had set up. John was still weary after his first peak but was determined to see what the fuss was all about. If it kept Sherlock interested, it must be fascinating. The again, dust was fascinating for Sherlock so maybe he shouldn't get his hopes up.
Sherlock suddenly sprung back up, steepling his fingers under his chin and focusing once again on John.
“I didn't think it relevant. You don't have to spend your money on some sentimental piece of rubbish that will end up in the back of a drawer, John.”
The way Sherlock said his name made John look up at him. There was something both commanding and pleading in his voice, something so raw it never failed to capture the doctor's attention.
'Is this what you want?' John whispered in Sherlock's ear, repeating the pistoning motion. Sherlock's open mouth fell silent as John sped up with surgical precision. 'Is this what you need? Is this how you like it?'
"Thorough research and observation are essential, John. You seemed to enjoy the fruits of my labor."
'Good shot,' he said eventually, taking in John's blown pupils and steady hands. His adrenaline-fueled body was taut and vibrating with unspent energy.
'Ngh!' Sherlock's reply might have been more elaborate, but John's hand against his windpipe prevented it. John's thrusts became slow and deep, a steady roll of his hips, like waves crashing against the shore. Sherlock's position offered him little control, but John seemed to know what he needed. He released Sherlock's throat and reached over to find his cock leaking steadily.
“Well, I suppose we need to shower at some point,” John began, his hand stilling over Sherlock's heart. Then he added, in a more serious tone: “We already live together, I make you tea, and you grow cultures on my toothbrush. None of that has to change.”
They didn't stop until lunch. As they went, Sherlock would point out various plants or small animals, giving a detailed list of their properties or habits, whether or not they made good pets and whether or not people would notice. Some of his claims seemed utterly ridiculous and John was not surprised to learn that many of these observations came from personal experience.
“But- how did the landlady know, and I didn't?” he asked, and Sherlock predictably rolled his eyes. “I'm your roommate!”
“None of the other places would have me. I'm not very easy to be around I'm afraid, and I accidentally blew up my old dorm room...”
'Please, what, Sherlock?' John's voice was hoarse as he traced Sherlock's balls lightly. Sherlock squirmed. 'What more do you want?'
'You said yourself this was fun. Would you have been happier on a perfectly safe, perfectly boring trip with
Mary understood, of course. It was one of the reasons why he married her. She understood why he was reluctant to leave Baker Street, why he spoke so often of Sherlock in the present tense. John knew she loved him more than he would ever be able to love her, that his heart was missing an important piece and he could only give her a broken stub of affection. But he married her anyway. And she left, after a while. And he returned to Baker Street. And he felt not regret, nor remorse, but relief.
John nodded and went to grab Sherlock's bag. It had ripped in one corner, and bars of Sneakers fell out of the hole, as well as a map and a compass. John didn't look up.
'Get under the cover, we'll share the heat,' John offered, already half-asleep. He jumped a little as Sherlock's cold feet came in contact with his own, but he shortly grew accustomed to the long body pressed against his left side. Sherlock was lying on his back, his arms wrapped around his torso, his teeth clattering.
Sherlock groaned and shifted. John knew the pictures of dissections always put Sherlock in a good mood. He got up, to allow Sherlock to sit up properly, and gasped at the sight of Sherlock's face. His right eye was swollen shut, and his lower lip was split.
Sherlock was quick as lightning. In one fluid motion he grabbed his bag from next to him and, just as the dog was charging towards John, he swung the bag at it, effectively sending it a few feet backwards. The beast was quicker, though, and charged again faster than Sherlock could duck. A deafening crack and a pained howl were all he could hear before he saw the dog crumble to the ground, a bloody wound in its side.
As John leaned in to inspect his eye more closely, Sherlock sighed and patiently endured John's careful prodding.
Without thinking, John closed the small distance between them and pressed their mouths together. One hand went up to tangle in Sherlock's curls while the other grabbed his hip to steady himself. Sherlock's lips parted with a breathy moan and John darted his tongue between them, tentative little flicks, then bolder strokes. Figures, John thought in passing, they fit together so seamlessly it was impossible to imagine them otherwise. It felt right, the way very few things ever had to John, even as their noses bumped, seeking out the best angle.
'Of course I do, I'm not an idiot!' Sherlock snapped, eyes blazing. At John's disbelieving snort, he raked a nervous hand through his hair.
Sherlock paused to tug at John's jeans and pants, and the other man dutifully lifted his hips to allow Sherlock to undress him completely. As Sherlock grabbed the base of his cock and licked his lips, John felt the piercing eyes stare straight into his soul. Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock lowered gracefully and licked a wide stripe from the base of his cock to the tip, circling his head before taking it into his mouth.
"You're not here to sell anything or you would have said so by now. You show no signs of distress or unease, which tells me you are unlikely to be here for a case. Irrelevant," Sherlock stalked off towards the sofa, disappointment clear in the way he threw himself back in a foetal position.
, and most of them were quite talented. The stories, especially, made him feel shy of writing up another blog entry ever again, they were so well-written. And, of course, there was the porn.
From that day on, John couldn't stop thinking about Sherlock. But he wasn't just thinking, he was observing. Sherlock would be proud, except his observations seemed to involuntarily focus on one piece of Sherlock's anatomy at a time. First, it was his hands, those long, graceful fingers deftly playing his instrument, brushing against his own, blunt, shorter ones as John handed him a cup of tea. Then came his neck, the long column of flesh (or marble, he wasn't sure), and the scattered little moles on the left side, just above his collar. Next, his cheekbones, the ridiculous cheekbones that stood out from his alien-looking face, haughty and mysterious. Then, one glorious morning, his arse, tight and round, like ripe fruit, as Sherlock bent over to look for his lockpick set.
I studied him. He was a fine specimen, really. His dusky golden fur covered the top of his body, and his tail was all shining gold. He had the customary grey highlights of a wolf around his face and legs, but instead of grey, those hairs were dark silver, and the rest of him was white. Very clean too, for a wolf; his fur looked silky. The only things differentiating him from, say, a muscular, domesticated wolf-dog was the dark wildness in his glacial blue eyes, and his readiness to bare his fangs.
alone. I leaned up into his kiss, ardent and intoxicating, but all too soon a spike of primal terror struck me and I bolted back.
. It's annoying!” the wolf said petulantly, turning to me and totally unaware of the alarm bells that were now ringing in my head. He’d used wolf terminology, out of context, in front of Sally Donovan – that was never going to be good in the first place, and when she was like this…
“Oh great, now there’s three of them,” Donovan groaned in the background. Lestrade blinked. “Well, Sherlock, it’s got some interesting bits. Will you come?”
“Human body now. Let's mate,” Wolf-John growled in a tone of voice I had never heard before. My heart rate accelerated, and I cursed my transport for making my attraction so damned
I was their caretaker, making sure that the transports to those brains weren’t failing from lack of rest, food, or water. Phoenix was more often than not on his stomach on the rug mapping out clues with a portable whiteboard and assorted markers, Sherlock was usually haunting the hallways between his bedroom and the living room, making a web with graphics, thumbtacks, and a red ball of string.
Interesting. Her affair with Anderson was off for the moment, going by the way she kept pointedly not looking at him and the tightly defensive way she crossed her arms. Maybe her moral code had won out on this argument.
far from famous!” There was absolutely no way this could turn out well – this fucking media circus combined with my socially oblivious Bohemian hermit of a boyfriend would only result in a disaster.
Still, I decided, it didn’t matter. Even if that was true, it only proved that in everyday life John didn’t like wanting me, or at least didn’t want to act on his desire. This only strengthened my resolve to resist.
. In a macabre replay of (apparently) ‘Hansel and Gretel’ from the fairy tales, Moriarty had tracked down a kidnapper with a shoe size and height that was strangely similar to my own, based on the footprints he left. All he left the kids to eat was mercury-poisoned chocolate, and since the boy was older, it meant he was hungrier, meaning he ate more of the mercury and came closer to dying than his sister. On the whole, it was somewhere between an eight and a nine; perfect for me.
“That was months ago, a year even,” John realised. A different kind of blue fire kindled in his eyes now. “Why the hell didn’t you say anything, Sherlock?”
“I want to, you want to, what more consent do we need? Why are you playing so hard to get?” he huffed, annoyed.
“Damn my leg!” he shouted. “I’m going to get you two home safe if it’s the last fucking thing I do.” Phoenix nodded and capped his pen, tucking it into his pocket.
“I know, I know,” he murmured. “I know, love. I didn’t want to lose you either. The only way you could lose me is by sending me away yourself, and even then I think the wolf would have some protestations.”
Suddenly I crashed back into myself, staring into a startled Sherlock’s iridescent eyes as I gave him a quick kiss and curled protectively around him. I took in the scene: Skye, standing at one end of the room, his eyes a luminous electric blue; and Kitty in the centre, frozen and enveloped in shadows.
“And, John,” he gripped my shoulders tightly, fixing me with iridescent, earnest eyes; “I’m very sorry for not being there during the full moon. I wanted to, but my stupid overbearing fool of a brother kept me tied up until after the funeral.”
I relaxed, and so did he. Sometimes I forgot that the likes of Donovan and Anderson called him a freak, but at times like this I found it in myself to wonder why. He was abrasive, sure, and could be a stroppy toddler when he wanted to be, but he did have a heart, contrary to their claims. “Look, it’s not like I want to be suicidal, Sherlock. But I wouldn’t have a choice if you hadn’t agreed to this. So… thank you.”
“No thanks,” said our favourite DI, if only for the fact that he didn’t insult Sherlock maliciously. “Just dropping by to run a case by you. I’ve had coffee too.”
With that, the older Holmes laid out his case. Someone had been leaking data that really shouldn’t have been leaked – not to Wikileaks, which would’ve been embarrassing enough, but to some people who could use said data to wreak havoc that Mycroft really wouldn’t want to have to clean up. “No state secrets, of course,” he concluded. “However, it is enough to need to be taken care of, as soon as possible.”
Occasionally Phoenix would talk to me too, and once, he commented, head resting on his arms on the kitchen table, how alike I was to his missing boyfriend. “You’d like him,” he said; “and he’d like you. You two would force us to work together to solve impossible cases, and we’d be friends.” I didn’t tell him that I thought him a friend already. I wondered what RJ was like.
John tried to convince me to try some of the more – vicious – treatments. When I recalled what those entailed (such as piercing the werewolf’s hands with nails) I shot him down. “I'm not
The indigo-eyed young man had looked to be about twenty-six when I first saw him, but now that I could see the faint, very thin silver streak at his temple I’d put him at thirty, thirty-five, maybe. His platinum blond hair hid the silver very well, sweeping low over the distinct indigo eyes. His skin was a bit red, like he was healing from a sunburn.
“You’re not well,” I protested. “Your arm’s still healing, and either way you can’t walk on that leg –”
He was an intruder. The same feral thing that rose up against Sherlock rose up against this young man, and I growled, “Tell me why I shouldn’t shoot you down right where you stand and hand you over to the police.”
Kitty looked up at him with something in between terror and contempt. “I gave you your opportunity. I wanted to be on your side, remember? You turned me down, so…” She shrugged.
I wanted to scream. Would the judgement be more severe the longer the crime had gone on? “Since at least the pool,” I replied dutifully, staring him straight in the eye and daring him to take the heart I offered so reluctantly and smash it to pieces in front of me.
“Driven Sherlock to the edge of a panic attack for one,” Phoenix replied mildly. “My God, Reyalon, look at him!”
. I wanted help for Rollo, not death to innocent people. But if you’re so intent on dying, by all means. Be my guest. My name is Phoenix Wilde, by the way. Phoenix C. Wilde. If we’re going to be working together, you might as well know my full name.”
When the clock on my mobile flicked to 6:59 PM, I shouted to the boys that I was going out, caught up my coat, and ran down the stairs just in time to see a black car (typical, Mycroft) turn the corner. As it pulled up, I knocked on the window and the driver lowered it. “D’you think the fishing’s good this time of year?”
“Not just Canar werewolves, Savran and Anagorian ones as well,” Reyalon confirmed. “As far as I know they are former Outlanders who found their way to England. The fix here is that someone is paying them as magical mercenaries, and they don’t care. I can’t control them because I don’t have any authority, and even my magic can only go so far.”
to.” His eagerness surprised me. There was almost urgency in his voice. I looked over at Skye for support – after all, he didn’t ask anyone for help on his full moons – but he was gone, and the door was slightly ajar.
For once, Skye let Sherlock take the lead. “You’re not a monster, John,” the detective announced, in much the same way he said anything – with that undertone of ‘It’s obvious’. “You’re John, just…”
“John,” I said again, bolder this time. Skye was there. He was backup, however much I hated backup. Hopefully John’s name would keep the wolf’s attention on me.  “Why do you want to leave?”
She halted in her steps and turned to look at him with surprise and annoyance. “‘Stop it’? What’s your problem today?”
is too complicated to go into), but it was still uncomfortable to think of those dreams as a result.
“But for the ridiculous notion that I would leave you alone when you needed me, you have no objection to let me take care of you during your transformation?” Sherlock queried, looking at me with the put-upon air of having to deal with idiocy, but with a sort of anxiety underneath. Huh?
We busted in, the door no match for our combined strength. Phoenix’s knives flashed and my gun fired, and the two people who’d been guarding the door were down. I looked around, looking for Sherlock. My eyes landed first on a pitiful heap in the corner, crowned with what looked like a mop of mousy hair. Phoenix growled beside me at the sight. And then I found
I toyed with the thought of waking him up and coming on to him, pretending to still be the wild creature of the night who’d fallen asleep here. For all of fifteen seconds. Because the man currently asleep beside me was the most observant one in Europe, if not the world, and there was no way the wolf had no tells, or that he hadn’t documented them by now. He’d see through me, and my hard on wasn’t worth moving out of Baker Street.
“It better pass,” I growled, trying to get him to see the issue. “But the press will turn, Sherlock, they always turn. And they’ll turn on
NOTE: Notice that Aleksandr never addresses Skye as 'Maximilien'. That's because in Russian culture (where I borrowed the nickanming norm from) as I understand it, usually only strangers and acquaintances address a person by given name (usually with the patronymic, but that's not how Canar works). Friends use a chosen diminutive, and family uses a more affectionate form of that diminutive. For Maximilien, that diminutive is 'Maxim'; 'Maximka' is the affectionate form, at least for Skye.
“And not a moment too soon!” Skye chimed in. “There’s Mycroft on the stair. Nickel, nip up the stairs now, there’s a good man. John, Sherlock, I trust I can leave you alone without having to intervene?”
My spirits dampened. Skye’s icy blue eyes looked a bit misty, and I wondered if perhaps his relationship with his brother was a bit more complicated than anyone had let on. In a way, I guess our situations were similar; we loved our siblings but couldn’t reach them anymore. Our jagged edges scraped too much.
memories) and with a raging erection as a consequence of them was very, very awkward and uncomfortable. Thank God that my friend was asleep still and hence unaware of my plight.
.” Skye’s and Sherlock’s voices were dual, inside and outside my head respectively. “What?” I asked out loud.
“I might have persuaded you. Offered an acceptable alternative. But you were surprisingly amenable to it. Really, I wouldn't mind spending a few nights each month ensuring that you don't do anything that you might regret later,” Sherlock said with a half-smile.
In the meantime, Mycroft called with the requested information, and I sent Skye and John on the lead, knowing that John would’ve forced me to stay at home even if I had volunteered to go. I talked to some of my network and got their updates, incorporating them into the stream of information that was starting to look more and more like Jim Moriarty.
I grinned. “For taking away his fun.” The redhead managed a wan smile. “Attaboy,” I said approvingly, clapping his shoulder. “Buck up now, we’re closer, at least.” With that, we walked in comfortable silence until we opened the doors of Tesco.
I already knew which ones had been passing the information around, how many of the group were really werewolves, and which areas those packs of werewolves were based in. What I didn’t know was who the leak was and what the intel was about, so I couldn’t figure out what their target was. I caught up my phone to text my brother, annoyed with his tendency to withhold necessary clues.
.” The younger Holmes rolled his eyes to the ceiling, stressing the word as if exasperated with repetition. Hopefully his brother bought it, but I had faith in Sherlock’s acting abilities.
My anger was roused even more by the fact that he rolled his eyes as though saying in true Sherlock fashion ‘Your angsting is boring. Please move on.’
I watched Skye’s face, waiting for the grim expression to wash over it, but instead his glacial-blue eyes widened, and he froze. Just like
For the next few minutes, all I fully registered were my boyfriend’s wide eyes and Moriarty’s snivelling, my senses reeling in light of this new information. It all made sense, it all made terrible, terrible sense, and my wolf howled with the need to protect,
I had expected that, and prepared accordingly. I had bought some meat earlier, obviously without his knowledge because John would have deduced that I meant to manage his transformations, and stashed it in the fridge behind but separate from the body parts so John wouldn’t find them. A few sausages would make a decent entrée while I cooked the rest. I was adamant on cooking, trying to maintain as much human customs as I could even with John in such a shape.
“How did you know where to go? Even Phoenix isn’t that good,” Sherlock queried. “Did that have something to do with the wolf too?”
“No scent trails. Have you tried –?” Skye broke off and made a hand sign that I was sure meant something neither Sherlock nor I was supposed to know about. Wilde nodded. “Silencing mark.” He peeled down his sleeve and showed Skye something on his wrist that he didn’t let us see.
So this was what Phoenix had held back on telling us. I exchanged a look with Sherlock to the effect of
“I…” I took a breath to clear my lungs. Did confessions always feel like a weight all over your torso? “I was in love with him before you ever showed up, even the littlest bit.”
The mousy-haired shop boy shook his head. “Not Nix’s kind of empath. Not only can he see a person’s entire emotional state and probably how they came to be that way, he can ‘broadcast’ emotions as well. That’s the dangerous part. Empaths like Phoenix were used in the wars, as spies and saboteurs. It’s a category that’s been stigmatised over the years because of the behaviours of the empaths groomed for war. Some of them were taken in childhood and raised to be as close to sociopathic as possible.”
