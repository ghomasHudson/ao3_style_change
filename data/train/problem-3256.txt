“Pie is a good idea,” he said as Gabriel took a pan out of the fridge. He eyed Dean. “We can use the silver forks.”
The atmosphere settled into something muddy. A customer came in, and Dean practically jumped out of his chair to help her. Cas sent him a mean look and stole his chair.
“We did.” Dean leaned forward in his chair. “But, Cas, what if it isn’t? I mean, think about it. Don’t you ever wonder just… what is it with this town? Why are there so many monsters here, and why do hunters like Donna and me keep chasing them here?”
“Good night,” said Castiel and turned to go, playing it cool, as if Dean and him weren’t terrified of new-house anxiety resulting in a sleepless night for all of them.
“Don't you just wish you had a date sometimes?” She asked as she collected change from the register into her hand. “Not even a little bit? Someone to watch crappy romantic movies with, or someone who'll write you notes and hold you while you watch the stars on a rooftop?”
“I tried to call him this morning, but he didn’t pick up. Let me try again,” said Dean. He put in the number and waited.
He was sitting on his bed, his back to the wall, with a book in his one hand. His other hand was wrapped around Dean, who was unconscious and alarmingly close to snoring on his shoulder.
A couple of hours later they were sitting in a line on the prow, feet dangling above the quiet waters, watching the lasts of their remaining crew climb back onto the ship. For a few silent moments, Dean closed his eyes and let himself enjoy the breeze on his face and the sound of crusty sailors cussing each other on the nearest boat.
There was a comfort in another body sleeping in the house, another chest rising and falling, the sound of breathing driving the dead silence of the previous nights out the window. It made falling asleep possible, now.
“Shut up,” he said, elbowing Castiel’s side, smiling. “Come on.” He hopped onto his feet and reached out a hand. Castiel took it, and Dean pulled him up.
Castiel ran a hand through his hair and glanced over the barrel, ducking quickly when a few more gunshots followed his motion. He needed to assess the situation, and he had to do so quickly: the ship was swaying with the movements of the ocean and his egg-shaped cover was sealed, with no way of telling what was inside it. He suspected it might be gunpowder. If so, he had to move away.
“Dean?!” At the sound of his name, he turned to look at the woman on the other side of the room. “Dean, are you alright?!” There was no hesitation in her voice when she called out his name. She knew him- even with the long hair he’d never had, a voice he hadn’t had since at least his mid-teens, and, as he gathered himself, and took inventory of his body, a pair of tits he did
Then Dean leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together, the chair serving to bring them closer to their usual height difference, and Dean breathed slowly with Cas until he finally got his unnecessary breathing under control.
Don't worry, I'm already working on the next chapter, I don't want to leave you guys on a cliffhanger for too long. I know my update schedule is... inconsistent... but seriously, I'm determined to finish this fic, I really want to get to the finish line with you guys, so I'll try to have an update out within the next couple of days.
treated you like shit, jerking your chain all over the place, making and breaking deals with you, and that started back when we were enemies but it shouldn’t have continued as long as it has, now that we’re- I mean I’d almost call us friends but I don’t know if you feel that way too and I wouldn’t want to presume or anything-”
Dean knew Sam wasn’t necessarily intending to sound snide, but he still snarled out a retort, rising out of his seat to glare at his brother. “That wasn’t the same and you know it, any more than when
“No big deal, Cas was able to help me out, weren’t you Cas?” As Dean bumped into him with his shoulder, Cas felt a familiar rush of affection for him.
. Dean was too small- supposed to be a well-muscled man a couple inches taller than him, rather than an athletic woman several inches shorter.
had asked about it, Jack vacillated between embarrassment and fear… so Dean had stopped trying to ask, desperate not to see that look on Jack’s face again.
That… was a lot easier than he expected, and from what he knew about being trans from his occasional investigation into the parts of his own identity he usually ignored, that was a actually pretty good description of the situation. “Uh, yeah, actually. We uh… we weren’t expecting to be
The moment he’d started relaxing into the bed, Dean had turned as if to leave, and it took all of the will that Cas could gather within himself to reach out with the hand of his vessel and grab at Dean’s wrist. Dean turned and caught his eyes, and for a moment Cas lost himself in that gold-green gaze, before he cleared his throat to speak.
“I- I’m back in Eileen’s clothes, so I’m not that comfortable right this minute, but the things Sylvia helped me pick out- they’re all much better.”
“Well I’m glad the two of you were able to figure it out,” said Sam as he slid into the seat across from Dean.
“Not that I can think of. We should check on everyone else, see if Jack-” before Cas could finish the statement, they heard a wail coming from the library. “Jack!”
Dean flushed. “You’ve got a point, man, thanks for pointing it out. I’m not good at keeping quiet when I’m excited.” At this point, Dean flushed more, attempting to hide it behind taking a long sip from his wine glass. Though Cas was curious, he let it go, and enjoyed Dean’s company through the end of the meal.
Rowena shifted to look at Dean with an assessing gaze. After a few moments of giving Cas a run for his money with the way she was intently staring into his eyes, she spoke up. “You might have a point there; it’s one of your most infamous traits and it’s practically absent at the moment.”
“What, about you not being a woman?” Dean’s tense hand on Castiel’s arm belied the flippant tone of his words.
“Is that… is that really how he feels?” Sam swayed there like his strings had been cut. “I didn’t… I didn’t know…”
Jack smiled at Cas and Dean. “I’m so glad you’re my dads. It was like a deal- buy one get one free! I picked Castiel all on my own, and he’s so great that he gave me you, too, Dean!”
“And I repeat! Bull! Shit!” Dean was glad Charlie had advised against getting heels during their shopping trip- his current flat shoes were a bit uncomfortable against the uneven ground outside, but didn’t upset his balance as he grabbed the lapels of Cas’ jacket and leaned in aggressively close. “He was a bigoted piece of shit and you are not responsible for what human monsters do any more than you’re responsible for what demons do!”
Jack burst into tears and fell back into Dean’s embrace, who rubbed his back as he cried, ignoring the tears rolling down his own face. A tentative hand on his shoulder had him look up, to where Castiel stood, shifting from foot to foot. Even in the midst of all these tears, seeing Cas never failed to bring a smile to his face, and he reached out with one hand to pull Cas into the hug with their kid.
Dean flushed crimson, then paled. “You’re my kid sister, Charlie! No matter what kinda craziness people thought at those damn conventions, I don’t go for that!”
Cas’ fingers brushed against Dean’s as he reached for the proffered book, a grateful smile on his face. “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas looked away to hide the flush that spilled over his face at Dean’s gentle caress. He didn’t know if he’d ever get used to how much more tactile Dean had become over the past few days.
My darling readers, I have figured out a plot point to add to this fic specifically to cause you pain. It doesn't show up here just yet, but coming up with the idea is one of the things that helped me break through my writer's block so I could get this chapter all set up for you.
“I’ve never told him before.” Dean put an arm up on the wall of the hallway, leaning his head against it, covering his eyes to hide them from the light and blunt the headache that had grown during his tirade. “I’ve never told him how much I resented him for it. How could I?”
“You’ve gotten so much better at giving hugs, I swear you give the best hugs now,” said Dean, his voice muffled in Cas’ shoulder. Cas continued to smile, and closed his eyes to bask in the physical contact.
The bunker had a very large hot water heater, and he’d spent the past hour in the showers with the water turned as hot as it would go, scrubbing at his skin. Normally, he didn’t need to use mundane methods to clean himself, but the creeping sensation had become a terrible itch under his skin and his grace had been completely ineffective at addressing that itch, so he’d tried showering instead; even with the constant humming of his grace healing minor injuries inflicted on his vessel, its skin was now splotchy and red, with angry lines where he’d dragged his fingernails, trying to reduce or even just change the discomfort he felt.
The panties were a deep rosy pink, and as he pulled them up his legs he hummed with pleasure at the sensation of the silky material against his skin. The moment he’d pulled them all the way on, he turned to the matching bra, getting the hooks fastened and then settling his breasts in the cups the way Charlie had shown him. The moment he had both pieces in place, he turned to the mirror.
“I’m not sure. I could… I could go to Heaven, see if anyone else is experiencing these changes…” From the way his hands were anxiously hovering at Dean’s sides, though, it was obvious that Cas was reluctant to go.
Charlie tilted her head. “I would have thought he’d have the easiest time dealing with this whole situation- didn’t you say he’d had female vessels before?”
They find a nice place to watch the sunset together, and Dean starts rummaging in his saddlebags. Cas keeps trying to get his attention, and Dean says, “gimme just a minute, Cas”, and then his hand closes on the little box and he pulls it out-
“I.... I’ll be fine. I’m sure I just need time to adjust- I’ve been on Earth in the same vessel for over a decade, but I’ve had female vessels before so it’s not like this is a new experience for me the way it must be for the rest of you.”
“I think… I think something about the spell is making it easier for me to talk about things I normally wouldn’t have touched with a ten-foot pole.”
Sheepishly, he put back the top he’d been looking at- a plunging top that pretty much seemed like it would only be good for going clubbing, not hanging around the bunker doing research. And even under normal circumstances he never really went clubbing; he wasn’t looking to do that now while he was uncoordinated and didn’t have his usual six feet of bulk backing him up. “Yeah, you’ve got a point there.” As he moved back to the pile of clothes they’d already grabbed, intending to put back some of what they’d picked up, she put a hand on his arm and stopped him. “What?”
Dean chuckled as he shrugged into his shirt. “Nah, you know how I feel about running when nothing’s chasing me. It’s just a phrase referring to watching a bunch of movies back to back. Charlie suggested Lord of the Rings.”
“But it’s because Dean wants to help me be a kid, and it’s because I cast a spell, of course it’s my fault!”
Startled, Cas and Dean looked up. As Dean had spoken, they’d stopped looking at Jack, and had almost forgotten he was there- it was as if Dean had just been talking to Cas the whole time. Jack was curled up even tighter around his bear, his face screwed up in anguish, tears streaming down his face.
The intense disconnect he felt from his vessel was a relief. He was still tethered to it, he knew; still puppeting it around as a way to protect those he loved from the cosmic might of his raw, uncontained grace; but he no longer felt the weight of its flesh around him.
Dean mostly owning the garage goes a long way in making him feel like more of an equal partner in the relationship. It doesn’t take long for him to realize that if they’d gotten together when they’d first had the arrangement, the disparity in their socioeconomic situations would have eventually come between them, but having such a key role in the garage kept Dean from feeling like a gold digger or a kept man. And it definitely doesn’t hurt that Cas loves to come home from the office to find Dean there, dirty from the shop, grease streaked across his forehead and ground into the calluses on his hands.
Dean glared daggers at her briefly- they hadn’t really talked about it, but he had an idea what she was alluding to, and it wasn’t the time for that. “It’s Cas! He-”
it doesn’t take long for Dean to realize how ready he is to be married to Cas. He gets the ring, and it sits in his saddlebags for a while, because after Lisa found the ring he’d gotten for her, he didn’t want Cas to find it on accident. Eventually he and Cas start talking about taking a ride along the PCH, and as Dean packs his saddlebags he knows just how he wants to propose.
Cas was glad that Dean seemed to know what to do: he reached out to Jack, who fell into his arms, sobbing. Cas held onto Dean and offered what comfort he could.
“Still, Dean…” Sam’s eyes darted back and forth, never landing on Dean’s face for long. “I always knew you did a lot for me, I never meant to be ungrateful.”
“We?” Asked Balthazar’s ever-skeptic voice from a place that wasn’t Dean’s eyes. He noticed the rest of them now, from the corners of his eyes – all clutching their swords inside the sheaths, ready to jump at Dean’s order.
“How do you lift off a curse?” Dean asked desperately. Cas dove into the ocean, coming back up after a few moments with an uprooted seaweed, and spat it at Dean.
He could understand the mistrust towards him. But it was a treacherous decision of Dean to trust the disloyal. Castiel wasn’t sure why it bothered him.
“There might be a spider in there,” Dean said, approaching them on his crutches. “And... it might still be alive.” He stopped and examined their faces. “What were you talking about?”
he wanted to say, watching the familiar landscape of the old house. Pictures on the walls. Rugs on the floor.
This wasn’t accurate. When April had pointed at Dean and blamed him for stealing her boyfriend, they didn’t even know each other. Dean had gone into the other room to see who she was talking about and found Cas, not particularly concerned. He’d apologized, said the rumors would pass. That was when Dean suggested that instead of playing into her hands and panicking about what people would say, maybe they should to go with it.
He spun around, leaning against the storage room doorframe, looking at Dean innocently, as if it was okay to take someone’s heart and then cheat them at Sock Slide.
Or maybe he was wrong. Maybe Dean would cut his fingers off. Maybe he was as crazy as Castiel first believed him to be – crazy, or driven by avarice.
“In the context of dating,” Castiel clarified dryly. “I have no desire to spend my Friday nights barfing into the toilet of this club or the other.”
Dean’s throat felt dry. He swallowed. “I know you told me not to talk about it. I just... I know how it is to lose a parent.”
A few moments later, they came back down the stairs rigidly, the boxes all forgotten on the floor upstairs. They walked into the living room silently, in shock. Castiel couldn’t find it within himself to open his mouth and have it make sounds. But then Gabriel elbowed his side, eyeing the entrance to the kitchen, and Castiel followed his stare. There, touching their brother’s arm, leaning in and laughing at something he was saying, was Michael’s wife.
“You’re easy,” the man smirked. Castiel didn’t quite know what he was smiling about – they were both empty handed now; but he skipped over the mess on the floor with a “see ya!”, leaving Castiel to grouch alone in the dark room.
“Of course not.” He recalled the day Dean joined SPN High, sat beside him after trying all the other chairs in the room. How aloof he’d been to the friendly, curious stranger. He really had no idea that this stranger would turn his life upside down, and that he’d do the same for Dean.
He woke up in the middle of the night to light footsteps approaching the bed. Dean was breathing heavily next to him, unconscious.
As if nothing happened. Their crowd seemed to be just as surprised at Dean’s behavior as Castiel himself, but no one said anything.
“I dropped out.” Dean let it out like a breath he’d been holding. “At the end of junior year. My dad died over the summer, and I just couldn’t go back. I couldn’t go through a whole year of school and provide for my brother at the same time. So I moved away,” he let out another breath and rubbed a hand at his forehead. “And lied on my resume to get someone to hire me.”
“Nothing to talk about,” said Dean. “You left, Sammy left, and I got my leg back, all in one week. I needed something to do. So, this worked out great.”
“I know,” said Dean. “I remember. Most of it.” He looked down at the pillowcase that covered his clothes, and ripped it off.
“Come with me, young one,” he said, and reached a hand to Dean. Dean glanced at Castiel, and went with him. Mr. Man led him to the king.
“If shoving his tongue in my mouth counts any,” Castiel muttered, crossing his hands over his chest.
“Come on,” Meg urged. She looked absolutely thrilled to play: eyebrows pulled down, hands crossed against her chest, every word an angry bark.
People were walking around, from one class to another, or to the library or cafeteria. Life was going on, as it did when it left any person behind.
He knew fairy tales about cursed creatures that were turned human again once the curse has left them. If Cas and him were mythical creatures, it was more than likely that the answer was hidden in the ending of one of the legends.
Dean grinned. “A humbling experience for you, Lord Assbutt.” He looked at the two that stood behind Castiel, raising his eyebrow slightly. From the corner of his eye, Castiel caught the shoulder of the tall one rising into a shrug.
“Of course,” said Chuck. “But, you know, you can’t control how the story ends. Life goes on. Other fish in the sea and all that.”
Finally, when Cas didn't move, didn't stop looking at him with this intense look that set his heart on fire - Dean shuffled his feet on the floor. "Guess it worked out pretty well for you, then, that he couldn't forget about you either."
“How… How did you end up on a military ship, getting shot at by five men, before you jumped onto the Impala?” Dean asked, but it was weak and halfhearted. His stare was skipping around the room, eyeing his men’s drawn out weapons.
“Because…” Dean scratched his head. “I… I get snacky. And, you know, they only let you buy one meal per ticket.”
“I don’t have a plan,” he called after a few minutes of running, hearing a ruckus of shouts and hurried steps below them. Dean’s lot must have recovered and resumed the chase. The muscles in his legs were beginning to burn.
But Cas’ lips curved up into the shadow of a smile (he didn’t really smile, ever). “You’re not going to Balthazar’s party this year?”
“Jesus, Jo, no.” Dean rubbed his eyes again. The overwhelming clutter in his mind clashed with the one in his room; he couldn’t think.
“Bobby Singer sent me,” said Garth, slow and perplexed in his own way. Trying to work something out in his brain, it seemed, just as Castiel was. “Emergency contact. For emergencies.” His attention was drawn away, then, by Dean who came to stand at the door, holding Claire. “Hey. You’re not broken up,” he said. “Or dead. Or in prison. I guess no one wins the bet.”
“Yeah.” Dean fingered the necklace Sammy had given him, hidden under his shirt. The kid picked up clues fast, especially after Dean had told him what their dad really did a month ago.
“When do you think we’ll meet ours?” Sammy asked, grabbing his left wrist and twisting his arm to take a closer look at the words.
“You don’t know that!” Sammy looked like he was on the verge of tears, but instead he surged forward and wrapped his arms around Dean. “I don’t wanna lose you.”
Dean sighed with relief internally. He didn’t love lying to his brother, but if it kept him in the dark about stuff that goes bump in the night and takes your personality, then it would be fine. They would be fine. He would keep hunting, and Sammy would keep pretending that he thought their dad was a mechanic, and it would all be okay.
He knew his father was wrong by the inhuman gleam he saw in his eyes, just for a split second. He knew it as John clapped him on the back, a spray of red on skin, and he knew it that night, when all he wanted to do was throw up.
“They’re probably a giant nerd, like you,” said Dean, earning a punch in the shoulder. “Perdition. It means damnation, I looked it up.”
“I didn’t want to make you more scared of the dark than you already were,” Dean replied gruffly. “Besides, it’s not like I did anything most of the time. I sat in the car a lot. It was boring.”
Dean shoved the door open, then stood over his father, heart in his throat. Sammy, arms around Dean’s waist, looked past him, then let go and knelt next to John, lifting his shirt to check his injuries. Dean covered his mouth as Sammy sat back, feeling nauseous. Long, deep scratches oozing blood and yellow fluid were scratched over John’s torso, like trails left by long claws (maybe they had been… Dean really didn’t want to think about what could’ve done that.) The skin around them was purple, an unnatural shade, and seemed to be pulsing.
The fire seemed to have sucked all the color out of the world, like it had burned so bright that when it went out, nothing was left. Like it had eaten happiness and vibrancy instead of just oxygen. Like it had taken something more intangible than the Winchester’s home, and Mary.
It was about a year later than Dean learned about another of the universe’s tricks, and it was a lot less sweet than soulmates.
He shook his head. He couldn’t remember Mary ever talking about anyone being killed, except for one time when the news blared louder than usual and she had looked very sad.
Before, Mary would read to Sammy in her smooth, soft voice, and Dean would listen in, crawling right up against her side and staring at the squiggles on the page until they started to make sense. He wondered if reading made him smarter, too, especially since he seemed to listen more than Sammy, who fell asleep a lot and drooled all over Mary’s shirts. She would read stories about King Arthur and his knights, and Dean and Sammy would listen. After a while, she let Dean read some of the words, and then sentences, until he could read the whole story of Lancelot to Sammy all by himself.
“No, Dean… we can’t bring him there,” Sammy replied quietly, trembling. “I don’t think they can help him. We should call Bobby.”
This time, Dean was quicker with his hand. “I said, shut up! If he hears you, he’ll be mad at both of us.”
John Winchester was wrong. Dean knew it the first time his father brought him along on a hunt, a gun cold in his shaky hands, when he pulled the trigger and watched the girl— the vampire— stumble back, blood seeping out between her fingers and spreading dark across her blouse. He knew it as his hands slammed into his chest, pushed back by the firearm’s recoil, and he knew it as John stepped out of the shadows and neatly sliced off the vamp’s head. The body thumped down as if in slow motion, and the head thudded down a second later.
John opened his mouth to protest as Dean clambered up onto his mother’s hospital bed and peered down at his baby brother. Mary pointed at the little red arm.
“Perdition, honey.” Mary hid the furrow in her eyebrows that always appeared when Dean mentioned his words. Knowing what she knew about Hell, and everything… she didn’t like words like that on any of her boys. She’d have to keep them safe— Dean, John, and now the baby.
“Of course it is,” he replied. “I mean, who else would we name him after? My deadbeat dad? No way. I love
A tentative shuffle from behind was his warning before Jack ducked under his arm, his conversation with Dean over. “She might need help,” he said quietly. “I didn’t use a specific spell, I was trying to… put together a whole new spell. That can be a lot harder to unravel.”
Cas gave one of his soft smiles and took Dean’s offer of assistance rising to his feet. “Thank you, Dean. I admit, I feel a bit disoriented, but there doesn’t seem to be anything actually wrong with me at present. Aside from…” Cas glanced down at his form, mostly obscured by the suit that was too large even on a normal day, but still showed hints of curves as he moved now. “Aside from this unexpected change. But I’ve had a female vessel before, so I should be fine.”
Jack had been reticent about it the entire time. It’d driven Dean a bit crazy, wondering what he’d missed about his kid over the past couple of months he’d said he’d been researching this on his own. But every time anyone had tried asking Jack about it, he’d brushed it off. And when
“Try three!” Dean’s eyes sparked with frustration and his hair frizzed around his face and his chest heaved and his vision narrowed and he didn’t want to be having this conversation but he felt so small and weak right now because he didn’t understand his body anymore and his back was stiff from sitting in an awkward position for too long and his head throbbed with pain from not sleeping enough, and “over thirty freaking years I’ve been doing this, Sam, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep this shit up!”
”So I said yes. And by the time we’d made it back to Vegas, I loved you, was well on my way to being in love with you, but I couldn’t... I couldn’t
Dean’s callused but dainty hand ruffled Jack’s hair, who scowled at him. “We could always call Charlie? And I bet she’d get a kick out of this!” Dean grinned, and Cas breathed a silent sigh of relief; that was the first expression he’d seen on Dean’s face that looked completely and totally right on his face.
“Cas, I’m fine.” There was a charge in the air that he recognized, the same charge that happened whenever he and Cas stood this close for this long, and normally he’d have been looking for an excuse to turn away, to disrupt the moment, but he was feeling bold and alive and lighter than he ever has before. “I’m here, I’m safe. You saved me.”
Flushing and rubbing his hand behind his head, Dean chuckled sheepishly. “You know, yeah, his family really is pretty conservative, but we kinda keep forgetting that we don’t have to worry about them so much anymore.” It amazed Dean how easily it was to talk about this, how none of what he was saying was a lie and yet could be taken to mean something that the person next to him would understand and consider relevant for the current situation. “But we all know- his son is with my sister in another section, my brother and his girlfriend are back home waiting for us- all my family are onboard, his family is just a bag of dicks.”
was what Dean would have responded with, hadn’t he turned around and found himself face to face with Castiel.
“But I'm not willing to let go.” He shook his head and dropped his hands to look at Castiel. “I'm not.”
Well – maybe he was right. Dean might’ve been practicing sock art during the last couple of Castiel’s studying sessions. But it didn’t change the fact that him simply being there helped Castiel study. Him making five hundred coffee cups to get them through civics. Him asking questions about things he didn’t understand. Him practically dragging Castiel from his books when it got late.
Another set of hands found him immediately; waist, chest, up to his face, and sinking into his hair. He fell into the kiss.
“No,” the voice answered. Dean turned around to find himself standing, barefoot and red handed, in front of his sister’s roommate. “This is Castiel.”
“No, they aren’t. Now, go to sleep. You don’t want to be tired on your first day of new kindergarten.”
“Wow. You’re legitimately upset. It could’ve been sweet if you words weren’t hurtful.” He zipped his bag open and took a spare gym shirt out to clean his face. “I’m a pushover.”
Dean sighed, gritting his teeth. “If you tell anyone about this I will use cafeteria forks to impale you,” he warned, raising a finger threateningly. Castiel nodded keenly.
Castiel nodded slowly. He took that in: they were a team. He’d never thought of this before he met Dean: people could be a team if there wasn’t a ball or sweating involved. People could be a team if they were for one another, and if they had each other’s back no matter what. Just like Dean had asked of him four months ago, on the floor of his apartment:
Dean’s chin lifted a touch. “Actually, I do.” Here was one thing no one could take from him: he knew his way around his yummy treats. “I can list you every kind of pie to ever exist. Alphabetically.”
Castiel shook the moment away and browsed the delivery menu. Pizzas were great. Even these pizzas looked pretty great. Even when the titles were
Charlie brightened up. “We have this writing assignment for next week, and Dean’s missing a partner.”
“Hey," he said. Cas looked at him. "You’re still going to Wayward Sisters, right?” He asked, just to know whether there was still a chance he could be a dick and get away with it. But Cas nodded.
“It’s still going to be far away from your college,” Dean argued. “What if we moved closer to there?”
“Dean Winchester.” She said it in a slow, satisfied way that made his stomach sink. Dean didn’t seem to react any better.
He had a feeling in his chest that he hadn’t felt in a while. He almost moved his hand to bump against Cas’, but changed his mind. The light turned green. They started walking. Cas’ hand bumped against his, and he could swear it was on purpose, but when he looked over, Cas was looking away innocently.
In his socks and sweatpants, he tiptoed across the hall until he reached room number twenty-four. He turned the knob slowly, opened the door to a slit… and then, swiftly, flung the door open and shut it behind him, skipping around notebooks and stumbling on piles of clothes.
Castiel shook his head. “I don't think you're a nightmare. I love you. I'm here because I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.”
“Oh. I must have spaced out.” He was pretty sure that was the day Cas showed up with a new haircut. He definitely wasn’t telling her that.
“What’s up?” Charlie asked and hopped up on the counter, swinging her feet. Meg gave her the death glare until she slid back off and leaned her elbows on it, looking past the few customers and out into the street. Her eyes fixed on something to the left.
Castiel pursed his lips. “Your shirt has blood on it. And...” His eyes narrowed. “A little bit of brain?”

The morning routine wasn’t exceptional. Coffee. Yawning. Cursing mornings and everything related to them.
For one dreadful moment, it occurred to him that he might be barking at an innocent stranger who had just happened to walk out after him. But the steps were too heavy, too deliberate not to be chasing him.
Something lit up in Dean’s eyes – his own profound curiosity sparking up. “I don’t know,” he said. “But I’ve been thinking...” He sighed. “Don’t give me The Look again.” He waited until Castiel nodded to continue. “Before I left, I... I got this feeling. A hunch about this town, all the monsters who seem to be drawn here.”
“I’ve thought about it, and it’s not very economical,” he answered. “I’m paying double rent now.” He nodded at a bus that was making its way down the street. “That’s me.”
“Wouldn’t you even consider it?” Henry insisted. “You don’t know what’s out there. You don’t know what you could do.”
He hesitated. “I don’t know.” He wanted to ask about Mary, but something stopped him. He didn’t want to make Dean any sadder than he already was. And, except, they had a lifetime to talk about the hard things. At least for today, he wanted to be the reason Dean’s face lit up, not the source of his unhappiness. “You can go again.”
“We’ll discuss it in the morning,” Dean muttered. He turned over, put an arm over Claire and Timothy and sank into sleep again.
His project was standing proudly in an isolated corner of the hall. People came and went, and he stood next to his creation awkwardly and smiled at stray guests, explaining his thesis when asked. This wasn’t exactly how he’d imagined this moment – for example, he didn’t feel particularly proud, and there weren’t any roses thrown at him or applause in the background – but he was happy with his share, until a voice behind him stopped his excitement short.
After dinner, Sam volunteered to wash the dishes. Dean started following him to the sink, but Castiel stopped him.
The rest of the ride went by quietly. But finally, when they got to New York, they all seemed to forget about everything that’s been on their minds. They walked into the storage container with a sense of intrigue and wonder.
The pieces were falling into place slowly: he was in Dean’s bed, their clothes scattered on the floor, and the events of the previous night were beginning to come back to him.
Charlie shifted to look at the whiteboard, taking notes. Dean tried to concentrate on his teacher’s words. He had no idea what she was saying – he didn’t know whether that was because he’d missed two weeks’ worth of classes or because this class required an interest in literature that he just lacked.
“Alright,” said Castiel. “No more questions.” He grabbed Dean’s arm and showed him to the desk, closer to Meg than to anyone else. A safe space. Or, for the least, safer.
“He was trying to learn from experience. This wasn’t the first time someone was about to be shunned from the family.”
“You’re a disaster,” Charlie was saying, and Dean tried to focus on her instead of letting his mind carry off and away with the rain again.
Dean clenched his teeth. Takeoff was doing things to his stomach. "No way," he whispered back. "It's literally Satan's child. There's no way it's got good in it, and even if it did, we can't take that risk. We have to find it and kill it before it gets the chance to hurt more people." He threw a look at the back of the plane. Claire seemed to be teaching Jack how to make a braid using the hair of a person sleeping on the row before them.
He couldn’t get away from it, no matter where he went. His dorm room, his house, the open roads. It was him. It was in him. He was a breathing testament to – to someone who wasn’t there. His ring. His note. His chest. His fingertips, his face, his hair. Everywhere Dean ever touched, so alive it hurt.
“A lot of people make it just fine without a college degree,” said Dean, but it came out much weaker than he’d probably intended.
“Okay, um, I’ll- I’ll see you,” Dean stammered at the door, letting go of his hand, only to pull him into a last quick kiss.
“We can save him for next time we get to shore. Crowley always knows a place to take care of ‘em. Now, can we get a move on? Jo’s hungry, and I could really go for a steak right now.”
The blackout lasts three more days – the wind had knocked some pole down, and the entire street lost power. By the time the power is up again, Castiel has given up any hope of contacting Dean before he’s left the city. At this point, it doesn’t matter whether Dean wrote a stupid love song about him or not. He’s going to be out of town for months, and what kind of relationship could they have had with Dean always being away and busy, and Castiel always being right there, thinking about him?
"Look at this," Dean snorted. He touched Castiel's elbow and pointed at something inside. It was a game booth with an air rifle and a wall of lined-up black cans of Coke Zero. "Even the coke cans are themed."
He took a step around the corner into the storage room – and bumped into a pile of books. Some slid onto the floor with a thump.
He didn’t say anything when Dean came to sit beside him – just leaned his head on Dean’s shoulder and let out a quiet sigh. And this was enough. This was good enough, in the best possible sense.
“No,” he said. “No, I’m going back home tonight.” He wasn't going to leave that place for a minute longer than he had to, if there was a chance Dean was coming back to it – hurt, or needing him, or just plain coming back home.
Dean smiled, his chest puffing as it did when he was proud. He caught a fish of his own and pulled it out, throwing it over to two guys called Ed and Harry, who seemed like they were about to throw up as they were beheading, skinning and gutting the fish.
“Even if I can give you Dean Winchester?” He asked before she could hang up. He watched Dean’s eyes widen and lock on the phone.
“Well,” Castiel straightened his back. His intense stare, not leaving Dean’s eye for a single moment, was as intimidating as it was oddly intimate. “I happened to hear,” he said, “a few days ago, from my dear friend Charlie, that she stole someone’s sandwich. And…” he tilted his head. “That that someone might be coming after her. She told me to keep an eye.” He said the last part of the sentence while squinting, as if emphasizing the words.
"It's alright," said Jack, although there was a quiver in his voice. There was the sound of feet shuffling on the floor.
“I was trying to help you dodge a bullet back there,” he said while they were walking to the bus. It was dark now, and students around them were wobbling onward in threes and fours, drunk from weariness.
“That’s very good,” said Dr. Hanscum. “Now, to get back to you for a moment, Dean. Are you very interested in pagan rituals?”
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I should have been clearer. When I said I wanted to go together, I meant as a date.”
“You’re an odd one, y’know,” Dean said perkily as he sat down beside Castiel, resting a bandage and a bottle of iodine on the floor between them. “Gimme your arm.”
“I don’t got it,” he said. He looked behind him and stepped closer, his voice dropping in volume. “Say, that thing about Cas killing his brother… Is it true?”
“How do you turn these stupid things off?” Dean asked and gestured at the Christmas lights as Cas headed out through the back to throw out the trash.
“Agh,” Gabriel pinched the bridge of his nose. “Mental image. Has he started prying for information yet?”
He fumbled for his phone frantically, but he couldn’t find it anywhere. Carefully, he extracted his arm from Dean’s hold and stood up stiffly, wobbling a little bit. He felt for his phone in the dark and found it on the kitchen table.
“I know,” said the nurse. Her tone was sympathetic. “Still, you were right next to the car when the truck hit it. You're lucky the angle left you untouched." She smiled at him. "Almost a miracle." She looked through some papers. “You're all right. Just a little shocked.” She didn’t look much older than him.
They spent the rest of the afternoon frosting cookies. Cas’ were decent, all winter things, like snowflakes, and presents, and gingerbread men. Dean’s were all Shrek faces. And they looked quite horrendous, since he had no art skills.
“But you do,” said Castiel. “You had nothing, and somehow you managed to rent an apartment, support your family and successfully lie to everyone you know about your identity to protect what you have.”
Dean went back to staring at his notebook. Maybe he needed to read in order to write like Charlie did, or like Naomi wanted him to, but not for this poem. He gripped his pen harder, trying not to get distracted.
Meg’s out-of-the-blue offer had taken him aback. He’d thought he knew what she was like – mean, and critical, and then mean some more.
One of those people, that when they go away, they leave the people behind them in pieces. Like a tiny, tiny hole in the universe, just because of the way they were, just because of the way they smiled.
He stood up clumsily, tripping over the blanket. Staggering into his underpants, he looked back at Castiel.
“Which Richard?” Dean asked. He looked at the clock. One fifteen. Lunchtime. He could take a break soon.
“Why are you smiling like this?” She grimaced at him, and then at her drink. “Holy hell, why is it pink?”
He stopped himself just in time. Everyone froze. Everyone stared at Dean, who wore a perfectly blank expression, realizing his mistake a moment too late. Meg’s jaw tightened, and she looked at the two phones beside her on the table. Then she looked at Castiel.
“Ah,” said the other man. He went and leaned on one of the counters to Castiel’s side. “You came to the right place, then. That guy behind the ovens has got the most amazing ass. Just wait for him to turn around.” He took a glance at Castiel, and, seeing his unamused expression, cleared his throat. “I'm... Kidding. Kind of.”
But Sam wasn't picking up, and Dean started to bite his lip nervously. “I’m sure this isn’t a bad sign,” he mumbled when their eyes locked. After a moment, his back straightened.
“I’m already going to jail, ain’t I?” The man shoved another breadstick into his mouth. “At least I’ll sit there with a full stomach.” His voice was muffled by the salty delights that filled his mouth.
“What? Cas, no, I would never cut your fucking finger off. God, you’re such a fuckin’ party pooper, you know that?”
Charlie left, and he got into bed feeling like a traitor. Feeling like a traitor for even considering it.
“I talked to Meg, then I saw someone kill a vampire, then Meg kicked another vampire in the nuts – I just killed him, he’s right there, and, uh, what are those red eyed things again?”
to know him personally. He didn’t know a person who he hadn’t had that effect on. And there were other things: its human nuances, the way it seemed to understand Dean perfectly, its protectiveness, and the mysterious circumstances of its existence – last time Dean checked, sea monsters were just a myth.
In the morning they set up the house: devil’s traps and angel protection, hoax bags and spells and everything a hunters’ house needed. When that was done, they moved on to unpacking the living room. Dean sat down in between boxes and started pulling things out.
The first sign stood on the road at the front of the church, wonderfully black and shiny, undamaged.
“I mean, things will work out with my family.” He slid onto the high chair and crossed his arms. “But they won’t be okay for me about...” Well, if it was about to get awkward, at least it wouldn’t be awkward for much longer. He was moving away by summertime. It was the only thing that gave him the courage to talk. “About us.” The word made him cringe. Us.
"Thank god," Dean muttered, but then there was rocking and pulling down in angles that didn't feel right.
"Alright. Straight to business." He looked at Cas through the glass and pressed his lips together to stop himself from smiling. He didn't have a lot to look forward to except for Cas' visits these days. It was good to see his face. "What's new?"
Naomi lowered her voice. “I know you want everyone to think you’re a tough guy, but I’ve seen how hard you work. I’ve seen how much you care. And I know you’ll do yourself a favor and write this assignment, whether you like it or not.” She said that and walked off with her chin raised.
“Yeah.” Cas shoved his hands into his pockets. "Unless..." He shuffled his feet. Looked at the pavement. Looked at Dean. “Unless you want to share a waffle? I mean, it is a
“Exactly,” said Bobby. He traced the lines of the street in the picture, mumbling words in an effort to recall.
“What the fuck?” He whispered, horror stricken. “What the fuck?” Instinctively, he flinched away from the tail, but it followed him and continued his movement. It supported him and balanced the upper part of his body. "What the
Castiel stepped forward and grabbed the rifle. He squinted at the replaced cans. He imagined they were a wife-killing shapeshifter. He exhaled. Then he took ten shots.
“I always make the wrong choices,” said Cas. “They’re either too smelly, or a demon, or really into soup, or have a collection of turtle lamps. I’m sick of making horrible dating choices.”
That was a strange thing to say, since Dean didn’t have many things now, either. After a moment, he added, “I think my dad had a storage unit somewhere that had some of our childhood stuff.” His expression changed into a smirk. “I bet Sam would want his spelling bee trophies back. Hey, look. An empty picture frame.” He dug the frame out of a drawer in Castiel’s desk. “Do you think we should put a really cheesy picture of us in it and then display it in the house so that everyone who comes in will think we’re a gross, annoying couple?”
Charlie pointed at him. “Keep him,” she said to Dean. And then, with a tight hug to each of them, she was gone.
Dean shot a glace to his right from the corner of his eye. He thought he saw Cas shooting a glance back. Smiling.
And then, as if he could read Dean’s mind, he gave a half smile and said, “Everything else we’ve ever done was a disaster. It didn’t stop us from doing it.”
They both turned to stare at Dean then, but he didn’t look at them. Castiel was walking down the pier, his motions reserved. When he saw Dean, his eyes lit up. Dean’s jaw dropped.
“See you,” he said. Then he glanced at the dark street around them, and quickly sneak-kissed Castiel’s cheek. He flashed a smile at him and got into the car. Castiel waited on the sidewalk until the old Impala was out of sight.
“Uhh…” He answered. The child didn’t look away. “Are you waiting for your parents?” He asked, although no one was there. Still, he could hope. Children creeped him out. Or maybe it was just this child that was particularly creepy.
“Coulda just said no, Mr. Grumpy,” Dean muttered. He placed his sword at the base of the old lock. Castiel’s hand slid to touch the hilt of his blade. Dean heaved his sword upwards.
“Hey, you aren't supposed to eavesdrop,” Castiel pointed at him. “Look, Meg,” he lowered his voice. “I didn’t want to do this, but I think that guy might be a... vampire.”
Maybe it was the rain. Maybe it was that Dean kept smiling, or that they never did this type of thing. He pulled Dean closer and kissed him and he could feel Dean’s breath when he said,
“Eh... I’ve been busy,” said Bobby and grabbed a spoon. “I should get back to the stove or we’ll be eating burnt goo for dinner.”
And Chuck must have sensed something was off about that, he must have – because he said, “Great. I’ll call everyone else,” which was a pretty generous offer, considering Castiel had been the one to suggest a family dinner in the first place.
Cas called every night. Things were moving slowly. He found leads that turned out to be meaningless. He had run-ins with demons that didn't tell him anything. Weeks passed, and he started talking about missing home, and Dean pretended it didn't make him grouchy.
He left the room making sure his brother didn’t suspect for a minute he didn’t believe his own words.
Castiel walked over and rested a hand on his shoulder. “It’s not exactly the kind of thing you just shake off,” he said gently.
“Clarence, we need you to settle this,” Meg said beside him. And then she said something else. He wasn’t listening; the diversion of his own thoughts was like a bubble around him.
“…But maybe good enough,” Castiel added, watching him. Dean looked up, and faked a smile, and patted his shoulder.
“That’s right,” Dean said, grabbing his sunglasses and putting them on in slow motion. “We’re going undercover.”
. Can you imagine some old Greek dude just like… Walkin’ down the street, like, ‘hey, fuck off. Yeah, you. Stop fucking stealin’ my wheat.’ And the other dude would just straight up flip him off like he’s some twenty-first century teenager with a Starbucks cup?”
But they would be loved. No, Sam wouldn’t make for a bad ruler. He’s got everything it takes: patience and composure, humility and diligence.
The lawn they were stepping onto was feral for a friendly neighborhood house, and littered with pieces of brain and ketchup. They climbed up the stairs leading to the haunted house and nudged the front door open. It creaked.
The second time he woke up, it was actually morning. Something was nudging his arm, and something else was saying: "Cas. Cas. Cas." He turned around to see Dean, still half asleep beside him, poking him. "Wake up, you butt."
“For what it’s worth – I hope you find him alright.” The sentiment in Benny’s voice was genuine. Castiel recalled the first time Dean had mentioned him – how the first thing he’d said was
The address Cas had given them led them to a big warehouse in the middle of nowhere. Its metals screeched in the wind. Dean opened the trunk and got an angel blade and a shotgun out of it, just in case. Then he took Sam's amulet off his neck and handed it to Claire.
In the end, the Flood came before Cas did. They made for a hasty departure, just like John had promised, and as the water covered the earth and engulfed ordinary life, no one looked back. No one except Dean.
“It was complicated then,” he told her. His voice was soft, protective of himself and of Cas and of everything that was and had been between them. “His dad had just died, Sam ran away from home. We had a lot of crap to deal with.”
Cas – having, of course, stayed – nodded in agreement and appraised Dean with his own, quieter, stare. Dean’s heart took a moment to flail at the knowledge that Cas didn’t disagree with the assertion that he was handsome.
In the gathering hall, on the first night of every month, the king held a council meeting with his advisers.
“I’m not going to flick you. I’m a pro. I didn’t flick you once before, and we were doing this for like, two hours.”
That was easier than he'd expected. But he'll take it. He turned away and got into the car. Shut the door. Turned the key. Then the door on the passenger side opened, and Claire got inside.
His phone buzzes. He takes a look at it, pushes the home button, but nothing happens. He presses his finger to the on button for a while, and the screen comes to life.
“Maybe not,” Cas said. He shoved the hat into Dean’s hand and looked back at their snowman. Dean swallowed, and looked away so that Cas wouldn’t catch him staring. But he couldn’t focus on anything, anymore, apart from the notion that all at once, his heart wasn’t his.
“The mountains,” Sam explained, only barely masking the annoyance in his voice. “That bottle of whiskey doesn’t look too good on you, you know.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Mr. Man run for the gun. He was a second too late: Castiel pulled Dean’s hand, and Dean followed him. They ran to the drinks table, and Castiel straight up flipped it over to become a shield they could duck behind.
“What kind of prom is it if you don’t even get to get drunk?” Dean asked as they took the stairs to his apartment.
“Are you ever afraid of just… exploding?” Cas asked. “As if the next person who touches you, you might snap and do something to them that you’re going to regret?”
Sam’s eyes slid sideways. “Don’t call me a baby.” The curve of his mouth was almost amused. Not resentful. Not angry.
"Sure," he said, rubbing his eyes. He hated mornings. He hated mornings so much, he wanted to sit on them. "You?"
That’s… Well. He didn’t even remember this conversation. But two emails before this one is what he was searching for:
He glanced around and caught Cas’ eyes over a few heads of hair, looking at him reluctantly, lingering on the sweat trickling from Dean’s jaw to his neck almost regretfully, as if he’d been glancing against his own will. He looked away quickly, and Dean’s eyes jumped back to their teacher. He felt all the more disgusting, sinking in the smell of other people’s smelly feet, his face red from the heat, now that he was aware someone’s been looking at him.
“I’ll text you from the car!” He called, raising his voice as he hurried down the stairs. And he couldn’t see Dean anymore, but he still heard him say:
“I paid for this shithole,” said Meg. “Don’t get all righteous on me. Do you know where the instructions for the washing machine are? I can’t find them.”
"I would never kiss my boyfriend with a mouth full of spaghetti,” he said, his voice even and unwavering. “That's just gross."
“I’d like you to evaluate yourself,” she said when he sat down in front of her. Her voice was softer than usual. “How do you think you did this year?”
Castiel let out an evaluating huff. Dean let go of his nose and lightly felt around it, as if testing freezing waters with the tips of his toes. It didn’t look like the game would resume soon.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Crowley made a gesture for him to hurry up. “So was everyone. I’m more interested in any special skills.”
"Come on," Claire said as they were leaving the town. "Where's the lecture? It's nine a.m. There's no way I'm falling asleep if you don't start talking."
He looked up, and Dean was opening his study book with resignation, like he was searching for a way to relieve the tension between them and coming up with nothing.
An awkward silence settled between the three of them while Charlie processed the purchase. Dean couldn’t tell why he felt like something needed to be said to alleviate some invisible tension. He never even hung out with them in public – not with Castiel, neither with his annoying sister. Then Charlie turned to him.
“If I knew you,” Dean said in that “I’m being very patient right now but I’m secretly thinking about ways to accidentally step on you” tone, “I would be avoiding eye contact and letting you pass by, then spending the rest of my evening anxious about whether you saw me harassing strangers.” He held his hands palms-up. “Why did you ask that?”
felt a little too personal. Anna and Meg were right behind them. Dean’s fingers tapped a nervous rhythm on the table.
“Exactly,” Dean smiled, and took a left turn. They were quiet for a moment as they pulled into Dean’s neighborhood.
“Perfect,” he grumbled, hitting his head against the floor. That just made his headache worse. “That’s just wonderful.”
Streetlamps. Bus station. Old, cracked cement on the sidewalks. He focused as hard as he could. But still, he couldn’t push back what was inside: Dean’s cassette tapes, the
“That was amazing,” Dean said, side-eyeing him. “Hey, you don’t really hate my pizza rants that much, do you?”
“What’s stopping you?” She asked dryly, leaning in to get more privacy in the classroom full of students. “The fact that he goes on tons of dates, or you being too busy to tell him because you’re setting him up on all those dates?”
“Yeah. So, anyway." He tapped his fingers on his knee nervously. He wasn't sure they were at a point where changing the subject would be acceptable. "About your birthday.”
He got ready in a messy, hasty blur, hesitating by the door. He wasn’t quite ready to leave, to get back to routine, to a life that wasn’t centered around Dean’s disappearance.
If Castiel had the time to stop and chitchat, he would spit out a sentence along those lines: ‘the greatest mistake a man can make is believing he is the subject of another man’s loyalty when he is not’. But he was in a bit of a rush. So he ran.
“There’s just one thing,” said Dean, and Castiel raised his head to look at him. “The aliens - they got away.”
So they went in with the tape. Dean gave him all the weapons he was carrying before they entered – three pistols, three knives, one dagger, a flask of holy water, and a really sharp stick. He wasn’t sure how the last one was going to help him, but Dean looked him up and down and nodded.
Jack followed her to the kitchen, and Dean started browsing. He wasn't really paying attention to what he was doing. Jack showed up in the living room after a moment with forks and knives in his hands.
“It’s not even really a thing,” said Dean. They stopped at a corner of the shopping center near a fake plant, and Dean's shoe kicked the side of its pot lightly. “More like a thinglet.”
“I mean read,” said Charlie. “You’re sitting ten feet away from a bookstore. Get your ass off the chair and read some poetry. There’s no better way to learn how to do it yourself.”
Castiel took a look at the living room and saw that he was right. “How didn’t you think of that?” He accused.
They looked at each other. They’d planned for what to do if she turned out to be a hunter. They’d planned for what to do if she turned out to be a monster.
He dropped it, even when the lady smiled smugly at him, and spent the rest of the landing trying to find non-suspicious angles to spy on Claire and Jack.
“Something's in your house,” said Dean, “And it will keep killing unless we stop it, quick. Now, can you brief me on the situation?”
“Got it,” he said, trying with all he had to keep his voice emotionless. “Not her. Just anyone who isn’t me.”
He wanted to tell her no. He wanted to deny it. But, God – he was so sick of denials. If he had to deny it to Cas with everything he had, make sure it would never slip out – maybe he could give in to his feelings in one small, insignificant way. It was such an irregular notion, to talk about his feelings like that, he almost felt that doing it was rebelling against the rules of society.
But Castiel hadn’t meant to share something with that man. He hadn’t meant to share anything at all.
He looked around the room nervously. The walls were bare. The desk was made out of heavy wood. “Not thrilled,” he answered.
Five minutes later, Garth was leaving their house with his big goofy grin on his face, saying, “I’ll see you guys at the wedding!”
Dean tried to keep his eyes on the phone; the last thing he wanted to do right now was make eye contact.
“That is weird.” Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed. “Do you think there’s something not-natural going on?”
“Look in the bottom of the closet,” Dean told him. “There should be a sleeping bag under the Guns N’ Roses swimsuits.”
“I can’t explain to you the entire history of supernatural beings in one night,” said Bobby. “Read the Bible on your own time.”
“There was a homosexual couple eating spaghetti in the booth beside us,” said Michael to the rest of them. Castiel didn’t think much of it, until Michael said: “It was disgusting.”
“Dean,” he said, taking Dean’s face with both hands. “I need you to wake up. We don’t have much time. Wake up.”
Dean grimaced at him from across the cafeteria table. “Cas, I know you better than I know the shape of my dog’s butthole. I’ve seen you with girls. You’re doing just fine.”
“Seventeen years ago,” Dean said, slowly, deliberately, and Castiel was starting to get the full picture, the reason Dean was so rattled. This was a haunting-past situation. Seventeen years ago was all the way back to when he was in college and they were living in a no-bedroom apartment.
“Oh,” Cas said, taking in a breath. He rolled over, practically yeeting himself at the wall, and grabbed Dean’s wrist.
They waited a while for Dean’s crew to catch up. The paired up pirates trickled from the crevices, some wounded, some covered with monster blood, all looking different degrees of irritated. Finally, Dean gathered them round and described his plan.
It was dark inside – Castiel didn’t understand how the wood of the deck blocked the sunrays so thoroughly. There were lamps – torches inside a casing of glass fixed into the wall every few feet, and inside the rooms – small, crammy spaces with cots and bags. Dean stopped at the end of a hallway and entered an oblong room, thrice the size of the sleeping rooms. He stood before a long, rectangular table, and turned to Castiel. Charlie and Sam stood at the entrance, almost at the threshold but still inside the room.
She shook her head and took the page from his hand. “’Show your loved one you love them today’,” she read. “’With fifteen percent off each purchase from February first to February fourteenth’. Is this our sale-of-the-month?”
“I won’t let it go!” He yelled. Chuck looked up at him. He took a breath, and spoke more quietly. “There’s nothing there. We threw out all the alcohol. Remember?”
When he got home, Dean placed his new book at the center of his desk; he wasn’t sure where else to put books that would be respectful to them. Wouldn’t offend some dead author’s ghost that would come back to haunt him. Jurassic was hardcover, and by far, the fanciest thing he owned that had a title. Though he supposed he could just assign a title to one of his pocketknives, or to the suit his dad had passed down to him a couple of years ago.
“Huh.” Meg propped her head on her fist. “I didn’t realize you were so close with your neighbor. What could you possible fight with your neighbor about?”
“I didn’t give you any money,” Dean countered. He stopped at a forked junction and let Castiel choose a path before they continued. “I didn’t imagine you’d come back – none of us did,” he explained.
“So, Dean.” Chuck swayed the apple juice in his glass like he wished it were something else. “What do you do for a living?”
“I don’t want to be flicked either,” he protested. Dean gave him the ball and grabbed the rubber band bag.
Not that he would’ve done anything differently if he could have. It was just- just that loving someone more than you loved yourself was a special kind of terrifying, and losing them wasn’t something you could just shake off once they... came back to life.
"I stopped by," Dean said. Did he sound casual? Probably not casual enough. He should at least try to deepen his voice; he sounded like a twelve-year-old. "Halloween parties are kinda lame, aren't they?"
“So... was it like this when you moved into your apartment?” He tried to make his tone casual as he worked.
But a couple of hours passed, and Dean didn’t show up, nor did he answer Castiel’s texts. He tried calling, but there was no answer. Dean must’ve fallen asleep, or lost himself in the case and forgotten their plans. So he got on a bus, convinced Dean just lost track of time. And by the time he got off the bus, he was solidly anxious.
“You might think Hanukkah is about lighting colorful candles and singing before them, but no,” said Ms. Mills. Castiel could not care less. He knew all of this already. In his peripheral vision, Dean shimmied in his chair, side to side, up and down, taking a look at it from this side and then from the other. Turning around in it and rocking the backrest a little. Then the bench itself. It was broken. He stood up.
“Eat, sleep, or feel emotions,” said Dean, staring at the ceiling. “Which would you rather give up?”
Well – he squared his shoulders and kept his chin up as he walked away. If she did see him – it wouldn’t be with Cas.
Cas' eyes roamed his face gently, savoring the moment. They'd gotten into the habit of not saying private things in the prison's visiting booth - too many eyes around them to feel comfortable - but man, the way Cas looked at him. Sometimes it said it all.
“’Kay,” Dean did the finger guns at him. “Gotcha.” But he couldn’t go another five minutes before speaking again. “You think it’s time for dinner?” He looked at his watch. “I think it’s time for dinner.”
“Sure.” Dean cleared his throat. “I… kinda came here to ask you a favor.” He touched a pyramid of marbles on the desk, and the thing fell apart in a second. “Shit. Sorry.” Cas waved his hand in dismiss.
And there were other things, further back. Things he couldn’t ignore after what Chuck had told him; his obsession with religion and with creating new worlds in his mind. His insistence that Castiel could move on when Dean went missing, and when he refused to move on, Dean suddenly being back, talking about God...
“Uh- I meant…” He stammered and mashed the buttons until a classic rock station came on. “There ya go.”
It was kind of weird. Castiel had thought she was kidding him when he told her Dean and him were moving and she asked if she could take a look at their old apartment. But she wasn’t. And now here they were.
It was weirdly clean. The floor. He’d expected Dean to be much messier, but maybe it was the big brother in him.
“Yeah, yeah,” said Dean, letting out a long exhale. “He’ll walk it off.” He looked at Castiel. “Rough day, huh?”
He grabbed Meg’s shoulder and pushed her away. The car passed close enough for them to feel the blast of wind that came with it.
So she was up in her room talking to a mysterious Unknown, and at that point Dean turned to him and asked:
They were both wearing head masks that day – Deadpool and him. They only pulled the masks up above their noses (they were both pretty wasted, as far as Dean could tell, and neither really minded how ridiculously uncomfortable that was) – like the Spiderman kiss, only
At that, the crew cheered more enthusiastically, although Castiel spotted the taller man crossing his hands against his chest, sourly excluding himself from the whooping crowd.
He was happy Cas and him found it within themselves to carve their way through that ocean back into friendship. But sometimes he missed that. That feeling of being loved - not just with the eyes, the smile of a friend, but with the touch, with the words, with the
When he went back down, he found Dean watching the living room with his hands on his hips and a frown on his face.
He opened his eyes to a cool sun, blinding him with white, direct light. Squinting, he looked around and tried to make sense of the shapes around him.
He read the text chat between him and the demon out loud. “five fifty two, I said, ‘You know, he likes to be the little spoon’. Five fifty eight-”
Cas looked at the book. Then he looked at Dean. “I’ll buy it for you on my break,” he said. “You can pay me back.”
“Humming Led Zepplin songs while I recite the periodic table doesn’t count as tutoring,” he shot back. “It counts as an annoyance.”
“Yes, sort of. I’m glad I didn’t choose to major in engineering, now more than ever. You were saying?”
It was hard to fret for the future of his kingdom when he was lying in tall grass, soaking in the sun and his fingers laced with someone else’s.
Everyone stared, but no one seemed to give him real attention aside from the redhead, Charlie, who brought him a small jug of water every few hours.
“Castiel,” she said, straightening his tie. “I’ve been wanting to talk to you. Any updates on our… Situation?”
Upstairs, they all squeezed into a room with a big window, another skeleton sitting in a rocking chair and a lit fireplace. Jo sat beside Dean, a metal pitchfork in hand.
He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling and didn't say anything at all in response. His hand moving to touch Dean's was the only indication of what was going on in his head. And by the time he came up with something to say, Dean was fast asleep, snoring like a true parent beside him, while he was wide awake.
He threw his bag on the second bed and went into the bathroom to wash his face. Then he texted Dean:
He looked up at the sky. The stars looked like falling angels, an entire universe away. The cold was getting to his fingertips, and he tucked his hands in his pockets, too. He took a breath. And then:
Dr. Hanscum raised her eyebrows. “Sounds like all you need to do is talk to each other, and listen. Communicate.”
skillful at, however, was guiding his crowd. In a time much shorter than Castiel had expected he was standing against the colossal totem, bracing the weight of half a dozen other men as Dean climbed their limbs like ladder steps. They must have looked absurdly silly – some seven pirates sitting on top of each other, hugging their stone brace for dear life, and Dean jumping from one to the other as smoothly as butter melting on toast.
His eyes couldn’t seem to be able to focus on more than one thing at a time these days. He found himself sitting in class, in the library, in the dining hall, staring at one thing at a time. The clock. The coffee machine. His phone. He felt his note inside his jeans pocket as clearly as if it had burned his skin through the fabric.
Cas’ eyes narrowed slowly into a squint. He’d seen every person Dean had asked before him walk away quickly as if he were asking for something completely absurd. Which he absolutely was.
That was the source behind the smile, Castiel found some days later. He didn’t even have to fish that out of him; Dean just told him, one afternoon as they were walking out from Castiel’s gym class – which Dean happily gave up on in favor of helping some freshmen with their homework in the library. They were climbing up the stairs, and Dean said:
He didn’t know how he would set things right with Dean once this is over, what he could possibly say that would make sense in all this mess. But he could tell that, for now, he got what he wanted. A confused, hurt boyfriend, who didn’t want to be anywhere near him.
This was absurd. Surely, it was impossible, and he was just dreaming, or hallucinating, or going out of his right mind. Surely, the alien-ish crown being put on Dean’s head wasn’t real, his blank expression wasn’t real, the students standing up around Castiel weren’t real.
“Ugh!” He checks the Wi-Fi connection. It’s gone. The laptop makes a little sound, and a notification reads:
"Wow. Really? You must've worked really hard. The place looks spotless." He kicked Claire's foot under the table to make her look up from her pasta long enough to nod politely.
So, this was his new life. A narrow bed. Guys calling each other Chad in the hall. A relationship with his boyfriend that concluded in exchanging texts about the adequacy or inadequacy of rooms. He supposed he should go out and explore. He shoved his phone in his pocket and left the room.
"Who makes four movies about a dead mechanic trying to kill people on Halloween? This is not what a compelling concept looks like, Dean. Just another monster."
“So,” Dean made a show of counting on his fingers as well. “Insulting each other, assholes, and can’t finish a sentence without being interrupted.”
He didn’t know, but he had a theory that the hypnotizer worked for anyone giving orders, rather than just the aliens. He remembered looking at Dean before he drank his punch, saying he didn’t want to drink it, and then Dean defending him. After he drank his own cup.
He tried to tune back in. One thing at a time. The dining table. His hands on it, flipping his ring. The kitchen counters, loaded with dishes.
Castiel rested his head back on the wall and looked outside the window, trying to focus on Dean’s words rather than his voice.
Dean let out a huff, almost a laughter. “All of this was to make me feel better? Sock Slide? The pee thing?”
be friends. If that was something Cas would ever want… It was worth the heartache, Dean thought. Just being there for him.
They got there five minutes early, and Dean kept sulking. When he walked into the interview, Castiel sat down in the waiting room. The lights were dim, and everything was wooden. A little kid in a pink dress was sitting a couple of chairs away from him, her feet swinging in the air.
“Enough!” Dean called. Before Castiel even realized Dean had raised his hand, a knife flew and lodged into the wall several feet behind Castiel, at the level where his forehead had been just a second before he ducked.
Unpacking his things wasn’t as big of a challenge as it had seemed. Dean made room in his closet, the bathroom cabinet, and even the kitchen drawers.
“What? No. The lights are all-“ Darkness falls upon them and cuts him off in the middle of the sentence.
Dean never explained to him why he’d acted so weird the day they docked to resupply. During the next few days, he seemed to do everything in his power to make Castiel uncomfortable: he’d eye him quizzically for hours at a time, and then, at something Castiel sometimes didn’t even realize he’d said, Dean’s expression would melt down and turn into a mixture of happiness and pain.
Dean put down the gun and took a look. He took the journal and flipped through it. “Oh my God,” he said and waved his brother over. “Sammy, come check this out.”
“I don’t like that you’re going in defenseless,” said Castiel. “At least take one of the knives back.”
Essentially, the difference between them was that nothing changed for Cas that night. But for Dean, life turned several times more exasperating, and more confusing. Somehow, in one night, his life shifted from calm and uneventful to his mother believing he was best friends with this tall handsome practically-stranger who was going to the high tech industry and made jokes that she – for God knows what reason – found funny and endearing. It was the equivalent of unintentionally marrying a pain in the ass successful doctor, if the doctor wore sweatpants to his early classes, and he didn’t live with you, but your mom thought he was living with you, your mom already hung pictures of your children in her living room, your mom was giving out Christmas cards with your faces on them-
“I don't know what's wrong, but I just want to make you feel better.” Cas shuffled his feet, looking at a coffee stain on the floor. “I hate seeing you like this. You've always got this attitude, like nothing can ever bring you down. it hurts to see you defeated.”
“On my end.” He couldn’t help the bitter edge to his voice. “It was finding a shredded body, and then having to bury it.”
It had to be something serious. Ms. Mills was in on it. Maybe it was about Sam. Or another family member. Maybe it was about his car.
She took him all the way to the fifth floor and sat him down in a chair. Maybe she thought he would get lost on his own. He looked around when she left – it was a big room with four beds against each wall and curtains around each bed. The space where his father’s bed should be was empty.
“Alright.” Dean cleared his throat and looked into his eyes. “I've spent months trying to find what to say, and I came up empty. 'Cause what we've got is not the kind of thing I can sum up on a page to read in front of six other people, a baby and a...” He glanced over to his right. “Garth. But it can be summed up in the way you touch my arm when you see I'm worried and you don't have to speak for me to know you want me to say what's bothering me. It can be summed up in the cup of coffee you leave on my nightstand before you leave the house when I'm too tired to get up in the morning. It doesn't show in your words – not often – because you don't do that,” he smiled softly. “It shows in every single thing you do, instead, ‘cause you’re an actions-over-words kind of guy.”
“Well, I did. Sorta. I know you’re a prince. I saw the murals, obviously. But I don’t know which, eh... Which one you are.”
He hopped back onto the floor, putting on his shoes in disbelief of the madness that took over him. He stepped out nobly, his back straight with feigned confidence and tension, his pockets full of sweets.
Dean handed him his phone wordlessly. His mouth felt dry. He wanted to kill Charlie for embarrassing him.
Airports were bigger than Dean had imagined. Everything in them was bigger: huge halls, huge corridors, and don't get him started on the planes. How can those things possibly be safe to shoot through the sky like a cannonball? It was ridiculous. And reckless, and stupid. And-
“Well, there’s no such thing as clones…” Dean rubbed his eyes. “You know what, never mind. Listen, you kicked ass today.”
“Okay,” said Dean. He peeked into the living room again. “But you’re gonna have to trust me on this.”
And he wasn’t drowning. But he wasn’t floating either. His feet moved in synchronicity with the sea, balancing him on the surface of the water.
Slowly, Cas nodded, and Dean moved past him with rigid movements. As if waiting for Cas to call him to stop and, maybe, declare something. But he wasn’t; of course he wasn’t.
“Have you got any plans for Halloween?” He asked Dean. They walked down the aisle side to side, looking around. The floor tiles were black. The fluorescent lights flickered. Dean’s hand brushed against his.
“Favorite color,” he said. He knew this: Dean’s talked about it before, in class, trying to repel April with his ability to blabber.
With effort, he let go of the crumpled paper. Charlie picked it up from the table and tried to flatten it.
"They got away." Cas let out a breath that was a little too shaky for Dean to think nothing of it. "And my car is wrecked, so I might need a ride."
Dean turned the kettle on. He was quieter than usual. Or maybe he was just as quiet as he had been in the past few week, which was quieter than usual. When he finally sat down next to Castiel with two coffee mugs, he smiled nervously.
“Yeah,” Dean mumbled back. He glanced up at Cas, smiling nervously, and looked at their hands, meeting in the middle of the counter when he handed Cas his change. “’Ere you go.”
He ripped a page off one of his notebooks and made a list: How to Spend the Summer. He wrote down in the list:
He had been staring at the walls for hours when someone walked to the front of the line and caught his attention the previous day. He had looked her over – her tight leather clothing, the defiant look in her eyes. She wasn’t like any of those other rosy gals. She was something else, chewing on a hay straw and crossing her arms like she had a hundred better places to be.
Dean’s head throbbed, and he felt dizzy. The blood trickling from his nose onto his teeth was making him nauseated. He just managed to suck in a breath without wanting to throw up and said, “I don’t have to say ‘weak’ if it makes you feel insecure.” Another shaky breath. “If you prefer, I can say ‘definitely not strong’.”
Still, the whole concept of this game made Castiel uncomfortable. He had no interest in exposing intimate details about people who wished those details to remain private, and no interest in exposing any detail about himself to this particular group of people. He also had no interest in shenanigans.
Ellen was the one to answer him. “We’re not fifteen anymore, Bobby. This isn’t some teenage fling we’re supposed to hide from our parents.”
“What is it?” Cas asked, still looking forward. Dean swallowed. He stared straight ahead, trying to focus on anything that wasn’t Cas’ attention directed at him. “Dean? What is this about?”
Dean didn't move. And for whatever reason, Cas wasn't moving, either. He was looking into Dean's eyes, and he leaned closer almost casually.
Dinner wasn’t any better than the rest of the day, although Cas finally shut up pretty much through it. It seemed like his entire relationship with Dean’s family had the goal of vexing Dean (and having ammo against him, to save for a rainy day), and not of trying to win their affection. He didn’t like being the center of attention, Dean observed. It made him uncomfortable. It made his weird come out.
Alright. So he wasn’t so good at the trash talk. But when Jared hissed and charged at him with a mouth full of fangs, he stuck the blade right into his chest.
With a preparatory clench of his teeth, Dean took the bundle and started chewing on it. As he started to change, Cas’ face did too. His expression softened. Once Dean was finally human again, Cas scooted closer and kissed him with a smile.
There was not much to do other than think. They didn’t have access to books, or to anything human that might help with the thinking. So they thought, together. And together they devised a plan.
He ran a finger across his throat behind the guy’s back, and Cas’ lips tightened, though not with the usual irritation. He was holding back a smile.
“No, you’re not,” he answered. “But I didn’t spend hours of watching pop culture movies and struggling to understand comic book references to impress Peter Parker.”
“Of course not. Why would you say that?” He was quiet for a long moment, pursing his lips. Then he said, “There’s something I haven’t told you.”
It wasn’t the comfortable silence they usually shared. There was tension under the surface, and it was felt. They always dropped their pretenses when they were alone, but this, now, didn’t quite feel like all pretenses were dropped. He turned abruptly to face Cas, only a touch setting them apart. Cas didn’t pull away; didn’t do anything but look into his eyes in the same guarded look he had before.
“Really, though,” Dean said. “Never stop? That’s gotta be an overestimation. I mean, you can’t possibly love me when I’m being an asshole."
Dean looked around him, disoriented – had he stepped into the wrong room by accident? But it was his blue lamp on the nightstand, it was his puppy-print socks on the floor and these were his philosophy textbooks thrown everywhere around. Cas was lying in his bed, sleeping undisturbed and at least half naked. He was speechless. It occurred to him he should slap himself to make sure this wasn’t a dream. A weird daydream gone all-kinds-of-right that got itself a nice seat in his subconscious.
“Do you want me to cuddle you?” Garth asked. He raised his eyebrows. “I’ll let you be the big spoon. Everyone likes being the big spoon. It makes you feel tough.”
“Yeah, you’re crazy, dude,” said Vampire Guy. But at that point, with the way that guy was looking at him, he was becoming more and more sure that he was not crazy.
“Do you think Richard didn’t realize how bad the name for this store was when he came up with it,” she asked after a minute, “Or was he the trickster type who pretended he had no idea what people were talking about when they said maybe he should change the name?”
“We suck at being adults,” said Dean thirty minutes later, throwing into the sink a towel he’d somehow managed to get burning hot and soaked wet at the same time.
“I don't care what you want, Dean. This isn't kindergarten playground anymore. This is the real world, and in the real world you have to fight to survive. So fight. Shut your mouth, put on a smile, nod your head, and do as you're told. This is what it's like to be an adult. You've made your adult choices, now it's time to face your adult consequences.”
He took his shoes off by the door and peeked into the living room. As expected: his father on the armchair, unconscious. He wandered into the middle of the room and looked around him. There was a sleeping robe on the floor. An empty glass and a whiskey bottle on the coffee table, with more coffee mugs than he could count around it. An old father wearing a dirty T-shirt and slipping off the armchair slowly, muttering in his sleep. Castiel touched his shoulder.
