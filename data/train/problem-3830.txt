Rewriting this. There's a reference to a show I'm watching on FOX. I'm sorry I'm so shitty at updating. Maybe I'll do it bi-weekly or monthly from now on, but probably not. Castiel's song is Hurt by Johnny Cash (I don't believe he is the original singer, but I like his version the most). Thanks for reading!
“No, it’s still disgusting but I still sort of want to get drunk,” he commented as he bumped shoulders with Dean. His face was growing increasingly red and Dean knew that at the end of the can Castiel was probably going to be spouting utter bullshit from his lips.
He should have drank more.
“We’re just messing around remember Dean? We shouldn’t hold hands,” he said and he walked a little farther from Dean, trying not to look at the other. He knew what Dean’s face would look like. It would be hurt, because even Castiel knew that there was something between them, something that was a whole lot more than messing around. Castiel cared for Dean, and they didn’t even know each other that well.
“Why?” She asked and Castiel just glared at her. She chuckled and then looked at all the cars. “That one.” She pointed and Castiel didn’t even look at her.
When he actually got to the coffee shop it was later in the day, Castiel actually deciding that school was important for a change. He grabbed his wallet from his back pocket and pulled a few dollars out, waiting in line so that he could get a black coffee. Charlie had decided to head home earlier than planned, making Castiel choose to see his advisor to talk about his schedule change. He licked his lips in anticipation, looking at the growing line behind him, and smiling because he seemed to just miss the afternoon rush. Castiel looked ahead in the line, peaking over the shoulders of the few people in front of him, and all he saw was blue. It was the brightest blue he had ever seen, and suddenly he was reminded of something.
Dean didn’t give him a chance to question it for too long as Castiel had become aware of how pleasing the man was when fully naked. He felt his mouth water slightly as his eyes trailed up tanned legs. He could just make out dots of freckles splattered across perfect thighs when Dean’s half hard cock came into view.
“He gets impatient,” Castiel mumbled and Charlie barked a laugh before immediately cutting it off, remembering that they were in a library. Castiel smirked and rolled his eyes. “He does. Sometimes we’re in the car and he doesn’t want to take the time to actually go to my apartment to fuck. We just do it where we have enough room, and I’m usually too distracted to really argue with him.”
Suddenly there were voices, and Castiel shot into the brush, not giving another moment to think. He heard cries and he continued forward, watching as Viet Kong fell out of the brush. Lifeless. His heart rate was up, and he could hear himself panting, but he continued forward. Castiel had a job to do, and damn anyone who tried to get in his way. He wasn’t going to die in this God forsaken jungle. He was going to leave, and hopefully he was going to live a normal life when he was home. Though he knew that was a long shot. He’d seen how other soldiers didn’t came back all in one piece.
I'm so sorry I took a break. I'm back and ready to just write fanfiction in my free time. So this story is almost coming to an end, but this version of Dean and Castiel is far from being diminished. I have so much planned for them and at the end of it you might just hate me.
“Are we not cool?” Dean asked, finally breaking the silence between them. He looked over at Castiel who had his arms crossed over his chest and the other boy shrugged his shoulders.
The next morning Castiel was waking up and packing his clothes up. “So this man that you’ve been with,” Gabriel said as he crossed his arms over his chest, smiling softly even though he was trying to be authoritative. “He’s just decided to whisk you away for the weekend? How romantic.”
"Shush small child," Dean murmured. "Tonight is the night you become a man." Castiel rolled his eyes and leaned away from Dean's fingers.
“Ready to go?” He asked and Castiel nodded.
“I’m Castiel,” he said with a small smile and he turned them so that Dean would have to look at his back. “Do you live here?” Castiel broke away from Meg and he started to flow from side to side. She giggled and nodded.
Castiel smiled and rubbed the back of his head. “Oh you know, just exploring the rest of the bar,” he said sheepishly. Oh and finding the most fucking beautiful man to ever grace the Earth. I did that too Charlie, but you probably wouldn’t care since you’re into chicks. Castiel had thought for a moment that he had said that out loud because Charlie’s expression had changed.
“Did you invite me to a dud of a party Clarence?” She asked as she pulled only one side of her mouth into a smile.
“That old guy?” He asked and shook his head. “Not on my life.” Castiel nodded and he looked back towards the window.
So sorry for this shitty chapter update. It's quick and truly that's because I couldn't think of what else to put in it. Next chapter is the final chapter, but the story of this version of Dean and Castiel is not over.
“Nice to meet you, but I’m going to go find a dance partner.” He smiled widely at the both of them and then walked off into the crowd of people dancing. Castiel hadn’t been paying any attention on who was singing even though he should have been. If he hadn’t have found someone to dance with, she had a nice smile and nice curves even though he would never go for that, then he probably would have left the floor and possibly the party. When the song had ended and the girl had successfully wrapped her arms around his neck they turned to look at the band.
“Fuck Green Eyes!” He almost screamed and his hands went to claw down the other’s back. He felt the man groan and moan as he pulled away. Castiel looked at him with a flushed face and he watched as the other man smiled.
“Alright ladies,” he yelled and all of the boys pressed against one another. “This is it, game two and we’ve already got a win in the bag. Let’s keep it up!” All the boys hooted and hollered and then they were linking arms while walking out of the locker room. Dean was linked with Castiel and Ash and he tried his best not to think about the fact that the center had a death grip on his elbow.
“There is no one to blame tonight,” Bobby said. Dean only thinking the opposite.
“I don’t like it,” he whispered and that earned him a chuckle and another peck of lips onto his chest, lower than the last one, aiming more toward his stomach.
“Why the fuck not?” He asked because that just sounded stupid.
Castiel had been nursing his third strange concoction of peach schnapps and Jack Daniel’s as his eyes traveled across the crowded room. The booze had certainly started to take effect because his gaze finally began to wander to places he didn’t often let himself look. It strolled along broad shoulders covered by worn leather, then dipped down to see a nice set of buttocks perfectly shaped by dark denim. Castiel was usually one to catch himself whenever this happened. The staring. He didn’t often delve into his carnal desires, but tonight was different. He was here to delve.
“You’re an asswipe Michael!” Castiel barked as he tried to pull his way through the arm of the referee and having no luck. Michael barked a low laugh and simply pushed the ref away from them. Castiel took a stance and looked up at Michael, who towered over Castiel easily. The player walked over to him and Dean ran over to Castiel’s side.
“God please don’t,” she said as she shook her head. She smirked though. “But you promised me that I get to hear everything you guys do, so what happened last night?”
“I might have,” he mumbled and Castiel looked up for only a second before seeing Green Eyes and immediately averting his gaze. “I just wanted to buy some books Dean.” Dean, fuck Castiel could have died right there. His name was Dean, a perfect name to fit such an overwhelmingly attractive body. Castiel was reminded of all the Deans. James Dean, Dean Jagger, Dean Stockwell, Dean Martin, and now this Dean. This Dean that was the most perfect and beautiful creature to ever grace this Earth.
“No,” he stated simply as he stood up and licked his lips. “Should I go on a walk or will I get brutally murdered like in the movies?” Dean barked a laugh and smiled brightly.
“Three months,” he said, looking along the path of the trees. “You?” Bartholomew had been transferred into Lucifer’s squad after Castiel had been a month in. So Castiel didn’t really know of his origins. Just knew that he’d been here about as long as Castiel had.
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Dean shook his head mentally and looked down at his notebook.
Castiel looked at Dean with a glare and removed his own helmet. It hung low as he crossed only one arm over his chest, his fingers holding his side. “Well,” he started as he narrowed his eyes in concentration and tried to piece everything together. “They probably think that they could intimidate us because we’re smaller and don’t have as many experienced players as them. But just because they get to pick their players doesn’t mean that they necessarily have the bigger advantage.” Dean nodded in understanding.
“I just don’t. I mean,” he stopped and exhaled. “Past experiences with blood, I just don’t like seeing guts and other things.” He coughed and looked back at the board.
They arrived at Ash’s clean and wiped clear of their sweat. Dean was still holding onto Tessa’s hand as he turned off the ignition of his car. He looked towards her and then back out the windshield. “So who’s ready to see Cas get drunk off his mind? Maybe he’ll even throw up,” Dean joked as he turned around to look at his friend. Castiel rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest.
Castiel jumped then, nearly dropping the bottle but thankfully holding on to it. He turned to see, to no surprise at all, that Dean had followed him into the kitchen.
“A lot,” Castiel remarked and grabbed his drink. Meg shivered but she shook her head.
“Wait,” he said as Dean came back round to where Castiel was. “Are those the same jeans that you couldn’t get out of?” Dean looked down at his pants and Castiel shook his head. “Oh jeez, why haven’t you gotten rid of those?” He laughed and Dean rolled his eyes.
“Fuck. Me,” he growled and he pulled even harder, making Dean stroke him down roughly. “Dean!” Castiel was going to come, he could feel it, and he was going to be so pissed. The fingers slipped out of him and the hand opened, releasing him. Castiel whimpered and his nails dug into the wooden counter. He let out a deep breath and he trembled, ass shaking again because he wanted to feel Dean. It was a few moments later when he felt the tip of Dean’s cock start to push into him and pain shot through him. He cried and his back arched. Had Dean’s cock always been fucking huge? Castiel couldn’t even remember it. It pushed into him more and he felt like he was splitting open. “Stop.” He shook his head and Dean stopped his movements.
“What?” He asked as he pressed down on his pillow some more, trying to will his erection away. It was just inappropriate to do that with Charlie in the room. “No what did you say?”
"You go sit, I'll get us more beer.” Castiel left Dean and the quarterback shuffled over to a log and plopped down onto it. He looked up at the sky and smiled as rain fell down onto his cheeks. He closed his eyes and completely drowned everything out that was going on around him. He liked the little flecks of cold that were peppering his cheeks. He welcomed it and he felt his stomach churn slightly from the alcohol. “Here you go.” Castiel plopped down beside Dean, handing the other boy an opened beer.
“You’re a fucktard Castiel!” Michael growled as he stared between the two boys and was pushed farther away from them. “Why did you leave Saint Augustine's for this crap?” The refs pushed him to the sidelines and Dean and Castiel observed as the coach grabbed him by the face mask and started to yell. Dean looked at Castiel and cocked his head to the side.
“Are you fucking serious?” He asked and Dean raised a brow, even though his hands went to Castiel’s pants, unbuttoning them with ease, the complete opposite for when they would have to take of Dean’s. “You’ve blown me in a movie theater, fucked me in a break room.” Dean chuckled and nodded, as if he was going into his own little flashback state that Castiel had. “The inside of your car outside of a bar is suddenly too open?” Dean chuckled and shook his head.
“I get that,” she said and bumped shoulders with Castiel. “Write him a letter.” Castiel thought gor a moment, that wouldn’t actually be a bad thing. He could tell Dean about what he was doing, and how much he missed him.
“What college?” He asked, and his voice sounded almost sad, but he covered it up with his gruff. Castiel smiled a little and crawled onto the bed. Dean shifted a little, sitting up and moving over to the small radio.
God hated him. He must have.
“Could I copy your notes of the discussion in class?” Kevin exhaled but nodded anyway.
“You wore that ratty practice jersey underneath your actual jersey for good luck?” Castiel asked as he himself pulled a plain white t-shirt over his head.
“Why wouldn’t they be?” Castiel asked as he lolled his head back against the books, his chest pushing itself more into Dean’s grasp. Dean shrugged his shoulders and then shifted their bodies so that he could lap at the other’s nipple. Castiel shivered and he banged his head against the books, trying to control himself. “Fuck Dean.” The other man’s teeth were the next thing to be felt and Castiel let out a small cry, pressing himself down onto Dean’s erection. “Dammit I’m--” He was so close, Dean hadn’t even touched his cock and he was so close already. It made absolutely no sense in Castiel’s eyes how one man could have so much control over him. He didn’t even get to finish his statement because Dean had shoved his hips up, pushing his clothed erection against the seam of Castiel’s pants, all the while still nibbling on his nipple. The blue eyed man came in his pants and he felt his face flush as a layer of sweat presented itself. “Oh my fuck.” He was panting and trying his damndest to catch his breath as Dean sat him back down on his feet.
“Nothing, you looked like you were brooding,” Gabriel said, smiling, which in return made Castiel smile. Gabriel always had a way about him to calm everyone down, to get them to smile and laugh. Castiel shook his head.
When he reached the edge of the porch, guarded by a dilapidated fence, he leaned over and that was when he finally let his stomach fully lurch. He retched as he gripped the splintered wood of the fence, completely emptying the contents of his stomach. It burned his mouth and his nose, but he just let it happen. Castiel learned a long time ago that holding back vomit usually did nothing to truly stop it.
When Green Eyes had parked his car, their destination being a field out in the middle of nowhere Castiel felt his breath hitch. The ignition had died and the windows were rolled down, but Castiel didn’t hear any of that because Green Eyes had slid across the seat, doing what Castiel had been thinking about for the entirety of the ride, and grasped his shirt. “Oh fuck,” was all he was able to mutter out before they were crashing together. Their lips pressed together roughly and Castiel instantly shifted his body to be pressed against the car door. He moaned uncontrollably from just the feel of Green Eyes’ hands going to slide up his sides. “Fuck.” He lolled his head back and Green Eyes took that as a sign to start attacking Castiel’s neck. The blue eyed man trembled and he moaned again, louder because it wasn’t blocked by the other man’s lips.
When he finally looked at Dean. Really looked at him. He think he understood Beth. This man. He was….. Well, Castiel wasn’t sure what he was. He just knew that he couldn’t look away. Normally that would be weird, and usually some rude comment was made. But there were no words spoken, and that was only because Dean was staring right back at him. Both of them looking at each other like they were trying to figure one another out.
“Well then I probably won’t either,” Castiel said, wanting to lean over and peck his lips to Dean’s, but refraining to doing such.
“If it was I think we’d all be dead, because I have no idea where he is,” the sergeant replied, reloading the clip and sliding it back into place. He cocked his pistol and they all looked at Samandriel. “Alright, who has the radio?”
It took several moments before Castiel moved his hands away. He stared up at his ceiling, and tried his damndest to think about something other than the mess he was currently laying in. Jesus, he was so fucking stupid. So fucking weak.
“I think you should fake, but pass the ball to someone close but don’t do it yourself,” Bobby replied as he looked at Dean. “We need our quarterback, don’t get fucked up by Michael.” Dean nodded and watched as Balthazar kick the ball to signal the Hunters getting control of it. He let out a groan and looked at Castiel.
“Do you need to go to the bathroom and fix yourself?” He asked and Castiel looked down, finally feeling the come that was all round his cock and boxers. He blushed a bright red and nodded. Why the hell did Dean do this to him? Why did Castiel sometimes feel like a complete love crazed schoolgirl when Dean talked. He looked back over at Dean and fixed his glasses, eventually taking them off so that he could wipe them clean. His eyes squinted as he stared ahead and walked with Dean, trying to focus on the things in front of him.
“How am I a dweeb?” He asked as he crossed his arms over his chest. Meg let out a soft laugh from across the car and Dean smirked.
Castiel and Dean have been fucking around for nearly two weeks now. They've done a lot, but Dean hasn't actually slipped it in Castiel. Charlie thinks its because Dean isn't going to be that gay, but Castiel keeps thinking that its because he's shy, and scared that he's going to mess up. They still don't know each other's names, that is, until they get introduced in Castiel's favorite place and sneak off to get it on in the autobiographies.
“The Gods Themselves?” He asked and Charlie nodded. He smiled and sat down the book he was looking at. “Well, I’m not that far into it, but basically its the human race being a bunch of dicks and an alien race being the good guys.” Charlie wrinkled her nose and brought her brow together.
“Tran!” Dean yelled as they switched positions for Dean to take the ball and throw. “Why the hell did you run out of bounds?”
Castiel glared at Dean for a moment then hesitantly took a sip of his beer. His eyes immediately grew wide and Dean's smile got bigger as he took another drink of his beverage. He chuckled and licked his lips.
Shock.
He wasn't looking for Ash or Garth this time, instead he was supposed to be looking for Benny. He caught sight of the number seventy-four. He smiled and tossed the ball with absolute ease. He watched, only for a moment before being clashed to the ground by Michael. The ball glided in the air and strong, calloused hands caught it. Dean grunted as he fell to the ground and he squirmed slightly as he felt the whistle and the player hunched over top of him made no incline to move. "Dude," he hissed after spitting out his mouth guard. "Get the fuck off of me."
"But Dean-" Castiel started before Dean pressed two of his fingers to his lips.
“Yes,” he panted slightly as Dean’s fingers wrapped around Castiel’s cock, stroking down a second later. “Yes I want your cock Dean.” His eyes fluttered and as Dean pulled away to take his own pants off Castiel kept his eyes closed, relishing in the moment. He panted slightly and moved to strip himself of his shirt. “Should we crawl into the back?” Dean shook his head and Castiel just sat back against the seat again. In a matter of moments Castiel was writhing underneath Dean, moaning and trying his best to contain every inch of himself.
“Green Eyes?” He asked breathlessly and his hand wrapped around both of their cocks, causing Castiel to tense and flail slightly. The blue eyed man wrapped around Green Eyes and he clawed at his back again. “I like it.” His lips were on Castiel’s again seconds later, hand stroking them down faster and causing Castiel to whimper.
“God no,” he muttered and he shook his head, just thinking about one making him sick to his stomach. “No, they’re not in any interest of mine.”
“You and Gilda didn’t work out?” He asked and she shook her head. “Oh I’m so sorry to hear that.”
“The best,” Castiel answered for Dean, pecking softly as he shuffled a little bit. “I mean it was just-“
“Your name is Castiel, but Clarence is cuter,” she said and Castiel shifted away from the finger. “So what brings you to the Roadhouse?” The Novak felt his cheeks brighten and he looked down.
“No, but did you at least find a book?” Castiel looked at Gabriel, half tempted to say that he found a lot of things and that one of them was the sexiest fucking person alive.
Tessa was sat in the stands, staring at the game even though Dean knew that she never really knew what was going on. Her black jacket was hugging at her sides and her lovely full lips were in a line of concentration. Her gaze broke and she looked down at Dean, her brown eyes bright with excitement because she knew that they were going to win. He smiled at her with a small pull of his lips then went back to paying attention to the game. The final whistle blew and Dean started to clap his hands. His teammates crowded him and patted him on the back. They all navigated into the long line to clap hands with the other team and Dean couldn’t help but feel a slight chill when he was met with Michael and the man glared at him with absolute daggers of kill.
“No,” he said as he smiled cheekily, the muscles growing a darker shade of red. “No I’m not going to tell you.”
“I don’t give a shit,” he murmured and moaned softly when Dean started to work on his belt. “Not right now, just fucking touch me.” Everything seemed to be ignited when Dean touched him again and Castiel could already feel his control slip. He was still sore from earlier that day, so fucking was out of the question, but that didn’t mean that they couldn’t do other things. Dean smirked and then he was kissing Castiel’s neck, causing the man to quiver and practically hold himself up with the tree. He moaned softly and his hands attached themselves to Dean’s hair, tugging roughly. “Fuck Dean.” The other man moaned and he shifted to be on his knees, causing Castiel to smile and loll his head back. He shivered as he felt Dean’s hands tug his pants down just enough to release his cock and he moaned when the man before him took no time at all to take it into his mouth.
“That’s tomorrow and you still haven’t given him an answer?” She asked and Castiel shook his head.
When they approached the so called party area Castiel was quick to notice that there was entirely no one around. He turned to Charlie and cocked a brow. “I thought you told me there was a party going on?” He asked and Charlie just nodded.
“Oh really?” Green Eyes nodded. “And why do you say that?” Castiel licked his lips and watched as Green Eyes did it in return, so they were making gestures at each other.
“So it is,” Green Eyes said and Castiel popped the door open. “See you around?”
Dean took his spot on the sidelines next to Bobby and Castiel and he let out a sigh. He ran his fingers through his hair, his eyes wandering around the players out on the field. They all got into their positions and the quarterback crossed his arms over his chest. He pulled his helmet off and tucked it under his arm and he looked over when he heard Castiel cough. “So, all knowing of plays that the Angels could be playing. What do you think?”
“What did he do?” Charlie asked and Castiel shushed her.
Castiel looked down the road before he entered the diner, seeing a line of people stretched down the sidewalk that seemed to be coming from the stadium. His brow scrunched together. What was going on there? Hell if he knew. He walked into the diner without another thought, smiling over to his manager and finishing off his fag. “Hey Beth, sorry I’m a bit late,” he called out to her, suddenly feeling a pair of eyes on him. Castiel looked around, before finding the pair of green eyes on him. He narrowed his eyes, before looking away and going to get ready for work.
“I don’t know,” he murmured as he looked away, his helmet was still on so Dean couldn’t see the fact that Castiel was blushing. “What are we supposed to do?”
“She was not a poor and helpless girl, she dragged me in the woods herself,” Dean retorted as he walked with Castiel.
“Excuse me,” a voice sounded through the library and Castiel turned around to see no one at first before his eyes moved down to see a kid. Okay, so he might not have been a kid, but he was definitely a few years younger than Castiel. He had bright green eyes and tousled brown hair.
“Please,” he begged because he felt no hand, or mouth, or anything wrap around him. It was just standing there out in the open and being neglected. “Please touch me.” Castiel’s glasses were askew, but his eyes were so screwed shut that he couldn’t even begin to bother with them. He clenched his jaw and was about to open his eyes and look down before he felt Green Eyes’ hot wet mouth around him. Castiel moaned in pleasure and bucked his hips forward, feeling Green Eyes gag and he smirked. “Oh fuck.”
“So why haven’t you talked to Dean?” Charlie asked, making Castiel sigh. “He’s been asking about you.”
“I don’t know, they asked?”
“Think that we should send Tran out? I mean he’s a dweeb but damn, the kid can run fast,” Dean said as he looked over toward the only player to completely stick out among them. He was shorter than all of them, the only freshman who actually had all of his classes with Dean and knew how to catch a ball.
“No fast fucking,” he said simply and Castiel stood up. Sam shouldn’t be talking about stuff like this, the kid was only what? Fourteen? That wasn’t bad, but Castiel just wasn’t comfortable with it quite yet. “Slow, sensual, emotional.” Castiel clenched his jaw.
“I’m nothing compared to you Dean,” he mumbled and Dean chuckled before moving his hips against Castiel again, causing Castiel to shiver and grasp Dean’s shirt tighter. This was new, this was definitely new. Dean had never put his cock so closed to Castiel’s ass. Sure, his pants and Castiel’s were blocking them from anything, but that still didn’t mean it didn’t feel good. “So sexy.” He lolled his head back, knocking it against autobiographies of some people that couldn’t possibly be as amazing as the man thrusting up into him. Castiel’s grip tightened even more when he could feel Dean’s clothed erection pushing up against the seam of his jeans. How the hell could Charlie think Dean wouldn’t do it? Because this right here, it was definitely confirmation enough that they will. “Oh Dean.” Castiel was panting, and his body was shaking, but the pushes up into him, the clear arousal that was both flowing through them was amazing.
“How do you want me?” He asked, and Castiel didn’t even bother to answer. They were naked, they were in his bedroom, and Dean was fully aware that he’d been distracted by his dick. So Castiel didn’t reply. Instead he moved forward and climbed up onto his bed between Dean’s legs. He stared unabashedly, soaking up how red Dean’s lips were. How there was a deep blush to his cheeks that only seemed to accentuate his freckles. Maybe the sun did rise for the other man considering just how many little kisses were all along his body.
“I wasn’t born yesterday, I’ve seen every science fiction flick you can think of,” he said and she cocked a brow.
The area of the city was small, and he liked what all the little shops were decorated with. As they passed a music shop he smiled, seeing a poster for his concert tonight plastered all over the windows. “You’re still big Dean,” Sam reassured, and Charlie looked up from her note pad, looking at the interactions between the two siblings. She narrowed her eyes a tad before writing something down quickly. Dean paid her no mind and went to look at his brother. He pushed him roughly and rolled his eyes.
“You--ha,” he panted slightly and his fingers curled into fists. “You said you liked the scruff.” Dean smiled and he nodded.
“I’ll do it,” he stated and Castiel watched as Dean cocked a brow. “What? I’m an Eagle Scout.” Dean’s laugh echoes around everyone’s ears and Castiel shook his head. “Laugh all you want, but I can tie up your hands in thirteen different ways and you won’t be able to get out of them.” His eyes grew wide as he realized what he had just said and he clenched his jaw, his face burning up. “I uh,” Dean was blushing as well and Castiel looked to the fire ring. “Just get me some paper and kindling.”
“Yes?” he said and he shook his head. “I’m so sorry Sam, I apologize immensely that my mind is elsewhere.” He rubbed the back of his head. “I like Star Wars yes, I’m sorry. I saw it opening night.” Sam smiled widely, his dimples penetrating his face.
“Get in the car,” she said before Castiel could finish his statement. “I got a jacket for you, so get in.” Castiel raised a brow, but he climbed into the back seat of the car, slipping a sweatshirt over his chest. Charlie rolled the window back up and Dorothy smiled at Castiel, adjusting the mirror a little.
Castiel felt his jaw tighten as he swallowed thickly. He certainly knew what they were doing now, or at least what he was going to do. It took a strenuous amount of effort, but he had been able to continue his gaze upward. Though he nearly regretted doing so when he was met with Dean’s stupid fucking smile.
“Nice to know that I’m fucking a jock,” he mumbled and nuzzled his face into the crook of Castiel’s neck, making the other quiver. Castiel tangled his fingers into Dean’s hair, laughing softly.
“Sure thing,” Sammy said as he handed the other boy the lighter and then made his descent back into the camper for supplies. Castiel swallowed thickly because he could feel Dean’s eyes on him.
“I used to have a friend that would only play rock music, Seger being one of them,” he said softly and Balthazar chuckled again, making Castiel wonder how something could be so funny.
” Castiel attempted to stand fully again, but still kept his grip on the fence railing. He looked around the porch slowly, noticing that the small number of people he had seen before rushing out were gone. Most likely left the second Castiel lost it over the porch. Which meant that they were alone. Maybe not fully alone, but there was definitely no one close enough to them that could hear things he didn’t want people to hear.
“Face paint brother,” he said as he looked over at Dean. “Gotta get a game face on.” Dean chuckled because Ash looked absolutely ridiculous. “Hey, you need one too.” The wide receiver leaned over to Dean and he smeared black paint across his cheek.
“I thought you were gonna be here a lot sooner than you were,” he said and she rolled her eyes. “Come on, go park and then I’ll be up in my apartment. I’m number three.”
"Does that still hurt?" Dean asked, more concerned about Castiel's wrist than the game. "I mean, you did go to the doctor's right?" Castiel waved Dean off as they entered the locker room. "Cas, you can't have a bum wrist."
"Come on," he murmured as he pulled them toward the fire. "Let's go sit by the flames of light." He downed the rest of his beer and threw it towards the blaze.
“Meg told me to come to make sure you don’t die,” Dean stated as if matter of factly. “Also, I don’t want my best friend to be murdered in the woods.” He started to walk again and Castiel followed, struggling as he did so. “Even if he is a bitch.”
“Let’s go to bed,” Castiel mumbled and Dean nodded, settling a little bit more as the thunder cracked in the night sky.
“Okay Cas,” he heard Dean murmur as he moved his mouth next to Castiel’s ear, teeth going to nibble on his lobe. “Whatever you want.” Castiel shivered and he nodded his head, causing Dean’s grip on his ear to tighten. Fuck it felt so amazing, every piece of Dean that was touching Castiel was just igniting every nerve in his body. Dean Winchester was truly a god among men. His broadly built, muscles peeking up around every piece of him and making curves. They were so smooth and inviting and Castiel would be perfectly content if that was all he was allowed to do to Dean, just touch him and get nothing in return.
They went on like this for several minutes, sometimes they would break the kiss and just stare at each other before going back to it. Castiel ran his hands up and down Dean’s back, not truly believing that he was kissing his best friend. He moved his legs and Dean nestled himself in between them. He grasped at Dean’s shirt more as the man started to ground down on him, both of their clothed erections rubbing against each other and causing them to stop. Reality had snapped back to them and they looked at each other with swollen lips and flushed faces.
“I like it,” Dean said and Castiel’s head snapped over to look at him. He liked it? God Castiel had heard that phrase too much from Dean. It was a simple three words, but every time Dean said it Castiel’s body vibrated with pleasure.
"He wasn't always a primal ape," Castiel retorted quickly as he walked back to his post, in front of Dean as always.
“I want a burger, we can’t get burgers on the bus,” Dean said and Sam huffed, already moving to grab his jacket that was laid beside Dean and his acoustic guitar. Dean followed along with a warm smile.
“Where are we going Charles?” She asked and Charlie laughed.
“Any way we can get food?” He asked and Sam groaned, rolling his eyes.
“Cas,” Dean mumbled before going to shove against him. “Cas, we need to,” more short kisses and Castiel increased the roughness. He only knew rough. He was only good at fast and simple. Romanticism was never in his vocabulary. “We need to talk.” Dean pushed Castiel away, panting slightly and holding onto his shoulders. “Please.” The blue eyed man nodded and he sat back, away from Dean.
“I completely agree with you,” Coach Singer chirped from beside Dean. “The kid is small, the Angels will eat him alive without warning.” Dean nodded in understanding and tapped his fingers against the face mask of his helmet.
“I should take you home shouldn’t I?” He asked and Castiel sighed but nodded. He fixed his glasses and slowly removed himself from Green Eyes’ embrace. Green Eyes moved to tuck his cock back into his pants and he started the car back up in no time. Castiel frowned, but he scrambled for his clothes, using his boxers to wipe the come off of his chest and Green Eyes’. He leaned over the bench seat to pick up his Beatles shirt and he slipped it over his head, dropping his boxers on the floor in the backseat in the process.. Castiel leaned back in his seat and slipped on his pants. “Where do you live?”
“So your name is Dean,” he said and he looked up at the other man, licking his lips. Dean returned the gesture and Castiel chuckled. “I like it.” Dean smirked back and then he looked arund the library.
“Yeah, Dean-o here is a pretty good bartender,” she said with a small grin. “So where did you go at the party? I thought we were hitting it off.” Castiel clenched his jaw and shook his head.
“I liked it,” he mumbled as he licked his lips. Castiel returned the gesture and stood up, pulling Dean’s pants up with him. “Are you going to be at the Roadhouse tonight?”
“I know,” Dean said cheekily and Tessa rolled her eyes again. “So we’re just waiting on Cas and Meg.” Tessa nodded and Dean started his car. The Impala roared to life and Dean let out a small sigh. “She’s so beautiful.”
“Harder.”
Ash laughed and shook his head, watching as Meg walked with Tessa over to the coolers. "Pretty sure that's kind of homo dude," Ash replied with a smile. "Not that there's anything wrong with that, just a little queer." The girls wrapped around his arms leaned up to look at him. "Sorry girls, forgot you need the attention." He looked between Dean and Castiel and smirked. "I'll see you guys Monday," and with that Ash walked away from them, leaving them alone.
“So what if Dean got a mullet?” She asked, now being informed of Dean’s name as well as all of their excursions. Castiel shook his head.
Its just a typical after party at Ash's. That is, until it isn't.
The blue eyed man had been all set and ready to cross the street when he noticed that Charlie had ducked behind him and rushed over to a door. He quickly swiveled on his feet and caught up with her with ease. “Is this the place?” He asked and she nodded.
“I’m just getting a towel for our mess,” he said and was back a second later, making Castiel smile softly.
“You were actually listening in the car?” He asked and Castiel nodded.
“If you still have to ask what do you think?” Castiel grumbled in response as he slipped on his bright blue under armor. Dean let out a sigh and raised his arms in defeat.
“I’ll see you after class,” he murmured and she smiled up at him.
“Is that what you want?” Dean asked as he looked down at Castiel. Fuck, he looked so different like this. He looked so shy, and scared. Dean looked like he was scared of messing this all up, which is completely different from his usual confident self. Castiel nodded and ran his fingers through Dean’s hair.
Castiel didn’t back down. No. He met Dean in the middle, leaning forward and pressing just as much when their lips connected. Dean’s lips were chapped, but soft and unsure. It was an entirely different feeling, kissing him, and it certainly reignited that fire in Castiel’s belly. After a moment, they shifted the kiss together, as if they had practiced before, and deepened it. Castiel noticed his entire body relax into Dean as he felt the man’s arms drop down to grab at his waist. He moved his own hands to reach up and thread his fingers into fistfuls of hair.
“Why the hell are you so pissed at me?” He questioned, and Castiel only stood up, tackling him to the ground.
“Vomit, remember?” Castiel asked, as he still tasted it on his tongue. He doubted that Dean really wanted a taste of his own.
“Castiel?” He asked and Castiel watched as dimples penetrating his seemingly perfect skin. “What kind of name is that?” The blue eyed man chuckled and Sam joined in as well.
“You know,” he said, about to start some touching moment before Beth patted his shoulder.
“Hi,” she said and Castiel watched as a heat rised to Charlie’s cheeks. “The usual Charles?” She smiled and nodded and then the bartender left the both of them. Castiel smiled knowingly and Charlie caught the glance.
They shared a glance from across the room, and his eyes flicked away from Dean when he noticed the man’s smile, small but knowing. As if he had caught Castiel staring. Which Castiel attempted to ignore by looking absolutely anywhere but at those full lips.
“Cause you’re into me Cas, and you clearly don’t want to be,” Dean said, really nailing the head on the coffin. Not that Castiel was going to admit that. “And somehow I still like you even with your puke in my peripheral.”
Holy fucking shit it was Dean, it was Dean and he was off to the corner with a guitar and his eyes were on Castiel. The Novak had bit his lip and he looked towards the girl. “What’s your name?” He asked as his eyes wandered over to Dean’s again, watching his fingers as they slowly started up the next song with a guitar riff.
“You’re so fucking gorgeous Cas,” Dean mumbled against Castiel’s skin, hips rolling up into him and making him moan softly. Castiel nodded and grasped at Dean’s shirt, pulling it roughly.
Castiel sipped at his drink and watched as the man bit his own lip, as if returning the gesture. “Originally?” He asked and he placed his chin in his hand and let his elbow rest on the bar. “San Francisco.” Green Eyes smirked and shook his head. “What?”
“So do I,” Castiel said when they finally stopped and he was able to look at the books. “What sort of reading level do you have? Are you intermediate or more adult?” He looked down at Sam and watched as he pouted in concentration.
“I want to go,” he said and Dean smiled.
As he approached he heard Dean laugh, and he felt his chest flutter a bit. That was peculiar. Usually he barely glanced at the customers, barely even tuned them in unless he was taking orders. Dean’s laugh though. It was nice, and for some reason, it made his chest warm. Castiel plastered on a fake smile and approached the table. Another laugh come from Dean and Castiel ignored it, focusing on the task at hand, focusing on work. “Alright, who ordered the salad?” He asked, trying to sound peppy, though it came out a little flat due to his voice. He looked to see the man sitting across from Dean raised his hand. “And the burgers?” Both Dean and the red head raised their hands. Castiel smiled and handed them out, before looking at the three of them. “Well my name is Castiel, and I’ll be your sever for the rest of the evening. If you need anything just let me know.” He let out another weak smile.
“There’s pong?” Meg said with a smile as she looked at Castiel. “Maybe this won’t be a dud of a party. I’m great at pong.”
“Do you have your driver’s license?” Castiel felt his cheeks heat up and he looked down.
“What do you mean by that?” Castiel asked and Sam sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“So do you want to go to the library? They’re having some sort of book sale and I don’t really want to go by myself.” Castiel had surprised himself by how much he had gotten into the habit of calling this place his home. He knew that when the summer ended that Gabriel and him would leave, that he would leave Charlie, and Green Eyes, and probably never see them again. At this moment though, none of that seemed to matter.
“Honestly? I’m not sure, sometimes he’s fine, sometimes he wants nothing to do with me,” Dean said and Castiel walked past both of them. He paid no attention to either of them and Dean frowned. “See what I mean?” Benny nodded then went back to getting into his uniform, leaving Dean to talk to Castiel. He tapped the center’s shoulder and Castiel looked up at him.
“I have summer reading to do that I have neglected for the entirety of the summer,” he said before stepping out of the camper, Castiel getting a little frightened at the way it rocked. “See you tonight!” Sam waved them off and headed over to a little area with a large tree and lots of shade. Castiel turned to Dean and looked around the camper.
Where have you been Cassie?” He asked and Castiel rolled his eyes.
“Nothing Tess,” Dean stated as he leaned down to kiss her cheek. “Can we not talk about this? I mean I have to get to class.”
“You could tell?” He asked and Castiel almost thought that it sounded defeated if not hurt. Castiel shook his head and he smiled at Green Eyes.
“Of course, it’s your debut back. Why wouldn’t we?” Sam said in return, and Dean just smiled wider.
“That was another thing I wanted to touch on,” Charlie was quick to say, but was interrupted by the waiter who had yet to look at Dean walked to the booth.
Dean obliged, though at the cost of stroking his cock. He grabbed onto both of Castiel’s hips and thrusted up while bringing him down, essentially spearing him on Dean’s cock. Castiel didn’t even bother to hold back his cry of pleasure from the action, and it only egged Dean on more. He kept the pace, and Castiel felt his entire body filling to the brim with pure hot pleasure.
He shouldn’t be this comfortable. He shouldn’t think that this is his life because it isn’t. In a little more than a month he’ll be leaving and he’ll be saying goodbye to Dean, Charlie, hell even Sam. Castiel was going to go to college and he wasn’t going to look back. This though, what he was doing right now was so amazing, so right. It made Castiel think, what if he just got a job at the library? What if he just decided to move in with Dean and Sam? Get a permanent residence somewhere rather than move about every which way. Castiel shook his head. That wasn’t the plan. He was going to college, find everything out, and do something with his life. Be everything his parents said he would never amount to when he came out to them.
“Its nice to know you like it,” he heard the other voice whisper. It was so low, so full of lust, and so deep. Castiel shivered and shook his head.
Lake water, Castiel loved lake water. He loved how cool it was, except for the start of the water because it was warm from the sun. He reached the top of the water and took in a big breath, seeing Dean at the edge, staring at him. “What?” He asked cheekily and Dean just stared.
“Is this okay?” Dean asked and Castiel smiled. Of course it was okay, it was fucking fantastic because this was Dean. Castiel nodded and he reached behind him to touch Dean’s hand, pushing so that his finger went into him more. He let out a small cry and then screwed his eyes shut.
“Fucking fine, but if we lose tonight it’s all your fault,” he hissed as he slipped on his jersey over his head and tucking it in. Dean didn’t even spare Castiel another look before turning away from him and heading over to Ash. “Hey, so what have we got going on over here?” Ash smiled and then smeared another slab of black face paint on his face.
“What can I get for you guys this afternoon?” He asked, finally glancing at Dean. He didn’t wear a name tag, but his voice was deep, almost raspy, and Dean was a little hooked on how it sounded. But something was off. They guy didn’t widen his eyes, and he didn’t say a single word to Dean. About anything.
“Hey!” He said and his eyes immediately squinted as his vision blurred. “Dean give those back!” Castiel reached forward blindly and Dean only chuckled in response.
“I don’t know,” he mumbled and Castiel rolled his eyes.
“Okay,” Castiel said, holding his hand up. “Okay I will, just, lets never talk about this again. Okay?” Sam smirked and then walked away, grabbing some food on their little pullout table. Castiel sighed, adjusting his glasses, and then walked into the camper, stepping up into it and seeing Dean on the bed. He kicked off his shoes, noticing that the other was fiddling with something, and slipped his glasses off. “Dean.” The older Winchester boy turned to Castiel, pouting over at him.
“Yeah sorry,” he mumbled and smiled a little. “I just get lost in thought sometimes.” Castiel looked the man over, liking the appearance of him. Though he knew that it would be a while before Castiel was ready for someone other than Dean. It was going to be a very long time until he was ready for someone else.
Castiel would just have to give Dean the cold shoulder, he didn’t want the other man to get big headed and think he could just fuck Castiel as he pleased; not saying that Castiel wouldn’t be fine with the idea, but he didn’t want to be considered a tramp. He poured himself a cup of punch and sipped on it gingerly.
“Can we not talk about what I’m going to be doing this weekend?” Gabriel laughed and stood up slightly.
“You’ll get there, trust me,” he said as he looked at Castiel with a smirk. “Just give the alcohol some time to explore your system.” He took another big drink and looked over to the pong table to see Tessa and Meg laughing and his girl throwing a ball into a cup. Dean smiled and licked his lips. “Why did you transfer schools?” It was a weird question to ask,  but Dean was curious considering he never even seemed to talk about his life before he moved schools. He looked at Castiel and cocked a brow. Castiel shook his head and took a sip of his beer, a nervous smile playing on his lips.
“I bet, that’s why you need my notes.” Dean groaned.
“I’m still pissed at you,” he grumbled and he looked down at Dean’s crotch, seeing it hard. “I’m not helping you with that either.” Dean frowned and he placed his hands on Castiel’s hips.
"A two point lead is something we need," Castiel said as he twirled his wrist, the bones slightly cracking and making Dean wince. "Being tied isn't winning."
“Like you just got exactly what you wanted.”
“Fuck Dean,” he murmured and he opened his eyes again to look at the forest. Castiel let out a slight pant and stared up at his ceiling. This wasn’t good, it wasn’t good at all because he could feel his boxers constraining against his hard on. Castiel felt sick, absolutely sick to his stomach. He placed his hands over his face and tried to just forget about it, but it was distracting him. He wasn’t supposed to think that at all, he wasn’t supposed to dream about Dean kissing him, or touching him. His hands balled into fists and he clenched his jaw. “Fuck Dean,” he snarled as he stood up and felt the anger boiling up inside him because of what he’d just dreamt about, he wasn’t mad at Dean, he was mad at himself.
The next thing he knew he was in Green Eyes’ car, using every piece of willpower he had to not slide across the bench seat and not start attacking his neck and having his hand start to palm at his crotch.
Castiel rolled his eyes before looking back down to his cup. When had he sat it down? He poured the whiskey into it, and tried not to think about how close Dean was standing to him. He wouldn’t choose Dean. He shouldn’t. Interacting with Dean outside of what little space they share on the practice field should stay at a bare minimum.
“So fucking tight,” he breathed and he gripped Castiel tighter. “Tighter than I thought.” That’s because Dean’s cock was huge compared to what Castiel had been used to. He thrusted up into Castiel again, hand going to stroke the other man. He was trembling because Dean felt so fucking good in him. He kept hitting Castiel’s prostate and he was moaning and panting just as much as the blue eyed man. It was so hot in the kitchen, and Castiel wanted to reach across to turn the air conditioning up more. He didn’t though and he even moved his hand to grasp at Dean’s back, edging him to move even more. “So beautiful.”Castiel moaned a little louder and Dean stroked roughly.
“I think this Thursday.” This time Charlie did hit him.
“We’re supposed to act like it didn’t happen,” Dean stated. “I mean why haven’t we talked at all today?” Castiel looked at Dean again and cocked a brow, even though Dean couldn’t see it because of the helmet.
He walked over to the Castiel, his helmet in his hand and smiled up at the scoreboard. "I'd say we're doing pretty good," he stated as they both walked towards the locker room with the other players.
On the surface Dean and Castiel seem to be operating normally. They don't talk about what happened, but really? They're not talking at all. Castiel isn't necessarily mad at Dean, he just doesn't know what to do with his anger. And Dean? Well he's just not sure what to feel at all.
“You wear glasses?” He asked and Castiel finally looked at him. Dean didn’t mean to do it, but he did. His bright emerald eyes instantly met the glass covered cerulean and he felt his breath catch. Had Castiel’s eyes always been that blue? So blue that they were like the sky almost but had ripples of waves crashing through tiny spirals of black holes. He’d never noticed because he’d never seen Castiel with glasses before and they just magnified his eyes to an even bigger scale.
So Castiel stared at Dean for a moment, and he mulled it over. Really mulled it over. Dean could still just leave. They could keep what thin line was still between them, and go back. Castiel didn’t have to choose Dean, but… he wanted to.
Castiel squirmed when he felt a cold hand slip underneath his shirt. It was just enough shock to his system that he was able to pull away, but not without giving Dean's tongue a suck while he did it. In turn it elicited the most delicious noise from his lover's lips. The sound was part moan and part whimper, and was absolute music to Castiel's ears.”We need to go to my room.” He pushed Dean back just a bit more, and instantly missed the feeling of having another body against him.
“Alright,” Lucifer said as he pulled back, looking over his men who were drenched and tired. “Gabriel and Inias, stay here and set up the M60.” The men nodded and Castiel looked at them for a moment, before hearing his name called. “Castiel and Bartholomew, group together and advance towards their position when I give the signal.” Castiel nodded, looking at Bartholomew and seeing the man nod towards him. “Samandriel, you come with me and we’ll advance on them as well.” Lucifer looked over again, before signaling for everyone to get into position. As Castiel crouched with Bartholomew, he made sure yet again that his weapon was ready to fire.
“That’s where my brother wants to go,” Dean said and turned to the other, Castiel was already right beside him. He smiled at him a little before leaning forward, pressing their lips together. “He wants to be a lawyer.” Dean talked in between kisses, as if trying to signal Castiel that he would rather talk. Castiel breathed against Dean’s lips and moved away.
“That’s why I like it so much,” he said and then he picked up another book. They did this for a while, every so often making casual conversation. Castiel liked Charlie and his’ relationship. They didn’t always have to talk, and they just enjoyed each other’s company. They both also liked the fact that they couldn’t get the other’s hopes up in no possible way. He eventually found a book that looked good enough and bought it for a later day, skimming through the pages. When he went to go sit down and actually read, leaving Charlie by the cheaper books, he only got into the first few pages before his mind drifted to Green Eyes in the movie theater.
Castiel watched with some amusement as Dean awkwardly bounced onto the mattress and situated himself on his back. Though that amusement was short lived when Dean spoke up with that same stupid smile.
Castiel pulled away from Dean with a slight nip at the man’s bottom lip. He stared at him, all of him, and ground himself down onto those perfect fingers. “Just fuck me already Dean.” There was that stupid fucking grin again.
“Not weird, just uncommon,” he said and looked over at Castiel. “You’re beautiful too.” Castiel smiled and looked out the window. He fixed his glasses and licked his lips.
“No that can’t be right, I mean his brother said that they just came into town,” he said, because he clearly remembered Sam telling him that.
“Is that so?” He asked with a cocked brow. “I always thought that I looked like a nerd.”
Castiel Novak still hears the blood curling screams, even long after he's woken up from his drug induced haze. He can still feel the jungle mud on his skin, and can smell the burning flesh of his fellow soldiers. It takes him several shaking minutes before he realizes that he's in his apartment, and that the alarm he's hearing isn't from a base camp. It's from his alarm clock. He's home, Castiel just has to keep that in his mind. He's home and away from the damn jungle.
The forest had grown quiet around them, the sound of rushing water being the only noise minus the occasional shake of the trees. Castiel and Bartholomew headed west as Lucifer and Samandriel headed east. They crossed the waters slowly, making a minimal amount of noise possible.
Castiel opened his mouth to say some form of a retort, but closed it because he was tired of waiting. He spit into his hand before reaching down and stroking Dean’s cock thoroughly. There was certainly some form of pride in him as he watched green eyes flutter and lips part on a sigh.
“Dean!” He pulled at a handful of hair as he felt his entire body boil over with ecstasy. Jesus Christ he was absolutely positive that it had never felt like this before. It had never been this good. Castiel could barely process what was happening around him as he skyrocketed to absolute bliss.
How far off I sat and wondered
“Sorry about that, my boss made me wash all the dishes that we had,” he said and Castiel turned to look at him. He smiled and shook his head.
They moved quickly then, Castiel leading while Dean followed behind practically on his heels. He twisted around to face Dean as he opened the door, and stepped back into his room quietly. The lights were off, but Castiel made no move toward where the switch was.
