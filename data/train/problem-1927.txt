Sherlock completely failed to notice – of course – hurriedly spreading out several sheets of paper that he'd pulled from other files, seemingly at random. John leaned forward, elbows on his knees, trying to see a pattern in the handwritten columns.
"It's colder than it should be," John commented, speaking in a whisper. "Heat's not been on for a while."
Sherlock nodded but there was a flicker in his features – that anger again. John wondered what would happen after he did go to sleep. Sherlock had eyes all over the city, and no one noticed the homeless, he said. They blended in with the background.
He stalked up the stairs before she could ask anything else, closed the door to his flat in a hurry, then turned around slowly. Sherlock leaned back against the door, breathing hard again, aware of how suffocatingly silent it was. He could hear the echo of their last words and the reverberating finality of John slamming the door behind him.
“But they were friends, according to Janine’s mother. What did she say to Irene? ‘Thick as thieves’.” A smile quirked on the edges of Gabriel’s lips, and Sherlock felt the twinge of amusement mirrored in himself. “I think he’d have wanted her to know.”
He shifted his shoulders and allowed himself a private grimace at the stiffness that had lodged itself in his muscles. A momentary longing for John’s skilled hands made Sherlock startle inwardly, and he reached for his phone, alarmed that he might have let an entire day slip by without alerting John that he would not be home.
"It's all right," John murmured, rubbing soothing circles on Sherlock's back. Sherlock managed a nod, but that didn't stop the shuddering or the tears he was trying to keep quiet. John kept up the whispered reassurances until the episode had passed, leaving Sherlock pale and rung out, bruised eyes ringed with red.
"Any other time and you'd be complaining it's late. Come on," he said, clapping his good hand on Sherlock's knee. "I'll get the plates."
"Yes," David replied in a tone that suggested Mycroft was a bit thick for not understanding the intricacies of packing for a weekend away. "Pyjamas and socks for each night. Trousers for Saturday and for Sunday, in case one pair gets dirty. Uncle John did say he was taking us to the zoo."
Lestrade gave an exasperated sigh and Sherlock felt John stiffen and shift beside him. He strode away from the DI and hoped he wouldn't run into Anderson on the way out of the Yard – he'd wasted enough time already.
"We spend so much time with names and no victim to go along with them. Now we have the victim but not the name. Forty-eight hours... I thought by then someone would have reported him missing."
Whoever was behind this didn't want to be found. He simply wanted to wreak havoc, to force them to chase him around uselessly.
"Excellently observed," his partner murmured, a small smile playing on his lips, a familiar gleam in his grey eyes. John drew another deep breath to keep himself composed, firming his military stance even more. "I suspect you'll have ample opportunity to collect on your debt. But for now," Sherlock tossed one of the helmets across the small space, and John fumbled to catch it, "we have work to do."
Their primary suspect couldn't give them any information – nor could he be linked to either the crime scene or the victim's home.
"If Mary wanted me dead, I would be," Sherlock replied with infuriating reasonableness given the situation. "I wanted a change of scenery. And now I want to know who
That, this time, he'd gone too far. That another threat against them neutralized meant only that there was no
As John finished his water and moved to put his empty bottle next to Sherlock's on the small table, Sherlock made a noise at the back of his throat and reached out, eyes still closed. John stepped in front of him without hesitation and Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist, pressing his face into his abdomen. John laced his hands into his husband's hair, holding tightly, then dropped one hand to the back of Sherlock's neck, squeezing lightly. He felt Sherlock pushing his hands under the netted material of his high visibility vest, fisting them into the fabric of his shirt and pressing against the small of John's back.
"Let me check with Sandra, but it should be fine," he replied, shooting John a wicked grin. "I'll let you know."
"Or you could use that genius brain of yours and figure out how they got a body in and a body out without being seen by any of the street cameras, and without being recorded by the parking gate."
That came as a surprise. He and John met each other's eyes again, nothing but startled shock passing between them.
Sandra straightened again but instead of letting her move away, Sam wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed his face against her stomach. He felt her hesitate a moment, then wind one arm around his shoulders and lace her other hand into his hair. He inhaled deeply, breathing in her scent, and just stayed there holding her for awhile.
The hand in his hair tightened again, convulsively, nails scraping over his scalp, and Sherlock arched up.
He'd made John shout today – but in hurt and anger. The sound of John yelling at him rushed back to him, drowning out everything else. Sherlock hugged arms around himself and leaned forward even more, staring the floor, a small moan escaping his lips. He wanted to curl up and not move, but everything here reminded him of John. The sights, the smells, the lack of sounds. Each breath made him inhale John's scent in the bed and seared his lungs. His eyes stung and he squeezed them shut, refusing to give in.
But he disliked the sense of being watched, and disliked the idea that the decision about that had been made for him, without his knowledge.
Absurdly, he realized he still had his wallet and his phone. He could just call Sherlock. He wasn't aware he'd been moving but there was a smooth pressure on his chin suddenly, gloved hand forcing his head back, searing the raw patch on his skull to the wall.
"It's because you were bored out of your tree and Greg's probably sick of answering your whiny texts."
It was stifling, being able to do so little about it. Under normal circumstances, he’d have solved the problem by now – lack of resources or motivation was hardly an issue, but the police were sniffing around, and Lestrade had somehow gotten ahold of the case.
There was the obvious emotional connection, of course, but it seemed to go beyond that, to something approaching a visceral awareness. Which was absurd.
He snapped his eyes open with a gasp, startled by the sudden press of darkness surrounding him, by the lack of wind and the sensation of warmth that was focused on his left shoulder. He exhaled sharply, feeling a nauseating sense of dizziness as the world tipped and dove before righting itself so quickly it left him reeling.
John shook his head, grinning at the sentimental foolishness that he'd never share with anyone else. John had plenty more jumpers and Sherlock had stolen his old bathrobe years ago, which John had never protested. He found little outlets for his need for small, familiar things, and this was one of them.
Sherlock moaned when John darted the tip of his tongue out to taste salty skin. John chuckled, not bothering to chastise Sherlock when the detective dropped his head against the back of the chair, breathing hard.
John realized he was distracting himself by letting his mind wander and by unconsciously counting each slow step as they ascended, feeling a stab of anger at the sudden tightness in his chest, the shallowness of his breathing.
"Why this, why now?" Sherlock muttered to himself, stretching his long legs in front of him. "It's obvious why Laurence, but why wait? Why delay? The timing must be important – it always has been in the past."
Sherlock led them upstairs and into the flat. Sam took the dog off of her lead, which appalled the detective, but the animal stayed sitting while the agent removed his jacket and hung it up. The dog sniffed the air and looked up at Sherlock.
"You're saying no one could have found it," John asked, half a question, half a disbelieving statement.
It had made him feel somehow better the night his mother had died and the sensation had rushed back, that inhalation of nicotine and relief.
"I'm sorry, but we don't know who they are. You walked to the hospital but we're not sure from where. We're working on it."
"How's Jo?" John asked and Tricia grinned. He hadn't seen his niece since the previous week and he hadn't been in much of a state of mind to enjoy her company, although he thought he'd faked it well enough. It had helped to simply play with a three-year-old girl for awhile. He'd even read her a story and put her to bed that night before staying up and talking with Tricia. Henry had left them be for which John was grateful. He didn't feel like dragging his problems out in front of everyone.
"Yes," Irene replied, sipping her tea, pleasantly surprised to find it very much to her taste. "But not very well, I'm afraid. She was closer with some of my friends from back then – Sarah Brennan and Lucy Collins."
Sherlock stared at the screen, willing it to jump to life with a reply, calculating the time it would take for Lestrade or Amanda to get here, what would be needed to hack into the area's CCTV system.
And hadn’t, for example, gone partway across London to tell off her boyfriend for having her followed by some very effective and apparently invisible bodyguards.
John had also spent a good part of the conversation this morning talking about travel – at Mary’s gentle prompting, of course. He couldn’t come out and simply say he knew something about Sherlock’s past, and wouldn’t, not to her.
"Now what?" John demanded. Hands bound and mouth covered, there was little he could do to explain he'd been hit on the head, and Donovan wasn't about to take pity on him. Sherlock risked a glance up, grey eyes darting over the other officers.
"As far as we know, Mary has no reason to suspect Bridget won't keep her confidence. But you're assuming Mary knew about this before Bridget did."
"What do you want, Sherlock?" Sam snapped, unable to shake the irritation. Sherlock looked tired. Good. Sam was tired. He wanted a decent night's sleep. He wanted an apology for having been summoned to a crime scene where he didn't need to be. He didn't remember the fall, but he remembered bits and pieces of being in the hospital afterwards. Mostly what he remembered from that was pain.
"You would," Sherlock interjected blithely, as if John risking an entire hospital's worth of patients wasn't an issue. It bothered John that Sherlock was right – but it shouldn't really surprise him, he thought. He'd shot someone to save Sherlock after knowing the detective for a single day.
"And it's not at all possible that he has good reason to travel to London on a regular basis? It's hardly a suspicious activity."
was to the Yard, with its perpetual hustle and bustle, and Sherlock had been rehearsing the entire operation in his head, planning for every contingency and measuring precisely what he could use against Lestrade – information ("blackmail", John would probably call it), wheedling, bribery, concessions.
"Which of the many reasons would you like to me give as an answer?" Sherlock asked in reply. John's lips twitched but there was no humour in it.
"I don't see why not. It's done on a fairly consistent basis and involves high levels of cardiovascular exertion and endurance and flexibility when it comes to dodging obstacles and bullets. Not to mention that I have a very active sex life, and medical experts have noted the cardiovascular benefits of that."
He put down his cup gently, but kept his good hand encircled around it, keeping something small between them that Sherlock would see as familiar and normal.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, half wondering if Gabriel knew that when he was really angry – and only ever with Sherlock alone – that hints of his childhood accent came back, little ragged chips in the elegance he'd cultivated over the last decade.
"If you're bored, do an experiment. You don't need to steal toys from a four year old girl. You have plenty of your own."
It had taken years. Four years, to be exact. A few of them had escaped to the far flung reaches of the world, hoping to go unnoticed by those scouring the globe on his behalf, but they’d been thorough.
, the one thing at which he truly excelled, that set him apart from the seething mass of humanity with whom he had to share the city, then he wouldn’t have sent John spiralling over this cliff, terror swallowing the reality that Sherlock was fine (now), that nothing untoward had befallen him.
Shock at the reality, at being able to stand when confronted with a body – real, warm, smelly, shaking, weak, but somehow holding them up.
He felt a smile tugging on his lips at the thought of Sherlock a moment before a hand closed over his mouth and an unfamiliar voice murmured in his ear.
very good at what she did, and neither John nor Holmes had any reason to think she was anything more than Mary Morstan, a part-time nurse with a mundane personal life that would hold no real interest to two men in a relationship with each other.
"And looking at a computer screen is going to tax me into a relapse?" John asked, lips twitching into a wider smile.
"Liam," Doe said again as if trying it out. His gaze drifted away a moment, turning to nothing, then he looked back at John. "They said I said the name John when I came in. If I'm Liam, who's John?"
“Oh Christ,” John managed, and folded in on himself, sinking to the floor, one hand gripping the counter as if it might keep him up, or perhaps as some sort of lifeline. Sherlock had crossed the kitchen and crouched down in front of John almost before he was aware of moving, far more focussed on his partner’s body than his own. John was breathing hard – too hard, beginning to hyperventilate, shoulders heaving, hands shaking visibly.
John drifted awake just enough to catch Sherlock's low tones reaching him from the living room. Through the small opening in the door he could hear two murmured voices – one Sherlock's, the other Mycroft's.
He doubted John was home yet, even with the time it had taken to explain the plan in detail to Gabriel. Sherlock checked the tracking app he had on John’s phone, unsurprised but somewhat disappointed to find John was still at the pub.
"He was selling it to the Woman, which meant it was valuable - not the information about Mary's relationship to Georges, because then Mary would have known about him. Something professional is the most likely scenario."
"Relax," Dominique said, earning a slight scowl that clearly had no effect, because Dominique's grin only widened and he refused to relinquish the food preparation in exchange for the baby. "You're doing fine."
"Modesty is not my concern, John," Sherlock said, putting a light pressure on John's jaw and turning his face. He tilted his own head down, brushing his lips over his husband's. "I'm simply not inclined to share you."
"Hi, Sandra," he said gently. He'd always had one of the kindest voices she'd ever heard. Even when he was exhausted in hospital with Sherlock, he'd had warmth and compassion in his voice. "How are you?"
"He remembers a grand total of four things: snow, lights, the name John, and the name Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock found himself annoyed with that development; it was clear from Gabriel's expression and posture he hadn't spoken to John about the event, but it felt like a sneak attack nonetheless.
"I know you're not that naïve, Doctor," she snapped. "They hadn't spoken to us but you can bet they're speaking to their lawyers. Who are themselves probably RIRA members. The message will be passed on. I'd rather get him out of here before one of them decides things are calm enough to act."
He had to hear it, John told himself, shouting his partner's name again – and again and again, forcing himself to be louder each time, until Bridget caught his arm, fingers digging in, silencing him with a hiss.
"Let's get you into the bath, shall we?" he asked. Sherlock scowled but gave a curt nod. John called the nurse to unhook Sherlock from the machines and the IV, then helped his partner to his feet. Sherlock deigned to suffer John's help getting into the tiny bathroom, casting an angry glare at John as if the small bathtub was somehow his fault.
"Maybe," John conceded. He knew it was highly likely – but there was an off chance that Sherlock was right. Maybe Doe was wearing it as a cover. Or maybe he was just wearing it as a ring.
Sherlock sat patiently on the couch, resting against his Union Jack pillow, so worn now that it was really threadbare, but he refused to get rid of it. John didn't bother fighting it; everyone had to hang onto something, even a man like Sherlock who derided sentimentality in others. He had kept that paramedic's blanket for years, until John had finally put his foot down, when the thing had been little better than a duster. He went through bunny slippers about one pair every year to year and a half, refusing to budge, to just get a normal pair for about the house.
A deep breath let him refocus, tuning his hearing to the silence from Sherlock that meant deduction at too rapid a pace to speak. He turned his attention back to the walls, seeing colours and patterns repeated. He photographed them, wondering if they mattered.
"John, I don't want anything to do with the NHS," Sherlock said, ignoring the paramedics altogether.
"Sometimes," John said. "Look, I– I was with women all my life until you. I guess I'm functionally bisexual but really, Sherlock, you're the only man for me."
"If you came here to start a row, Mycroft, you can just leave," the doctor said. "We've got a case, and we haven't got time for whatever guilt trip you want to lay on him right now."
John redoubled his grip on Sherlock's hands the instant before they twitched and managed to hold his husband back.
John sighed gently, close enough to his partner that he felt his own breath come back to him, brushing his lips.
"Fine," Sherlock muttered, consenting to let John up, rolling onto his back and tugging the sheet more closely around him. He enjoyed the view as John padded out of the room, then pushed himself to his feet with a small scowl, slipping on the dark brown dressing gown.
Sherlock was used to treating his body like a punching bag, but that wouldn't stop reality from catching up with it.
John made some small acquiescing gesture, as if to suggest that it might help, and Sherlock swallowed a disgusted snort.
"No. You," his partner said firmly. John grinned, pushing himself up to rest on the generous pile of pillows.
John paused, lips pursed, drumming the fingers of his right hand against the wall where the corridor arched into the living room.
The detective shifted his mug to his right hand and repeated the C4 motion Sam had made. For a moment, the younger man stared at him blankly.
Sherlock's hand tightened hard around John's and he swallowed as if steeling himself. John could see him struggling now and glanced quickly at the nurse, who had seen the same thing.
The police had felt it, but like a body became aware of a virus – only after the infection had taken hold, and scrambling to offset something they couldn't quite identify.
, he mused – her capacity to command any space as her own certainly hadn't, and was assured now as it had been the first time she'd strode into his office with the promise that he'd lose his business if he continued interfering with hers.
"Well," Sherlock said crisply, making sure his tone boarded on annoyed, "you know about this now – and you certainly know John won't allow me to take the medication again, not without his permission and not without him administering it. If at all."
John knew how much it hurt, too, that first bit of recognition that things were not going to change, that this was real and permanent. He tightened his fingers in Sherlock's hair the barest amount and squeezed Sherlock's other hand tightly. The detective returned the gesture lightly, little more than the subtle pressure of his fingertips against John's skin. Then he lowered his head more, resting it carefully on John's left shoulder, shifting his legs so they were tucked under his body. John dropped his right hand to the back of Sherlock's neck, kneading the muscles there gently but deeply.
all of your facts and we didn't find anything either. Someone knows who murdered Healy, but it isn't me."
they'd found the cabbie, he'd died in that empty college classroom – why were they looking for a cabbie? He'd thought it was an ex-Canadian special forces soldier. Was he moonlighting as a cabbie? He thought about the moonlight – the kitchen often caught it but their bedroom didn't…
John Watson was Holmes' biggest pressure point, but hardly the only one. The others rotated around him in a close orbit, their appearances in his life predictable in their own ways. Holmes was a man on the look out for talent even in the most obscure places. Certainly that was how he'd found John.
John was home when Sherlock arrived, immersed in the small, boring chores that Sherlock disdained – there was a reason he had money, and he could so easily pay for everything to be taken care of, but John took some sort of pride in doing it himself. It meant fewer strangers in the flat, something that John appreciated, and that Sherlock often had occasion to, as well.
Before Wales, he hadn't given Sherlock's thoughts or feelings about her any consideration, and wouldn't have worried about it if anyone else had brought it up.
It was maddening and terrifying. When he was uncertain about how to approach some problem that involved the tricky and sometimes tiresome puzzle that was human interaction, he asked John for advice. On those rare instances when he needed to know something about John he couldn't deduce on his own, he asked Tricia.
"It's a body," Sherlock said out loud, displacing all reactions. "Excellent physical shape, particularly strong thigh and calf muscles but not at the expense of the rest of his body – a runner and a cyclist. But not exclusively. Training. Calluses on his feet – not just on the soles but sides of the toes and the heels – used to wearing shoes and boots for some kind of physical activity. Calluses on the hands, too, palms and fingertips – climber. Autopsy will reveal a very healthy cardiovascular system," a glance at Molly, who gave an automatic nod. "Richard Douglas – the
But there were other benefits to being Sherlock’s partner (many of them, John thought with a quirk of his lips), including the fact that Sherlock loved to experiment with sensation and had a particular fondness for blindfolding John and making him use his other senses.
Sherlock was silent, expression shuttered, darkened around the edges but wary, as if holding himself apart from the topic. Or reluctant to broach it further.
His breath caught as his lungs constricted, a shock of cold coursing through him. The first two had been– what? A warning? A clue? A taunt?
"Everything all right, Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson asked, stepping into the hallway, looking up at him. He glanced down, acting as though he were surprised to see her there.
"I want you to taste of champagne," John said, the gleam in his eyes rooting Sherlock briefly to the spot.
He told himself over and over that John was coming back because he'd promised he would, but he couldn't control the twisting fear that John would realize that it was just easier not to return home.
She followed the trail of information until its end, making a few more mental notes about the discrepancies. The painkillers Holmes had been prescribed following the initial surgery were stronger than necessary for the scale of the procedure. It was possible that Stamford had provided them at Holmes’ request, but Mary doubted it. There was no reason for them, not unless something else had happened, like an infection, but the notes about the post-op antibiotics gave no indication of that. Holmes also didn’t strike her as someone who indulged in that sort of thing unless he really needed to.
reminded him of the night before, and he intended to remember that each time Sherlock wore it. And each time John took it off him.
Given the opportunity, everything struck at once – exhaustion, thirst, hunger, confusion, isolation. He leaned forwards, dropping his head between his knees, inhaling long, slow breaths through his nose until the worst of the dizziness cleared.
With a smooth movement, Sherlock pushed himself to his feet, glass clanking gently against the coaster when he set it down.
John felt suspended there, the temporary floor shuddering under his feet, a chaotic contrast to the faint brush of Sherlock's breath on his skin.
"Hmm," Sherlock hummed, and John felt a tiny shiver go through him. "Well, as you said, I am a genius."
They didn’t know, they couldn’t know, and if he never thought about it then the world couldn’t touch it and make it true. He’d put it down, so far down it was almost not there, covering it with other thoughts and sensation, letting it sleep because sleep was best, undisturbed, not gasping for air as it drown or clawing at him as it climbed back up, settled and quiet, but he could feel it stirring now and he
He had short, curly light brown hair and when he finally noticed them and turned, grey eyes that matched Sherlock's own met his gaze. Sherlock heard John gasp softly but only raised an eyebrow slightly. It took a minute for the boy to figure out who they were, but Sherlock had recognized his mother in those features instantly.
"I was ready half an hour ago," Sherlock replied coolly, which earned him little more than a raised eyebrow in response.
Liars, pranksters, attention-seekers, story-tellers, the delusional. Ranging anywhere from people who had nothing better to do with their time to those who genuinely thought they were helping and desperately wanted to do so.
"All those times since the crash…" John said, arching an eyebrow. Sherlock's features relaxed, but guardedly, as if he were waiting for some other shoe to drop.
"It wasn't hours and there was almost no crawling. We need to get to the Yard. Someone deleted a large number of messages from Douglas' email account."
Sherlock supposed if he'd turned his own genius to music, he'd have accomplished the same thing. But there was no real exhilaration there for him – it was genius on a level that reached the masses, the bypassed intellect and appealed directly to emotion, but beyond that, there was no challenge to it. No triumph.
John kept a tight lid on the urgency, focusing only on the immediate task at hand. He didn't call up to Bridget – she could clearly see the beam from his flashlight headed in her direction, and he'd rather keep his presence unannounced for as long as he could.
He tugged and lifted lightly and managed to manoeuvre his sleeping husband up and onto the couch on top of him without waking Sherlock. The detective sighed and shifted and John repressed a wince – Sherlock was flopped almost entirely on top of him. John managed to adjust their positions so that he was more comfortable and worked his left arm between the back of the couch and Sherlock's body so he could rest it on Sherlock's back. He'd probably still lose all sensation in it, but at least this way he wasn't entirely pinned.
"To save your bloody life!" John shot back. "Because you were too bloody stupid just to ignore that stupid cabbie and his stupid game! I do
Mary liberated a pen and notepad from a desk drawer and began trying skip combinations, jotting them down and crossing them out as she went, aware that the time she was dedicating to this was time away from other more important things.
But they'd at least found the cabbie and had rounded him up. Sherlock let his eyes flicker over the driver through the one-way glass before he entered the interview room. The man was in his early fifties, of Indian descent, and obviously irritated that he'd been pulled off the job. He was scowling, not in the manner of someone on the defensive because he was surrounded by police officers, but in the manner of someone being inconvenienced.
He pulled his own phone out, checking to see if Sherlock had texted, even though it was far too soon for that. The silence inside deepened, accentuating his awareness of being here, alone, without any purpose, and John turned on the television, finding the loudest and brightest programme he could.
His eyes narrowed as disbelief coursed through him, pushing out the sudden despair and denial, leaving him feeling weak, lightheaded, almost giddy. His hands shook and he fought to steady them, using years of medical training to do so, the effort seeming more demanding now than ever before.
Their lives had been so separate for so long that John had felt vaguely as though he'd been invading a stranger's privacy by looking through her photos.
It ended naturally, both of them revived and refreshed at almost the same time. She didn't mind leaving her personal clients still too content to move when there was nothing else to be done, but it was always gratifying to have a client who could pull herself together as quickly as Irene herself did, and Katherine was a client to both of Irene's professions.
"Come here," he said. Sherlock looked startled, taking half a step toward him, then hesitated again. "Come here," John repeated.
, he thought at some blurred, distant image of Moriarty. A clumsy hand on Sherlock's jaw turned him enough for John to kiss him, roughly and demanding, the tremors that ran through his husband's body at odds with the ferocity with which he kissed back, teeth digging into John's lower lip, a hand pressing on the back of John's head to keep him there.
John hurried to keep up with him and when they'd left the building, Sherlock hailed a cab, holding the door for John. His husband looked at him, puzzled.
He waited in his doorway, watching Marian climb the stairs to his flat. She smiled up at him, one hand trailing along the banister, moving a bit more slowly than she used to.
John sighed in his sleep, stirring slightly, and Sherlock held himself still, waiting for the moment to pass. When it did, he shifted himself across the cushions, moving carefully to avoid waking John or jostling his bad leg.
It made John unhappy too. It hardly took an observational genius to see that, but it rooted itself somewhere in Sherlock where he couldn’t dislodge it, no matter the rationalizations he applied to it.
Sherlock shouldered the bag with a pointed look and John relented when he remembered that navigating the stairs even unencumbered right now was tricky. Sherlock followed slowly behind him without a word – it occurred to John that Sherlock wasn't just company, but protection.
It could have been them. Another time – or even in another place today – it could have been. There wouldn't be this, John packing idly while Sherlock lounged on their bed, reading and pretending to ignore the fact that there was work that needed to be done.
John accepted the help – moving about was getting more difficult, pain radiated often from his hips and back, up his spine, down his legs. He could usually get around it, but standing up from seated was the hardest. And he was nowhere near as young as he'd once been.
There was a cigarette burning gently between the index and middle fingers of his right hand and an open pack on the blanket beside his left.
John had no idea what had become of Riley's flat, whether it was still technically his or not, but before Morgan had left, she'd delivered some of his clothing. John had unfolded a few of the shirts and held them up for Riley to sniff, but it hadn't triggered anything. He wouldn't wear one of the shirts, insisting he didn't like it – John had no idea if that was a memory or a newly formed opinion.
John would count himself lucky if his husband didn't turn up with a sword cane, or one with a skull for a hand grip. Knowing Sherlock, it would be both, and the detective would (rightly) point out that he was skilled with a sword, making it both practical and useful.
"I don't think we ever believe the person we love could leave us. Not really believe it, not deep down. Because leaving someone you love takes a lot of courage." She paused, then continued, her voice gentle but firm. "John has a lot of courage, Sherlock. He went to war in Afghanistan."
Sherlock passed him the photographs. There were three, each taken from a distance, probably on a phone, he thought, because they weren't zoomed in.
He collected them the way they collected secrets; keeping them close but hidden. They expanded his homeless network but weren't necessarily a permanent part of it. Most of them had enough resources – financial and personal – to move around as needed, without arousing suspicions on either side of the law.
She would have to go very carefully; even with Jim safely tucked away in a secret prison below London, pursuing this could create problems.
"Bet she never talked to you like that when you were her partner," Donovan commented, coming up behind them from the security cordon.
"And someone about five-ten, five-eleven," Sherlock said, standing beside Holly. "Look here, the pen marks are less certain at the top of the letters than at the bottom, indicating he had to reach because–", he held up a hand without touching the wall, "this would be a comfortable starting point for someone my height but the bottoms of the letters are smooth, indicating he was reaching less at the point. Anyone taller than him, closer to my height would show an opposite pattern. Same thing with the drawing of the houses; he starts at a comfortable height and has to bend over to draw the bases, so the lines are somewhat rougher. Right handed, yes, I think you're correct, because there's no smudging, although– John, could you do this without smudging?"
"Besides, I'm in good hands. At least, I want to be." Sherlock lifted the duvet and John raised his eyebrows.
Donovan sighed, taking another sip of her coffee, then rested her arms on her knees, staring at the small, nearly empty courtyard. She wondered if it was hard for Lestrade to be here; even though there was only one other person out there with them, huddled in the lee of the building, she could still smell the faint scent of cigarette smoke. She generally avoided the place because of it, but it was private – as private as anywhere in the Yard could be, anyway.
Sherlock huffed again, but the sound had a consenting note to it, and John recognized it as compromise, Sherlock Holmes style. He’d have some fuel in him, at least, and he could collapse after the case and sleep for over half a day – or he’d submit to at least a few hours if he reached John’s fifty-two hour limit.
But he wasn't the only one. A man who owned the media had to have eyes everywhere, and Sherlock felt them on him now, like insects, even if he was only imagining it. He'd done nothing to draw Magnussen's attention to him, but he knew full well that was meaningless. He was Mycroft's brother, he was worth his own fortune, he traded across the world with people worth even more than himself. All of those facts were true, the public face covering the private.
"Yes, but–" Sherlock managed, voice slurred and reaching his ears as if across a large gulf, more aware of John than his own body, the tufts of dishevelled dark blond-silver hair, lines of tendons on his neck, warm smell of bed.
He'd asked Marian if maybe Gabriel was dead, but if those things hadn't happened, Sam Mitchell as he was now would not exist. A week ago, he would have embraced that idea and longed for it. Now he wasn't so sure. He pictured Sandra again, checking Sherlock's concussion, smiling across the gurney at him.
Sherlock cut him off with a growl, anger flaring in him, tensing his muscles, tightening in his stomach.
"Fine," Sherlock agreed, voice drowsy, feeling sleep stealing over him. It probably meant he was in for another pub quiz night, but after three days without John, the prospect of whatever the doctor would plan for them was still appealing.
"And my decision stands," he snapped. "Whatever Mycroft suspects, this is nothing to do with us." Her silence drew another glare. "Is that understood?"
– didn’t understand, hands in pockets, watching intently but without the same kind of awareness, and he had all sorts of languages programmed into
They garnered more attention at the airport that John had anticipated; Sherlock scowled through it – more, John thought, because he had to share his limelight with the doctor, who took compliments about the blog with delight. A muttered word to Sherlock had the detective if not smiling for photographs, then at least not wearing his 'everyone else is an idiot' glower. John dealt with the comments on Sherlock's hair from readers who were tracking its regrowth thanks to the blog, managing to cut Sherlock off before he got out his most incisive remarks.
He nibbled a bit more at the biscuit, eyeing the water critically. Somehow, water and chocolate didn't seem at all appetizing. With an inward sigh, John rose and shuffled into the kitchen to make himself a pot of tea. His phone buzzed lightly on the counter as new text message arrived.
John narrowed his eyes at him and Sherlock huffed in return, refusing to be put off. He was not about to waste his time chasing uselessly after wispy phantom leads.
out of absolute necessity and Sherlock knew it stopped there. No one else knew, not even those closest each of them.
"It is time for work?" John asked, his voice blurry from sleep – he hadn't even realized he'd drifted off. How long had he been dozing?
"Sherlock's an unusual name. But he comes from an unusual family." He grinned again, shaking his head. "It's his grandfather's name on his mother's side. They're keen on odd names."
"Not if you have a notarized letter from her parents!" Henry said in the background as he walked by. "Or if you go by train."
Watson, whenever I plan on doing something completely bloody stupid that no normal, sane person would ever dream of doing," he echoed obediently. "You wouldn't like me normal and sane."
"Are you going to lecture me about being a woman and a mother putting herself in a dangerous situation?" Irene asked, examining the evenness of the mascara she'd just sparingly applied.
If he didn't try, it was one powerful lead not followed and as much as he despised the disloyalty to John, Sherlock could not let that outweigh another man's life.
. You assume it's a wedding ring because it's on his left ring finger. Could be divorced. Could be a widower. He could be wearing it as affectation. Maybe he has children. Maybe he doesn't have children. Maybe he has a spouse. Maybe he doesn't. You don't know because
No need for explanations – Broward had barely given her a chance to talk. Orders from higher up, he'd told her.
"Well, you wouldn't, would you?" Sherlock sniffed, refusing to take the bait. John grinned, easing himself up to sitting with his partner's help. Sherlock fussed with the sling beyond what was strictly necessary; John stilled the movement by curling his right hand over one of the two fluttering at his shoulder. Sherlock's eyes caught his, almost hesitant, checking for discomfort or pain, but John smiled, moving the palm to his lips and kissing it lightly.
He tried to remember. But thinking about that made him think of their bed that smelled like John and the rumpled sheets and the utter silence in their flat.
"Less than you," Sherlock replied. Another lie, but one that came easier from a decade of polished practice. "As much as she needs to."
Sherlock gave a curt nod, gesturing for Hassard to lead the way. She wasn't about to let him go first, and it was simpler to let her define the path while he focussed on the details – repeating patterns on the walls, the bends and curves in the tunnel as it circumvented other structures unseen and unknown. Access tunnels for the tubes, most likely. Sewers, utility pipes, basements. The pattern was memorized, compared to the original one he'd recorded. No discrepancies found, and no new data presented itself until they were stepping off the ladder into the lower tunnel.
, who had so often worked on no food or drink, who had subjected himself to drugging on a regular basis, for whom this had been normal
"Why not you? I trust you with my life, and my daughter's, and I know you'd do a great job, if it were ever necessary. And Sherlock adores her, and she him. You're a good balance – you could maintain rules with her, and he'd keep her challenged in other ways."
"We need supper," John said with a slight shrug as he draped the jacket carefully over a chair. "And I know you'll eat this. I'm guessing you haven't eaten anything else today. Coffee and tea don't actually count, you know," he added, when Sherlock opened his mouth to protest the nearly inaccurate deduction.
There was a short pause on the other end and he could almost hear Mary calculating whether it was worth a reply or whether this was, in fact, a trap.
"Oh, you boys," she sighed, planting a motherly kiss on his forehead. "No one should think that being knocked around isn't a bad thing. Mrs. Turner's married ones never get into this kind of trouble."
"I don't know yet. I'll call you," Sherlock replied, ringing off abruptly before Mycroft could get another word in, and tossing his phone on the chair, ignoring it when it buzzed almost immediately.
"Your appeal to a god in which neither of believes is irrational," Sherlock snapped. John sucked in a deep breath, pursing his lips. "And your confidence in Mycroft is misplaced. At the moment, what do you imagine he can do? Look bruised at someone?
It was John he watched – or wanted to watch. He couldn't always, of course – there were practicalities like John's work and cases and, occasionally, other people – but there were also moments like this, when Sherlock knew enough about social interaction to realize that staring at his partner would make John uncomfortable and draw attention to them.
The office was better, an utterly silent balm after the temporary chaos of his home. Sunday and no one was in – this wasn't always the case but the necessity of being present ebbed and flowed. Gabriel made an effort when Sandra had weekends off, something which routinely sparked a dull flash of guilt in Sherlock, who was aware that John's weekends off were far more regular than anyone else in his life, yet his own efforts to adjust his schedule had been less than committed.
There was another pause after he'd finished speaking, and Sherlock did glance at John now, seeing the doctor's hands tensed into fists, knuckles white.
Veronique frowned at the call display on her office phone when it rang; a London number, not one which she recognized. She sat down smoothly in her leather desk chair and mentally switched languages as she picked up the receiver.
Since then, Mycroft had been released to Angela's care, which was astonishing in itself. He couldn't imagine Mycroft submitting to being cared for by someone who wasn't a professionally detached doctor or nurse. Nor could he really imagine Angela doing all the necessary chores that came with nursing someone who couldn't look after himself. It was just as well Sherlock had no interest in their relationship – he was unlikely to get any sort of satisfactory explanation for any of it.
He felt worse than he had the day before, like someone had bound him up during the night so that he couldn't move. Every joint was stiff and sore. Pain lanced up his bruised ribs when he rolled carefully onto his side, and even the slide of the cotton sheets against his skin felt rasping and raw. He closed his eyes again, failing to stifle a low groan, and groped blindly for the painkillers that were still on the nightstand.
The purchase of Marianne Maberley’s entire house and her possessions seemed a dramatic step, however, so I ignored John’s suggestion that we go speak to Ms. Klein and returned us to Gables Close, where we discovered the house had been broken into and our client struck unconscious by a blunt object – likely the butt of a gun – to the back of the head. The burglars (two men of approximately average height, given the disturbance at the scene and the way in which Maberley had been attacked) had attempted to find something among Mr. Maberley’s belongings, but had been forced to flee when a neighbour reported suspicious activity to the police.
She was an expert in ensuring that blame fell squarely where it belonged in the rare instances when that kind of intervention was necessary.
"Agent St. Jean," Sherlock said in a cool, smooth voice that dripped English upper class disdain. "Always a pleasure."
"Right jacket pocket," Sam managed and Sherlock nodded. He stepped forward, waited for Sam to recognize the movement, then carefully extracted Sam's keys from his jacket. John nodded for Sherlock to go on ahead of them and the detective closed the space between them and the building with his long strides, unlocking the front door quickly. John moved more slowly with Sam, taking a lot of his weight, somewhat concerned the younger man was likely to collapse again. John was more than capable of hoisting Sam over his shoulders and carrying him but he doubted that would be welcome right now. He'd do it if necessary but didn't want to make things worse.
Sherlock yanked off the blasted safety glasses and clambered over the rubble, moving as fast as he could. He could hear John's harsh breathing as he sought to keep up but didn't slow his own pace. He cleared the worst of the debris and started running, scrambling between two ruined vehicles, nearly tripping on a bumper that lay on the ground, just managing to right himself.
He paused and raised his eyes now and Sherlock fought against taking a step back at the hurt in them.
He padded silently from their room and stopped in the corridor; the door to the office and guest bedroom was closed. That meant someone was there. He stared at it a moment, wondering who their guest was, then decided it was probably Joanna. Sandra had friends she could call in an emergency, but she'd call her sister before any of them.
probably is this time! I mean all of this!" He gestured to the room, then jabbed a finger at Mycroft. "Mary is still bloody
, John said fondly, then subsided as Sherlock refocused, picking his way carefully through the shadows. They'd left the floodlights well behind, torches and headlamps lighting their path imperfectly. Keeping close to one side freed him from the immediate presence of any of the PCs, let him gauge the history scrawled on the walls. The brick and mortar itself spoke of age despite the more recent artistic additions. Beneath those, here and there, he found hints of older inscriptions.
"Yes. If there's anything we think you need to know, we'll tell you. Otherwise, leave it to the professionals."
"He's not," Charles said sharply, nodding as best he could at his son, who was propped against his shoulder, fidgeting and fussy.
"I might just do that," his sister replied, looking up again, giving him a small smile that was genuine around its edges.
John tugged the detective to his feet, feeling a stab of pride at the way Sherlock's legs wobbled a bit before he found his balance. The doctor closed his hand around a wrist, feeling the jump of a pulse beneath his fingers, and raised his eyebrows at his partner, leading him toward the bedroom.
The dead were dead, and Adler might be gone from their lives, but they still had living threats to worry about.
They'd been remiss about changing much of anything down here, and it certainly couldn't be rented the way it was. A few things had gone up to their flat, but a few things had come down, too. Out of necessity, they'd cleared the fridge early on and had taken whatever food they wanted, binning what was open and unusable and donating the rest. Sherlock had moved some of his experiments down to the empty fridge, which gave John no end of relief when he opened theirs and wasn't presented with half-decayed body parts next to the leftovers.
Sherlock refrained from pointing out that Olivia was too young to swim well yet; the Solarshuttle was completely enclosed, and he knew that John would drown before he let his niece do so. And he never would have opted for this activity if he hadn't been granted permission from Angela. Any concerns Sherlock had would be taken as criticism so he merely nodded and said:
Then again, as much as Sherlock would hate hearing it, there were some things more important than him.
"Seven years and you haven't noticed my exercise habits? You really must work on your observational skills, John. I
"I suggest you wrack that inferior memory of yours, Mister Ajid. You're the first person to see our killer and come out of it alive, so it's particularly in your best interests that he is caught."
"You're a show off when it comes to me," Sherlock corrected. John sighed but couldn't stop the grin that spread across his lips.
"A blackmailer," Sherlock repeated. "As in, he coerces payment from his victims in exchange for not revealing delicate information."
Someone else could take what he knew and thought and put a polished point on what Sherlock privately considered rather tedious tradition.
John eventually settled onto the couch, wishing he'd thought to bring some painkillers. To distract himself, he tried to observe the room more closely, looking for any inconsistencies, but either there was nothing out of place here or he wasn't seeing it. He was sidetracked from his attempts when Sherlock came back in, flourishing a handful of photographs.
Add to that the little Sherlock had eaten that day, let alone the past week, and it was no wonder he’d gone into shock.
He hoped so – fervently – because the last thing Sherlock needed right now was his brother intruding.
If it hadn't been for Sam shouting Sherlock's presence to the whole flat, John would have missed the stricken expression; Sherlock would have had time to smooth it over, hide the horror behind a neutral mask.
John was irritated at himself for having noticed that, but trying to shake the realization hadn’t worked. He didn’t actually think Sherlock’s absence had anything to do with Charles – at least not on a personal level – because Sherlock wouldn't be that stupid or arrogant, and John didn’t think Charles would be either.
John crept down the stairs, avoiding the creaky floorboards, and checked Mrs. Hudson's thoroughly before double-checking the locks on the front doors, satisfied that they were shut.
He'd seen Sherlock in a tux before, plenty of times, but he doubted he'd get bored of how appealing it made his partner.
"I know Veronique's here – she stopped by the flat the other day to yell at Sherlock for a bit. And I absolutely didn't find that even a tiny bit amusing, I promise," he said, with a glint in his eyes. "But I didn't ask about Sam. I can guess how he's doing. I asked about you."
“Oh no you bloody won’t!” John snapped back, picking up his pace. “I’ll be home in five minutes. I don’t even want to think what you’d bother packing for me – or what you’d leave out.”
"It's cheating to enjoy my physical activities?" his husband asked, cocking a dark eyebrow at him. "Would you prefer that I do a ten-mile run every morning, particularly if it's raining, followed by one hundred push ups and sit ups?"
"The suit doesn't fit him, not properly, like someone bought it for him but he never had it altered. It's too… big. I think."
Mary frowned, allowing herself to be annoyed by that. At the time, circumstances had drawn her attention away, and she hadn’t been particularly interested in the young British man being held hostage. She’d surmised at the time that the British government had been informed, and she’d probably been right about that – Mycroft Holmes must have known
, he told himself roughly, holding onto the anger. And it wasn't – the doors of the car were yanked open, two men – both strangers – forced out at gunpoint, movements awkward and hampered by hands pressed against the backs of their heads.
The jittery feeling crept up his neck again, and Sherlock resisted the impulse to turn, to scan the crowd for a face he'd never find anyway. Electronic eyes watched from all angles, and who knew who was watching behind them. His brother, certainly – or Mycroft could be, at a moment's notice.
Obviously the target had been Mycroft Holmes, but Mary had no illusions about the difficulty of getting information that he had. He was on alert for her – as well as for Adler, she was sure – and getting past his defences would be risky at best.
His phone chirped at him, indicating waiting texts and voicemail messages. Mycroft frowned. He called up the text messages and found a deluge from both Sherlock and Anthea. Alarmed, he opened the first one from his brother, certain something had happened to John Watson, then stopped short.
It bothered him that her wilderness training had prepared her for this; it was nearly as bad as learning John could drive well in London, too – that still annoyed Sherlock, who considered that driving in a war zone was no preparation for driving in one of the most civilized cities in the world.
"Why doesn't that surprise me?" he asked. The shift in Sherlock's facial muscles meant he was wrinkling his nose.
He kept a snarl to himself, letting it out as short, sharp huff instead, surrounded by the silence of his office. His hand had reached for his mobile more than once of his own accord; each time, he snatched it back, determined not to lose another moment's focus.
John read it three times before comprehension dawned and Sherlock started making impatient noises. He looked up again, some of the frustration draining away.
"Several weeks, I should imagine," Sherlock commented, leading John towards the front of the house. "Or it's been turned on for brief periods of time. Someone's been taking care of this place."
Safe. He hadn't been safe before. Different city, different country, different name. Not this time. He was home. He wasn't alone. He was safe.
"Yes," Sherlock replied in a clipped voice. John ran his hands into his hair, trying to displace the tension and the adrenaline. Sherlock stepped away and John felt suddenly drained.
“Art theft?” he suggested, earning a pointed look in return. “Cheating spouse?” Sherlock huffed a sigh, managing to slump down even further, long toes pulling at the rug. “Missing dog?”
Like almost everyone there, they had endured rumours about them. John hadn't really cared – let people think what they wanted. In the way of any small group whose members were forcibly and necessarily confined with each other, there was talk, there were rows, there were out-and-out battles. But there were also friendships, fleeting, lasting, tenuous, solid. He considered himself lucky – in Tricia he had found a friend he would keep for life, an extended family member who was unrelated by genetics but related in all the ways that really mattered.
"There's fresh coffee," Sherlock said without looking over. John wondered how much coffee had been consumed if he was using "fresh" as a qualifier – but he didn't seem to have the caffeine shakes and was firmly focused on his work.
"Says the man who would happily work in bed if I let him," John said, corners of his lips quirking again. Sherlock huffed but didn't deign to comment – and best if John didn't know that he
it was difficult for John. They were romantically involved. They had been friends for years before that had developed. John had suffered through nine unpleasant but necessary months thinking Sherlock was dead. John had spent three days in Wales afraid he might never see Sherlock again. John was a trained physician who understand the impact severe concussions could have. John had helped save him from a fire.
"Uh – yeah. She asked if I could remember going anywhere else, other shops, galleries, that sort of thing. Why?"
. Or, technically, refrigerated, Sherlock supposed. Kept right around freezing, wreaking havoc with cellular decay after he'd been thawed. Molly's analysis supported the conclusions he'd drawn from the tissue sample she'd provided.
Sherlock checked himself in the mirrors of the entryway closet, confirming what he already knew. Irritation reflected back at him; Sherlock smoothed the expression into his typical neutral disdain, tugging on his cuffs to straighten his sleeves unnecessarily.
He thought about the problem of how to proceed as hit the call button for the lift, watching the button light up under his thumb, catching the faint gleam of his wedding band as he drew his hand away.
Alexandre's impact on her life would have to be controlled. Loose ends were as irritating as they were dangerous.
“He didn’t meet me somewhere posh and glitzy, but I think that’s partly what made me stand out. The rest of his life… It’s filled with the kinds of things you were just imagining. Sometimes it’s like dating a film star, only most people don’t know who he is.”
Sherlock forced himself to listen, to follow the ebb and flow of his partner's breathing, hearing taking the place of sight in their pitch black bedroom. John was on his back (typical for him), face turned toward Sherlock's side of the bed, judging from the sound and the brush of breath on Sherlock's skin as John exhaled.
"I don't know what to say," Sherlock hissed in a low voice, hating the admission but not wanting to waste time. They needed to draw Sam out of this as quickly as possible.
what he wanted, Sherlock would have steamrolled over his objections by pretending they didn’t exist or pointing out how stupid they were.
He pulled the book out carefully, handing the box to John, who took it without question. Sherlock opened it gently, mindful that the cheaply produced paperback was half a century old, and read the faint inscription in his mother's handwriting.
not talking about the speech," Sherlock muttered over the rim of his tea mug, the warning glare only serving to make Gabriel's grin wider.
John sighed, wishing he had a free hand to run over his face. It was right up Sherlock's street – three crimes rolled into one, not to mention a double locked-room mystery.
John only ever addressed serious questions if he thought Riley was awake and strong enough to take the answers – more often than not, he'd nudge the conversation in a different direction and the injured man didn't seem to notice. There were still times when he fell asleep while John was talking, but they grew fewer. John would end his visits at the first real signs of fatigue, leaving Riley to sleep, and coming back later in the week to continue their conversations.
"Oh," the other man said, nodding slightly, still looking confused. John gave him a reassuring smile as he pulled out his phone and notebook and shuffled one of the chairs next to the bed. He called up the photos from inside the pub and of the surrounding area, then passed his phone to Doe. The injured man looked through them slowly, a faint frown of concentration on his features.
Because he wouldn't say – he didn't want to, lips pressed tight, but the words were there, hovering; he swallowed against them but they were too light, like air, lighter than air, and Sherlock wanted them, but he'd tell,
"I can't," Sherlock lied. Sam glared at him and flopped unceremoniously onto the couch at the other end of the room, chewing on his lower lip. Sherlock gave himself several more minutes to warm up, to re-adjust to the sensation of the new violin. It was as similar to his old one as a modern instrument could be – he knew John had paid a lot of money for it to be so. But there were still subtle differences in weight and balance that he had to relearn if he did not play it on a regular basis.
It was the lack of choice, the way Sherlock blithely bent the world to his liking without asking what John wanted.
There was a silence that stretched between them that John didn't try to fill. He watched the lights on the tree. A few of them here and there were burnt out, needed to be replaced. Sherlock would probably have been able to tell him precisely how many.
Sherlock stopped abruptly and John felt himself react slightly – a slight twitch in the muscles around his eyes, a little stronger than a blink – at the sudden silence.
“It’s–” he began as Sherlock released the door behind him, letting it swing closed to cut them off from the street.
"It's best not to rush good champagne," Sherlock pointed out. "And you're the one who insists I be patient. Now it's your turn."
He didn’t care, Sherlock decided. Neither of them could reach the other before their target had time to flee. He wasn’t armed, and he was alone.
“Someone has made a very stupid choice,” Sherlock replied. “We’re going to do what we’re best at, Gabriel. We are going to fix it. And
"But telling you when not to do it?" John asked, and the question froze his partner as he began to move. "Since when do you let
"Hmm," Sherlock said and the sound reverberated in his chest so that John felt it shudder down his spine and settle into his groin. Sherlock's fingertips began to trace back downward, maddeningly slowly. "A not altogether unpleasant prospect. However, since I'm here and you're here, we may well take advantage of the situation. I'm fairly certain these curtains do close."
"Someone didn't think it was necessary to do any research beforehand," John muttered, and Sherlock managed to look at least a little abashed – although the doctor doubted it was genuine. He'd probably get the blame later for not doing the background work. It
"So did I," Sam replied, a hint of hardness in his voice. Marian's lips twitched into something resembling a smile that didn't reach her eyes.
"Still, if I consider everything else I can do with relatively ease... perhaps I wouldn't be so hasty to make the trade for that particular skill."
John nodded at the hotel across the street, refusing to relinquish his hold around Sherlock's waist.
worry about it when you're keeping illegally obtained medication and using it without any oversight,
The doctor pushed himself to his feet, crossing the room to sink down beside his partner, who stiffened and pulled back when John dipped his hand into the pocket of the blue silk dressing gown. Grey eyes flared a warning John had already read, and he held up Sherlock’s phone as reassurance before scanning through his email.
her this time. John let himself feel a momentary flash of relief before supressing it, turning away.
John fell into step behind Sherlock – something he'd always done, but after the crash, it had become necessary, lending support when it was needed, ready to catch the detective if he lost his balance. That had never happened – thank god – but John hadn't given up the habit even when Sherlock had been able to put weight on his injured leg with the help of the crutches.
"A word with my brother if you don't mind, John?" Mycroft asked. John cast a questioning glance at Sherlock who nodded. He saw the look of displeasure flash across John's face but the doctor stepped outside, shutting the door gently behind him, and Sherlock heard his footsteps retreating down the path.
There was an empty mug and an empty bowl beside the sink, a spoon lying forlorn in the basin, stainless steel against stainless steel. Sherlock stared at it in dismay; he almost always made breakfast for John, but had overslept and John hadn't woken him.
Sherlock didn't answer, expression distant again, but more briefly this time; he rounded on John so suddenly the doctor started, trying but failing to contain the reaction.
“Let’s have it then,” Lestrade sighed. Looking legitimate wasn’t the same was being legitimate, which both of them knew well. “And pass that nutter file off to some PC wasting his time,” he added, nodding at the folder. “We both have better things to do.”
He kissed Sherlock again, gently, keeping them there, unhurried in the warm darkness. John wasn’t alone in the way his body was reacting – he could guess at the increased heart rate by the faint stirring in Sherlock’s groin, and if he’d wanted to take it further, he’d have slipped a thigh between those long legs, giving Sherlock some friction.
“And a hotel,” Sherlock continued as if John hadn’t spoken. “I’ll send you a name; who knows where you’d put us if left to your own devices.”
John stayed still, reluctant to wake Sherlock. He knew this was partly because he didn't really want to have the conversations they needed to have, but also because Sherlock desperately needed the sleep. John couldn't tell how long his husband had been out – he had obviously shaved that morning and his clothing looked fairly fresh, so he'd been awake at some point. He was wearing the purple shirt John loved so much and black trousers with matching black shoes and socks. Sherlock had been expecting – something. John just didn't know what. Had Sherlock known he was going to come home? Or had he been preparing just in case?
Watching everything made him feel dislocated, like an out-of-body experience or unrelenting déjà vu. John wrestled the urge to take charge of Sherlock's care himself as the detective – fully unconscious now – was hooked to an IV line and less obstructive oxygen tubes, as the bleeding was staunched and the wound stitched shut.
Sherlock found himself at a loss for words again and John was looking at him with an even brown-eyed gaze but there was still hurt there, and so much disappointment.
John was still dressed, having swapped his short-sleeved button down shirt for a t-shirt, but still in jeans, feet bare. He wouldn't disrobe any more, Sherlock knew, not now. No matter how uncomfortable it might make him. John left the door open, his concession to his clothing, and probably in no small part to let the chill become slightly uncomfortable for Sherlock, who was wearing nothing at all.
Sherlock turned abruptly and took one stride toward the couch. He bent down in a fluid motion and slung John's right arm over his shoulder before straightening and effectively pulling John up with him. John staggered slightly at the sudden change in position then found his feet. Sherlock gave him a cool look and led him to the bedroom, letting John slump to seated and crouched down, pulling John's shoes off smoothly.
Sherlock huffed a harsh sigh, dragging himself to sitting but refraining from hauling himself out of bed. The way his vision swam with small, silver flashes was a good enough indication that if he got up, he'd be going right back down.
Sherlock inhaled slowly, deeply, using the moment and the oxygen to kick his brain back into high gear. They needed cleaning up – this was hardly the ideal way to have this conversation, messy and half undressed, but there was something that needed to be said first. Sherlock took John’s face in his hands, as John had just done to him, but carefully, without any demands or fury.
"I didn't know there was a charge for this," John replied, catching Sherlock's chin between a thumb and forefinger, kissing him again.
Her world was ordered, a control she dictated and imposed. No room for those who had lost their usefulness, no concessions for those who trod their own path rather than hers.
, John thought, suppressing the urge to shake his head, keeping his expression clear through years of experience dealing with post-op patients.
John exhaled slowly. The twitch of Sherlock's lips told him the detective had picked up on his increased heart rate.
He wondered if he could pretend he wasn't home. The light was on in the kitchen, but it might not be visible through the living room windows. He pursed his lips in displeasure – it wouldn't matter. Sam had managed to get Mrs. Hudson to let him in once before, there was no reason he would not do so now. But perhaps his landlady was home, though? No, Sam could have Interpol trace the location of his mobile. Sherlock supposed he could shut it off, but Sam could also just call John and find out where he was.
John thought, then blinked himself awake fully. He shifted then groaned, wishing he hadn't moved as his stiff muscles registered their protests.
"Keep out from underfoot," Sarah warned him. "And leave the diagnosing to us, please. We know what we're about."
Whomever Jim had spoken of could wait one night. Sherlock glanced at his watch again, reflexively, and picked up his pace for home.
"It can probably wait a bit," John agreed. Sherlock pushed himself to his feet and disappeared into the bedroom, returning with the water and the ibuprofen and a pointed look. John took the pills before finishing his tea and toast. He was grateful Sherlock hadn't mentioned going to a hospital – Mycroft had probably tried to insist upon it, which meant the discussion was off the table unless John brought it up. But nothing was broken, even if he would be moving slowly for the next several days.
"Let's go," John replied. He gave Bridget a final glance and a curt nod; she didn't hesitate before vanishing into the smoke, moving quickly without the burden of Sherlock's limp weight.
He kept them there until John's lips were swollen, until a flush coloured his cheeks across the bridge of his nose. Sherlock moved down, kissing everywhere, filling the room with the scent of vanilla and the sound of John's moans.
There was a knock on the door just as Sherlock was coming up the stairs, so John tossed his wallet down. Sherlock joined him a few minutes later, putting the takeaway bag on the counter.
Riley was fast asleep when John slipped into the room and neither the quiet click of the door being shut nor the sound of John's footsteps disturbed the injured man. John checked the IV line and the machines with a practiced eye before claiming the chair next to the bed. Other than the slow sound of Riley's breathing and the faint hum from the fluorescent light overhead, there were no sounds in the small room. It was as empty and sterile as it had been the first time John had come to visit. The only small personal touches were the books John had bought. There were no other get well tokens.
"Did she indeed?" Sherlock murmured, skimming through another series of David's photos, able to actually see the lions he'd intended to photograph, and making a note to check up on that.
Sherlock closed his eyes, took a deep breath. Gave the office back over to Beethoven and let himself go, trying to find a path he knew was there but could not yet see.
John nodded and felt Sherlock's gaze drawing his own back. He sighed and met the detective's pale eyes in the darkness.
She just smiled, her blue eyes glinting, and unwound the towel from around his neck before hanging it back up. Sam stole another kiss then ducked out of the kitchen before she could retaliate, heading into the living room of their small flat. A nap might be welcome, actually. He eyed the couch which looked inviting and then glanced toward the bedroom, frowning. If he went to bed, he'd probably fall asleep for the rest of the day and he was trying to avoid that. Not just for the obvious reason, but because he needed to get back into a regular sleeping pattern after the murder of that Welsh MP, Brace, late Wednesday night. Falling asleep fully now would mean being awake in the middle of the night.
"Well, then," Sherlock replied, letting himself slouch down a little more, snuggling closer to John, listening to the warning pangs and twinges that kept him from positions that would be painful, "they'll just have to wait a little longer, won't they?"
He was supposed to help. He was supposed to be able to do something. He was supposed to prevent death.
, he thought, because she was too determinedly sunny – but then again, she was may just have been enjoying herself immensely.
"Thank you," Gabriel replied. "We're both looking forward to it." He paused, giving himself a natural break to change the subject. "How are you finding the job? Are we treating you well enough?"
Mindful of his ribs and his tendency to get dizzy, he rose and ordered a taxi before rummaging around for a bag, aware of Sherlock's gaze following him carefully. He selected some bits out of pile of presents he'd received from colleagues and patients, picked up the remains of the tin of biscuits that Mrs Hudson had made them and added some HobNobs to the mix. He'd received a couple boxes of fancy tea he wasn't fond of either, and put those in the pile. Sherlock was still watching him – John knew that penetrative grey eyed gaze even without seeing it – but he kept working, going through their cupboards, pulling out a package of unopened chocolate HobNobs.
He was used to exasperation from the Met when it came to Sherlock, but there was none of that captured in her expression. It struck him that while this might be a game for the people behind it – and even to some extent to Sherlock, despite everything – this wasn't for her.
John kept quiet for a moment, hearing the faint rustle as the phone was moved and, presumably, held to Sherlock's ear. He could hear Sherlock breathing, more rapidly and shallowly than a sleeping person should.
," Sam purred, raising the pitch of his voice slightly, softening it, adopting a near perfect Irish accent. "
But even that felt false – Sherlock was normally never disoriented when he woke up, as if the part of his brain that processed and analyzed information never completely shut off.
It didn't take long to clear the closets and the drawers and put everything into black rubbish bags, but when John was finished, the bedroom seemed hollow, unable to absorb sound the way it had been before he'd begun. One at a time, he took the bags to the common hall, dumping them near the door to deal with later. Old wood creaked and moaned beneath his feet as he climbed the stairs to the first floor again; John locked the flat door behind him and escaped to the cocoon of downy pillows and blankets that was their bed to shut out everything else with sleep.
Sherlock sighed, eyes darting away for a moment, then back. He gave a curt nod. A proper diet was important to John – it had to be, otherwise he wouldn't spend so much time harping on it. It therefore followed that Sherlock's physical appearance based on said proper diet was also important.
Getting him out of the flat was an odd struggle – he was wont to do it at random intervals, when he remembered that leaving would frustrate Mycroft's surveillance. To say their relationship was complicated to begin with was an understatement; now John wished he had a map to navigate all its shifting moods and nuances. He'd never seen Mycroft so genuinely concerned – terrified, really – for his brother's well being, but finding out Adler was alive had sparked something in the elder Holmes brother that had led what would have been – for anyone else – a shouting match.
He thanked Gerald and dismissed him for the night, declining the offer assistance carrying up the new suit Pierre had sent to his office that afternoon. The thought of someone accompanying him any further was more burdensome than the garment bag, and Sherlock rode the lift up alone, grateful that none of his tenants had managed to time a trip with his.
"Just reinforcing the point," John replied. Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes but John gave him one of his sharp Behave looks.
,” Sherlock stressed, shifting his stance slightly to emphasize the hint of menace in his tone. It wasn’t something he used against his own people often, but it had its place, and he needed to bring Gabriel to heel. “Whatever this is, I want you no nearer to it than you absolutely have to be.”
"We coulda done a lot worse," a voice told him. John tried to focus – the second voice. The one who'd done the hitting.
, he snarled at himself, the flare of anger doing nothing to dissipate the edge of tension, making it sharper instead, so much so that a familiar sound – John's footsteps, so welcome under other circumstances – made muscles tighten, put him on the defensive with another shot of unwanted adrenaline.
"No?" Sherlock replied, his eyes darting back. "No, perhaps it's not. But nor is it fair that you simply left me without a word for two days. Yet you did. And now you're upset that I didn't contact you when you made no effort to contact me."
"Good. Take care of yourself, Sherlock. And of John." She turned to walk away, leaving him with an unerring certainty that this was the last time either of them would see her.
"Most people have aunts and uncles who aren't reated to their parents," he said. "That's what Uncle Lock and I are. We'll always be your uncles, no matter what. We both love you, very much. We always will. Nothing will change that, Jo, not even that your mum isn't my sister. All right?"
John jerked away abruptly, violently, and there were hands on his face before Sherlock could react, pulling him into a bruising kiss. Sherlock nearly lost his footing, struggling to keep his balance despite conflicting reactions at the sudden intensity, the shock stifled almost immediately a stab of lust that burned across his nerves when John growled, a primal, predatory sound.
Now it wasn't deliberate – not on Jim's part. Sherlock never told more truth than necessary, but Jim was no longer playing. Following the twisted, knotted strands of conversation took time now. Separating fact from fiction was one thing – separating fact from madness was quite another.
Fingers laced into Sherlock's hair, tracing downward until John could run his thumb along Sherlock's jaw. Sherlock parted his lips obediently, and John eased himself in, setting a shallow pace. The hand in Sherlock's hair kept him still, and he could feel John holding himself back, almost losing control when Sherlock made use of his tongue.
"Or if you'd seen an actual doctor about this," Gabriel added. "How long has Irene been giving you drugs?"
"I thought–" John began, shutting his eyes for a moment then reopening them. "Sherlock, I thought you were doing better. I know it's been a hard few months, but–"
John's voice sounded in his head and Sherlock closed his eyes, taking a deep breath against the impotent frustration.
unusual was how much he felt it now that he’d properly resurfaced, with the familiar sense of dislocation at finding himself in his office, sat behind his desk, mind still abuzz from the paths it had been racing down, the hidden corners of the world it had been exposing.
He glanced at Sherlock who was looking impassively out his own window. Anyone else would have seen precisely what the consulting detective wanted them to see: a calm, unconcerned man, vaguely bored, waiting for the cab to drop them off. He'd given the cabbie their destination in a casual tone of voice. Nothing in the set of his muscles or the way he spoke indicated any kind of tension, but John knew him better than that. He could see it in the spark of those pale grey eyes, the almost imperceptible tightening of his mouth. No one else would have spotted it, except perhaps Mycroft. But John spent a lot of time looking at Sherlock's mouth – not to mention doing other things to it – and he hated seeing it even slightly tense.
He managed to get his keys back into his pocket, slumped against the wall, breathing hard. He wanted to sink down but sitting down now meant not getting up, it meant falling asleep with his head still bleeding.
"I think you've got most meticulous man all locked up," Molly said, and there was a pause before Sherlock looked up, as if the words needed a moment to register, but then there was a smile – a real one, unexpected reaction to an unexpected comment – and she felt like it was the first time she'd seen
"Yes, you mean you!" Sherlock snapped, his voice sharp with anger. "You told me to take the case for you and you told me to stop. You've made it quite clear that this is about you, John."
, he told himself. That was a lie. It meant something. It meant more reason to never have become involved in this in the first place.
"Obvious, really," Sherlock said. "You've been clearing your throat all day – it might have been an indication of nervousness at having my family here, only you didn't stop doing it after they left. If you were ill, with a cold or something more serious, the hospital wouldn't permit you to visit. Being a doctor, you're inclined to be more cavalier with your health, but you wouldn't compromise mine – although you
He had on his fatigues, his pack strapped to his back, his helmet resting heavily on his head. He could almost feel the red cross patches stitched to his sleeves.
"Good morning," Sherlock replied, keeping his tone smooth, playing off what he knew very well to be one of John's weaknesses. He closed the distance between them as John pulled his jumper on.
"They do drive on the right here, you know. And you can't just decide not to because you're British."
She certainly didn’t need to help him. Even without John, Mycroft would have had someone round him up within an hour.
John raised an eyebrow in response but forewent pointing out that so had Sherlock – mostly because the books (which belonged to John, of course) had been pitched across the living room and the plotlines decried as the predictable offerings of a simplistic mind.
"It is right now," Sherlock said, dropping the words like a hammer, broking no more argument – from either of them.
"No," he whispered, then cleared his throat. John, ever cognisant of a patient's needs, circled the bed and helped him with a glass of water. The victim's gaze moved to John curiously. "Who are you?" he asked.
However much he wanted to deny it, Magnussen's name had sparked much the same response in him, and there were traces of his own reaction to Mycroft's request in Jim's to his. Not entirely the same, but Sherlock had no reason for unpredictability (although it was certainly tempting with his brother).
"Let's get you out of these, shall we?" he murmured, dispensing with Sherlock's belt, tossing it on the bed before going to work on trousers and pants. Sherlock shuddered when John skimmed his fingers over the damp spot, flattening his palm.
"What does?" Sherlock demanded, but the sound of quiet fussing from the monitor distracted Georges' attention.
"Leaving for some space isn't the same as leaving for good. It doesn't have to be. Not if you don't let it turn into that. Both of you."
John felt a little guilty – surely today wasn't going to be an easy one for him, with an undoubtedly annoyed Gabriel waiting for an explanation, but it didn't stop him from pleasantly wishing Sherlock a good day as his partner stepped out of the flat.
he was able to tell us that it was a woman who rescued him – he couldn't see her very well, it being dark, but she had a flashlight and it was enough for him to see she had short dark blond or light brown hair. And she spoke to him in French."
"No idea," Sherlock retorted, hovering in front of John as if to keep him from trying to stand again. The doctor fought down another wave of amusement.
And from what Sherlock had remembered and described, which had in no small way helped those spearheading the hunt.
Sleep had eluded him; whenever he closed his eyes, he saw John's face with that deep hurt and disappointment, and it made him bite his lip as if that could keep everything inside or erase it. He could feel that he'd worried his lower lip enough that it was raw and cracked, but didn't care.
He raised his eyes toward the low ceiling. A descent from the lofty office with its view of the city, a careful movement down into a small, underground space. One victim had stood on the top of the world, the other had moved below it. In death, Sarraf had climbed to heights he hadn't in life.
They had been there a week and John could feel both of them relaxing into one another's company again. He felt more at ease around Sherlock and felt less like being married was a distant and troublesome concept rather than real relationship. Sherlock seemed more himself around John too – he was down to his regular levels of energy when not working and John thought he was slowly letting go of the McKinney case. The doctor knew that wasn't gone, not while the man was still out there. It sat just as poorly with John that their unknown killer was walking free. As of Angela's last update, which had come prior to them leaving for France, neither she nor Mycroft had made any progress identifying him. John had wondered then if maybe Sherlock had been right – maybe he was the only one who could catch this man.
"But Mycroft's people aren't Mycroft," he continued. "My brother wouldn't part with information like that. Other people would."
The sound of the buzzer made Sherlock grumble into his pillow. John left him in bed and clattered down the stairs, wondering who it might be. Most of their friends would have called before coming over. He thought it might be for Mrs. Hudson, who almost never heard her doorbell anymore. John was going to have a serious talk with her one of these days. She needed a hearing aid. He was beginning to worry she'd miss something serious, like the smoke detector.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, looking shocked, as if he didn't believe John was actually there. He licked his lips quickly – a nervous movement that John followed automatically with his eyes. He felt a jolt course down his spine when he realized that simple motion that Sherlock probably was barely aware of making stirred desire in him, making his lips twitch into a bare smile.
He hadn’t mentioned to the solicitor’s assistant that Richard Mitchell appeared to have surfaced; all Gabriel Mitchell knew was that this had something to do with his brother’s case. Fresh evidence.
"Potential client," Irene corrected. "Ours, not mine. I do believe she has some merchandise she'd like to move – very discreetly, of course, and for as large as sum as possible."
When John began working on Sherlock's right hand, the detective finally dozed off. John arched an eyebrow but this didn't come as much of a shock. He knew Sherlock was still tired from the past couple of weeks and he was a sucker for having his hands massaged, even if he didn't usually have the patience for anything else. The first time John had done that, Sherlock had watched in astonishment at the sensations, wincing occasionally as John worked out knots in his palms and the fleshy muscle beneath his thumb. The detective had said afterwards that it was immeasurably helpful in warming up his hands and relaxing them, which helped his violin playing.
"Eight and a half pounds in five days? I doubt it, Sherlock, even if all you ate was sweets and fatty foods. It doesn't need to be by Friday."
The thought made him smirk, the expression changing into a smile when Sherlock strode in, glaring at the office as if daring it to offend him.
," he said, raising his eyes, narrowing them as he met Sherlock's gaze. "You knew, didn't you, Sherlock?"
She took over the cooking for the most part, because she was better at it than he was and she enjoyed it. He took on the washing up without being asked. He made the effort to get on with her family, something that no one since Nicholas had really done. If he was going to be late because of work, he called or sent a message.
"What opportunity?" John interrupted, his own patience unwinding. "Christ, listen to yourself! Sending a letter that
John eased himself down on the couch. Sherlock looked over at him, grey eyes still bright, still windows into a mind that John couldn't keep up with even on his best days.
It was simple enough to load those off onto Gabriel when the younger man was here, but an ocean away and on
And if he could find that connection, it bore very careful consideration about what else he might find.
One day, John thought, it might stop surprising him that Sherlock seemed to have a flat of his own in every city they visited.
He had just wanted to go home. Sandra had been waiting for him when he'd finally finished after what seemed like an eternity. She'd brought him back to their flat and he'd been grateful. He'd wanted to do something – help out with chores, talk to her – but these desires seemed distant, as if they belonged to someone else and he was only hearing them recounted, not actually experiencing them. He felt like he was floating, like he wasn't quite all there, but he wasn't sure where the rest of him was.
"Coming inside?" John asked. There was a pressure on the cushion behind Sherlock and breath against his neck and ear as John leaned against the back of the outdoor sofa.
"Well, Robert always had a very high opinion of himself, so maybe this is not so much of a surprise. But why would someone kidnap him? Do you think it's tied to us? Our family I mean?"
"If you had no worth to her, she wouldn't have read your blog post and I wouldn't be here. There'd be no point in killing you."
"You returned to London three years ago as an Interpol liaison officer. You are here in the Yard today for a series of meetings with senior police officials. I'm uncertain as to why – you refused to tell me. You had concluded your meetings and were on your way home although you had arranged with John that we meet with you and Sandra at a pub later this evening. I suspect you mentioned this to John because he is more likely to agree to banal entertainment than myself."
The sergeant examined their identification and let them pass. Sherlock saw John's gaze linger a moment. Did he miss this? Was he experiencing nostalgia or simply accessing memory? Sherlock couldn't tell and the realization made him suppress a growl – his attention was needed elsewhere.
Mycroft met them at the front door and Sherlock evaluated the house upon stepping in. A couple in their late fifties; married thirty to thirty-five years judging by the style of dress in the framed wedding photo that hung on the wall. Still married, given that the picture was still on display but a bit dusty – they were used to seeing it and used to giving it no thought. He thought suddenly of the framed wedding picture that sat in his flat on the small table beside the couch. How long had it been since they had cleaned it? He resolved to do so when he got home.
But John didn't brush his hand away. He didn't do anything to encourage the touch, but he didn't push it off, either. Sherlock let out a silent sigh of relief and lay awake, listening as John very slowly fell asleep.
Sherlock knew that too – John had felt that realization when it had first happened, almost too far gone in a panic attack to understand it, but not
"Not a public space either, John. Somewhere in between. Private property but not precisely private space, not yet."
As a doctor, Sherlock felt John should have known better than to wake him at such an inappropriate time in his sleep cycle.
"Call Irene," he repeated, dimly wondering if it was intelligible because John's brown eyes were clouded, lips half parted, shaking his head, confused, almost frantic. Sherlock wanted to say something else, reassure him, bring back the expressions he loved on John, not the ones that knotted his stomach, but the world slipped out from under him and he couldn't help but close his eyes, surrendering it, distantly amused when it occurred to him that at least now, he would get some sleep.
It wasn't exactly a lie, not entirely. If really pressed, John trusted Sherlock to make the right choice. He'd learned his lesson.
Lestrade nodded sharply and strode away. John turned back and gestured for Sherlock to keep talking.
"He's that missing man from Paris! It's been all over the news there – I may not live there anymore, Mister Holmes, but I still have family there and I keep up with what happens. And yes, at it happens – ridiculous as it sounds – I
John pushed himself to his feet, shooting Sherlock a pointed look that was, as usual, completely ignored, and beckoned to the potential tenant to follow him downstairs. He showed the young man – whose name he hadn’t bothered to remember – dutifully around the flat. Given Sherlock’s assessment of their visitor, John wasn’t really surprised that there were no exclamations of delight at the space or the lighting.
The documents were enough of a distraction when they came through – Arnaud hadn't been overstating her husband's organizational skills. Were all writers this organized? Certainly John wasn't. Under different circumstances, it might have been baffling but wading through a sea of papers wasn't unfamiliar. Hassard made a pointed comment about printing at the taxpayer's expenses; John reminded her they both paid their taxes. She rolled her eyes, refusing the stack that was pushed her way, said she had work of her own she had to do. Duty. Responsibility.
Sherlock waited an appropriate amount of time – just over two hours – before clearing a small space in his schedule without alerting anyone to the change. It was the work of a few minutes to ensure that his mobile line and the one he was dialling were secure – that knowledge and technology hadn't come cheap, but had been sufficiently modified that if the seller had been interested in hacking in, he would have found himself sorely disappointed (and the subject of intense police scrutiny in very short order).
Besides, they'd spent enough time sleeping apart recently and John wasn't keen on doing so again. It wasn't particularly restful for him, but he also knew it helped for Sherlock to have the additional body heat when the fever gave him the chills. He curled up against John and the doctor would wrap himself around the trembling detective. It made it easier for Sherlock to sleep, which was what he desperately needed.
The meeting had felt longer than normal. He recalled telling Telle everything he could remember, but he was still fuzzy on many of the details and he knew the timing was rubbish. Most of it made no sense; it wasn't a structured narrative but rather a mess of images and impressions.
"Do suggest that to any of the producers you meet tonight – it would make an excellent film. We could make millions. More millions, of course."
Lips and hands drifted over newly exposed skin until their clothing was puddled unceremoniously on the floor next to the bed. John pressed his thigh between Sherlock's, hands sliding against the detective's back to pull him closer. Sherlock whimpered, biting down on the sound as his eyes fluttered closed. John let him thrust once or twice, dragging his teeth across his husband's Adam's apple, then pulled away to reach for the lube.
And the leeway before John finished work and returned home would give Sherlock time to think of something – something believable – to explain the situation to John without actually telling him the truth.
Later that year, she started dating Michael Davenport, who didn't try anything until she snuck into his house one day when his parents were away for the weekend.
"England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom. Ireland is independent. Sorry, this probably isn't making much sense to you at the moment…"
"How long do you keep the security footage?" he asked, pointing at the camera behind the register. The woman smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling.
"Careful," the doctor admonished. Sherlock just huffed and settled down again but kept his eyes open. John watched him carefully – they'd spent a lot of time the past four days curled up together, mostly because it made Sherlock feel better. But they hadn't done a lot of talking other than Monday evening and part of Tuesday. In a way, John was glad to get some space from it – he didn't want to hash it out endlessly any more than Sherlock did, but they couldn't avoid it forever. He had no desire to fall back into old patterns and let this happen all over again.
It was about half the size of their flat in London, which might have been reasonable if they'd lived there year round or spent significant amounts of time there, but given how infrequently it was used, it still felt like something of a waste to John.
John flipped the file shut and put it back in the drawer. He’d walk away from this, he decided. He’d trust Sherlock.
The detective who had flown over to interview them certainly hadn't missed that connection, but persistent questioning – Sherlock's persistence, not the French officer's – hadn't paid off, and without any actual responses or information, nothing he could deduce did more than generate more questions.
"Portland doesn't look so kindly on keeping alcohol stashed with your personal effects," she replied with a grin.
"Right now? Not that badly," Sherlock replied. He raised his left hand to weave his fingers into John's light hair and the doctor turned his head enough to press a brief kiss into his palm.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, filing the information away, crossing off one mystery: why Douglas and their now-identified mystery man had never been spotted together. Similar signatures left on the body from similar activities that went in entirely opposite directions.
It frustrated her, the connections seemingly obvious on the surface but not nearly as deep as they should have been. Adler had wanted to step out of the limelight, and Holmes had needed someone to take over his Irish base for him.
"Based on Georges not knowing about her, you conclude she doesn't know about him? Dangerous and simplistic, John – for all we know, she's known about him his entire life and has something to do with all of this."
"Down!" John shouted, dropping into an awkward crouch, dragging Sherlock and Alexandre with him as he went, fighting to keep them steady when Alexandre nearly lost his balance. He curled himself over Sherlock's upper body, foreheads almost touching, wincing at the crash behind them and the sudden crackle and spike in the heat as the fire fed off new oxygen.
"Because he vanished shortly after Sergeant Healy was killed and we had no information on his whereabouts. Not even John Riley knew where he'd gone."
It annoyed John too, especially now, that Mycroft would keep them waiting when someone's life was at risk.
He wasn't surprised that his mother's sister, Adele, was there, but he was surprised at how upset she appeared. She stood on Mycroft's other side, with her children, Victoria, Elizabeth and Dorian – Sherlock remembered their names this time. Dorian and Mycroft were of an age, but time and perhaps lifestyle had been kinder to him – he hadn't lost any of his hair, nor did he appear to be contending with a constant diet. He was not so tall as Sherlock, but equally as pale, with the same grey eyes but blond hair. The women were blond as well, so that Adele would have stood out among them, had she still had her dark hair, the same hair Sibyl had had, the same hair Sherlock had, but she had gone pure white some time ago. As her sister had.
Sherlock felt a wave of gratitude towards Gabriel, who had clearly managed this disaster, if the regular, informative emails that now filled his inbox were anything to go by. Of course, that was part of why he paid Gabriel, and he had no doubt there would be some minor fires to put out the next day when he returned to the office, but nothing that was cause for serious alarm. Some clients would be inconvenienced, as well as a couple of what, in another profession, Sherlock might consider his peers. But clients were easy to handle with solicitousness and concessions (one he always made sure seemed costly to him but weren't), and the queens and princes of Britain's underground knew better than to push him too far.
A deliberate misdirection then, a poem that appeared romantic or yearning but was nothing of the sort.
They hit the ground floor without being able to see it, both of them collapsing as muscles tried to keep carrying them down stairs that weren't there. John grunted, just managing to keep Sherlock from hitting the floor as Alexandre lost his hold on the detective completely.
"My daughter, Élodie," he said, bouncing her gently as he reclaimed his seat. The girl squirmed a bit, reaching for the floor; Georges set her down and John watched, bemused, as she plucked a toy at random to clutch while staring at them.
"Oh yes, dear, sorry. You never know these days what people want, do you? Come in, come in. And please, call me Claire."
"Deep breath!" John snapped, captain's tone rooting itself in Sherlock's body again. "Hold it! Now exhale, slowly. Slowly, Sherlock. Again. Look at me.
"We're keeping you under watch and that will continue until we're satisfied that you're safe. We will get to the bottom of this, John. It's our job. In the meantime, you should sleep. If you remember anything, you can tell the nurses or the constable outside and they can get contact me directly."
Lassalle came back, passing her phone to Sherlock, who passed it to John to note down the email address. If Amélie had stopped using it, its utility would be limited to them – but it was better than nothing.
At this, Sherlock deigned to look up, arching an eyebrow curiously. He stayed silent and Lestrade sighed.
Sherlock put the phone on the bedside table and changed out of his clothing into his pyjamas and dressing gown. At least in these, he felt less conspicuously thin, even if he did feel lethargic while wearing them. John had taken good care of his pyjamas, laundering the cotton ones regularly and refusing to let Sherlock wear the silk ones while he was ill and sweating due to the fever.
But first and foremost, he thought, he was her uncle. Tricia was as a good as his sister, and they had both lost siblings. He a sister and she a brother, so they stood in well for each other. He loved her in a way he'd never loved Harry, because it included liking her. He knew this wasn't fair, but his relationship with Harry had never been fair, not really.
John huffed, sitting back abruptly in his chair. Sherlock ignored him with some effort, following mental flickering pathways, getting side-tracked and turned about.
John deflated somewhat, tension ebbing out of his muscles – but not nearly enough. He took a deep breath, held it, and released it slowly, repeating the action, catching Sherlock's watchful glare, and the cautious approval.
"The doctors feel you'll be well enough to be released by the end of next week," Angela said, setting aside the file she'd been reading.
Then hands again and something softer. Sinking in. Groan – appreciation and pain. Can it be both? Dizziness again, blue and gold spots against the lights.
He was working on the kitchen four days after the flashback when Sandra came in and leaned against the wall, watching him. He glanced over his shoulder at her and smiled – he knew it wasn't very convincing but he tried all the same. She looked weary, her arms folded loosely over her stomach. He was cleaning the cupboards, pulling everything out and wiping down the shelves.
John grinned again, a hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck pulling him into another kiss. Sherlock made a small noise of protest when John pulled his left hand away to undo his own jeans. He wrestled the lube from Sherlock’s fist, breaking the kiss to grasp the small tube between his teeth, expression intent, eyes gleaming, as he freed them each from their pants.
"You talk too much," Sherlock growled, lacing his fingers into John's hair; John braced himself against the push that never came, and he smiled, rewarding Sherlock by nuzzling him, inhaling a familiar but long-denied musk. Hands skimmed back up, brushing Sherlock's balls, thumbs pressing in lightly. Sherlock inhaled sharply, the quiet sound somehow loud in the silence of the flat, shooting straight to John's groin.
He swallowed a reply, wondering how often Morgan suspected that Riley had murdered Hayes. If he had, had it been pre-meditated? Had he tracked his former RIRA-mate to London? Or had it really been a dislike of living in Manchester that had brought Riley here to find Neil Hayes accidentally?
"She is," Claire agreed. "She wanted to stay here but got such a good offer there. Works as an executive assistant, you know. She says she enjoys it, bless her, but it does keep her busy."
And he'd been taken unawares too recently. Granted, it hadn't been in broad daylight in front of the Met's headquarters, but still. Someone might forego the risk for expediency if they thought his guard was down.
he shouted at his mental image of Sherlock, anger flaring hard before he was able to wrestle it under control, to smother the panic and the sudden adrenaline need to do something.
"And make sure I never see them again," he added, his voice suddenly like ice. "Because if I do, I promise you, no one else ever will."
"The personal reminder and the symbol suggest a strong emotional attachment – even if the heart is absurdly sentimental – and someone you enjoy remembering. A close relationship given the fact that you've only used an initial; a romantic attachment is most likely. Names beginning with 'M' or 'J' are the most common in English, so 'M' itself is not a surprise, and likely a common name. Someone you've been seeing for a not insignificant amount of time but not long enough for the relationship to become engrained, or else you wouldn't have bothered with the heart. Hiding in plain sight. You aren't worried about people realizing you're in a romantic relationship, but aren't confident enough yet to commit the name to writing, not in potentially public view. Matthew, perhaps? No. Someone you've mentioned before, in an attempt at a casual remark. Michael."
"That's still not what I meant, though," he said. "Do you remember what you said to me about her, after it was all over and she'd told you that you'd never see her again? You told me she wouldn't come after us, but that didn't mean we couldn't go after her."
John waited a moment then sighed, shifting in his chair, rubbing his left hand over his face, his wedding ring gleaming once as it caught the light when he moved. Sherlock stared at it, wanting to sit down but also not wanting to move.
Brown eyes meeting his in the darkness, through the light that spilled out across both of them, but the gaze was blank, unreturned, recognition stamped out in a moment of furious sound.
“Before my time,” John said firmly. “I was in Iraq. I would remember having one of the princes in my hospital.”
The glass was plucked from his fingers; Sherlock opened his eyes, watching John set both of them aside.
Mycroft was probably already concerned about Sherlock – he wouldn't have failed to notice that his younger brother had lost an alarming amount of weight in a short period of time. And he'd have been able to spot how little Sherlock was sleeping. John really hoped Mycroft kept his mouth shut about that, too. Sherlock wasn't going to listen to pointed comments and so-called advice from Mycroft and John didn't need anyone making it worse at the moment.
He braced her against his right arm, getting her to lean back as much as she was able, which wasn't much given the post against her back to which she'd been secured. That was going to make it tricky to pull her back from the edge, but John set his jaw, refusing to think about it.
"Coffee's already being made," she replied reasonably, rummaging through his fridge and cupboards. John watched her carefully, looking for any reluctance in her expression that hadn't made it into her words.
Sam let himself in, moving assuredly. Sherlock felt a stab of surprise and raked his eyes over the Interpol agent who was evaluating him with the same quick appraisal. Sherlock thought that was inappropriate; that was
He set his jaw, half wondering if he was being led astray. She had no reason to tell him the truth, but he had every reason to follow her – if she wasn't lying, she was his best chance to finding Sherlock before anything else happened.
The detective made a low noise, almost a groan, as John increased the pressure. Eyes fluttered shut and John made a tsking sound.
"Mary," John said bluntly. Surprise flickered across Sherlock's features, and John wondered how many people he'd considered and rejected before asking the question.
"I don't know!" John retorted. "She hasn't said here, has she? I mean, unless she sent me other texts that you've deleted for some reason."
“You’re fastidious, but it doesn’t extend beyond the collecting… why waste your time? Friends all the same bent, no girlfriend, visit the family only on holidays or when pressed into it, job is good enough to support your interests without being too demanding or involve too much work with the public. Or with anyone. Something equally as finicky, numbers – accounting, most likely. Not for a large firm. Nothing that would require too much reporting of your time, as long as you get the job done, no one asks any questions or cares too much about your whereabouts. Quiet of course, but your other living habits… cluttered, at a guess – and not much of a guess – not much consideration for anything else, easier not to cook because it takes time and takeaway doesn’t. Workspace kept neat out of necessity, nothing else gets the same consideration. Don’t socialize much beyond your circle of fellow collectors, but aren’t bothered by noise around you – probably don’t notice. Excellent concentration skills, to the exclusion of all else.
"A ring of roses," Sherlock corrected, drawing back from the windows and looking up at the frames with a pensive expression on his face.
He knocked softly on the door, so as not to startle Sherlock if his partner was just drifting off or waking up, and stepped past the curtain to find an empty room.
He closed his eyes, rubbing them with his good hand, half cursing his stupidity. Well, he'd needed to say it, hadn't he? And it was all true, no matter that Sherlock was choosing to ignore it.
"Listen, if you think of anything else – or if anyone you works with knows something you might not – give me a call. We could always use the information."
"You'd do well to remember the number of DIs in the Met I know," he said, then turned his attention to John, wrapping a hand around his partner's bicep and catching the flicker in John's eyes at the intimacy of the action.
"A man with no memory and a connection a twelve year old unsolved murder?" John asked. "You really expect Lestrade to believe you find that boring?"
He would make it evident. Force it into the light and strip away all of the clutter until he got to the core of it.
"How the bloody hell is that important?" John demanded, nearly pushing himself off from his chair, perched on the edge, muscles tense and ready for a confrontation.
"Good," Sherlock huffed, mollified. "Our train schedule gives us approximately sixteen more hours. Tell me, Doctor Watson, what do you intend for us to do with all that time?"
"Yeah, right," Harry muttered, waving her fork at him. "He was dragging you off on a case when I got here."
"I never did find out," Claire replied. "They moved in, stayed for six or seven months, and then just gone, almost overnight. I do remember that – we'd gone away on holiday, two whole weeks, and when we came back, they'd packed up and left. Jenny was beside herself for weeks. I never have asked her if she's ever looked up him up on that facebook."
Amanda gave him a hard look then a curt nod, as if agreeing against her better judgment. She probably was, but John didn't care. He didn't need her permission, he only needed her to stay with Sherlock.
“Did he speak to you?” Lestrade asked, before Mitchell could speak – probably to ask the same question.
There was no time for the flash of triumph that threatened when Bridget's confident expression dissolved – nor to banish all of John's confusion.
"I want to," Sherlock replied levelly and saw the smile that twitched on John's lips and touched his eyes. The doctor reached down and snagged Sherlock's hands. A subtle movement of John's thumb pushed Sherlock's wedding band a bit higher up on his finger, away from his middle knuckle.
He listened with half an ear as Mycroft and Sherlock argued about something. Mycroft probably wasn't giving them all the information but that wasn't surprising. It was Mycroft, after all. John examined the body again but found nothing he hadn't seen before.
Sherlock’s breathing was deep and rhythmic, undisturbed by whatever had shaken John from sleep. The doctor listened carefully for a few moments; Sherlock was adept at feigning sleep but rarely used it against John. Especially at this hour. If he weren’t asleep, he’d more likely be up and working than lounging in bed, pretending to sleep for his sleeping partner’s benefit.
An envelope was plucked off a nearby table and ripped open – John refrained from commenting. Sherlock's eyes skimmed it before he tossed the paper aside.
He punched her as politely as he could, wincing internally as he caught her on the side of her head.
If you're reading this here and only here (not also on ffn) then I need to apologize, because a big chunk of chapter 6 got cut off at the end! I don't know how, but if you thought the transition to 7 was abrupt, go back and reread 6 now; it'll make a
"Nor I you," he said and his voice was verging toward hard, but not out of anger or resentment, John thought. Sherlock was probably still unhappy about John walking out. John didn't blame him – but also didn't blame himself for that. He'd done what he needed to do to keep himself together. But he could admit he should have at least sent a text message or an email or even made himself call once.
Which meant the poem had been deliberately written and posted – John hadn't just happened upon it and put it up to annoy the detective.
He saved his work when he heard the door to the flat open and close, and padded into the living room, unwilling to let John find him behind his computer. The fewer questions the doctor had, the better it would be for both of them.
At this, a smile twitched on Sherlock's lips and reached his eyes. He tried to suppress it, John could see, but it didn't quite work. But he shifted so he was sitting down fully, his legs crossed, his spine straight. John glanced down at his husband but he didn't like this either. He slid from his chair without a word and Sherlock tried to back up a bit,
He sighed and Sherlock's expression pinched into a frown. With conscientious movements, his husband put away his equipment, stowing the mystery specimen carefully and covering the microscope before joining John on the sofa. John smiled faintly at the uncomfortable look on Sherlock's face; he'd never liked giving care in the aftermath of an injury or an illness, but he did at least try. Usually.
