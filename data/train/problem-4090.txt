it does. Whatever situation they find themselves in to make them think that, it’s gotta be one-sided.
The lip of his mushroom dipped and hooked inside, flesh heated damp with desire.
Castiel hums, resettling that summer blue gaze on Dean again. It's intense, but the guy is smiling a little and he gives off a good vibe. Or not-serial killer vibe, at least. Not that Dean would know what that feels like. But the guy's got a presence that's hard to ignore and Dean's met a few folks like that. None like Castiel, but still. It's kinda hard to look away.
without losing his appetite. Enduring overly sappy tales of romance, however, literally makes his stomach turn.
"We did?" Cas had been looking for motel signs, not rest-stop signs.
"Animals don't commit murder."
this―blue eyes catching the golden light of the antique lamp, reflecting it back at him. Not hard, though, not like a mirror. More like water, like pools of water both ancient and new, refreshing and sunwarmed, inviting the kind of swim where he could happily drown but knows he never would.
He ate quietly, enjoying their win. He smiled at Dean smiling at Cas who smiled right back at him—gladness and fondness and shyness and coy little secrets that weren’t so secret anymore. Or ever.
He struggled as the fabric caught on its ascent, trying to keep his balance and free himself from the tangled confines of one too many layers.
"So, Cas." A look of minor wonder accompanies Castiel's head tilt this time, a smile twinkling in his eyes. "Any advice for a first-timer?"
Remembering his phone in his jeans he pulls it out. It was set on vibrate but the quilt must have absorbed the vibrations - either that or he slept so profoundly well he didn't notice his phone buzzing away in his pocket.
“..Glad you're

Scattered among the endless queries Dean has about the supernatural he's been asking Cas about his travels: places he has or hasn't been, things he has or hasn't done or seen but wants to. The Lakes are certainly worth the trip, though he'll take any reason to change course. Fortunately Dean lights up at the mention of it.

He rubs at his temple, wishing he'd brought some Advil, and flicks her an unimpressed glare. She grins and punches him lightly in the arm, signalling the barman for another round.
"So, these things can look totally human until, what? They get the craving for some soylent green?"

Crappy days come and go, with gloom and all the rest of it. But as long as Dean has his family he knows the sun will come out again.
A shotgun fires through the otherwise still night and the scarecrow growls in pain. Someone skids to a stop by Dean's side and cuts his hands free with two swift slices of a blade. "Are you hurt?"
Where words failed, or didn't come, actions had always spoken clear and sincere between the two of them. Cas buried his face in Dean's collar, sighing into the contact, the familiarity, the comfort of good company.
Dean turned Cas to face him, giving him something alive and reassuring to focus on. Palms slipping beneath the shoulders of his coat, Dean shifted it down til Cas worked it off over his hands. Dean hung it on the back of the door and returned his focus to his friend.
hauls him up by the collar and slams a fist across his jaw.
He drops some cash on the table as Emily returns from the back.
Cas considers him, those blue eyes making Dean feel seen in a way that's both alluring and discomfiting at the same time. "No, you're not. You're.."
Sam’s voice was quiet and measured, though he half-expected Dean to spike the volume as he snapped in frustration of unshared, unbroached feelings. But his big brother did manage to meet him halfway and surprise him, from time to time.
"There's something I want to ask you, before we leave."
Feet moving before he decides to risk it, he gets a better view of the scene in the scant light. It definitely looks like a body sprawled out on the pavement and not moving. A noise behind has him whipping back 'round before he can think it's a bad idea.

They both needed this: Cas’ grace needed to recharge and Dean had faced-off with one too many Angels in the past 24 hours, earning him at least a few hours of comfortable unconsciousness.
Sam's just worried he's holding back, that he's afraid to get back into writing instead of just not wanting to. Maybe he could try writing about something besides love but he'd rather spend his days getting in some quality one-on-one time with the automotive beauties that end up in his capable hands - hands to be gladly smeared with grease, not ink, surrounded by a mess of tools, not balled-up wads of paper.
with the denial of a sating touch.
Not that they were horrible words. But they were confronting.
His hand submerged beneath the covers and Cas squeaked in surprise, Dean's fingers dropping from his mouth.

Not that those things aren't memorable in their own right, but there are a few that stand out a little more in his mind (for

felt like he was wearing someone else's clothes, living in someone else's skin. He loves hunting, loves his family, and at the very least has an appreciation for the funded support and security their life afforded them - especially after hearing what the other Winchesters have had to contend with. But at a certain point one may take stock of their life only to realise that the person in the mirror, however familiar, is also alien, somehow.
"--It's a scarecrow," they say at the same time.
There's no forgetting some folk though, those people you meet who you just want to spend more time with and you don't even have a good reason why, it's just a feeling.
Five minutes later he emerged, flicking off the bathroom light and pulling the door half closed behind him.
Dean's no wilting flower. He went all-state with the wrestling team his junior year, John taught him and Sam all all those Marine Corps combat tricks, and thanks to his healthy love of Westerns Dean's a self-taught wrangler with any makeshift lasso.
The moon is hidden tonight, as are the multitudinous stars of this galaxy - a favourite among many Angels throughout the eons. However, given the events of recent times, Castiel suspects he may be one of few Angels who prefer it over other galactic creations primarily for its housing of one particular solar system, which bears one particular planet, upon which a very special species makes its home.
"It's a god."
of mechanics. You would have worked on one of the vintage vehicles in the garage and he would have gleamed with pride when it roared into life.
Whatever bad air threatened to taint their friendship, Dean revered what they shared too damn much to let it fall apart, to give up on it all. He may have been mad at Cas for his reckless behaviour, but they would find a way to work through it. They always did.
No one could compare to Cas. Every sensation his body elicited was heavenly, sinful, worth living and dying and killing for.
There are three things that travelled with him through that portal that he knows are worth keeping, because they are real: his love for his brother, his love for his long-deceased mother, and his love for a lost Angel.
"Did not!" Sam gives him that:
Dean plunged in slowly, tips jutting in a little deeper with every idle thrust, a corridor of slick internal muscle contracting around him in intervals, seeking volume, seeking friction, unconscious in their want.

Yeah, that’s―” a quick glance around the small confines of the hatchback - grey felt all over, no personal touches, clean but bare - tells Dean this car probably isn't the reason why he gets it.
- at which point Dean conceded, if only to spare himself a scientific rhetoric, adding the

And all was forgiven. Because Cas did save their lives, afterall. No matter what mess became of his good intentions, Dean was glad he and his brother—and their mom—were still alive. He was glad Cas cared so much.
Only he found something else.

He tosses the dish towel in Sam’s face, buying just enough time to turn and lunge around his giant torso and tackle him to the sofa - where Bones immediately takes up residence, stretching out on top of Sam from neck to knee (a move well-learned from his dog-bro) and proceeds to lick the grump off Sam’s loser-face. Or maybe he's trying to paste a smile onto it? Who knows, but those dogs are now two points up in Dean’s book. Revenge can be a beautiful thing, especially when a new ally is gained (so maybe Dean doesn't totally hate them).
“..Dean?”
And that was the risk. That was the question.
feel that way."
Dean thought he was a loser before they met, but that'd be nothing compared to the loser he'll be if Cas turns him down.
Wally burned like St. Patrick’s Day. Something in that barnyard gasoline colored the flametips shamrock-green.
"Yes."
“Hey―” he whacks Dean's hand away.
"Interesting name."
He lets his gaze resettle on Castiel, Dragon Rider
“I was on the road a lot, uh.. motels, new cities.”
It sounds far away but gets clearer as he tries to focus, tries to breathe deeper and unscrew his eyes—just the one, actually.
? And he was just waiting for someone to come along that would channel that stuff for real, not just as a mess of over-eager adolescent feelings.
His hearing isn't so quick to follow. The background noise of the world comes to him garbled and muted, like he's underwater. Maybe his eardrums have burst? Before he can think to panic about a possible non-temporary loss of hearing, the watered distortion thins and the sounds dry out.
Hoping, but not knowing, feeling his love for this man singing in his veins, heart-strings thrumming out a tune just for Cas, composed

; track three:
Dean has never been more grateful to hear Eileen’s beautiful voice, syllables rounded and booming at one of two Golden Retrievers currently licking his joy away.
Castiel proceeds to remove his coat and bundle it over one arm. "Since I am forced to be here against my will, It would be nice not to add insult to injury. To dance with someone who will not expect more than what I am capable of."
The nickname he's got no excuse for, it just kinda slipped off his tongue. Cas doesn't seem to mind though, a gentle smile gracing his features as he spares a glance over at Dean, nodding once.
And then, being the giant goofball that he is when he's nervous about a girl, Sam had tripped over his own shoes when Dean had met him for coffee near the courthouse. While trying to avoid looking in Eileen's general direction, Sam actually ended up bumping into her and spilling her double order of iced chai all over the floor. Dean caught the frown at her lost beverages morph into a smile directed solely at Sam - a bemused thing - as he bumbled his way through an apology, totally red-faced as he proceeded to stain his tan slacks with milk and ice trying to mop up the mess on and around her black heels with a handful of crappy paper napkins.
But Dean wanted something, too: he wanted Cas to
to re-discover whatever's left of him? Forget calling in Death for a quick-fix favour, because even Dean knows some things can't be fixed, can't be undone, unseen.
There are some minutes left in the defrost-and-reheat cycle when the other world's Dean enters the kitchen. Castiel knows it's him before he speaks, before he himself turns around to see.
He's almost at the interstate which means he'll have to hoof it all the way back into town if he can't fix the problem himself, which isn't great since the air is damp and cold and night's gonna fall soon.
But it ain't all bad. The thing about food bringing joy is that it works for more than just the maker. Take Dean’s six year old munchkin, Audrey: she has the remarkable habit of turning every mealtime into an adventure - many of which tend to feel like someone spiked his coffee with the brown acid, but who needs drugs when you've got kids?
The sound of the doorbell is jarring. He's been meaning to fix the buzzer for months, ever since that possum gnawed through the old wires. It's got a weird-ass warble to it now, which Audrey refers to as:
“Next time you want me to fuck

Cas spelled out Dean's fear in no uncertain terms:
Dean's been through enough and as much as it pains Cas to think about, loneliness isn't a reasonable excuse to drag out their parting of ways, for either of them.

door, and maybe his chest swells with a small wave of pride at recognizing that) but he hears it loud and clear anyway.
?" Dean's eyebrows jump, not that he's surprised. He is a little dizzy though, and he felt pretty drained before they even made it to the club. This song and dance with Aaron isn't something he enjoys on a good day and if he lets it drag on any further he's gonna get cranky and lash out. The guy can't seem to take a hint but he's still a friend, sort of, and he doesn't deserve to deal with Dean's crap.
Perhaps, once Castiel completes his mission, once he stops Raphael and prevents the Apocalypse for all good, Dean will know peace. He deserves that much. He deserves much more.
"..fuck me,

Blue eyes, real blue, probably bluer than they seem 'cause of the overcast light coming through the window and his dark hair and stubble make them stand out more. Dean swallows down his mouthful as those eyes pin him in place, his cheeks heating. What the hell kind of noise was he making?
Dean’s conscience makes a good point.
be damned.
. "If he really feels the way he thinks he does. About me, about love, an'.." Dean swallows. "
"Uhm," the other Dean clears his throat at what Castiel knows is his own visible confusion. "There was an Angel, in our universe, also named Castiel, but.." he looks away; at the floor, the wall, the microwave and it's container of soup. "We never met." Castiel waits, watching him as he watches the soup, until he says, quiet, "Not in the mortal realm, at least. He was.. out of my reach―quite literally―but.. he saved me, once. He watched over me.. and I would pray to him, now and then. Talk to him, thank him.. ask him how things were in the divine realm," he chuckles softly, ducking his head.
—you're going to
“Y'know,” Sam shrugs. Dean waits. “In love.”
No more magic. Just booze and bandages and the steady hands of an old friend.
So much for being cured.
Cas wants Dean to answer his question, but instead of asking again whether he's alright what comes out is: "That was reckless, Dean. You could've gotten hurt."
"Charlie."
No use hiding it now. "Yeah, 'oh'."
They've come a long way since then, despite their many painful trials. Castiel has learned much, and Dean's trust in him has grown. Even without words spoken, he knows this. He can feel it through the connection they share, have always shared, the profoundness of their bond; with his Angelic perception, Castiel can sense variations of emotion from Dean's soul. He can feel Dean's trust in him through the solid walls of the bunker just as he can see it in the form of a rotating container through a microwave window.
"Yeah. Likewise."
And seeing as how both of Cas’ hands are now back on Dean, it almost seems unfair not to return the favor..
Turning his mind off from hunting isn't something Cas knows how to do. It's not just that hunters keep people safe from things they don't understand or, in most cases, don't even know exist. It's that he can't allow himself to get too comfortable. They'll have to part ways sooner rather than later so getting emotionally invested - even in a new friendship - isn't wise.
"Aunt Stacy? Uncle Harley? What are you doing?"
No. Not really.
"You say that like he hasn't been in your spank-bank since high school, man."
Life is crap.
. She could do so much better than that douchebag.
He takes the seat across from Dean in the booth, settles in with his cup of coffee and lays his fork on the table. Dean slides the plate to the center without a word, 'cause honestly what else can he say? He probably shouldn't say anything else right now, who knows what other crap would spill out.
No Armageddon, but the tradeoff was Sam jumping into the pit. Sam gets resurrected, but his soul gets left behind. Dean gets a taste of the 'apple-pie life', but hunting is his bread and butter. There's a civil war up in the clouds because (as everyone well-knows) Angels are dicks. And as if the self-crowned king of Hell trying to rip a hole between dimensions wasn't enough, apparently that screwy adventure is now on some dragon-dude's bucket list.
Crazy as it sounds, Dean kinda misses the ol' days. Y'know, when all they had to do was take down a couple of overzealous Archangels. They've got shit stacking up on so many spinnin' plates right now it's impossible to tell which one's gonna be the first to topple and shatter, crap raining down on 'em in a mess of blood and pain and one gruesome smear of trouble after another - and it'll soil a bunch of innocent people too, if they're not careful.
It was the only thing to get him through these late night shifts.
It's meet-cute time. 💚 💙
Dean hums as Sam brushes his hands together in his periphery. He didn't even realise they were so close to finishing the set up.
Before he could repeat the motion, Cas was fidgeting in front of him, hoisting his other knee, holding both high as he arched back into Dean, ass smooshing against his abdomen, Dean's body cocooning him.
His less-fucked-up eye adjusts to the low light in time to catch a flash of red hair beneath the streetlamp as she disappears 'round the corner. She's gone, and so is the body on the ground—
It was kind of adorable - in the non-stomach-churning sense of romantic encounters. It was real-life serendipity, and Dean had no trouble watching that scene play out.
It's instinctual.

. Who knows if this little outpost of civilisation is still standing. He hadn’t noticed it before, not that he takes this road for the pit-stops. It's a longer drive, winding east before curving up to meet the i-55. The new interchange shaves a good couple hours off the trip, depending on traffic, but that's more for when he's not traveling solo. The scenic route is better for this time of year because it helps improve his mood.
face, and he can’t bring himself to lie. The guy pretty much knows all his tells, anyway. Good for lawyering, bad for Dean.
Another hit lands—something cracks under the force of it—and the sensation obscures everything, the pressure still building in his chest overshadowed by the pain taking front and centre. Something hard collides with his head from one second to the next, but it doesn't hurt. Maybe he's reached some terminal velocity of pain where another blow just doesn't make a damn bit of difference.
“Huh. Okay, well, Benny usually stays the whole two weeks, right? You think that means..”
"So. He finally told you."
It's a helluva look, and Dean's heart swells with that wordless sensation―it threatens to bust down the levee and overflow through his entire being, fill him up from the inside out.
The trenchcoated man looks fierce as hell - until he turns to face the room full of people who are stretching and mingling, and suddenly he looks terrified. Blue eyes blow wide as he gulps down an onset of nerves.
Which meant that when Cas' grace had recharged he would no longer feel..
In those few seconds of illumination, he noticed the second remarkable thing this night: Dean was sat beside Cas on the edge of the bed, hand curled gently over the sleeping Angel’s.
His palm splayed between Cas' shoulder blades, and slid up to card through his bedhair. Dean planted a kiss in the Angel’s hairline.
This isn’t just about mending Dean's body with a simple touch. This isn’t just about Dean.
The weather is perfect for driving; blue skies streaked with wisps of cirrus cloud, temperatures in the high seventies, a light wind carrying the scent of pine forests through the open windows as they leave Ohio's farmland behind.
Both of them take a moment to check themselves, check their volume: they glance in unison over at the couch. Audrey is now on her back on the rug beside Bones, mimicking his paw movements in the air. Or.. he might be mimicking hers? Lucky is leaning up against Eileen's side - and seriously, it's like a human in a dog suit - as she captures the floor antics on her phone.
It wasn’t uncommon for Sam to rouse from sleep after a particularly gruelling hunt, one in which the loss outweighed the win. But it wasn’t usual for him to lose sleep over a big win like this.
"You're alright, Dean," Cas soothes, "You're alright, you're not alone.. I'm here, I'm right here.." He's so right: Dean never feels alone with Cas, and Cas is always there when he needs him. His heart slows, calming from frantic. The vice around his lungs eases off. Cas' touch is warm, his presence comforting, his voice a familiar road guiding him home. "..I want to be here, Dean, with you, always.."
face.
hard enough for Cas to stay. He could have found middleground, convinced Zeke it would be safer to keep Cas near than to send him away. He could have healed his brother and been schooling Cas in the ways of Humanity at the same time.
Dean only leaves because Sam is safe. No safer place than Bobby's. He just needs an hour or two to wrap his mind around things.
All he knows is that these clothes were comfortable; he's never known any garment to feel soft in that worn-in kind of way, a way his own clothes never had a chance to become. Blood stains and monster guts don't exactly wash out, even with their layers of top quality protective gear meant to keep it at bay, so every couple of months his wardrobe would cycle out and brand new pieces would filter in to fill his closet. It was like shedding one barely-worn skin for a stiff new one; nothing ever fit quite right, despite the tailoring.
"This is yours," he says after Dean pulls his door shut, locking it and all the others from the inside; Cas would have insisted anyway, though if anyone tries anything while they're sleeping he's a light sleeper and there's a gun, silver knife, flask of holy water and cannister of salt tucked in beside his toiletry kit. He may have a separate duffel dedicated entirely to weapons, but even though he was never in the Boy Scouts he learned from his father that hunters must always be prepared. His hand rests on a corner square of buttermilk flannel, fingertips grazing the

think of Cas, of the greatest loss he'd ever known.
Google Maps can’t help him now, thanks to his phone being in his pocket through all this, but from his former years spent on the road there's still a stash of good ol’ fashioned paper maps under Baby's front seat - complete with notations for the Ramblin’ Man: best routes for different weather, greasy spoons worth the stop, cheap but clean motels, decent bars for a hook-up..

. Cas had the worst timing. Saying something like that at a time like that, leaving Dean with more questions than answers.
He'll have to soak it to get the stains out. It's the least he can do.
He smiles at the thought.
Two quilted blankets are folded on the passenger side of the front and rear bench seats. They look warm and comfortable, handmade and well-cared for. It stirs something in Cas' chest; they're the kind of keepsake that come from a real home, constructed with care for loved ones. For everything he's learned of Dean these past two days he still doesn't know why he's on a road trip from west to east and back again, doesn't know why he left home, or if he even has one.
"What did you say? After he told you."
Dean takes his bag of chips along with Castiel's coat and sets them down together on the bench seat by the window. He removes his own jacket to add to their little pile of belongings, and says, stepping closer to Castiel, "How 'bout I bring the rhythm, you bring the moves, and we'll stay close to each other for when we both misstep."
He slides into the front seat beside Dean and it feels good, having someone riding shotgun again. It's been a long time since he's travelled with someone. He misses it.
Cas returns his smile, looking just as tired, just as hopeful, his leg pressing against Dean's under the table, and it feels like an answer to a question Dean still doesn't know how to ask.
There was a supreme trust in that which was, in itself, a huge turn-on for Dean.
Dean sobers at the end, mirth twinkling in his eyes as he threatens a non-existent scenario. From what Cas has seen Dean's not joking; he would freak out over his car's close proximity to the mess of a hunt. Luckily all the pagan-god worshipping folk of Burkittsville did was pump faulty fuel into it, something Dean was able to fix by draining the tank and fuelling up proper.
But Sam had already arranged it, and it just-so-happened to be covered by Dean's insurance, so he'd gone along if only to cease the pleading puppy-dog eyes. And the nagging.
The man eyes him warily, his body tight with tension as his hand meets Dean's. "Castiel," he says, gaze dipping to catch on Dean's armful of tortilla chips and his head tilting in silent question.
“Uhm, thankyou. I was named after an angel.”
Dean shrugs, eyes the speckle-patterned formica, the half-eaten pie between them. He's doing it again, saying more than he probably should. Nobody likes an oversharer. "Not sure yet."
Dean’s dogged reactions to his breathren? Did he look forward to it, feeling reassured by the concern of someone who
Today always gets him down. Not that that's a bad thing, it's supposed to be this way and nothing can be done to change that.
“Well, good. I’m.. glad to hear that.”
But that's the thing about shared moments like this―the ones that time stands still for while space suspends you, and if you lose your balance you'll fall through the clouds to land smack-bang on the cold hard ground, lost and alone and tossed out of your own special happening―if you take too long, someone else will talk first, move first, and you gotta hope you haven't missed your window, that they won't say or do something to throw you off balance and send you flying, falling, moment done and dusted, whether they meant to push you out of it or not.

"Back home?"
Glancing to the other side of the room where he'd seen Sexy Biker Dude proves pointless; the guy's gone, and even without his headache Dean doesn't know if it'd be worth the effort to get him into bed. It's too soon. He hasn't touched himself in weeks, hasn't cum in almost two months (unless you count nocturnal emissions). "Well, I do see a five-foot, cute-as-a-button dark-haired fella arriving at my door in the near future."
"Your world may have been vastly different to ours, in many ways―including your Angels, for all I know. But if there's one thing I've learned in my time here, in

A scowl threatens to sour Dean’s somewhat improved mood and the enjoyment of his coffee, so he shakes it off. Or tries to. “Whatever.”

Turning into that compliment turns out to be another dumb idea―'cos those eyes this
is still held in place by one of the custom-made magnets from his auto-shop. The colors clash; crisp white, grey and a tinge of steel blue, against a sickly shade of pink. Why anyone would want to color their business card in 'chewed bubblegum' Dean has no idea. But he's damn sure those little date boxes will go unchecked in the future.
Hands which are now securing the compress around his ribs. Dean fails to hold back a wince―but it's not from the contact; Cas' hands are warm. Soft yet firm, broad palms and nimble fingers. His touch is grounding, yet delicate in a way Dean tries hard to convince himself he actually deserves (but nonetheless revels in).
, he thinks.
?--fucking growls from somewhere. The sound catches their attention, seems to be coming from every direction. A shadow moves through the mist ahead, moonlight catching on a dark form lumbering slowly toward them, footfalls heavy. Axe murderer? Frankenstein's other monster? Some asshole who lives life like everyday is Halloween?
. He knows that sound, that sigh. Knows it so well his stomach drops down into the puddle of potion still working its way through his digestive tract.
It feels strange, being back in his own clothes after wearing those of this world's Dean. Perhaps now that he's felt what is native to this universe against his skin, something from another universe, a place he called home, feels foreign in an understandable way.
It shouldn't change things, but he's suddenly seeing Dean in a different light.
And it'll be Dean's great honour to love this man, to have and to hold him, to cherish him, from this day until the end of their days.
Not that Cas is just
"—I took your measurements. When we got back from Gitmo, I just.. needed to keep myself busy, y'know? With..
Swallowing, Dean waves his fork around until he can speak. "How'd you find a case?"
He can't help but wonder how much of the Dean he knows is carried through to other worlds, other Deans. Do they all have a love for cooking, or a desire to learn how to cook? Do they all have an unparalleled care for some sort of vehicle? Are there Deans out there who Castiel would not recognise by sight or sound?
In the background of everything he notes the beating has stopped, which probably means he's been dealt the final blow, but if the guy's done with him.. what's that sound? It's another beating—
He beamed at Cas, though his face had reddened some and he avoided prolonged eye contact.
The end comes, and it comes too soon (Dean
His cheeks are wet, cool tears tracking over heated skin—they don't stop coming, 'til they can't no more. Breaths come ragged and shallow, sapping what little energy he has left.
"No, it's good. This is good—It’s a lead. You should.. you should go.."
He saw it, and thought of Dean. And how perfect is that? Because every time Dean picks up one of his guitars, he thinks of Cas.
“Cool name," and soft hands, with a firm grip.
, Sam suspected.
Sour oranges waft back into his nostrils and it's déjà vu: cool sweep across left cheekbone, right eyebrow, his hairline.. History is repeating, and confusion stumbles sleepily through his mind to loosen his hold, hand slipping down Cas’ tie to the wider end. Dean's gaze is drawn past the deep blue in his grasp to the not-so-white of Cas’ everclean dress-shirt.
“He would’ve loved that,” Mary remarked from beside the pyre. “His mother was Irish. His family get together for a big thing, every year..”

And not that Dean is complaining about their extended time together, fatigue be damned.

But then, the most remarkable thing happened:
to say it; wants to tell Cas so he knows it too. Because.. what if he doesn't?
The thing is super creepy, like a pilgrim zombie with the old longcoat and some kind of patchwork mask covering its face, the eye-holes black voids.
Cas encircles him. Dean's not sure who moved first, but his own arms have found their way around Cas' waist; right where he wanted them to be. It happened without memory, a wish come true in a slow, surreal blink; no thought needed, just a feeling.
And then a second remarkable thing happened:
Cas doesn't linger after that. He's out the door and out of sight and Dean should just forget about him. There'll be plenty of other strangers on the road as he winds his way back west.
; the most beautiful of mortals, he who deserved far better than to be forced to service a selfish god who only covets his beauty.
Dean's not convinced he deserves that kind of credit, but he can't be blamed for snuggling closer anyway, for burying his face in Cas' blood-free button-up. Just like he can't be blamed for pulling Cas in with his arms, his legs.. embracing his likeness to a full-body pillow.
It only comes once a year and thankfully coincides with some much needed family time. Come tomorrow evening he’ll be surrounded by the extended Winchester-Campbell brood with a grin threatening to split his face in half and his energy stores magically replenished. Two weeks of quality time together as they wave goodbye to summer.
case, the Angel gets what the Angel wants. And thankfully, his and Dean’s were one in the same.
The rustle and movement of sheets caught his attention. He turned to find Cas had folded back the covers, a bare space inviting Dean to join him.
"I'm on a road trip. West to east, technically. Wove through the southern states on my way to the Atlantic, got some friends down that way. Gonna head through the midwest on my way back."
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
Which is just one of many reasons Dean's planning on concealing a little surprise in his
Though his brother’s hold was more secure around the wounded Angel, pulling him in close to his side. And both Dean’s hands were put to use: one on the forearm nudging his torso, the other wrapped around, rubbing not untenderly over the bunched and ruined fabric of Castiel’s trenchcoat.
A moment of cool air passed between them as Dean leaned back to the nightstand, returning to press gentle kisses behind Cas’ ear.
Dean let Sam get his ginormo hug in before he pulled Cas in close, unabashadly inhaling his Angel's scent, holding him well past the standard hug-time, savouring every moment, every detail for his memory.
His tongue traced the shell of Cas' ear, hot breath ghosting down his neck, open kisses exhaled at the top of his spine. Cas murmured in his sleep, shifting slightly. His ass instincively gravitated back to Dean’s touch. But he continued dreaming.
"This.. must have been expensive," he remarked, straightening up and turning back to Dean.
"You spent enough of your Angel mojo healing that dick to earn yourself at least one goddamn night's rest. You need to heal. I won't take no for an answer."
He tries to focus, eyes fuzzy: no, not red, but orange. Surprisingly vibrant smears of it across Cas’ chest, darker smudges either side of his buttons. If Dean squinted―which, okay, maybe he already
Four years of fixing cars is nothing to be ashamed of, either. It's good, honest work. There are things he misses about his former life but writing ain't one of 'em. If he had his time again he would've given up that life in a heartbeat to save Lisa, if he could've.
Castiel looks like he might be considering it. "I may fall," he says gravely.
He avoids dwelling on bad memories most of the time, refuses to let any sense of loneliness settle in. Because he's not lonely, not really. Not often. He's got Audrey and Sammy and all their extended family. They have each other, and it's enough. It’s family. It’s love. It’s good. And he's okay.
They're traveling on Highway 23, stopping for more fuel and snacks and eventually burgers near Thunder Bay. Dean wants to push on, reach Huron Beach and find a motel for the night, so they continue along the coast through twilight as stars begin to dot the sky, winking in the violet.
Because Dean may have forgotten about the considerable strength of his Angelic best friend, even when below 100%.
Dean waits, lips pressed shut to hold back his fear in case it tries to manifest itself in words. He doesn't wanna screw this up. He can't.
It was the kind of farewell reserved for lovers parting at the airport gate or on a train platform. The kind of moment filmed a thousand times over in every romance story that aimed to leave its audience
Several locals are positioned in front of them and off to the sides, blocking their escape. Their flashlights and shotguns are trained on the three of them. Dean recognises the general store owners and the damn sheriff.
"Thankyou for that. Guy was bein' a real hassle," she tells Dean.
The truck driver obviously didn’t see his arm outstretched in the universal sign for:
Dean doesn't dance. He's never danced before and he doesn't plan to change that in the near future.
That, or he’s just an asshole. Or maybe the driver was really the God of Mischief in disguise - now doubled over in hysterics behind the wheel of his pilfered big rig because of that perfectly aimed prank.
Cas doesn’t leave. He stays close―hand still settled over Dean's old scar, fingers still curled gently about his chin, body still pressed against Dean's. The only notable difference is the terrible lack of his lips on Dean (
thing! It’s like the only time we get to see him
And that's that. "Yeah, 'course." Dean rises when Cas does, like some old charmer in a black-n-white. "See ya around, Cas."
Cas' voice lowered to a grumble, almost threatening if not for the playful edge to it, his smile audible.
At a rest-stop by the Kansas state line bordering Oklahoma, while his brother fusses with a paper map and wonders aloud why on Earth this world's Winchesters don't have a dedicated GPS for each of their procured vehicles, Dean takes a moment outside of the car.
Cas stood only in his black boxers, and the sight apparently took Dean by surprise. He stood up from folding back the covers of the bed and cleared his throat again.
"--To the letter."

Dean patted Cas' back and let their bodies part, reeling from the latent body-warmth and the feeling of hope that their friendship was still in-tact.

There are definitely things about his brother's life Sam doesn't want to know and definitely never wants to hear (
Ignoring the sarcasm of his own conscience Dean clears his throat, tearing his eyes away to find the rain still bucketing down outside. He was so busy fine-tuning himself to dragon-dude’s presence that it slipped his mind how he came to be in his car in the first place: the God of Rain. Also Loki. Deities are mostly to blame here, so maybe he shouldn't be letting his hunger and fatigue lower his guard around a guy with a mythological name. It might be a warning sign.
"Seriously? Yo-- never mind.
"Oh, man," Dean manages, wiping his eyes and straightening up. "I freak out when some asshole just parks a little too close. Don't think I wouldn't freak out over monster guts and claw marks messing up my Baby."
Dean's soft smile sparkled, but was paired with concerned brows digging forward. He was worrying about Cas—
It's a remarkable feat, too, the fact that Dean's still sitting upright, that he hasn't toppled over to curl up on the table or let his body slip over the edge and pour itself into a puddle on the floor like it wants to. His muscles feel like liquid, ready to settle.
An idea tries to bubble up that maybe he's hurting Cas and should let go. But another one, a

He could feel change coming—it had already come. It was here, and it was
Placing his duffel in the footwell he situates himself in the middle of the rear seat, pulling the door shut to keep out the nighttime chill. Some residual warmth remains from the heater being on during their drive so it's not actually as cold as Cas thought. He won't need to wear his jacket and with the quilt Dean provided he won't need to use his coat either.
Dean can hear Audrey spinning a new tale of
Cas turned back to him, eyes wide with concern.
In his younger years he sometimes gave in to fantasies of life after hunting, of his family happy and safe, all of them living regular lives. But he learned there is no real life after hunting. Hunters don't retire so much as they get retired, maimed and half out of their minds with paranoia; there's no peace for them. Even if he finds the thing that killed his mother, even if he stops it from hurting anyone else, there are still other monsters out there. How can he choose to live a normal life while the lives of others continue to be destroyed, when he could do something to stop it?
“―The black one?”
Dean chuckled. He was impressed and aroused, his cock twitching impatiently against Cas.
The last thing he sees through bad one eye in the dark, is the painted mural on the alley wall. The half-light spilling out from the club illuminates that little flower as it reaches up through the dirt towards the sun. His face drops to the ground and he succumbs to the darkness.
saved—someone close to both him and his brother. On top of that, words were spoken which had been, in Sam’s opinion, a long time coming. And Castiel couldn’t take them back any more than he could raise Wally from the dead, no matter how much Dean may have wanted him to.
Bottoming out, Dean rocked gently into Cas with a soft groan, cheeks pillowed against Dean’s pelvis.
(destiel prompt sideblog)
So much for a nice scenic drive to reset his mood.
He thought you would leave again and his heart would break off another piece, having no need for it.
"Even less so now."
Dean, but it's not exactly the first time this has happened, so he pushes through the strangeness of it all.
Coming to a stop at Baby's passenger side Dean takes a breath, considering. He faces Cas head-on, "It's one of the greatest television shows ever made―" and raises his finger in warning, "―and if you ever tell
Sam sits on Jack's other side, rubbing his shoulder and back, letting him know he's there for him, too. They all are. Jack gravitates to him after a little while, leaning into his side as Sam pulls him near. Cas sits opposite them at the little wooden table, their family huddled together in the residual warmth of the kitchen, each of them silently reeling from the events of the day.

Cas hums, attention back on the board.
"Look, about Jack," Sam steps closer, voice dipping to a tone that means sympathy and support, the kind that gets a work out on a case. "I know things with you two have always been kind of complicated, and I can imagine that him not bringing Cas back has only made things harder—"
Dean could be fine by now.
Is this the question the other world's Dean had wanted to ask him? "I.. microwave." A shy smile sneaks onto Castiel's face and the other Dean nods, looking perplexed. "Dean cooks, I just.. help where he needs me."
He might as well just cut out the middleman and stay. Stay the night in Cas' room. In Cas' bed.
"..Human."
Cas said nothing, but a smile sparkled in his eyes before he leaned out of bed to switch off the light on his side. Dean followed suit, switching off his own lamp.
Maybe Dean should've sat in the chair, had some

Cas steps away to ready the swab for his knuckles and Dean lets his clean shirt drop back down (dark fabric, to hide any trace of red that might seep through the bandages). He takes another sip of the good whiskey to swill round his mouth. He can't really taste it, just likes the burn and the way it smooths over his palet to numb everything in its wake.
"Well, it is as good as advertised. If you like apples, that is. Unfortunately that was our last piece."
be forced to hunt you down.”
But the want of a friend is selfish, dangerous.
"Dean, no matter what happens you're not going to lose him. Just look at everything the two of you have already been through."
The soft backlight glow of the map casts an almost romantic feel over their makeshift medbay.
It's not like he told Cas never to stop by. The guy took off before he could tell him it wasn't outta the question. And the whole lack-of-prayin' thing was only Dean's choice since he didn't need Cas, didn't wanna bother him.

Helluva prank. But as any Hunter worth their salt knows, this is a cruel world.

He really did.
Sam didn’t bother trying to hide his smirk. Instead, he let it bloom into a grin as Dean shifted into cranky-mode and side-swiped him with his bag enroute to the car, muttering some warning about
Sam would've said something
, right now. “This one's different.” He seems to recall something then, a weird smile flashing across his face. “Gran said he’s, 'absotively smitten'.”
His thighs and calves strain and the pads of his feet are well and truly pruned, but it’s his stomach growling in protest of being ignored so damn long that steals Dean’s attention. That stop at the Gas n’ Sip for taquitos and coffee did little to sate his usual lunchtime appetite, but he just didn't want to fill up on crap and not be able to chow down on the awesome Winchester-Campbell feast that awaited him at journey’s end. It was good to arrive a little hungry. In any case, there’s no food and no place to escape the elements right now.
Dean's moving quietly - the kind of soft-stepping of someone who either doesn't want to disturb or doesn't want to be heard, but the sounds are crisp and obvious to Sam's heightened ears: out the back door, over the gravel, gnats throwing themselves against the zapper, Impala door barely whispering a creak as it opens (the

“Hey, Eileen,” he smiles up at her. Or tries to smile. It’s probably more of a grimace, really. Whatever tiny store of energy he had is now sufficiently drained from being wrestled to the ground.
," Emily pleads, crying and angry.
The plate is scraped clean too soon. Their brief time together is about to end and he knows he wants to see Cas again. But wanting something and asking for it, and actually getting it? They're all different things.
“Sorry, mine don't come with fancy healin’ powers,” he murmurs onto Cas’ lips.
"And while I appreciate that, I can't in good conscience put you in harm's way."
“Uh-huh.” He gestures at the remaining problem still camped out on his diaphragm. “And this—?”
It was too much to battle all at once, and the loss of warmth in Dean’s bones was making him antsy.
The fall rains may be edging in on the end of summer a little too soon for Dean's liking, but he doesn’t mind it so much since he’s got a living embodiment of sunshine right here. One who is currently awaiting her pancake alien armada to help fight off the volcano-fried Baconista dragons of Björn, who are at this very moment keeping a close watch over the cheesy-scramble mountains of Eggtopia.

It is possible, despite the spellwork needed for them to open a rift into an alternate universe, that this Dean has not encountered any Angels himself, or at least not ones who have made their home on Earth, among humanity; changing day by day, becoming more like humans in innumerable small but not insignificant ways.
It's not without conditions, understandably, because it's not so much a 'cure' as an ongoing treatment. The heady decoction - and he hesitates to call it a 'potion', though that does seem to be the most appropriate term - helping him along needs to be freshly brewed every seven days and drank on an empty stomach (a personal preference, considering what comes after - though sleep swiftly follows, which seems a small but notable blessing, or..).

Thankfully. Because even though it was something Dean not only deserved but needed to hear, Castiel’s confession probably would have worsened Dean’s grief had he not survived. Because now it was out in the open, it was real. And Dean would have lost his final chance to speak his heart, to tell Cas how he felt in return—that he felt the

He manages to dial, then, four rings 'til Sam picks up and it's a blurted, overlapping frenzy of questions and half-hearted reassurances. Sam's okay. Jack's okay. Dean doesn't say the words, but.. in the silence that follows his brother's question about Cas, Sam knows.

And a few more times—his mouth, his eye, his noise—Dean's face bruises and splits under the assault and he can't even catch a breath.
So maybe he does believe, because surely the universe can’t have it in for him like this without some nefarious asswipe pulling the strings. Maybe this is just how Gods operate nowadays since people don't pay attention like they used to. Ancient spirits in the sky gotta pass the time somehow, and their mystic-meddling hoodoo is cursing him for kicks right this very second.
Conversation shifts from tourist traps worth detouring for to places Dean should definitely avoid. He actually pouts when Cas informs him that Bigfoot is just a hoax. It's almost adorable the way he sulks.
to play out the last few bars of track seven and most of the closing number, Dean sits alone in the driver's seat, headlights lighting the way to nowhere, waiting in relative quiet.
"What kind of stuff?"
The sky rumbles again, fat drops of rain slipping down his neck. More voices—they sound further away, or maybe that's just him. He can breathe, but his headache from earlier has nothin' on the one pushing at his skull now. He's gonna blackout for real this time.

But it also meant that it was a side-effect, that for it to happen there first had to be a hefty drain of Cas' energy, like a battle-wound or using his grace to help heal someone or defend someone in need—Dean, most likely.

much out of his element (which is kinda perfect) as he holds the pose Dean helped him strike: one hand up, fingers paired with space between. If anyone sees them they'll just think they're a couple of conspiracy nutjobs.

It's Sam. He'd meant to call Sam, tell him what happened. He'd tried—got as far as pulling his phone from his pocket, fingers moving on autopilot—but he couldn't make the call. How the hell could he?
Whatever he hopes to be seeing in Castiel’s shy smiles and reddened cheeks is just a reaction to Dean’s bizarre behaviour. The guy’s got a stranger in his car on a ghost highway in the rain―he deserves a little breathing room, for fuck sake.
"So it's an age-thing?"
The other locals scatter as screams echo through the orchard. They run to the edge of the orchard and out onto the road. The scarecrow doesn't follow. The air seems still again, undisturbed. The screams have stopped and there's no growling to be heard.
Nudging Sam to look, they both spare another moment to admire their little family.
. And we did."
Cas is still close, still hugged by Dean's thighs, loose as they are around him now. And it's as he reaches back to the medkit―Dean's eyes following that arm extending, that suddenly traitorous hand that has left his face in favor of something
Hours drifted by in ecstasy, tossed sheets and kernals of caramel corn flying through the shadows. They set the soundtrack of the night to their own pleasure, lust and ache and genuine, gentle affection manifesting as a manic melody, filling the room to take on its own presence.
Hands raised in surrender, Sam backs off.
"C'mon! It'll be a learning experience."
With Billie's plan in motion and Chuck's own endgame nearing, the safest place for the other Sam and Dean is as far away from the bunker as possible, for now at least. If they failed in their mission, however, no place in the world, or in any realm, would be safe for anyone.
"You okay? You spaced-out, for a minute there."
, finding comfort in his own space in the bunker and by Dean's side, hell, Cas
Sam could see a head shaking wearily in the hazy contrast of shadows and light.
Cas gives him a strange look, head tilted again, eyes narrowed. Before Dean can figure out how to course-correct, Cas extends his hand. Dean meets it with his own and their shake lingers a beat longer than necessary. Cas' hand is large and warm, his grip firm and reassuring.

in the same animated voice she used at breakfast, only at a quieter volume. A glance over his shoulder tells him she's signing some parts, Eileen helping her express certain words with previously unknown gestures. Dean should really practice more; his kid is always setting good examples.
"They're not common," he assures. "I've been hunting for over twenty years and I've only encountered a handful of demons. The most common by far are vengeful spirits. All manner of form-shifting creatures come in second."

shine, depending.
Over pancakes and bacon at a nearby roadside diner, Cas delays telling Dean he'll be leaving. It should at least wait until he's finished his third cup of coffee, he reasons.
Under the hood he can see something's wrong, but it's not the usual wear n' tear of the road. "What the hell?" Looks like somebody messed with his engine-- and that's the last thought he has before a sharp pain blooms across the back of his skull and everything goes dark.
Casting an evil glare at the traitor of a coffee pot he opens the fridge to grab some OJ instead. At chest-level the flimsy cardboard appointment slip for
―it's too much to bear. Dean's chin dips down, eyes on the tie between his fingers, lips meeting that thumb in a soft press like it's the most natural thing in the world.
"I.."
Landing in the dirt with a heavy thump and a groan as Dean tightens his grip, the man suddenly promises to let the woman 'have it her way' while also cussing Dean out.
Most days he's okay, emotionally speaking. Life goes on. Every year it gets a little easier, if not occasionally lonely in a way friends and family and even the munchkin can't quite turn around. But, again, that's just the way of some things. A widower's day-to-day.
This dog is
"I uh. Need to use the restroom."
He'll start with the classics, obviously. Figure out which old girls could make the most of the parts already in the lot. Settle on a few models to switch between while he figures out what else needs to be tracked down, ordered and delivered.
It was worth it.
"I got it, I got it. I'll follow your lead, Yoda."
He pulls on a fresh shirt and his only pair of clean jeans, re-laces his boots and slips his arms inside his maroon hoodie. It'll be cold in the car without the heater so he'll need to layer his jacket over the top, maybe even use his beige longcoat as a blanket; from experience he knows it's large enough. He keeps both at the top of his duffel and heads back out into the crisp September night.
"Good morning, Dean."
The pies aren't to blame, either. That asshole God of Mischi―
She huffs a laugh and shakes her head. "No, he ain't like that. Real overbearing type. Kinda pushy, is all. I just told him I'd found another ride and he was upset. Can't blame him, really. I'm fabulous company."
to their cart while surreptitiously sliding Sam's coffee mug out of reach.
Except.. he’s soaking wet, and it'd be pretty damn rude of him just to assume an open door meant:
“I don’t run anything—” Sam lowers his voice again. “I’m not a
Cas gravitated to the bedside, reaching for the sleepwear and pulling on the flannel bottoms—almost tipping forward, but Dean's hand braced him, keeping him from falling. Cas peeked up at him, a shy smile thanking him.
The guy nods, smiling as he swallows and chases his mouthful with a sip of black coffee-- and winces.

This may prove to be a terrible idea, but Cas finds himself willing to do everything he can in order to keep Dean safe, even if that means bringing him along on a case so he can be better equipped to protect himself and his loved ones in the future, after they really do part ways.
"You don't like it here, huh?" he muttered, avoiding Cas' eyes while loosening his tie.
He pushed in slow, filling Cas inch by delicious inch, revelling in the aching drag as Cas enveloped him, whimpers sighing from sleeping lips.
He settled back down beside Dean, who hoisted the covers up over his chest.
He grabs hold of the table's ledge to stop the fall―jerks to a more alert state of consciousness; eyes still heavy as he blinks but heart racing enough to keep them open, aware, and―
Through the sea of writhing bodies there's a stationary figure, someone looking his way from across the dancefloor. Can't see much from this far, but dark sexhair, a stubbled jaw, and eyes so blue they practically glow—and they're fixed on

For both of them, surely.
It's Dean's voice, but not quite. Still, Castiel knows it as well as he knows Dean's soul: this Dean has something he wants to say. Castiel turns to face him, offering a friendly smile. "Hello, uhm.. Dean." It feels strange because it's Dean and
Did Dean want that? Did he want Cas to settle for him when he deserved so much more?
They lapse into silence after that, Cas leaving Dean to ruminate while he takes advantage of the respite to check his phone. Hunts farther away would be best so he can put some distance between Dean and himself, between Dean and whatever supernatural threat lies at the other end, but so far there's nothing.
He hears Dean shuffle about in the front as he moves to lay down, extracting his jacket from his duffel to use as a pillow. He spreads the quilt over himself, appreciating the size as it pools in the footwell and bunches over his feet. Despite their combined body heat in the enclosed space, the lack of heater and the steel chassis and glass windows don't do much to insulate against the nighttime chill now seeping in.
—to teach Castiel a thing or two when they got back to the bunker, pocketing the keys and letting the warmth of his coffee permeate his then-chilled bones as he swallowed, accompanying Cas back to their room, hand hovering at his back.
He sneaks a glance at Dean, eyes his hands where they flex against the leather of the steering wheel, tightening and loosening. He swallows, eyes alert and staring out at the road, face half hidden in shadow and half illuminated by the dim glow of the dashboard, and Cas returns his gaze to the road.
"And Dean?"
Of all the items in their online haul, Sam was looking forward to those headphones in particular. He was especially relieved when they arrived two days later - mere hours before an onset of hyperacusis, which happened to coincide with Dean taking some power tools to a beat-up old Mustang.
“Oh. So.. you want me to leave?”
"The way he looks at you. And I never thought it was some big secret, I mean—
Ishim's words had gotten to him. Dean could see it plain and bold as the red blood staining Cas' otherwise stark-white dress shirt. Add the physical beating to that emotional one, and he knew Cas could use a good night's rest. He insisted Cas at least
Dean didn't believe him. Cas knew he didn't believe him. But neither had the energy to care at the moment.
Just one word, born of and survived by hope.
With Baby back to rights he drives 'til the sun dips below the wheatgrass horizon, no destination set in stone but half tempted to find a bar just south of the border. It's the best combo there is to clear his head: just the open road, whatever's on tap wherever he pulls up, and the right kind of company for just long enough to sate this desire to scream his lungs out - at crappy circumstance, at the Winchester Family Curse, at his own bad choices.
to.."
As for nefarious folk, there was that stalker in college, Becky, and Dean had totally called that one the first time he caught her making creeper eyes at Sam. Cue the full-body shudder.
Dean glares daggers; half-hurt, half not surprised because isn't that how little brothers are supposed to act? They laugh at their sibling's relationship troubles? But Sam gets it, because his face softens.
"Can I get you another slice for the road?"
“Like a rabid dog?" Cas muffled into his collar, "Or a.. lovesick puppy?”
"..Yeah.. me too.."
In a few days it would be replenished, and Cas would hit the road—
He closes the door and pulls back onto the highway. As he drives the sky rumbles overhead. The clouds darken as he approaches the storm and the darkness inside him, the emptiness where Billie tried to break his heart, grows. There's nothing left to break.
At least Castiel doesn’t seem bothered by Dean’s appalling flirtation―
“Just like you'd do for a case. You run a background check on the potential badguy.”
Fingers sinking, swirling deeper, Dean’s cock throbbed, eager for its turn. Dean slowly removed his hand, slipped from between Cas' thighs, and worked their mixed juices down over his length, before lining up the head.
He's fine.
But Dean's not one for being idle, so there's still one thing left to do.
He feels a smile form - a real
Somehow, he just
slipped into unconsciousness, Sam pulled on his jeans, boots and jacket and snuck out of their room with two goals in mind:
Dean can't fix everything that's broke, everything of his that's been damaged or everything he's had a hand in screwin' up somewhere along the line.
A name.
to lean on. Why didn't he do that..? Why was he sitting up on the table..? It’s not really comfortable, and the pocket of chill beneath it is undoing the blood-warming-good his shower had done, leg muscles twitching to get away from the cold..
in the first place. There're just some things you don't want your little brother knowing about you because those things have the potential to wind up as ammo for future battles in a time-honoured prank war.
If Cas were a different person, if his life were different, he'd be able to unwind a little and enjoy their time together more. But taking time out for coffee and pie with a stranger is one thing when they may have insight on a case. It's another thing to let an impromptu road trip with said stranger distract him from his job.
"I don't want to put you in any danger, Dean."
Cas pulls back―lips caressing one last goodbye as they leave his own (
Cas’ eyes seem imploring, bright and sad and

Life doesn't work like that. The universe is not poetic and it's not conspiring in his favour, hoping and waiting for him to take that leap into the unknown.

It's a worse fate than whatever Chuck could do to him. Sonuvabitch'd probably revel in it, too. He couldn't get the ending he wanted out of him and Sam but their suffering is his drug of choice, his fucking life-blood. He thrives on their pain. Who'd've guessed God was a sadistic fucker who gave the Devil himself a run for his money?
Two bouncing glitter antennae catch his eye as he lands a stack of reinforcements on the counter space. "The fleet is yours, Ranger Rio!" He gives a spatula-salute, turning the plate with a flourish so the vessels are right-side-up to their Commander.
He was right about most things when it came to his brother and his best friend—that is, the unspoken thing the two of them shared.
Aaron turns to palm some goods off to a passing client leaving Dean to try and remember the last time he even got close to getting laid. Rhonda, Lee, Cassie, Lisa, Lee again, Victor, Jamie.. He's got a decent catalogue to pull from if he wanted to relive some of his greatest hits alone with himself, but there hasn't really been anyone since the hallucinations started. And he hasn't been able to keep it up on his meds, not that he's really wanted to, either.
this? “Look, the point is, in his line of work Benny meets all sorts. The most common of which are horny tourists lookin’ to get their rocks off on their vacation, because whatever happens on the cruise, stays on the cruise. It's like the Adulterer's Law of International Waters.”
Footfalls pound down the alley towards him—someone running, calling out for help. There's already movement above him, a hand on his shoulder, and somethin' that sounds like,
sort of a big ol’ teddy bear. He'd definitely always been a sweetheart, had always been a gentleman with his various consorts no matter how short the affair - but
which turns out to be a colossal mistake, because as soon as he makes eye-contact his mouth runs away from him again. “Well, I’m headed wherever you are, Angel.”
The shadows pressed in on him, insistent. Cas’ smile lingered in his mind though, and before he could surrender to sleep, one more thought nagged at him.
"The Red Witch." She points a glittery fingernail at the puddle of ketchup beside the half-devoured mountain of Eggtopia. "She melted in the battle. Dragonfire
home. He's propped up on the map table in the early hours of the morning, dawn probably not far off. It's been a long-ass day and he didn't trust his legs to keep him up, so he lets them hang over the edge from where his butt is firmly planted by the Cape of Good Hope.
But that's a little too personal to ask a guy he just met.
If Dean was being honest, he could cut and run right now; go back to his own room and his own bed, feeding Cas some bullshit excuse about needing his beloved memory foam to get a decent night's sleep. But he would no doubt find himself restless, waking several times in the night to wander back down the hall to check in on his friend.
closet, cloaked in shadow.
But then―just as before―Cas surprises him with his movements.
“Thanks, man.”
"Please. Just let us go," Emily tries, but there doesn't seem much of a chance of bargaining with these loonies.
What if, even after all this time, after everything, he still
The song of Cas' growing ecstasy eventually hastened beyond control, reaching soaring heights as Dean pushed once.. twice more into him, long and full.
"To a certain degree, I suppose. Majority of things known to hunters have enough intellect to comprehend certain aspects of human life. They're aware of the consequences of their actions and behaviour, to some extent. They inflict pain and suffering, yet they continue to do it anyway. It's an uncontrollable desire to satisfy some base need. Some feed on flesh, others fear. More often than not - by a wide margin - there's a malevolence to their mindset. They lack the capacity for empathy, guilt, remorse. They have no conscience."
The most he can do is strip his wet layers and don the yellow poncho he found in the glove compartment. But there's even less chance of him scoring a ride from a stranger if he looks like some naked dude who just escaped the looney bin to LARP it up as Paddington Bear.
*  *  *
Six months ago he was eyeing multiple possibilities on a night out like this, but it's been hard to see a pretty face and think positively sexy thoughts knowing it could all turn into a B-grade horror scene at any moment.
Bad decisions are catching.
. Seems like this is another teachable moment..”
Usually, with his brother and his best friend beside him, Sam felt they were a force to be reckoned with. That together, they could take on anything.
“I look forward to it.”
“No.”
Satisfied, Dean lets go and steps back out of reach in one swift movement, coming to stand beside the woman again, who's grinning down at the man as he stumbles up and away from the two of them.
“You can’t blame him.”
Chuck leans forward in his chair, hands folded over Dean's file as he regards him steadily. He's not the first patient to struggle with this affliction, but time—and drugs—do heal many a-cracked psyche. "This is a good thing, Dean. You're better." With a tight smile that's half bedside-manner (for Dean's sake) and half relief (for his own sake, knowing that things have improved instead of barrelling off in the other direction; that happens sometimes, too) he moves on to the next matter at hand. "Now, you might experience some side effects."
He could

"It happens, sometimes, when my grace needs.. recharging. I become more.."
But in Dean’s case it seemed less the magic of double-spiced breakfast burritoes and triple-strength coffee that did away with his morning crotchetiness, and more the simple presence of his best friend, alive and well.

be warming up to those giant furballs).
He’s free, and his body feels weightless, if not slightly bruised and thoroughly marred with the essence of Dog. He groans for effect, gradually getting to his feet and staggering off to the kitchen where Sam is chuckling - but also holding a large thermos of coffee. A truce, and Dean accepts.
"It's complicated?"
He can handle the discomfort, and hopefully he doesn’t succumb to the elements before another car comes by. Camping out in Baby ‘til the rains run out would be an option if the engine wasn't shot (no heater) and the rear window wasn't busted. At least it's not the middle of winter (it's not even technically Fall) so his chances of actually catching hypothermia are pretty low, which is a small win that he marks down against the growing tally of losses for the day. Baby being injured beyond a quick-fix repair really stacks those losses, though.
"And vampires, shape-shifters, other humanoid species you wouldn't be able to tell weren't human until they bared their inhuman attributes. Fangs, eyes, and claws, for the most part."

Something clatters 'round the corner making his heart skip and his calm ebb. It could be nothing, just a rat sniffing for crumbs in the trash. Or it could be something. Could be someone in trouble—passed out or strung out or hurt, or worse.
"Good. You go first."
. Dean's beautiful legs are not to blame here, and if he’s fit enough to keep up with the munchkin and lug around engine parts at work all day, then he’s fit enough.
thinks Dean, and approaches the tall man with hand outstretched. "Hey, I'm Dean."

Or they're in hiding, and ain't that a pip: Monsters of all kinds all over the States just as afraid as Sam and Dean and Bobby are of the mutant monster-mash claiming the vacancy of God for itself (

He eyes Dean again, heart a little heavy, stomach a little twisted, and sees no sign of the discomfort from before.
But there's no rest for the cursed. His stomach turns against him, bile rising too quick to do anything but fold over and let it burn its way up and out of his throat. He manages to shove his phone out of the way just in time; the smallest of fucking mercies.
at Dean with any hint of a joke right now hits him where it hurts, well. No-one's the wiser if he just shoves that feeling away - even if Cas is staring right at him. "Just stand there n' look pretty." The phone pans to Cas' right, capturing the levelled gas station beyond the police barricade.
Maybe it's weird to be so impressed by a dude's arsenal but with the adrenaline crash and near-death experience Dean's not worried so much about what comes out of his mouth. He tells Cas it's both disturbing and awesome, imagines he probably knows some badass close combat skills, too. Shame Dean didn't get to see that skillset in action.
