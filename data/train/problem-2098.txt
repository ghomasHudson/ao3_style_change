He listened more intently.

"Is there no way out of the mind?”
Of course, Mike insisted I tell the whole sordid tale of being wounded. My military experience is something I’m not really comfortable talking about at any length. At least not yet. I’ve gone through it all once with Thompson and that’s really as much as I care to discuss it, so I gave him the shortened version. I know I was honorably discharged and all…but it still stings a bit…still feels like a bit of a cop-out. Life goes on though, huh?
were his first thoughts.
“Hello, Mike? It’s Sherlock. Listen, have you seen John? Hmm…you were wondering too. No, and yes he did say five o’clock. I really don’t know where he went. He made a list of potential places to buy a tree and he had a couple of those chop-your-own spots on the list, too. No…no I haven’t tried his cell. I could do that though, couldn’t I? Absolutely… yes, if I get in contact with him, or when he arrives home, I’ll have him give you a ring. Yes. Right. Of course… you have a nice evening too, Mike. Goodbye.”
John felt his legs turn to rubber and his heart threatened to beat right out of his chest…or stop.

her? He was thoughtless and rude; ridiculous and unkind…but he had never knowingly hurt her. Not really. Not that he
Sherlock snorted. “That’s
John donned his coat and gloves, grabbed the ax case by the sofa, and headed towards the door.
“Do be careful wielding axes about,” Mrs. Hudson started. “My friend Agatha Deerling’s husband Nigel lost two toes one Christmas chopping down a tree. Although, he always was quite clumsy and not very athletic, and you‘re...well…used to that sort of thing. I mean, being in the army and all.”
She lowered herself to the tiled floor. She wanted to scream, scream so long and so hard that it drove the last fifteen minutes right out of her head. She wanted to cry, cry so hard it washed away any lasting dredges of that memory that the screaming failed to drive out. She wanted to do these things, but she hadn’t the strength to do either of them.
The box provided two strands of colored lights which proved to be in good working order, so he laid them on the living room table and put the box beside the couch. He wasn’t exactly sure where they were going to put the tree. The tree. When it arrived.
He wanted to so desperately to see her, wanted so badly to take her into his arms and tell her he was sorry and that it would be alright. This time, it would be alright.
“Well he’s not at, nor has he been, at any of the local hospitals,” Lestrade stated. “Did you find a list?”
― Haruki Murakami
“I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me.”
Sherlock blew on his cup before taking a cautioned sip of the tea. He set the cup back in its saucer and turned to face John. “I
“I was wondering…ah…do you know what time we’re to meet for Christmas dinner? At...with our parents, I mean.”
“Yeah, yeah….you, too.”
“I said, in case I decide to go to one of those cut-your-own tree farms. I may do; haven’t been to one of them in ages. Probably not since I was a kid. We always got our trees from a place like that. Of course, Harry and I could never settle on one so our mum always ended up picking one out. And dad just knocked us about the head for fighting. I honestly don’t know if Harry and I ever agreed on
to face all that alone. Perhaps she had been a bit harsh pronouncing him limited. Sherlock was probably right that Mycroft had done his best; or at least thought that he had. Sherlock was so often right. Still, she was sure her younger son would have handled things differently. If she, Richard, and Sherlock, had been able to have access to Eurus all along, perhaps she wouldn’t have felt so abandoned and alone. Perhaps none of those people would have died.
“So then…what do you think?” asked John Watson, as he placed a steaming cup of Darjeeling in front of his friend and flatmate, Sherlock Holmes.
wellies. And there are wool socks in John’s top drawer. But here, drink your tea first. Warm you up a bit before you head out. And I’ll call Molly and let her know.”
He tried shifting his legs…and screamed in agony.
Putting his abdominal muscles to work, John rose up as far as he could and shoved on the branch with both hands. But his efforts yielded little results, and after only a few minutes of effort, he collapsed once again.
“All I'd ever wanted was to forget. but even when I thought I had, pieces had kept emerging, like bits of wood floating up to the surface that only hint at the shipwreck below.”
And now…now what were they to do? All those wounds re-opening. More horrors, more deaths at Eurus’s hands?
She drained her teacup and lay down on the sofa. She didn’t want to think anymore right now.
He entered the shop, bought an extra-large, extra-strong coffee, a bag of crisps, and a packet of chocolate biscuits. He sweet talked the young cashier into letting him use the “not for the public” loo, and left for Big Ben.
“No. I’d rather do it face to face.”
John gave a little chuckle and shook his head.
“Yes…yes, I’m here…I’m…here,” he said as he gathered his composure. “So, Molly brought her to you…yes. Thank god.”
be a danger night for him.”
starting to panic over it then this
“No…not since she dropped Rosie off. John, what’s wrong?”
Bloody hell; he prayed his old bones would be strong enough to handle this.
“So, they started life as perfectly ordinary turtles, crawled around in some toxic run-off, and turned into humanoids…after a fashion, and were then raised by a humanoid rat who taught then ninja skills. And now they roam New York preventing evil.” Sherlock stated.
No one outside the family had seriously suspected Eurus of being responsible for the Trevor boy’s disappearance. But she herself
The night John came to Baker Street after awakening from Eurus’s tranquilizer was harrowing. He’d walked into 221B extremely agitated after dropping Rosie off with Mrs. H.  John had paced the floor, kept running his hands across his face, and muttering “Jesus”, before finally plopping into his old chair and spilling it all out to him. Sherlock had found himself unable to utter a word as he felt that one last element, that one last piece to his life’s puzzle, click into place.  Just like that, many things magically made sense. No, he didn’t have all the sordid details yet, but he knew who did: Mycroft. But had Mycroft’s silence about the matter been born out of true concern…or something else?
was he going to do about her? He knew he couldn’t just let this go…he just couldn’t. He wasn’t going to let her down again. Never again. No matter what anyone had to say about it. No one was going to stop him. An idea was already forming in his mind about what he was going to do.
“I don’t know that I’d be very good at ‘hanging out’… as you put it. But, here…the movie’s about to start.”
John blew out a long breath and rubbed his eyes. “Yeah…..dreadful. People have died, Mrs. H. And she nearly strangled Sherlock and drowned me. She’s evil, a real psychopath. I mean, I’ve worked with disturbed people before, but she…takes the cake. She makes Moriarty look like… Humpty Dumpty. And
“What about John, Sherlock.”
All trees are fifteen quid no matter the size.
“Hmm….childless for the evening…a borrowed vehicle…good cover.” Mycroft’s voice was barely above a whisper. “Okay, so you think something’s amiss,” he continued in a more normal tone. “What did you intend I do about it, brother dear, call in MI 5? You’re the detective of the family. I’m sure you don’t need me to help you come to any definitive conclusions.”
The lady cut him off as she appeared with the tea tray. “They’re in the small closet in the basement, Sherlock. Snow boots
island. The more he thought, the harder he brushed. If only he could sweep all of this...unpleasantness… right out of his life. The only good thing about it was that now...finally…the wretched business was out in the open.  The burden of those secrets, the lies, the deceit, the anger, and the silence on his part…it was over. There had been times in the past when he had felt that he would definitely crack under the weight of it all.
Mike talked about his teaching career and how life was marching along well for him. Apparently, he’s joined a boxing club and takes ballroom dancing lessons. God, I tried that once, the dancing, and made a bloody fool of myself, landing on my arse. It was fun, I will admit, but I fear I have two left feet. Anyway, we knocked back a few pints and soon the countdown began. 2010. Twenty-ten and here I am in my forty’s, invalided home from war, no permanent residence, no family to speak off, no immediate prospects for employment. Yep, this New Year was starting off with a bang alright. More like a dull thud.
“Yes, yes, Molly…sorry. I…umm, okay, truthfully…I don’t know where John is. And quite frankly, I’m not sure if I should be worried or not. Mycroft doesn’t believe I should be. I don’t know if you knew anything about his plans for today, but he went out in search of a Christmas tree for us and one for Mrs. Hudson. He borrowed Mike Stamford’s truck and said he’d be back around five and…well, it’s after nine and he’s still not here.”
“Well…”
They didn’t even notice their friends watching and high-fiving each other through the lobby’s window.
He instructed the cabbie drive by 221B Baker Street first, just so I would know where I was going when the time came. He then exited the cab, paid the fare, and gave me a little wave and a wink before turning to his door. A
contacted you? Not Molly Hopper then?”
Greg Lestrade had just settled on his sofa with his third double scotch of the evening when his cell rang.
“That sounds lovely,” he responded, giving his date’s hand another squeeze. “We can talk about it on…”
“So many versions of just one memory, and yet none of them were right or wrong. Instead, they were all pieces. Only when fitted together, edge to edge, could they even begin to tell the whole story.”
“Yes, of course, I have,” Sherlock snapped…and then immediately apologized.
Mrs. Hudson headed for the kitchen. “And I’ll…I’ll make us a pot of tea. Earl Grey, I think.”
Rosie had been staying with Molly. He had considered asking Sarah Sawyer to possibly look after Rosie before he left with Sherlock for Sherrinford, but knew that would require much explaining and he did not have the time or will for either. So Molly Hooper it was. And then Molly’s life and home had been threatened. When Eurus announced that Molly’s flat had been rigged to blow, he wanted to shout out, but he knew he could not, and so he kept that hell to himself.
But he never finished his sentence as Sherlock suddenly pulled him around to face him. Although he was two years younger, Sherlock towered over him. John felt himself struggling to keep it together as this beautiful young man looked down at him with a look John had not yet witnessed.
“I’ve given it a lot of thought tonight,” Sherlock started, “and…I think that would be acceptable. I really like you too, John, and I’m willing to give it a go if you are.”
“Oh, God,” Mycroft sighed, “I’m not exactly sure myself. Perhaps you could pay him a visit, talk to him, and see what you think. My conversation with him wasn’t very…productive. I’m afraid I may have dealt with him a bit… harshly. Gregory, I’m going to ask you something I feel I can because I know that you’re pals with Sherlock and value the friendship of both my brother and John Watson. Have you noticed anything between the two?”
position
“No he hasn’t been here, dear,” the woman shared. “I just assumed things were taking him a little longer than he expected. If he did decide to go to one of those cut-your-own places he may have had to travel a bit to get to one. Have you called the fellow he borrowed the truck from? Or maybe he stopped off at Molly’s?
. That last episode though, when he had thrown himself into the shit full bore…yeah…harsh…harsh. But all in a good days work, right Sherlock? Catch the bad guy; trick the villain. And all for love: Save John Watson. Killing two birds with one stone. And it worked, by god. It almost killed
“Ask who… what?” John Watson questioned back, giving the crisps bag on his tray another spin.
John tried to upright himself and found he could not. He reached his right hand downwards and quickly came upon the reason. Something large and hard was lying across his right thigh. He tried wiggling his legs and realized it was also across his left leg, just below the knee.
----------------------------------------------------
And then, six months in, Mycroft appeared at one of her weekly counseling sessions. She bombarded him with questions. Chiefly- why had no one bothered to come see her? Eurus sensed her brother’s uneasiness in answering. His response was that their parents were unwell, and it would be too much of a shock for them to see her in this environment. Eurus knew that was a blatant lie and never asked about them again. However, she had begged and pleaded with him to allow her visitations with Sherlock but was told that it simply wasn’t possible. Another lie.
“Good, because now I can do this…”
know where she was? Mycroft hadn’t elaborated on any of that. If they tried to explain to her now, was she in any state of mind to understand? Could she forgive
Sherlock sat back, steepled his hands, and rested his chin on the fingertips. “Because
“Sorry?” She inquired as she turned in the voice’s direction. The person behind it was a stranger. He had a mop of ginger curls tossed on his head, and amber eyes looking out through John Lennon spectacles. Those eyes looked slightly…confused…uncertain?
John has a talk with Mrs. Hudson.
“He’s got two listed. Asher’s Cut-Your-Own, and another with the ridiculous name of Benjie Bottomly’s Beauties.”
John sighed and gave Elizabeth a hangdog look.  “No…no I did not.”
seats, anyway?” Sherlock questioned.
“I think he’s sitting with the Byers twins today.”
sharing with Ms. Thompson. I don’t feel entirely comfortable writing it.
Mycroft Holmes sat brushing the mud off of his calfskin shoes. At five hundred pounds a pair, he did not relish the thought of having them sullied by the earth of that
He pulled into the lot. A string of lights hanging on a small hut were blinking on and off. John entered the building. No one was there, but a large piece of cardboard was propped up on a desk with the message:
. And to answer your question, I think Mary would be proud of the way we’ve handled her daughter. Rosie’s being raised by many people who love her…who loved her mother. I’m more nervous about explaining the whole scenario of her mother’s death to her someday. We can only try to do our best, Sherlock, and judging by the happy state that little lass is in the majority of the time, I’d say we are doing a bloody, fine job of it. Now, no more fussing. Finish your tea, and then maybe I have a little something to get your mind off the matter.”
Um…alright…where to begin? At the beginning I suppose, although I’ll probably end up deleting whatever I write here. I do not imagine it will be anything I would feel….
anyway.”
At that he felt a sharp blow on his right shin and jumped just a fraction.
Holmes was quite amused by the whole scenario. At least I guess it was amusement...could just have easy as been disgust, now that I think about it. He also referred to all the males in the place as “tools”. He then inquired if I were a dancer. Of course, I had to admit that I most definitely was not. Then: would I be interested in a short lesson…perfect opportunity as everyone else was tanked-up and would pay us no mind?
“God, he’d probably send Anderson or Donovan to torture me.”
The pair were on the road within five minutes.
And…Eurus. What the absolute
needed some time to concentrate solely on his daughter; and god only knew exactly what shape Mycroft was in. Besides, Greg had promised to look after him for a bit. Of course, there was always the hell hole that was Wiggins’ domain. But… no…bad idea. Bad,
are you dredging it all back up? And why now”
‘Ah, no…no I think I’ve had enough. I had quite a few pints earlier. But…please.”
He was very prim and proper about it all to start with. He had convinced the piano man to play some waltz or other and gave me a “walk through” the movements before we set to it. About two minutes into the real thing, I realized that I had found my right foot, and although we wouldn’t be winning any prizes soon, we were drifting along fairly effortlessly.
“You’ve got me there. I’ll go fetch him. You will join us, won’t you?”
But as the movie progressed, Sherlock found himself becoming very bored with it, but more interested in the activities of the other couples in their party. Ryan and Meera were sitting next to him with Elizabeth and Suzanne on the other side of John. There was a fair amount of giggling and whispering coming from the direction of the female pair and plenty of ‘ooh’s and ah’s’ from his neighbors. At one point Sherlock gave a fast glance at the couple beside him and realized they were engaged in some rather heavy petting. Meera’s blouse was totally undone and he wasn’t quite sure where her hands were…or Ryan’s for that matter. His eyes widened in surprise and he was glad the darkness hid his face as he was sure it was turning red with embarrassment. He cleared his throat and looked over at John.
“I was fifteen in January.”
He tried feeling around and behind him for something…anything he could use as a means of prying the branch off of his left leg. Nothing. The only thing that was going to help him at this juncture was his own strength and will.
Sherlock was the only one she had ever been able to truly connect with. Not her mother, not him. But Sherlock was just a young boy himself; it wasn’t fair to place the burden of his sister’s happiness and well-being on him.
Sherlock put the phone down… then picked it back up and punched in John’s number.
….silence…
He’d been walking the streets of London now for…how long? One hour, two hours….five? It was still dark, so dawn had not yet arrived. He’d long ago abandoned his watch. He’d looked at it once after returning to the mainland only to discover that the face had been smashed and the hands missing, so he threw it in the next bin he passed. No doubt it had happened when he went ballistic on the coffin meant for Molly. Molly. He would have to face her before too long, and he was not looking forward to that task one little bit. The thought of what he had done…been forced to do…made his gut clench and the bile rise again to his throat. He knew he had been thoughtless with her in the past, but he had been trying…seriously making an effort….to not do or say anything to hurt her. And now…
Sherlock only shrugged in reply which gave John a sinking feeling, but then, almost as though he could feel John’s misery, Sherlock reached over and patted his hand.
really is dead, by the way.  It’s so odd how she was so fixated on Sherlock. Maybe because they were closer in age?  At any rate, I guess they have her secured away. I really don’t know what ‘s going to happen to her.”
Within twenty minutes Molly was having difficulty navigating. “I…I don’t think I can be here anymore. I should probably….”
John leaned over to his left towards Elizabeth. “We’re going to Bongo’s.”
“The movie starts at eight, so we’ll pick you up around, say, seven? You might have to give me your address again.”
A large man with shocking red hair, commenced playing light jazz on a corner piano around 2:30, and a few still celebrating couples claimed the small space serving as a makeshift dance floor. An extremely intoxicated woman approached our table and tried her damnedest to get Sherlock to dance with her. He brushed her off with several rather rude remarks that appeared to faze her not a bit, and she turned her administrations to Mike, who was almost as smashed as she was, having downed two more pints and a double shot of Jameson Black Barrel since we had arrived. My friend happily accepted the lady’s invitation and proceeded to waltz her around the restaurant in a frenzied caper that in no way matched the beat of the music. Neither participant seemed to mind.
Sherlock sighed heavily. “Yes…okay.”
John smiled. “Being the ‘fifth wheel’ as you put it. Oh, not really. Maybe sometimes. Occasionally Elizabeth or Ryan will set me up with one of their mates, but nothing’s ever turned serious. I don’t know; I guess I’m just used to it. We’ve all been friends since we were toddlers. It is what it is. Anyway, I hope you’ll go out with me again. I…I hope you won’t think I’m rushing things, but…I really do like you. I’m glad you transferred to our school.”
He’d even considered that members of his own secret cabinet might be involved. Lady Smallwood had been going through some trauma of her own following the suicide of her husband. And the whole regrettable A.G.R.A. incident had, thankfully, turned out
“Well, in its defense, it
He really needed to sleep, but first he needed to think, or he wouldn’t even be able to sleep. Less than a week ago, he didn’t even remember Eurus existed. Or did he? For years he’d felt there was something…missing, something very important, but what it was always eluded him.
Yes, Sherlock Holmes had unsettled me….I found myself fighting against the idea of dancing with another man in public, regardless that my crazy heart was telling me otherwise. I finally persuaded myself that one little dance wouldn’t hurt and that, yes, everyone else was too involved in their own merriment to care.
And reaching up, he grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders and pulled him down to meet his lips once again.
“For the actual love of God, John!”
“You’re too good to us, you know,” answered John rising out of his easy chair. “I’ll get Sherlock. He’s upstairs having a nap, although if you ask him what he’s doing he’ll say research. He’s been ‘researching’ all morning. The back of his eyelids, apparently, as every time I’ve checked in on him he was sawing logs.”
The detective sniffed and hastily wiped his eyes.
“Oh, just clam it and get up there. Pretend you’re throwing something away then. Just…
The two men quickly gulped down their tea, and Sherlock dashed off to retrieve his outerwear.
am I supposed to make of that? The Holmes’ smile at me and I am bloody smitten? If anything ever warranted a visit with Ella…this is it.”
“No, I do not!”
Mrs. Hudson smiled. “He will have his funny little ways, as well we know.”
? I cheat on you and who does it turn out to be…Sherlock’s bloody, long-forgotten sister. Sherlock’s
“Oh, Mrs. H. that looks lovely,” John remarked, wasting no time inspecting the cart’s offerings, while holding Rosie. “I am rather hungry. Can’t even remember when I ate a proper meal last. Those sandwiches and scones will do nicely. Thank you.”
“That’ll be room service,” Mrs. Hudson remarked, as she headed for the hotel room door. “I took to ordering tea for us. I could have done here in this beautiful kitchen, but I think we deserve to be pampered a bit with all the hell we’ve been through.” She let the maid in, wheeling a cart laden with all sorts of goodies.
“In the summer, we spend a week or two at Meera’s parents’ vacation home in Brighton. We just lounge on the beach and have bonfires at night. It’s great. Other than that, we attend sports events or maybe go to a concert. Mostly we just hang out.”
“Says the many who once rode with a bloody harpoon, “John mumbled.
Richard and Amelia Holmes try to come to terms with the knowledge that their daughter is still alive. They both privately reflect on the past and their place in the future of their life with Eurus.
three shopping centres, one farmer’s market, three Christmas tree lots, and two chop-your-own places were listed. Sherlock reckoned Mrs. Hudson was correct in saying that most shopping centres and tree lots would be closed by now. And it was far too dark to be chopping your own.
“Some of the roads are a mess; there have been a couple of accidents that I know of,” Lestrade stated. “I hate to think about it, but maybe we should put in a few calls to some of the local hospitals.”
. According to Lestrade, some of the files I need are mysteriously missing.”
“Well…maybe he stopped for a drink, or had… other business to attend to. Wait, how was he getting two trees back to Baker Street?”
And thank god, because poor, sweet Rosie…
. He sat back as far as he could and looked across at his own seat.

“And you’d best put on a pair of warm boots, or at the very least some wellies. If we end up having to knock about in the woods, shoes won’t cut it.”
“I really am sorry about spoiling things tonight. I guess I felt a bit out of my element.”
“What the…it’s already past four and I told Sherlock I’d be back at five. Bugger this! Alright, tree farm it is. Do or die, I guess.” He consulted the list he had previously printed up and found that “Benjie Bottomly’s Beauties- Tree Farm” was less than two kilometers away.
call him? Do you have his personal number?’
Mike was visibly startled to see the man there.
Mycroft claims she is beyond their view, cannot…or will not…communicate with anyone now. But she knows Sherlock thinks otherwise. She could see it in his face. He would come up with something. He had to.
When Mycroft had summoned them to his office that morning she had suspected that it was going to be something disturbing, but his news went beyond that. It was devastating. Life changing.
“No…no he’s done before, but… hell, I just thought with Christmas and having your tree...and ours…and all…. Well, I just expected he’d stick to his schedule. I guess I was wrong. I’ll go phone Stamford. And Molly.”
, 7:10 pm
With one last massive tug, John finally managed to work his left leg free of the branch that had held it prisoner for many a long hour. However, in doing so, the branch shifted its weight on his right leg causing him to wince, although fortunately, it had moved lower on his thigh which afforded him a bit more upper body movement. He had little feeling left in his feet and legs and none at all in his hands. Throughout this ordeal, he had relied on his army training to help him muster all his strength and the prayers he was sending up to supply the will to keep trying. And then, of course, there was Rosie…and Sherlock his greatest inspirations of all.
John walked over to Sherlock and gently ran a hand across his cheek.
1 January 2010
Holmes looked up quizzically at his partner. “An ax or a saw? What on earth do you need either of them for if you’re picking a tree out of a lot? And how do you propose to take an ax on the tube without causing suspicion?”
Lestrade sighed. “You’re right, that doesn’t sound like John not keeping in touch where Rosie is concerned. So, where do you propose we start looking?”
“No…no. it’s quite alright, Mrs. Hudson. Honestly, I think I will move back….to Baker Street. I’m not sure how Sherlock’s going to fare long term. Well, as far as the drugs go, I mean.  We’ll have to keep him away from certain places and people…that Wiggins chap for one. Unless he’s willing to clean up and make something of himself, I don’t think he should be hanging around Sherlock. Meth labs in the kitchen for
“Closer,” John said. “But I’m…err…surprised you’ve never heard of them. They’ve been around since the mid-80's. I take it you never had any of the action figures or watched the cartoons?”
“Listen, listen to me, Eurus, you’ve got to stop this. Just stop it, do you understand? Sherlock’s not coming…he’s not coming…ever, so stop going on about it. I…I can’t help it. It’s not my fault. Just…please…stop. I’m leaving. I’m not sure when I’ll be back.”
“I see. So, basically, do I think there’s anything in the way of an amorous nature taking place. I’ll be truthful with you…yes, and I mean yes, I have thought about it. But if you’re wondering if either of them has made me privy to… anything, then the answer is no. Of course, they’ve always seemed extremely close, right from the start, but I really didn’t put
to know why I’m here then if you think your plight is pathetic. I kind of fell off the planet today. All this is to make myself feel better. Not sure if it’s working or not. Do you want to do these other shots?”
Within ten minutes John was back. He placed the tray on the coffee table and motioned for Sherlock to come sit. And he asked…
in the family.
They pulled into the parking lot of “The Regal” and the group went inside.
Sherlock looked down and then up at John with hooded eyes before raising his head to look on him fully.
“Well, they’re best friends…”
At that moment, her phone buzzed.
“No….no it’s…fine….fine. I am here…by myself. And here are our shots.”
“Not at all.”
“Right then. I’ll be off. Mrs. Hudson thanks again and Sherlock, I would suppose I’d be back by, oh say…five or so.”
“Hello, Sherlock,” they replied, almost in unison.
“Yes, Sherlock. What is it?”
“I love you for this, you know that. You’re maddening over it, but I love you for it. Now, I’m going to go into the kitchen and make us tea, and then we are going to sit and drink our tea, and

“Oh, don’t play the stupid card with me, Watson. You know perfectly well what I’m talking about. Do I need to spell it out for you? Did-you-ask-Sherlock-if-he-wants-to-go-to-the-movies-with-you-Saturday-night?”
John rolled his eyes. “No, Sherlock, I’m not going to Norway! I just want to take my time and find the perfect tree, or trees, as it were. I want to find something nice for Mrs. Hudson and Rosie. I realize that sort of thing isn’t of any importance to you, but indulge me, please! And if do decide on one I’ve got to chop down myself, well that will take a bit longer.”

Chapter 3
Sherlock stepped out of the shower and quickly toweled off. He debated between clean clothes and bedclothes. He really should …do something. He really should get some work done on his case…but….
“Come,” she motioned to John, “do sit down on these wonderful chairs. At eighteen hundred quid a week, I plan on making use of every single thing in the joint.”
“You’re not serious, right? You must know who the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are.”

He went to make another pot of tea, but by the time the kettle was boiling he had lost interest. He turned on the telly, but every channel annoyed him. He had to do something….something!
Lestrade grunted into the phone. “Go on.”
He was also going to have to find a place to spend the night…or what was left of it.  And after that…? At least it was just until 221B was set to rights. He knew he was welcome to occupy one of Mrs. Hudson’s rooms at the hotel, but tonight, at least, he needed to be alone. He really didn’t want to bother John anyway as he knew

And there was his roommate.
"Then you've seen my file!" Mycroft countered. "You know that I've already been assigned to kill Moriarty, so you don't have to-"
John blinked. "What?"

Mycroft was glad when he was gone. That Greg Lestrade was truly one of the dumbest, most distracting people he's ever had the misfortune of meeting. He wondered if there was any way he could request a new room, by himself.

"Yeah, that's what I thought," Greg muttered before falling silent again.
Sherlock's mind could not rest, however, for it was now buzzing with several new questions.
__________________________
"Why?"
John shook his head, chuckling. "You....are one interesting person, Sherlock Holmes."
"What the fuck happened?!" Moriarty kept demanding to know amidst his friend's cries of agony.
Sherlock was speechless. What game was this girl playing at?
The boys were interrogated separately.
"Anyway," Sherlock continued excitedly. "I should only have to study this list for a few hours to figure out who he is threatening. I will, of course, need to be left completely alone during this time."
"You don't get it, John!" Sherlock yelled, kicking his desk chair over. "I have one of the most exciting criminals I've ever encountered right at my fingertips, but I can't act until
the idiot? You're the one who didn't tell me that Moriarty's had his eyes set on me for years!" Sherlock was yelling while pacing back and forth with his back turned to John. "I had to dig that up on my own. Side note, you should let your
"Oh neat, we have chemistry together first class," John remarked excitedly. The taller boy just nodded, still unable to believe that he had met someone who seemed excited to be around him.
"I'll make it down there," Sherlock responded in a monotone. "They won't start right away, believe me. Just go."
Greg pulled back, but no more than an inch away. "Tell me you didn't feel that," he breathed against his mouth.
"FUCKING. MYCROFT. HOLMES!" He cried out in anger suddenly, kicking aside the nearest desk. He then put his head in his hands and continued sobbing even louder.
So he did.
"What? What did we do?" John asked, completely baffled.
Damn it. There was only one person who ever used Sherlock's full name like that, and he was horrified to see him emerge from behind a nearby tree.
Sherlock stopped, seemingly startled. "Oh. Right, yes. I have a theory. But first, Molly Hooper, I need you to tell me
and I don't know what the hell to do with them!"
After several seconds of attempting to restart his heart, Sherlock opened up the paper in his hand to read it.
"I'm not going," Mycroft replied, curtly.
Sherlock contemplated this question. What
Sigh. "Some of these need to be disinfected. Hold on," he grabbed some kind of cream from his kit. "Alright, hold still."
"Yes, I realise this now, thanks-"
Greg listened calmly as Mycroft blurted out the story and, much to Mycroft's surprise, did not look at him with disgust when Mycroft told him what he had done to Sherlock.
John, of course, didn't move. He checked the clock. 9:43.
unrest ensued. The silence was broken first by shocked murmurs, followed by terrified screams. Heads turned, eyes darting around the room and - unsurprisingly- several pairs found Sherlock.
"What's the matter? You've seemed stressed all day. Maybe I can help."
, he realized.
Mycroft looked up and followed Greg's gaze to the space under their door, where apparently someone had just slipped a piece of paper into their room.
Mycroft continued to ignore his roommate.
"So," said Molly conversationally. "How long have you two been together?"
"Christ, are those police cars?!" Greg exclaimed, glancing through a crack in the curtains. He pulled them back to reveal the same cars that Mycroft had seen before, now looking to be on their way out. Harvey was no longer down there; in fact, the courtyard was just about empty. All that remained were a couple of lingering officers examining a grotesque-looking stain on the pavement.
And Sherlock did. "What whathappened?" he said, looking quite dazed, as if he had just been woken from a dream. Then he noticed John, and his face turned bright red.
He wasn't sure what it said about him that his opinion of his friend never changed. That he visited Jim every week in that goddamn nut house, and on the day of his release their friendship continued like nothing had happened, except they began spending all their time plotting revenge against the Holmes family....
John did, however, spot Irene a few rows up. She was leaning back in her chair like he was, her own virtually sleepless night evident on her face, only she seemed to be making little effort to stay awake. Her untamed hair hung over her face to hide her drooping eyelids as she stared off into the distance, not particularly intrigued by any of this.
it isn't." Of course, Mycroft had always known. Moriarty wanted Mycroft out of the way specifically so he could continue whatever plan he had laid out, so using Sherlock's life as manipulation didn't make any sense.
As the boy sat by the window sill, taking drags from his cigarette, he wondered what his time at this new school would be like, and how long it would take others to decide that they hated him. It usually didn't take anyone more than a day. For whomever was misfortunate enough to be his roommate, it would probably take about five minutes.
"Well then I'll have to figure out the rest myself, won't I?" Sherlock said, his tone quite amused. "And if I die in the process-"
"What happened Sherlock? What's wrong? What are you thinking about?"
"But solving cases is fun."
But Greg wasn't finished. He left his bed and began pacing the room anxiously. He had clearly needed to say this for a long time. "If anything,
The boys were silent for a few moments until Greg spoke again. "Oh, I forgot to tell you. I met your brother at breakfast this morning."
before?"
"You two," said Molly, her eyes narrowed once again. "What are you guys going to do next?"
It was Mycroft. But he was hardly recognizable. His eyes were puffy and red and his face held greater sadness than Sherlock had ever seen in his brother.
The entire place was packed with older students, many of whom were already drunk. Some were dancing, others were pairing up and snogging in dark corners. The room was dimly lit with red and violet lamps, and a song Sherlock didn't recognize blasted on the radio.
"I understand this is...
"No. Just business."
The worst part was that Seb was sure Jim knew, on some level, about his feelings. If only from the brief looks they shared sometimes when they were alone, always before Jim would frown and look away. The message was clear: if Jim did know about Seb's feelings, he would much prefer they go unmentioned.
But it was pointless, and he knew it. Just like all those times throughout his preteen years when he had tried to do this exact same thing, only while reciting '
Then the boys entered the office, and it was only once he saw who was sitting there that John began to piece together what Sherlock had ages ago.
Sherlock landed with a soft thud on the grass and crouched there for a moment. He closed his eyes, mapping out the trip in his head before he started it. It was absolutely essential that he be back home by 1:17 in the morning (two hours and seven minutes from now) when Mycroft would wake up and notice him missing.
John did, and over the general sounds of talking and eating throughout the dining hall, he could just barely pick up yelling and scuffling from outside. There was something going on just out of view of the nearest window.
"God, please."
"Oh well," Moriarty sighed. "If you've truly gone this soft, at least I know that a brilliant mind won't be leaving this world tonight. Just a sad, boring,
Jim paused, allowing three seconds for questions if anyone decided to be an idiot. Luckily, no one did. "Excellent." he said, grinning wider than ever. He practically bouncing in anticipation, excited at the very thought of all the misery Sherlock would feel once his brother was dead. He couldn't wait!
No, there was no way that would fly with his boss. Besides, that was only part of the truth.
"Do you have them with you?" Sherlock asked.
At the same time that he realized he could hear the storm outside a bit clearer than he should be able to, Sherlock felt a breeze. He was near an open window....no, more likely a door. The breeze was coming from above: it was a door above a stairway. Yes, Sherlock's present location was coming together piece by piece, and he hadn't opened his eyes once.
Sherlock stared at him like he was being an idiot, which probably meant that he was. "John, must I bring up the fact that he
"Well,
But as Dixon neared them, Sherlock realized with dismay the possibilities of their third group member. They would either get Mycroft, making the next fifty-six minutes unbearably awkward for obvious reasons; Phillip Anderson, the painfully stupid boy who sat to the right of Sherlock and always tried to trip him in the halls; or-
Yes, Sherlock had lied to Molly Hooper slightly. The file he was looking through had a lot to do with Moriarty. It
In his defense, he had not expected his last job to take as long as it did. He'd had no idea someone could struggle that much.
"You what?" Mycroft did the interrupting this time, horrified.
"Hm?"
Then, there were voices:
The two men both raised their eyebrows, seeming delighted.
Molly looked at him curiously, but John didn't catch it. He was kneeling on Sherlock's chair by the window, trying to see if he could catch sight of his friend through the rain.
"John Hamish Watson."
"That's no concern of yours!" Jim snapped back, defensively.
"You have her all wrong," said Sherlock, smiling. Molly's interest in helping them had actually inspired him in a way, and he was a lot happier and more energized than he had been this morning. "You see her as timid and afraid because the last time we saw her she was so shaken up, but she's actually quite courageous. I could see it in her eyes when she was talking. She longs for excitement, like me and you.
Finally the boy set down his instrument and stood, straightening his coat as he did so. John noticed that the boy was over a head taller than him, and impossibly thin. "Sherlock Holmes," he said, and somehow his smooth baritone did not surprise John one bit. It just seemed to fit so well with the rest of him.
"A behavioral correction school??" Sherlock yelled in disbelief. "That's like a prison for teenagers! You're not honestly thinking about sending me there are you?"
As the clever boy sat in the grass, mapping out his route, he couldn't help noticing the fierce pounding of his heart and his shortness of breath.
detective!" Mycroft sank to the floor, his head in his hands. "Everything is so fucked up now," he muttered.
"Sherlock, are you alright?" John asked. Sherlock merely grunted in response, using all of his remaining willpower to keep himself as perceptive as he usually was. However, as he observed the random students around him, he noticed that it now took him over six seconds to deduce what he normally could in three. He felt empty and heavy, and he could hardly see straight.
feel this, and I will walk away right now. I'll leave you alone; give you all the space you want. Just tell me."
Jim whirled around at his cry, though his distinct concern was cleverly masked behind several layers of anger. "The fuck are you doing?"
He knew that Molly did see, but she said nothing of it. He was grateful for that.
"Do you think it's funny to disrupt my class?" Dixon asked in a threatening tone, no doubt amusing Sherlock rather than intimidating him.
?!" John exclaimed, incredulous. "Did you ever do anything fun?"
__________________________
Realizing this, John rushed into the bathroom and up to the mirror above the sink. He stared at his reflection; the panic he felt seemed to be written all over his face.
He pointed to Seb. "Help Irene with Sherlock and that John Watson kid. I want them in the storage room on the top floor until further notice. Molly's already there and should still be out cold. Leave her there. I'll take care of Lestrade. Any questions?"
"Calm down John," Sherlock whispered once they stood outside the door. "We'll be okay. I promise." Then, without thinking about it, he reached over and squeezed John's hand.
he urged Sherlock in his mind. If Sherlock was there, then everything would be okay. Nobody had to die.
__________________________
"Oh, come one," said Greg, exasperated. "Don't you ever share anything?"
"Really?" Said John, looking genuinely surprised. "What do people usually say?"
"Oh cut the act, Mycroft!" Greg snapped, ripping his hand away suddenly. "I saw you last night! You were shaken the hell up, and there's no point in sitting here and acting like you're over it already, because you're not!"
Greg, of course, now unoccupied, turned his attention to his favorite pastime of bugging Mycroft. He rolled his chair up by the window so he was right behind his roommate. "Hey Myc," He said with a smile. "Whatcha thinkin' about?"
Mycroft shook his head, commanding himself not to look at Greg's stupid lips, and fell into bed, even though he knew he would not be sleeping anytime soon.
"So how much of what you told me tonight were lies?" Sherlock asked Irene.
But as the hour ticked by and Mycroft didn't show up, Sherlock found himself growing increasingly anxious. Where the hell was he?
"Woah, how the hell did you learn how to write in Chinese?!" The boy asked, his voice full of awe.
"Wait Sherlock, we have to go to the assembly!"
John was taken aback. "Isn't....isn't that who you've been thinking about for the past twelve hours?"
was, anyway.
"Not all of them-"
"I read," John said without hesitation.
Mycroft's irritating subconscious reminded him, as he brought his cigarette to his lips and took a deep inhale.
"Sherlock, you're supposed to be giving your mind a break, remember?"
"We're going to start off with some breathing exercises. Everyone close your eyes."
"Well I wish I could help you Sherlock, but I really need to work on this essay." John said, reaching beneath his desk for a fresh piece of paper.
Greg laughed. "Sorry to break it to you mate, but it took me about twelve seconds to guess that he was your brother, and you two don't exactly look similar. It's the way you talk. Also, he seems to be under the impression that my name is Graham." Greg laughed again and resumed playing with his football.
rules which seem to have been conveniently
"Right, because you're such a robot!" Greg spat sardonically. "Not someone to be bothered with measly
"Don't care!" said Greg, still elated as he snatched back his worksheet and stuffed it quite roughly into his bag. "A pass is a pass!"
John started to protest again, but Sherlock turned on the shower. He only hesitated for another moment before leaving with a sigh.
Embarrassed, Greg quickly regained his composure by flashing a crooked smile at Mycroft and nodding at him to move along. "Get yourself cleaned up, mate," he said. "You look like shit."
"You are such an
Was that what
"You're right," he said, rubbing his neck in embarrassment. "I'm sorry. You hardly know me, and I've been unloading all my crap on you. It's just that....sorry. I-I'll shut up now. But by the way, my name is-"
he insisted, simultaneously telling his heart to shut the fuck up.
Two stories down, a man dressed in camouflage to blend in with the bushes revealed himself. Then, after triple checking to make sure the coast was clear, Mycroft dropped the letter out the window and the man caught it. He then gave the teen a brief salute before racing off to his next destination.
"I just don't know what to do with these boys anymore," their mother sobbed to the police officer, while their dad continued scolding them.
When neither of them answered (John because he wasn't able, and Sherlock because he simply did not care) the monster boy continued. "I was just wondering which of you was the insufferable prick who decided to grace the entire floor with a fucking orchestra performance at four in the morning. I'd like to beat the living daylights out of you." He cracked his knuckles as he waited for an answer.
"Oh, it's Korean," Gavin remarked, noticing the book. "All those Asian languages look the same to me."
"Er, hi," John said, ignoring his feelings of discomfort that increased the longer the boy looked at him. "I'm John Watson, and uhh....I guess I'm your roommate."
Sherlock stared at him blankly.
Mycroft almost smiled, he was so glad to hear his voice! But there was nothing to smile about yet. "This...this silence. It's eating me alive."
on Greg Lestrade.
Molly gasped. "Oh my god."
"Did I do these right?" Greg replied sheepishly, holding up his French homework.
"Boys!" Their mother exclaimed. For a few seconds, she didn't seem to know whether to hug them or smack them. Fortunately, she chose the former.
"Yesterday was incredibly stressful, and you're operating on very little food and sleep. Just relax your mind for awhile, do something fun. Here," he handed Sherlock the half-finished seventh Harry Potter book from his bedside table. "Finish this."
Skidding to a stop when he reached his destination, Seb took a moment to catch his breath. Only a moment, though. Then, he checked to make sure he still had his last syringe.
Sherlock waited impatiently while John rubbed his eyes and stretched before finally sitting all the way up in bed. It was only then that he looked properly excited. "So you've really figured out who Moriarty is threatening?"
"I- uh, well I...um," Greg stammered, seeming to lose his train of thought for a moment. "Well, I know you've been a bit stressed out lately, and....you know, I didn't see you at lunch, and when I came back you weren't here, and I....I got worried."
Since he had so much extra time, Seb went ahead and stopped at their room to change his clothes. The next part of his job would be quite messy, after all. He grimaced at the thought. Blood....he hated it. Not so much the sight - he had seen enough blood in his life to be used to it by now - but he hated cleaning it. It was impossible to get out of clothes, it took ages to scrub out of carpet, and the stench of dirty iron mixed with bleach gave him a killer headache. But he'd never tell Jim this. The last thing he wanted was for his friend to think he couldn't handle helping him.
And during this time, he had thought much about how Greg had been used against him last night, how his painfully obvious love for the boy had nearly cost him his life. How Greg could have lost
Somewhere in the back of his fiercely occupied mind, Mycroft vaguely registered his roommate's voice. However, he did not immediately comprehend it. He was far too busy staring out the window, wondering how the hell he was going to complete the task that he had already agreed to....
"Well my name isn't Gavin," the boy replied, matter-of-factly. "It's Greg."
Irene shrugged. "I suppose you can call that a lie, if you wish. But I'm certainly not on Jim's side."
"I expect you to be on the football team, and to make perfect marks in every class,"
Mycroft said nothing, completely absorbed in his phone.
Then, because the girl wouldn't get the hell off of him, and because Sherlock did not know what else to do, he pointed the gun towards the open doorway at the top of the stairs and fired.
"Speaking of manipulative," John piped up, forgetting his homework completely. "Are you ever going to tell me what she's blackmailing you with?"
"Yes. There's the door."
"I'm afraid that's classified information."
on me or something?!" Molly demanded, furious. She was clearly embarrassed about her anxiety.
"I'm going for a walk," Sherlock said.
John read the note and thought for a moment before answering.
"Y-yeah. Hold on." John dug around in his trunk for a bit until he found his well-read copy of The Philosopher's Stone. He stood up when he found it, and was surprised to find Sherlock right behind him, his hand outstretched. John stared right into his eyes as he handed him the book, mesmerized by how grey they were.
"Yes it is! I can see it in the casual touches, the prolonged eye contact, the smiles. You're both crazy about each other!"
"Of course I'm not," said Irene, exasperated. "This is just a sedative."
"Oh, I thought it would be!" Moriarty responded happily. "Of course, I knew it would only fool you for a few seconds, but it was worth the effort all the same. I just wish I could've seen the look on your stupid face!" He giggled, gleeful at the thought.
Irene threw Seb a smug look which made him want to throttle her. He even attempted to sit up in bed just to glare at her properly, but immediately regretted doing so. "OW!" he cried, jolts of pain shooting though his whole leg.
“Thanks, but you really didn’t have to do this,” John said with another shake of his head, but he couldn’t help but smile slightly. It’d been a long time since he felt like anyone considered him, really. It was…refreshing. Nice. “I’m John, by the way.”
John sucked in a deep breath, taking a startled step back, feeling his legs tremble and threaten to go out. Wh-what?!
“I’m glad I was the one able to help you,” John replied with an answering smile, pushing other thoughts away. “If you get into any other sorts of trouble, I want you to come to me, all right? Even if it’s just an electrical shock from a rowdy computer, all right?” he teased.
Ah, poor, stupid John. Confused, concerned, completely falling for Jim’s trap. Jim lift his eyes which were completely dry, but a hint of hurt played in their black depths. “Ah,” he said, seeming to force himself to smile. “It’s nothing. Really. I just suppose I’m a bit nonthreatening,” he said with a humourless laugh, though inwardly his laugh was anything but humourless and nonthreatening. “I’ve had more than one man coming to terms with their sexuality use me to figure out what they like before moving on to someone for something more…serious. Still, can’t say it’s not fun,” he said with another seemingly forced smile before taking a gulp of his brew.
With a breath that might have been shuddered, John slowly stepped into the room. His eyes moved—slugging, worn out—to
“If you burn down the flat while I’m gone,” John said in a strained voice as he grabbed his coat, “do us all a favour and make certain you’re inside it, hm?” With a roll of his eyes, annoyingly matched by Sherlock’s own in his typical prostrate position on the sofa doing absolutely nothing to help around the flat, John huffed and hurried down the stairs to get away from the walls that seemed to be closing in on him.
They spoke more about Sherlock’s job, some of his past cases, and amazingly enough John seemed completely enraptured by them. He laughed whenever Sherlock made deductions, as long as they weren’t offensive, and never failed to say “amazing,” “incredible,” “wonderful,” which really made Sherlock flush a little too often for his liking. John’s eyes always sparkled when he spoke to him, and maybe Sherlock was imagining it, but he sometimes thought he saw John walking without a limp.
, the voice had sneered as John lightly examined the red mark left on Harry’s face. It would bruise, but it could have been worse. They both knew that from experience. Harry didn’t stick around much after that, not that John blamed her.
Sherlock’s cheeks tinged a faint pink, but he forced himself not to look away. “Yes,” he said quietly, but unconvincingly.
John’s eyes widened again and he took a step back as thought physically struck, before stepping forward beseechingly.
John still didn’t know what he wanted to say or do. It wasn’t unheard of for soulmates to reject each other, he supposed, but he really didn’t want to put himself out there when John was trying so hard to be straight only to be rejected. Even still, there was something about the stranger, his thoughts kept repeating the same refrain.
"Good." Sherlock turned his back to him as he continued. "Because I...ah." He turned back around and looked at John, his eyes almost fearful. "John, I must be honest with you. I am completely out of my domain here."
"God, you just
"Please," Sherlock responded. "Security here is a joke and the teachers here are all idiots."
__________________________
Suddenly, there was a creak and Mycroft snapped to attention. The door to the roof opened slowly, and from the darkened stairwell emerged the slim form of Jim Moriarty.
the lights shut off.
"Yeah, well practically everyone is."
The first thing John noticed was that it was possibly the most beautiful sound he had ever heard. The way the bow seemed to gently kiss the strings, producing long, silky notes was perfection, and might've lulled John back to sleep....had it not been so terribly loud.
But Jim saw him. He immediately let go of Sebastian and grabbed his own weapon, aiming it at Mycroft.
His temper flared up beyond belief. "But of course, why would you care?!" He yelled, making Greg jump. "You're so stupid, you're failing every class! You don't care about anything but sports and looking cool and following me around everywhere I fucking go! You know something, Lestrade? Ever since I met you my life has been a living HELL!! I swear, being around you has made me so STUPID! More so than I ever thought possible! When you're in the room, I can't focus! I can't think straight! I forget who I fucking
"Well that's not going to get you very far, is it?"
One of the first things Sherlock had done after discovering Moriarty was hack into the school's student records and find out his room number: 203 B. Since then, he had been tempted several times to simply pay him a visit, but John had always been there to make him see reason. "This is the boy who burned his baby sister alive," John would remind him. "There's no reason to believe that he wouldn't be ready to kill you the moment you knocked on his door!"
With the resigned demeanor of the battle soldier whose job it was to wave the white flag, Mycroft lowered his weapon to his side before finally surrendering it to gravity.
"Mycroft,
"Sherlock, please answer me."
Sherlock, however, smirked back and pulled a small, grey device out of his pocket: a tape recorder. "I think I'm safe," he said.
Jim opened the door with a flourish and exited with a parting line. "I'll see you on the roof."
"What about your little friend, hm? What about John Watson? You think he won't go straight for the people you care about most? And you know, I'm not sure your relationship with him ends at friendship. If I can see that, Moriarty will surely be able to!"
Mycroft sighed. "No Lestrade, I'm playing angry birds." He showed Greg his screen which indeed featured an angry birds level.
"That is classified information," Mycroft said, still looking at his brother with disdain. "And Sherlock, I strongly suggest that you not get involved. Whatever Moriarty's plans are, my men are already looking into it. Your idiocy will only get you hurt. Besides, it's none of your concern-"
"It was for an
__________________________
For some reason, this made John laugh, which confused Sherlock even more. Why the bloody hell was this kid so nice? He had no logical reason to be, seeing as how he had obviously been bullied and abused his entire life. According to basic psychology, this should have made John a bitter, cruel bully himself. But somehow, it hadn't.
may have been the wrong word. They were both fully dressed and lying on their individual beds, with the intention of getting some rest before eight o' clock, when phase 2 of their plan would officially be put into action. However, neither boy was able to quit fidgeting. There were so many things that could go wrong tonight....
the one with the organization who took down Jim's father. But he had always been obsessed with you, and I didn't understand why....at first."
The boy gave a sideways smile that made John shiver. "Deduce me," he said simply. "It shouldn't take the great Sherlock Holmes very long."
John sighed and lugged his trunk into the building, bracing himself for whatever further misfortune awaited him.
in his overactive brain as something became clear. "Oh, of course," he said, through gritted teeth. "Of course!" He pulled out his cell phone and clicked some buttons before pressing it to his ear with angry force.
He looked out the window. "Oh," he said simply.
Greg sat down on the floor as well and put his arm around his friend. "I couldn't agree more, mate."
"Well then you should be," said Molly simply. "The romantic tension between you guys is palpable."
"YOUVE BEEN GOING THROUGH MY STUFF?!"
It seemed to happen in slow motion. As the book changed hands, their fingers grazed each other, and as John felt the same cold shudder from earlier pass through his body, he could've sworn- could he have imagined it?- that Sherlock's pupils dilated a fraction.
. He thought to himself, wiping drops of sweat from his brow. Everything, from the awful humidity to the ominous lighting, was telling him to go home. The city was dangerous at night. But he couldn't. He could never go home again.
"Good. And don't forget that I need my history essay done by Friday, and it had
"Not the first time my life has been in danger," Mycroft replied simply. "And it certainly won't be the last. It's the nature of my job."
Then the man brought in his son Jim, who apparently felt like he had a lot in common with Sherlock and wanted to hear more about him.
He took a deep breath and said it. "Last night, Viktor Jacobsen was found dead on the school grounds. It has yet to be determined whether this was a suicide, or a premeditated murder. Though admittedly....detectives are leaning towards the latter."
"I thought you weren't speaking to me." Sherlock muttered without turning around. The short blond boy to his left did turn, however.
of you," he turned to John suddenly. "Don't think I don't know you're involved in this somehow as well, mister Watson. And if not....well, you hang around Sherlock Holmes too much for your own good."
John couldn't take it anymore. "What the BLOODY HELL are you two going on about?!"
The fact that Greg seemed to think Mycroft was crazy shouldn't have irked him, but for some reason it did. He found himself actually caring what the boy thought of him, which annoyed him even more.
"DON'T SAY IT!" Jim roared. "Just....don't!"
"It's not important," Sherlock replied, curtly. "I just get bored. What, you never get bored?"
Irene batted her eyelashes. "That depends. How long can you stay?"
"What about you?" Sherlock asked.
John said nothing. He waited patiently, if anxiously, for his friend to continue.
“John whenever you get married I think you will be a faithful husband because you will get married to the person you love.” Sherlock didn’t mention how he hoped that person would be him. John buried his face in the crook of sherlocks neck.
“Do you think I’m a disappointment.”
The cab ride home was long. Sherlock had figured out John didn't want him gone because if he did he wouldn't have been impressed with him! Maybe John was never impressed with him in the first place... No, no that's not right. If that were true why would he have moved in? Maybe he thought no one else would like him? No that can't be it, John's is perfect why would someone hate him?
“Well my da-”
Her jaw dropped.
“From what I heard of your dad he was a prick. You are better than his impossible standards.” John didn’t say anything, he just gave a watery smile and mentally cursed himself for letting his doubts show. Sherlock was right, he could give his father the world and he would still be a disappointment, maybe it was time for him to date a guy.
"Sherlock" Lestrade's voice pulled Sherlock out of his thoughts. " Sorry to interrupt whatever you were thinking about, but staring into the air while standing over a dead body isn't a nice sight."
'What if he wants me to move out...' Sherlock thought vaguely. ' There's a possibility I pushed things a little to far after he cuddled with John...'
“Sherlock! Care to explain.” He spoke with the voice of a father scolding his child. Sherlock both loved and hated that voice. He loved it because he thought it sounded sexy, but hated it because it meant he did something that John didn’t approve of.
Somewhere deep in London, a phone’s screen lit up with a new text message, and a spider smiled.
Sherlock’s eyes were mocking.
“Besides, John, the entire subject of soulmates is pointless. I obviously don’t have one so why would I clutter my mind with such idiotic details when I could simply use that space for something else.”
- - - - - - - - - -
John hotly declared, hands fisted at his sides as he drew himself up more to his lamentably still short full height.
That was another thing he had studied regarding his sexuality. For all of Sherlock’s knowledge of the scientific definition of asexuality, he hadn’t known anything about the sexual orientation until he’d began looking it up. He’d joined some forums, some chat rooms, discussing with others like him what it meant. He had been pleased to know that asexual was more an umbrella term, and that there was such a wide array of them on the spectrum, but mostly he was just glad to know that he was not alone in these feelings.
.’ John wanted to scoff at himself. He was a doctor, for Christ’s sake, and more so had been in the army surrounded by near to naked men. He could say
Sherlock loved John. There was no denying that. He didn’t quite know when it happened, didn’t even fully know when he had even acknowledged it, he just knew that he was irrevocably in love with John Hamish Watson; army captain, medical doctor, and blogger.
It was John’s turn to roll his eyes, standing up to put his now finished tea in the sink. “Not everyone can be a superhuman, Sherlock,” he muttered mostly to himself, back turned to the detective and turned on the tap to run into his cup for a moment before turning it off and wiping off his hands. “Stay off my computer while I’m gone,” he ordered more loudly for the other man to hear, knowing even as he said it that it would only cause the man to much more definitely go through it once he left. “I mean it, Sherlock.”
John, well used to such a diatribe, simply smiled in amazement as he took in everything, though his brows were furrowed in slight confusion as he removed his jacket and hung it up. “Why is the tablecloth pink?”
Sherlock didn’t immediately call me an idiot or point out everywhere I was wrong, though he did look a touch annoyed and let out a sigh, so who even knows what he was thinking then. Normally by now Sherlock was spouting out some sort of observation of his, but instead he went right back to looking for clues. He hadn’t yet so much as spoken to the family except for a brusque greeting, leaving me to explain who we were and why we were there, which wasn’t too off mark for him, but it really seemed like he was delaying the inevitable and stretching out his clue searching longer than strictly necessary, especially considering that NSY had already taken what evidence they had found with them, which I told Sherlock. Who, true to self, once more reproached the police for their “clumsy” (Sherlock’s words, not mine!) handling of the case, reminding me that he wasn’t an amateur and that it was inevitable that the police—trained in such matters, though apparently not according to Sherlock—would overlook some vital clue or evidence and leave it behind in their “ham-fisted” dealings.
John was an adventurous lover. He’d tried all sorts of positions with the women he’d been with, especially during his tour in the army, so it wasn’t like he was unfamiliar with the allure of certain backsides. He’d just never before thought about applying such measures of attractiveness to men. Or, he’d never before allowed himself to
Jim took in a deep breath, but then he offered John a familiar shy smile, and John thought that maybe they would be okay. “I would really like to try them with you too, John. When you’re ready. I’m sorry I was so pushy. I just…after Robert came back, all I could think about was you, and I worried I lost my chance with you, and then I ran into you again and you were still so kind and thoughtful and even more handsome than I remembered and I honestly don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like you before, John Watson. I didn’t want to lose you again.”
Not that John wouldn’t be going home. Of course he was. So he stopped that train of thought right there. Resoundingly.
John, eyes focusing on his coffee so he didn’t sneak another peek at Jim’s backside—all right, at Jim’s perfectly pert arse through the towel that revealed far more than it covered, nodded and waited until the door of Jim’s room clicked closed before hastily reaching for his clothing from the night before. He dressed in military quickness, frowning slightly at a certain piece of his anatomy that protested the tight confines of regular clothes and not the freeing softness of Jim’s borrowed pyjama bottoms. Fuck. Jim was, beyond a doubt, male. John had felt that clearly last night, and yet…though one part certainly bothered John, he couldn’t help but be curious and…admiring of the rest. Jim was an
Sherlock snorted. “It’s obvious. You have a tan that doesn’t reach past your wrists, so you’ve been abroad recently but not for pleasure, coupled with your haircut and the way you hold yourself speaks of military. So most likely Afghanistan or Iraq. Wounded in action no doubt, traumatic going by your hand and your limp, which you seem to forget whenever you’re standing, so psychosomatic. You were inured elsewhere. Shoulder most likely, given your hand, though that’s really nothing to do with nerve damage, or at least not a lot of it. Your hand is steady when you’re distracted. Another psychological symptom. So really, obvious you have a therapist, and a rubbish one at that. Fire them.”

Sherlock wasn’t on the sofa.
A few days ago. That would be, John realized, around the time that Jim stopped replying to his messages. When he stopped getting them, apparently.
Speaking of the man, he was waiting outside of the bathroom by the time John got out, looking sheepishly enough that it didn’t come off as creepy, holding a drink carrier with three coffee cups in it. “Hi,” the man said when John stepped out towards him. “I didn’t know how you like your coffee, so I got sugar and cream for you as well.”
The glass from the door was, according to pictures, on the outside of the door, meaning that it had been broken from inside the house. The other broken glass from mirrors had not exploded outwards either, indicating that a covering had been placed over them to minimalize the sounds from any listening neighbour’s ears. The destruction items held no real purpose other than to be simply destructive, while the theft of jewellery and silverware was random, evidence by obviously more expensive items being left behind. It had been done to cover up the motive of the egg, the only thing stolen from the mantel despite other valuable trinkets on display beside it, and egg that not only was costly, but also sentimental. The last blow to a “demanding” father.
As he watched Jim stiffly begin taking off his (now bloodstained) shirt, John wondered just what Jim was thinking with all of this. First, he seemed just as interested as John was, then he dropped off the face of the earth, only to return battered and now flirting with him again. He didn’t know what to expect anymore, so he settled into his doctor role and tried to push their personal relationship—whatever the hell it was—to the side to deal with later.
Had he been alone, he might have given the matter more thought, might have looked up that sort of porn before his date after all, had it not been for his snooping flatmate. He’d enjoyed that sort of thing with women before, but two men? That would remain to be seen. When he had time to know that he had fully and properly deleted his search history, even in incognito mode. One could never trust secrets around a consulting genius.
“Detective Inspector Lestrade. He said you work together, that you’re like a freelance investigator.”
The flat was quiet. He supposed the Mrs Hudson was downstairs somewhere, sobbing with the news, but it wouldn’t change anything. It would never change anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
Or the things that happened after her.
Sherlock, hating himself for it, felt his eyes sting. That sounded almost like John ac—
“You look great!” John blurted, spinning back around to face Jim, taking the mug without thought. He felt embarrassed all over again about his outburst, however. “I mean…it’s not a problem.” He motioned with his mug, though he was careful he didn’t look down at Jim’s chest again. “Do you want anything more for the bruising?”
Right.
Though Sherlock had every intention of this taking place in the bedroom, where he had everything set up already, he slowly maneuvered John to the sofa for the time being. He knew John might balk if he was just thrust into this. He needed John to understand that Sherlock would do whatever it would take to make him happy. Whatever John wanted, for however long John wanted him.
He watched him, watched him and Sherlock solve case after case, watch them flick at his web and tear at his careful designs, which really was getting a bit annoying now. Matters had to be seen to. And soon.
Also on my
John shook his head, and there was no regret or resentment in his eyes. “How could I ever regret this? How could I ever resent you? You give my life meaning, Sherlock Holmes. We’ll deal with whatever comes up in the future, but if this is what I’m lucky enough to have for the rest of my life, just you safe and warm in my arms, then that is all I could ever want. More than I had ever hoped of having.”
“Some Metroline accident,” Becca shrugged. “Not enough for the A&E, so they’re here.” She dropped her voice then, murmuring out of the side of her mouth for just John to hear. “Sprained wrists and whiplash, a few bumps and bruises…but you’d think they were dying with how they’re going on about it all,” she mildly complained.
Sighing as he poured the black mana of the gods into his disposable cup, John briefly wondered what Jim was up to at that moment. A part of him wished that he could have stayed, that Jim hadn’t all but pushed him out the door, but at the same time he wasn’t certain he was ready for what staying behind might mean. Physically. He knew that he liked Jim, quite a bit, actually, and knew that he missed him when they parted. Did Jim feel the same way? He reckoned he did. He
Knowing the tall git was smug that John’s mystery date apparently pulled the plug on their burgeoning relationship—or whatever the hell it was—did not improve John’s mood at all. It was, therefore, probably lucky that he got called in for an emergency shift at the clinic that he hadn’t been expecting. He sometimes wondered if Sherlock knew that he was all but asking to be punched in the face sometimes. (Or all the time, if John was being quite honest with himself.)
John knew what he had to do, praying that it wasn’t too late, but the thought gutted him. How would his mad genius react? Even John’s inner voice was starting to get more snappish with him, which he really thought wasn’t fair, but it was what it was. John would have to tell the truth and hope that Sherlock forgave him. Hope that Sherlock understood that John understood that it didn’t mean they were expected to follow any
“You really should let me pay you for the coffee,” he said instead, like a coward.
Sherlock pouted, and turned away with a cough.
“Can’t you keep the freak chained up or something,” Donovan’s voice sneered next to him as he was staring off into space, startling him enough that he jumped slightly, almost guiltily so as if she could read minds and hear his thoughts. He took a deep breath, watching her pour her own cup of coffee with the station’s logo printed on the mug, feeling the familiar annoyance at her constant insults directed at Sherlock. “I don’t know why Lestrade even puts up with him,” she snorted.
such thoughts. With this change in the view of his sexuality, he had to admit that Jim had a
But then John Watson had to bungle it all up. It was quite rude, actually. Intolerable.
Well. At least not that sort of danger, John couldn’t help but think with a small smirk as he remembered how responsive the man had been beneath him and the sounds that had come from him. John glanced up and over at Sherlock’s reflection in the window, and for a split second it seemed like their eyes met as though a physical force held them there, but then Sherlock’s eyes flicked to something else with an unfocused gaze and John realized he’d only been imagining it all. Still. Best not to think of Jim and his sounds while in the backseat of a taxi with Sherlock.
His eyes softened, his skin naturally flushed as colour began returning to him, and he softly cupped John’s cheek.
It was Sherlock’s turn to snort. “He’s my glorified handler,” he muttered, but his cheeks tinged slightly pink. John saw Lestrade touching him. John left. Lestrade told him they were only professional. John came back. That meant something, but Sherlock was far to inexperienced in social interactions to understand what.
“Fight me,” he growled from beneath his mountain of pillows.
Seeming to realize he’d been staring, John startled a little before giving Jim a small, nervous smile. “Oh, not at all,” he replied, turning his gaze back down to his drink. “Er, I ordered already, sorry. What can I get you?”
John let out a heavy groan, but the wariness was gone again, replaced by resignation. “Yeah? And what did you think?” he asked, before a briefly funny look passed over his face at the phrase, before sighing and shaking his head. Interesting. A stirred memory? Most certainly Sherlock related. Ah, Jim had time to unravel it all later. He doubted his current scheme would fail.
John hesitated. He really should go home. He really shouldn’t wait a moment longer.
…beautiful, perfect, amazing John. His John.
“Is this your way of asking me out, Mr Worth?” John replied archly as he settled into his own seat, though his lips curled up slightly, revealing what he really felt about the matter.
“Um…” John licked his bottom lip, drawing it into his mouth after, and Sherlock had to remind himself not to stare. “Detective Inspector Lestrade is finishing up the paperwork to release you. I should…get back to my rounds.”
It wasn’t that John was homophobic, of course he wasn’t, he just couldn’t seem to move past the memory of his father, of the need to be the perfect child to make up for Harry’s own rebellion. He had to follow certain rules.
The rest of Sherlock’s time in hospital was spent similarly as he healed, with John stopping by whenever he had a free moment, even on the days he wasn’t scheduled to work. Sherlock didn’t know what to make of it, but he found that he strangely rather enjoyed John’s company. More than he would like to admit.
“Fight me,” Sherlock said the next time he saw John.
Sherlock did it again.
John Watson wasn’t unappealing, he’d already determined this, and Jim was a lot freer with his sexuality—whatever it actually was; he wasn’t too held up on labels, unlike a certain gentleman. He certainly wasn’t against serving his carnal pleasure whenever he felt like it, and he had to admit that he certainly felt like it last night, with John’s solid form pressed against him, the talented mouth of the doctor on his own, feeling the heat and strength of the man. Jim was quite safe in his own masculinity to admit what he liked, and what with being so dominating a person in the rest of his life, he couldn’t deny the appeal of letting someone else dominate him a bit in bed. And John, stupid John, had more than fit that bill.
John let out a soft groan as he awoke, a flare of pain across his neck and shoulders reprimanding him for his uncomfortable sleeping, causing him to grimace is it twinged along his old injury. It took him a moment to remember what led to such a position this time, as he was quite used to them after living with Sherlock and staying up all night for cases, and it wasn’t until he blinked his eyes and wiped the sleep from them that he remembered the events of the past night.
adventurous—so he knew that most men needed stimulation as well as penetration to ejaculate, and he wasn’t so selfish a lover to make anyone do the work he should be doing. Jesus. What would it feel like to have another man’s penis in his hand? What would it feel like to have
Catching sight of Jim’s small, shy smile and the sparkle in his deep, dark eyes, John relaxed slightly against the cushions, a small smile of his own curling his lips. Yes, it was all fine indeed.
“Mmm, Sherlock,” John breathed in a mumble against Sherlock’s lips, his hands automatically going to the other man’s hips to keep him steady. “What are you doing?”
As they’d mentioned in the pub, John was no stranger to sex, and he hadn’t earned his reputation in the army by harmless kissing, but it seemed different having the interest of a man on him. And Jim was interested. In him. John. Would wonders never cease? Even more wonderful, Jim didn’t seem put off by John’s preoccupation with Sherlock, though he made certain it was known that it was only professional between them. Jim hadn’t seemed to mind, and he’d laughed at more than one story John told about the dangers of living in that flat, and his hand had practically stayed on his arm all night. John had rather liked it.
Back in the familiar position of kneeling above a warm and willing lover, John let out a small growl of happiness before taking control of the kiss. He was comfortable in this position, in control, though his hands faltered for a second as they went to grasp full breasts that weren’t there.
It was after Sherlock came back from the dead, after he’d startled John who had swayed alarmingly like he might faint until his equilibrium had returned, after John let out a snarl and he’d punched Sherlock straight in the face. Sherlock supposed he probably deserved that. John didn’t fall into place beside him, however, not immediately. He had a new life, and Sherlock found that he was no longer a part of it.
“But…” Sherlock didn’t understand, but he did try to follow John’s lips to kiss him again, though John annoyingly moved back. “But you like sex.”
He knew that, had Jim been a woman, this wouldn’t even be a question. There would be no wondering if he were ready for a relationship. But Jim wasn’t a woman. He was a man—a
The doctor/nurse laughed again, smile growing. “You should probably eat something first.”
Note about canon divergence I forgot to mention previously. No, John is not cheating on Sarah Sawyer, in this story they broke up earlier than in canon. And by canon, I mean based off of John's online blog entries.
Hello! I'm terribly sorry for the long wait, but seriously. Life is insane right now. Finished one semester of college, then it was immediately my *coughcoughthirtiethcough* birthday, then I've been babysitting my goddaughter like mad because her mother, my bestie, is getting ready to pop out my newest nephew (surgery is next week) and THEN summer semester starts right on up! So I'm going to be between that, hopefully getting a job at the campus library, and babysitting a lot this summer. So listen, I want to thank you all for your incredible patience while I've dealt with a busy life (and that isn't going to quit soon) and writer's block. You are all amazing and I love each and everyone one of you.
“S-sorry,” he panted, turning away. “I’m sorry, I can’t.”
“Of course I love you, you daft twit,” John huffed in short laughter. “How could you possibly doubt that? Even Mary knew that.”
“I really don’t want to be a bother,” a familiar voice was saying softly as he was led back, causing John to stiffen where he was, facing away from the door. “It’s not even that bad, it looks worse than it—
, but something stopped him. His eyes scanned over Jim, taking in the way the drying shirt still hugged his body close, the way the jeans fit snug but low on his waist, revealing just the hint of the line of his pants, and then back up to take in the man’s guileless but hopeful expression. He wasn’t unattractive. Not at all. In fact, Jim probably could get the number of any bloke he wanted. Which begged to question why he was bothering with a has-been like John. The only person who might have rivalled Jim’s attractiveness was a certain detective waiting for his coffee, and John halted that thought in its tracks right there.
case,” he grumbled, slouched against the wall of Lestrade’s office by the door. His glare only heightened when Sherlock just waved a dismissive hand at him, not even bothering to look his way, while he harangued Lestrade for any interesting unsolved cases he might have on hand.
Idiot. But then we both are. I should have seen this all before, should have read the truth in your eyes, your touch, the gentle curve of your lips when I say something that pleasantly surprises you. I love you, and looking back on it all, I know that you love me. So quit being a git already and come snog me.
It wasn’t as though he was necessarily afraid that John would cheat on him or anything (at least that’s what he told himself) but that John wasn’t even aware most of the time that he
John waved her off, straightening and moving to put his things away. “That was my last patient, right?” He nodded in answer to his own question. “I’m gonna clean up here and then head out then. Call me if you need me again, otherwise I’ll see you Monday.”
Sherlock Holmes. John hadn’t allowed himself to say anything, not until he understood more about this strange, bewitching man. He had to know more. For the first time in…well, longer than he wanted to admit to, he wasn’t thinking about his gun waiting for him at home.
Because Sherlock—Sherlock who had reprimanded him for taking so long getting ready the entire way to New Scotland Yard—didn’t actually have a case of his own. No, the idiot instead had entered NSY with the sole purpose of harassing Lestrade for whatever case he could get his hands on…at least, as long as it was interesting. The rush out the door made no sense then, nor did Sherlock’s peevishness, and it left John with an even worse headache than he’d had that morning. Rolling his eyes, he pushed off the wall.
“Sherlock…”
John’s gaze lifted then, settling on the curly hair of the consulting genius, hesitating for a moment before swallowing and looking down at his palm. Right. Well. It wouldn’t hurt to save the number in his phone. Just in case. Then he wouldn’t have to worry about smudging the ink. It just made sense, really.
Well that certainly was better than John could hope for.
“I think, Seb,” Jim purred to his driver, “it’s time for…how would dear Johnny put it…the Misadventures of the Nightingale Mask.” His laughter, chilling and empty, wasn’t anything like what John had heard earlier that night, and it was very threatening indeed.
John leaned down to press a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head, smiling into the curls. “Come on. How about we go to bed. I had a long day at the clinic, and you seem like you’ve had a long day as well. I just want to hold you as we fall asleep.”
“I like you more,” John said simply with a shrug, which shut Sherlock up again. He grinned down at him. “Sherlock, I won’t deny that I’m sexually attracted to you. That I think about you when I wank. That I
Pressed up against John, snug in his arms, senses overwhelmed, Sherlock had never been happier. Despite his parents’ affection, they had never been much of ‘cuddlers’ with their children, though perhaps that was due to their children not being much of cuddlers themselves. Or so Sherlock thought he hadn’t been. Now, John’s arms around him as he curled into the shorter man’s side, he was second guessing that belief.
Jim scowled and crossed his arms over his chest. “Excuse me,
Slipping his phone back into his pocket, John continued on his way home, unaware that not too far away, his date was smirking in the back of his “taxi,” sober and eager to implement the next step in his plan.
Despite that, however, Sherlock could tell that John
“Hey John,” Becca at the receptionist desk tiredly stated as he walked in, having to step around several persons with varying injuries, all of whom looked disgruntled to be there. “Sorry to call you in on your day off.”
Besides, he didn’t even know if the date would end well or not. He didn’t know if he’d be seeing more of Jim or not. He still didn’t know if he even wanted to.
Where was Jim?
“Okay,” John’s mouth said without much discussion with his brain.
When, the next day, he found his little ace flag pinned to the wall above their bed, Sherlock began reconsidering his previous assessment, and thought maybe it would be nice to have their signatures on a flimsy piece of paper after all.
“I eventually got out. Kicked him out of my flat, changed the locks, even moved after a few months when I could afford it. He…didn’t go away easily, but eventually he stopped, and I didn’t see him anymore. I…I guess I sort of just forgot him. I was happier not to remember him. Until a few days ago,” he grimaced.
“John, the case!” Sherlock protested, reaching for him again, but John took a step higher up the stairs back to the landing.
John bit his lip, considering his words as his thumbs hovered over his phone screen. He took a deep breath before slowly typing them out.
John’s irritation fell away immediately at that. Though he’d never had an abusive ex himself, he had seen more than his fair share of suspicious bruises on patients, and it confirmed his earlier theory. “What happened?” he asked, though his voice was still stiff, though for different reasons now.
The man moved forward, placing the flowers on the bedside table, causing Sherlock to scowl at them. Hateful things. He’d bin them again later. He had more important things to discuss.
John grinned over his glass, and with a small half motion of a toast between them, they jointly finished the rest of their drink before Jim was reaching out for the bottle to refill their glasses. “Thanks,” he murmured, resting his elbow on the back of the sofa as he watched Jim. “So, we talked a bit about my sister, but what about you? Any siblings?”
Jim snorted quietly behind him, carrying two mugs of tea, towel more firmly wrapped now but still looking precarious as thought any slight movement might blow it open. “Here,” he said, holding out a mug. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to, uh, startle you with my appearance. Probably not the best sight in the world,” he sighed with a familiar self-deprecating roll of his eyes.
The problem, of course, was that John was an incredibly sexual being, and Sherlock…well, Sherlock was not. He’d heard the term asexual be used to describe him before, a scoffing offhand remark by Donovan after yet another case with a crime of passion being the cause, and he supposed it fit. He’d gone home and looked it up a bit after John had grown defensive on his behalf, back before they were anything together, and he had to say that it fit him rather perfectly. Donovan had meant it as an insult, but the truth stared at him in the form of the word’s definition.
He wondered if one could die of embarrassment. It had seemed fine, or fine enough, last night before he’d fallen to sleep, but the morning after was always a touch more awkward. What would Jim think of him? He hadn’t been lying when he’d said he’d like to eventually…do that sort of stuff with Jim, but he was well past his youth and shouldn’t have been freaked out by the feeling of another man’s…well, by another man beneath him. It wasn’t like having another man above or behind him—and he quickly pushed such thoughts out of his mind before he could picture that and find out just what he thought about such things—so he really didn’t know why he’d freaked out the way he did.
John huffed in laughter, rolling his eyes as he relaxed in to the sofa likewise facing him, and brought his glass up for a taste. The smoky flavour burned the back of his throat, leaving a pleasant warmth in his chest as he gazed at Jim. He considered continuing the tease, considered denying that he was going to after all, but the wash of alcohol again had him feeling quite mellow and…well, pleased at the prospect of taking Jim out on a proper date.
Jim winced. “He took my phone. Broke it.” He sighed, staring down at his beer but not drinking any more of it. “He read my texts though, beforehand, and I think that’s what really set him off. He got jealous. He was…always prone to jealousy.”
The man glanced up at him, a hesitant but wry smile curling at his lips, but it was the eyes that rooted John to the spot. They were black, an endless void, and John felt as though he were on the edge of a precipice teetering into the abyss. The man blinked then, and John shook his head.
It could be harder for listeners, however. If the speaker died, so too did the voice in the listener’s head, and there were quite a few times where the listener suffered a breakdown then, the loss of their soulmate’s voice and the strangeness of their own driving them insane.
“You know,” John murmured quietly. “I was going to ask you out on a second date. To dinner. In my texts to you.”
Jim laughed, resting his hand over John’s on his knee. “Maybe I just find you more fascinating,” he said with a grin. “I just want to get to know you. It’s been so long since I met a genuinely decent bloke.”
John moved into the kitchen, deciding to make a cup of tea while he waited and gathered his courage, and tried to ignore the voice in his head as kept pointing out that he was supposed to be brave. Supposed to be better than hiding with his tail between his legs. John mentally gave the voice in his head a two-finger salute.
He assumed someone told Mrs Hudson. He might have remembered her face. Was it him? Did he do it? Did he tell her he was homeless now? He couldn’t recall. He couldn’t recall anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So…what are your plans today?” John murmured as they finished up eating. His time, he knew, was drawing to a close.
John paused, the knowledge that Sherlock couldn’t tell that it was a man’s number causing him to smirk slightly. “I’d say early- to mid-thirties, actually,” he said with a touch of smugness. He glanced at the number on his hand, wondering if he should rub it in Sherlock’s face that it wasn’t a woman at all, but something held him back. Perhaps it was the whole talk about John accepting a man’s number. More than that, it was John with a man’s number and a tentative date.
he ever been truly serious about a woman? He tried to remember, but even Sarah had been…well, he hated to admit it, more convenient than serious, in retrospect. Which he had known instinctively and already accepted, but admitting that he hadn’t liked her all

A glance at the skull. Billy, he’d called it, much to John’s bemused amusement. A frequent expression of John’s. He wondered if Billy would become lonely with no one to talk to him. John wasn’t smart enough to entertain, he knew that. Poor Billy.
making mischief palpable.
“Keep your lips parted until it dries,” he murmured quietly, glancing up at Jim’s eyes that looked obsidian this close, like endless dark pools drawing him in, and which were watching him with a similar intensity. Suppressing a shiver, but not his interest, John leaned in a little bit closer and gently blew on Jim’s lip to hasten the drying. He watched Jim’s eyes close, heard the man swallow, and had to fight the overwhelming desire to kiss the man again. At this rate, Jim’s lip would never heal, and he desperately wanted it to.
,” the voice said, sounding as though they had stopped walking into the room once John came into view.
like to have sex with you. But doing that would be tantamount to rape, and I
“You won’t lose me, Jim,” John murmured quietly with a tender smile, moving closer to Jim. Almost as one, his arms opened and Jim moved into them, nuzzling under John’s chin and wrapping his arms around him, though there was nothing sexual about it this time. John wondered if it was strange to feel so strongly for someone he’d only gone on one pub date with, but there was something about Jim that just pulled him in.
The only fault John could see, of course, were the bruises and split lip, though thankfully it looked like the medical glue was holding strong.
“Oh, John,” Jim breathed, staring at him with wide eyes. “I would never just avoid you. I like you far too much for that.” He then bit his lip at exposing himself so earnestly, though he flinched at the sudden pain from his lip.
John nodded, knowing where the toilet was thanks to his earlier investigation, and headed that way to find the kit while Jim moved to the open kitchen area. He still wasn’t quite certain how he’d managed to find his way into Jim’s flat, only that he had taken one look at Jim’s face when he mentioned heading home and felt that fierce desire to protect the man rising again. He’d tend to Jim’s lip, maybe double-check that none of his other injuries were hurting him, and then go home. Sherlock would be worr—well, no, actually. Sherlock wouldn’t be worried because he probably didn’t even realize John wasn’t there. Again. John could just not return at all that night and Sherlock probably wouldn’t even notice.
"Sherlock!"
"NOTHING will fix this, Sebastian!" Jim yelled. He kicked his chair hard into the wall, leaving a visible dent in the paint. "Nothing! It's all ruined!"
"Yeah yeah." He slammed the door behind him.
"That's all I needed to hear," Sherlock interrupted. "Good day." Then he sat at his desk and opened his laptop, seeming excited.
"I can't believe you let them get a hole of your scarf," Mycroft said, handing the article of clothing to Sherlock.
Sherlock glanced over at John and was pleased to see his look of revulsion. He didn't like this anymore than Sherlock did.
"Oh, I'm sorry!" Molly backtracked. "Is it alright that I know? I mean, I know you guys are hiding it and that's why I haven't mentioned it before-"
But their parents' stone-serious faces made it perfectly clear that they were not joking. "No," said Mycroft. "No! You can't- I didn't even do anything! It was all Sherlock."
As soon as the man was out of sight, John's dad yanked him through the doorway, shutting and locking the door behind them. John found himself grateful that the officer hadn't come inside. The place was just as trashed as it was when John had left, with empty beer bottles everywhere and bloodstains on the kitchen walls. His mother was passed out on the couch, with bruises covering every inch of her face. John was relieved to see her breathing.
"Would you hurry up and commit suicide already?" Sebastian yelled at Mycroft from across the roof. "I'm freezing my bullocks off out here."
Mycroft panicked internally as he hammered back a response with less than his usual calm demeanor.
"Positive," said Sherlock. "Believe me John, if it was anything you needed to know, I would tell you."
Mycroft glanced down at himself, unsure of what his suit had to do with his job.
No. Sherlock couldn't let this happen.
Still, he had to check.
It was only then that Sherlock noticed he was shaking. Not only that, but his mouth was dry, his face was hot, and his heart was beating at an unreasonable pace. "Yes," he replied through gritted teeth, even though all signs and symptoms pointed to a panic attack. He took a few deep breaths to calm his nervous system, which had evidently decided to act up under the myriad of stressors he was currently under.

Sherlock chuckled. "Why didn't you say anything?"
October came with gusts of cold air and heavy autumn rains, keeping spirits rather down overall, but otherwise life was normal. Teachers handed out homework, students misbehaved, Mr. Dixon was a dick; everything was business as usual. No murders. No suspicious incidents. Nothing interesting at all.
The clock read 9:44.
"Hey there sexy," she whispered provocatively, tucking a long strand of wavy brown hair behind her ear. "You're Sherlock, right? Sherlock Holmes?" She breathed his name in a tone that might've brought any other teenaged boy to his knees.
"Y-yes. Yes, of course," Sherlock recovered quickly. "If you'll forgive me, my mind is a bit....a bit scattered right now."
I swear to god, she's such a manipulative bitch!"
The first thing Sherlock heard when he woke was the sound of hundreds of footsteps outside his door, all heading in the same direction. The voices accompanying the quick-moving feet were loud, confused, and panicky. He attempted to single in on a lone voice or two to figure out what all the commotion was about, but it was too difficult, so instead he opened his eyes.
Shaking from both pain and rage, Mycroft stood up to face his adversary.
"I've got a party to get ready for, don't I?" Sherlock answered through the door.
The "classroom" looked more like a lounge room than anything else, only there weren't any chairs. Just several cushions set up in a circle on the floor. Their teacher, a young blonde woman named Miss Sandy, sat in the middle of the circle, appearing to be dressed for yoga. Sherlock hoped to god that wasn't what they were doing.
His room was empty, Jim having left long ago to take care of his own part of the plan. As Seb traded his khakis and checkered button-up for a pair of old ripped jeans and a t-shirt, he allowed his mind a few minutes to wander into Forbidden Territory, something he had not permitted for a long time: Jim. His partner in crime for about five years, his best friend for much longer. And the boy he loved.
Sherlock held up the remaining portion of his cigarette. "I was merely being polite. I know how you hate it when I smoke in our room, so I was-"
"Hey, where were you during Eng-
"Has it even occurred to you that you could tell them that you had nothing to do with any of this?" He whispered. "That you have written proof that it was all my idea? You'd be telling the truth, you know."
9:45.
"But it hurts!"
After some searching, John was able to find two empty seats in the very back. He heaved a sigh as he practically fell into one of them, sinking down lazily, and briefly considered just leaning back and taking a nap. It wasn't as if he had gotten much sleep the previous night, not counting the few hours during which he had been in a drug-induced coma. But instead, he sat up and scanned the auditorium for familiar faces. He felt like that was what Sherlock would do.
"Oh believe me, I will!" Sherlock yelled, wiping his eyes angrily and returning to the story.
Viktor gulped, shaking in fear. Despite the way he had treated him and John at the beginning of the year, Sherlock could not help but feel sorry for the boy. Moriarty must have roughed him up pretty badly to make him this frightened.
Dixon's face turned a frightening shade of purple. "Detention, BOTH of you!" He yelled, pointing fingers at Sherlock and John.
Neither boy left their seat, however. Of course they knew that they couldn't
Mycroft was right.
What was with all these emotions all of a sudden? Maybe he was still frustrated about his fight with Sherlock, and his predisposed annoyance was making him more easily irritated in situations that he normally wouldn't care about. Yes, that was probably it.
"I tried, but there was nothing open for them to move me to. That's the only reason you're still stuck with me. But if someone gets kicked out or something, don't worry. I'll be first in line to move into their room."
Mycroft didn't reply. His eyes were shut tight. Every one of his muscles was somehow frozen and hot simultaneously. As hard as he fought to ignore it, his first and only instinct right now was to knock Greg backwards onto his bed and do the most wanton things to him.
Sherlock just laughed. "Safe. There's a concept." But then his voice grew serious. "....You too. I mean it."
___________________________
drug dealer? Did you not see his shoes? His fingernails? God, the signs were everywhere. Your poor deduction skills disappoint me."
"Yeah, I get it Mycroft, I'm an idiot-"
"Yes, but I was a bit preoccupied trying to protect my little brother."
"What do you do for fun?"
Mycroft tried again. "Really I...I need to apologize, Greg. I need you to know how truly sorry I am–"
"....Yeah," Sherlock responded, strangely quiet. "But I also shot Moriarty's partner and ruined his well-though-out plan, which means he now has an even greater vendetta against me and everyone I care about than before." He glanced down at John so quickly, one might have thought they imagined seeing his eyes move. "So, you know....it all balances out."
"I have to-"
"Very amusing, yes." Mycroft growled.
half the time, that's how stupid you've made me!!! If it weren't for you, I would've killed Moriarty before he had a chance to put a plan into place! But you slowed me down! And now my little brother and I are both screwed! AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!"
"Time to go yet Sherlock?" John asked desperately.
"Now, are you still going to try being clever?" asked Moriarty.
Mycroft opened his mouth, almost feeling as though he was. But God, there was so much to say.
The hand that pushed against his chest, stopping him in his tracks, was a manicured one with fingernails painted the same blood-red as her lips. The hand belonged to a girl who could hardly be called a girl; everything about her was so....womanly.
The entire process was incredibly boring for Sherlock, although he was a bit frustrated that no one seemed to believe he had just wanted the drugs for an experiment.
"Wait! Come on Myc, let's think about this." Greg put a hand on his friend's shoulder, trying to stop him, but Mycroft shrugged him off.
necessarily, but-"
Sherlock looked up at him, obviously impressed. "Yes it is," he said. "Well done, John."
But before she could continue, there was a loud knock on the door. They shared a look of confusion. It wasn't Sherlock; he would never knock, anyway.
Seb fell back on his bed, groaning as he reluctantly turned his attention back to Irene, who began explaining her brand new plan.
"Oh, heavens no. I found peek-a-boo redundant and extremely tedious, and I told my father so."
Sherlock snapped his head up suddenly. His grey eyes looked vacant and unfocused, and John knew that his mind was working a million miles an hour, making deductions that the other two couldn't even begin to understand. After a few seconds his eyes widened, as if the final piece of whatever puzzle he had been building in his mind had finally clicked into place. He smiled. "Oh, this is too good," he said.
"Well....you've certainly given me quite a bit to think about," John's dad said, with the most satisfied expression John had ever seen him wear. "Thank you very much, Officer...." He searched for a name tag.
John stared at the closed door in disbelief. "But....surely you must realize that it will look suspicious if you don't show up!"
He knew that he was the quickest to overcome Irene's strong sedative, and he immediately knew why. Hypnotic drugs were the first he ever experimented with, back when he was eleven and just wanted to cure his insomnia. However, pills never worked for him, so he ended up developing a dependence on an injectable version he found with Mycroft's secret-service stuff. He remembered how Mycroft flipped shit when he found out, and forced him to quit cold turkey.
Sherlock paused. What was that? An insult? A compliment? If it was the latter, did that make them friends? How long were two people required to know each other before they became friends? He needed to ponder this further.
Still nothing. John sighed and did what he saw to be the only option: he walked straight up to his roommate's bed, shook his shoulders violently and yelled "Sherlock Holmes, snap out of it!"
Sherlock unsurprisingly had a taxi already waiting, but surprisingly hadn’t gone off without John as though somehow expecting John to teleport wherever it was they were heading. Or whatever it was that went through Sherlock’s mind every time he left John behind whilst simultaneously expecting John to always be a shout away. He was clearly impatient, however, and scowled as John apparently took too long sliding into the backseat of the cab. Ducking in after John, he snapped the address to the cabbie after a glance at the folder still in his hands and then they were off.
The morning after.
Ridding himself immediately of that sort of thought, having no interest to go down that road, John instead turned his attention back to Jim and his upcoming date. And the possibility of a very real
man, his brain couldn’t help remarking on, reminding John of the look and feel of Jim’s body against him—and with that came certain difficulties. Though the world was far more progressive now than when he was in uni, there was still a certain stigma surrounding same-sex couples, especially male same-sex couples. Was he prepared to deal with that? To be…out?
John stared at Sherlock, unmoved by the act. “And would it make you happy, Sherlock? To stick your arse in the air and let me bugger you?”
“I tried texting you a few days ago,” he quietly pointed out, hoping for some kind of confirmation, or explanation.
Turning at his approach, Jim’s smile faltered as his eyes slowly drifted first down John’s body and then even more slowly up, taking in the still slightly damp spots where John’s shirt clung to him a little more. He swallowed, letting out a heavy breath as he turned away, which both made John feel warm with a flush but also like a proud peacock. Though his self-consciousness had been sparked by Jim’s initial reaction, his ego had been stoked a little by realizing just what Jim’s reaction meant. He was still continually surprised at every show of attraction Jim displayed towards him, though he made him wonder if he ever looked the same.
“Don’t,” John choked out, closing his eyes with a small groan as he felt the wet heat of Jim’s open mouth against the sensitive skin of his neck. There was a slight rasp of Jim’s own stubbled jaw which was different from anything he’d ever experienced, but it wasn’t too off-putting. John was too focused on the way Jim’s tongue felt as it flicked against his throat. Jim’s hand began slowly caressing John’s chest as his lips and tongue moved back up John’s jaw. John’s own hand moved to curl into the dark hair of the man against him, momentarily at a loss for the length he was so used to, but then Jim’s hand was slipping her his shirt as their mouths met, and all other thought was lost to him.
John's sexuality crisis continues.
Not everyone had one. In fact, John supposed he was one of the lucky few that did. It wasn’t necessarily rare to have a soulmate, but it was special, and it was coveted. There were those that were born without soulmates who grew jealous at the connections other had, and there were those who had believed they were without soulmates and accidentally married the wrong person, causing quite a stir.
John nodded, but Sherlock, not sure if he was still being rhetorical or not, stayed silent. Mycroft sighed.
Ah well, live and learn.
Finally, he decided that if John was going to judge him, it would be better to end this friendship now. "I attempted to purchase several grams of cocaine through the black market, only to find out my drug dealer was an undercover cop."
Sherlock stared at him, his smokey grey eyes doing the thing where they seemed to be absorbing him. John shifted in his seat.
John stayed silent, taking that as their cue to leave. Knowing how much his friend enjoyed having the last word, however, John expected Sherlock to give Harvey one last smart arse response. But instead, the clever boy simply nodded and exited the office silently with John and Viktor.
BANG. "Fucking-" BANG "-stupid-" BANG "-moron-"
Thankfully, however, the thought was fleeting. Sherlock scoffed at himself, mentally commanding his amygdala to stop this nonsense. This was for science. Emotions had no business here.
"Hey Myc," Greg greeted him with a wink, receiving a glare from Mycroft. "Where were you at lunch?"
screwed up. If you would just listen to me-"
"Oh, cut it out John, I know you're awake!"
__________________________
"No!" John interjected right away. "We've been over this, and you're not risking your life like that!"
John wondered, but decided not to ask.
"Don't worry Molly Hooper, it was nothing that concerns you. Now, as for Moriarty," Sherlock finally began his explanation while Molly fumed. "I remember his case exactly. For the brutal murder of his sister he was sentenced to a year in an asylum and four additional years in a behavioral correction facility. That's why he's here. However, he's known about me for a long time. I know how and why he's heard of me now, but I still don't know
Just another part of the whole truth, and another statement that would get him fired faster than he could blink.
Mycroft grabbed his brother's coat collar and shoved him up against the thin wall of the shed in anger. He refused to let Sherlock make this mistake. He had to protect him. "This is just like you! Someone follows you around for two months, puts up with your attitude and calls you clever, and you think you're in
Was he talking about his experiment journal or his
John stared at Sherlock in awe, and the large boy looked for a second- unbelievably- like he was about to cry. Instead, he grabbed John's tray of food and dumped it on Sherlock's head before racing out of the dining hall.
John just stared at him in shock. "Other than that....I generally just wait around for something exciting to happen," Sherlock admitted.
"I'd assume so," Mycroft replied, getting his bag ready to go to his next class (inconspicuously placing his gun in it as well).
Slowly but surely, Sherlock felt himself dissolve into these feelings stirring up within him, which was
"Myc...." Greg's voice was filled with terror. "What the hell happened last night?"
Greg just shook his head in disbelief, taking a step back. "Why are you still pretending to care about me?" he asked, his voice filled with pain. "You've made your feelings clear already. We may be roommates, but you don't have to talk to me ever again. I know that you hate me, that you think I'm stupid and you wish you'd never met me. Why are you pretending now? Honestly, what are you gaining from this?"
"No-"
Despite his protests, John examined his injuries. Sherlock tried to ignore the shivers he felt at his touch. How his warm hands felt so incredibly soft on his face-
president of America is."
"I was holding my phone sideways."
Greg shrugged, still chuckling himself. "I don't know," he breathed, wiping away a tear. "I've never laughed at someone calling me an idiot before."
Unwilling to answer himself on that one, Mycroft eased his hand out of Greg's. Then, very slowly, he inched himself out from under the boy until his head was resting on the blankets rather than on Mycroft's chest. He stood up, stretched, and turned to observe how Greg lay slumped at a ninety degree angle onto the bed.
"Why postpone it?" Mycroft replied bitterly. He headed for the door
If possible, Jim's convoluted plan had just become even more interesting.
"Here we are, 231 A!" Sherlock announced when they reached their destination. There was already annoying pop music blasting behind the door, in addition to the voices and laughter of what John assumed to be maybe thirty other kids. He couldn't help wondering if Irene had invited any of them the way she had invited Sherlock....
Unexpectedly, John burst out laughing. "No, seriously Sherlock. What are you here for?"
"Um....
Unfortunately, all it earned him were scornful laughs from the policemen and an eye roll from Mycroft, and both boys were shoved into a patrol car and driven to the station.
"Yes, I do."
But also, Sherlock noted, extremely vicious.
did this? What happened?"
Just before the duo walked away, however, Moriarty added, "And even if someone
John suddenly remembered one of the things his father had demanded he do while at this school. "Hey, when do those start by the way?" He asked.
came Harvey's voice, sounding frantic and out of breath, as if he had run all the way from the courtyard to his office.
Sneaking out was easy enough for Sherlock, even though his bedroom was on the second floor. Graceful as a feline, he was quite good at jumping from high places, always managing to land on his feet. Heights didn't scare him; in fact, they thrilled him.
"....Okay," John said, nervously. "I'll just...go over there for a bit." He retreated to a corner close by, so he could still keep an eye on Sherlock and Irene, even if he couldn't hear what they were saying.
Then, with a resigned shrug, Moriarty passed Greg and his gun over to Sebastian so that he could focus entirely on Mycroft. He led the boy toward the edge of the roof, leaving Sebastian to stand with Greg directly in front of the open doorway.
Sure enough, about two minutes later. "No....no. This is unacceptable!" Frantically, Sherlock started flipping through the other Harry Potter books sitting on his desk. "Where in this series does it say that thrown inanimate objects can travel with apparating wizards?!"
"....Good point."
Greg's eyes widened, but then he chuckled nervously. "You're still joking, right?"
"You know, you and your brother are a lot alike," Greg remarked.
"It's crucial international business involving Afghanistan and nuclear weapons," Mycroft recited, still not looking up from his phone. "I'm currently in a heated texting debate with Osama Bin Laden, who is intent on killing American President Roosevelt and taking over the Western Hemisphere unless I supply Al Qaeda with nukes."
Their savior put his arm around the bully's shoulder (with some effort, since he was quite a bit shorter). "Now Viktor, we've talked about this," he said. "You can't be on the team if you keep getting into trouble, and I can't lose another good player. Now beat it before a teacher sees you."
The water in the sink ran red as Jim washed his hands of the stupid boy's dried blood. To him this was the most tedious part: erasing the evidence. He still had to hand wash the several bloodstains out of his suit. If only that boy hadn't been so difficult....
They had quite a bit of fun with this, both of them claiming to have been arrested for brutally assaulting their previous chemistry teachers. John said he stabbed his in the neck with a pencil. Sherlock topped this with a frighteningly detailed story involving hydrochloric acid and it's effects on the human body.
to explain what you mean before I gut you."
"Are you sure you want to do this
know that, right?....Then, DO IT! What's stopping you?"
For just a moment, he forgot that he hated him. "Jesus Mycroft, are you alright?" He asked, offering a hand to help him up.
, he mouthed.
"Better than you can prove your accusation."
The surface on which he lay was hard without the slightest give.
"I'm not taking them, you moron! It's for an experiment-"
"No it isn't," a new voice responded, causing both boys to whip their heads in its direction.
This logic irritated Sherlock, but he had to admit that John was right. "Well if I can't do anything, you could at least let me smoke," he said, not even giving John a chance to argue before he swiped the pack from his hand. Then, he turned to leave the room. "I'll be outside."
Mycroft whirled around, instantly intrigued. Both him and his brother shared a hatred for morning meals. "He goes to breakfast?"
Molly politely turned away, smiling.
The ropes that had held Sherlock's wrists together mere moments ago fell away, but still he didn't move. He and his friends were obviously being held on the fourth floor of the building, near the exit to the roof. Only Irene was there to supervise them, which meant that Moriarty and his other cohort were otherwise engaged, most likely on the roof....doing what?
"Really?"
"Because," she said, running her fingers through his curls and smiling when he shivered involuntarily. "I've switched sides, my love, and I need you to know it's because of you. I didn't care who I had to hurt until I found out this Sherlock Holmes boy was so..."
"Did he?" Greg replied. "Well I apologise if he was a dick. I can assure you I'm not like him."
"Well, I have to get to class," said Molly quickly, attempting to rush out the open door and join the mass of students, but John pulled her back in and shut the door.
Molly took a seat and pulled her chemistry homework from her bag. "Thanks," she said. "Kind of hard to focus back at my place. My stupid roommate is setting up for some party she's having tonight."
So there he stood, with over £1,000 in his bag, waiting for his guy to show up.
The bell rang then, and both boys stayed seated, glaring at each other. Three seconds later, they busted out laughing. They laughed so hard they fell out of their seats, and the French teacher glared at them until they left.
, but then closed it and shrugged. It wasn't as if he was anxious to go in, anyway. He joined Sherlock against the wall. "Three more minutes then."
"Greg....just shut up."
"I just don't understand," said John. "Why is she so interested in helping us stop a murderer? She strikes me as the type of girl who would insist on telling an adult about this-"
"Sherlock, where are we going?"
"Alright," John said, throwing his hands in the air, but still smiling. "If you insist, I'll leave you alone
Their voices grew louder as the two came closer to Mycroft's and Greg's hiding place. Mycroft held his breath, eager to see the face of Moriarty's female companion. Why was her voice so familiar?
" Sherlock protested, panicking as John gingerly rubbed the ointment over the places where his skin had broken open. His touch was so gentle and caring, and Sherlock craved more.
"You sure?" said John.
Meanwhile, the brilliant spy Mycroft Holmes went back to his house, ignored his parents who asked how "summer camp" in Ireland was, ignored his twelve-year-old, inevitably doomed little brother who wanted to know why the hell he had
John and Viktor were frozen in their seats, mesmerized by the confrontation going on between them, and for about five seconds you could have heard a pin drop in the office.
"I never said anything about
John could hardly get out anymore than his pathetic "it's not what it looks like" before the officer confiscated his duffle bag, slapped handcuffs on his wrists, and hauled him to the station.
Jim smirked. "Are you sure, Moran?" he asked, referring to him by his last name.
"I know it's hard to accept," said John, sympathetically. "But you have to keep reading. You can write an angry letter to J.K. Rowling later, if you want."
"He has to be," said John, his voice cracking. "He's Sherlock Holmes. If anyone's going to fix this, it will be him."
"What should I read next, John?" Sherlock asked, out of nowhere. He spoke so randomly, in fact, that a startled John slid his pen across his paper mid-sentence, ruining his English essay.
going alone!"
"I should have done it weeks ago," Mycroft responded simply, still staring straight ahead of him as he walked with purpose. And it was true. He had delayed this for too long, and he wasn't even sure why anymore. Consequences be damned. It was time to kill Jim Moriarty.
Silence from both boys.
I'll stay with you." Greg pulled up a chair, and now it was him holding Mycroft's hand at his bedside, not the other way around.
As John carefully made his way upstairs, he was horrible conscious of the clothes he had worn the previous day, as well as the far more herbal scent of shampoo that, while still masculine, was not his usual brand. He bet it probably cost more, too. He’d never arrived last night, now he was showing up after breakfast…Mrs Hudson no doubt noticed. Had she said anything? Would Sherlock?
There was something to Sherlock’s words that John didn’t fully understand, a tone or inflection, but he pushed the matter aside to scoff at the man. “In case it escaped your notice, O Great and Powerful Sherlock Holmes, I still have a shift at the clinic today, and I’d really rather not be late.
John gave a small short and shake of his head, but he couldn’t deny the smile on his lips. “All right. Call me, or text me, or whatever, as soon as you get your phone. Do you need my number again?”
Sherlock was his goal; John was just the key to getting to him.
John had been about to just head upstairs to his room when the door to the flat swung open. “Come, John, we have a case!” Sherlock announced in his usual jubilation for cases as he hurriedly began simultaneously pulling on his coat and reaching out for John’s arm to drag him back downstairs.
John’s expression softened, and he took a deep breath. Besides the fact that Sherlock’s throat was still sore, he knew why the man preferred the non-verbal communication. It was easier to be truthful and to let down your guard when it was just in your own head. He settled on the sofa next to Sherlock, examination complete and vitals looking better than they had in weeks, before taking the man’s long hand in between both of his own shorter ones.
Sherlock tightened his hold on John. “It doesn’t bother me you’re sexually attracted to me. That you develop erections because of me. It bothers me that you might regret it, entering into a sexless relationship with me. Might resent the lack of sex.”
John drew in another deep breath. He’d come this far, and Sherlock hadn’t run away yet. He just hoped ‘yet’ wasn’t the keyword here.
Finally. I knew I set you two up for a reason.
“He told me he’s known you about five years now. That you guys really just have a working relationship, but that he cares about you.”
When John first heard the voice in his head, he hadn’t understood what it had meant. It was funny and interesting, and made him feel less alone, and though the root of the words were his own thoughts, they were spoken in ways he never would have done himself. He certainly wouldn’t have called Mrs Clancy an ‘insufferable idiot with a Napoleon complex,’ though he had considered his (short) teacher to be a bit unnecessarily mean and overbearing, but the voice in his head was quite clear on the matter. The voice also seemed to be more interested in bees than rugby whenever John went outside, but he grew accustomed to the stranger’s voice and barely let it distract him from the game.
Drawing in a deep breath, Jim began explaining, though he kept his gaze on the table top between them. “I started dating Robert about two years ago. It started out nice,” he said with a small smile of remembrance. “He’d show up at work with flowers, take me out on nice dates, give me presents for no reason…it was wonderful, actually. But then…” Jim’s countenance grew more shadowed then, and the smile fell from his lips. He took a larger gulp of his beer before starting again.
Swallowing, John nodded. His hand holding the bloody napkin dropped to the table. “You need to be careful with your injuries,” he reminded.
at Jim’s nearly naked body. He jumped, knowing his face had to be enflamed this time, and hastily dragged his gaze from Jim’s chest. The presence of Jim’s bruising helped some, helped temper John’s confused libido, but he was still intrigued about the change in his views.
No, Lestrade had, irritatingly enough, all but manhandled Sherlock into the back of the ambulance and had gotten in with him, no doubt to keep Sherlock from jumping out at the first potential opportunity. Though Sherlock’s symptoms probably could have been treatable at home, he had also strong-armed the hospital staff and made it very clear that Sherlock was to remain checked in until he or Sherlock’s brother signed him out.
A quiet hope had filled John when he thought about the potential of another…date, another date, wanting to better understand his own feelings, but then things took a turn for the worst. As the weekend approached, John began nervously trying to decide how to ask Jim out on another date, a proper one this time with dinner involved, but also trying to pick another place that he didn’t normally frequent. He felt a little ashamed at that, but he didn’t want anyone to recognise him out with another man, and he especially didn’t want Sherlock following him. Again. Besides keeping the wool over Sherlock’s eyes, he also liked the thought of having something that was just his.
* * * * * * * * * *
Mrs Hudson would you shut up! JOHN DELETE THIS POST AT ONCE.
It’s about bloody time.
Day off? Sherlock hoped it was a day off.
John briefly closed his eyes, swallowed hard, and turned around to face the man while also trying to not betray any emotion. “I’ll take it from here, Bec—oh my god, what happened to you?” John blurted, taking in the person before him.
Sherlock cleared his throat, looking after the man until he was out of sight, before drawing in a deep breath. Right. Time to go home. Feeling like a weight was settling over his chest, Sherlock left the hospital room without looking back.
Glancing around the establishment, Jim took in the other patrons, the location, the music playing over the speakers…all so predictable. And
“Dumped again, were you?” Sherlock commented, sounding far too obvious to be conversational, leaving John gritting his teeth. “Didn’t last long, did she? Just what are you doing to them to make them run away so fast?”
Jim seemed hesitant to talk now, however, wincing slightly as he drank his cold beer. John had had second thoughts considering the man’s split lip, but he could tell that liquid courage was far more necessary than minor medical attention at present. Only after a quarter of his drink had disappeared did Jim begin speaking again.
And then Lestrade had to go and ruin it by visiting him again.
The woman wouldn’t know what made a real doctor if it bit her in the clearly surgically augmented posterior. He wondered if her tune would change if he had his medal out, if he had pictures of himself in his fatigues with Bill or some others in his brigade on the wall, and that thought annoyed him just as much. It was for this reason his medal was somewhere unknown, buried in all his things untouched since the discharge ceremony, and any pictures he might have had from that time were since burned to ash.
Not coffee.
Strange but…good. Very good.
“Never leave me, John,” Sherlock whispered. “And I’ll let you fuck me whenever you want.”
Asexual. Lacking sexual attraction to any gender.
With the awkwardness of the past night and earlier that morning distanced from him, John found himself rather enjoying the jeans, in fact, and Jim’s overall appearance. His hair was without product, though John had seen plenty of it when he’d taken a shower, and his shirt looked soft and comfortable, the faint scent of fresh laundry drifting from the blue cotton. Better, though, was the scent of Jim himself. John had the scent himself, in part thanks to his shower the previous night, and he found he rather enjoyed it. He knew he’d be unable to hide it from Sherlock, but he hardly cared at the moment, instead enjoying the way Jim’s eyes lit up when he glanced over at him, at the curve of Jim’s lips when he smiled, making his mouth look…well, quite kissable.
gotten a little farther along than he had originally contrived when first showing up battered and bruised at John’s place of business, artfully done by one of Jim’s most faithful and trusted servants. He could tell Sebastian had enjoyed parts of it, just as Jim had, but he also knew about Sebastian’s own infatuation; it was why he never allowed his most faithful to share his bed with him, though he certainly allowed him to watch sometimes. The frustration and jealousy that Sebastian felt was always so…delicious.
“What about you then?” John asked indicating the man’s soiled shirt. It was sticking to the man’s body again and had to be cold by now.
The flat was quiet.
“Send them in, then,” he sighed, thankful that he at least was almost over.
Well. Almost everything.
Jim lightly chuckled, nodding, though he looked down. At least, until John’s free hand carefully cupped his jaw, lifting his head up until he could stare into his eyes. A moment of silence passed between them, and then John was leaning forward, carefully pressing their lips together. Jim let out a small noise that did not at all sound disapproving, following it up by sliding his own hand around John’s neck and into his hair as their lips slotted and moved against each other.
