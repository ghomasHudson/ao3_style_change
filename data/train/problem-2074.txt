“None of this feels
John chuckled and gave Sherlock a peck on the cheek before he left the house, promising to be back before dark. He patted Gladstone on his head - "you big brute, you're growing like a bloody weed." - on his way to the dust-covered sheet in the shed. He pulled it off and gaped.
Without much conscious effort, Sherlock found himself lying on his side in bed, with John stripping off his clothes and tossing them aside. The Alpha laid behind him and slid a thigh between Sherlock’s legs, using the friction to rub against him. Sherlock let out little gasping noises and ground down on John’s thigh. His movements were shorter and more labored than usual, but John didn’t seem to mind. Before long Sherlock felt the insistent press of John’s cock against his back, then against the curve of his arse, as John gripped what was left of his hips and used the grip as leverage to gain more friction and more contact.
The big cat took to napping on the couch after dinner in the evenings, with his long body draped over John’s lap, belly-up. He was, if possible, more hungry for belly rubs than he had been before, but John didn’t mind. He could spend hours with his hands in that silky fur, rubbing over the fullness of his womb where their kittens grew. Sherlock, for his part, rarely ceased purring when John was rubbing his belly.
Conversation for the evening seemed, despite all their good intentions, to revolve around the impending addition to their family. As predicted, Mike and Greg both joked about Sherlock and John’s apparent eagerness to procreate, given Sherlock’s gravid state on this, their one-year wedding anniversary. “With a man that looks the way he does, can you blame me?” John quipped, grinning as Greg half-choked with laughter on his drink.
When Sherlock’s heat came around, he was acutely aware of it and determined to ignore it. He was more emotionally vulnerable during heats than any other time, and with everything that had happened in the past month he was not willing to lose himself in the least. Not even if this was the strongest heat he’d had in years, damn-you-very-much pregnancy pheromones.
Greg arrived a few minutes later and also told Sherlock not to bother standing up, he was just as capable of saying hello from a sitting position and he had hardly ever bothered to stand up to greet people before he was pregnant, anyhow. Sherlock tossed the crumpled wrapping paper from Molly’s gift at Greg’s head when he turned to walk away, aiming perfectly. Even John had to laugh as he chastised Sherlock for his bad behavior.
The stall was filled with the sound of rain and gears clicking for the next few seconds, and then with a wet, slick noise, the calf fell to the ground. Sherlock eased himself slowly to his knees beside the calf and picked a piece of straw from the bedding, folding it in half and sticking it in the calf's nostril and clearing its airway of fluid and afterbirth. He rubbed his hands quickly along its wet sides, working the amniotic fluid into an accidental lather, trying to get the calf to "breathe, dammit, breathe!" he cried, and pounded his fist against the calf's ribs before rubbing his sides again.
Sherlock awoke to dead silence and a fierce cramp in his lower back. It was 2:12 in the morning according to his mobile. He kept his breathing steady and let the cramp ride out before very carefully getting up out of bed and heading for the loo.
"I can't," he murmurs. "I...it's too soon. I don’t want to hurt you."
He settled onto the couch beside his mate, taking Sherlock's palm and turning it upwards. "I bought you something when I went to town to get groceries. The antique shop just outside of town? The cashier at the grocery said I might find something there."
It was later, much later than they were planning to stay, by the time John bundled a tired and aching Sherlock into his coat and out the door. One glass of mulled wine had turned into several, and everyone but Sherlock was indulging merrily until night began to fall. Finally a rosy-cheeked John had looked out the window and startled, almost immediately wobbling to his feet in his haste to get Sherlock safely home before pitch dark set in.
Fact: Sherlock had at least a small desire to keep it:
"Did you see the look on the poor bugger's face when you snapped the band on?" John crowed, nearly doubling over remembering the wide-eyed look of shock that had passed across Gladstone's face when the band snapped tight around his testicles.
"She's so small," Sherlock whispered, clutching his baby girl close and rocking the whimpering infant back and forth on his chest. "She's so small, so small."
Fact: John had admitted, quite plainly and without coercion, that he loved Sherlock.
Sherlock only managed a nod, but John laughed, the tightness in his chest easing. The nurses knew what they were doing, and it would all be alright now. “It’s our first,” he offered, and the second nurse - Abby, by her name tag - smiled. “A girl. Joanna.”
“We’re working on plans,” he says instead. “I’ll let you know when we work something out.”
“Reuben,” Sherlock said without pause. “Reuben Thomas.” He ran a finger down the baby’s ruddy cheek, then touched the wispy dark hair on his head. He saw John’s nod of approval out of the corner of his eye.
“No, probably not,” he replied, and stepped toward Sherlock to put his hands on his hips. His nose was just at the level of Sherlock’s neck, and he nuzzled carefully into the open vee of his shirt collar to press a kiss to his skin. “Growing in there. Hadn’t really noticed anything. But you really are pregnant, love. You’re going to have a baby.”
Sherlock let out a high whimper and did as he was told, releasing his abdominal muscles. His skin seemed to expand under John’s palm, revealing a full belly that Sherlock had been holding in since they’d left the restaurant earlier that night. He looked down and let out a pained noise.
She had a thick head of dark hair. Cara had too, but with her father’s coloring. Tess took after her mother, full lips with a pronounced bow and a button nose. She was purple at first, but as the minutes went by and John cut the cord she brightened to a pale pink. Soon she had all but fallen asleep, her lips moving and hands clenching and unclenching - a movement Sherlock had felt for weeks, but now she was testing it out on her own.
have a baby. In that order. End of discussion.
Sherlock’s eyes wrinkled at the corners as he smiled. He smoothed his shirt over his bump, the wrinkles giving way to show off the round curve of it. “Tessy is in here, isn’t she,” he said, nodding back when Cara giggled and nodded again. “Do you want to say good morning?”
Moments later - “Ooh - oh, ooh, stop,” Sherlock gasped, and John stopped. Sherlock’s thighs were spread wide and he rocked his hips a little as sharp spines of discomfort stabbed at his guts, which were filled unfamiliarly. John rubbed soothingly and some of the pressure dissipated, his body adjusting. He took a few shallow breaths and looked down at his belly.
“Stop talking,” Sherlock says shortly.
“Little,” Cara said emphatically. Sherlock laughed.
John groaned and shook his head. “Sherlock, no,” he said. “Look at you. You’re fucking full to bursting, you think you can fit half of this cake in there? There’s no way. Look at us.” He clapped a hand to his stuffed middle.
He remembers what this had been like, the day it happened. How he’d stood at the side of the grave—the tiny, tiny grave—and had done his best to ignore what was going on as his soul rent itself apart over his loss. This time, he sinks to his knees at her graveside and apologizes. John kneels next to him and holds him close, and dries Sherlock’s tears when they subside.
He ached, and felt on the edge of coming, all at once. His stomach arced away from his body, so tight and full that he now couldn’t see John’s head at all. He clutched desperately at his stomach as John filled him more, and sucked him until Sherlock’s toes curled. “Ough,” he coughed, the pressure in his stomach so great that he felt like he might burst. “Ohhh. Ugh, oh, uh.” Another burst of pressure, this one longer than the last, so that Sherlock felt his stomach expand under his fingers. He couldn’t take any more, could he? He was so full, his body couldn’t fit any more, surely.
"Ssh, ssh, it's okay, Sherlock. I've got you, I'm right here." John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and the Omega nearly fell in his embrace. "Hey, I've got you. If this is what you need, I can give this to you." John held him close, and though the Omega was taller than John he was smaller in this moment. John could hold him, could keep him close for a few minutes.
“Look at you,” the Alpha murmured, stepping forward. His gaze traveled up and down Sherlock’s body, lingering on the fullness of his belly and chest. “Hardly seen any of you the past few weeks. You’ve been hiding.” He closed the distance between himself and Sherlock, palms running flat over his belly and settling on his hips.
Instead, he makes dinner.
John looks.
A few fragments of sentences drift in from the one-sided conversation Mycroft is holding in the next room.
It would be dangerous. But isn’t it always?
The Sussex house has bedrooms for all of their grandchildren, and so it never feels empty, even when they’re not around to visit. Sometimes Sherlock has an itch that he needs John to scratch, and sometimes he doesn’t mind being gentled open instead of taken in a rush. Their hair turns grey - John’s first, and then Sherlock’s, in streaks - and their joints and old wounds ache when the weather turns, and they both complain about it. They still refuse to submit to rocking chairs.
Sherlock shrugged. “I could do it this way, if you really wanted me to,” he said, but was clear from his tone that he didn’t like the idea.
"Did you say something, Sherlock?" John asked loudly, trying to be heard over the storm.
Sherlock only hesitated for a moment. “What plans are those?” he asked, trailing a finger down the top of his stomach.
Sherlock felt his first contraction a quarter-hour later. He was still in the bath when it came, gripping his belly weakly and then growing stronger and stronger until he winced and shifted in its grasp. It held on for twenty seconds and then released, and he felt another powerful wave of nausea roll through him - though thankfully, not a productive one. “John,” he called out, eyes closed, arm dangling from the edge of the tub. “I just had a contraction.”
Sherlock laid awake in bed that night, long after John's breathing had evened out and his mate had entered REM sleep. Staring out the bedroom window at the moors, lit only by a half moon and eerily foggy, Sherlock contemplated. Did John really mean it? Would he really want the baby wriggling in his belly, would he really treat it as he would his own flesh and blood?
The baby’s body moved inside him, past the ring of his cervix and down the canal. The pleasure built again as he was stretched wide, but this time it was unrelenting - because the progress was so slow, the pleasure started to grate at him until it was almost unbearable. He was shaking with tension and strain, and the head seemed lodged inside him, not moving forward, but not moving back, either.
Sherlock let out a long breath and went limp, rubbing his side idly as one of the babies kicked a little. “Didn’t know how much I needed that,” he said, and heard John’s high laugh behind him. “You may have introduced me to the only thing that can keep me sane until I’m no longer as big as a whale, you know. I’ll wring you dry by the time I go into labor.”
John moved warily to stand in front of the hen, and slid his hand under her, trying to be as unobtrusive as Sherlock had been. He thought he'd succeeded until a sharp bite to his arm made him yelp and withdraw quickly, holding his thumb over the spot of blood that had risen to the surface. "What did I do wrong?"
The calf recovered quicker than John thought he would. He bounded to the front of the pen the next morning, the only sign of his trauma in the singed hairs and browned scabs on his head. Within a week, the scabs had fallen off, and by the time Gladstone reached three months of age, the scars had healed over and no sign that the bull had ever had horns could be found.
Mrs. Hudson clucks sympathetically, wipes her eyes, and pushes past John. “My, but the flat is a bit of a mess, John. I know how it can be, preparing for—well.” She stops and swallows, and John sees briefly how frail she looks, like one wrong word could send her crumbling to the floor. He’s glad he lied. He wishes he didn’t have to. “If you need help tidying, packing things away—I would be happy to help. And meals, too. Goodness knows how busy you must be with the memorial service.” She turns to look at him, question in her eyes.
"Okay," John replied slowly, patting the nearest cow - Agnes? - on the rump. She didn't twitch, instead stood placidly without even looking around. "So…do we do that now?"
the swelling in my ankles.”
John saw the fire in Sherlock’s eyes and nodded eagerly. He got Sherlock to grip onto the headboard with both hands and entered him from behind. It didn’t take long for John to get the right rhythm and angle, and then all it took was another contraction of Sherlock’s body to have John coming with a grunt and a shudder. When he finished, he pulled out of Sherlock’s body and wiped them both clean, and then sat cross-legged on the bed. “So. New rules?” he asked.
"I know you are, love. Let's get you inside, okay?" Sherlock nodded and let John pull him to his feet, and it was all he could do to keep from crying out. His muscles were stiff from pulling Marjorie's calf, and now, from labour, and his back protested loudly as John balanced him.
Sherlock exhaled shakily, staring at
“Oh! Thanks, daddy,” Soren said, grabbing the piece and putting it in place. He looked up at Sherlock and beamed. The Omega smiled back and leant down a little to ruffle Soren’s curls, then let out a little sigh and made his way to the couch.
“Yeah, we are. Come on, let’s get you inside.” He got out of the cab and circled around to open Sherlock’s door, helping his laboring husband out. Sherlock winced once he got his footing and started heading for the door while John paid the cab driver and got their hospital bag. John’s blood ran cold when he heard a whimper followed by a shout of his name, and whipped around to see a trembling Sherlock staring wide-eyed at his belly as a growing stain spread across the rear of his pajama trousers. “Oh, fuck,” he cursed, shutting the cab door and sprinting toward Sherlock.
John grinned back.
Sherlock gathered the loose edges of his strength and put everything he had into the next push, straining so hard that his vision went slightly black and he shook with the effort. He felt her shift inside him, turning so her shoulders could pass, felt that agonizing burn again and shouted with a raw, hoarse throat, and kept pushing, pushing until she moved again and moved down and moved out and was born.
Sherlock handed her over, slightly reluctant. Cara snuggled against his side and watched as John set the baby on the scale next to the changing table. “Good god,” he said after a moment, then picked Tess back up and gave her back to her mother. “How does ten pounds, eight ounces sound?” Mrs. Hudson made a noise of shock.
On Violet’s anniversary, Sherlock hauls his swollen body out of bed and wakes John up. They dress—John in a jumper, Sherlock in comfortable jeans and a paternity top he’d worn with Violet—and go to the cemetery. The grass has been mowed recently, and it sticks to Sherlock’s shoes as they walk to where she rests.
A series of dots connected in Sherlock’s mind and he drew a shuddering breath. “I was in labor in the carriage,” he said, breathless. “My waters leaked then. The back spasms were contractions, they must have been.” John nodded in agreement, reaching the same conclusion.
By noon, Sherlock was well into his labor. His contractions were eight minutes apart at most, and he was quiet most of the time, save for noises of pain during contractions. “Tell me you have something stronger than paracetamol for pain,” he said roughly, leaning against the back of the sofa and catching his breath.
“Not Summer.”
Fact: Love was the best way to create a successful bond.
Sherlock only grimaced and rocked under the stream of water in reply, his hips aching and spine threatening to split as wave after wave of tension swept through his body. When the chill finally left his bones and John shut off the water to towel them both dry, Sherlock stopped and gripped John's arms, looking him in the eye.
Sherlock holds him tightly, and John knows it means “me too.”
In the dim light, he could see his reflection in the mirror. He was nude from the waist up, as had become his norm the bigger he grew. His belly, round and overfull, sat heavy on his thighs, low and long. A dark line ran from his navel downward until it disappeared under the curve, and it echoed from his navel upward until it faded back into pale, unmarked skin. On the top of the great swell rested his breasts, the nipples dark and fat. Each breast sagged, tear-drop shaped, to either side of his belly. He looked nothing like he had nine months ago, nothing like he’d ever imagined he would look. He looked like a mother soon to be. And somewhere, deep in his bones, he knew soon was coming quickly.
“Tess?” Cara asked, her little voice piping up. “This is Tess?” She looked at the baby in awe.
“Oh my god,” came John’s voice, thick with tears. His hand was on her head, cradling it next to Sherlock’s, touching their baby daughter. “Oh my god, Sherlock,
"Fair enough. Did you ever want to be a parent?"
John did. He fed him another piece of lasagna, bite by bite. Sherlock chewed and swallowed slowly, trying to buy time for his stomach to expand and relax in between each bite. He kept one hand on his side, rubbing up and down lightly, impressed by how big he had gotten.
John laughed as he came into the bedroom, a can of soda with a straw in one hand and a large can of whipped cream in the other. “You’ve got a lot of liquid in that tummy,” he said, bending down to kiss it. He tossed Sherlock’s shirt back at him. “Put that back on.”
Sherlock caught him looking. “What?” he asked, fidgeting with the waistband to find a more comfortable position. He looked at John, then, brow furrowed. “Do I look pregnant?”
Sherlock is lost. Days and days of denied emotion are possessing him, racking him with sobs. Every muscle in his body is wound tight with the force of his grief. How could John have ever thought this man felt nothing? The proof of his heart is plain in every spasm of anguish. How much had it taken for him to lock all this away? And how painful must it be now that it’s finally spilling out?
The baby was four days past due. Her carrier and bassinet were in the corner of their bedroom awaiting their occupant’s arrival, and upstairs her nursery was stocked with baby clothes and nappies and hats and socks and everything else a baby could possibly need to be happy - all just waiting on the baby herself. But she was clearly happy where she was, still inside her mother, content to make him larger and larger until his own clothes no longer fit and he couldn’t tie his own shoes.
He sighed as he put all the papers away and back into their folder. “Well,” he said, looking down at his rounded stomach, “You’ll be coming with us one way or another, I suppose.”
“Why don’t we see if we can get Alice to try again?” Sherlock suggested, bending down to pick up the green-collared kitten. The young cat purred and rubbed her head against Sherlock’s jaw.
“I hope so,” Sherlock sighed, running his fingers through his hair. “I feel like she’s going to fall out at any moment. I didn’t think I could get more uncomfortable, but here we are.”
The man following him was a wounded army veteran who, instead of retiring on disability after his injury, had uprooted himself and travelled across Scotland and for god-knows-what reason had found Sherlock's advertisement and decided that it was a fitting job. Sherlock picked up his pace and John followed unfailingy, his breathing never quickening and his pace never faltering even over rough, uncertain terrain.
--------
John tutted and shook his head. “Just for that, you get a glass of milk to go with it,” he said, rising again and returning a moment later with a tall glass of milk, which he set beside the plate of cake. “Silly man. You’re not finished until I tell you so.” He reached out and laid a finger in the middle of Sherlock’s belly, pushing down until Sherlock winced and bent double, trying to escape the pressure on his stuffed stomach. John kept going until Sherlock let out a whimper, then pulled his hand back and laid both palms flat on Sherlock’s stomach, rubbing lightly. “It feels full, love, but I just know you can fit more. Have some of the milk,” he said, nodding toward the glass.
“I’m going to stick a few of these in the oven to re-heat,” John said, unloading a few pans from the coolers. “Are you sure you want to heat all of it up? I mean --“
The next autumn, as the weather turns cold, Sherlock senses the changes in his body that mean his cycle is returning.
When Sherlock awoke, he knew something was different. The achiness in his hips was the same, the pain in his back was the same, the general level of discomfort was the same as it had been for the past few days - but something had changed. He groaned quietly and pushed himself up to sit on the edge of the bed, trying not to wake John.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked down. The veins that had been visible before were even more visible now, his skin stark white and so smooth it looked translucent. It was shiny along the tightest, fullest part - the curve just beneath his pectoral muscles leading down to his navel. The whole thing felt hot to the touch and so packed full that it had no give at all when John pressed down. Sherlock gave a halfhearted wince and moan but didn’t have the energy to try and move away from the pain.
John swore and blinked hard, trying to stop the tears of awe as he caught a glimpse of his daughter’s face, squashed and purple and covered in the slick of Sherlock’s body. “Hey,” he said tearfully, smearing a kiss onto Sherlock’s cheek, “Hey, oh my god, she’s right there. I can see her, love. You’re almost done, darling, she’s so close.”
“Yeah,” John said, and picked up her damp body. He slid her between Sherlock’s thighs - cord too short to hold her otherwise - and Sherlock reached for her around the swell of his belly and then there she was against him.
Sherlock padded over and rubbed against John’s leg, closing his eyes and purring. He wrapped around John’s thigh, weaved between his legs, and leaned heavily against the doctor, butting against his hand with his forehead until John reflexively scratched behind his ears. The purring doubled in volume and that long black tail wrapped sinuously around John’s leg.
“You’ll be...happier than you thought you ever could be,” he said, with conviction. “Sleep as much as you can, especially toward the end. Have a glass of wine on your anniversary. It won’t hurt the baby.” He heard John’s ‘tsk’ and Cameron’s laugh. “And no matter how prepared you think you are, you won’t be. But that’s what grandparents are for.”
The midwife picked her up and handed her between Sherlock’s legs to John, who touched her for just a fleeting second before putting her in Sherlock’s waiting arms, cradled against his swollen stomach which had been her home for so many long months. She squalled like she was trying to wake the dead, loud enough that her cries made Sherlock’s ears ring.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft murmurs.
Sherlock let out a low rumble, a thanks, and set to work severing the umbilical cord for their third kitten. Soon enough, the newest kitten was stumbling around the box just like its older sisters as Sherlock ate the placenta.
“It’s done,” Sherlock said. John couldn’t remember ever seeing that look on his husband’s face before in his entire life, and it made him practically giddy with joy. “We did it.”
Sherlock turns his head to the side and kisses the inside of John's wrist, and it makes John's stomach curl. "Come on," he purrs, because he's always all coy and tempting when he's afraid he won't get what he wants. "I'm good. You know I'm
“You sleep. Now,” John said, leaning over and kissing Sherlock’s forehead. “She’ll be here when you wake up, I promise. I won’t abscond with her whilst you’re asleep. God only knows I wouldn’t be able to handle a newborn baby by myself, let alone a newborn Holmes.”
John chuckled. "I see. You and your research…" he was silent for a few moments. "You'll be a great dad, Sherlock."
Sherlock picked his up and took a small sip. He winced. Every bite made the pain in his stomach more severe as he filled his stuffed stomach even more. He prodded it gently with two fingers as he took another sip. “It’s rock hard,” he said in awe.
He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and leaned against the wall as he relieved himself. “Tess,” he mumbled, “it’s time to come out.” Tomorrow would be 41 weeks, and he would be induced in two days if she didn’t get here before then. He was surprised his doctor had let him go this long - of course, he’d been fairly stubborn in wanting a natural birth, but still - the baby was huge, and so was he.
Sherlock did what he was told, as best he could. The pain grew worse, until he was certain he was tearing at the edges. But then John’s hand was gone, moving away from his sore flesh, but there was still resistance there -
There’s a bump. He strokes a hand over the newly tight skin and smiles at John. “Our kittens,” he says, and a thrill runs up John’s spine.
“You left,” he repeats. “Left me to talk to everyone. On my own.”
Sherlock is standing in the middle of the room, looming over a small fire over the carpet. There are scorch marks on the floor, on the white-painted dresser, on the walls.
How dare you.”
At last, at last, the top shoulder protruded, and John could slide a finger beneath the baby's arm and pull along with his labouring mate. "Almost, Sherlock, give me one more big push, good, oh god, there it…here it comes, Sherlock!" John got his other hand down just in time to catch the baby's body as it slid free, wet and bloody and really quite small for as much work as it was to deliver it.
I could suck your tits, I could eat you out, I could finger you until you cried -“
“My darling, I wore this shirt on the very last day of my pregnancy with Cara,” he said one morning, pulling on what had, with his first baby, been a pleasantly loose top that draped over his belly. With Tess at just 36 weeks, the top was pulled taut around the widest part of his stomach and left the underside exposed. He tugged fruitlessly at the hem, shook his head, and made his way into the kitchen, swaying slightly from side to side as he had become wont to do. “Do you remember this shirt, John?” he asked, putting his hands on his sides and sliding them forward and back over the dark purple cloth.
John was cooking dinner. “Not Amanda,” he said, crossing out the name in the book.
John returned the favor by taking Sherlock’s elegant hand and kissing the prominent knuckles there. “I’m off tomorrow, so it’ll be a day of rest in bed for you. Mightn’t be a bad idea to take those here and there when you can; Miss Tess is taking it out of you a bit, I think.”
The water was running cold now, and the contractions were strong and regular and close together. Sherlock was rosy-cheeked and looking well-fucked, rubbing his belly intently as he turned the shower off. His legs were trembling a little and he gave John a shaky laugh as he stepped carefully out of the shower. “It’s very good,” he said, rubbing the lower part of his belly and barely suppressing a shiver.
She was heavy on his belly. A little purple, and very wet, but save for a few streaks of blood on her head and shoulders and tummy, she was clean. She had a few wisps of dark hair stuck to the very top of her head. Sherlock took her little hand, waving angrily in the air, and she clutched his finger tight. “Ten fingers,” he said wetly, “And ten toes.”
The sheets lift, and cool air rushes in. John waits for Sherlock’s weight to sink into the mattress next to him and for the covers to settle over them again.
“The best outcome for who?” Sherlock asked, staring downward at a vast expanse of pale skin jutting outward from his shirt. “For them, I know, I know. It’s just.” He sighed again. “The human body may have evolved to manage twins, but my body did not.”
"Some go to Victor, others mixed in the cow feed, some are used for cooking and I just toss out the rest. I've too many hens at the moment."
Sherlock nodded and a wet sniffle escaped his nose. His arm rose to swipe at the offending mucus and John chuckled, earning a wan smile from Sherlock in return.
John swallows a mouthful of toast. It sticks unpleasantly in his throat. “Funeral arrangements.”
Across the table, John was in the same state. His stomach had become a tan ball, pushing his pajama pants low. The whole thing was round and packed full, and John was breathing as shallowly as Sherlock, leaned back in his chair. They both sat there, staring wordlessly, their breaths labored as they cradled their bursting stomachs in both hands.
“That’s more than enough of that,” Sherlock said, eyes pooled black and shifting uneasily from foot to foot. John was sure that if he bent over, he’d see Sherlock’s cock rubbing hard against the bottom of his belly, so he took mercy.
John swallows around the tightness in his throat. "I know. I know, Sherlock. I know."
Sherlock spread his thighs wide as he could in response, panting as his belly heaved with a contraction. He moaned low in his throat and took John's hand in his own, gripping it tight as he fought not to push. Slowly, inch by inch, John could see the head emerging, and he moved his hand down to stretch the skin as the head pushed free. "That's it, Sherlock, almost out," he murmured, squeezing Sherlock's hand tight.
Indeed, Sherlock’s corset was ill-fitting. “Late pregnancy often brings abrupt changes to the Omega’s form,” John said, unlacing Sherlock’s stays and trying to discern how best to adjust it. A red line had dug into the lower part of Sherlock’s abdomen, where the corset had clung to his full middle in the wrong place. “I believe I may have to lace from the bottom and have you hold it up, to give you the proper support.”
After a light lunch - all he could manage, really - John joined him in bed, rubbing his swollen stomach and talking quietly to the baby. "Come on out, love. Daddy's tired, and you've got to be all cramped up in there. Why don't you come out and say hi? I promise, it's not as bad out here as you might think."
“No, this looks good on you, too,” John replied, turning to give a kiss to his mate. He slid one hand along Sherlock’s broad side, coming to rest on the full curve of his hip. “Every bit of it looks just beautiful.”
John left his gift for Sherlock inside the
“You do,” Sherlock replied, shifting uncomfortably on the chair. He’d never overindulged to this point before. He was beyond repletion, and was slightly nauseous, he was so full.
“What’s his name, love?” John murmured, helping settle the baby back in Sherlock’s arms. “I know you’ve been sitting on it for weeks now.”
"What about it?" Sherlock replied warily.
Sherlock gathers every last scrap of pain in his being, every ounce of grief and fear, every bit of him that went into making both of his daughters, and bears down.
He got all three. “There’s several restaurants on this side of town, according to Google Maps,” John said, helping him put on and tie his shoes. Sherlock was still a bit muzzy from his nap, but he took John’s mobile and scrolled through the options. He snorted and handed it back.
hurts,” he panted at the end of a hard contraction, his thighs shaking so hard in the squat that he was worried he might fall over.
Three weeks later, the two men had established a rhythm. John awoke with the sunrise each morning, milked Agnes and Marjorie, and met Sherlock in the milkhouse. Sherlock had wordlessly handed John his harnessed stool a week after John had arrived, after trying and failing to buckle the straps around his middle. John had done chores on his own that day, and hadn't seen Sherlock until noon.
John looked at Sherlock narrowly as he sank down with a groan. “You know it’s time,” he said a little accusingly.
The push had the baby’s body rotating inside him, the shoulders twisting to line up better with the opening of his pelvis. The twisting brought a pleasure unlike any Sherlock had ever felt before, and as the baby shifted once more and the shoulders emerged fully, the omega let out a howl and went rigid in John’s arms, rocked by his orgasm. The force of the contractions pushed the baby out the rest of the way. Sherlock’s ears were ringing and his sight was cloudy but he reached beneath his low, fleshy belly and picked up their firstborn child, holding it to his chest.
“You’re kidding.” John set his coffee down, and cursed himself - there were no ripples in the black liquid to bely a tremor. “Sherlock, are we really? Are you —“
“I don’t think I can wait any longer,” Sherlock said sadly when they pulled back. John’s gaze traveled from the serval’s head to his feet, lingering on the swell of his belly, the painful curve of his spine, and the bags under his eyes.
John sat beside him and held his hand while they navigated to the hospital. Sherlock endured three more contractions en route, bravely staying as quiet as he could while in the cab. He breathed slowly and deeply through each long pain, gripping John’s hand so tight the bones shifted. John could tell Sherlock’s composure was fading as they pulled up to the hospital doors. Sherlock looked across at John, vaguely panicked. “We’re having a baby,” he said, and John offered him a wild grin.
He should have an answer.
John caught the blanket gratefully, wiping off his face and wrapping the warm cloth around his shoulders and following Sherlock into the sitting room. He perched awkwardly on the edge of a well-worn sofa and looked around.
Above him, tears dripped from the corners of Sherlock's eyes. He was going to be a father, too. And though the thought was overwhelming, now, he thought, it just might work out.
“John,” Sherlock repeated, trembling and pushing again. He clutched John’s upper arms and bore down with all his strength. He dropped inelegantly to his knees and spread his legs further, quelling the shaking in his limbs and channeling all his strength into pushing.
"Sure he does. No risk of an unwanted pregnancy," Sherlock said flatly, and John stopped dead in his tracks.
There was what appeared to be a full-body snort and Sherlock’s belly jumped a little with laughter. John grinned. “An amenable proposal,” Sherlock said, and John could hear the smile.
“I agree,” Sherlock said with a nod. The baby wiggled a little and settled in Sherlock’s arms with a little huff of a sigh, which made everyone in the room laugh. “Poor thing. It’s a rough business, being born,” he said, remembering how Joanna had done the same thing after she’d been laid in his arms.
“Oh, how I wish you’d have kept that thought to yourself,” Sherlock sighed, sliding his hands over his belly. “Turn the telly on. I’m bored, and if this is it we’ve got some waiting to do.”
Sherlock waited until John got home two days later. He greeted his mate at the door with a sad smile, and John knew it was time. “Hello, love,” he said, dropping his bag and wrapping Sherlock in a long hug. His mate’s belly, heavy and round with their offspring, was pressed firmly between them.
The pressure changed. Dropped. Sherlock let out a harsh noise and bore down, barely aware of the scuffle of movement around him. Someone else’s unfamiliar hands were on his thighs, spreading them wider. Sherlock allowed himself to be moved, too focused on the gradual exit of the baby to protest.
"The circumstances, obviously," Sherlock hissed, frowning.
Sherlock shivered and John felt his body relax, some of the stiffness going out of his spine as his muscles loosened. He rolled his hips again - in, out - and shifted his lower leg to get a little better angle, and to have something to push off of and get a little more force. “Alright?” John asked, checking in to make sure Sherlock was okay.
“I want it to be over,” Sherlock whimpered, clutching John’s now-wet shirt.
"Nothing. I lied. That was a test. She's the worst; if you had managed to get her eggs from under her without her biting you I would've let you do the rest yourself. Settle down, hen, I swear I've no idea why I keep you around." Sherlock slid his arm under, looking in the hen's eyes warningly, and withdrew two smooth white eggs.
John’s hand, which had paused in its scratching, resumed briefly as he resigned himself to buying out the beef section in the grocery that night.
Sherlock didn't laugh. "Why did you respond to my ad?"
. Even entertaining the possibility mildly disgusts him, but increasingly it is forcing itself into consideration. He knows the statistics, that his history makes him “high-risk,” that there is every possibility of suffering the same pain and loss. That knowledge is what makes his chest clench and his stomach turn.
“I know,” Sherlock replied. “We will be.”
"Fine," he conceded, and finished dressing, pulling on a work shirt and coat and waddling slowly to the front door, John close behind. John helped him into his wellies, and they opened the front door, instantly hit with a blast of cold rain as they stepped outside.
An hour later, over dinner, John was watching Sherlock gently pat his belly when he brought up the subject they'd been carefully avoiding. "Your baby."
"You're pregnant." The man looked up, slightly shocked, and John's face split with a victorious grin.
John is there to catch him and to hold Sherlock’s shaking body as he breaks. They sink to the floor, Sherlock only barely clinging to John. The energy of a moment ago is entirely exhausted. At the floor, the smell of acrid burnt cloth is stronger, but it’s not what brings tears to John’s eyes.
John made a sympathetic noise when they reached the light of the house and he could see the damp fabric clinging to Sherlock’s thighs. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly, putting a hand on Sherlock’s lower back. Sherlock’s cheeks flushed red-hot again and he said nothing, moving slowly and achily across the threshold and into their house.
The rigid facade of aristocratic professionalism that Mycroft wears at all times is still in place, but there's a softness showing through that leads John to believe that for once, Mycroft Holmes is entirely sincere.
The doctor smiled honestly. “I like hearing that,” she said. “Too many mums these days want scheduled babies. They just want their pregnancies to be over. That’s not to say inductions are bad, but in my opinion, babies come when they’re ready and not a minute before, and that’s the way it ought to be unless something’s wrong.”
John laughed and simply watched Sherlock for the next few minutes as he kneaded dough. "Happy Christmas, by the way."
He heard a smattering of excited but quiet voices through the closed door after John left, and looked down at Tess. She was half asleep, moving her arms and legs slowly and making quiet smacking noises. “Hello, my baby,” he murmured, lifting her up to smell her and kiss her tiny cheeks and forehead. “Hello, my Tess. You came to meet us at last.” She responded by making a little noise, and Sherlock’s heart ached.
“That is a beautiful belly you’ve made there, love,” John praised, putting his hand where Sherlock’s was. His fingers prodded gently at Sherlock’s stomach, finding very little resistance. “So much pressure, hmm? What do you think, do you like that?”
“Beautiful,” John murmured, both hands rubbing the little paunch now. “Look at that. Look at you, with your little tummy. Shows I fed you well tonight, doesn’t it?”
“They’re perfect,” Sherlock said, swiping at his own tears. He shook his head. “No, I love them. They’re perfect.”
The water had been tap-cold, but the soda had been refrigerated, so it was even colder as it slid down Sherlock’s throat. He felt the fizz of the carbonation on his tongue and as it met his stomach’s contents, bubbling a little. “Ooh,” he said, stroking the top of his stomach. “That’s delightful.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, stifled a burp, and then nodded, ashamed. “My trousers are - a bit tight,” he said thickly, glancing down at his middle. He was actually so full that his stomach was creating a small pooch over the top of his waistband, the fabric so tight that it had no give left at all. “Maybe if…you undid them, I would have a little more room?”
“You are a silly little thing,” Sherlock said to the baby. He was pressing one finger into the roundness of his belly and drawing it down his side, and she was chasing the movement with her foot. Once he reached a certain point she would stop and take over with a fist, pressing out against where he pressed in. He knew it was just instinct, an automatic response, but knowing that she was growing and learning and reacting to her surroundings was an endlessly fascinating thought.
“Be right back,” John promised, dropping a kiss to his engorged stomach.
Soren looked at his papa, then his daddy, and then his little brother, then carefully leaned over to press a feather-light kiss on the baby’s forehead. Reuben wrinkled his nose and let out a milky huff, and Soren erupted into a peal of laughter. “Hi, Reuben,” he said, giggling and settling down next to Sherlock. The Omega looped his arm around Soren’s shoulders, holding him close.
“Oh,” Sherlock’s spoon stopped halfway to his mouth and hovered in midair, shaking very slightly. A drop of soup dripped from the bottom of it and landed on the table, but Sherlock didn’t notice. He concentrated very carefully on the unfamiliar feeling of a cramp rolling through his belly, far stronger than the practice contractions he’d had.
He’s got to get up.
"Twelve hours, give or take," says John. "I asked them to—if you want to, you can...see her. She’s just downstairs."
Sherlock pulled himself to his feet and arranged his shirt in a way that minimised the four-month pregnant bump that was growing on his front. The result of an ill-fated coupling the
John couldn't help but laugh nervously at Sherlock's analysis. In a short period of time, it would be John checking Sherlock's body for dilation and labour, trying to feel their baby as it came out.
He didn’t have to wait long. Sherlock was pushing with a contraction in the space of a minute, letting out a low animalistic grunt as he bore down. John pressed down as instructed, and it seemed to help Sherlock somehow, as his spine curved upward into the pressure.
He kisses the top of Sherlock’s head. “Do you want to go to bed?”
John was afraid Sherlock wouldn’t want to come. He didn’t go the day John went to talk to the people at the funeral home, and he never, ever went back to the hospital to see the little body that he had grown. John woke, though, to the sound of the shower running. Sherlock came out of the bathroom dressed, for the first time since they’d gotten home, in one of his pre-pregnancy suits. Just one week and you’d almost never know. John looks at Sherlock’s chest and hurts thinking how terribly constricted he must be.
With a stiff smile, John nods.
John looked at Sherlock, hair ruffled and fluffy, and looking enormously pregnant, and broke out laughing, shaking his head. “Sorry! Sorry. It’s just really hard to take any threat seriously when you look like a fuzzy kiwi bird.”
The serval strained, and John pulled. The little body emerged bit by bit, but John was afraid to pull too hard in case he hurt the kitten. Finally, with a gargantuan heave from the big cat, the third kitten came free, waving its front feet. John helped clear the membrane from its face so the little thing could breathe, and let out a relieved laugh when the little kitten gave a quiet mew.
John shook his head. "No, no, just tell
“A bit might, but perhaps not the quantity of belly I’m currently hauling around,” Sherlock grumbled, but even he had to smile as he accepted John’s compliment.
"No mate. It was a mistake. I'm not keeping it." Sherlock's voice was hard.
John snorts. "You're pushing out a baby. I can take a sore arm. You're unbelievable."
“Of all the times not to be dramatic -
John straddled Sherlock’s upper body. He could feel the heat of Sherlock’s full belly against his back and the thought of that made his already-hard cock even harder. He slid his cock into the tight valley between Sherlock’s breasts and groaned when Sherlock pushed the twin mounds even closer together. “God,” he breathed, looking down at Sherlock all flushed and pink beneath him.
“I can change back and forth now, if I need to. They’re eating enough solid foods, they don’t need my milk all the time. And I can teach Faith and Calvin how to change, too. If Alice has figured it out, they won’t be far behind.” Sherlock ran his hands up and down John’s upper arms, seemingly unable to keep his hands off John too.
John faltered in his rhythm for a moment. "Oh."
"Oh, bugger." Sherlock grumbled and pushed himself up onto elbows, his back smarting as he did so. "How's she acting?"
“Lovely name,” said the nurse pushing the wheelchair. “I’m Maggie. Abby and I will be helping your little Joanna come to meet you, but first let’s get you settled into your room.” John nodded and followed along at the fast clip that Maggie set, shouldering Sherlock’s hospital bag as they got inside.
“Hurt? Ow?” Cara asked. Clearly, he’d been too loud; Cara had heard from the living room.
Sherlock did as he was told, with John stuffing pillows behind his back and shoulders to elevate him. They rucked his stained gown up over his knees and John retreated once more to wash his hands, returning as another contraction petered out. He slid onto the bed between Sherlock’s spread legs, pushing his hand into Sherlock’s body and murmuring a small comfort as he did so. He withdrew after a moment, wiping his hand on a towel. “You’re ready,” he said, his voice shaky. “The baby is coming. When you feel the need, bear down. Don’t hold your breath, but push as hard as you can. I’ll tell you when you need to stop.”
"Reassuring."
“Whazzit?” he says, still bleary.
“We’ve only got the stuffing and cranberry sauce left,” Sherlock said. “And there’s not much of either. I think we can do it. Think of how accomplished we’ll be.”
Almost immediately, his milk let down, and he felt a surge of hormones course through his veins. The pleasure from the second baby’s position ratcheted up and so did the strength of his contractions, all culminating in a hard push that had Sherlock’s toes curling again as the baby’s head came to crown. The first baby’s sucks were hard, drawing colostrum from Sherlock’s breast, and she nursed hungrily, her little grunts drowned out by the noises Sherlock made as he worked to deliver.
"That doesn't matter." The man waved a hand distractedly. "Your shoulder - it is healing well, I presume? I doubt a cross-country trip of Scotland was what your GP suggested."
Sherlock shuts his eyes. His Adam’s apple bobs as he visibly swallows, and his face is tight and controlled. For a moment, John thinks that this is going to be it. His stomach lurches at the impending upheaval.
It took three more hard pushes to bring Joanna’s head to crown. Standing at Sherlock’s side, John could see her little scalp starting to emerge, and he had to swipe at tears with his shoulder. The peekaboo sliver slid back in when Sherlock’s push ended. “I saw her,” John said tearfully, pressing a quick kiss to Sherlock’s head. “I saw her head, oh my god, she’s so close.”
“Joanna is coming to visit,” John said on a Tuesday morning, looking at his mobile. “She said she and Cameron have a weekend off and wanted to visit.”
Sherlock was standing, back hunched, with a small glistening bag at the lips of his vulva. He shook minutely, his rear legs spread. “Sherlock?” John asked, and Sherlock’s ears and tail twitched.
"Er…Victor? Elderly neighbor?"
John grimaced and ran a hand through his hair. "Like she's in labour? I don't know. Pacing, mooing, her vulva's all swollen and loose…"
“You’re doing so well,” he said, stroking Sherlock’s knuckles with his thumb as he struggled through another contraction. “You’re so strong. You’re almost done, she’s almost here.”
"Even though I don't want the baby, I don't want it to be dead."
John counts to three. He is about to shake him again—really shake him—when Sherlock flies to life, throwing John's arms away and flinging himself at him.
John seemed to catch on just after his cock did. The hardness was pressing up against the crotch of his sleep trousers when his eyes went wide and he locked gazes with Sherlock. “It’s time?” he asked, the dots connecting. Sherlock nodded and kept moving, pushing down against the hard line of John’s cock. “You’re one of
"I know, I know," John murmurs. "Do it for me. Just a little more. You've gotta push past it. For us."
"You're producing milk?" John asked inquisitively as Sherlock pulled his shirt off, baring his belly and chest.
“Suppose that’s true,” John said, and retracted his offered pasta to eat himself. Sherlock noticed that John suddenly looked a little concerned, and he huffed.
“Oh my God, we’re having a baby,” John said. “Jesus, we’re having a fucking baby.”
“It sounds like it does. Do you want to try the shower, and see if hot water helps?”
“I’m tired,” Sherlock announced once they arrived back to the cottage. “And my feet are roughly the size of Brighton.”
"So…do you need qualifications or…I don't know, an interview, or something?" he asked, his gaze flitting to the man who was simply staring silently.
The milk made a stinging, metallic sound as it hit the bottom of the pail, rhythmic - sssssrit, ssssrit, sssssrit, sssssrit. "Don't pull, just massage. Make a ring of your thumb and forefinger and slide it down, light pressure. You should be familiar with the motion."
Sherlock could barely lean forward to cut the last of the Yule log in half to split with John. His belly was hot and hard and round, stuffed with serving after serving of Christmas dinner and dessert. John was likewise crammed with food. Neither of them could take more than small bites or sips of water at a time. Still, Sherlock picked up the last of the Yule log and put half on his plate, and half on John’s. “This is it. The last of it,” he said thickly, holding his aching belly with one hand. It rose and fell with each breath, a separate entity now.
"No," John says firmly, and pulls his wrist away.
“Don’t make this any harder on me than it needs to be, little one,” he murmured quietly, touching the hard line of her shoulder lightly with two fingers. “If this was your sign that you’re coming soon, I heard it loud and clear.” Of course, there was no answer, but something inside Sherlock told him that their daughter would be on her way very, very soon.
John couldn’t let go of his mate, couldn’t tear his eyes away from his lover even as their children wrapped around their legs and yowled for attention. “You’re going to stay like this now?” he asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.
Sherlock whined and tossed his head on the pillow, fighting his body every inch not to push. "Can't," he moaned, rocking up and down.
be time,” Sherlock said archly, settling in next to John and tugging his oversized shirt down.
Sherlock pulled a face. “I know,” he said, a moue of unhappiness briefly curling his mouth. “Do it.”
"What interest would you have in feeling the foetus move?" Sherlock asked, looking over his shoulder incredulously as he set the soup pot on the stove. When he turned, John looked - really looked, for the first time in months - at Sherlock's burgeoning belly. It was full and heavy under his shirt, and John was honestly surprised at how much he'd grown when John wasn't really looking.
“You’re properly huge now,” John said, and didn’t bother moving out of range of Sherlock’s playful slap. “I’ll rub some liniment on your legs tomorrow morning and suck you off as an apology,” he said, pulling up the sheets to cover them both. “For…both the wearing out and the rudeness,” he added as an afterthought.
John called their midwife and updated her on the onset of Sherlock’s labor. She instructed them to cool their heels as much as possible for now, to keep timing the contractions and not doing anything that would expend much energy. “Other than actively having a baby?” Sherlock snarked once John hung up the phone, nervously pacing across the sitting room.
“You are definitely entitled to an afternoon of laziness, and I think I’ll join you,” John said, following Sherlock and toeing off his own shoes. The cottage was delightfully warm after the chill outside, and with snow falling thick outside, it was just the right atmosphere for an afternoon nap.
Sherlock smiles. He is incredible, and John is incredible, and they have, no doubt, an unbelievably incredible child to meet, if Sherlock can
John stomped back into the house, red-faced and cold with his pantlegs soaked up to the knee. Sherlock had gleaned no small amount of glee from watching John traipse through the yard with calculated precision, working from left to right.
So instead of replying, John just shakes his head. "Thought you might want to."
John startled awake when the carriage came to a halt. He squinted out in the dark, trying to figure out where they were through his sleepy, half-drunk haze, and finally looked across at Sherlock, who was barely maintaining his composure. “D’jou get us home?” he asked, slightly incredulous. He fished for his hat and put it on his head, halfway cocked to the side.
Sherlock fell asleep first, quickly followed by Reuben. Soren, his curiosity sated, dropped off into a nap leaning against Sherlock. John, after a moment’s contemplation, pulled a blanket over the whole group of them and joined his beautiful family in sleep.
Sherlock doesn’t move.
Another hard contraction and Sherlock was pushing before he knew what he was doing. The need to bear down was too intense to ignore, and he perched on the balls of his feet in a deep squat, groaning loudly as he bore down. He rounded his back and shoved, every inch of his body tense and working to expel.
John set Cara down and let the toddler shuffle over to the sofa. She climbed up onto it with ease and put a soft hand on Sherlock’s belly, patting it. “Mornin’, Tess,” she said happily, leaning over to give the bump an exaggerated kiss.
Somehow, it did. Even through the pain and discomfort, something arousing curled deep in the pit of his stuffed belly, telling him that this was good, that this was right. “It does,” he said, letting out a little burp and another moan.
"Fuck yeah you did." John kisses his damp forehead. "Jesus, you're incredible, you're just so damn incredible."
John can’t do much more than grunt in surprise. He takes hold of Sherlock’s hips and finds he’s naked from the waist down. Sherlock pulls back to strip off his shirt.
Hours passed. The vague ‘I want to squat’ feeling that Sherlock had been having for days now only got more intense as the contractions got closer together, pushing the baby down further and closer to his not-quite-ready birth canal. He alternated his time walking slowly and squatting inelegantly, hanging off the backs of furniture heavy enough to stay in place as he dropped his arse to his heels and waggled his knees back and forth. It was just enough to sate that urgent feeling, and made him feel like he was more open, at least.
Their spoons scraped the bottoms of their bowls before Sherlock spoke. "Omega pregnancies have a higher success rate with a Bonded Alpha," he started.
Bite by bite, that piece disappeared too, and then a smaller one after it. Sherlock felt replete, bigger and heavier than he’d ever been before. His stomach was hot to the touch and jutting out further than he thought it could. Blue veins seemed to be pushed toward the surface, as if straining to cover the excess he’d consumed.
John swallowed hard. “Alright then. We can--“
Sherlock pushed his sleep trousers down and off his wide hips and climbed back onto the bed, bypassing his side and tossing the covers back. He straddled John’s hips, startling the Alpha into a muzzy awake state, and started to move as much as his laden body would allow. “What’s going on?” a bleary John mumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and peering up in the darkness, trying to figure out what Sherlock was doing.
“I’ve never been so full in my life,” John replied, burping and holding his belly carefully. His t-shirt was tight, too, the hem riding up just like Sherlock’s. “I’m not sure if I can eat anything else.”
Sherlock shook his head. “It didn’t,” he said plainly, bending down to pull the milk from the fridge. He rested the jug on his bump as he straightened back up, putting a hand on his lower back as he did. “Oof. I’m not sure I’ve got four weeks left in me,” he said, shuffling forward to pour milk over his cereal.
John shook his head. “No, no. If you think being serval will be easier on you, then that’s the smart decision to make. No reason to keep you like this if it’s really uncomfortable.”
"Oh, shut up, I'm doing it," John rolled his eyes and bent over, opening his mouth wide and taking Sherlock's shoulder between his teeth and biting down. Sherlock's body went rigid and then limp beneath him, and John felt warm spurts of come coat his stomach. The taste of blood hit his tongue and he bit deeper still, making sure their bondmark was deep and permanent. Sherlock was
They had hired a rental car to get them from the train station to their cottage, which was about ten minutes outside of town on a rather twisty road. The isolation was beautiful, though - it had snowed a few days prior and the snow had still stuck around, blanketing the earth in a thick coat of white that muffled any noise. Sherlock watched out the window as John navigated the narrow road, admiring the quiet peace of their surroundings. Their cottage had a large green-and-red wreath on the front door, and with smoke puffing from the chimney, the little house did look very Christmassy. Sherlock said as much to John as they pulled in, and John agreed.
Then the smell hit him. It smelt like his heat but
“You got me sticky,” Sherlock complained, grimacing as he propped himself up on his elbows. “Though, to be fair, I got myself sticky, too. Why am I always the sticky one?” He reached over and took John’s face in his hands, claiming one last kiss.
The next contraction was strong, and Sherlock was glad he no longer had his arm deep inside as he watched the cow pushing and straining. He would be doing this soon, he thought with a wan grimace. Behind him, John worked the comealong furiously, and with a rush of fluid the calf's head and neck slid forth, leaving its legs dangling and tongue lolling.
The heat box was ready, packed with blankets and pillows and a lamp over top to keep Sherlock and the kittens warm. Sherlock still preferred to lay in John’s lap, belly-up - but not for rubs, anymore, but because any other position put too much strain on his spine. He shifted constantly, searching for comfortable positions. John cradled the big cat in the crook of his arm, stroking his head and scratching his ears and trying to comfort his mate in any way he could. They both waited for their kittens to come.
“Mummy?” she asked quietly, and Sherlock shook his head.
“Think about how good it’ll feel when you’re even fuller,” John said, and cut a big piece of cake, holding it to Sherlock’s lips.
“It must only eat yours, Soren, because I haven’t lost a sock in the whole time I’ve lived here,” Sherlock said with a grin. “It must just like the taste of little boy socks.”
He arched his back when John bit his nipple hard, and the arch put the head of John’s cock just over his seam, and Sherlock let out a broken, throaty cry and shivered bodily in John’s lap as he came. Now, his orgasms were mostly internal, intense rippling and contractions of his channel around John’s cock, all culminating in a weak stream of clear liquid from his cock that glossed the bottom of his belly. He held on tight as John thrust twice more and then followed him into orgasm with a grunt. His breathing was loud and hot on John’s ear as little trails of electric pain crackled through his strained muscles, rendering him immobile on John’s lap. “I can’t move,” he said helplessly half a minute later, releasing his grip on the head board and bringing his hand to a fluttering halt on John’s shoulder.
“Go where, exactly? I’m not really meant to travel very far at the moment,” Sherlock said. Only thirty-four weeks, but close enough to due that he wanted to be close to their hospital in case something happened.
is a human being meant to be so
"Cor, it's moving?" John asked, and looked at Sherlock's rounded belly incredulously. "I didn't realise you were that far along, really, I mean I see you every day-"
John has always thought it unfair when it rains at funerals, as if the family needs something else to go wrong. But he can’t deny that there’s a certain obscene quality to lowering someone into the ground on a bright, sunny day. At the very least, he figures they merit clouds. Instead, the sun is bright and the weather unseasonably pleasant.
“You should drink your soda,” John suggested, kneading the tight skin of Sherlock’s lower belly and giving him another few seconds of cream. “I got you a straw.” Sherlock twisted his head and saw the can there, open, with the straw inside. He looked back down at himself, at his bloated, full middle, and he ran a hand down his body, fingers prodding at his tight skin, cupping the curve of his stomach. He nodded, scratched at his full belly for a moment, and then reached up for the can.
John sat in the straw for a few minutes, wondering why he'd gotten so angry at Sherlock for a simple suggestion. He felt horrifically guilty. Gladstone grunted next to his ear, interrupting his thoughts, and licked John across the face. John had laughed and pushed him away. "None of that, you great bloody brute."
“Come out,” she mumbled into his hip, and Sherlock smiled.
He pushed again with the next contraction and the burning got worse, until he was certain he was shouting with the pain. It went white-hot and unbearable, but a second later the burning abated and he felt a strange weight and pressure.
Without pain to inhibit his pushes, Sherlock bore down eagerly and for as long as he could with each contraction. His breathing was heavy and sweat beaded on his forehead. He pried his eyes open when he heard John make a noise and his gaze shifted to the reflection in the mirror. To his surprise he saw a dark head opening him wide, their baby’s head emerging already.
“He isn’t wrong, darling, though I’m not sure whose condition is more fragile right now,” she said, glancing downward at Sherlock’s middle. “But either way, we are positively delighted to see you, and so glad you were able to make it even in your state.”
“I have an alternate proposal,” John said, setting to work on Sherlock’s right ankle. “How about I rub this foot and then I bugger
“Wonderful. Sounds just right. I’m going to go get some things set up in your bedroom, I’ll holler if I need anything. Keep timing for me if you can, John, and Sherlock - do whatever feels right.” She patted Sherlock’s shoulder again and retreated down the hallway to their bedroom.
“Yeah, I sort of figured. The last time you vomited was when you were still having morning sickness. Nausea sometimes comes along with the onset of labor.” John paused, and took a deep breath. “Which is to say, it seems like we’re having a baby.”
“She’s a good size for a twin,” John agreed. “Now let’s see about that sibling of hers, shall we?” He moved back onto the bed, situating himself behind Sherlock once more.
Heats weren’t what they used to be. Anymore it was like a low-grade itch, sometimes one that Sherlock didn’t even know needed scratched until John happened across it. Sometimes it was nothing more than a few moody days where Sherlock was a tetchy sonofabitch, being extra snappish and fussy until John looked at the calendar and said ‘ah’ and took Sherlock to bed. Sometimes, he’d be the one to catch on first. When that happened, it was more like it used to be. More seduction. More ‘come-take-me-to-bed.’ A spark, sometimes. A spark.
“Yeah. Me too.” John looked up as Soren put a DVD in the player and searched for the ‘play’ button. “Want you, just one last time tonight. Feel up for it?”
“Another girl, love,” John’s voice said, close to Sherlock’s ear. “You did it. You made two beautiful, perfect daughters.” He moved, and Sherlock felt the shifting of the cord and the snick of the scissors as it was cut, and then John wrapped the second one in another towel and started to clean Sherlock off a little.
The answer is both obvious and unspeakably banal: Sherlock is
Sherlock stood under the spray until the hot water started to run out. Blessedly, he’d had about forty minutes of relief from the shower. “I think I want to have her in the tub,” he said, gesturing to the claw-footed tub on the other side of the bath. “The water helped. And it’ll be easier to clean a tub than anywhere else in the house.”
"Another sandwich. Have one for yourself, I packed plenty." Sherlock took the second sandwich John handed him and ate it slowly this time, instead of scarfing it down. John took a sandwich for himself and ate, thankful that Sherlock had packed plenty. A sandwich and crisps just wasn't enough for lunch, not for all this walking.
“You’re welcome. You focus on what you need to stay comfortable, and I’ll handle the rest.” John gave a last pat to Sherlock’s back and went outside to try and get cell service.
People start to call and text John, asking about the funeral.
“I did call to make an inquiry,” John admitted, barely stifling a shamed grin. “They had an opening for next weekend, if we book quickly.”
“Did you get...bigger overnight?” John asked carefully the next morning. Sherlock was sat at the kitchen table, leaning forward and chewing slowly on a spoonful of cereal. He felt not unlike a sloth, slowly ambling from place to place and taking his time with each task - the baby’s change in position had him feeling a bit like a boat trying to turn broad-side in the sea, fighting the current with every step he took.
John worked at him and soon he was hard enough that John could bob up and down on his cock. Sherlock rubbed his stomach with one hand lazily, enjoying the heightened pleasure after his extreme bloating. His belly was fuller than it had ever been, and so round and tight that he could just see the top of John’s head over its full curve. And the pressure was -
, not talking! Not to me, not to Mycroft, not to anybody. He didn't care about the funeral. He only eats when I make him, and I'm pretty sure he only showers because it hurts less when he does. And I—shit, I need—someone who will. He's the only one who went through it all with me, and now he's all—gone. Jesus, Greg, it's like I lost them both."
John laid his hand next to Sherlock’s and rubbed softly. “I honestly hadn’t even thought about that,” he admitted. “I guess I was just picturing you having them like this. As a human. Ish.” He stroked Sherlock’s tail.
Sherlock's face contorts as his body pulls him back down.
Soon, both kittens were dry and nursing from Sherlock. John, fascinated, watched the little family. His brow furrowed when Sherlock stood up again, disrupting the kitten’s nursing. “Bit rude,” he said, and Sherlock shot him a glare.
As Sherlock reached his last week of pregnancy, from their calculations, his body started to prepare. His belly hung low and full, fur sparse as skin stretched over the kittens that were almost full-size. He only ever moved to eat, drink, or use the litter box, and even those tasks seemed like a strain. John figured he’d go into labour any day, and officially took his leave from the clinic.
here.”
that Sherlock, in a drug-induced haze, forgot to insist on a condom, the man hadn't realised he was pregnant until after he'd settled in at his auntie's farm in late September. By that time, he was far enough removed from London and the ability to have an abortion that he would have to suffer through the pregnancy and give the child up for adoption upon its birth; he neither wanted the child nor felt himself capable of caring for it on his own. As much as he loathed the idea, he wouldn't be able to care for the sheep herd by himself, either, though when his auntie had died mere weeks after he moved in she'd left him more than enough inheritance money to pay someone to do the work for him. God knew he'd need assistance; he was having enough trouble walking out to pasture to care for the beasts as it was, and he still had five months left.
“Oh my god,” he breathed, tears streaking his hot cheeks. He stared at the ceiling and touched their daughter’s head. He was very still until another contraction came and he pushed again, letting himself shout again as the burning pain got worse and worse until it peaked and then subsided, and the hand that had been brushing his daughter’s head now cradled it. He looked at John with awe and worry, his fingers fumbling, until John reached down and breathed a sigh of relief and said, “No cord. Keep pushing, she is - god, Sherlock, she is
Not much changed in the way of chores; John continued to do everything but feed the chickens and collect eggs. They woke up together in the mornings, Sherlock did the loathesome household chores while John worked outside, and they ate their meals together. John caught him with his hand on his belly every now and then, cradling the swell. On occasion, Sherlock would pull John's hand down to feel, tentatively pressing it against an elbow or knee. John loved those moments, when Sherlock felt open enough to let John feel his baby as it grew.
John withdraws and goes off to bed. He holds out hope for some time that Sherlock is just lagging, that he would be along eventually. He falls asleep still waiting.
"Sorry," Sherlock croaks, when a contraction has passed and he is unclamping his hand from around John's wrist.
Sherlock opens his mouth and scoops John's cock into the circle of his lips. John's eyelids flutter. Sherlock has done this before, has gently suckled John's soft cock into hardness with heartrending patience. He's trying the same now. It's all too apparent from the way he's working his tongue under John's foreskin and massaging the backs of John's thighs. Usually, it gets John hard as iron inside of a minute. Tonight, though...
Sherlock frowned for a moment, hoisted both full milk pails, and trod toward the milk house.
“What is it, Daddy?” Soren asked, looking up from his puzzle on the floor.
“What would you like for dinner tonight, love?” John asked, mussing Sherlock’s hair affectionately as he put his breakfast dishes in the sink. He was planning to stop by the grocery on his way home from work and make something nice for dinner - Sherlock’s appetite was increasing along with his size, and sandwiches (their usual for dinner) weren’t quite cutting it for the serval anymore.
“Alright, alright,” Sherlock said, taking a bigger bite of his potatoes and ignoring how full his stomach was.
He waits until Mycroft is down the stairs and out the door before he gets up and goes to Sherlock, taking Mycroft’s place at his side and settling one hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
He stares up at the machines around the hospital bed, quietly beeping away.
"You're welcome, John. Happy Christmas."
“Pregnancy isn’t terribly kind to you, is it?” John asked, huffing a laugh. “You poor thing.”
"Yes," Sherlock murmured, the hand on his stomach sliding back and forth slowly. "Research has shown that it provides the best start for an infant. I'd be a woefully bad parent if I didn't breastfeed."
Sherlock stirred the soup, silent and deep in thought. "Come here, John," he said finally, quietly.
"I don't know," he says, and before he can stop it, he's saying everything. "He doesn't talk.
“Consider the mood entirely killed.” Sherlock shoved John off and went to pull the sheet up. John stopped him with a kiss to the cheek, and then one to the lips, and a hand roughly caressing one breast, rubbing the nipple between thumb and forefinger. “...Maybe not.”
"Sherlock!"
"And which of those isn't fulfilled in this situation?"
It was round all over now, not just the top where he’d filled himself with liquids. His lower stomach was rounded and full with whipped cream, and his shirt was stretching tight around his middle. “More,” he breathed, plucking at the tight cotton fabric. John smiled, patted Sherlock’s belly, and pressed down on the nozzle again.
John does some searching on the Internet, glad at least that Sherlock doesn’t glare at him for the slow tap-tap of his fingers on the keys. He wants to help, even if Sherlock doesn’t want him to. He takes his laptop into the kitchen and works in there for the quarter-hour or so it takes to succeed in his endeavor.
“...have to. You’ve John to think of, if nothing else.”
Just a week before Christmas, John inquired about supplies. They weren't running terrifically low, but it would be nice to have some food to spare in case some wicked Scottish weather cropped up and shut them in for weeks. It wasn't out of the question, he thought, peering out onto the moors. They were well and truly remote.
Labor
The calf, whom John had named Gladstone, was growing quickly, and at lunch one day John interrupted the silence to ask if Sherlock was going to halter train the young bull. Sherlock had looked at John quizzically and told him he'd had no plans of doing any such thing, but John found an old worn rope halter looped around the fence pole the next morning. He began by slipping the halter on the young calf while he ate, letting him get used to the feeling, and then tying him up for a few minutes a day to get used to the rope. Sherlock scoffed when he saw John crooning to the calf, and said that simply tying him up for a day would break him far easier, and that he was coddling the bull. John snapped back that if Sherlock wasn't the one training the bull, he could back off and let John do whatever the hell he wanted. Sherlock had blinked and stalked off, and as he walked away John had slid down and sat in the straw next to the calf.
“Almost, almost, almost,” Sherlock sighed, wincing as the contraction ended. “Almost only counts in horse-shoes and hand grenades. Not in childbirth.” John laughed and Sherlock even cracked a smile, prying his eyes open and looking up at John. Even in late labor, his eyes still shone with love. John kissed the center of his forehead tenderly.
“Was that real?” John asked, helping Sherlock back to the bench and lowering him down. “Was that —“
was rocking chairs and kitsch on the shelves. Sherlock despised kitsch, aside from the skull. And neither of them would ever be caught dead in a rocking chair. Their living room still had the same two chairs, taken without question from Baker Street and transplanted into their house in Sussex. There was a new mantle, but with the same knife stuck into it, for old time’s sake.
"I'm sorry, but I don't think you said - what is your name?"
“Yes, but then you had another meal, Sherlock. Another meal deserves another dessert. I’ve got you a nice big slice of chocolate cake, I picked it up earlier today just for this. You don’t want to let it go to waste, do you?” John asked, bringing the plate back over to the table and setting it down in Sherlock’s line of sight.
"I do my best."
“I don’t think I can wait any longer,” Sherlock repeated, shifting uncomfortably on his feet. John nodded and stepped forward, enveloping his mate in another long hug. He felt Sherlock trembling this time, and a tear ran down John’s cheek.
Sherlock huffed and crossed his arms. "What makes you so sure it's a him?" He inquired, looking haughty.
“No,” Sherlock whined, and then, “Yes, but I need help standing up.” He sounded pitiful and pained.
John repeated the name. Sherlock could feel his laugh more than he could hear it, with John’s chest pressed against his upper back. “Yeah, I mean. I think that might be it.”
"You're the one who said bonding with me was logical. You said you loved me."
“Can’t argue with Mummy.”
Only when her cord was cut by John’s steady hand and once she was wrapped in a warm, soft towel did she quiet, resting on Sherlock’s aching chest and sleeping already. Close to her mother’s heart, hearing again its comfortable, reliable beat, she was lulled to sleep, unaware of the bustle of activity surrounding her arrival. Sherlock was reclined on a pile of pillows, recently delivered of an eight-pound, six-ounce infant and her accompanying placenta, sponge-bathed and exhausted and watching his daughter with rapt adoration.
Eventually, John set their firstborn down in the box and, with Sherlock’s permission, picked the second one up. It seemed equally lost in the arms of a human, but went quiet when John held it close and kept it warm. Sherlock repeated his pantomime and John obliged. “Another girl,” he said, and Sherlock nodded. The cat seemed tired but proud, and John was proud of him.
“What are you doing?” John asked thickly, his thighs spread wide and belly sticking out proudly on his middle.
They walked another mile in silence, weeds rustling in the gentle wind. As they crested the hill, the landscape suddenly opened and spread out in front of John and Sherlock, miles and miles of dull green grasses and bright purple flowers, brown foliage and deep green trees. The clouds overhead cast slowly-moving shadows across the valley, and sheep dotted the hillsides in small packs.
“I’ll help you, love,” John said, taking Sherlock’s arms and helping him stand. Sherlock made a noise of discomfort and shifted his weight from foot to foot, a move John recognized as the pressure of their daughter’s descent making Sherlock’s nerves smart and his bones ache. “C’mon, into the shower. It’ll help.”
Before Sherlock’s state forced them into temporary leave, John had written up a number of cases he had never posted before. He had a decent dozen or so, and figured he could put one up every couple of weeks, for the folks who weren’t interested in the baby pictures they were liable to be flooded with. Now, at the very least, they’d have something to read while they speculated about what had happened, and where Sherlock Holmes had gone.
“It’s a girl,” the doctor told them, pausing the wavering image so that John and Sherlock could see. “Congratulations. You’re having a daughter.”
"It's coming, John, I can feel it," Sherlock gritted out as John peeled his wet clothes off. He clutched at the doorframe and then stood, shivering, waiting for John to dry him off.
John cried when Sherlock told him. He gathered him up in shaking arms and pressed kisses to his cheeks and chin and jaw and neck, and Sherlock felt warm tears left in the wake of John’s lips. “You’re going to be amazing,” he breathed, with his fist curled up in Sherlock’s shirt just beside his shoulder.
"Sorry, sorry," John apologised, but Sherlock just growled and reached around him to toss the contraption out the open door. "Wasn't sure if you needed it for this or not."
“Help me up,” Sherlock grumbled. He’d managed to sit up, but couldn’t rise on his own from the mattress. On the other side of the bed, John grunted and rolled over. “Now. Please,” he added as an afterthought, gritting his teeth - he needed to pee, and his back ached, and if he fidgeted to relieve the ache it made the pressure on his bladder worse. He tapped his foot impatiently while John walked around the bed and hauled him up, and moved as fast as he could to the toilet.
“Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, and they won’t be open. We’ll have to order take-home portions tonight.” He paused to chew and swallow, and then smiled. “And I
“I’ll make everything else tingle,” John replied, scratching the side of Sherlock’s belly lightly and leading him by the hand toward the bedroom. Sherlock followed, his wide waddle evident even through the single point of contact. “What do you want, hmm?” he asked on the way, pausing just inside the door to flick on a bedside lamp.
Sherlock hummed an affirmative reply. “Tired. Want to meet him.” He patted his belly and leaned a little against John.
There’s no point in lying, not to him. John shrugs helplessly. "Like...this. All the time. He eats whatever I give him, and he showers. Besides that?" He gestures to the couch. "Right there."
John laughed and ran his hand up Sherlock’s side again. He loved seeing his husband like this - so much more of him to touch and hold, and all of it soft and warm and smooth. “Having babies looks so good on you,” he said softly, feeling a rippling movement echo beneath his fingers.
“Almost here,” Sherlock echoed, his voice raw, and another contraction came and he bore down again.
For as much lead-up as there had been, the first kitten was brought forward within five minutes. A slick little body tumbled from Sherlock’s, covered in membranes and mewling pitifully. Sherlock gnawed at the pink umbilical cord until he had severed it, and then licked the mewling kitten all over, stimulating the little being to breathe and wiggle and walk. John took pictures through teary eyes, wanting to capture the birth of their children even if it was potentially the most unconventional birth he’d ever witnessed.
thoroughly.
John had apologised at lunch, but Sherlock didn't respond. The man seemed more distant than usual, which was really saying something. He spent the entirety of dinner with one hand on his growing stomach, and left the dishes on the table when he was finished, retreating to his room without a word of acknowledgement to John.
Sherlock chuckled. "Yes, I'll calve around the same time she will."
“Not really,” he said, glancing down at his bump. “I feel gargantuan, but I don’t like the idea of shunting her out before she’s ready. I want her to come when she’s done.”
-----
John watched closely as Sherlock put the milk back and sat at the table. “I’m not sure you have either, love,” he said. Sherlock had gotten truly large with this baby, and it was taxing him more than John had expected it would. “We’ll see what your doctor thinks today. Maybe she’ll want you induced, if she thinks Tess is too big.”
He made a plate for himself and one for John, taking care that the portions were equal on both plates. He passed John’s plate across the table and sat down in his regular chair. He’d changed into pajama pants and a plain t-shirt, and John had done the same. Just changing into comfortable clothes to prepare for their meal was enough to have John on edge, and Sherlock watched as he took the first bite.
Sherlock was sobbing, eyes open and watching John as intently as he could through the torrent of tears streaming from his eyes. "Give her to me," he choked out, and John did just that, handing over Sherlock's newborn daughter and letting his own tears fall as he watched father and daughter for the first time.
“I suppose I can let it happen, but just this once.” Sherlock smiled and adjusted his position, leaning into John and his gentle, careful embrace. “Just this once.”
“The muscles that need to be loose are getting loose,” John assured, turning on the shower and letting it run until it was hot. “Everything else takes second place, so far as your body’s concerned. The hot water should help with some of that, though.”
—a fine nest of dark curls, a soft nose that is
Sherlock makes a motion like a shrug, but without raising his shoulders all the way. “What do they care?”
"I did get you a Christmas gift, you arse, but I don't know if I'm going to give it to you now," John grumbled, as Sherlock nearly howled with mirth on the sofa.
"Is obviously the rational decision. You'll get what your body wants, I'll get what
"Just breathe with me, and push as hard as you can. You can take the pain."
However, when Joanna brings James into the house and the baby reaches for Sherlock, laughing, Sherlock’s evaluative gaze lands on Jo and she grins sheepishly. “It’s early days yet,” she says, “So you stay hush.”
Sherlock leaned close to the big beast, murmuring softly and patting her flank for a few seconds and then sliding a hand down her full udder and gently pulling on one teat. "Good girl," he crooned, and slid another hand down so he could work with two teats at once.
“Nursery is done. We’ve more baby clothes than I know what to do with. We could make a blanket for all of Baker Street with the number of burping cloths we’ve been given.”
"Fucking- fuck me, John," Sherlock panted as he fell back against the mattress, spreading his legs and exposing himself to John.
The man laid on his side, facing Tess’s bassinet, and John curled up behind him, one arm laying over his waist. His warmth ebbed into Sherlock’s tired muscles, relaxing them a little, and within a minute Sherlock was asleep, too deeply to dream. Tess’s quiet but regular breaths lulled John to follow. Downstairs, Cara slept in bed with her granny, dreaming of a dark-haired little sister she’d been waiting so long to meet.
"I'm fine, John. The baby's apparently healthy, if the amount of moving around it does is any indicator."
There was the same joy at feeling her kick that he’d felt last time. As far as he could tell, John was as incandescently happy to feel her thumping inside Sherlock’s womb as he had been when Violet did the same thing, but even through the joy Sherlock could see the edges: a little ragged, a little tattered with worry.
inside. John should have known, did know, just hadn’t thought about it - but god, whether it was the lack of preparation or the weight and size of the babies or both, he was tighter than John could remember him being. He groaned and bit down on Sherlock’s shoulder just hard enough to leave indentations from his teeth, distracting himself from the vise grip Sherlock’s body had around his cock as he pushed in bit by bit until he was fully seated. Sherlock was already out of breath when John’s hips pressed against his arse, and John hadn’t even moved.
