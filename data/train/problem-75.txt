John crumbled to the sheets, his eyes closed, chest heaving. Sherlock couldn't help but look down at the other man, watching the way he wound down from climax with drowsy shifts of his muscles and a slow arch of his back that tugged at where they were connected. Sherlock rolled his hips, sighing as his seed filled John in slow spurts.
motivation. Sherlock cursed his luck at not being in the position to get a good look, he would have liked to know the face of his enemy.
Mycroft shrugged. “I’m not saying anything that Sherlock hasn’t told me. He was worried that this case would have possible….triggers.”
John laughed aloud at that, shaking his head. “I’m an omega Sherlock; we’re built to take a good shagging.” Despite his protests, though, he does not bother getting up from the bed when Sherlock does. He was proper exhausted after yesterday's stint at St. Bart’s and even more so after their escapades the night before.
“Alright, he’s missing,” A quick swipe of his palm across his eyes brushed away the tears lingering on his red-rimmed eyes. “Fuck it. I’m going to get him back.” John straightened his spine and knocked his knuckles against the bare wood of the table for emphasis, the sound of it splitting through his melancholy and giving him a sense of purpose.
His breath left a puff of condensation on the windowpane as he let out a sigh of relief. If the only thing he did with this whole situation was keep her safe, it was well worth it. Thinking critically, he dug into his pocket until he felt the hard edges of his phone. Gun still cocked, and at the ready, he unlocked the screen, dividing his attention between watching the window, the door, his downed captor, and the phone. On the screen there was a singular notification from Mycroft.
Not so many gifs in this one, it's a little difficult to actually find ones that suit the scene! Sometimes they fit in so easily, others not so much.
"What kind of question is that?" John flinched, taking a step back from the suddenly concerned eyes. More than a little confused by the change in subject. “I don’t think I’m the one we should be worrying about right now. Sherlock’s out there, alone.” John clenched his hands in his hair, a nervous habit he had developed over the last few months. He’d be bald by summer's end at this rate.
"Won't you leave it, John?" He questioned, keeping his eyes on the box as he broke it free of the packaging. He couldn't bring himself to explain how it made him want to growl, watching John remove the traces of them. John paused in what he was doing, and Sherlock was certain that he'd see the other man eyeing him with one brow raised, mouth twisted in a classic expression of contemplation if he looked up.
Sherlock turned his head up, neck extending to brush his lips against John’s chin. “Not just me, us.” He explained against the stubble of John’s chin, taking the moment to breathe in their combined scent on John’s neck. John sighed, turning his head down to press a return kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“Very good,” Mycroft’s voice was strained and despite his attempt at sounding calm John could hear the concern in his voice. In the background, there was the sound of doors opening and shouting, followed by the electric zing of tasers and curses. Apparently Mycroft’s people had made contact with the men in the blue SUV.
There was no need to imagine now. He took to worshiping John with all the ease of a man who had been thinking about the many ways he could do so for years. He kneaded his hands along the small of John's back until he had a handful of John's warm posterior. He sucked and licked and explored honeyed skin to his heart's content. It was new and different, so different than he had ever expected. It was John that was a surprise, for all Sherlock's deductions, he'd never anticipated this; an open, willing partner with little to no reservations for the sudden new turn they had taken.
“Yes, well, it’s a little late for that. I’ve taken care of it.” John snapped, glancing at the two downed assailants.
“John Watson, you have quite the mouth on you like this.” Sherlock grinned, biting the band to John’s briefs, one hand supporting the arch of John’s back, the other sliding against the rigid swell of his cock, seeking the outline of its shape, thick and hard to the touch.
"Sherlock!?" Lestrade's voice echoed through the small room. Sherlocked heaved a gasp of relief, backing away to give himself some space.
"Well, he's been exposed, but shows none of the standard symptoms." She admitted, turning his head this way and that, examining his neck and ears and forcing his mouth open with a tongue depressor. "At this stage, he should be feral already. He's a second-gen infection, and they don't last long compared to the first set." She explained, tossing her gloves and the stick in a biohazard baggy before snatching up the hand sanitizer and applying it liberally. Another set of gloves slipped on to her wrinkled fingers like a second skin. When she straightened her spine to glower up at the two of them, it was a thing of beauty.
Sherlock thought, pressing a large palm over his face, digging at his eyes with thumb and forefinger to rub away the salty crust that had lingered on his lashes since he’d watched the ambulance crew take young August away.
“That’s it love, come for me.” He hissed, turning his head so his teeth bit into the swell of John’s thigh where it slung over his shoulder, one hand gripped the blonds thigh and opening the omega up wide for every thrust of his cock into the smaller male. John took it eagerly, cursing through his orgasm with energetic creativity. The clenching of John’s inner muscles around him as the omega came was more than enough to send Sherlock over the edge. It only took a few more thrusts and pleasure flared bright and hot behind his eyes, making his body tense and still most of its fevered movements. Grabbing John’s hips he ground down into John’s channel and had the presence of mind to open his eyes in time to watch John take his knot as he spilled his seed deep inside.
Hours later, Sherlock took the steps from New Scotland Yard two at a time, his long legs carrying him into the darkened twilight of Westminster. After the stagnant warmth of the police headquarters, the city air was almost refreshing. It had been hours since he'd found Sebastian and called the ambulance.
John wrinkled his nose and chuckled against the other man’s lips, finally squinting one eye open enough to peer up into Sherlock’s mischievous eyes. They were blue today, like the morning sky. His mop of black hair tousled by last night's ministrations, and he looked positively edible.
John had told him once, tone warm and cheerful, the mirth in his eyes exposed by the crinkles of golden skin at the corners,
Soon enough, a line of fifteen men and women stumbled from the cramped confines, whimpering and flinching from the men. Sherlock could see the difference between captors and captives just by the way they moved. The captors were rough and aggressive, shoving and pushing, shouting indistinct orders to each other from across the way. Whereas the captives exhibit symptoms of illness and pain, swaying in line, despondent and terrified. The rain obscured their scents, but Sherlock didn't need his nose to tell him every one of those men and women were omegas. The growl that left his lips was involuntary, a slip of instincts he quickly tamped down.
John woke to the rocking sway of the bed as Sherlock shifted beside him. Moments before, there had been the telltale sound of his phone chiming. Now, there was mostly the enveloping warmth of Sherlock's skin as he reached across John’s body to grab the cellphone from the bedside table. John grumbled drowsily, shoving at the expanse of Sherlock’s thin chest in an effort to get some breathing room back. He was far too aware of what had happened the night before to be confused as to why he was in Sherlock's bed, but it couldn’t be past dawn, and he’d been looking forward to a bit of a sleep-in. The delicious aches and pains in his body were testament enough for a couple of hours more rest.
"I'm saying you can put a bullet between his eyes if you like, but it'd be a right waste if this boy ended up being our first case of immunity to the virus." She snapped.
John felt his face turning into a dark scowl of fierce anger as he looked between the man’s hands and his placating gesture. “What the fuck was that, huh?” He shouted, rolling his shoulders to ease the sharp ache.
John snorted his own blue eyes, wrinkling at the corners. “Get off with you than you, madman!” He commanded and just managed to swing a pillow at the detective’s retreating back, laughing when it tangled in Sherlock’s Belstaff.
Cigarette smoke lingered in the interior of the cab as he hopped in the back, commandeering it to follow the van with a sharp command. He breathed shallowly in an attempt to distract himself from the familiar smell.  The cabby hardly notice. He was a large set man with a receding hairline and sweaty demeanor, and better yet seemed indifferent to what might have been considered rather shady commands. Grunting his agreement he pulled out and followed after Eddington’s men. Sherlock was pleased enough when the alpha proved to follow at a discrete distance, seemingly slightly more observant than the standard driver.
he had to be here. The Keeper, the man running this whole show. Every piece of intelligence he'd gathered up to now had pointed here. This was where their leader was. It had to be! How could he be wrong?
Sherlock thought, a thrill of excitement making the hairs on his neck stand up. He did so love the chase. Overhead lightning zinged across the sky, thunder crashed, ringing in Sherlock’s ears. The rain picked up, sleeting out of the sky in heavy droughts. Through the sudden onslaught Sherlock completely missed the sound of the cab door opening behind him. He only became aware of the other alpha’s presence when the man stepped up next to him. Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes and turning to face the alpha with a raised brow.
Sherlock couldn't resist the urge to turn his lips to that dripping, wet entrance. His tongue dipped down, the taste of sweet honeydew and omega bursting onto his tastebuds as he tasted John's hole, tongue easing into the hot core of him, dipping inside and working alongside his fingers. He tasted like heaven, a cocktail of sweet, sweet desire spilling down Sherlock's tongue.
It's a rather pithy concept, but wouldn't be the most surprising motivation Sherlock has over heard of. And the man does smell something awful. Most beta's have a calming, half present scent, not this man. It's
"Shut up, Lestrade," Sherlock growled, reaching out to twist the handle and push the door open on creaking hinges. On the other side was a poorly lit hallway with three doors. A light at the end of the hall flickered. Lestrade's voice crackled on the other line, then disappeared as Sherlock descended into the depths of the building.
The buildings on either side were vacant. This was probably intentional. It was difficult to have nefarious, underhanded dealings when the neighbors kept looking out the window while they made tea.
John sighed drowsily, adjusting the pillow under his head into a more comfortable. "A little late for that Sherlock, but no, not really, feels good... full," John admitted, voice dropping into a contented purr. Sherlock growled low in his throat at that, rocking his hips in a slow grind into the hot grasp of John's channel. Sherlock cried out loud as John's channel tightened, milking around Sherlock's cock with eager pulls of muscle. John's fingers clutch around his biceps as he whimpers through the aftershocks. They both relish the shared moment, breathing in each other's bodies in heady gasps.
He moved to jerk away from the other man, clutching a hand to his neck and stumbling back several steps in the mud. For a moment he considered fighting or running, or maybe a little of both, but he nixed those ideas as useless wastes of energy. He’d taken a direct hit to one of his main arteries. The chances of him making it more than a block were minimal at best. He had a high tolerance for these sorts of things, something brought on by personal experimentation and a drug addiction that was unhindered by standards. All that was useless until the worst of the side-effects wore off; he’d be as useful as a milk-fed kitten. Besides, there was so much more to gain by staying right here.
“Christ, I don’t remember ever seeing you do something so…mundane before.” John stared, wondering if he should photograph this moment, for posterity’s sake, if nothing else.
There was no need to imagine now. He took to worshiping John with all the ease of a man who had been thinking about the many ways he could do so for years. He kneaded his hands along the small of Johns back until he had a handful of John’s warm posterior. He sucked and licked and explored honeyed skin to his heart's content. It was new, and different, so different than he had ever expected. It was John that was a surprise, for all Sherlock's deductions he'd never expected this; an open willing partner with little to no reservations for the sudden new turn they had taken.
Hours later Sherlock took the steps from New Scotland Yard two at a time, his long legs taking him into the darkened twilight of Westminster. After the stagnant warmth of the police headquarters the city air was almost refreshing. It’d been hours since he’d found August and called the ambulance. He did so hate giving police reports. A missing person, no matter how sickly, did not fall under Lestrade’s division, so he hadn’t been able to shove the paperwork off on the detective. Needless to say it had been tedious and terribly dull, doting his I’s and crossing his T’s. Unfortunately, absolutely none of it had distracted his mind from the horrible sight
"Please, I just want to see my mother." He whimpered, eyes downcast. Lying, again. Why? Why would he lie about something like that? Dammit! Sherlock couldn't think through his wailing.
there, maybe things would have turned out differently, and Sherlock would be in the room with them, enjoying a cup of tea.
“Yes, give us one moment Maeve.” Mycroft rolled up his window and gave a final look at the camera on his screen before turning his eyes to the seat in front of him. Anthea sat there, looking proper in her two-piece dress suit. Her alpha eyes were trained on him, attentive and concerned. Her ever-present phone was curled in her manicured palm. She had direct access to his laptop, and he had no doubt she’d been watching and listening in on the conversation from the very beginning. There was a high probability she was continuing to record the audio from John’s unfortunate ride right this moment, adding the task to her list without even asking.
Sherlock growled, a low sound of annoyance, cursing under his breath as the group surrounding him eased up onto their feet, officers preparing their firearms as they made ready to attack.
Recognizing one's mortality was always a bit of a downer, recognizing the mortality of the man he had been harboring feelings for during the past two or more years was possibly worse.
John listened with rapt attention as the puzzle piece fell into place. Mycroft described how he’d called Sherlock that morning, three months ago, and urged his younger brother to go to the dock. There had been some developing action, an unmarked cargo ship that seemed out of place. “Of course, I had him go observe, but when it was time for him to check-in, he never did,” Mycroft explained with a sigh, tapping his nails against the table, the only indication that what he was saying in any way affected him.
So John set out looking for someone, anyone, who had seen or heard from Sherlock in those vital hours before he had gone to the dock. Sherlock’s network was suspiciously absent- he suspected they had booked it when Mycroft’s men came searching. Not giving up, he hounded all the standard back alleys and dens. He checked the underpasses and went into the boroughs of Newham as far as someone dressed as smart as he dared. He'd had to retreat after the occupants of the homeless camps there had shouted at him and thrown a few empty cans, disgruntled at his presence. The familiar faces he had become known to were nowhere to be found. It took three days of combing the streets to finally make contact with one of Sherlock’s network. His search only became fruitful when he came across a young girl named Anya.
“Oh, don’t be an over-reactive ninny, John. He hardly meant you to take it so...personally.” Mycroft’s voice faded as he walked away, catching a whiff of something familiar coming from the back of the building. A light, barely-there scent that was almost overwhelmed by the stench of the place. If he had been walking any faster, he might not have even caught the scent at all. Stumbling to a halt he spun in place, ignoring Mycroft’s raised eyebrow and blessedly silent mouth, to focus on that evasive aroma before it disappeared entirely. Beside him, he heard Mycroft inhale slowly, trying to catch the same scent John had.
Pivoting to roll on his back, John gritted his teeth as the shards embedded in his back dug in deeper. The omega’s handhold on his legs lost the moment he flipped over, with a snarl Sherlock’s violin slammed down onto the omega’s head. The vibrant belly of it cracked on his attacker's face, the strings singing out their abuse while they dragged across the man’s teeth. John forced aside any remorse he might feel as he brought it down again, shouting with the effort it took. In front of him, the omega went still, blessedly knocked unconscious for the time being.
"Surgeon first, both bones are fractured, he'll need extensive surgery. He's in shock too. We'll have our work cut out for us." Tabitha amended, her tone brooking no disagreement.
It was Greg Eddington’s work, of that he was certain, the man was somehow always one step ahead. Whatever informants Eddington used, they had to be good, highly skilled. The mysterious man knew when Sherlock was coming. New exactly what locations the detective had discovered and emptied them before Sherlock ever had the chance to see the inner workings of his laboratories. As far as Sherlock could tell the man was closing the doors on all of his inner-city back door medical wards, taking his research, his people, and his victims with him. Every day Sherlock went without a break in this blighted cases more and more people would be taken away, never to be found again.
The bite pulsated on his right hand with the beat of his heart and the pounding of his headache, keeping time to the beat of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Infected? He was beginning to think so. His brow felt fevered, his muscles ached. The headache could be blamed on the tranquilizer, but the rest was all much too convenient given the bite on his hand and the circumstance he currently found himself in.
Sherlock caught the box out of the air with a soft grunt. The package was new. They went through bandages far more often than most people, given their day jobs. He used his nails to work at the tape as John swiped the washcloth from the bed. Sherlock scowled down at the box, forcing himself not to watch what John was doing. His mood dampened considerably further at the thought of the other man washing away all the evidence of their coming together. He tried to force down those baser instincts but couldn't quite manage it.
“John…you have no idea how long I have been waiting to see you like this,” Sherlock admitted, sitting back on his heels, crouched among the sheets and bedding. God, his name on Sherlock’s lips had never sounded so good. The hand Sherlock runs down John’s nude hip is like a brand, rough and hot. John swallows hard and shifts on the bed, arching his hips up against the pressure of Sherlock’s hands to get more of that skin on skin contact. Sherlock’s pupils were blown at the sight. John could not believe something so simple could make him feel so damn sexy.
“We’ve got ‘em sir. Want to come take a look?” She questioned, her eyes unreadable behind the lenses of her sunglasses. She had a bruise beginning to form on her jawline, a kiss of slowly darkening purple that marred the skin.
"What?" Jerking back from his position against Sherlock's neck, John gave Sherlock a look of consternation, "Don't start asking permission now, Sherlock!" His pupils were blown wide with desire, his pulse raced at his neck. He was just as impatient as Sherlock felt and maybe a little bit pissed at the question. Sherlock laughed, wiping the look off John's face by dropping to his knees in front of the omega and pressing a kiss to the light trail of hair that descended from his belly button to delve beneath the waist of his jeans. There wasn't room for any nerves, not with John there, confident and demanding.
On the bed, John swallowed, and for a moment, Sherlock caught a flicker of self-consciousness, a tremor of nerves that John hides behind the neck of the bottle of brandy as he brings it to his lips. Sherlock couldn't hold it against him. His own heartbeat is rattling in his chest like an excited bird in a cage. Sherlock tilted his head to the side, considering the sight before him. John's tan skin pairs well with the burgundy of Sherlock's duvet. Gold and garnet, and oh so-
“Talk to me John.” Mycroft spoke up after a few moments of too long silence and listened with grim intent to the sound of John’s labored breath through the bluetooth headset attached to his ear.
There was a scuffle of movement in the dark, a moaning sob that would have sent those with a lesser spirit running. Sherlock turned his light to the movement, twisted his wrist until the torchlight landed on a small figure crumbled in the corner of the room. Sherlock was not in close enough proximity to see full details, but even from this distance he could see that the other man’s short stature and small hands were indicative of an omega. Furthermore, the exposed skin of his dirty hands was wrinkle-free and unthinned by age, speaking of a younger individual.
It was all primal instinct, age-old base animal need. Omega males were notoriously infertile, with the chance of procreation less than one percent in unbonded males. Even a happy, healthy omega, in their prime, and bonded to an alpha, would have trouble becoming with child. Omega biology was quite fascinating, they'd evolved to bare children, only for there own anatomy to betray them and make it impossible to do so.
“We searched, John; we’ve been searching. He’s disappeared, and none of my sources can find him.” Mycroft explained, finally lifting his gaze to look John in the eyes. “These are people who know how to make someone
On the sixth day, they found another abandoned location, this time it was a warehouse. John starred up at the abandoned hulking mass of brick and mortar. Just looking at it had his mind filling with a foreboding sense of dread. Even meters away, as he was, he could smell it. The scent of blood and death and illness that seemed to ooze from the building like an infected sore.
Sherlock took the invitation for what it was, crowding the space between John's legs until his aching hardness butted up against John's blunt erection. Both of them spurred into overeager excitement just from the shock of coming together. John whined low in his throat, one leg shifting up to latch around Sherlock's hip so that he could grind them together, with a slow, aching roll of his hips. The hard length of him pressed against the front of Sherlock's trousers.
- That damn cabby is a jerk and has screwed over both our boys, someone should think about running him over
“I’m never-” Sherlock choaked as John shifted his hips beneath him, attempting to get comfortable. “-daft.” John just rolled his eyes, then moaned as he found a more comfortable position, spreading his legs wider to accommodate for Sherlock’s size and tilting his hips upwards. One leg shifted to hook over Sherlock’s shoulder again in a fascinating display of flexibility. Sherlock groaned his own approval as the new position eased him in deeper. His hands settled one on John’s hips the other on his leg, to keep him supported where he wanted to be.
"Man, adult man." Sherlock corrected her, relief flooding his mind and making the room foggy. Not infected, immune, right, that was, good, very good. Wasn't it? What the hell was wrong with his brain, oh god, could a virus make you stupid? Either way, none of the symptoms she had listed had sounded at all pleasant, so yes, good.
It does hurt though, tremendously, and it’s probably best not to let himself linger too long with the other alpha.
“You, are supposed to be at that alley, gathering evidence,” Mycroft spoke up, raising a thin eyebrow, his voice ripe with annoyance.
Everything up to this moment said that this was the main operations base. There shouldn't have been any way for him to escape. Sherlock
Stepping out into the hall, he felt John's eyes lingering on his bare backside as he headed to the linen closet and snatched up a couple of washcloths. He warmed one with heated water from the tap, glancing up into the mirror as he worked. His face was lit with a happy, content smile, all that earlier fear chased away. This was good, more than good.
"In here." He croaked, ducking out into the hall. Lestrade's concerned expression broke into one of relief.
Vivid blue eyes, bloodshot, and wide with fear met his. Eyes so like John’s, but filled with anxiety and misery. Sherlock starred into those fearful orbs in stunned fascination. Logic told him it wasn’t the same man. He’d left John sitting at home that morning, drinking his tea and eating beans on toast, as was his tendency. He had just returned from an all-night shift and the fog of exhaustion that usually accompanied him after a night at the A&E had hung heavy on his shoulder. The chance of him leaving the house before five was in the lower tenth percentile. Which meant the chance of John being here, in this state were even lower. Yet the similarities were striking.
“I’ve been injected with something,” John admitted aloud, sniffing his bloodied fingers. “It’s Azaperone probably.” Previous experience told him what the sharp, astringent scent usually meant.
The ferocity of August's strength left the detective momentarily stunned,  so that when the young man pulled him close he didn't voice a protest, and instead he was hit by the omega’s sickly scent. This close the smell of illness and infection was strong, though he was able to push those scents aside with the ease of a man who regularly played with pickled bodyparts. It was the utter lack of any other sent, though, that had Sherlock flinching back. Inhaling he took in a lungful of moldy air, nothing. None of the scent indicators of an omega lingered in August. In fact, the blond was a blank nothingness in the room. He had none of the bright sharp scents of an omega, or the soothing barely-there scent of a beta, even the powerful overwhelming alpha scent was strangely lacking. As far as Sherlock’s senses could see, the man did not exist.
In his ear the beta scoffed, “I will remind you, darling, I’m a bureaucrat, not a detective. I’m having the rabble do the hard work, the benefits of being in a … managerial position.” John breathes out a pained laugh through his nose. Relieved despite Mycroft’s joking tone, he knew the tall man could defend himself, but he didn’t think he could handle losing another person close to him at the moment.
Hailing a taxi was easier than he thought. He watched it pull up in dazed relief. “73823,” He muttered absently, the taxi number was a bright white on the black car, catching his drug hazed mind. He fell into the interior, the sound of the door dinging aggressively in his ears. He barely made it into the seat. In the process his phone slipped from his fingers, dropping to the floorboards of the vehicle and sliding underneath the driver-side seat. He barely noticed the loss, his mind was a has of drugs, his twisting vision making it even more difficult to think.
Mud squelched under his boots as he shifted, eyeing the monolithic brick building before him. He scowled miserably, a dark figure camouflaged behind an old greying Prius. He faced the back end of the warehouse and had yet to see the front but resolved to believe it wouldn't look much different. Boarded up windows, mysteriously stained concrete, and a general air of dereliction. Sherlock would give it a five-star rating as far as criminal headquarters went.
“I just got the notification. We are on our way.” Came Mycroft’s hasty response, his voice lined in worry. The fact that he had eyes on 221B Baker Street was hardly a surprise.
-What's up with those pesky stomach troubles? I'm sure we all know, just check out the tags, but I'm a writer dammit, it will all come in due time!
“Ta.” Sherlock yanked his hand free from the other man’s grasp. “Now come here, I have other things I want you to touch.” Reaching out with his good hand he wrapped it around John’s neck and yanked the other man onto his lap. John laughed loud and clear as he followed Sherlock’s demands and threw one leg over Sherlock’s hips so he straddled the alpha.
Stepping out into the hall he felt John’s eyes lingering on his bare backside as he headed to the linen closet and snatched up a couple of washcloths. He warmed one with heated water from the tap, glancing up into the mirror as he worked. His face was lit with a happy content smile, all that earlier fear chased away. This was good, more than good.
“Well, yes, baby steps. This is further progress than we have had in years. August Walker, he’s one of your acquisitions if you recall, is by far our closest success story thus far. He has minimal symptoms after secondary gender Sterilization, with only late onset of the virus itself. An unfortunate byproduct, but one my scientists are working to eliminate.”
"Not anymore." Sherlock felt inordinately pleased for Brody to have lost his seat, and he was growing to like this Colt chap, baddy or not he had some standards.
More dragging ensued, followed by a sharp pain as Sherlock's tailbone hit the hard ground. Jason's grunts and groans hid the sound of his pained, hissing, intake of breath. Beefy hands shoved and pushed him into a semi-upright position, until his back settled into the hardened nook, coat scrapping against the brick wall. He made sure to lull his head forward and hide his face behind rain-sodden locks.
John gave him a looked, “You decided to- doing all this- because someone who looks like me bit you?”
John didn’t realize he was screaming until Mycroft’s tall frame blocked off his view of the door. He found himself suddenly muscled away from the horrible sight until his back slammed into the wall behind him. He was barely aware enough to feel long, cold fingers latched around his throat and jerk his neck up, forcing his vision away from the bloody sight until he was starring up into storm blue eyes. Mycroft’s mouth was moving, but he couldn’t concentrate enough to hear through the pounding of his own heart and the sound of his own cries.
Mycroft sighed in relief, watching the grainy, black and white video as John practically flopped into the vehicle. The omega's legs gave out for a moment, and the only thing that kept him up was his death grip on the taxi hood and door.
“Yes, well, that was what Sherlock was for. He was gathering evidence, deducing where the victims were being held, keeping tabs on the enemy, so to speak.” Mycroft explained, “But they were remarkably clever in hiding their inner workings, thus the runaround. Whenever Sherlock had a lead, they just uprooted themselves and left. They have means and finances far greater than our normal lot. There was a loading dock that had scent memories of one of the missing people. So we waited and watched the dock for further activity.”
There was a scuffle to his left, followed by the sound of soft curses. It drew Sherlock's attention away from the warehouse and toward the noise. Dear old Donovan. Sitting tumbled on her bottom and looking just as rat-faced as always. She cast an apologetic expression at her coworkers, bending to tie her shoe to avoid the look of derision Sherlock threw her way. The woman had grown particularly skilled at that of recent. John must be rubbing off on her.
It went without being said that it also meant there was a huge chance that he was being watched by someone else other than just Mycroft. “We have arrived at Baker Street now. I want you to go to safe-house three, do you remember where that is?” John grunted into the phone in the affirmative, unable to get words past the aching swell of his throat.
Thinking rapidly he considered what Sherlock would say in such a situation. “Also, get a team out to that alley-way, call Lestrade in if you have too. Update him on the facts. I want anything that John left behind, I want that gun, if he left blood traces I want samples of it. If you can get any more camera footage, get it. Trace that cab number, see if we can find the owners.” All of those sounded like very Sherlock things to say, his brother would be proud, or maybe royally pissed, depending on his mood. Nodding his head he reached for the door and popped it open, stepping out into the early afternoon sun. Anthea passed him his umbrella and he murmured his thanks, taking the comforting object in hand.
For a moment his eyes caught on the queen bed. It was unmade, the maroon duvet tossed haphazardly down the side of the bed to pool on the floor. He’d been the one to leave it that way, after struggling out of bed all those months ago. The fact that the room was still a mess after all this time wasn’t a surprise. John hadn’t dared to clean up the room, and with it, the last moments that he and Sherlock had shared.
So focused on John and John alone, like he was something precious, important, and he knew he couldn’t give up. Sherlock loved him, and he loved Sherlock.  Neither of them had the chance to say so out loud, and John had to make sure they got that chance.
“24-year-old August Walker has been in a two month-long coma and is believed to be mentally unstable. If anyone has seen-” The droning background noise offered an oddly domestic background to what was a rather grim sight.
"Well...with the right motivation, sure. It's a survival tactic. Why?" John asked, his head tilting.
hazed the air, warm and wet and right. "God, I hate that part. Get us a washcloth, would you?" John pleaded, face blushing vivid red before he hid it with his arm. Sherlock wanted to protest; he rather liked the sight of his omega painted in his fluids but decided to save John from further embarrassment and just do as he was told, scrambling from the bed on legs that felt something like jelly from lack of blood flow.
A swath of chainlink fence surrounded the decrepit eyesore. The two of them had slipped in through a break in the fence that looked suspiciously like wire-cutters had made it. The fence explained one thing, why the authorities had not come to inspect the building on smell alone. The smell, while familiar, made him sick to his stomach. It lingered in the air, raw and real, and like a punch to the sinuses.
They kissed long and slow, exploring each other with tongues that tasted of brandy and hands that felt like fire on the skin, hot and achingly familiar, for all that they have never done this before. How many times had he imagined clutching his hands around the swell of John's arse? The press of his fingertips against dark nipples. The touch of his tongue against the omega's skin?
“Your omega, huh?” John chuckled past the swell of his arm, his breath hitching in his throat at the idea.
Instead, he took a calm step forward. "I won't hurt you. Can you tell me your name?" Slowly he walked towards the lone figure, hands up in an attempt to show he was no threat. The omega shuffled at the sound of his voice, squeezing himself tighter into the corner of the wall he hid against.
There was reason to want this whole thing finalized. These people were sanctioning human trafficking of the worst kind. Omegas. Dozens unaccounted for. The cases of the missing went back five years. Five whole years of evidence lost thanks to poor detective work and weak evidence.
Resisting the urge to shout into the phone at the imbecile, Sherlock brought up his recall of just hours before, with young Sebastian crumbled on the floor. Terrified. Every move he'd made had pulled at Sherlock's alpha instincts. But looking back now, Sherlock couldn't recall seeing anything wrong with him but a general layer of dust and ash. He'd been uninjured, terrified, certainly, but that could have been more for his safety at the hands of police than anything. It'd all been a ploy, a manipulation tactic used by Sebastian to try and get away with his crimes.
“One moment,” John whispered, putting aside the question in favor of unlatching the window and shoving up on the glass, knowing that Mycroft would catch sight of him any moment on one of his cameras.
"And! He shot me!" Sherlock shouted, jerking his hand up to glare at the evidence. "Where did he get a gun if he was a hostage?"
"Yeah, yeah, he's still in custody, undergoing tests. I'll get the lads to take him in. We'll figure the rest out in the morning." Lestrade agreed, already sounding distracted himself.
Anya was reluctant, but another twenty pounds in her pocket had her tossing her empty snack bag into a nearby bin, and before he knew it, she was urging him to follow her. “Fine, but you’re a goodie, so you ain’ gonna like i’.” She warned, dusting of the street dirt from her rump. John nodded expression grim to show the girl he was taking her seriously. His heartbeat kick into overdrive at the realization that he was finally getting some sort of confirmation to what Mycroft had told him. This was the first clue he’d had as to Sherlock’s whereabouts, and he clung to it like a man on a life-raft.
He had been sleeping on the couch instead, too uncomfortable staying in either bedroom, instead opting for the familiar comfort the sofa brought. It still smelled of Sherlock, and if it had gathered a few shirts and blankets that were similarly familiar, there was no one around to complain.
“Smell it?” Mycroft asked, his icy hand shaking John’s short frame. John nodded his head, clutching the lapels of the elder Holmes’ suit jacket. “He’s been hurt, but he took down whoever did it.” The ginger explained still in that hushed, calming pitch, his tone taking on a note of grim approval. “This must be where they found him. He followed the dockworkers here from the loading docks. It looks like he was caught and got in a bit of a scuffle while attempting an escape.” The explanation seemed plausible enough, given the evidence in front of them.
They were on the second floor; there was no way he was getting out the fire-escape and down the ladder before the two men started firing. He’d be ripe for the firing squad of they made it to the stairwell before he got down. If dead was what they wanted, they’d accomplish it. Plus, there was no telling how many men were outside; he could step out on to the fire-escape and have a sniper shooting him through the head before he got a chance to blink. Dead again, not the option he was looking for.
"Sherlock, have you ever known me to be squeamish?" John asked, sounding close to being annoyed. Sherlock groaned, ducking his head.
Sherlock winced as John’s fingers brushed over the jagged bite mark on his hand, he looked down just as John caught sight of the injury. “What’s this? Did someone bite you?!” Sherlock eyed the reddened, infected looking skin, brow furrowing. Up until this moment he had completely forgotten about it.
“It was all very under the table. We got word that someone in high places is meddling in some dark business dealings,” Mycroft explained, his eyes going distant. “I put Sherlock on the case; I’m too high profile a face, and my people are well known in their circles. Our target would have jumped ship as soon as they realized we were on their tail.”
“Wha-your mad! I ain’t goin’ with you.” Eric Bates howled in protest, his voice turning meek and terrified. He had probably hoped to start a stay in the hospital, where his people would get a chance to break him out. They’d be more likely to just kill him, he was a liability at best.
“Mycroft, you still there?” John questioned one hand trailing along the brick wall of the 221 complex the other keeping his gun down at his side, but at the ready. Peering upwards he caught sight of one of the CCTV cameras, the relief at seeing it pointed in his direction almost palpable. Another thing to be thankful for, the ever pestering Mycroft and his constant spying.
"Fuck! Brody!" Colt's cursing showed he'd intended for that to be a warning shot. The now-deceased Brody had just gotten in the way.
Sherlock panted through that aching spasm of muscles, moaning along with John as they road through the pleasured spasms of John's channel. This time, it was gentler, no seed spilling from the omega's now flaccid erection, just biology attempting to ensure procreation as omega muscles clamped down around alpha knot.
This was beyond Lestrade's usual investigative scope, but, given the sheer numbers of law enforcement needed for the operation, and some minor strings pulled by Sherlock's smarmy brother, the detective inspector had been given the keys to the show, as it were.
John sighed drowsily, adjusting the pillow under his head into a more comfortable. “A little late for that Sher, but no, not really, feels good, full,” John admitted, voice dropping into a contented purr. Sherlock growled low in his throat at that, rocking his hips in a slow grind into the hot grasp of John’s channel. They both moan out loud as John’s channel tightened, milking around Sherlock’s cock with eager pulls of muscle. John’s fingers clutch around his biceps as he whimpers through the aftershocks. They both relish the shared moment, breathing in eachother's bodies in heady gasps.
John came with a sharp cry against Sherlock’s ear, seed spilling across his own belly, with it his scent exploding into vibrant hues. Sherlock watched the whole thing from hooded eyes, growling out his approval with animalistic ferocity.
The cabby mock bowed. “That’d be about right. Ain’t you scared?” He questioned, his American accent standing out in the London backdrop. He was grinning, a slow gleeful thing filled with malice. Oh, this one thrived on the fear, craved it, a sadist than.
"I'm keeping a volatile alpha, with no sense of self-preservation out of a very dangerous situation with vulnerable omegas." Lestrade snapped. "The fact that John's not here doesn't make me any more comfortable with letting you take point." He gave Sherlock a shove, his fist winding into the soggy wool of Sherlock's collar before he pushed the alpha towards Donovan, "Stay here. We'll call you in when the situation has been handled." And then louder. "Move in everybody. On my count. Ten....nine...eight..."
Blue like John's eyes. Blue like the desperate light in the eyes of a young omega broken and abandoned in a derelict building. Blue like the flash of an ambulance's light across pale, distraught features.
Standing far enough away for his scent not to alarm the omegas, Sherlock watched them being evacuated, forcing himself not to appear too brooding. Ambulances lined the streets, lights flashing, sending sprawling glints of blue across the greying brick and over the haunted faces of the omegas. The sound of omega wails was heartwrenching in itself. Soft keening calls for help that pulled at all of his instincts. He resisted their call. The betas had it well in hand. They were made for comforting, and most were trained for how to handle situations like this.
“John.” The beta's lips pursed into a thin line as he glared down his nose at the shorter man. Those grim, sharp, eyes took in the street behind John's frame, glancing furtively first left, then right, before he returned his gaze to John's with a put upon sigh. “Alright then, come in before you go rousing Mrs. Lewis.” He commanded, pushing his door open wider and taking a step back to allow John entry. John took the offer, slipping past the other man and into the entryway with only a cursory glance at the lavish decorations. He had the presence of mind to scuff his shoes against the entryway carpet, unable to put aside his mother's manners. Adjusting the waist of his jumper where it had rucked up, he turned back to Mycroft, waiting for the other man to finish setting the locks before being lead to a green-toned parlor. John glanced around at the unfamiliar territory, scowling at the hung artwork and grandiose decorations. Mycroft had none of his brother’s wayward style. Everything was too proper. To in its place. He should have double-checked his shoes at the door; he was probably tracking all of London across Mycroft’s thousand-dollar wool rug.
Spreading the swell of John’s thighs he settled onto his belly and took his omega into his mouth, growling his approval as John thrust upwards and sought out the warm heat of Sherlock’s mouth eagerly. The omega fit beautifully in his throat as he swallowed him down to the base, working his lips and tongue around the steel core of the other man.
The sight had Sherlock’s heart racing with a combination of unrequited desire and utter terror. It settled for the latter, he felt himself pale and quickly had to look away from those succulent lips, before his damn brain shut down entirely. If only he didn’t choose to turn his eyes up, pale eyes making contact with blue ones and locking there.
He did so hate giving police reports, but give them he did, with enough whining on Lestrade's part. Needless to say, it had been tedious and terribly dull, doting his I's and crossing his T's. Unfortunately, absolutely none of it had distracted his mind from the horrible sight
“W-well-shite,” John stuttered breathlessly, his eyes turning up to the ceiling as he attempted to think past the moment, his words breaking as he thrust up against the pressure of Sherlock’s palm. “You can blame it on yourself, you beast- God Sherlock, if you tease me anymore I swear I’m going to come in my pants.” John croaked, shifting off his elbows so he could squirm his trouser’s off his hips, kicking them to the side with an impatient shake of his foot.
"Ain't much without your bulldog, are you?" She snarked, always had to try and get a jab in. John would be highly amused at being called a bulldog, though. Ugh, he was getting a migraine. This really wasn't how things were supposed to go!
"Lestrade?!" Sherlock sputtered, jerking as if stung. "What are you doing, you imbecile." He snarled, glancing between the nearly invisible silhouette of Donovan and Lestrade. This was not how he'd planned things going.
A crackle of feedback jolted through their headpieces, and they both went silent, waiting for whoever was on the other line. Lestrade's grey eyebrows scrunched down into a tight knot of concentration, his hand shifted up to press the receiver against his ear as if that would make it easier for him to hear through the storm.
His own line of thought was much the same. He had in the past attempted to tell John his feelings, three times now, to be exact. Three times he had worked up the courage to tell John exactly what his heart said, and three times he’d shoved those damned emotions down deep, like the ridiculous drivel that they were. Useless emotions that muddle up the work.
Isn’t Sherlock adorably poetic? Everything he thinks is for John and about John. He’s so internalized that I think writing some of these scenes from John’s perspective might have made him seem cold because he’s one heavy thinker. I don’t want him to be cold, inside Sherlock is a fire, he just doesn’t quite know how to express it out loud. John is probably one of the few who can see that deep, who gets exactly what’s going on in Sherlock’s thick skull.
The sound of Colt's gun going off was followed by red hot pain shooting up his leg. Sherlock's leg buckled, and he cried out as bone crumbled from the blast, his femur and tibia going down in that order as first one, then the other met with relentless steel flying at high velocity.
“Oh, thank fuck…” John chocked in relief, his adam’s apple bobbing against the swell of Mycroft’s palm.
The sight had Sherlock's heart racing with a combination of unrequited desire and utter terror. It settled for the latter. He felt himself pale and quickly had to look away from those succulent lips before his damn brain shut down entirely. Jerking his eyes up away from the flash of bright white teeth, he turned his gaze upward until his pale eyes connected with bright, inquisitive eyes.
Sherlock had a brief moment to get a peek at his new prison before he had to close his eyes. It was enough of a glimpse to take note of the two betas that were to be his guards, as well as the general layout of this new location. A desk took up the bulk of the space, littered haphazardly with pens and papers and other tools of the desk trade. It was an expensive monstrosity, that would probably take a team of four to move. Whoever the owner was, they were showing off their status.
Welcome to the real feels of this fic. Things are going to get desperate and uncomfortable from here out. John is a literal mess at the moment. I wanted to write him with a bit of raw grief, because our boy is not afraid to feel, though feeling around Mycroft? That might be a different story. Sherlock has been missing for 3 months, and I'm sure you're all thinking that's a freaking long time for John to have sat around doing nothing. Not the case, I'm sure he's been trying his hardest to find Sherlock, it's just he hasn't had the information to go off of to even start. We can blame Mycroft for that, he's a bit of a secretive asshole.
Sherlock reassured himself, pushing that thought from his head before it overwhelmed him. He couldn't let his mind turn to such dark thoughts, not and stay functional enough to get free. He needed to get this over with so he could…well. His options were limited. First, he would need to be tested; Mycroft could help him there. All of these were troubles for the future. Lock them up and focused on the
He made it only a few steps away before a sharp jab of pain at the back of his neck jolted down his spine and had him crying out in pain and jerking around to face the source of it. The tourist, or whatever the hell he was, backed away slowly, arms up in the air, trying to appear nonthreatening. The glimpse of something metal in his palm was testament enough against that.
"He'll be getting a shot in the head if he's infected, so best get on with it," Colt ordered from his place by the medic's bag, his hands dripping with hand-sanitizer.
"Also, fever and chills, if you must know. And, a couple of bullets to the leg, could that be a symptom?" Tabitha was unenthused by his wit, her rheumy eyes glowering down at him. She was so career-oriented he couldn't even scent what her secondary designation would be, and she smelled of nothing but nitrile gloves, vitamins, and antiseptic.
“What?!” He snaps into the phone, rolling his eyes at John by way of an apology for the interruption. John groans at the sound of Mycroft’s voice on the other side of the line.
“And this as well.” John glanced up and watched, slightly dismayed, as Mycroft took hold of a tangerine from the basket and set to cutting it.  His fingers gripped the knife and sliced into the orange flesh, breaking it down into quarter slices. He worked with delicate assurance, laying the slices out across an extra tea plate one by one.
Sherlock waited, impatient, for Lestrade to make the call, for the rest of their team to get a move on. The earpiece was a humming litany of voices, giving their positions, taking up places to surround the building.
“Mmm… if ever there was a time to compliment you, it’d be now, darling.” John can’t help but respond, his words turning into a sharp yelp as the fresh morning air slapped against his skin.
John swallowed hard, his Adam's-apple bobbing against the sharp constraint of Mycroft’s palm. “No, no, we don’t.” He managed, sagging against Mycroft's taller form and accepting the strength he offered, if only for a moment. The fact that he could even be comforted at all by Mycroft's presence was unanticipated.
It did not stop him from feeling rightfully pissed off as he settled into the back seat of a cab and reached into his pocket, taking out his phone and dialing.
“Look at you like what?” Sherlock questioned, not bothering to feel offended, instead just following John’s orders and, dropping down to wrap himself around the omega in a warm tangle of limbs.
The sound of the gun cocking echoed in the icy air. Sherlock didn't have but a moment to react, jerking back as the trigger was pulled. A sharp lance of pain jolted from his hand, the graze of the bullet to close for comfort as it slammed into the wall with a puff of dust. Sherlock jerked back behind the door, dropping into a crouch and cursing under his breath. Inside he could hear the omega scrambling around, looking for a way out perhaps.
“-ocus John, Focus!” The older Holmes’ normally monotone voice was sharp and commanding, breaking through John’s panic. The hand at his neck squeezed down, anchoring John to that moment in time just as an alphas would. Sherlock rarely needed to use his alpha dominance to comfort John, but when he did, it was like a soothing balm, easing the edges off of horrible situations and dragging John down to a calmer mind space. Whatever Mycroft was doing, it was close enough to the real thing to leave John feeling grounded just by the placebo effect.
Quick change of plan. Sherlock saw the glint of a gun at Brody's side and yanked it from his holster with deft fingers, spinning to face Colt and only barely managing to stay on his feet through a wave of vertigo. Colt's scowling features met his own, his gun leveled at Sherlock.
John cringed at the sound of defeat in Mycroft’s voice. The lack of hope weighed on John for a moment. How could he give up on someone so important to him? Sherlock was the backbone of their ragtag group, the buzzing center to everything they were. For John, envisioning a future without Sherlock was like thinking of a world without air. Suddenly, he couldn’t breathe at the mere thought, his lungs seizing in a panic that had stars racing across his vision. Swaying in his seat, his heart raced with the utter fear of losing Sherlock for good.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in return and watched as John hopped off the table on a fighter’s light feet, his cock bouncing in the sling of his briefs. “Sounds only proper.” Sherlock followed him into a standing position and reached out, tugging John into a kiss before he could turn away. John sighed in appreciation, moving in close, his fingers deftly unbuttoned Sherlock’s plum-colored top and then preceded to yank it free from the waistband of his trousers. Sherlock sucked in a breath as his skin hit cool air. John’s murmur of approval hitting low in his belly as the older man stepped back and admired his handiwork, one palm reaching up to caress Sherlock’s nipple and down the length of his belly, hot and warm. A brand to the skin, a claim directly from John's hand.
Spreading the swell of John's thighs, Sherlock settled onto his belly and took his omega into his lips, growling his approval as John thrust upwards and sought out the warm heat of Sherlock's mouth. The omega fit beautifully in his throat. Sherlock swallowed him down to the base, working his lips and tongue around the steel core of the other man, before easing into a slow, steady rhythm, lips pursed around the turgid flesh as he sucked John off.
“Get a taxi John, get a taxi and I’ll meet you at the safe-house,” Mycroft’s was grim, sharp and commanding. It helped, breaking through that fogged, sickening sensation that came along with someone violating him in such away. “I’ll carry you up the steps myself.”
When his feet hit the asphalt the relief was palpable, he didn’t like being a sitting duck, up in the air with nowhere to go or hide from stray bullets. He’d never been so grateful for a London back alley that smelled of rotten refuse before.
"Alright, easy." Sherlock's breath caught as he used his already slick dampened fingers to drag down his own cock, coating it with John's fluids before he lined his aching sex up with John's entrance and pressed past the first rim of muscle. The omega beneath him rocked, heels digging into Sherlock's hip bones and urging him forward. Sherlock was never one to deny John and certainly wasn't looking to do so now.
"How smart can he be if Jacob took a one-up on him, hmm?" There was the sound of his phone vibrating, followed by the tap-tap of fingers flying on glass. Sherlock opened his eyes enough to peak and watch as Brody strolled away from him. Shoved into the corner behind the desk as he was, he could no longer see the armchair over the bulk of it, so Colt was an unknown. Brody was standing though, his red hair standing out against the backdrop of dark grey brick. His back faced Sherlock as he chatted with Colt.
But, oh how the plot thickens! I promised dear Sherlock wouldn't become a zombie, and now we know why!
“It’s been month’s Mycroft. Three, fucking, months!” John shouted, interrupting Mycroft with a slash of his hand through the air. He dared not take a seat. Instead, he resorted to pacing the space in front of the fireplace mantel in tight circles.
“Take me to-” He listened to John’s rapid inhale of breath as he realized what was happening, “Oh…bloody hell, it’s you,” He listened with dimming hope to the sound of the car locks activating even as John went silent, only the sound of the vehicle’s engine breaking the silence.
When the man struck Sherlock didn’t get the chance to react. One moment the rotund man was standing quietly, still holding out that "something" in his hand. The next, faster than any man if his size should be capable of, he shifted forward into Sherlock’s space, his hand coming up and slamming something hard against the pale column of Sherlock's throat. Sherlock choked at the familiar feeling of a needle piercing the flesh of his carotid artery, followed by the icy cold song of unfamiliar chemicals whipping into his bloodstream.
Underneath all the desperate need he was expecting John to jerk away, or maybe to go still in his arms, stunned. What he didn’t expect was for fingers to fist into the locks of his hair and yank him down further bowing his shoulders until he was enveloping John’s more compact frame with his own. The move was just as desperate and had all of the need that Sherlock felt.
“Hey! Stop right there, ya little fuckin’ shit.” John looked up, feeling resigned as a shadow blocked the doorway, the beta, Jermaine, stepped into the room, a nasty scowl twisting his face into a mask of anger.
"W-well-shite," John stuttered breathlessly, his eyes turning up to the ceiling as he attempted to think past the moment, his words breaking as he thrust up against the pressure of Sherlock's palm. "You can blame it on yourself, you beast- God Sherlock, if you tease me anymore, I swear I'm going to come in my pants." John croaked, shifting off his elbows so he could squirm his trousers off his hips, kicking them to the side with an impatient shake of his foot.
John is my favorite character, because he is a bit of everything. Strong, good-hearted, modest, quick to anger. So many options really. I’m playing around with his more brutal side in this fic, but I also just want to let him shine as a caring person. There are little moments with Mycroft that still are bringing out that kind John we love. This is also our first real introduction into what exactly Mycroft does, are you excited? I am! It leaves on a bit of a sour note, our poor omega has been kidnapped. Suffice to say John needs some hugs.  The next chapter is going to be from Mycroft’s perspective. Our plot is finally building and we are going to get some of those questions answered that we’ve been asking!
This location contained only useless odds and ends spewed across the floor, left behind from the previous occupants in their hast to leave. None of it would be relevant, though he thought he would do a more thorough examination in the morning, when the sun shone high and the sky and allowed more light in.
, this was John, John crying in need. It did not help that he had never actually heard John make such a sound before. That John was resilient, and self-reliant, and would more than likely call him a twit for even trying to step in as an alpha would. His damned mind wad playing tricks on him, replacing the young man with someone much old and so much more dear.
"Brilliant!" Leaning across the space between them, Sherlock captured John's lips, kissing him. "You brilliant, brilliant omega. I'll be back."
"Why would I do that? You handled yourself well enough." John declined, taking the stairs up to his room. The other man seemed to know all the weak spots on the steps and always avoided them. He did hear the upstairs door creak open and quiet rummaging. John returned holding a first aid kit, tossing it at Sherlock with a careless movement that still somehow showed off how easy it was for him to aim the thing.
people? Puzzling over the conundrum he made his way down the pier, his cab was waiting around the corner, the cabby number 73823, telling him that is was the same alpha he’d paid a ride from earlier. He’d bribed the man an extra fifty euro’s to stick around and be discrete, with the promise of more if he was there when he came back.
"Right, well, he's got maybe an hour than before this one wears off." Came Jason's disappointed response. There was the sound of receding footsteps, followed by the door closing.
It was all the distraction John needed. John was used to fighting dirty, thrived on it the same way that Sherlock did. Unlike some others, he had never been under the impression that omegas were the gentler sex. He had no issue taking on one of his gender; omegas could be just as aggressive in a fight as either of the other secondary genders.
John enveloped him with slick warmth, and they moaned in tandem as Sherlock eased inside with one slow thrust. John took him in with a welcoming flood of slick and twitching muscles. Sherlock watched John’s pupils blow wide with pleasure, felt the hitch of his breath as he bottomed out deep inside the omega. Sherlock’s own breath stuttered in his lungs and he closed his eyes, rocking his forehead against John’s as he paused and just
"Being John's friend is better than not having John at all," Sherlock spoke to the ornate old-style lamps that lined the peer, to the inky blue river that taunted him. Dragging in a slow, deep breath, he filled his lungs with the chilled night air and slowly exhaled, pushing down the panic and fear seeing Sebastian had brought to the surface. "Being John's friend is better than not having John at all," He repeated, the words painful but true.
Sherlock felt hands drag through the tangled, wet locks of his hair, and had the presence of mind to close his eyes fully, letting his jaw sag in a spot-on imitation of drug-induced lethargy. His head is yanked up, hair pulling painfully from the weight of it. He could feel the other man’s eyes on his face, examining him with a critical eye.
What had they just done? Would it last? Could they make this new thing work? Change was terrifying. What's more, neither of them was very good at it. He couldn't recall the last time he'd seen John buy something new at the grocery. It was always the same staples, picked with exacting precision. He himself struggled even to go into a new restaurant, and they had the same five takeout menus for the last four years. Unchanging. Maybe unchangeable?
anything. This being kept in the dark was not working. All he could do was dwell and dwell on the fact the Sherlock wasn't there. He wasn't a detective, he'd learned that very quickly in the months following Sherlock's disappearance. His own search had turned up nothing. Mostly because he had nothing to go by.
“Take me to-” John stuttered to a stop as he looked up into the rear-view mirror and met the seedy brown eyes and a familiar balding features of the man from earlier. The man who had injected him. “Oh…bloody hell, it’s you.” The grinning leer he received in return was tinged with blood from where his lip had split in their earlier scuffle. Barely able to think through the encroaching darkness John weakly moved to grab the doorknob, yanking at it just as the locks on the doors clicked closed with a sharp finality.
John let out a watery snort, taking a moment to wipe his face with his sleeve. He could barely get his hand into the space between them but dared not ask Mycroft to move, not when he felt so damn unstable. “That’s a bit of a scuffle? Somebody is dead.”
Vivid blue eyes, bloodshot and wide with alarm, met his—eyes so like John's, but filled with anxiety and misery. Sherlock stared into those fearful orbs in stunned fascination. Logic told him it wasn't the same man. He'd left John sitting at home that morning, drinking his tea and eating beans on toast, as was his tendency.
Turning on his heel, John leveled a scowl at the elder Holmes, “Yeah, well, how about next time you both try not to keep secrets from me, and I’ll do my best not to drag your bloody cases down.” He snapped, squeezing the grip to his gun to stop himself from snapping at the other man in a more physical way.
His eyes flickered between the heavy man and the cab then down to the syringe (it had to be a syringe) in his hand. Piece’s of the puzzle began to fall into place, and he narrowed his eyes.
“You promised a tenner too.” She groused from around a mouthful of crumbs, holding up one grubby hand. John chuckled and crouched down beside her. The waist of his khakis digging into his belly thanks to the new position.
Despite his protests, Sherlock had to agree to the sentiment. He was beginning to feel like this was their last chance. These people were good, highly skilled. Up to this point, tracking them down had been hell. Every clue he found as to their whereabouts had proved useless. Like mist, they disappeared. Leaving behind only the barest traces of their existence. This was, as John would put it, a bit not good. Every day Sherlock went without a break in the blighted case more and more innocent women and men were harmed.
The omega laughed at that, sufficiently distracted, shaking his head to clear it. “You carrying me? How mundane Mycroft.”
The first thing that hit him was a rushing wave of scent that was almost overwhelming in its veracity. The familiar smell of petrichor and electricity mixed with painful peppercorn tones and a sharp, fearful zing of lemon that had John flinching back. Layered on top of it all was the horrible, rich scent of iron.
Through the ringing of the gunshot in his ears, John could hear the omega yelling obscenities behind him. Struggling to his feet, John turned around in time to catch sight of the omega forcing himself to stand, a switchblade in his palm. Seeing the threat, John didn’t even think. Switching to his less dominant left hand, he raised the gun and with a sharp
Flicking the button on his torchlight to better see, Sherlock was hit with a wave of smells as he walked deeper into the building, where the air was still and the scents undiluted. Moldy, pale wallpaper sagged from the walls, lending the air of decaying flesh to the building.
The medic ignored them, settling by his side and snapping on a set of gloves before she went to packing the wounds on his legs. Sherlock kept his face covered with one hand filtering the painful light through his fingers.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart.” He reached out and squeezed her small hand. She leaned against him for a moment, probably finding his omega scent comforting. He was more than willing to let her, knowing that for most children, and even many adults, the scent of a kind omega could have a calming effect. It was one of the small things that made him a better doctor, and he was used to using it to his benefit. He could only assume that Anya had happened to see the traffickers in action. John had to wonder why they were transferring the children? Had something happened to make them abandon their location, and where were they transferring them? Too many questions and he had the answer to none of them. It did tell him one thing, this human trafficking business was real. “Do you remember where it was?” He questioned, hating to ask, and put the girl in danger, but needing to know. His anger simmered in the back of his mind. It disgusted him that something so horrible was happening right under the noses of every English citizen.
. John paused in what he was doing, and Sherlock was certain that if he looked up he’d see the other man eyeing him with one brow raised, mouth twisted in a classic expression of contemplation.
"No," Despite his discomfort, Sherlock shook his head. "Look at him, Lestrade, really look at him," Sherlock ordered.
“What does that even mean?” John asked, stopping to round on Mycroft with a glare. “I regularly have to dispose of human heads from my refrigerator because of your barmy brother. How is this any different?”
"Besides, your probably more upset about the Keeper getting away, than almost being shot." John offered, a warm, soothing scent seeping from his pores.
“You’re back!” The words were called over John’s shoulder as the microwave binged. He didn’t bother looking up from his task, so he probably missed the look on Sherlock’s face as he got an eye-full of a healthy, uninjured John Watson. Sherlock tutted in greeting, unable to get much else out past the swell in his throat. Depositing his shoes at the door and his coat on the rack calmed some of that jittery feeling in his chest. Running a hand through his hair he turned back to the kitchen just as John turned around from the microwave.
In the end, he never had the chance to catch up with the mysterious man. He had stopped a block away from the warehouse, slightly out of breath and with a stitch in his side. Guided by instinct, he stopped to snap a photo of the man’s shoe treads where he had splashed through a grimy puddle of street sludge. It took only a moment to send the images off to Mycroft, though he could not be certain if it would be of any use to the other man.
The spill of alcohol against the broken, inflamed skin had Sherlock jerking away. “Dammit John, careful!” Sherlock snarled, baring his fangs in distaste. John’s lips lifted in response, showing off smaller fangs, not giving in to the dominance display in the least. Sherlock wanted to tongue at the barely-there canine’s, lick at the hard protrusions with his soft tongue. Instead he watched deft, latex covered fingers dab and squeeze and manipulate the folds of broken skin, baring through the ache until John seemed confident in a job well done. The omega ignored Sherlock’s protests, tutting under his breath as he slapped on some antibiotic cream and taped the whole lot up.
Sherlock tensed, his heartbeat eagerly racing with anticipation. This was his chance, possibly the only opportunity he had to get to get away. He waited for the sound of the door clicking closed, followed by that annoying beeping and the vibrations of Brody playing with his phone.
“August.” Came the soft reply to his question after a moment of consideration on the young man's part. Sherlock nodded his head in greeting just as he came up close enough to make out the finer details of the person before him. It was the hair that caught his attention first, once sunkissed, it now lies lanky and weighed down by sweat against his forehead. It was a dirty blond so close to the color of John’s that it made Sherlock flinch. He forced himself forward to bring the young man closer into the ray of the lamplight. This close the smell of infection had settled in a cloud around the man, the scent only got only stronger as Sherlock settled on his haunches beside him and reached out to gently tug down the arm that August hid behind.
“Tell me what you have found.” He commanded, slipping into the back seat and waiting for her to follow suit.
It takes another little bit for his knot to come down enough to disengage. Dragging a hand down the to press on the warm muscles of John’s belly he gently released them from each other. Both of them are oversensitive and hiss in unison at the aching pleasure of disconnection.
"Dammit." Sherlock cursed under his breath, watching with dismay as they moved out, dashing across the street and closing in on the dusky old building.
John shrugged, his face twisting with worry. “I need to know something, Mycroft. What job was he working on? He wouldn’t tell me, said it would upset me.” John admitted, starring down into the dregs of his teacup. “When he left, he didn’t tell me where he was going. We were supposed to meet up for lunch.” He closed his eyes at the memory of that last blur of Sherlock’s Belstaff before it disappeared around the door jam. He should have gone after the other man. Why did he have to listen to Sherlock's damn persuasive baritone? It had sounded like a fantastic idea, sleeping in and taking a bit of a rest after weeks of hard work. If he had just
If he thought about it long enough, it wasn’t even the idea of still having PTSD symptoms that stressed him out, more that Sherlock had taken notice of something he hadn’t been aware of, and hadn’t said anything about it. He didn’t like being the dirty secret that no one wanted to speak of. It irked him. What had Sherlock seen in him before he’d disappeared that made him think John wasn’t stable enough to handle this particular case?
Sherlock snorted, not in the mood to please, “Oh hardly, I find it all rather dull. In fact, I’m having a bit of daja vu, I swear I’ve worked a case like this before.”
“That would be the two incompetent idiots Shirley enjoys discussing?” Mycroft crossed his arms. Honestly, he was aware the two detectives were above par compared to the rest of New Scotland Yard, they did their job well. It was hardly their fault that anyone would look like an idiot next to his brother. That was not the point, Lestrade was one of the only men he could trust, he would prefer all evidence be handled by the alpha.
The omega crumbled to the floor, the knife falling to the ground as he focused on his blown-out knees. “Holy…fuck.” He gasped, too shocked to feel the pain yet.
Sebastian rubbed a shaking hand over his face, moaning. "They…they-I heard yelling and fighting. I was so scared! So I hid." He explained, too distressed to get much out through the chattering of his teeth.
The glare Mycroft leveled at him was heavy with disappointment. “Yes, well, what do you think Shirley would say if he saw you right about now? You’re bedraggled and thin. I imagine he’d be quite perturbed to see his mate in such a state.”

"Christ Sherlock, lie down and stop looking at me like that," John growled, opening one eye to glower up at Sherlock's features.
This close he could see the difference between August and John, a slightly rounder face, skin too pale, eyebrows too thin, younger by fifteen years at the least, body soft from a desk job. Along with that his skin was red-rimmed around his eyes, puffy and swollen from pain, or maybe tears. There were other differences too, differences of a medical nature. Large blue veins stood out at his neck and crept up his face, stark and standing out against pale skin. The open sores around his mouth and neck were the worst. Leaking putrid fluids in tones of green and pus yellow.
"Oh fuck, yes, please." John's head kicked back against the pillows, voice desperate as slick pooled from within him, welcoming the intrusion with ease. Sherlock let off of John's cock with a lurid pop, turning his head to bite at the swell of John's thigh, taking the skin into his mouth with a slow suckle even as he introduced another digit to John's tight body. Wet, choking heat enveloped his fingers, accepting the intrusion with the pull of muscles. Sherlock hummed his appreciation and twisted and worked his long finger in and out in slow thrusts. John arched into his ministrations, his tense belly rolling with each shift of his hips.
"Still was caught, and now boss man's going to extort that brother of his. Just wait and see! We'll be living it free in a week, none of this back alley bullshit." Brody took that moment to clear a space on the desk, shoving papers and pens aside. Sherlock closed his eyes before the other man noticed him watching, he heard the sound of papers rustling and a few odds and ends being disturbed. There was the distinct noise of something falling on the floor, followed by the sound of metal rolling against concrete.
Sherlock reached for the bottle of brandy on the nightstand on offered it to John, humming his approval as the omega took a moment to swallow down a gulp, lips pursing against the burn. His eyes were sex drunk without the additional alcohol and hazy with need. Sherlock could get used to this—John, bare, and undone, and so damn beautiful.
Sherlock closed his eyes, relishing the moment. A moment he honestly had never thought he would get to have. "To be honest, I am surprised we just did that," Sherlock admitted, running his hand through John's sweat-dampened locks in return. His fingers shook in the aftermath of their coming together, uncertainty coming back now that the heat of the moment had passed.
It is raining. Damp, icy drops falling from the sky in large dribbles that obscured the wooden planks of the dock and have the sky above blending into the River Thames below. The air is winter cold and the skin on his arms tense with goosebumps from it. Combined together it was all rather hideously dreadful, and had Sherlock feeling like a bedraggled alley cat. He scowled down at the docks below him, a dark figure camouflage against a large pylon beam. There is a high degree of certainty that the men below haven’t seen him, if only because they have their hands full at the moment. A line of fifteen men and women, take up most of Eddington’s men's attention. The rain helps too, most plebeians tend to ignore their surroundings when faced with physical discomfort.
A couple of short, blond hairs clung to the pillowcase. Sherlock picked one up and examined it with a critical eye. Pale blond, almost white. He couldn't recall seeing anyone with similar colored hair, neither among the captive nor captors.
John was just as eager to explore, his hands seeking out Sherlock’s skin, his lips tasting along Sherlock’s collarbone and across his pectorals. Murmuring his approval he sought out Sherlock’s sex, and Sherlock hissed as hands wrapped around his cock, and dragged down the length of him in a slow burn, his grip light like he was very much aware of the lack of lubricant.   John moaned in his ear, fingers tracing the tip of Sherlock's head, exploring the length of him with slow strokes and impatient fingers. Sherlock's breath hitched at the feel of flesh on his most intimate parts. He found himself muttering under his breath, whispered words of endearment and need.
“Hey!” John shouted, and he wasn’t even thinking as he gave chase, breaking free from Mycroft to launch himself down the hall.
Torch at his side, Sherlock peered from room to room, searching for something, anything. The first room was a restroom, complete with a shower and toilet. The water worked, as proved by a flush of the toilet with one gloved finger. Peeling back the shower curtain, Sherlock furrowed his brow at the warm, almost homey appearance.
"That was stupid." Colt snapped, jerking his head towards Brody's slumped body. His eyes held a glint of consideration and a small amount of respect as he looked over Sherlock with an appraising eye. "I did tell him not to let his guard down. Idiot." They chuckled in unison, and Sherlock raised an eyebrow in surprise.
John chuckled, his elbows slipped out from underneath him as he slumped bonelessly on the table. His chest rose and fell in rapid gasps. Breathing in a calming breath he seemed to consider the ceiling for a moment, “Not before you buy a lad a drink, right?” He lifted his head from the table and gave Sherlock a mischievous raise of his eyebrow. The pale length of his foot lifted up and shoved at Sherlock playfully, taking away any sting the words might have had.
Inside he caught the sound of footsteps approaching and heaved a sigh of relief, dragging a hand through his hair to ease the mess of it he had made. Greying blond locks fell in a disheveled mess around his head; he hardly cared, hadn’t had a haircut in months, and was not planning on getting one any time soon. Releasing sharp a exhale, he schooled his expression into a scowl as the door finally opened.
"Look at you like what?" Sherlock questioned, not bothering to feel offended, instead just following John's orders and dropping down to wrap himself around the omega in a warm tangle of limbs.
The sound of moans and cries had his mind struggling back from its drug-addled haze. The scent even more so, an overwhelming smog of fear and death mixed with malaise and infection. He struggled to open his eyes, squinting through the slits of his eyelids to get his bearings. He was being dragged through a narrow corridor, on either side of him were large glass…tanks? Sherlock blinked, attempting to get his eyes to focus, the flop of his curled hair hiding his questing eyes from view.
“Oh fuck, yes Sherlock, please.” John's head kicked back against the pillows, voice desperate as slick pooled from within him, welcoming the intrusion with ease. Sherlock let off of John’s cock with a lurid pop, turning his head to bite at the swell of John’s thigh, taking the skin into his mouth with a slow suckle even as he introduced another digit to John’s tight body. Wet, tight heat enveloped his fingers eagerly as he twisted and worked them in and out in slow thrusts. John arched into his ministrations, his belly tense rolling with each shift of his hips.
Hello Readers! This fic is currently in the process of being rewritten. It was my very first fic, and I've learned a lot since I started it. Rereading it, it doesn't quite meet the quality I want, and since I want to actually finish it, I'm going to start reposting it sometime soon with a revised link provided. Until then, it will continue to wallow in its unfinished state. BUT! It's not forgotten, I do plan on completing it, and I'm working on the revised storyline so that I can do just that.
John snorted into his teacup and tried not to choke to obscenely. “My god, Mycroft Holmes just told me a joke. I must be delusional.” John chuckled, the sound halfhearted at best. He reached for his other biscuit and nibbled on the edge. The second one went down just as well as the first. That was a relief. Feeling tolerablly comfortable, considering the company, he eased back in his chair, eyes staring into his cup of tea.
“Hmmm…a romantic friend?” John asked, bringing his tea to his lips and taking a large gulp. The look on Mycroft’s face was well worth the question as he dropped his drink from his lips and leveled John with a disbelieving look. “Oh come on, even an asexual like you can get their romance on, don’t tell me you haven’t thought about it,” John questioned, peeling an orange slice from the rind and popping it into his mouth. Sure, Mycroft was a bit of a nit and had a tendency to be a little bit bossy, but he was more than capable of love, as long as it didn't bore him.
“Eat the tangerine first,” Mycroft commanded with a scowl fit for a school teacher. John scowled back, not to set on being told what to do. He didn't appreciate being treated like he was some fussy teen. “And I bought them for… a friend,” Mycroft explained, tapping one blunt trimmed nail on the porcelain of his cup. John blinked, not sure how his storming into Mycroft’s home had devolved into the two of them having an actual, civil, conversation.
In his arms, Sebastian took up that aching Omega Wail. Sherlock cringed, his instincts urging him to
There was no room to over-think. To analyze how best to bring the two men down, he needed to act, and quickly, before his opportune moment was lost.
John reached out a hand, maybe waved it in an effort to gain Sherlock’s attention, his blunt fingertips flickering through the air. It attracted Sherlock’s attention, a moth to the metaphorical flame. That small, simple gesture, combined with the worry in John’s voice broke whatever resolve Sherlock had bolstered himself with on the ride home.
happen. What was the point of eliminating an entire subset now, unless the goal was to make everyone equal, everyone the same on some base level?
Eddington browsed through the photos. "Eh…looks a bit morbid with all the blood and such, but that'll do for a ransom shot." He declared. "You have Mycroft's number, I assume?"
She sighed, “It’s not what I’ve found. It’s what was sent to me.” Brow wrinkled with concern she flipped it over to face him. In high color detail on the screen was an unconscious John Watson. His skin was a lurid display of deep purple and harsh red. Around his neck Mycroft could see the outline of a choke line. The omega was a beaten and bruised remnant of what he looked like the day before. By John’s head was a note, written in jagged red marker on yellowing paper.
John rubbed his blood-streaked hand across his face, nodding his agreement as he moved to push himself away from the wall. His legs gave out before he made it a step, turning to treacherous rubber at the knees. The gun in his hand fell to the ground with a clatter. He grunted as he found himself flat on his ass, the world spinning. “Oh.”
“Listen, Mycroft, you either help me, or I will do it on my own until I get caught.” John snapped into the phone the moment it picked up. He was met with silence on the other line, then a soft, put upon sigh.
Sherlock peaked his eyes open again in time to see Brody hitch himself up onto the desk and sit on it. The sound of his boots on expensive oak had Sherlock's head pounding. Squinting his eyes against the ache, he turned his attention to what had fallen on the floor. There were a few leaves of paper and a business card of some type. They held little importance, though. His eyes lit on an expensive-looking pen that had fallen on the floor, now that could be useful. It was one of those ugly statement pieces, something owned to hoist one's status to others. Mycroft had one just like it, entitled prat that he was.
“I see you." Mycroft murmured, watching as John took swaying steps towards a black vehicle. "That's it, your doing very well John darling.” Mycroft hardly noticed when the endearment slipped past his lips, not that he could be certain if John heard him. If he had, John did not acknowledge the words.
"Sherlock?" John murmured, slow concern filling his eyes, causing the furrow of his brow to wrinkle as those lips of his turned down into the smallest of frowns. Stepping around the table, John draped himself against it with one hip cocked on the edge of the tabletop, his "good" leg taking all the weight while his other settled for kicking in the air. The table creaked under his weight but held steady.
"Calm down! I'm a detective, here to help!" He called out, staring at his hand, in disgust, before turning his attention to the doorway. A gasp of alarm came from within the room.
Sherlock thought as he deposited the bottle of brandy on the nightstand. A deep alpha growl of approval rumbled in his chest as John worked himself up to a full erection with a couple swipes of his palm, not even remotely self-conscious.
He let those words reiterate as a mantra in the forefront of his mind as he took his feet towards the Underground subway. It helped, it reminded him exactly why he hadn’t confessed up to this moment, reminded him that only an imbecile would throw away years of a solid platonic relationship for a twenty-five percent chance of something more.
John wrinkled his nose as their combined fluid’s spilled free and that blush on his chest turned even brighter. The smell of
"John Watson, you have quite the mouth on you like this." Sherlock grinned, biting the band to John's briefs, one hand supporting the arch of John's back, the other sliding against the rigid swell of his cock, seeking the outline of its shape, thick and hard to the touch beneath the fabric of his jeans.
Silence, then a soft put upon sigh. “Come along then. I have some tea and biscuits in the kitchen; we can talk over a cup.” He all but ordered the command sharp on his tongue, though it did not have the power of an Alpha behind it. He might have considered resisting, but somehow John found himself following behind the other man, breathing in slow timed inhales to try and ease the distress that had been unrelenting the last few months.
“So, how’d it go, any breaks in the case?” He questioned, popping a small morsel of something in his mouth as he spoke. His tongue darted out to lap at his thumb. Sherlock watched the small peak of pink flesh dip out of John’s lips before slipping back inside the hollow of his mouth.
Sherlock stood on the sidewalk outside an old and ugly bricked apartment building. His eyes scanned the boarded-up windows, examined with a critical eye the seams of mortar, the mildewed siding, and rotting shutters. All in all he would say the location was pretty on par with every other location he’d been to this week. Which was to say, it was run down, and one step away from being considered a hazard to society. Why it hadn't' been red-tagged and closed up was beyond him. The last time he had come across one of these buildings with running electricity had been weeks ago.
Mycroft cleared his throat, arching an eyebrow when he finally had John's attention. Shoving his hands into his pocket, John resisted the urge to reach out and rip that eyebrow right off his smarmy face.
Outside, the clatter of feet on the stairwell had Sherlock jerking his attention away from the omega.
Looking down at the moving figures below Sherlock found it a bit surprising that the lot of them were out in such force. Not once in his months of research had he actually found Eddington or his men in action. Were they getting more confident? There was evidence to point in that direction. First, there had been August, left behind in their haste to close up shop. Now, this? He considers it might be a matter of pressure. Pressure by him, pressure by Mycroft. Eddington is getting edgy, he is acting under duress and becoming sloppy in his attempts to cover his tracks.
Thanking Anya- who had outright refused to go into the building, but had lingered around to “Make sure you don’ do somfing stupid.”- he hailed a cab. Watching the girl disappear into the evenings darkening streets, he sighed and shook his head. He was getting nowhere by himself, and this only proved it. He could see the crime scene, but not the crime itself. He’d never had to try to interpret these things without Sherlock guiding him through it. He needed help, and he wasn’t about to let pride prevent him from finding the missing alpha.
Mycroft scowled at that, he preferred a crime scene to be properly vetted by himself and his crews, especially when his loved ones were involved. “Our people know to distract them until we are done resolving any issues?”
Mycroft settled into a settee with graceful ease, his ankles crossing and palms clasped together. The lower position put John only slightly at ease, his instincts raging at being in someone else's territory. His instincts had been doing that far too often recently. He could hardly leave the house now without his instincts shrieking at him to find his alpha, which was ridiculous. Mostly because he didn't fucking have one! John had always preferred being an unmatched omega. So this new discomfort was a damn mystery. Sherlock wasn't his alpha. They weren't bonded. The only label John could think of calling them was best friends and one time lovers.
“Like I’m one of your experiments or something. What part of my anatomy are you thinking 'bout right now?” John mumbled drowsily, humming happily and nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck, his legs and arms doing a good job of helping Sherlock tangle them together.
In his ear John let out a slow hiss of pain and surprise, finally answer Mycroft. “Fuck. Yeah, that hit an artery.” Mycroft shoved back his panic at Johns words. Emotion never promoted clear thinking, and he
Sherlock thought, pressing a large palm over his face. Digging at his eyes with thumb and forefinger, he tried to rub away the salty crust that had lingered on his lashes since he'd watched the ambulance crew take young Sebastian away.
“Can you tell me what happened to you?” Sherlock questioned, his lips pursed into a thin line. He hoped his distress wasn’t as obvious as he felt it was. Though he had never been able to hide his emotions the way Mycroft could, so they were probably written plain as day on his features.
This one took me a bit, why, you ask? Because it's over twice as long as all of my other chapters, oh my jesus! I hope you enjoyed the extra treat! I just couldn't think of a way to split it up!
Mycroft scoffed, the sound barely audible, but there. “You’ve been favoring your arm for the last three days. Yesterday you almost shot that poor chap in the back just for dropping a trashcan lid to loud. Today your limp is back, though you haven’t seemed to notice yet.”
“Mmm…most certainly, mine.” Sherlock purred after a moment of consideration, shifting to stretch his body out above Johns, his longer frame arched to accommodate John’s smaller stature.
Sherlock hopes so, he wanted this case to end, and soon. He’d been drawn from a warm bed and a very receptive, open John that morning. There was no denying he had places he would rather be at the moment. Sherlock felt a slow smile build upon his lips and ducked his head at the memory of their shared moments the night before. He chuckled under his breath as he thought of John, eager, and warm, and oh so pleased with himself by the end of it all.
"That's not the whole of it," Sherlock admitted, choosing to drop down on the bed and attempt to cozy up to John's side. "It would dampen the mood considerably."
John had told him once, tone warm and cheerful, the mirth in his eyes exposed by the crinkles of golden skin at the corners,
Mrs.Hudson’s telly was playing loud from her open door, the newscaster talking rapidly about a young man who had escaped St. Bartholomews without doctor authorization.
Colt paused above him, scowling for a moment before pulling out his phone and snapping a photo. The flash blared through Sherlock's retinas, and he groaned, moving his right hand to cover his eyes just as another flash split the room.
The next morning Mycroft was having none of it. He was a miserable scowling git from the moment he knocked on John’s door. “I’m a bureaucrat, you dunce, not a bloody crime scene detective,” he growled, the words leaving his mouth while he slipped past into the flat. They glared at each other over tea that John barely sipped than Mycroft brought out the half-opened sleeve of Digestives and laid them out on the table like a peace offering. “I’ll have you remember we are doing this against my advisement.” Mycroft reminded, his lips a thin line of annoyance as John grudgingly accepted a biscuit.
Tabitha stopped what she was doing to roll her eyes. "If you don't want him dead, it's probably best I finish the leg first." She snapped.
Mycroft is a tough nugget to write. I needed to give him all of the emotions, without any of the visible proof. He’s a study in masks really. Along with that I really wanted to give the poor man a purpose. We never really find out what he does exactly, he’s a shadow figure, who just sort of appears to solve or cause chaos. (I’ve never watched the last season, so perhaps my opinions aren’t complete) Either way, given the route this story is heading, he needs a bit more character. I’ve assigned him the “techy” guy position, but with more power and say so. I like the concept of him teaming up with our original duo sometime in the future, much like he did would John, and just helping them kick butt!
Mycroft settled into a chair across from him, taking his sweetened tea in hand, along with a biscuit. “Hmm, never did like ginger.” He admitted aloud, his large hand completely dwarfing the little teacup as he sipped and then bit into a biscuit in turn.
Most of the skilled ones were employed by Mycroft himself if only to keep the competition of the street and in his capable hands. Eddington was a notorious sneak though; it was more than likely he’d had access like this for years and had never been caught using it before. Typing in the access codes to a backdoor server Mycroft grunted his approval as the red indicator lights on the screen swapped to green.
“Oh yeah? Should I remind you I only have a sister?” John raised his eyebrow incredulously, his voice warm and playful. He was so different from August, features open and pain-free. The smile on the edges of his lips faded at the sad look in Sherlock’s eyes. “Bad than?” The omega questioned, reaching out and taking Sherlock’s hand in his own, squeezing Sherlock's fingers in a show of concern.
Mycroft sat up straighter as well, all business. “We had reason to suspect that they were dabbling in human trafficking, perhaps medical experimentation.” He explained.
“Yeah…yeah, we did good, huh?” John question, his cheeks staining a bright red. Reading between the lines Sherlock took that to mean something along the lines of:
Sherlock arched an eyebrow in return, a dark, sad look twisting his features as he shook his head. It was the same look John had been treated to the night before, moments before they'd taken this surprising next step in their relationship.
"Language John," Sherlock chuckled, watching those pupils expand, John's breath hitching beneath him as he slowly withdrew his fingers, leaving John gapping and open.
“Mycroft, you fat arse! I know you’re in there, open up, or I’m going to tear this fucking door down!” John shouted. The sound of John’s fist banging on the opulent wood of Mycroft Holmes town-home was loud enough to wake the neighbors, but John hardly noticed. He knocked and knocked until his knuckles began to hurt. John didn't care if he woke up the whole neighborhood, he was going to be heard, dammit! With a grimace of frustration, he took to kicking at the varnished wood with the toe of his loafers. His fingers clenched into tight fists at his sides.
“You’re definitely going to need a jab for that, it’s already pretty infected. Maybe stop by Bart’s tomorrow, Mike should be around.” John muttered absently, snapping his glove off.
"Jesus, thanks for reminding a man about his dry ovaries, and right after mind-blowing, life-altering sex too. That brain of yours never rests," John chuckled. He didn't seem to be upset, playful more than anything, and maybe a little bit amazed. Turning his head, the omega pressed a kiss to Sherlock's cheek, the gesture letting Sherlock know that John wasn't offended. It felt butterfly light against Sherlock's skin. His finger's carded through Sherlock's hair, dragging through tangled black locks.
He took the omega out at his knees, careful to angle his gun so the bullets would not rip through the floor and injure Mrs. Hudson below.
“John?! Mycroft has a break in the case!” His excitement is contagious, and John peers out from his pillows, a grin chasing the edge of his lips.
“Fuck off you fat toff. I ain’t tellin’ you shit, take my soul to the grave.” The omega shouted, his words devolving to nothing but vitriolic curses.
The heel of his foot dug into the curve of Sherlock’s shoulder blades when Sherlock slid the swell of his thumb into the entrance of John’s channel.
“You have a tail.” Mycroft’s voice warned, and John cursed. Now that Mycroft mentioned it he could hear the sound of footsteps racing after him. There was the sound of a gun going off, and a bullet ricocheted off the brick near John’s feet. A warning shot, most defiantly not intended to be lethal. Whoever these people were, they were looking to capture, not kill.
“Bloody hell….” John groaned in a rush as Sherlock filled him, his fingers spasmed where they clutched around the swell of Sherlock’s biceps, his voice breaking. Sherlock smiled, a lopsided sloppy thing, and just focused on giving John a moment to adjust, forcing back the need to pull out and thrust in harder. Opening his eyes he examined the lines and planes of John’s face, the blond didn’t seem to be in pain, Sherlock had taken care to properly prepare him. “You are
Less than fifteen minutes later, Sherlock trudged his way up the lit stairwell to their flat, his shoes gathered in one hand, his soggy greatcoat folded over the crook of his other arm. Stockinged feet picked their way silently up the stairs. The knob to their door was cool to the touch and opened with a drowsy creak.
From there everything had unraveled, a dark, dirty entanglement of medical experimentation and human trafficking. Or at least that is what Sherlock’s research had shown. The fact that Sherlock had up to this point, not found a single one of Eddington’s victims perhaps warranted the most concern. To his knowledge, no reports had surfaced mentioning botched kidnapping attempts. No families had come forward about their missing family members, because, for the most part Eddington took those people who wouldn’t be missed. The homeless and drug-addled, the ill and dying. Along with that an increase in unclaimed cadavers was never noted at the city morgue. If people knew, they weren’t talking or were dead and gone.
“What did he do, headbutt you?” Mycroft questioned, raising one russet brow. The glob of spittle aimed his way a moment later was answer enough. Raw pride lit up Mycroft’s belly at that, at least John had the chance to put up a fight. “Well, John is quite hard-headed, as you have seen, in all senses of the phrase.” The beta waved a hand, taking in the blooded and damaged remains of 221B.
“Bloody hell.” John croaked, almost dropping the phone of his shoulder. Mycroft made a questioning noise in his ear, no doubt wondering what John was doing.
"Nah, don't bother, boss will want him awake for the phone call," Brody interjected, followed by the low beta scent of lavender and shea butter as he moved in to look over Sherlock's prone form. "Right, Colt?"
Below he watched Eddington’s men direct their captives into an awaiting van. Which was...at odds with what he knew up to this felt. His brow furrowed in confusion as he looked between the dock and the van. Up to this point he and Mycroft had assumed that the captives where being transferred from the London area, evacuated out as Eddington closed up shop and moved to a different city. Presumably one with lower standards for human treatment and health practices. This was different, why were they bringing
"I'm never-" Sherlock choked as John shifted his hips beneath him, attempting to get comfortable. "-daft." John ignored him, instead lifting his head up for a kiss. Sherlock met his lips, sighing as he chased John's tongue into his mouth, lips dancing together with the damp tang of saliva. John gasped into his open mouth, spreading his legs wider to accommodate Sherlock's size and tilting his hips upwards. One leg moved to hook over Sherlock's shoulder again in a fascinating display of flexibility. Sherlock groaned his own approval as the new position eased him in deeper, the base of his cock pressing to John's tender skin. Sherlock settled his hands, one on John's hips the other on his leg to keep him supported where he wanted to be.
Humming his approval he stood up and closed the door behind him. Turning he made his way to Sherlock’s flat. Maeve fell in stride beside him, leading the way across the narrow street. The neighborhood was quiet, but for his men and the cop cars that were only just arriving on the scene. A paramedic stepped out of an ambulance, followed by two others in a similar uniform. One of Mycroft’s men, Cedric, stepped up to the group, holding both his arms in a hold gesture, one hand holding his badge.
“What was that?” Mycroft questioned, as if reading his mind, his voice clear through the speaker of John’s phone. John started, he had almost forgotten that the elder Holmes was on the other line.
The detective inspector turned his torch up to Sebastian's face, doing a double-take when he got a good look at the young omega's face.
Only when he thought he was well and truly alone did he drop his headlong rush. Breathing a sigh of relief he slowed down to catch his breath. He prided himself in his stamina, but for a man who had been leaning on a toilet and puking up his guts just an hour before, even this was above and beyond what he had the energy for.
John wrinkled his nose as their combined fluid's spilled free, and that blush on his chest turned even brighter. The smell of
Sherlock blinked, turning away from the mirror and heading back to the room with feet that slapped lightly against the wood floor. “I met your twin today.” He admitted as he stepped back into the room and handed the square of cloth over to John.
"You're definitely going to need a jab for that. It's already getting infected. Maybe stop by Bart's tomorrow. Mike should be around." John muttered absently, snapping his glove off.
“It’s intramuscular, mid-neck. I-shit-I have ten, maybe fifteen minutes before I’m out like a light. Unless it nicked one of my cervical arteries than it’s five minutes tops.” John struggled through the math. He knew from experience that tranquilizer darts were in no way as quick-acting as they showed in the movies, but there were too many factors to consider. If the needle hit an artery, and therefore, his bloodstream he’d be out in minutes. However, if it struck his muscle it would take longer to reach his bloodstream and take him down.
It all came down to the math in the end. His mind reminding him that if he said those three words aloud than there was at least a fifty percent chance that John would reject him. Take into account John’s general preference for alpha females, and his odds were closer to seventy-five percent chance of being rejected. If that were to happen Sherlock was certain it would ruin their friendship, there was no going back after a profession of love. It would stick in John’s mind and rip at Sherlock’s heart; poisoning their friendship and ruining the little slice of perfection that they had created together.
“Go on then,” He whispers, shoving at Sherlock until the lanky man gives in and rolls off of him. Rolling onto his belly, he drags the duvet back up to cover himself from the morning chill and burrows himself thoroughly into the pillows to block out the sound of the brother’s grousing at each other. He does not doubt that their lovely morning will be interrupted by Sherlock’s esteemed older brother. Sherlock had been chasing a case for the last several months, with very few leads and no physical evidence that even his brilliant mind could find. If Mycroft was calling, it was because there was finally some evidence to be found.
"Ta." Sherlock watched John's fingers fiddle with the box of bandages before he began wrapping Sherlock up. "How are you doing that?"
“I just woke up, John. It’s hardly the time.” Sherlock protested with a roll of his eyes, but he doesn’t seem to mind the compliment otherwise. Instead, moving to dig the bed covers out and away from where John had tucked them around himself during the night.
The omega was getting into a more populated section of the city, with people out in droves, making it a little easier for him to blend in with the crowd. Behind him John heard more shouting, glancing over his shoulder he groaned at the sight of a woman and two men turning onto his block. They hardly seem to care that their guns were out and exposed, ignoring any cries of fear as they passed, searching for John in the crowds.
"Hey, what's wrong? You look…sad." John asked, his voice concerned, his head cocked in the golden retriever-like way of his. Gorgeous, so damn gorgeous. Sherlock blinked, sufficiently distracted from the pale expanse of John's toes. Thinking about John's words, he supposed that was what the emotion was, sadness. Sadness over not having the one thing he truly ever craved. How could one miss somebody that was standing right in front of them?
"Oh god, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" Came a panicked gasp, followed by the clack of a gun hitting concrete. Sherlock's light caught the glint of metal as it slid into view. "Please. I thought you were them!"
John stalked forward and kicked the knife out of the man’s reach, disarming him with the precision of someone who had done it a dozen times. It took nothing to shove him over, rapidly searching through the omega’s pockets until he came up with a spare clip of bullets for the gun. He held no remorse for the injured man; the doctor in him pushed to the background of his mind by the Captain who was in full-blown survival mode.
“Mycroft.” John hissed the name through gritted teeth, trying to hold back the seething mess of anger and desperation from showing in his voice.
“Yes, well, it looks like you’ll be needing to head out, Mrs. Hudson!” John shouted back, voice broken and strained, peering out the windows. “Now would be a good a time as any!” Mrs. Hudson, having the good sense that she did, went silent. He listened to the sound of her keys jingling, and a moment later watched as she dashed out the front door, bee-lining to her vehicle. Bless her heart; she didn’t even attempt to take anything with her, ever practical.
John didn’t dare waste a moment, dropping the violin, he sent himself scrambling to one knee. The gun lie where he’d last seen it, strewn across the floor in their fight. He reached for it, the butt of the weapon slipping into his palm with a weighty heft that was comfortingly familiar.
“Message me, and we’ll meet for lunch!” He shouted, his request muffled by the sound of the door slamming closed and Sherlock’s retreating steps.
Settling in for the long haul, he was left with nothing but the annoying mutterings of Eddington's wayward buffoons and his thoughts. Worry laid itself heavy in his chest. Especially now, when his stillness took away any distractions, reminding him of his body's every ache and pain.
Sherlock growled a noise of appreciation, breaking into a run. The omega laughed, dashing down the hall, the sheet billowing out behind him like a flag.
"Come on then," John commanded, his cheeks flushed. Sherlock raised an eyebrow as John slipped past him and made a detour to the liquor cabinet to bring down a bottle of brandy, waving for Sherlock to follow with the three fingers that weren't gripping the bottle by the neck. Sherlock shook his head, laughing under his breath, but followed behind John anyway. "I'm not gonna have our first shag be on the kitchen table with Mrs. Hudson getting an earful downstairs."
Lestrade raised an eyebrow of his own. “That’s what I have detectives for.” He reminded, and Mycroft snorts under his breath, remembering when he had told John that same thing only a bit ago. “ Donovan and Anderson are there now.”
This close, he could see the difference between the young Sebastian and John. A slightly rounder face, skin too pale, eyebrows too thin, his junior by fifteen years at the least, body soft where John's held muscle. Sebastian's skin was red-rimmed around the eyes, puffy and swollen from pain, or maybe tears. There were other differences, too, differences of a medical nature. Dilated pupils, dehydrated, dry lips, and, under it all, the warm milk scent of pregnancy.
"Fuck!" Sherlock reached for his pen, yanking it from the base of Brody's throat and shoving him to the side with an arc of glistening red blood. The move sent Brody's body falling to the side. There was the sharp sound of a gunshot, and the man's head exploded in a shower of brain matter that blasted onto the ceiling and walls and across Sherlock's front.
an alpha.” John panted, biting his lower lip, the muscles of his neck distended as he dug his head back into the pillow. Sherlock snorted, he was well aware of his secondary gender.
Sherlock choked, jerking his head back to scowl at the omega, with disdainful eyes. “Do try not to bring my brother in the bedroom. But yes, I’m sure the very idea would confound him.” John laughed, deep in his belly.
“73823,” The words echoed through the phone lines as he watched a familiar stocky omega fumble with the handle of a taxi; those same numbers displayed in white vinyl on the back fender. The back of his jacket was stained with dark splotches of blood, as it had been earlier, confirming John’s identity.
They chased their combined pleasure higher and higher until John was groaning beneath him, one arm clenched into the swells of pillows above his head, abs a taut line of muscle as his other hand worked up and down his own shaft chasing that final release. Sherlock bowed his head between their bodies, watched the slide and peak of John's hand while he worked his hand just the way he liked it. The head of his cock peaked from within John's grasp, reddened and eager, and no doubt aching to the touch. The muscles surrounding Sherlock tensed, rippling around Sherlock's thick length.
Sherlock sighed as John abandoned his lips to mouth down the length of his neck, leaving a trail of hot kisses, punctuated by soft sounds as Sherlock took advantage of his spread legs to grind their cloth-covered sexes together. Sherlock’s mouth was tucked against the side of John’s head, tonguing lightly at the lobe of John’s ear, nose pressed to the scent gland just behind it.
John lay sprawled on the bed, completely nude and displayed in all his glory. He was nothing but well-used muscles and sun-kissed skin; he looked like a lured picture picked right from Sherlock's deepest fantasies. The omega's cock rested ruddy and heavy against his belly and bobbed slightly under the weight of Sherlock's gaze.
Depositing the hair into an evidence bag, Sherlock pocketed it. A desk sat to one side. It was empty, except for a few miscellaneous pens and an omega birth control pack with the last three months unused. These must be the guard's rooms.
- Take note as well of the difference again between omega and beta scents. I know I mentioned this last time, but there it is again!
“John, I’m going to lose visual. I am being been denied access to the cameras coming up.” Mycroft’s voice interrupted his headlong flight. The elder Holmes’ sounded troubled and frustrated. Which made sense, if someone was deliberately denying Mycroft access to CCTV it meant that the corruption they were trying to uncover went deeper than they had expected.
"Of course not." So he told John of his day. Sparing no detail, he described the ugly warehouse full of captive omega's, growing more and more aggravated. "So...he shot me. But that's not even the worst of it, John! We lost him. The Keeper was nowhere to be found. He was supposed to be there, dammit!" Sherlock snarled.
“They’re here.” He snapped into the microphone with clipped words, cutting off Mycroft’s greeting. His voice sounded rough and gritty to his ears, and it hurt to speak. He could already feel the bruising around his throat from were the omega had strangled him.
“Hey dude, do you know where-” The man, a tourist at best, an idiot with no sense of direction at worst, reached out to steady him, one hand reaching to grip John’s shoulder. Instinct hid him backing out of the man's reach.  John caught a glimpse of sweaty blond hair and a receding hairline. He was far to close for John’s liking, and moved in closer despite John's obvious distaste. John ducked to avoid further being touched, snarling a warning as he skirted around the man.
“Alright, that’s not going to work, best go to Tesco’s and get some tablets.” He groused, forcing himself upright. It’d been like this for weeks, his stomach rebelling at even the mention of food. Mycroft’s ginger digestives being the sole exemption so far. He was more than certain he had an ulcer at this point, brought on by the stress of losing Sherlock and the near-constant search for the other man. If he had the time he’d, head over to Bart’s and get Mike to give him a proper script, but there was too much to do, and not enough time to do it. So instead, he sucked it up, suffering through the bouts of nausea with nary a compliment.
He can see the difference between captors and captives just by the way they move. The captors are rough and aggressive, shoving and pushing, shouting indistinct orders to each other from across the way. Whereas the captives exhibit symptoms of illness and pain, swaying in line, no visible fight in them. The rain obscures their scents, but Sherlock imagines that if he was able to get closer he’d catch that same whiff of rot and decay that he’d smelled on August the day before. He has already concluded that they will lack the scent of their secondary gender, just like August had.
He thought to himself, feeling a grim sense of foreboding. In his hand the injection device the man had used gleamed. The thing looked like it came straight out of a crappy sci-fi film, all gleaming metal with a small glass window. It was some kind of quick-release injector, the needle, from what he could see, had popped into the syringe immediately after use, safely tucked inside thanks to whatever mechanism controlled that aspect. A quick peer inside showed a thick gauge needle, probably needed to administer the drug quickly. There was something sickening about thinking that someone had jabbed him with that needle without his permission. With the cloudy feeling of shock settling over him he dropped the injector to the ground, unable to hold something so fundamentally wrong.
John didn’t have time to see if the other man was out for the count. Instead he scrambled for the weapon, shoving off the omega to get to the gun. His eyes wavered towards the door. If the beta came up the stairs now, he was screwed. It took only that moment's distraction for his opponent to take advantage.
John's blue eyes looked him over, a soft sound of disgust leaving his lips. He sat up next to him, reaching for his hand once more. "Well, at least let me disinfect this," His lips pursed, eyes examining the wound with a practiced physician's eye. Sherlock rolled his eyes but didn't say anything as John slid out of bed. When the other man put on his doctor's face, there was no getting through to him. He was already out the door before Sherlock had a chance to protest. The tables were turned as Sherlock got a peek at sticky, love-bitten thighs. John wore the marks of his fingerprints on his hips with elegance. Sherlock eyed those marks, a smirk lighting up his eyes despite his significantly soured mood.
Sherlock sputtered, feeling very indignant indeed. Who in the bloody hell did Lestrade think he was talking to?
It took two strides to make it across the room and bring himself up into John’s space, taking the omega’s outstretched palm and tugging him close. His other hand slipped upward, sliding over the swell of John’s jaw to yank the blond’s head up so he could see John warm features, bright and stunning. He caught a glimpse of John’s eyes widening in shocked surprise before he was bending his taller form down and pressing their lips together in a desperate clash of teeth and soft warm lips.
The alpha seemed to confirm Sherlock's theory. He gave one deep body shudder as icy rain dribbled down his neck and flashed his hand to whoever was in the back of the lorry, giving the signal that the area was clear. The back door popped open, revealing two more men with dark, disinterested expressions. They shouted orders, jerking their weapons up the driveway towards the gated building.
Anya led him to a boarded-up apartment complex in Ratcliff. The East London building was abandoned, from everything John could see. He scented the air, but whatever scent-memories the building had once contained were long gone. If Anya had it right, then the building had been emptied at least a few weeks before Sherlock had come upon it. The building abandoned in mass. John could only assume that the network of abductors had taken their captives and run. What had spooked them, John couldn’t be sure, but there was a genuine possibility that Sherlock had been the one to scare the group off in the first place, he had been working the case for long before his abduction after all.
"This him? Doesn't look too tough to me." Brody chuckled, sizing up his foot to Sherlock's oxfords. "Nice shoes though, think the boss will let me have them?"
“Sherlock?” He watched as slow concern filled John’s eyes, causing the furrow of his brow to wrinkle. Watched as those lips of his turned down into the smallest of frowns. Stepping around the table John settled with one hip cocked against the edge of the tabletop, his “good” leg taking all the weight while his other settled for kicking in the air.
John looked well, whole and uninjured. There maybe was a slight slump to his shoulders, lingering exhaustion from a week's worth of long hours. He was favoring his arm again, but even that was soothing in its normalcy. The smell that permeated their flat was of comfortable, content omega. So different from the painful sharpened smell of Sebastian. It was a relief, so profound that it felt like the floor was falling out from under him. After the horrible day he'd had, the knowledge finally let him take a deep breath through lungs he hadn't been aware were tight with worry.
"Put 'em in the corner." Came Colt's put upon response from in front of the desk, the man's voice gravelly and smoke hardened.
“Tell me when your ready John.” Sherlock purred as he adjusted fingers in the blond until he was rubbing that sweet spot that had John shouting and tensing beneath him. Thinking critically he set to spreading John with a third finger, until the omega was open, wet, and eager.
Thinking back further, to that bedroom, with its comfortable bedding and the compact of half unused tablet—one tab for every month. The last tablet was used two months before.
Slowly John lowered his still warm weapon from his position crouched on the floor of his flat. It had been expedient, and he had used it to his advantage, lifting the gun and pulling the trigger before the man had a chance to realize what was coming.  He hadn’t even needed to cock it, the bullet flying free with little more than a press of the trigger. Experienced marksmen that he was, he did not dare to take his eyes off the man’s still standing corpse. He watched with unwavering eyes as the beta swayed, blood leaking from the hole in the center of his head and dripping down his cheeks like tears. His corpse stumbled, still receiving those last signals from the brain, before his knees buckled, sending his body falling backward and tumbling down the landing with a heavy thump.
"Ah…" The sound slipped out past John's soft lips, a deep hum of understanding. "I forget how you alpha's are sometimes," John admitted, dropping the cloth to the table. Sherlock felt the bed dip and sighed as John kneeled beside him, wrapping strong arms around his shoulders and dragging Sherlock in for a tight embrace against his bare chest. More sweet, calming omega scent seeped into the air. He felt the worries of the day ease away.
The bandage John had applied was already peeling off, hanging only by one strand of surgical tape, exposing the reddened and torn skin of his hand, and the distinct outline of teeth standing out on the surface. Peering from under half-closed lids, he considered that bit of flesh, examined it with concern. There were no visible sores, no puss, or scent of atrophy. His sharp nose would catch even the first scents of rot.
“Sugar?” Was Mycroft’s only response as he took up the teapot and emptied its belly into the matching cups. John shook his head, accepting cream and sighing in relief when he caught the familiar floral scent of black tea and not another one of the unusual concoctions Mycroft sometimes favored. His stomach rolled at the idea of one of those fruity mixtures, and he had to breathe through his mouth for a moment to calm his gag reflex. A couple of ginger digestives made their way onto the side of his saucer, and he eyed them dubiously before mumbling a thank you (his mother’s manners making themselves known again) and pulling the little plate closer until it sat comfortably in front of him.
John’s ego had twinged a bit at that. “You are aware I’m a highly trained doctor and a war veteran?” He’d responded, more than a little miffed that the other man thought so lowly of him. Mycroft wasn't interested in listening though, and John found himself leaving Mycroft's abode without the other man's backing.
The smell of lavender grew stronger as the younger of the two beta's moved in close, kicking at his shoe.
Pulling his phone from his pocket he unlocked it and brought up his most recent text from John. It was a well-focused picture of a shoeprint, with a quarter from John’s pocket dropped for size comparison. The photograph had been taken only the day before when they had been interrupted at the warehouses.
A single window lit up the room with the bright afternoon sun, showing every gory detail. Blood, blood was everywhere, coating the ceiling in sharp lines of rust red, and then leaking in drips onto the office desk below it. He could see large swaths of it puddled on the floor, collecting in the hollows of the concrete. Papers and various office supplies scattered across the floor in utter chaos. There, in the center of it all was a hideously noticeable drag mark, the shape of it long and thin. He thought he saw the impression of curls marring the bloody surface right where ahead would have landed.
"Oh, a day or so." Sherlock moaned out. Why was he answering her questions? Was he the idiot, ugh, he was the idiot, wasn't he? Driven to stupidity by fever and a couple of gunshot wounds.
Standing up from his crouched position beside the omega, John sprinted to the window. It was a moment's work to peak out the glass, checking for any suspicious activity. The street outside his flat was clear of everything but debris.  At the sight of the empty street, he allowed himself a moment his body bowed down, bent with sheer exhaustion. Clutching his aching side with his free hand, he drew in ragged breaths past his swelling trachea.
Dread settled into Mycroft’s belly like a twisting serpent, heavy and poisonous. There was no way to communicate with John what he had just seen. The phone was out of John’s reach.
“Christ Sherlock, lie down and stop looking at me like that,” John growled, opening one eye to glower up at Sherlock’s features.
Sherlock crawled onto the bed, spreading John’s legs and blanketing himself on top of the omega until they lined up hip to hip. They both gasped, eyes locking, as cock brushed against achingly hard cock. He dropped immediately to John’s lips, biting his lower lip until the older man opened his mouth with a throaty groan and let Sherlock in. They kiss long and slow, exploring each other with tongues that taste of brandy and hands that feel like fire on the skin, hot and achingly familiar, for all that they have never done this before. How many times had he imagined clutching his hands around the swell of John’s arse? The press of his fingertips against dark nipples. The touch of his tongue against the omega’s skin?
"I'll just dose him up again, and be on my way." The glee in Jason's voice would have been disturbing to everyday people; Sherlock found it intriguing. Sadists were always so fascinating.
"Can you tell me what happened to you?" Sherlock questioned, his lips pursed into a thin line, forcing his expression to look less brooding.
"Don't pout Sherlock, you look like a child." Lestrade teased, one heavy hand landing on Sherlock's shoulder and giving the muscle a tight squeeze. It was oddly comforting, and at the same time, completely unwanted.
If that were to happen, Sherlock was certain it would ruin their friendship. There was no going back after a profession of love. It would stick in John's mind and rip at Sherlock's heart, poisoning their friendship and ruining the little slice of perfection that they had created together.
"Is this okay?" Sherlock questioned, dragging his hands up warm skin and slightly soft abs. John's belly jumped under his touch, tense, probably from the nighttime chill that still lingered on Sherlock's fingers.
Exhaust smoke bellowed out around him, mugging up his vision for a moment. His sight was so obscured that he didn’t see the man in front of him until he barreled right into him. His face collided with the hard width of a strangers chest.
He can’t help but stare into those lovely eyes, examine high cheekbones, and sharp features unhindered now that he has permission to look. Why had he never noticed the small beauty mark above Sherlock’s left brow? When had that thin little scar appeared on Sherlock’s cheek?
“Christ.” Spitting the taste of bile from his mouth John, groaned into the swell of one bicep and waited to see if the desire to spill his guts was going to hit again. After a few moments of just resting, he heaved a sigh of relief. Reaching to his left, he felt around the edge of the sink until he came across the bottle of Bismuth he’d bought in desperation the evening before. Uncapping the damn thing, he poured himself a dose and eyed the pink liquid dubiously. The viscous sweet taste of the medicine had him gagging into the toilet again and, he whined in frustration.
