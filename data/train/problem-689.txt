Feeling the tears finally come to his eyes, John's voice caught. "Then it is a journey I would make again, gladly. Only for you."
"I'm sorry?" John heard Dr. Sipe mutter perplexedly as the door swung shut in his face and they were bustling straight through the waiting room, past the gorgeously sad arowana still circling its extravagant tank without stopping.
"Damnit." He couldn't decide because he didn't really know. So he reached out and snagged a box of regular size and a box of larger sized condoms and a bottle of lubricant, shoving them discreetly under the bread. He picked up his pace and made his way to the magazines for Mrs. Hudson and then on to the checkout. Paying for it all, like Sherlock had suggested. And they took a cab back to Baker Street with their groceries.
"Thank you." John said almost reverently. As soft and hushed as a prayer. There was the heavy feeling of so much meaning wrapped up in those two simple words that Sherlock didn't feel it necessary to respond. So he simply hummed an agreement against his lips. /Anytime./
For all that the door wasn't, the interior of The Jolly Bulldog was gorgeous. It opened straight into a seductively lit,  cool-spectrum-coloured lounge. Its ceiling, coupled with the entire left wall behind the bar was made up of giant, flawless mirrors which gave the intimate room a large feel. The bar itself glistened magically, frosted with a thousand little chips of Swarovski crystals lit only at its edges with purple UV lights.
/And you brought such utter clarity to my life again./ John said with his eyes, because it felt far too damning to let his mouth say it aloud, but he could tell that Sherlock heard him all the same.
John berated himself in his idiocy.
It's important that you paid attention to the specific flu medicine that Sherlock switched out for a pop quiz i'm going to give you in the coming final chapter. you will be graded on your memory so remember it and i'll tell you why later. And I ran across the replacement merely by happy accident. and yes Comvita is really real and really made by bees! so it would definitely have Sherlock's seal of approval.
"Good." John smiled encouragingly, getting a small one in return. His interests sated, he wanted desperately for a change in subject. "So d'you want to tell me what you're putting nails into a bloke's brain for?"
"Sorry, but I am. I can't think anymore and I have to work this afternoon. I need at least a little bit of a kip to keep me functioning. Unlike some people." He generously waved a hand towards the skull on the mantle. "Talk to Billy if you're so keen. You two need to do some catching up anyway. I think he's getting jealous."
"This is quite a turn up, so early in the morning. I was just um," she fumbled with the saw, having trouble coordinating her walking and staring at the brooding detective. "I was just getting my tools ready for um, for the body. Oo!" She kicked the edge of the nearby table and nearly went sprawling, but saved herself, and shut up the saw into the autoclave with a lot of noise. She poked the buttons to turn it on and spun back to the group like the calamity hadn't ever occurred.
John was still stuck back at processing the grudge between Sherlock and this faceless DI, knowing Sherlock would absorb any of the facts that were truly relevant about Mr. Jones. "If Gregson doesn't like Sherlock, then why have you asked us here at all? I mean, won't he come here with the body?"
An ugly thought suddenly flashed unbidden across his mind. Striking him cold. "Sherlock?" He made nervous circles on Sherlock's hip with his fingers, still using the faux casual tone that fooled nobody. "I meant what I said before about you not having to hide anything from me. If something..." he licked his lips, "if someone's done something to you...anything you didn't want. I--"
John took a moment to find the muscles in his mouth to kiss back, then found himself comparing this kiss to the first they had shared. This one was so completely opposite to what had been done in the morgue that it may have well come from a completely different man.
On all accounts, this was the best morning that could have happened after such a terrible evening. "Fancy a fire?" He asked and set to work without waiting for an answer. Leaving his friend to clutch at his luminous brain.
Early morning found John in an anxious disposition, despite having had the best night's sleep he had ever had in his life.
"I know."
Caddyshack is a nickname idea I made up from the movie involving Bill Murray the actor about golf and gophers.
The building itself was nondescript, nestled deep in the heart of Mayfair and completely unremarkable in every way. Unless one knew precisely what to look for and John knew candidly that the occupant of that flowing Belstaff currently exiting the cab and leaving him to pay certainly did.
"'Will he live?' I heard the old man say and the physician replied 'for a while yet.' And with no more than that, the old man moved on. I remember him fading into shadow, towards a dark corner where a little later there was a sudden scream. He was slitting their throats Sherlock. He was wandering around asking if the wounded would live and hastening the death of those that would not survive."
John's hand groped drunkenly until he could put a loose fist in Sherlock's hair while Sherlock drug the tip of his tongue through the ejaculate, splitting it apart. "Jesus." John picked his head up to see, but it fell back again, too heavy to keep aloft. "Aw Christ."
Sherlock doesn't move.
But, unfortunately, it's also not feasible for them to linger in bed for the rest of their lives as there are still bills to pay and as Sherlock's fond of saying now, they're the only two consulting detectives currently active in London, so they must continue to do the work that nobody else is qualified to do.
Sherlock did it once more, repositioning himself with his own arse in the air for a better angle, his penis tilting heavily beneath him and this time he did not draw back for a rest, he stayed in the tight little ring, pushing further and further in as it tried to close around him, wriggling it as much as would allow.
John quickly singled out a woman slumped boneless in the back of an ambulance, buried under a blanket, sobbing openly into her hands. He recognized the other woman with the wiry hair standing next to her, and offered a small smile when Sergeant Sally Donovan met his gaze. Not at all surprised when she rudely brushed him off and turned back to the weepy woman, muttering something with a vexed air into her radio.
“Be a dear and tell John we’re not together,” Sherlock said. He swatted at her hand and she rolled her eyes.
“Excellent choices sir,” the waiter took their menus and walked away.
“Definitely should’ve asked,” John said after he took a few breaths.
John opened his eyes to look at Sherlock.
A gift from Angelo.
“I want to help people,” John answered. “Don’t get me wrong, rugby’s great and all, and yeah I could probably make a career out of it, but it’s not exactly a lasting career. One wrong move and I could be out for life. But you know a doctor...it’s a steady job and I uh...I might go into the army after.”
“Now who’s playing coy?” John asked.
“Really?” Sherlock tried to keep the surprise out of his voice.
“My girlfriend,” Sherlock answered.
“Well I can’t cancel now,” Sherlock sighed. “It’ll be a couple hours at most. I’ll be back before you go to bed. I promise.”
“'m trying to imagine you living in a college room like this…” John asked.
“I tried,” John pointed out. “Even started watering down your drinks, but the damage had been done...you were very adamant about it...I’m sure it won’t be that bad. It’ll just be a small group right?”
“See? She’s of so little interest to me I’ve already forgotten her name,” Sherlock told him. “In fact...maybe I should take a break as well.”
He hauled himself to his feet and started looking for the still ringing device. He got closer to John’s coat and looked through both pockets until he got the phone and pulled it out. He recognized the number of the surgery and went upstairs.
There were a few things John noticed as he woke up. Sherlock, despite his freezing feet, gave off heat like a furnace. Sherlock was still clearly dressed in the clothes he’d left in last night, with an arm wrapped around John and his face pressed into the back of Johns' neck. The last thing John noticed, well not last, it was really the first because his stomach was churning and he could already feel the bile crawling up his throat.
“Who the fuck are you?” Moran frowned.
“What does it matter?” John repeated. “You have a girlfriend! You just cheated on your girlfriend and she bloody caught us.”
John swallowed thickly. “Right…”
The cab ride home was quieter than the one there, Sherlock was mainly on his phone, he flipped between ordering the invitations for Christmas, making a list of grocery items and trying to find a high chair.
“You and Lestrade both told me to behave,” Sherlock answered as he finished buttoning up his shirt. “What was I supposed to do? Say no? She cornered me just as I’d come out of the loo.”
“It’s not about him,” John pulled himself away already missing the touch. “It’s you.”
John jumped a little startled as the lights were suddenly cut off again, and felt embarrassed as Sherlock ran a thumb over his John’s knuckle.
As always, kudos and reviews are a delight :)
Sherlock shrugged. “Perhaps that’s why? Our family assumed I’d either go into politics like my brother or the scientific field like my mother, she was a mathematician, but I was always a bit different. More like my father in some aspects I suppose. Always have to be different…”
Sherlock frowned. “I beg your pardon.”
“Bit of shit job you’re doing ain’t it?” Sarcasm dripped off every word. “Is it your job to fuck your students too?” He snatched his phone back. “I don’t need you dropping in like some fucking knight in a black Belstaff.” He shoved his things into his bag and slung the back over his shoulder. “So you can kindly fuck off.” He stormed out of the room.
“Angela thinks suffocation, I’m inclined to agree. There are no medical records indicating he was prone to seizures.”
“Nothing,” John assured him. “I just...I wanna be on top.”
Despite, the smoking habit, Dr. Carters was very apt at his job, and by the time they got to the ultrasound, he was pretty much allowing Sherlock the use of his chair in order to get a better look at the grainy screen.
Sherlock walked into the classroom and dropped his briefcase on the table with a thud. He took a quick head count of those who were there. The poor fellow who’d sat in the front row had moved two back and just out of his peripheral.
“John, surgeries calling,” he knocked on the door and waited for an answer. “John?” He knocked a second time and frowned when there was no answer.
“Who can tell me the name of a great philosopher?” he asked.
his mind supplied unhelpfully. “Teaching does seem the odd occupation for me, but I do enjoy it. Having the ability to shape the minds of the future, it’s exhilarating. Better than any high I’ve ever felt.”
Sherlock nodded and after throwing some pillows onto the floor and pushing the comforter and top sheet to the foot of the bed, pressed his back against the headboard and got some more lube to slick himself up. The cold was just enough to stem off his climax for a little longer.
“I took some medicine while I was in the bathroom. Sherlock I’m a doctor I know how to take care of myself. I’d like to go back to bed,” John sighed.
“Clearly something is bothering you,” Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest. “Does it have to do with what you were looking at?”
“No. You can’t,” Sherlock answered. “I must be going now. I’ve got to prep for my lecture for this afternoon.” He picked up a crouton and tossed it into his mouth. “Good day Mycroft. Give my best to Gordon.”
John swayed on his feet and Sherlock dropped his hands from his shoulder, only to grab his hand a few seconds later and guide him to a nearby bench outside of the building. He squeezed his eyes shut and took a couple deep breaths trying to keep the bile that threatened to crawl up this throat at bay.
John nodded and leaned up to give him a soft kiss. “Positive.”
John rolled his eyes. “Right then, so nine people,” he nodded. “Well, should we do it in the evening or in the afternoon?”
He tapped his foot on the floor a little impatiently as no one raised their hand.
“And the chocolate cookies with raspberry filling,” Sherlock titled his chin up and gave him a kiss. “No later than ten. Promise.”
Sherlock blushed embarrassed. “Ah...sorry, I meant to…”
John shivered again and leaned into Sherlock’s hand still resting on his cheek. “...Think you’re right.”
Would Sherlock have put his arm around him? How nice would that have felt if he had? He sighed and looked back down at the textbook on the desk in front of him.
“That sounds nice,” John replied.
“...You looked at my medical records didn’t you?” John asked with a chuckle.
Sherlock turned on his heel as he looked at his watch. Ten minutes ‘til John was due to arrive and he tangled bundle of nerves. He didn’t remember the last time he’d been this nervous, and he was valedictorian (reluctantly) of his graduating class.
“I’m fine Sherlock,” John called back. “Too much water at dinner that’s all.”
Sherlock smiled innocently and twisted out his way. He brought the bottle to his lips as he began walking back towards his room.
“Are you settling in well?” Mycroft asked.
He watched John make his way out of the bed and go into the bathroom. Sherlock grabbed the phone off the nightstand.
“I needed the class to balance all the bio and chem…” John answered. He hoisted his backpack higher up on his shoulder. “You didn’t mention you were a professor.”
“You’re worth it,” Sherlock told him as they parted. “But, I promise next time will be less expensive.”
They made their way back to the bedroom and John watched Sherlock push the sheets to the end of the bed. He sat down and pulled John into his lap so he was straddling him.
“Why do you want to dance then?” Sherlock frowned.
Sherlock automatically let go of John and after a small fight with the sheets, stumbled into the bathroom closing the door with more force than necessary.
“If you hadn’t had asked me, I...I’m sure I would’ve asked you,” John answered with a small nod. “I had made up my mind to say yes the same day you asked me, I just...I Just had to be certain you were sure.”
Sherlock nodded. “Was I...the reason for your panic attack?”
. I want to marry you and spend the rest of my life with you and if other people can’t seem to get that through their heads then they’re not worth my time,” Sherlock told him. “I only have eyes for you, John. You’re the only one I want to have kids with and the only one I want to marry and the only one I want to have sex with. No one else will ever compare to you. Especially not DI Monroe.”
But, being five months pregnant, meant his hormones did most of the thinking for him which is how he found himself hiding in their bedroom, cocooned in their comforter, with the detective on the other side of the door.
John moaned softly at the first finger. He fingers tightened in Sherlock’s hair at the second. He bit his lip, clenched around the fingers as Sherlock began a slow thrust.
“That’s not the point,” John grabbed his briefs and pulled them, with more force than was probably necessary.
Sherlock stared at the screen as he waited for a response.
“Sorry, on the phone,” Sherlock tossed John a not so apologetic look as he walked backward out of the bedroom.
“Well it smells terrible,” John said.
“You’re very fertile, I have no doubt conception would happen on the first try,” Sherlock answered. “But, I did mean the previous things I said before. And I took into consideration a couple other reasons you might be hesitant.”
The clear venom in Sherlock’s voice startled John.
“What?” Sherlock asked with a raised eyebrow.
p.s this is currently still unbeta'd
“What makes you think I’m bored?” Sherlock asked. He leaned in even closer, head bent towards the other man’s ear.
Sherlock plucked the strings of his violin as he waited for John to finish up in the bathroom and paced the floor. It’d been nearly two months since they had started trying for a baby with no results. Sherlock didn’t understand why it was taking them so long. They were doing everything Dr. Wright had instructed. Sherlock was still taking the vitamins. They had sex regularly enough that John should’ve gotten pregnant by this point.
“I prefer to give them,” Sherlock winked as he drank some of his wine. “So, you have a sister correct?”
“I understand your hesitation at having a child with me. You’re afraid it will do something to our relationship. And while, in the beginning, I admit I did employ the idea of using a surrogate and even asked Mycroft to compile a list of suitable options, but, I found that you are the only one I trust enough for this.”
John was not a jealous man. He was secure enough with himself and great in the sack that he didn’t need to worry about his partner's attention straying. He also knew that there wasn’t a single person who could take Sherlock’s attention away from him. Except for The Woman, and Moriarty. But neither of those were sexual interests, as far as John knew, so he didn’t really have anything to worry about.
“Fraid of the dark?” Sherlock teased gently.
Sherlock sat down across from Mycroft and picked up the menu. “I retained Dr. Nozik’s advisees when I took over his position.”
“Yes-”
He was still trying to understand why John had said yes. Yes, Sherlock knew his argument had been sound, but he hadn’t actually expected John to yes. Maybe a sympathetic smile, an understanding of the need to reproduce, and a gentle letdown, but not a yes. Not ‘You have fully convinced me’ with that smile Sherlock was starting to think was just reserved for him.
He practically shoved John onto the bed and climbed on top of him. He was muscular but small underneath Sherlock. Hands on either side of his head, he admired how John’s lips were swollen and red.
“Hmm?” John raised an eyebrow. “What’s behind you back?”
“Never,” Sherlock affirmed as he drank some of his own wine.
“Sherlock you agreed to meet her,” John answered. “We can go home after and you can shoot the wall to your heart's content.”
“You said to name a philosopher...he’s a philosopher isn’t he?” John answered. He shifted a little under Sherlock’s gaze.
“What time did you get home last night?” John asked.
Kissing wasn’t exactly easy with their movements, though Sherlock was very content to just bury his face into John’s neck while John buried his hands into Sherlock’s hair instead.
“You’re an idiot,” John stated.
“Will you...will you say it again?” Sherlock asked. “Please?”
"Problem Mr. Watson?” Sherlock asked as he packed up his things.
“Don’t you two make a handsome couple,” Mrs. Hudson smiled as Sherlock walked back downstairs.
A muscle in John’s jaw ticked.
with me?”
“M’cold…” John leaned heavily against Sherlock as his eyes fluttered.
His hands found John’s chest and he gave a gentle squeeze as he rolled his nipples between his fingers. John gasped and moaned arching into the feeling.
“How do you feel?” John asked.
“If you weren’t interested you would’ve told me to fuck off,” the man replied. He smiled amused. “But you haven’t.”
“Then why are you here?” he asked.
Sherlock set the cardboard aside and picked up the small booklet that was to serve as the instructions. He looked up as John walked into the room with a fresh cup of tea and took a seat in his chair, which gave him an ample view of Sherlock and the many pieces that would, hopefully, become a highchair.
The music was shit: some mainstream song that was currently taking the city and riding it for all it was worth before it was forgotten about.
“What happens if we go over the word limit?” she asked. “Because I tend to ramble when I want to get a point across and I want to know if you’ll downgrade us for going over.”
“A break?” John asked. “From what?”
“Good?” Sherlock finally looked at John.
He glanced over and saw a small smile tug at the corner of John’s lips at the small compliment and there was that feeling in Sherlock’s chest again. Sherlock looked back at his phone and read over the text from his mother, pleased she agreed to share some of her recipes with them, but also expressing her regret about not being able to attend.
Time for our boys to have a little date :)
Sherlock wanted someone to stare down.
“It’s possible,” the doctor nodded. “We’ve brought his fever down, but have him on a mild sedative for the moment. We can have one of our doctors come in and do an ultrasound for you if you’d like.”
He leaned down and kissed him as he wrapped his hand around his length and began stroking in time with his thrusts.
He waited a moment for a response.
Sherlock had found the thought of seeing John full of their child had brought out something almost, no, not almost,
“John breathe. Put your head between your legs and take deep breaths.”
“Ah...the hot chocolate fondant with two spoons and two coffee’s,” Sherlock answered as he gave the menu back.
currently unbeta'd
Sherlock gave a throaty chuckle. “Fraid he’s not going to be involved.”
“Bloody tease,” John pouted as Sherlock effortlessly switched the conversation. “Older sister as you pointed out yeah. I’d say we don’t get along much, but sounds like it’d be an understatement compared to you and your brother.”
“You’re lying…” John frowned. His cheeks were flushed from the alcohol.
Mycroft did not look amused. “I thought it might be nice for us to have Italian as Italy is where mother and father exchanged their vows, fifty-two years ago. We’ll start with zuppa toscana, followed by spaghetti alla puttanesca with garlic bread, and mozzarella stuffed meatballs, with, of course, mother’s famous lemon ginger cheesecake for dessert.”
“Thank you...for...what you said to Moran…” John started.
“Did you enjoy yourself?” John asked.
“Really Sherlock, it’s,” John sighed and tried not to let his emotions get the best of him. “It’s alright. I understand. Honestly, I’m amazed that you’ve managed to make it to every appointment before.”
“I’m John.”
“Shhh, it’s alright John,” Sherlock wrapped an arm around him and rubbed his back. “It’s alright John.”
“Your partner,” the doctor looked back down at the chart, “our test show he’s a few weeks along...Do you have any idea what might have made him sick?”
and even I didn’t notice,” John tried to assure him. “And it’s not your fault I got sick. It was stupid to follow a bloody criminal into the Thames in a downpour anyway. But I’m going to be okay. Our baby is going to be okay Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, why are you showing me your empty hiding places?” John asked confused. “Though I’m glad they’re empty.”
“You said yes,” Sherlock answered.
Enjoy!
“You’re joking,” John covered his mouth to keep from laughing.
“Course I’m lying, her loss is my gain. You’re bloody gorgeous,” he chuckled. “What’s your name?”
“It’s nothing…” John answered. “It’s stupid.”
John chuckled.
“Really?” Sherlock took another swig from the water bottle. “That’s usually not what people say.”
Chapter 15:
She nodded and went to place his order.
Sherlock walked over to his sheet music and shifted through the papers before finding what he was looking for and picked up the bow.
“Sorry...sorry,” John sighed. “Just, hormones probably...I should get home.”
“Apparently,” John scratched the back of his neck awkwardly.
“Mummy...we haven’t even had our first yet,” Sherlock pointed out as he fixed their tea. “And we hadn’t discussed it.” He sat back down with his own cup of tea once the others had been passed out and put his arm around John.
“They do little else,” Sherlock gave John a small smile. “Is that a yes?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, we’ll have raviolo of ricotta and baby spinach, herbs butter sauce toasted pine nuts and ballotine of foie gras with fine beans, toasted brioche for starters, and as the main,” here Sherlock pointed to a few of the main dishes and handed the waiter their menus.
John took one of the small stapled stacks of paper and quickly scanned the front page.
“You don’t seem too sure about that,” John pointed out.
Sherlock found himself smiling as he sent off his text.
“Who?” Sherlock looked up.
John managed to reach out and grab the sleeve of his suit jacket and pull him back just enough to grab the bottle from his hands.
“If I remember correctly, I went to the bathroom about that time and left my phone on the table,” Sherlock answered. “I would prefer not to imply anything, but I believe DI Monae saw you were calling, sent it to voicemail and then deleted the message.”
I'm so happy you guys are all enjoying this story :)
“What happened?” Sherlock asked. “John, I can’t help if you don’t tell me.”
“Good afternoon gentlemen,” he smiled as he walked over. “Just do a quick exam and then we’ll get to that ultrasound.”
“Finally,” John sighed as he kissed back and played with the hair on the nape of Sherlock’s neck. He twisted a few curls around his fingers.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “How…?”
“Definitely excited,” Sherlock assured him. “We can leave from my flat. I’ll expect you say six?”
“I do John,” Sherlock answered earnestly. “And I would be in your debt forever if you did this with me. And as you know, I don’t like being in someone’s debt.”
They shared another kiss, and Sherlock pulled away, lest they get arrested for a bit of public indecency and flagged down another cab.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, are you having these...cravings?” Sherlock asked.
“What do we have to toast to?” Sherlock frowned.
“Ex-girlfriend, John,” Sherlock reminded.
John pressed his finger to Sherlock’s lips, he was suddenly upset, not with Sherlock, he didn’t think he could be upset with Sherlock. No. He was upset with whoever had been there before him.
Enjoy!
John felt the bed dip and Sherlock gently prying the covers out of his hand so he could get in with him. He pulled John in close and wiped his eyes, even as fresh tears started to roll down his cheeks.
Sherlock’s way of answering was to circle the ring of muscle with his tongue before thrusting it inside. He gripped his thighs tightly and felt John’s fingers gripping his hair. He sucked on his rim and felt John clench.
The matron stabbed the bag of sand with a large flat knife and with a twist, sand began steadily falling onto the plate. John found himself more fascinated with watching Sherlock rather than the man tied to the chair working himself out of his bonds.
“Mrs. Hudsonson,” Sherlock wrinkled his nose, “Mrs. Hudson drinks brandy before bed. She’s not gonna wake up.” He waved his hand dismissively and latched onto the banister when the motion almost caused him to fall back.
“Oh, John as always your brilliance astounds me!” Sherlock grinned as he gave him a kiss. He pulled out his phone and cradle it between his ear and shoulder as he pulled on his coat. “Angela? I know who the killer is. Meet me at the Mother in law’s house in ten minutes.” He hung up and tied his scarf around his neck. “Don’t wait up,” He called over his shoulder.
“You think we should tell Mrs. Hudson soon?” John asked. “It’ll be harder and harder to keep it from her…”
“You’re lying,” John smiled as he leaned up for another kiss.
Sherlock’s voice cut through the air like a knife and his hand was a solid weight on John’s shoulder. He hadn’t realized how much he’d been shaking until he had registered Sherlock's hand.
“John? You alright?” Sherlock asked. He knocked on the door tentatively.
“Are you two ready to hear the heartbeat?” he asked.
“I love you too,” Sherlock smiled.
John nodded a little and dug into his pockets for his keys. He led Sherlock into the building, up to the second floor and to his dorm. He never realized how sparsely it was decorated until someone other than his mates were in the room with him. Sherlock shut the door behind him and set his briefcase on the floor next to John’s desk. He shrugged out of his coat and laid it across the back as he sat.
“Your girlfriend?” he practically hissed. “You said you broke up.”
“Nothing,” Sherlock turned slightly to get a better look at him.
Sherlock went after him and the two half stumbled half crashed into the detective's bedroom. He pounced sending them both falling onto the bed. The bottle of wine fell with them and John twisted to try and stop the flow of liquid. Sherlock grunted as he was nearly elbowed in the face and waited for John to balance the bottle against the headboard. Sherlock pressed his face against the column of John’s throat and breathed in his scent. Antiseptic, and earl grey tea. John's fingers were in his hair a second later.
John chuckles at first, then hunched forward even more as tears gathered in the corners of his eyes.
“What’re you doing?” John asked after a moment.
It has definitely been awhile since the last update. Part of it was some family things going on, and the other part was that I wrestled with this chapter for the better part of a couple weeks. Hopefully you all like :)
“What?” Lestrade asked. “She seems nice.”
“Why didn’t you come get me then?” Sherlock frowned.
John frowned. “Nine?”
John leaned up for another kiss and walked him to the door. “Love you.”
“This song is shit,” Sherlock said instead.
“We’ll each get a dessert next time,” Sherlock promised. “We’ve still got the entertainment part of the evening left.”
“Way to go, Watson.”
“No, I’ll catch a cab,” John answered.
He started to tug John back down but John pulled his arm free.
John’s eyes fluttered this time. They were unfocused and had a glassy hue as they attempted to look at Sherlock.
John let out a soft groan as he sank onto the bed and watched Sherlock shut the door behind them. He moved his body upwards until his head was a few inches away from the headboard and wrapped his arms around Sherlock as the man climbed on top of him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stood up. John averted his gaze as the man walked to the bathroom and stepped out a couple seconds later in a light blue dressing gown. He walked up to John and John took a step back. Sherlock smirked and took another step forward causing John to a step back. This process repeated until John was backed up against the wall. He leaned in as if he was going to kiss him, smiled innocently and proceeded to open the bedroom door.
Anywho!
“Sherlock…” John wasn’t sure how to take that.
“Mmm,” John made a noise of agreement and opened his eyes to take in the face of his bedmate.
“Well, clearly the baby doesn’t like it,” John stated matter of fact.
“John…”
“Hi…” John rocked nervously on his heels as Sherlock opened the door.
Took a couple liberties with Sherlock's schooling
“Oh, we can’t have that,” Sherlock gave one final lick.
“Oh?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he stood.
“Dr. Carters, do you er...have a moment?” Sherlock hung back after John had left to use the bathroom and get them checked out.
“It wouldn’t have been any of your business,” Sherlock pointed out.
A gold star to whoever can guess why Sherlock picked out John's Costume and what he may have made his ex dress as~
The conversation came to a short pause as the waiter brought over their main courses. Sherlock had elected to try the fried halibut and ordered the lobster risotto for John. He kept looking up from his own plate every so often at John’s soft exclamations, pleased to see him enjoying the food.
“John, I want to help you because you’re one my students and it’s my job to make sure you’re okay,” Sherlock remained calm.
“She seems like so wants to take a bite out of my fiance. Bet it’s not even a triple homicide, probably just a dumb murder or something,” John scoffed.
“Sherlock, can we not use every holiday as a way for you to one-up our brother?” John asked. “May I remind you of the 4th of July of 2014 fiasco.”
“Of course it’s real,” John answered, he sat next to him on the couch and looked at the pictures. “What made you think it wasn’t?”
Sherlock waved her off and picked up his phone. He leaned back in his chair as he opened the link Molly sent him and raised an eyebrow at the poster that lit up his screen.
“Yes, you have successfully convinced me,” John nodded. “I will set an appointment with one of the doctors at the surgery to be on the safe side….You know...insemination is going to be expensive and there’s no guarantee it’s going  happen on the first try.”
He’d dressed in a pair of worn jeans that were stretched enough to fit around the slowly growing swell of his abdomen, and one of the sweaters they’d picked up at the store a few days ago. The one Sherlock had picked out, a nice dark green v-neck with fitted cuffs on the wrists.
Sherlock looked up sharply. “What?”
I should also mention because I didn't last time, Lestrade and Mycroft are of course acting like they didn't know about the baby the entire time, and I know there's going to be a minor inconsistency, just a fair warning for those who notice it.
They took turns helping each other washed, Sherlock enjoyed the way John massaged his scalp as he washed his hair and showed him as much, which resulted in them staying in the shower until the water threatened to run cold. Sherlock got out first and wrapped a towel around his waist before helping John and both men dried off. Neither bothered with clothes and just pulled the robes back on. Sherlock liked it when John wore his robes, they were obviously too big and John had tied it so the knot was resting just above his stomach.
“It was nothing,” Sherlock brushed it off. “So long as you enjoyed yourself.”
“Bloody fantastic,” John huffed out a laugh and gave a slow swivel of his hips. He shuddered and moaned. “So deep…”
“Just a bit,” John nodded. “Course Sherlock’s been a big help with that.”
“That’s all that matters?” Sherlock interrupted softly.
“Well?” John asked.
“You didn’t tell Faith to expound,” John answered as he stopped in front of the desk.
enjoyable. “Do you want me flat or…?”
Most likely not next chapter though
He wore a black long sleeved button up with a grey waistcoat and matching fitted blazer with a pair of slim black dress pants and black dress shoes.
interested,” he smirked playfully as Sherlock joined him.
“Sherlock, I’m a
“Yep,” John picked up his wine.
I intended some sexy times for this chapter but it didn't turn out that way, next one though I promise :)
"Shhhh,” John pressed a finger to his lips as they tried, and failed, to quietly make their way up the stairs to their flat. He was gripping the banister with one hand, the other holding the bottle of wine they’d brought home with them.
He looked at his watch just as doorbell went off. He gave himself one last look in the mirror, smoothed his hair back and tried to take his time as he hurried down the stairs to open the door.
John huffed to himself. “You were very focused on that cold case last night. Didn’t want to disturb you.”
“So I’ve been told,” Sherlock smiled back.
John was already pulling off his shirt and getting into bed. “And miss those wonderful fingers? Please, apply away.”
John’s cheeks were flushed a dark red, and his breathing was a little labored. Sherlock pressed his hand against John’s forehead and cheeks.
“They do little else,” Sherlock gave John a small smile. “Is that a yes?”
John couldn’t help but also notice the class was filled with some attractive young women.
Sherlock thanked him and strode out to the waiting room where John was waiting with a curious gaze. He was not wrong about the attraction part, even before they agreed to have a baby, Sherlock had found John more attractive than the average man or woman.
“Because you always do,” Sherlock answered.
The waiter returned and uncorked the bottle, filling the glass with just enough for a sip before handing it to Sherlock for appraisal. Sherlock swirled the drops around the glass a few times, gave an appreciative sniff and nodded.
He let John get out of bed and rolled over onto his stomach. “We haven’t had sex in ages.”
“...How did she guess your passcode?” John frowned.
“Everybody's an idiot,” Sherlock replied.
“Oh John…”
“Christ...that’s...that’s really their heartbeat?” John asked.
“Do you have a preference?” Sherlock asked John.
“Told you,” the man replied.
“Right, give me your phone,” Sherlock held out his hand.
“So soon?” She stood up and walked over to where Sherlock had sprawled in a chair. She brushed a few curls away from the man’s face.
“No, we’ll see this...Dr. Carters,” Sherlock finished signing them in and joined John by the chairs. “Someone else will be doing the exam.”
“Mrs. Hudson took the liberty, but I facilitated,” Sherlock answered. “Moving on.”
“I still have half a mind to report him,” Sherlock answered.
“Everybody out now,” Sherlock ordered.
“Then why didn’t you ask me to stay?” John asked. “I would’ve stayed if you’d ask.”
“Bit indecent don’t you think?” Sherlock groaned.
“O...oh, um, Adam Smith?” She stammered.
Sherlock swallowed as he thought back to the last case. “He’s a GP at a local surgery.” He said instead. “Could he have caught it there?”
Sherlock nearly growled as his phone began vibrating on the table and rolled over to grab it bringing John with him. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s torso and laid his head on Sherlock’s chest. He let one hand trail downwards and just let it rest on the waistline of his briefs.
John snorted and turned his head to look at him. “Not a bad way to wake up, but I think we should shower first. You’ve still got a bit of smeared all over your face.”
“You know what I mean,” Moran rolled his eyes. “What gives? Still pissy about the party? It was just a joke Watson.”
“Sherlock, are you listening to me?”
Sherlock reached up brushed his fingers along John’s cheek and let his hand rest there. John’s cheeks were relatively smooth to the touch. He hardly ever grew facial hair.
Sherlock turned his head as John walked past him to get to the bathroom. He sat up and set the pictures on the coffee table.
“Ladies and gentleman,” the lights raised to show an older Chinese woman standing in the center of the ring. “Welcome to the circus.”
“John was just telling us how he’ll be starting his maternity leave early,” DI Monae smiled.
“Everything alright?” John asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
John reluctantly sank into one of the seats at the front of the room.
“Was just gonna take a few pictures, have a little fun,” Moran shrugged. “S’not like you’re a stranger to fun. And you’ve got such a nice arse. Can you blame me?”
“That’s five minutes of my life I won’t ever get back,” Sherlock announced as he pulled the shower curtain open and stepped in with John.
“You’re late.”
Sherlock looked back down at his laptop as he fought an embarrassed blush. “Forget I said anything. Have you finished grading those quizzes yet?”
“Will you pay attention!” Irene braced her hands on his desk. “Honestly, it’s like speaking to a child.”
“Good morning…” the voice was thick with sleep and caressed John’s skin like velvet.
“Of course she did,” John drawled. “Bet she gave you a tour right? Accidentally left a few of her things in the bedroom? On the floor maybe?”
“And what Sherlock. What’s wrong? You’re not making sense,” John told him.
“You do get rather into it,” John chuckled.
“Apologies Mrs. Hudson, you know how much I hate waiting,” he itched for a cigarette but pushed the thought aside quickly. He couldn’t risk sticking his suit up with cigarette smoke.
John swallowed. “Yeah...I…” he licked his lips. “I just started thinking about what happened over the weekend and...and what you said, about us liking each other...but, I thought...I thought you might be humoring me, or telling me what I wanted to hear. I...I like you, I know I shouldn't. I know you’re my professor, and I know you have a girlfriend, but I...I like you, and I didn’t want to leave and the thought of you not liking me...it..it hurts…”
“You’re...you’re pregnant and I almost made you lose the baby,” Sherlock answered softly.
“What do they say?” John asked.
“Sherlock,” he told him.
“What’s wrong John?” Sherlock asked.
“I’m feeling generous,” Sherlock mused as he put his hands on John’s waist and slid them downwards to squeeze his ass. “First we’re going to finish our shower, then I plan to spend an exorbitant amount of time spreading you open with nothing but my fingers and tongue. And then, I’m going to make you come.”
to be a surprise.”
“Scotland Yard,” Sherlock answered as if he was the most obvious thing in the world. “Stay home with you...make sure you know how much I love you every day. Lestrade’s already given me a couple dozen cold cases, and I’m sure Mycroft’s got a few things lying around to keep me from driving you up the wall...and we could just...be together…” he blushed at the end.
Sherlock smiled a bit and they tapped their glasses. “Seventh times the charm.”
The glow just made him more attractive. The near-permanent flush to his cheeks, how soft it all looked.
John closed his mouth and watched Sherlock pour their glasses after a moment's silence. He took the offered glass and waited for Sherlock to speak again.
“Looks like he had a seizure,” John said as he looked at the crime scene photos spread out on the coffee table. “Probably swallowed his tongue.”
Sherlock reached out and grabbed his hand as he started to walk past and tugged him in for a short kiss. John smiled and leaned in a little more before pulling away.
“That’s good,” she smiled. “And I trust we haven’t had any more late night swims in the Thames?”
He was cut off as his back made contact with the wall, Sherlock’s body pressed against his, warm hands cupped his cheeks as chapped lips were kissing his. John reached up and fisted the lapels of Sherlock’s jacket as he started to kiss back and moaned softly into his mouth.
I'm most likely going to start posting two chapters at a time, or one chapter once a week mainly cause I'm just about done with classes so I'm getting a bit more free time.
“Mind if we at least get back into bed first?” John teased as if sensing Sherlock’s thoughts.
“Nonsense, Irene was just leaving,” Sherlock dropped his hands lower and John gripped the sheets tighter. “Weren’t you?”
He pressed his forehead against John’s shoulder and kissed the skin there as he eased in.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed his mother’s cheek as he grabbed the jar and walked back out to the living room.
“Learned my lesson last time,” John promised.
I'm so happy at all the lovely kudos and comments! As a thank you I've got another two chapters to be posted. Tossed in a brief but of Sarah/John so we could have a little jealous Sherlock~
“I wouldn’t be opposed to another child,” John said as he drank some tea. “If we were to have another baby, I think I’d want them to be close in age.”
“That wasn’t very nice…” John pointed out, though he couldn’t stop the small smile even if he wanted to.
Forgot to mention before, I don't own the character's sadly. This is also obviously slight AU.
“...we can’t,” John shook his head.
“You’re joking right?” John shook his head and stood up. “Stay here.”
He shifted so his face was level with John’s stomach. He rucked up John’s t-shirt and placed his hands on either side. Another kick came a couple moments later, near where Sherlock’s left hand was placed.
“We agreed never to speak of that again,” Sherlock said. “And this is completely different. No fireworks will be involved. I promise.”
“Bollocks,” Sherlock swore and crossed his arms over his chest. “Why didn’t you stop me?”
John nodded and could only whimper as Sherlock bit down gently. Sherlock reached down with his free hand to give John’s length a few strokes smearing the pre-cum that had gathered as he teased the head. He pulled away after giving some attention to his other nipple and sat up to look down at John’s flushed skin.
“Towards your partner?” Dr. Carters asked with a raised eyebrow.
“...Makes you wonder though,” Sherlock mused.
And they were engaged.
Sherlock blinked. “We have an appointment for five.”
“The baby can’t smell it John,” Sherlock pointed out.
“Go on,” John smiled. “You’ve been bouncing off the walls since the last one closed.”
“John...You were right…” Sherlock said after another pause. “I...well I won’t go into details, but you were right...and I’m so sorry if I made it seem like I was interested, I was just trying to be nice like I was told…”
“I believe your jacket was lost somewhere in the sitting room,” Sherlock mused.
John nodded. “I know it’s not as sophisticated as what you might say, but it’s true isn’t it?”
Pity.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but took the water and the sandwich. John leaned against the desk.
He scrolled through his text messages and slowed as he read over one from Moran.
“Why John Locke?” Sherlock asked.
“I pulled some strings yes, but you and I both know what happened, Sherlock. You won’t be stepping foot on that campus again,” Mycroft told him. “Nor any campus in that area as a matter of fact.”
“Need the loo,” John answered. “Place came with one bathroom remember?”
“Beautiful,” Sherlock said as he leaned down to kiss him again. “Absolutely gorgeous.”
Sherlock wrapped his scarf around John’s neck and tucked it into the coat. “I know, but we need to keep you cool. Can’t have you overheating. Bit not good right?”
he'd be saying something. Something that required the comforts of the flat.
“Sherlock what are-mmph!”
“Please don’t...I can...I can handle him,” John looked at his sheets. “I can try anyway….”
He knew it wasn’t that uncommon to conceive on the first try, but as each test came back negative he found himself getting more and more disappointed. John was putting on a brave face, but Sherlock could see the dejected look in his eyes each time he told Sherlock the results.
“Not really no.”
“I’ll let you know when I’ve finished,” Sherlock promised as he walked over and gave John a chaste kiss. He turned back to DI Monae and motioned for her to lead. “After you.”
“Fine. Ex-girlfriend then,” Sherlock shrugged. “What does it matter?”
Sherlock, whether intentionally or not he didn’t know, placed his hand on John’s lower back to usher him out of the apartment. He shut the door behind them with a soft click and the two men descended downstairs.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock frowned as he turned to face John. “You should be pregnant by now.”
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked this time.
“Jerk and asshole are relative terms, you can do better than that,” Sherlock reached up to massage his temples.
“That doesn’t make you uncomfortable does it?” Sherlock asked. “If you’re worried about physical attraction…”
“Because of Irene?” Sherlock asked.
He grabbed a bottle of lube that was conveniently placed under his pillow and poured some into his hands. He spread John’s legs and teased his puckered hole with his fingers.
“Can’t I?” Mycroft smiled.
“From what I remember all of their food is excellent,” Sherlock answered as he skimmed over his own. “We could start with the raviolo unless you’d prefer something else…?” he looked up and found John staring down his menu. “John? Are you alright?”
“John…” Sherlock sounded exasperated as he knocked for the one-hundredth time. “John, how was I supposed to know she was
“When was the last time you slept?” John frowned.
“M’cold…” John leaned heavily against Sherlock as his eyes fluttered.
Sherlock could tell that wasn’t the whole truth but thought better than to push.
There was still three minutes until the class was supposed to start and the room was decently filled. Philosophy wasn’t exactly a class he’d been planning on taking, but he’d heard it was an easy A and he needed something to balance all of his biology and chemistry classes.
Sherlock followed his gaze to the young woman standing in the doorway. She smiled and gave a small wave towards John.
They thanked him once John had finished getting changed and Sherlock clutched both photos and disc in his hands like a lifeline of sorts.
“...I forgot…” Sherlock frowned and dropped his arms. “Iss gone.”
“Are you trying to say you’d want me as the father of your baby?” Sherlock asked.
“I think we need another shower,” John chuckled.
“No Sherlock. That’s, really thoughtful. Might be a bit difficult though when it comes to late night feedings though,” John chuckled.
It took twenty minutes for John to reach a state of passable calm. And another ten before he could actually speak. Not that he a did.
“I’d make you get Property of John H. Watson on your chest,” John answered simply.
“I’m going to have words with your mother about your manners,” she shook her head.
Sherlock secretly wished his brought his reading glasses with him as his wine-addled brain tried to focus on the words.
“Of course,” The waiter nodded and walked away to get their wine.
“My parents walked in on me and my first boyfriend when I was sixteen,” Sherlock found himself admitting to ease the tense silence. “In my defense, I told them we were studying, and we were but, we took a break and suffice to say Im no longer allowed to be alone with my partner in my room with the door closed.”
I give the cabbie the address change and wonder why Jo wants to meet at the park. It seems like a coincidence that she would text me at the same time I am headed to see her. Marjorie would have something to say about coincidences.
“We should be able to with her doctor evaluation at her return. But Scarlett, this would most likely be publicly discussed. They may find out about all the other injuries you have sustained. Is that something you are prepared for?” Marjorie pulled other papers from her desk drawer. “Since you were undercover for MI5, most will be classified but not all.”
He had no one. No one to go home to, but a sad, small bedsit and his gun.
“Ta,” John moved into the house, making his way to a chair in the sitting room. Watson close behind him, wagging his tail.
No more running through the streets. No more chases on rooftops.
I am so happy that so many have decided to take a risk with me on this story. Only 3 more chapters left after this one. We are getting close to the end. I had planned to post only a chapter a week but decided to would be to much. I hope you continue to enjoy this angst story. <3
I hurry back downstairs, not seeing either Marjorie or Grace as I reach the door. “I’ll be back!” I yell over my shoulder as I walk out.
"What, John! What would you like me to say?" Sherlock yelled, spinning to face the man. "That I was planning to use, that I have been using during the time I was gone?! That it has been the only way to keep the demons at bay over the past eighteen months?!" Sherlock felt his strength leave his body. He was crumbling in front of the one person he had tried to be strong for.
As tears fall from my eyes, I stumble back into my mind, back to the Jo that is waiting for me there. The one that got me through the torture and loneliness of the last years. She is vibrant and gorgeous where she waits for me on the sofa.
Sherlock stood now behind John’s chair, his hands lightly feeling the red fabric one last time.
"What? No, not that," John stuttered. "I mean your arm. Why?"
I let myself drift off in her arms. I can’t think clearly until I can calm down and no place calms me like here with Jo. Tomorrow I will see things differently and find a way to clear my name once again.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“We will figure everything out. You should have told her you were alive before now, Scar.”
"Starving." John laughed.
Dear John,
"John," Sherlock pulled back for a moment. "Is this what you wanted?"
John held up a hand. "Sherlock, it's okay. I shouldn’t have laid that all out. It's not yours to bear, it's mine."
“Your dog seems to like me,” John commented. “You really named him Watson?”
Sherlock
So I choose the coward’s way out; to leave in the night without saying a word. If I had sent you my last letter maybe you would understand. But I have decided not to send any of these to you; I don't want to come off as desperate on top of everything else. I have no right to you, no claim to your heart. Which you freely gave to another while I was away.
My phone pings in my pocket. A text from Jo.
“What am I going to do, Gray.” I sob. This is completely undignified but I can’t help it. She holds me tight, making soft shushing sounds. Her hands rub my back in that soothing mother way. This is how I wanted Jo and I’s reunion to go.
Being so lost and alone, neither believes the other feels the same for them.
“Yeah, thought I would get an early start, have a lot to fill him in on today.” John looked down at the flowers in his hand.
“I don’t need the world to know I didn’t do it. Just Jo. If I show her my hand that should be enough.” I start pacing the room. My dressing gown flows behind me. I realize that I am fact still only wearing pants under said dressing gown. “I need to see her.”
He only smirks at me which sends my rage through the roof. Just as I reach him, I realize my mistake.
“For Henry. For giving you a reason to doubt me again. For hurting you over and over.” I cry into her shoulder as she strokes my hair. I can almost feel her fingers sliding through my curls.
“Are you sure you’re okay, Sherlock?” John moved out of his chair towards Sherlock.
I would prefer a suit but I don’t have time to return to Baker Street. I dress and lace up my shoes before checking the mirror.
He reached for the tie and held it against his side, securing it tightly just above his elbow. Once done he pumped his hand to bring his vein to the surface. This is the point, he either plunges in the needle or unties and walks away…
He waits with bated breath…
"Oh really, well in that case you have delivered him." Moran chuckled, his eyes dark and humorless. "Vlado, what was he saying to you?"
"Well, well. What do we have here?" The voice sent chills down John's back. "Going somewhere, soldier?"
“I’m sorry, Jo.” I whisper.
"Yes?" John answered. "Where is he?"
"I don't think so. Vlado, put him in your cell and secure the compound." Moran gave John one more look before walking away.
Sherlock waited patiently as he could, one hand holding his tea, while the other scratched Watson’s head.
“Scarlett Christina Elizabeth Holmes! You drop that thought this instant.” Marjorie enters the room with a look that says she knows exactly what I had just been thinking.
Mycroft had officiated the ceremony for them and it had been perfect. Not a cloud in the sky and Sherlock’s bees all around them. John couldn’t have asked for better.
"I'm here to relieve you," John said, using his best captain voice on the man.
"He was last seen at the train station in Germany. From what was discovered by the police there, he was taken shortly after boarding the train, though the how is still being determined." Mycroft paused. "John, we will need you to find him."
Sherlock had known the news would not be what he wanted to hear. He had gone in knowing the chances of unpleasant news were high, but he had not thought it would be this bad.
"Look if you're not going to leave, I will have to call the police." John said, trying to keep focused. When no word was given or movement made. John turned towards the kitchen to find his phone.

I try to breathe but everything hurts. My hands are fisted deep in my curls, I barely feel the pull.
John looked up. “I- uhm-”
I miss you. Do you miss me? Do you even care that I am gone? Do you even notice? Or is your happiness too bright to see that I am no longer there?
I dash out of Mar’s office and up the stairs. I quickly dig through the wardrobe for any clothes I may have left here from before. I come out with a pair of skinny jeans and a black cashmere jumper.
Sherlock let out a sigh of relief. "Okay, thank you. So... So we are doing this then?" he asked, waving a hand at both of them.
John waved before walking to where Sherlock rested.
So many questions and thoughts were running through his mind that it was overloading quickly. Sherlock took a seat on the chair across from John. His mind registered how similar it was to Baker Street, causing his heart to ache. He thought he had gotten past this. The ache, the longing, the pain of missing John. He absently rubbed his chest as he watched John petting Watson.
John patted the man's cheek. "Hey, you awake? Will? Are you Agent Will?"
John surprised himself as much as Sherlock at his words. He had only just met the man and yet it seemed so familiar to be this close.
“What is your plan now?” She asked.
The End.
John glanced out the corner of his eye to see the man next to him grinning.
John let out a groan as he settled on Sherlock's lap, his hands buried in Sherlock's curls. "Yes, please," he whispered in between kisses.
“Hello there. Just visiting the Missus?” John shook Mr Wilson’s offered hand.
But his heart still leapt a bit at the sight.
-------------------
Welcome to another chapter. I hope you are all ready for this. I want to thank my two betas Cherieftpotter and fuckoffwatson1 for their help with this story. <3
The mystery of a broken hearted ex-detective. There. I have given it its name. I fear that I may have had one too many scotch on the rocks this evening.
John laughed. "That's a joke. Mycroft cares nothing for me. To Holmes I am expendable." He dropped the cigarette butt to the ground putting it out with his boot. "So let's get on with the dying part, shall we?"
Though he was sure John would mostly get rid of everything Sherlock had left behind, he hoped that by leaving the chairs John wouldn’t forget him.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock looked down at his hands. “Yes.”
Sherlock watched everything unfolding. What to do? What to do...?
A short chapter of Jo's POV.
“No it is not,” counters Grace. “We all had a part in this.”
-------------------
Sherlock tried to stand carefully, even as his head began to throb. “I just need to relax. I am sorry. I have a spare room upstairs, you are welcome to use.”
My hair is wild looking but there is little I can do. I run a brush through it, trying to calm the main part a little.
Sherlock took the information in, filing it away. “None of this explains why you are here?”
I spend a long time in the shower, just soaking up the warm water. It feels glorious to me after spending so long tied to that chair in the freezing cold. I can feel the water washing away the feel of Mark's hands on my body. As I shampoo my hair it is odd to have it so short now. I have gotten used to my long hair over the years and I loved it. Now thanks to Mark it was about chin length. The last time it was that short was during my tour in Iraq.
“Why would that bother you?” Sherlock probed. “At best you see me as a friend, much like Lestrade or Stamford. Maybe a good friend.” The emotion that fell across John’s face said that Sherlock had made a grave mistake. “Unless you just saw me as your flatmate and colleague?”
Nothing could change this now unless he discovered time travel, which was not a plausible option.
I want to thank my amazing beta Lyri for all her help with this story and cheer-leading through the tears of my angst.
"If only you were here. I could use your brain right now." John sighed, finishing his packing.
“Loo is just there.” Sherlock pointed to a door. “Goodnight, John.” With that, he moved into his room and shut the door. He could just hear John whisper a goodnight through the wood.
There was no way to stop the hurt that his heart felt in this moment. He slowly lifted the syringe, turning it in his hand. It caught the light from the lamp on his nightstand. He should have relocated from the floor to the bed but he was too tired to truly move. Again he could hear John shifting about above him.
I turned my head back to Jo. She was standing, moving across the room to me with him close behind.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Always so dramatic.” Marjorie shook her head. “Dr Watson moved out of Baker Street over a year ago. She has a flat across town now.”
Thank you to everyone for reading and commenting on this story. I have always loved this movie and while re-watching it thought it would be great as a Johnlock. Though Sherlock's brilliant brain made it so some parts of the movie didn't work but I think it all worked out in the end. Thanks again for reading. Enjoy! <3
Welcome back to chapter 2! So happy that everyone is loving the story so far. <3 I hope you all enjoy this next chapter. I love John in this story with his sarcasm and his mind Sherlock. <3
It was déjà vu. Only he had been the one leaving last time. Sherlock decided not to follow the pattern and rushed out the door. He could see John still in the drive. “John Hamish Watson!”
"It is most likely that he has been discovered and taken by Moran. I should think starting there would be next."
"Sherlock, I need you to promise me something," John started softly.
He had no strength in his body; it felt small, tiny, like it wasn’t part of him. He wanted everything to end, to depart without a whisper. To just float away like the sunbeam would as the sun set in the night sky. He wanted to withdraw without a trace, to just walk away. No one would look for him. No one would care. He could leave right now and never look back. Just a flash of light across the course of someone’s day.
"Obviously." Sherlock smiled at him. "Dinner?"
The man let out a grunt, barely waking. John took that as a confirmation, pulling his knife out and cutting Will's ties. The man slumped forward as he was freed. John lifted him carefully. "Come on, mate. I need to get you out of here somehow."
"Of course, John. I can promise that I will reach for you if the call becomes too great. Can I also ask the same of you?" Sherlock added.
I am so happy that you are all loving this story. I love the comments I receive after each chapter. Only 3 more chapters left after this!
The base where Mycroft was almost certain they were keeping the agent was only a half an hour drive from the house.
Sherlock looked down at the cup in his hand before following John and taking his own chair across from him. "John, I-"
I took several steps forward, raising my hand before I even knew I was moving.
“I was under the impression that you were happy with the direction of your life.” Sherlock took another sip, giving himself something to do, while watching John’s reaction over the top of his glass.
Sherlock sipped from his cup, watching John over the top of it. "What if I was to say I was hoping for something different between us as well when you moved back in and the fact that nothing has changed has me reaching for the needle..."
Always yours,
Sherlock could only hope that John had gone to bed for the evening. It had only been two months since John moved back in after Mary left and he didn’t need to see what Sherlock had become during his time away. The darkness had been lingering on the edge of Sherlock’s mind all day. Working at the lab hadn’t changed it. He had procured the drug on his way home from St. Barts. He now sat on the floor of his room, leaning against his bed. The needle in hand, he was ready to disappear, to forget for a while.
“Sherlock? Bloody hell, I have the wrong house don’t I?” John grew quieter. “Fuck, I should have stayed at the pub. I should have just-- what am I doing here?”
John looked down then back up at him. "Yes, I did. Is that okay?"
"I'm saying you don't have to do this alone if you don't want to." John held his breath as Sherlock seemed to be thinking it over.
“Sherlock, I--,” John dropped his head to his hands. Watson moved closer to John, his nose nuzzling at John’s arm. He whined as John ignored him. “I don’t know how to… Why didn’t you tell me you were back?” There was something in John's voice.
"What? I thought the Great Sherlock Holmes never guesses." John chuckled as he kissed Sherlock again.
Sherlock nodded. Not trusting his voice at all and hoping John’s next question wouldn’t be why he did.
Key in the lock.
Sherlock stopped, his hands on the counter as he hung his head. "Why not?" His fingers gripped the counter tightly. He had nothing to live for anymore. The darkness was closing in on him. He had John but he really didn't. It was a daily struggle to keep up appearances and he was no longer the man he used to be. He had demons and a darkness that would fell a normal man. All he wanted was to reach out and hold the man standing behind him. But just because John had moved back in didn't mean he wanted Sherlock like that.
I turn to see my sister’s wife, Grace standing in the door. She knew I was alive during the last years, but I haven’t seen her until now. She is a kind, soft person. Perfect for my sister. A contrast to the sometimes harshness Marjorie projects. I knew her before she met Marjorie. She had pulled me out of drug hazes and bolt holes years ago then gave me cases to work when I was clean. During one of those cases she met my sister.
“No,” John’s face reappeared from his hands. “It’s more than that.”
I decide not to linger and continue my descent to the kitchen where they are.
Chapter 5
John looked up from his phone out the window on his right side, catching the glare of lights. He could see a delivery van sliding through the intersection, headed straight for his side of the cab. Time seemed to slow down. His mind blank, the only thought he had was; he had made it through war with only a bullet wound in the shoulder and now he, John Watson, was going to die in the back of a taxi.
Welcome to another chapter of Scarlett and Jo. I hope you enjoy. Thanks very much to my betas @cherieftpotter and @fuckoffwatson1 for their help with this story. <3
Two people filled with a darkness. Each so sure there is no light at the end of the tunnel. One searches for the light in a syringe, the other with his firearm.
John made only one stop on his way to Serbia and that was to change his appearance. Dark brown hair, almost black and contact lenses that made his eyes green instead of blue. Mycroft had supplied what he needed in a safe house just outside Serbia. John stowed most of his gear here, taking only what he really needed moving forward. He would come back when he found Will or if he needed to regroup.
“Now, shall we try that again?” he asked, taking a sip of tea, carefully. He wished it was something stronger but he had to be careful.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometime later John woke up tied to the same chair he had helped Vlado out of. He swore, testing the ropes at his hands and feet.
“Scarlett,” Marjorie is speaking again. “Scarlett, listen to me. He is saying you did it.”
“For what my love?”
I am a man being torn in two. I want you to be happy always, even if that is not with me. Though my heart breaks even just writing the words.
“Is he here?” John looked up meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
"Yes. Oh god yes." John kissed him again, harder this time. Soon they were both gasping for air. They broke apart giggling.
“John, I didn’t mean - I wasn’t going to say anything. I know how you feel about me and I know the life I was headed for would be far too quiet for you.”
He reached out, pulling John closer and finally up into his lap as they continued to kiss.
Sherlock stayed there for a moment pressed against the smooth surface. He wanted to open it back up and ask if John would just lay with him. Just so he didn’t have to be alone anymore... A scratching at the wood reminded him that Watson wanted in. Sherlock moved, opening the door so that Watson could join him. He was disappointed to see that John had already walked away. At least, someone would be with him tonight, just not the one he had been wishing for.
"Well good luck with that, seeing how I don't know the man and he isn't likely to come looking for me. We may have a long wait." John felt more at ease then he had in months. Standing in front of Moriarty's right hand, smoking a cigarette, waiting to die.
Pulling his phone free of his pocket, he fired out a quick couple of texts.
One day later, Sherlock stood in the sitting room looking around 221B one last time. Mycroft had sent him several choice cottages far from the city and Sherlock had chosen one. Today was his moving day. Sherlock had shown Mycroft’s minions what to pack and sent it ahead. One of Mycroft’s cars was now downstairs waiting to drive him to Sussex.
"It depends on what you are hoping I am saying," Sherlock stammered. He could feel his heart ripping through his chest. The erratic beating had him checking his own pulse at his wrist, teacup long forgotten beside him.
"I think he will come for you. Mycroft won't let Dr. Watson die, not after losing his brother." Moran sneered.
“What about your partner?” Sherlock asked, his mind wanting to know what his heart didn’t want to hear. “Where are they in all of this? And no, I don't."
Thank you to the few of you reading this story. I hope you enjoy this chapter. I am having to much fun writing about these girls. Things are going to be dicey for them for a while but there will be a happy ending. Because Scar and Jo deserve happiness.
“This is my fault. You know it is.” My sister’s voice drifts up to me.
“Who?” Sherlock was taken aback by how John had calmly changed his questions. Then he realised who John thought was here. Is that why he had showed up acting so drunk? Sherlock wasn’t sure how to react. His hands shook a bit. “No. No one is here aside from us and Watson. Why are you here, John?”
It had been a year now since Sherlock passed away and John missed him every second. They had lived each day like it was their last up to the end. Sherlock had made John promise that he would continue their life when he was gone. He taught John how to care for the bees and how to make honey.
A self-serving one, you would say if you were here. But you are not…
John's face fell a bit. Maybe he had read it wrong. Flatmates? Everyone started somewhere did they?
“Only a little,” John joked as he wobbled on his feet. “Easy pup, you are going to knock me down.”
Sherlock POV.
. Why would she move? Did she care nothing for the life we had built together at Baker Street?
"This." John leaned forward pressing his lips to Sherlock's.
At that his cell began to ring.
Sherlock turned his phone off, dropping it to the floor. He couldn’t close his eyes. This only made him think over the last few hours in vivid detail.
Sherlock paused. Should he tell the truth now?
“I need to see the hospital report!” I shout as I enter.
He hung his head before untying and sliding everything under the bed. “Yes, John?” He stood to open the door.
“How in the fuck are you even here? What the hell!” she was angry. She is so beautiful when angry with her eyes flashing. I glanced towards him to see a look of surprise at her language.
John hadn’t been with him the day he was hit and already felt guilty about that. Sherlock was able to hide his headaches since John wasn’t around much.
Not a soul would miss him… Except one, he hoped...
Again, the man stirred, this time he turned over to face John. John took in the sight. The man was dressed in a posh black suit, with pale skin, sharp cheekbones and
John shook his head. “No,” John gestured his hand at Sherlock. “Who are you even? Over a year ago, you dropped a bomb on me and before I could even wrap my head around it, you disappeared and I couldn't find you. When I finally do, you’re living this perfect life. Perfect house, perfect honey company, perfect boyfriend, sitting there so calmly.” John threw his hands up in the air. “Then in comes me. One trainwreck after another. Barely holding a life together at this point.”
“It says all the damage was to his left side, meaning the person that hit him was right handed.” I look at both of them to see if they understand my excitement.
“You!” I yell.
"I need you to take care of this last person. If you could please?” Sarah, his boss asked before turning to leave his office.
"Not drugs, John." Sherlock wasn't sure how to say what he needed to. "I mean- if you feel the need to- if the darkness gets bad, please let me help you."
How does one write such a speech for the man he loves when that said man is about to marry another?
"I should have done this a long time ago," John whispered.
“She’s not there anymore.”
Here we are at the end of this story. I want to thank my wonderful betas again without them this story would not be what it is today. Harmony and Meer were amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you! This story was writing for Fandom Trumps Hate auction. It was my first year offering a story and I have enjoyed it a lot. It has been a journey over the last two weeks reading all your wonderful comments. Thank you so much for taking a chance on this story with less then amazing tags. I hope you enjoy the ending. Feel free to leave comments on here or on my twitter @octoberisblue or on both. I love hearing what you thought. Alright without farther ado, the final chapter is here. <3 <3 <3
John stood his hands full of supplies as Sherlock reached out catching his arm. There was a look in his eye, a question. John leaned down catching Sherlock’s lips.
"What if I can't find him?"
Not that there was a time Sherlock had deserved John. Sherlock always wanted what he couldn’t have since the first day he met John at St. Barts. John never expressed any emotions that said he felt the same, so Sherlock had kept his love quiet. He hadn’t wanted to lose John because he couldn’t restrain himself.
, his mind shouted. Shaking hands in his hair, pulling.
Thank you to everyone for reading this little Christmas story of 221b ficlets. I hope you enjoyed.
"Done what?" Sherlock could barely speak.
“Oh please,” I scoff.
As he lay on his side, facing the back of the sofa, his head felt heavy. His insides fought against him, churning and turning, making him feel as though he rode a small boat on the high waves. He could feel his body shaking, fighting him at every turn. His hands shook even now as he tried to move them slightly to touch the sunbeam that danced on a cushion in front of him.
I slide my phone in my back pocket before leaving the room.
John stood in front of him not speaking. There was something in his eyes that Sherlock couldn't read. John moved to turn the kettle off before he spoke. "Sometimes I hold my gun in my hand and think about how no one would miss me if I just finished what the sniper started."
“Scar?”
Sherlock stood, then moved towards his door slowly as John continued to yell for him. Watson started to bark at the noise coming from John. Sherlock paused, his hands pressed against the wood as he listened to John. He was drunk, obviously, and leaning on the door.
“Yeah, right.. Flatmates.” John repeated, his voice a bit flat.
"John..." Sherlock's voice was soft and shaky.
"Sherlock..." John set his cup down, rubbing his hand over his face. "Are you saying what I hope you are?" John looked up at him, tightly.
Sherlock pressed his hands over his eyes, before wrapping his coat tighter and letting sleep over take him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock?" John asked softly from where he knelt in front of him. "Just follow me. That's it. Breathe deep for me, love."
There was a boy in school that I once fancied myself enamored with, but now that I look back I'm not sure that I would describe what I felt as love.
I pull back from Grace in shame to have been caught by Mar. I promised her years ago after my last overdose that I wouldn’t entertain thoughts of taking my own life again. I wipe away the tears on my cheeks and pick at my nails, not wanting to meet her eyes.
“Good,” he nodded. Walking back in the door, Sherlock made his way to the kitchen to start the kettle, giving each of them a moment. He poured them each a cup, making John’s just the way he liked it.
I am so happy that so many of you took a chance on my story. I hope that you continue to enjoy and leave me wonderful comments even if they are just to yell about your broken heart. <3 You can always find me on twitter as well @Octoberisblue. <3 Muah
John entered the kitchen to start the kettle before stepping out the back door to call out so they knew he was up. He received several barks in reply. John smiled before returning to the kettle. He made some toast and poured the tea.
Sherlock reluctantly stepped back, opening the door wider so that John could enter. “Do come in before you fall.”
. Leave it to Mycroft to be completely unhelpful right now. John found the compound easy enough but as he watched from afar, he realised entering would be another matter.
None of this is your fault. You never asked me to fall in love with you. You showed me nothing be friendship and kindness, and I in return let my foolish heart get carried away.
The man stirred, shaking his head of dark curls as if to clear the fog from his brain. But he didn't turn or look at John.
"Look there is nothing to steal here. Do you need help? Do you need cab fare or can I call someone for you?" John tried.
“I have something to show you,” Marjorie continues. She hands me a hospital report that states Mark Morstan was treated for multiple lacerations, bruising, scratches and a broken nose earlier this evening.
“Colleges?”
“Can I-” John stopped mid-sentence as Sherlock opened the door. “What were you doing?”
“I know, but it wasn’t safe. You know it wasn’t. Now she is gone..forever…” New tears find their way from my eyes and roll down my cheeks.
John woke up later to an empty room again. The new agent hadn’t arrived yet. John made his way to the loo, taking a piss, brushing his teeth and dressing for the day. After a small breakfast and a cigarette, he checked his phone for new messages. Nothing new from Mycroft either. John decided to study the packet on Moran again while he cleaned his guns. Reading it front to back several times, John learned everything he could. Putting his guns away, John turned on the telly for a while. He was starting to go mad at all the waiting.
The door on the left opened as Marjorie’s PA Anthony entered carrying a suit bag and my Belstaff. I couldn’t help the sigh that escaped my lips. It was like seeing an old friend once more. Not Anthony, he was as cold and calculating as my sister. But my Belstaff.
“I should hide Mycroft’s laptop for that little stunt he pulled after dinner,” Sherlock slipped his fingers under John’s sweater. “He knew very well what he was doing.”
“John…”
“You want me to give you a lift?” Lestrade asked as John got to his feet.
John was already working on his second cookie when Sherlock returned carrying their largest coffee cup. He waited patiently as he sent off a few more texts, going by the ping noises, before he put the phone into his back pocket and looking at John, then down at the paper bag with the Millie’s insignia on the front.
So it's definitely been awhile since my last update, and I can't promise that updates will be fast, I've got a few family things going on right now and as a result my muse has been spotty lately, but I'm going to do my best to try. I've got an outline and I know where I want the story to go.
Both glasses were promptly filled and the bottle left to breathe on the table between them. He walked away to let them peruse the menu. Sherlock let his glass sit for a bit and watched John take a tentative sip.
“I saw a poster for it and thought it would be fun…” Sherlock answered. “You don’t think it’s childish?”
With Sherlock. It felt good. So good and waking up in his bed. Waking up and seeing Sherlock in his own home. He regretted ignoring the urge to just curl up next to him while he worked.
Sherlock grinned and quickly joined him in bed as John got comfortable on his back. Sherlock carefully straddled his thighs and scooped out some of the lotion and rubbed it between his hands so it wouldn’t be cold and gently started to massage it into the taut skin.
“Pregnant?” John repeated.
“Afternoon gentlemen, how are we feeling today?” Dr. Wright smiled as she walked into the room.
John looked skeptical but sighed. “What am I doing then?”
The place Sherlock took John for a date is called Bleeding Heart and is a French restaurant and as for the second part of their date I'll let you all guess where they might be going~
“Sherlock, you’re head's in the way,” John finger’s grazed the back the detective’s head in an effort to get him to move and Sherlock suppressed a small shudder.
“John.”
“This had better be good,” he greeted in a clipped tone.
Sherlock coughed and tried not to choke on his biscuit. “Really mummy?” Sherlock coughed. “You couldn’t have waited until after I finished my biscuit?”
“You took the liberty?” John raised an eyebrow.
John swallowed as his cheek flushed a deep scarlet and nodded. “Yes...if I could just have them I will get out of your hair…”
They each thanked the waiter as he brought out their starters and refilled their wine glasses.
John awkwardly shuffled over. “Eh...If I could just have my jacket please...I’ll be out of your hair.”
John looked like he wanted to say something but movement in the doorway made him stop and instead he smiled as he turned his head.
John rubbed his eyes with one of his hands and nodded. “Yeah, I know...we should get going, if we wanna make it on time.”
Sherlock took another bite of the sandwich as a response. “Why can’t you care less?”
John looked down as Sherlock began to stir and checked the time on his phone. Almost two hours had passed since he passed out, though, as Sherlock opened his eyes, they appeared less bloodshot than before.
“So what if I was?” the man replied.
“What makes you think I got you one?” John asked.
“What was that?” Sherlock smiled innocently.
“M’not,” Sherlock shook his head. “I use nothing.” He flung his arms out in an attempt at overdramatics and knocked the bottle of wine over. He blinked and watched the red liquid seeping out onto the sheets.
“Probably not no,” Sherlock answered as he opened the door to lead outside.
P. S. Smut is not my forte lol
“Sorry, sorry I know I’m late,” John apologized as he sat down across from Sherlock. “There was a bit of an incident at the surgery and some people are not meant to be doctors.”
“That’s...that’s very noble of you,” Sherlock smiled a bit. “I wouldn’t last a day in the military.”
“Sounds like an excellent idea,” John nodded. “It was a long drive.” He feigned a yawn and laughed at Sherlock’s frown. “I’m just teasing love. Believe me, it’s hard enough keeping my hands off of you right now. I am craving more than just sugar in my tea.”
“Oh come off it,” Moran rolled his eyes. “Much rather you be actually coherent for that bit.”
“While I’m appalled at the lack of self-respect you have shown, it’d break mother’s heart to find out what you’ve done,” Mycroft told him. “Though you’re free to tell her the truth yourself.”
“You will.”
“I love you too,” John smiled.
Sherlock relaxed and let out the breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. John smiled amusedly as he moved the stack of papers into the ‘graded’ section of Sherlock’s file organizer.
“Smoke an entire pack of cigarettes,” Sherlock answered.
The room was plunged into relative darkness and he picked up the remote. He turned on his heel to face the room and brought up the first slide.
“Tonight was amazing Sherlock,” John reached up to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “I just, you didn’t have to spend so much money on dinner, and I can’t imagine what those tickets cost you.”
John chuckled and after a bit more gentle prodding from Mrs. Holmes he took off his coat and made his way to the sitting room and sat on the couch. Sherlock came down a couple minutes later in a dark green sweater with a pair of dress slacks and barefoot in socks. He set the presents they’d pick up before driving down and John titled his head to the side and bit his lip watching the detective bend over to arrange the boxes.
“Just breathe John,” Sherlock repeated gently. “It’s alright. I’m here. I’ve got you.”
“Six,” John nodded. “Can’t wait.”
“I think you’re overreacting,” Sherlock finally said. “Come back to bed and we can talk about it.”
“Sorry…” he mumbled and put his phone back in his pocket.
He made a hasty exit and shut the front door behind him firmly. He should’ve known the man was with someone. No one that gorgeous was alone. And he’d been stupid enough to fall for those charms.  He caught a taxi back to the dorms and sank down into the seat with his heels pressed against his eyes.
“For you? Always,” John answered as he turned to face him.
John chuckled. “I seem to recall similar words in a different context when we first met. What was it you said? ‘Who’d want me for a flatmate?’”
“I’m sure my parents knew but well, they never walked in on Mycroft with a cock halfway down his throat,” Sherlock replied matter of fact.
“Too many clothes,” Sherlock panted as he tugged at John’s sweater. “Off off off.”
John nodded and stepped inside while Sherlock turned and took the steps two at a time to reach his flat.
“We’re not together,” Sherlock said.
he thought bitterly.
“Oh, er, that’s actually my blog,” John chuckled. “You’ll have to forgive me for not standing to meet you but well,” he patted his stomach with a smile. “Couple pounds of baby and all that.”
“Yeah?” John fiddled with the button on Sherlock’s jacket. “The one with the marshmallows and pieces of cone and caramel?”
So I tried to do my best with showing what Sherlock is thinking about.
“I assume these are yours then?” the woman held up his red briefs with one perfectly manicured finger and smirked.
“Saw some questionable texts to one of the guys on the rugby team, and some pictures, wasn’t hard to put two and two together,” John answered. “To be honest I couldn’t care less.”
“No last name?” he asked.
“I think it’s admirable,” Molly said as she glanced up from the Petri dishes she was working with. “More time to spend with Sherlock and get ready for the baby.”
“I was busy.”
John smiled and reached down to take Sherlock’s hands in one of his own and brought it up to kiss his knuckles.
“I’m gonna be sick,” John covered his mouth.
“Yes, you have successfully convinced me,” John nodded. “I will set an appointment with one of the doctors at the surgery to be on the safe side….You know...insemination is going to be expensive and there’s no guarantee it’s going  happen on the first try.”
So, a bit of a brief cliffhanger for our boys with the last chapter. But now onto some light fluff and future plannings, and a little visit from big brother.
“There’s no one I’d want to do this with except you,” Sherlock told him. “I mean that John.”
“I am calling absolute bull shit. Phone. Now,” Sherlock demanded.
“Don’t you have biscuits to bake Mrs. Hudson?” Sherlock asked as he put his coat on and buttoned up.
“Sherlock, John, this is DI Angela Monae,” Lestrade introduced. “This is Sherlock and John.”
“Will you stay?” John interrupted softly.
“Fine,” Sherlock nodded and walked over to join him. He pulled on his own coat and wrapped the scarf around his neck. John did the same with his own, he’d gone with the black wool scarf Sherlock had also picked out.
“Sure, I can patch you up again.” John started picking up the extra bandages off the floor.
"No, not only your brain, git. If you were really here, I would..." John paused, thinking about things he would do if Sherlock was really there with him. Like pull him close and kiss him until everything else falls away. Until it was just the two of them... "Never mind, let’s go." John shouldered his pack.
"Sherlock, can I ask why?" John followed behind him.
"Yes, I believe we are. Is that okay?" John questioned.
“Well, good morning to you as well.” Marjorie sips her tea.
“I think you know why,” She replies, pressing a kiss to my forehead.
“Sherlock, will you turn around and talk to me?” Mycroft was righting the knocked-over coffee table.
He hoped that there was only one captive here otherwise Mycroft's words that he would know Will when he found him would be moot. As he entered the brick building another guard questioned his purpose and where he was headed. John quickly focused on remembering his Serbian and responded that he was headed for duty over the captive. The man gave him a hard stare before stepping out of his way. John hoped the relief didn't show on his face as he continued in the direction the guard had nodded towards. He followed the hallway until he reached a guard standing outside a door.
“What?! How? I haven’t seen him since The Landmark! I promise Mar!” I can’t stop my thoughts from screaming in my head.
Pulling his coat collar up around his ears and taking a last deep breath, Sherlock turned towards the door and straight into John’s watching eyes.
After Sherlock passed, John found the bees comforting, but he was no beekeeper. He let Mrs Taylor’s nephew harvest the honey each season instead.
“John,” he started. “Why are you here? Is it only to catch up and see an old friend?”
“Really, sister dear. You should wear a shoe more appropriate for that suit.” Marjorie waved a hand towards Anthony. He pulled my shoes from a bag near his feet, handing them over as I glared at him.
Sherlock took one more turn around the flat, committing everything to his mind palace. He had left everything for John, only taking his clothes, books and research. He had left their chairs sitting across from each other. He didn’t have the heart to break them up.
I raise my right hand to show its slightly curled form with it’s black and blue bruising and lack of ability to close properly. “Everyone knows I’m right handed. But no one knows that my hand is injured to the point that it's unusable.” I smile triumphantly.
"I- yea- yes it is." Sherlock's heart was soaring now.
"You- You called me love?"
"What are you saying, Dr Watson?"
Sherlock's heart skipped at John's use of the endearment so casually. He couldn't have meant it. Just a slip of the tongue.
“We are going to fix this, don’t you worry.” She is warm and bright, much like sitting in a south facing window with the sun shining through. I hold her tightly. I want to believe her, she has never lied to me. But I see no way of fixing this. Jo is so mad that I am still alive. Maybe I shouldn’t be.
“Henry was a long time ago, love.” She soothes.
I sat straight in the chair, trying to keep my injured back from touching anything. Marjorie regarded this with a watchful eye. She had almost been too late in Serbia. I could see from her gaze the regret she felt. I tried to keep my wincing to a minimum at the very least.
“Scarlett?” Someone sits next to me. Soft, quiet. I squeeze my eyes shut tightly. “It’s going to be okay.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank you so much to everyone reading along, I know it's not always easy with me due to my angst and love for cliffhangers, but I want to say thank you for that and for your comments. They make my day. <3 Enjoy this next chapter. <3
“Where are they?” I demand. “What did you do with them?”
The man nodded before heading in the direction John had come from. John waited outside the door for several minutes to make sure no one was coming back before grabbing the key and letting himself in the door. Tied to a chair with his head lolled to one side was a dark curly haired man. John's heart stopped beating.
First, he needed a place to live that was out from under his brother's watchful eyes.
"Yes?" John replied, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as the cozy flat disappeared and his desk at the clinic that he was currently sitting at reappeared.
“I’m sorry.” John whispered, his eyes dropping to the floor.
John cleaned up his breakfast and put on his shoes. It was Sunday. Sunday was Sherlock’s day. He picked a handful of flowers on his way through the garden before heading down the road. Both dogs followed along stopping to sniff here and there. As they entered the cemetery, John saw Mr Wilson leaving.
"I have never touched drugs, so you don't have to worry, love."
“Good morning, boys. Have you been visiting Mrs Taylor again?” John smiled, patting both before giving each a small piece of his toast.
Listen to me, I sound like a love-struck teenager. Pathetic. My only comfort is knowing you will never read any of these.
Okay so this story has taken on new life. What started as a dribble is growing into something more. Much like a lot of my stories tend too. lol I hope you will join me on this journey. I don't know at this point how many chapters there will be or where Scarlett is going to take me but I do think it's going to be a fun ride. I want to thank the wonderful Paia for being my beta and proof reader. She is amazing. ❤ Leave me a comment and let me know what to think about this story so far. I hope you enjoy reading about Scarlett and Jo as much as I love writing about them.
“Oh... oh this is good!” Grace exclaims, turning to Marjorie. “We can clear her, right?”
Vlado moved towards him, the gun aimed at John's heart. "Let's go, doc." Vlado waved the gun towards the door he and John had just left.
“Better.”
I laced them quickly, wiggling my toes in their comfiness. I must have grinned while doing it as I could hear Marjorie’s huff from across the room.
I let out a frustrated cry. All I wanted was Jo. I just wanted to go back to what our life used to be. Me and her against the rest of the world.
“She has an eight o’cock reservation at the Landmark tonight. But do be careful, little sister. You may not be well received.” Marjorie stepped up beside me, laying a hand on my arm. “Caring is not an advantage.”
John laid a hand on top of Sherlock's headstone. “Hey my love, miss you. Wait until you hear the week I have had.” John sighed, letting out a laugh as he placed the flowers next to the stone. “First Mr Curtis was back. Yeah, I know he has nothing wrong with him, but he read this doctor site on the internet and well, you know how the rest goes.” John sat down on the bench, a dog on each side of him. “So that was just the start to my week."
He paused, looking down at the tie on his arm and the needle in his hand.
“My office, top left side.” Marjorie stands, following me down the hall to her office. “Is there a reason you’re not dressed?”
If he was being honest, John was becoming too busy for cases anyways. He was always staying with his girlfriend or at work. Sherlock had taken to doing cases alone most days, which was how he ended up here. It had started with bad headaches. Piercing just behind his eyes. They would render him useless for whole days. Mycroft had stepped in and insisted that Sherlock see a doctor. Someone besides John was Sherlock’s only condition. He didn’t want John to know.
Returning to the sitting room, he found John back in the chair and Watson sitting beside him. Sherlock sat the tea next to John before taking his seat again.
"You don't know how long I have wanted to do that." John smiled, his hand running along Sherlock's jaw.
"John, with you I won't need it," Sherlock started.
“Sherlock, I require an answer from you and soon. If I am expected to make the arrangements.” Mycroft stood, moving towards the door. Not once had Sherlock looked his way. Still staring at the back of the sofa. At the ever-flickering sunbeam…
Goodbye.
"Sherlock, no stop. You were doing so well. With me, breathe with me, love."
Sherlock turned to face him again. "What do you mean if I would care?"
It takes me two seconds to flag down a taxi and give them Jo’s address. Now to wait and think about what to say.
John still went to the farmer’s Markets on Saturday mornings once a month but not to sell their honey. He kept all of the honey Sherlock had made, using it sparingly so he wouldn’t run out. That was his alone.
“Where will she be tonight?” I asked, taking one more glance in the mirror to check my appearance, straightening the collar of my white blouse.
smile before resting his head back.
How could he even be proposing if he didn’t know that about her? She saw my glance towards him. It made her draw back from me, her anger subsiding.
On this quiet night in the darkened rooms of 221B, one thinks about slowly sliding the needle into his vein, looking for the soothing rush of a quiet mind. The other sits on the edge of his bed just above the first with his firearm in hand. The smooth, cold metal is a comfort to the darkness in his mind.
Dear John,
Sherlock knew what he would do even before his mind decided. He took a deep breath, unlocking the door and opening it slowly to keep John from falling over.
Sherlock couldn't believe what he was hearing. His back was still to John as he listened to John fix two cups of tea.
And I am back with chapter two of this two sweethearts. I hope you enjoy these small glimpses into the lives of Scarlett Holmes and Dr Johanna Watson, because I love writing them. <3
My body is racing. I can’t sit still, my legs are restless and carrying me around Mar’s sitting room at a terrifying pace. Jo hasn’t answered my texts. My phone is still gripped tightly in my hand. Every vibration has me jumping out of my skin, but it's never from Jo.
I check the time, it had been four hours since I saw him with Jo and an hour since Jo texted.
After the loo, John dressed in a jumper (that Sherlock had given him for their first Christmas together) and jeans. Country living suited him. He had started helping out at the local doctor’s office and eventually took over when Doctor Edward retired.
The park around him was dark and gray, making him more depressed and just wanting to be done with it all. To not be alone anymore.
John enjoyed tending to the small scrapes, rashes and cuts that he saw each day. His off days were spent with Sherlock and Watson in the garden or reading by the fire.
He wanted freedom from the darkness that controlled his sleeping hours. He rarely slept normally but now he feared closing his eyes. He just wanted to go back to before everything. Before the jump. Before he lost his best friend. But most of all before he fell into unrequited love with his best friend…
Before I even had a chance to ponder this thought, I saw her.
Always yours,
“I have thought a lot about… about us.” John started. “I was angry for a while that you would drop that on me and then disappear without taking me with you. Out having an adventure, saving the world, not needing me.” John shook his head.
So happy that so many of you took a chance on this story! I hope you all enjoy chapter 2!
“Yes, yes. Wouldn’t do to miss a Sunday. You’re early this week?”
As the man passed him, he turned his head, catching John's eyes. John couldn’t help his stare, it was like everything slowed down. The man’s cyan colored eyes were enough to take John’s breath away, surrounded by pale skin that even at night in the shadows he could see. Topped off with dark curls that bounced as he ran.
“Uhm, yes. Quite,” Sherlock bumbled. “What did you say?” Sherlock pressed a hand to his temple. “Actually, might we continue this conversion tomorrow? I find that I need to lay down.”
John was finally able to flag down a taxi. Jumping in, he told the man the name of the pub, then set about sending Mike a text.
This must have been what Marjorie was trying to warn me about.
“You don’t know that!” I scream, standing up. I push away from them both. “She will never forgive me now! She will hate me forever! I have truly lost her…” I lose all hope at the end and my voice drops to a hushed whisper. “She is gone.” Turning from the room, I make my way up the stairs and down the hall. I see nothing around me. My feet take me to my room where I crawl into bed fully clothed, only kicking off my shoes.
John shrugged. "I know that you wanted me to move back here after Mary and I broke it off, but for what reason? You seem to have less to do with me since I moved back in. I thought, well... I don't know what I thought really, but nothing happened. We were just us but different now. You have been more closed off than before and I don't know how to live with that. I know it's not fair to you. It's not your fault that I feel like this..." John scrubbed a hand across the back of his neck, looking down. "Here." He handed Sherlock a cup, moving towards the lounge and his chair.
“Jo,” I whispered, softly. I didn’t think she could hear me, but her head turned and our eyes connected. I could hear her gasp as her hand flew to cover her mouth.
A sigh. Footsteps. Seventeen stairs and then a door closing.
Now Sherlock had his diagnosis. It was a small brain aneurysm. Doctor recommended no stress and low blood pressure. This had prompted his decision to move out of the city to a simpler life.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherlock loved John too much to ask him to give up everything. Even though it was one sided and friendship was all that John was offering. Sherlock decided that John deserved more.
In a flash the man was gone and John was again alone like before.
Thank you everyone for reading, commenting and loving this story! I hope you all join me for part two! It will not be done through letters but instead follow John's journey.
John moved quickly to the man's side, kneeling down he lifted the man's face only to find the features didn't fit. The cheekbones and nose were all wrong, but from a distance that man could have been Sherlock.
"Yes?" John looked up at him gently from where he had been watching his watch, counting.
Sliding into my black bespoke suit after two years of wearing everything but a suit was like slipping on a silk glove. Smooth and soft. The last piece I needed was my favorite black Converse shoes. I spun around in search of them.
“No, no it doesn’t.” John shook his head. “The truth is… God this is so much harder than I thought it would be.”
Between the two of us, I would not be known as the romantic. I am unfamiliar with the social constructs that one would seem to need to be part of such a relationship. I have never felt this way about anyone but you; I can tell you that much is true.
John wasn’t done yet. “You knew how I felt about you, yet out the door you went and I couldn’t follow you.”
“You think this is too quiet for me?” John waved his hand around the room. “You do all of that. Lie about everything you’re doing and at the last moment you decide to tell me--” John stopped his rant, sighing deeply. “After all that you decide to tell me you have feelings for me?”
With the impending day just weeks away, I find myself needing to both be as far from you as possible and also never to leave your side.
“You never forgave me for him. I know you let it go, but you never dated after him... until now...” I puzzle the last thought.
I hated him already.
I wanted to run my hands through her hair and see if the silver made the texture of her hair different. I didn’t realise how much I had missed her until now. I knew that I had missed her over the last two years, but standing here, now - the ache was different. The longing was stronger.
I wish that Mycroft had told me how happy you were before I returned. I would have chosen to stay gone instead. I could have saved myself from seeing you so happy with another.
“Yes, yes. I am awake.” I scratch behind his ears before stretching and sliding the duvet back. I listen as my body cracks and pops on the way to the loo. Stripping out of my suit, I look at my body in the mirror.
There were guards on each of the outer walls and two at the gate. He could only imagine how many were on the inside. Just as John had decided to return to the safe house and contact Mycroft, a delivery truck slowly made its way up the road. John didn't waste any time before dashing out of his cover and into the back of the truck. Not his smartest plan but it would get him inside.
Speaking of John, Sherlock needed to get going while John was still at work. Sherlock wanted to make sure he was gone before John returned. Mycroft had handled letting John know that Sherlock was leaving and Sherlock had asked Mycroft not to tell him anything of John from this point on.
There is another man with him that steps out behind me, covering my nose and mouth quickly. I fight against them but the chloroform is faster. I feel the world darken and my knees give out under me.
"Will, I need you to run," John whispered, easing the man's arm from around his neck, all the while never removing his eyes from the soldier in front of him. "I was taking him to see Moran per his order," John replied to the man, keeping his voice even.
“Oh, Sherlock. What have you done?” Mycroft was sad. Sympathetic.
Once Sherlock could no longer stand the shaking, he dug in his bag for the cocaine he carried with him. Sitting down on the bed, he tried to calm his hands enough to push the needle into his vein. After he managed, Sherlock curled up, pulling his coat around his body and let the drugs pull him under.
Now he was running out the door an hour later, hoping he could find a taxi in this rain. Mike had told him there was someone he wanted John to meet at the party. A possible flatmate. Since John was sorely in need of a new place to live, it was perfect. He just needed to get there.
Darting to Sherlock’s side, Watson pressing his nose to Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock reached his hand to pet Watson as he watched John struggle for words. “John, I never-- I never left.” His nerves made his stomach churn.
“All this time I thought you were off in some other country doing God knows what without me but instead you were here, creating the perfect life…” John sighed. “You know what, I am sorry that I came. I didn’t mean to ruin everything. I just thought… I don’t know what I thought. Nevermind. Goodbye Sherlock. ” John crossed the room and was out the door before Sherlock could react to his words.
Thank you also to my wonderful beta Paia for helping me and loving this story. <3
I find my way to the sofa, collapsing with my head between my knees.
John leapt to his feet suddenly. “What do you mean? This whole time you have been here?”
He had many fond memories of them in this room, sitting in these chairs. Which was why he had asked Mycroft to find him a place far away. Sherlock couldn’t continue living in this city and not be running the streets solving cases.
“Some more than others.” Mar sighs.
Sherlock smiled at the man in his lap. "I could hazard a guess."
“John, what are you doing here?” Sherlock asked, as John tried to right himself.
I have lost so much weight while I was gone. My ribs show terribly. I have always been more willowy, but this is basically a skeleton with skin draped over it. There are scars on my torso and back, thankfully my arms fared better.
It was only available month to month sublet as there was some mystery about the previous tenant. The landlord said the family didn't want to talk about it or something. Sherlock wasn't listening at all, the flat came furnished, which was appealing. It was a small flat, but Sherlock didn't care, he just wanted a place to hide away.
"I thought you said the Moran job was going to take two people? My Serbian is a bit rusty." John cursed his lack of knowledge with the language.
He quickly radioed for back up, just as John lashed out. The two of them tumbled to the floor, fighting for John's gun. He could hear boots running towards them, he knew he only had seconds before backup arrived, but Vlado was fighting him hard. John gripped the gun tightly, close to getting it out of Vlado's hands when there was a crack and everything went dark.
Mayday! Mayday! Bucket up!
“I’m here about the flat,”
"Sherlock? Sherlock? Calm down, please. Breathe for me." John had appeared at his side, holding Sherlock's wrist carefully, counting his heartbeats. "Sherlock, please breathe with me." John pulled Sherlock's hand to his own chest, letting him feel the rise and fall of his breathing.
I tried, though, even as I hoped you would find another man to stand up for you. A better man. A man who was not so in love with you that his heart breaks at the very thought of you not being here beside him anymore.
