Sherlock started thrusting his hips in earnest, pushing his cock further into John’s fist, the way eased by the copious amount of moisture. John moved across to his right nipple and lavished it with the same kind of attention. John’s left hand made it’s way down to grope and knead Sherlock’s arse.
Images of Sherlock’s website popped up on the screen, along with some of Sherlock’s medical records and school reports. Those soon disappeared, leaving only Sherlock’s website.
Sherlock knew there was nothing he could say now to recover gracefully from the situation so he did the only thing left to him—he ran away. Without a word he pushed the cardigan into John’s hands, wrapped his dressing gown tightly around himself, and bolted from the room without looking back. He heard John call his name but he kept going until he slammed the bedroom door behind him, and threw himself on the bed. He was going to stay inside until it all went away or, what was more terrifying and more likely in this scenario, until John went away. Permanently.
"Yes, yes, I know, he woke me up too," John interrupts the second policeman. "I'm really sorry about this," John says as he gently grips Sherlock's elbow. "Sherlock," he says softly, "we need to go inside now."
Darcy perked up at the mention of a happy ending. She wiggled out of Sherlock’s arms and settled on her back once again. She nodded to herself, a determined look on her face. Sherlock was struck, not for the first time, how much like John she looked.
John leans out of his window to see Sherlock, dressed in his suit, standing on the pavement outside the front door of 221. He stops screeching on his violin as soon as he spots John.
John covered the back of Sherlock’s hand with his own. Sherlock exhaled a slightly shaky breath, grateful for this silent support, and carried on.
Sherlock slowly got his breathing under control and relaxed his vice-like grip on John’s back and shoulders.
Now, he had to make John progress this further. Maybe he could make John hold his hand, or drape his left arm along the back of the sofa so Sherlock could snuggle up to him. Maybe John could even drape his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and kiss his head in that endearingly charming way of his. The possibilities were almost endless, and made Sherlock’s heart flutter in anticipation.
“Oh,” Sherlock exhaled softly. He let go of John’s shirt only to wrap his arms around John’s shoulders. He hid his face in John’s neck. “I’m not saying no. It’s just-- a lot. Very quickly. I would never say no, John.”
The last remnants of his dream clung to him. He was chasing someone, through a metal maze lined with lights and cables, but he couldn’t remember who it was. Someone important, someone who he had to find. He couldn’t remember why. He was lost.
“I will not mention it again. Excuse me,” Sherlock bit out and started to extricate himself from John’s grasp. He was going to shower, dress and go downstairs to breakfast, and erase this whole incident from memory. He would bury his feelings in the deepest pits of his mind palace and never inconvenience John again. He only hopes John would forget it too so they could go on as before.
“Sherlock, I love you too, I love you so much, so much,” John murmured against Sherlock’s lips. He kept saying it until Sherlock couldn’t hold back the wave of emotions overtaking him. He hid his face in John's neck, hot tears finally escaping his eyes. He breathed in John’s scent and released it in a half-sob. John
Breakfast finished, John cleaned his bowl and mug, and allowed himself a luxurious stretch. Sherlock couldn’t help looking at John out of the corner of his eye, hungrily taking in every detail of John’s exposed abdomen and the shifting muscles beneath his skin. John’s loud yawn reminded him to stop staring, and he once again tried to concentrate on blowflies and corpses.
Sherlock bit his lower lip. It was a complex question, the answer to it being too convoluted for a three year old to understand. Sherlock looked at John with a silent plea for help in navigating the issue.
“I’m here to warn you, out of concern for your well being.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at that, eliciting a heavy sigh from Mycroft. “The military is already assessing the situation, and Watson will be either taken apart or incorporated into a larger project very soon. Do not get involved.”
“In the greater scale of the universe everything is insignificant.” John stepped out of the path of Earth and started the hologram again. The Sun rotated slowly in the middle, the rest of the planets following its pace. “Do you ever miss your home?”
Sherlock had once argued, weeks ago, that they could let Darcy sleep with them on nights like these, but John was adamant she had to learn to conquer her fear in her own bed. John had put his foot down, and Sherlock had sulked for a few hours. He got his revenge though, when a few days later he convinced Darcy the best way to wake up her dad was to jump on John’s back demanding he get up.
After a few minutes John fell silent, having exhausted his knowledge of astronomy. He gazed up at the sky in wonder, smiling every time he spotted a falling star. Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off him.
“Do you remember watching this when you were young?” Mr Holmes asked his son. Sherlock shook his head without looking away from the sky. “You made wishes whenever you saw a falling star. One wish, really. You only wanted to meet another pirate to have adventures with.”
Sherlock turned his back to John and moved further towards the edge of the bed. Any further and he’d fall off. He wrapped himself up in the duvet and buried his face in the pillow, determined to fall asleep as quickly as possible and get this sleeping nonsense over with.
Sherlock’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, not wanting to finish the conversation. He had enjoyed himself, more than he had in a long time, and was loath to let it go. Even though he knew that Watson wouldn’t go anywhere, and would still be there to carry on the conversation in a few hours. Sherlock hoped the AI didn’t decide he was a dullard after all, moving on to find something, or someone, more interesting.
“I missed you,” he said quietly, still looking down at his lap, hands twisted in the silky fabric. Maybe if he couldn’t see John’s pained eyes he could find the courage to say everything. “The flat was too empty. But now—now it’s home again. It’s never home when you’re not here.”
“Mmm, of course not.” Sherlock could hear the smile in John’s voice, and then felt it against his forehead when John kissed him there. “You don’t have to hold back, ever,” John whispered against Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock remembered giving it to John, seeing him run his fingers over it, the genuine smile that lit up John’s face when he thanked him. Sherlock remembered John putting it on, and his own heart stopping at the sight. John looked stunning, the cardigan hugging his compact but powerful frame, the colour of it making his deep blue eyes shine. Sherlock had very nearly blurted out what he had been thinking but thankfully saved himself by managing to say, “You clean up very nicely, John” in an almost completely calm voice. John had smiled at him then, beautiful and brighter than the sun shining outside, and Sherlock had to quickly turn away to button up his jacket and fiddle with his cuffs, before announcing they were leaving for John’s birthday dinner. They had spent that night alone, just the two of them sharing food and wine in the soft glow of candlelight, something tenuous and hopeful growing slowly between them.
“You have two days at most before Watson disappears, one way or another. I can protect you until then, as I have done so far. When it,” Mycroft cleared his throat and grimaced. “
“On the other side of the forest there lived a knight. The knight had recently come back from war, he had fought very bravely and was hurt badly in a battle. He couldn’t fight anymore and had to come back home. The knight was courageous, loyal, smart and strong—a true hero. But he didn’t think so himself, and after so many years at war he didn’t know how to live in a peaceful country. He was very alone and very sad too.”
Mrs Holmes was talking to John about astronomy, a long held hobby and passion of hers, while Sherlock and his father sat in comfortable silence.
Less than two hours later Baskerville Laboratories came into view. Nondescript grey buildings amidst grassy moorlands, shrouded in fog and rain. They looked like something out of a gothic novel, a place where ghosts and monsters dwell.
Sherlock sat down in his armchair, rearranging the computer to project the screen in front of him, holding a keyboard in his lap.
Later, once they had composed themselves and the reality of their situation had settled in, Sherlock helped John bathe and eat. John was still somewhat unstable on his feet, the confusion and dizziness from prolonged stasis having not worn off, but his mind was sharp. John remembered Sherlock and everything that happened since they had met just a few days ago. He had also retained his military knowledge, and curiously enough his medical expertise. Even though John had never put either of those to practice in his new body, he explained it felt like he had the dusty muscle memory to go with his knowledge. Some of his memories from before meeting Sherlock were patchy, and vast amounts of his knowledge were lost forever.
He quickly got into the MI6 archives again, and started up John’s interface program. Anxiety filled his stomach with butterflies, and he hoped he wasn’t too late.
Much later, once their sweat cooled, they lay together, still unwilling to be parted and exchanged slow, tender kisses. In a moment of candour, Sherlock confessed he had watched John undress through the bathroom door but much preferred the less blurry and more tangible version. John laughed, not unkindly, at Sherlock’s somewhat embarrassed admission, before pulling him along to the bathroom to shower together.
The front door flew open to reveal Mr Holmes with a huge smile on his face, and his ever present glasses dangling from a chain around his neck.
They couldn't stop kissing, lips only moving away long enough to caress necks, returning again to swallow moans and gasps. There was no space between them, the only words spilling out were breathless invocations of deities and each other’s names. Their bodies found a rhythm almost immediately and moved as one. Hands kept wandering restlessly across body parts, sometimes pulling and pushing hard enough to leave marks.
Sherlock let out a groan. John’s smell was so clear and powerful here, the sweet musk of sweat at the forefront. The unmistakeable maleness of it was heady; the Johnness  of it was addictive. Having had this, Sherlock would be unable to stop thinking about his next fix, thinking of ways to get into John’s personal space or how to steal his clothes.
? How dull,” Sherlock quipped, before he could stop himself. He regretted it as soon as it left his mouth, knowing his acerbic quip crossed a line into outright rude.
“Instead you’re just a giant cat, needing constant attention,” John mused. He smiled down at Sherlock. “Cat Sherlock. Cat-lock.”
“I seem to remember someone telling me not two minutes ago how much of a mood killer urine is,” she observed dryly.
Sherlock took a chance, in his mind at least, and rested his head on John’s shoulder. It was a bit bony and uncomfortable, and Sherlock grumbled under his breath.
In the wee hours of the third day Sherlock fell asleep by accident, while trying to stay awake by counting the average number of sugar crystals in Speedy’s sugar packets. A few hours later, a loud thump and a yell from his bedroom woke him.
will have no prior knowledge about what is going to happen. It’s your choice whether you tell him or not.”
Sherlock did his best to ignore the warmth of John’s hand on his hip, the warmth of the body pressed against his back, and the soft breaths against his neck. He couldn’t tell how long he stayed awake, keeping himself as still as possible and cataloguing every second, before sleep finally claimed him.
Sherlock nipped, sucked and licked, and he was painfully aware he had no idea what he was doing. The kisses were sloppy, wet and a little bit uncoordinated; Sherlock poured all of his love into them instead, and John didn’t seem to mind. John patiently showed Sherlock what to do with his lips and tongue, occasionally adding a hint of teeth, and encouraged him with pleased groans and moans whenever Sherlock did something well.
“Shut up, it’s perfect,” Sherlock said, her voice wavering, more tears falling from her eyes. “Yes, of course yes.”
“In the bedroom. It’s quite at home in the bathroom,” Sherlock retorted, scrubbing her face and yawning again.
“Well, about that,” John replied with a grin and took out a control pad from his pocket. He quickly typed in a few commands and the hologram around them shifted. The sun and the planets disappeared, the darkness receded, and was replaced by an explosion of bright colours. In the middle of a nebula, two stars orbited each other, a white giant and a smaller red giant. Caught between them was a lone planet, covered in shades of green and blue.
John was in a semi-conscious state by this time, able to use his legs well enough that Sherlock didn’t have to carry him. They made their way to the ground floor, John draped over Sherlock’s side and stumbling every few steps, and joined the stream of people leaving the main building in a hurry. No one paid them any attention; they were surrounded by scientists and technicians in all sorts of laboratory gear, and neither of them looked out of place. Even John’s semi-consciousness wasn’t suspicious as quite a few people had been hurt and were in a similar state, especially those who worked immediately above the explosion.
“Make it quick, I have things to do,” he said, slouching in his seat, making it obvious he had absolutely nothing planned.
Sherlock barged into the room to find John curled up in the farthest corner, shaking and gasping for air. A strangled, distressed sound tore itself from John’s throat.
"Ah, John, you're finally awake. Excellent," Sherlock smiles up at John. He immediately starts playing again, this time something much more melodic and soothing.
“Leeks, celery, garlic, potatoes and chicken stock,” Sherlock replies as he takes out soup bowls from one of the cupboards.
“Do try not to be so tiresome, Sherlock,” Mycroft snapped. “Save your friend and destroy any traces of the experiments, by whatever means necessary.”
“You heard me say your name,” John interrupted, his voice still gruff from sleep. His face was frustratingly blank. Sherlock squirmed under his unrelenting gaze.
The Lab still had a direct access to John, even though he appeared to be in a state of hibernation. Sherlock breathed a shaky sigh of relief, some of the panic ebbing away. He was in time, he could do it.
Well after dinner, after the sun had finally set and the cloudless sky became an endless expanse of dark dotted with stars, the Holmes family (which now firmly included John) sat outside in the back garden. The night was warm and the conditions were perfect for watching the Perseid meteor shower.
As Sherlock went about using the toilet, Jane spit out the foam in her mouth and turned to face Sherlock.
Sherlock wasted no time in getting all the documents and reports out of the folder, arranging them all over the floor, and memorising as much as he could in the two scant hours he had.
Sherlock tensed all over, too terrified to move a muscle. He had to get himself out of John’s embrace before John woke up to avoid any embarrassment for either of them. He knew John wouldn’t take it well and his painkillers would’ve worn off by now so this situation had the potential to end up in a complete disaster.
“Because we always are,” John answered simply. He reached over and cupped Sherlock’s cheek. “The prince and the knight are in love, they have adventures, and they live happily ever after.”
Another corridor, with rooms behind clear glass panels on one side, and what looked like huge black monoliths on the other. Individual rooms were filled with medical equipment and giant, empty fish tanks. No, Sherlock realised with horror,
Sherlock responded by scooting up the bed and kissing John. The angle was awkward, their noses bumped and lips met too hard. John stilled Sherlock’s head and adjusted the angle, tilting his head and moving his lips across Sherlock’s.
The police officers nod at John, get into their car and drive away. As soon as they’re gone John shoves Sherlock into 221 and locks the front door behind them. He marches upstairs to their flat and straight into the kitchen, Sherlock trailing behind him.
Sherlock circled the binary star system, clicking and whistling to themselves. They were emitting excited noises, waving their hands around, eyes taking in every minute detail. John watched on with a fond smile.
They went back to watching the film, at least John did. Sherlock was far more preoccupied with basking in John’s embrace, the feel of his skin against Sherlock’s face, and his gentle fingers in Sherlock’s hair. Feeling more sure of himself, Sherlock reached out to grab John’s right hand, and brought it to his lips. He kissed John’s knuckles one by one, then the centre of his palm.
The soft click of the front door closing shook him out of his reverie. He got up to lock the door, feeling unsure what to do next.
John added a twist of hand on every upstroke, and at the same time used his teeth and tongue on Sherlock’s nipple. His left hand wandered further down Sherlock’s arse, fingers just grazing the space between the arse cheeks. Sherlock kept pushing his cock into the tight space of John’s fist, his thrusts growing shorter and his hips losing rhythm.
John’s lips were soft. Softer than Sherlock had ever imagined. He kept them lightly pressed against Sherlock’s, not moving for a few moments, before ending the kiss. Sherlock couldn’t help making a desperate noise at the loss.
“High praise from a self proclaimed genius, I’m sure,” John replied with amusement, another smile evident in his voice. Just like that, as quickly as the spat started, it was over.
Lestrade woke up with a slight headache and a smile on his face. Not wanting to give up on sleep just yet, he wrapped the blanket tightly around himself and burrowed deeper into the sofa cushions. He heard water running somewhere in the flat, most likely John taking a shower. Forever a soldier, up the crack of dawn.
“Shush,” John whispered, as he lifted his own mug to his lips and took a careful sip. “Lestrade’s still asleep.”
Sherlock turned to see John standing in the kitchen doorway, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows and the top three buttons of his shirt undone, cheeks flushed from standing over a hot stove. He smiled at Sherlock, full of warmth and affection, and it made Sherlock’s stomach flutter. John looked devastatingly beautiful like this, even though he would protest being described as such.
Sherlock got dressed, and emerged from his bedroom to find Mycroft glaring at him from his spot next to the mantelpiece. Sherlock rolled his eyes at his brother’s attempt at intimidation, and flopped down dramatically into his armchair.
Without waiting for her to say anything Sherlock carried John upstairs, and into his bedroom. He stripped John of the lab coveralls and dressed him in one of his own pyjama sets. He was so focused on his task he barely noticed Mrs Hudson coming in with the medical bag from the car.
“When you were gone everything felt wrong. Everything. Even the smells weren’t right. And now you’re back and—” Sherlock glanced up at John. “I ruined everything. Again.”
“Sherlock, go find your father and get some pillows down from the loft. You’re in your old room and don’t worry, darling,” she added quickly before Sherlock could do no more than open his mouth. “I haven’t touched a thing, I promise.”
After a few minutes, once John’s breathing had calmed, Sherlock shuffled closer. He held out one hand to John, almost but not quite touching his knee. John looked from Sherlock to his hand, and reached out to touch it with his fingertips. He let out a quiet gasp when their skin connected.
Understanding dawned on John’s face, quickly replaced by warmth, affection and love. He gently extricated his hand from Sherlock’s vice like grip, and held Sherlock’s face between his hands.
John’s hand tightened and sped up on Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock reached down to thread his fingers through John’s hair and to make sure he didn’t even think of moving away from his chest. His other hand gripped the bedsheets so hard his knuckles turned white.
Jane’s efforts to get out of Sherlock’s grasp were fruitless. She ended up propped up on one elbow with Sherlock wrapped around her torso and legs even tighter than before. Sherlock, now fully awake, glared at Jane from under her fringe.
The lowest level was completely deserted and quiet. Whether it was by design or by chance, Sherlock paid it no mind. The walls and the floor were eerily white, the only illumination coming from thin panels embedded in the walls and from an open door at the end of the corridor. Sherlock ran towards the light. He knew he didn’t have much time, his presence would be noticed sooner or later.
“Well,” Mrs Holmes said as she got up from her chair. “I think it’s time your father and I retire for the evening. No arguments, Thomas.”
“It’s you,” Sherlock stated the obvious. The hand that had hovered above his device curled into a fist, and fell uselessly at his side. Like an addict, he couldn’t refuse his next fix.
John fell silent, but Sherlock was afraid to speak. The giant lump in his throat wouldn’t have allowed him to, anyway.
Sherlock wanted to scream and hurl the violin against the wall. Instead, he bottled up his anger and carefully put the instrument away. He had to get over this, he
Slow, measured steps ascending the stairs made Sherlock snap out of his thoughts, but he kept stomping in front of the fireplace. He snarled at the pillow lying innocently on his armchair, and threw it at the wall above the sofa, just as Mycroft appeared in the doorway.
“You’re adorable,” John leaned in to whisper. He pulled away from Sherlock with a giggle at Sherlock’s ferocious scowl, and gave Sherlock’s bum a quick pat on his way to the kitchen. “Let’s get the food.”
Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed, unable to produce any sounds. Watson had a voice. A real, human voice.
“Uh huh. Just put it on already,” Sherlock said as he walked back to the sofa and flopped down onto it.
“Just tell me no, and I will back away,” John said gently. He laid his hands on Sherlock’s hips to bring them closer together, and Sherlock gripped the front of John’s shirt.
“Sherlock, can I—can I kiss you?” John’s words were a hushed whisper. He brought his hand up to cup Sherlock’s face, his thumb caressing Sherlock’s cheekbone.
“I’ve never done this. This,” Sherlock flapped his hand in the direction of their cocks, “Or anything else, really. I don’t—I don’t know what to do.”
Sherlock heard John’s soft steps getting closer to his bedroom door. He curled himself into a tight ball on the bed and wished he could simply evaporate to spare himself the embarrassment of the conversation he was about to have.
“John. John, it’s okay. You’re safe.” Sherlock approached him with his arms outstretched. “John, it’s Sherlock, remember?”
Jane rinsed her mouth and her toothbrush quickly,  stepping aside to let Sherlock use the sink to wash her hands. While Sherlock washed her face and then squinted at her own reflection, Jane plastered herself to Sherlock’s back and hugged her.
“I wouldn’t dream of making you one, brother dear.” Mycroft let one side of his mouth twitch infinitesimally. He walked towards the front door to the flat. “You have two hours to memorise the contents of that folder, after which you are to burn it. Keep the access card to Baskerville Laboratories. A car will be waiting for you downstairs,” He paused with his hand on the doorknob. “I hope you succeed, for your sake and mine,” he said quietly, and left.
Sherlock couldn’t bear it any longer and shuffled away from John’s embrace. No matter how badly he wanted to rut himself to completion against John’s thigh, and regardless of how incredible it felt hearing John softly moan his name, he couldn’t let this go any further.
Watson was taking the piss. As much as it rubbed Sherlock the wrong way, he did huff out a breathless laugh at the… cheekiness of the AI. What a personality, indeed.
The sensation of John’s lips on his own was not something Sherlock ever managed to imagine correctly. They were softer, still tasted faintly of mint from John’s toothpaste. They were perfect, and Sherlock never wanted to stop kissing them, stop being kissed
“You’re a git,” John mutters under his breath loud enough for Sherlock to hear. Sherlock says nothing for the rest of the day.
“You would, you’re a hopeless romantic,” he muttered. He grabbed some of the stew Mrs Hudson made two days earlier and set about reheating it. “Which idiotic film are you going to make me watch tonight?”
John stood up and wobbled dangerously. Sherlock, still on his knees in front of him, held him up by his hips. John steadied himself with a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock was suddenly painfully aware of his proximity to John’s crotch.
Darcy calmed down too, her sobs and hiccoughs stopping entirely. She was still curled up against Sherlock’s chest, bundled up under the covers so that only her mop of blonde curls was visible, and held Sherlock’s t-shirt in one small fist. John had his hand over her side and belly, and she clutched two of his fingers in her hand as if still scared he might let her go. She was breathing deeply and evenly, evidently on the edge of sleep.
Sherlock wanted more, though. He wanted to feel more of John’s body heat, feel the press of his hands, his lips.
Just as Mrs Hudson opened her mouth to say more, no doubt something to embarrass Sherlock even further, the downstairs doorbell rang.
Sherlock felt a funny flutter in his stomach, the old magazines stashed in his old school trunk  jumping to the forefront of his mind. He pushed those thoughts aside, ridiculous as they were.
After nearly fifteen minutes of constant pretend fidgeting, Sherlock’s right side was pressed against John’s left, shoulder to thigh. Sherlock slumped against the cushions in relief.
“It may have been over thirty years ago, but to me it’s been days. I don’t have the luxury of a human memory, failing with age and imperfect. I can recall every second of Maiwand with crystal clarity. I can still—” John made a strangled noise. “I can still hear the terrified screams of the men I was supposed to lead,” he finished quietly.
A few hours later, all of Mrs Hudson’s biscuits gone and an army of mugs filled with cold tea strewn around the coffee table, Sherlock finally managed to gain access to one of the folders. All the others remained stubbornly encrypted and unreadable.
Once John was in the shower Sherlock would move to sit on his bed, as close to the door as possible. He would listen to John wash himself, sometimes catching half-hummed songs or John muttering, and if he was very lucky he would hear John masturbate. The sheer rush of hearing it—the rhythmic movements of John’s hand on his cock, the bitten off groans and moans almost, but not quite, lost in the sound of water hitting the tiles—made Sherlock hard so fast he’d feel dizzy. He’d pull his cock out, feeling guilty for what he was about to do but too turned on to stop, and stroke himself hard and fast. Still listening to John pleasuring himself in the shower, fingers of one hand shoved into his mouth to stop himself from moaning and the other hand a blur on his cock, Sherlock would come mere seconds after hearing John grunt as he reached his own climax.
“You’re beautiful even when you’re covered in snot.” John smiled down at him and Sherlock gave him a slightly watery smile in return. John wiped away the tears on Sherlock’s cheeks with his thumbs. “There, all good again, yeah?”
“You knew,” Sherlock mumbles accusingly against John’s lips. John grins mischievously and shuts him up with another kiss. They do not stay silent for long.
“Yes,” Sherlock laughed, his eyes stinging. He brought up his hands to touch John’s face in return. “You remember everything.”
“Keep your eyes closed.” Jane grabbed one of Sherlock’s hands, and pushed the open ring box into it. She cradled Sherlock’s hand in both of her own. “You can open them now,” Jane said, hoping the tremor in her voice wasn’t too obvious.
John brushed their noses together. “It’s a promise then. When we’re both ready. Yeah?” He waited for Sherlock to nod. “We’re not in a rush, anymore.”
He was too late. John had not hung up on him, he had been disconnected. Stupid, stupid! He should have known, he should have checked straight away. Instead he had wallowed in self pity, waiting for John to call him back.
“What you said-- the thing in the car-- when-- that is,” Sherlock huffed and pursed his lips in annoyance at his own lack of eloquence. He stepped into John’s personal space and fiddled with the front of John’s shirt. John’s hands came up to rest on Sherlock’s hips automatically and he caressed his sides in what he hoped was a soothing gesture.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock rushed to say, unable to keep quiet any longer. His voice felt raw and stuck somewhere in his throat. “I’m so sorry, John, I truly am, I didn’t mean to—I just wanted—I’m sorry, I didn’t think—I just—,” Sherlock paused to sniff, and realised that he was crying. “I wanted to make you happy. I thought I could protect you from knowing and make you happy for just a few days. I thought—I thought it would be better if you didn’t know.”
After a few seconds of shocked silence, the room erupted in heated debate that continued long into the night.
Sherlock wanted to stop, wanted to be able to stop, but his mind was conjuring up desperate scenarios where they were both awake and having lazy morning sex. Where any second now John would gasp his name and bend down to kiss him, where they would undress each other slowly and kick off the covers, where John would wrap his hand around Sherlock’s cock, where Sherlock would use his mouth to—
Mollified, Sherlock wandered out into the house in search for his father. As soon as the kitchen door closed behind him Mrs Holmes turned to John with a grin.
John’s face was illuminated by the Sun’s glow. He stood a little to the side, in the path of the orbit of Earth. When Earth approached him he held out his arms, as if to hug it, and the hologram stopped in front of his chest.
Sherlock came home to a flat bathed in the soft light of table lamps and candles, the smell of fresh curry, and the furniture rearranged to accommodate the tv on the coffee table.
“I’ll tell her you loved it. Couldn’t get enough of it. Praised her the whole night,” John said with a chuckle. Sherlock nudged him playfully with his elbow, careful not to spill their food.
The vision was gone as quickly as it appeared. Sherlock couldn’t indulge himself too much in idle fantasies, it was a dangerous train of thoughts. He climbed into the bed, making sure to leave as much space between himself and John as possible.
Sherlock inched towards John at intervals of a few minutes. He didn’t want to give himself away entirely, and appear too needy, so he made a point to act as if he was trying to get comfortable. He wiggled his hips, fluffed up his pillows, draped and re-draped the blankets over his legs—all the while moving incrementally closer to John. Who, for the most part, seemed entirely oblivious.
It made John giggle and, having never missed an opportunity to kiss the laughter from John’s lips, Sherlock leaned over to kiss John again, both making sure to make extra loud kissing noises. Darcy made pretend disgusted noises and swatted at their faces but soon enough dissolved into giggles, after both John and Sherlock turned their noisy kisses on her. The smacks turned into John blowing raspberries on her neck while Sherlock tickled her belly and sides. All three of them dissolved into helpless laughter until they were breathless.
Sherlock had considered looking for John by following his scent but that proved fruitless. Wherever he went was some time ago and his scent was too faint to be useful. Sherlock grudgingly resigned themselves to asking the onboard computer for help. They didn’t like talking to her that much, not because he had any problems with asking an AI for assistance, but Molly was always trying to be too helpful and her relentless bubbliness grated on them.
Sherlock gave up his comfortable place on the sofa in favour of pacing around the room, his computer interface projected in holographic form. The difficulty of the challenge made him buzz with frenetic energy, and the sofa was getting uncomfortable anyway.
“Stop crying, we can’t both cry,” Sherlock admonished her while grinning. Jane smiled too, and kissed Sherlock sweetly. When she drew away her face was once more serious, but her eyes twinkled with humour.
In any other place Sherlock would deem this kind of peace and tranquility hateful and boring but his parents’ house was strangely calming and soothing. Time seemed to slow down here, but not in such a way that made him want to crawl up the walls in boredom. Time felt infinite and endless in this small bubble of serenity. The older Sherlock got the more he appreciated this house and the atmosphere his parents created. He understood now that the walls of this house were filled with love and it permeated the very air he breathed, and he himself yearned for the same. He could see himself settling down somewhere like this in his old age, wherever it was, as long as John was there with him.
Sherlock kept repeating Mycroft’s words to himself, willing himself to believe them. It was for the best, after all.
Sherlock certainly didn’t expect John to enter their bedroom with a small bundle of blankets in his arms. A bundle which appeared to be sniffing and hiccoughing quietly.
John bounced lightly on the balls of his feet. “Why don’t you come over? To watch the game?” Lestrade raised his eyebrows at him. “We could grab some Chinese and a few beers. You have a day off tomorrow, right?”
Sherlock woke up fully in an instant. He could hear John breathing deeply above him, apparently still oblivious and completely dead to the world.
Sherlock laughed again, allowing a wide grin to overtake his face. Watson had managed to make him laugh more than once, not bore him to death, and made him intrigued — better than any living human being he had ever encountered.
Within minutes he had everything set up. Sherlock’s finger hovered over the start button for a few long seconds, before he slammed it down with as much force as he dared. Immediately, he could hear the equipment in the only occupied room start up.
It wasn’t even sitting slightly apart that bothered Sherlock so much, it was the issue of how to initiate contact. He knew he could touch John more freely now, not needing to pretend it was accidental or “for science, John”, but he wasn’t sure where the boundaries had shifted to.
“Piss off, Mycroft.” Sherlock went back to his furious pacing without sparing a glance at his brother.
He couldn’t tell John. It was selfish of him to keep John’s fate a secret, but why taint the last few days he had left? He could make him happy, keep him company, and then take on the burden of loss and grief himself. It was for the best.
His feet brought him to his violin case, thrown without care onto the other armchair in the room. Sherlock got the instrument out, prepared and tuned it, but no sounds came forth. He stood at the window, violin and bow ready to play, but everything in his head was silent and empty. His fingers, usually so graceful and effortless, gripped the neck of the violin too tightly.
The case had been exciting but took far longer than predicted, and they had missed the last train to London. On top of that, John had had to perform a rather spectacular rugby tackle on the suspect they were pursuing, which wouldn’t have been a problem if not for the fact that John tackled the man with his left shoulder. The suspect had been apprehended, the case got solved, but John sprained his shoulder rather badly and for once Sherlock insisted on going to the hospital rather than enduring John’s stoic agony.
“Very happy,” Sherlock replied. He watched Darcy take it all in and process it. She appeared to be making a decision about something.
“Sherlock, you—” John stopped himself as he gave Sherlock a once over. Sherlock knew the bulge in his pyjama pants was unmistakeable and incredibly incriminating. He wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole, or for a meteor to crash into the flat, or even Mrs Hudson to suddenly appear bearing food—anything to stop this agony. As it was, he was more likely to combust from shame, if the burning in his cheeks was any indication.
“Sherlock, look at me,” John said pleadingly. Sherlock didn’t budge, reasoning that not doing anything had no chances of making the situation any worse. Nothing could make this situation any worse.
Sherlock could hear John in the kitchen, putting finishing touches to the food and humming quietly to himself. John being in a good mood meant his lunch with Harry went well. She must be sticking to her rehab then, just over six months of being completely sober, and it seemed she was set on seeing it through this time. Though he would never say it, Sherlock knew the difficulties of keeping an addiction in check and felt a pang of sympathy for her efforts.
they mostly spent time on cases as John had his own domestic life to tend to. Sherlock hadn’t felt the need to go walking on his own, the prospect always making him irrevocably morose.
Sherlock slid down John’s side and settled with his head in John’s lap. He looked up at John with an impish smile, which startled a laugh out of John.
“That’s… complicated. I don’t—there’s pieces that—I don’t know everything.” John sounded frustrated. “I know the basics but there’s more to it all. There are things they kept from me, and I can’t access them. I don’t know if they somehow locked it away or—I don’t know.”
“Sure. Yeah.” John hoped his face didn’t look as miserable as his voice sounded. Sherlock looked up and studied John’s face for several seconds.
Sherlock went back to his book, and decided he would give John until the end of the chapter he was reading, and if he wasn’t back by then he would go to sleep. Middle age had definitely crept up on him—he needed far more regular sleep nowadays, especially with a toddler in the flat. And reading glasses. Although those could be used to elicit some very interesting reactions from John, unlike the need for undisturbed sleep.
“Do I need to spell it out for you?” John asked when they parted. He pulled away just far enough to speak, their faces still close enough to share breath.
Sherlock let his forehead rest against the metal casing for a while longer, waiting. After no time at all an alert sounded to signal the end of the AI transfer. Sherlock reluctantly tore himself away from the supercomputer.
“In the extremely unlikely event of a zombie apocalypse I would attempt rescuing you should we become separated,” Sherlock says that evening over Chinese takeaway.
John smiled down at the miniature Earth in front of him and cradled it in his hands, his face full of fondness and longing.
“Not at all, Mrs Hol-- Margaret,” John said hesitantly. Mrs Holmes beamed at him with pride. She handed him a bowl of partially mixed pastry and turned her attention to Sherlock.
Minutes ticked by in silence. Sherlock was close to nodding off when he felt John shuffle again. He assumed John was just getting comfortable, so when he felt a hand gently touch his hip he nearly jumped out of his skin. John moved closer, effectively spooning Sherlock, his breath making the hair on Sherlock’s nape stand up.
He opened his eyes blearily and looked around the room. Spotting his phone on the coffee table, he reached out for it to check the time. Nearly nine. Groaning, Lestrade threw the blanket over his face, desperately hoping to catch just a bit more sleep. Just before he dozed off again, Lestrade thought that, all in all, it wasn’t such a bad start to his day off.
“Come on, up you get.” Sherlock hauled John to his feet and pushed him up the final few steps to their floor. He half dragged the still giggling John to their room and dumped him on the bed.
“I’m interested in facts, John, not the romanticised version of events to titillate the public,” Sherlock scoffed. He shrugged off his coat and scarf, took off his shoes and socks, and discarded them all in a pile on the sofa. Barefoot and with his sleeves rolled up, he wandered into the kitchen in search of leftovers.
“The prince and the knight went on adventures together, travelling to nearby villages and cities to help people. The prince was very smart and quick, and the knight was strong and brave - they made a brilliant team together. They solved murders, caught thieves, and made the kingdom a safer place to live. The people loved them and were always happy when they came to help.”
Sherlock nipped to the ensuite bathroom to brush his teeth and change into his pajamas. He avoided looking in the mirror; he didn’t need to see the desperation and longing on his face at this hour.
“You look beautiful for someone who just entered middle age,” Jane said, resting her chin on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock leveled a mock glare at her in the mirror.
“How could I forget?” John gave him a watery smile before hugging him tightly. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “It’s you. Always you.”
“I meant—You’re not—.” John paused. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he opened his eyes again his expression changed to one of resolve. Sherlock knew this face meant John Watson was about to do something very brave. It could mean his heart would be shattered into a million pieces, or it could mean something he did not dare to hope.
“Come here,” John said as he lifted his left arm, only to drape it around Sherlock’s back. Sherlock hummed happily and slumped against John’s side, tucking his head against John’s neck. “You could’ve said you wanted a cuddle.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think—I thought you knew,” John said as he soothed Sherlock’s side. He looked concerned but underneath the worry there was relief.
Sherlock looked at John, seeing the same thoughts and questions running his mind, the same uncertainty evident on his face.
Jane scooted closer to Sherlock, and kissed a path up her arm to her shoulder, then down her back. She kissed her way back to Sherlock’s face, finishing with a chaste kiss on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
Sometime later he was woken up by the smell of coffee and toast. He could hear John puttering about the kitchen, trying to make as little noise as possible. Lestrade heard a door open somewhere in the back of the flat and a shuffling Sherlock came into view a few moments later. He was dressed in his pyjamas and blue dressing gown, and didn’t seem to notice Lestrade as he flopped down into a chair. Just then John came out of the kitchen, fully dressed and carrying two mugs of coffee and a plate of toast. He set down one the mugs and the plate in front of Sherlock, whose only response was to yawn loudly. Lestrade couldn’t think of a time he’s ever seen the detective yawn.
Sherlock slammed the front door of 221 Baker Street closed, and leaned back against it. His breath came out in pants and gasps, deep giggles caught somewhere in his chest. He bent over double, hands on his knees, and gave into laughter.
Perhaps John was waiting for him to initiate? John, ever the gentleman, wanted and possibly expected sex, but was willing to let Sherlock set the pace. Was he though? Or was he simply uninterested? Did John realise their sex life was lacking and decided to forego it?
In early 2020 the British army, along with MI6, had started work on an AI capable of strategic and tactical planning, and routine patrol mission command. John was supposed to be the brains, the command centre of missions in enemy territory, leading soldiers from a safe distance. The ultimate goal of the Watson project were units of specially created soldiers with a shared consciousness - organic bodies hosting the Watson AI, masses of empty vessels able to carry out dangerous assignments.
“We were—we were scared.” John huffed out a quiet laugh at Darcy’s disbelieving look. “I was scared Sherlock didn’t love me like I loved him. It was—well— terrifying. Your dad was everything to me. I was afraid I would lose him and I couldn’t risk it.”
“Because we aren’t as brave as the prince and the knight,” John answered, Darcy’s inquisitive gaze fixed on him. “We didn’t know we loved each other.”
Sherlock flopped down onto his sofa, fresh biscuit between his teeth, and spilled crumbs everywhere. Not that he cared. There’d be something along to clean up the slight mess soon enough.
“I have to get up,” Jane tried to placate her. She dropped a chaste kiss just above Sherlock’s eyebrow. “I need the loo.”
Watson fell silent, and so did Sherlock. He knew he wasn’t in any real danger, whatever alarm could be raised, he had Mycroft to get him out of trouble. He was far more interested in talking to Watson a bit more. Although they had only exchanged a few sentences, the AI was fascinating. There was more to it, apart from the expected intelligence, a true personality lurking beneath the military attitude.
Sherlock finally found a way to get Watson online, in theory at least. He had no idea whether flicking a switch on Watson’s interface would do anything, the AI could’ve been cut off from everything but a power supply for all he knew.
Sherlock slowly surfaced from the post-orgasmic bliss to return John’s soft kisses. They spent some minutes kissing unhurriedly, taking their time to enjoy the quiet intimacy of it. When Sherlock finally opened his eyes John was looking at him with such tenderness he felt his face flush.
Darcy wriggled out of her blanket and crawled under the covers. Sherlock gathered her to his chest and kissed her head.
“Sherlock, I am serious,” Mycroft insisted. “There are powers within the government and the military beyond my influence. Toying with them because you’re bored is an exceedingly stupid thing to do.”
“Oh, a man in uniform, they’re always so charming,” Mrs Hudson giggled. Sherlock cleared his throat, feeling the blush overtake his face, and said nothing.
John glances at the plant in his hands, and indeed there are a few white blobs still attached to it. He looks back up at Sherlock who stops his pacing and stands directly in front of John. John blinks at him.
“I am not your pawn to be used in your government schemes,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth. “And neither is John.”
John ran his fingertips across Sherlock’s palm, taking in the new tactile sensations. Slowly, he moved closer, until he was only centimetres from Sherlock. He put one of his hands right over Sherlock’s wildly beating heart, and touched Sherlock’s face with the other.
As if on cue, a small robot whizzed across the living room floor to suck up the crumbs. Sherlock ignored it, as he always did, in favour of the biscuit and the computer screen before his eyes. Who knew hacking into MI6 archives took less than an hour.
The Lab exploded when they were still in the lift on their way up. The whole building shuddered and the lights flickered. The fire and bomb alarms went off immediately, and the lift stopped. An automated message blared from the lift speakers, informing them the auxiliary backup would start up soon to allow them to exit the lift on the next floor. After less than a minute the emergency power supply came on, much to Sherlock’s relief. He hoped the explosion had been sufficient to destroy everything, and if not, that the oxygen fueled fire would finish the job.
Sherlock took a sharp inhale as soon as the words left his mouth. He hadn’t meant to be so abrupt and tactless about it, he hadn’t meant to tell John at all, John wasn’t supposed to
There were photographs of the bodies attached to the report. All of them looked almost identical, with minor differences in colouration and birthmarks.
“You’re not an ideal, all knowing commander, no. But you are so... human. Emotional, flawed, brave.” Sherlock looked over to the empty armchair across from him, a silhouette of a man forming in his mind’s eye. “In that respect, you are perfect,” he finished quietly.
Sherlock felt the telltale heat pooling in his groin, the first stirrings of his impending orgasm. He needed more, more of everything.
“It’s probably a client,” Sherlock said, knowing it wasn’t. The length of the single ring could only mean Mycroft, a perfect way to sour the cheerful mood. Mrs Hudson didn’t need to know that, but it was the perfect opportunity to get rid of her. “Would you mind showing them in while I get ready?”
“Sherlock,” John said, clearly making an effort to keep his voice level. “Withholding this kind of information is not protection. It’s a lie. You
“They both went for a walk in the forest. It was the beginning of a new year and the forest was covered in snow. The prince was collecting winter plants for his studies, and the knight was just walking, trying to find some peace for his thoughts,” John explained. “They met quite by chance. Or perhaps it was Fate, who knows.”
Sherlock abandoned his coffee, shook off his morose thoughts, and started up his computer. There was no point in wallowing in self pity, there was no time for it, he had to talk to John again and make it right.
“No more! No more!” Darcy squealed as she tossed and turned, trying to dislodge her dads from making her laugh.
“John.” Sherlock sounded unsure. John waited silently for Sherlock to stop his inspection of the gravel beneath his feet.
Sherlock grinned at the screen, delighted he had been right. An AI clever enough to investigate the world on its own, wanting to learn everything about humanity, the good and the bad. Swearing and discovering his own, albeit limited, sexuality—Watson was clearly a he, not an it. An imperfectly perfect artificial intelligence, far more human than his creators would have intended.
John looked at him as if seeing him for the first time. Sherlock stayed where he was, hands outstretched, palms up, trying to be as non-threatening and calm as possible.
“I’m beginning to think you don’t love me as much as you claim,” Sherlock said with mock annoyance and pouted.
John groaned again and opened his eyes slowly. He blinked several times before looking down at Sherlock. Realisation dawned in his eyes; it wasn’t a difficult deduction when presented with two erections and a clearly enjoyable dream. Sherlock didn’t want to give him a chance to even think about what had happened.
, one he thought he had lost. Sherlock caressed the silk between his fingers, his confusion unfurling into a different direction. Had John kept it all this time? Why would he do that?
Sherlock felt the tips of his ears heat up at the compliment. Nobody ever called him brilliant or extraordinary, nobody ever praised his skills and intelligence like that. Except his parents, but that didn’t count, all parents think their children are the brightest creatures on Earth. Although, in this instance the Holmes parents were not far off the mark.
“What do you need a dead twig for?” John asks looking down at said twig and twirling it between his fingers.
The case was solved within six hours of accepting Lestrade’s invitation to the crime scene. Sherlock deemed the whole affair dull and pedestrian, and announced his leave as soon as the culprit was apprehended and handcuffed. He didn’t bother waiting for John to catch up or for Lestrade to finish asking questions, his mind already preoccupied with an oncoming fit of boredom. John didn’t pay it too much attention, in fact he didn’t seem to mind at all. He stayed behind chatting amiably with Lestrade, mostly about tonight’s match and whether or not Sherlock could be persuaded to come in the next day to give a statement.
“J-John, I-I-I h-had to a-a-ask...“ Sherlock stammers through clenched teeth. John takes his coat off and drapes it around the detective’s shaking shoulders.
Sherlock grumbled under his breath but continued eating. As always, Mrs Hudson’s food was delicious and he couldn’t really complain about being looked after.
,” John cut him off. “They will look for you once they realise what you know, you have to protect yourself—”
Thunder struck somewhere in London, and Darcy trembled in Sherlock’s arms. He tucked her in closer, safe against his shoulder and chest, and covered her exposed ear with his large hand. Sherlock kept his mouth close to her head, dropping gentle kisses in her hair and humming quietly to drown out the noise of the storm.
Over an hour later they were both sprawled out naked on the bed, the duvet twisted around their legs. Sherlock was on her front, her arms folded under her head, her eyes closed, and a small smile playing on her lips. Jane had her head propped up on her hand, the other one lightly caressing Sherlock’s back.
“No. I want your story.” Darcy nodded to herself and rolled onto her back. She looked at John and tugged his fingers, still grasped in her small hand. “I want stories about dragons.”
“I’m so sorry. For everything I’ve done to make you angry. I’m sorry if—I’m sorry in case this doesn’t work.”
Sherlock woke up some time later to find his room bathed in the late afternoon light. He didn’t remember falling asleep and hadn’t meant to, but he supposed it was better than conscious suffering. He yawned and stretched on the bed, wondering whether John was in the flat or whether he had left. His question was answered a few seconds later by John himself.
“So… the prince was like you,” Darcy pointed at Sherlock, “and the knight was like you.” Darcy pointed at John.
His landlady opened the door less than a minute later. Sherlock barged inside, John hanging heavily from his shoulder, before she could reprimand him for making so much noise.
“John,” Sherlock said again, apprehension and doubt creeping into his voice. He tugged the hand John was still holding and brought it to his chest. He held John’s hand between his own, absolutely sure John could feel his heart beating wildly in his chest. “John, could you-- that is-- you could--”
“Some dragons are scary even to adults,” John murmured into her hair. “Are you sure you want to hear the rest of the story?”
John was also currently sitting at the kitchen table, infinite tenderness and affection in his eyes and smile, after complimenting Sherlock’s cooking. Sherlock felt the telltale flutter in his stomach and the heat creeping up his neck.
“Daddy?” The lump under the covers stirred slightly and bright blue eyes peeked over the edge. “Can I have a story?”
Sherlock’s smile grew, the lines around her eyes and mouth deepening with joy, and the slant of her mouth becoming endearingly lopsided.
The horizon and the sky were indistinguishable in the complete darkness. Above them, the faint outline of the Milky Way cut across the sky. They were lying down on the blanket, among tall grasses, the sounds of crickets their only companion. They held hands, John’s thumb rubbing shapeless patterns into Sherlock skin. John was pointing at the sky, talking about Orion’s belt and the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way and Mars, Venus and Mercury. Sherlock was only half paying attention to any of it, he was watching something far more interesting and breathtaking. He was watching John.
John sighed a breath of relief and felt the tension bleed out of him almost instantly. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and hugged him closer. “Okay,” he said, fighting a smile without much success. “Okay,” he repeated, more to reassure himself, and kissed the closest patch of exposed skin, which happened to be Sherlock’s collarbone. “In that case let’s go inside so I can charm your parents even more.”
A small tug on his t-shirt made Sherlock look back down at Darcy. Her little brows were furrowed with worry.
Maybe he could shift close enough to John, slowly, so John could take the hint and initiate some form of contact between them. The chance that it would go badly was negligible, and the possible pay off was substantial.
“Sherlock? Are you awake?” By the sounds of it John had been sitting in the kitchen, probably waiting for Sherlock to wake up so they could talk. Sherlock groaned and pushed the heels of his hands into his eyes until he saw stars. Anything but this.
“No, no, no,” he assured her, hugging her close. “Bee, that wasn’t bad, not at all. We just don’t want to scare you.”
Lestrade turned towards his car and hummed to himself. If the day so far was any indication, Arsenal was going to win tonight. Yes, definitely a good day.
Sherlock woke late in the afternoon to the sounds of Mrs Hudson tidying up the kitchen. He rolled out of bed with a groan and went straight into the bathroom for a shower, feeling greasy after not bathing for almost two days. He emerged just as Mrs Hudson placed two bowls of stew on the dining table.
He read through the AI transfer protocols, committing them to memory with ease. When he got to the reports on “organic” bodies, his blood ran cold with terror. Short, succinct sentences described how new life had been formed from multiple donors in artificial wombs, how it had been cultivated and grown in preparation for tests. The host bodies had been developed to have no higher brain functions of their own, to be the perfect empty vessels waiting to be overwritten by an AI. There was one blueprint for all of the bodies, and each new one was a clone of the original prototype.
Watson chuckled, honest to God chuckled, and Sherlock was glad he was already sitting down because his knees turned to water. His voice was so soft, yet so… manly. Masculine. Powerful. Gentle, yet commanding.
“Calm down, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock sighed, handing her the last cleaned plate and drying his hands on a tea towel. “He’s an ex-soldier.”
The writing was choppy and flowery, the grammar and syntax quite painfully wrong in places. As he read on, something tight and heavy settled in Sherlock’s chest, not from the mistakes in writing but how romantic John made it all out to be.
“There was once a young, smart and handsome prince. He lived in a castle with his parents, the king and queen, and his older brother, the prince regent. His parents loved him very much and wanted to spend time with him, but the prince was young and rebellious, and always said no. The prince’s older brother was quite fat and arrogant and—”
Sherlock shot out of the car as soon as the engine was off. John lingered for a bit, taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly. He got out of the car and went round the back to help Sherlock with the bags. Sherlock was vibrating with nervous energy and still refused to look at John directly. John steeled himself for a very awkward weekend and bent down to pick up his bag. Sherlock’s gentle hand on his arm stopped him.
“Sherlock! John! Oh, the dreadful traffic these days, Margaret has been frantic with worry all day. Come in, come in, you must be tired. Through to the sitting room, drop your bags there boys. Margaret wants to see you but she’s stuck in the kitchen, you see.”
Movie started, they tucked into their food. Sherlock made appreciative noises over the sounds of the opening credits.
“Do you want me to get one of your books?” Sherlock tapped her nose gently with his finger. She smiled up at him and scrunched up her nose.
John’s word were filled with affection and pure hunger. Sherlock crawled over John on all fours and straddled John’s thighs. John reached up with his injured arm and gently tugged Sherlock down by his hair, kissing him messily. He used right arm to reach down and wrap his hand around Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock shivered at the sensation, and settled down with his forearms framing John’s head before his arms gave out.
John used his remote access to Sherlock’s computer to start the movie, while Sherlock made his way through a bowl of hot stew. He occasionally snorted into his food, particularly when Bond used outrageous gadgets that were decades ahead of the science and technology of the period. John shushed him a few times, not really meaning it, and they fell into companionable silence as the movie went on.
“Mmm, I do.” John bent down to kiss Sherlock, lingering for a few moments to exchange closed-mouth kisses. “I love
Sherlock felt angry at himself for daring to hope, and for forming such a quick attachment. An attachment to an AI of all things, inaccessible and unreal in so many ways. But just one conversation with Watson had been more fascinating, and promising, than any he had had in years. Watson didn’t judge him based on his past, or his looks, or his profession, or skills. He respected him as a nuanced person and seemed intrigued by Sherlock. It made Sherlock feel whole, like he might not be a complete social reject after all. Though he could hear the sneering and mocking voices of his peers, laughing at him for only managing to find a friend in non-human intelligence.
They spent some time like this, the three of them under the covers and snuggled up close. The only light left in the room was Sherlock’s bedside lamp, casting a warm glow over them, helping dispel some of the fear and danger of thunder.
Lestrade closed his eyes quickly and schooled his features, trying to give off his best still-very-much-asleep impression. He felt a bit like an intruder, seeing John and Sherlock during their morning routines, but the temptation was just too great to resist. Seeing the domesticity of their shared breakfast was like watching a rare and easily spooked bird. Mentally berating himself for the comparison, Lestrade reflected he might’ve had a bit more to drink the previous night than he previously thought.
Jane woke up with her face pressed firmly into a bird’s nest of dark, curly hair. The owner of the nest, one Sherlock Holmes, was breathing damp air into Jane’s neck and clinging to her like a giant limpet. They were both covered by the lavishly thick duvet, and it was starting to get rather hot and sweaty under it. Jane pushed it down to uncover their faces, and breathed in the crisp morning air.
“You know what, forget I asked,” John mumbled. He wouldn’t meet Sherlock eyes, a sure sign he was embarrassed and uncomfortable.
A new wave of guilt washed over him, making him replay the events of the previous evening in excruciating detail. He knew John had been justified in his anger. What Sherlock had done was stupid, reckless and wholly inappropriate, no matter how noble and self sacrificing it might have seemed at first. The realisation brought no relief, only shame and more guilt, as the minutes ticked by and the inevitability of John’s death became more real.
to even consider the possibility of John reciprocating his feelings. Dreams were not proof of anything, John had no control over dreaming about him, he might not even
Sherlock grabbed the edge of the duvet and wiped at the mess of tears, drool and snot on John’s shoulder. John giggled when Sherlock found a ticklish spot on his neck, and Sherlock marveled by the easy intimacy between them. In a way it had always been there, even when they skirted around all the unspoken words between them.
Sherlock was shaken out of his reverie by John gently tugging on his hand and interlacing their fingers together.
“It’s not a dead twig, John,” Sherlock says impatiently and continues to pace the kitchen. “As usual you see but do not observe,” he mutters to himself. “Viscum album, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalal, an obligate hemi-parasitic plant, native to Great Britain and most of Europe. The white berries are poisonous, don’t eat them,” Sherlock rattles off without a pause for breath.
“As I was saying,” Sherlock continued, “the older brother wasn’t a very good brother at all. The prince argued and bickered with his brother constantly, no matter how much their parents tried to make them get along. The prince spent his time alone, away from everyone. He loved to learn from books but he also liked adventures, so he often went for walks in the nearby forest. But he always did it alone and it made him very sad.”
He couldn’t find switches or control panels to access the room in the immediate area, so he ran to the main computer. Using Mycroft’s pass he first opened entrances to all rooms, not bothering to find out which exact one he needed access to. Recalling the AI transfer procedure, he checked all necessary systems and safety precautions were in place.
“…which is why I don’t think Arsenal has a chance at getting through to the next—,” John was cut off by a loud rumble. He raised his eyebrows at Lestrade, who ducked his head in slight embarrassment.
John smirked and kissed the underside of Sherlock's jaw. He grabbed Sherlock's hand and led them towards the (shared, Lestrade assumed) bedroom. “I’ll never tell a soul you like to be the little spoon.”
“I’ll grab a shower and then we can go,” John said, still smiling. Sherlock let one corner of his mouth twitch in response.
Mycroft sighed, and entered the flat undeterred. He walked over to the desk and placed a pale blue folder on top of it.
“The things I have to put up with,” Jane huffed in mock annoyance. She leaned down and kissed Sherlock’s full lips. Sherlock hummed and deftly grabbed Jane’s head to keep her in place.
“Sh’lock. You drugged me,” John said. He stopped cooperating entirely and started giggling. “Y’drugged me.”
The program started up, and the familiar logo and icons appeared, but the dialogue box was gone. In its place was a short message, and it made Sherlock’s blood run cold.
He escaped into the sitting room, leaving a bemused John behind in the kitchen. Sherlock moved around a few papers and envelopes scattered around the desk, trying to appear busy, but making a bigger mess in the process.
“Neither have I,” Sherlock admitted. The fragile, quiet moment between them lingered, and Sherlock felt the knots in his stomach loosen.
John kissed down Sherlock’s neck and along his collarbones, alternating between gentle pecks and wet, open-mouthed kisses. He urged Sherlock to shuffle up so he could reach his chest, all the while playing with Sherlock’s foreskin and stroking his cock slowly. John kissed his way to Sherlock’s left nipple and licked it with the flat of his tongue. Encouraged by Sherlock’s whimpers and near sobs he took it into his mouth and sucked, at the same time he used his other hand to tease and pinch the right one. Sherlock felt as if there was a direct connection between his cock and his nipples, if the growing amount of precome coating John’s hand and belly was anything to go by.
The A&E department had been swamped and it took several hours before John was seen by a doctor. John stubbornly denied being injured but the doctor didn’t seem fazed and simply went about examining John’s shoulder in silence. He did smirk rather smugly when John yelped in pain at being prodded and manhandled.
Sherlock chewed his bottom lip before asking the question that had been nagging him since the day before.
Sherlock walked up to John and peered down at the small planet between them. Patches of blue, green, white and brown on a spherical planet, the origin of humanity and John Watson.
Sherlock felt the side of his mouth twitch in response. He dropped a quick kiss on Darcy’s forehead and then John’s hand—still held tightly to Darcy’s chest—and got comfortable. With Darcy bright eyes glued firmly to his face, he began the story.
Sherlock’s fingers hovered over the keyboard. He could make it all up, quite convincingly in fact, but that would be less fun.
Sherlock rested their forehead against John’s, letting their emotions and thoughts flow freely between them. John felt the excitement, the wonder, the immense gratitude, and above all the overwhelming love. Sherlock kept whirring and purring but John didn’t need to speak their language to know what they were saying.
Sherlock said nothing, refusing to meet Mycroft’s gaze. He stared at the ceiling, eyes unfocused. He should have known this, shouldn't have hoped it would go on indefinitely. It was his lot in life, it seemed, to go through it alone. A friendship in its infancy nipped in the bud. Not for the first time, and not the last.
The light coming from window, muted by the still drawn curtains, made Sherlock’s skin glow pale gold. Jane traced the freckles and moles scattered across Sherlock’s back with her fingertips. Her hand dipped below the covers to grope Sherlock’s bum quickly, which earned her an amused huff from Sherlock.
Sherlock’s heart fluttered at the words, hopeful and delicate. He kept gazing at the empty armchair, longing slowly filling his chest, and said nothing.
“I understand your childish need to annoy me, Sherlock, but making a mess of the MI6 archives is beyond petty,” Mycroft said in a tight voice.
John walked over to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s waist, and rose up on his toes to place a quick kiss on Sherlock’s lips. By the time John leaned away, Sherlock had only just recovered from the momentary surprise at such a tender welcome. He wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders, not letting him pull away completely.
John bent down so that his lips were almost touching Sherlock’s hair and murmured something inaudibly. Sherlock swallowed his last piece of toast and looked up at him smiling. Not a calculated or condescending smile, but a genuine, slightly lopsided smile. Lestrade couldn’t remember Sherlock ever gracing him, or anyone else, with such a smile. Sherlock whispered something to John, still too quiet to be heard by Lestrade. John’s only response was to bend down further and kiss Sherlock lightly on the lips.
Darcy stayed silent for a few moments, considering the question. She looked up at Sherlock, seeking reassurance.
The software finally booted up, taking its time after decades of being unused, and the screen turned a glowing dark blue. A logo with a giant letter W and the army insignia in the middle appeared and then faded into the background. A line of white, small icons with no discernible function became visible along the top, and beneath it a dialogue box with a blinking cursor. The background stayed a soft dark blue, although it seemed to shift and flow along the edges of the screen.
“No wonder you don’t like painkillers,” Sherlock muttered at the liquified John Watson at his feet. John giggled in response. “You’re going to thank me later for this.”
“What possible meaning could the phrase “you’re never convenient” hold apart from the obvious, do enlighten me,” Sherlock snapped. He was lying down again, facing John, a safe arm’s length between them.
“There you go,” Mrs Holmes chose that moment to arrive laden with an enormous blanket. John disentangled himself from Sherlock and took the blanket from her. “Don’t stay out too late, boys.”
John opened his mouth to say something but started coughing instead. Realising John had not had anything to drink in a while, Sherlock grabbed the glass of water he had left on the bedside table and held it out.
John went back to watching the film but kept running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, massaging his scalp and nape. Sherlock couldn’t keep his eyes open, and let himself drift in the hazy state between wakefulness and sleep. The sounds of the film seemed far away and indecipherable, Sherlock could only hear both of their hearts beating in sync.
. You woke me up and then found out this will be over within a few days, no doubt your omniscient brother helped, didn’t he? So why bother telling the poor, clueless computer that its life will be over?” John’s voice kept rising, becoming more furious.
As they got closer, as the heat in their groins coalesced and expanded, they found the words to say what they've been feeling for years. In hushed and breathless tones they confessed everything, years of longing and whole lifetimes of loss and love.  Their tears were lost in sweat and damp breaths, in the words that spilled unbidden from their lips.
Sherlock shut down his computer and shuffled off to his bedroom. He collapsed into bed, still in his pyjamas from the day before, and fell asleep almost immediately. He dreamt he got lost in a metal maze, the walls covered in blinking lights, the ground blanketed in twisting cables. He was searching for someone, but could not remember who.
Once Sherlock was sure John was stable, he ran back to open all oxygen tanks and vents he could find.
John started pulling away, and Sherlock knew this was it. Hugging your best friend was one thing, but smelling and kissing his neck was something else altogether. There was no coming back from this, no way to explain this but for what it was.
John had called it a date. Sherlock had never been on a date. Oh sure, he and John went along to restaurants on what many people would call dates but neither of them considered them as such, so they didn’t count. A date was a mutually agreed upon event, where both parties put conscious effort into romance.
Jane heard Sherlock huff in amusement, but when she turned around Sherlock’s eyes were closed. Jane walked back to the bed, suddenly feeling anxious. She paused to compose herself just before climbing into bed and settling in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to do it, no matter how many opportunities presented themselves. It was in his nature to be an addict, and John was more powerful than any drug he’d ever taken.
John gave him a small, reassuring smile before depositing a bundle of fabric on the bed between them. Sherlock frowned at it and then up at John, whose smile turned melancholy.
“What?” Sherlock said around the cotton in his mouth. He felt disoriented, the thought of something important that he had to do still clinging to his mind.
Darcy yawned again and stayed silent. A few minutes later her breathing evened out, her grasp on John’s t-shirt gradually loosening, until she was fast asleep.
“I think it’s a little bit special this year,” John murmured and kissed him again, longer this time. John gently licked and bit at Sherlock’s lower lip before ending the kiss, and Sherlock couldn’t help but lean into John a bit more, chasing after his lips. A small sound escaped him and John pecked him once more, chuckling.
“I’m fine, Mummy, it was just a bit of traffic,” Sherlock said as he carefully placed a kiss on Mrs Holmes’ cheek, all the while trying to avoid getting covered in flour.
Sherlock huffs again but remains silent for the rest of the film, engrossing himself instead in a medical journal he found under the sofa.
Sherlock wasn’t sure whether taking John’s hand while watching a film was comparable to a quick peck on the lips in the morning, or a bit of cuddling before sleep. Or maybe it was too much? Too clingy? They were supposed to watch a film after all.
He knew there was no hope of a perfect transfer, some data would be lost purely due to the enormous capacity differential between supercomputer RAM and human memory, but if there was one thing Sherlock wanted to keep intact, it was John’s personality. Everything else they could work on, together.
John leaned back a little to look into Sherlock’s eyes. He could barely make them out in the dark, what little light there was from the stars giving them an unearthly appearance.
“Once you—when you get better we can start looking for accommodation for you. And a job. Mycroft could help, you’d need diplomas and certificates if you wanted to work as a doctor. Or you could do something else, it’s entirely up to you. You’re completely free to do whatever you want and go wherever you please,” Sherlock babbled. His hands fluttered uselessly around the desk, picking at non-existent lint and brushing off imaginary dust.
John’s right hand wrapped around Sherlock’s moderate length almost entirely. He held it lightly, smearing his thumb through the precome gathered at the tip. Sherlock whimpered into John’s mouth, very nearly overwhelmed by the simple stimulation. It was a culmination of years of longing, his body finally catching up to his brain, finally ready to give in to pleasure.
“You’re like a cat demanding attention, you know that?” John remarked, without taking his eyes off the screen. A quick glance assured Sherlock that John wasn’t annoyed, and that the film had progressed far enough for Sherlock to have no idea who was who and doing what and why. He couldn’t really bring himself to care.
“Not everyone within the government is thrilled about the development of the M Project. Watson’s incorporation into it would make it far too powerful and unpredictable. It could become very dangerous, a possibility which has been ignored by many of those in power.”
Mrs Holmes gave both of them a fond look before she turned to her husband and took his hand. Mr Holmes beamed at them from the back door of the house before he closed it and followed his wife upstairs to bed.
Sherlock got up to make coffee, finally getting restless enough to move. He had to figure out how to apologise to John, how to explain himself, and end their fight in friendship before… before it was all over.
For three days Sherlock stayed in the kitchen, unable to concentrate on anything lest he miss the telltale sounds of John waking up, or hovered by the open door of his bedroom, where he watched John sleep and wished him awake. Every few hours he hauled John up into a semi-sitting position and made him drink some water. John kept sleeping.
“It’s a rainbow moonstone. Reminded me of your eyes,” Jane said, too nervous to let the silence continue. She let go of Sherlock’s hand and gently cupped her face, forcing Sherlock to finally look her in the eyes.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist and buried his face in John’s shirt covered belly. His words were muffled when he spoke, but Lestrade could still make out what he said.
Still, she had plans for today and none of them would be achieved by staying in bed. Today was Sherlock’s birthday and Jane was going to make it the best day of her life so far.
“Off,” John said as he tugged on the shirt. Sherlock scrambled to kneel on the bed to shed his clothes as quickly as possible. He threw them away in the vague direction of the floor and then helped John do the same.
“Get to the point, Mycroft.” Sherlock snapped. He walked over to the desk to grab the folder, and began rifling through it.
They all fell silent. Darcy snuggled up against John, and yawned a few times. Minutes passed, her breathing growing even and slow, and she appeared to have finally tired herself out. Sherlock reached back to turn off his bedside lamp, encasing them in darkness.
It would be so easy to push John away now, make him angry and fight him, sever the connection while it was still fresh. End it before Sherlock got too involved. Anxiety and fear lodged itself in Sherlock’s stomach, a heavy weight deep in his guts.
Sherlock hummed in agreement and rolled onto her back. Jane leaned down to place a quick kiss on her lips, but Sherlock’s hand in her hair kept her there a bit longer. They kissed deeply but unhurriedly for some time, enjoying the slow and intimate pace of the morning.
. Sherlock moaned and opened his mouth, allowing John to push his tongue inside. They both groaned at the feeling, and that single sound turned the tender kisses into something far more passionate and urgent.
Sherlock grumbled under his breath as he followed John into the kitchen, but his words held no heat.
A second policeman gets out of the car and both of them look at John and Sherlock uncertainly. "Sir, please put your violin down," the first one says. Sherlock remains silent and stares vacantly at John, obviously playing along with his plan.
“Of course!” Molly replied cheerfully. “John is currently in the hologram suite. Would you like me to relay a message?”
John Watson was surprisingly heavy. Sherlock made the rather unpleasant discovery whilst half carrying John up the stairs in the middle of the night, at the B&B they were staying in, somewhere in the arse end of Kent. John was also drugged up to the eyeballs with codeine and about as cooperative as a limp noodle. A rather clingy limp noodle.
“By not telling me, is that fucking it?” John spat. Sherlock winced as if he had been physically hit. “You can’t make these decisions for me, it’s
Lestrade stayed after the game finished (Arsenal won, of course) and enjoyed a few more hours of chatting and drinking with John. Sometime around midnight Sherlock announced he was off to his bedroom for the night, claiming he needed to conduct an experiment in peace and quiet. At around two in the morning Lestrade realised that he was very tipsy (but definitely not drunk, thank you very much) and that he missed his last train home. The prospect of going home on a night bus in his less than sober state didn’t sound very appealing. He must have vocalised that thought because the next thing he knew John was piling up blankets and cushions on the sofa beside him.
“It does sound rather nice, actually,” John said as he walked up to Sherlock’s side and slid his hand into Sherlock’s. “Wouldn’t want to miss the rest of it.”
“Oh, brilliant idea! Don’t use that flimsy thing though, let me get you a proper blanket,” Mrs Holmes snatched the blanket from Sherlock’s hands and disappeared inside the house before Sherlock even had the chance to open his mouth. He frowned at the retreating silhouette of his mother.
John smiled at Darcy and then at Sherlock. Darcy’s latest obsession was dragons, all she wanted to talk and read about were the mythical creatures, and the theme also crept into her clothes. The pyjamas she was wearing had tiny, colourful dragons all over them.
John’s heart was somewhere in his throat when Sherlock parked their car in front the Holmes house. He and Sherlock hadn’t spoken or even dared to look at each other since John’s wholly accidental admission that he was going to propose. John tried to explain and smooth things over straight away, but as soon as Sherlock started breathing again he begged John to stop talking. Sherlock seemed unable to process the prospect of becoming engaged, talk about it and drive at the same time, and since at that point the traffic had started to move again, John let the matter drop. Sherlock spent the rest of the drive looking anywhere but John, emotions ranging from disbelief to confusion, to judge by his facial expressions. John tried very hard not to take it as a bad sign but deep down he feared he had managed to absolutely, completely fuck this up.
Sherlock picked up the cardigan carefully, feeling the fine wool flow between his fingers, and brought it up to his face. He took a deep breath and with it he inhaled John’s scent. Intoxicating, heady, and in Sherlock’s mind, completely forbidden.
“No, you haven’t,” John said as he hugged Sherlock. Sherlock froze in shock, startled by John’s affectionate outburst.
John put on a thoughtful face while he exaggeratedly scratched his chin again, ignoring Sherlock rolling his eyes.
On the second day Mycroft appeared, several men in tow, which made Mrs Hudson complain about people barging into her home again. Mycroft brought essentials for John, clothes and toiletries, and John’s fake identity documents. Mycroft’s presence was proof enough that the destruction of Baskerville had been successful. The brothers said nothing to each other for the duration of the brief visit, a rare and silent truce.
As if on cue, after less than twenty seconds of fidgeting, John put his hand on Sherlock’s thigh. Quite high up Sherlock’s thigh. He left his hand there, rubbing small circles into Sherlock’s leg with his thumb.
Glass panel no longer an obstacle, Sherlock ran back to the room. Working as quickly as possible, he retrieved the list of essentials he’d need once the transfer was complete from his mind palace, and found the medical supplies all in place. He prepared emergency resuscitation equipment, along with clean towels and clothing. He hoped he wouldn’t have to use any of the more intrusive treatments, but he couldn’t risk being unprepared.
“Told you he’d deduce it,” John said from beside him. Across the room, Sherlock smirked and the smug expression didn’t leave his face for the rest of the evening.
“I wasn’t going to say anything,” Mr Holmes smiled at his wife fondly. Everyone got up from their chairs ready to go back into the house. Mr Holmes folded the blanket he used to cover his legs and handed it to Sherlock. “You should go out to the field and watch the stars from there. Less lights from the village.”
Sherlock’s heart was beating wildly, apparently attempting to escape his chest. He tried to get his breathing under control to no avail. He knew John was asleep from his breathing pattern, he knew it was an unconscious move to seek out the warmth of another body. But this was the most physical contact they’ve had in years, the closest they got to an actual hug, which was something Sherlock has been yearning for. The fact that John did this unconsciously made it a bittersweet victory; Sherlock wanted a hug to be offered and reciprocated in kind.
“Stay the night,” John said, removing some of the clutter from the other end of the sofa. “I know it’s not as comfy as your own bed, but it’s better than a night bus.”
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist and pressed them closer together, nuzzling his nose against John’s and mouthing “I love you” back to him.
“How did they meet?” Darcy asked John, once they straightened out the bedding and settled back down.
“Sorry, mate,“ Lestrade grinned and rubbed his belly absent-mindedly. “Haven’t had a chance to grab a bite before our genius solved this “intolerably mind-numbing excuse of a case”,” he said, imitating Sherlock’s exasperated tone, which earned him a chuckle from John. “Don’t ever tell him I do that, he’ll stop “assisting our sorry lot on these pathetic and mundane paint-by-numbers crimes”,” Lestrade intoned dryly. John guffawed, covering his mouth quickly before his outburst caused any unwanted attention.
John, it turned out, was extremely susceptible to codeine. The high dose turned him into a heavy, limp, clingy noodle who was at least high enough to not be in pain.
The bed looked so soft and inviting. John, already sleepy and ruffled, looked even more enticing. Sherlock could do this. He could slip under the covers, stay on the far side of the bed and get a decent night’s sleep. Chances were John would pass out from exhaustion and the codeine high very soon, and would stay dead to the world for quite a few hours.
John didn’t loosen his hold on Sherlock as the seconds ticked by. Sherlock untangled his hands from the scarf in his lap, and tentatively wrapped his arms around John. He grabbed two fistfuls of John’s shirt and held on for dear life, wanting to soak up the embrace for as long as possible. They didn’t do this, they weren’t like this. Soon enough John would pull away, act a bit embarrassed at the sudden display of affection, and then go back to behaving as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.
Sherlock whirred in surprise and wonder. They looked back at John, both pairs of their eyes wide and shining. Patches of blue and green glowed high on their cheekbones.
Sherlock abandoned all pretence of brushing her teeth and stared at Jane’s reflection in the mirror with hooded eyes. Jane gazed back at her, and pinched both of Sherlock’s nipples lightly at the same time as giving her earlobe a gentle nip.
Just as they disappeared into the kitchen Lestrade heard Sherlock say, “If you did, I’d tell everyone just how much you like scrubbing floors.” John snorted in response. Lestrade heard the bedroom door shut and the flat fell into silence.
“Why blue?” John asks for the third time since coming home. He dips a spoon into the soup but Sherlock grabs it before John can bring it anywhere near his mouth.
Sherlock spent almost every moment he could looking at John. He periodically checked John’s vitals—every minute, just to make sure, because what if it happened again and he lost him for good?—until John fell into deep sleep. Only then did Sherlock let himself relax at all.
Jane knew she had managed to surprise Sherlock by the quiet gasp Sherlock made when she opened her eyes. Sherlock stared at the ring box in her hand with wide eyes and her mouth slightly open.
John sat down opposite him at the kitchen table and ate his breakfast silently, the crinkle of newspaper pages being turned and the clink of a spoon hitting a bowl the only sounds filling the room. The silence enveloping them was comfortable, borne out of years in each other’s company and the peaceful domesticity of quiet mornings such as this one.
John made a broken, pained noise at the back of his throat and surged up to gather Sherlock into his arms.
Sherlock felt himself being pushed gently back onto the bed, on his side, and then gathered up in John’s arms. John peppered Sherlock’s face with kisses, running his hands reverently over Sherlock’s back and sides. He murmured praise and endearments, and Sherlock felt as if the love pouring out of John was filling him up and bringing him back to life.
Sherlock had an inkling about Watson’s awareness of its situation, but had to make sure. The fact that it hadn’t reacted at all to being woken up after over thirty years of hibernation was suspicious.
’ Sherlock typed out the question with care, his heart speeding up a little. He was surprised to find himself caring about Watson’s reply, wanting to impress him, wanting… wanting to befriend him.
“Oh, Sherlock, I was so worried after you called! Are you alright? You didn’t overheat in the car did you?”
They kissed hungrily and passionately for minutes, hours, days, years; until their lips were swollen and they could do nothing more than breathe each other’s air. Time felt endless in the darkness, with stars burning and falling above them.
Sherlock could’ve sworn Watson sounded almost playful when he said that, and definitely cheerful. He seemed chuffed to bits he managed to surprise Sherlock.
Sherlock stopped to take a few deep, calming breaths. He wiped his eyes and nose, and collected his thoughts.
Sherlock broke out of his mortified stupor and moved away just far enough to be able to look up at John. Who still appeared to be asleep.
“John.” Sherlock held John’s hips firmly at an arm’s distance and gave him a little shake. John grumbled in his sleep and tried to pull Sherlock back into his arms.
"Sherlock, what are you--" John stops mid-sentence when he notices a police car coming round the corner. "Oh, god," John groans. The neighbours definitely weren't happy with Sherlock's atonal violin practice.
“Don’t bloody care,” Sherlock interrupted. He pulled John back to him by the front of his shirt and kissed him, effectively silencing him.
John hugged Sherlock tightly, caressing his back and carding his fingers through his mop of curls, murmuring quiet words of love and affection into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock clung onto him, his whole body trembling with quiet sobs. The pain of the last few years seeped out of him, melted away with the tears and the ragged breaths, replaced by John. John’s scent, John’s skin, John’s touch, John’s words, John’s love. It filled Sherlock until he felt whole again, until the last remnants of emptiness and loneliness were gone.
“In the greater scale of the universe, Earth is insignificant,” Sherlock remarked, running their hand carefully over the surface of the planet. John snorted in response.
“I know it’s not perfect, there’s still loads missing, but it’s the closest I could do.” John gestured to the planet. “It’s yours now. You can finish it.”
As a last resort he grabbed the intraosseous adrenaline injector and jammed it into John’s knee. The defibrillator delivered another shock, and finally John’s vitals began to stabilise. His heartbeat returned to normal and so did his breathing.
“No,” Mycroft conceded, “but it will delay it. You and your friend might become valuable assets in the future.”
John hummed above him and Sherlock looked up at him, his hands still on John’s hips. John smiled down at him, his mouth endearingly lopsided, and ruffled his hair weakly. Sherlock’s scalp tingled pleasantly where John’s fingers touched it, and he wished John would run his fingers through his hair more often.
have known, Sherlock,” John interrupted. “I was made to know. That was my entire purpose, the reason I was made. I was supposed to be the ideal commander and I
Sherlock smirked in reply, and they ate the rest of dinner in silence. Later, when he was helping Mrs Hudson clean the dishes, he found himself uncharacteristically forthright. Perhaps a full stomach and motherly care did that to him.
“This benefits us both, Sherlock, do not pretend otherwise.” Mycroft's tone was firm. “You can save your friend and prevent the information about him from falling into the wrong hands. The experiments of Phase II and III were carried out in a facility not bound by international ethics laws, and as such it is best they are forgotten.”
“Mmffs’good,” John mumbled into Sherlock’s hair. He kept thrusting against Sherlock’s belly. “Shr’lock, ah.”
Sherlock knew the government, and the military in particular, employed sophisticated AIs to help in the smooth running of the country - something which the general population was largely unaware of. Sherlock had no interest in exposing this fact—the only reason the healthcare service was functioning, and functioning well, was because of the AI that ran it at the highest levels of decision making—but he was curious to see which aspects of his life were affected by intelligent robots.
Unfortunately Sherlock’s tense abdomen seemed to provide more relief to John’s straining cock because John started thrusting his hips just a little bit harder. Sherlock panicked and tried to shuffle away but John tightened his grip around Sherlock’s torso. Sherlock was trapped.
Sherlock pulled at John’s shirt until John got the hint and scrambled onto the bed, covering Sherlock’s body with his own. From there, short work was made of trousers, shirts and pants, leaving them both bare and craving more.
Lestrade fought very hard not to react in any way. He was slightly overwhelmed by a sudden wave of affection for the pair. If anyone deserved to be happy, it was them. This revelation made Lestrade so cheerful, he wanted to jump up and hug them both. He knew he couldn’t of course, it was a private moment and they had every reason to keep it that way. He understood the need to keep it a secret, there was no need to give anyone more ammunition against themselves, be it the less sensitive officers at the yard or the criminals they chased after every other week.
“Whenever I dream about you it isn’t because you’re the most convenient choice. It’s because I—” John paused again and sighed. “I
“You didn’t tell me you had a voice. A very… real voice.” Sherlock cringed at how idiotic he sounded.
“We haven’t—this isn’t—I can’t—you don’t—” Sherlock tried to say several things at once and ended up saying nothing.
“Oh, for the love of...” Sherlock snatches the twig from John’s hands and holds it above their heads. “Mistletoe, John. Do I need to spell out its significance? I have been patient with you, I really have, going through all of these frankly ridiculous rituals that are supposedly considered romantic. I expect this kind of behaviour from other people but you... I expected a certain level of intelligence and observational skills from a man who spends most of his time around a detective, and someone who also identifies as a soldier and a doctor. This has gone far enough, John, you must know what the accepted ritual is, even though it's nowhere near Christm--,” Sherlock is interrupted mid-rant by John kissing him.
“Ask you what?” John looked puzzled. Sherlock nearly groaned in frustration which came out more like a whimper.
Sherlock couldn’t speak, couldn’t possibly trust himself to make a sound so instead he kissed John. He kissed him like his entire life depended on it, and in a way it did; he kissed him like he never wanted to be parted from him, and he didn’t.
“She’s sleeping with us tonight,” John said as he climbed into bed. Sherlock said nothing but raised his eyebrows and smirked in triumph. He put his book and glasses away, and settled down in bed.
“No,” Sherlock admitted. “It took us a few years to realise we loved each other and kiss. And then get married and have you.”
“It’s a love story,” Darcy stated. “The prince and the knight are in love, and they have adventures, and they kill a bad dragon, and save everyone.”
Sherlock stomps into the kitchen just as John is reaching for the kettle to make tea, throwing a dry twig at John. John catches it and looks at Sherlock quizzically.
“You fell asleep.” John’s soft and quiet voice filled his ear. Sherlock shuddered at the accidental intimacy of it.
“Wow, I haven’t watched this since I was a kid,” John says when he comes across an old zombie film. Sherlock groans. “Oi, shut up. I liked this kind of stuff when I was growing up.”
“You mean—I’m—and you—we—this?” Sherlock stumbled over his words, trying to say several things at once. He hadn’t expected this, he wasn’t prepared for this.
“Hmm? Yes, yes, fine,” Sherlock answered distractedly. John was still looking up at him with concern so Sherlock bent down to press a chaste but firm kiss to his lips. “I’m fine. Let’s go see Mummy.”
Their kissing grew more heated with each passing second, the give and take of lips and tongues becoming more frantic. Hands started roaming over chests, arms, arses, sometimes stopping to pull at hair. Whimpers, gasps, moans, heavy breathing and the slick sounds of kissing filled the room. The air felt thick and charged, the pent up passion between them spilling over and drowning them.
,” Sherlock clarified, a blush creeping up his neck. He meant to say he had made a new friend, but. Well.
John had made him out to be a hero, a dashing genius detective solving crimes and saving lives, with John as an awestruck onlooker. It was ridiculous, inaccurate, and so stupidly touching Sherlock felt his throat constrict with emotions.
Sherlock drove to Dartmoor as fast as he could. The views outside his window were a blur, passing from cityscapes to countryside. Sherlock paid none of it any attention, concentrating solely on getting to Baskerville before it was too late. He couldn’t think clearly, couldn’t even formulate a plan of action, all his thoughts occupied with John, John, John.
"Sherlock! Wake up!" John interrupts the police officer. Sherlock stops playing and looks at John quizzically. John strides quickly towards him and hopes Sherlock doesn't try to be too difficult. "Wake up, you've been sleepwalking again!"
John smiled at him once again, the corners of his eyes crinkling. Sherlock couldn’t stop his own smile, until they were both grinning like idiots, dissolving into laughter. It was all fine. After all, they had the rest of their lives to figure it out.
“Such a dull name for someone who is anything but. In fact,” Sherlock let one corner of his mouth twitch up, “you are far more interesting than the majority of the traditionally created human beings.”
John’s gentle but firm hand on his forearm made him inhale sharply and open his eyes. Sherlock expected pity from John but found no traces of it, the lines on John’s face only etched with worry and kindness. Even so, the shame from earlier resurfaced and he felt his cheeks burn.
When Sherlock turned back to lay down he stopped at the look on John’s face. John was leaning back on his good arm, eyes raking up and down Sherlock’s naked body, hungrily taking in every detail. John’s gaze stopped at Sherlock’s cock and he licked his lips. Sherlock shivered.
He knew he should disconnect. He held his fingers above his comm device, fighting with himself, unable to make a decision either way. Mycroft’s words of advice rushed back to him, battling with his instincts and the longing for an emotional connection to another being.
It was a website. Similar to his in layout but with brighter colours. A blog with only two posts, both written by John. The first was about how they met and the first night they spent talking. The second one was about their first, and probably last, case together.
Sherlock covered John’s mouth with an oxygen mask and started chest compressions, panic rising like bile in his throat and making his palm sweat. John was crashing fast. Sherlock grabbed the defibrillator and prepared it as quickly as he could. His clammy hands dropped the pads twice until he got them in place and delivered the first shock. He kept up the chest compressions between shocks, but John wasn’t improving.
However, after they had finished their food and drained their beers, they were sitting too far apart, much to Sherlock’s chagrin. The necessity of eating had meant sitting some distance apart to avoid elbows in ribs or upended plates of hot curry in one’s lap. Now though, now the space between them seemed to be an insurmountable chasm.
“Don’t worry, I’m not angry. I know you did it out of concern but there’s a reason I don’t like taking codeine.”
Sherlock stared up at John’s sleeping face in shock. John was dreaming about him. John was rutting against his belly and dreaming of having sex. With him. John wanted to have sex with him. John
“Thank you for your concern. As always, it was unnecessary and unwelcome,” Sherlock snapped, the furious scowl on his face at odds with his forcefully relaxed posture.
Silence stretched between them. Sherlock felt the weight in his stomach solidify again, a tight knot of anxiety and fear.
Sherlock hated seeing John sad, even slightly, so he propped himself up on one elbow and leaned across Darcy to give him a quick kiss. John looked startled for a second but recovered quickly, and tugged Sherlock back for a second kiss.
Sherlock felt shame burning up his cheeks, he knew he should stop and leave the bed, at the very least wake John up and put a stop to this. He knew was doing something Very Not Good by taking advantage like this but he couldn’t help himself, not when John snuffled like that and tightened his grip around him, when he felt John’s thigh muscles flex under his cock, when he could feel the damp spot on John’s pants rub against his belly.
“Maybe if you made your blog more exciting, more people would read it. A bit more drama and adventure, among the ash analyses.”
Sherlock watched Earth move slowly away from them, considering the question. They looked back at John and squinted.
and you kept it from me,” John voice was like ice, cold and sharp. For the first time since they met Sherlock was afraid of his voice.
A long sequence of words and numbers followed at lightning speed, until Sherlock was presented with another screen.
“Is this the part where you tell me John is my pirate?” Sherlock couldn’t keep the exasperation from his voice.
Sherlock released something between a hiccough and a sob, his vision going blurry. He felt John lean in close again and he closed his eyes, breathing John’s scent and the smells of the summer night.
Within seconds John found himself enveloped in a tight hug, both pairs of Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him, and Sherlock whirring and purring in his ear. John returned the embrace just as tightly.
Sherlock sighed heavily. He was seriously considering simply picking John up and carrying him up to their room. John slid out of his grasp and melted down onto the stairs.
“Anything interesting?” John asked as he glanced through the morning papers strewn around the table.
Sherlock felt a blush creeping up his face, and silently both cursed and thanked John for his steadily developing observation skills. Instead of saying thank you, Sherlock craned his neck up to plant a soft kiss on the underside of John’s chin. John’s hand drifted up from Sherlock’s back to tangle in his hair, stroking the nape of his neck.
Sherlock’s face was set aflame once more, and he turned to bury it in John’s belly. He mumbled “I love you too” into John’s cardigan, and knew John heard it by the soft touch of John’s fingers in his hair.
The Chief of the Defence Staff looked up from the papers strewn across the table, ignoring the heated discussion of the Commanders and Generals behind him. He held out his hand for the file, and dismissed the Major who delivered it.
“Dragons and damsels may be a bit too much, true,” John conceded. “But I stand by the dashing knight part.”
On his way back to the lifts he stopped by the John supercomputer. He briefly touched the hot metal with his fingertips, then ran towards the lifts and didn’t look back.
