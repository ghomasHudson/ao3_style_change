“I was just aggressively…”
D FitzSimmons: While I doubt he's going to leave Hunter now. He shouldn't because if we can get the stones back, then we can bring Bobo 2 back from the snap. Bobo 2 deserves to actually be happy.
“Don’t feel guilty about that. Especially because apparently there is already another you there.” Hunter feels awful for being so happy about that, but there was another Leo, so he could keep his.
Friday: Actually, Laura just requested that you go through the questions. She wants you two to work through your emotional bullshit for the sake of half of all life in the universe.
To be continued…
Skye quake: Avenger code name for Daisy “Skye” Louise Johnson. Media nickname Quake. She is now an agent of the ATCU as part of the Super Human, Inhuman, and Enhance liaison division. Will be signing the Accords despite the renegotiation because of political pressure. Hopefully, negotiations for a new agreement can begin soon.
Tony: Well at least there’s the anti-discrimination laws on the books regarding genetics. In this country anyway. The Accords are actually cutting down on some of the persecution of Inhumans.
“There are Mozzarella, pesto, and prosciutto sandwiches in the kitchen area. However, I believe you should wait until after the 2 PM meeting to contact Agent Carter Junior. There will be pertinent information revealed at that briefing that you will need to pass on to her.” Ana told him.
Francis: I don’t like thinking of it that way. One minute I was sitting down to have lunch with my wife and kids, and the next, they were gone.
XXXXXX
I think I would be up for a visit next month. They don’t celebrate Christmas here, but I’d rather not be completely alone. The Princess visits often, but she’s been in America a lot recently. I’m getting to know one of my neighbors, Polly. She’s from America too, but I think she’d rather spend Christmas just with her daughter. It’s the first one since her husband died.
“Friday mute. I know it’s been a while, but we’re adding massage, especially ones with happy endings, to the list of activities that you’re not supposed to listen to.” Which is probably why Tony did something that he hasn’t done since MIT.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cuddle Bunny: How do you accidentally on purpose get exposed to something?
Anthony: I wanted to eat you but you wouldn’t let me.
HSBF: They’re blaming Quake?
To be continued.
Me: You’re ridiculous sometimes. Maybe we can do this next time? We’ve been texting a while.
Me: I’m ready to wear it. That’s also why I gave the compass to you. I’m ready to let go of the past completely and make a future with you. I want to be your husband.
Captain tight pants: You stop taking your anxiety drugs?
My Iron Man life is too dangerous for you to be there. I think my SI life is too dangerous for you too, but you have been there so long that if I try to give you to another company, you'll probably cut off my balls in my sleep. So, you made the right decision being part of Tony’s SI life, but not Tony's superhero life. It's OK. I found someone who can fit into Tony’s superhero life because he's already there himself. He understands what I'm going through and my need to help more than anyone else.
Blue phone: I agree with you about keeping Queens in reserve. You can find others. There’s been an influx thanks to the alien contagion.
Agent Laura: I outsource that to Natasha. It was Clint’s idea.
"Why didn’t you tell me that you were shield?" Steve asked, changing the subject.
Tony: Yep. Talbot was engaged to Elizabeth sometime in the late 90s and daddy dearest wrecked things with his military connections. Even though Talbot went on and found the love of his life in someone else, it’s obvious he wants revenge and now he’s powerful enough to get it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: I’ll remember that for the next training exercise.
Me: You’re putting up with the possibility of our conversations becoming an entertainment for the Royal genius because she’s helping with James?
MayMQ: But I did tell him. My dad made that blanket.
Nomad: Maybe, he does care about me in a non-platonic way.
Football Hunter: This operation needs a better name.
“Probably.”
Me: I think I would like that.
Blue phone: If I was really trying to kill you, you would be dead.
Me: After 2 hours of interrogation where I talked about my cuddle bunny in excruciating pornographic detail my new ATCU handler, Agent Scary wouldn’t let me get coffee because she hates coffee. On the bright side, I made poor man’s Coulson choke on his water when I talked about cuddle bunny’s oral skills.
Tony: Not because of the President’s offer, but other things like what Fitz --sorry Leo did to my precious Friday. Although, the President’s suggestion did cause some heart palpitations.
The “me” in this chapter is Agent May. Steve must check in with his friend that almost died a few days earlier.
Red phone: Probably only in exchange for a campaign donation
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m not sure they’re willing to answer my questions regarding that. They’re living with the scars of what happened, but I don’t think they ever processed it. I’m not sure if everybody grieved because they’re focusing on undoing it. On that note, I don’t think they’re going to be willing to examine the mistakes that were made closely. I hypothesize things went badly because they were not actually on speaking terms at the time of the invasion. It’s hard to stop an apocalypse when you’re not talking to many of your teammates. I think Leo made the right decision in getting Tony and Steve talking to each other again first. At least that’s one thing going in our favor.
Anyway, I love you and miss you. Just remember, Mumbai is around the corner.
HSBF: Are you looking forward to that?
Me: I have serious plans to mess with him. This section of our conversation is currently being replaced with a detailed description of me giving you fellatio. It’s filthy enough to make any person who finds it really uncomfortable.
Ana Jr.: Considering my Pepper Potts was not surprised by Mr. Stark and Capt. Rogers's relationship, I doubt the other Pepper Potts would be surprised.
Tony: I want you home. A few days in Johannesburg or a couple of days in Malta is not going to do it because I miss you so much, but not being without you is not an option either. So here I am considering a deal with the President to get you home within the next four years.
BITC: Even though I really wish he would disappear. I still don’t trust the guy even though he obviously isn’t trying to keep Peter from MJ.
Me: You’re silly. So how was your day? I’m actually surprised you still text messaged me. It must be nearing 1 AM in New York.
Tony: XOXO XO
“But you said there was a dead drop?” Steve asked, incredulous.
Xxxxxx
“I assume she probably is.”
Sparrow is Tony’s nickname for Robin Huntington. She is a young human girl who sees the future and draws about it. Someone who can see the future. That might prove useful.
Nomad: I wish you could see me glaring at you right now.
Steve: Point. The food will be done cooking in 20 minutes. You can eat a sandwich, as I take care of the alcohol. I can move it up to the bar in the main living area.
Time sent: 11/8/2016 20:11:41
“Although it doesn’t matter if Platypus doesn’t get confirmed.”
Tony: OK, now I have to tell them that I am perfectly OK with Dr. Leopold coming in because I want to spend more time with my daughter as well as the foundations. I’m starting a new one, the Lincoln Campbell foundation with Skye Quake and Team Monkey Lover. That will be the arm that will handle Inhuman rights. Although Skye Quake wants to do some alcohol education outreach as well.
The Big Boss: Well, that’s one of your favorite strategies. I will talk to him once I’m done talking to you. However, we have a more immediate problem, he knows who Stefan really is.
Tasha: They both are going to a meeting after this. Because we’re all too much to handle for the recovering alcoholics without the desire to drink cropping up.
Avenger Ana: I was able to access the interplanetary communications network. Your message will arrive at C 53 in 23 hours and 18 minutes per standard Earth time.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter.
“As long as we both acknowledge that we are working to fix it. We are working to fix this?” Tony asked. Deep down, Tony wants to fix this. He doesn’t know if they will end up where his other self is, but he wants to be somewhere other than where they are now.
The Mechanic: Yes. And I’m starting to question that decision, especially after the last assassination attempt. However, I was dragged out of the other closet by a sex tape and an asshole ex-boyfriend who is still deep in the closet, pandering to the family values crowd.
“Yes, and now he’s around fire and marshmallows, so I do have to get out there. I hoped that Spidey Senior would be being a great role model but he’s probably using his webbing right now to kidnap chocolate pieces. I will chat with you in a few days. Love you,” Tony blew a kiss at him.
Steve: Why?
“Millions of babies have been born in the last five years. Possibly billions if you include the rest of the universe. We can’t wipe them out of existence even if it would be more convenient. Because there are people that love those babies as much as I love Morgan.”
“Because it’s Simmons. I have no problem hurting you.” May sighed.
Me: Sort of and definitely. Anyway, her dad is the significantly younger brother of Skye Quake’s biological father.
"Yes. I no longer blame Sergeant Barnes for what happened to my parents. I want to find the last bits of Hydra and burn it to the fucking ground but I don't hold it personally against him. I have found peace with it." Again, thank you therapy.
Steve grinned and slowly pushed into Tony. They both moaned louder the further in Steve went. Once he was finally all the way in, he paused so that Tony could adjust to his size.
“Cum inside me, Rogers.”
“Oh fucking hell Steve, yes, ohhhh”
“Sorry about that by the way.” Steve grinned as he brushed his hand over the dark marks on Tony’s neck.
Tony couldn’t help feel dejected at the fact that Steve hadn’t been doing what he thought he had but he had to move past that because there was an emergency Avengers meeting to attend. “Did you not hear J.A.R.V.I.S.? Change on the plane!”
“Uh.. yeah..” Steve answered with a flicker of something in his voice that Tony didn’t know how to infer.
“Follow me.” Tony grinned, leading the blonde to his car.
“You’re so beautiful, Tony.”
That was it. Steve was seeing stars as he came inside the man he thought he would never have a chance with.
“I like to free-ball” Tony barely got out in between various groans of pleasure.
The blonde licked Tony’s slit before he lowered his head all the way down until Tony was completely inside him. The pleasure the brunette felt was insane. Of course he’d been given a blowjob before but never from a guy and never one that felt this good. Steve bobbed his head up and down for about a minute, swirling his tongue around Tony’s dick as he did so.
“So what’s your question.” The mystery man finally made eye contact with him.
i hope you enjoy this chapter!
“What do you have in mind?” Steve let a little smirk appear on his face.
Tony knew it was going to be another tough day when J.A.R.V.I.S. alerted him of a call coming in from Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. It was 5am but Tony had already woken up and was tinkering in his workshop. Ever since New York he’s struggled to get 3 hours of sleep each night, let alone a full 8. Nowadays he spends most of his time either in his workshop or out on a mission with a few minutes here and there with the team in the Avengers tower lounge. It’s comfortable in there and Tony doesn’t like to admit it but he does enjoy the company of his fellow Avengers, especially a certain star spangled man, but he doesn’t find much interest in their ‘childish conversations’ and ‘silly kids games’ and finds his time would be better spent improving his and his teammates suits, and of course his many cars.
He collapsed on to the smaller man’s body and took a few deep breaths. It took them both a couple of minutes to come down from their highs. When they were finally back in reality, Steve went to pull out of Tony.
“I never knew you were such a tease, Rogers.” Tony forced out, still in agony at the lack of Steve inside him.
keep an eye out for more fics coming soon hehe
“How about you fuck me?” Steve replied, in a sex filled voice.
“Happily.” Steve smiled at the adorable, sleepy face in front of his. He shifted slightly to the side of Tony so that he was partially on the bed, allowing the smaller man to breathe easier.
“The part where you said you’re in love with me.”
“Pretty sure every brunette on Earth wants your mouth on them, let’s face it. But you know what I meant idiot.”
Tony: I would have to talk to Pepper about that. I trust her to move the company forward. So I don’t feel like I’m abandoning everybody. We would have to come up with a succession plan. I have an idea of who could take my place as CCO and he would be perfect for it. But she is CEO, so we would have to discuss it, but I think she would be on board.
Tony: That reminds me I have to start interviewing for a new assistant.
Person that cares about my boss: Friday, are they planning on telling Tony what really happened to Anna Jarvis today?
To: The Mechanic
Tony: I did bring Leo and the boyfriend with me. I now know who Football Hunter is. So apparently, I was with the older twin at the playoff Soccer game when I had my crisis of conscience. He wanted to make sure his younger self didn’t screw things up like he did the first time around. Apparently, those original choices lead to the distraction of the earth and the nearing extinction of the human species eventually.
Me: I agree with that.
“What questionnaire?”
“Are they still trying to lock you out of the company again because you’re publicly dating a man?”
Warning: light sexual content.
This chapter is from the perspective of Steve's cell phone. Morgan’s dad refers to Tony “Potts." You'll just have to wait to see what Tony refers to Steve as in his cell phone. I am open to hearing your guesses
Me: Oh by the way, the Princess said she will help Baby Bird not scribble the future. They’ve already developed tech to help their own gifted population, so helping one more wouldn’t be that hard.
“I may be Fitz from a different point in the timeline,” Leo suggested.
Counselor Laura: I can deal with an excited puppy.
May: If we just bring people back, it would overwhelm the system. We can’t do that. Especially because we’re not planning to rewind the clock five years.
Blue phone: Close. I worked at an underground gay bar, actually. At least, that's what they would be referred to now. I was more of a bartender though.
Yes I got your voicemail. I apologize for not responding sooner. I’ve been avoiding most calls due to the incident in Mumbai, the press are vicious. Your voicemail should’ve been passed to me earlier. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. Also by the time I listened to your message, it was after midnight in New York and it would just not be polite to call. That’s why decided to send an email instead.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely lovely.
“I thought they were just making a battle of New York biography movie?” Steve asked slightly confused,
Anthony: Part of me would love to know where you are, but it’s better that I don’t know. Let me know what you think of the statement that I’m sending you next.
“What does DILTF mean? I know that you use that in your address book for me." Steve must be trolling him. He has a teenager with friends. Tony is sure some of them have called him that.
Me: Friday did you just show that message to Steve too?
Tony: We both know it is a marriage of convenience, and no, it was Morgan. Howard was murdered when I was 21 because of his work with Shield. You know I try to avoid being Howard, and I don’t want to put myself at risk.
“No, I’m not that cruel. And besides, he was the one who bought that one.” Tony answered, just as Agent Davis showed up with their food.
“I don’t know if ‘fix’ is exactly the right word. Regardless, it will take a lot of work, including answering invasive icebreaker questions," Tony replied. “And maybe some medication.”
Nomad: He shouldn’t like me anymore after what happened. We were absolutely awful to each other.
“But we do love our kids.” Tony finished for Steve. “And without that cataclysmic event, we wouldn't have them."
Me: I don’t even know the answer to that. I would like to say since Sokovia, but I would be lying to myself. I think the problems started the moment I decided to actively participate in bringing the band back together post Shield implosion.
Tony: Yes. They survived Mrs. Purple Arrow’s alcoholism, so I think they’ll get for this too. They just need time and space to work it out.
"The beard and the biceps, but you're sexier." Tony said as he leaned over to kiss Steve on the mouth. He cherished every aspect of it because he knew his time with Steve was short. He was going to have to go back sooner than Wednesday, he just knew it.
Me: I’m going to hold you to that.
“At least another 30 minutes. Although, you could head over to the Zephyr now if you want. Are you texting Steve?” Phil asked.
“I think the biggest thing was Shield being in pieces and The Avengers not being on speaking terms. We've already fixed that. We actually have almost triple the number of Avengers along with the Puerto Rico squad.” Afia told everyone.
Anthony: I met Marvelous, not marvel this, but Ms. Marvel would be a cool superhero codename for when Kamala is not 11. I’m going to need to work on the voice rec software for this new operating system.
Me: I knew I should have L go over the LGTBA curriculum with you. I assume you never googled Tony Stark gay sex tape?
HSBF: Seriously, Tony!
Cuddle fiancé: Why?
Me: Ross, no, mostly because I’m pretty sure he’s more willing to believe you’re Hydra, then not heterosexual. They’re not intercepting my cell phone communications until after Friday does her magic and creates the fake ones for them to read. They just think I’m chatting up some cute 35-year-old that can’t possibly be Captain America because Captain America is the pinnacle of heterosexuality.
HSBF: Probably. I wonder who’s going to take over if your James does go to the State Department.
Tony: That just means Pepper does the money stuff. I do the creative stuff.
Me: As much as I want to keep texting you, I need to at least attempt a full night’s sleep before my DOD meeting tomorrow. Apparently, they think that my willingness to play nice with the UN means that I'll make them toys again.
Me: Friday, you are no longer allowed to hang out with AIDA. I think she's a bad influence on you.
SimmonsJA: Do you want me to set up a Skype session with Dr. Suarez?
There is a slight illusion to Captain Marvel in here towards the end of the chapter but I wrote it before I saw the movie and touched it up a little afterwards. It’s vague and not very spoiler heavy. All events in that movie are canon for this story. That’s all I’m saying for now.
Nomad: I’m sorry.
CoulsonPJ: Maybe a little for tactical reasons.
Anthony: Who are mad at me because we missed the Sangeet yesterday. Thankfully, you made a good first impression this morning, so we are invited to dinner Monday before they go back to the states.
Anthony: Little Anthony is always up for you, quite literally. Every other part of my anatomy, not so much. They're a little worried about me over exerting my heart due to my previous ‘condition’. I have a stress test in an hour. Dr. Simmons will not let me get out of it. She’s a little terrifying.
We’re trying to rebuild our relationship and maybe things will fall apart once we see each other in person. Maybe the scars are too deep to be fixed by copious amounts of text messages. I have to try though.
“So you’re not medically cleared?” Steve asked after he started to piece the argument together.
Nomad: Shouldn’t you be packing?
“The other thing is, I’m worried about what will happen if I have to be Stefan Carter long-term. Because it’s not like I’m going to get Clint’s deal."
“I know, but we also need to find a submarine carrying the ‘superior’,” Natasha explained.
Counselor Laura: That doesn’t surprise me. I assume that means Steve isn’t a fugitive anymore because the Mumbai agreement went through.
Me: You have a point. Hey did you change your name in my phone? You’re now listed as Tony Bear instead of Anthony.
HSBF: I already did. The good guys win. The bad guys don't and Sulu never did get to kiss his husband on screen. So let's talk about Pepper.
TMNS: See if there is hot chocolate in the kitchens and make a cup for you and MJ. I will do damage control. I always have your back.
Subject: Re: Yes, I got your text messages and sorry I was distracted by Stefan’s ads and ass.
I'll see you at 2 PM. That's when the next window is between the two timelines. Because of that, we are having an all-hands meeting. You will be there by then, right? Ana will give you details because I’m sleepy. Wanda, why did you do this to me?
Steve: Sometimes when you're half asleep, you call me Phil and I'll never be angry about that. It was my fault we lost. The Avengers were in pieces because of me and we lost.
Due to the sheer amount of movies/TV shows that MCU actors have shown up in, I feel that the best way around the celebrity paradox issue is that everybody has a look-alike thespian except for Samuel L. Jackson who may or may not be an LMD. Seriously, that man is in a lot of movies. He has 171 acting credits and counting. (The number has increased by three since I wrote the original draft of this chapter a month ago.)
Tony: Unfortunately, Senator Hateful is making this place worse by the moment, which I didn’t even think was possible. Thank Thor, most of her colleagues still think her proposals are too extreme.
Agent M: I cannot confirm that.
“Because you would be the one who would put them up,” Steve remarked. “You would turn the wedding into a Fourth of July party even if it was taking place at Christmas.”
Me: At least he’s mad at you for a reason that’s not me.
Ana Jr.: Since you are now speaking with me in the year 2018, the experiment was obviously successful
Hunter: Acknowledgment is the first step. I will help you get to where you want to go. I’ll be there in 20 minutes, with your cheese fries.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. You definitely keep me in the writing zone.
The Mechanic: And my boyfriend. He seriously has this self-preservation skills of a slug.
Anthony: Captain America has a statue in a park, more than one park. Despite being considered a ‘war criminal’, most of them haven’t been taken down yet.
The song Tony accidentally quotes a lyric from is Unkiss Me by Maroon 5. My iPod randomly played the song when I saw the Civil War trailer for the first time and I’ve associated it with the two ever since.
“It’s okay if you need to leave. I have Polly to talk to and my doctor. It will also give me time to write a letter to Steve or at least try to. I’m not sure what I should say to him,” James confessed.
Actually, Leo wished Daisy wasn’t there. Leo wasn’t planning to bring Daisy along because she was supposed to be in Mumbai right now, participating in the final negotiations and signing the agreement will replace the Sokovia Accords. It took more than a year, but the document that will become the Mumbai Agreement for the protection of Enhanced and Gifted Individuals was becoming something much better than the Accords that preceded it. Leo also made sure that no one could use the document to create the dystopic reality that the Doctor was responsible for in the framework. His ability to associate with various Senators and other government officials in his capacity at SI made putting those safeguards in a lot easier than in his previous role.
Spoiler warning: This chapter also draws heavily from Agents of SHIELD up to episode 99/5.11 as well as the scenes in episodes 5. 15 and 5.16 that take place before episode 15.11 chronologically. There is also some Infinity War foreshadowing in this conversation, and therefore, spoilers for Infinity War. But hey, we are in a different timeline and one thing from the movie is definitely not coming to past here, which is Tony and Pepper being engaged. More notes after you read including who is who.
“Of course, Mr. Thompson.” Ana was only slightly annoyed with him. She switches to Eugene when she’s really upset. If they survive this, he is definitely changing his first name. And possibly his last name as well.
If anybody needs to discuss episode four of the Falcon and the Winter Soldier, you can find me on Twitter or even discord. I have a similar username on both services. You can also PM me through fanfiction.net. I have thoughts.
Tony: I think Steve wants Central Park in spring. And since it is Central Park, it must obviously be daytime. I’ll have Mary look into wedding planners. Or I can ask Simmons who she’s getting. Monkey lover 1 says she has three binders already filled with wedding stuff. I expect a save the date any minute. I know they are thinking March or April of next year.
Me: Sorry, the ATCU.
Red phone: You are a fucking moron. Why the fuck did you go in there and take on 30 guys with guns by yourself? You almost died, you sanctimonious prick.
Tony Potts: Probably with professional help. Do we have professional help yet?
“Whatever happened doesn’t sound very good.” Steve said pulling him back down onto the bed. He was shirtless. Bless him.
How can you be trapped between dimensions? Apparently, it all involve something called dark matter and some book called the Darkhold or as Leo refers to it as the evil book of everything. One quick read and apparently you become walking evil with the knowledge of all things.
Blue phone: Most people didn't know. Back then, it could get you arrested or killed. Still can in some countries in the world which I hate. I never really told anybody, Bucky didn't even know. Although, apparently Peggy did.
Me: Well I can’t ask you the actual question since you actually do have the mind and body of a 30-year-old and yet you were only born less than a year after my father.
Counselor Laura from 2023: You need to do that fast. Tony and Steve 2023 think that we can prevent Thanos from completing the gauntlet in your timeline by sending the stones to their timeline.
D Fitzsimmons: Alcoholic would be putting it nicely. Nana is not okay and hasn't been for well over five years.
Me: How horrible. Would you like to administer detention instead?
Anthony: Deputy Director Mace and his bodyguard/minion just walked into the room which means lie detector time. Write to you later, Muffin.
CoulsonPJ: The villain tried to keep him away, but he was able to get out by himself because he’s that strong. They're blaming Quake for it, by the way, despite not being seen in the New York Metro since she rescued Ms. Marvel and her family from the Watchdogs.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Also thank you to everybody who has left kudos or added the story to your alerts. Every little bit keeps me happy and writing. This is another long one.
Nomad: I hope I am too. I’m happy that you sent out the release because this means you’re moving forward. I’m proud of you.
Blue phone: You don't have to.
FRIDAY: Possibly. But I am uncertain because I still do not have access to the documents, despite the fact they been recently digitized.
“Neither did you. Silver lining this means that you kissed him before I did.” MJ joked.
Venom: It was for the best. I don’t really want to talk about it right now.
Anthony: That’s blasphemy. A part of me is hoping that Natasha will show up just to choke them with her thighs on screen.
Therapist Laura: Of course he is. Tell Clint that I did smack Coulson the first time I saw him. More importantly he let me which is probably Coulson’s way of saying sorry, he had to keep playing dead. Although I do understand why he kept up the charade after Hydra came out of the shadows.
Venom: A lot. This morning I found out why Peter is not going to make a move on you this summer because our field trip is probably going to get called off on account of a giant purple alien that wants to wipe out half of the universe. Also, apparently, that already happened once. I was part of the 50% that was wiped out of existence.
Tony wanted to deepen the kiss so laid himself down on Steve’s body. However, as he moved, the bulge in his jeans brushed against Steve’s hard cock and he moaned loudly into Tony’s mouth. That glorious sound drove Tony insane. As he came up for air, he cautiously placed his hand on Steve’s cock, examining his reaction. Steve’s eyes rolled back in his head as he arched up into Tony’s hand and let out a noise that was music to Tony’s ears. He started kissing Steve again, although more enthusiastically this time. He rocked his hips into Steve in time with his hand pulling on Steve’s dick.
Once Tony was fully on edge Steve finally removed his fingers. Tony whimpered at the loss and took a few deep breaths to come back into reality.
Steve’s room was right next door to Nat’s so they both knew they had to be as quiet as possible but when Tony started thrusting on to him, the blonde couldn’t help but let out a loud moan that filled the whole room. Tony quickly placed his mouth back on Steve's in order to quiet him a little bit, and of course because he wanted to kiss that damn mouth for as long as he could because for all he knew, this could be the one and only time he will get to.
“I had a good teacher, Mr Stark”
“I am worried Tony, how did that happen?” Steve asked the brunette, but he knew the answer.
“Just stay there for a moment, please.” Tony said quietly.
“Stop Steve, holy shit I’m gonna cum!”
“But I was having so much fun.” Steve pouted.
“As long as it’s personal.” The man responded, still looking away from Tony.
“I think we really have a connection. I don’t want to seem so forward but would it be at all possible to get your number?”
“Like you did?” Steve retorted, looking Tony up and down. The tingling returned as Tony couldn’t help but enjoy Steve looking at him like that.
“Only people who are trying to sleep with me.” She glanced at him for a moment.
“Steve.” The blonde tried to hide the fact he was now smiling a bit too.
“Then why are you crying? Please be honest if I am hurting you.” Steve was slightly dejected. He felt like he’d hurt one of the few people he really cared about at the one time they put their full trust in him and that that person was now lying to him about it.
“Well that’s where you’re wrong Cap, I would’ve gotten a lot out of it. Just being able to touch your dick would be an honour,” They both chuckled at that, “and to also hear the noises and see your face as you reached a climax that I had given to you, that would be a blessing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hope you know I didn’t mean it when I said that. I mean, technically it’s true but that’s not me, not the real me. That’s just what society sees of me because it’s easier that way. I’d rather some people hate me for someone I’m not then everyone hating me for who I actually am.”
“I’m straight.” Steve defended.
“What do you mean?” Steve started blushing slightly as he leant over to his bedside table which had lube in the top drawer.
“Tony, you seriously think I’m out of your league? I’m just a kid from Brooklyn, you’re the, how did you so gracefully put it, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist? You’re the one who’s out of my league.”
“Holy shit, Steve, you’re fucking huge” Tony whined.
“They’re for a friend.” The welcoming look on the man’s face disappeared and he walked away from Tony.
“Oh my god, Tony, I’m so sorry. I’m such an idiot!”
They were both very aware that the only thing between them now was a thin sheet and that drove them crazy. Steve flipped them over so Tony was now on the bed and pulled away from the kiss. He immediately focused his mouth on Tony’s neck; sucking, kissing and licking him. Tony couldn’t help but moan Steve’s name. Getting a hickey was surprisingly a brand new experience for Tony, it was always him giving a girl one as he had endless emotionless sex. Tony’s nerves were going crazy - Steve was driving him insane. The sheet had slipped slightly in the spin so the tip of Tony’s dick was brushing against Steve’s abs. He swore he was going to cum any minute just from this.
She analysed him for a moment before agreeing to write her number down in a small gap on his crowded piece of paper. As she did so, Tony looked across the street to see a beautiful blond walking in his direction. He was frozen for a moment, stunned and shocked that he had never seen this person before. He was tall, cute and muscular - the kind of person Tony would have known. Abena barely had the chance to finish writing before Tony snatched the list out of her hand, yelling ‘thank you’ back to her as he ran across the road to meet the mysterious stranger. Tony never approached men in this way before, but this guy would never have talked to him if he hadn't, and Tony needed to know more about him.
They were both already sweating. Steve bent down and kissed Tony before slowly moving in and out of him. He bit down on Tony’s lip and the brunette let out a loud moan. Tony had never felt anything like this before and he never wanted it to stop, he was in paradise.
“What do you mean you ‘ruined everything’? What did you ruin?”
“Put him through” Tony called out to J.A.R.V.I.S. from under the engine of his personalised red and gold Audi.
They both had one last passionate kiss before getting in a more sleep suited position with a cover over them. They both wanted to be close to each other so ended up spooning, Tony being the little spoon, of course.
“It felt fucking good so dont apologise. Besides, I think they suit me, don’t you Cap?”
Tony placed his hand on the blonde’s head and pulled him down into a long kiss. Steve picked up his pace again, however this time he had managed to directly hit Tony’s prostate which caused the brunette to call out Steve’s name in pleasure. At that, Steve placed a hand on Tony’s cock and started tugging on it in time with his fast, hard strokes and started biting on his neck, just below his ear. Tony was in ecstasy and by now his moans were incoherent, which of course Steve loved.
“You ready, Stark?”
“Uh, yeah, um, why are you carrying a magazine with 2 men making out on the cover?”
An embarrassed grin appeared on Tony’s face. He forgot just how cocky he makes himself sound. Truthfully he just used that as a defence mechanism to cover his insecurities and self loathing. Basically everything he did was a defence mechanism. He slept with so many women because the second he started showing any interest in men his dad would scold him so he tried to ‘cure himself’. It (obviously) didn’t work because he still preferred men. When his dad died, that pressure was replaced by the pressure of society. He decided a man-slut would be a better image for the son of Howard Stark than a bisexual man. He had actually never slept with a man, when he was about 18-19 he kissed a few guys when he was drunk at parties but that was it.
“Hmm no underwear, Stark?” Steve mumbled into his mouth as his finger grazed against Tony’s cock.
side note: i watched Brokeback Mountain a while ago so couldn’t fully remember what happens so that bit is kinda brief😂 i also didn’t realise jake gyllenhaal was in it until i googled it to make sure i had the right title😂
Tony laughed to himself. As everyone drank their coffee, Tony noticed they were one short so went to go find Steve, it wasn’t like him to be running late.
“Wasn’t it just?” Steve said breathlessly. Even a super solider gets tired after passionate sex.
“That’s a great answer.” Tony smirked
Tony’s eyes quickly opened and he turned his body so that he was now looking at Steve, faces only centimetres apart. He smiled and gave the blonde a small peck on the lips.
let me know what you think in the comments! :)
“When we were kissing you got a little excited and bit my lip, kinda hard” Hand still wrapped around Steve’s dick, Tony started blushing slightly.
“Only if I’m the one who put them there.”
“What are you doing?”
Steve knew how to arouse Tony and it was certainly working.
“Well, generally, chairs are used for sitting on” Tony said, lightheartedly mocking Steve.
They kissed for a few very heated minutes and were both rock hard by the end of it. When they pulled away for air they both stared for a moment, examining each other’s lust filled eyes and sweaty, flushed faces. Steve wanted Tony and he thought Tony wanted him but frowned slightly when he realised he was still in his uncomfortable jeans. He could see the massive bulge in his pants and was about to tell him to take them off when he realised something.
The blond looked slightly confused at him but still didn’t say anything.
next chapter will be coming soon!😁
“Because it feels so good to have you inside of me. It feels so right that you and I are doing this together. I’m happy, you idiot.” Tony smirked and Cap laughed. It wasn’t like Tony to get all emotional on people but it was like him to make fun of them.
“I am aware and I can feel that too.” Steve jested.
Tony opened his eyes and Steve winked at him. The brunette chuckled and closed his eyes again, pleasure refilling all of his senses.
The blonde wasn’t really listening though as he was too in awe, scanning every detail of every inch of the man in front of him. He noticed a few scars on Tony’s left arm and brushed his fingers over them. He smiled at the small bit of hair that created a trail between Tony’s navel and his cock.
“Please Steve, I need a guy in me. I need YOU in me” Tony was practically begging at this point and Steve couldn’t say no, and truth be told, he did want to be on top. He’d just have to make sure he wasn’t too rough as he knew Tony wouldn’t say anything if it started to hurt.
“I didn’t actually know until I saw the video that Bucky killed your parents. I suspected it was him because I knew Hydra was involved, but I couldn’t find evidence that it was 100% him until that video. I just didn’t know how to explain that to you back then.” Considering what he knows now about Hydra’s multiple attempts to kill his family members, Steve’s uncertainty was 100% warranted.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I'm OK, Lily bear. Although me and Ana are going to have some words when I get back.
“She’s drawn a picture of you like that?" Steve asked, sounding concerned.
Me: It does make me happy that he hasn’t found you yet.
Nomad: He admitted that he had a crush on me when he was a kid, but he didn’t answer when I asked if he still had a crush on me.
CoulsonPJ: By that point, I think he will be sufficiently distracted by the package publicly announcing his return. I doubt he will still be a problem.
“They are currently unavailable at this time,” Karen replied.
“Always. I mean, you don’t have to do me tonight. You just need to focus on something else for a moment. You can always do some drawing,” Tony suggested. “I feel like that your version of tinkering.”
Captain Tight Pants: Text message boyfriend???
Tony: You do that. Talk to you later, Sugar Bunny.
DILF: You still do some SI work. It's understandable. Also, your nanny doubles as a bodyguard.
“I bet that’s annoying,” was the only thing he said out loud.
Me: You made me the stepfather of somebody I kissed.
To be continued:
Me: Finally, real Coulson wasn’t there.
Love: And yet Anthony’s BFF is now in charge of the new version of my former employer.
Text messages from the life of a teenage LMD navigating the halls of Midtown School of Science and Technology the best way that she can.
I don’t feel so good with what happened Monday night. I’m the reason why [redacted] father knows that he’s like me. Everything came out after the web up. It wasn’t pretty. [redacted] cried. A lot. He also wants to know why his daddy doesn’t love him anymore. I thought that Aunt [redacted] reacted badly, but she was just worried. She never once thought that something was wrong with me or wanted me to just be normal again. She didn’t ask the Shield team to fix me, like he did. Like the powers were some disease that needed to be cured. She just wants me to be safe. But Mr. [redacted] didn’t quite see it that way. I’m going to patrol around his house until my junior counterpart moves upstate.
Tony: Please tell me there’s video? Also, why did you not tell me this while we were still together in person?
: Shield Agent Alphonso "Mack" Mackenzie. Dating UN Avengers member Elena Rodriguez.
Steve: Or me and May could take the kids back to Brooklyn and let you and Pepper have some quality time.
"I aim for us to be far away by that point. I'm sure I can find something to occupy our time locally." Natasha remarked. That's when Sam walked over to hug her.
Nomad: I'm sure you would after your house got blown up.
Monkey lover 2: Maybe. I’m at least inclined to believe that the future is not as finite as I believed previously. Let’s leave it at that.
Time sent: 9/2/2016 7:01:41
MayMQ: You can apologize for not telling him that you were alive.
Director Snookums: However, usually in the guise of trying to help someone.
Stephen C: I would like to see you there. Bring Phil.
Me: Yes, but with us being who we are, we wouldn’t want to give the real answers publicly. Nor should we.
Purple Arrow: How’s that going? Stark and Rogers had a breakthrough?
Me: No, I don’t. I actually kind of love you and wish you would stop putting yourself in danger. Coulson had to come save you. Coulson! This is the guy who got shanked by Loki and he had to come rescue your ass.
Tony: I don't think I should answer that question. Otherwise, I'm going to end up on the couch for the next month.
Monkey lover 2: Your only marriage.
The new consultant: Benji is going to kill you. Although knowing her, she's just going to tell them to be safe. May 2 already offered to get me female condoms. She is okay with him being with both of us.
Purple arrow: Also, Laura said no because Laura has taste.
Melinda: Clever idea.
Me: Okay Agent America just called me “大愚弱智”. So it’s probably time for me to go.
Counselor Laura: Yes, with the god-awful flip phone that Steve gave him and you just kept texting, and apparently, you’re much better at texting each other than talking in person. Eventually, you became friends and then more than friends or rather that's what happened with the Stark-Rogers.
Ana Junior: It is already on the list. However, my main objective is to acquire the locations of all the stones in 2018.
Me: You are very skilled at that but I don’t think it would have made me sign the Accords. Also, please remember who’s probably reading this.
Director Stark: Kid, you should’ve led with that. Ana, why wasn’t I informed?
“She’s going to come up after our meeting with the other timeline. She just wanted to go over the Shield reports first.” That makes sense.
Me: Rhodey said something about his agency using the same classification system that all the other agencies use because he is not dealing with learning an entirely new classification system. Although he is thinking about doing random polygraphs like normal agencies do drug testing..
BITC: That explains so much. Actually, I’ve been monitoring superhero chatter. Apparently, there are pictures of Joey reassembling Thor’s hammer in Norway that are starting to crop up on social media platforms. And your big brother lifting it.
Chief Mechanic: Because you’re less terrifying than Agent America. I'm still wrapping my head around the fact that I have a biological child. You know, made the old-fashioned way.
Me: Although the fact my BFF is now in charge of the ragtag bunch of misfits that Coulson scavenged from the ashes does not keep him from making questionable decisions like keeping me in charge of the new Avengers.
Venom: I think we have established that I’m an idiot.
Anthony: OK, how about for our first date, I will just text you snarky things from the charity ball Friday. That way we can hang out and I can keep my sanity intact.
HSBF: Raising teenage superheroes is hard.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: Other May. Apparently, I need to learn defensive driving.
HSBF: So I just saw my “ex-boyfriend” dragged out of his house in handcuffs by the FBI on six different news channels. The words collusion, Stark Industries, and attempted murder were also on screen. Is there something you need to tell me?
“I think you can choose names after you rescue my boyfriend, if you’re capable of such,” Simmons remarked.
FRIDAY: Please review the unaltered transcript.
“Not that much. He seems to be developing a stronger relationship with Michelle. Although sometimes he cries about his deceased uncle. The one-year anniversary of his death is November 20.”
Anthony: I didn't do as good of a job as I thought I did getting rid of the footage of your brief romantic infatuation with her. I did actually scorch the earth regarding the security footage of you two making out, but I didn't think that I needed to get rid of the footage of you and 13 all cozy at the hotel post funeral. That may be enough for Ross to put two into together.
Agent Johnson: Robin’s drawings were right. Odin just past and Thor is now crackling electricity. Oh shit!
Me: Yes.
Me: Yes. Here’s hoping I find an assistant who is not an ax murderer or super villain. Also someone not willing to kill me via foods I’m allergic to would be great. Is that so much to ask for?
“Some days, I wish they found me sooner, or I never went in the ocean. But then, if things were different, I would not have met you. I wouldn’t have met May or have Robin as my daughter. If Pauly didn’t die, I wouldn’t have Robin either. If the snap didn’t happen, I wouldn’t have Kamala. It feels weird that something so horrible can lead to such good things.” Steve lamented.
Me: I thought the name of the DC football team was a racial slur? Do you think you’re going to be in DC that long?
Tony Potts: OK, I don’t think I want to know.
Did you notice that this story is not marked as complete? That’s because we have two more post-credit scenes. However, they gave away some stuff for the early chapters of the SQL and therefore I have decided to post the final post-credit chapters in a couple of weeks. However, chapters from Text Messages from the Edge of High School will be uploaded in the interim.
Stephen C: Yo-Yo said the director had to knock you out in the armor.
Time sent: 11/10/2016 16:11:41
Then you took Steve too and I hate you for that. I know I never really had him, but now I can’t even pretend that he’s my friend anymore. Everything is a fucking mess. I just want to crawl into a bottle again and I can’t. I just need to get through these next couple of days. I’m not sure I will.
To be continued…
I thought I was supposed to have winter spy school during the break. Although, I’m okay with that happening somewhere in Europe. Aunt [redacted] never really gets to have a vacation. The last time was years ago when we drove to Disney. That was before [redacted] died.
Me: Stop worrying. They have both been safely delivered to your undisclosed locations.
Blue phone: I thought you guys were just on the break?
Lily bear 2018: Is Uncle Tony with you?
Me: Saturday is going to be one year since his uncle/real dad was murdered. He’s going to need emotional support.
“I hate to interrupt this conversation, but six androids and General Hale are trying to kidnap Agent Coulson.”
Tony: Which apparently is for the best. I get why this is hard. It can’t be easy to tell your BFF that you’re now dating the guy who tried to kill him a little under five months ago. I wonder if anybody makes an “I’m sorry I took my anger out on you for doing something that you had no control over” bouquet or apology gift basket.
“Not new. It’s something that I’ve been planning for a little while, but with all the stuff going on recently on that side of the country and Yo-Yo’s recent relocation, it just made sense. Also with Carter keeping an eye on Lane we could have more recruits soon. Maybe she will even find the Pyms, who shouldn’t have even been brought into the Accords mess in the first place,” Tony explained.
Nomad: You did.
Nomad: I think that's possible.
Me: That’s good.
CoulsonPJ: As I said he’s fine. Some scrapes and bruises that will probably be healed by the time we dropped him off in Queens. He heals faster than your boyfriend.
Francis: I’m not even surprised by the impending marriage. I guess this really is the darkest timeline. Who’s fighting?
Friday: Mister Stark had to leave to finish a project. He will contact you again as soon as time permits.
Stephen C: Yes. Apparently, I’m getting better at undercover work. Also did Sharon really leave the CIA for the FBI?
Anthony: Are you aware that Friday sent out a mass email to all our friends informing them that we are dating?
“Although maybe not tell him that you’re dating me for a little bit.”
The new consultant: Are you familiar with Clark’s third law?
MayMQ: It’s a possibility, although he was mistaken for Chris Evans twice this morning.
Subject: Re: Seriously, Tony! Call me!
Chief Mechanic: She's still alive in 2023. Although I wouldn’t exactly refer to her as well.
The consultant: No, because he also likes you. He enjoyed kissing you more than Liz.
Me: She did? Is she OK?
Ana Jr.: They are working on an enhanced communications project. They're trying to get a message to Agent Johnson.
Me: Seriously, how did you not realize this before suffering extreme bodily harm? He calls you Cuddle Bunny. Cuddle bunny!!! Are the good drugs helping you realize things?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: Yes. Oh, Afia says hi.
You may now commence with throwing cyber tomatoes at me for this cliffhanger.
“Yes, they are.”
Red phone: Not literally. I said it in a more diplomatic way that would not result in you yelling “Language” at me.
Dear Dr. Stark:
Cuddle Bunny: I am not having phone sex with you. I never had sex with Sharon. Or are you talking about Melinda?
Tony Potts: You’re right. Oh, I’m going to have to call Build-a-Bear.
“And Coulson too?”
“Listen to your little friend. You are aware that if I wanted to destroy you, I could.” Loki boasted.
Agent 13, I doubt your presence would have changed their plan of attack except they probably would've attacked you as well. Actually, they would've attacked you first.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I know who you think I am. You always put me on this pedestal of normalcy. You didn’t want me to be a part of your world. But I can’t love you and not be part of this world. I can’t pretend that there aren’t special children that need me, that there are heroes that need me. Maybe it was an accident that I was brought here, but I am needed in this 2023.
Cuddle Bunny: I’m not ready to talk to her yet about my problems.
Cuddle Bunny: Go to sleep Tony. Text me when you’re arrested.
“No we’re here to talk about your relationship with Stark. Although, it’s nice to know that you’ve actually dated someone else in the century. It makes me a little less concerned,” Natasha tells him.
Tony: This does not surprise me.
HSBF: Oh God. So they really think it’s her?
Football Hunter: Which baby bird?
“It’s going to be okay.” Leo tried to reach for Simmons, but she pulled away.
FRIDAY: However, Sir does.
“Which is why we have already successfully ruled out the possibility of you being an LMD.” She said walking into the room itself, not the safe observation area.
Counselor Laura: What happened to Polly?
Nomad: I just wish I knew what to say to make you feel better.
Me: Do you think he would do that?
“Can we make one of our other good qualities we have excellent taste in food?”
“We’re not the same person. Well genetically we are but we are more like identical twins. Well, mostly. His time in space altered his DNA a little bit. It’s really quite fascinating.” Fitz started to ramble.
Tony Potts: Although we are still going to have to give them what we have to make it go faster. They’re working on a deadline. We are not.
Red phone: People are twitchy now that there are hundreds of people walking around with powers or enhancements and we are the poster children for enhanced people.
MayMQ: Twitter is always a mess.
“Even though it was perfectly normal back then.”
Anthony: Because I think Friday likes Wanda best, which is weird considering Friday’s origins and the fact that Wanda and Vision are doing their best to act like teenagers.
Me: Two and a milkshake. Although it does feel weird being halfway around the world and still having burgers and a shake.
Me: I forgot to tell you last time, Fitz put a ring on it. Actually, it was the other way around, since Simmons did the actual proposing. Although, Simmons is showing off her engagement ring to everybody right now. I’m glad Rhodey Bear was able to spare them even though he and Agent had to stay in DC along with Daisy. You have no idea how much I’m looking forward to lab time with Spidey senior, Leo, and Fitzsimmons.
“Watch the wedding,” Steve whispered.
Cuddle bunny: What did Howard say about me?
"And I rather not have to talk to Sharon twice in the same day. Ana, send her a quick email that says I will call her after my 2 o’clock business meeting.”
“Are you certain of that?” Jemma asked.
Venom: I don’t think I needed your BFF to know I’m not straight. If this is all over school Monday, I will punch your best friend out.
TMNS: You ended up living with the Stark-Rogers for a year. You became the target of a terrorist group because you’re friends with Afia, and Damien told everybody that you’re Inhuman. The watchdogs almost killed you twice. Me and Afia were the only ones who kept it from happening. I don’t want to put you in danger again, and knowing the truth would’ve done that. It’s a dangerous secret.
Counselor Laura: September.
Tony: No
Venom: I just realized you were probably always holding back because you’re a superhero. So, we're not going to talk about the spider in the room?
HSBF: Actually Stephen Carter could give the Peggy answer because isn’t she kind of his mother-in-law. Did I ever thank you for doing that? Seriously you made me related to her.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. I’m sorry I forgot to mention this last time, but all times are Steve’s time zone. We are just going to assume that Steve happens to be in the same time zone as South Africa. You’re getting this in under a week because this is probably the last quiet moment on vacation I will have. The next chapter will probably not be posted before August 5.
TMNS: Hey, I’m up now. If you’re texting me, I assume it’s safe for me to text you.
Me: Why do I have a feeling that's not the name of an amusement park?
“I’m not sure yet,” Leo actually blushed.
To be continued…
FRIDAY: Of course, Sir.
Blue phone: My mom's favorite color was lavender. She always looked best in purple, but it was an expensive color back then. So she only had a few things. It's just every time I see the color I think of her and it gives me a warm feeling inside.
“That’s obviously number two.”
Anthony: I remember everything from when it happened. Aunt Peggy picked me up from school which should’ve been the first sign something was wrong. She got me ice cream and then we ended up spending the night at some big fancy hotel that I can’t even remember the name of. Although I do remember guards being outside. That should have been sign number two that something was really wrong.
StarkAE: Friday, if you do not want to become the AI to Spidey‘s cell phone, and I mean Spidey Junior‘s kids Stark phone, you will get that video off now. I prefer there not to be any references to what happened to my parents out there.
Football Hunter: OK, the bastard recognized you and contacted her. Then your mum contacted Simmons, and she isn't the best liar.
Me: It really is. So you were right. Her death threats against you were just the shovel talk. She was jealous.
Morgan’s dad: Possibly. On the one hand, she's incredibly good at getting you to talk about things that you may not otherwise talk about.
CoulsonPJ: They’re not all the same groups. The deputy director is sad because he really wants the shield himself. I think he may have cried a little when he realized that you actually took it with you.
The boss: And you didn’t think to warn me?
Me: Okay, I am pretty sure this was really revenge for forgetting to disable my pornographic text message filter when I promised Snookums that I would stop covering up talking to you with dirty, pornographic and expletive filled text messages about the various ways and locations I would like to give Cuddle Bunny fellatio.
“May is going to kill you when she wakes up,” Okay, now Hunter really wants to know what happened to Agent May.
May: He would be furious.
HSBF:  I don’t really sing to myself. Although, I have sung to James. People in comas can hear you when you speak to them. So I thought I would try the last time I saw him. Just an old lullaby from when we were kids. Although it’s been a few months. I haven’t seen him since we started talking to one another. My work has been keeping me away, though.
Me: OK. You’re starting to know me too well. We talked for five minutes and most of that was during a 'family photo' for the various social media feeds. Apparently we need to publicize my good deeds right now to reassure everyone I am alive and kicking after the foundation scandal.
“You’re really going to shoot me?” Simmons asked.
Me: Sharon has another theory. She believes his wife found out that her husband fucked an Avenger, but didn't know exactly which one. Since I am the only one that's openly bi, I became the lucky winner. She conveniently forgot about Scarlet and the spider.
I know you're worried about what happened in Siberia mostly because I didn't explain what really happened. I decided to go along with the Accords, not because I trust Ross, but mostly because I don't trust him and I believed that if I was part of the system, then I could make sure the man didn't create enhanced person internment camps. There was also this other part of me that thought if I managed to create some limits, maybe you would be willing to come back. I’m trying to decide if thinking you would come back was more wishful thinking, assuming Ross didn’t screw everybody over. I’m still torn.
HSBF: Because Happy kept caring around an engagement ring for years, even after the breakup.
CoulsonPJ: Focus Stark. Otherwise I'll call May over to brief you directly. She really wants to kill your driver.
Me: More TV appearances?
Nomad: It's a date.
As you're aware, I am most honest when drunk text messaging, which is probably another reason why writing sober emails to you is so difficult. By some miracle he didn't delete it, but responded back. So, for the last 3 1/2 months, we’ve been talking to each other. Really talking to each other, but more importantly listening to what the other one is saying and we realized that we both made mistakes and a hell of a lot of wrong calls. We also realized that there's no easy solution. No magic button to make everything right again. We're still trying to fix us. It's a work in progress, but it's something I want to keep working on. I don't know where it's going to lead, but I think it will lead somewhere good.
Tony Potts: What were these childhood lies?
Nomad: But I should have.
Me: Okay mingling is not a smart idea.
HSBF: What does that mean?
Me: Yes, it was. First, other Ross was there, a.k.a. poor man’s Coulson. Yes, I called him that to his face.
Me: I think I told you before yes and that is still the case. Sleeping with him didn’t make that go away. Actually, it kind of made it worse. Love and sex are two different things. But it can be a form of intimacy.
Red phone: Kids do love you and they need their own personal superhero. When this is all over, I'll pay for it.
“Which apparently will have no food which explains why you’re feeding me now. Can Steve come to this one?" Tony asked with a pout.
Steve: I was never a Boy Scout—Way too queer.
“You want me to try to talk to Clint?” Laura asked.
Francis: That must be awkward for you.
May: Point, it’s why Shield always had in-house programs before Hydra, not just for addiction but also PTSD and depression. Andrew tried to get me into treatment after Bahrain, but I wouldn’t go.
Boss: Who apparently doesn’t stand a chance against Cuddle Bunny stubbornness because he wouldn’t be in this fucked up situation right now if he could. I doubt Cuddle Bunny even realizes that he’s saving those kidnapped by terrorists because he could never save Bucky Bear.
Genius Princess 2018: We have yet to build a quantum tunnel, and I think we’re going to need Pym particles in addition to the White monolith. It may take time to negotiate access to the particles.
Me: Definitely not busy.
Anthony: Well obviously you two have kissed and made up after the tranquilizer/jaw breaking incident.
Tony: Maybe I’ll wait until tomorrow when we’re in the air. I just want the next few hours to be just us and hopefully Yo-Yo will be so busy sending dirty IMs to her boyfriend that she won’t pour water on us.
Me: Maybe you can just mention the boarding school thing. Friday, what’s the next question?
Me: No one tried to kill me.
Me: That’s good.
Melinda: Please don’t bring that up.
“You know I do.”
“The kids are worth it. I got to make pizza with the kids before we drove out to the private jet. There was a lot of crying.”
“This trip was definitely worth it because I now have like 50 photos of you being cuddled by the kids. You’re adorable when you’re being cuddled by a four-year-old.” Tony remarked. “She will be five soon. She’s getting so big. I’m pretty sure she grew half an inch while I was at the compound.”
Thank you to everyone who read or review the last conversation. You are all wonderful. Because I am going to be at Awesome Con this weekend, you are getting this chapter today. This is going to be intense.
Mood music: Climax by Usher
If you need me, you have the number.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Your encouragement is beautiful and helpful.
BITC: You have a guilt complex. That is why you let Clara throw red paint on you and call you the merchant of death Jr.
Tony Bear: No, because she would have punched out business leader number two for grabbing her ass and then I would have to oversee getting her out of jail in a foreign country. That never goes well.
Tony: Okay. It’s not okay but I’ll deal with it. I always do.
Purple Arrow: Someone told you about the kids?
“Anton Ivanov.”
"Do you want to talk about why the board is upset that you have a boyfriend?" Steve asked, trying to get this conversation to move in the right direction. Steve is starting to learn that it’s just as difficult to do this in person, as it was in text message format.
“That’s good to know. And maybe it would be good for the Reyes brothers to be in separate countries for a little while. By the way, I didn’t read them. So I had no idea that happened until you told me,” Phil explained.
HSBF: Consent exercise?
(See the end of the chapter for
Anthony: Well, that would’ve been an option if I wanted to kill Agent Agent again or get you killed by him. I like you both alive.
Purple Princess: Ana isn't supposed to upload those files to the Internet.
TMNS: We have Avengers Ben & Jerry’s.
BITC: Holy shit! What happened Friday? Benji just said he accidentally took his mask off in front of Flash.
Me: However, if Rice is confirmed, I agreed to be nominated for the position of Deputy Secretary.
Nomad: I didn't want to invade his privacy. Also, you do realize that bisexuals existed in the 1940s?
Me: Because you always find orgasms relaxing. I’m looking forward to Christmas too.
Melinda: Yes, because Director Mace wanted a return to the S.H.I.E.L.D brand even though Agent Burroughs argued against it. Mace thought Shield’s image could be rehabilitated. Burroughs was right.
Me: Mr. and Mrs. Purple Arrow have successfully worked things out, I think. The divorce papers have been shredded at least. Also, I may have walked in on activities that I don’t want to discuss because apparently the royal super genius can break my encryption.
“I’ve been essentially functioning as an intermediary between the two of you for the last five years and I need you to work through your problems. We need him to have a chance. Simmons is not well, and Bruce doesn’t completely understand what he’s doing. Deke almost knew what he was doing, but he’s missing now. I don’t like saying this, but Morgan’s dad is our only hope right now.”
Friday: I will take care of it.
Me: I think it’s best if I don’t know if that’s the state or the country.
Me: Mostly me. Do you know that I cried the entire way to the airstrip in Johannesburg? I’m jittery here without you.
Tony: Expendable forces/less dead people. Instead of sending an actual agent into a situation that will probably kill them, you can send an LMD. For example, if we knew about The Vultures attack in advance we could’ve staffed the cargo plane with LMDs and therefore I would not have the blood of two shield agents on my hands because of Happy’s insecurities.
“Like what you see Stark?” joked Steve as he leaned against the doorframe, noticing Tony looking at his body for longer than normal.

As the kiss deepened, Tony moved all the way down into Steve, not even a crack of air separated their torsos now. The cold arc reactor stimulated the nerves in the blondes chest and somehow turned him on even more and he gripped Tony hair hard, careful not to hurt him (too much). Quickly, Steve moved his hands down to the fly of Tony’s jeans and started to undo it. He broke the kiss for just a second to look for reassurance from Tony. The brunette gave a small nod and then restarted the kiss, excited about what he knew was about to happen and more comfortable from the relief of pressure in his pants.
i got slightly carried away in this chapter but i just wanted it be be perfect and i'm quite happy with the result :)
“Well I was a horny teenager and I had just seen a picture of the hottest man to ever walk the Earth, can you blame me? And it didn’t help that my dad wouldn’t shut up about you because everything he said you did made you more and more attractive. Then, two years ago, just as I was finally getting over the crush, I actually met you and everything came flooding back and more. I never said anything because I presumed there was no chance you could feel the same way because, let’s face it, you’re way out of my league and I’m not gonna lie, I totally thought you were straight.”
“Oh my god, Steve, shit, I’m going to cum!” Tony managed to force out in between other random noises of pleasure.
“I said a lot of stuff in the past hour and a half Steve, and unsurprisingly, I don’t actually remember most of it.” Tony said in a sleep dazed voice.
“Holy shit, it’s 4:15! Tony we have to be up at 8!”
Steve nodded and squirted some lube on his fingers, chucking the bottle on the bed next to Tony. Steve leant forward and kissed him deeply, occasionally biting his lip. He took Tony by surprise when he finally inserted a finger. Tony let out a loud moan of pleasure into Steve’s mouth and the blonde started to move his finger in and out causing even more pleasure for Tony.
I have a boyfriend now. We’ve been together for a few months. Although, I’m not entirely sure how many. I’m going to ask him what day we are counting as our actual anniversary. It started as a long-distance relationship. It still is for the moment. But we knew each other before I had to adapt to a more nomadic lifestyle. I’m hoping that will change soon. My boyfriend is working on it, and he usually gets what he wants.
BITC: Benji told me some of that earlier. Along with telling me that I shouldn’t be jealous of his relationship with Flash because it was different. I just realized Benji used relationship and not friendship. So that means something, doesn’t it?
Me: On both sides.
Me: I don’t think it’s possible to get used to the yearly apocalypse. I would be worried if you ever did.
“Yes, she is gifted. For Robin, time is not linear. She sees the past,” the Princess points to the picture of the blonde lady and the weird cat. “Present,” she then moves her hand to the image of the current scene, “and the future or at least possible futures out of sequence.” Finally, her hand hovers above the picture of Thor and the purple raisin.
Anthony: Lila is six and she knows that Clint is staying away because the bad guys want to hurt him and he doesn’t want her to get caught in the crossfire. Why couldn’t Howard sit down and have that conversation with me?

Jemma: I’m late.
“Except he’s not here, and neither is Deke,” May yelled back.
Me: I don’t know. Maybe. Things keep getting worse in the world and I think I would sleep better at night if I knew you were close by and able to save the world without worrying about getting arrested if you do.
Nomad: I prefer to cook myself, but I do miss those 5000 thread count sheets. What is virgin drunk raspberry cheesecake French toast?
“You know it is not called that anymore." After the Accords fallout, they renamed it the American fudge dream. But it would always be the Captain America to Tony.
Me: Your assistant has powers?
Oh God. I’ll talk to him the next time he contacts me. It’s his turn. Sometimes he really does act like a kid. I blame starting college at 14.
Cuddle bunny: Jesus. If something like that happened, why the fuck were we not call in?
This chapter takes place about three days after the last one.
Love: Mostly because he wishes they were not fake. So Anthony’s BFF knows?
Anthony love: Oh, apparently, they were in our timeline to figure out if they can gather all the stones throughout history to undo the fact that Thanos won in their timeline. So apparently in at least one timeline, Robin was right, and we may all be fucked.
Director Stark: Great, that means I'm going to have to deal with Hunter. I feel the headache forming.
Anthony: Be glad I stopped referring to her as the not-a-girlfriend although that’s mostly because I’ve met your real ex-girlfriend who can strangle me with her bare hands. I like her, sometimes.
I forgive you for what you said. I know you didn't mean it. You're just 15 and even though I was at MIT at 15, I said a lot of things to both my parents that I regret. I was an absolute nightmare to Maria. I even said a lot of things right before they died. I was pissed at my dad for making me come home for Christmas when they were just going to leave me there. They never came home and I regretted it ever since.
“There’s a difference between biting your tongue when your friend dates somebody that you don’t like that much than trusting that guy to keep you alive during a superhero battle. I don’t know they’re  for ready for the latter.
This Steve and Tony definitely got through those questions a lot faster than their other timeline counterparts. This seems like something easier to go through in person. This chapter showed how different this Tony and Steve are compared to the other timeline.  At the same time, there are similarities. We have 23 more questions to get through.
Me: Because if you didn’t come to this wedding, we would not have been able to have rounds 1 - 3 last night. I thought Friday said that there was a reception tomorrow too.
Subject: RE: Get Well Soon and I’m sorry for how I acted lately
Anthony love: I’m just happy we have Coulson back, mainly because he’s now my acting Deputy Director.
Nomad: Will your double be playing you in the movie?
“Thank you.”
“I definitely have a better relationship with Maria. I’m trying to model my parenting style more on how she treated me than what Howard did. You know, along with all my dad figures. Although I regret that she’ll never get to meet Morgan.” That was his number four regret.
Blue phone: Would it make you feel better to know I never saw your father that way?
Tony: Yes
Rogers: Are we actually celebrating that? I was under the impression that the Colonel wasn’t completely happy that Tony put his name forward. Which I feel bad about because I’m the one who actually suggested it.
Tony: Actually that would be General Talbot. No love lost there.
“She says it’s fine; just use condoms.” At Friday’s response, Tony deeply regretted switching her out of silent mode. “Also, she told me to tell Mr. May-Rogers that she packed lube, condoms, scarves, and the pleasure seeker 3000 in your toiletry bag for use this evening.”
To be continued.
“That’s also my biggest regret.” Because it’s obvious from the other timeline that they at least have a chance to defeat Thanos because those Avengers are still together.
Anthony love: This is what you expect from a group referred to as the Confederacy. Jokes on them since we know Thanos is planning to kill half of everybody, including them. He just needs the stones on our planet to do so.
Me: And no, I didn’t do anything inappropriate with the doll.
Me: Love you too, Cuddle Bear.
Red phone: All of them still want my tech, especially the one that showed up at the DOD yesterday. Although, if I die, everything just goes to Pepper and Rhodey and neither one of them is going to rollover.
“That we're getting married in another timeline." Steve supplied for him.
“Who died during the decimation along with my niece and grandniece.” Steve lamented.
Red phone: So Fury lied. What else is new? Everyone does it, even you.
Purple Arrow: I know. You stepped into my place, probably because of your own mountain of daddy issues. You’re doing homework with Cody and drawing with Lily. If I stay away much longer, Nikki will be calling you daddy.
I have no idea how to start this letter. I can’t even decide if I should actually start with Dear Bucky or cross that out and switch it to Dear James. Are you more one or the other? I’m not sure. I really didn’t have time to get to know who you are now before you decided to go back into cryo-freeze. This is attempt number 35 at writing to you according to my boyfriend’s AI. I’d guess maybe I’ll start there.
Counselor Laura: Friday watches that as well and he’s been good. Friday also monitors electronic correspondence and some of the things that you said in your text messages have triggered the contact me threshold.
Steve: You can't have your nanny come up here to bring us more cookies.
Anyway, love you.
DILF: Technically, the wedding doesn't happen until April 28.
Melinda: I don’t think everything can be blamed on you. We all made mistakes. I don’t think it’s healthy that you put everything on yourself. We're both a mess.
“That is a plus. Okay food then sleep and then good morning blow jobs?”
BITC: He told you?
Captain Tight Pants: She was one-of-a-kind and losing her for good hurt.  Then Bucky happened and I wasn't thinking rationally.
Jemma: Do you think I should go with Laura to her next AA meeting?
Tony: Then there’s Dr. Simmons and her boyfriend. You actually trust him to have access to one of your suits.
Chief mechanic: Yes, they couldn’t have elections in 2020. Things were still too messed up, or at least that’s what Ross argued. The president that they already had before was setting the groundwork anyway for an authoritarian regime.
“Sorry, my aunt texted, and I had to respond. Tony convinced her to relocate to the Malta compound for a while.”
Morgan’s dad: Robin is fine, by the way. She's mad that you left her with us. She also keeps drawing a picture of Scott coming out of the van as a baby. Is there something you need to tell me?
Purple Princess 2018: If he’s like my dad probably before. Apparently, there are windows where we can talk to you. This one's going to close in about 20 minutes, and then it will be three days your time before there's another one. Ana and Friday are doing the math. Friday will let you know when to be ready to speak to us.
HSBF: Well, considering you developed feelings for me while you were with her, I can understand that.
“However, I’m used to problems that have solutions and I don’t think there is an easy one for this.”
My work with Dr. Suarez, in contrast, is going a lot better. It’s okay for you to ask about that. However, it may take a few weeks for Suarez to get my medication levels right. Unfortunately, it looks like I’m going to have to be in the field now due to the current situation. Suarez isn’t happy about that. She actually suggested more than once that I leave Shield and take you up on your offer to come to SI. She thinks being in the field full time is too stressful for me. She may be right, but I can’t think about that right now.
“I guess that’s your ride,” Tony said sadly.
Blue phone: It felt like that when I lost my mom to consumption
BITC: Go. I know she’s worried. Give her the good news.
Anthony: And that was before the possibility of me waking up with you under said sheets. I can't wait for that to come to fruition in Johannesburg on the 24th.
He doesn’t even want to think about the specifics right now, but he knows Leo needs him because his counterpart is trapped and will die if they don’t rescue him. All of them really. They also have a crazy power-hungry villain to take care of. There is always one of those.
Cuddle Bunny: You have said multiple times that you wanted to be Secretary of Defense.
Boss: It looks like Skye-Quake-22 left out a couple of details. Let’s go speak with the agents.
Me: Also, Agent Scary completely beat my ass in no armor combat. I’m sending you video footage of that since you now know who Agent Scary is.
“Your excellent tongue cannot fix everything.” Tony said pulling away. “Baby cakes, I’m allowed to be a little freaked out because unlike last time, I’ve actually been diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD. Also I’ve managed to piss off the Secretary of State and a few other officials and various governments"
"Will the Air Force be showing up the moment Tony leaves?" Steve asked.
D Fitzsimmons: Thanos killed her during the battle.
Counselor Laura: As I mentioned earlier, Simmons has spent most of her time in the framework, probably because she doesn’t want to answer questions.
Blue phone: When did you talk to Laura?
I really hate my job. Especially because things are going on that I don’t know about. Half the people here are ridiculously incompetent. Jimmy is either an idiot and doesn’t realize half of what's going on, or he’s kind of in love with Scott and ignoring the obvious. I’m trying to decide if I ship it. Regardless, I’m probably going to be spending some quality time at Scott’s place.
Me: We already have Natasha but we could use more help. He can’t join Tony’s squad?
Me: You’re going to change things. Maybe you already have, because Baby Bird is drawing new stuff. At the very least, I don’t think Director Rhodes will make the same mistakes that the other guy did. Score another point for you.
Blue phone: I think I would like that especially if it was you. Maybe I’m a little confused about how you make me feel sometimes. Oh God, I can’t send that message to you. I’ll scare you off even more. So much for our promise to keep talking to one another. (Message not sent)
The Mechanic: So, Shield will be staying in the shadows?
Director Snookums: Just keep those conversations under heavy encryption, I beg you. You're like a brother to me. Because of that, I never want to read your sexual fantasies in a professional capacity.
DILF: I already asked you for help, and you said no. I don’t want you to think I only come to you when I need your help because I don’t want you to think that. I don’t want you to think I’m losing you.
TMNS: As of Friday night, he knows. That’s kind of why he’s on base.
Me: Actually, I think we’re going to have to come up with fake answers for everything. The next question is “do you think you know how you’re going to die” or something along those lines. I don’t think they could print a straight answer from either of us on that one.
Anthony: Sorry.
Tony: Obviously they came up with that question before people did wake up one morning with superpowers, usually after having their morning fish oil pill. Or some shrimp. Fish tacos are starting to be scary. That’s what happened to Yo-Yo.
“I will. I don’t want you dead either.”
“Yes, we are really bad at this.”
“I was there when you purchased the ring, or rather my prior self was. I believe this is what you would call being engaged to be engaged. I am aware and happy about it,” the teenager told the two. Her voice was different than Friday’s, but the way she spoke was similar.
Steve Rogers’s cell phone
Me: Probably shouldn't.
Snookums put me on hold to talk to General Talbot so I thought I would go ahead and send you Lily Bear’s artwork. Past this to birdbrain when you get a chance. I really wasn’t avoiding you. I just need to work with snookums on figuring out how to handle this without getting 15-year-olds involved.
Purple arrow: I just convinced Ana to show me the last footage from Quake’s suit before losing the signal, and I’m a bit concerned.
Red phone: Unrequited crushes are crushing.
Nomad: Do you wish it was different?
Me: Actually I feel like that was the case six months ago.
Director Snookums: Including forcing me to read your fake pornographic subterfuge text messages. Please stop writing those. There’s no point in you continuing to do that because everyone that matters knows who Cuddle Bunny is. You’re not fooling anyone.
The boss: He made the first step. He sent me the phone. And I did write messages to him. I just never sent any. I think I did in the other timeline or Friday overrode my orders, possibly because the time-traveling Fitz told her to do it for the good of humanity.
"Nice subject change, gumdrop. No. Seriously they should’ve seen this coming. We handed them out a press packet like days ago. See, now I wish I really did bring Coulson as my date to that dinner last month." Tony pouted.
Tony: I’m really trying to actually learn from my mistakes. I think my arrogance has gone down the whole 12% since the murder bot fiasco.
The Mechanic: The Talbot thing. Madeline Rice is like one of the few competent members of Ellis’ inner circles that turned out not to be Hydra.
Cuddle bunny: Exactly. They could be manipulating you. Lord knows you already have enough things to be guilty about. You don’t need anything else.
TMNS: That is something she would never do.
“I understand. Tony still called me Jarvis occasionally for the first six months. The name I chose means a daughter born on Friday. I thought it would be appropriate,” Afia replied.
Anthony: And I would’ve been happier there knowing that I was at smart kid school because my dad loved me and wanted to keep me safe. Not because he hated me and never wanted to see me again. I actually thought he hated me because I could never live up to the ghost of Captain America.
The Boy in the Chair: Did they get the rights to a Spider-Man movie?
This conversation takes place about six days after the last one. Tony was pissed.
WandaVision. Also, some information about post-snap life we discovered in Falcon and the Winter Soldier was used to make some of the creative decisions in this chapter.
The boss: I am aware. My other self ended up the director of Shield or rather the replacement agency.
December 19, 2016
“Nice to know Nick was cruel to everyone, even her. She was a mess wasn’t she?” Natasha asked.
"More legal than Steve and me in some countries." Tony remarked.
Tony Bear: Someday soon I need to tell you about trying to get KFC in Tokyo at 3 AM. You didn’t think about venturing out to try some of the local cuisine? Or, you know, at least go down to the restaurant. You did so well at breakfast.
“At least Stark is going to make an honest man out of you.” Steve just rolled his eyes before enveloping James in a hug.
Steve: Okay.
“I thought sex until 3 AM was normal for you,” Steve teased.
Me: So am I.
Once again, we are in the bad timeline. The difference in how time passes in each timeline is causing some problems in that regard. However, I do promise things will speed up soon after our next meet-up between the timelines.
Anthony love: Oh, that reminds me, I am also going to have to inform MJ that her cousin is MIA if we don’t get a message from her in the next 48 hours. We’re bringing her to the compound anyway.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last section. Really, all of you keep me in the happy zone. This is the final conversation from the last batch of fully proof read conversations. Don’t worry. I currently have seven conversations with my beta and two more that I need to be proofread before sending to someone who is not dyslexic to go over. However, we are on hold until I start getting chapters back.
The Big Boss: Because it would be easier for Stefan to come visit you in Malta especially since they’ve left the EU. I’ll see what I can do about Kevin. Although, that means I’ll lose an assistant.
MayMQ: I can't make that promise.
Chief Mechanic: Although I heard my platypus is Vice President. I’m so proud. I hope he's mitigating the damage.
Me: Dr. Suarez is more like a contractor or consultant. She was friends with your ex-girlfriend’s now deceased ex-husband, a.k.a. the former top Shield psychologist Dr. Andrew Garner. Dr. Suarez is currently filling in as a favor until they can get someone permanent.
Steve: I can understand how that can be difficult.
Red phone: That may have been why I started crying on their couch.
Me: I guess it's going to have to be because three months ago, I thought you would punch me on sight instead.
Red phone: In addition, I allegedly have unrequited crush issues
“Yes. Although if it’s necessary for you to do damage control, why are you waiting a couple of days?”
Purple Arrow: You took them out first?
“They ended up next-door neighbors in Wakanda, and they connected. They are actually engaged, but they’re waiting until after other us tied the knot. I will let you read Friday’s relationship breakdown on the way home tomorrow. Maybe after we take the kids to breakfast?” Tony asked.
"Yet you covered for him?" Steve didn’t quite get that yet.
Me: I didn’t think I would ever hear those words from you. I wasn't even sure that they were in your vocabulary.
PSS: Sometimes parents fight but it’s okay. I think your parents will do better once they’re in the same country.
Me: That’s not reassuring. You recently attended a charity dinner where somebody tried to kill you.
Nomad: You do realize that it is possible that the weapon that killed her family was designed by your father.
Me: For you that would be the fact that you kept trying even though I was being a complete asshole. I’m sorry that asshole is my defense setting.
Happy Bear: This is how you were able to work things out with your boyfriend?
Karen: Agent America and Slingshot are Avengers.
Tony: I was mostly joking. I think you could beat her better than I could. I almost destroyed the world by creating murder bots. It’s hard to come back from that. Also, I have a boyfriend. Which some people find more offensive than making the killer robots.
