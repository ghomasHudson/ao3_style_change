“Cas, can you hear me?” The eyes slit open, looking around a bit before finally resting on his face. “Cas, I have to go get help. Try not to move, okay?”
"If you consider politely talking to someone 'flirting' I wonder how you manage to navigate the world without being slapped on a regular basis. Unless you
"It looks like your standard animal attack. Isn't there a wildlife refuge near here?"
They're opposite the loading docks now, facing an empty lot where employees probably park, and beyond that another warehouse. Still, Dean pauses, staring out at the expanse of black asphalt and the ghost of white lines that delineate the spots. He crouches at the edge of the roof, reaching out with all his senses, but only one bears fruit.
"Could use an apprentice," he says.
that amulet. May I see it?”
"Fine, fine, clutch your pearls and tell me what actually happened."
Cas doesn’t speak for several minutes, and when he finally looks up at Dean his eyes are shining.
“I’m afraid no one is going to bid on a burned pie, either,” Mary says sadly.
“Advantage?”
"I don't, of course I don't, I'm sorry. I'm...projecting."
“Maybe.” Dean is impossibly close now, taking Cas by the lapels of his coat and holding him firmly in place as he gives him a searing kiss. “What do you say we go get out of here and go celebrate your new promotion?”
An image of Castiel springs unbidden to Dean's mind, standing against the stone wall, out of reach of a shaft of moonlight.
"This looks like a lot of work," Benny says late in the afternoon, after he'd returned to the office and looked over all of Dean's plans. "All the plans have merit, though, and I think it's the right call. We've got some time in the schedule at the end of next month that's not booked up yet..."
“But what do I do about…” He hears Storm shriek in the distance, and he closes his eyes for a moment, breathing deep.
It is late in the spring, and they are picking white peaches from the orchard when there’s a strange flash in the sky. Dean and Jesse look up in shock, but they hear Garth make a whooping sound from somewhere else in the orchard.
“Hated him?” Balthazar muses, drawing him out of his reverie. “Yes, well, that's the natural conclusion for a baby gay who doesn't understand their feelings.”
"The fact that you know they're Versace says more about you than it does about me," Sam says without even looking up, and Dean huffs but doesn't reply.
Dean stands indecisive for a moment, one hand on the doorknob and another clutching a large thermos, before he finally enters the room and closes the door behind him. Closes, but doesn't shut completely, as though he doesn't plan to stay.
“Who’s calling?”
"Never mind, I don't think I want to know. I still haven't gotten the second set of test results back."
"Okay."
"These gals give us wool to make all our clothing. That one is Muffins. She's probably the sweetest of the bunch, so you're always okay to pet her whenever you want."
“Dean?” he says. “Are you Prince Dean?”
“Twenty? Twenty
“You know that son of a bitch made me go to grief counseling with him?
“Maybe it was so disappointed with me that it went into hibernation. I remember feeling like that before, long ago.”
Cas turns in a slow circle in the middle of his new apartment, pondering the haphazardly stacked boxes all carefully labeled with block printed letters in thick, black marker. It’s not long before he makes a decision, slitting open the nearest one to pull out soft cotton sheets. He makes up the bed in the corner of the room, if only so he can take a nap when he’s finished, revel in the relief of being on his own at last. Seeing the neatly made bed energizes him, though, and he’s decided to deal with the kitchen stuff next when there are three loud raps on the door.
"Why have you always hated him so much?"
“You definitely have a far different type when it comes to guys, that’s for sure. Every girl you’ve ever dated has been super sweet, pretty, shy. Ketch was none of those things.”
"How long?" he manages to croak out, and his voice is as scratchy as his throat feels.
“Well, as Castiel has seen fit to abandon his kingdom I now have to do double duty."
“I don’t know. I don’t know what this is. I just feel...this longing. To be with him even when I’m not.”
“Might also help with your love life."
"What was it? Was it the lorelei?"
The brothers stay at the graveside for a long time after they've lowered the smallest casket of the three into the ground, a summer rainstorm soaking their clothes despite the large black umbrellas above their heads. Bobby waits at the house for the crowd of the bereaved, the muddy terrain more difficult for him to traverse than a bunch of grieving strangers he’s never met. Sam turns away before Dean, following the muddy path cut by the feet of a dozen other mourners undeterred by the rain; all of them friends of Kate's -- with the exception of Rufus, who'd stood apart but was there for them nonetheless.
be like when he and Sam used to share, but he doesn't tell Cas that. "If you're sure?"
"Dean. Are you alright?" His voice is raspier than normal, and his head is pounding. Had Dean been in the back seat with him?
"Yeah." Sam nods in agreement. "And it's never going to stop. He is never going to stop putting you first, putting your life before his. You keep telling him to knock it off and he never does! Don't you know why?"
"I couldn't see his coat anymore," Dean says in a soft voice. "It was the only thing that caught my eye as they struggled, and suddenly they were so far beneath the surface I couldn't make it out anymore. And I thought, 'I can't lose him like this again’, you know? ‘I can’t pick that trenchcoat up at the shore another time.’" He looks at Sam, who nods, and it fills Dean with such relief, knowing there are things Sam understands without him having to explain. "The Leviathan were an ancient, powerful force, too big for Cas to contain, but he slipped beneath the water and everything ended quietly. With a whisper, instead of a shout." He laughs awkwardly. "Then you have a monster clearly overcompensating for its insignificance with a big show, and all I could think was: this celestial being, once a soldier of god, that channeled the power of thousands of souls, is going to drown in a generic lake at the hands of a run of the mill bad guy like some common idiot. Because of
"I asked Dean to come over tonight to talk about something," he says, and Eileen's eyes flicker to Dean's face before moving back to Sam's hands. "Something important."
"Stop it, you're gonna make everybody think I'm straight!"
“But…”
"What?"
"Oh my god," she says, looking between the two of them. "Who took him?"
“There’s an inch of snow on the ground, Missouri, nothing is growing in your herb garden.”
Dean waits for some time, lolling against the back of the chair, using one foot to spin himself in slow circles. He amuses himself by imagining Gordon stopping every single girl in their class to ask if she'd come upstairs and kiss him, wondering if he's been slapped yet. He tries to remember who else is at the party that might come up here, and once again an inner part of him flinches at how many there are.
the case, thanks for doing it where I never have to see. You're the best of friends."
Dean shakes his head. "No, he's a king." He wanders over to the last stall, this one holding a chestnut Percheron. "Do you have apples I can give them?"
“I want to tell you about all those things; well, no, actually, I
thinking about a future together.”
"No problem. Just be as cold and surly as possible the whole time. Make him regret asking in the first place.”
"We're not going to drag girls up here against their will, Al, don't be stupid."
“So?”
“Pick you up for dinner at eight?”
became unhappy, and everything reflected my own melancholy. With his stewardship, it can be a fantastic place once more, beautiful and uncomplicated.” He laughs slightly. “I only wish I could see what my brethren will make of him, with his winsome vitriol. I expect they will be fascinated and frightened in equal measure.”
are sitting."
"And here I thought I’d improved so much during those years.”
"I called a cab to take your friend home," he says casually, not looking at Dick directly. He's been thinking about what he'd say when he appeared, but that was not an opening salvo he'd considered until he heard it leaving his mouth. Dick doesn't even have the grace to look ashamed. "I'll be happy to call a cab for you as well while you pack a bag."
“I didn’t even notice.” It slips out before he can wonder if it’s too soon, too honest, and Cas blinks at him several times before his frantic face suddenly softens into a shy smile, and Dean melts along with it. “I wish it hadn’t taken so long for us to finally get to know one another.” It’s only the softest edge of a confession, but it’s a start even so.
“When it came to you,
"I just want you."
you did. You looked at all those pieces and decided you understood me, and that I was still worth the
"Does it? A child was plucked from a certain slow death and given magical powers, and that's sad to you?"
"I don't." Everything in Dean's body language tells Castiel that this is a lie. His heart rate is elevated, his breathing ragged, and there's a noticeable bulge in his pants -- but the anger in his voice belies all of that. "I don't want any of this. I'm not here by choice."
Cas shakes his head. "I can't stop thinking about how stupid I was. It seems so obvious now that I’ve been unhappy for a long time, but I did nothing about it until I was forced to."
“We’ve got to get to the hospital. There was an accident.”
She laughs, turning her back on him to call Sam and bring him up on the video monitor while Dean puts a shirt on over the vest. Sam is worse than a mother hen, and he's had enough ribbing for today, ha ha.
"Two more minutes." He disappears again, returning with a fresh glass of soda for Castiel and one for himself, then ducks out one last time to grab his own plate. "I timed this so we could eat while we watch the second movie, because frankly it's the worst of the three."
That's not a life Dean will ever get to have. He wants Cas, and maybe Cas even wants him back, but what he deserves is something Dean can never give -- a life of long nights and uninterrupted touches.
“Bakers!”
“Was that what it was like for you?” he asks tentatively, not knowing how Bobby will feel about him broaching the subject.
"Shit," he says. "I, um, I can explain."
“I know where he is,” he breathes in a moment of certain understanding. “He’s in the oubliette.”
“Because I couldn’t stand the thought of retrieving you from her bed every year. You were quite angry with me the one time I did, as I recall. I saw the ring she was holding, I knew what it meant.”
“Right,” he says, taking a fortifying sip. “Sam’s thirteenth birthday.”
Dean shakes his head. "They weren't for farming, they were for jousting." He plants a kiss on Impala's nose, then moves down to the next stall. "What's this one called?" It's a spotted gray Percheron, not quite as large as Impala, but still a towering giant compared to the five-year old boy in front of it. Bobby shakes himself out of his stupor, coming to stand next to Dean.
Dean is still half asleep as they enter a small cottage, and Mildred stands him before the fire, helping him to pull off his shirt and get out of his hose.
Dean removes the ring and tucks it into the front pocket of his jeans, handing the empty box to Crowley, who turns it over in his hands with a soft smile as he rubs the velvet.
"The goblin king," he narrates with his movements, and Dean closes his eyes in resignation when Eileen gasps aloud.
"What am I doing?" he mutters to the little clay bear in his fist. It looks up at him without judgement or reservation, and he considers tossing it into the trash. It's highly unlikely that it will ever be used for its intended purpose, chilling out in a tightly sealed container of muscovado on a dark shelf, keeping it fresh and ready for a future baking day. This little piece of clay is destined to be out of work forever, unless something tragic happens that forces him to live with Gabe again, and Cas is pretty certain there isn't a kitchen utensil in existence that his brother doesn't already own. Not only that, but he's pretty sure he would rather become a wandering nomad than be forced to cohabit with his brother's atrocious taste in music ever again. No one should listen to that much Creed.
“Ah,”  Castiel says, pulling his hand back to his chest. “I’m afraid not. Magic is something that you’re born with. Like freckles.”
“Of course, Majesty.”
“Desperate to move out or desperate to get laid?”
“Bitch.”
"Huh," he says, bending to touch his toes, then carefully turning himself right to left, doing a few practice moves. "This is way more breathable than I thought it would be. How protective is it though? It doesn't seem very durable."
“No, nothing like that, but I wouldn’t be surprised if some of my so-called friends did. They talked shit about him all the time, and I never stopped them.” Years on he’ll still cringe when he idly remembers the colorful language used by Gordon or Alastair, just leaning against their lockers and watching Cas pass by, oblivious to their whispered taunts. “Sometimes I even went along, laughing at their ugly comments, because I didn’t want them directed at me, you know?”
"Ow," Dean says, managing to wake up without jolting the baby. "What gives, man?"
“Choice,” Castiel whispers. “Whatever
"And say what?"
“My wife, Karen. We got married young, right out of high school, like a lot of folks in those days. For twenty-two years she was my constant: she was there when I slept and when I woke, she took care of what I wore and what I ate. It got to be that I couldn’t remember what life was like without her, and then she was just gone. Car accident. Drunk driver.”
"Right." Dean’s mind is suddenly filled with the image of this stranger baking shirtless in the middle of the gym, and he’s now terribly conscious of the fact that he’s wearing a brightly colored Christmas sweater with Santa nibbling a cookie on the front of it. “I’ll just, uh.” He reaches for the pen but instead sends it flying off the table and dropping to the floor, where both he and the new arrival stare at it for a moment. The man gives him an indulgent smile before squatting down to retrieve it, then stands up so sinuously that Dean feels all the blood in his body rush to several specific places.
"You can break the enchantment completely. You can free
It's surprising how much there is for Dean to go through, considering that his Dad hasn't done much for years except drink his disability payment and live like a hermit at the base of the lighthouse that his great-great grandfather built, doing his level best to destroy any legacy the Winchester name once had. Somehow, John had still managed to keep his life insurance paid up, draft a will, and make his own funeral arrangements -- though a lonely cremation without any kind of service or fanfare hardly counts as a funeral. Even if that hadn't been arranged beforehand, Dean's not sure what he could have done differently. His dad didn't have any friends left. He couldn't think of a single person to call with the news other than Sam, who was hours away and in the middle of an important case. Which is what he cites as the reason to end the call.
Dean thinks. "Neither seems like your type."
So he’d resisted, and congratulated himself on his presence of mind, resenting Castiel all the while for the deal they’d made. But that resentment has faded and left something else in its place, something keen with hunger. He’ll be in the shop, thoughts drifting as he works, and find himself thinking again and again of those thighs, those eyes and the heat in them, unlike anything he’s ever felt: not with Aaron and his patient guidance, not with Carmen’s perfect body under his hands, not with Ketch’s cocksure roughness.
"Dean." Sam's left arm flails out, and he bats it away. "You're all alone. Me no likey."
“You wear it well,” Dean says, pulling his arm back but not away, still close enough that Cas can feel the warmth of his breath, arm laying casually against his own now. There’s a few more pages of pictures but they end before the album does, something he’d forgotten. “Why isn’t it finished?”
Cas nods sagely. "Noted."
"My self isn't very compelling," Cas says with a hint of regret, and he twists his fingers together in his lap. "Not like you are. People want to talk to you, they want to tell you things."
He’d never imagined, as he walked out of the store years ago with a bag full of dress shirts and ties and a ticket to pick up his altered suits later, that eventually they’d just be sitting in his closet while he worked from home in a pair of fuzzy socks and a worn out set of cat pajamas. Now the only concession he makes to business attire is during the afternoon conference call every Thursday when he changes into a dress shirt and tie for twenty minutes, then hangs them back up to wear again the next week. In six months not a single person has noticed that it's the exact same shirt and tie, even though the collar has lost its starched look from being taken on and off the hanger so many times, and the tie never changes. Clearly everyone else on the call each week is far too interested in how their own image presents in the bottom corner of the screen to take any notice of his. Zach Adler attends every call in a full three piece suit, clearly visible the three or four times he has to get up from his desk, since he never seems to be fully prepared. Cas is almost positive he even has dress shoes on, if the clicking on the hardwood floor as he wanders around his home office looking for whatever report he's nattering on about is any indication. Cas smiles into his coffee mug every time he glances down at his own pajama bottoms, well out of frame below his untucked dress shirt, while wearing one of the numerous pairs of novelty slippers that Gabe gives him for Christmas every year as a joke.
"I am simply...curious."
"I can do that," Cas says, waiting for Dean to give him a nod before rattling off the numbers. Not long after he's done he hears his phone go off inside with a text alert, and Dean looks up to wink at him.
He tells Castiel more stories of their travels, of weird monuments he and Sam have been to, of the predictable behavior of certain kinds of people, and it's not without regret that Castiel finally returns him home. Dean collapses onto his bed fully dressed, already asleep as dawn breaks over the horizon.
“I’m bi, Sam, thank you very much. Did you really think Ketch and I were just friends?”
He puts the picture face down on the bureau and hastily returns to the kitchen. It's fully dark outside now, and he's been here most of the day. He should probably head home and get back to work tomorrow, but he finds himself moving to the spiral staircase as if compelled, muscle memory moving him upward despite the creeping dark on the higher floors, barely beaten back by the weak light from the kitchen below filtering up through the opening. Out of long forgotten habit he finds himself counting the steps in his head as he goes, thinking that his knees are a lot older now than the days when he could run up all one-hundred and ninety-nine with ease. It takes him longer to reach the top than he'd like to admit, and he's breathing hard when he climbs the ladder in the service room, pushing back the hatch at the top and stepping onto the gallery.
Cas responds with another pleased hum before leaning up to press a soft kiss to Dean’s lips, lingering briefly, mouths parting with a soft sound. Cas lays his head back down on Dean’s chest, ear pressed against his heart, looking up at him.
"It is a well earned moniker, believe me.” Cas hesitates a moment, staring at the wisps of frail steam leaving his drink as though he’s trying to decipher a hidden message. Whatever he sees there makes him nod to himself, as though accepting whatever truth he divined there. “It only took five years and coming home to a stranger in my shower in the middle of the night for me to accept it."
"Sorry, sorry." He puts his hands up in a placating gesture. "It seemed like we needed some levity."
"That's the castle beyond the goblin city, don't you remember, Dean?" Sam says breathlessly, tugging on his brother's sleeve, forgetting the trouble they're in with his excitement. "If we can make it through the labyrinth, we can get Adam back! That's what it said in the book."
"You're just using food to appease me."
“Because it’s
Dean gasps as he curves his fingers around Castiel’s neck, leaning in to press their lips together softly. Castiel doesn’t move at first, and then he seems to melt along with his resolve, pressing himself into Dean as he returns the kiss.
Dean just rolls his eyes and rips open a packet of soy sauce with his teeth.
"Readily, and eagerly, if memory serves."
These are the thoughts occupying his mind as he lets himself into the small apartment he calls home, leaving him unprepared for his visitor.
Castiel is a mass of sensation below the waist, every nerve ending at attention, and Dean doesn't relent until he's three fingers deep and Castiel is helplessly thrusting into his mouth and then down against his fingers, hands twisting in the sheets and skin damp with a sheen of sweat. He has left begging far behind, chanting a litany of "Dean, please, Dean, please, Dean,
"I know how long ago it was!" His voice is sharper than he intends.
"It wouldn't be as much fun without you guys, though. Ash makes some cool toys."
Dean holds his breath as he puts the car in reverse, turning to look out the back window as he pulls out of the space, but Cas is staring at his hands and doesn't even glance up. The air feels tense on the drive to the first farm, but Sam doesn't seem to notice as he directs Dean into the lane where he and Jack are going to do their stakeout. It gets impossibly thicker when they get out of the car and move around to the trunk, especially when Cas makes no move to get into the now empty passenger seat.
“Of course I do.” Dean wonders if Castiel stays out of the light because it will reveal  what he truly is, the magic trick he showed a little boy long ago nothing more than his own, sad reality. Dean is happy for him to stay away in that case, because he needs Cas to be real, to be there for him in the way no one else is.
Dean hums low in his throat. "I sincerely promise."
Sam looks at him levelly. "When I came to your room this morning, Cas answered the door in your clothes. He was very quick to tell me that you'd only loaned them so he'd be more comfortable, and that he'd simply watched TV all night. Almost like he was afraid I'd get the wrong impression."
…” He trails off, picturing the way Castiel’s face looks in the low light from the banked coals of the fire, sitting just a couple feet away these days with his chin perched on his fist.
The dragon stretches its wings as Amara leans into its neck, turning to launch itself from the from room as it has for centuries. Only this time, it won’t return.
but..." He sighs, hanging his head. "I fantasize about you all the time, but it's not always sexual, you know?"
The body in his arms shifts, head turning to press a kiss into his pectoral, then peering up at him with lidded eyes.
“Your payment wasn’t as generous fourteen years ago.”
“About six, I think. Pretty sure this is for Easter Sunday, just before church.” His younger self is wearing slacks and a white button down shirt with bright blue suspenders and a tie to match, looking rather pleased with himself as he preens for the camera.
Dean gives him a good-natured slap on the back, and Crowley rolls his eyes. "You're a terrible cook, but you've got an incredible palate, I'd be a fool not to put it to good use."
"Who the hell are you?"
“Now where did you get that idea?” John says, ruffling his hair and making him giggle.
“Dean, I don’t…” Whatever argument he’s going to make is forgotten as Dean leans forward to kiss him.
you. It's not that you're not handsome, or fun, or anything. It's just that you're not for me." She looks over her shoulder, lifting a hand when Donna waves in their direction. "Now
"My...it's bedpost, Cas, another notch in the
"I'm sorry, it's just," he twines his own fingers together, clenches his hands together in his lap. "I've seen you act on impulse before, and I can't..." He's got the door open and is out of the car before Dean can reach out to stop him. Cas is twenty feet away before Dean is even out of the car but he doesn't go much farther, and by the time Dean catches up he's just standing with his arms crossed and staring at his feet.
"What are you doing?" Garth whispers. "He's not on the list, I never got his entry fee or registration..."
"You're right, I don't understand. Why can’t we talk about what happened?"
"No, that's my name. I figured I should introduce myself before we fight about why Data rules."
"Yeah, I know. We can start with mutual apologies before we talk, but we should probably focus on getting out of here first."
Castiel long ago ceased to have any real concept of time, but now he marks it regularly, counting down until he can see Dean again. He tries to stop conjuring crystals to slake his curiosity, but it makes time interminably slow. He does so one day out of boredom, slung over his throne with nothing to do but slap his decorative riding crop against his boot heel, no goblins around to amuse him. He looks around furtively before he does so, knowing that Crowley is easily bought and Balthazar is just nosy, and honestly a king should be able to act however he pleases in his own realm, so he pulls a crystal out of the air.
“How the hell can you look at that stuff for so long? It’s like looking at the code of the Matrix.”
"The werewolf trope is prevalent in many different fandoms, I'll have you know."
"Relax?" He can't keep the disappointment out of the word, and it's obvious that Dean picked up on it when he turns to Castiel inside the bedroom and cups his cheeks.
“New York. The Gray Lady, if you can believe it. Bottom of the ladder, but better pay than I get now with the opportunity to move up.”
“How do you know?”
makes him tingle a bit.
?" he murmurs.
“Dean,” Cas says in a strangled voice. “It was so,
He opens his mouth, prepared to spill everything, when a door behind them opens. He's been so focused on talking to Cas that he stopped paying attention to the sound of others in the building, and as a result he didn't notice anyone coming. Dean curses himself for once again letting his guard down, knowing that Bobby is going to give him a repeat performance of being hit with a metal chair until he finally learns this lesson.
"Would you rather believe he did, but brought strange men home behind your back anyway?"
“You a Vonnegut fan, Cas?”
“What makes you say that?”
Castiel briefly entertains several fantasies, all of which involve causing other humans pain. "What reason did she give for this separation?" he finally asks, curious how anyone could choose to not spend time with Dean on purpose.
"Huh." Dean watches the scene before them unfold, trying to see it through the angel's eyes. "You're right. I never looked at it that way before." He imagines there are many things he hasn't bothered to look at from Cas's perspective, and he wants to do better with that. He wants to be better than that.
dumb. Team Alice.”
Dean sighs, glancing over his shoulder at Charlie who is doing a terrible job pretending not to listen to this whole conversation.
“Take a few minutes,” Dick croons, the picture of generosity, and Cas considers whether or not the pen in his hand has sufficient weight to pierce a skull when forcefully thrown. He decides it doesn’t. “I’ll meet you by the elevators at six, sharp.” Dick passes Meg on his way out, not even giving her a passing glance as she shoots daggers into his back with her eyes.
Twelve hours later their positions are reversed as Dean sits in a room in the bunker, fretting over the way Cas is twitching in his sleep, his skin clammy and his breathing uneven. He asks Sam to grab some dry clothes from his room, and by the time his brother returns he has Cas stripped of his wet things and dried off. He dresses Cas in his own sleep pants and favorite sweatshirt, rubbing at his wet hair with a towel before he maneuvers him under the blankets. Jack returns from the mission Sam had given him, arms piled high with blankets, and Sam gives Dean such a look as he wraps Cas tightly in all of them.
"She moved here a few years before I came back, and started helping almost right away with automated mailing lists and spreadsheets. Honestly, I'd have been lost without her, without both of them. They basically built the vehicle, I'm just driving it now."
“Would you still be my brother?”
He sighs. "How did you know?"
“No bet,” Charlie says, putting another beer down in front of him. “The dopey, soft smile is a dead giveaway every time.”
“Not much. Two blocks up is that old mattress factory, still abandoned, and on the other side is some kind of warehouse that’s been under construction the last couple of months. Not sure what they do there, exactly, but it probably doesn’t depend on location, location, location, practically nobody goes into that part of town.”
“I don’t care. You’re all I think about.” He doesn’t mean to say it, but now that he has he can’t stop. “You’re always in my thoughts, from the moment I wake, and each night when I close my eyes you’re with me still.”
Cas turns to him with a glare. "Can you not trivialize what's happening into song lyrics right now?"
“What’s Samuel mean?” Mary’s shoulders tense a little, but her husband notices even from across the room.
"You referred to my new equipment as a 'gentle man shell' yesterday."
"Right," Dean says softly. "I realize that's not why you come here."
Ten feet from the source of the flames the storage racks come to an end, and sure enough there's nothing in this corner of the warehouse but an oil drum that's burning merrily, without any sign of the person who set it. Darkwing is already standing there, warming his hands over the fire, and when he glances up Dean gives him a sardonic look before turning to grab a nearby fire extinguisher from the wall.
“Of course I do! Tonight was the beginning of the harvest festival, and we had the naming ceremony for Sam, and then I ate blackberry tarts and pear turnovers before I went to bed, and then…then there was a lady. She said she came from a magic place, and then I was here. Only, I don’t know where
Dean does reach out this time, laying his hand on Cas's thigh, feeling the muscles tense up as though he doesn't want to be touched. Dean pulls back as if burned, rolling off the bed and standing to lean his hands on the small table, staring out the window into the parking lot. Behind him, Cas says nothing.
Cas sighs, then looks at Sam. "Dean's right. Maybe you could talk to some more locals tomorrow while he and I investigate this...lead."
“Most people assume you have an imaginary friend, but I think you’re getting a touch too old for that to be plausible.” She finally stops sewing, placing her hands in her lap and looking at him directly. “It’s said that the castle has a guardian, so that none will disturb the dragon as it slumbers in its cave deep within the mountain    .”
"That," Charlie says as she deftly makes a cocktail. "Why do you keep staring after that guy you were talking to?"
"I'm Dean," he says, then shakes his head. "But you know that already, don't you?" He finds himself edging closer, within an arm's length, but he puts his hands in his pockets. "How do you know my name, Castiel?" He's never heard a name like that before, and it trips off his tongue like champagne, effervescent and intoxicating.
Dean suspects there’s a story there, too, but Cas speaks again before he can ask. "I'm sorry about your friend."
He mentally berates himself the entire time it takes for him to run to the source of the smoke, a warehouse in the industrial park just as he'd guessed. He takes a running leap onto the cab of a truck, hoisting himself up to the top of the trailer, which is conveniently backed up to a loading dock, then traversing the length of it to gain access to the roof of the warehouse with one last jump.
Ellen shakes her head. "I can’t answer that, I’m afraid. You’ll find that’s true for everyone here. We don’t know where we come from. Truth be told, we’re all amazed that you do." She looks away, out into the now empty sky beyond the window. "There's an ache, sometimes, in my heart, an ache that nothing seems to fill. I wonder sometimes if it’s my family, missing me." She looks back at him and smiles sadly, wiping at her eyes. "It helps, having something to do and people to take care of. I don't want you to be sad. We're actually all quite happy here, and you will be, too, in time."
“Why now?” Balthazar asks him as they gaze at the labyrinth in the distance. “Why after all this time?”
"What about your family?"
thing on his mind now. He knows there are Things They Need to Talk About. But that doesn't change the fact that finding the words, or the right time and place, remains as impossible as it's ever been. Dean was waiting for Cas to get over the touch of pneumonia, now he's waiting for Cas to be his old self again, and all the time he's waiting he's waking up every few hours to creep to his door and listen for movement on the other side to reassure himself that Cas is still there.
"Probably that he wanted to fuck your stupid brains out," comes a shrieking voice through the earpiece, and the two of them break apart. Dean hadn't even realized how close they'd moved to each other, and he’d completely forgotten about the comm in his hand. "Daredemon, you better tell me what's happening this goddamn second or I am bringing the big guns down on your location."
"No," Dean says firmly, pulling away to look at him, stroking his collarbone. "It wouldn't feel right to me, to be with you like that, and watch you leave for the night. Not with you."
, he thinks, realizing he's already decided that Castiel is going to stay for a while and trying not to think about what it means. Castiel stares at his plate for a moment, then looks at Dean with a confused expression before hesitantly lifting a forkful of omelet into his mouth. His face quickly morphs from apprehension to utter delight.
"Yeah." Dean shrugs dismissively. "It's not like I was really trying to pursue anything with most of them, knowing how we lived. Even in high school there was only the occasional hookup. Charlie's the only girl I have a successful relationship with and we're just friends."
"Come on Cas, I get it, okay? I'm giving you the only thing the church can't."
“Yeah, I guess.” It’s not entirely the reason, but he doesn’t want to tell Charlie about that. It’s something he’s never shared with anyone, something far too intimate to explain. “God, sometimes I had to work so hard to pretend he wasn't in the room, but at the same time I just...I wanted him to
"When I bought a goddamn BMW, obviously, are you picking me up or not?"
"Sam! First do no harm!"
“Hey now, behave,” Dean says, pointing at him, and he shrugs.
Dean sighs.
"It’s been over a decade, I'm sure he's intelligent enough to realize you're probably not the same guy."
"Yeah, well. Back then I barely knew him at all, and...I never tried to either. There were hundreds of kids in our school, so I didn’t even notice him until sophomore year, and once I had I couldn’t stop. It was like he was everywhere. I used to think it was his eyes, that I’d only noticed him because they were so blue.”
"I can't believe this is my life," Sam mutters to himself on screen. "Okay. Fine. There haven't been any incidents for weeks, but that probably means one is due soon."
"Afternoon, ma'am. I'm Agent Hatfield, this is Agent Medley." Cas nods solemnly, and the woman glances at him with a soft smile. "We're investigating some reports of wild animal attacks in the area?"
“What about him?”
"What?" I'm..." Is this man actually flustered? Dean starts circling him slowly. Maybe he can get him to face the light enough to see if he's blushing. "You can call me Darkwing."
“You weren’t ready, you were intimidated, you didn’t even really like the guy at first and only hung out with him out of a sense of obligation, whatever noble bullshit that is. You got to know him better, and now you not only see past all the things that used to rub you the wrong way, you actually like the guy.  It doesn’t mean you can change how you felt in the past because those things were all valid, and you can’t beat yourself up for feeling them, even if you’re missing out on your crush now.”
He leads Cas up the row, and the first station they come to has a well-dressed, elegant older woman. She gives them a saucy wink that makes Dean blush a little even though he should be used to her by now.
Dean gasps aloud when they arrive under a sky filled with pulsating light, like a multi-colored aurora borealis, collapsing onto the grass to lean back on his elbows. Castiel watches the play of light over his features, purple and yellow and green, before stretching out on the grass beside him.
He tumbles to the ground, curling his fingers gratefully in the  dirt, clouds of it blowing away under his lips as he breathes hard. He can feel the tremor of the earth below his hands as Storm moves close to him, can hear the sound of its snuffling breath as he sits up, looking in the direction of the great emptiness he found himself in. It looks just like more trees, but now that he knows to look he can see the faintest shimmer in the air, the way the sky sometimes looks in the distance on a hot summer day.
Cas looks down at his hands, clasped together in his lap.
"Well, why would it stay in this place if it had a choice?"
"So your old crush is definitely old news, then?"
"Yeah, I know." John presses away from the table, patting Dean on the shoulder as he walks out of the kitchen.
as the wind is knocked out of him, blinking up at Dean in confusion as the rest of the group goes completely still. He stares them down, making eye contact with each one, and realizes that there are actually six more still standing. Well then. Lucky seven.
She grabs the towel again to snap it at him, and he grins as he heads to the den, standing in the doorway for a few moments to watch John Winchester in his recliner, his youngest son perched on his knees.
"You think all the bad guys are starting to avoid doing crime within a hundred mile radius because they fear me?" He stops pacing behind Charlie, arms crossed and face pensive before he nods to himself with a grin. "Actually, yeah, that makes sense. Pissing their pants at the idea that Daredemon is coming for them."
“I just assumed he was born to it.”
stamped on the front in gold leaf. Cas pulls it out, flipping back the cover with a smile.
"You can't."
When he returns to John and Kate’s neighborhood he parks at the end of the block, staring at the line of cars along the street, then glances at the jacket pooled on the passenger seat. It had been John’s, long ago, and Dean had rescued it from the back of the hall closet when he’d moved out after graduation; it’s been in the back seat since he broke up with Cassie. He opens the velvet box, trying to remember what he was feeling when he bought it.
Cas tries to ignore the way his heart starts to gallop in his chest, like wild horses thundering across the prairie, unfettered and free.
"Are you always by yourself? Aren’t you lonely?"
"Way ahead of you, I just brewed a fresh pot, and there's still some donuts left in the kitchen. You're lucky Benny's out on site or they'd all be gone."
“I know,” he says huskily. “That’s why.”
"Just a couple of idiots pulling doing a good old fashioned B&E at the rec center of all places."
“How did it happen? Why did you leave Concordia?”
“But where, Dean? Will you give up your humanity to stay here, with me?”
“Well, she’s distracted now, so we may not need backup. Speaking of backup, where’s yours?”
"That's smart. Would you like some hot cocoa, Samandriel, even if it's instant?"
"Here we have some other first timers," he says instead, as they near two stations where a couple of teenagers have set up side by side. "These are seniors from the school's home ec class. Every year the students in those classes vote for the two of them to compete."
“No, I mean: why do you think you were a jerk?”
Satisfied, he checks on Cas’s position before making his way down to street level as quietly as possible, blending into the shadow of the night streets as he follows him for another block. Cas finally comes to a stop on the corner past the old factory, his gaze on the new construction on the next block before he turns his head side to side, as if trying to figure out where he is. Dean comes to a halt, wondering if he should approach, pretend that he just happened to be in this completely deserted section of town. His palms are sweating and he realizes he still has the fingerless gloves on, so he yanks them off, shoving them into an outside pocket of his cargo pants before he runs his hands through his hair.
"Well, I'm at a disadvantage, since you know my name, and there's nothing to indicate what yours is." He blatantly looks the man up and down now. He's fit without being overly muscled, the way you get when you have a job that keeps you physically active and you don't need to go to the gym. On second glance, the way the polo shirt stretches across his chest and shoulders is also quite admirable.
He catches the glint of something silver in the new arrivals hands.
“What happens now?” Dean asks, curling closer, letting his hand roam lower, thumb rubbing a warm circle into Castiel’s hip.
Dean's favorite class turns out to be one that he and Charlie don't share, though all the classes they have together are made better by her company. For seventh period they part ways in the south stairwell, Charlie going one flight up for computer science while Dean heads down to the basement for wood shop.
“Well, he dropped a couple of cars on it out in the salvage yard and it held up pretty well, but I don’t exactly know if it’s unbreakable.”
"I...Dean, I'm sorry. Let me get those for you." He starts to move towards to scattered clothing, but Dean puts a hand on his chest.
"You don't remember?" He spares a glance over his shoulder, enough to see that Castiel is watching him with a thoughtful expression. He prods at the edges of the omelet. "I found you passed out in a smoking crater, bare ass naked and dead to the world. When I touched you, you woke up just long enough to grab me and say my name before you passed out again. Think you bruised my shoulder." He chuckles at that last part, because it actually is a little sore today. He won't be surprised to find it shading purple when he goes to take a shower. "What do you remember before waking up in that other room this morning?"
"Really, Meg, you should dream bigger."
"A few," he says, grinning, and she rolls her eyes. "I didn't stop thinking about him for a long, long time though. He was my big bi revelation, and he probably never gave me another thought after school was done. In fact, he’s probably sitting at his table remembering exactly what an ass I used to be."
"Wow. That was cold-blooded, amigo."
"Calm down, son." Sam sits back, surprised and immediately chagrined, because Bobby still has that effect on both of them no matter how old they are now. "You're both right, but only one of you is thinking clinically, and I'm sorry to say it's not you for once, Sam."
“Jesus Christ, Sam. It’s not about that. They’re our family.”
“You must come here a lot.”
"Would you like a drink?" Eileen interjects. "You've come all this way, it's the least we can do." Sam shoots her a look, and she glares at him in a way that says
"Why don't the two of you get out of here? I’ll be fine by myself, it’s starting to taper off.” She elbows him playfully. "Seems like he could use some alone time with a sympathetic ear."
“Well, there are no roads to it, but I can send you there in the blink of an eye,” she says in a conspiratorial whisper.
He drags his hands up his face through his own hair, scrubbing the scalp with his fingertips with a sigh. Maybe he should call Sam.
"I, um." Cas seems nervous now, glancing back over his shoulder. "Don't take this the wrong way, but why would you care?"
“Are you moving home after graduation?”
Darkwing had turned and put out one hand as if to hold him back, but Dean refused to hear the plea on his lips as he turned and ran. He'd spent another hour taking a circuitous route back to the neighborhood, moving under cover whenever it was possible. He couldn't feel Darkwing's gaze on him as he ran but he didn't trust himself to be sure, not now. He wasted another thirty minutes hiding in the underground parking garage next to Bobby's place until he was sure he wasn’t being followed, then took the seldom used alternate entrance, hidden behind an access panel in a dark corner of the lowest level and obscured by a cement pillar. As soon as he'd gotten into the Cave and confirmed he was secure, he'd called Charlie.
Sam glares at him as he gets up, but grabs the money. “Thanks for lunch, Charlie,” he calls out, and Dean gives him the finger again as he leaves, which Sam returns without looking as he walks away.
“Well, avoiding him both at work and at home has been exhausting."
"Want? There's nothing I want, boy," and at that Dean stands straight, rolling his shoulders back to glare at the so-called goblin king who stands a few inches above him, but only because he's wearing heeled boots. "I merely came to get that which was given to me."
“It’s foldable food, we’ll manage.” Dean winks at him as he pulls out a slice, and Cas laughs a little as he follows suit. “I hope it’s okay that I’m here. I know you hired movers to bring everything over but I could help you unpack? That’s always the worst part.”
It's marginally cooler in the dark interior, dark wooden blinds drawn against the sun in every room. Dean gratefully accepts a glass of liquid sunshine, the ice clinking against the sides as he takes a seat at the worn wooden table off to one side. Cas accepts a glass as well, and Dean raises an eyebrow.
"Uh-huh." He watches as Cas turns into an alleyway between two bars, and without thinking he starts following him, taking a parallel path along the rooftops. "Besides, I think Darkwing up and left town."
“So what changed?” Crowley shrugs again, and Dean clenches his jaw in frustration. “He came back here, then what?”
It would be unseemly to turn tail and run, so instead Dean pivots and walks back to the other end of the gym at a brisk pace with the air of someone who is very busy and important, ignoring Mildred’s high pitched laughter.
“That’s because the law is philosophical. Microbiology and business administration aren’t going to do much for matters of the heart.”
"I did not
"What happened?"
There’d been a moment when the conversation steered too close to the secret Dean’s keeping, and he thought he might just let it all spill out; and he might have if not for Charlie’s voice in his head.
“Well, I’m certainly not letting you babysit, unless I want to be chasing another baby through the goblin realm.”
The voice calling his name is familiar, as is the guttural roar that comes after it, but he's too tired to place them right now. So tired. He can taste blood on his lips and wonders idly if it's his before he passes out.
"I get that. Why else would he keep that hair?"
“You know I’d be willing to listen if you ever wanted to talk about it. We’ve been together for almost two years, Dean.”
Sam laughs, shaking his head, rubbing his face with his hands before giving Dean a serious look. “I don’t know if running away from your problems is a coping mechanism.”
"You dirty voyeur," says a voice from beside his ear. "Can you make this bigger?"
"Do you remember how you ended up on the beach last night?" he asks, aiming for disaffected nonchalance.
“He originally wanted something way longer and even more ridiculous, but I can’t remember what it was…”
"For what?"
"I can always go back to doing that. Standing in the hall outside your office, giving menacing looks to everyone who passes by..."
It's Sam's own fault, really, that his laptop gets sprayed with liquid, but that doesn't stop him from giving Dean a death glare and leaving him to choke on his coffee.
"Eileen," Sam starts, looking at him sheepishly, and Dean leans his head back as he rolls his eyes. "She keeps asking when you’re going to come over for dinner. I told her you're not the social type."
"You're still sleeping a lot, Cas. Your grace isn't being replenished very quickly. Or at all, maybe." Dean reaches over, slowly, hesitantly, and strokes the stubbled line of his jaw. "Did you fall, Cas?"
"Nerd."
"Don't move," Dean says, getting off the couch as the credits start to roll and heading out of the room. Castiel smiles to himself as he listens to the soundtrack from the kitchen: the hum of dinner being pulled from the oven, the swish and soft bang of cupboards being opened and closed again, the tinny notes of silverware being pulled from a drawer. He closes his eyes, wishing that this could be his life every day.
, and pulls out a single grenade, tossing it casually from hand to hand. "They all want to be the biggest and the baddest, and they'll pay any price to achieve it, even for such a small thing."
“Because I’m
"I see someone I know, that's all."
"I can tell from your silence that I’m right, and since I know you didn’t drive in this morning I’ll be happy to give you a lift to the venue.”
"And you're lucky you got into construction, so maybe we should both stick to what we're good at."
"Wait," he says, and his eyes light up with interest. Dean glances at the television, then back at Cas, then back to the television.
"I hope I don't end up with a giant moose who drools all over me when he lets his guilty conscience pick up the bar tab."
“I always do, with you.” Their eyes meet, and Dean feels a continental shift inside him, drawing him closer, and he’s just about resolved to kissing him right here in the middle of the bar when Cas abruptly pulls away. “I’m glad we’ve gotten a chance to be friends after all this time.”
"Time, yes. Narrow, no. The best we could do is somewhere between ten p.m. and five in the morning."
“You are an exceptionally smart woman.”
Dean loses sight of Cas as the last of the contestants check in, but Charlie gives him a knowing look as she double checks the list of vendors.
he thinks, scrolling through what he realizes now is a frighteningly large list.
"What, no hug?" Crowley says with mock disdain, hands lifted at his sides.
Hand to hand combat is usually easy for someone able to subdue up to three opponents at once, so this kind of melee is a nice change of pace, a welcome chance for him to shake off the cobwebs and showboat a little bit. The level of difficulty is only increased because he knows he needs to disarm and subdue all these men without doing them permanent harm. They’re just a bunch of idiots on a bender, likely nine to fivers chafing at the yoke of the working man's life. Dean wears a pair of matching pistols in a holster at his lower back, but he won’t be using them tonight.
Crowley looks up at him, face perplexed. “Only he knows for sure. All he said was that he wanted you to be free to choose, and it seemed you’d made your choice. Do you know what he meant?”
Cas starts to giggle, and Bal follows suit even as he makes shushing sounds.
A large, dark animal is in the expanse of blue above them, low enough that Dean can make out the scaly texture of its skin and the sharp talons of its feet. It seems to be black of body, from its nose to the tip of its barbed tail, but the ridged scales on the underside of its long neck and down the expanse of its belly are the color of ash, as too is the leathery skin of its wings.  Those appendages seem twice as large as the body of the beast itself, carrying it across the sky with ease.
The lady sits on the far edge of his bed, the fabric of her long sleeve pooling across the coverlet like a night sky.
“That’s fortunate, as I’m not giving it to you.” He turns to Crowley. “Do you accept?”
Staring out over the expanse of beach, all Dean can think is how much the crater in the sand looks like a snow angel.
"How is someone with the moniker Daredemon such a prude?" Charlie asks, but dutifully turns around to start tapping something into the computer terminal against the wall. "Things really are quiet around here lately, even for South Dakota. It makes me nervous, actually...holy shit Dean, Bobby wasn’t kidding, since when do you let your guard down so much?"
"Dean, you can't be here."
"Could you not draw attention to us, please? I don't want him to see me."
Dean pulls their hands apart and shifts a little so they’re facing each other, and Cas curls his empty fingers around the curve of his knee, relishing the lingering warmth there.
Dean is about to argue, to point out the obvious -- that there's nothing there but the neighbor's house, exactly like their own -- but Sam's gasp makes him look in the indicated direction. Instead of the oak tree in the yard and the brick wall of the house beyond, a different landscape twinkles in the distance, a giant maze of dark twisting hedges and stone walls. He walks toward the opening in awe.
"What the hell could be better than hanging out with the brother she wishes she'd married?"
"Then it will only take a year for me to be proven right." Balthazar rolls his eyes as he leaves the room as dramatically as possible, and Castiel tosses the crystal onto the floor at his feet, watching it shatter into a burst of tiny stars.
"I most certainly can, especially when I've been asked properly."
He's never felt anything like this, never dared to touch himself this way, never allowed himself more than the thrill of running his fingers over his own rim in the shower, daring to touch that secret place only in the dark where no one can ever see. The sensation of Dean's finger inside him is everything and not enough all at once and he groans.
The woods themselves are a blanket of darkness, where even the weak starlight doesn't penetrate. He trips over a root and tumbles down a slope, taking a moment to catch his breath and make sure he hasn't damaged his limbs before the dragon's cry rends the air again. He blinks his eyes, trying to adjust as he feels his way through the dark forest, putting as much distance as he can between the castle and himself.
Sam nods, already too wise for his fifteen years after being a king for two. “They mourned you, too. They loved you, Dean.” They sit for a while, watching the simple life occuring around them. “You’re not coming back with me, are you?”
"I do, but I think it will sound better if I'm
Adam was ten years old, but now he’ll never see eleven, only the ivory silk on the inside of a coffin. He’d been buried in the little league uniform that Dean had washed and pressed, starched with tears when there was no one else to see.
Dick emerges from the bedroom a few hours after Samandriel leaves, freshly showered and carrying soiled bed sheets. He comes to a screeching halt when he sees Cas, still sitting at the kitchen island. Dick’s eyes drift to the door and the travel bag still on the floor beside it, then back to Cas.
“He’ll be the toast of the next masquerade, probably.”
Impossibly the wind seems to pick up even more outside, howling like a ghost and making the ancient shutters rattle against the old stone walls of the lighthouse. It startles them both, and Dean steps away with a chuckle.
"Fine, then. Charlie! She's like twice your age."
"Well?” Charlie asks when he joins them at the table, fanning himself with the index cards he has clutched in one hand. It feels really warm in the gym, suddenly. "Do you have a date?"
"Cas, if you can be here than so can I, it's no more dangerous for you than for me." He moves closer, slowly reaching out with one hand to touch Castiel’s face, his eyes silently asking for permission. Castiel closes his eyes as he relents, and Dean’s fingers graze his cheek, solid and warm.
It occurs to him, with no shortage of irony, that he's actually wearing two masks tonight, and he thinks one of those he's worn for quite some time.
"What do you mean, no? You're not the boss of me."
"Since she chose the restaurant," Cas says levelly, catching the flinch on Dick's face that is probably imperceptible to everyone else, "I would imagine it's a great favorite of hers."
“Oh, about twenty years.”
"Hey, don't be like that. Everybody has at least one really bad relationship that they have no idea how they got into, much less stayed in. You’re still socially stupid when you're coming out of college, even if it’s grad school."
“It might be good for you to have a friend here your own age,” Castiel says to him later from the darkest corner of the kitchen.
"Shit." He pulls Cas closer to him, cradling his face. "Not like this, please. I just found you and I don't want to lose you." He blinks his eyes rapidly, trying to will away the threatening tears, but one escapes and falls onto Cas's cheek, leaving a trail through the soot on his face.
"What are you talking about?" Sam gets no chance to answer as the French doors in the room fly open, and Dean instinctively turns away to shield his brother. Wind from the storm is whipping the curtains into the room, serving to frame the tall figure that appears in silhouette, outlined by moon and mystery as he strides into the room to stand before them. Dean turns, pushing Sam behind him, backing away as the man comes to a stop. He's dressed all in black, a high-collared cloak falling from his shoulders to the floor. Parts of his costume catch the lightning, flashing like black diamonds in the darkness of the room. He's an imposing figure with pale skin and dark hair, and as Dean takes in the striking features of that face he can't help but swallow. He should be afraid, and he is, but there's a part of him that is equally enthralled at the appearance of this stranger.
Dean swallows, closing his eyes as though to give himself strength. "I won't. You have no power over me, Castiel."
"Was that so ha..." Cas slams the phone back into the cradle, cutting him off, but the satisfaction it brings is short-lived. He leans on the desk and puts his head in his hands, but soon enough hears two sharp raps on the doorframe followed by the sound of footsteps. He groans, refusing to look up.
Dean makes a sharp u-turn, apologizing to Baby as he kicks gravel up into wheel wells, and speeds back to the motel.
"How long is a while?"
“Yeah,” Dean says, seeing an out. “Caught me off guard, needed to make sure I was seeing correctly.”
"What?"
“Moving on now!” Dean says loudly, glaring at all three of them and practically shoving Crowley down to the next station.
"These are not bad traits."
“Just never seen him outside of school before, didn’t think he was the type to socialize.”
"Best not disturb them during milking time. The women will want to fuss over the likes of you, and they don't need the distraction. We'll show you the stables first and then the kennels. Cows ought to be finished by then."
"Ms. MacLeod," Cas says, leaning into Dick's space to speak to the striking redhead on his other side. "I apologize, I was at the bar when you arrived. I'm Cas Novak."
"Insolent fool," Castiel spits in his direction. "I don't know why I put up with you."
“So he chose for me.”
Later Dean realizes that he’s being carried in his father’s arms, dozing against his shoulder as they head back inside the castle. He wakes as John puts him on the floor, helping him to take off his jerkin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right. One night.”
Cas twirls his empty cup in his hands before setting it on the dryer with a sigh. "I don't know."
"The who?" Dean whispers over his shoulder, and Sam elbows him in the ribs.
The entire structure is encased in ice, ocean spray adhering to the metal railings and the old stone steps, making it look like a strange cave formation. He's seen pictures of something similar online, from freak storms around the Great Lakes, but it's unheard of here. He wants to take a closer look despite the high wind and bitter cold, and he crosses the barren expanse of yard, snow crunching beneath his feet.
"What was the last thing you watched?"
"Okay, see, this is definitely an argument worth having and we’re going to come back to it later."
“Hi Mother Mary!” he says cheerfully, and she pats his hand with a smile. He’d started calling her that years ago when Dean introduced her as “My mother, Mary” and it stuck, first because he thought it was funny, but then out of habit.
"That's the spirit."
“I’m afraid,” Castiel finally whispers. “Afraid of what you’ll think of me when you know the truth.”
Dean rests his hand on the face of the door, considering. Castiel will be sleeping, and not expecting anyone, especially in a place that’s forbidden for all of them. It would be an unforgivable intrusion.
"A very, very long time ago."
“Well,” she says, adjusting him to sit on her left thigh while she points people out with her right hand. “That lady in front of the fire feeds all of us, but you must call her Missouri. She doesn’t like to be called Cook.” The woman smiles at him, and Dean relaxes a little at her kind dark eyes and soft round face as she waves. “That big man behind her is Benny, and he’s our butcher, but he’s a dumpling of a man for all that he’s a giant who wields knives.” She pokes him in the ribs as she says it, and he can’t help the little giggle that escapes him as another lady sits down at the table.
It feels strange to Dean when he starts the first day of senior year just like all the rest of his peers, more or less: new class schedule, new locker combination, new mix of students in the cafeteria during lunchtime. It's just that he still feels like the new kid, even though he'd started school here the year before. Just a nameless entity that's practically invisible to everyone around him. He hopes it will be better for Sam when he becomes a freshman next year, but for now he needs to get through it himself.
“That’s not entirely true,” Charlie says over her shoulder as she turns on the overhead lights. The large empty space of the gymnasium makes their footfalls echo as they cross the shiny wood floor to the table that's waiting for them. “He’s been saying it for much longer than that, but you’ve only known about the last three, and you're probably gonna hear it every year for the rest of your life.”
“What, you planning to court him the old-fashioned way? Like you haven’t been dating the shit out of him for months now by bringing him to every outing? You introduced him to me the first week, Dean, if anything you’re in the accelerated program.”
“Ouch.”
Cas rolls on his back, unable to meet the intensity in Dean's eyes even in the semi-darkness. "It's what I'm supposed to do."
Castiel doesn’t answer right away, eyes drifting to one of the banks as though he’s studying the way they glitter in the light. He seems perplexed at the question rather than angry, and Dean takes the time to study his profile: the way his brow is furrowed in thought, the straight angle of his nose above pale lips, firm jaw above the long column of his throat. He’s grateful that Castiel creates such elaborate settings for each visit, because the surroundings are the only thing that can make him look away from such a compelling sight, the only constant in every landscape.
He's eager to learn, and he treats every tool with a cautious reverence that Dean is grateful for, since he definitely doesn't want anyone getting injured on his watch. Taking the time to teach Castiel how to use everything slows down the process, but they still get further along than Dean would have done by himself.
"I think it's hilarious given that the person bankrolling this whole operation is a lawyer, even though you're no Matt Murdoch."
"I deserve to start with a clean slate," Dean says curtly, hands clenched into fists as he leans his knuckles hard into the surface of the desk. "It didn't work out between us, that's all. Nobody did anything wrong, and I couldn't see myself trying to divide that life in half so I'd get my fair share of everything we failed at."
"Can we please call it something that doesn't remind me of long johns until Ash gives it a name?"
Dean had gotten a job at the community pool, oddly enough, or maybe not so odd -- he knew how to fix things and handle money, which came in handy at the snack bar or when equipment was on the fritz, and he knew enough first aid that he passed the lifeguard test, too. He would marvel at all the carefree kids turning darker in the sun under the watchful eyes of their parents, reapplying sunscreen on their tender skin before it reddened and making sure they get something to eat. He'd spent the whole summer wondering if it was the kind of life they might have known if Mary Winchester had lived. He tried to picture them all together as a family: Mary's blond hair shining in the sun, John lounging on a towel next to her in a pair of swim trunks, Sam playing Marco Polo in the water with kids he'd grown up with all his life.
Dean pouts in disappointment, then studies the man before him. Castiel looks about the same age as a new knight, with dark hair and bright eyes, and though he seems somewhat strange Dean isn’t afraid of him. He finds himself yawning, suddenly, and tries to shake the sleep out of his mind.
The horse lips at Dean's neck, and he giggles and draws away before petting its forelock, reaching for the apple with his other hand. "I don't know how far it is from here." He feeds the apple to Gabriel, who eats it with relish and then snuffles at Dean's tunic, investigating him for more. "Can I have apples for Impala and Samandriel, too?"
“Dean, why are you…”
“Oh, is he diabetic?”
"It's because I want you." Cas swallows hard, thinking he misheard.
“Is the castle haunted?” he asks without preamble. To his surprise Mildred doesn’t even raise her head, just continues sewing as she answers.
The meal is less tense without Sam and John glaring at each other, but only just. Dean excuses himself to help Kate wash dishes as John takes Adam into the living room to watch football, but she doesn’t say anything as they clear the table and put all the leftovers in appropriately sized containers. Not until she’s rinsing things in the sink and handing them over for Dean to put into the dishwasher.
“Ah, well. I’m supposed to guard the castle, and punish all the trespassers.” He raises an eyebrow at Dean as he says it, but Dean can only giggle, and Castiel gives him a small smile in return.
"Jesus Christ," he manages to say, and is startled when Dean chokes in a way that sounds like laughter before resuming his steady pace. It's too slow to bring him to the edge but the sensation is incredible, and he barely registers the click of the lube again before a second finger joins the first. This one stings slightly, and he tenses a bit as Dean works it into him, twisting both fingers as he goes, flicking his tongue across Castiel's slit on the upstroke to distract him from the discomfort.
“Speak for yourself, old man.” Rufus grins briefly before he sips from his cup. “What about you?”
His interaction with the goblin king at the very end haunts his dreams sometimes, popping with a clarity that even the waking world sometimes lacks. Castiel so close to him, as though they're intimate acquaintances, gazing into one another's eyes like they have all the time in the world. Each time he wakes from one of these he feels longing stronger than any he’s ever felt for a home, a friend, or the mother he lost too soon.
“Then why did you give me such a hard time about helping me find him?”
Dean's face barely peers above the tabletop, but instead of feeling small he falls unobtrusive, and once he tastes Missouri's biscuits he stops thinking about all the strange eyes staring at him. Instead he focuses only on the small group near him. Mildred and Ellen are on either side of him with Rufus and Bobby across, and Missouri finally joining them at the table end. He looks up and down the table, searching for Castiel, but doesn’t see him, and he’s too timid right now to ask.
start worrying, at least not until we can get some concrete evidence that this is something to be worried about. Come on, Sammy, you know you don't want to blow your load early, Eileen has enough to complain about."
“Castiel, is that you?” he murmurs to himself, but then the shape huffs, a plume of smoke leaving its nostrils, and Dean shakes his head. “Storm, then.” He’s grateful for the protection of the hut, little as it is, and he holds his breath as the dragon sits back on its haunches, wings furled at its back, and after a minute it curls up on the ground in a ball. “What are you doing out there?”
Dean wakes with a start, sitting up in bed to stare at his visitor as though he’s never seen him before.
They'd moved about the room in circles, and though he knew they were surrounded Dean could see nothing but the king. His gaze travelled from those eyes to his lips as if magnetized, wondering what it would be like just lean in just for a taste, if it would be anything like the girls he'd kissed on summer fairgrounds...
“I only allowed it because it also means leader in one of the old tongues,” John grumbles from the desk where he sits, poring over documents. “I still think you should have let me call him Drake.”
“There’s nothing interesting about me,” he whispers. “I haven’t seen the things you have.”
"I guess it must be business and not pleasure, then." He takes the dirty glass away and grabs a fresh one, deftly filling it just as before and placing it on the bartop, whisking away the five dollar bill Cas puts down and swapping it for a single in change. Cas takes a long, grateful swallow, then licks the flecks of foam from his upper lip. Dean catches himself licking his own lips, turning away to grab a towel and hoping Cas didn't notice.
“So you were left alone.”
"You missed out on a lot of the learning curve during those years, my man."
"Because the brain's facial recognition software is shit,even with supersight. Sam had a beard for a while, and when he shaved it I literally couldn't recognize him in a crowd for weeks. Amused the hell out of him when we’d meet at the bar. He kept texting me ‘warmer’ or ‘colder’, that little shit.”
"Fair, Sammy, that's not fair, there's that chick in Minneapolis who can create earthquakes, what's her name, uh..."
"Even your boyfriend?" It comes out before he can think about it, and he fights the desperate urge to slap himself. "Sorry, that was, uh. Several levels of presumption too many, sorry."
"I'm glad you chose a dark color for such form fitting trousers," he comments wryly.
“Grandfather?” he asks, and the shadow unfolds itself, lengthens and solidifies as it stands. He doesn’t recognize the face that turns to him, and he’s too mystified to be afraid. As it reaches the side of the bed he can make out a woman with long dark hair in a gown of ebon velvet, littered with sparkling dots as though he’s staring into the night sky. They seem to swirl across the expanse of fabric as she comes closer, mesmerizing in their impossible dance, like something alive. The gown pools around her feet at the hem, and even the sleeves themselves are so long that they touch the floor. “Who are you?”
"I see we've reached the regressive stage where you talk like you're four." Dean's only had one beer because he has to patrol, and he knows from experience that being around drunk people is only fun when you, yourself, are also drunk. He clenches his jaw as he pulls out of the lot, the midnight street already deserted even on a Friday night.
“Is that so?”
“Yes, it is. I would have liked to see a dragon, myself, but they’re all long gone.”
"The one you made out with on top of all the furs that time?"
. The fare is high end comfort food, and they suggest pairings with their own brews, and...”
"I'm sure you'll find another sap to take my place soon enough." He hates the rasp in his voice, the tremble in his clenched fists as he fights to maintain control over himself. It wouldn't do to punch Dick in the face, no matter how much he deserves it.
He hides his face in the bend of his knees. “It’s not just about that, okay?”
It takes every ounce of discipline Castiel possesses not to run out of the rectory when the time finally arrives for him to leave. He forces himself to take measured steps, counting them silently in his head as his heels clack on the floor of the corridor like a metronome. He doesn't see anyone on his way out of the building to his car, but he feels like there are a dozen sets of eyes upon him peering through slitted blinds. It's not until he's behind the wheel that he realizes he's been holding his breath, and it whooshes out of him in a sharp exhale, bringing starry pinpricks of light behind his closed eyes for several seconds.
"You mean
In the morning he finds himself once again trailing behind Bobby and Rufus as they care for the animals. He’s worried that if he doesn’t get home soon his father will be furious, and his mother is probably frantic, wondering what has become of him. It’s when Bobby and Rufus start arguing by the goat pen that he manages to sneak away, heading for the treeline. He doesn’t know where he is or where the forest leads, but the need to find a way home overrides his fear of the unknown.
“For what?”
* * *
Sam had arrived late last night and Dean barely even recognized him, despite the years of talking over Skype.
"I'm almost fourteen, I'm too old to be babysat."
“You were holding your own pretty well there. Not many can handle Rufus in a full-on snit.”
"It always works in the movies!"
He turns away and takes a walk around the lighthouse, marvelling at how many things are completely encased in ice: electrical wires, the barren branches of a tree in the front yard, the overgrown brush along the other side of the old quarters.
"Dorks. It's about time."
He wonders how someone like this, affable and adorable and desirable all in equal measure, could end up with that asshole from the restaurant. Cas had told him some of the story, but seemed reluctant to discuss anything in detail. It’s probably for the best, because Dean already feels an overwhelming sense of protectiveness, coupled with a fervent desire to do everything in his power to make this man happy.
"Jesus, Sam, he's got a mind of his own, he can do whatever he wants."
“Why do you ask me that?” Castiel asks softly, staying where he is on the far side of the room, but the look on his face confirms every suspicion Dean has.
"Like you find me intoxicating."
“Just like that? You’ve decided for both of us and I have to accept it?”
he says heatedly, but Charlie just crosses her arms and raises an eyebrow. “Just once, the night we met. I’d hardly call it a kiss, though. More like a peck, there and gone.”
It's nothing he would ever say to anyone out loud, but Cas doesn't actually mind having to quarantine at home. If not for the low-level thrum of terror in his veins every time he looks at the virus statistics, he finds it preferable to keep to himself than have to endure awkward everyday interactions with his coworkers, or anyone else for that matter. He's far more productive at his small kitchen table than he ever was in his office, without the constant distraction of people wandering in and out, asking him questions as a pretense to avoid doing their own tasks. It's much harder to goof off in Teams when your boss is ever present in the background, and Cas is able to focus and do what needs to be done before the work day is technically even over. He hasn't put in overtime once since the work from home situation began, which would be a great argument to allow work from home to continue -- if he'd ever gotten paid for all that extra time in the first place.
"Where is Castiel?"
"Don't be ridiculous, Castiel. I'm not..."
“You, of course.”
"Dean!" Castiel is awake and sleepily pouring coffee as he shoves the door closed behind him, both the wind at his back and the cold ache in his fingers making it difficult. "Your lips are blue. Why aren't you wearing a coat?" He abandons his mug to slip an arm around Dean's waist and lead him to sit at the table, then busies himself making another cup of coffee. He places it on the table before Dean, grabbing his hands and wrapping them around the mug. "How long were you out there?"
"Charlie."
"Hugs are only for people I like."
Everyone in the gym freezes in place, all eyes turned in his direction.
It’s so easy to be with Cassie that it’s been a year before Dean knows it, and he’s glad to have her there that first summer when Sam decides to stay in California. She’s easy with John and Kate and even Adam when he finally takes her home to Sunday dinner, her genuine interest in everyone making for a more animated affair than ever before. Charlie is thrilled to finally meet her, elbowing Dean in the ribs when he introduces them and uses the word “girlfriend,” then elbowing him again later when Cassie goes to the bar to replenish their drinks and calling her a “keeper.”
“He’s been through a lot, so he’s passed out upstairs, sleeping like the dead.”
." The guy looks startled, then nods. Dean holds his hands out to the sides as he takes a mock bow. "Serving the great city of Sioux Falls for over a decade."
“Yeah, he's a police detective now, comes into the restaurant sometimes and gossips like a church lady about people we used to know. Gordon went to jail for armed robbery last year, if you can believe that."
“Come on, Sammy. Things are a lot better for him now, you’d know if you ever came home.”
He’s glad Meg’s left the room, because he can’t contain his smile.
"Those poor animals," Jack says, looking mournfully at the table. "Isn't there anything we can do?"
Cas just grins down at him, amused, and Dean can't help it anymore. He pulls him just close enough to kiss that stupid smile off his face.
"Can't believe you're done with the top floor already, are you sure you're sleeping?"
Dean manages to glance down just in time to see the live grenade detonate in Bartholomew's hand before they’re out the skylight and into the open air, the promised chain reaction bursting into a hundred blooms of pure fire below them.
"It takes almost an hour to drive out there, I'm not gonna commute every day. Besides, aren't you eager to get me out of your guest room? I know it must be torture, knowing Andrea is comparing the two of us constantly and wondering where she went wrong."
“Nothing bad’s gonna happen when you leave, Dean.”
"Shut up, Sam."
He whistles lowly. "Damn. Ash really outdid himself with this one."
Castiel glares at her, but she just smiles in return as she leaves his office. "Thank you, Meg, for your wisdom and clarity," she calls over her shoulder as she exits.
“Good, then he won’t hear me coming,” Sam says, darting for the stairs with Eileen on his heels before Dean can even react. They’re already at the door of his bedroom when he reaches the top, curled around each side of the doorframe to peer at the former goblin king like a zoo exhibit.
There's no answer for some time, and Dean finally turns on his side, resting on an elbow.
“What did you call him?” Amara whispers, but Dean just clings to the dragon, unable to speak. He ignores Amara, ignores everything in the room, only squeezing his eyes shut as he feels Storm’s chest rise and fall beneath him, slower, and slower, knowing it won’t be long until it stills altogether.
“That’s probably how he
"I thought it would also give you a chance to talk to me about it again. Two birds, one stone?"
“I remember you,” Cas says lowly, and the timbre of his voice sparks a flicker of a memory that’s gone too quickly for Dean to capture before Cas clears his throat and straightens up. “After all, who could forget Carter High's Homecoming King and
