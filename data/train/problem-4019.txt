“Ever read the story of Odysseus Dean?” at Dean’s blank look he continued, “The Odyssey...the Trojan War? Charybdis? The Cyclops? I thought that was still standard high school fare.”
"uh...I just mean you were always so smart, so I just figured...well anyway, you look good Cas...You look real good."
The money his mother, who had held him and loved him before she died, left Cas, it wasn’t much - but
The excitement had drawn another nurse and two orderlies to the room.
“Jesus…” Dean let go, stunned at the thought of Cas with this person. He barely noticed as Marv slid away from him against the wall and ran down the alley. Dean's breathing quickened. Maybe she wasn’t with Cas. Maybe Cas just wanted to get away like Balthazar. Maybe he wasn’t answering because he was pissed. Maybe he was somewhere safe. Maybe.
For the next two days, Dean arrived at work early and stayed late, talking little, smiling less. He poured every measure of his energy into his work, and when things were slow at the shop he went to Sam and Jess’s house. Both of them came home from a flea market Saturday bewildered to see that Dean had mowed their lawn and cleaned their gutters. Sam, insisting on thanking Dean, suggested they all go grab a bite, but Jess cryptically insisted she had her own plans. So Dean and Sam grabbed burgers and went to the pool hall, and Sam racked and Dean broke and cleared the table of solids before his brother even got a turn. Sammy’s eyes widened and Dean was so impressed with himself he actually broke a smile for the first time in days.
“Sure,” Cas smiled into the phone.
Cas asked about Bobby, and over the next hour or so they fell into conversation about ordinary things. Dean worked mostly at the shop in Sacramento, but was helping Bobby when he needed to deal with business here on occasion. Dean hadn’t really gotten the chance to explore the city yet outside of a few days, plus the night out with Cas and Balthazar at Cafe Luna. He hadn’t known Cas was in San Francisco until recently.
Cas felt like he belonged. Cas felt content.
Dean shook his head uselessly, forgetting Cas couldn’t see, pulling at the tears forming behind his closed eyes.
“This is a far cry from San Francisco.” Dean mused glancing around at the quiet suburban neighborhood.
“Well...I’m sort of here now Dean.” Cas said, his voice, a soothing comfort. “Close your eyes.”
“And what if I want you all soft and gentle tonight?” Dean asked, his eyes heavy-lidded and wonderstruck. “What if I wanna play with your body till you’re twisting and squirming under my touch? You look so fucking beautiful like that, baby…” Dean’s breath quickened. “Would you let me do whatever I want to you Cas?” His eyes danced over Cas’s face, settling on his lips, before he leaned forward again to place a tender, worshipful kiss there. Cas loved it when Dean was gentle like this. He knew Dean was holding back a little...drawing him in.
“We fall down, we get back up again, we repeat. We never
“French fries and milkshakes?” Cas teased.
It was purposely vague and yet somehow Dean hoped Cas would understand exactly what he meant. Dean waited for any response.
Meg was crazy and affectionate. But that's not why Cas loved Meg. She burned bright like a star, yet somehow she’d decided she wanted Cas in her orbit. He couldn’t fully understand it. She was an enigma. Like Dean.
“How have you been Cas?” Dean whispered, looking from Cas’s arm, where the ghost of a track mark showed on his pale skin, to his face. Cas blushed and pulled down his sleeve looking away. “I’m fine Dean.” he said, his voice suddenly firm and tense.
“How long we talking?”
“Something like that...yeah.”
“Tell me!” Dean begged before Sam even finished hanging up the phone.
Dean’s whole body thrummed, warm and electric as Cas laid his head back down against Dean’s shoulder, turning his attention back to the screen, and settling in with a contented hum. Dean kissed into his hair, bringing his hand up to smooth a few wavy, almond-scented locks away from Cas’s forehead.
Cas blushed even redder, his eyes dark, rimmed with blue like the night sky. He was ready, eager, compliant.
Over the years, working for the State of California had made Rufus a little more than jaded, a little more than crotchety. It wasn’t the people themselves, the ones who needed his help. It was the damn bureaucracy. That same bureaucracy left the social work division underfunded and overmandated, and clients (Rufus refused to call them patients) were often cut loose without support before they were really ready.
Cas rolled up the window and stepped out of the car, locking it. Dean stepped smiling into his space as he turned.
“You know Cas if you w-wanted to see me naked you could’a had it that night in San Francisco.”
Cas. Missouri had done him a kindness.
Cas finished his water. He stripped down from his clothes to boxers and turned off the light, settling on the couch with a blanket and pillow. For the past few months he’d spent more and more of his nights here and it seemed natural now. It was easier to drift off letting Balthazar believe he had fallen asleep watching TV than to come up with excuses to keep from his bed.
“Oh Jenny, Cas doesn’t want to wear those!” Hannah scolded.
“Get that little lost puppy look off your face. The Cas I remember from high school was a badass who would fight to give everything he could to the people he cared about. Time you fought for yourself for once!”
“I have some clean things you can wear...if it's not too weird for you.”
Something about yesterday didn’t add up and Dean couldn’t help but feel in his gut that their mother was hiding something from them. If that something had almost gotten Cas killed…...Well, he could….would, deal with that on another day. For now, it was enough to just be home, safe with Sam and Cas.
“Jesus Dean!” Cas interrupted, closing his eyes and shaking his head as if to force away a memory. “You really have no idea what it was like for me!”
Sam’s eyes widened and the guy quickly flicked his attention back to his own table and date when he realized he was caught out.
More than once tonight at the club, he got the feeling that Dean was wishing he were somewhere else as he gazed off distractedly during the conversation. He guessed Dean had what he wanted now, with Benny, and who could blame him? Benny had that sly smile and southern charm. He was funny….. and smart,........ and so much more interesting than Cas could ever be…………….........
“I didn’t...it just sort of happened before I realized what the firm was getting involved with.”
Dean breathed a sigh as the weight of those words, finally spoken, lifted from his shoulders...Dean felt
While he was initially given a project defending a preserve from government encroachment, that type of 'white-hat' case seemed more the exception than the norm as the next generation of partners took on more lucrative interests. The firm's newest clients were mostly corporate and some of the biggest polluters and exploiters - the clients that brought the firm the big bucks to help them avoid cleaning up their messes, and who also had the PR resources to keep most of their work under the radar and out of the news.
Cas scooted out of the booth. “Be right back okay? I gotta use the restroom.”
Dean knew that question came out with an anger he didn’t actually feel. He didn’t know any other way to push Cas away...free of him. Cas didn’t deserve to have to deal with his damage. Even as he said it,  it stabbed at him to know he was hurting Cas, again.
Hannah’s eyes flicked to Dean’s in time to see undisguised longing. A mirror of what she’d seen on Cas’s own face the night Dean left Cas so abruptly.
He was making a mess of it.
"So have you done a lot of racing?"
“Oh Lord! It’s not
“You mean, you come here?”
“Yeah Dean, there was no answer at his place so I called the restaurant.”
Cas returned to Dean, stroking his shoulder gently to wake him. Dean’s eyelids fluttered open.
On day ten Dean reluctantly attended a group session. “Whatever gets me out of here sooner,” he scowled.
He felt lighter than air as he drove along the highway and away from the congestion of Sacramento. He was on his way to Cas. Dean drummed his fingers along the steering wheel to the music, singing softly along.
Dean heard the click on Cas’s end, the receiver still clutched in his hand.
“Nice to meet you,” Dean added.
Dean stood looking at himself in the bathroom mirror, hating the thing he saw staring back. His hands were still trembling slightly after all of this time. He was so ashamed.
Dean trailed his fingers along Castiel's arm and side.
He didn’t understand why Dean decided to contact him again. He was glad he did, and thankful that Dean told him at least a little of why he left, but he could tell that Dean was disinterested. When Dean wanted something or someone he looked them in the eye, daring them to escape before taking possession. That’s how it felt the night they met.
Cas rolled his eyes, feeling his face redden again. "I’ll consider it,” he said, giving her a lopsided grin.
Cas pulled in, parked at the end of the lot, and jumped out. Going quickly to the counter Cas saw the young cashier’s eyes widen. “You’re bleeding!” she said pointing to his forehead.
Cas took a while just looking at those last words.
Cas looked curiously at Dean, trying to understand the mixture of emotions on his face.
Cas hesitated, not sure yet how much to confide in Rachel.
Dean searched for any memory of it but then just shrugged helplessly. Cas opened the passenger side door and Dean got in, not even bothering to argue.
"Hey Dean!" Rufus said quickly, trying to catch him.
“Cas?”
That was a blow that landed, but Dean didn’t have time to play defense.
“Wow! You two did great! Did you use your manners?”
“Torque? Seriously?”
being honest he’d tell Benny that he was a fucking mess -  how lately most days he felt like he was stuck in a blizzard, shoveling and shoveling to exhaustion just to keep his head above it, just to keep from being crushed and suffocated by an avalanche of thoughts and emotions and fucking regrets. He didn’t want to talk about his goddamn feelings about fucking up the best thing he’d ever had in his life.

"What about you?” Cas asked. "You need one."
my thing, Cas” Dean smiled. “And you’re gonna show me your moves on the dance floor tonight, right?”
Finally Dean, who had only listened without judgment the night before, let Sammy have it.
"I don't think I've ever run so hard," Dean recounted laughing.
in Dean’s life felt the weight of it.
“Expecting someone darlin?” the waitress chimed.
audience,” he smiled at Dean with fascinated curiosity. It worked to lighten the mood.
The radio chatter from a nearby ambulance was shifting Dean back and forth from past to present. He needed it to stop. Standing up again, he forced himself to open his eyes, searching. Looking across the street. One, Pizza shop…...two, mother and child with balloons…..three, some kids with football jackets walking across the street…..four, a poster for a music festival…..five, a gurney pulled out of the ambulance - fuck no! This was too hard here…..Dean brought his hands to his face again. A hand on his shoulder shook him to awareness.
Dean liked women, enjoyed the hell out of them. Had even truly loved a few. There was no denying he found women pleasing. But that wasn’t it. Cas was different. His Cas. The one he had come to know. Since Cas’s confession Dean had run it through his mind so many times trying to figure out when it was he first realized he had feelings for Cas too. And not just emotional...physical feelings...physical desire. When was the first time he tried to bury it? There had been so many moments over the years when Dean felt an overwhelming need to grip Cas tight and…well...Dean usually would quash the thought by gripping the closest beer or woman at the bar and go off with her leaving Cas and Sam behind with a wink. But more than once on those occasions with a woman he imagined another’s lips on his mouth...another’s hands on his skin.
“Hey - there, what’s going on now?” Benny asked, catching up.
As they reached Baby, Cas stopped, turning to Dean with a look of realization on his face. “‘We’ll need a safe word."
Dean considered - he desperately wanted to bathe himself in alcohol right now. “Just a root beer.”
“Thanks, Cas. See you soon, sweetheart?”
Dean’s face flushed at the idea of laying down here with Cas and was glad for the darkness to hide his reaction. He didn’t want to delve into his thoughts at the moment. He only knew he wanted to feel Cas next to him, wanted to hold him close as he should have in that barn tonight as Cas lay dying. His whole being needed to make it up to Cas for not holding him tight and letting him know he wasn't alone as the poison and pain spread through him, taking him over. But Dean had froze. He just stood there not knowing what to do, too busy trying to think of a way to save Cas.
In any case Dean tried to play it all off like all of it was no big deal. Like ‘shit just happens’ and you handle it. But Pamela wasn’t a fool.
Dean couldn't form words.
Dean’s lips first touched Cas’s in a chaste kiss, and then returned for a second more lingering one...Cas’s lips, soft and full, opened slightly in an invitation that Dean accepted, his tongue gently, lovingly seeking Castiel’s until Castiel deepened and opened to him fully. In that moment Dean was lost. Castiel’s hands moved more rapidly now, searching, testing, enjoying the feel of Dean’s body, relishing the sensations of muscle and bone beneath his fingers. Dean’s hands moved to pull at Cas’s shirt, needing to feel Cas’s skin. As their breath quickened, hearts beating beyond measure Cas stopped and pulled away to look at Dean, breathless, a smile on his lips, his eyes filled with longing.
That was when Dean fucked up. That was when Dean said the wrong thing.
“Well I could do both I think Cas,” Dean suggested with a hopeful shrug. “Spend some time with Sammy, Bobby, and hopefully Jess, then head over to you?”
Whatever Cas expected, it clearly wasn’t that. Balthazar detected the subtle stillness in Cas and then just as quickly as it came it passed. Cas’s face was unreadable.
Not finding soda, Cas brought Dean a glass of water and dropped himself onto the couch.
“Your turn Cas baby....gonna give you wings…” She promised, her voice dripping like honey as she straddled his thigh and readied the needle.
“No.” Cas laughed. “I’ll take a taxi back.”
...for as long as you’ll let me..and even then, for as long as I live after that.”
“The neighbor across the street has a hive in his backyard. He let us - me and Hannah and the kids I mean, he let us watch him from a distance all suited up. Brought us over fresh honey later. It was pretty neat.”
Dean felt his cock stir at the husky sound of it. Something about their earlier conversation made Dean eager to obey. He let himself be led back down the little staircase.
By the time he returned to the living room Kali had arrived and Gabriel was introducing them. She smiled warmly as he shook her hand.
“Mr. Winchester, I’m Dr. Richings. Do you know why you’re here?”
Cas cocked his head, frowning as Balthazar grabbed a bottle of vodka from the cabinet, pouring himself a shot.
“Just….” Sam hesitated.
He thought about grabbing the children by the hand and just walking through someone’s backyard to break through into the next development, but dismissed the idea of prolonging the night as ridiculous. Little Jenny was already now on her last legs anyway. Cas resorted to carrying her when she sat down on the curb crying that she was too tired and wanted her candy “Now!” It was only about six o’clock and none of them had eaten dinner, but Cas was pretty sure there shouldn’t be rules about such things on a holiday so he carefully checked a Mr. Goodbar before giving it to her as Tommy ran back from the final house, jack-o-lantern bucket filled to overflowing with candy.
Like some kind of small window of opportunity may have opened. Still, Cas was afraid he’d end up crushed like a bird who thinks the way is clear to fly through only to end bloody, smashing it's head on glass walls he didn’t see.
“I was going to say ‘tiring,’ - but yeah, I can see how it might be lonely.” Cas threw Dean a sad smile, eyeing him affectionately. He reached up to swipe a dot of ketchup from the edge of Dean’s lips with his thumb, bringing it to his mouth and licking it off.
Dean grabbed his arm to stop him and when he went to throw Dean off, pinned him against the alley wall. Dean grasped tightly at Marv’s jacket, holding him fast, his face an inch away, despite the man’s fetid breath.
“Eleven thirty.”
“Well then...hang on a second.” Rufus walked over to the book shelf of his living room and pulled out the book in question. It took less than a minute for him to find the passage he was looking for. “Maybe you forgot this part.”
Dean closed his eyes. “Cas?” he whispered.
that seemed like home. Dean was having a hard time differentiating.
Dean smiled sweetly, looking at Cas like he must be a dream and not really, truly there in the flesh in front of him. “I’ve missed you so much.” Dean’s other hand went to Cas’s temple, brushing back a lock of hair that had fallen forward there.
“He made terrible accusations Castiel. He said…..” she hesitated but didn’t spare him. “He said you were a 'sexual deviant,' she stated, looking concerned.
If Dean had never left, hadn’t thrown away Cas’s love all those years ago, he could put his arm round him now and pull him in close. Cas’s head would rest against the hollow of Dean’s neck. His perpetually unruly hair, smelled of something sweet like sandalwood and honeysuckle. Dean could almost press a kiss to him there…
Dean found himself holding his breath.
“I’m supposed to tell you that these are from Nick,” she said nodding towards the bar on the lower level where Cas could see the guy from the bathroom raising a glass to them with a wink before turning back to the bar.”
“Really?”
**********
“Shit! Could he be in the hospital again?”
Dean asked.
Sam took Dean’s jacket and hung it on a peg by the door as he welcomed him inside.
“Hey!” A voice rang distantly in Dean’s ear from his right. “Three more!” Further down, a man in a red baseball cap slammed down an empty bottle. He glanced at Dean and then back to the man in front of Dean with a pinched-nosed glare.
Tommy, who at age eight thought puns were the highest form of entertainment joined in giggling with “Don’t be mad! They're just kitten you Cas!”
Balthazar’s hand tensed in Cas’s hair. He sighed.
“You’re bleeding again ‘cause of me.” Dean looked up at Cas's forehead and Cas pulled another napkin from his pocket where he’d stuffed them, dabbing it to his temple in case there was more blood. There was only a trace.
Cas dropped himself into a comfy looking chair that sat caddy-corner to the couch.
They both drove off, smiling like idiots as they waved goodbye. Dean’s heart was full, but aching, as if a string between them was being stretched - and thinking about how slowly a week passes when what you want more than anything is at the end of it.
Sam came back from the store with beer and soda, greeting Dean and heading straight for the radio as he came in complaining that the Angels were already blowing a 3 run lead. Sam dropped the groceries on the table and found the game on the station.
Dean tried to breathe. This was crazy. He didn’t belong here. Cas was
“How?”
As if to emphasize the point, Dean straightened up, turned just enough to provide a view and bit his lower lip as he subtly slid his hands along both ends of the cue stick in a move that Sam could only describe as pornographic.
At Dean’s lack of response the doctor continued, “You were brought in after a Samaritan reported a possible overdose.”
That’s what he needed from Cas tonight
“I know Bobby….I will...Listen,” he continued, “is it okay if I take tomorrow off? Will you have enough help?”
he was even home...he probably knew it was on.
"I love
“So I guess this is goodbye then..” Cas said, his voice barely steady enough to choke out the words.
They found a Balthazar listed among the alum. Balthazar Sébastien. Dean pulled out the San Fran phone book and checked.
Dean gabbed tight to Cas’s arm as he leaned in pulling the angel closer, closing his eyes and resting his forehead on Cas’s.
“Talking to me is your ticket out.”
Maybe it was because he remembered now how Dean had always seen him, but suddenly Cas hardly recognized himself.
But then Dean had winked at him, and Cas thought that maybe
“I was just shaking my head at how lucky I am to be the one who gets to pull you out of that thing and see how good you look riding shotgun in my Impala.”
“Dean,” Sam asked hesitantly. “What do you want out of this? What if Cas doesn’t want to see you.”
Suddenly Cas was on his feet, angry. “What the fuck am
He struggled to control his emotions and added more softly, “Dean, go get some rest. I promise you we’ll talk tomorrow.”
“That one?”
“Hey Cas,” Dean said sleepily.
Castiel watched him from the couch.
Dean clearly wasn’t the only one to notice and he felt a jolt of possessiveness as some guy with David Cassidy hair and a trimmed mustache, wearing bell-bottom jeans, a vest and a long collared shirt was eyeing Cas up and down and moving in a little too close for Dean’s comfort.
“Hi Dean.”
“Dean….
Dean rubbed his hands on his temples and forced himself to breathe, counting like he’d been taught. Finally he moved, walking up to the desk, he stared blankly at the receptionist. The Brit was still talking to her.
“His brother...yes, he’s my brother.” he nodded.
“Look,” Dean started, “You called me. Don’t act like a dick. You left him!” Dean spat at Balthazar.
“It’s beautiful here,” Cas said, looking up at Dean. “How did you find this place?”
“Okay, you?” Dean felt like their every exchange was stilted… carefully measured.
Cas grabbed his hand and brought it to his lips, putting them chastely to his fingers. “I don’t deserve you,” Cas told him.
Cas moved his hand to cup Dean’s as he gripped his coffee mug, brushing his thumb over his knuckles. Dean let go and laced his fingers in Cas’s. They didn’t dare look at each other. Neither spoke, two pairs of eyes fixed on their interlocking hands. Cas lifted their entwined fingers to his lips, gently grazing the back of Dean’s hand, his eyes closed.
Dean stood up, his face desperate.
Dean was still beautiful beyond words but tiredness clung to him. Cas knew instinctively he’d never stop atoning for imagined sins. There was a caution now in Dean’s eyes that had never been there before the war.
“What…” Dean croaked the word, then cleared his throat and tried again, “What happened? What do you know?”
"So, what do you do at this infamous warehouse?"
“What?”
Cas strode purposefully over towards Dean. He realized the storm of emotions he was feeling must be written all over his face as Dean swallowed nervously as if bracing for impact.
option wasn’t on the table and Alfie shrugging his shoulders with a smile but continuing to dance alongside Castiel, making himself the other corner of their foursome. It got hazy after that, and after the haze was blank.
“Migraine with aura,” Dean told Sammy, “Apparently Bobby never had them before so we thought he might’ve been having a stroke.”
Cas could see from Dean’s guilt-stricken face that Balthazar was telling the truth.
“Balthazar what the fuck are you talking about? Where’s Cas?”
“It’s so good to just be able to talk to you,” Dean told him. “I was going out of my mind last night trying to reach you.”
His hands trembled as he held the photograph. Dean, bundled against the chill of November in his old Mackinaw coat, smiling at something in the distance. Cas had snapped it when he wasn’t looking.
“Rufus Turner, your caseworker. You’re on a 5150, Dean.”
**********
Dean laughed,
with fluffy crap like “Mrs. Castiel Novak” and “Gilda Novak'' and little hearts with your initials in them.” She stuck her finger down her throat. “BLECH!”
Cas turned to him. “That’s not true Dean. Sam cares, Jess cares, Bobby cares, even Rachel and Gabriel-”
“I was afraid of that. Cas-”
Cas grabbed his jacket and car keys, shut off the light on his way out, and closed the door on thoughts of Dean.
think you should be embarrassed about.” Cas glanced back briefly. “What do you remember?”
clutching at him in unexpected moments. Reminding him that the hole he'd tried to fill was bottomless. The patched up ground beneath his feet seeming firm, then breaking open again the way earth gives way to a heaving frost.
He’d been going through motions...existing. It was as if his life before had been the first act of a vivid and exciting play. Sometimes wonderful. Sometimes terrible, often dramatic,  always memorable. Balthazar was the intermission...the pause before the second act. Castiel felt now like he was about to be shoved back on stage. He was anxious for it in fact. The only question he couldn’t answer was whether this act would play out to be a comedy or tragedy. It twisted knots in his stomach.
“Open it and see.” Sam smiled, clearly he and Jess knew something about this.
Later Cas, beer in hand, grilled burgers and hotdogs on the deck as the children chased the last fireflies of summer. A warm September evening that would, in just hours, give way to a mild October, the smell of citronella candles wafting through the air. Hannah and Rachel chatted comfortably as the kids raced through the yard. The sun had just set, sending the world into a soft blue glow as the first stars appeared. It was a magic hour….“the gloaming” his mother used to call it. As it got darker, Hannah lit some lanterns around the deck and brought out sparklers for the kids left over from the Fourth of July. They played cards and talked and drank and enjoyed each other’s company late into the night.
Monday Evening
“Freaking suburbs,” Dean laughed, hugging the fresh sheet tighter around him and closing his eyes again. “And still...after that it seems like a good idea to you?”
“.......Hello Dean.”
“Cas,” he repeated, more breathlessly than he intended.
Dean considered him for a moment then mumbled “Sorry.”
Though the man was gentle with him, he heard his father’s voice in his head the whole time.
“You sayin you wanna be that for me Cas? Cause honest to god just knowing that’s gonna carry me through this week.”
“Cas is moving closer to Rachel,” Jess said excitedly.
“So this can’t be your first trip to this place.” Dean motioned to the cafe tables around them. “You seemed to know exactly where you were going.” Dean imagined him sitting with Balthazar, sipping wine and enjoying the romantic view.
Cas smiled back at Dean as he led the way onto the grounds of the Palace of Fine Arts. This was his favorite place in the city. When he first moved to San Francisco he and Balthazar had walked through the grounds one day and Cas’s imagination had run wild. Balthazar seemed unfazed. Maybe being from a country that had
each other. The story is about our choices and the commitment we apply to them to fulfill our desires. My father was a professor of classical literature at Howard University. Don’t try to argue with me on this one.”
"You don’t even have the decency to let me go on the spot because you’re short-staffed."
“Cas are you listening?” Dean was glancing over.
“Hello. Cassie’s told me so much about all of you.” Balthazar’s eyes moved charmingly from Jess to Sam, resting a moment longer on Dean in what might have been a thinly veiled challenge. Dean, who was almost
It was ringing. Cas thought to himself how stupid this was. What would he say after telling him about the movie? What if Dean blew Cas off? He wasn’t ready to let hope go. He should hang up.
Was it his present self that younger Dean sensed? Could time work like that? Was this moment the shadow that passed over him that day? Dean brought his hands to his head to rub away the confusion. His thoughts were only lucid now in waves, like the waves on the shore, the rest were bits of delusion and dream….the end gathering like the tide coming in. In those brief clear moments it hurt to think. It hurt to feel. Coming here was maybe a mistake, or maybe it was the punishment he deserved. Dean downed more pills.
Dean looked at it, then shook his head slightly.
Dean asked.
Silence….Dean didn’t have an answer.
“Aren’t you Charles’s other boy? The younger one?”
“When you’re not good for anything else, that's how you end up. You end up a whore. And that one's just trying to weasel her way into a better life.”
“You got it.”
Dean was back in the war.
he wanted to feel good. He just wanted Cas. Wanted to-
Cas's face was resolute, as he nodded. “You know you shouldn’t be riding home but fine.” Cas wavered, “Go home, get better...and then
Cas sucked in a breath. Coming back to his senses he let his fist uncurl, his arm dropping tiredly to his side, simultaneous waves of realization and remorse washing over him. A woeful sigh escaping.
“Thank you for calling and getting me out last night. The parts I remember were fun.” he smiled.
“All right then,” Benny nodded.
Cas rubbed a hand over his face to brush the sleep from his eyes.

Balthazar, hungry, looked in the cabinets for inspiration.“Hungry for takeout?” he asked, finding none.
Cas realized this would be the first holiday season in years that he wasn’t
The words took a moment to register.
On day thirty Dean was released. Fred came to pick Dean up and drive him back to Valens, a small town in the mountains just over the border of Oregon where he lived. Fred’s wife, Mildred, was waiting with a lunch of sandwiches and blueberry pie. She seemed overjoyed and charmed to host Dean, and Dean was all politeness and charm back, offering to clear the table and washing the lunch dishes, even singing along with her to a Patsy Cline album.
“Yeah Cas?”
Three days ago he tossed his dog tags and St. Michael medal into a gorge. Two days ago he sold his bike. This morning he sent most of the money home to Sam with a note that simply said “Goodbye Sammy. I know you’ll be alright.” The rest he used to pay the cab fare from the last town he stayed in to the shore. It took bribing the driver a fifty upfront, but a guaranteed fare was a fare so he agreed.  Dean didn’t want to be found, just forgotten. Soon he would sleep. He would finally have peace again. The pills and bottle he had in his pack from the last dive of a town he had hit would ensure it. Up front the driver changed the station, struggling to find a channel, settling on whatever came over clearly. Mick Jagger sang through a ghost of static.
“How is Benny?” Cas asked.
since Dean left him all those years ago. It was slow and chaste and gentle, and Dean’s lips were pliant beneath his. Cas felt them slowly part to make way for him and he ventured out to play at Dean’s lips and teeth just brushing the tip of Dean’s tongue with his own before pulling back into another, more innocent, kiss. Cas’s breath hitched as he savored the feel of those full fleshy lips one more time, knowing it might be the last time. Cas’s hand moved to the back of Dean’s head so he could pull him in close, brushing his cheek against Dean’s still too warm one.
Cas turned to look at her “I’m sorry Meg.” Turning to Dean, he paused considering. Cas looked exhausted, pained. “Let’s go,” he muttered finally, passing Dean and leading him out of the apartment.
“You got it. First thing.”
Benny let out a long sigh, nodding.  “You drinking?”
Cas got in the car and watched as Dean ran back into the vestibule of the apartment building and disappeared. He let out a deep breath. A worry stole into his heart for a moment over Sam and Jess. He cared for them both, and hoped it was just a temporary quarrel. Still, there was nothing he could do for either of them tonight, and Dean had Sammy in hand.
They moved completely as one, Dean’s lips and teeth grazing Cas’s neck as the music changed again. Cas reached his arm back to catch the back of Dean’s head with his hand, massaging his fingers through Dean’s hair in encouragement as he kissed a trail along his neck.  Cas melted into him, Dean’s arms gentle but firm around him, Dean’s lips relentless against his skin.
There was a long pause until finally he heard “Goodnight Dean,” followed by Cas’s footsteps making their way down the hall to his bedroom.
Cas’s eyebrows shot up as Dean handed him a small stuffed bear. It wore a tiny yellow hat shaped like the cap of a honey bottle.  A sweater that pictured a hive read “Let me Bee your Honeybear!”
“What? Am I under arrest or something?”
“Is that what you got going on now Crowley?” The man turned to confront him. “Cause stories ‘been going round about you too!”
Cas understood now how childishly naive they both had been.
Sam smiled and nodded goodbye. He told Jess, but he never brought it up to Dean. He figured he would wait until Dean was ready to talk about Cas.
Dean had held this one tightly, and kissed him, and had loved him, and loved him still. Dean backtracked quickly, just in case Cas hadn’t meant for this moment to be shared.
“Benny, this is my friend Castiel, his partner Balthazar,” Dean almost choked on the word ‘partner’ as Benny offered his hand to Cas and Balthazar respectively.
“I don’t understand,” Cas said, “For what?”
Mildred’s head peeked in.
“Can we go? Can we go now Cas?” Tommy jumped up and down excitedly.
Fred smiled as Dean turned to leave. “Dean,” he called out.
Dean sighed, "Good....good, you deserve that Cas...." Dean hesitated, "but um...Cas, the drugs-"
“Yeah? …..Good….uh...that’s good Cas.”
Dean exhaled, flushing pink, a smile pulling at his lips. He ran his hands along Castiel’s sides a few times affectionately before motioning him to sit and sliding up next to him. Dean pointed to the first container.
Dean awoke some hours later to the unpleasant sound of blinds being drawn and light shining in through the hospital room window. His head was full of fog. He couldn’t move his arms. He remembered the straps.
“Love you too!”
“Dean…..will you sit with me here?” Cas motioned to the sitting area near the tv, moving again only after Dean took a few steps in that direction, finally sitting on the edge of a chair next to the couch.
“...your’s too.” Dean choked, his heart swelling inside him.
“It’s Balthazar’s car,” he explained, shrugging. “So I would imagine it's in an airport parking lot somewhere.”
Dean went rigid mid-shot. Straightening up he flashed Sam a warning look.
It summed up the night so far. Both Dean and Benny looked around quizzically as nearly everyone in the room including Sam began snapping their fingers at her. Dean decided he liked the chick and her poems but suddenly hated the crowd as he watched Balthazar join in the snapping. Dean glanced over to see Cas laughing at his pinched expression, a smile on his face as Cas nudged him affectionately with his shoulder.
“Huh?” Cas glanced over.
Three days later Bobby called Dean into the office.
Cas noticed Dean’s eyes searching the passersby. “Hey Cas! That one there - that mean something or is it nothing?”
Unconvinced of her blamelessness, she smiled wanly and took the dish from his hands to bring it into the kitchen.
“Are you hungry? You should eat something.” Balthazar asked as they parked the car. “You didn’t touch the food they brought you. I can make you breakfast.”
Dean hated what came next. Hated himself for what he knew he was about to do. He just needed a moment, here - away from Cas’s sad and pleading eyes, to work himself up to it. Cas didn’t know...hadn’t a clue how rotted out he was inside. It would be for the best.
“See ya Cas.” Dean winked, earning a quick raise of the eyebrows as Cas’s eyes widened at him briefly, his lips parting slightly.
“So, pardon my saying it buddy but there’s no place to stay within a good distance, or eat for that matter. And you’re looking a bit stretched. Like maybe I can drop you at a motel and you can hit the beach tomorrow.”
He knew his voice had an edge to it. It couldn’t be helped. He was back to facing the cushions but heard Cas get up from the chair behind him.
people say without thinking. Dean was just being a polite conversationalist.
Dean glanced at Jess who subtly raised her palms in a ‘don’t-look-at-me’ gesture, her eyes darting sideways to Cas who was suddenly staring intently at the old cars on the side of the salvage yard, lips pressed into a tight line. Was that a flush on his cheeks? It was probably just Dean’s hopes getting the better of him but suddenly it was like a thousand bees were buzzing inside his chest. Cas had left Balthazar and had come to see
“As bad as I'm feeling now...what if I never find what I’m looking for...what if it never gets any better? I don’t know,” he said, shaking his head. “I told you it's stupid.”
, and I just thought, you know, the bigger the group the more conversation, the less weird it might be.”
Mildred cried but was also happy for him because she knew how much he missed his brother. She made him promise to visit and come up for dinner at least once every couple of months and Dean agreed, hugging her. He could never pass up her pie forever he teased.
"Clearly.." Dean flushed as he cleared his throat. "uh, clearly Cas anyone who thought that would be sorely mistaken."
us Cas.” Dean shook his head, “Face it, most people would feel just fine if we fell off the face of the earth. Hell, most people’d
Purifying if you will. It's an ancient concept.
Dean laughed at that, “alright guys - no getting all girly in here.”
Cas got up, wrote down the name and address of a diner, handed it to Dean, and sat back down. It was already nearing sunrise so they would meet at noon for coffee, allowing each other some much-needed sleep.
and something else...
Sam gave a quick nod to Dean as he glanced his way, letting him know Cas seemed okay. Tired but okay. Dean tried to keep his focus on the road for what seemed like an unending drive in rain and darkness. His eyes red-rimmed, his jaw tight, every muscle in his body tensed. The back seat was darkened but if Dean glanced in the rearview under passing lights he could barely make out Cas’s form in the shadows.
“Promise me you won’t work tomorrow?” Cas pleaded, “Promise me you’ll let yourself rest at least one more day?”
…..It’ll be good, for everyone.” Dean closed his eyes, shaking his head slightly as the words came out. Even as he said it he knew how full of shit all this must sound.
Cas had forgotten it was so close to Halloween. He got out and followed Dean through the stands of smaller pumpkins to the giant ones lined up along the ground nearer the cashier. Dean picked up a huge one and passed it to Cas, “Hold this.” Cas let out a grunt as the weight of it pulled on him. Dean grabbed two more, one under each arm and brought them to the cashier set up at a little outdoor table under a tree.
“I feel like the walls are closing in on me and I don’t even know who you are anymore! You don’t listen to me! You just expect me to fall in line with whatever you and Dean decide is best for everyone!” She yelled at him finally, throwing clothes in a suitcase and storming out, the engagement ring left on the kitchen table.
It sounded like she put a hand over the receiver because Cas could hear a muffled cry of “DEAN! Cas is on the phone!”
**********
He got up and went to the kitchen to wash some of the dishes that had accumulated since he woke up that morning. The window over the sink looked out onto the backyard of the home. His landlady’s kids were playing outside. Tommy, age seven, laid down on the grass and rolled himself down the hill while five-year-old Jenny chased a cabbage moth around the garden.
..thought you'd think I was crazy to say it." His breath came in little huffs as Dean kissed and nibbled and worked him with his tongue.
Lastly, in my head Hannah's twin brother looks like Hannah's male vessel from the show, with that same sweetness and same kind eyes. I think if he had lived and met Cas through Hannah, Will would have fallen head over heels in love with him. Maybe that would be nice to explore in another universe. In this universe, Cas and Dean are it for each other!
know that. Why?”
….” Dean started.
After taking care of business in town he came back to Fred and Mildred’s house and tried to reach Cas a few more times. Dean perked up when he finally got a busy signal. He hung up and called again immediately three times in a row, getting the busy signal each time.
“Let’s get out of here,” Cas said softly standing and guiding Dean up again with one hand on his bicep, another on the small of Dean’s back. Dean stood and followed Cas back to the car, looking back and forth between the driver’s and passenger’s side.
“Cas-”
Dean joked afterward grinning, pulling a laugh and a blush from Cas as he whispered
Cas looked through the TV guide and got up to change the channel to one that was showing a marathon of Abbott and Costello movies. They were just in time to catch the beginning of
“I still love you Ca-Cas...s’what I came here t-to s-s-say….I’m s-so sorry for what I s-said” he whispered through shuddered breaths.
“This whole car smells like you….or you smell like it,” Cas said, his eyes suddenly traveling from Dean to the seat beside him as he turned to take in more of Baby. “Like musk, and spices and leather. Jesus, it's…” Cas’s voice fell off, his eyes, closing as he inhaled.
He’d spoken with Jessica earlier and backed out of dinner at their place for the second time this month, fully prepared to be scolded by Sam for being antisocial when he found out. Lately though he found he had too many thoughts racing through his head. The only way he’d found to still them was to immerse himself in work, music, or outside of that, books.
He lowered his voice so Sam wouldn’t hear. “I’m so sorry Cas.” Dean’s eyes were pleading, “Can I see you again?”
“Dean!” Sam cupped Dean’s cheek with his hand, pulling his face up to look in his eyes. Dean was having trouble focusing.
Over Cas’s shoulder, Dean opened his eyes and saw Balthazar glancing over, waiting.
"Oh, you know me Cas. I'm fine." Dean laughed.
“No Dean, I don’t mean last night. I mean why,
Cas was already up and gone when Balthazar woke, but a note on the guest room door told him he had to stop in at work but he'd be home this afternoon and they would talk. All the better. It gave Balthazar time to steel himself -  to come to terms with it before he had to talk face to face.
Dean rode first to his apartment to shower and change, then straight to Sam and Jess’s place. It was getting close to dinner time and Jess offered to throw an extra hamburger or two on the grill for Dean. Dean realized he hadn’t eaten yet today so graciously accepted her offer, even though he had no appetite and wasn’t sure anything would stay down.
Hannah’s smile lit up her eyes. She chuckled, clearly trying to picture it.
Cas looked around as if realizing his surroundings for the first time. At Cas’s silence, Dean begged again… “
“It’s freezing in here,” Cas said.
Dean shook his head briefly, shifting his eyes to search the ceiling as if the answers were there somewhere. “And I kept thinking...you deserved better than what I did to you...I needed to tell you that, and I guess I just couldn’t wait anymore.” It wasn’t exactly a lie, Dean told himself. Just an omission of the whole. “In case...in case you needed to hear it. You know,” Dean regretted the words before they even finished forming on his lips, “for closure.”
“Yeah.” Cas smiled, relaxing a little at Dean’s appreciative comment. “Baskerville weather,” he mused.
Cas heard Dean arrive before he could see him. The rumble of Baby’s engine sounded a warning a full block away. Cas had tried to make himself relax and read something, but his attention kept drifting to the window in anticipation. He jumped up again to look upon hearing the growl of the Impala, unfamiliar on his street.
It was torture to step away from this...to move even an inch away from Dean’s body, but as time passed and the music changed again Cas wanted Dean to himself, away from the crowded dance floor. He brought his lips to Dean’s ear, this time to speak.
Dean practically shoved him into the truck and drove it to the nearest ER. After a few tests a doctor came out to let Dean know that Bobby was going to be just fine.
- the memory of Cas saying those words broke through his thoughts.
try again! Dean... it was just the fireworks!”
“You once said you wished you could take me dancing.” Dean forgot his earlier lack of enthusiasm for this choice of venue when he saw Cas’s lips part slightly in surprise.
“Fucked it up...I deserve to be hurting, not him..’’
You know I’ve never been good at writing letters, but lately it seems I’m no good at saying what I need to in person either. Yesterday, when you left there was so much I wanted to tell you, but I didn’t want to hurt you anymore than I already have and I couldn’t get the words out in time.
Eventually stepping away he shook his head as if waking from a daydream and presented Balthazar, “Jess, Sam, Dean, this is Balthazar.”
After coming out to Benny and the guys, hell, he figured
Dean’s face contorted in anguish, sobbing in an anxious breath. Putting down the parts he was working with and wiping his hands with a rag he went to the office to tell Bobby he was heading out for Sam’s place before grabbing his bike and taking off. Bobby had given him a worried “Okay son,” reminding him he could talk to him if he needed to. Dean thanked him.
“You see Dean, I know a little bit about where you’ve been, and I know what it can do to someone. I don’t think the issue is that you don’t feel. In fact, I’ve been reading the emotions all over your face since I walked in this room. I think the issue is you maybe feel too much. So much that you're tired of drowning in it. I could be wrong, I have been before. But we’ll have a chance now to figure that out.”
“Dean..”
Rufus facilitated. Dean spent the entire time slouched in his seat, trying, but failing to affect an air of nonchalance. His arms were folded defensively in front of him but at least, Rufus noted, he was listening.
“She was here earlier.”
“In the morning.” Cas interrupted. “I promise we’ll talk in the morning….I’m just so…I’m really
“Thank you for the pumpkins for the kids.” she motioned to the three Jack-o'lanterns now all lit up and sitting out on the porch -  one with an angry face, another with a scared looking expression, and one with a giant Jack-o-lantern grin.
Balthazar waited a minute and then..”Are you going to call him?”
“Yeah,” Cas said.
Dean meant to smile and say something, but it just
Cas opened his mouth but before he could say anything Michael spoke for him.
“I’m not kicking you out if that’s what you were thinking…..in fact I  figured that if your week was as shitty as I imagine it's been the least I can do is invite you for burgers and salads on the deck with me and the kids.”
“Please tell me we’re not gonna get lost Dean,” Cas chuckled but Dean heard real concern there.
The feeling of impending doom settled over Cas as he suddenly recognized the man as one of his father's old investment advisors who had been to their home several times. One of those astute financiers who prided themselves on always picking the next big ticket in the market and never forgetting a face.
He started to argue, but she fired a question back.
Mildred smiled sympathetically, “I don’t know Dean,” and it was the honest truth, “I just knew Sweetheart.”
The woman’s brow creased as she gave him a knowing look.
“I never got to kiss you goodbye,” he breathed, placing a soft kiss now on the back of Dean’s hand.
“Heh, - I don’t plan on being in here long enough. Whatever I need to do I’ll just do it. I want out.”
Also - Dean's suggestive body language in the pool hall was inspired by a particular gif floating around Twitter. Good on you if you find it! 🔥😜
Cas stopped, then turned.
Dean’s head swam, drunk with the longing in Cas’s eyes. He’d had plenty of conquests who’d looked at him desiringly, but this was different. This was some strange measure of love, sincerity, and desire blended together that answered his own perfectly. He and Cas belonged together like thunder and lightning. One without the other, incomplete, searching, unsatisfied -  together they made sense, and would make the heavens tremble.
“He never calls here. But if he does I’ll tell him.”
Dean felt like he needed to say something more. He wanted to ask if it was the same for Cas - that music was different now. He wanted to know if there was any way possible, any chance he'd ever be able to listen again - to the songs that painted colors and scenes in his mind - swirls of green upon blue. He wished he could take an album from its tattered paper sleeve, gently place the needle, and let it play while Cas held him and whispered it would all be okay again. But no words came.
Dean sat up as Mildred made her way over to a dresser in the guest bedroom and pulled out a Bible, flipping through and sitting at the bottom of Dean’s bed as if about to read him a bedtime story.
Jess smiled warmly. “Welcome home Dean.”
“Charlie, tell me I didn’t do anything stupid.” She stared for a moment confused. “Why is Alfie here?”
The slam of a car door in another part of the lot snapped them both back to the reality of where they were.  Dean pushed himself up to a sitting position, urging Cas up with him, his right arm stretching around his shoulders, his left holding Cas's hand as he snuggled in next to him. It was getting late and Dean would need to take the long drive back to the shop. Cas for his part heading back to his place to change for an evening shift at the warehouse where the holiday uptick had already begun.
“Good!” Fred nodded, ignoring the tremor in Dean’s voice the way he knew Dean would want him to. “Bout time. Get Mildred home would you? Let a tired old man get some sleep,” he winked.
Cas went back to the chair, cradling a pillow between his bent arm and cheek in the hopes of getting some sleep. He only had hours before he needed to get up and go to work himself. He was pretty sure Dean would be okay on his own during Cas’s shift, reasoning he would have been so if he were at his own apartment. He toyed with the idea of calling in sick, but Dean was right, and it was very likely Cas would end up getting whatever Dean had himself and need the time off, despite following most of the protocols they stressed in pre-Med for caring for the sick. This wasn’t just any sick person after all. It was Dean, and he deserved every extra touch and caress as Cas felt for fever, brushed the damp hair from his brow, and soothed him from his troubled dreams.
“You want a drink or something?”
It felt odd to Dean, talking so casually with a stranger about Cas. He and Cas were used to having to downplay or outright hide everything except from Sam, Jess, and Bobby, and of course the small group of people he’d met in the course of his treatment. But then again Hanna knew about Cas, and she’d stuck up for him. She clearly knew what Dean’s deal was. Dean figured,
“That was a long time ago,” Cas said simply, in a way that made Dean’s heart ache with a physical pain.
You better stay on your toes or I just might let him steal me away!” Mildred flirted harmlessly. Dean might have actually blushed.
“You didn’t tell him then did you?” Balthazar looked pleased with himself as Cas looked questioningly back to Dean.
“I can’t do this,” he said, “I need to get away for a few days.”
Cas excusing himself to run to the restroom gave Dean a chance to exhale. He ran a napkin over his face. Cas looked so perfectly at ease, and Dean was afraid that he must look like a nervous, sweaty mess. He took several deep breaths, letting them out slowly while mentally coaching himself that they were doing fine.
“Sammy and I found it once when we were trying to hide out from my old man. We come here every now and then to swim when it's hot out. It’s kind of a special place to me. I wanted to share it with you.”
“One more thing,” Balthazar said. He told him about Meg. How Meg crashed from place to place but had a shady dealer named Marv and where he was likely to be.
already been.” Cas told Dean, “Wait here though while I call us a cab.” Cas mentioned he had seen a payphone near the sandwich truck around the corner. Dean should finish his beer and he’d be right back.
“Let’s go with the boxer I guess. Or whichever you want.” Dean didn’t really care, as long as it was with Cas.
Occasionally Dean would find a side job to work but, with the bar and Bobby’s shop closed, Sundays were usually lazy days that he and Cas could spend together however they wanted. Since Cas made most of their dinners during the week while Dean worked, Dean had gotten used to the ritual of making breakfast for himself and Cas on Sundays.
Dean nodded silently. Getting up to leave he laid the makeshift ice pack on the kitchen counter on his way to the door. That’s when he saw it. He paused.
Roman ruins scattered across the countryside made the experience blase and cheap, but Cas enjoyed the quiet beauty of the place.
Cas realized it probably
**********
The poem in this chapter is "When You Come" by Maya Angelou
Dean had really died in Vietnam, and just some shell, some bodysnatcher, had returned in his place.
Cas found his throat too tight for words. Dean noticed his silence and stiffened as he realized why.
“Dad!”
Sam noticed the guy in question had not so subtly come outside to have a smoke, even though smoking inside the hall was perfectly normal.
“Yeah...please don’t hang up. If you do hear from him, can you give him my number?”
Cas wanted to throw up.
“Dean,” Cas whispered.
“Goodnight Cassie,” he said finally.
“Good,” Cas’s voice was soft, pleased. Dean closed his eyes again.
“The timing of everything really sucks….but yeah...I guess I will.” Dean sighed. “Really wanna be there for you too though.”
Dean had promised, driven mad with need and kissing him desperately,
“Okay Dean,” Cas said. After another awkward silence, “I should get going to work now.”
Dean had an early shift at the garage. He was back home around 4 PM and was taking extra time in the shower, enjoying the warmth of the spray as it pounded against his back and shoulders. Showers always felt better at this time of day, when there were fewer tenants home to strain the limited hot water supply. He could hear the phone ringing in the next room but ignored it. Whoever it was could call back.
“Ah.” Rufus nodded. “Odysseus was a warrior, a hero in the Trojan Wars in ancient times,” he bent to pick up the remnant of a chair leg, tossing it in the garbage. “The Odyssey is the story of his journey home... and for that matter the story of every warrior from ancient Greece to World War I to Vietnam.”
“Hey wait up brother!” Benny said, jumping up to join him.
Dean felt the very least he owed Cas now, was to not complicate his life any further. So he was trying, and maybe he was even getting better at trying to build back a life for himself. Pushing away the darkness the war left inside him, moment by moment. A dinner with Sam, a song with Jess, a slice of pie and coffee with Fred and Mildred, a conversation with Bobby while his hands moved expertly over metal and grease to fix what was broken. These and other moments, each like a rung on a ladder. Dean used them to climb out of his darkness and closer to the world everyone else seemed to be living in - closer to the person he used to be.
Dean shook his head, eyes cast downward.
He asked Cas how things were with his sister. Cas felt his own face beam a smile as he talked about her, telling Dean how they got together at least once each week for dinner, or to just hang out. She was dating someone pretty seriously. Rachel had seemed anxious for her big brother’s “seal of approval.” Stephen seemed like a nice guy.
Dean huffed,“You’re gonna try to freaking tell me that love conquers all.”
“Dean?”
“I’m going to look for him right now! Where else is he likely to be?....
“Yeah...tell me again about yesterday Dean. I know you did already but humor me. Start at the beginning and give me everything you remember. I mean
to believe that
“There’s nothing much to tell,” Cas said.
***********
“Yeah, okay.” Dean smiled. He knew Sam would feel better about leaving him if he made sure he ate something first, so he allowed it. Dean had grown up taking care of Sammy, now it seemed Sam was always taking care of Dean.
“Thanks Fred.” Dean said before  Fred turned and left, “for everything.”
He left his bedroom now and padded over to the percolator in the kitchen area to brew some coffee for himself.
“The doctors are in with him now. They’re doing everything they can,” Missouri escorted him to a seat near the desk and grabbed him a cup of water before taking her place back behind the counter. Dean cleaned the coffee he had spilled and then took a seat nearer Balthazar. He pressed his hands against his thighs to keep them from shaking.
“I miss you Dean.”
Dean’s mouth curved into a delirious grin, “You looked meow-gical tonight.” He burst into a laughter that shook his head and chest, erupting into a coughing fit.
“I didn’t think there were clubs like this outside of San Francisco,” Cas said.
They were slowly making their way towards Baby when Jessica pulled in the lot. Sam turned to his brother, pulling him unexpectedly into a hug.
Dean felt like he was being punched in the chest. He knew all of this. He fucking
one!” Dean protested when Jess showed him the chords to California Dreaming.
Dean at first answered that things were good, then told Cas the latest about Jess and Sam. Jess had decided she wanted to put off getting married for now to go back to school to finish her bachelor's degree. Sam didn’t understand why she couldn’t do both but ultimately was just finally glad he knew what had been bothering her.
“Goodbye Cas,” he said finally.
“STOP!” Cas yelled from across the field but it was lost in the noise.
“Goodnight Hannah.” Cas smiled.
Alone in the ward lounge, Dean sipped on his now lukewarm coffee wishing it was hot. A few minutes passed and Dean heard a small commotion down one of the halls of the ward. It was the opposite direction from Fred’s room, still, Dean found it unsettling. He wished Garth was still here. Dean didn’t like sitting alone in this place. He was anxious.
felt amazing...it felt
“Cas, did you buy those pumpkins?”
to deserve Dean abandoning him and breaking his heart.
“Next time you come up…why don’t you bring your friend Cas with you? Mildred and I would like to meet him if you’ll let us.”
Dean’s breath caught and he sighed in relief. He wasn’t stealing anything, he was welcomed...Cas was welcoming Dean with the tiniest caress.
He suddenly realized he couldn’t remember the last time he made breakfast for himself on a weekend. Somehow going through the effort of cooking breakfast for ‘one’ didn’t seem worth it. Something about the hollow clanging of pans and utensils just made his heart ache. He realized that made no sense since he still made himself sandwiches for lunch and cooked himself dinners, but he had no stomach anymore for eggs or toast or anything served up in the severe stillness of a voiceless weekend morning.
In his head Dean heard himself saying the words he most wanted to say again to Cas.
“Yeah, Dean...keep telling yourself that.”
The money at the club was so much better than Cas had expected. Not the hourly pay of course, but the tips left by bluebloods out to impress their friends and clientele.
“Okay….okay thanks.” Dean said, “Bye.”
“ummm...Dean,” Dean perked up...hopeful. “Dean Winchester.”
“You’re a dick Dean,” Cas teased back, over the sound of continued laughter, too busy glowing inside from Dean’s easy banter to really mean it. “You know that right?” Cas smiled and
“I’ve got you sweetheart,” Dean panted, his own eyelids heavy and pupils dark. “Fuck my hand Cas!”
Maybe Gabriel was right and Dean was just looking to score with an old friend. Maybe Cas shouldn’t have been so quick to jump back into sex. Dean seemed to barely know his own mind, how could he be ready for any kind of relationship again?
“I could eat,” Cas laughed. “Maybe we should clean up first though.”
Dean’s fingers slowed and he stopped playing, but he didn’t look up. Casting his glance at the floor as he put Jess’s guitar to the side, he raked his hands over his face once more before looking at Sam, the words finally coming.
“This isn’t about a date!” Dean said. Jesus poor Cas, and this was supposedly the
He looked up at the others. Gabriel’s eyebrow arched. Rachel was beaming back at him.
As if that wasn’t bad enough,
Dean reached his hand to touch Cas's hair, slowly weaving his fingers through it - tousled and thick and chestnut brown. Dean brushed a stray lock from Cas's forehead,
“I appreciate it man. So how about you? Things are great you said?”
She sat up, “Hey!”
There was no way Dean was going to talk about it now. Yeah, he knew people were there for him but he was goddamn sick of people treating him like he was made of glass and might shatter at any second. Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn’t. All Dean knew was it wouldn’t help to hear himself bitch about it. At this point it only made him feel worse. If he
“Uh...no thank you.”
“July 2nd, 1976! The day Balthazar told me you called!”
Cas grinned, entertained by the shock on Dean’s face, “Dean, how the hell do you
Dean suddenly remembered what he’d meant to give to Cas was still down in a small leather bag strapped to his motorcycle in the garage. It would be stupid to leave it now, but stupid to keep it as well. He crept down the stairs and as quietly as possible, lifted the door into the garage to go in and grabbed it from the bag on his motorcycle, hoping the whole time there’d be no “Neighborhood Watch” on this street to wonder about him and hassle him this time of night.
Cas let out a breath and slumped back in relief, but only for a second before he sprang back into action searching for his shoes and keys. Charlie helped him locate both.
“Oh...I see. That’s good….wonderful.” he nodded.
“Okay...thanks. Is there a number I can reach him at?”
“Wasn’t...still isn’t. And now,
Cas obeyed, looking up at him through thick lashes, Dean's finger in Cas's mouth where his cock should be. Cas watched, wide-eyed as he sucked and licked and worked Dean's finger like he was tasting God.
Dean gave Benny a look that told him he most certainly could blame himself.
If not for their last encounter, Cas would be smiling, ebullient, overjoyed at the surprise. As it was his heart started racing but he couldn’t put a pin in his emotions. Longing, frustration, and to his own surprise
That was what he told himself at least when he repeated the horrible scene in his mind. He pushed away the thought that it was Mary’s and Sam’s presence that held him in place, staring helplessly as Cas lay dying, unable to close the distance for fear of their eyes on them both. Jesus, he was such a fuck up. He pushed the thought away again.
“I know how much I must have hurt you.” Dean said.
Sam didn’t answer but looking over his shoulder Dean could see Sam pouring two mugs. He brought them over and sat in a chair alongside Dean, setting the cups on the coffee table.
This time before Cas could return to the kitchen the manager pulled him aside.
Still looking up at Cas from where he fell to the floor, Dean pleaded “Cas, let's get out of here......Come away from this place.”
Rufus considered that for a moment, cocking his head slightly at Dean.
The older man’s lips pressed into a firm line. He nodded to Dean through the rearview and they continued in silence.
Dean let the smile drop from his face. “Don’t you worry about Mildred though Fred. Or about anything for that matter. Garth and I are gonna make sure she’s all set this weekend for you to come home to, and after you get some rest we’ll all have a late Thanksgiving together. The only condition is that you and Mildred don’t lift a finger.”
Even though this is an AU, I think the level of self-hatred and blame Dean experiences is pretty canon. Dean may think he is back at square one, but he isn’t. All of the inner work Dean has done hasn’t left him, but he needs to be reminded. I promise you he will be. Also, for the record M80’s were used in military sims and as a firework banned in the 70’s because of their danger but they're still afloat. They are much louder than cherry bombs and firecrackers and you can feel the blast if close enough. Thank you for reading so far!
He put it down again, “love him so goddamn much,” he mumbled.
Cas wrapped his arms and legs around him, kissing his lips, his cheek, his neck - any part of Dean within reach that he could worship with his lips - the words “I love you...I love you.. I love you..” sprinkled like rain between them.
Dean followed silently as Cas hurried out into the street. It was chilly, even though it was summer, the moisture rolling in off the ocean like a cold sweat. Cas crossed his arms to rub away the chill. In the light of the street lamps Dean could see that Cas seemed to be struggling to focus, squinting his eyes, blinking. He was on something, and even though he seemed to be thinking more clearly than he had a few moments ago, whatever it was, was still having an effect. He looked down the street and then in the other direction as if not sure where he was, before finally turning right and walking with purpose.
A hopeful smile settled on Dean’s face, his glassy eyes gazing at Cas.
Shhhhhhhhh….the nurse soothed as Dean was pushed back into the bed, his arms strapped down as the doctor nodded to the orderly.. Within less than a minute Dean gave in, whatever they shot him with worked quickly. This wasn’t worth it right now, he decided. He was tired. He could slip out once these assholes were focused elsewhere. After he found some clothes that is. Dean drifted off to sleep, thankfully this time, one without dreams.
Charlie checked her watch. “I have to get going sweetie! I love the new place. See you tomorrow at the club?”
Retreating to just beyond the cafe’s seating area he waited, and Cas, rounding the corner seconds later joined him.
to think of Dean - to try to be thankful for what he had. He thought he had been doing well, but clearly not well enough if a brief mistaken identity could derail him so thoroughly. He couldn’t go home and smile at Balthazar and pretend things were fine with the ghost of Dean in his head. He would erase it. He needed a diversion.
Dean narrowed his eyes and shook his head slightly “I don’t sing…’sides that doesn’t even make any sense! You don’t forgive someone and
Dean glanced over, running his eyes along a line from Cas's face down his arms and torso.
Cas huffed a laugh scoffing, “You were driving like a maniac,” his face fell into a smile, his thumb brushing over Dean’s knuckles as their eyes rested a moment in each other's gaze. “But I long since realized it was for exactly that purpose, and I enjoyed every minute of it.”
“Gabriel this isn’t about Dean!” Cas spat, dropping the knife on the cutting board. “We’re not Duma and you!”
Dean used the payphone in the waiting room of the ER to let Sam know that Bobby would be okay.
A  relieved laugh burst out of Cas as he rubbed the tension out of his face.
In fact, Cas had done everything
“Heh. That was Scooby Doo,” Cas said. “That’s it?”
, Cas, ....exactly as you are," and then...almost a whisper, "
“Whiskey,” Dean said.
“You said
“Don’t you even dare!” Cas faced him fiercely, keeping his voice low so as not to upset Rachel in the next room. “Dean was there for me when
“Excuse me,” he said to the others getting up to join him.
There was another awkward silence as Cas waded through Dean’s words searching for sound footing, every phrase from Dean’s mouth seemed to send out a hundred vibrant tendrils of possible significance and purpose. Which one was true? Which meaning should he cling to and water and nourish?
The windows of the Impala were completely fogged up but outside the rain had stopped, removing some of their cover, and a sliver of sunlight beckoned through the otherwise dark sky.
The door to Cas’s bedroom was cracked open. Dean hadn’t intended to eavesdrop, but heard Cas clearly talking about him and couldn’t help it.
The sincerity in her voice made Cas thankful the conversation was happening over the phone as he wiped fresh tears from his eyes, his heart aching over the loss, all over again.
He walked away, climbing into the car with Benny and rubbed his forehead with his palm to brush away the fatigue. As Benny drove away Dean leaned his head against the window.
Cas quickly sat up looking around him. He was in Charlie's apartment, but the form on the loveseat wasn’t Charlie.
“What did he say to you?” Cas interrupted.
“What do you feel?” Cas asked Dean.
“Careful Jess - I’m filthy.” She adjusted herself to Dean’s left, side to avoid getting motor oil on her clothes, but squeezed tight just the same. Cas stood back, with a tentative, but warm smile that softened his eyes.
He looked down at his hands suddenly, afraid that maybe he’d been too blunt - that maybe Cas would think him too pushy or too damn naive, but he couldn’t help it. That’s what it was. Dean was in love. He was never more certain of anything in his life. It didn’t matter that it was only three weeks. He
The woman on stage left the piano and a man announced open mic time. Anyone could come up on stage to perform. The piano, a pair of guitars, a drum kit, a bass and several microphones were set up for common use.
How had Dean gaged it all wrong? He knew that the fever and exhaustion was messing with his mind and probably his emotions but Dean had really thought, really believed, that he and Cas were connecting. Despite the circumstances Dean had to admit that this was sadly one of the best afternoons in his life in recent memory, that the other best afternoons in recent memory had all been ones with Cas. But Cas clearly didn’t feel the same way.
“Christ Cas! Is that what you call it? ‘Saying goodbye?’ You were practically purring in his lap. I thought the next act would be you bending over the table for us all to watch you beg for his cock!”
Did this mean Cas was in this
, Dean meant. He was rethinking his choice to relay the number rather than just let Rachel call Cas herself. “I kind of called every Novak I could find asking about you...you know, after the hospital happened.”
hurled like ‘spectral evidence’ in a witch trial. Well, Cas refused to burn.
“Come on Jenny!” Tommy pulled at his sister’s hand as he led her up the lawn.
actually. It sounds to me like you know deep inside you’re
He added more softly,
“I’d have taken you to Oakland for a real game but that would make your drive home a lot longer and I know you’ve got Andrea waiting.” Dean told Benny as they shook hands in the parking lot at the end of the game.
“No.”
Cas’s eyes narrowed at that. “I care about
His thoughts returned to Cas.
Cas led Balthazar by the hand back to the table and sat. They joked and talked a while longer until Sam and Jess mentioned that they needed to start heading home. It wasn’t that late, but they had a long drive back to Sacramento. Dean was going to ride with Benny in his car back to Dean’s place, and they all agreed that this was “nice'' and they should do it again. Dean, Balthazar and certainly Benny knew this was just a pleasant fiction to end the night on.
**********
he told himself. He chewed his bottom lip smiling
Cas shrugged. Exhaling, he closed his eyes before looking up at her. He knew she was right, but his life lately had this ‘urgent’ feel to it ever since....well,
Dean! Look I know something happened because we’ve never had to organize a freaking search party for you...not since -” Sam cut himself off.
Dean blanked for a second. He just wanted to overhear what the man was saying.  “Uh...I spilled coffee,” he said finally, his lungs still struggling to ease his breath into a natural rhythm. “Um....do you have some napkins?”  The nurse tore off some paper towels for Dean.
Cas was pissed now. “You don’t understand what I went through when he left. I never said goodbye. He never gave me the chance to say goodbye.”
Over the past few weeks however, Cas remembered how much he really
Undeterred, Dean told Cas excitedly about the 67 Impala, as they hopped on the Powell -Hyde line back towards Union Square. Dean described the sad state “she” was in when Bobby found her. The tension between them was gone as Cas relaxed and attentively listened. Cas could care less about cars, but he smiled and felt happy seeing Dean practically glow as he detailed the work he was lovingly putting in to restore “her” beauty.
Cas explained that the car “gripped” a cable that was constantly moving underground, the driver releasing the car’s grip as they got close to each stop. They jumped off at the wharf and Cas led Dean down a side street.
“Mmmm” Rufus nodded in agreement. “Well Mr. Winchester... Dean, over the next 72 hours we’re going to be seeing a lot of one another..”
Penelope saw the man through the differences Dean. Yet she made a
I want you to be free to find what you need in life, even if it’s not me. I want more than anything for you to be happy. You deserve to be happy Dean. Whatever it takes to make that happen, I will be okay with that. I wish that for you.
Dean smiled and drove off, leaving Sam, cheeks flushing, to awkwardly nod at
Dean nearly choked on his drink. “Wow, - okay, and the yellow one over there?”
Dean's shoulders fell. He shook his head. “My fault,” he choked out finally, coughing to clear his throat. Turning away towards the path that led them in.
“Okay….well help yourself to anything you want, and come get me if you need anything.”
Cas laughed then, “One day I look out the front window and Mrs. Green, that's his wife, is running and waving her hands in the air around her head. Some bees flew into her hair and she had so much hair spray in there they couldn’t get out.” Dean was smiling now as Cas’s face was lit up with amusement. “So next thing he’s puffing on his cigar and blowing smoke into her hair. Smoke does something to them, calms them or stuns them or something.”
Cas hugged Balthazar before turning in, laying a kiss on his temple. He really was grateful for their friendship. But it was time for Cas to step out on his own and they both knew it.
“It’s temporary,” he told her about the hours and the workload. “I’m doing this for us,” he would tell her about the drive to establish himself in the firm as a valuable partner. But there was always another project, always another late night, always more coke. The firm specialized in environmental law, but Sam soon realized that most of their clients were on the opposite end of where he wanted to be.

“Not really,” Dean said shaking his head.
"You've always been...so beautiful Dean. Hasn't changed."
“Cas, let me take you home,”  he jerked his head back, signaling him to climb on behind him. A humorless laugh escaped Cas as Dean looked at him expectantly.
Once on the road Cas pulled out a map he had folded in his back pocket and directed Dean to the highway. Dean pressed the gas and Cas felt himself pleasantly pulled back into the seat by the power of the engine.
“Move over! Make room!” Benny said as he wedged another chair between Sam and Dean. The comfortable distance that he and Castiel had enjoyed was suddenly less so, as Dean’s knee brushed Cas’s and they both pulled away startled, actually tensing their muscles now to keep from intruding on each other’s space.
him stable?
“Sure,..okay...Thanks Cas,” Dean nodded nervously back at him.
He took a drag from his cigarette, wondering when it was he finally knew. Wondering when the moment was that he’d just started to play the game with himself. In truth, he knew it was long before Dean had ever made that call. Cas had been lost to him for a while. Balthazar was sure Cas loved him, but not in the way he needed him to. They were both just pretending. Staving off the inevitable.
Castiel was a trigger for him then he would become one through association. He thought about how best to make Dean understand.
But this? Closure on the most important thing he’d ever had in his life? What Dean was offering now was a double-edged sword. Closure meant that he could finally stop worrying whether or not Dean was safe, but it also meant he’d need to stop hoping they could ever be together again. To make peace with it.
Cas was shaken.
Dean’s mind started racing so fast he couldn’t keep up. A million thoughts and emotions swirled around him at once like papers dropped on a windy day, escaping just out of reach before he could focus. Dean fought to push down his panic long enough to snatch at one.
So yeah, he’d told Pamela - the only person Dean could really ever point to as a kind of parental support besides that short but happy time with Darlene, was Bobby. He was like a father to Sam and Dean. And then Fred had come along, and Mildred. Fred who had literally saved his life, and Mildred with her loving heart and her warmth sweeter than any of the delicious pies she always made sure to make Dean when he visited.
“You cold Dean? You can go inside.” Hannah offered.
“Keep it.” Dean yelled back.
Cas opened his eyes, heavy-lidded, shifting the cant of his head to look at Dean. Dean recognized that look. Cas was aroused. He wanted him. Dean was sure of it.
“Well...uh...I’m at work now..as you know,” Dean fumbled for words. “..But if you ever want to get together….or just..just talk, you can call me at home.” Dean quickly realized how that might sound. “Not as a date I mean.”
“What about you Dean?
“I could teach you!” he blurted, feeling stupid as soon as he said it. It’s not like they lived near each other. It wasn’t like they would start hanging out. The last thing Cas needed was Dean hovering eagerly, looking for reasons to distract and disrupt his life. But Dean’s breath caught in his throat and he felt a flush on his cheeks when Cas chuckled telling him, “I think I would rather just come and watch you somewhere.”
. If only he could make something like come true for Cas.
She moved a blue silk ribbon from another page and placed it to mark the passage.
“In terms of his heart, he was lucky.” Dr. Inias sat on Mildred’s other side calmly delivering the news. “Your husband mentioned he took aspirin for some mild chest pains earlier in the evening. That probably helped to  lessen the severity of the heart attack. He’ll need to make some dietary changes, go to a cardiologist for regular check ups and get on a suitable exercise regimen, but we’re pretty sure if he does what the doctors order he’ll be able to go back to regular activities soon.”
“Oh..” it came out small and sad. He swallowed against the lump that was building in his tightening throat.
Everything went red, his ears rang, his stomach lurched at the acrid smell.
Still...things were left unsaid. Every unspoken truth and sentiment, a fresh cut as it echoed in his mind. As painful as it was, as deficient as Cas was certain the words would be, he put pen to paper.
Benny paused as he looked around the circle at the thoughtful faces of the men considering his words, some gazing back with rapt attention, others with their eyes focused off in the distance as if considering their own “endless night.” Dean’s eyes were focused on Benny his forearms resting on his legs, leaning in to the story. Benny smiled, this was after all for Dean.
“Cas!” Sam called as Dean poured his second cup.
Cas chuckled, smiling at her, “Well you can see how well that worked out for her.” He'd forgotten about that. He'd turned her down but when the buzz about it got back to Gabriel and he'd teased Cas about it at dinner their father insisted Cas go. The Faes were 'society' in his words. Cas was pretty sure the real reason his father insisted was to somehow prove to himself his son was a 'normal' red-blooded male. "Anyway, it was just a school dance. Wasn't like a real date or anything."
