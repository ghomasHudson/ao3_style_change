The invention of Jeremy Marcus proved easy enough, using a combination of his own personal traits combined with the ones of a criminal element they had caught wind off six months ago by the name of James Moriarty.
to be the one seeking my attention this evening before I read the name on the card properly. But wrong brother it seems.”
“You misinterpret what I’m trying to tell you. We did all participate in the same game, I just made a few precautions, as life has a way of not arranging itself to the plotting of humans. Victor Trevor was always going to be a loose cannon for example, safety measures needed to be made in case of his meddling. After having spent a considerable amount of time in his presence yesterday I knew the state he was in, it was only a matter of time before he was going to interfere in some way. And considering that he had your gun in his possession…”
It was the unexpected fact that a snake was slithered across Dr Roylott’s chest and had its fangs buried in the man’s throat that made John’s eyes widen in shock, just staring, unable to either move or react.
And he wasn’t going to, as long as Dr Roylott remained where he was, howling in pain on the floor, his hands clasping around the new wound.
He took the remaining steps into the room until he was standing close enough to reach out and touch if he wanted to.
It still grated him though that he had been caught with food in his mouth, taking advantage of the offerings of the buffet. It humanised him in a way that he had no wish to expose to others, friends nor enemies. It made him appear  too
“As much as I detest the idea of being confronted by Magnussen at this early hour and under such horrible circumstances, there is still nothing I can do to prevent you if that is really what you intend to do, even if I highly doubt Mr Magnussen’s willingness to be used as some sort of weapon to be whipped out whenever convenient. At the end of the day, it still won’t get you access to Sherlock. Do you really think I would be here if I was allowed to be by his side?”
The other guests were scattered a little all over the house which consisted of three stories but as John didn’t know any of them and had not been greeted by anyone he paced from room to room, hoping to catch sight of Sherlock, or at least Mycroft so he had one familiar person to connect with.
John stared hard at him, preventing himself at the last moment from clenching his fists. Was this a thinly veiled taunt?
Considering John Watson’s strong attachment to his patient and the way he had left his assignment in the middle of the night, not to return again, there was a big chance that there was something to be exploited if he managed to figure out what the situation actually was all about.
“Ah, but there can be something fascinating to be gained from darkness as well, I think,” he said and tilted his head to look at the painting more closely as if reading something from it that only he was able to see. “Life is after all often tainted by a touch of darkness rather than just consisting of eternal sunshine and the scent of roses.”
And John can actually relate, he knows the magnetic pull of Sherlock Holmes at first hand so he considers it fully plausible that a man in charge of watching Sherlock through a camera all day sooner or later will either lose his marbles completely or simply fall under the spell of the allure that is the mercurial personality of the consulting detective.
So, instead of firing off the childish response he usually resorted to when confronted by his brother, he decided to agree with what he was saying, if only for appearances sake.
Sherlock looked very handsome in a black slim-fit suit and a white shirt underneath, naturally with the top button undone to expose his pale slender neck rising from the collar, and his dark curls seemed more tamed than they usually were, a vision in black contrasting beautifully against the paleness of his skin.
” had apparently done it’s work this time and he had not allowed himself to get occupied by thoughts of Sherlock when hunger and sleep was already taking up the majority of his thought process.
With a scream of anguish that he scarcely recognised as his own voice, a name escaped his lips as his legs continued to run towards what awaited him by the end of the corridor, fearing that it was simply all too late.
If he hadn’t been so accomplished with telling this particular lie he would not have added it, Magnussen was a disturbingly well reader of character, he could sense other people’s weaknesses almost as well as Mycroft could and it was a dangerous path to go down and even more so to be caught in a web of lies, especially of this particular character. But it felt necessary to be distancing himself from Sherlock, it wouldn’t serve their purposes if they appeared to be close, it could rouse Magnussen’s suspicions as to the nature of Sherlock’s intentions.
And as if transferred back to that first meeting in Mycroft’s office a few months ago, John felt his hackles rise at the sight of the other man and his condescending demeanour. As if ingrained in his backbone, all the resentment he felt made him on edge and he stubbornly remained where he was, a good distance away from the table and the offered tea.
Outside, the storm was increasing in force, and lightning was now crossing the night sky in an intricate pattern while it rumbled ominously in the background. Mycroft felt the familiar uneasiness unfurl inside of him and he felt a strong wish to follow his brother through the library door to wherever he was heading.
Nimbly Sherlock jumped up on the back of the sofa once more, put the cuffs around his wrists and then let go of the solid surface from beneath his feet by pushing away from the sofa, now dangling in free air by his wrists, naked from the waist up, his trouser hanging low on his hips, the fist button unopened enticingly.
John downed the contents of his glass in one go, earning him a disapproving glance from Mycroft, but beyond that nothing more happened.
“Ah, yes, I recall now. Sherlock took it all rather well considering the circumstances. He was rude to the bloke of course but he wasn’t as scathing as I would have expected him to be.”
In a rare moment of physical contact between them Mycroft reached out and grabbed his brother’s chin so he was forced to meet his eyes when he spoke.
No one had questioned him about it afterwards, so he was fairly sure no report had been written down by any of his superiors at work. In fact, beyond Freddie and the ambulance crew, it had felt like the whole experience had gone by rather unnoticed, not a single person had mentioned anything about it and he wasn’t even sure that anyone was aware that it had happened, even if the presence of an ambulance must have made some sort of impact in a place like that,  considering how well-equipped it was with the high gates and the surveillance cameras.
Well, Sherlock wasn’t here to see him do it, so resolutely Mycroft stepped over to his nightstand and pulled out the charger from the socket in the wall next to it.
He turned his head towards Mycroft who looked as if he had swallowed a lemon and his smile increased even further.
“That all sounds very interesting, Sherlock, but what I want to know is, do you think the vault is in London or at Appledore, how are we going to get access to it and how do we move along from here, as you clearly didn’t fulfil what you were supposed to do last night.”
When Sherlock then lost consciousness and remained that way despite every effort to make him wake up, John feared that all would be lost, that Sherlock would actually die right there in front of them.
Mycroft knew all about discretion and how to act according to it, as John was well aware of, so this was decidedly a carefully arranged tactic.
And as there was no way John was going to accept such a taunting without retaliation he had grabbed his lover firmly by the arms and pushed him forcefully against a book case in  the library before devouring his mouth with a passionate kiss.
“Fine, I won’t press you for an explanation,” the voice on the other end concluded. “I merely called to make sure that you got home properly. And to express my concerns about dear Sherlock’s lack of spirit this evening. Is he coming down with something?”
Mycroft had a few dark secrets and pressure points, even if deeply buried and well-hidden. He would fall hard from grace if faced with the threat of exposure, not to mention the greatest pressure point of all standing right in front of him this very moment, squirming uncomfortably in front of the mirror and surprisingly unwilling to go along with the plan his older brother had come up with. Despite the plan being uncomplicated and almost laughable in its simplicity.
The obvious answer would of course be Mycroft but at the same time it seems unlikely because what would he have to hide?
Sherlock gave him a glimpse of that half-smile again before he turned on his heel and began to walk towards the house.
“Why are you standing there like a spectre, ogling at me?” came a familiar if somewhat raspy voice from the bed and Mycroft took a few steps forward, letting his usual mask of distant complacency fall back into place.
That nutty old lady that insisted that she was only renting out her flat to them but almost bent herself backwards in her efforts to help them, well,
John couldn’t help but stare despite himself, the green fabric against that pale naked skin and the ebony curls made him look like some exotic creature asking to be worshipped, but Sherlock apparently had some sense of privacy  after all as his fingers deftly tightened the knot and then strode away the corridor towards the stairs, the dressing gown still flapping around his retreating figure, the hint of his body visible through the thin fabric. He was clearly not wearing any pants.
At the time John had thought that it had been because of him being in there, shaving, but Mycroft usually never bothers with John, never seeks out his opinion or company, never cares for his presence.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed even further, becoming mere slits of darkness in his pale face, but he remained quiet and John continued unperturbed, as he slowly rose from the chair.
He closed his eyes while bracing himself and then allowed his mouth to widen as a second finger was inserted between his glistening lips.
Instead he felt almost tetchy and short-tempered which was unusual for him. Perhaps it would get better once he knew that Sherlock was going to act the part he had been instructed to play.
He hadn’t bowed down like he suspected a lot of people did to someone like Victor who felt himself entitled to that sort of behaviour, but he had also allowed Victor’s words to get to him and it annoyed him that it had worked.
The use of the bathroom, the only place where a person can get any sort of privacy by locking the door without it seeming suspicious presents the perfect opportunity to remove something from there while John, as an additional advantage, was getting dressed upstairs.
It took another agonisingly slow 30 seconds before he actually opened his eyes and blinked a few times to focus his sight on his surroundings and the person standing in front of him.
The fact that Victor held an invisible dagger constantly pressed to his fiancé’s throat in the form of his blackmailing threat seemed to be of no consequence to him.
But as the car headed towards the high-security research laboratories his shoulders slumped and he continued towards his own area of the building instead.
“Give me two hours. I can go back, collect my items, give this some final thought and then I’ll let you know of my decision.”
John thought about Sherlock’s living arrangement as they were right now, the sealed windows, the high gates, the house that felt more like a confinement than an actual home. When you put the added health exams and the STD tests into the equation it felt more or less like a gilded cage, but perhaps that was Mycroft’s idea of perfectly controlled protection.
It was one of those left-over wreckages with a leaking roof, broken windows, standing more crooked than straight, hidden behind some trees in a small grove, abandoned a long time ago and apparently the perfect place for a clandestine meeting with your lover turned schemer, a good five kilometres from John’s workplace.
To summarize things, the whole situation naturally caught both me and Mycroft by shock and then despair when we realised the trap we were actually caught in.
He should have focused on his future employment at the research facility and not allowed himself to be distracted by carnal desire and Sherlock’s magnetism.
After a day spent playing the part of the worried brother, Mycroft was exhausted, not to mention annoyed, so if he came off a bit harsh now, he had reasons to feel that way. So even if it was a bit bothersome that Magnussen wanted to act this quickly and strangely enough without any proof of evidence from Watson, it was still satisfying to realise that this could soon be over if things went according to plan.
Sherlock was the constant cause for concern, throwing himself into tricky situations without a second thought, while Mycroft was the one ready with a mop and a bucket to clean up the mess afterwards every time. If John didn’t know the pleasure Mycroft derived from having Sherlock under his relentless control, he might have felt sorry for him, for both of them really. As it was now, they deserved each other.
Sherlock had already figured this out but it still made his stomach churn uncomfortably when hearing it spoken out loud.
The figure on the bed stirs slightly but his eyes remain closed and will continue to do so for at least a few hours which means that Mycroft has plenty of time to observe.
Dr Roylott was standing on the threshold to the entrance when car came to a stop and did not step forward to greet them as they got out of the car.
“I need Narcan to stave off the effect of an overdose. If we work from the very loosely based theory that it is morphine it could work,” he said instead. “We have no way of testing if it actually is morphine that he has taken but since you refuse to take him to a hospital that’s the best option we have right now. I don’t know how we are going to get our hands on any Narcan at this hour though.”
So better to remove Sherlock instead and let John Watson become the person left behind, ceaselessly searching for his lost friend, unable to ever figure out the true answer to his flatmate’s mysterious disappearance.
The idea of talking about his budding feelings of affection for Sherlock to his even more emotionally constipated older brother doesn’t sit well with him though.
“Naturally. I always need to take precautions when it comes to Sherlock. His safety is my main concern. Believe me when I say that my men are professionals, they hardly care about the comings and goings of an ex-army doctor.”
John rose from the sofa and began to pace the room while trying to wrap his head around the unexpected deceit he was suddenly facing. It was clear that fury was the dominating emotion occupying his thoughts right now, but at the same time he was still baffled about the reason for Sherlock’s actions against him.
He could think of only a few people interested in looking for him anyway and with the exception of Mycroft, the others did not have the capacity to figure out what had happened to him. This particular scenario would prove to be difficult even for his brother. Mycroft had a lot of intel and resources at his disposal but lacked the imagination required to see something like this playing out. It was too outlandish for someone of his pragmatic way of thinking.
After one quick look at the writhing man on the floor, he went for the door and left the room, positioning himself with his back against the door as a barrier.
John Watson was hardly a skilled manipulator and also a terrible liar, while Magnussen was a man operating on the highest level imaginable when it came to playing mind games with people.
There was that strange combination of delicacy and frailness combined with hauteur and magnificence that was absolutely irresistible. John had always had a thing for posh boys as well as tall, dark and handsome ones and this man was certainly ticking in all of his preferences.
“And yet I think sleep is just what you need, Doctor,” Mycroft’s voice was heard from somewhere in the background, the man himself no longer fully visible for John to focus on, as if fading into obscurity despite a lamp shining quite strongly in the room.
“Are you going to release me or are you actually planning to break my arm?” he whined and John couldn’t help but feel a touch of satisfaction, having Sherlock down on his knees, forced to submit to his mercy.
Still, Mycroft figured it was worth the effort to ask him to join them if it meant getting rid of Magnussen. Magnussen was hardly going to tolerate the presence of Dr Watson and would therefore likely suggest moving in different vehicles.
“That’s not what....” John began but quickly turned silent when the ominous sound of a click from the trigger was heard.
Mycroft snorted and took a large helping from the offered terrine while he allowed his brother’s childish taunts to wash off him. After a few minutes of silent chewing he turned back to the topic of John Watson again.
Besides, aggravating Victor now, while still holding the gun, would be a very unwise move, despite his temporarily distracted state.
“Well, don’t,” John effectively cut him off. “If I were you, I would not open up that particular can of worms right now, you still need my help with Magnussen after all. Didn’t Mycroft ever tell you not to aggravate those who are trying to help you?”
“So don’t even consider indulging in something extra just for the sake of effect. A little bit of poor lighting, perhaps some make up and your own acting skills should suffice this time.”
As soon as they stopped in front of the house he got out of the car, not bothering to wait for her to catch up before he threw the front door open and rushed inside.
A second later a second shot roused him out of his shock and he ran towards the door, his heart hammering in his chest as panic was rising and a million horrible images flashed through his mind as he ran through the corridor to reach the place where he knew that the shots had been fired.
“I think someone made sure I got my fair share of sedatives anyway,” John grumbled but Mycroft remained unphased by the thinly veiled accusation.
“Oh, not to worry, Mr Holmes, I think he will see things from my point of view from now on. I sent him a little incentive to help him make up his mind. In fact, I was actually expecting
Facing the empty space on the wall where the painting had previously been hanging, he suddenly caught sight of something completely unexpected and as if struck by a sharp jolt of electricity, his heart made a startling leap and his eyes widened as he stared at what had been hidden behind that painting all along.
“I must confess that I was surprised to see them. How did you find out that my brother had been admitted to hospital?”
And from then on, things had been great, all misgivings about romantic commitment thrown out the window and fully enjoyed by both parties, even if some aspects of being in a relationship still confused and slightly bothered him.
That had been the lay of the land on the evening when Sherlock disappeared and also the reason why John subconsciously had not sought out Sherlock’s company after returning from work.
Sherlock snorted at that but refrained from answering, which was unusual for him, so Mycroft took another few steps forward to take a closer look at him.
Meanwhile the woman, who during the ride had been mostly glued to her phone and spurned any efforts John had tried at starting up a conversation, now opened up the front door and disappeared inside, forcing him to get out of the car and hurry after her if he didn’t want to be left behind.
“Endless.....” Sherlock admitted, still almost childishly giving that teasing half-smile that made his eyes glimmer with mirth. He looked very young and unguarded for a second and John felt something twitch inside him, but then told himself no.....
A scar across his shoulder, as well as a limp that occasionally made itself known but no longer constantly caused him pain, were the remnants he still carried upon his body as reminders of what he had been through. But other than that, he felt more or less like himself again as he looked into the mirror and a sense of gratification made itself known as he realised this.
He could concede that his brother had made an interesting observation last night regarding Magnussen’s mysterious visitor and such information could perhaps be useful in the long run, but he was not the main focus right now and could, if necessarily be dealt with later, depending on his importance and relevance to Mycroft. This thing with Magnussen on the other hand, could not be left hanging and neither could the situation be allowed to turn into some idiotic attempt at playing  detective and create a mystery that perhaps even wasn't one to begin with, when so much else was at stake. Just for the sake of stroking his little brother’s ego.
Holmes and that Mycroft Holmes is part of the rescue team. Two of the greatest minds John has ever encountered, and yet completely helpless in the face of recent events. Whoever this Jeremy Marcus is, he has them completely beaten.
Charles Magnussen had meanwhile made his way over to the head of the table and now inspected the foursome seated on each side of him, his eyes running from Mycroft to John, then across the table to Sherlock and finally Victor, and John suddenly got the distinct feeling that everyone else around that table were only there as extras, a part of the tableau presented but of no interest or value to anyone.
Deciding that it was too early for such childish games, Mycroft’s tone took on a firmer tone when he didn’t get a reply.
“Sounds like a loser if you ask me. My sister had a similar experience awhile back, a bloke who seemed like the genuine deal and then turned cold from one day to the next. Maybe it was the same one? What did you say yours looked like?”
“I also assume it would upset your parents if he decided to kill you,” John concluded as he kept his eyes on the other man to see his reaction.
“That’s not necessary...” Mycroft began, seeing full well that the content wasn’t anything he was going to enjoy. But Magnussen put a finger on three of the more detailed ones and pushed them forward towards Mycroft who couldn’t look away, despite his reluctance to see this.
wasn’t. And I have something to add to the subject as well. I believe there was a point being made regarding the distinction of fact and fantasy last time we spoke about this. I feel like I have spent a sufficient amount of time in your fantasy world, with you pulling the strings and making all kinds of terrible decisions, not only to the pain of others but to yourself as well....”
“If this is about his newly discovered deplorable habits, I have no wish to talk about them, Mr Magnussen.”
And yet, here I am, apparently making a complete fool of myself and definitely complicating a disastrous situation even further by pouring my heart out in this manner. But as it seems I’m already too deep into this emotional calamity of my own making, I thought diving even further down the trenches couldn’t possibly cause me any more harm than my actions already have.”
When delivering these last words his voice actually hitches a little bit and even if such a reaction would be completely normal in a sibling who has just been reached with the news that his younger brother has been abducted, by a secret service agent no less, it still strikes John how odd it is to see Mycroft like this. Quite frankly he didn’t think the man had it in him to show emotions of any kind, happy nor sad.
Too late for that, there was only the option of surviving the onslaught of conflicting feelings that this person had the bad taste of provoking in him every once in a while, and then ride it out, every damn time.
Or he could decline the offer, go back to the barrack and continue with his work as if this had never happened, principles intact but most likely wondering how it would have been if he had accepted the offer after all. He would not be worse off if he declined but as he was a man who secretly thrived when things were unexpected and exciting, he would probably end up regretting his decision sooner or later.
“Excellent. Now I won’t hold you any longer from your duties.  I’ll see you tomorrow at seven, Dr Watson.”
A firm right hook hit the butler straight in the jaw, causing the man to stumble backwards from the sheer force of it, which left John with enough leverage to deliver a well-aimed kick to his groin which caused the servant to stagger down on his knees in pain.
It was also equally strange that Mycroft had omitted to include any information about the man in the file John had been given.
What Sherlock told him sounded like a poor little boy who had been very lonely growing up and had longed for companionship without knowing how to achieve it.
“You were wonderful you know, doctor. I would really like to do this again, if you would be amenable to it.”
The detail that pulled him out of this assumption was the fact that the bell strap was actually moving out of its own accord and was distinctly progressing closer towards him.
“So what do you suggest we do to achieve that?” he asked despite his misgivings about Sherlock’s suggestion, his hand trailing along the sliver of smooth exposed skin across the chest where the dressing gown had created an opening between the panels.
So Mycroft simply continued to look at his visitor until Magnussen stepped closer, and seated himself in the chair on the other side of the desk. The chair where those who came for guidance or punishment usually ended up sitting. Mycroft suspected that Magnussen wasn’t looking for either of those though.
“For no other reason than to make sure that the situation is perfectly clear for all parties concerned. I know that Sherlock might present a temptation to those who see him, which is understandable, as he is an exceptionally beautiful man after all. Jealousy though, is unfortunately a personality trait of mine, so when I see a potential threat that needs to be put straight I take it upon myself to do so.”
Now, let’s continue talking about Magnussen and what’s expected of you the next time you see him, as well as the time you’ll hopefully get invited to his house. Mycroft wants me back at the house soon enough and after tonight, the game is afoot. So this is it, whatever we need to tell each other needs to be said tonight.
Victor Trevor was one of those men Magnussen in reality despised without letting that fact get in the way of conducting business with him.
He is about to close the door once more when John takes a step forward, his hand up in a preventive gesture.
Deciding that there wasn’t much he could do about the situation at the moment, he went to work as usual to get on with his day as he normally would, hoping that he would hear from Sherlock eventually. In the meantime there was always that issue with Pemberton to deal with while waiting for his brother to cool off. He wasn’t going to embarrass himself any further by making any calls that would only go unanswered.
Sometimes this relationship business felt like trying to navigate through quagmire, every other step threatening to give way under his foot.
The image of Sherlock, walking towards him across the garden in his white shirt and those soft dark curls framing his unique features, lingered in his thoughts as his muscles ached from exhaustion and he wiped away sweat from his forehead, but beyond that small diversion he mainly focused on his task and put in as much effort as he always did while working. It was strange to consider that he had been doing something completely different not that many hours ago.
John weighed the riding crop in his hand before he allowed it to cut the air between them with a swishing sound. He liked the way the movement made Sherlock’s eyes follow his hand like a mesmerised cat.
A silence stretched out and the finger on the intercom button lingered for a second with hesitancy, as if refusing entrance was still optional.
The sight of the stark red against the deadly pallor of Sherlock’s skin somehow got through to John’s angered haze and he stepped back to prevent himself from going any further.
Right now, Mycroft actually looks like he might be caring just a little bit after all, but unfortunately, he remains uncommunicative.
He leaned back in his chair and intertwined his hands over his belly in a complacent manner, as if already sure of John’s acceptance which in turn made John certain that what he had told Mycroft about the incident had not exactly been news to him.
“What else could it be? You mentioned yourself that it was something related to your former profession and it’s obviously something you cherish enough not to want to dispose of, despite the unfortunate ending to your career as an army doctor. You don’t strike me as a particularly sentimental person but this has some value to you, so my guess is that it’s a medical bag either gifted to you from a family member or relative or even possibly a heirloom you don't want to get rid off even if its presence pained you enough to decide to put it away in a self- storage.“
With the one exception currently lying in that hospital bed in front of him who had somehow wormed his way into the decidedly small core pumping out blood to his system and put up residence there while the logical part of Mycroft’s brain screamed at him about the foolery of letting anyone gain access to something as intimate as his heart.
He blinked several times, as if woken from a deep and heavy slumber, his head not fully capable of properly grasping the situation. But then he slowly rose from his bed, his heart increasingly pounding rapidly inside his chest as he straightened his back and stepped out through the door, ready to face whatever was waiting for him outside.
“What exactly is it that you are suggesting, Mr Trevor?” he said through gritted teeth, no longer bothering to hide his discomfort over the nature of Victor’s words.
It was Magnussen who, like a true sexual predator, had wormed his way into Sherlock’s bed, time and time again, taking advantage of the situation in the most despicable way imaginable.
And with that he turned his back and hurried after the others while John returned to his own group, drank the water he had intended to have and then returned to finish off what he had started before it was time to quit work for the day.
“I must admit that I didn’t think you would be able to pull it off. Too many unknown factors to take into consideration, the doctor’s temper certainly being one of those unpredictable elements. You should have seen him in the car the other day, he was positively spitting with venom towards me.”
Not willing to drop the subject, feeling as if Sherlock was treating it too lightly, John stepped up to him.
But more importantly it meant that John couldn’t do so either. Unless he turned to Mycroft for help. That man had infinitely more resources at his disposal of course, and wasn’t that a tempting thought?
He tilted his head slightly before he spoke, not completely unlike the way a reptile would, with a jerky movement that made him seem more resembling animal form than a human.
His eyes fell on the fire poker and for the second time this evening he grabbed it in a firm hold before he rushed to the door, barging at it with all his might against the wooden frame.
While talking, Magnussen had moved towards him the whole time and was now standing almost uncomfortably close. John wondered if the other man would be able to notice the panic he was experiencing beneath the calm surface he was trying to convey.
Mycroft was seldom to be seen as he was either away working or locked up in his office. On those particular occasions they had to be careful and John had initially not wanted to do anything while he was still under the same roof as them.
Sometimes he got caught, like the time he had apparently decided to break into Mr Rudd’s office and had been brought out of there kicking and screaming by a furious Mycroft, dragging him by his shirt. Sherlock had not been very old back then, not even out of his teenage years if some of the men around the table were to be believed, and he had been high as a kite as well.
And yet he would never had wished for his annoying little brother to end up chained to such a deranged man as Victor Trevor.
Sherlock was probably right when he said that Mycroft was envious of his physique, who wouldn’t be? Sherlock was the most beautiful man John had ever seen so no wonder if Mycroft felt the occasional pang of envy when standing next to his younger brother. Comparisons were bound to be made by others and sibling rivalry could be such a poisonous thing, as John very well knew from experience. So he took Sherlock’s advice and waived Mycroft’s ominous words from his mind instead.
“Well. The reason why I know he isn’t with Magnussen is because the man himself told me so. Together we have managed to come up with a clue though, and even if I normally wouldn’t bother chasing after my brother on one of his hairbrained schemes, I had to consider that Magnussen is now a more active participant in this game than what we initially realised, and he also is very interested in locating Sherlock now that he knows a little more about where he went tonight, so I might think it is in our best interest to join him. “
“We can’t all survive on air and nicotine like you do,” he hissed sharply in reply and removed a crumb of chèvre from the corner of his mouth. He wasn’t going to deny himself just because his little brother was in a fretful mood. Food was after all one of the few enjoyments to be had from events like these.
“We’re leaving in fifteen minutes. By then I expect you to be ready and prepared for the evening, not a word out of line and at your best behaviour. John, we’ll see you at the venue. Your car will be here any minute now so I suggest you head downstairs to wait and leave my brother to finish preparing.”
Otherwise John would be a constant wreck of nerves considering how often they end up in dangerous scenarios.
It was difficult to tell as he was standing silhouetted with the light from inside coming from behind him, but there was something about his stance that told John that the man seemed very suspicious towards this unexpected disturbance of his evening.
Mycroft had always been prone to slight nausea whenever traveling by air, one of the reasons why he seldom travelled if avoided, and adding these particular circumstance into the mix, he was beginning to feel like this might well be one of the worst nights experienced since Sherlock decided to stop using drugs.
“I didn’t bring anything for the simple reason that I was hired yesterday evening and the only thing I have left from my medical days is packed away in a self-storage in Hounslow. But I can check for vitals all the same, take notes of some basic information and then make sure to be better equipped the next time.”
It could be such innocent details as a message brought to Sherlock from a servant that originated from the other man, or a vase of flowers where a card of affectionate phrases was still visible among the stems.
Sherlock stretched his body, exposing his naked backside for a moment and it was difficult to tell if he was trying to cause a diversion for John’s mounting annoyance or if he truly didn’t realise why going to lunch with another man would annoy his lover.
“...no need to stop....” Sherlock purred and with that approval John tore away the beige coverlet and pushed the younger man with some force down on the bed before he climbed up on top of him while fumbling with the zipper of his trousers.
This morgnings behaviour was a somewhat tiresome side to Sherlock’s already difficult personality, this flare for being dramatic and throwing tantrums, a side that Mycroft had some trouble appreciating but had learned to handle at least fifty percent of the time. The other fifty percent of the time, he despaired and felt like he wanted to rip out what remained of his already thinning hair. It this was such a moment, depended solely on the development in the next couple of hours and what his brother decided to do next.
“Indeed. Welcome to my house, Dr Watson. My name is Charles Magnussen, the host for the evening. I hope you’re looking forward to celebrate the union of the happy couple with us tonight?”
“Hardly. The idea of sitting permanently glued to an office chair is not exactly an alluring prospect. At the moment I’m idling away as my brother would say, trying to find something worthy to occupy my time.”
“But there was a sound? I don’t think those type of weapons usually…” John began but was interrupted by a hand impatiently waiving at his slow-wittedness.
He took a deep breath to fill his lungs and then released the air slowly, wiped the image of the dying man and the snake from his inner sight, as well as that of Sherlock's unconscious body carried away by his older brother, and pulled his phone up again and continued to call Mycroft every other minute until he heard noises from downstairs and realised that the backup team had finally arrived.
But this was hitting far too close to home for comfort and he couldn’t help but feel the twitch of his resolve as it began to crumble, all kinds of murderous thoughts surfacing at the sight of the smirking man in front of him, with his hands on the provocative photos of Mycroft's little brother.
Despite the difficulty to see his eyes properly, John could sense that Sherlock looked resigned when he answered.
“I can’t promise that Mycroft will be persuaded to go along with what you’re suggesting but I’ll ask him if he might consider another solution. It isn’t likely, we have already discussed other options before. But for you, I’ll at least raise the question. But what he decides upon is final.”
Sherlock had nothing underneath his dressing gown, Mycroft was well aware, despite the fact that it was too dark to truly see.
John could feel himself squirm as he heard his rival utter words that could just as easily have come from his own lips and revealed a closeness between the couple that he resented. He was very tempted to take a sneak peek of the man, just to see what he looked like.
As he rose from his chair, his umbrella still in a firm hold in his hand, he asked Sherlock to accompany him downstairs.
He then turned towards John and nodded, his features showing no sign of the harsh words he had just uttered.
The man is as elusive as the fictional Jeremy Marcus and an expert at leaving no traces behind, and no one has ever managed to put a face on him, being more like a menacing presence than a physical man.
Mycroft reached for a piece of the sliced-up cake and put it on his plate next to his teacup. He didn’t take a bite though, merely gave John a sharp look.
“Oh. Where to?” Mycroft feigned a curiosity he wasnt really feeling. His brother always tended to be more dramatic than any occasion required and the situation was surely no different tonight.
Mycroft swallowed the barb, it wasn’t harsh enough to bother with retaliation. He found himself too mellow at the moment and he had other worries on his mind.
Angrily he slammed the door shut in his wake and began to walk towards the busier streets in search for a vacant taxi, leaving Magnussen, Victor, Mycroft and Sherlock to enjoy the rest of the evening without his company.
“Yes, he seems to be experiencing some aversion to his bedroom,” John mumbled before he realised what he had said.
At this day and age, with surveillance at every corner, DNA data bases and people unable to move without leaving any sort of trace, physical or technological, it was quite an impressive feat. Maybe it helped that he seemed to be living the life of a Victorian recluse out here in the wilderness where no one seemed interested in looking too closely at the doings of an obvious eccentric.
“To modify weapons? To plan for every possible eventuality in advance? My brother really has been secretive about my occupation it seems. It doesn’t matter. Suffice to say, I have the staff and resources to make things like that happen, the less you know about it the better.”
The doctor sounded slightly out of breath when Mycroft picked up the call and when he almost whispered that he was currently back at the barrack, stalling for time, Mycroft easily realised that in order to get some privacy to make the call, the doctor must have made the effort to sneak away from his cohabitants that most likely were not sleeping yet, perhaps even by using the bathroom window to climb out at the back.
Mycroft froze where he stood, despite his best effort not to let it show, a cold grip forming around his heart.
Cruel to the bone considering how upset the woman still seemed to be about it and knowing from personal experience what it was like to stare into those magnetic eyes Sherlock had, falling hard for what he was offering, blind to his lies, John felt a sudden surge of anger on her behalf even if the reason behind the deceit had been a valid effort at breaking free from Magnussen’s shackles.
In another desperate effort, perhaps to get away from Magnussen’s prying questions as well trying to get out, Dr Roylott stormed towards the door one more time. But like previously to no avail.
“If you wouldn’t mind I have some questions as well that I would like to ask, after the examination.”
Rather unkempt, cracks in the walls, a very worn carpet, somewhat murky and open spaces with a huge flight of stairs leading up to a gaping darkness on the second floor, indistinguishable from where they were standing.
There was an outstretched silence where he kept looking at his brother and Sherlock stubbornly continued to ignore him by keeping his eyes closed as if pretending to have fallen asleep.
“No, he was too caught up in his own emotional turmoil, he is still under the impression that my brother and Charles Magnussen are dead and we have so far not informed him of the truth. It is to our benefit if he keeps believing that he is a murderer. My men led him away quickly enough and he is apparently still suffering some sort of shock. He doesn’t even remember that
He will also need to make the obligatory phone call to John Watson to inform him that no news has surfaced today either.
As he turned to look at them more closely he noticed that they all looked surprisingly generic, as if having taken advice from Mycroft on how to not make too much of an impression, the most remarkable person around the table was without a doubt Sherlock and  the rest made it look like they were trying to blend in with the background.
He merely noted that time was indeed upon them now, either this went their way or this was likely the last time he would hear from John Watson.
It shouldn’t really have surprised him. Magnussen dealt with information, if he wanted to know something, he made sure to get it. And Sherlock was a normal civilian, his number wasn’t classified the way Mycroft’s was for example, the number was even posted on that website Sherlock occasionally decided to dedicate his time to. So it had probably not been too difficult to attain it, even if he found it slightly laughable picturing Magnussen sitting in front of his computer looking at a website that prided itself with a thesis on 243 different types of tobacco ash. Even John, who loved Sherlock dearly, had not made it past the first ten categories.
Inside his own room he wipes his face clean on a discarded towel left on a chair and heads for his wardrobe to pick out a warm jumper as the weather outside is rather bleak.
“Yes,” Sherlock answered in a hollow tone that John didn’t know what to make of. “So get your clothes on and then leave, I’ll go out to stall him while you get yourself in order.”
It had been a necessary argument though, unlike a lot of the others they got themselves involved with. Sherlock needed to realise some fundamental rules and the consequences of breaking them and even if Mycroft realised that it had not been an appreciated lesson he knew it had to be done.
But the dilemma of Sherlock’s sudden departure from the scene was a troublesome throwback and something he needed to take a closer look at.
Never so much as a hint of dirt under the nails unlike his own long elegant ones who often appeared stained by some sort of chemical or nicotine. He should know this as he had spent a whole hour once, contemplating as well analysing the differences between their hands, so efficiently telling the story of their owner just by the way they looked.
And when I realised that you actually were not coming back, I knew I had to do something, despite going against every logical instinct that should have prevented me from seeking you out.
“Dr Stamford, yes,” he said, a glimmer of hope beginning to bloom inside his chest. Not that he was unhappy with his current position, but something more in line with his former field of expertise as well as better salary could improve his life in all kinds of areas. It was certainly a tempting thought.
“Dr Roylott was entirely too calm for someone accused of hiding a person under his roof. As if he wasn’t in a particular hurry to get back to his prisoner. He wasn’t faced by the fact that I thought he had my brother here at first, but the moment I approached the subject of his connection to Magnussen and what I suspected was an enterprise of a criminal nature....well you saw it yourself, he grew angry within seconds. After that, everything I said just aggravated him even further.”
He opened the door into the room with the tip of his umbrella, reluctant to touch things if not strictly necessary. He had harboured feelings of aversion towards hospitals ever since he had been young and a five-year-old Sherlock had been admitted on account of a severe case of meningitis. That had been the first time he had looked down upon his brother lying in a hospital bed and feared that he would never get out of it again.
“No. I decided not to as I knew Magnussen would want to reach out to you when hearing of your resignation. I thought it would be better if you still thought I was using drugs, on account of your poor acting skills. I wanted for him to believe you. He might not have done so if you had tried lying to him, you’re not a very good actor.”
With a last lingering look at the door of the bedroom where Magnussen was by now most likely doing the most vile things imaginable to Sherlock, John opened a door to his right and pushed the unconscious butler inside, then slammed the door shut and turned on his heel and ran straight back to the room where the offensive painting was hanging, tauntingly on display for everyone to see.
He despised how ineloquent he sounded, he very seldom felt this out of his depth, always being the man with a well-hatched plan prepared for every eventuality. But this was a matter he wasn’t used to deal with. The ridiculousness of the baser emotions of humans, such as jealousy, and pride, scorned feelings and rejection made him feel completely out of his element and it only resulted in him growing even angrier with Sherlock for dropping such a mess in his lap to deal with.
It was tempting to reach out and prevent him from leaving, demand some answers, but considering that his brother was continually keeping tabs on his movements, as per usual, it wouldn’t do to be caught creating a scene out in public. So Sherlock decided to let the man leave for now. He had other ways of contacting him later and instead he turned with the parcel still in his hand and closed the door behind him to shut out any prying eyes or surveillance cameras.
The presence of Mycroft’s agents rummaging through the flat looking for clues must have spooked Mrs Hudson though and he feels a bit guilty for not taking the time himself to explain what’s going on, but right now, when everything that matters to him has been taken from him, he just can’t.
“Nice to hear that I’m so easily replaceable.....” his mind immediately catching on to the picture of Mycroft snapping his fingers to produce a new doctor, someone more willing to do his bidding. Maybe someone more willing to look through his fingers about other things as well.
While clenching his teeth to prevent him from crying out in agony, trashing against his confines, he desperately wondered how long until he drew his last breath.
Recognising the level of alcohol in his system as well as the lack of a letter knife, he tore into the envelope quite forcefully to retrieve the letter inside and then raised it to his eyes to read what the short and succinct message was trying to tell him.
“I have decided to hire him as your private physician for the final couple of months before the wedding. It was the least I could do to reward him.”
And with that he removed his hands from the mess that John had managed to inflict on them as well as over his own trousers, then elegantly he retrieved a handkerchief that was left discarded on his desk and wiped his hands clean before he let it fall to the floor, not offering it to John who remained standing uncomfortably damp and cold between his legs.
John’s brain came online, bit by bit, and remembering the previous night, he found himself mildly surprised that Sherlock was even there.
He smiled. “I used my knowledge of chemistry for profit instead of problem-solving, but the recent sugar shortage put my business in jeopardy, just when I had almost realised enough profits to complete the purchase of this place. I hope you will join me here when we retire, Watson, and I hope you will forgive my subterfuge. I was looking for sugar amongst the most likely places in the East End. When I learned there was none to be found, I had to go abroad. I was successful. Business resumed. This cottage is ours, if you’ll have me. What say you?”
Nothing is so ferocious as a sailor’s appetite when he’s finally home. After I’d washed the remnants of Captain Basil from my form, I was seated across from Watson, tucking into the most toothsome steak and oyster pie I’d ever tasted without so much as a pause for speech. He was eating, too, but more slowly and with undisguised regard for me.
Kate sighed in a way she hoped was reassuring and soothing and sweet, but more was beyond her. She was already gone, floating on a candy floss cloud.
At a familiar corner, she halted abruptly, as if an invisible arm was flung cross her chest. She looked about cautiously, though not a car was on the road.
Said garment was flicked up to expose Sherlock’s bare bottom, which had just commenced to be on the receiving end of John’s palm.
“…so I decided to don a disguise and do some sleuthing. I successfully tracked Rako from the docks to a gambling hall and then to The Mystique, but I was spotted by a pair of the individuals entrusted with security and order at that establishment, and they let me know I wasn’t welcome. They might have killed me if…”
“I do. I love you, love you, love you. Those beautiful black wings. Like a raven, no? Of course, you’re clever. Ravens are clever, aren’t they? Glossy black raven wings. And eyes, so soft and grey, but sad. Why are you sad, Sherlock? Don’t be sad. I love you. I’ll always love you. What can I do to make you smile? May I touch your wings?”
Sherlock rose and walked towards the refrigerator. “My turn. You rest. Wouldn’t want production to lag.”
He bowed. I set it on his head. He rose to his full height, an expression of pure bliss on his face.
John counted the linen, then began unloading the hamper, piece by piece, anything to distract from the pheromone soup that was rapidly filling the flat.
Good Lord. I could not meet his eyes. I waved an arm and coughed. “This blue smoke, it’s quite thick, isn’t it? I feel a bit addled,” I said weakly, then shuffled more papers.
“What, I don’t have anything better to do on New Year’s Eve than watch two sloppy drunks fornicate?”
Oh, Lord. The last thing John wanted was to have his nice, cold, crisp winter air polluted by someone’s cancer stick.
Jim closed his eyes as the point of the blade pierced the thin skin under his chin. The burn travelled southward, straight and sure.
“But why, Holmes? Not for medical purposes. He’s got plenty of corpses at his disposal without having to dig up freshly-interred ones.”
“Here, following the records trail, tracking down witnesses that might still be alive, or, you know…”
The fingers massaging Molly’s temples were firm. With each circular caress, they seemed to press a bit deeper into her skull, easing the ache she’d quite forgotten, forgotten because there was an equally expert tongue circling her clit.
Gregory grabbed a sandwich and bit. “Pimento cheese? My favourite! How can you beat cheese, mayo, and pimentos?”
“What does ‘glitter’ have to do with finding our Bad Guy needle in this Club-on-a-Saturday-Night haystack, Sherlock? Any luck spotting him on your side? I’m drawing a blank here.”
“Christ, you are a romantic, aren’t you, sweetheart?” breathed Moriarty. “All right, after our date, why don’t you come up for coffee?” He looked over his shoulder, pointing, if it were possible, which, of course it was, with his eyebrows.
He begins with soft licks at Sherlock’s neck and shoulders and kisses to Sherlock’s hair. He begins with tender, gentle petting, and he ends there, too, if Sherlock grunts and rolls away from him.
The call and response continued until he spent himself. Handkerchiefs were produced, but before even setting himself to rights, he collapsed beside me.
“Who knows? You might have an extraordinary future ahead of you, Mister Raymond. He,” I gestured to the icon, “certainly did.”
“I noticed that you were reading a lot about bees,” said John with a vague wave at the books piled on the floor by the foot of Sherlock’s armchair. “I saw this in a shop window and supposed you might like to, you know, try different kinds of honey. The bees get pollen from different flowers, and the honeys taste different.”
Sherlock wet the flannel, then wrung it out. “We missed midnight, but it is the new year still.” He gently wiped between John’s legs.
“Let’s fill him up with naughty spunk,” sang Mycroft. He moved his hands back to Sherlock’s head and began to thrust in earnest.
“I want you to be well, my dear, and at peace, body and mind, and I want Holmes, someone, to find us!”
It was painful for Mycroft to let his emotions run free, but he braced himself and allowed Lestrade to study his face and wonder at motives and craft his response.
And John can’t help but drop his head and watch and groan. He catches Sherlock watching, too. Beefy red, swollen, leaking cocks. One thick; one long and lean.
Holmes sat at the kitchen table, quietly drinking evening tea and not reading the card for a fourth time.
“Oh, tropical heat is so lovely.” Molly slipped off her voluminous woolly jumper and folded it over her arm.
Holmes understood intellectually that his was only an indirect role, an accidental one borne of ignorance or arrogance or simple lack of precognition.
The words rang in my ears long after Professor Moriarty had disappeared. I had made his situation a near impossible one. He promised to make mine no less, and probably more so.
After a while, they had found themselves debating with unprecedented frankness which of them was the best Alpha.
Jim took up the riding crop. He dragged the keeper down Seb’s spine then bounced it on Seb’s buttocks.
It would taste like any apple, obviously, any ripe, handsome, eye-catching, swollen, plump, wholly-satisfying…
“So apparently does solving a murder!” chirruped Sherlock. “But not many hours, just one, with the right volunteer! I’ve a clue if anyone’s interested!”
“Good thing they stash lube like squirrels store acorns for winter. Christ, Boss, we’re going to get caught with our trousers around our knees, fucking like rabbits on the bloody tit’s kitchen table.”
“Give ‘er another, Seb,” said Jim, addressing the back of the blond head that was buried in the V of Molly’s legs.
Just a photo of a pink-iced fairy cake resting on a bare hirsute chest and a stiff pink prick jutting out beyond.
Irene begs to be punished. Kate obliges. Irene/Kate. Kate with a cock. Dark. Not safe, barely sane. Impact play, blood play, come play.
“The cloth beneath it has a wrinkle large enough to be called a ripple or a small wave. Look about the room. See any signs of inattention to décor?”
Notes: Warning for mention of blood and wounds; Angst-amin Angsty with a too large tam-o-angster (that means it's angsty)
“Not quite, but I’m flattered, nonetheless,” said Mycroft with a self-deprecating smirk. “There is a charming café a short distance from here.”
“You were a bit quiet, but there’s nothing wrong with that. First time, trying to figure out what works, bound to be some missteps…”
You always come with a second anguished scream. I only know this because of the tapes, I never actually hear it.
“I thought I’d ask for what I really wanted this Christmas, which is for us to stop dancing round each and get down to fucking each other’s brains out.”
Janine kissed Mary’s lips, then her neck and shoulders as her hands kneaded Mary’s arse, the muscles beneath tensing and relaxing in rhythm with their rolling hips.
Lestrade emerged from the bathroom with a towel wrapped round his waist. He was drying his hair with a second towel.
Sherlock dipped his head and latched at once, noting, from the corner of his eye, how the other bud gushed with milky fluid.
“Oh, yes. Twelve dozen crates of rare squid stolen in glaring violation of the prohibition of the sale of endangered species—“
No book opens as prettily as your legs. No pages want for fingering as your folds. No rustling of ancient texts or scribbling of quill on parchment or scrape of palimpsest rival your sweet sighs of surrender.
“Angus inherited the grandfather clock from Aunt Ada. It was, or so he said, a token of gratitude for the time he had spent nursing her in her final days.”
“I’ll make your face up so no one recognises you and encourage the rumour that you’ve thrown me off and I’m shopping for someone new.”
Sherlock remembered a picnic cloth beneath her and a cloudless blue sky above her and John’s wet tongue inside her; she remembered the utter decadence of being bare and caressed by a summer breeze as well as John’s mouth. She had thought then,
“A retired service dog ought to spend her days chasing butterflies, but then you’re not that kind of dog, are you?”
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose. A tiny smile flickered on his lips, and he spread his legs as wide as his trousers permitted.
“That’s why you smell so…” Sherlock moved back to lick at John’s neck and their bond mark on the slope of his shoulder. “…delectable.”
“We’re going back to our tent. You are going to drink a cup of strong coffee and lots and lots of water, and I am going to pretend to write in my Feelings Journal while I figure out our next steps.”
Holmes slipped the forkful in his mouth and hummed. “Oh, Watson.” He chewed and swallowed with a curl of contentment on his lips. “Oranges and lemons.”
“I tried to find an angel to go on top of the tree,” said Sally in a husky voice as she reached up to caress Stella’s lovely breasts, "but none of them were even remotely suitable for this household.”
A groan vibrated against Molly’s skin. From the corner of her eye, she saw a hand reach for the lubricant.
Lestrade tried to walk as evenly as possible into the sauna but getting something by the most observant man in the world was a fool’s game.
“Do you always start your day like this, Captain? If we’re sharing quarters, we should know the worst about each other. I play the violin.”
“The committee’s been meeting since April,” said Stanley. “There’s selecting the venue and the theme. Then there’s coordinating the work of the sub-committees for decorations, food and drink, contests, and, most importantly, safety. An event of such magnitude requires many volunteer hours of work to be successful.”
The poem at the end is a terza rima. Thank you to the very kind Mafief who made my vision come true in the concrete form version.
Sherlock spied the balcony in the distance, so high in the moonlit sky that it seemed to be balanced on air and dusky clouds. “That’s not your flat,” he observed.
Molly leaned back against his chest and arched into his touch. “Sylvia from Accounting saw us last night.”

He bent and brought his lips and tongue to the hole and resumed his teasing, and he didn’t stop until he heard his name being shouted, then whimpered.
The grotto was as beautiful as John remembered, the opening in the rocks above allowing silvery moonlight to dance across the surface of the water.
I, too, was once, to use the words of the Royal Beekeeper of Charles II, an expert chemist. My interest in chemistry has not waned, though my focus has narrowed. But yesterday it seemed like we were back at Baker Street with test tubes bubbling and foul smoke filling the rooms. The only difference was that in my haste to contain the disaster, I fell and hit my head, resulting in the good doctor placing me under his strict supervision for the remainder of the day and the night. I was not disappointed, however. I decided long ago that Watson’s tender care was worth any loss to science. Such care meant that I slept very well and woke to a message on my forearm.
“—what some consider paragons of the male physical form in near nude states. Yours was, by far, the duller enterprise.”
“…what one man can invent, two can corrupt,” said Sherlock, smiling and watching the dark streets pass by beyond the car window.
“Elliot Haydon left a full written confession with Scotland Yard before scampering away on a ship bound for the South Pole.”
Lestrade had been crawling about him for the better part of an hour, licking and sucking and rubbing, but keeping him wanting, never giving him the full friction he needed to find release.
They were resting inside him, the eggs, proof that Greg was, in fact, prime despite all human evidence to the contrary.
Seb sucked while fondling Jim’s sacs and teasing Jim’s rim with a single spit-wet fingertip. He swallowed Jim down as he came, then said.
But she wasn’t going to have to ask because what came up the stairs first was the top of a Norway spruce.
On the side table were plates and flutes, cut fruit in small bowls, and cakes and honey. A harem’s worth of cushions was piled on the floor. A grin split my face; my weariness evaporated like morning dew.
Molly smiled at the touch of his lips. “She was glad I’d finally gotten over Jim from IT, she knew he was wrong for me, that as far as she could see, we never had any chemistry.”
There were tall, deep windows at the end of a very dark passage, and I brushed past a pair of bony knees I thought I knew.
; use of The Language of Flowers; angst, h/c, exorcising figurative, post-Reichenbach demons, shifting POV, inspired by Keats.
And then, when we were nothing but panting breaths and tangled limbs and wrung lust, we acknowledged the truth.
Watson nodded, then he let his gaze wander to the flower beds. “Say what you will about Lady Alice and Lady Maude—”
A round slice of orange floated on top of each glass with a tiny curl of lime peel jutting out from the centre.
Jim squatted and brought her hand to his lips, keeping the parasol suspended above the three of them.
“Yeah, I appreciate the thought, and the invitation, but fun fairs might not be the best place for…”
“Does this have to do with Crawford?” asked Lestrade, his brow furrowed in confusion and mild impatience as he joined John at the microscope and bent down and had a look himself.
A swipe of a mouth on a sleeve and Mycroft was being yanked from the chair. He had sense to pluck the small bottle of lubricant from his dressing gown pocket, but dropped it when he was shoved onto the bed, face first.
Jim made a show of straining against his restraints, but he would have cut off his arm—and someone else’s—before he’d fail to honour a bet with Seb. Jim was a psychopath, not an idiot. He knew that you didn’t cross a man who shared a bed with both you and a loaded gun. And a knife. And, sometimes, a crossbow. It was often crowded bed, to be sure.
Without a word, Mycroft parted the sides of the dressing gown, then inched forward in the chair and widened the V of his legs in invitation.
He drank from her as he fondled her, and as her arousal grew, the fluid in his mouth grew sweeter and richer and, impossibly, more delectable.
Fluffy soap suds framed the image of John’s fingers caressing the skin which bore Mycroft and Sherlock’s names. She was evidently making use of the bath attached to Mycroft’s guest room, the entire suite had been recently renovated to evoke the spirit of the island holiday that she, John, and Sherlock had shared. The previous night they had christened it with wanton carnality, but duty had called for Mycroft and Sherlock in the morning.
“Oh, thank God,” said Lestrade with a sigh. He settled back on the rug and rubbed his hand over his face. “I thought I was going mad.”
Molly giggled, then she groaned. “Your tongues, please. I want to come again. I swear it feels like you’re kissing each other inside me. It feels so, so, so fucking good.”
Sherlock Holmes was in love with me, he wanted me, and he wished to spend his dotage puttering about a villa, tending bees—and me.
So what if it was? A nice time for a nice fuck and Mycroft Holmes is, by far, the nicest fuck Greg Lestrade has ever had.
Lestrade had just hung up his coat and was shaking the excess snow off his hair when he spotted the trail of pink rose petals on the floor. He quickly rid himself of his boots and followed the line to the kitchen in socked feet. He lifted lids and sniffed: a savoury roast, a pot of mulled wine, and fresh from the oven, a quartet of tiny mince pies. He washed the grime of the day from his hands and helped himself to a pie. Then frantically panting ‘hot, hot, hot,’ he gulped half the contents of the glass. The cocktail was new: gin, he surmised, and something sweet and something frothy and something oddly floral.
Truly, even in a bed twice the size of the one in which we were sleeping, it would have gone against my nature to stray far from him. I have always been drawn to his warmth and his beauty.
John rocked his hips languidly, easily, into a round arse, and with every slow mock-thrust, his prick stiffened more. He bent his knee, lifting his leg over a hip, and ground just a bit harder, not faster, just pressing deeper into the soft, warm body beneath his.
“Ah, that explains it. I thought I felt something, but then I chalked it up to atmosphere. Nevertheless, I suppose I should’ve mentioned that I was going for a stroll in the garden.”
“Oh!” exclaimed Mycroft weakly when he felt the hard bulge through Lestrade’s thin trousers. He ran his hands down Lestrade’s back and ached, positively ached, to feel the brush of Lestrade’s coarse chest hair against his own smooth chest.
And with that, Lestrade turned away, straddled Mycroft, and sank down, impaling himself on Mycroft’s prick.
Lestrade had no qualms about dirtying his jeans. He fell right to his knees, swallowed Mycroft down, and brought him to the very edge, then pulled off and stood up.
“Are you deaf? Yes. An old lady who couldn’t get across the street fast enough for those bloody cabbies. Oh, here’s the number of the cab that blew the horn at us,” he tapped his phone and Seb’s, hidden in the sofa, buzzed, “make certain he has a real lousy day tomorrow. What?”
Mrs. Hudson’s brow crinkled. “Pajamas?” she echoed, disliking the way the word bounced on her tongue.
“Let’s get the whole thing off,” murmured Sherlock as his body responded to the friction of steady up-and-down rubbing of his prick.
A television crew had been at The Bates in the afternoon, and Lestrade and John were still in their uniform vests and kilts. They hadn’t washed yet, but there were two large plastic bladders of sun-warmed water waiting on them. The outdoor shower wouldn’t be as pleasant as it might have been. The days were growing shorter, and the filming had been tedious and long, so daylight was already fading fast before they’d had opportunity to remove the day’s grime.
“Uh,” Mycroft removed a muffin pan from the oven and looked over his shoulder. “Lemon drizzle. Ginger sponge. Victoria sandwich. German apple. Dundee. Chocolate chip banana.”
“Of course, I’ll get you some water, just as soon as I can see my way to letting go of your balls. God, they feel so good.”
“Suck it like a good baby,” cooed Seb, “or your Alpha Daddy won’t fuck your sweet needy cunt the way you like.”
“Take this.” She was handing him a small glass of water. “It’ll help with the residual possessiveness.” When he hesitated, she put a second glass to her own lips. “Please. I need it, too.”
“A work of art!” exclaimed Alphonse Unworthy with manic glee as he stood before his easel, dabbing from palatte to canvas. “A masterpiece! Angus concealed a lemon behind the cushion! But I was too clever for him and his fruit! I had a grapefruit in my pocket! And a palatte knife!”
I did not hear the words as much as feel them, vibrating within me. Around him a city rose up, but apart from the moustache, what caught my eye most was the colour blue.
I nodded. “Miss Allen’s friend, Miss Plenderleith, is a very skilled photographer. I suppose you know a good deal about photography.”
Mycroft raised his umbrella in invitation, and the figure dashed through the curtains of rain which separated them.
“Oh!” Lestrade looked nervously toward the vacant street, then down at Sherlock’s hands, which were, indeed, rolling his prick with expert precision. “Christ, where’d you learn to do that—no, don’t tell me.”
“You are brilliant, by the way. Outside and inside. It’s been less than two weeks, and you’re positively bronzed!”
The Detective Inspector’s cheeky smile before he pronounced the last word left no doubt in Mycroft’s mind.
“It appears to be one scene in a larger literary work, a scene where I am the recipient of a most intimate gesture. You are not surprised in the least. Did you know of the existence of such works?”
“That glitter’s non-toxic, no?” asked John as he licked the head of Sherlock’s cock. “Because when I swallow you down, I’m bound to ingest a fleck or two. Christ, Mycroft!” John looked over his shoulder. The fabric of his costume was now bunched at his waist. “You brought lube. Of course, you did. “Fuck me while I suck Sherlock?”
“Well, if I bump my shin one more time maneuvering around it,” said Mrs. Hudson as she crossed back into the sitting room from the kitchen brandishing the potato peeler that Sherlock had borrowed for a different experiment, “there will be words.”
She got her first clue when a grave-looking Sherlock stopped by the morgue unexpectedly to tell her that what he needed most was her.
John was surprised when later he spotted a corner of the bee’s wing sticking out from under Sherlock’s bed, but he said nothing, not wanting Sherlock to feel self-conscious about it. After all, it was normal for adults to keep mementos of their childhood about.
John gazed out the open window. “Pure as the driven snow,” he muttered to himself for no reason at all.
“More sensational, perhaps. Though I can’t see how the story of a man failing to restrain his basest instinct and lashing out at those who love him is anything but tedious. Of course, the
He was holding her hair up and kissing the nape of her neck. “Six months, six days. I’m so changeable. But to be fair, I’ve only two. Weaknesses, that is.” He licked, then worried a tender spot with his teeth. “I tried to stay away, but I found I quite simply could not live without you, Molly.”
“He’s going to fillet everyone involved with whatever happened to you,” she explains. “The morgue’s going to get busy. For the last time, will you take the painkillers?”
Sherlock’s gaze narrowed, then he smirked and ran a hand up the centre of John’s chest. “That was just a rehearsal,” he purred.
As he sat, I came to the swift conclusion that my line was, in fact, the crease of his trousers and my aim was to make that line as crooked as possible as soon as possible, but Mrs. Lestrade didn’t raise a fool so I said,
He took my heels in his hands. “I might perform some rudimentary grooming, massage, and then…” He brought my soles to the front of his trousers; I kneaded my toes against the hardening bulge.
“But it seems a shame,” he whispered into the darkness, “to soil so fine a resting place with the waste of a brute urge.”
Mystrade + Johnlock. Romantic. Artful. Fluff. No names so you could imagine any other male slash pairing, if you prefer.
“That girl!” she exclaimed. “She will not do!” She took up paper and pen did her best to remember the contents of Mr. Holmes’ note before the defacing.
“Yet you invaded Afghanistan,” he said dryly, then added, “The crux was: would you notice the alteration in weight? The form I was certain I had reproduced adequately.”
“Thank you for hiding me,” said Lomax to Lestrade. “I might’ve lived, but I’d have been ruined professionally and personally.”
“Pardon me, Mister Holmes, but you seem a bit too knowledgeable and nonplussed about my lamb’s wool.” Wolf looked from Holmes to me and back and nodded. “Indeed, so it’s like that.”
John shushed him. “You’re doing so well. You took my cock so well, and now you’re taking my seed so well. All of it.”
The man’s expression was one of utter shock. Then he looked down at a notebook, flipping pages and muttering, “Always something.” He closed the notebook and said,
I've got ideas for 2 more in this plot thread, but they would technically take place the day after and second day after Halloween so I will save them for early November. Next chapter will be back to stand-alones.
an angry kitten. Sherlock/John. Shape-shifting John. Confession. First time. Cute. Crack. Almost no smut.
But Watson was not to have a quiet morning. No sooner had he settled into his armchair then Mrs. Hudson was announcing a visitor.
John’s head slammed against the bricks so hard that he saw stars. And not just any stars, these were bright, sudden bursts of colour, gold, red, purple, green as well as a white so hot it dazzled.
Jim let his hand on Molly’s shoulder drop, and his fingers found what they sought, what was wedged between the frame and the cushions of the settee.
“Have decreased dramatically?” breathed Mycroft. “Yes, I shall ponder the possible reasons at a later moment, oh, fuck…”’
“You are not a murderer, Doctor. You are a savior. Matthew hurt a lot of people, his wife and children included. He did not wish to. It was not in his nature, his real nature, I mean, to hurt anyone, but he was ill, and he ignored his illness for a very long time. And then, at last, his mind was diseased, horribly, dreadfully diseased. There was nothing for it. We lived in terror. He might have killed me, killed the children, and who knows how many other people before the illness finally claimed his own life. And I know there is another family suffering tonight far worse than ours is. As horrible as it is to be a widow, I am relieved that I am no longer a wife. I mourned the loss of my husband, my good, good husband, long before you put a bullet in him, long before he put a knife in poor Jonas Goodacre.”
One corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched, and John watched his change of expression with interest. A clever retort formed, grew to maturity, and then was interred without a sound ever escaping Sherlock’s lips.
“Don’t tease. There’s no time. I’ve got to get you back to that police launch before anyone notices you’re gone.” Moriarty dropped and pressed his lips to the damp fabric of Sherlock’s pants. Then he nuzzled the bulging outline of Sherlock’s cock and traced the edges with the tip of an outstretched tongue. “Only time for a cock cuddle and a kiss good-bye.”
This is also for the 2021 GYWO 7 days, 7 stories, day 5 prompt: 4 Unrecognizable Write a story from the perspective of someone who has woken up in a room or place they do not recognize.
Sherlock hummed again. “Want to be naked,” he mumbled before sitting up to pull off his shirt. He resettled in his former position, his cock half hard from Mycroft’s petting.
But he didn’t realise that he had spoken the words aloud until Mycroft’s hummed reply sent a new stab of lust straight to the core of him.
Sherlock’s feathered tail and two iridescent-dusted buttocks swayed as he led John through the crowd.
Holmes has a shock. Watson has a secondary source of income. Crack, H/C & Fluff. Rating: Teen. References to rimming. No actual rimming. Fade-to-black tease. For the Kinktober Day 13 prompt: rimming.
“May Walpurgisnacht be a happy feast, my dear Watson, and know that the addition of you is, by far, the best change in my life.”
“Hold on, lover,” said Lestrade as he gripped Mycroft’s hips tighter and angled himself to full advantage.
Sherlock can take him on the stairs, whilst making tea, in his armchair, in Sherlock’s armchair, on the rug, against the wall, really, anywhere two bodies of their proportions can fit, comfortably or not.
For without change of costume or tincture of hair or face, the man I knew as Sherlock Holmes became another person entirely. And this person I knew, too. I recognised him readily enough though I’d only seen him briefly and but once in my life.
“I’m prepared to wait,” answered Mycroft, just as bluntly, adding, softly, “I confess the third act has always held the most allure.”
“Yes, it took many days of careful surveillance and a host of wardrobe and character changes—thank you for the loan of the corsets, by the way—”
She was sitting on his face, cycling through another orgasm. She lifted herself off him, bracing one hand on the wall. She looked down.
Sherlock shook his head. “On the contrary, I’ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.”
The first 100 words were written for the DW Watson's Woes May Drabble fest. The prompt was: good morning, good morning, good morning. Watson wakes up with at least 2 people.
I had just paid a driver handsomely for helping me to deposit a large, heavy, ornate trunk on the rug.
John licked Sherlock’s perineum until Sherlock was whimpering, then he tongued at Sherlock’s rim until the whimpers turned to coalesced into one plea-chant.
“Stop,” said Sherlock gently. He cleaned himself and tucked his prick back in his pajamas bottoms and returned the used flannel to John, who grimaced at it before turning and walking back down the hall to the bathroom.
“Scintillating. I suppose it’s posted alongside the one classifying 243 types of tobacco ash and the one about ears.”
“I suppose I’d like greater understanding, but I haven’t the strength to pursue anything. I’m adrift, like all my fellow loungers and idlers in this great cesspool. Let’s have the future.”
“I’d like to take you upstairs, and," Lestrade looked up; Mycroft blushed, "show you all due consideration.”
Two a.m. Who stayed at the office until 2 a.m.? Detective Inspectors of New Scotland Yard, apparently.
“Hey, Tiger.” The boss gave a mock grunt. “Oof. Rut, Sebbie. You’re not nearly hard enough. Oh, there you go. You’re going to want to watch this, Mister Holmes.”
“Oh, yeah,” responded John. He spread his legs and lifted his hips again. “You need it, you need this arse that bad, huh?” he taunted. “You couldn’t wait for me to wake up?”
And the traces of familiar-looking mud in Sir Adrian’s study that he’d taken great lengths to unsuccessfully hide.
“You thought wrongly, as you often do. They are perfectly formed.” He stood and began to pace. “Well, there you have it.”
“Shit that they didn’t tell you before you were on your way to the airport, but I’m glad I won’t be alone on my first weekend off in months.” Lestrade gave Mycroft a peck on the cheek. “I had just settled in with my surrogate companion.” He gestured to the table and the open box and the two piles.
