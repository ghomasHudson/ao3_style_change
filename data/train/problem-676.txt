He had offered to take over for her for a few days, so that she might sleep in her own bed, pack even more clothes, and spend time with her cat, Aragog, who she had not seen for nearly a month. In fact, the scrawny animal was perhaps more familiar with her neighbour than her, now.
The Inspector hurries into the room to see a pale Sherlock curled up on the floor, whimpering softly. Sighing, he approaches the detective quietly, placing a hand on his shoulder.
"They'll be here soon," Donavan informed him, blinking at her phone. "Huh. Service is gone again. Must of been a satellite passing overhead or something."
"Do not," he countered feebly, but he put it on again nevertheless. They sat in silence for a minute, and then John asked something he'd been meaning to ask for a while.
"It's nine," she said, glancing at the clock. "I don't usually sleep 'til – it doesn't matter, sorry. What's wrong?"
John nodded solemnly, reaching out to accept the offered hospital gear. He slipped the disposable paper mask over his face, hands shaking only slightly.
John could have cried with relief. They began to wean him off the Diprivan, which had been keeping him under, until they ceased the dose completely that evening.
"There isn't much to be done." He was so nonchalant, as if he hadn't just shattered Watson's little world into millions of pieces. Watson wanted to feel angry, but in this sliver of time, in their pocket of space, he felt nothing but bottomless
It was then that Holmes, who had been gripping his handkerchief so tightly, broke dear Watson's heart. For as he opened his palm, revealing the horror within, the older man's vision became shrouded in just
John sighs. "Sherlock, my roommate had mono at university. You're not going to want to go out in a few days."
"Trapped," Sherlock repeated, face seemingly impassive. But then his knees buckled, and he sunk to the floor, one hand thrown out against the wall to steady his landing.
"You should be in bed," John suggested but, looking at the lidded eyes and weary expression of the detective, he just pushed him into a lying position and threw the nearest blanket over his skinny form. "Get some sleep," John ordered as he went to wash up the bowl, but Sherlock was already gone.
"Nice try. And the heating isn't broken, for your information. Oh detective, who can't tell he's burning up."
Of all that happened that day, Mycroft will always remember one moment most distinctly. As his mother left to let the paramedics into the house, his little brother had turned to him, breath raspy, and reached out a hand. "Myc," he had wheezed, fingers gently squeezing his saviours wrist - before his head fell to the side and he lost consciousness once more.
Over tea, the morning of this revelation, Watson had almost let his anger overtake him. Had almost bellowed this new information to Holmes whilst he shakily drew a china cup to his lips. But it had quickly dissipated. The detective was a wraith, not half the man he was, and there would be no sense in admonishing him for who he had once been. Instead, the good doctor had poured his friend another steaming cup, and returned to his reading of
"Have... to get... out," he gasped, holding on to John's arm. The doctor slid down next to him, his body serving as something to lean on.
The detective looks up suddenly and shoots Anderson a withering look. "Fine. Just pained by the magnitude of your idiocy."
Mr. Holmes becomes a victim of one of the most prevalent killers in Victorian England. Dr. Watson is, frankly, devastated.
"You're from London," the darker said, mouth pulling up into a smirk. "We're surrounded by Northerners. It's nice to hear someone with a more familiar accent."
"What Irene Adler?" He took a step further into the room, worried about Sherlock's clearly fawn-like feet. "She got away. No one saw her." Sherlock threw himself towards the open window, peering through it as if somehow the answers lay on the other side. John almost thought he'd fall through. "She wasn't here, Sherlock." Turning around at breakneck speed, the detective fell onto the floor - John would have said deliberately if he hadn't known any better - and began clawing at the floorboards, searching under the bed for a bloody dominatrix. "What are you...?" He then glanced over at the wardrobe, frowning at the space underneath that. "What?" John wondered if he'd gone completely mad.
"I assume your's don't include pollen - I've spent a spring with you." He grinned, then. "And you like dogs too much for hair to set it off."
. John smiles sadly, holding his hand out for the tissue so he can dispose of it in the bin. The detective shifts over to the bath and leans against it, closing his eyes. "Please don't let it last months."
"Yeah, that tends to be how it goes." John stood, patting Sherlock on the shoulder. "Come on, mate. Let's get you back to bed."
"No sign of a struggle," Anderson chimes in from behind him, and Sherlock inwardly flinches at the breach in silence. That, and the fact that Anderson's stupidity is inherently annoying.
The detective gasped, hanging limply in their arms. Straightening, the two men manoeuvred him around the mess and up to the front door of 221B Baker Street, Sherlock merely a deadweight in between them.
"I'm perfectly fine, John," he answered, rolling his eyes. "I just had a chill pass over me, is all."
One, two... nineteen, twenty. Five forced breaths. One, two... a broken rib... eighteen, nineteen...
Despite her reputation, however, Sally made sure to jam a piece of wood under the door next time a case involved a cramped space.
"John, do hurry up. A man has just been murdered and you're dawdling," the deceptive quips, wrinkling his nose and sanding his hands together. "It's quite irritating."
Donavan frowned. "What's wrong with him?" she sneered. "We know the rooms small, freak. We're the ones trapped in here."
John, of course, was a little shocked by the state of the detective. "He's had a seizure," Mycroft quietly explained, and upon seeing John's even more puzzled expression, ended tactfully with, "he has epilepsy."
A little girl's cry interrupted his monologue, and John gasped, having temporarily forgotten his daughter. "Oh, I -" his hands left Sherlock's, and he found himself clambering down the stairs and knocking frantically at Mrs Hudson's door. Already roused by the commotion, the older lady appeared quickly in a dressing gown, concerned.
"Okay." She brought the tea to her lips and drank deeply. She closed her eyes, sank slowly into the wooden chair. Greg felt something stir a little in him.
"You okay mate?" he asked with what could only be trepidation, and Sherlock shot him a withering look, pausing halfway up the stairs. John swallowed.
They'd been on a case, as usual, and Sherlock hadn't even been running - it was early summer and they'd been at the flat looking over files. Sherlock had taken down a few books from the shelf and they'd shot into his hands following a cloud of dust - he'd coughed and waved his arms about, but then he'd rambled on to John about how the murderer had predicted the exact time the ball would ricochet off of the -
"We can try our best to make sure it doesn't," John says, flushing the loo, "but I can't promise anything."
Sherlock spat acid and saliva into the bottom of the loo, before resting his head against the cool porcelain lip. "Everything hurts," he mumbled, eyes closed against the roiling of his stomach.
"Well open it then!" Sherlock snapped, thrusting a hand forward. John looked at him in surprise. The detective opened his mouth and shut it again, shrugging moodily. "It-it smells enough as it is."
The man at the end of the phone seemed to ponder her words for a while. There was only the sound of her stuttered breathing, and Aragog's continuous purring. She prodded the cat with her foot, and received a coarse lick in return.
He didn't see much of Sherlock the next day. He awoke late, at approximately fifteen minutes past twelve, and got twisted in the blankets in his rush to get out of bed. He shrieked loudly when he hit the floor with a loud
Lestrade sighed, stepping back into the hall, Molly shuffling out after him. He sent Sherlock a desperate look. "If you need anything –"
Sherlock Holmes passed away in his sleep the following Tuesday, minutes before May could light her first sun.
The detective took a moment to cough again into his handkerchief, thin fingers gripping his jaw tightly, and once he had finished, he angled the cloth away from Watson's sight. "Forgive me, my friend," he said softly, "but your fears are unfounded. I know what ails me, and I know, also, that I shall not recover from it." Watson felt the river-stones become lumps of molten rock. "I am dying, doctor."
"How can you be so sure?" Watson queried almost desperately, hands gripping the arms of the chair so tight his knuckles were at risk of bursting forth. "Surely, there must be a mistake?"
And he did, only to be sent into panic again five minutes later. And this is how it went for a long while - John working hard with him to slow his breathing, only for Sherlock to begin gasping again soon after.
The taller boy straightened his tailored shirt, a deep purple that made his skin appear even softer than usual. "Sorry, yes," he said, taking his key from behind the door and closing it behind him. "What drinks have you got?"
John was glad she had prepared them. He had to look away upon seeing Sherlock, who seemed more tubes than person, but the tell-tale hiss of the ventilator disallowed him his own preservations. Mycroft huffed quietly, before murmuring something about speaking with the doctors, and leaving the room. John wondered if he, too, could not bear the sight of the man on the bed.
But there was something about him that just screamed loneliness. Something in the pale regard of his eyes, subdued by a satin sadness when no one was looking. It reminded her of her dad, when he'd been dying of the same disease. And she'd be damned if she ever ignored such a desperate plea again.
"Contemplation, you say?" Watson sat further upright in his chair, moving his collar about his neck in discomfort. "Of what? There are no cases, Holmes. Even the criminals have postponed their villainy in lieu of the humidity!"
The doctor smiled, touched by this softer side of the detective - the vulnerable side. He didn't like being seen as weak.
They'd agreed they'd do a small pre-drinks in John's room at around 10:00 PM, and at around 10:15, the medical student grew restless. Straightening his jacket, he wandered over to the room opposite, rapping on the poorly painted door.
"I know," she said kindly. "I do. You think people can't see that you care, but they do. You care in your own way, Sherlock, and that's why you're never alone. You have Lestrade, Mrs Hudson – even my cat Aragog, who you must meet by the way." She laughed brightly, and he thought it might be the first time in a while he'd heard such a luminous sound. "We'll always be there. You'll always have friends in us."
Lestrade winced at the language. Sherlock had never been known to swear. But, as the younger man retched loudly again, whole body arching over as he struggled unsuccessfully to fetch up anything substantial, he supposed at this point Sherlock was allowed some liberties.
A brave approach by Doctor John Watson, very brave indeed. A blunt proposal, a sharp observation made by an obstinate practitioner. He was daring, making a statement- an
"People will talk," he said, looking at Lestrade's sopping wet shirt and the way John's hair was stuck to his forehead. The three started laughing, until Sherlock dissolved into a coughing fit and his friends had to calm him down.
The doctor opened the door to find a dishevelled Sherlock sprawled on the floor, tangled up in the sheet he'd worn to Buckingham Palace merely hours earlier. "You okay?"
Around lunch Sherlock's fever had rocketed to forty point two, and despite John's original threats, Sherlock's slurred pleading had stopped him from calling an ambulance. Instead, he had been kneeled down next to the sofa with a bowl of water and a cloth, wiping down the detectives face as he shivered and moaned, caught between sleep and consciousness. John wasn't surprised that Sherlock's body had rebelled so - for one, he barely ate or slept, but he also never got sick. So, when he did, it was bad.
"Right," John laughed, feeling silly. "Of course." They moved along in silence, dropping an array of questionable substances onto their plates. "So..." desperate to break the silence, John spoke up. "Other than the excessive potatoes, how are you finding Durham so far?"
"You're very lucky, Sherlock," Lestrade says, helping him sit up and lean against the wall. "It could've been much worse."
A sunnier Friday morning in the last week of April began with Holmes struggling to rise from bed. Watson found him, dreadfully pale once more, emaciated, and in terrible pain where he lay stiff on his back.
"Calm," John soothed when the detective started shaking, his teeth gritted. "Some one will come soon." He turned to Greg. "Try opening it from in here again?"
But the detective smiled, and swinging his legs out of bed, stood. "Go wash up, Dr. Watson, and I shall meet you in the parlour in but half an hour." He glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner of his room. "We must waste no time."
Deciding that perhaps some comfort couldn't hurt, he slipped on his trainers and thrust open the door. Immediately, the stench of vomit assaulted his nostrils, and he paled, trying not to gag himself. Whoever it was had left the bathroom door open, something the other residents would not be happy about once the smell began to pollute their whole floor. Shaking his head, he took a step into the corridor – and froze.
"What is it they call it now?" Holmes' lips tilted up minutely into a sort of sickly smile, skin so eerily pale it could have been luminescent. "The White Death. The Robber of Youth. Cons –"
Sherlock is on a case and experiences a migraine. Turns out, they aren't uncommon for him. Lestrade helps him out.
"Are you sick now?" John queried just before the detective retched, and, rolling his eyes, the doctor held the basin under his chin. Now was not the time for 'I told you so's - those would come later - so instead, the good doctor rubbed circles on his best friend's back while he vomited noisily into the bucket.
John clenched his fists. "The one they sent letters about. The one you were supposed to have before university, because it prevents
, whilst Mycroft, fingers shaking, had gripped Sherlock's nose and pressed his mouth to his little brother's sticky lips, shuddering at the coppery taste of blood as he breathed for his only real friend.
"About fucking time," he muttered, and then pushed his way into the block, arms practically holding himself together for the shaking. John frowned. It was still early October, and although the temperature up North was considerably lower, it wasn't quite cold enough to be shivering in a Belstaff coat.
It was an hour later that Sherlock started to doubt his theory. Abandoning his experiment, he migrated to the sofa, falling onto it without his usual grace and taking a few deep breaths. It's at this moment that John completed his blog post, clicked 'publish' and clambered downstairs. Groaning internally, the detective hauled himself up, using the back cushions to support himself, and smiled as the doctor came in.
sick," John clarified, and when Sherlock opened his mouth to argue - "Ah! No. Keep it closed while the thermometer is doing its job." The taller man could've killed John with the look he shot him next. The doctor smirked, pleased that he caught Sherlock out at an opportune moment.
The doctor did not respond – it did not feel appropriate. But he did reach across the side table that stood between them, resting a calloused hand atop the arm of Holmes' chair. Not quite touching the man himself, but bridging the distance.
The detective sucked in a breath, and on its way out, his lips could be heard shuddering. His knee stopped bobbing and intead went slack, but the shaking intensified. Their simultaneous breathing worked for a few minutes, but then Sherlock lost control again.
"Let's get you into the bath. It should help with your fever too," John said, before realising Sherlock was probably unable to stand. "I can't... carry you. Uh... Let me ring someone."
"Mike Stamford says Klute is fun," John suggested, packing up his notes. "But we need to bring an old pair of shoes if we go. Apparently you step in all kinds of shit."
The ride back to Baker Street is relatively quiet, the only sound being Sherlock's short cries every time the cab hits a bump in the road. Lestrade rubs his arm protectively every time the detective's face contorts in pain; he feels incredibly paternal towards the younger man in this moment, as if it is his duty to ensure he gets the best care possible. He closes his eyes against the sudden guilt of calling Sherlock out onto a crime scene. Yet, it couldn't have been his fault- the detective made no sign that he was sick, notoriously stubborn as ever. Except, for some reason, Lestrade feels he should have known anyway.
Lestrade just about manages to get them over to a bush before Sherlock doubles over and vomits noisily onto the grass. Wiping his mouth, the younger man straightens out, eyes slits against the sun.
John Watson had been warned about Fresher's Flu, and as a budding medical student, had dismissed it with a scoff – but as he was now discovering, hangovers were no small deal. In fact, after six straight nights of hard-core drinking, John had awoken with both a spectacular headache and the taste of regurgitated jaeger in his mouth, and thus thanked the gods that both Sunday and Monday were void of lectures. He wasn't sure how much of a seminar he could absorb whilst this deep in his own woes.
He was right, of course. He could handle wiping bile off Sherlock's chin every now and then, checking his pupils for dilation and keep him somewhat hydrated. He had expected all of this. What he hadn't expected were the
The first-year held back a pathetic whine as he took up the spot next to the door, jumping up and down as if such an action would prevent him from wetting himself. He had just taken to wondering whether he should break the rules and use the bathroom the girls shared on the floor below, when luckily, the shower shut off, and John heard someone scrabbling around inside for their things. Moments later, a dishevelled, skinny youth appeared, shivering in an oversized beige towel.
The younger man lowered his eyes so that his lashes cast dark lines across the curve of his cheek. "Watson," he led gently, "you are more than just a doctor to me. You are more than someone to share my lodgings with. You are more than a convenience." He looked at Watson once more. "I think you always have been."
She scooped him up, and brought him to her chest. His long black tail reared up to tickle at her chin, soothing her ragged nerves. "I'll bring you to meet him one day," she muttered, pressing a kiss to the top of Aragog's head. "I think he'd like you. But not today. I think, unfortunately, you'd do more harm than good."
It had started with a cough, as these things do. London winters were often unforgiving, and left many crippled by congestion and malaise, and with the poor care Holmes took with himself, it was unsurprising to the doctor that he, too, fell prey to a touch of influenza.
Sherlock completed his sixth and final cycle weeks behind schedule. His cold had grown into full-blown pneumonia, and for a while it was touch-and-go. Mycroft had flown his parents in from Scotland to say goodbye, only to be slapped forcefully by none other than Molly Hooper herself.
John stoops down to assess the corpse, snapping on the plastic gloves shoved his way by the forensic team. Carefully, he probes the victim's head, sucking in a breath of stank air. "Wound to the back of the head, likely afflicted by a blunt object. Fractured skull, bruising..." John turns to Sherlock, watching him circle the body like a vulture. He has yet to say anything.
"Perhaps I should become more expected," the consulting detective mused, a crooked smirk adorning his mouth, "in order to become unexpected once more."
Three weeks later, Sherlock Holmes vacated room 221B, and dropped out of Durham University. The room was taken up by a second year Philosophy student soon after. The change went unnoticed by everyone.
"Well, you do not understand many, old friend." Watson stared slovenly past the billowing curtain for a moment, before forsaking propriety, and in a movement quite unlike him, undid his collar and the next button forthwith. "But no, it is true – there is no beauty in death."
In the beginning, Watson had been horrified by the severe progression of Holmes' disease. If his knowledge served him correctly, his father had survived more than a year, and Keats, who had found this frightful thing so romantic in 1819, had lived with tuberculosis for two. But with the speed of his friend's deterioration, the doctor feared Holmes may not last until the end of spring.
– and leaned over the sink by his wardrobe, fumbling with the tap so he could fill a plastic cup with cool water. Chucking back two paracetamol and an ibuprofen, he sighed at how much better he felt already, before splashing the same water onto his face. A quick brush of his teeth and a hand through his hair later, John could move onto the next order of business – the piss he'd probably been needing since 3 AM. He could even have a shower whilst he was at it. Picking up his wash bag, John opened the door to his room and peered down the corridor, eyes clocking onto the bathroom he shared with seven other guys.
But one thing John had never anticipated was a rather large chink in his flatmates mental armour. Specifically his amygdala.
"How much did you have to drink?" John asked, concerned. With the way things appeared, he wouldn't be surprised if his friend had contracted alcohol poisoning. His only response was a reflexive swallow. "Sherlock, how much?"
They came, around ten minutes later. They knocked on the door loudly, so loudly John almost thought it might wake Sherlock. But he didn't move.
The doctor fell briefly into a nightmarish gauze of confusion, only vaguely registering his best friend's head slamming repeatedly onto the floorboards, before throwing himself violently into action. In no time at all he had Sherlock turned on his side, head cushioned on his lap, trying his best to stop his writhing limbs from getting more tangled up in the glass and debris surrounding the table. A strange whimper exploded from the detective, followed by a small pool of vomit, and John swore in a whole spectrum of colour under his breath as he waited for the seizure to pass. It did, eventually, around twenty-six seconds later, and as soon as Sherlock's body lay still John swung his phone out from his dressing-gown pocket and dialled an ambulance, eyes never leaving Sherlock's as they rolled sluggishly in his head.
As the months went on John became used to the shortness of breath that would follow a pursuit, though Sherlock seemed to only stop when the need for air became dire - much to John's despair. He even took to carrying around his own inhaler, not quite trusting of Sherlock's self-care skills. He made sure to get all the information he needed from Mycroft, who retold the struggle the detective went through as a child.
As it turned out, most of the corridor was empty, including Sherlock's room. John knocked three times, but it appeared as if Sherlock had left him to sleep – perhaps so he could get some particularly difficult Chemistry done on his own. John scoffed. Sherlock, struggling with Chemistry?
"I believe it's a sort of food." He opened his door. "And well... All food here means potatoes. There appears to be little else at dinner-time."
It had all, horrifyingly, made sense. The cough that Sherlock had been struggling with for weeks suddenly didn't seem so much like a wintry cold anymore. The tightness in his chest that he'd assumed was a result of intense physical exertion became much darker, and more terrible. And the fatigue – the feverish, thick syrup that had been stuck between his eyes for over a month – no longer coincided so suitably with his frequent sleepless nights, or his busy, uninterrupted lifestyle. He had sought help for a supposed renal problem, and had received, instead, a pockmarked CT scan, six cycles of EP combo chemo, and a rather dismal prognosis.
"Swollen tonsils, sweats, chills, sore muscles and fatigue." John is surprised his flatmate is being so compliant. He sighs with relief, glad nausea hadn't made its way onto the list. When Sherlock vomits, it is particularly unpleasant.
"I'm fine," the detective countered tersely, sucking in a deep breath. John sat down on the sofa next to him, keeping one eye on the bin and the other on his flatmate, sipping his tea absent-mindedly.
Molly Hooper had only been in her own apartment for twenty-three hours before she was called by Mycroft Holmes.
"You feel sick?" Sherlock shook his head, frowning. He opened his mouth to say something, lips parted enough to show a row of tiny milk teeth, when a pained gasping noise came instead. His eyes rolled back into his head as he stiffened, and he proceeded to fall sideways and almost completely off the bed if Mycroft hadn't caught him with both arms, and tenderly laid him down on the carpet.
John was a medical student – he knew how these things went. He knew why they pressured students into getting the vaccine before starting their first year. He knew 5 – 10% of bacterial meningitis cases were fatal. He knew 15% of those who did not succumb to the disease were left with disabling complications, sometimes for the rest of their lives – that Sherlock might not come out of this unscathed.
, bright and mocking on the inside of the cloth, on the tips of Holmes' fingers, at the edges of his lips. It was as if he had been blind, and only now saw the blood everywhere, all over both of them.
There was some shuffling and cursing from inside, and worryingly the smashing of a glass, but eventually Sherlock answered. He looked a little pale and dishevelled, but otherwise, he appeared sharp and graceful as always as he leant against the doorframe, brow creased in confusion.
John hummed, striding out of the room entirely to stand in the kitchen. "Could you bring me a humidifier tomorrow morning? I'm sure you'd get hold of one quicker than I." He looked back at the bedroom door. "I'll see how long this lasts. Then I'll decide if heavy machinery is necessary."
John considers this. "Uh, I beg to differ." He smiles cheekily. "I think I can coop you up in here as long as I want, if you're sick."
Mycroft circled around the desk, hands already reaching forward. He didn't bother calling out his brother's name - simply laid his hands upon the younger man's shoulders and gently guided him down to the floor, his blazer folded under his head. As expected, the consulting detective began to flail a minute later, saliva pooling around his lips. Petty argument forgotten, the elder Holmes began to clear the floor as thoroughly as possible in order to prevent Sherlock from hurting himself on any hardwood. Thankfully, the rug wasn't at all abrasive, and his arms and legs were of course covered by his thick collared coat.
. Looking after cancer patients was itself an emotionally and physically draining business – looking after
There was a short laugh from the doctor. "How singular of you to say. It is expected from you, I should suppose." He closed his book softly, setting it carefully on the side table. "You are losing your ability to surprise me, Holmes."
particularly noise sounded oddly like a body slamming into the floor. It took John precisely forty-six seconds to make it down the stairs. It took him another three to locate Sherlock, who quite frankly, was hard to miss.
John Watson looked out into the London rain, hating the concrete purgatory that swarmed around them like locusts. He wondered if he'd been through the ten plagues yet, or if tomorrow it would rain hellfire and they'd all perish in the flames.
"I'm so sorry," she whispered, her own voice thick with tears, and she brought herself further up to wrap her arms around him. To her surprise, he responded immediately; bringing his own thin arms round to rest lightly on her back, and tucking his face warmly into the crook of her neck. They sunk into each other, both clinging to any shred of comfort, Molly weeping silently whilst Sherlock wet her shirt with large, shuddering sobs. Mrs Hudson came and went, leaving a pot of tea and a plate of biscuits on the table. They stayed like this for near an hour, long after their tears had been stoppered, and silence had fallen.
"But... you needed... help," Sherlock forces out through clenched teeth, digging his nails into the floor. "Case."
When Sherlock was dry and redressed and they were safely back in the sitting room, John handed Sherlock the thermometer while he went to get changed. "Greg, I may have something that will fit you - come upstairs."
Irene turned back to look at him, somewhat distracted, but not enough to not plaster a smirk onto her face. "He'll sleep for a few hours. Make sure he doesn't choke on his own vomit. It makes for a very unattractive corpse." She sits on the windowsill, putting her feet up on the ornate bathtub and grasping a cord hanging from the ceiling. The coat slipped off her shoulder flirtatiously.
"Your fever went over forty, we had to get it down," John answered, and Sherlock nodded. He then weakly gestured to the three of them.
"How can his skinny arse be so heavy?" Lestrade panted once the detective had been deposited in the bath tub. John was too preoccupied to answer, and after stripping Sherlock down to his pants, turned the shower on and watched as it spurted out in a fountain of cool water. His flat mate cried out when it pelted his back, and John winced, knowing that to Sherlock it probably felt like millions of ice shards penetrating his flesh.
The doctor did all he could to soothe his friend, rubbing circles into his hands and wiping at his sallow face, but it seemed the drug wasn't relinquishing its hold - eventually, John opted to hushing him softly, warming his chilled fingers between his calloused palms. Half an hour of misery passed before the tears subsided, and Sherlock curled and sniffled, shoulders relaxing, and appeared to collapse I tiredly into a more restful sleep.
"Anyone could have seen that one, mate," John had replied, rubbing distractedly at his tie with a muslin cloth. "There's no way I'd put this stuff in my mouth either."
"I'm sure you needed the rest." He stepped back, spread his hands awkwardly. "You hungry? I brought some food over."
"You know, I was wrong about him." Irene appeared to be looking at the fallen man endearingly, painted red mouth curling with affection. "He
"Oh Greg, thank you." Molly held a hand out expectantly for the water. The detective handed it over to her wordlessly, unable to pull his eyes away from the scene in front of him.
Sherlock gazed at the ceiling. "Satisfactory," he concluded, filling his cup with squash. "My Chemistry course is prestigious enough, and the scenery is pleasant, but..."
"And it's barely even December," John added, scratching briefly at his stubble. "Some people with asthma struggle more with the cold than others."
He wanted to say more. Learn more, about her, about who she was. Ask her how bad the last few weeks have been. Why she felt so obligated to stay, having only been in this part of London shy of six months, and having only known both him and Sherlock for less than that. But it felt futile. He worked amidst crime, had put away the most despicable of degenerates, tracked his boots through blood, watched his own colleagues crumble and corrupt. He was an expert on terror, a scholar when it came to malicious intent. He could hardly begin to comprehend the motives of someone so
She got up, and began collecting her things. Aragog eyed her warily from his spot beneath the coffee table. "I'm sorry," she whispered, reaching down to scratch behind his ears. "You're going to have to stay with Mr. Dipper again." He mewled despondently. "Oh, hush. I know you like him. He gives you fresh tuna out the can, even when I tell him not to."
At 6 AM the next day, Sherlock's temperature spiked, and he went into a second seizure. The doctors suspected meningococcal septicaemia, and took another blood sample. In a flurry of activity, the antibiotics course was changed, and increased in strength, and Sherlock was put into a medically induced coma in order to better fight the infection. It was suspected that Sherlock's body had shown resistance to the cephalosporins, and John laughed at the irony of it – of course he would be stubborn about the whole thing.
"Before it gets better," she finished for him, grimacing thinly. Lestrade tried not to think too hard about the word 'if'.
"It's alright, you just had a bit of a wobble in there," the doctor soothed, and Sherlock raised his eyebrows tiredly. "Okay, it may have been more than a bit of a wobble."
John shrugged, leaning against the wall. "We'll just have to wait it out." He wrinkled his nose. "You're right about the smell though. Is there air freshener or something?"
"Any nausea?" Sherlock shakes his head. "Good. Can I quickly check your lymph nodes?" A nod. The doctor reaches forward and places his hands on Sherlock's neck, ignoring the detective's involuntary flinches and winces. "I'm sorry about what I said. You're a pain, but I do want to look after you, because... because I care about you. Because I'm your... best friend. It's what best friends do."
So I've done a few short-term illnesses, and would like to get into the deeper stuff. As you've probably noticed, none of these stories are connected (or else Sherlock is a very sickly guy) and so I'm going to have a go at some chronic illnesses. Enjoy and please let me know if I ever get anything wrong. Thank you!
Sherlock cleared his throat, leaning in until they were inches apart. "I don't know much about music," he shouted over the racket, "but isn't this supposed to be a sad song?"
John barely had time to press the dial button before his first and only friend at university began seizing.
"Pull yourself together man," he muttered to himself, walking stiffly through the flat, "what in the bloody hell are you so
"Well, if it goes over forty I'm taking you to a hospital," John countered, and Sherlock's head snapped up. Big mistake. Another wave of vertigo and nausea hit him and, wimpering pitifully, he let John hold the bucket out for him once more as he hung his head over the rim and coughed up his stomach contents.
John scrabbled anxiously for his friend's hands, his own trembling - he lifted one gently, examining his fingers. The nails had begun to take on a tinge of blue, and it looked like his lips were going in the same direction. John swore, letting Sherlock slump where he sat as he darted across the room for his phone. For a frightening few minutes he thought he'd lost it, then there it was, underneath one of the case files, and John misdialed 999 almost twice before he got through.
He nodded, cheek turned into the pillow. His complexion almost matched the off-white colour, his pale eyes hooded and bruised. "I knew it would come some-day."
The DI positioned his hands on Sherlock's chest and back, and a few seconds later the poor man leaned over and vomited into his lap. "It's alright, get it out," Lestrade comforted as Sherlock dry-heaved, and pulling off his jacket, climbed into the tub with him. John returned while the Inspector was attempting to get a response from the detective, and, sighing, handed him the cloth.
It was never quite clear who won these debates, both brothers often asserting their own victory over conclusions, but needless to say this argument ended quite differently. Sherlock was barely through his sixty-fourth point when his tongue began sticking to the roof his mouth, and his eyes drew an unfocussed gaze over Mycroft's shoulder. It took the older Holmes a millisecond to deduce what would happen next - but despite all his sociopathy, he would never quite get used to witnessing Sherlock in the throes of a seizure.
“Okay, Sherlock,” he said. “I’ll come with you.” Though he was annoyed at not being able to continue his book, Sherlock at the beach was a foreign concept to him, and one he was eager to see. He followed Sherlock down to the waves.
“You should have seen Mycroft when Sherlock came home from hospital,” said Mr. Holmes. “He was so fascinated with his little brother.”
“Well, London isn’t so far. It’s only an hour away. We could visit on the weekends,” he rambled on, in denial.
“I can’t believe Sherlock never told us about you,” said Mrs. Holmes. “You met five years ago, and Mycroft tells us you’ve been dating for two months, but you never said a word! Why not?” She turned her attention to Sherlock, who was wriggling in his seat and turning red.
John was tense the whole day long. Instead of watching scary movies at home, he’d have to rescue his friends. Expecting conflict, he loaded his revolver and put it on the table for when he’d leave. Disguise. John went to his room, looking for something disguise-worthy. He found the Halloween costume he had planned on wearing. He had gotten Sherlock a matching one, as a joke, because Sherlock was too grumpy and John thought it’d be funny. John’s costume was Bilbo Baggins, and Sherlock was supposed to be Smaug. So much for that. He put on the wig and fake ears, and the tunic and trousers. He even had his own Sting. He decided it might be useful to attack whoever was behind this, so he tucked it in its sheath at his side. He grabbed his mobile and his revolver and was out the door by 6:40.
Redbeard soon joined Sherlock on his wanderings around the farm, and they had lots of fun together. Redbeard was an energetic puppy, and was curious about everything around him, just like Sherlock. Redbeard made Sherlock happy, and playing with the dog was one of the few moments in his life where Sherlock felt like an ordinary kid, playing with his dog, and feeling happiness and love. They looked after the bees, and wandered by the stream, and fed the cows and horses, and played with the chickens, who admittedly were not amused.
“I thought a surprise Halloween party would be fun,” said Sherlock. “I thought you’d be excited to have a case, and be pleasantly surprised to find food and merriment instead.”
“I don’t know, do you want to order in?” He went back to pacing around the room. John rolled his eyes, groaned, and got out of his chair. He walked to the kitchen and took out their stash of take-out menus. Meanwhile, the music of Sherlock’s violin was drifting in from the sitting room.
“Maybe you should have said it once in a while.” Sherlock turned and hauled his bags up to his old room, then sat on the bed, resisting the urge to have a cigarette. Eventually he decided there was no point in trying to avoid his parents any longer. He was at their house, after all. He headed downstairs and was about to enter the sitting room when he stopped just outside the door. Inside, his parents were arguing again.
“Actually, I think maybe I do. The Red Lion was an inn, and its street took its name. Now there’s an empty lot on that street. Let’s start there.” He and John exited the building, Lestrade carrying a shovel.
“No, you may not; we are having a nice lunch with your boyfriend!” Mrs. Holmes seemed incredulous. “We’re just happy for you, that’s all.” Sherlock made as if to get up from his seat anyway.
“It happened immediately after a new kid sat down in front of me,” he said, confused. Why does this matter? He should be taken straight to the doctor.
“Good idea, Greg,” said John. “Come on, Sherlock, we’re moving.” Sherlock, not looking up from his phone, followed the others down to the sand. They ended up picking a spot near enough to the water, but not so near that they’d have to keep moving their stuff so it wouldn’t get soaked. Lestrade put up the umbrella while John set out the chairs and towels. “Thanks for all your help, Sherlock,” said John. Sherlock, still on his phone and now browsing Twitter, set it down once John called him out. Once they’d gotten their stuff arranged, they began to settle in. John picked up his book, Lestrade closed his eyes and laid in the sun, and Sherlock went off somewhere down the beach, though John couldn’t see exactly where he’d gone.
"Could what?" He asked while Mrs. Hudson made her way to the desk by the opposite wall, where all the supplies were. John went behind Lestrade and pushed him over.
“Sherlock, breakfast is ready!” He set the plates down on the table. Sherlock walked in, still in his sheet. “You have to get dressed.”
Mycroft did his best to enjoy his remaining time with Billy that summer, but as soon as he came home he’d immediately go upstairs and distract himself with a puzzle, or schoolwork, or extra work he’d assigned himself, so he wouldn’t think about the end of the summer. He still couldn’t get the hang of the violin and in early August he gave up entirely. The violin was put in the closet with the book of manners. He only came downstairs for dinner, and always ate as fast as possible so he could leave quickly. He ended up eating more, as when one eats fast they don’t realize they’re full until much later.
“There goes Mr. Bear!” said Mycroft in a silly, high-pitched voice. Mr. Bear went into the air and came back down to land in Mycroft’s outstretched hands. He wiggled the arms to make it look like he was dancing. Then, Sherlock’s mouth stretched into a wide, toothless grin. Mycroft dropped the bear, and Sherlock, thinking it was part of the game, smiled wider. “Mummy! Mummy, Sherlock’s smiling!” Mummy gasped and hurried over to the boys. She tickled Sherlock under the chin, and he kept smiling.
“Oh, no, I could never forget you. I just tuned you out.” Mycroft made an unpleasant face. Lestrade chuckled at the exchange. “Brother dear, have you gone to the water yet? I think you’d enjoy it. Nice and cold, just like your heart.” Mycroft glared at him.
“Sherlock, I’m driving.” But Sherlock persisted, and nuzzled his face into John’s shoulder. John chuckled. “Okay, then.” He removed one hand from the wheel and reached over to ruffle Sherlock’s curls. John felt Sherlock’s grip loosen as the detective drifted off to sleep. It had been a long day.
“It’s in America!” John’s eyes widened. He set down the paper, turning all his attention to Sherlock.
“Sweetheart, I want you to know that I love you very, very much,” she began, still hugging him tightly. “And I love you no matter what,” she continued. “I’m fine with you being gay. I hope you know that. You being gay does not make a difference in how much I love you, and don’t you forget it.” Sherlock still said nothing, but now it wasn’t out of fear, but out of being rendered speechless. He hugged her back and suddenly he was crying on her shoulder. He should not be crying. None of this should be happening. He was not supposed to be emotional. He tried to stop crying and couldn’t. All the years of being bullied and ridiculed forced their way to the surface. All the years of hiding everything and pretending it didn’t matter. Rolling with the punches and ignoring the bruises. All the ones that had been and all the ones sure to come. Then he remembered what was happening in the present. He pulled away, wiping his eyes with his sleeve.
“Yes, I think we’re ready,” he said. Sherlock got into Greg’s car with John, while Molly and Mrs. H. got into Mycroft’s. Finally, after much anticipation, they set off for the beach.
“So why don’t you go?” He said, looking up again. Too late. Sherlock had left the room. John followed him back to where Greg and Molly were still talking, though they had now been joined by Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock had taken up residence on the couch.
At four in the afternoon on Halloween, Billy showed up in his costume. He and Mycroft were very excited to go trick-or-treating. Mummy had dressed Sherlock in a bee costume, and he was excitedly making buzzing noises. After enduring several pictures from dad, the two superheroes, accompanied by one bee and two parents, ventured out to get their candy. They ended up with a sizable haul, and Mycroft realized that if he rationed it, he could make it last until Christmas.
“Can you do it again?” asked Daddy, now with the camera ready. Sherlock stared at him and shook his head slightly. He crawled over to the toy bin and busied himself with one of the many entertaining objects to be found. He decided the car was what he wanted and pushed it around absently, often stopping if something else caught his eye before moving on and continuing in laps around the room. Mycroft shook his head a little, bemused and disappointed that Sherlock’s first steps were over so soon.
"We should have a fashion show," said John in between breaths. "With the new clothes." He giggled again. "Baker Street Wear." Mrs. Hudson continued to laugh.
Sherlock didn’t have any roommates, so he was accustomed to doing whatever he pleased. He only did dishes when the alternative was eating off the ground. The first time he had no clean dishes, he had tried that. It wasn’t good. He left his laundry everywhere, except for the nice outfits he owned. He took meticulous care of those. He slept naked, tangled in his sheets. He got up as late as possible and was often late to class. He’d let dust collect until it was impossible to breathe, and even then he’d let it be for a while longer.
Sherlock spent his days much in this way, dividing his time between studying, violin, and adventures outside. Mycroft was getting too busy to play with Sherlock, as he was increasingly busy with studying and what Sherlock suspected was a plot to take over the country, but Sherlock didn’t mind. Mycroft was really starting to get on his nerves. He was becoming increasingly condescending and smothering when he wasn’t busy, so Sherlock started to spend more and more time outside of the house after school. There was a farm nearby where Sherlock helped take care of the bees. He even learned how to harvest honey.
“Well, Molly had to use the restroom, and then Mrs. Hudson wanted coffee, and when we went to get the coffee, there were these doughnuts that just looked so good, so we got some of those as well.” John, lowering the phone a little, relayed this to Greg and Sherlock.
“Sure, we can be friends. Who’s your favorite superhero?” Mycroft grinned, proud of himself and excited to tell his parents.
“Hear what?” he asked, an edge of panic creeping into his voice. Mr. Billings’ face fell as he realized Sherlock hadn’t heard, and he’d have to tell him.
“Hello, baby,” he said to him. “I’ve made you a card. This is you.” He pointed to the drawing. “We’re going to have so much fun together.” The baby looked at him lazily.
He returned to Musgrave Hall to say goodbye to his dad. Even though they hadn’t spoken in months, Mum wouldn’t leave until Sherlock said goodbye. He found his dad in the sitting room, looking at the open pages of a book but not really reading it. He looked up as soon as Sherlock walked in, but didn’t say anything. They stared at each other for a few minutes, each not daring to speak first. Finally Sherlock cleared his throat.
A little over an hour later, the two cars arrived back in London. Mycroft dropped off Molly and then headed to Baker Street to drop off Mrs. Hudson before returning home. Greg stayed for a little while when he dropped off Sherlock and John, but before long he left too, and then there were three. Mrs. Hudson was going somewhere that evening, the boys didn’t know where (Sherlock would be beside himself if he knew), so that evening in Baker Street, it would just be Sherlock and John.
“What if he doesn’t want to understand? What if he just keeps hating me forever? A family meeting won’t fix that,” he said.
“I don’t know, Sherlock,” he said after Sherlock had finished his argument. “It’s a lot of responsibility. And,” he continued, “I’m allergic, so the dog would have to be trained not to go on the furniture, and it would have to be outside a lot.” Sherlock nodded, taking the new information in stride.
Sherlock, despite what he may say about responsible usage, soon became dependent on his seven-percent solution. Reality and imagination became blurred, and every time he tried to cut back, withdrawal would hit him like a high-speed train and he’d cave in. He also tried morphine on several occasions, but nothing felt like cocaine.
"Strike a pose, John!" She encouraged. John paused and put one hand on his hip, and the other behind his head. After a beat, he strutted down the curtain runway.
"Oh, um," John stammered, "Mrs. Hudson and I were just, um, doing... makeovers." John's cheeks were reddening. "Fashion show."
Sherlock became acquainted with the guy who had thrown him the blanket. He was in charge of the place. His name was Arthur, and he agreed to let Sherlock stay and to provide him with food, but in return, Sherlock was going to have to do some favors. The first favor was as a sniffer dog. He had to examine everyone who came in the door and make sure they didn’t bring anything seriously illegal. The second was as a watch for police, to make sure they didn’t come in. The third? Sherlock was now in charge of mixing and administering drugs. He was relatively sober and so was the most capable in the joint.
“Don’t listen to her, she’s remarkable. Always too humble, this one.” Everyone seemed to be at ease except Sherlock, who tried once more to get up from the table.
“And how could I refuse such a generous offer?” said John, grinning. Not even Sherlock’s glare could wipe the smile off his face. The three turned back to the album, flipping through and pointing out funny (embarrassing) photos.
“There is nothing going on, because I do not have a crush!” Sherlock said, standing up. “May I please be excused?” he asked, impatiently waiting for an answer.
The Sunday before Christmas, the 18th, the Holmes family went out to get their tree. The tree farm they went to neighbored a regular farm, and as they drove by it, it was clear that Sherlock wanted to go there instead. Animals are much more fun than trees. They pulled into the lot and got out of the car. After trying to encourage Sherlock to walk, they decided it would just be faster to carry him. While Mummy and Daddy were picking out the tree, though, they set him down to play with Mycroft. He was standing still, nervous to take a step.
The kids who play football during break always end up with a cloudy brown dirt stain on their lower legs, and darker spots of soil on the bottoms and lower sides of the shoes. Often their knees are dirty as well. The kids who stay up past their bedtime have bags under their eyes and usually look dazed when they enter the class, and they move slower. Mrs. Morris smoked in the past, though currently she’s in the process of quitting. Her teeth are slightly yellowed, and so are her nails. She has breathing issues if she gets too worked up, and her voice is sometimes raspy.
“Well, I’m glad you’re not doing it anymore,” he said, in an attempt to clear the room. He gave a small smile, hoping it wouldn’t be taken the wrong way. Sherlock returned his smile, and Mrs. Holmes let out a nervous chuckle.
“Hello, Bill. Would you like to be friends?” he asked, smiling. People liked it when you smiled. But Bill gave him a strange look.
“Doesn’t mean I’m your housekeeper, though,” she said on her way to the kitchen. She came back bearing tea and biscuits, and the three sat around and chatted for a while until Lestrade got up.
The party was most enjoyable. Grandma and Granddad had brought extra-special candy for the occasion, and Mycroft was shocked at how delicious it was. It was a new level of tasty. For Sherlock’s present, they had brought a picture book about pirates, which seemed to interest the birthday boy and provided something for him to enjoy other than bees. Billy (or rather, Billy’s mom) had picked out some pajamas for Sherlock, and Uncle Rudy had gotten him a little car that he could ride on and push. Mycroft had chosen for him a “the farmer says” wheel that made a bunch of animal noises.
"Like a queen," John finished for her. She had purple eye shadow, and dark eye liner. Her lipstick was a deep red (but not cerise), and she had rouge on her cheeks. The colors were bright, but the application restrained. Her nails were painted a pale shade of pink, slightly darker and redder than her natural nails, but close enough to not draw attention from her face. She truly did look royal.
“Ah. Well, I’d best be off,” said Sherlock, gesturing to his leg. “See you around, Victor.” He limped away in search of medical attention.
After a two-hour drive, he finally arrived back at Musgrave Hall. He knocked on the door, and it opened to reveal a beaming Mum.
“I’m working on a theoretical plan that could solve the traffic issue in London,” he said, a tad proudly. Sherlock started to play with the things in Mycroft’s room, running his hand along the books on the shelf and bouncing on the bed. He was just about to reach for a fragile glass decoration on top of the dresser when Mycroft thought of something. “I might have something you can do,” he said thoughtfully. He went to his closet and retrieved the abandoned violin that Uncle Rudy had gotten him so long ago.
"Okay, now it's my turn!" John went over to the sitting room where the carpet ended to wait for Mrs. Hudson to walk. In a few minutes, she came out wearing a purple dress that matched her makeup, complimented by a string of pearls around her neck and a gold bangle around her wrist. She wore black heels, but they were short and so she had no trouble strutting down the carpet. She acted like she was really on the runway. John decided he should be the announcer.
Victor was also useful as a lab assistant. Whether Sherlock was experimenting in the residence kitchen or the campus labs, he always made sure Victor was available to help. He knew what Sherlock needed, when he needed it, and he didn’t ask stupid questions. The first few times Sherlock brought him along, however, things didn’t run as smoothly.
The next few days were dull, but at least they were safe. They passed the time playing chess, talking to each other, reading, writing, cleaning. They did every possible thing to do, and were still bored. Neither of them made any move to go anywhere, however, until they ran out of food. John came out of the shower to find a note on his desk. It said:
“Ace, no!” he scolded. “No biting!” he joined Sherlock in freeing his ankle, and soon the dog was under control. “Sorry about that,” said the man.
Thanks to a great cabbie, he arrived five minutes early. He waited outside, unsure of whether or not he should go in early. He decided it was best to wait and enter on time, just to be safe. He opened the door and wandered inside. It was dark, and he was on the alert for an ambush.
“Awesome. So, first up. Your brother has requested you go to a rehab program, which I think is a good idea. What do you think?” Sherlock thought this over. It would probably be best to reset from the drugs so he could use them responsibly again.
“How should we do this?” Greg asked. “Two face off, then the winner goes against someone else, or what?” Everyone pondered this as they realized they had an odd number of teams.
All morning, Sherlock dreaded the family meeting. He hid himself up in Mycroft’s old room, now a small laboratory, and focused on his experiments. He was analyzing the dirt from the garden. When Mycroft arrived, Sherlock was amazed at how different his older brother looked. He had had a haircut and was dressing much nicer, and he carried himself as if he were important. He had also lost weight. Mycroft looked like a proper grown-up.
“Everyone’s missing, so we’re staying here and we’re not leaving until we figure out what’s going on. I am not losing you, too,” he said. “No going to the shops. You might not come back.” Mrs. Hudson seemed remarkably calm while John was growing increasingly frantic.
“I’m going to have a chat with your teacher, then,” she said. “Nobody accuses my boy of cheating.” Sherlock shrank a little in his chair and his eyes widened. He did not want Mum to interfere. Then the kids would tease him more.
“That’s really him?” laughed John from the sitting room. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he entered to find John sandwiched between his parents, a photo album open on his lap. He was pointing at a particularly embarrassing shot from his infant days. He had gotten his hands stuck in some lattice in the garden while exploring and was crying. Mycroft was behind him, trying to pull him out but only hurting Sherlock’s wrists more.
“Just don’t let things get to you. Pretend there’s a wall, and you can’t hear what the others are saying. Words only have power if you let them have power, so simply don’t let them.”
“Will do.” The door shut behind Lestrade and John and Mrs. Hudson were left to clean up the make up from the desk. Mrs. Hudson brought the box and bag back downstairs to her flat and John was left by himself. He decided to start blogging the recent case Sherlock had solved that he hadn’t gotten around to writing up yet. He grabbed his laptop and sat down at the desk.
Sherlock’s boxes made their new home in his residence, which was conveniently located near the lab. He decided it would be best to unpack his things. His chemistry set was regrettably left at home in favor of the campus facilities, so he started with throwing his sheets on the bed. He didn’t stop to make the bed, as he was content to sleep in a tangle of sheets. He put away his books and hung his clothes up in the closet, except for his pajamas, which he deposited on the bed with the mass of sheets.
“Maybe boring’s what you need, though,” John said. “Nice, quiet life.” Mrs. Hudson made a sour face and shook her head.
“I’m going to go check on Rosie,” he said. Babies were hard work, but they made great excuses sometimes. He went to his old room. Rosie’s bucket had been placed on the bed and she was sleeping soundly inside it. He stroked her cheek, then picked her up and cradled her gently. Her nap was almost over, and any minute now she’d wake up and start crying. She cried a lot now, and she had no qualms about doing it in the middle of the night. Thanks to the open windows, he could hear the others conversing in the dining room. Suddenly they erupted into enormous laughter. Sherlock’s hopes that Rosie didn’t hear were in vain. She started to cry, and Sherlock’s efforts to calm her down were fruitless. He tried bouncing her up and down, and shushing her, and rocking her, and hugging her, and he even got out the bee plushie with the crinkly wings but nothing was working. He was finishing changing her diaper when John ran in.
Over the course of the term, Sherlock and Victor hung out a lot. Neither of them had any other friends, but they were happy just to have each other. They’d walk around campus together, dine together, and study together. Although Sherlock didn’t always enjoy slowing down to match Victor’s pace, he still found it enjoyable (and an interesting study) to talk with him. Sherlock even spent one of his holidays at Victor’s parents’ home, and he found it to be quite relaxing.
The next day (after a few hours of sleep) he set right to work. He began by trying to figure out where each of the pictures were. Using maps and the internet he managed to come up with this list, numbering each name with the photo it was in:
One day in July 1990, Sherlock was on his way to the farm when the farmer, Mr. Billings, came running down the path to meet him.
“He was pretty tall. He had a beard, though I suppose that wouldn’t help if you haven’t seen him since he was nine. He had light brown hair and blueish eyes.”
“Whatever you say. But don’t hesitate to let me know if you do need a paycheck.” Sherlock decided this Lestrade fellow was alright.
“Why don’t you get some sleep,” she said. “You’ll feel a little better in the morning.” Mycroft barely slept that night, and instead tossed and turned the whole time.
"Oh, hooray! I'm so excited!" Mrs. Hudson said as a smile spread across her face. "I'll go and get my stuff!" John wondered what he had gotten himself into.
“Okay, then, you can tip me if you like, but I don’t need a paycheck. And Sherlock is fine.” Lestrade was visibly confused. “My brother’s apparently arranged for a flat for me, so I don’t need to pay rent.” Lestrade nodded.
When school got out, Mycroft was the first to be picked up by Mummy, and then the two drove to fetch Sherlock. When they pulled up to the building, they were early, and had to wait a few minutes before kids started leaving. They couldn’t spot Sherlock anywhere. The kids were almost all gone, and yet Sherlock was nowhere to be found. Mycroft, suspecting the worse, entered the building. He walked as fast as he could (no running) down the halls, looking for his little brother. He was on the verge of losing it when suddenly, from the restrooms, he heard a really quiet sob.
After Christmas, Mummy and Daddy almost immediately started planning Sherlock’s first birthday party. They were very excited about it and so was Mycroft. On the invite list were Uncle Rudy, Billy, Grandma and Granddad (Grandmother and Grandfather were busy), and various friends of Mummy and Daddy. Mycroft would be in charge of making the cake, since he had done so well with helping make the Christmas treats.
Now that Sherlock could crawl, he and Mycroft could go almost anywhere. One sunny day in August (on which, somewhere in Aldershot, a little boy named John was celebrating his second birthday), Mycroft decided they should play in the garden. He put Sherlock’s little rubber boots on and carried him out to the grassy play area surrounded by vibrant flowers. He set the baby down to explore. As always, Sherlock was immediately drawn to the bright colors of the flowers. He crawled over and started grabbing them with his hands, pulling them closer to his eyes. He made his way over to the mint plant, which was surrounded by bees. Sherlock watched them, captivated by the buzzing.
“Woah, woah, woah, Mikey. Can I call you Mikey?,” interrupted Jim, putting a hand on Mycroft’s arm. He glared at Jim.
The rest of the week was filled with activity as the Holmes prepared for Christmas Day and with that, visitors. Uncle Rudy was coming, as were both sets of grandparents, and there was lots to be done. The house had to be cleaned, and it was so big that this was no easy feat. Mycroft was in charge of dusting and cleaning all the windows, and keeping an eye on Sherlock. It was exhausting, especially since Sherlock couldn’t help.
“Don’t be long,” answered Mum. “Dinner’s almost ready.” Sherlock nodded and continued on his way, lighting a cigarette as he went. He headed down the familiar path to Mr. Billings’ farm, walking quickly with an air of suppressed excitement. He hadn’t seen Redbeard since the summer holiday had ended, and he was desperate to see him again. It had been a long day. Before he reached the farm, he put out the cig and stamped it under his heels. No need to smoke around Redbeard. He jogged up to the door of the house and knocked. Mr. Billings opened the door and smiled widely.
One evening in March, the Holmes family was seated around the dinner table, Sherlock in a cradle in the next room.
“Oh, this will be fun!” Jim said as he grinned and ran over to them. The six walked down to the waves. When they reached the shoreline, Jim and Greg ran right in with no regards to the frigid temperature. Sherlock waded in not as eagerly but didn’t seem to mind the cold either. Molly shivered as she entered the water. John was even less inclined to the chilly waves this time than he was last time, and he was hopping and shivering before the water even went past his knees. Mycroft was the last one to go in, and only after additional coaxing from everybody else.
“Billy’s the only one who’d want to be friends with me. And he’s the only one I wanted to be friends with,” he added. Mummy didn’t know what to say.
“Then crouch lower so I can get up easier.” Sherlock obeyed and John reached his shoulders. He stood up a bit too quickly, though, and before John had secured his position.
“I will not, because I have nothing to admit to. I am doing actual science, and you just can’t understand it.”
“I don’t know. If you don’t take a paycheck, then your job won’t be official. So it’s new territory. We’ve never done this before. And the higher-ups can’t know about this, Sherlock.”
When he emerged from the bathroom, he found Sherlock struggling with the sunscreen. He had poured too much of it into his hands, and now his face was white as a marshmallow. He had splotches of white all along his arms where he’d tried to wipe off the excess lotion. His swimsuit was a small pair of purple shorts, and he’d thrown a black tee on over it. He had sunglasses perched on top of his head and was wearing bright green sandals. Sherlock was rubbing the lotion on his face in vain when he realized John had walked in.
"Well, I suppose I should see what the fuss is about." They began walking back to Bailey court, books in hand and the night sky pulsing with music above them. "But, I can't promise anything. Clubs are bound to be overcrowded on a Saturday..." He shuddered. "I might have to start off with a slow Monday."
?" Holmes appeared disgusted; his white upper lip pulled taut over his teeth. "I should think Keats would make existence feel all the more stagnant."
It's Sherlock's turn to change expression. It darkens. "John, mononucleosis can last from two weeks to months at a time."
"Please," he continued, strained, "just know that you mean more to me than you can possibly fathom."
"Sherlock?" he questioned nervously, taking his friend's chips from him as the shaking increased. "Sherlock, what -"
"John!" the detective practically wails, flapping his arms pathetically. The man himself looks up tiredly from where he was falling asleep in the arm chair. "
"Shit," John breathed, ignoring him. "It's fine. Don't worry, we'll be out in a minute." Sherlock shook his head, closing his eyes against the advancing walls.
Despite this, the third dream was the worst of all. John didn't know what it meant, couldn't decipher the words spilling from the detective's lips in this drugged haze, but the context was completely irrelevant. Because no matter what explanation the universe offered to give, the simple fact of the matter was that Sherlock, the stoic, impenetrable detective, was crying. His whole body was wracked as huge, ugly tears streamed onto the sheets, and John could do nothing but watch as Sherlock keened into his own arm, lips shuddering over words of protest and a single, inexplicable name.
The news came in the early afternoon that Sherlock had slipped into a coma. John had stood there, frozen, for far too long - far longer than socially acceptable - and he only just about gathered his wits enough to ask why. The doctor's face had been grave, and John could almost read the answers in the little lines on his face -
It took everything the medical student had not to run from the ward – he hoped that when his real training began, he wasn't this weak-willed – and he restrained the urge to recoil when he took Sherlock's cool hand in his own. He looked nothing like the man he'd first met, all charm and wit, dark hair curling around alabaster flesh like an ink pen on fresh, thick parchment. His skin seemed almost transparent now, more off-white than the sheets, and his hair limp as it sat plastered to his forehead, which throbbed with fever.
"It used to be quite serious," Mycroft said solemnly, leaning back onto his desk. "Often his attacks would land him in hospital - when the inhaler wasn't enough."
"Look at the bloody carpet!" Sherlock yells, before regretting the increase in volume. He swallows against a churning nausea.
Mycroft frowned as he observed his mother placing Sherlock's empty dish into the sink. The little boy kicked his brother's shins and screamed until a second serving was placed in front of him.
DISCLAIMER: Many people have asked this question and CONTINUE to ask this question so before you start fretting - blood glucose is measured differently in the UK than it is in the US. I am British, like Sherlock, so have followed British measurements. Normal blood glucose levels are between 4.0 mmol/L and 8.0 mmol/L in British terms. 1.2 mmol/L is thus a plausible blood sugar level, and I have even witnessed a friend at this level and still (surprisingly) conscious. Thank you for your time.
John looked at his flatmate, who was pacing along the opposite wall and fiddling with his gloves. "Sherlock?"
Light had begun seeping through the window, an eerie, bluish hue, when Sherlock's breathing finally calmed and they drifted into a much-needed slumber.
The doctor met his gaze a little sharply, letting his book fall slowly into his lap. "Holmes," he breathed, "whatever for?"
"Sherlock," he shouted back, sighing in relief when he heard the door come loose. It swung open and everyone instinctively leant towards the fresh air. Two paramedics came in with a stretcher and an oxygen mask, and John helped them load him on. Once outside in the sunlight, the detective began blinking, ghostly pale face turning towards his flatmate in confusion.
"A mugging gone wrong," John finishes for him, frowning. "You don't normally call him out for this kind of stuff."
He'd caught it early, at least. He was only really on the cusp of extensive stage SCLC when he'd sought help – at his brother's request. Mycroft had even accompanied him when he was summoned to discuss the results of his CT scan. Had sat next to him whilst Dr. Wilson – an experienced, private oncologist his brother had found – explained that his nausea, unprecedented weight loss, and concentrated urine were not in fact, related to kidney malfunction at all, despite appearances. Instead, he was experiencing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or SIADH – a direct result of the small, oat-like malignant cells clotting the spaces in his lungs.
Sherlock points to the window, where a weak sunlight streams in. "The sun hits this carpet every day. Its light causes the carpet to fade in colour-" he gestures to the area in front of them, and then to the sofa. "See here? The carpet next to the sofa is considerably brighter than that of the rest of the room. That's because the sofa usually sits on top of it; but as the victim fell and hit the sofa, it was moved." Anderson can't help but gawp as Sherlock pulls off his gloves with a snap. "The victim didn't know her killer. She was taken by surprise from someone behind her-" Sherlock stands next to the sofa and demonstrates someone pushing him from behind. "She didn't know who it was. But I do."
"You get to help out on cases again," John finishes for him, nodding. "Sounds like a reasonable plan to me."
I'd also like you to practice high-levels of self-care. Eat regularly – you need to restore your weight. Drink plenty of fluids and replace electrolytes to help sustain your kidneys, which will be at risk of long-term effects following chemo. And..." He flicked through a file, contemplative. "You were a smoker, correct?" Sherlock nodded. "Right. Well, smoking already puts you at risk for stroke, heart disease, chronic bronchitis – you understand. Chemotherapy increases these risks. It is imperative you make healthy lifestyle choices from now on."
"I'm just -" the brunette hissed through his teeth, sucking in air as if it were sparse. "Catching, my breath -"
"Do you remember the last time you ate?" Lestrade asks, and the detective faces him again. There is Gary, to his rescue again, catching him as he collapses like some woozy maiden. He's angry at himself for letting this happen, especially in front of a handful of the police force. Not that it would be the first time. "It's none of your business," he snaps, but his voice is weak and has less bite behind it than he would've liked. Lestrade rolls his eyes, and John clenches his teeth, irritated.
"Alright," he replied, and felt his body, detached, rise from the chair. He also heard himself say something resembling thanks, but he wasn't sure if he truly meant it. And as he stood, Mycroft's gentle hand at his elbow, he took in the office for the first time; the collection of smiling photos on the wall, the thank you notes pinned to a large corkboard, the awards trapped behind the glass of a small cabinet. And he thought, with every life saved, there had to be some lives lost. But they weren't here. They weren't immortalised on Dr. Wilson's wall. They were numbers, lost in spreadsheets, buried deep in medical records – and in sod.
John knew he had weaknesses - cocaine being one, and, of course, his tendency to fall very ill on rare occasions. The doctor was thankful that these were, as said, rare.
Holmes had gone to rest that night, unusually early, but Watson was kept up until dawn by both his own concern and Holmes' consistent hacking in the room below. The moment the morning light crept over the edge of his bedroom, Watson threw his bedclothes aside and, straightening his flannel nightshirt, ventured down to the detective's quarters.
Sherlock swallowed slowly, standing a little shakily on his knees. "It tends to trigger it, yes, but -"
"The dust?" John supplied unhelpfully, standing to his feet. The hiss of his medicine whistled through the air, but still Sherlock struggled. John kneeled beside him, pushing his shoulders back and straightening his neck. "Don't panic. It'll only make it worse."
Sherlock sat underneath the bookshelf, surrounded by thick and dusty novels. "I wanted the medical journals at the top," he explained, motioning to the chair on it's side. "The chair wasn't stable."
Sherlock groaned, storming over to kick the opposite wall. It was only a single pace away - the bathroom was quite small. And with all of them crammed in it, it was even smaller.
John sighed. "Sherlock's sick. Really sick. His fever's over forty and he won't stop vomiting. I need to clean him up and get his fever down but I can't carry him to the bathroom. I really really could use a hand."
Lestrade had phoned about the case, but upon hearing of his consulting detective's condition, sent well wishes and joked about Sherlock always somehow landing himself in trouble. John had laughed humourlessly.
John sighed, his breath shuddering, and stood. His friend, usually larger than life itself, looked so small amongst the bedsheets. The doctor tucked the duvet up to the detective's ears and smiled fondly as Sherlock smacked his chapped lips, before standing to brew himself a much needed cup of tea.
"Oh, no, Sherlock –" she pushed herself up onto her knees, at a loss. The Holmes' brothers rarely ever showed emotion, although it wasn't hard to tell that Sherlock was the more passionate of the two. They were private, stoic people, and to cry so openly –
"I'm not going back to bed," John snapped, shoving the glass of water into the detective's hands. He sighed. "Try and get some sleep."
It had been a worst-case scenario, coming down one morning to find him twisted in the throes of a violent fever. He was too immunocompromised, and Baker Street, no matter how many times Molly scrubbed it clean, was no longer sufficient. She had immediately called an ambulance, and held his hand whilst they waited for its arrival.
What confirmed his suspicions, though, was when Mycroft marched his way into 221B, with his younger brother's arm thrown haphazardly over his shoulder.
John scoffs and tries not to jump the man - he's been marching after him for around nine hours with little sleep or food. He doesn't know how Sherlock survives on so little sustenance; John can feel the energy seeping from his pores by the second.
"I don't want to –" he coughed deeply, the air rattling noisily in his lungs. She tried to pull away again, but he held firm. "Please," he said eventually, red-rimmed eyes wide and imploring. "I don't want to die in a hospital, Molly."
Sherlock wrinkled his nose, disgusted. "It proudly advertises that it's the worst club in Europe – but somehow, it's everyone's favourite?"
Sherlock broke out in a cold sweat, and his lips started to chap in fear. He threw one of his hands out and moaned - John caught his fingers between his own, frowning. The detective turned meekly onto his side, curling up just a fraction. "No, please," he slurred, digging his nails into John's palm. "Hurts..."
"I don't like showing weakness," he muttered, playing with the collar of his shirt. "And I know, at times, my anger at the situation hurt you. And my callousness – it was all, uh, a defence. I just wanted you to know that not a second went by that I didn't – that I don't – appreciate you."
"No, they don't, they shouldn't-" he's interrupted by a pair of chapped lips on his- the kiss is brief, but it's the best kiss John's ever experienced. It's simple, it's silent- and it's glorious.
"He grew out of it, somewhat. It doesn't ail him so much anymore, but it can become, difficult, around the winter months."
Sherlock huffs, clenching his fists. "The sofa's been moved. It was shifted when she fell against it- after the killer pushed her down."
admitted to feeling under the weather. However, when John saw Sherlock looked somewhat chipper the next day, he dismissed his suspicions and proceeded to feed Rosie some form of puréed banana and pear, a concoction Sherlock had premeditated would end up mostly down his shirt.
, but even he knew how useless his advice would be. Sherlock was lost in a hurricane of confusion and fear, the air - if he was even getting any - barely making even a sound against his lips.
"Don't speak, Holmes," he said firmly, grasping his hand tighter. "It is not needed. I know what it is you want to say."
"For everything you have done," the man continued, "both in the last few months, with this awful sickness, and even before then."
"It's too small in here for three of us," he said eventually, setting the glass, half-empty, down on the white tile. "You two should leave – I'm going to shower."
"Thank you," he said seriously, meeting her gaze over the washed-out hood. "I – I really mean it, Molly. I know it must have been difficult, looking after me."
Sherlock panted, swaying slightly. John almost dropped the chips as he moved to steady him. "I'm fine, John -" another harsh breath, "- just, fine." The detective straightened, heaving in a deeper volume of air before setting his jaw. John stared, bewildered, unsure how to respond. Luckily, Sherlock filled the silence with something like, "must've forgotten to breathe, or, something," and John wanted to point out how ridiculous that was, but Sherlock had already disappeared into the kitchen and scraped two plates together in a rather whimsical fashion.
John was a medical man, after all - he would surely figure it out. Nevertheless, as the elder Holmes left the flat, he stopped briefly, and turned to look affectionately at the long line of his brother's sleeping form upon the sofa. "Look after him, Dr. Watson," he ordered carefully, before sweeping silently from the room.
Holmes lost his smile, turning again to stare into the fire. "Surely you know," he said lowly, pulling his robe tighter across his thin frame. "You must. I am not certain how I should articulate it, otherwise."
John nodded, understanding. "I know what you mean." And God, did he. Despite the masses of lads he drank with, and the innumerable girls he flirted at, he could not remember a single person's name, nor did he ever want to socialise with any of them for a second time. He'd briefly introduced himself to the other boys on his corridor, but none of them seemed interested, and quite frankly, neither was he – at the moment, university seemed a lot bleaker than he had hoped.
), salad, and other normal, nutritious fares. He put the bread and crackers in the top left cupboard, and thought long and painfully about how this was no longer 221B Baker Street.
The house was modest, and warm; the parlour held a boisterous fireplace, and the large wooden beams and thick stone walls did well to shut out the cool rains and chilled nights. For a few weeks, Holmes did seem to improve. The country air invigorated him, and his complexion began to adopt a healthier tone. For the first time throughout this whole ordeal, Watson wondered if there was still a chance the detective might be one of the luckier few.
"I hope you don't mind semi-skimmed," he said lightly. "Didn't think to call ahead and ask for a preference. Bought a green one out of habit – it's what the wife likes."
Sherlock looked up calmly, his pale jaw framed gorgeously by his navy roll-neck. John swallowed convulsively when their eyes met over his sloppy plate of green beans. "John Watson," he greeted coquettishly, and the shorter man blanched.
If John really concentrated, he knew it started a month or so previously. Over his newspaper one evening, he had observed that Sherlock looked pale and drawn, his eyes slightly glassy and fatigued. Now, they had just finished a physically demanding case, and so at first John put it down to exhaustion - but when Sherlock took wearily to his feet, informing John that he in fact did not feel well and was going to lie down, the good doctor knew there was something quite wrong. Sherlock
"I'm fine," Sherlock croaked, and John huffed a laugh. He rushed off to grab his friend a glass of water, placing it carefully on the surface beside him and looking on endearingly as the brunette's eyes drooped. And then, without a single thought about what people might say, he climbed into the space beside him and settled down for a restless night.
Stumbling from his bed, John pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, groaning as the room lurched violently around him. He picked his way through dirty laundry – and a tiara that he was ninety per cent certain
"You should go home for now, let this all sink in." The doctor smiled gently, and it suited him well. "We'll start treatment on this ward at nine thirty tomorrow morning."
"Sherlock-" He laid him on his back, slapping his cheek. "Come on, wake up." He looked up at Sally. "Good timing. Call a bloody ambulance."
"Sherlock -" The detective dropped his reliever and it hit the floor with a dull thud. His shoulders began to hunch again, and the doctor was struggling to hold him up. He wanted to tell the detective to
It would become apparent, in the following week, that the small improvements in Holmes' demeanour had been deceptive.
The first time John experienced one of Sherlock's asthma attacks it was in a predictable situation - during a chase. Both doctor and detective were weaving in and out of the London streets when Sherlock hurled himself against a wall; flattening his back against it and letting his legs slide from beneath him until he was sat, white and panting, on the floor.
John reached a hand up and brushed the detective's hair back, uneasy. "Sherlock?" The man in question whined. "Are you in pain?" It was then that his friend retched, shoulders hunching as he dribbled onto the bed. "Oh..." John reached up with a flannel and wiped down his face. Sherlock mumbled incoherently, turning into the cool cloth.
by Nuland is sticking out of your bag – it's a common tome on the 'suggested reading' list for medical students."
"Good news," the doctor began, and both Sherlock and Molly instantly relaxed. "As you know, the CT scan we took following your second cycle showed a positive response to the treatment, and it appears as though that was consistent. As of today, there are no visible signs of cancer on your imaging."
The next time he saw him was at lunch the next day, scooping mashed potato onto his plate. It was better than the boiled potatoes from the day before, but still didn't quite beat Friday's chips – he shuffled along the queue, ignoring the other student's protests. "I'm beginning to wonder if they know how to cook anything else."
Sherlock is silent for a moment, and then he looks his flatmate straight in the eyes. "What else do best friends do?"
For those of you starting university this September, please, please remember to have your meningitis vac.
It felt like dawn would never come. Sherlock spent most the night laid back and wheezing, sitting up when John instructed and drinking water when a glass was brought to his mouth. He remained silent mostly, but every now and then would mention something about how "It isn't usually this bad," or "Go to bed, John," the latter always shot down with a simple glare from the doctor concerned. At one point, John phoned Mycroft, asking if there was anything that would help. "Mummy used to use a humidifier," he said, something different in his tone. "I don't imagine he has one?"
"Sherlock?" No response. John wiped over his face, hoping the cool water would rouse him. "Come back to me mate."
Sherlock clambers out of the car unsteadily, keeping his eyes shielded with one hand as he shuffles towards 221B. Mrs Hudson answers the door and ushers them inside immediately upon seeing Sherlock, tutting about him needing to take better care of himself while watching him with a concerned gaze and soft expression. The stairs are a struggle, but Lestrade only needs to steady him once; upon entering the flat, the detective takes himself to the bedroom, collapsing messily on the bed without bothering to shut the door.
"You've been really poorly," he told him in soft tones when he had finally calmed down. "Really poorly. God, you scared me half to death." He pointed at the tubes. "You're still going to need all these for a bit."
Sherlock swallowed thickly, fidgeting in his chair. His chances were less than a third. Less than a third that he might, if lucky, simply prolong his life; put death out of sight but not out of mind; die, regardless, but with a delay?
Getting Sherlock into the police car hadn't been so difficult - with Lestrade's help they managed to shove the lanky detective into the back seat with only minimal head bumping - the real problem began soon after they pulled up to the flat. John had just balanced Sherlock on one shoulder - Lestrade taking charge of the other - when his friend groaned miserably, feet dragging and eyes still resolutely shut.
A nurse intercepted them a few paces before they could reach the ICU. John hadn't even noticed they were almost there, distracted by his musings.
It was in this moment that John Watson realised that, perhaps, Sherlock Holmes would die. And John wasn't sure that, if this happened, he could risk ever making a friend here again.
“Well, you seemed nice, and you like superheroes, too,” he said, noticing the edge of a comic book poking out of Bill’s bag.
“Sherlock! You’re bigger than me, you can’t go on top! Stand still.” John tried to climb up, though he wasn’t very graceful.
“Go into the sitting room,” he said to his parents. “I’ll be right in.” They obeyed, and, with a last, hopeful look at the toddler, Mycroft followed them in. After a few minutes of expectant waiting, the pattering noise could be heard in the kitchen. A few seconds later, Sherlock waddled in slowly in search of Mycroft, immediately dropping to the ground on seeing his parents.
That night, Mycroft slept in the guest bedroom. It was his last night at home, and he was eager to leave and pursue the challenge of running the country. Well. Not really. He couldn’t reveal that to be his intention if he was aiming for a small position. That would look suspicious. While Mycroft was pondering how to go about getting that position, Sherlock was thinking about how exciting it would be to be out of Mycroft’s shadow, and to have the run of the house.
“Why did nobody tell me about Redbeard?” he said harshly, jerking his head up suddenly to look them in the eye. Both parents looked down at their plates, ashamed.
When they reached the house, the lights were low, and the ones in Lestrade’s room were completely off.
“I expected a bit more,” agreed Dad. “So, Sherlock, I wanted to talk to you.” He sat down on Mycroft’s bed and waved him over to sit next to him.
“Thanks. Um, see you soon, I guess.” Sherlock smiled at him before turning around to drive back to campus. He was exhausted by all the emotions of the day. He wondered what Victor thought of him being gay. They didn’t really talk about it after he asked, given the circumstances. Sherlock hoped he wouldn’t be put off by it.
“Nope,” said John, shaking his head and smiling. Myron sat back down with the new album and opened it up to the first page. Mrs. Holmes was in a hospital bed with a bundle of blankets in her arms. She was smiling, though she looked very tired. Sherlock’s face was just visible under the blankets, and his eyes were squeezed shut. He was sleeping peacefully. John turned the page, and it was Mr. and Mrs. Holmes with Sherlock in the car, ready to drive home. Then there were a couple photos of just Sherlock in the car seat. Turn the page. Mrs. Holmes, carrying baby Sherlock, was walking through the door into the hall, where seven-year old Mycroft was waiting, visibly excited to see his new baby brother. A couple shots of him peering into the seat, and poking Sherlock with his finger. Just then, the front door opened and in strode Mycroft himself.
One week later, they were in the car driving to Musgrave Hall in Surrey, nine week-old Rosie in a bucket seat in the back. She had been home with them for a week, after spending the first eight weeks of her life with her mother, Mary, in prison. She’d been arrested for shooting Sherlock and Magnussen while she was still pregnant, but Mycroft put her in a prison with a nursery for the baby, and allowed her to go to doctor’s appointments and had driven her to the hospital when it was time to give birth. Most prisons aren’t so accommodating, but when you’re Mycroft, you can do practically whatever you (or your brother and his boyfriend) want. Mary got to spend eight weeks with Rosie before giving her to her father to take care of. Sherlock was very excited when Rosie came home, and spent the next hour trying to talk to her as if she understood. He had talked about her new home at Baker Street, and about nice old Mrs. Hudson downstairs. John has lots of pictures of their conversation.
“Mikey,” he’d say at first eagerly, but as time went on it turned into more of a question. Mycroft felt bad ignoring his brother like that, but he really didn’t feel like playing.
