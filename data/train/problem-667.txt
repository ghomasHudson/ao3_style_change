"Twenty days? The longest session I've heard of is sixteen," Dague-Ross said with surprise.
"Tea?" He calls over his shoulder.
As an afterthought, he composes a text, "Please come home. I miss you."
John groans softly, rubbing the heel of his hand harder against his erection.
"I know," Sherlock whispered.
"Sherlock, please-"
"You followed me?" John says, stunned.
"Mmm. I was working through my grief, I guess. Still angry at you, subconsciously punishing you."
never expected to want a man.
"Sorry to be a pain," John mutters sarcastically.
"Maybe I don't want to leave anything undone," John says. "Leave anything unsaid."
"Use your imagination, John."
"I don't have that switch in my head," John says. "I can't just turn off... the way I feel about you."
When he points this out, Sherlock smirks and says something about liking to see John on his knees, which makes John blush bright pink, stumble over his own feet and then flee the room, Sherlock's amused gaze and Lestrade's shocked one following him.
"Shall I go on?"
"Could we... could we have this?" John said, looking up at Sherlock, having moved in close to him.
"It's not."
, John. Not everything is about
"You what?" John laughs nervously.
It's John's turn to sigh. A bored Sherlock Holmes is never a good thing.
"You did, you kissed him," Sherlock says, moving to sit in his chair but not taking his eyes off John. "Not just a kiss, a proper
"I didn't know," John murmured against the back of Sherlock's neck in between lazy kisses.
"I wasn't cold, I just needed to focus."
"No condom," Sherlock whispered. "Please."
"What're you doing in my bed?" John asks, knowing he'll regret his question. "Experiment?"
"Mara Kint, always a pleasure," Lestrade said with a rakish grin.
"Especially with women," John murmured against Sherlock's flesh.
"You can't make me leave, Sherlock. You can't make me leave you. Who would look after Rosie?"
"Fucking hell, Sherlock!"
"You... you want me too?" John sees the ‘
John kept fucking him hard for a few more seconds then breathed out, barely audible, "Oh fucking hell, Sherlock, I'm close. I'm so close.
"Guess," he breathes.
Sherlock's eyes roamed all over John's body, taking in the play of flickering firelight and shadow, the creases of his brow. As he watched, John reached up, grabbing at the leg of the desk, and pushed down, taking Sherlock's cock to the hilt with a long low groan.
Then a small voice in the back of his mind (which, incidentally, sounds rather a lot like Sherlock) says,
"Where are you going?"
Sherlock immediately thrust into the channel of John's fingers, almost dislodging John's cock from him.
John frowns more deeply, his eyes involuntarily closing as Sherlock dips his head and scrapes his teeth against the stubble on his neck. He tries to suppress a shudder, but Sherlock knows, he knows him. Every pin-point accurate touch is like fire coursing through his body and he's powerless to resist the heat between them.
"Right. Of course."
"I'm knackered, mate," John says as soon as they get inside the flat (and he puts the emphasis on mate, as in friend, as in completely non-sexual platonic companion), "I'm off to bed."
"Exceedingly so," Sherlock said. "I feel like myself again, at 221B, with you."
"I expect you to stay," Sherlock says without hesitation, pulling back to look down at John. "Stay with me."
He's always found him intriguing, he freely admits, but he'd never laid awake in bed thinking about him until recently. Probably a side effect of Sherlock's startlingly sudden interest in him.
"Stop it," John said.
Sherlock stretched out on the couch, his arms above his head, pointing his toes, his back cracking noisily. John watched with his slice of toast halfway to his mouth, forgotten for a moment, before blinking and looking away. Sherlock didn't miss his reaction, getting a gentle buzz from the attention.
"Bored," replies Sherlock.
"Then I’m sure he’ll be home soon," Mycroft says with finality, as though he's just solved the problem.
John’s more confused by the thanks than by anything which has come before.
"Sherlock..."
John's eyes are squeezed closed and his voice is low and harsh as he breathes into the phone, "I'm so hard for you, Sherlock.
"You've slept?" Sherlock says, surprised.
Sherlock is reclined on the sofa, staring intently at his mobile, completely ignoring John's presence.
John smiles. "Yeah, you're a bit rubbish, aren't you?"
John shakes his head quickly. "Not true."
"Thank you." John pulled back entirely and rested on his knees on the bed.
"Ah, excellent, you're home," he says, the expression on his face a little too sunny as he lovingly places his violin back in its case. "Did you have a pleasant evening?"
Sherlock pulls back to look at John, his eyes searching his face, his mouth a tense, straight line. He examines John for only a couple of seconds before relaxing.
. But you have to let us go."
John swallowed and smiled a little, looking up into Sherlock's eyes.
John pushed Sherlock's thighs up, folding him in half. Sherlock flushed, a little horrified at how exposed this new position left him. John let out a long, blowing breath, the cool air chilling the sweaty skin between Sherlock's legs. Sherlock looked down at him and John met his eye.
Sherlock pulled abruptly away from John, then shoved back a little too hard, causing them both to whimper.
Sherlock smiles at John and his smile is returned, John's expression unguarded, radiating warmth.
"If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm not about to tell you."
"Don't stop," Sherlock ordered.
into it. And I
"Of course."
Sherlock blinked, a cold shock hitting his system at John's bluntness.
"I would very much like to kiss you," Gabe practically purrs.
"John—wait!" Mara said, but it was too late, John was gone.
The facsimile of Sherlock moved quickly, going to his knees in front of John. Sherlock watched as the virtual Sherlock cupped John's face in his hands.
"Silly boy," she said. "Silly, silly boy."
Sherlock leans against the doorjamb, awkwardly, his eyes narrowing as he studies John.
Buried halfway inside Sherlock, John stilled with a shudder.
jealous, in a way, but I'm also grateful that you had him."
John wordlessly passed Sherlock the second hashbrown, just as he always had when he got himself a McDonald's... before. It felt like a victory, an acceptance.
"Tell me what you're doing, Sherlock."
"That's who John escaped with, in the Reverie," Mara said.
When he goes downstairs later to rustle up something for dinner, Sherlock is nowhere to be seen. John isn’t sure whether the sigh he breathes is one of relief or disappointment.
"Do you want me to kiss you, John?" Sherlock says, his voice low and soft.
"I'll bear that in mind," he murmured, looking at them both fondly.
"You don't need to, John. You're an open book to me. I can read the sordid tale, writ large, all over your face."
Sherlock lets out a long, low groan into the phone and John finds himself holding his breath as he listens. His friend gasps his name over and over again as he comes and John closes his eyes, biting his bottom lip, savouring every shuddering moan.
"Oh god, John..."
When they made their way slowly up the stairs and into the sitting room, John immediately zeroed in on the pillows and blanket folded at the end of the couch.
John shook his head and looked away, clenching his jaw, looking pained. Sherlock looked like he immediately regretted what he'd said and wanted to take it back, but didn't know how. Mara gasped in a quiet breath as she put two and two together.
"You always go commando?" John breathed, kicking his jeans the rest of the way off.
"Anything?" John breathes, his body tingling, energised.
"No, Sherlock. Just... Just no, okay?"
"John," Sherlock said. "Please don't change your mind."
"I just want things to go back to the way they were," John says, frowning. "Before all this. Well. Things were good. We got along great, everything was comfortable."
"You should have roused me," Sherlock said. "I could have made your breakfast."
John took the head of Sherlock's cock into his mouth again, teasing the tip of his tongue through the slit.
"No, we bloody can't!"
"We are, John, I promise you. I just need some time to adjust. This isn't... easy."
"If I were real," Reverie Sherlock said, "I would make a threat of some kind here."
"Yeah, I figured, strike while the iron's hot. No time like the present, and all that," John says, smiling.
"Mycroft, get your techs back in here. It didn't work."
All too soon, John was pulling him off, Sherlock fighting against John's grip, hissing as John pulled his hair harder, his body feeling energised by the struggle.
John slapped Sherlock's arse gently and walked off toward the bathroom. Sherlock followed, revelling in seeing John stark naked, walking around like that was something they did all the time. Once they were cleaned up, John went into the bedroom and Sherlock went via the kitchen to get John a glass of water.
"Yeah, I think I am."
"The day we met, that day at Bart’s, looked into your eyes, I looked into
"I assumed it was just me. I'm rather special, don't you know."
"It's your back," John said. "I'm only a doctor, what do I know?"
"Thanks," John said, his voice a little rough, his pupils dilated.
"I can't
"You're familiar with the technology?"
"-No, it's fine, Sherlock, I get it. You don't need to explain."
"You... colossal
"I didn't mean just
When he walked back into his bedroom, John was in his bed. Naked. Post-coital. Smiling. Beckoning him. Loving him. It was so much like the Reverie it was almost surreal, but this time he knew—this was
"You like that?" John asked, his voice rough with desire.
The John in his arms groaned softly and kissed him back, opening beautifully to him, holding him closer, giving him something he'd never thought he'd have, an aching desire carefully hidden and cherished in secret. The kiss became more, possessive, Sherlock making the most of a chance he'd never have again, pressing John down on the bed and tasting his jaw, his neck, the hollow between his collarbones, before returning to his lips for one final, sweet caress.
"Good to be home?" John said.
With a fond chuckle, John moved to stand at the end of the bed, pushed his pants down and kicked them off. His cock, standing erect and proud from his body, bounced with the movement and Sherlock took his own cock in hand, squeezing and stroking it as he watched John move, unable to resist the impulse, legs still splayed wide on the bed. His body was still trembling slightly, his pale, pale skin flushed pink in patches, his hair darkened with sweat and stuck to his forehead.
Gabe immediately snakes his hand around behind John’s neck and pulls him close, taking his lips in a gentle but hungry kiss. John responds enthusiastically, surprising even himself, bunching his hands in the front of Gabe’s expensive black silk shirt.
Sherlock's mouth went dry. John had never looked at him like that in anything but his mind's eye.
"Do let me know when he makes an appearance, won't you? I'd rather that I didn't have to look for him myself. Leg work, you understand," he says, his nose wrinkling delicately with distaste.
me," Sherlock murmurs in the voice John associates with nakedness and closeness and heat.
"Sherlock, shh."
"Being so
Sherlock licked his lips quickly, his eyes lingering on John's toned torso, then shook his head once. John's eyes narrowed as he looked at Sherlock's face, really looked. Sherlock felt more than a little flayed open by John's examination of him. The thought passed through his mind that this must be how others feel when he observes them. He allowed the scrutiny, wanting John to see it all.
you."
be fine with what you did."
He crosses the room, still frowning, still angry, but curious. His pillow has a few stray dark hairs on it. The sheet is creased most in the middle, where Sherlock must have been lying.
"What is it, then?"
"And what? That’s all I’ve got," John says, frowning a little.
, I fucking
blew up a
Sherlock chuckles quietly, delighted. "Oh, don't apologise. I'm quite enjoying myself."
"And that won’t happen if I stay?" John says, his voice low and dangerous, staring Sherlock down. "I’ll take my chances with ‘Gabe’ any day."
"Oh yes."
John swallows thickly, then throws caution to the wind and murmurs, "Tell me."
"Oh my fucking god,
When Mara located John and Sherlock, it was in a small Thai restaurant on a sidestreet in darkest London. They were sharing a meal and the smile died on John's face when he saw Mara in the doorway. His companion's head whipped around to see what the cause of the expression change was, and his eyes swept up and down her form in much the same way as John's had, earlier.
Tea made, Sherlock returned to John, placing the mug on his side table and settling into his own armchair with an unintentional, satisfied sigh. John smiled a little, watching him.
"Bullshit."
"That's exactly the way I thought you meant, actually," John says, frowning deeply. "I thought we were a team. I thought... I don't know what I thought anymore."
John squeezed Sherlock's hand as hard as he could, trying to ground himself in the moment, trying to convince himself that Sherlock was telling him the truth. Sherlock covered their hands with his other one, squeezing back.
"A Czech sniper known as 'Bezcitný'," Sherlock murmured. "Means 'heartless'."
"Deal."
"I don't think I can."
When he rounds a corner and finds Sherlock leaning against a wall, he isn't even slightly surprised. The mind-reading sociopath hadn’t followed him, but had deduced where he would run to instead, of course he had. He'd known where John's subconscious would lead him. He knew that he'd purposefully avoid the obvious route and had worked out the route he'd take instead.
"How?" Alexis asked.
He falls asleep on the second night, on the couch, with his phone still clutched in his hand, the message unsent. He wakes up the next morning with his phone gently cradled against his cricked neck and Mycroft Holmes regarding him coolly from the armchair across the room.
His bed was unmade. There was an empty glass on the bedside table, along with a chapstick and John's phone charger, the phone still plugged in. Numerous medical machines were lined up at the sides of the bed. This was clearly where John had been sleeping, and also where he'd used Reverie.
"I can't, I have to work," she found herself saying, wondering even as the words were leaving her lips why she was bothering to apologise to a simulated man.
Sherlock kisses John for a long time after that. How could he not? When they finally pause for breath, they have lost two hours, three buttons between them and John’s phone somewhere in the couch. John is on his back, pressed into the seat of the couch with Sherlock lying atop him, their legs tangled and their lips tingling. John has learned that Sherlock’s body is not nearly so bony, uncomfortable and cold as he’d thought it would be – quite the opposite, actually - and Sherlock has made the surprising discovery about himself that he enjoys cuddling and being cuddled, although he would deny it if anyone asked him. They lie there together, catching their breath, lips brushing softly every now and then, sharing a smile upon catching one another’s eye.
... let my arms out of the covers."
John merely looked at him.
"Oh god," John murmurs, feeling a sharp spike of ashamed lust course through him.
"All right," John said and slowly withdrew his fingers from Sherlock's grasping, pinkened hole.
John walks out, stomping up the stairs. Sherlock stares blankly at the empty kitchen, wondering how he could possibly have missed all of this.
"I'm off, out," John calls to Sherlock on his way down the stairs, later that evening.
"I’ll requite you
"And once I got past the initial mortification, knowing you'd had a sexual side brought out a whole new level of regret for me."
He couldn't understand how this was happening, why the program had put him in a fantasy of his own creation, rather than taking him to John's Reverie. He could only assume something had gone wrong. Suddenly he understood how Reverie had proven so addictive for so many users. He could stay here, with this version of John, in this perfect world where he was loved and could love in return, forever.
"You'll never be able to keep me out," Sherlock murmurs, "but you'll also never want to..."
"All right," Reverie Sherlock said, and released John's hand.
"I’ve been thinking about you," Sherlock informs him, holding John's sheet and blankets and therefore, body, down tightly.
"You're right. We should probably take things slow. Work up to full penetrative intercourse."
"Yes," Sherlock says simply, his voice lower and huskier than usual as he lets go of John’s cock and shuffles back slightly, his eyes burning into John’s.
." The message to Mycroft sits in his outbox, unable to be sent, number not recognised. Typical.
"Please," Sherlock repeats, softer.
"No, John," Sherlock said. "If I've proven anything, it's that I can't be trusted near you, half-asleep in my bed."
John moved quickly, his whisky glass dropping to the floor and smashing against the fire's hearth as he swooped on Sherlock, slipping a hand into the hair at the back of his head and taking his lips in a fierce kiss. It was nothing like the kiss they'd shared in Reverie, no gentleness, no holding back, it was unbridled, violent—John licking into Sherlock's mouth, biting at his lips, hurting in his desperation to devour him.
’ like he did in the shower, on the phone, in John’s head every night. Make Sherlock stop ignoring him.
He turned on his heel and walked briskly away, his taller colleague falling into step beside him. Mara tried to follow and was stopped by a handsome, somewhat worn-out looking, silver-haired police detective.
"I'm not sorry I saved your life," Sherlock said quietly, looking down at his hands. "I am sorry that I didn't realise how I'd hurt you."
"Change tactics, how? He seems pretty intent on avoiding you until he... dies," Paul said.
The intubation stayed in place for the first day. John's first words to Sherlock after the initial joy of reunion were spelt out by painstakingly writing the individual letters on the palm of Sherlock's hand with a shaking fingertip.
"This is what I want, John," Sherlock breathed against the shaft, still looking up at him. "You, desperate for my mouth, writhing under me, begging me, whimpering my name..."
"Sort of, yeah. And then the program just brought you back to me out of the blue. I didn't request it. Didn't program it," John said. "The system just took all the data about my life and resurrected you."
John closes his eyes, leaning with one hand against the fridge door, rubbing his forehead with the other. "What did you do to it?"
"She turned out to be... not what she appeared. But she gave me Rosie."
"Not for the first time tonight, either. I think you should help me with it, since you were the cause," Sherlock murmurs, pushing his hips against John's thigh. "I think it's only fair."
I need-"
They rut against one another in the half-light, groaning and groping and devouring each other. John’s whole body craves Sherlock like a drug, like sustenance, like something he can’t be without. He wants to devour Sherlock, wants Sherlock inside him in the most urgent, desperate way, in a way he’s never felt before. He wants Sherlock in his blood, in his muscles, pumping through his veins, in his mouth, and in a place he
"No!"
, he enjoys the hell out of it.
"Take me somewhere nice and you might change that," John adds after a moment.
"I don't know what you're talking about," John says, his voice flat as he pushes back from the table and stands. "
The longer the silence goes on, the more John feels like he should say something, anything. He turns his head to look at Sherlock, and then turns his body to lie on his side, just watching him in silence. John is just starting to think Sherlock has nodded off when he turns his head toward John, his eyes still closed. He slowly opens his eyes and John feels a sharp spike of lust through his gut as Sherlock's lazy, sensual gaze settles upon him.
close..."
"Don't they find it... filthy?"
The rest of the cab ride passes in merciful, if somewhat tense, silence.
"Nope," John agrees, with a happy sigh. "Maybe next time."
John started physiotherapy that day, Sherlock at a loose end, hanging around the hospital room until John returned with his hairline sweaty and looking tired. John fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow and Sherlock watched John sleep, the television murmuring ignored in the background.
"All right," John said, and abruptly walked across the road, straight to the mandala, touched it and disappeared.
The car Mycroft sent to pick them up from the hospital deposited them on the curb directly outside 221B, mid-afternoon. Mrs Hudson was waiting on the doorstep with tears in her eyes and held her arms out to John, taking him in a gentle hug.
John stands awkwardly in the doorway for a few moments more, being ignored, before walking into the kitchen with the intention of making tea.
Despite himself, Sherlock grinned. "Yes!"
"Watching you..." murmurs John.
, over his,
John thrusts his hips experimentally, letting out a soft groan as his cock stutters and drags against Sherlock’s. It’s quite possibly the sexiest thing he’s ever seen, at the same time as being the most unexpected. John’s mouth waters at the sight of Sherlock’s thick, flushed cock head, pressed against his own.
Sherlock breathed out slowly.
Sherlock's gaze heated the skin under John's collar.
"Well, we wouldn't want that," he said, straight-faced but without a trace of sincerity.
"Neither do I," Sherlock said, "and I have to go, but before I do..."
on his face – the one which means he's just worked out a particularly tricky puzzle. The look he gets when he's been particularly clever.
"Still not an invalid," John muttered.
"Hello?" called John's voice.
"John, I need you," he murmurs, four simple words sending a little thrill through John's body.
"Oh John..."
"Just after you go to bed, and just before you go to sleep..." Sherlock continues, conversationally. "It's surprising how much one can hear through the walls, even in a building as old as this one..."
John doesn’t think his dick’s ever been this hard. It’s aching, pressed against the mattress as he slowly bobs his head, sucking Sherlock’s cock. If he’s not careful, he’ll come just from the friction he’s generating against his bottom sheet and the almost-overwhelming full-body sensation of having Sherlock in his mouth. He definitely didn’t expect to enjoy sucking cock as much as he does, but
"True," Sherlock says. "I've had no auditory... inspiration for what feels like an eternity. I liked coming every night, with your orgasm ringing in my ears..."
Two full years later, John Watson's best friend returned from the dead.
. John finds that violation of his personal property unaccountably sexy.
"Even with women?"
Sherlock stared for a long moment, unable to parse what he was seeing. John. In his bed. As Sherlock watched, John rolled over onto his side and looked up at him sleepily.
* * * * *
(See the end of the chapter for
"Anal sex. Have you had a cock in your arse?"
Two and a half years ago, John Watson watched as his best friend, Sherlock Holmes, threw himself from a building to his death.
John turns on Sherlock, narrowing his eyes. "You just didn't at the time?"
"We’re quite good at that."
"Why didn't you take me with you?"
true, and I’m
"It's so strange," John said.
John established a rhythm, pushing into Sherlock and pulling on his cock at the same time. All Sherlock could do was hold onto the bedhead with his head hanging as John fucked him and stroked him, harder and faster, breathing harshly against his back.
"Yes, oh," John said. "She wanted to be caught."
"It was like a dream come true. We fought. I forgave you. We resumed our friendship. That's when I started using Reverie a lot," John said. "Mary liked you. You, the other you, you actually liked her too."
Sherlock leans in closer, over the suddenly-too-narrow table and murmurs, "I know whose name you gasp when your orgasm takes you..."
"Lestrade hasn't heard from you."
you hadn't slept together yet."
"If you come before I'm inside you, John, I won't be best pleased," Sherlock rumbled, taking out a strip of condoms and dropping the box. He unbuttoned his suit trousers one-handed, letting them drop to the floor.
"For you," he said.
"I have no problem acknowledging it. What I don’t want is to agonise over it for hours and analyse it."
John frowns, his head cocking slightly. "You all right?"
"I don't think I..." Sherlock shook his head. "I would never have thought the real you would want that. I thought my own wants had corrupted it somehow."
"No idea. I can't think of anyone who'd do a better job than you," Paul said, with a small smile at Mara, which she returned.
Sherlock's hands were in his own hair, fists gripping and pulling as his body writhed. John looked up at Sherlock as he licked a long stripe up the underside of Sherlock's still-hard cock.
John pulled back, his lips making a lewd smacking noise as they released Sherlock's nipple.
John's eyes are locked on Sherlock's lips, stretched around the thick shaft of his cock. He has a look of vague disbelief on his face as he starts to thrust into that hot, wet mouth, cautiously, slowly. Sherlock's eyes are open, looking up at him with an expression of naked want. Sherlock lets out a quiet, frustrated grunt and reaches back to take hold of John's hand in his hair, gently prying his fingers away. His other hand moves to dislodge John's hand from his shoulder.
A cool, slick hand has taken hold of John’s cock again and is rubbing the head back and forth against the heated pucker of Sherlock’s entrance. John swallows convulsively, keeping his hips perfectly still, staring down at Sherlock’s cock and balls, then past to see his own shaft moving.
Sherlock lost a little of his impatience at that, forced out by a wave of heat that flushed through his body.
"I know what you need," Sherlock murmurs, "and that isn't it..."
Sherlock groaned, pushing his hips up. So this was the John Watson that his conquests saw. John "Three Continents" Watson, sex god apparently, in the flesh and in Sherlock's bed. John's prowess in the art of seduction came on like a stealth attack, mild-mannered doctor wearing old man cardigans and making tea one moment, tactical sex missile wholly annihilating his intended target using just his mouth the next. Sherlock was most of the way toward completely wrecked already.
Sherlock pauses, trying to get his cracking voice under control, scrubbing one hand through his hair. He finally looks at John.
John pulled back very slightly and murmured with a grin, "Be a dear and hand me the lube, would you?"
Sherlock stared, frowning at John's abrupt change of subject and attention.
"Sherlock."
John moved stiffly back to the bed, pausing on his way to move the visitor chair closer. He slowly got back into the bed without looking at Sherlock again.
"But you... you knew I was still here. Where you'd left me. You knew you could come back."
"...spreadeagled in the middle of your bed... thrusting my hips, fucking up into the fleshlight..."
He moves to the wall his bedroom shares with the bathroom and presses his ear against it, listening intently as he resumes stroking his cock, faster than before. All he can hear is laboured breathing and the occasional moan, echoing around the tiled walls and floor in the next room. Sherlock would have to know John could hear him from his bedroom. He’s probably done experiments with decibel meters and calculated the exact volume he’d need to achieve to be heard, or something equally ridiculous.
"Away... from me?"
Get me a jet.
A couple of hours later, John’s on his fourth pint and he’s made a new friend. His name’s Gabe and he’s from Spain. He has longish, black, wavy hair and the darkest brown eyes John has ever seen. He’s as gay as the day is long and has been furnishing John with beers in a so-far-quite-successful attempt at seduction.
"So close..."
"Come
"Do shut up, I'm trying to sleep," Sherlock murmured, a small smile belying his words.
"Sure, sure. Whatever. None of my business," John says, shaking his head and holding up his hands.
Sherlock peppers the sensitive skin of John’s throat with playful, biting kisses. John internally curses his military bed-making training, struggling against the cotton to free himself.
Sherlock put the roses in John's drinking water jug and smiled a little to himself as he heard John mutter, "Git."
Returning to Baker Street had been surreal after having been there so recently in a virtual world. John was still in hospital when Sherlock walked into the sitting room for the first time in eighteen months. Very little had changed in their flat—it was as though John had kept it as a shrine to their life together. The thought caused an uneasy, guilty feeling in his stomach.
you want it."
They both looked at the graffiti representation of a mandala spraypainted on the front door of the building directly across the road.
John frowns more deeply. "Right."
"Done, Charlie," Dylan said cheerfully.
"John," Mara said. "Please, we need to talk."
"Well..." Sherlock murmurs. "Sometimes even I need to have the obvious spelled out to me."
"Crime scene, miss, no press," he said, barring her passage.
Thanks for reading. :)
He pushed up out of the chair and walked into the kitchen, through the narrow hall and into Sherlock's bedroom without another word. Sherlock put his tea aside and his head in his hands.
"We're not having this discussion," John says without looking at Sherlock again. "'Night."
"It's what he does," John said quietly. "What he... did."
John’s only response to that is a choked gasp.
"More, Sherlock," John breathed, "I can take more, fuck, I
was what Sherlock imagined in his most personal moments, in moments of weakness, in moments of longing—having John,
"You're not jealous?" John said.
"One?" Sherlock asked, still breathless.
"All right?" Sherlock murmurs, almost cautiously, studying John’s face.
John waited until Sherlock arrived before using the lavatory the following morning.
"He's using the system to resurrect his dead friend. This could be even more challenging than we initially thought," Paul mused, rubbing a hand over his stubbled jaw.
"Stay," John murmured. "Talk to me."
Gabe’s hand has strayed down to John’s crotch, gently exploring the hard cock it’s encountered there. He pulls back slightly and takes John’s lips again, kissing him breathless until John pulls away with a quiet groan.
"Distractions would have been detrimental to my focus."
for anyone else."
"I didn't leave you. I was just... away. Busy."
John assumes Sherlock has decided that words are the problem. The next move comes the very next morning, in the form of Sherlock pinning him with an intense stare and backing him silently up against the fridge door. He feels like he's paralysed as Sherlock soundlessly sinks to his knees before him, his eyes still locked on John's.
Sherlock leaned heavily on the door frame, unable to make his legs carry him the five steps to the bedside.
"No point. He's not real, right?"
"Apertus."
"Quite so," Sherlock said.
Taking advantage of John’s distraction, Sherlock somehow manages to get both pairs of pyjama pants down around their thighs, then off entirely. John breaks off the kiss and stares into Sherlock’s eyes for a long moment before looking down to see his bare cock pressed against Sherlock’s.
"I do quite like the idea of beekeeping," Sherlock said with a small smile.
John smiles helplessly and breathes, "I'm liking it right now..."
"Ah. Yes, my phone," Sherlock said.
"Your body is shutting down, John. You need to leave."
"Nothing," Sherlock said, his eyes still closed, ashamed at wanting what was clearly a mistake to last just a little bit longer.
"Sorry," John mutters, and moves to examine the body.
"I bided my time, tailing him, unseen, undetected. I made my move when he visited a local brothel. Once he had... finished... and the professional of whose services he'd availed himself had left the room, I crept up behind and garotted him, almost severing his head."
Sherlock breathed out heavily.
Having seen this, experienced this, he wondered what perfect world John had created that would make him want to leave the real world behind—because this? This would be all it would take for Sherlock Holmes to give everything away.
"Well that's just... for god's sake," Sherlock said accusingly, looking at Mara. "The least you could do was make it
John breathes out very slowly into the phone.
"But not you. With you, I wanted to solve every tiny puzzle, dig out every single little detail. I wanted every part of you. I wanted to get inside you and solve you from the inside out. Shake you apart and put you back together again, to know how you work.
"I don’t know," John sighs softly, his eyes closed. "I don’t know."
"I need to change tactics," Mara said.
John only bobbed his head five times, sucking inexpertly, his lips sliding wetly over the silken head, before Sherlock cried out, "Oh
Sherlock paused where he was sat at the kitchen table with a case file, his eyes closed, listening to John moving behind him.
John's face is going bright pink, he can feel it, but if he stands up and leaves the table, Sherlock will see the effect his little display has had on his body. From the look on Sherlock's face, he knows exactly what he's doing. John feels like a puppet dancing helplessly for Sherlock's amusement: humiliated, played-with and
Mara ran down the street in hot pursuit of the two men, dodging a suddenly-reversing garbage truck and a pizza delivery scooter.
," John breathed, finally realising what Sherlock really wanted.
"You know this isn't real. How could any of this possibly be real?" Mara said, indicating with her handcuffed hands the swarming police officers, the fire engines, the massive blaze the explosion had started on the second floor.
"A joke?"
"Yes," he says carefully. "You're very bad."
"Well spotted," John breathed against Sherlock's frenulum, still rubbing and rubbing and driving Sherlock very quickly out of his mind.
"You're not afraid of needles are you?" the doctor said, brandishing the large gun-style syringe containing the implant.
God, John can almost see it as he stares at the bed. His cock is hard, despite or perhaps because of his anger. He strips quickly, efficiently, dropping his clothes on the floor, then crawls onto the bed. He lies down on his back in the spot Sherlock occupied nine hours earlier.
," Sherlock groaned out as his body clenched again, involuntarily.
Sherlock squinted at John.
"You don't think it will 'make things weird'?"
you, didn't he?"
The covers slipped off John's bare shoulders and Sherlock found himself quite unable to breathe. He numbly reached out for the phone and gasped quietly as John, instead of handing him the phone, took hold of his wrist and pulled him down onto the bed. He didn't know how to react as John wrapped his bare arms around him and snuggled in close.
"I’m not going to stop wanting this, John, so you’re going to need to get used to it," Sherlock continues. "Every time I look at you, I’ll be thinking about all the things I want to do
John looked at Sherlock, frowning. Sherlock looked at the fire and took a mouthful of whisky.
Sherlock looked at John, perplexity creasing his forehead.
"You want to analyse everything else – how is this any different? Am I less important somehow than the dead guy we just saw? Do I even rate a mention in the list of 'Things Sherlock Holmes Deems Important'?"
John has just started to take this as a very good sign when Sherlock shuffles down slightly, dips his head and starts kissing a chaotic, weaving trail up the exposed skin. John’s fingers thread gently into Sherlock’s dark hair, not pushing or pulling, just stroking his scalp. John is mesmerised, watching Sherlock’s pink lips moving over his slightly-tanned flesh. He shudders, thinking back to how they looked, stretched around his cock. His gaze moves to Sherlock’s eyes and he finds them looking steadily back at him.
Sherlock stood and held his hands out to John, helping him to his feet.
Before he’s really aware of what he’s doing, John is sliding down the bed, dragging his lips down Sherlock’s pale chest and abdomen. Sherlock gasps noisily and starts to protest, but that’s when John’s lips reach his dick. He presses a gentle, almost chaste kiss to the underside of the head and all objections die on Sherlock’s lips.
"I know we are," Reverie Sherlock said. "And we both love you
John steps forward quickly and pulls Sherlock into a rough hug. Sherlock struggles, trying to push him away, but it's half-hearted and John is all quiet strength. Sherlock buries his wet face against John's neck and surrenders to the fierce hold the shorter man has on him. He returns the embrace with a desperate sob.
"Please for the love of god don't ever admit that to him," Sherlock said. "I'll never hear the end of it."
John moved onto the bed, on his hands and knees, and lay down beside Sherlock, facing him. Sherlock's teeth chattered as another shudder went through his body, his eyes magnetically drawn to John's face. John's eyes met his.
"No, I -"
"John," Sherlock said, "why bother denying what we both know to be true? And If I've deduced it, as un-real as I am, I can say with absolute certainty that the real Sherlock knew."
John. Really
"Tell me about it," John mutters, a wry smile on his lips as he meets Gabe’s eyes again.
"Show me what I'm working with, Sherlock," John said, sudden heat in his eyes.
Sherlock breathes out in a rush, "God, I'm so sorry. I didn't-"
"I don't understand."
"You need to have some in order for me to do it."
"Maybe I want to hear you."
"Because I recognised myself in you."
"Hardly."
"C'mon," John murmured, slapping Sherlock's hip gently. "Sleeping on the floor will
"No. That's impossible."
"Oh, it's obvious," Sherlock said, waving his hand dismissively through the air. "Do better next time."
It’s not even like the half-admitted desire he’s occasionally felt for men. Semi-drunk notions of snogging the face off his high-school best friend Nathan when they were playing truant; a mostly-intellectual crush on his favourite (male) lecturer at university, which culminated in a couple of dates with hand-holding and gentle kisses but nothing more; the occasional leisurely barracks-downtime mutual handjob session with sweet young Private Parker in Afghanistan. Encounters he'd previously written off as curiosity, hero-worship and desperation, respectively, now shown to him in a different light: the light cast by Sherlock Holmes. All examples of his now-acknowledged experimentation with and desire for men, but still nothing compared to what he's feeling right now.
" John scoffs, hands on his hips, "Sherlock bloody Holmes, unique in all the world, superior to the rest of us mere mortals,
"Fuck..."
"Clearly. You'll have to show me how these 'relationship' things work, because I really haven't a clue, I'm afraid."
"Only everything," John said, smiling a little. "Sounds about right."
"Getting ahead of yourself, aren’t you?" Sherlock murmurs against John’s sternum, before licking a long slow line up to his collar bone.
"I want you bare," Sherlock whispered, his cheeks heating with the shamelessness of his demand.
"And then left?"
Sherlock smiles, a small, fond smile. "Modest, yes. Understated, certainly. A little sycophantic at times..."
John turns, his jaw clenched, his body held stiffly. The desolate look on Sherlock's face makes his heart feel tight, but he ignores it, because if he takes notice of that he'll crumble.
John immediately complies, looking up at Sherlock’s face.
"Some things must be, surely!"
John froze, looking up at Sherlock, a frown creasing his brow in a way Sherlock found endearing, despite his desperate frustration and need.
"Yes, again."
"Really quite... compatible."
"I'll be right back, are you okay here with her?" Lestrade asked, heading off to talk to a uniformed officer when John nodded.
"Sherlock, we need to talk."
His hand pauses on the way to turning on the kettle, seeing a post-it note stuck to the lid.
"All right," Sherlock said. "Just one?"
"When the user is in danger."
Sherlock smirked and slipped his hands into his pockets.
"Any time," Sherlock said, panicking a little, trying not to be too obvious in his desire.
, John..."
"Completely and utterly rubbish," Sherlock agrees.
John slipped his arm over Sherlock's shoulders and they made their way back to the room. John seemed to be walking fine but just not wanting to be in the position of stumbling again, and Sherlock was elated at being that close to him, and at John allowing him to help.
"You pestered me until I gave in and now what? Is this payback?"
John made a small angry, bitter noise and spoke without looking at Sherlock.
"You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen," Sherlock breathed, completely unguarded, looking back up into John's eyes.
Sherlock pulls back and smirks up at John briefly. One more sharp tug and his boxers and jeans are down around his thighs, his cock fully hard now in the cool kitchen air. Sherlock licks his lips slowly as he looks at it, then his eyes flick up to meet John's.
"Or not," John said, distracted, his hand automatically going to Sherlock's arse, fingers trailing over Sherlock's rounded, clenching cheeks before delving between to tease with his fingertips.
"I don’t know," John whispers, his heart pounding in his throat.
"Talk to me, John."
"I would burn my world to the ground to keep you safe," John said, his eyes locked on Sherlock's. "I would die for you. With you."
Sherlock shuffles up and reaches across to the bedside table to pick up a pump bottle of lube which wasn’t there when John went to bed. John is too distracted to notice this, however, because Sherlock’s cock is busy waving itself enticingly in his face as he straddles his tummy. He lifts his head, trying to lick it, but he can’t quite reach. Sherlock pumps lube into the palm of his hand, drops the lube carelessly off the side of the bed, then reaches behind himself and takes hold of John’s cock, stroking slickness onto his shaft.
"It’s a big deal to me."
Sherlock quickly got to his feet, going to his bedroom and dragging the dusty box from beneath his bed. He took out a bottle of lubricant and a box of condoms and walked back to John as fast as he could with an uncomfortably bouncing erection.
"Would you like to be tied up and fucked?"
Sherlock just stared, feeling his heartbeat speed up.
and I was
It was a betrayal Sherlock felt keenly. The delayed guilt gnawed at his insides, intermingling with other emotions he was accustomed to suppressing. But now, being here with John, and seeing what he had done to himself without Sherlock to give him purpose, caused Sherlock a pain unlike any he had ever felt.
"I can't, John."
Sherlock felt his foolish, love-stricken heart sink as he read John's message. He tried not to let his hurt show, but he'd been so flayed-open by their moment in the virtual version of his bedroom that he couldn't hide anything from John—possibly not ever again. John stared him down as he left and the pain in John's eyes struck him right to his core.
John stares at him, utterly infuriated, for a moment longer before turning on his heel and heading for the sitting room door.
anyone to go anywhere near that area of his body. The couple of girlfriends who had tried with tentatively probing fingers, he’d gently rebuffed.
"I did. It gave me an erection. You gave me an erection."
"I can't like both?" John says, his eyebrows raised.
"No, John, I'm afraid I can't do that," Sherlock whispers, his lips brushing against John's left ear.
"Mmm. I trained myself out of it. Comes in very handy for swallowing keys, lock picks and the like," Sherlock says, his expression all innocence. "And for other things too, of course..."
"I didn't doubt you."
, and I wasn't bored. I saw all that you were on that day, and yet I still wanted to know more. That never happens to me. I deduce people's motives, their desires, everything about them, and then I deem them tedious and move on to the next thing.
"Sitting room," John ordered, his tone of voice leaving no doubt as to whether going to the sitting room was optional. "We're going to talk about this."
no words for the feeling of being dead while being alive, moving through the world as a shadow, doing what needs to be done, and knowing that the one person who keeps you right would hate you if he knew."
Sherlock's sudden interest in John had been confusing, certainly, but at the same time it had been highly flattering; that he was seemingly special enough to hold the interest of
Quietly, John spoke, "I haven't done this before. But you know that."
"I—ye—n—
John swallows. "Are you wanking in my bed?"
"Just Sherlock is fine..."
Sherlock's eyes widen in surprise. "Already?"
"Stop
But not John Watson.
The phone goes dead and John sighs quietly, shaking his head, smiling a little more.
before," Sherlock says, his eyes still fixed on John's right shoulder. "I would have known."
"What is the issue, then? I don't see it."
John lets out a soft groan, his face flushing in the darkness as his hand slowly pushes under the covers, down his chest and stomach.
"More lube," John breathed. "Get me nice and wet..."
"How-"
* * * * *
"We are fine currently, yes, but I will
. The life we
Sherlock moved to flop on the bed, on his side. John massaged his thigh for a few moments, then moved to lie down. He pulled the rumpled top sheet up over their bodies and moved to lie close behind Sherlock, spooning him, their bodies pressed together, one arm curled around Sherlock's body, the other under his head on the pillow.
"Wanna make you come..."
Sherlock's eyes slip closed and his brow creases slightly as he takes John deeper still. John can hear him trying to suppress his gag reflex and the thrust of his hips is completely instinctive. Sherlock gags around his throat full of cock and John shudders violently in response, holding Sherlock's hands tighter, thrilled that he's defeated the smug bastard's much-boasted mastery over his gag reflex.
By the time John awoke, dressed and walked into the kitchen, it was nine in the evening. He passed the new mini-fridge under the kitchen window with a small frown and made his way to the kettle, switching it on with a yawn.
"I really have to go, I'm sorry," John murmurs.
to me. Cut it out."
Why does he feel like he’s closer to this mad, wild, alien creature, this extraordinary man, than he’s ever been, to anyone?
"That's
"It's out of our hands now, Mara," Paul said. "We're getting heat from all directions—our government, the board, the military—I don't know who this Mycroft Holmes man is, but it seems rather like, for all intents and purposes, he
Sherlock's forehead creases, pained. "John..."
"Apertus."
"Still... ahh... fucking the fleshlight... I've tightened the end, so there's more suction. It feels... like I'm going to pull my cock off..."
"Oh for god's sake," Sherlock muttered with an irritated eyeroll.
When John comes, he doesn't say Sherlock's name. He doesn't. He refuses to.
"Feel good?" John breathed, watching Sherlock writhe with thunderstorm-cloud-dark, hungry eyes.
His pyjama bottoms were tented obscenely and all Sherlock could do was stare. There was a large wet patch at the apex of the tent, the old, worn material going almost entirely see-through. Sherlock's mouth flooded with saliva as he looked.
"What? No! I mean... no," John stammers, completely caught off guard, Sherlock's breath making his neck break out in gooseflesh.
The next morning, the first thing he does upon waking is check his phone for texts. None have arrived overnight. He frowns at his phone as though blaming it for the lack of a response from his AWOL flatmate. He texts him again, a slightly less cool 'Where the hell are you?' He stares at his phone for a good ten minutes, a gnawing feeling growing in his gut with each passing one.
John can barely believe what’s happening. He can barely believe that Sherlock is letting him do this, that Sherlock even wants it. He can barely believe his luck. He breaks the kiss to stare up at Sherlock’s face, to reassure himself that this is real. Sherlock’s eyes flutter open and John feels the full force of the man’s focus again. His body gives an involuntary shudder as he looks helplessly into Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock reaches across the table, snatches John's marmalade-smeared butter knife with nimble fingers and demonstrates his point by tipping his head back and swallowing the knife like a sword. He pushes it deep, then pulls it out several times, showing off his talent provocatively. His lips drag against the blade and handle, puckered slightly in a way which makes John’s mouth go dry as he watches, his mouth gaping, forgetting to breathe. Sherlock slowly pulls the knife out of his mouth, sucking the marmalade from the blade before placing the knife on his own plate with a smug smile.
Apparently satisfied, Sherlock returns his attention to the laptop, his fingertips flying over the keys, quietly clacking.
John glances at his office door and rubs the heel of his free hand against the bulge in his trousers.
"Of course," Sherlock said. "I'll have Fatty send us a car."
"That's my line," John said softly.
He's already half-hard and he blushes scarlet as Sherlock's gaze moves to his crotch. He swallows around the lump in his throat, trying to get his voice to work, but before he can say a word, Sherlock has pushed his face into the gap in John's jeans, breathing in deeply. John bites back a moan and his hands clutch at Sherlock's shoulders, mostly because he doesn't know what else to do with them, but partly because he's so conflicted about what is obviously going to happen next. He doesn't know which he wants more: to push Sherlock away or to hold him close, close, closer.
"Been Googling, have you?"
"Seriously..." Sherlock murmurs, moving much closer to John than he'd like.
By the time he'd returned with a glass of water, John was fast asleep. He placed the glass on the bedside table and quietly left the room.
John doesn't have to answer; his shuddering groan is answer enough.
"Are we going to have the condom conversation again?" Sherlock asked, his tone of voice telling John exactly how that conversation would go.
You disappeared the morning after we... after we slept together. You didn't think about how that would look? You'll forgive me if I see a connection between the two things."
His medical mind is well aware of the mechanics of anal sex and prostate stimulation, but he never expected to
The other Sherlock took John's hand and pulled him to his feet. John turned and looked at Sherlock, his face flushed, his eyes bright with shed tears, his lips reddened from the recent kiss. Sherlock stared at John's mouth, want stabbing through him for a moment, before he caught himself and blanked his features.
"Well."
It's much later when the thought occurs to John that he neglected to mention Sarah as one of his reasons against he and Sherlock... well, you know. A perfectly serviceable girlfriend, and he didn't use her as an excu- a reason. That troubles him and he's not entirely sure why.
changed."
"I know just the place. The owner owes me a favour. It’s quite an interesting story, actually-"
"Naked please," Sherlock demanded imperiously.
"Yeah, I'm getting that," John murmurs, his forehead creasing into the worried frown Sherlock imagined, in the hospital rooms, continents away.
John shrugged nonchalantly as he took a sip of tea.
All coherent thought goes out the window when Sherlock’s face changes. One moment he’s completely focused on John, staring into his eyes, analysing his reactions, his pupil dilation, hell, probably his heart rate, and the next his eyes have slipped closed, his face going slack with bliss as John wraps his hand around Sherlock's rigid shaft.
Sherlock slipped into the bed beside John, their two bodies fitting together in an embrace like puzzle pieces slotting together.
He almost fell over his own feet when he neared John and found him shamelessly palming his erection, lying in the middle of the sitting room, groaning with abandon.
"His Reverie threw up an obstacle which allowed him to get away."
"Don’t start that again," John says, sitting back in his seat, his arms crossed over his chest.
The next pub turns out to be a warm, traditional little tavern. It’s quiet, he's one of only three people in the place. He orders a pint of bitter and goes to nurse it on a leather sofa in front of an anachronistic-looking plasma screen TV, which is showing the United v Tottenham match.
"It's not something I exactly go out of my way to advertise."
"Get him out."
"You can't just act like nothing happened. That's not how this works," John says, his hands on his hips.
Mycroft re-entered the room with a terrified-looking engineer who took the Reverie tablet from Sherlock and started tapping away at it.
asset is dying.
"God, yes..."
"Yeah... Yes, he did."
He turned his attention to Mara, lifting his chin haughtily as he continued.
"I know. I won't disappear again, I promise."
"Maybe," she said non-committally with a small smile.
"You're right, it
"No, I mean..."
, John thinks.
Yep. Straight as an arrow.
John is shaking as he berates Sherlock. Sherlock watches him with a confused look on his face, clearly not knowing how to react to the situation.
"I did things I'm not proud of, while I was away, terrible things that I can't even...” Sherlock lets out a ragged breath. “Things of which I'd never believed myself capable, deeds which I'd only
Sherlock shook his head, biting his bottom lip gently.
* * * * *
"What? I thought you didn't like talking on the phone," John says by way of greeting when Sherlock answers.
Sherlock suppressed a smile.
"God, no," John groaned as Sherlock dipped his head to lick at the skin exposed by his hand dragging John's zip slowly down.
"You're still ready to go, aren't you?"
The first thing he noticed was that there was a playpen in the corner. Children's toys were scattered around the sitting room. He frowned slightly, not understanding. No child was present.
Sherlock is stunned. This contingency clearly hadn't occurred to him. It shows on his face and John shakes his head, almost sadly.
"I... I don’t..." John stammers. "I don’t... know."
Sherlock’s voice is low and rough as he murmurs, "Tell me you don’t feel it, John. Tell me you don't want it."
. I sat at your grave and talked to you. I prayed to a god I don't believe in for a miracle. I wasted my time in useless therapy sessions. I told myself the pain would fade, but it didn't; it didn't even start to. I saw you on the street, ran up to you and scared the
"I'm here."

"The crime scene?" Sherlock murmurs, frowning slightly. "Average."
Sherlock shakes his head faintly, unable to come up with an answer. John shakes his head, bemused.
"Impeccable timing."
"Hey, that's my subconscious mind you're criticising there!" John said, not looking particularly upset about it.
minor concern in the grand scheme of sensations his body is experiencing.
"Again, this isn't something we're getting a choice about," Charlie said. "Our London office have requested the source code and are preparing a tablet as we speak."
John grabs the front of Sherlock's shirt and reels him in, pulling him down into a desperate, rough kiss. Sherlock lets out a surprised groan and wraps his arms around John, bunching his hands in the back of his jacket, pulling him close.
"Much more than that," Sherlock murmurs. "You’re my partner. In every possible sense."
"You're not curious?"
Sherlock bit the inside of his lip hard and held his breath as John started to kiss a slow trail down his neck, over his chest, stroking him all the while, his hand still inside Sherlock's shorts. He looked down at John and thrust up hard into his hand as their eyes met, his body trembling uncontrollably. John licked slowly down over Sherlock's tummy, tonguing a slow circle around his belly button, before moving to kneel between his parted knees. He dipped his head and rubbed his cheek slowly up the length of Sherlock's cock, his slightly-stubbled skin creating friction against the fine silk of Sherlock's underwear.
"You're not the first person to tell me that."
John stared down at the point where his body intersected with Sherlock's. "God, that's-"
John pulled back and stroked Sherlock through a loud, shuddering orgasm, groaning in sympathy as Sherlock shot rope after rope of semen over his own body; his hips bucking wildly, John holding on to Sherlock's thigh with his free arm. He slowed his strokes as Sherlock's trembling subsided, his own heart pounding, his cock throbbing and hard in his pyjama trousers, trapped against the mattress.
"Truly exceptional..." John breathed, looking slowly along the length of Sherlock's body once more.
"I can burn this world you've created to the ground, John," Mara said, her hands shaking with adrenaline. "You know I can do that."
Sherlock brushes his mouth against John’s frown, is completely unable to resist the urge to smooth it away with his lips.
"You can't talk to me?"
"It's fine," Sherlock said, watching as John pulled away to move to his armchair, sitting down stiffly. "Tea?"
"I know that."
Sherlock doesn't mention it again for a few days. Things have mercifully gone back to the way they were, with Sherlock silently observing John a lot of the time, but making no sexual overtures whatsoever.
John shrugs one shoulder and murmurs, "He's nice. I like him."
"I suppose the facsimile was based on me as I appear to the outside world to an extent. The Reverie system takes data from social media, from blogs, from news, from websites, and... the person I am online is different to the person I am with you," Sherlock said. "Or the person I
"Nope, Reverie 2146586-A-Watson. Definitely the right Reverie."
"Other than the stethoscope?"
," John groans as his cock erupts over his hand, his body shuddering violently, hips thrusting out of his control. He hasn’t had a solo orgasm this intense in as long as he can remember and he strokes himself for much longer than he usually would, because it’s just too good to stop; the aftershocks wracking his body, the images in his mind...
, you bring to my life. I carried you like a phantom limb, like a scar on my... on my heart," Sherlock says, looking away again, obviously uncomfortable with the metaphor but unable to express himself in any other way. "I walked through the world as half a man, haunted by the ghost of the man you made me. Mourning my best friend, my
Sherlock's reply is a breathy, "Not technically..."
"Good day, Doctor Watson," Mycroft says, a patently false smile on his face. "I'll see myself out."
"All right, all right," John said, and crawled back onto the bed, up over Sherlock's body. Sherlock's hands moved to the pillow as John straddled one of his thighs, bringing their faces close. He could feel John's cock pressing against his femoral artery. So close.
"It's why god invented waivers."
the British Government. And possibly a few others besides. He's frankly a little terrifying."
"But my meaning is clear, yes?"
"I watched you—you fell. I saw it. Please stop this."
"We're still
The next few minutes passed for Sherlock in a whirlwind of sensation—two unrelenting fingers plunging deep into him, slippery-wet, what should feel like an intrusion feeling like a revelation with each knuckle-deep push. His eyes were squeezed shut and his body was moving with each of John's thrusts, trying to take his fingers deeper, get more of John inside him.
As quick as a flash, Sherlock has moved away, striding purposefully into the sitting room while John just watches, his knees still shaking.
"What kind of obstacle?" Alexis asked.
"You like being dominated, don't you?"
John came out of the bathroom and looked at Sherlock, a slight frown on his face. Sherlock leaned against the door frame, blinking slowly as his panic receded. John moved over to him,  placing a firm hand on his arm.
"I don't see why," Sherlock states, and as John looks at him, he can see that it's the truth.
Sherlock took a deep breath.
"Not with our trousers on, it isn't," Sherlock breathed, then nipped a line of small, gentle bites down the side of John's neck.
, filled his nostrils. He breathed in deeply, his eyes falling involuntarily closed.
"John—"
John straddles him and lets out a loud groan into Sherlock's mouth as he feels the detective's hands slide down his back to his arse, pulling their hips together. He breaks off the kiss for a moment, just looking down into his pale blue-grey-green eyes.

Mara shivered, finding herself on a cold, darkened London street. She took a moment to get her bearings, the misty rain starting to soak her light jacket. She scurried into a doorway to take shelter and saw two figures run past, one tall and in a long coat, one shorter and carrying a gun.

get turned, though," John admits. He smiles a little, a teasing tone to his voice as he continues, "I'm surprised you hadn't noticed, brilliant detective like you."
"Well, at least I know you weren't doing anything stupid while you were gone," John huffs, disgusted.
"I want to hold you down and fuck you hard... Fuck that hot arse of yours..."
"You just need to get him to the mandala," Alexis said, referring to a type of exit portal that existed in the virtual world. "The
"Maybe another time," John said, a smile evident in his voice. "Right now I want to get you nice and wet and slippery, and give you a good, deep fingering."
"You like that, Sherlock?" John murmured against his mouth, twisting his grasp on Sherlock's sensitive skin.
". Lestrade replies immediately, with "
"Gabe. I’m sorry, but I can’t," John says, his lips still temptingly close to Gabe’s. He takes hold of Gabe’s wrist and pulls his hand away from his cock. "I have to get home."
"I had to do some... not-good things," Sherlock said softly. "You... wouldn't have liked it."
, Sherlock. I had sex with my
Sherlock bows his head, resting his forehead against the front of John's left thigh. John doesn't know exactly why, but it feels like an apology. John threads his fingers into the back of Sherlock's hair, rubbing his scalp gently with his fingertips, hoping to convey some sort of acceptance. They stay like that for a while before they're jolted by the front door's slam and Lestrade's pounding steps on the stairs.
"That's evidence. It's not mine," Sherlock says, taking a step toward him.
"You what?"
Sherlock keeps hold of both John's hands, pressing them against the fridge door at his sides as he slowly bobs his head, taking John's cock as deep as he can, then pulling back, sucking hard. The rhythm isn't as punishing as it started out, but it's quickly driving John out of his mind.
"John Watson!" she shouted breathlessly, and saw the man stop and turn back, a furious smile on his face.
"It's me, John. I promise you."
"I can only imagine how responsive you'll be when I'm inside you..."
"A John Watson specialist."
"You mean..."
Abruptly his mental image changes, from Sherlock alone on the bed to the two of them on the bed together. John's teeth are scraping against Sherlock's pale shoulder from behind as they kneel on the bed, Sherlock reaching behind himself to take John's cock in hand. John lets out a quiet growl as he pictures himself pushing Sherlock roughly onto his hands and knees, running one hand over Sherlock's peachy arse cheek and lining up his cock with the other. Pushing... slowly... inside...
Sherlock looked up at John as he dragged down his jeans and pants, freeing a cock so hard Sherlock was surprised John hadn't come already.
"I'm all right," John breathed. "Just a bit overwhelmed."
"All right then—prove it," John said.
"-you didn't know to look for me. It was all I wanted, to be found. How could you let me down like that? The most surprisingly intuitive and resourceful man I've ever known, and even you couldn't find me. I was so lost without you. So
