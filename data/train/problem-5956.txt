"If it's so disturbing, maybe you shouldn't look at it, then!", he returned, a dangerous edge to his voice, like a threat or a warning. He crossed his arms behind his back, away from Wade's sight.
. And then there was Tony. Calm, still, just looking at him. "Then you don't have to. You don't need to rush this, you don't have to force yourself. We have all the time in the world."
He wasn't sure how long his brain checked out but next time he was fully conscious it was silent. No fighting, no screams or gunfire. Somehow he felt worse.
Peter leaned back against the wall, still holding on to his bleeding wounds. There was nothing left to do now but wait.
"I'll try to not take that to heart.",Bucky returned, faking offence. But he didn't really seem bothered by it so Peter tried not to worry too much about it. Bucky wasn't mad at him, Peter wasn't being bad, at least he didn't think that he was. But he could probably do better. He put the phone away again and his eyes fell onto Bucky's phone that was still in the other man's metal hand.
I also wanted to use this opportunity to thank all of you. I've never written anything that has been read by so many people. This story has been a part of my life for over a year now and every time I thought I couldn't finish it your comments picked me up again.  So thank you, from the button of my heart, it has been an honour.
"Thanks for that. ",Peter said, real gratitude in his eyes and it twisted Wade's heart. Apparently it hadn't died with Vanessa after all.
Natasha went over to a controlpanell next to the window. "I'll be closing the door behind you but we'll watch and listen.", she warned.
Once Peter woke up again it took him a minute to remember where he was and what was happening. His headache really wasn't helping either. He might've been concussed, judging by the dizziness and nausea. Peter was slumped on a seat in the quinjet, Gwen beside him, piloting the jet as they flew through the sky.
"Hey, Petey-pie! You requested me?", Wade asked cheerfully. Seeing Peter alive and well still set his heart ablaze.
"Back at the forest, when you took off you were swinging through the air on white strings, where did they come from.", Wade then asked and Peter relaxed even more. His powers were the least of his concerns.
The memory was crystal clear in his mind. Back then he didn't know what was to come. He didn't even know if he'd survive the night but he'd been okay, less afraid. Peter wished that he could go back to being that way. At least he still had the memory. Something SHIELD hadn't taken from him. Something to hold on to.
"If the crackhead does talk and the wrong people get wind of a weird Spider-human who travels around with the Winter Soldier, I'm in trouble.", Peter explained and MJ let out a heavy sigh.
The smaller man pushed down Steve’s underwear freeing his cock which sprang up proudly. Tony hummed appreciatively, trying to hide his apprehension at the size, before taking it into his mouth and sucking.
Steve Rogers, gang leader and object of his stake out, was standing in front of him looking completely unphased. His blond hair was ruffled from the wind outside and flopped over his forehead as though it was a curtain for his striking blue eyes. The lighting of the coffee was several times more flattering than the ones found in the interrogation room. Tony tried to snap himself out of it as the man had begun to speak.
Steve scoffed and dropped down on the couch between Tony’s legs so he could treat the other man’s thighs as an armchair. He rested back against his husband’s chest with a sigh. Rolling his eyes, Tony wrapped his arms around his partner’s torso and dropped his head down so his chin could rest against Steve’s fluffy blond hair.
Tony licked his lips before saying, with his characteristic lack of eloquence, “I’ve seen your ass.”
“It’s you.” He rolled his eyes at Tony’s obtuseness, “I heard through the grapevine, a.k.a Natasha’s snooping skills, that you and Steve are a thing now? Bet you had to beg to get that ass.”
All eyes were on Clint and he started with a breath steadying sigh, “Alright everyone, I have to start with a confession... When I first heard about Steve and Tony’s relationship I didn’t believe they would make it a week, let alone 5 years.” Some of the crowd chuckled, “I still partly think they’re not really together and this is all one large prank on me.” The laughter scattered from table to table, “This is despite almost everyone I spoke to telling me that there was something about them that just made them perfect for each other. It took me nearly 5 years but slowly they began to show me what made them so undeniably perfect for each other. Mostly their balance,” An image popped up on the screen of Steve holding Tony above his head, it had been done as a bet where Tony bet Steve he couldn’t hold up above his head. Both of them had known he could but he wanted the experience,
The second the moment had passed Steve felt like a fool. They were kneeling on the floor of the files room together, sweaty and out of breath. It suddenly dawned on him that anyone could enter the room at any moment as the precinct is a rather public place. He could feel the red flushing up his neck but Tony’s hand smoothed over the heating area comfortingly. Steve’s brain wasn’t working fast enough to allow him to figure out why it soothed him so much.
Tony felt the bed behind him shift as Steve slowly lifted his head to peer back at his colleague to determine whether Tony had fallen asleep or lying awkwardly just like himself.  Steve’s sigh echoed around the room, accidently amplifying the weary sound.
They peered out, pressed together until Tony noticed that the downpour had had the wonderful effect of making Steve's shirt close to see through but glancing down he realised that his was similarly translucent.
2 hours later, the two detectives hugged the very boundaries of the mattress in a desperate attempt at preventing their butts from touching. They lay facing away from each other in silence despite both being completely aware that the other was fully conscious. Neither wanted to be the first to break the silence but the tension was thick around them.
"Sure, let me try again. You're useless to me so get out. Oh and if you actually want my advice drop out now." His tone was harsh but his expression was concerned.
After a few hours, Tony marched over with an unfamiliar case and slapped it down on Steve’s desk. Before Steve could claim that they weren’t partnered on this case Stark was saying, “I need you to sign off on this.” He was gone before he had even finished the sentence, having instead to call over his shoulder as he marched away.
“Before we start with questions, Steve would like to make a statement regarding his injury and recovery.” After finishing the sentence, he turned to Steve to indicate that he was ready to interpret.
He could hear the squad squawking around like headless chickens and, while for many of them it was only their first time out, he wanted to believe he’d taught them better. He was about to think it through more when one of the men carrying the stretcher stumbled, despite Steve being light, and a jolt ripped through Steve’s leg. That gave him the first opportunity to identify the area with the most pain even though every single part of his body was on fire. Something had happened to his leg.
“I think I need to apologise too.” Steve muttered, looking down at the floor.  Needless to say, Tony was hugely surprised by this sudden turn of events. He was still working through his own guilt and hadn’t yet started to think about what Steve might to be to blame for. The taller man continued, “I over reacted. We are both just as unfamiliar with the whole relationship etiquette thing and you didn’t know how much what you did would embarrass me.”
“Usual case of just intel gathering, detectives.” Deputy Coulson informed them, “We need to keep an eye on a building in Brooklyn for possible large scale illegal arms dealing.”
The sobbing prevented Steve from hearing when the lift stopped at their floor. It stopped him hearing his lover calling out tentatively. It wasn’t hard for Tony to find him though as he just followed through to the bedroom where a lump of blankets were curled up. He frowned down at the moving sheets.
“Good morning,” Her voice was bright and friendly. She checked her watch to tease him, “Or should I say, afternoon?”
A sensation of dread washed over the shorter detective as he watched the blood soak right through the bandage under the white shirt.
The credits were rolling on their film but Steve hadn’t paid attention to the last half as he’d gotten slightly distracted watching Tony’s face while butterflies assaulted his stomach. The end music finished and the room was plunged into darkness but neither man dared to move. Steve would know when the other moved as it would rustle the blanket that they currently shared. All he could hear was his steady breath.
“Don’t be ridiculous. I think I’ve wanted to kiss you since that first time I woke up with you in my bed.” Steve smiled, they were still so close together.
The loud crash shook through him and confirmed that he was too late. From beneath the panel he could see the mangled body of his partner tinted in dirt and blood.
Carefully, with his attention completely captivated by his work, Tony began to attach the prosthetic to Steve. He took his time and ensured everything was properly in place and that any material that would cause Steve discomfort was hidden behind the gentle silicone. His large fingers softly touched the skin of Steve’s thigh, moving in massaging circles.
"Lie back down. I'll go and get your pain meds." Tony watched Cap yawn which caused a smile, "Besides, they said you'd be tired when you eventually woke up with your body trying to cope and all."
“Yes, but his affiliates haven’t and what is the likelihood of a mob boss collecting his own drinks?” Fury challenged and Tony had to admit that it was a logical argument, “Besides, nobody in the precinct knows Rogers and his operation like you.”
Steve smiled gratefully. He must have done something really good in a past life to be rewarded with a man like Tony Stark. Little did he know that Tony felt the same about him.
His assailant was running as fast as his legs could carry him but had significantly underestimated how well Steve could deal with a simple bullet to the shoulder and blood loss. He didn't realise Steve would be instantly burning for revenge.
A sudden shot rang out followed by a gasp of pain that Tony’s brain immediately recognized. Another shot was fired.  Stark’s instincts wanted him to stop and check who was injured but knowing that someone willing to shoot was in the same room as them prevented him. Instead he barged forward, knocking the weapon from the shooter’s hands and began forcing the criminals to lie on the floor with their hands over their head.  The team helped him detain them efficiently.
Aside from a slight make-out session that night, he and Tony hadn’t exactly confronted what had happened and now they were back to regular life it almost felt like a blurry dream that definitely didn’t happen. He didn’t have the guts to ask the other man about it in case he got shot down which would break his heart after he worked up all of his bravery to make the first move.
Steve was nervous; his palms were sweaty and he was glad he didn’t have to speak as he could feel dryness in his mouth so could only imagine the difficulty in speech. The soldier didn’t mind talking to large groups but his deafness wasn’t something commonly known yet which, he was certain, might make for an awkward interview. SHIELD had offered to release a statement when he first joined the team but Steve didn’t want to make a big song and dance over something he considered so everyday. Why should they have to announce his deafness when they’ll find out naturally anyways; he was tired of always been a spectacle.
It took Steve's mind a second to click who's it was before he released his statement, "And yet you're still here." It wasn't delivered as fiery as he'd wanted as his throat was dry and sore. The other person huffed a laugh despite it.
Natasha was the first to recognize the man but didn't recoil at the idea. She stepped closer and gently touched his shoulder which caused his graying head to flop forward. Bruce made a sound of confusion and disgust in the back of his throat.
"Look, I know it's great to sleep in but now you're pushing it. The sympathy card has quite literally been used up. Nobody cares anymore. They're gone." A familiar voice mocked good humorly.
It was when the meeting had been dismissed and the team disbanded that both Stark and Rogers, acting independently, approached Captain Fury. They glared at each other as though they had claimed the time after the meeting to talk with Fury for themselves.
"Wait," Stark was smirking, "These two both tried to kill you and neither succeeded? Woah, you guys were bigging yourself up way too much."
Minutes later he was out on the street heading to the subway under a flimsy umbrella Natasha had lent him.
“You... you didn’t have to do that because of the leg...” Tony went cold at the idea of Steve somehow using Tony’s developing infatuation with the hero as payment for the prosthetic.
“Let me know if anything needs to be changed or whatever. I know that sexuality can be fluid so if something starts making you uncomfortable just let me know and I’ll change it up.” The smile he got was one of the most open and accepting Steve had ever received.
He heard Fury enter but didn’t look up at the man. He hadn’t yet decided if he liked him or if he was hiding something.
Stark had been trying very hard to not think of Steve’s ass, especially when the man was anywhere near him. It had been years since he’d been in any sort of established relationship so he was fearful of fucking it up with Steve. Would Steve be uncomfortable if Tony thought about his ass? Would that be crossing one of his boundaries? He’d have to check.
Suddenly, mustering all of his energy Steve hauled himself up and pulled up his pant leg and ripped off his prosthetic. He threw it as hard as he could against the wall as a cry of pain ripped from his chest. The leg damaged the wall but neither man was in a position to pay attention to it.
The precinct was calling so he pretty much had no choice but to respond. He ascertained the details quickly before hanging up and standing to leave but Steve caught his arm and used his famous puppy-dog eyes against him.
He was alone in his room every night which was sparsely furnished and cold. It was a stark difference from the camaraderie and community you felt when living amongst hundreds of other soldiers. He wasn’t ashamed to say that he cried most nights at the loss of his leg, the loss of companionship or just the overwhelming experience he was going through.
Tony was heading out from their latest, seemingly never ending, briefing when Clint caught up with him. Not caring if Clint got offended, Tony frowned and peered across at him. If Clint was around him he was usually up to something.
Steve knew he was about to embarrass himself but sucked it up and spoke anyway. Natasha was his closest friend in their department so if he couldn’t share with her then he would have to just let it boil inside, “We may have shared a bed…” Her eyebrows rose further as she could tell there would be more, “And there may have been-“
Tony spoke up cautiously, unsure whether the man was dead or unconscious, "Is that Professor Wright?"
“Hi, just the usual. Black Americano. Thanks.” The man has placed his order and handed the cash (who still used cash?) across without even looking up at the barista, clearly absorbed in some other thoughts.
Both men scrambled to pull themselves off the floor and justify their actions but the captain wasn’t having any of their nonsense today. He raised his hands to silence them and with his mouth in a scowl pronounced,
He left the body there, hidden behind a box of test tubes, to slip into his next costume and inhabit his next persona. In the boiler room he slipped on a blue overall bodysuit, which he knew would be there from previous tour of the building, and high-visibility jacket. He stole a large trolley for transporting large boxes and a huge box with ‘Champagne glasses’ etched on the side. He changed and pushed the trolley back to the body where he loaded it in the box and used the disguise to slip out the trade entrance which was pinned open for party staff to come and go to collect food or champagne.
Steve didn’t remember falling asleep but he did remember the pain starting to ebb around the time that the sky was transforming itself into a faint orange. He blinked awake but his eyes felt heavy and he fought to keep them open. His clock beside his bed read 7:34 and he cursed his internal body clock for being so consistent. He could do with a couple more hours of sleep after the trauma of the night before.
Tony flopped down at his desk, the chair wheeling back slightly under the force of his weight, just in time for the start of his shift. As his first day back he wanted to start off on a good footing going forward which he nearly blew by being so close to being late.
Steve had almost forgotten his fake name until she cried it out, "Jon Paulson! I was wondering when you were going to show up!" She grinned at him, "You dirty stop-out." Her smile grew and mischief sparkled in her eye.
Those words were all Tony needed to send him wild with desire for this man. He pushed Steve back until he was lying completely flat on the bed and Tony lowered himself on his knees in front of the soldier. He peeled off the pants so Steve’s dick was standing erect only centimetres from his mouth. Tony knew Steve would be large but the man was currently surpassing all of his expectations.
Steve hurried back towards the run down apartment he'd once again hidden in before the attempted assassination but stumbled on the step up so nearly fell down. There was blood everywhere, thanks to whoever had put a price on his head again. Why were people so obsessed with murdering him? More blood. It was dripping down onto the tarmac in heavy splats Iike a child had flicked around a paintbrush.
One of Steve’s greatest fears since releasing he was asexual was that he’d never be able to keep a partner. He always envisioned his partner’s leaving due to their lack of sexual intimacy and it wasn’t completely unfounded as it had happened to him before. Tony was special to him and he’d do anything to keep him happy. Even if that meant breaking his own heart in the process.
“Did you not hear what I just said?” Steve ran his fingers through his hair and flopped back against the couch wearily.
With Natasha’s threat ringing in his ears, he gulped and turned to face the car to see Steve pulling himself out of the door slowly. Tony winced, knowing that this couldn’t be a good sign. As the taller man turned to face him, the flower of red was starting to bloom across his side as though the crimson floodgates had been opened. Steve followed the dark haired man’s eyes and let out the mildest, softest curse.
“Less talk of the newlyweds and more about this week’s cases!” Captain Fury snapped over the chatter of the room before moving on with the set tasks and started dishing them out.
He stumbled upon the room almost by accident as the detective had been more than convinced he’d taken the wrong left somewhere along the line in this maze of a building. He had mentally prepared himself for half a day lost in just trying to navigate before he finally lost his wits and surrendered to the knowledge of the medical staff bustling by. He wanted to wait until the last moment though as he wasn’t a quitter and wasn’t about to become one.
Despite his best hopes, the recording had yielded almost nothing since the criminals were so well versed in their deception. Tony knew that eventually one of them would trip up or something would fall lose and he’d be there to discover it. Finally then, he would be able to arrest Rogers and his affiliates.
Smiling at the note and unbelievably curious to what was inside the box, Steve opened it quickly. The box was full of wires which caused him to frown but upon closer inspection he could see tiny lightbulbs were hanging from the wires. After a moment, he recognised them as a string of fairy lights with a large battery box at the end.
It took him to the ground and the genius shot out, his eyes scanning the surrounding area and people. He checked face after face around the tower convinced the man couldn't have travelled very far while injured. Eventually he had to give up and admit defeat. It was almost as though the tall man could just vanish into thin air.
The genius touched Steve through the blankets and the man jumped and shot up into a sitting position.
He hadn't speed walked so furiously in years but the panic was sending him into overdrive. Dr Yepsem was here somewhere and he knew that because the doctor always cut through the park on his way to his regular lunchtime sandwich place. He’d learnt that from 3 weeks of monitoring the man’s every moment. However, Steve had been sat on the bench by the store since 11am so either the doctor was running late or some giant disaster had prevented the man from making his daily pilgrimage. It better be the first option, Steve thought bitterly.
The car was silent as even the wind had died down as though mocking their inability to hold conversation. Only the rise and fall of their breathing even proved that they were still alive. Shadows shrouded the car making it harder for their suspect to spot them in their stakeout spot. Steve fiddled with a case file on his lap as a way to dispel nervous energy. Every few minutes Tony glanced across at the other detective’s moving fingers and would open his mouth to make a snide comment before having to begrudgingly stop himself.  Fury’s lecture was still spinning around his head reminding him that they’d be working together for the next few weeks until they close up this file so at least some civility would have to suffice.
Clint answered, "He is good. He's the best there is." Slight defensiveness filled his tone, "He's alive but taking time to recover, we think. We know he's definitely alive as we were taking care of him for the first few days but Cap can be elusive when he wants to be. And we didn't tell you because you would have insisted we bring him here and he would have rather died."
Stark nodded at this sudden revelation. He often forgot that the other man had lived a whole different life before he’d been brought to the Avengers that impacted him on a daily basis.
The engineer sighed, knowing that Steve would be horrified and never speak to him again made it hard to admit, “I came in to check on you last night after the mission because I saw you getting beat up pretty bad and I knew you’d just try to ignore your injuries. When I walked in you were naked on your bed, bare ass up.”
They both laughed and within the hour they were snuggled under the blankets watching a film that neither particularly cared about but it didn’t matter since they were together. Besides, Steve had claimed the last Chocolate Fudge Ben and Jerry’s so he was feeling pretty smug about that.
Tony kissed him in the way his subconscious had been urging him to do for weeks. His passion rushed forward as the floodgates of his rational brain burst allowing his purposely repressed feelings toward his colleague came pouring out. He had been trying to dissuade himself from liking someone so inaccessible but now everything he had played down came rushing forth and fit like a puzzle.
"The Genetic Mutations conference? 2 - no, 3 years ago?" He suggested with a smile. His brain was doing that thing which Steve was relying on: filling in details or creating false facts to fit the evidence, "Of course, I remember you!"
Once the smaller detective returned from where ever he was hiding, Steve purposefully kept his eyes solely on his own computer screen despite being able to sense Tony’s gaze frequently drifting across the precinct. Steve was going to teach the man a lesson in humility if it kills him.
“Firstly, don’t sleep with the man. We know you, Tony. You sometimes struggle to keep it in your pants. And secondly, don’t allow him to manipulate you. Don’t go tomorrow as he’ll have staged the whole thing. Don’t go anywhere he invites you.” The man advised. This was all information Tony knew but simply often acted against his own advice.
Steve spoke as he dropped in bag onto the damp, wooden floor, “I guess you'd better take the bed since you'd have to chase the perp if they make a dash.” He had been okayed for basic detective work but the doctors had advised him at least a few more weeks until he could return to peak physical exertion, “You'll need to be on peak form.” He began to push his bag across the room to where he'd use it as a pillow.
Rogers blinked and slowly rose from his seat with his arms placed defiantly on the desk in front of him; the pose made the muscles in his shoulders and upper arms stand out. His chair squealed along the tiled floor as he moved it back with his legs. The detective peered into the other’s eyes.
He shook himself out of his pity party and tried to regain control over his emotions. They were only colleagues after all and what did their opinion of him matter anyway?
The security guard’s desk was empty as the watchman must have been out on patrol. However, Steve had been in agonising pain for nearly 30 minutes and nobody had returned so the man doubted he’d be saved.
Steve slunk through to his lounge and dumped himself down on the couch. Wilson perched nearby to continue prying like a good friend should. The detective rubbed his hands over his face wearily.
“What the...” he muttered under his breath as he peered down at the green pants, he could barely see the angles and straps of the prosthetic under the fabric.
Steves smile caused creases around his eyes and he couldn’t stop smiling all the way to bed. Sometimes being deaf was incredibly isolating but every now and again someone will reach out and make a difference.
Steve sighed and rested his head against the back of the couch before rolling it to the side so he could look his friend in the eye, “Genuinely, I don’t know. I’ve been ignoring my feelings for this guy for so long that I don’t really want to ask him what this is in case I scare him off. It feels too good to be true.”
He hurried away, slightly embarrassed that he’d seen Captain America in such a vulnerable position but knowing that the man’s butt would haunt him whenever he laid eyes on him again.
The assassin rolled his eyes and hauled himself out of bed. He'd might as well make a move on it while the morphine was still kicking around his body. Sure, this wasn't exactly the best state for performing hired killings but while he'd been waiting for Clint to give the go ahead he'd planned it through enough times for it to be a walk in the park. Literally as his plan started in Central Park.
Stark watched the assassin carefully. He didn't doubt that the man had lived through worse but now he'd met him, he didn't want Cap to go through anything ever again. At least, not if he could stop it. He had the ability to protect this man and he definitely would, even if the other man did his best to shake his efforts.
Tony spun around and a sudden flood of guilt washed over him. Maybe he should have listened when the old man on floor four called out the window saying that Steve clearly wasn’t in. Tony brushed off the emotion and instead focused on the man.
The smaller man couldn’t help but be surprise that his colleague addressed him by his first name.  Their relationship had always been formal and stiff no matter how much Tony teased his fellow detective.
She peered at him over the rim of her ‘world’s best detective’ mug, “You know where he lives. Why don’t you go and ask him yourself.” It was a question but was posed as a definite statement.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think-“ Tony started but as soon as the phrase ‘didn’t think’ slipped out Steve was furious.
“Hey, look here, Mr high and mighty. I’m talkin’ to you.” The words were more growled than said, “You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.” Silence reigned and after a moment that felt like an hour, Tony began to pick up on the grimaces on the other’s faces, “Why do I suddenly feel so out of the loop?”
"I'm sorry," Stark blushed slightly, "You've woken up a few times now but this is the first time you've actually spoken. Last time you just opened your eyes and made a weird groaning noise like Frankenstein's Monster."
"Mr Stark, come and hold pressure on his wound." She commanded, pushing the assassin's limp hand off his shoulder.
Steve’s eyebrows rose as Tony placed his hands under the leg with the gentlest touch Steve had ever witnessed from the man. With only a guiding force, Tony turned Steve’s leg slightly to the side so he could take a look at the mechanics which allowed the joint to bend when the man walked. He bent the leg and easily saw that it was overly stiff so the function that sprang the leg back was broken or hadn’t been adequately repaired.
“Just Steve.” The man answered and moved again to join the queue of people waiting for their drinks.
So, out of frustration and a sheer lack of willpower to continue fighting with the device, he had ripped it off and climbed into bed despite the early hour. He was just considering how nice it felt to be free of the prosthetic for a while so he could move his body freely under the sheets when the door suddenly opened and Tony marched in.
“We didn’t do ‘it’.” He argued back weakly but by this point Sam had already deduced the sequence of events that had occurred at the office.
It was getting dark by the time he'd made it back to his apartment building but luckily it was during that quieter time of evening where people were usually already home and having dinner with their families having finished work a few hours previous. He was grateful for this as he really had no explanation for his outfit: sweatpants that stopped above his ankles and a tshirt that looked close to splitting in half and showed a little too much of his lower abdomen in his opinion. Stark's wardrobe had limited options for a man of Steve's size.
Suddenly, Steve broke through the crowd and grabbed Tony's hand, "I know we said we weren't going to but I have a surprise for you."
As a result of their surveillance, neither were particularly surprised when the first obese drop tumbled from the heavens to land only yards from their feet. They shared a look that was interrupted by a further droplet landing directly on Tony's forehead which shocked them both. Steve laughed at the indignation expression plastered on the billionaire's face.
For a moment the detective couldn’t respond as his brain was unexpectedly short circuiting; he knew he found Steve objectivity attractive but he hadn’t realised that the man could have such an effect over him. The man’s words held so much power.
The fresh post-storm morning light woke Steve early but he still felt completely rested. Suddenly remembering, he span around to see if Tony was still sat on his bed but the man was gone leaving only wrinkles in the sheets he’d been sat on. The soldier sighed in slight disappointment but he didn’t want to start analysing why he was upset when he hadn't even had a chance to wake up completely.
Sitting on his bed, he peered down at his prosthetic leg as anger bubbled up in him. He balled his fist up and struck the metal which caused a cracking sound from the device. Steve had always wanted to do more, be more, help more but his amputation had taken him out from the field where he fought amongst his men. He’d been given the serum and bumped up to super soldier and never saw his team again. He didn’t even know if they were still alive. Maybe Stark was right, without the serum he would have been dead years ago from a surgery caused infection, nothing heroic. It was then that he reaffirmed that he would never claim the label of a hero.
Fury was disappointed in the result but seemed to dismiss it quickly which left Stark curious to what the man had up his sleeve. It was rare that Nick just let something slide. He lowered himself into one of the large chairs that sat adjacent to the mahogany desk which was littered with paperwork. Tony’s curiosity burned within him as he saw Captain Fury pull a case file out of a drawer on the desk. He didn’t wait long until it was revealed:
Tony was ready to go out and find Steve when suddenly Clint’s cell rang. He watched him answer it curiously.
Wrinkles formed in between the taller man's eyebrows and around his frowning lips. He hesitated to speak so Tony interrupted.
He huffed a laugh, "I'm running from a murder. I'm sure she'd make allowances." She definitely wouldn't agree with him being the one doing the murdering especially with her good old American sensibilities but he tried not to dwell.
It had been a significant amount of time since Stark had last completed an on-foot criminal chase as detectives were usually limited to the post-crime stuff; he could definitely feel this fact as his lungs began to burn and muscles throbbed at the unexpected sprint down the alley. The perp was gaining distance away from him and Tony was almost certain this guy was going to get away when suddenly a car pulled, full speed, onto the alley through a thin entrance. The brakes squealed and smoke poured off as the car skidded to a halt slap-bang in the centre of the path.
The doctor flushed and nodded before jogging back off to join the others. Bruce glanced back to gain another look as he began running in the opposite direction; his curiosity was similar to Stark’s in its scientific nature. However, Steve was silently pleased he didn’t have any more of an audience with his malfunctioning leg.
“Don’t even think about it. I thought similarly bad things of you.” Tony replied as he got ready to leave again.
Outside the car, on the street, things were turning to chaos with people running and shouting in all directions. It was hard to distinguish the victims of the bank hostage situation from those criminals simply fleeing the scene now that several police units had arrived at the same time.  Steve immediately lost sight of Tony amongst the crowd but he continued scanning the people rapidly; he may be off duty but that didn’t mean his detective instincts had just gone dormant. His blue eyes snapped across the road to see Tony getting in a struggle with an apparent perp. Without thinking, he moved to dart out the vehicle but the stab of his wound stopped him moving. He watched with baited breath with a hand pressed against his side.
“Okay, that’s basically a signal transmitter so it gets the leg ready for anything you are about to do and more. Give it a go.” Tony stepped back to give him space to explore.
“Well, I think that’s a perfect note to end on so Steve wants to thank everyone for coming and he looks forward to seeing you next time.” Steve didn’t actually say any of this as he was too busy rapidly signing at the child, asking about his school and family.
“What do you think you’re doing?” He snapped, clearing using what restraint he had left to prevent himself from cussing out both men. His eye was nearly popping out of its socket in anger.
He wasn’t dumb; he was going to die and that knowledge didn’t scare him at all. He’d had enough sleepless nights to ponder his death and the select number of friends he had probably wouldn’t even notice him gone. Except maybe Bucky. A stab of guilt wracked through him as he though of leaving Bucky behind. He hoped that somehow Bucky would be informed of his passing.
“Ah, detective Rogers. I’ve got the case set up on the board, if you’re ready?” Tony said with a raised eyebrow as the other man approached him. There was a couple of seconds of them just peering at each other with a slight disdain before the other man responded.
Tony smirked, “You should have. You’d probably be getting more than a prosthetic leg now if you did.”
“The game, it’s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there. Now, I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?”
"Where is-" He was cut off when a strong arm placed a damp cloth over his nose and mouth. In shock, Wright sucked in an urgent breath which, although he didn't know, was ultimately a mistake. The faster he breathed the sooner the potent dose of succinylcholine will be surging through his blood and into his brain.
The doctor sounded shocked despite all of the horrors he saw on a daily basis, “If that’s what you can call that...”
"Yes, I know and quite frankly I owe you so many I'm surprised you haven't repossessed my farm." He gave a gentle smile. Reminding Steve of their relationship and friendship that had endured years.
He leant against the door frame, "But you're clearly more proficient with a bow. Surely you get that it's pointless to put yourself at a disadvantage just because it's 'what you're supposed to use'." He placed air quotes around the final words.
"Okay... first off, you can relax. Nobody will hurt you here. I'm just trying to help. I treated your wounds.", Bucky tried a different approach. The boy didn't look at the bandages but he reached for the one on his arm. His hand was shaky when his fingers brushed over the fabric.
The strangers voice was distant, like Peter was under water and soon it became hard to listen. Soon, all he could hear was his own wheezing breath and a song. It was one of Wade's, the ones from his car. The dark and melancholic ones. Peter wasn't sure if it was playing or if he was only remembering the words but they rattled through his mind.
Bucky got up from his chair which was registered as a threat. The boy flinched away, curled up and braced himself for... for god knows what, Bucky could imagine a handful of things that the kid expected, all of which Bucky had endured himself.
"Not dead, just kidnapped by HYDRA.", he shrugged. He was patient with MJ, giving her time to get over her shock, like he knew she eventually would.
The two males quickly nodded, eager to respect Peter's wishes and after Tony stood up again the Superdads left the room.
"Why would she do that?", Tony asked him and Peter opened his mouth to reply something but instead he froze. He seemed to look for a reply but couldn't find one. In the end he just seemed confused.
"Aching, rebirth," Peter was dizzy, from the pain, from the bloodloss- "frost, golden," How long had he been here? How long until his family arrived? How long until- "trust, time," He registered the words, they still struck fear in him but what was a drop of fear in a sea of panic- "dusk, revelation," They didn't work, not anymore- "twice, son.", Keipon finished and Peter was still himself. As much as he'd rather be anyone else right now, it was still a relief in a way. The trigger words didn't work anymore. He was free, or at least his mind was. Peter would die as himself.
"Nah. But I got proof.", Wade shrugged, pulling his phone out of one of the pockets of his suit. He quickly typed Peter's name into Google and found an article that was a few months old, it was released for the tenth anniversary of the boy's supposed death. It also showed a picture of him, he had a striking resemblance not only to the Peter in his car right now but also the one from HYDRA's file.
"Sorry, you first. ", He said and Gwen chewed on her lip for a moment before taking a careful step forward.
"What are we doing right now?", Peter asked and Wade faced him again. His hair was pretty curly right now but it was still wildly hanging in his face and had no definitive length or style.
"Who is Gwen?", Tony asked and Peter narrowed his eyes at him. He sounded curious but also flippant, like it was a casual question.
MJ went in for a hug and Peter didn't back down from it. That was a new thing for the both of them, or so he thought.  MJ seemed to feel just as awkward as him whenever they hugged but they still did it and each time it got easier.
That left him with option d). Take him home, treat him himself, keep him secret until he knows more. It wasn't without risks. Maybe HYDRA was tracking him, even though Bucky doubted that. They would've picked him up by now, if they could do that. And even if he had a tracker, that was a risk with any other option. He also wasn't a medical professional. But out of all the options, this was the best one.
"The date itself was pretty good, yeah. But I'm just not into her that way, we're better off as friends. ", he shrugged and Wade relaxed a fraction. God, he was pathetic.
They didn't talk a lot about the time that they were separated, when Tony couldn't yet forgive Bucky for the death of his parents and Steve couldn't leave Bucky to himself. They both forgave each other, no tough feelings. But it was still a sore topic connected to a load of guilt. At least for Tony. Judging by the silence that followed after his question, Steve felt similarly. It took a while for him to reply.
Peter closed his eyes and took a shuddering breath before looking Natasha in the eyes again. "Did they tell you what you did to me?", he then asked with a poisonous smile on his lips. "Did you tell her?", he asked glancing over at Tony and Steve for a second.  When neither replied Peter just went on.
Wade left to go to the bathroom next door and Peter was left by himself. The boy desperately tried to hold on to consciousness but memories flashed before his eyes like fireworks.
"Shut up and move, blondie!", he snapped at Gwen and the girl scrambled away, curling up at Peter's side, while crying uncontrollably.
"You're her. Lady Death. ", he realized and fake-Wade grinned before his skin and flesh started to melt away. Suddenly Peter was sitting next to a skeleton that was dressed in a black coat and he was looking into empty eye sockets.
Yeah, there was no point in hiding from his voices but that didn't mean that he needed anyone else seeing him like this.
It didn't matter that he lost his balance and send them both falling to the floor. It didn't matter that they hadn't seen each other in months. And it didn't matter that moments before he had flinched away from her touch.
Tony couldn't focus, couldn't form an idea that would work. No tracker and the Quinjet was in stealth mode. When they tried to contact the jet Peter didn't reply.
"Whatever.", Peter shrugged, taking another drag. The burn was still there but it got easier and Peter didn't mind the buzz. It wasn't the numbness of whatever SHIELD gave him. He was still himself, just slightly better. The taste was still horrid, though.
I also added it to the tags to be safe even though it won't play a huge or graphic role in this story.
"I mean, I used to cut Stevie's hair back in the 40s. Been a while since then but I think I'll manage.", Bucky simply shrugged and went to the bathroom. He stepped out with a pair of scissors and clippers.
" If you say so...", he mumbled, already seeming a bit sharper. As soon as he became aware of his position he tensed and Wade released him from his arms. To his relief Peter didn't retreat completely, only curling up a few inches away from Wade, his eyes trained on him.
Once they put him on a bed, naked, and told him to keep his arms pressed to the headboard above his head as they cut him open just to watch him heal again. He had to stay present then, or the punishment would be much greater.
"That's enough. ", Wade mumbled but he didn't start up the car again, maybe because he knew that Peter wasn't done yet, wasn't off the ledge completely.
Happy, Tony's head of security, a guy that generally didn't look happy at all, let them out in front of Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children. Wade was friends with the owner of the bar and that's how he got the apartment above it.
With a shrug he lowered his hands and returned his eyes towards Wade. "I'll heal.", he said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world, like all of this wasn't awful.
"Of course! Come on in.", he nodded and Peter shuffled over to the kitchen counter, where the stack of Waffles was. He took one and stuffed it straight into his mouth. While he chewed on it, he watched Steve intently. There was something unsettling about Peter when he was like this, Steve had noticed it before. When he was sharp and quiet and focused he reminded Steve of Bucky. Of the Winter Soldier.
“Yeah but that’s embarrassing!” whined Tony. There was another short pause until JARVIS spoke up again, this time a little hesitant and a lot amused.
Tony could only nod, they hadn’t even really touched him yet, but this was all too new, too overwhelming.
“Baby I was laughin because after you came, which was absolutely breathtakin’ by the way, you collapsed onto Stevie’s face. You started to smother him,” Bucky responded with a shit eating grin on his face.
“Where do you think we should check first Tony? The kitchen? I swear I saw Jarvis preparing a fresh batch of cookies and after we show him how beautiful you are we can go have a snuggle and I can tell you a new story about the brave Captain America and his sidekick Bucky-”
“My apologies Sir. You had never explicitly told me to keep these videos from your fellow Avengers. Up until a few minutes ago everyone seemed to be having quite the time and nothing seemed to go against my programming towards your safety. Therefore I did not block the Avengers from watching.” The AI at least sounded a little apologetic.
The camera dropped from Jarvis’s hands and landed on it’s side. The Avengers watching in horror as on screen Jarvis runs after the father and son, the hysterical cries echoing from the TV. Not one of the gathered dared to say anything, eyes still riveted to the screen.
“Ouch!” yelled an unknown voice. On screen a little girl dressed in a white dress with a large pink bow tied around her waist ran into the scene. The little girl had long blonde hair, tied up in a matching pink satin bow. The girl was smiling smugly to someone off camera. She sat quickly next to the piano and began smoothing down her dress and running her fingers through her hair, looking ever the proper one.
“Yeah, we would do it all the time before I was sent to boarding school. He always let me pick what to make. I can’t believe that he let a one year old make a pizza though.”
“Nuh uh soldier. Rule applies to you. Don’t think I forgot about you.” Tony tried not to smile as the same exact expression that Bucky had, showed up on Steve’s face. Without another word Steve climbed off the bed and joined Bucky in the bathroom.
Today was the first day that the Avengers had a chance to relax, warm and safe. Emphasis on warm and safe. As it comes with the job of being the world’s mightiest heroes who defend the world when it needs it, the whole team had been out in the cold defending the world against a villain trying to make a name for himself. There had been a lot of yelling, firework like explosions, squishy apple strudels filled with what were definitely not real apples, and very large mutant fruit bats. Needless to say it had been a very weird few days.
Bucky pulled back looking concerned, while Tony gasped in air. “Tones, don’t ever, ever think that way. Stevie and I love you more than anything and they only way you could get rid of us is if you tell us you want us gone. Now,” Bucky smirked peeking down into the bubbles making Tony blush furiously, “By the looks of it, you feel the exact opposite, and baby?” asked Bucky
Tony sighed again, just thinking about his boyfriends made him giddy. At first he was sceptical and shocked to say the least that the two older men, who just so happened to be famous super soldiers were interested in him. Not just for money, or reputation or-or the sex. But for him.
Everyone’s attention was quickly back on the screen, waiting eagerly for the video to start. Tony chewed on his bottom lip. He couldn’t help to be nervous about what could be on the tape. What if it was something with Howard again? What if it was something worse? These tapes were ancient and he had to admit to himself that he couldn’t remember everything on the tapes.His nervous thoughts were interrupted when a thumb gently pried his lip out from between his teeth.
Jarvis let out a laugh, “That good huh? Well you heard it here ladies and gentlemen. Another delicious meal here on the Tony and Jarvis cooking show.” Jarvis leaned over and the screen went dark again.
The little boy gasped, a horrified expression on his face. The man behind the camera tried to contain his laughter at the boy. On little feet he ran as fast as he could to the pile of blankets on the floor, the camera following his every move. With a few grunts and a small struggle to lift the blankets there was a pause and then an ecstatic “ ‘ucky beh!” and the boy and bear were reunited at last, a reunion that warmed the heart to anyone who was watching. Chubby arms encircled the bear and shrill happy shrieking was heard on screen as the boy jumped up and down in his happiness.
The warmth at his back began to rumble, “Mm, baby doll, good morning.” Tony stilled instantly as a metal arm wrapped securely around his waist.
“That’s right,” added Bucky, “Whatever you want. Now,” Bucky reached his hand down to cup Tony through his sleep shirt,” You want some help with this sweet thing?”
Tony blushed hotly, “Don’t- don’t look!” Tony attempted to close his legs, but two strong hands, one metal one flesh grabbed onto his ankles, preventing him from closing.
Realization dawned on Steve, “Wait...Tony’s home videos?” Steve received huge mischievous smirks in response.
I'm back and still completely amazed by the constant feedback I am getting! I've read all the comments and have read the suggestions. I don't know if I'll be able to completely fulfill all of them but I will try my hardest! I only see maybe 1-3 more chapters left? But who knows things can change. Anyway here's the next chapter!
"What did you do to her?", Peter asked. Keipon loved a good speech, loved to share his fucked up genius. If Peter got him to waffle for a bit he could buy himself more time, could buy his family more time.
"I read between the lines.", Wade shrugged, really hoping that he didn't say the wrong thing. "You shouldn't talk down on yourself like that."
He stopped juggling immediately. Peter wasn't exactly sure why he told Wade that. It kinda just slipped out and he already prepared himself for the inevitable tension but Wade just laughed it off.
"Then we'll have to stop you.", Tony stated and it sounded like a threat. Peter wanted to believe him, he really did but it was difficult. He could never rely on anyone saving him.
"It's not that easy! He's home, he's back with his family, he's probably healing or some shit, becoming the person he's supposed to be. How the fuck am I supposed to fit into that picture?", he explained before sitting up again,  his eyes lowered to the ground. "Besides, he made it pretty fucking clear that he didn't need me anymore. "
"And you're really sure that it's Gwen? If you get him here and it isn't her, he'll be fucking pissed off.", Wade pointed out. That was his biggest worry, that if this turned out to be a false alarm, the disappointment would turn Peter even further away from them.
"Wade, you're panicking-", Bucky started,  trying to maintain a calm tone but Wade wasn't having it.
was found in the arctic. He saw pictures, though, heard stories, of the good times. A face showed up before his mental eye, little Peter, 9 years old, messy dark curls and equally dark eyes, still a little chubby, soft in a way only kids are.
Slowly Peter calmed down. He clung to this memory, the only memory he had from before and let it calm his mind. After several more minutes of ragged breathing he finally calmed down enough to open his eyes again. MJ was floating several feet away, her eyes wide with fear. "Okay...Okay, I've got it, I think. I'm sorry.", he breathed out before raising his hands out of the water and pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes.
Wade swallowed thickly before answering, tears stung his eyes. "She likes to play with my feelings, my pain. Shows me what I want and twists it into something awful. She looks like Vanessa and pretends to love me, she looks like you-", Wade cut himself off but the words were out.
"I want to hear it from her. ", Peter stated, glancing up at his father. If he heard it from Gwen herself, he'd believe it. He'd trust her to make her own decisions. Peter also just really wanted to see her.
"Have you ever been in love?", he asked and Peter froze, glancing at Wade and then back at his hands.
Anyways,I hope you enjoy this one, there's probably gonna be more fluff for now so tell me if you like it!
Then his father laughed. Or rather, he smirked, evolving into a chuckle that may or may not have sounded a bit hysterical and even Peter's over imaginative mind didn't know what to make of this.
"Okay, thank you. I just need a headstart.", Peter replied, getting up from the couch like he was going to run off again. It took Bucky a second to realize that that was exactly his plan.
He stormed up to the door of a nightclub, that's what it looked like today and Death was the bouncer. She looked like Vanessa, what a surprise. Wade never got used to the tug that his heart made every time he saw her. He knew that it wasn't really her, but still.
"You better hurry, or you'll have two HYDRA agents on your hands. Hail HYDRA.", Gwen replied before abruptly ending the call.
They were still in the bedroom, Peter didn't feel ready to leave it yet. The thought of facing Tony and Steve after the last couple of days sent shivers down his spine. It only now hit him how dysfunctional he had to seem in their minds. It's not like they were wrong either. Peter's behavior was unacceptable and if he didn't get it in line, sooner or later they'd grow tired of him, if they didn't already.
"Cheers to that.", Bucky replied with a smirk before combing through Peter's hair one last time. "So, go take a look.", he ordered and Peter got up from his chair and made his way to the bathroom.
. He wanted to claw his arms open. A little voice said he shouldn't, though he couldn't remember why. So he did. It felt okay, but only for a second, it didn't lessen the pain inside of him. He clawed at his arm while something else clawed at his insides, tore them to shreds. Peter knew how it felt to be torn apart. It felt something like this.
Work. It always took Tony's mind off things, he just needed to find a project that would keep him busy, overtake his thoughts. Then Afghanistan happened.
His eyes lingered on Natasha and it looked like he might say something but instead they found his father. His gaze softened and Wade couldn't remember the last time Peter looked at Tony like this, with no animosity or resentment whatsoever. "Thank you."
When he did Wade was careful, painfully careful as he wrapped his arms around Peter gently. Even though all he wanted to do was give him an embrace with all his strength and adoration, never letting go. But he couldn't do that, so he took it slow as Peter clung to him.
the only person she cared about! And she knows that it could happen again at any time. She doesn't want to be a danger.", Tony explained and he sounded so fucking genuine that Peter really wanted to believe him. But he had been burned so many times that he just couldn't.
"Now get in the car, we need to get away from here.", he announced before walking over to his own smashed pick-up to get his belongings out of it.
Peter glanced up at him, his eyes were unfocused, his lips were turning blue. Love was vicious torture and Wade didn't know why he put himself through it over and over again.
The concept seemed to be truthful, too. Peter hugged Wade, he didn't freak out, he behaved like a normal person. Now Wade didn't treat him quite as delicately. He was closer to how he was at the beginning and Peter would make sure to get him back to that, to make Wade comfortable with him again, to convince his father and Steve that he wasn't a lost cause. He'd do whatever, he'd behave, he'd be a good boy.
"What- What would it take for you to give Peter back to me?", he asked, gently this time, slowly approaching her again.  "Come on, I'll do whatever you want, just- give him a second chance.", he asked, trying to get her to look into his eyes.
"Wade, if you're suggesting what I think you are suggesting, I'd really recommend you to rethink that for a second.", Peter said, a dangerous edge to his voice, a warning,
"What's it like to die? I mean, once you're dead, if you don't mind me asking.", Peter then asked. That was actually a far easier topic, going to the afterlife was like a visit to the dentist. So Wade told Peter about it. About how he felt when he woke up on the other side, how much easier, how much clearer it all was, without the voices, the pain, the darkness. When he was finished Peter let out a smirk. Wade couldn't see his face, he was staring at the ceiling. "What's so funny?", he asked.
And a week or two ago Peter wouldn't have answered it. But now? It was still difficult but he felt separated enough from the incident and so much closer to MJ than ever before, so he decided to give in, at least a little.
"Shut up!", he pleaded but this didn't wipe the grin off Bucky's face. "I'm just... I don't know, I look like a mop.", he confessed eventually. It wasn't like he was trying to dress up or anything, he just wanted to maybe look a bit less pathetic.
3 things he could feel.  The scratchy motel blanket against his skin, damp hair against his forehead, his sweaty shirt sticking to his back.
"The accords give the government the right to detain Supers in case they are a danger to others, which Peter is... Furthermore they can hold him until he's either rehabilitated or if that isn't possible... indefinitely.", Tony explained and he just sounded so fucking tired.
" No, I have a fast metabolism, you burn through calories like Alduin burned Helgen. ", MJ returned and Peter raised his eyebrows.
"I said I'm good. I need to talk to her!", he snapped back and something in his tone made Bucky back down. Peter ran out into the night but he was slowed down by his pain. "MJ wait! Can you slow down? I'm sort of bleeding out right now!", he called after her and that actually got her to stop dead in her tracks, head whipping around to face Peter.
Peter didn't take a liking to them talking about his state. His manic smile turned into a furious grimace. "You know, it's not very nice to talk about someone in third person when they are present. ", he snarled, his voice as sharp as a knife. Then he grabbed his bedside lamp and ripped the chord out of the wall before throwing it at them, yelling:"Now get the fuck out of my room. I can't stand looking at you!" His aim was a little off, so the lamp just shattered against the wall next to them but the crash still made Wade flinch.
"Oh, okay...", he only said before reaching for a single slice of bread and starting to nibble on it.
"Oh no, you definitely did. You made a fucking friend. ", Bucky nodded, sounding so fucking satisfied.
He didn't, though. Instead Tony gave him a soft look before turning his eyes towards the sky, too. He looked pained and tired. His eyes were rimmed with red, he looked a little gaunt, older than when they first met. Peter realized that he was doing this. "You have no idea how often I've felt that. The thing is, there aren't any easy options. It wasn't easy for Bucky, it was just his only option. If you wanna try SHIELD's method we can do that. But is that really what you want?"
Peter didn't sleep anymore. At least it didn't feel like sleep. He didn't get tired and he didn't feel rested afterwards. He just went to bed and when his mind shut off he found himself in the same dream. At least he thought it was a dream. It somehow felt more real while also making absolutely no sense.
"I hope you don't regret that decision. It's not going to be pretty.", he stated before walking down and jumping into his bedroom again.
"I didn't.", Tony snapped back, clearly irritated as well. "They got to her before we did. We're lucky that we even know about her."
Once she came out from under the bed she wasted no time before flipping the file open and starting to skim through it. She skipped most of the gory details. No matter what Steve and Tony though, she wasn't doing this out of some twisted enjoyment. It was just a safety measure. It was still hard, though. The things they did to him, the descriptions, the pictures. It was all awfully familiar and horrifying in a unique way at the same time. It sent shivers down her spine.
"Yes, I am.",Tony nodded. Back at SHIELD he had seemed incredibly confident, that confidence seemed gone now.
Natasha opened the door to her apartment and Peter didn't wait for an invitation to step in, pushing past her immediately. "Where is she-", he asked, looking around the empty living room.
"He climbed out of his room and onto the roof.", she replied and a statement like this still got Tony's heart to skip a beat. But he also knew that this wasn't unlike Peter, either.
Lorenz smiled. Peter hated her, he wanted to rip that smile off her face. She patted his cheek. It was gentle and that's why it hurt. Then she forced a bit into his mouth , still smiling.
Tony looked worse than usual, which was saying something. The return of his long lost son had seemingly aged him quite a bit but this was nothing compared to the absolutely exhausted and hollow look that he was sporting now. The dark circles around his eyes looked like bruises, his cheeks were hollow and his eyes red. "Tony? Did you find something?", Stave asked, and even though he tried to sound hopeful there was a quiver of fear in his voice.
"I'm just glad you're okay- I'm- Am I interrupting something?", he asked, glancing over at MJ who also got up now. It didn't go past Peter how she wrapped her towel tighter around herself.
"I really thought you were gone for good.", he whispered. Peter lowered his eyes until his long black lashes brushed against his cheeks.
"Yeah, I know that! You only told me about 300 times. But this time it's different, you made a mistake.", he tried to argue but Death was already shaking her head.
Even in the dark it was breathtaking, daunting, just a lot. Peter suddenly felt a weird sense of embarrassment. Not at Tony or the house per se, but more at himself. He never felt like he belonged here but now that Gwen saw this life that he'd suddenly been dropped in, he felt even more like an imposter. "This is your home.", Gwen said, looking up at him with wide eyes. It wasn't phrased as a question but Peter still nodded. "And you're his father.", she then said, facing Tony straight on, her expression turning stony. Peter recognized that familiar expression on her face, she was being protective.
He knew that Tony was a stress eater and Peter also needed food as soon as he woke up. Steve also needed to do something to not feel useless. Add that to the fact that his lover seemed to be in a state of shock and Steve found himself pretty busy.
"Hey, it's fine if this is a lot right now, you need to get used to all of this first and that'll take a while. But I want you to know that you're safe now. I won't hurt you and you're not a prisoner anymore, I won't make you do anything that you don't want. Pinky promise!", he stated, holding out his pinky finger. Peter didn't even look at it.
It was a little drafty in Steve's studio but Peter didn't feel the cold anymore. Still, he wondered if it had been a bad idea to let MJ paint him shirtless for her art school portfolio. He never knew how to say no to her, so there they were, in Steve's studio in the Avengers tower.
"Teammates?", Peter asked with raised eyebrows, actually looking at Wade now. It was strange that Peter really didn't seem to mind that Wade wasn't wearing his mask. Maybe it had something to do with his own distaste for his appearance. Wade didn't quite believe him when Peter talked about how he didn't want to look at himself. After what he saw at the bathroom this morning that doubt was gone.
"About an hour boss, they're heading south. I've located them and calibrated a route.", FRIDAY replied and a route marked in red appeared on the screen.
That's when Tony came in, looking rumpled and smeared in something that looked like oil. "Hey, you're up.", he said with a smile.
"Or you could go home, let people who love you take care of you.", he suggested and Peter shook his head wildly.
Peter still didn't reply to that, his eyes focused on his hands in his lap. Bucky could almost see the cogs turning in his head. A different approach, then. "Besides, Steve told me that they are pretty devastated, all of them. They think that you're dead."
"That's the kind of enthusiasm I'm looking for!", Bucky chuckled, his arms crossed over his chest. He looked proud, and Peter didn't think that it had to do with the hair.
It reminded Wade of motels and laying by the pool under the night sky and breathless laughter mixed with tears. But still, it didn't mean that Wade knew what to do now. "Baby boy, if you want me to stop doing all of that, I will. But is this really what you want?"
(I swear I didn't plan on making Natasha borderline antagonistic, I love her, it just kinda happened??? Maybe I can come up with a redemption arc somehow.)
"Peter?" It was Gwen and she sounded terrified. Peter set himself into motion right away, getting up and striding over to the bedroom door, opening it and stepping out onto the hallway.
They were sitting in their bed, theirs legs entangled under the blanket, both on separate laptops. That's what their nights turned into in the past few days, researching severe trauma in teenagers, trying to understand this kid a bit better.
"No, please, can you talk to me, so that I don't spiral?", he asked and he hated how needy he sounded.
Tony tried to ground himself, he tried to take in his surroundings. Steve was chewing on his lips nervously, his hand was in Tony's, strong and reassuring. Bucky was smoking a cigarette. Tony did a double take. He didn't know that Bucky smoked. Maybe it was a nervousness thing. Wade had dressed in normal clothes but with a sweater that had the hood up. He hid away in it. Tony could see his lips moving ever so slightly, like he was mumbling something. He couldn't hear anything though.
Still, he felt better, more energized, the little bit of food he managed to keep in still wasn't enough for his metabolism but at least he wasn't absolutely miserable. He still didn't try to run, though. There was no point, he just got back into the car and drove off with Wade.
"We have a large age gap, so what?", Bucky asked. A thoughtful expression made it's way onto Peter's face. Bucky preferred it to the void.
"What if I don't want them back?", Peter suddenly asked and the unprompted question surprised Wade so much that he wasn't sure if he really heard him ask it.
"No it's not. I'm dead, and Wade can't die. ", Peter replied. He hadn't forgotten his last moment, how he had lain in Wade's arms as his lungs filled with blood. He was dead, and if he was dead, this had to be the afterlife, which ment-
Peter fell asleep a few hours after sun set. Wade was honestly surprised that he managed to do that. He'd been so incredibly tense all day that any form of relaxation seemed unlikely.
"Oh shut it, I ain't got anything to do with it. He wouldn't even talk to me at first.", he waved him off but Tony wouldn't let this go easily.
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Please leave your thoughts in the comments, I absolutely love reading them!
Right now it looked like the entrance to a theme park, in the distance he could see a rollercoaster. Wade had no idea why it looked that way, it always seemed quite random.
"It was stupid... I'm sorry... Forget that I said anything...", he whimpered, his whole body trembling like he would come apart any second.
Tony looked like he might just cry, instead he dared to smile a little before nodding. "Don't mention it. Did you hurt you hand badly?"
"So did I." Peter's smile hovered for a second before fading slightly. Suddenly his eyes were downcast, his shoulders were more tense. Like he was bracing himself. Wade just had no clue for what.
"Of course!", Wade exclaimed and they were kissing again. And it was just as good as the first time.
Wade was in awe, truly. How dare he? How dare he be a good person? There were so few of them and they never got what they deserved. Wade thought of Vanessa, bleeding out in his arms. She never cared either, always took all the shit Wade threw at her and dealt with it.
Natasha didn't react to Peter's words at first, still exchanging meaningful looks with Steve. Finally she let out a short sigh. "Fine, but you behave. And no leaving the cell for now."
“Tony is a dick and Steve is the opposite of a dick. Tony is loud and obnoxious while Steve is quiet and reflective. What I’m trying to say is that yes, I thought they’d make a bad couple but that’s because I’d never seen them as a couple. Seeing them as a couple allowed me to see them each as an individual more clearly...”
"Ah, but that's not me. When on a case I'm in disguise and in character. Sure, S-... I might not wish to talk with that person but Luke Chamliss or Michael Smith is more than willing to talk to anyone."
"Look, Clint isn't exactly well known for coming up with inventive phone passwords and I'm calling because you said you didn't know who I am."
Steve returned the file to the other man’s desk but didn’t place a response. He wanted to see how confident Stark was about Steve definitely turning up. Would the man still go without a definite answer or skip the event?
Steve immediately sat up as a realisation struck him. A dark, mischievous look passed over his features as he smirked at his lover.
Peter made a sound, it might've been a smirk, but more empty. He didn't look at Bucky. "I don't know. I'm feeling ...
Peter waved her off. "Yeah, hello, whatever, I wanna see-", the rest of his sentence died in his throat when another door opened.
Gwen looked around nervously and Wade recognized the same fear and panic in her that Peter displayed when he felt trapped. Her eyes finally lingered on the window as if she knew that they were watching them, which she probably did. "Peter... I don't want to be here, I don't trust them. ", she stated and Peter nodded.
Wade's heart skipped a beat. He was really here, and he looked better, tired and stressed but all in all better. He was still a little startling though. Something about the way he carried himself was different, he had an urgency to his step, he stood straighter, he didn't look as fragile anymore, stronger but somehow raw. He also had a cigarette between his lips and
She was tall, almost as tall as Peter and somehow managed to be even thinner. Her skin was dark and her long curls were pulled back into a ponytail but several curls had escaped and were now framing her face.
"You'd do that?", he asked and his tone was so heartbreakingly hopeful that Bucky had no other choice but to agree.
' Peter proved him right in the worst way. Instead of getting on his feet the boy sank to his knees, crossing his wrists behind his back and lowering his head in submission.
Also, I usually don't plan everything in my story ahead. I have a rough outline but that's it. Sometimes I get random plot ideas and boy oh boy did I come up with something.
"Hey Weasel, is Wade home?", Peter asked the barkeeper as he carried another box of bottles to the bar.
Eventually she calmed down enough that Peter could sit her down on the toilet seat and help her dress. Tony had brought some underwear, a pair of sweats, a soft sweater and fuzzy socks. Peter knew that Gwen preferred being barefoot, like him, so he put the socks aside. The rest of the clothes were too big, as Tony had assumed, but at least she didn't look like a prisoner anymore. Even once she was fully dressed, Gwen didn't seem ready to move, so Peter just picked up a hairbrush and started to carefully brush her hair and untangle it.
"Enjoy your time with him.", she then said softly. "But don't forget. He has an expiration date. And it might be sooner than you think."
Remember when I said that the next chapter would be a Tony/Peter reunion? Yeah, I kinda lied. It's coming, though! So stay tuned!
"No.", Peter stated. Because he couldn't believe that, he couldn't even entertain the thought for a fucking second, because he wanted it to be true so badly, and if he let himself hope the inevitable disappointment might kill him.
Peter ignored his warning and chose to answer his first question instead. "Yeah, but it could be worse. I saw what you did to the agents,  I don't want that happening to me and I know that there would be no point
"It's okay.", Peter shrugged before taking another drag. A beat of silence followed, then:"Do you think she's mad at me?"
First Wade, now Bucky. Tony should start to make a list of people he owed all of his happiness to. He'd get them some extraordinary Christmas presents, maybe a Tesla.
This boy was HYDRA, or at least he used to be. Normally Bucky had no sympathy for HYDRA agents, but this one was different. He was still a kid, and he was dying, or at least it looked like it. Bucky ran through every possible scenario that came after this.
"Would that be that hard to believe?", Tony whispered, leaning forward. To his dismay that made Peter flinch back ever so slightly, tensing up again. Tony immediately corrected his position and Peter relaxed slightly.
She was curled up on an armchair, not dressed in scrubs but in sweats and a sweater, her legs pulled to her chest, her chin resting on her knees. No shakles, no collar. She looked unharmed.
His issue was the shirt, it was a button up with short sleeves and it was almost oversized on him. The silky material had a sort of headache inducing pattern. Red background, yellow flowers and green leaves.
Okay, this one is super fucking dark (hello Peter's POV) and I'll warn you that there is a suicide attempt in this. I'll mark it with this ** so that you can skip it. If you'd rather not read this chapter I'll add a short summary in the end notes.
Tony had to let out a laugh at that. "Hypocrite much? You're like one giant secret, a big fat question mark."
"So I don't have a mother?", the question was casual, too casual for the topic but Tony seemed to pick up on that and only froze for a split second.
"Okay.", Peter forced himself to say, his voice was foreign, an empty echo. He sounded dead but there wasn't enough left of Peter to be upset about that.
Breakfast was a quiet and awkward affair and Tony always waited until he was absolutely sure that Peter wouldn't eat anything more unless they literally shoved it down his throat.
"When... when do you think I can go here again?", he asked carefully. Again, he didn't look at Tony, waiting for his reply instead. Bracing himself for it, for Tony to laugh at him and call him pathetic.
"And I'm thankful for that. Really. Thank you for taking care of her. ", Peter told her and Tony knew that he was being genuine. Peter let go of Gwen's hand and pulled her to his side instead, where he smiled down at her.
Steve was so stunned by the honesty that it took him a second to reply. "But isn't that a bit pessimistic?", he asked and cursed himself straight away.
"Are you mad at me?", the words made Wade flinch, not because they were particularly loud or vicious, any sound that cut through the silence was intense. Peter didn't look at him, didn't make any indication that he ever said anything and for a moment, Wade wasn't sure if he had imagined that.
