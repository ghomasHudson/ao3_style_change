“But it's all gone,” he admitted, his voice so shaky that it made Jude's heartache, “The house. The girls. My childhood... It all burned up. It's like I was never here at all.”
Something about the way Gabriel referred to Castiel falling into Dean's arms made a small tingle reverberate up the angel's spine. Cas had never looked at it that way before, but perhaps Gabriel was right. Perhaps Castiel had simply tumbled from heaven like a feather and floated down into Dean's path for a reason. The thought made the angel smile.
Dean braced himself, knowing that he would have to own up to his terrible actions.
why I can't do it,” Sam said slowly again, giving him at stern look.
“No,” Jude denied, shaking his head, “She doesn't have a unicorn... I think Deadpool does, but Daddy won't let me see his comics.”
that way.”
“Maybe he thinks we’re dead,” Dad guessed.
the trickster would have picked a place like this to stay. What other room would he have chosen besides room 69? The bastard...
Bobby's kitchen was a much calmer setting than the one in the bunker. Bobby and Crowley were the only souls around, other than the three hellhound dogs laying around on the floor. Luckily, Jude and Clare's presence didn't disturb the peaceful atmosphere. They helped Bobby do some research for a while before sneaking off to Clare's bedroom for some snuggle time – and a bit of making out. But when dinner time rolled around, the engaged couple made their way back to the kitchen for the planned meal.
Jessica couldn't hold back her giggle. It was so cute to see Ollie trying so hard to impress her. Especially when the truth was that he had always been impressive.
Though he looked paler than a sheet of paper, Oliver visibly gulped and returned his stare to Jess. She tried her best to calm him through their gaze alone, giving him a gentle smile. He slipped the ring back onto her finger and took a deep breath.
“This is delicious, Jess,” Sam praised.
"Are you sure?" Jude gently pressed, "It's chili. My dad makes it kinda sweet, not spicy."
Papa tilted his head down and narrowed his golden eyes, giving Dad a stern, authoritative look.
to us. But guess what? I'm sure Jane and Eddie catch a lot of shit for being an interracial couple. Especially in this cookie-cutter neighborhood. I doubt the folks in town roll out the red carpet for the Hispanic woman at the grocery store, you know? Plus, Jane is way out of Eddie's league. That alone is weird enough.”
"Hey, Dad," Jess replied, "What's up?"
“Yeah?” he asked flatly.
Clarence raised his head to finally look at Jess. Her voice was soft and comforting when she interrupted him, and her watery eyes were full of a certain type of wisdom when she looked at him.
Jude knew that Meg was referring to the night Caldwell tried to get Clare to kill her. Other than the parts he was there for, Jude only knew what Clarence had told him about it. At the mention of saving his mother, Clare's cheeks blushed a little and he looked – kind of proud. Jude was glad that his fiance was happy, but part of him worried. What if Meg got Clare's hopes up and then devastated him all over again? After the small look, Meg's eyes seemed to grow with desperation and she searched all the other faces in the room.
want Meg to stay?” he questioned, “Does she owe you something?”
No way! Daddy had a dad too! What was he like? Was he brave and strong like Dad? Was he sweet and cuddly like Papa? Was he smart and tall like uncle Sam? Was he funny and short like uncle Gabe? Or was he old and gentle like uncle Bobby? Questions filled up Jude's whole mind and he could feel his heart thumping with excitement. He really wanted to meet Daddy's dad! Why didn't anybody ever mention him before?
He carefully reached over and took Jude's tiny hand, letting the plastic Batman and Superman slide together in their palms. The man made sure he had his child's full attention before he said his next words.
“This beanpole figured it out,” Gabe answered, nudging Sam a bit.
The more he looked for Oliver, the more concerned Sam became. He knew from personal experience how difficult it was to get used to the idea of having a kid and being a dad. But Ollie was missing the big picture. The poor kid was forgetting how amazing it was going to be to have a little family of his own; to look down into a child's face and see his own eyes staring back at him. One of the greatest treasures Sam had ever been blessed with was being able to look at Jessica and see not only her, but himself and Gabe, too. What would it take to get Oliver to realize that?
Sam blinked toward Dean and his face turned a little pink. Bashfulness was written all over his face.
No reply came. No sound was made. Nothing came into view. She couldn't even feel anything. Where was everyone?! Surely Michael and Jude were looking for her, right?! What if the Darkness had taken her to Purgatory, like it did to her parents?
Dean grinned down at his niece's lovely attempt to get him to comply with her request. He walked over and ruffled the top of Jessica's blonde hair.
It only took Jessie a few seconds to locate Ollie's mom. The sound of her loud Spanish voice was a dead giveaway. She was staring out the window at the front, gripping her car keys tight with one hand and clutching her cell phone with the other. Thankfully, Jessie was able to approach Ms. Jane from behind, which gave her the added advantage of stealth.
The lone angel didn't answer Dean's questions. He only stood in the corner like a statue, not even looking in Dean's direction. For a few seconds, Dean tried desperately to yank himself free from the chains, hoping to at least get an arm free. But it was no use. Those assholes had buckled him down tight to the metal chair. Dean's heart was racing with dread as he stared sideways at the white door to his right. Oh, God. What were they planning to do to Sam? A few seconds of silence went by before the sound of Sam's voice echoed from another room.
“Hi, Clare,” Jess called with a wave.
The angel plucked his mouth from Dean's in order to drop to his knees. Castiel quickly snapped open Dean's belt and tugged his pants and undergarments back enough to release his swollen shaft. Cas had been right. Seminal fluid was already leaking from Dean's stiff organ, oozing from the tip in preparation for ejaculation. Castiel took the heated erection into his mouth at once, stimulating the sensitive member with his rolling tongue and tightening lips. Dean's hands were digging fiercely into the angel's shoulders and his tiny whimpers were mixing with the sounds of the livestock, blending seamlessly into the noisy atmosphere. But Castiel was only able to bob his head a few times before Dean backed away.
“Darling, I'm going to need your globe,” he said, “And some rubbing alcohol. And those left-over Jellyfish parts, if you have them.”
Jude and Ollie looked at each other with worry. Uh-oh. Did Jessie have to go away?
“Mr. Gabe? What about the unicorns?” he asked, sounding sad.
While the guys joked, a large gust of wind swept through Jude’s kitchen, flapping the loose coffee filters on the counter and waving the curtains hanging over the windows. Michael, Gabriel, and Cas all showed up at once, standing with each other near the front door. Dean instantly stood up from his chair to face the angels, searching for any sign of confirmation on their faces. He was desperate to know if their home would be saved from destruction.
“You mean a raincheck?”
Dean cut the Impala's engine and turned around in his seat to look at the excited children behind him.
Dean stared with anger and confusion as he watched Crowley softly brush off the worn fabric of Bobby's hat. It was one that the old man wore all the time; the blue one, with the rip in the corner of the bill. The hat was almost as old as Dean himself, adorned with rips and tears that Bobby wore like a helmet into battle. And Crowley was handling it delicately in his hands like it was made of gold, touching it soft and slow while he stared deeply into Bobby's eyes.
“Yeah, but, that's not the kid's name,” Dean replied, shaking his head, “I mean, I wasn't calling him Jude or anything. I was just singing the song -”
Sam huffed a breath. Oh, God. A surprise? From Gabe? There was no telling what kind of crazy things the trickster had planned. Sammy reached over to wipe his phone from the bedside table and look at the time. It was almost nine-thirty in the morning.
As if Gabriel had heard Castiel's question, Dean suddenly appeared next to him. The man was laying on the ground with a gun in his hand, clutching his own side. He, too, was briefly befuddled by his change of surroundings, but quickly realized that he was pointing a gun at his own family and dropped the weapon. Castiel instantly scanned the man's body to make sure he was unharmed – and found red liquid oozing from between his fingers on his side.
In fact, Gabe was so happy that he almost didn't notice the open pie sitting on the counter until he completely walked passed it. The warm, sweet smell of it hit him first. Then, the realization of what he just saw slowly caught up with him, making his whistle slow down to a few notes and gradually fade away. Wait a second. Where did that pie come from? The bunker was void of pie the day before. The archangel spun around to inspect the dessert closer, seeing that it was steaming like it had just come out of the oven, but it was already half gone. Four pieces were missing... and it was
! I can't wait to get to South Dakota! Holy shit, it's gonna be so...”
The archangel sighed at the sound of his husband's voice. Gabe didn't really feel like talking. Could Sam tell?
Jessica opened one eye, scanning all of the eager and loving faces in front of her. They were all hovering around her and waiting to hear the verdict, but Jess wanted to be as precise as possible.
Now, Papa and Dad really were Oliver's parents. Just like he always wanted them to be...
“But... How did you get your own body? I thought we were in the cage and...” Adam trailed off, his sight flickering around the room as he held onto Michael's hand, “We're not in hell anymore?”
“I, um. I just wanted to say...” he gulped, finally raising his head to look Dean in the eye, “I'm sorry that Grandpa John wasn't there to save you. That wasn't very nice of him... But
. From his time spent in heaven, Gabe had learned a thing or two about the 'cupid' line of work. Back in those days, aphrodisiacs were mostly crafted for mating and procreating purposes. The stronger the dose, the more likely that the 'dirty dancing' would lead to a chunkier population. But Gabe also knew how to tweak the recipes to make sex almost irresistible. He knew exactly which spells to add that would make orgasm much more intense and last far longer than the run-of-the-mill sex. And since Jessie and Oliver were about to be married and
“Sure, I'll take a slice,” Clare nodded, turning to look toward Jude with his jet black eyes, “Jay? You want some?”
“So have I,” Clare replied ominously.
“Yes,” Cas breathed simply, “The answer will forever be
For some reason, touching Cas made Dean remember what happened at the store when they were attacked by those random angels. Part of Dean was worried that more angels would attack through the night and try to kill them or something. So the man left his hand on top of Cas's warm bump in a protective manner, just in case anyone was stupid enough to break into Bobby's house and try to hurt his angel or his kid. Dean would never let
Bobby laughed along with everyone else as Gabriel yanked Sam down into a firm kiss. It was a little steamy for Bobby's taste, but entertaining none the less. He and the rest of the crowd applauded and stood to congratulate the newly wed couple. They kept kissing for what seemed like a few minutes before Sam finally pulled away to pick up Jessica and let her join in the celebration. Gabriel picked Dickie up too, and Bobby couldn't help but think about what a cute little family they made. Aww. They were all so in love. Where the hell was a camera when Bobby needed one?
Lucifer raised the scythe to grip it with both hands as he watched the five beings step out and create a loose semicircle to face him. The devil groaned and rolled his red eyes. Did they really think they could stand up to him? Would he really have to kill them all just to make a point?
Everyone looked toward the blonde demon boy in the kitchen, who was suddenly wearing a huge smile. Chicago was his home; the place where he was born, abandoned, raised by witches, and finished going up on the street. He probably knew every single nook and cranny of that city. And hearing that Michael was there seemed to make his day.
Castiel gulped, feeling his own member twitch. Yes. He did, indeed, know what Dean wanted. The man was nearly always craving it – to be penetrated by the angel's hard organ. Castiel returned to his feet at once to begin undoing his own pants. His blue eyes were glued to the man before him, watching Dean quickly slide the clothing down his bow legs. Dean's hands were visibly trembling and fumbling with the fabric, but he eventually unhooked the pants from one leg, just enough for Castiel to gain access to his backside.
The room stayed quiet but Jessica felt better after talking. Even though she never got a reply, Jessie knew that Grandpa heard her prayer. He was a quiet kind of guy. Besides, he always liked to answer with actions, not words. In her arms, Dickie whimpered and pawed at her shirt again, wanting attention and love. Jess pecked the top of his furry head with a kiss and finally laid down on the bed, pulling him into a loose hug on the blanket. Papa's side of the bed was soft and smelled like candy, and it made her want to breathe slower and longer to make the sweetness linger in her nose. Huh. It was funny how Papa could comfort her even when he wasn't there...
“Screw that,” the man growled under his breath.
His son only glanced down and shook his head.
!” Gabriel shouted.
“Everyone eat and get dressed. We'll meet at the stairs in twenty minutes, okay?” Dean announced.
Cas took a second to gather his words as he played with Dean's hair. The air between them was warm and moist when the angel began to speak.
Cas instantly stepped forward to lean into Dean's hug, wrapping both arms around Dean's back as Dean did the same to his. Dean smiled fondly toward the infirmary doors as he held his angelic husband in his arms.
Again, I am really, really sorry for all of those horrible feels, you guys. :( I'm sorry for making this version of Meg so far from canon, and probably breaking your heart because of it. But at least now, Clarence can start healing. With lots of help from Jude, of course. ;) And yay! Judence is officially canon! Break out the champagne! :) Fun (background) facts: Clare's Witch moms actually knew about Meg being alive and planned to tell him about her when he was older, but died before they could do so. Also, that huge scar on his back? That happened when Meg cut him out of her stomach to 'get rid' of him. And the note she wrote actually has a scribble at the top of paper, where she scratched out Cas's name to write 'Clarence' instead... Wow, so many dark facts that make the story sadder, huh?  I'm so sorry! Lol. But I hope that you all will have mercy on my soul, and allow me to make things up to you in the last few chapters of this part. ;) Thank you so much for reading and commenting, guys! I hope you all had a great Christmas, and will have a happy new year! The next chapter will be out soon! :)
Ollie tossed the black bag to the side before talking. Underneath the Halloween makeup, his expression had turned softer.
“Yes. And in that time, I will need your compliance, Gabriel,” Naomi said back.
“Uncle Bobby's,” Jessie answered.
, and develop into a fully formed
Ollie took the time to look at his wife, noticing that she wasn't smiling like he was. If anything, it seemed like Jessica was trying her best to restrain a scowl. Maybe she was still sick, like he suspected. If that was the case, how could he cheer her up? Oliver glanced around town, seeing French signs pointing in the direction of the art museum.
Goosebumps sprang up all along Jessie's skin and she gasped out loud. What?! They were taking her to pick out a dress for the dance?! All of them together?! No way! She never thought they would do it so soon! The teenage girl quickly hopped out of her seat and reached over to wrap her short Papa into a giant hug, wanting to show her appreciation and affection.
Dean knew that if he let go of the wire, it would slice all the way through his neck like a thin blade. The person behind him was obviously trying to kill him.
The trickster's glare remained fixed on Cas for a moment before he finally raised his hand. Gabriel made a snide face toward him but eventually snapped his fingers together. Dean could immediately feel his legs being set free. He wiggled them under the table and clenched his fists. Sam's eyes flew wide, suddenly glancing between Dean and Cas with shock as he pulled himself away from Gabriel
“Blah, blah, blah, blah,” Gabe interrupted, waving a hand in aggravation, “Nobody cares about the history lesson, kid. Just tell me where Asmodeus is so I can rip his Kentucky-fried ass apart.”
But then, the doors slammed in Dean’s face and he was being yanked through a corridor full of demons. He glanced around at them all in anger, feeling the urge to retrieve the angel blade from his waistband and slaughter them all. He could feel that the blade was still there, getting jostled with each of his footsteps. But he didn’t make a move. He knew that he was highly outnumbered and would be overrun in no time. Besides, he was being taken to Cas’s quarters. That was bound to be a safe place, right? Dean was surprised that Cas had his own private place in Hell. Wait, didn’t the demons call him ‘the king’? Was
The angel was slowly edging forward, taking deliberate steps to walk a slow circle around Dean. The man swallowed harshly again, feeling like a school boy being appraised by a strict teacher. Oh God, wasn't that every man's fantasy? To be punished by a school teacher? Hmm, maybe Cas would spank him with a ruler, too. As Cas carefully rounded him, Dean stole a glance at the angel's backside. Cas's pale round cheeks were heavenly, shifting seductively against one another with each of his steps. Dean could feel the jolts of arousal shooting faster toward his own crotch just from the mere sight of Cas's bare ass. In the back of his mind, Dean made a quick mental note to thank Gabriel for the thong.
“Here ya go, Robert Singer. This belongs to you,” Rowena smiled softly, “I couldn't have chosen a better man to give my Fergus away to.”
Although Dean and Sam were trying to be as positive as possible, their angels still wore looks of hesitation. A moment of anxious silence passed by before Bobby walked back over to the group and held a page out.
Sam's question brought the archangel back to the kitchen. Gabe raised his hand to his husband, waiting to see if he could hear anymore from their daughter, but Jess never said anything else. Gabe looked to Sam and searched his big moose face.
Jude let his hand drop and hang off the bed as he laid in total bliss. The pain he had felt was gone, somehow, and the only thing he wanted to do was sleep. He could feel the smile on his own face as Jessie cooed over the baby near him and he slowly faded out. It was the deepest sleep he had ever felt. So relaxing and calm.
“Yes. I was incapable of ignoring the time,” Cas answered. “To be honest, I was glad to see that a different version of me was with you. I know myself, Dean, and there isn’t a universe that exists in which I would not love and care for you.”
“See those little notches, kid?” Gabe pointed out, “That's an Enochian spell. Arguably the most powerful spell ever created. My dad made it himself. And our grace can't break through it. The only way to open this cage is from the outside. We're pretty much stuck here, Jude.”
your gift,” he hummed.
“Yes. He appears to have full cognition,” Pop answered.
“Do you know Peter Pan?” he asked.
A swirl of excitement stirred in Castiel's chest as he glanced back to Jessica's bedroom door. He was so
“I'm sorry I couldn't afford a big diamond,” Ollie mumbled, sounding ashamed, “But this one was really pretty and I thought that you might like it. We can go back to the store and get a diff -”
“You'd make a good Batman,” the little guy whispered.
“Fine. Here, Tarzan. Go buy me something pretty,” Gabriel sighed, placing a fifty-dollar bill in Sam's hand.
“Still. It's best to lay out the guidelines,” Gabriel shrugged, “Any questions?”
“The kids?” he repeated, “No, the kids are stayin' here.”
magic princess.”
Dean knew that, for some odd reason, Cas had been keeping tabs on his dreams. Maybe the angel took a peek inside Dean's head when he was bored at night or something. But Cas's head shook slightly when the question was asked and he appeared a little apologetic.
“Uh… yeah. I guess. Why?”
its supposed to happen. You can’t speed it up, slow it down, or change it. Things will happen when and how they are meant to. That’s just how the universe works. The good news is you won’t ever have to face any of it alone.”
While everyone else chatted about the gifts, Rowena leaned forward to kiss Jessie's forehead and wrap her into a hug. Jessie hugged the tiny lady back, feeling all sorts of emotions.
. Two fetuses. Two babies.
“Where's Cas?” Sam asked, looking at his brother.
“Jess,” he breathed, “Wh – why are you glowing?”
“Yes, you,” Crowley purred pompously, “It sounded as though Meg thought highly of your righteous arse. Since the two of you used to be close, perhaps you might have seen this coming?”
?!” both of Jessica's parents gasped in offended unison.
“Dean, Castiel,” Michael said, “How long have you two been married?”
“Ollie, when you start a sentence like that, it’s gonna lead to an argument no matter what,” Jess informed as they turned a corner to get to their bedroom.
Sam felt something brush against his leg and looked down to see Jude trying to climb inside the car. The blue-eyed toddler reached up and tugged on Jessica's arm, wearing a large smile.
“That’s him,” Gabriel confirmed grimly, angrily setting his jaw, “The asshole that tortured me…”
“Perhaps we can make it a rainy day fund,” the angel said.
During the silence that followed, Clarence eventually leaned forward and started to shuffle through the room. He walked right passed Dad and Papa and headed straight for Jude. Once he realized that he was in Clarence's direct line, Jude took a cautious step back, unsure what the man was planning to do. But Clarence only paused to lean close, bringing his forest-like eyes and smirking mouth close.
Papa opened his mouth to dispute Jess's self blame, but she spoke over him again.
,” Gabe snipped.
Jessie and Ollie both looked at each other with scrunched eyebrows before shaking their heads in unison. Jude's heart deflated at the sight. Oh no, they hadn't heard from him either? Why not? Jessie reached out to pat his shoulder and gave him a reassuring look.
Jessie was standing on the steps between the study and the control room with tears in her eyes - and her pretty dress was a complete disaster. Jude's mouth fell open when he saw the terrible state of his cousin's dance attire. Oh no, what happened? Why was Jessie's rainbow dress all red? Why was she crying? Did someone hurt her? Or prank her or something? As soon as she turned to see Jude, Jessie dashed off the stairs and ran to him with a loud sob. Jude instantly welcomed her into his arms, where she clung tight to him and he tried his best to console her.
Jessica's thin arms clung to Sam's neck, bringing back memories of holding her when she was just a toddler. Sam wasn't sure if his words comforted her or not because she was quiet. Times like this were always a harsh reminder of how much Sam needed Gabriel. Gabe was so much better at comforting people than Sam was. He always knew exactly what to say. He knew how to distract people from the pain and make them smile even when they felt terrible. And as he held their weeping child, Sam wished that he could have just a fraction of Gabe's charisma to comfort her.
“You’re saying Gabriel may still be alive in my timeline,” the angel assumed.
With a bracing breath, the angel carefully reached out to take Clarence's fragile head in his hands. Castiel guided his grace within the demon's mind and began to draw out all foreign chemicals that did not belong there, as well as deplete Clarence's dependency on them. It took several seconds of unhindered concentration for Castiel's grace to take full affect, but he soon began the healing process. Thankfully, Clarence remained unconscious; blissfully unaware that his entire lifestyle was about to change. Once Castiel was sure that he had cleansed the demon as much as possible, he gently recalled his grace and let go, allowing Clarence's head to fall limp again. The demon already appeared healthier; with pinker cheeks and clearer skin.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel hummed quietly.
Her yellow hair was all messy on her head, like it was every morning. Across the table, Ollie's orange hair was messy too, but he didn't care. He just slurped up his cereal and waved. Uncle Sammy, uncle Gabe, Papa, and Daddy were all talking by the counter. Man, they were always talking about something. What was it this time?
“It's not?” Jude prompted, obviously wanting to hear more.
“Bite me,” he spat.
As she sat in the wooden chair, Jessie's eyes slowly glanced back over at her uncles. By now, uncle Dean was off the phone and kneeling in front of uncle Cas's chair. They were both hugging each other and whispering, trying to comfort each other while Jude was gone. Uncle Cas's hand was on uncle Dean's shoulder and Dean was holding it there; trying so hard to make uncle Cas feel better. Jessie blinked and their joined hands from a distance and sighed. Poor guys. They just wanted their little boy back...
“Ollie, take me,” Jess pleaded, running her hands all over her fiance's chest before reaching for the hem of her own shirt, “Please! I've gotta have you!”
Castiel nodded a bit. He could understand why Dean considered this stressful. Dealing with Gabriel took time to master. Castiel knew that from personal experience. And the angel wished he could somehow ease Dean's distress and revive the smile on his precious face. But, as long as Gabriel played mind games with Dean, it would remain a difficult task.
The air fled Gabriel's lungs in a whistling breath. Two days ago? That was the day the Winchesters traveled to Kansas City. That was the day he heard that terrible noise in his head. The screeching prayer that worried every angel in the family... Was that the sound of genocide?
When Jess, Jude, and Cas all got back from their trip to the past, they let Dean have a look at the ritual spell that grandpa John gave them. Of course, they didn't tell Dean where it really came from; just that they found the book among some of Bobby's old stuff in the garage. He was very impressed and relieved that they finally had a way to catch the guy responsible for hurting Crowley. Dean gathered Cas, Jude, and Jessica's parents into the kitchen and explained that the ritual spell should probably be done at the bunker, so that Caldwell would be trapped far away from Crowley and Clarence. Jessica could tell that Jude wanted to get back to the bunker because he knew he wouldn't be able to keep a secret from his fiance. And while Jessica really wanted to join and help them, she felt a dutiful urge to stay with uncle Crowley. After all, it was her fault that he was hurt in the first place...
“Yes,” he nodded.
"Finding my mom," he replied, spinning around in slow circles to search every table, "I heard you guys were the best hunters in the world, so I figured you could find her the quickest... Where's all the candy?"
“Oh, nothing,” Lucifer shrugged, “It's just, you're leaving the fate of the universe in the hands of these toddlers. It's adorably pathetic, even for you.”
“What the bloody hell is going on here?” Crowley asked, “Did you idiots kill Death
“Oh, shit. Hell? We can't even hear prayers from there,” Papa gasped, turning white as his golden eyes flickered to the demon on the couch, “Uh, Crowley? You got an extra magic door somewhere?”
“Jane, darling, how about you?” Rowena called from across the nest, as she delicately painted Clare's nails black, “What is your dream man like?”
“What?” she asked in disbelief.
Everything was silent afterward, except for a few drips of water on the floor and Jessica's tiny giggle. The event must have been funny to her because she was laughing so hard that her cheeks were turning pink. Jude, on the other hand, looked paler than fresh snow. He was staring at the huge mess he made with an open mouth and large eyes, as if he couldn't believe he had done it. Sam was pretty shocked, too. How in the world did Jude do that?!
“Oliver's right, the warlock might be tough to take down because he's got magic,” Jessica recalled, her eyes quizzical as she thought, “If we had a way to distract him, it would make it easier for us to get close enough to strike. Clare, does he have a weakness?”
“What the hell,” Gabriel breathed, “Why can't I get in?!”
“No, it's okay,” Jude interrupted, “I – I'll be okay. I just -”
“Thanks a lot, asshole,” Dean spat.
“... I'm dropping out of college.”
Genuine surprise flashed across Dean's face. Superman? Really? Dean wasn't expecting to hear that answer. He honestly thought that Jude was going to say Batman, because whenever they talked about superheroes, Batman always came up. Plus, Jude tended to choose things that Dean liked because they were so similar. But Superman? Superman was a total nerd compared to Batman...
“Has anyone ever told you how much you look like Cas when you wear this?” Clare asked, wiggling the blue tie around, “Honestly, the two of you could be twins.”
“I won't,” God promised.
“Gabriel,” an icy British voice murmured from the doorway, “God has made many things, but you are perhaps his most annoying, ill mannered, childish creation. If at all possible, I would like you to refrain from attempting anymore jokes for the duration of this meeting. Otherwise, you should not speak at all. Are we clear?”
“So? What did the old vampire bat have to say?” the archangel asked, seeming eager.
“N – no,” he panted, tugging on Cas's collar with both hands, “Cas, you – you know what I want.”
“Y – yeah?” Dean said, slightly hypnotized by watching Cas run his hand up and down the glistening metal erection, “Just do it already, dammit.”
“Ah, Dean, I’ve missed you so desperately,” Cas whimpered into Dean’s ear, nibbling a little on his earlobe. “
“The house? Really?” he replied.
“What is this? Some kind of spell?” Dean asked, raising an eyebrow.
Jessica was about to ask why they couldn’t drive, but remembered that the keys were probably somewhere with the rest of Dean’s possessions. With a heart that sat like a heavy rock in her chest, Jessica slunk forward and put her hands back on the cold hood of the car. It was nice to see Cas’s hands rest near hers. His glowed blueish-white and hers turned gold as they thought of Jude’s house only a few miles away, and took their family away from what was left of their home.
“You'd best not be expectin' me to sit next to this yammerin' idjit fer eleven hours,” he warned gruffly, eyes narrowing, “I ain't puttin' up with his smart-ass-ness and the stench of his girly perfume fer that long, dammit.”
“Let me back in there!” Sam growled, already trying to fight his way to the door.
Jude had a crush on
Dean patted Castiel's back in return, though he seemed a little bewildered.
“Cassie,” Gabe sighed, reaching over to pat his brother's shoulder, “For tonight only, you are a lovely, curvy, sexy lady. Understand?”
” Jude shouted.
being called that. Judy was a girl's name.
“Papa will be back soon,” Gabriel promised as he casually pecked Sam's lips with his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
After buckling the kids into their car seats, Clare took the liberty of driving Jude’s Impala to the bunker. Jude didn’t mind. Clare was a pretty good driver, plus riding shotgun gave Jude free reign of the radio. He turned on some tunes – the Beatles, ‘Dear Prudence’ to be exact – and listened to the kids chatter quietly in the backseat.
After watching Charlie eat her smash cake – which amused Clare to no end and made him excited for the day he would get to watch his own kids get covered in cake – Jess cleaned up the baby and put her to sleep. It was about that time that Dean asked the family to all sit down in the study so they could talk. As everyone gathered around to take their seats, Clare noticed Jude’s handsome freckled face steadily growing more and more red. By the time Dean and Cas stood up to address the crowd, Jude nestled his scarlet face into the side of Clare’s shoulder, hiding it from all the staring eyes. Clare sat up a little straighter, giving his nervous husband more room to hide.
“Oh, aye. And the hearts of all the men who've adored me. Would you like to add to my collection, love? Got a golden jar all picked out for you,” Rowena grinned, tossing Gabriel a wink.
"Holy Mars bars," Papa interrupted, waving a hand and shaking his head, "You sound
“You're so cute when you're worried,” the archangel mumbled into Sam's wet mouth, “I knew I married you for a reason...”
“Yeah,” Dean answered, “Now, can we get back to dinner?”
With a defeated sigh, Clare uncorked the bottle and drank all the contents in one go. From the moment it touched his tongue, Clare felt loads better. He could feel his own demonic aura coming back in waves, covering him in the protective casing he was born with. A few moments later, it felt like he was totally back to normal. He flashed his own eyes black to test it, looking around the kitchen with his enhanced vision before blinking them back to their chestnut shades.
A few 'Ooooh's and 'Aaaah's came from the group, but Jessie quickly went about pulling out the rest of the objects from inside Rowena's big bag. A pair of fuzzy black handcuffs, a bit of rope, and a couple of blindfolds came out next, all of which made Jessica's face turn more and more red. These things were literally used to torture people! How could any of this be used for fun? Jessica could never imagine doing anything to actually hurt Ollie, especially not in the bedroom! Everyone else seemed to find the naughty gifts amusing, because Gabe, Clare, and Jane all giggled with each thing presented. Uncle Cas, on the other hand...
“Angry,” Clare breathed, remembering how badly it hurt, “Rejected... Unwanted... Pissed as hell...”
"So, which one of these do you like the most, Jessie-rabbit?" Papa asked again, golden eyes on the screen as he led the way inside, "You want your hair up? Down? Side-ways? Long curls? With braids?In a mohawk? A mullet?"
Though she didn't look up, Gabe could tell that his ten-year-old daughter was relaxing. The archangel shared a soft smile with his handsome husband over the seat as the car's engine started up again.
A fresh wave of awe and
“Raph!
Dean's eyebrows furrowed. Kissing? Wait, did Cas seriously think that Jude and Clare were only going to make-out tonight? Dean lifted his head to properly look at Cas's face, seeing the somberness and innocence in his eyes. Oh, God. It was true. Cas had no idea that those boys were probably banging each other senseless right about now... The angel blinked back at the hunter in confusion.
“Then ask Jess,” Sam suggested.
“I guess,” Dean grumbled, though his fat lip slurred some of it.
When she started down the hall, Oliver followed her with their baby, keeping his voice low as he began to talk.
Oliver nodded again and reached underwater to find Jess's hands. His warm fingers found her pruned fingers and clamped them comfortingly.
Cas swallowed and looked to the crowd before raising his bloodstained hands.
“Yeah!” Jess rejoiced.
Meg paused to swallow harshly.
Although his brother's tone was light and comforting, the words didn't make Dean feel any better. The older Winchester slammed the trunk closed and turned to look up at Sammy, who was standing in the motel parking lot with him. Dean wished that he could explain how he was feeling – how absolutely disgusted he was with himself for murdering two people in front of his small child – but he couldn't possibly put the sheer magnitude of horribleness into a statement.
“By the holiness of heaven... It looks just like the Winchester... And its grace outshines even that of Michael...” the lady mumbled, “Castiel's offspring stands before my very eyes! We – we actually captured it! But where is Gabriel's? And where is Hester?”
Dickie sat down next to Cas on the floor to watch him with curious eyes. Once he had the angel blade in his hand, Castiel paused to look down at the top of his own glowing stomach. Fear and anxiety were inching their way back into his heart, reminding him that he could very well end up killing both himself and his unborn child if he did not do this correctly. One small slip and they would both be dead. Feeling a new stir of emotion, Castiel briefly looked up toward the ceiling, pining for courage and clarity.
“C – Cas,” Dean nearly moaned, his voice echoing in the angel's open mouth, “Oh,
Just a warning there are very sad parts in this chapter. I apologize ahead of time for any tears that may be spilled. If you are like me and you have a sensitive heart, it might be better to wait for next week’s happier chapter to give you comfort after reading this. But if you are brave enough to withstand the sadness, full steam ahead. :) Thank you so much for reading!
“Come on,” Sam said, taking Gabe's arm and carting him forward as the archangel worked, “We're gonna start with the plane from Indiana.”
Thinking about Daddy and Papa made Jude remember what they told him the night before they left to go to the zoo. '
. And seeing you helped me keep fighting... God, I'm starting to sound like your parents...”
“You know Papa and I are always gonna be there for you too, right?” Dean wanted to confirm.
Ollie sighed and nodded, appearing defeated, even though he was still smiling.
, the man tried to remind himself as he followed everyone inside,
“Not a wizard. A
While Jess unwrapped the candy and chowed down, Sam stole a glance at her stomach. It was pretty round by now, still housing that familiar golden glow even under the fabric of her clothing. The sight brought back memories of Gabriel's pregnancy so many years before. Gabe had been so short and round and yellow; like a golden egg. Jessica seemed to carry the pregnancy look a little differently, probably because of the height she got from Sam. Still, it was strange to think that his little girl was carrying
Once the boys were quiet, Sam and Gabe turned their attention to Dean and Cas, who were both studying their new video camera like it was a foreign object.
“Okay,” he agreed out loud, “but I've got dibs on the fishnets and feather boas.”
A small silence occupied the room, in which Sam took a sip of coffee and shook his head. On the opposite side of the table, Crowley drummed his fingers on the wood and glared toward the wall across the kitchen.
After a bracing breath, Sam eventually turned to look at his daughter again. Jessica was resting Indian-style on her bed now, with her hands in her lap and her eyes wide. She was blinking at him, but her expression seemed torn. Sam knew just from looking at her that she was still a little hesitant to forgive him. As he stared at his daughter, Sam realized that he needed to do more than just say a verbal apology. He had to
Pain seeped into Caldwell's face and he nodded slowly. A few extra moments of silence followed, in which he tilted his head toward a far wall and stared at it lovingly.
Cas's eyes were flickering between the jar of honey and Dean's face and his mouth opened to speak – but he was interrupted by a loud scratching sound. Everyone in the living room turned to look toward the front door where the noise was coming from. It was a tiny little scraping sound echoing from the bottom of the door, like nails were being dragged along the wood.
“A grandfather, Cas. I'm going to be a grandfather,” Gabriel fully explained, “And guess what? It's a
“Is there a way I could fix it?” she asked, looking back to Clare “Kid, if I gave birth to you, I want to remember it -”
“Why are you so against it, Clare?” he gently pressed, caressing Clare's hips to comfort him, “I mean, I... I think we would both really enjoy -”
“Me?” Papa repeated.
“Ollie,” she whispered, “It's a real unicorn!”
“If he wants to marry Crowley, why won't he just do it?” Dean asked quietly.
for some reason; eyes large, eyebrows curved, cheeks white, bottom lip trembling. Jude was clinging to the top of the comforter with a death grip, as if it was a shield. And the sight made Dean's parental panic shoot through the roof.
Jessie's arms shifted from Jude to uncle Gabe, jumping up to cling to his neck and hold him tight. They both breathed how much they missed each other while they spun around in circles. In the meantime, Jude caught sight of uncle Sammy running across the field. When Gabe sat Jessie back on the ground, uncle Sam tackled him; grabbing him with so much force that they almost fell over.
“Meg?” Cas began.
The old gentleman nodded, still looking from man to man.
Still, the nephilim remained.
Metatron used the angel blade in his hand to point toward all of the blood on the floor around Castiel. Cas, too, glanced down at the mess that surrounded him, seeing red liquid in all directions. Blood was still pouring from the incision in the angel's abdomen, pulsing out almost as fast as his heart was beating. Castiel cringed in despair as his eyes traveled down to the infant in his possession. If left unhealed, Castiel would run out of blood completely. His eyes would close on their own and would never reopen again...
The baby fell asleep just as she finally made it into Oliver's mother's arms. Ollie beamed with pride as he watched his mom cuddle and kiss Charlie. Of course, his mom was crying and smiling the whole time. Along with everyone else.
That comment made Jude gulp and blush. Lots of girls? Oh boy, girls made him nervous. He liked looking at them, of course - especially on Halloween, when they were all dressed up - but talking to them was a different story. Plus, Ollie had three really pretty cousins who were supposed to be coming to the party. What if one of them told him he looked cute? Or worse, what if they told him he looked stupid?
“I know it's really early,” Jane continued, gently rubbing her thumb over her child's hand, “but I have to be at the store in twenty minutes and I won't get off until late tonight. And Oliver really wanted to come over and -”
“Eh. What can I say. I'm a glutton for punishment,” Lucifer shrugged, “Besides, all the good vacation spots are pretty much mulched right now anyway, so... I figured if I was going to die, might as well be with you guys, right?”
“Dean and Cas are having a boy,” Sam answered Bobby's question first.
it. The icy cold metal head touching his heated hole made him flinch forward.
“Can we go find Ollie?” Jessica asked, fidgeting with the hem of her purple shirt.
a demon? Was Bobby seriously in a relationship with the king of hell?! No, that couldn't be right...
Ollie's sentence stopped short when he turned to see Jessica scarfing down the cinnamon roll with her bare hands. The eager churning sensation in her stomach had propelled her to attack it and start eating, like a lioness on a gazelle. And once the sweet icing hit her tongue, Jess felt like she was having a sudden orgasm.
“Just try. Please? I – I want to go home,” Ollie said, his brown eyes all watery.
"What are you doing here?" Jess practically demanded.
Before Castiel could ask his brother what they needed to discuss, Gabriel flew them to a more private area. They both appeared just outside of Bobby's house between two stacks of mangled cars. The inertia of the short flight actually caused a flicker of nausea to echo from Castiel's stomach. The baby wiggled around inside his grace too, making it clear that he did not appreciate being flown around. Cas briefly clutched the side of his own stomach as he looked back up to meet Gabriel's eyes.
“Yeah,” Dean smiled, pointing toward the far wall. “There’s a big switch over there that should turn all the power on.”
“That does sound really nice,” Dean admitted, feeling his own smile carefully slipping away the longer he stared at the red paint on the house, “... But he's gonna have to learn how to handle a gun. He needs to know how to defend himself from demons and angels and all those other creatures, Sam. He's still going to have to be a
“I don't have a house,” Dean breathed, hearing his own voice crack, “He won't have a
“It... It sure sounds like you want to,” Dean pointed out.
Dean swallowed hard in the silence as he eyed the eroded metal bars. It was like looking at an old war monument; something from a distant time that held too much horror to be forgotten. Cas exhaled audibly and turned around to uncuff Dean’s wrists. Dean watched him do it, holding still even though he was confused.
Clarence's voice faded out as he ran down the hall, leaving all the adults in the kitchen to stand around with smiles. But Jude wasn't smiling. In fact, he was on the verge of tears. Uncle Bobby's house was so far away! Jude would almost never get to see Clarence! Why couldn't he just stay in the bunker?
. With a tiny sniffle, Jess walked into her Dad's arms, burying herself into the safety of his giant embrace. Dad hugged her back and kissed the top of her head, and she could feel Papa's shorter arms wrap around her back too. Dickie's bark eventually broke them up. It was his 'I want to be included' bark. Papa knelt down and picked up the little dog to give him a few pats.
Though Gabe knew that it would be best to change the poor kid's memory and let him be a normal little boy for what little time he could, the archangel just couldn't do it. Oliver just watched Gabriel perform magic on his parents and never batted an eye. He wasn't afraid of the angels, like those kids at the playground were when they saw Jessica fly. Oliver may have only been five-years-old, but he still accepted the Winchesters for
Jude felt Clare's lips briefly return to his own.
“My knees are weak already,” he grinned.
A figure stepped out from the end of the hall and Jude gasped. From the tall, feminine silhouette alone, Jude could tell that it was his cousin. Jessie stepped down the hall to meet him with a calm expression.
“This is actually a pretty good idea, Gabe,” Sam mentioned as he shuffled through the papers in his hands, “Jess is going to -”
“Okay, uh... Listen, Cas,” Dean said, gently raking his fingers through Castiel's hair, “You just sit right here and relax, okay? I'll go get some food and come back to you. Alright?” Dean paused briefly to peck a kiss to Castiel's forehead before standing up, “C'mon, Sammy. Gabriel, you stay here with him. Don't leave him alone. I mean it.”
is one of them.”
Crowley took a small step back, easing behind Bobby.
too good to be true? Cas must have been able to sense Dean's unspoken worry, because the angel's eyes softened and he held his hand out.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. Of course his old man would put a gag order on his fortune-seeing daughter. Knowing the future must have been strictly forbidden or something. Go figure. Still, Sam nodded and patted Jess's shoulder comfortingly.
“Jude,” Clare said softly, turning to face him, “I want to do something. It'll probably seem weird, but would you humor me for a second?”
Castiel cringed at Dean's gory depiction, but turned to stare at Death. The dark figure paused to take a large breath and deliberate on Dean's requests. Castiel was very fearful that this plan was on the verge of falling through. Surely Death could see that they were trying to take his scythe from him, couldn't he? Was he merely toying with them at this point? Sam's whimpering was a constant background noise, and it filled Castiel with heartache and dread as he waited for Death's response.
Since Papa already knew she was awake, Jessica wiggled her arms out from under her blanket and gave a shrug.
Dean was momentarily unable to function. Did... did that little asshole just call him 'grandpa'? To his face? Dean quickly snapped out of his shock and could feel anger taking its place. He stood up straight and narrowed his eyes, blocking the view of the bunker with his body. He was tempted to slam the door and walk away, but something told him this kid would just keep knocking until he came back. So why was he even here in the first place?
The ghoul slowly smiled, backing slowly away from the bar with a giggle. Her sight was solely fixed on Oliver now, which gave his dad time to hunker back down behind the bar. Oliver was glad the ghoul was staring at him, though. He knew how to handle this situation far better than his dad did. The ghoul gestured to the empty room around them with a devilish grin.
Clarence gulped, feeling slightly proud. It was nice to hear the determination in Jess's voice. She was usually too emotional when it came to confronting things head on, but her love for Crowley must have changed that...
“Souls? No... I'll just make a deal with management,” Crowley corrected.
Dean wanted to make sure he could fit inside Cas without hurting him before actually trying it. He pecked the angel's neck and shoulder with kisses while he continued to prod the tight hole open, wanting to keep Cas satisfied until he could work his way in. Once he thought that Cas seemed loose enough, Dean carefully guided his cock toward the entrance. He had to add a few more globs of spit and give it a good push, but his dick eventually fit inside, causing Cas to cry out in the meantime.
“It's alright, Dean. I understand,” Cas hummed.
“You can go play again, son,” he offered in the kindest voice possible.
“Please, brother,” Cas continued, “Tell me how I can satisfy Dean's lust for dominance without hurting him. My actions caused him physical pain today. And I do not wish to harm him - ”
A hand pulled Dean from his nightmare like a hook reeling a fish up from the depths of deep water. The man gasped for breath and clawed himself awake, forcing his eyes open and bolting to sit up. The hotel room was full of natural sunlight glowing warmly against the white walls and the fluffy bed. Dean's eyes instantly snapped toward the ceiling, where the morning sun rays were stretching across the flat surface. What happened to the fire? Where did Cas go? Was the angel still crying? Was he still
Ollie stamped a kiss to the side of Jess's head before waving and scurrying off to regather his very confused family members. With her fiance gone, Jess turned to her parents, who both looked equally flustered.
"Excellent choices, Jane," Aunt Rowena complimented, reaching out to pick up a particular dress, "This one looks similar to something I wore on my date with James Dean. Terribly handsome fellow, he was. But his walnuts didn't hang far from the tree, if you know what I mean."
“You did?” he gently prodded.
Dad nodded and took another breath.
The first thing Gabe did when he knelt down next to Jane and her husband was reach out to check their pulses. Castiel was right. They were both still alive, just under some heavy celestial anesthetic. At first, Gabe wondered why the angels put Jane and Eddie asleep instead of killing them, because it was totally unlike Hester – one of heaven's most lethal soldiers – to leave survivors carelessly thrown about. But then he realized that she must have needed them for something. Curious to know what, Gabriel touched Jane's forehead to see some of her recent memories... and found that the last thing she thought about was the giant white house that Gabriel cloaked the bunker with.
Unfortunately, the idea upset Clare more than Jude thought it would. The demon huffed a breath of aggravation and crunched the wrapped condom in his hand, lowering his head and shaking it toward the wall.
"I know everything, lamb. One of the perks of being a mother," she said, batting her eyelashes for added effect before turning her attention back to Jess, "and speaking of mother time, I hope you're ready to go, lass."
Gabriel smirked a little around Sam's dick, glad to hear that the kid was enjoying himself. The archangel sucked even harder and eventually reached down in his pants to fondle his balls too. He could hear Sam crunching on popcorn above him, mixed with the loud movie playing behind him. Sam rocked his hips with Gabe's mouth, obviously trying to get to an orgasm. Wanting to help the kid along, Gabe used some of his grace to kickstart the pleasure, sending pulses to Sam's brain that made him groan out loud.
“Yeah. Like Will Smith in Men in Black. He flashes people to get rid of memories,” he explained.
“Wisdom. Got it,” Clare nodded.
“Yeah. I do,” Dean nodded.
Gabriel made a face and shrugged his shoulders with a nod. The archangel had plopped himself on the end of their bed, still wearing one of Sam's shirts from the night before. Sam, however, was standing near the dresser and putting on a suit as they talked. The man couldn't believe that God had showed up at the Winchester's doorstep again without him knowing it. Why was Sam always preoccupied when God decided to swing by and talk to his family?
.” His deep voice cracked. “Please forgive me for not getting to you in time.”
“Ollie?” she called out, “Dad?”
“The raindrops,” Jude said quietly, “They’re getting… slower.”
The lady yanked them both down a different hall, walking so fast that Jude's feet could barely keep up. Ollie got close to Jude's ear to whisper so that the lady couldn't hear him.
“What's going on with you, man?” Dean hissed, “You bring your demonic boyfriend and his mother here to cast spells and then ask for booze? What the hell, Bobby?”
“Let's start with where the hell you've been,” Gabriel spat.
“Ah, yes, indeed,” Crowley smiled and winked, playing along with the joke.
“Whoa,” Dean breathed, “Check out that Dodge Charger, Cas.”
made,” Dad huffed, “and somehow ended up explaining the family business to the kids. They asked about Dad and I thought I'd show them his journal. Just for a second.”
“You think he got this from me? You think this is my fault?” Dean breathed.
“… Stuffed-crust pizza,” he eventually answered, “and watermelon… and chocolate milk.”
Though his back was turned to her, Jessica knew it was the devil. It was Lucifer in his human form; some guy that looked kind of like Dean from the back, but wasn’t built the same way. He was standing there, facing the other direction. But when the bedroom door softly snapped shut at Jessica’s side, he slowly turned around – revealing the baby in his arms. Jessica’s heart leaped into her throat at the sight of her own child in the arms of the devil. Charlie was fast asleep, curled to the side and wrapped in her pink and yellow blanket. And Lucifer was grinning down at her, using the back of his finger to gently stroke her strawberry blonde hair. The sight turned Jess’s stomach sour in an instant and made the blood drain from her face. Her first instinct was to fly across the room and snatch the baby from Satan’s grasp, but his red glowing eyes flashed up and he raised his finger to his own lips.
Even after everyone had gone to bed and the clock was ticking closer and closer to midnight, Dean still couldn't make himself fall asleep. Cas was still snoozing next to him, shifting lazily every so often and breathing in and out gently. Dean watched the angel sleep for the longest time, hoping it would make himself feel tired. But sleep never came. His mind was too busy worrying about everything else to relax. Over and over, all he could think about was Cas and the baby. What if those angels actually got to his family? What if that Meta-asshole succeeded? What if he
“What?” Castiel asked, wondering why Dean appeared so amazed.
heart. The old man gulped and shared a small glance with his own newly wed husband, who smiled softly in return. Under the arch, Gabriel wiped his own eyes and the sight of him crying must have triggered Sam, because the tall kid stepped closer to cup Gabe's face.
to you molesting their brother was one thing, but to make them
"My baby girl is going to her first dance ever!" Papa sang to everyone in the store, "And she's gonna be the prettiest angel there!"
Papa's arms snaked around Jude's back like a warm blanket.
“That tiny cage of horrors you were trapped in is nothing compared to what I will do to you if you ever threaten Jude's life again,” the demon stated calmly.
“Okay, kiddos, here are the rules,” Gabriel began, walking backwards so that he could look at Jude and Jess, “No kicking, no pinching, no biting, no pushing, no shoving, no name-calling, and absolutely no crying of any kind.”
Dad was already wearing a comforting expression, as if he knew that Jude was going to be upset.
“Oh, and could you do me a favor?” Dean requested, feeling his own smile grow, “When you pick him up, could you tell him that Dean Winchester sent you?”
Uncle Bobby's old wooden house greeted him. Jude was standing a few feet away from the back porch, where a breeze was blowing through the brightly lit salvage yard and ruffling his spiked hair. Distant voices drifted to Jude's ears, causing him to turn in their direction. A couple yards away, near the entrance of one of the garages, Bobby was leaning under the roof of a car – next to a slender blonde demon who looked absolutely stunning in the sunlight. Jude quickly made his way over to them, excited to greet his uncle and fiancé.
“Take them to the throne room,” he ordered.
“You – you killed her!” his dad pointed out.
He held up Gabe’s left hand between them, revealing the matching golden band on Gabe’s own finger. Holy shit! Gabe was
“Easy there, big guy,” Gabriel hummed back, “I've got you.”
“You've got me,” Jude pointed out, hanging on to Clare's tense arms as they moved in the bed.
Jessica blinked a few times, letting her mind catch up with her ears. Ferris Wheel? There was a Ferris Wheel here? Ollie probably noticed her confusion because he shifted his new stuffed unicorn into one hand to point beside them. Jessica turned to see the giant metal wheel a few yards away and her jaw slowly fell open. The Ferris Wheel. Ollie's red shirt. His stubbly cheeks and perfect eyes – she finally remembered.
“How long do you think we'll be happy?” Gabe prompted.
“Er, yeah, thanks,” Daddy coughed, lunging forward to take the black caldron and stuff it under the table, “Can we have the next present now, Dean?”
Across the table, Ms. Jane waved and nodded next to uncle Cassie. Jessie couldn't believe it! They were all going to go on a fun trip together to see animals! Monkeys and pandas and elephants and tigers! Jessie couldn't wait to go! That sounded like the best gift ever! The little girl lunged forward to give her Papa a ginormous hug, holding him so tight that she could feel their graces touching. She loved her Papa so much! He was the best, most amazing Papa ever!
But unfortunately, the route to the garage led right passed Jude's room and Dean's feet stopped dead in their tracks.
“I love you as well, Dean,” he assured, though he still looked worried. “Are you alright?”
The cold water that blasted from the shower head splashed Dean’s face and made him suck in a breath. He quickly turned the handle closer to hot and carefully eased into the heavy stream, closing his eyes to feel the liquid running down his bare skin. The only sound in the room was the echoing water jutting from the pipe, hitting Dean’s body, and running down the drain. The room was calm, almost relaxing, but it didn’t help Dean’s aching insides.
“Y – yeah,” she answered, even though it was probably a lie, “I just... didn't sleep well.”
“Yeah!” Jude smiled.
"No," Dean replied, talking low enough that only Bobby could hear him, "I overlook a lot of his bullshit, now. The, uh, the kid has actually had a pretty rough go, Bobby. The other day, he... he told us a little bit about his childhood. If you could even call it a childhood. Said he did anything he had to do to stay alive when he was young... He probably had to steal a lot... even prostitute himself... Poor kid..."
Jessie narrowed her eyes at the dark ceiling. What? No he wasn't! He wasn't anywhere near her! With a bit of grace, Jessica lit up her hand with golden light so that she could see what was going on – and found Oliver standing by the bed, holding her jeans to his waist. Jess's red-haired boyfriend was having relations with her pants!
Clarence seemed really happy that Jessica had chosen to sit with him, because he straightened up in his chair and made eye-contact with her.
A hint of panic flashed in Clare's chest. Go? Where was Meg going? Though he knew he probably should have remained stealthy to hear the answer, Clare finally ventured the rest of the way down the hall and rounded the corner. Straight ahead, lingering near the end of the corridor, Meg and Cas were facing each other. When Clare approached, their concerned faces brightened with smiles.
“Wh – what's happening?” Jessie breathed, clinging to Dickie and Ollie's arm.
“So we just sit here and do
“It wasn't fair,” she stated, shaking her head again, “What I did to you, what you had to go through. It wasn't fair. There are so many things I should have done differently. The problem is, I didn't realize it at the time. People say hindsight is twenty-twenty, and they're right. If I could go back and change it, I would do it in a heartbeat. You're – you're such a good kid,” she hummed, turning to look up at him with a watery-eyed smile, “and you deserve so much more than what you had to live through.”
“He called Cas a 'pretty city boy,'” Gabriel answered, “But don't worry, Pinky, I made him pay for it. Literally. I didn't pay for our rooms, so he's gonna lose a shit-ton of profit. Not to mention the toupee thing. That's what he gets for being an asshole.”
“Robert, I do believe Mother has officially gone overboard,” he sighed.
“Great job, Jess,” uncle Dean said as he carefully pulled the cake away, “We're gonna open presents before we eat cake, okay?”
“Are you Michael?” he asked, his tone a little less friendly than Jude was hoping for.
"Good! Because there's a farm just outside town that's having this Harvest Festival thing tomorrow, with a corn maze and stuff, and I was thinking maybe we could go together. Like, not 'together' together. But like as friends. Just, um, whatever she wants to do. You know?"
?!” Jessie cried out, sounding so scared.
Oliver’s smile dimmed a little but he shrugged, making his red hair feather to one side.
“Take… it…” she wheezed, vocal cords visibly straining, “Keep it… away from… Lucifer…”
Sam gulped and swiveled his head around to look at his brother, knowing that threat would turn him into a tornado of rage and fury. But Dean only glared at the kid in front of him, seeming too shocked to even say a word. Clarence's smirk widened as he shuffled up to the group at the door.
“Damn right,” he mumbled in the manliest voice he could muster.
There was a small silence in which Jude took the final turn onto the road that led to the bunker and Oliver giggled shrilly in delight.
“And the reason the warlock is still alive is because Death resurrects him every time he dies. Some kind of stupid deal they made about killing demons. He and Death are total Frat bros or something,” Gabe sighed.
“We hold hands,” he answered.
“Yes. We arrived in this world less than an hour ago,” Cas nodded.
Michael bowed his head and smiled back before wrapping both arms around Adam and flying away. Both of them disappeared with a rustle of wings and a slight draft, leaving everyone else standing in the same room that another miracle was performed in. Again, no one seemed to know what to say. Until Lucifer swaggered forward that is.
! Seems like only yesterday that she was running around in diapers, and now she's mercilessly slaughtering evildoers. They grow up so fast...”
“Hey, it's alright, little man,” Gabriel soothed, purposefully using Dean's nickname to comfort him, “Your uncle Gabe is going to keep you safe until our family comes to get us. I bet your dads and uncle Sam are working on it right now. They'll be here in no time, ready to tackle you with hugs and kisses.”
are what's best for me.”
At the moment, it seemed like the only thing Charlie was excited for was being taken out of her crib. She grinned and jumped, grasping with her tiny hands. Jessica obliged, scooping her one-year-old up into her arms and planting her on her hip. Charlie clung to Jess’s shirt, laying her head on her momma’s shoulder as if it was too heavy for her to hold up on her own. And with that weighty helmet of hair, Jess couldn’t blame her.
“There he is,” he said, gesturing to the small group of guys on the corner of the building, “Will you, um, will you guys walk with me? I don't really want to go alone.”
Jude could practically hear his heartbeat in his own ears. He knew what his dad was getting at. Was it fair of them to kill Clarence's father like that? Without even telling him about it? Jude couldn't be a part of that! Dad must have seen the anguish in Jude's eyes because he rested a hand on his shoulder.
Sam smiled. Jess may have gotten Gabe's pretty looks, but she definitely took after Sam when it came to choosing food.
While Dean was busy daydreaming about all kinds of sexy possibilities, one of the demons came running for him. He barely saw the thing before it blasted him off his feet and onto his back. He landed hard and sucked in a breath just in time to see it bringing down a blade – but, luckily, one of the Cas’s was standing close enough to burn the demon with his grace. He quickly tossed the demon away before bringing his frantic attention to the man on the floor.
"C'mon, Sammy," he said, tugging him forward, "I'll get you some coffee."
After hearing Dean beg, all of Cas's fingers suddenly left Dean's hole. The man could feel the huge difference it made. It practically left him gaping open. Dean turned his head to watch Cas sit down next to him on the bed. The chrome dildo was in his hands and he was lubing it up, completely covering it from tip to base with glistening fluid. Dean gulped again, seeing how shiny and beautiful it was. There was no way he would be able to take the entire thing. Cas knew that, right?
“Thanks, Daddy,” Jess replied.
“No,” Cas denied, “Gabriel, Dean's necklace is glowing. That means our father is -”
. Jude smiled at the bottom of the door, where he could see Clare's shadow on the floor.
Jude's feet drew to a dead stop in the middle of the room and wouldn't go any further. The lady holding onto his shoulder suddenly stopped, turned around to give him a mean glare, and tried yanking him forward again. But he didn't move. Jude just held Ollie's hand tight and closed his eyes, remembering the first words he ever heard his Daddy say.
Sam's fearful eyes flickered between Dean and Cas and a sense of understanding filled his eyes.
With the manners of a true gentleman, Ollie led Jess across the road to the entrance of the festival, where he paid for their tickets and let her choose the first activity to do. Jessica suggested that they should try to tackle the corn maze, since there was no knowing how long it would take them. Ollie agreed and took her to the maze entrance on the other side of the festival. They passed lots of carnival games, rides, hotdog stands, and cotton candy machines along the way, and each one made Jessie's smile grow brighter. Wow, this was even better than the dance! Everyone was having such a good time; laughing and smiling and eating and playing. Maybe her family needed to come back here before the harvest season was over.
“Later,” Sam agreed, “If she's brave enough to show her face again.”
“Seriously? You're inviting the Pope?” he asked flatly, “Why?”
To make himself feel better, Dean rolled up his sleeve and fiddled with the coat strap on his forearm. Looking at the familiar shade of tan brought back so many good memories of being alone with Cas; sharing time with him, talking to him, smiling, laughing, kissing, holding him… Dean eventually laid his head down on it and silently prayed that his family would be alright.
“Whoa, shhh,” Sam consoled, brushing Jess's blonde hair back to wipe her face, “It's okay, baby Rabbit. Did you have a bad dream? Who was trying to take you away?”
!” Gabriel finally snapped.
Crowley and Bobby both rolled their eyes at Rowena's dramatic statement. Jessica's parents, however, felt the urge to intervene.
And speaking of amazing readers,
When they made it to the kitchen, Cas swiftly let go of Dean’s hand to gesture to the wide space. The table, chairs, sink, stove, fridge, cabinets, and counters were all back to their original states. Dean’s favorite place in the world was exactly the way he left it; homey and warm, just like he remembered.
The instant Cas touched him, Dean whipped around. His large hands took fist-fulls of the front of the angel's clothes and he lunged forward, marching Castiel backward until his back slammed hard against the wall. Castiel gasped at Dean's forcefulness, stunned that the man would handle him in such a hateful way. Had Castiel angered him, too? Was the angel suddenly the target for the man's powerful rage?
,” he barked over the music, “What the hell did you do to my girlfriend?!”
Jessica looked up in wonder to see Papa barreling toward her. His arms were open and his shaggy golden hair was tossing around in the wind when he ran up to scoop Jess into a big hug. A squealing giggle left Jessie's smiling mouth when she felt Papa lift her up. Dickie wiggled frantically between them like he was confused and excited all at once.
“That includes Clarence. Especially Clarence,” Papa answered, his eyes filling with guilt as he glanced between the two of them, “I’m sorry, son… but your grace is simply too overwhelming. It would harm Clarence in a matter of seconds.”
“What say you, Cherub?” she softly prompted, “Are ya comfortable with lettin' this lass stay long enough to learn the truth?”
I'm pretty sure Sam and Gabriel will always fight over who Jessica's good looks came from. ;) I'm sorry if I spoiled the end of The Velveteen Rabbit for you. I just wanted Sam to comfort Jess with a good bunny story before bed. :) Oh, and if you guys caught all the tiny call backs to my previous Sabriel stories in this chapter – mentions of peaches, Butterfingers, etc – I will award you 50 house points! Great job, finding all the Easter eggs! :D Before you ask, no. There is nothing suspicious about the Thompsons. They are a normal little family unit. Its okay to trust them. Lol. :) Ollie is basically Jude and Jessica's best friend and we'll get to see more of him soon. :) By the way, the name 'Thompson' is an Easter egg from one of my old Sabriel stories, too. Anyone remember old man Thompson from The Candy Quest? And what Dickie did to his poor fake leg? Yeah, that's Ollie's grandpa. Small world, huh? XD I really hope you guys enjoyed this second chapter! :)
Though her mind was still kind of blank, Jess was able to register the emotional tone of Ollie's voice. Jess turned her head to look at him and could see vulnerability in his features. For a second, Ollie looked like a kid again; the same freckle-faced little boy she fell in love with on the playground so many years ago. His big brown eyes searched her face while his fingers tangled in her hair, and Jessie felt like she could almost cry. Aww. She loved him so much more than she could ever say...
“I visited you, Dean,” he finally admitted, “The other night, I went back in time to 1988... to retrieve the summoning spell to catch the warlock... and I visited you...”
for help. Since when did the wisest hunter in the world need help from the same kids he called 'idjits'?
“Go get them,” the angel demanded.
“There's nothing we can do,” Michael replied, still holding onto Clarence's arm, “This is Jude's fight, now.”
“While I am not allowed to disclose the location of your honeymoon, Jude, I will say I am ninety-two percent certain that you will love it,” Papa smiled warmly.
“All better,” Jessica smiled at the boy.
Jude nestled further into Castiel's side to hide from Rowena's view and the angel immediately inched forward to cover his child in return. Castiel didn't like the thought of a witch – or anyone, for that matter – staring at his son in such an overly admiring way. It seemed that Dean agreed because he also eased in front of Jude.
Although Gabriel seemed quite distraught, he shared a look of understanding with Castiel before slowly forcing a nod, silently agreeing to keep the horrific information to himself.
