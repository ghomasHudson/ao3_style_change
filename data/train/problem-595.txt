John kissed him back, and Sherlock nearly forgot who was in charge here.
John was pretending to snore, despite it having been perhaps three minutes since Sherlock had left.
It felt bizarre, but not bad at all.
Sherlock regained his breath and pushed John back down.
How could Sherlock be both a genius and then so clueless about some things?
John began to take his shirt off when Sherlock gave him a look.
Sherlock closed his eyes, gripping himself tightly and hastily moving his hand, biting his lip as he came in a forceful burst which left him gasping for air.
“Sherlock, I--” John stops to clear his throat. "I was dreaming. One moment I was awake in bed and then I dozed off. And somehow it got jumbled up. I-I dreamed that I asked and , well, you said yes and right I’m guessing that didn’t actually happen and then I kinda….Jesus I’m sorry. I didn’t want it to be like this. I’m sorry.”
“Okay?” John prompts. And Sherlock knows he is not wrong that he hears a catch in John’s throat as he repeats the word. “Okay? Sherlock?”
“C’mon you brilliant man. You’re smart. Why would I want to have a drink today?”
“There is no way you know what I was going to say.”
Sherlock works through how she knew-- Moriarty? No a guard. And she knew what he liked. Easy to get information about the one visitor she had. Records harder to find but not with Irene's skill. But she didn't tell Sherlock. Logical. She could use the information to her advantage one day. Maybe to illicit a favour or more from Mycroft or himself. He doesn't actually blame her for this. He doesn't say this to her because it feels obvious. He waits for more.
"Fine. But I get two extra "
"A second chance." She smiles then and it seems rather genuine. "Or well twenty second more like it. I want to live in London. I want to do my work and I don't want interference."
Sherlock turns back to him, alarmed. “Is this just drunkenness or are you dying?”
John whimpers. Sherlock smiles but keeps his finger in place, even as John opens his mouth and darts out a tongue to lick at it.
John’s eyes say sorry. His lips purse to try to talk but in the end he simply kisses Sherlock’s finger in apology
"Yes, I suppose it is. But with it I’ll have everything I need and once it’s returned you'll be done with me for good. I promise to never contact you again." She stands, holds out her hand. "Deal?"
John Watson hard against his leg is the most amazing feeling he’s ever experienced. He absolutely wants, needs this to somehow be for him. In this moment he hates Mary for ever existing, hates himself for ever leaving, hates Moriarty for requiring the sacrifice, hates his brain, hates everything. In a few moments John will wake up and the horror on his face will be something Sherlock cannot stand to see. Still this has to end.
Irene is happy to receive the pearl and she gives Sherlock his thanks in the form of him watching her delete his number from her phone. It’s a largely symbolic act, but an important one between the two adversaries.
Sherlock: Yes.
Everything with Eurus is settled, but he can't help but think there's something else coming from Moriarty. A fail safe in case Eurus didn't fulfill their agreement. This is a worry. Of course this doesn't even begin to speak of the ache he feels right now. It's a mixed bag of good and bad really, this set up.
John: Hold on still typing.
“Don’t fuck me.”
Sherlock's reply comes quickly and John can't stop himself from beaming.
Sherlock sleepily nods, gives him a lazy smile, and closes his eyes again. John’s eyes pop a bit at what just happened then he scrambles away. His walk is a bit stiff, his mind reeling just a bit. It’s not that he’s never thought Sherlock would or could. But they’ve shared a bed a few times before and that’s never been a…problem. Not that it’s a problem. It’s not. It’s good!
Sherlock finds the Borgia pearl a week later and the place is nearly done. They lay in bed that night close. He's happy and sated in a way he never thought possible, but has been putting off this conversation and trying to figure out how to say it.
“You start.”
Sherlock kisses John on the day he moves back in. He even allows John to chose the code for the security alarm. Then, of course, changes it when John sentimentally chooses 0129 for the day they met.
“It’s only been two days.”
They look at each other once it finishes playing.
“So,” John says.
Sherlock looked up and seemed lost in thought for a moment, then he found the information, the date, John and Mary's no longer anniversary.
It wasn't until Rosie stirred just a bit that John knew he had to pull back. And he did. Sherlock did as well, but still looking intently at John, waiting.
Sherlock was where? Wasn't he just there? John didn't know. There was a fog. It was cold. John was walking in Regents yet again. He walked past the same two ducks at least four times. The sky changed from blue to a dark purple and then somehow orange mixed with bright red.
In the end they track down a lead to a woman who is not Mary, but rather Janine. John swears to not tell Harry as long as Janine promises this is her last job.
As he falls asleep he is almost sure he hears Sherlock say, “I’m here.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says, placing a hand on John’s shoulder. Trying to look in John’s eyes, but John closes his and looks away. His grip falls from Sherlock and he  lays on his back, looks up at the ceiling.
It's not as easy to cut ties and run like it was when Sherlock died. And ,yeah, that's another thing he needs to figure out. With a new, new therapist or no, he has to go back to Ella. She's confirmed to not be a secret member of the Holmes family and she knows him well enough. He’ll just have to say point blank that certain subjects are off limits. He never should have brought them up and they have to be let go. Other things to focus on now.
“You?” Sherlock asks then leans on the counter. He’s still tired, John can see that clearly, but there is something nice about how Sherlock feels comfortable here. Comfortable enough to lean and sleep and be here with John. That he knows he’s welcome in John’s home.
Three drinks later they’d moved to the living room to eat the much delayed food.
John let his eyes close, huffs out a sigh. “This could work you know?”
It wasn’t a line and yet John took his time crossing it--and the room. When he finally sat down beside Sherlock he took a breath. The way Sherlock had folded the dressing gown over himself the pocket was just over Sherlock’s crotch.
They walk to Sherlock's bedroom. John takes off all his kit and watches as Sherlock seems to almost dance while removing his clothes. John slips into Sherlock's bed as does Sherlock. Without any discussion Sherlock lays on John's chest, John's arm snakes around Sherlock's back, holds him close.
Sherlock: Oh.
Hours later she had heard it all. The whole of it that he’d kept inside for so long. Tried to make a joke about how they weren’t in a relationship no matter what people said. He laughed. She didn’t.
“John, are you perhaps imagining your deceased wife and my criminally insane sister in a cat fight?”
John: Me either. Honestly. And I've fucked this up for so long I'm afraid of doing something that'll ruin this.
Loving Sherlock wasn't a confusing thing to John. Even understanding that he wanted more wasn't a confusing thing, but figuring out what they should do with it all....that was the sticking point. He took a deep breath and laid back on his bed. Looked over at his phone on the side table and picked it up.
John grins and takes Sherlock to their room. He musses up Sherlock's suit very effectively.
He leans on the counter as John turns towards the dishes with a mind to finish them all. He keeps an ear on the conversation but finds his mind wondering if this is how it will be from here on out. Not with Rosie over Molly’s mind. But sometimes. Maybe with Mrs. Hudson helping out when they'd get a case that requires immediate attention.
“S’fine,” Sherlock says as he brushes past John on his way in. John turns and leaves him to it.
“Smart,” John said. And Sherlock turned away, tried to hide the smile.
"Your choice of jewelry says otherwise."
Kate’s look betrays far more than Sherlock had expected.
“So I um,” John started and looked away to the window then back at Sherlock. “I was wondering if you wanted to go out for a bite tonight.”
John: Kissing you.
Both his mother and father smile at him. He stands. Mycroft's face is impassive, but he nods in acquiesce. It's something.
“That was probably because she thought you’d figure out she was a part-time marijuana dealer.”
“Ahh,” Sherlock says. There seems to be more, but he doesn’t say it and that’s fairly typical for him. Sherlock stretches a bit then stops abruptly.  It’s only then that John sees it. He seems injured.
John showers and shaves and dresses. He cleans the dishes in sink but leaves Mary's mug where she last left it, in the sink waiting for him to wash because it was his turn.
"As you may remember I took myself to the brink of death recently. I know what I can handle. It's just...twinged a bit." Sherlock takes another sip. John does too.
"More. God Sherlock. Please more."
“Perfect timing in the middle of cleaning. Is this a plot to get me to do everything?”
He smiles at Sherlock.
Sherlock can't find the strength to feign an argument against it. He nods, turns off the engine, and pockets the keys.  Both men drag themselves slowly up the path with only John pausing to give a brief look around before picking up a fake rock, sliding out a key, and finally opening the front door. Sherlock smiles at the novelty, and does not mention the amount of break-ins that occurred because of such a device. Instead he follows John slowly inside, his eyes taking in so many details all at once.
“John, I’m so-”
“Yes,” Sherlock says and turns to leave the room.
Today he’d interviewed a few good child minders and was sure he’d found just the one. Open schedule she said. She knows CPR and all the like. She’s a nurse and also a self-professed ‘hippie’ and John likes that a bit. A different influence on Rosie. He immediately likes the woman, but he isn’t confused by who he is nor his life.  So he texts her name to Greg for a full background check then for good measure texts it to Mycroft so he won’t have to worry about her being a second cousin to the Holmes.
It was a nightmare, of course. But there was something in there, something he needed to remember. He didn't though so he let the dream slip away from him as the last of the stress it has caused slid away from him and then he was asleep.
John touched the screen and brought up the keyboard and began typing. He just wanted to gauge if Sherlock was up (though he knew he would be) and if he wanted to talk (he didn't know that though the man rarely did).
So John does. He recounts their first meeting to Sherlock. Sherlock falls asleep hearing it. John falls asleep telling it.
"It?"
He can’t quite think of what to say next and then it comes to him. “And you’re bloody gorgeous.” Sherlock crosses his legs then.
“I know,” Sherlock says. “It’s--It’s fine.” At least, Sherlock thinks to himself, he’ll try to make it fine. He thinks what John needs in this moment to make it better for him. He decides to ask, though he doesn’t want to ask, deciding to put John’s needs above his. “Do you-um, often, dream about...Mary?”
And when Mary turned out to not be who John thought he was they also worked together on that until Mary was safe. Her and the child which wasn’t John’s.
John smiled at his phone. A grin that spread to his eyes , which he realised far too late were welling up a bit. He blinked the tears away as his eyes went blurry. Then he took a breath. Sherlock wanted to come see him. Sherlock then re-thought it, but he wanted to see him right the hell now and that was..that was something.
"It's nothing dear. You just run along to see John. Send him our love."  His mother has a smile on her face and it’s a wondrous change from mere moments ago. His father wears a similar look.
“I know.” She smiles then gets back to trying to piece a mug together.
“Sit down you beautiful thing,” John says. He can’t quite stop himself.
Sherlock thinks back to the first night he wanted this and how he realised it was an impossibility then. He tries to shake his head and remind himself that it is still an impossibility. He is not who John is reaching out to touch, to want. It’s Mary. She is still here in the room. He thinks of the cup remaining in the sink. She is still in John’s heart. He thinks of the words uttered moments ago. As John just said...she is “here.”
"Would you, however, accompany me to bed for a while?" Sherlock smiles.
"Apologise? John really! It was their own stupidity which allowed the killer to get the jump. He was almost out of the country because they'd lost the paper containing his flight details."
“Just if it gets worse will you tell me please?”
This breaks Sherlock's heart a thousand times over. He can only imagine that John is dreaming of Mary. He isn't sure what to do. Does he wake John from what must be a happy dream or does he withstand the torment of the situation.
So I watched as Holmes’ skilful fingers unbuttoned my fly and I started on his shirt. At one point, he took my hand and brought it up to his lips. He kissed my knuckles, staring down at my chest as he did so, as though deep in thought about this action. When again he let my hand fall and go about removing his clothes, he paused for a moment before slipping his own hands into my trousers. He waited until I was too distracted to see him doing so. But I tell you, I felt it.
“Hush, my dear friend. I will need some preparation, but I will not ask…”
Unmade and messy, the single bed creaked quietly under the weight of us two men as we sat upon it. I sat beside Holmes, readjusting my position in such a way that I could continue kissing him, but not agitate my leg wound from the awkward seating positon. We did not last too long like this, side by side as though we were in a Hansom. No, Holmes stood up once more, finally breaking the kiss, and after removing both his jacket and black waistcoat, climbed upon my lap. You may not think this was much better for my leg, but I do not think, if it did hurt, I felt it at all. The weight of the taller, but leaner man bearing down upon me was so delicious and ignited such a sensation that I could feel nothing but the areas in which his body touched mine. His torso which pressed against mine, the underside of his thighs weighing upon the top side of mine, his arms wrapped about my shoulders and neck and his lips which had once again found their way to mine.
And this time, the kiss had once again deepened again. I was convinced this Holmes had done before. But I could scarcely believe it, in a way. He parted my lips and…I turned my head more and pulled Holmes closer to me. Like this, he could be closer, and closer, and yet it did not seem enough. I wanted to feel every part of him. I may have held him as tight as I could, but it was not tight enough. Finally, I had done away with my nervousness to touch him. I still was not entirely confident in my actions, I merely no longer feared placing my hands upon him. I longed to do so.
“Holmes,” I whispered, “I want you to know that the world is unworthy of you. No man, nor woman is deserving enough of you.”
Holmes was smiling at me. I wondered whether this was some sort of joke, that he was mocking me for something. I expected the next word he said to be the punchline. A cruel one, but I would laugh. I needed a laugh, for this all felt a little too… real.
“I don’t mind helping you Holmes. You certainly need this, but are you sure?”
I doubt I expected Holmes to give me a proper answer. He smirked. His eyes twinkled. He looked away a moment, then looked back, and held out a hand. Shyly- the shyest I have ever been- I took it and let him draw me closer to him. I did not know what to make of that. For as well as I knew my friend, there were the odd occasions when his familiar expressions and characteristic manners stumped me. I could not decipher this one way or another.
Holmes was not. I did not wish to assume that he had done anything akin to this before, but there were instances such as this that made me wonder. He swiftly, while still kissing me, unfastened the two jacket buttons I had done up, and carefully threaded the garment off my arms. We let it fall to the ground and pool there. Though I was a man who took care of my clothes and prided myself on being well-dressed, this moment was more important to me than the state of my attire. When Holmes removed my waistcoat next, I gave not a thought to the crumpled and creased mess it became on the ground. It certainly did not matter to me, as Holmes was guiding me towards his bed.
“Yes,” he says. He holds his breath and waits.
"No."
John: Oh.
As his lips pressed forward against Sherlock's the main fact running through his head was that Sherlock was kissing him back. It wasn't really appropriate for John to open his mouth and deepen the kiss, but that's exactly what happened after long moments.
“Hmm?” John answers but he doesn’t have the strength to even open his eyes.  His relaxes back to almost sleep. Sherlock says nothing else.
John pulls back then, blows out a long and steady breath. “But you’re right.”
Sherlock wanted to drive back. He didn't want a driver or a police escort. He needed it to be solely him and John until they reached London.  He would again be firmly in charge of their journey. He couldn't save John the torment of today, hell of the past month, but he could drive him safely home.
“It has to end.”
“Sherlock. Fuck,” John says. The spatula clatters then and John’s hold on him becomes even tighter. Sherlock doesn’t say anything. Just this. This is enough. “Sherlock, we….we have got to get our shit together.” John huffs out a laugh, but continues. “Because I can’t…I can’t do this without you.” Sherlock can’t help but disagree. John can do anything, he truly can. He simply doesn’t know it. “And I…I won’t let you do anything without me. Not again.”
“Okay good.”
“For the last time I’m not…” Sherlock stops himself. Perhaps revealing this isn’t the best time. He changes his statement to “interested in a….” He doesn’t want to say romantic entanglements because that really isn’t true and repeating the lie will make it seem even more so. “Girlfriend.”
"The...thing you--we--you were just doing. The...dry hu-”
“A world of no,” Sherlock said.
"Mostly...well. You."
Waiting to realise exactly what he was supposed to say in the moment.
John types back then debates adding the next line for a full minute before pressing send.
“Just Rosie. Going to see Molly and Mrs. Hudson. See about them keeping her a bit longer, at least until I figure out what to do about work and a few other things.”
“Hardly.” Holmes chuckled, letting his legs fall to the floor and his tall figure sink into the chair.
“Nothing. Nothing, Holmes. I just do not follow what you mean.”
I was, as you can imagine, quite taken aback by that proclamation. In the many years I had spent with Holmes, I’d heard the most hurtful insults and personal digs from his mouth. And I had also heard my fair share of complements, which was a great privilege and meant a great deal to me, as rarely did anyone receive acknowledgement from one of the smartest men in the world.
He continued in a soft, gentle voice. One gentler than usual.
“Watson.”
“Because you are.” Holmes said plainly, “What makes you think I am deserving?”
And, I was also too nervous to instigate matters.
A smutty extra chapter. Please forgive me...
I felt just a little bad.
Again, I lost my breath. I choked and spluttered to reply to him, but all that I managed was an agreement. I would help him. I worried. I was not sure that I had the knowledge necessary to keep him safe, but it was in this moment, like many others, that his confidence inspired some in me. He sat up, still straddled over my legs, and placed the pot on my stomach. It was cold and made me flinch, but he seemed to find that amusing too. Giving him a dirty look, I then watched him coat his fingers in the lotion and prepare himself with it. As he did so, small sounds escaped his mouth, sounds I had never heard him make in my entire time living with him. Sounds that were desperate, wanton, base. His eyes would flutter shut and brow knot as, I assumed, pleasure rushed through him.
Sherlock's mother and father are waiting for him to say what to do. It's up to him somehow. As if he is more capable than anyone else in this room. In all reality he considers the facts of the situation before speaking and comes up short. Then he thinks of what the bravest and most true man he knows would do and he finds a possible solution.
“For God’s sake.”
They find their way around loving each other and living the life they chose.
This annoys Sherlock to no end as he has suggested Gladstone.
Three years past Mary's death a package arrives with a set of maps and a coded letter. John wants to throw it away, but they agree for the sake of Rosie to figure it out. They work day and night tracking down the leads and clues. It leads them around the world twice. Rosie stays with Aunt Molly and Uncle Greg with Uncle Myc providing round the clock security.
It was confusing at first. Impossible really to come to an understanding. And he still doesn't know if they made the right decision. Seems a bit unfair to that John Watson in that world. Because he was that daft once.
John reaches for her mug in the sink. It's silly, but using it feels like...he doesn't know. It's a connection he still needs for the time being. He takes down his own mug and rinses it out along with Mary’s, dries them off and waits for the brew to finish. He's dragging this morning and he knows why. Now there is hard work to do. Hard work he isn't ready to do. Now he needs to work out a schedule. Now he needs to look for full-time care for Rosie. Now he needs to maybe sell the house. Mary made sure he could afford it on his own, but does he want to stay here?
"Opulent, but clean I like to call it," Irene says while scanning the room, her eyes landing on a few different works of art.
“If I could give you one bit of advice before we part ways entirely, Sherlock.”
"I'll play for her."
“Just….” John wants to say don’t tell me, but that really isn’t the best way. Maybe if he’d read the hard drive. Maybe if he hadn’t buried his head in the sand earlier then things could’ve been different. John lays on his back, looks away from Sherlock, up at the ceiling. He takes a breath. “Tell me.”
Sherlock finishes his water then hands the cup to John who sits it besides his.
Well then, John thought, he gave it a try. He walked to the phone and picked it up. Called in an order for Angelo's then walked to the cupboard and took down two mugs, rooted around and found that bottle of scotch that they’d been gifted by the Czar of Omai.
“I do, but- I’m sorry.”
“Just one more.”
Sherlock: Oh I did. I've been having him sit outside your door for a while.
John says, “Ahh.” Then turns silent. A few moments later Sherlock notices his breath has evened out. He doesn’t move at all.  Asleep. Sherlock watches him sleep for a few moments before he allows himself this indulgence. He reaches out his hand to take John's pulse. Fingers sliding to John's wrist.  But John’s hand moves instead to intertwine their fingers. He tightens his hand around Sherlock’s, swipes the pad of his thumb over Sherlock's hand--once, twice, then doesn’t stir beyond that. Sherlock lets out a breath. He feels himself hope for just a moment and falls asleep.
John's brows furrowed. He closed his eyes. Part of him was willing something to be said, but he couldn't quite figure out just what. What he did know was that his hands were not shaking, but he thought they should be. They absolutely should be, but were absolutely still.
"Can I borrow a shirt again?"  He asks.
“Eurus might’ve changed her mind on that.”
“Yeah well you weren’t to know. I only know because she offered me some out of sympathy after you...when you di--were away.”
"A-And I don’t want you to wake up in the morning feeling bad about using that. Now I’m going to take my hand down and I want you to agree with me. Okay?”
Sherlock doesn’t have time to dwell on this further as John’s upper body moves that much closer to Sherlock then his lower half  thrusts forward.  Sherlock's body is alight. A harsh breath is forced from his lungs. He feels his body respond quickly. He has to stop this. He has to. He tries to take a calming breath and get under control, but John's lips travel and find their way onto Sherlock's neck. He lays a gentle kiss there which breaks Sherlock. His eyes sting with the thought of what he cannot have. He cannot continue this.
“Me and Mrs. Hudson. We kinda figured after the other day when we had Rosie...when you called.”
This stops the giggles from Sherlock. He shakes his head, but he begins speaking. “She became what she thought you wanted to gain your attention. A beautiful alluring lass who was soft and simple. The opposite to what your current life held.”
Stradivarius for Sherlock. It meant he'd lose his cuddle partner, but he was excited to see the looks on their faces, hear what they'll say.
The end.
“You were going to once again try to talk me into calling my brother.”
As the car drove through the streets, turning this way and that he traded a few messages with John. It wasn't typical of him, he knew. But hidden beneath his embarrassment of the morning was a need to reach out, to keep the connection. Could not let John forget that he was there and would not leave.
And another.
Sherlock wakes and turns to lay on his back. John is all but directly atop him. His arms bracketing each side of Sherlock’s head, trying to remain up. The rest of his body is in a push-up stance to keep the distance.
John’s bladder reminds him that needs must be met. He gives a sigh and wriggles his fingers loosening the tenuous grip.  Sherlock, who was quiet, calm a moment ago opens one eye and darts it around landing on John. He doesn’t ask, but John knows.
Sherlock: I think I'm in love with you and have been for a very long time.
“I’ve always wanted to solve the top ten-”
"Why do you get two extra?"
"Some protection is always warranted. Wouldn't you say?"
John let out a breath then bit his lip. Forward. Only forward.
“Regardless,” Sherlock says. “Just as an FYI you’re not actually allowed to date my sister.”
Then one day John was stood outside of Bart’s not believing this was happening. He hadn’t just seen Sherlock die. He wasn’t just standing, waiting for a fuckin cab to take him back to their flat. That hadn’t just happened.
"I know your body too," John says and immediately wants to take it back. It shouldn't sound like innuendo, but it does. Not something Sherlock picks up typically but he doesn’t respond immediately. He takes another drink before speaking.
"Three then."
“Yes,” Sherlock says before John finishes his sentence.
Rosie gets older.
"Dinner?" John asks.
Sherlock's mind was busy cataloging and deleting. He was calling upon established protocols to spare him further frustrations regarding the incident. He was also trying quite hard to not think about what would have happened if he hadn't gotten to John in time.  As they neared John’s home, Sherlock reached out a hand and placed it on his shoulder, adding a brief squeeze.  It would have to serve as voice to what he needed to say.
“Do you-?” Sherlock starts to say and then stops.
“Obviously. As you said. A grenade was set off in our flat and we need to make it more secure.” Sherlock stresses the word “our” and John smiles bright. “I agree. I’ll text Mycroft to speed it up though.”
Sherlock stands at that, walks in front of John, looks down at him. The schooled face switching between nervousness and practiced uncaring.
"I want to do this right, John," Sherlock says. "After years of dancing around this I want to do this right. It's-It's the most important thing I'll ever do."
“You’re the most clever man I’ve ever met you know.”
“You--what?” Sherlock blurts. “What did you say?”
Sherlock shakes his head no, but doesn’t elaborate. He's done with that.
He hears the shower begin running so John heads to the kitchen and takes down the coffee. He grinds the beans and starts the brew. He didn't do this before Mary. Before her he was good with a standard cup but she wouldn't stand for it. So out went the old coffee grounds and in came a grinder and new machine. At least it's not the French press method she preferred some days.
He knows John doesn’t need to hear what he could offer by way of apology. John, by his own words, no longer blames Sherlock for what happened with Mary. But Sherlock knows if he’d only, if he’d only.
Sherlock responds matter of factly. John laughs. Sherlock smiles wide. The sound of John laughing is a balm whose efficacy cannot be measured.
Sherlock surges forward to kiss him. He didn't expect that.
"What do you want, Irene?"
Sherlock nods in return then gently eases the shirt from John’s hands. It's only then that John realises he'd been clutching it tight. Sherlock slips on the shirt, looks down at the figure on the front. No recognition appears on his face and John finds that to be a damn shame. He’ll make plans to educate Sherlock about the brilliant Ziggy Stardust.
John turns his head toward the windows and takes a guess at the time. It’s possibly nearing seven or a little after. It's not as if he's a lot planned for today, but there is plenty to be done. First of which is he needs a long piss and to drink a very large cup of coffee.
John gave him a tight smile and a nod. The familiar stormy blue eyes cast downward then turned back to the window without a word.
"I knew your love story was one of the special ones," she said. "I just didn't know how special my boys were."
"One is not enough."
Harry and John hug. They apologise and say they'll be more kind to each other. Harry got her 1 year chip and she thanks John for inviting her and keeping the bar dry to help her with this step.
Sherlock and Sherlock responded in unison. "Oh for God's sake." And they both simultaneously rolled their eyes.
“Close to cracking that Godfrey business are you? Going to move on to Pimlico Poisoning next?”
“I won’t ask. The cost is too great,” Sherlock said.
“Come here.”
"No. You're wasting your questions guessing names."
"You," Sherlock says. His lips are pursed and beautiful around the word.
“Please God,” John says. “Please say something.”
John holds him closer, smiles to himself. "I do."
"It has to be one or the other."
Tonight was a repair and renewal and something even more. But there’s a connection still missing, words still unsaid.
“Oh, I suppose…” Sherlock blinks and gives him a small smile. “I never thought you’d think of it like that.”
Right on cue a soft snore escapes from Sherlock. John smiles at him. Sherlock Holmes asleep is something quite special, quite human. Even if Sherlock sometimes isn’t.
“Fine,” Sherlock says and unfolds himself and walks to the kitchen. John watches him go. He seems regal in the t-shirt and a pair of John’s never worn silky boxers. He’d bought them on a whim and Sherlock is a fuckin sight in them. Hell he’s a sight in anything, in nothing even. But John is feeling something he shouldn’t be feeling right now. He firmly tells himself that he’s not allowed even one more sip tonight and he’ll keep himself far away from Sherlock as possible.
“Oh, yes, yes,” Sherlock says. But he doesn’t say anything else. He takes another sip.
Sherlock: So much that I got dressed to take a cab over to see you then realised that might be known as coming on a bit strong.
"You knew one and what he liked."
"I want to know. You always said you didn't and Mrs. Hudson was at her sisters. I don’t recall throwing them out. And Mycroft hadn’t sent his cleaning minions around to check up on me for ages at that point."
Mrs. Hudson makes all the food for the very small ceremony.
"Let this be real, Sherlock. Sherlock, let this be real."
Sherlock slows the moment and weighs his options.
The splashes of color, expensive pieces are sparse but each makes a statement. Those who dwell here take style very seriously.
"But for now you do know that I....well I..." Sherlock's words peter out. John however hears the unspoken words because he feels them as well.
The three dots appeared and then faded away into nothing with no response. So Sherlock was awake, but didn't want to talk or considered it and felt it wasn't worth the effort. So John tried again with no eloquence at all this time considered.
She let it go that night and didn’t really bring it up again. She was there for him and helped him and fuck how dare he even consider moving on. Jesus. What kind of asshole is he?  And with? What is he trying to force on Sherlock? Sherlock
John dips his mouth to Sherlock’s neck then. He gives a gentle suck just...there. In that place he's always wanted to taste.  Sherlock doesn’t stop one sound then, he clutches at John’s arms.
Once the papers were created and one officially because William Sherlock and the other Sherlock William they had discussed which would keep the name in house. In the end confusion seemed to be the best option. John nor Sherlock or Sherlock wanted to use the William name. So in house they were both Sherlock. When they visited crime scenes they traded off on who would be William and who would be Sherlock.
“About you?!” John’s voice is twinged with hurt, anger and he’s not sober enough to keep his voice level.
“Yes, I know. It’s fine. I know you must miss her.”
"Sherlock, I had two options. Blackmail you or be honest. I'm trying the latter."
The minutes tick by and he knows this should be especially boring, tedious even and yet he can't quite find it as such. He allows his eyes to close and enjoys this for what it is. Maybe this is all they're meant to be to each other, but it's more than he ever expected and this is good.
Great, John thinks. The only drawback to the pullout is when you get up you're guaranteed to disturb the other person. John pulls down the blankets and starts to extricate himself. He stretches and turns over and there’s really no other option, so he climbs over Sherlock, tries not to wake him but as he’s climbing it becomes impossible.
"We are settled here, at least for a bit." She sits back down next to him, closer than before. His guard is up. "I need your help to maintain this."
“Or,” John turns to him. “This is actually a pullout.”  John reaches down underneath and tugs at two long pulls. He leans up and back and the sofa turns into a pull-out bed. He begins rearranging the bedclothes to cover the full size.
“Thank you for the new child proof things in the flat. I appreciate it.”
Sherlock buys her a dog. John names it Woggie.
Sherlock thinks long and hard.
John Watson, 1.7 meters tall, cardigan wearing. A sly smile on his face. A quiet confidence that no one seems to know where it originates. John knows. Because John did not leave three continents with a smile just for no good reason. No, he did it because he's always had that knack, that gift for telling what pleases a person, what their core needs. It's not a trick, not a ruse. He just pays attention to people just like Sherlock pays attention to clues. Having the knowledge of what Sherlock needed, wanted wasn't something John considered using. And he didn't. So perhaps sometimes he mentioned that Sherlock was brilliant right before he needed him to get rid of some disgusting spores in the fridge. Sherlock always complied after the praise. This was good, useful. He didn't abuse the knowledge because he had a sneaking feeling that Sherlock was well aware of it. John assumed he was letting it continue as he got something out of it too.
Lestrade came around not a day after and said he was glad Sherlock was going to try to be nicer. Sherlock gave a glance to John with a raised eyebrow. John beamed at him.
The partition rolled down revealing Kate, Irene Adler’s mistress, sitting in the driver’s seat. She smiled into the rear view mirror.
Then more cases after that. They went in and out of London. They went in and out of the country. John rarely had to use his knowledge and ,in fact, never thought to use it again after they solved the case of the curious mirror.
He tosses a tee gently to Sherlock. Sherlock knows this shirt actually. It's one of John’s almost threadbare shirts that he holds onto despite the fact that it probably should've been binned ages ago. The RAMC logo in the corner. Sherlock’s fingers trace the lettering as he hears John climb onto the bed and move underneath the covers.
He means. It’s good that Sherlock does feel. But John realises that means the woman and him surely must’ve then. Maybe they even still do.
It’s not like when Sherlock died. John saw him for years after. Around every corner, in every crowd, and definitely at 221B. It was one of the reasons he had to leave. He’d come back to their flat and could almost see Sherlock sat looking at his microscope or reading in his chair. He’d have poor versions of their previous conversations with the non-existent Sherlock. And he always felt pained afterwards.
'Even with the drapes pulled shut, it is annoyingly bright in here, isn't it?'  He asked, licking his bottom lip.  'As you're resting, I think it appropriate that you put your sleeping mask on.'
John had found it both annoying and adorable at first, but after experiencing the phenomenon as often as he'd done, only thought it annoying now.  At least, for the most part.
Sherlock dragged the frosty thing along John's thigh before it was batted away.
John jumped and let out a few choice curse words.
The early morning sunbeams coaxed shadows from the objects within 221 b Baker Street, along with splashing full along with the inhabitants' faces.
Once all of the syrup was gone, Sherlock went up and kissed John deeply, letting him taste the sweetness.
He wasn't one to speak much during this kind of activity, and it felt odd.
This wasn't about his pleasure this time.
'Hu- oooh...'  John mumbled, letting out an 'ah!' moments later as Sherlock began gently smoothing the whipped cream over John's bollocks.
John could hear thin plastic wrapping begin torn off of something, and he tried to think of what it might be.
John had been generous enough to take him over the edge several times without reciprocation, and it was time to give back a little.
'Better?'  Sherlock inquired, feeling awkward.
Never had Sherlock shown a shred of actual assertion in this manner at all...
Sherlock nodded, though there wasn't much point to it.  'Right, good, good.'
He took the mask from the nightstand beside the bed and put it on.
His lips curled up into that sexy little grin that John adored so much, before leaning in close and kissing John in an almost painfully gentle way.
John shuddered as the last twinges went through him, and he began to feel much more tired than he'd been before.
This was a first.
Suddenly, he felt a jolt go through his body as something hideously cold touched his skin!
Sherlock had begun by using only the tip of his tongue, working his way down from John's slightly hairy chest.
But, his organisational efforts had been a waste of time, with John reverting to his age-old habit within a fortnight.
He stood up, entirely naked as he left the concealment of the crimson duvet, and went over to the window, the glaring light making his pale skin seem notably more alabaster as he closed the maroon drapes.
He noted the pre-cum leaking copiously and knew John wouldn't last much longer.
Sherlock did a quick search of their inventory, looking for a shortlist of specific items.
'Oh, shit, I'm sorry!'  John apologised guiltily, pulling the mask off.
John's eyebrows came together in a moment of surprise.
'Er, yeah, fine.'  John replied.
He'd never been hard for that long without any attention, and the result had been surprisingly positive.
'Ah, no.'  Sherlock intoned, shaking his head a bit.  'You're obviously far too weary for that.  Now, lie back down properly.'
The corners of John's lips turned up ever so slightly.
He got up from the bed, grabbing the fluffy purple robe Molly had given him last Christmas and went into the bathroom.
'I'll be right back.  You stay there as you are.'  Sherlock told him, dashing nakedly off to the pantry.
John wasn't sure what to think of this.  It was not anything they'd ever done before.
Why they hadn't, John didn't know, and he found himself becoming more and more intrigued by what might happen next.
When a calm sigh came from John, he knew it was all right again.
Sherlock heard the smallest of moans escape John; this sort of sound wasn't easy to coax out of him, and it was Sherlock's absolute favourite thing to hear.
'Are you f***ing kidding me?'  John spat, wondering what Sherlock had been thinking.
It wasn't easy to ignore his own raging erection while he did his best to conduct this mild experiment on John, and focusing was quite the challenge; but, he had set out to please John and that's what he was going to do.
'Didn't shut the curtains again, I see...'  Grumbled John, who tossed an arm over his eyes in limp fashion.
He removed his arm from his eyes and gave Sherlock a pained expression.
He really was rather knackered after the night they'd just spent together; dashing after criminals, then sprinting about after a small dog concerning the case, had proven thorough exercise.
Deciding to forget about the whipped cream and the other things, Sherlock took a breath and swallowed John's entire length without a hint of warning.
Sherlock moved up close and kissed John's cheek.  'Sweet dreams.'
He began concocting a plan in his mind and decided that the mask wasn't going to be enough.
Once, Sherlock had even put in the time and effort to arrange each cupboard in the most rational way possible for John.
Sherlock warmed the assaulted area with his warm hands, massaging away the unpleasant sensation of the ice lolly.
John closed his eyes, his loins draining most of his attention away from all else.  'Well, just that - I'm tired, and I haven't any energy at all.  Your snoring away all night didn't exactly help me sleep, by the way.'
'Well, that's not much use, now, is it?'  John complained upon hearing the sound of the fabric rustling.
John tried to convince Sherlock that it was fine and that he had a system.  He apparently knew just where everything was (which, he, in fact, did not).
Which was something that John could have done when the light had actually been bothering him, instead of winging about the curtains.  But, Sherlock kept this to himself, of course.
Though, he hadn't realised it would be so hard...  Er, difficult, that is to say.
An idea struck, and Sherlock rolled with it.
He promptly chucked it into the wastebasket.  'Sorry.'
And, considering the seven-hour shift at emerg he'd done beforehand, he was all the more tired for it.
'Sorry.'  Sherlock half-mumbled as he rubbed his eyes.
John couldn't help it, he bucked his hips and causing Sherlock to choke.
He pulled one of two remaining items from the bag, and shook it before applying it to John's proud appendage.
Then, experimentation began; Sherlock tried pressing his tongue flat against, working with only the sides, the bottom of his tongue - different patterns, rhythms, pressures.
He let John slip out of his mouth, swallowing the semen as John opened his eyes in time to witness it.
“You?”
“No one?” I helplessly parroted.
I was not expecting for Holmes to smile at that. He took the tub from me, lay it next to my shoulder and lowered himself down so that he could kiss me again. He rested his forehead on my own and looked into my eyes through his lashes.
Holmes shook his head, closing his eyes softly for the merest of moments, then opening them again. When he again met my gaze, the smile on his face was quite genuine. His eyebrows were raised slightly, smoothing the lines of his forehead and brightening up his face. Coupled with the calming tone with which he spoke, there was a fond and gentle air about him.
This was not the first time. Holmes, in all his bohemian traits, was not a man who particularly took privacy seriously at home. Not that he would walk around the place entirely undressed, but he had the habit of leaving his door open when dressing, if he was dressing in a rush. He had even done so in the presence of clients before, perhaps without realising. So I had seen the almost translucent tone of his skin, the shadow tossed over his visible ribs, the look of his chest, shoulders, neck. I had seen it before. But never like this. And never had I been close enough to it to touch.
I tell you, I was not surprised by my friend’s correct assumption. He had a talent for knowing what I wanted before I even had the thought to request it. But I cannot say I was not a little shocked by the casual delivery of what was quite a life changing prospect. Even Holmes could not deny that what I was thinking of could have important repercussions should I go through with it. I could move out. I may not be able to accompany him on cases, or have the time to write them up. I half expected him to be more, for lack of a better word, possessive of me.
“You have a terrible opinion of them.” I chided him, “If you knew so well that I would find one to marry, who would you propose would be a better option?”
“I do not think Mary is unsuitable for you. I think all women are unsuitable.”
Having lost my voice, I engaged another part of my body. I leant over and poked him in the arm. He woke slowly, as though he had fallen asleep in the short stretch of silence. Then, as I drew my hand away, he seemed a-rush with energy. He reached out and grasped my wrist. It was a quick and forceful action, and yet he held me gently. He used me to stabilise himself as he twisted about and sat the wrong way in the chair, facing the back pillows. Once he had settled, he moved his hand downwards to hold mine.
Between my fascination with the blissful pleasure on his face and my own medical curiosity, I could not take my eyes off him. My hands were balled into fists at my side, letting him use me, letting him guide me into him. He lowered himself slowly, slowly, the further he got, the quicker his breath came, and louder. He hissed through his teeth at times, let out a sharp exhale at others. And though he seemed to quiver desperately and tensely around me, he went slowly. Painfully slow. I mean, it was a feeling like no other. I would not say I was inexperienced in carnal relations myself, but this I was entirely new to and it was... well as I think about it, I have used every positive adjective in the English language to describe it. I cannot think of any more.
At first, it was as though all the wind had been knocked out of me. My hips thrust upwards involuntarily, my stomach tensed. I looked up at Holmes to see him smirking. He met my gaze and hushed me.
My mood softened. You see, I liked not being in the dark. I relied heavily upon Holmes to explain matters to me, and he obliged. And when, on those occasions that he offered me the chance to practice my deductive skills, he rarely gave me things too out of my depth. In this case, it was not above me. In fact, he was playing into my hands. Holmes was the cool, rationing machine, an expert in logic and reason. I, on the other hand, was an expert in the emotional. Love was a man’s motive to Holmes. To me, it was a part of my life. I should have recognised it when I saw it.
Calmly, he said, “I am glad to have you as my doctor. But I am sure you have heard of this before. Surely you can assume the same as me, that if it were not so enjoyable, people would not risk ruination for it. If done correctly, which I trust you will assist me with, I will be in no danger. You will help me, will you not, Watson?”
“Forget the implications of such an act,” I breathed, “It is violent and dangerous, is it not?”
“Watson,” His voice was barely above a whisper. I could not bring myself to take my eyes off his hands. They had moved lower, lower peeling away at my shirt and the white undershirt beneath it, leaving my chest and stomach exposed. They now sat at the waistband of my trousers, the tips of his fingers feathering my stomach. “I ask you again if this is what you desire.”
And to make matters even more unbelievable, I watched as Holmes drew me out of my undergarments. His eyes were fixated on me. I burned with embarrassment and shame. I know not why. Or I did. I could not fathom the idea that I was on display for Holmes, and that he was taking such an interest.
Somehow, however, I organized my thoughts. I opened my mouth and let out a slow, unsure breath. I do not believe I had breathed for some time.
None the less, he did not seem unhappy. A smile twinkled in his eyes. Though I feared I had lost our intimacy for the night, I was sure I could get it back. A gentle hand on his thigh brought him back to me.
Holmes was not frightened. Or if he was, I could not tell. For the next movement he went to make was to tilt my chin upwards and claim my mouth with his own.It was a big moment, that in which our lips met for the very first time, but to me, it felt as natural as anything we had ever done. It did send electric pulses of excitement rush through me, like a great build-up had finally come to its perfect conclusion, and yet at the same time, it was nothing at all, nothing worth the fanfare. It felt as though we had always done it, always displayed our feelings in such a way.
“Hold me, Watson.” He said, his voice calm but tense. It threatened to break, to break into a growl or howl like an animal. But ever the one to control his wildness, it did not. I obeyed, grasping his hips. And with that, I supported him as he moved. It was with that that I could not hold back. I thrust up into him and helped him move in tandem. He rode me almost to the point of climax, then suddenly flipped us over. My legs almost gave out as I rose to my knees. I shivered and shook, canting my hips without control. Holmes pulled me close. He buried his face in my neck and wrapped his arms around me. I held him tight as we climaxed together, him first, then me.
Soon, the hand beneath my chin fell to my neck, rested there a short while, before finding a place upon my hip. These deliberate movements encouraged to me to touch him back. All this while the only I had permitted myself was to curl my own fingers around his and kiss him back. That is all. Now, however, I was given the cue, and though I felt awfully shy, I brought my own free hand up and rested it against his chest. As our kiss intensified, I found myself clinging to him, grasping the fabric of his jacket, and the waistcoat and white shirt beneath it. I longed in that moment to discard such cumbersome garments, but I would not rush things. I cared not if this was the first of many, or the only opportunity for such things, I would treat it as though I would never be gifted the same perfect circumstance again.
I felt I had something to worry about when I friend leapt to his feet and stepped over to his chest of draws. There, as he shed his trousers and underwear and stood in the low light, shimmering like a ghostly apparition, he fumbled in the mess in there to retrieve a pot of something. A lotion or an oil of some description. Turning back around, I now had a full view of him. He too was aroused. I doubted I had ever seen him in such a state. If I had, I had ignored it, writing it off as a perfectly normal bodily function that cannot be helped, even by the most disciplined of minds, or I had convinced myself I had not seen anything at all. I could not convince myself of that now. My heart thundered as the man approached me, my hands shaking as he handed me the tub. I knew at once what this meant, and I tell you, as a doctor, it worried me.
“You are considering proposing to her.”
“Obviously not.” I replied with a short laugh, “Have you?”
“That and the extremely suggestive fact that you keep looking over at me and opening your mouth indicates you wish to ask me something, something that has weighed heavy on your mind for some time, I fancy. I believed at first it might pass or oust itself, but since neither has occurred, I am giving you one opportunity: speak to me.”
Finally, the tightness had eased, he moved more freely on me. Already I was close and could have finished easily with his hand. It took much of my willpower and force not to cut this short. But he paused. It was wonderful, to take a moment and feel him, but I would not finish from it. He paused and took one of my hands.
“Forgive me if I sounded as though I was insulting the young lady. You have quite misunderstood me. “
I sat up in my chair, placed my pen in its holder and closed my book, busying myself so I would not have to meet Holmes’ amused gaze.
I peered up from my writing and cast my eyes on my dearest friend. It was late one evening. I sat up at my writing desk, practically covered in notes from our latest case. My fingers were stained with ink. My writing was a mess. The light was low. It was not warm, not cold. It was an unremarkable night, and would have remained so had this conversation never began. And it may not have, as I was going back and forth in my mind, considering whether I should consult my friend on a matter that seemed incapable of escaping me.
“You misunderstand me again, my good fellow. It is very little to do with Mary, or any women. It is about you.”
“But you have not written a word in ten minutes, and the rhythm of your breathing has changed.”
I was left, mouth open, mind swimming, utterly confused and strangely emotional, as though someone had rejected my sincerest feeling and walked out of the room to let me mull over it in my own misery. I could not leave it like that, and yet I could not bring myself to say anything. Still nothing made sense.
There is something about holding hands, is there not? It is so intimate a touch. You grasp a man by the wrist or take his arm while walking the street. You touch his back to guide him, and grip his shoulder to move him, but touching hands is entirely a different act. It seemed to link us both. It prevented me from asking what I had planned to, perhaps because I had realised what he had meant.
“I don’t follow.”
I sat back in my chair, looking at the narrow gap left by the ajar door, and when I saw one of Holmes’ bright blue eyes peeking back at me, I rose and followed him.
But none had I heard in such a manner as this one. For a moment, I was quite dumbstruck, knowing not how to reply to that.
It was not only the feeling of him around me, me inside him, it was his reaction. Never had I seen him give over himself to something in this way before. Music, yes, cases, of course, those terrible narcotics, unfortunately so, but pleasure? There was such an intensity to it.
“Come here, my dear friend.” I told him, and snaked an arm around my back. Though he looked unsure, he soon turned towards me. I sat up upon his bed and he lay over my lap. I lay a hand on his head and stroked his hair, which was wet with sweat. I too had perspired a little. I still had yet to catch my breath. Holmes, on the other hand, with all the stamina in the world, was breathing as deeply and calmly as though he was drifting off to sleep.
“Nonsense!” I practically squeaked. My face felt hot. I hoped it was only the warmth of the fire, and not a blush of colour from his words. “What makes you think I am so deserving?”
“Deduce, Watson.”
In fact, he was.
He was looking thin. I remember thinking that. It was a silly thing to think, of course, in that moment. But as I say, I was not thinking clearly. My heart was pounding so hard in my chest, sending every ounce of blood downwards. I was wracked with pleasure and… there was another emotion, mingled with that. A deep, intense one I cannot name. Together these two feelings had me muted. I could not quite believe this was all happening.
Now that answer was a surprise.
“Have I?” I tried not to snap. It was not becoming of me, and I knew Holmes better than to take everything he said so personally.
Now, I saw it, and I think Holmes saw in me that realisation. He smiled and let go of my hand, and heaved himself onto his feet. He stretched like a black cat, all dressed in a well-fitting three-piece. He smoothed his hair back and strode towards his room.
“I just do not understand what you expect of me, Holmes.” I told him.
“You do not think so?”
I had no other option. Out with it, or let it go unspoken.
“You needn’t have asked.” I insisted. Already I was drawn towards him until we were so close our bodies flushed together, and he wrapped his long fingers around my hand. Then, once all the words that we needed to have shared were spoken, Holmes brought up his free hand and traced his index finger along my jaw. It was so intimate and tender a touch I could hardly recognise the man who touched me. I’m ashamed to say I blushed and looked away as though the sight and sensation scared me.
“I didn’t say a word.” I responded to him.
“Here.”
“It’s about Mary.”
“You, my good man. No one will be good enough for you.”
“You might not want to be too loud, Watson. I doubt you would wish to be discovered in this situation.” He warned. I nodded my head, telling him to continue. He understood, burying his hand deeper into my undergarments and stroking me through the fabric. The friction and feel of straining beneath them, as I soon was, was so heady I had forgone all other activities to surrender to it. Holmes seemed not to mind. When next I opened my eyes, having realised my lack of contribution, I was met with the sight of my friend shirtless.
“No one.” Holmes said again, “Not even me.”
I wasn’t Mary’s. I was his.
As ever, the stoic figure of Sherlock Holmes sat upon his armchair- not in it, on it, with his knees drawn to his chest and feet on the edge of the seat- finger tips pressed together in his usual position. His eyes remained closed as he spoke. He did not even turn his head towards me.
“It’s a silly idea.” I conceded.
“Watson, you are a mess of questions.” He sighed. But I ask you, what did he expect me to do? I felt more lost than I did on many of his cases, attempting to follow his thought process before he had the decency to explain it to me. I could not understand what had prompted this, nor what he was really saying to me. I confess myself at such a loss and so struck by the comment that I dropped my pen. Ink splashed on the carpet. It took me a moment before I realised what I had done, and when I had, I let out a curse as I attempted to clean it up.
I took that to mean I had to find something. Unsteadily, I stood and wandered out of the room. When I returned with some tissue and a wet cloth, he had recoiled into himself. He had somehow retrieved his dressing gown from where ever it had been, and he sat against the wall, curled up like a cat.
“As brilliant as you may think me, Watson, I cannot compare myself to you. You are deserving of better than this world has to offer. That is what I am referring to when I say that no woman, nor man, would be good enough. Not even myself.”
I would have no such luck, as Holmes reached out and tapped me on the back. I faced him with a hurt expression.
I entered Holmes’ bedroom as I had done many a time before. It was not alien to me. It was as natural and comfortable to me as my own rooms. But the pretense of my entering had me nervous. I am not ashamed to say it. I had my hands clasped together tightly to comfort myself. Holmes gestured for me to shut the door. I did so quietly. I do not know what I feared so greatly. Who was there to hear the door close, and who would think anything of it? I knew not.
Holmes’ kiss was gentle and reserved. It reminded me much of the atmosphere when he indulged in his infernal vices. It was reserved and precise, yet intense and unpredictable. I felt as though I was indulging in it too, finally joining him for a seven percent solution of cocaine. The metaphor continues, as I would never have taken such a forbidden step were it not for him.
Was all he could say, before again turning in his chair, closing his eyes once more, and falling back into the depths of his mind, as though that was the end of the conversation.
“No!” He tries again because God knows he’ll need that drink when he comes out. “No, I took some medicine. It’ll settle me in a few minutes.”
Sherlock said nothing, didn’t open his eyes. He swiped a few motions on the phone. John heard Lestrade’s outgoing voicemail message then Sherlock spoke.
He was typing out 'I'm sorry forget it' when the dots appeared again.
John takes a gulp, and stands.
John waits until everyone is busy giving best wishes to the bride and congratulating the groom to pull Sherlock to the side and tell him how incredibly sexy he looks in that suit and how he wants to do things to Sherlock while wearing it.
Then Rosie stirred some more. Sherlock seemed to take note of this, his head nodded towards her.
“Where is it?”
“It’s always been a goal of mine to explore the most compli-.”
Five years gone and John gets a call from a publisher in New York. They want to turn his blog into a book. He agrees and spends the next few months picking out his and Sherlock's favorite cases. In bed one night he muses to Sherlock about which case to end the book with.
