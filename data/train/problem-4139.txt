“You don't get a say at all?”
Cas spends his life in the warmth of sheets and blankets and the love of family, and he wants to be angry, wants to be jealous of all that Cas has that he doesn’t but, then he remembers who he is, sees the trouble he’s been through and knows that Cas wouldn’t ever deserve a life where he knew what the floor felt like as it dipped below the weight of a patron walking past a little too close to the sleeping forms littering the floor, didn’t deserve to worry if his face was covered enough as to not assuage suspicion but to ensure someone wouldn’t deem his pretty face one that was theirs to try to claim. He certainly doesn’t deserve the bloody knuckles that result from such an experience.
“I have complete faith that you would step in to help and we aren't expecting anything to go wrong in our absence but it's always best to be prepared,” Cas says as they walk up to the bag with the slates, he pauses and looks at his hands. “Is that what the scars are from?”
“Not particularly, no,” he says in response before turning his focus to his ma. “Should I start on the burn Ma?” Cas isn't rewarded with a verbal response, his ma too absorbed in inspecting Dean’s leg to do anything more than nod.
The look he gets in response is more cloaked than any Dean has given him yet. The way his face morphs is beyond Castiel’s comprehension.
Alfie, it seems, isn't as interested in saying hello because he hides behind Castiel's legs. It makes perfect sense; Alfie wasn’t yet five when Gabriel left for good after the wedding and had been only three when he and Kali had met so he has very few memories of his older brother and even fewer of Kali.
“I’m not sure if it’s my happiest, but uh, it’s kind of a two in one memory even though the two things happened a few weeks apart. When Alife, my youngest brother, was born I was about fourteen or so, I had already helped so much with Anna, Duma and Uriel when they came home with my parents from the orphanage. I tried to help with Alfie whenever I could, I was the one that was holding his hands the day he started walking, a few weeks later he had learned my name, though it resembled ‘Cas-e-lel’ more than Castiel, and he came waddling over saying it as loud as anything. My younger siblings hardly see me as a brother because of how great our age disparities are, and I don’t know if that makes them more affectionate or what but just about everything about them makes me happy.”
One of the most powerful celestial forces in the universe. And they have no way of getting any. Michael has ignored their pleas for weeks, no way is he going to come now that they want to remove some of his grace from him.
“Is this better?” Cas questions after Dean has stopped manipulating his body for several seconds while he tried to get himself in control. It escapes his notice just how rough Cas’ voice is, and how shaky his breathing is.
He pokes his head into Hannah's room on his way back through the house and smiles at her when she looks up. He walks in and drops a kiss on her forehead, feeling the burning heat of her skin and promises that he’ll spend some time reading with her tomorrow if not later tonight.
I tried my best to give an explanation about the whole after-effects of killing the planet and needing some time to set that right. If I did a terrible job I would just like to say that if Marvel and spn can do it so can I?
He reaches forward to the bottom of Cas’ shirt and lifts it up more quickly than Cas had done so with his. Still with each new inch of skin exposed his breathing becomes shorter and shorter. It’s nothing he hasn't seen already but now, now he can spend time looking, storing every detail for later, for
“Hmm I disagree,” Cas throws back with plain expression.
Castiel isn’t stupid, if he sees an out, he’s going to take it. Lying now means that his father won't think twice about him and Dean and what Castiel’s earlier insolence could have meant. “Yes, Pa, I just wanted to make sure that the farm would be okay if I were to go, with the assurance you gave me it’s made it far easier to come to the decision to leave in good conscience. I love you both,” he’s not sure why those words taste like a lie. “I know you want what's best for me, this is how I get that.”
So I know chapter three showed a busy household but I said crank that up to eleven and add more than double the number of people because who doesn't love some chaos?!
Both Benny and Jo make an appearance, the former to ask about his work and see if he wants something from the kitchen—a play to see if Dean’s in need of a distraction to switch the subject—the latter to see if a rescue is needed from her step-father.
The difference between how Cas had acted when he and Dean were alone versus around his father was almost night and day. Dean wasn’t going to lie to himself, he liked the Cas he knows privately a lot more than the one he is forced to know publicly.
“Jesus dude why the hell are you up?” Dean asked hand to his chest, a tad bit more dramatic than what was necessary. He sidestepped his double and headed to the fridge.
There's something extremely fond in Castiel’s gaze when their eyes meet on the walk back, and even more fond when they’re in the stable away from the eyes of his family. He keeps reminding Cas that he has to go back or one of his siblings may come running over to share with Dean the fact that they can ‘add three and four together no problem’ but Cas seems intent on keeping them pressed up against the wall, so close that a shallow breath couldn’t be taken without their chests touching. It might take Cas another ten minutes before he’s leaving the stables but no children coming running up wanting to share anything thankfully.
“Castiel, I didn’t expect to see you here,” Jody says, and while it's not phrased like a question, there's no doubt in any of their minds that she expects an answer.
They trade kisses because Castiel can’t help himself. He’s been selfless enough today—the past few days—and now he wants to be greedy. He wants to take all that he can, so he does.
oh fuck,
He flinched when a warm calloused hand reached for him, not from fear of rejection but because of how exposed he was, his body felt as though his nerve endings were open to the will of the earth, and it felt like everything was more intense it felt like he was more vulnerable. He could do nothing but stare as Cas took his hand and lifted it gently to his mouth. His lungs burned as they were knocked empty by the shock, the want, the fear he felt at having this.
Castiel begins tracing out the letters, making them as clear as he can, it’s more difficult than he expected as he only writes cursive, not print. As they work through the alphabet, he sings the song his mother taught him when he was a child. Castiel can tell that he is struggling with the rote nature that is expected with learning the alphabet, as an adult who has knowledge of the language much greater than a four year old, he doesn't doubt that this is especially dull work.
They take their time as they eat and he remembers his thoughts from earlier and figures now’s as good a time as any to see if he can get some clarity.
, shit I can’t wait to see you come for me, but not like this,” he says. Dean reaches down and pushes his own pants off of his hips desperate for actual contact with Cas’ length.
“Uh, Jack, we don’t incinerate our friends, okay?” Dean said as he scooped Jack up.
Cas was right. They deserved this, and it was long overdue. Dean smiled and nodded in agreement. He then pulled Cas back down to him. All the fears and hesitations Dean had earlier that day melted away with every kiss. This was it. They were finally able to be happy in the having and Dean was so ready to have it all with Cas.
"Yeah, sure, that works for me." Dean shrugged, trying to keep his cool.
"Can I ask you a question?" Cas’s eyes looked a deeper blue than ever as he turned to Dean.
And that’s how the 1st Annual Winchester Ping Pong Tournament was born. Cas figured in order to end this whole thing, they had to go out with a bang. If all went well, everyone would get their fill of ping pong and then Dean and Cas wouldn’t have to deal with them until the following year at the 2nd Annual Winchester Ping Pong Tournament.
Dean wiped his eyes and succumbed to the fact that he couldn’t just pretend to go back sleep now. “What is it, Cas?”
Cas stared at the car in the driveway. “Looks like my mom hasn’t left for work yet. She’s, uh, very friendly, just warning you,” Cas grimaced as he opened the front door.
Dean thought in protest. As much as he knew both he and Cas probably wanted it, he figured they needed to take it slow.
"Let's get cracking!" Jack said, pointing to the egg carton. This was his favorite part - and also his new catchphrase. Cas cringed a little as Jack went to smash the first egg on the counter.
"Well, I'll see you then! Or actually I'll see you in class a bunch before then...you know what I mean." Cas started to walk back towards the school.
"I sometimes draw you," Cas confessed. Dean's eyes widened and he sensed his pulse start to race. “I just felt like since we’re kind of friends now, that you should know. That’s why I look at you in class,” he whispered, embarrassed.
"Sure, Dean, I'd love that," Cas said with a smile. He could sense Dean's tension, but also understood the position they were currently in. To finally give in and have what they both wanted for so long seemed daunting and a bit undeserving. That is, given if Dean even felt the same way.
on his own,” Cas whispered back, looking over Dean’s shoulder at Jack who was humming to himself while scribbling on the sheet of his clipboard.
” Cas’s voice got even deeper at the last word.
Cas closed the small gap between them and brushed his nose against Dean's. "Hey."
“So, this holiday is to celebrate the mathematical constant of pi, but everyone just eats pie instead of discussing mathematics?” Cas questioned as the group arrived at the town’s Pi Day Festival.
“Pie is way more fun than math, so they took advantage of the words sounding alike,” Dean explained, beelining to the display table.
“Yeah?”
After about an hour, Dean was getting exhausted. “Man, I don’t know how they expect us to be in school all day and then think like this afterwards too.”
“Yeah, yeah, it’s coming kid,” Dean said as he started filling a plate with the plastic food. He was already feeling the pressure from being behind the tiny stove with the critic watching. The health inspector was definitely going to get called on him.
“I’m back! Can I come in now?” Dean inquired. He heard Cas yell back a “Yes”, so Dean slowly opened the door, anticipating a bunch of kittens running at him and making him sneeze.
“I’m sick of being host every night to all these people using our house as a ping pong club! I wish they could all just come one day, play, and then never come back again,” Dean whined, leaning in for a pouty kiss.
“Yeah, it feels really nice, Cas. Um, thank you.” Dean closed his eyes and stayed still, feeling the softness run through his hair and through his body. He knew what he wanted to say then, and he hoped he could get it out right.
“So, you said you had some notes?” Dean asked, trying to transition from him staring at all of Cas’s belongings.
“The food critic is waiting!” Jack announced, tapping the invisible watch on his wrist.
Dean was speechless. All those times Cas caught his eye and scribbled in his notebook, he was drawing Dean?
Sam pursed his lips, wishing he wasn’t dragged along to this. Eileen unfortunately likes pie almost as much as Dean, so here they were on this double-date since Jack chose to hang out with Claire instead.
, Dean thought. There was no avoiding him now. He made his way slowly towards Cas, running through a million different things to say.
"Well, um, that's good," Dean replied weakly, still processing the wink.
Dean then took another scoop of the peas and held it in front of Jack again. Jack happily cooed and leaned forward with a wide mouth. He ate spoonful after spoonful until the jar was empty. Dean fed him in shock as Cas leaned against the counter watching his two loves.
“That sounds good, Cas, thanks.” Dean still couldn’t believe this was even happening.
“You know, there are two more alternative dates for Pi Day…” Eileen said, giving Dean a smile as he looked up wide-eyed from his plate. “I’m serious!” She put her hands up in defense at the incredulous looks she received from Sam and Cas.
“Shush, let him finish his spiel,” Dean said, waving Cas off. He admittedly was also already sold, given the effort the kid put into this, but we wanted to hear the rest anyway.
"That poor dog is never going to find his treats," Dean laughed, wrapping an arm around Cas's waist and giving him a kiss on the cheek. The two smiled as they watched Jack show Miracle all the candy he got. Looks like they did pretty well for their first Easter.
“Yeah, maybe,” Dean said, fiddling with his keys.
Cas went over and gave Jack a kiss on the forehead and then stood in front of Dean, who still had a look of disbelief.
Dean groaned, sitting up to look back at Cas who was still squinting at him. “This is what you were staring at me until I woke up for? I thought I did something wrong,” Dean huffed, still groggy.
After all this time feeling relaxed, Dean started to tense up again. “Um, no, I'm not sure if that's really for me..." Dean trailed off. To be honest, he barely thought about it. His dad didn’t go, and it seemed like something his little brother Sammy would do instead of him.
"Um, so the reason I'm stalking you is because we got our assignment today," Cas said holding up the paper. "The book is due on the 12th, so do you want to get together the Friday before? You can come by my house after school since you drive. I'd love to ride home in something other than the bus for a change," Cas laughed again.
“Dean, that’s your child too, you know. It’s your turn to play chef in that tiny plastic kitchen,” Cas said as he thrusted a miniature spatula at Dean.
“I’ll go grab some more beer and I better not get the door shut in my face when I come back.” Dean rolled his eyes and headed to the kitchen. He couldn’t imagine what Cas and Jack were getting up to in there, but he had a suspicion it had something to do with the cat.
As he continued to wait, Dean reflected a bit on the last decade. There were so many deaths, sacrifices, and regrets, but Cas stayed with him through it all. He truly was Dean's best friend, and Dean was going to marry him in only a few minutes.
“Alright idjits, I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may kiss the groom!” Bobby announced, also with a couple tears.
view too."
Dean and Cas were happy Jack was having such a great time, but they were also exhausted from all the actual ping pong they were playing. There wasn’t much time or privacy for their version of ping pong anymore.
“No, Dean, you did nothing wrong. But I think it is important that we discuss getting a cat.” Cas was crossed-legged on the bed now, looking very serious, but very cute.
But Cas didn't respond. Dean turned to take a peek at him. Cas was sitting with his knees to his chest, staring forward at his clasped hands. Finally, he took a deep breath and turned back at Dean.
Cas looked at Jack and winked. The two started laughing, much to Dean's confusion.
, he thought.
“I got curious on the car ride over here,” Eileen shrugged innocently. Sam shook his head, but then kissed her forehead.
“There’s one of the Batman movies,” Cas pointed at the screen. “You like that, right? I don’t think I’ve seen it yet.”
"We can do it again next Easter, but maybe tomorrow you can hide some treats for Miracle and he can go hunting like you did today," Cas suggested.
After a quick lunch, Dean started to go look for the pair. He checked all over. He went to Jack’s room, the library, the garage, even the dungeon, and still couldn’t find them. The cars were all in the garage, so he knew they hadn’t left, but where were they? After pacing around some more, Dean finally gave up and decided to head down to the Dean cave and relax with a beer and some Dr. Sexy. He knew they would turn up eventually. They clearly wanted to stay hidden for now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean passed him off to Cas as they walked out of the room. “Well, maybe we should bring him along on the next hunt if that’s what he does to things we call monsters,” Dean chuckled and then quickly stopped as he caught the glare Cas gave him.
Maybe Dean had a little crush on the quiet smart kid - so what. It wasn't like anything would come of it. The guy had tons of friends who were girls and probably made out with them during study sessions. Also, no one knew Dean liked guys anyway, well, except for his best friend Charlie, but she would never tell a soul.
"How'd it go, you two?" Dean asked as he took a bite of a cookie.
After Cas gave an update on Jack, they all went to their separate rooms. Dean just sat on his bed, thinking. He quickly realized that with Cas back, all he wanted to do was spend time with him. He was his best friend after all. After some more agonizing minutes of stress, Dean mustered up the courage to finally suggest spending time with Cas. He flopped back in his bed, groaned, and then got back up to make his way to Cas's room.
"Oh, um, I just look around the room a lot because I get bored and I think we just, uh, happen to look at each other at the same time," Dean answered as he rubbed his neck way too much. He looked up at the ceiling wishing Cas would just take that as an acceptable answer.
"Don't worry about us. How can two angels get into trouble?" Cas winked and poked Jack's belly, making him giggle.
"Yes, Jack, now cookies." Cas put Jack down and grabbed their matching aprons. Cas had one with the words
“I’m sorry Dean, I didn’t mean to alarm you. You fell asleep and your face almost fell into the popcorn, so I figured this would be a more comfortable place,” Cas explained, motioning to his blanketed lap. Dean felt bad about how guilty Cas sounded. The truth was, Dean hadn’t felt that comfortable or been touched like that in a very long time.
“Good morning, Jack!” Cas kissed their toddler on the head. Dean turned to check his phone and found a text from Sam that said:
difficult. Though, he was definitely going to have to get Jack on his side soon, because he wouldn't survive a lifetime of being ganged up on by his two angels.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!” Jack exclaimed.
chef, not shoe. But yes, you're daddy's best helper," Cas laughed. He put Jack on his stool so he was looking over the counter. "I already have butter in the bowl, so now we put in the flour. Here's the measuring cup. Two scoops."
“Cas, this whole thing is getting out of hand,” Dean complained one night after Claire and Kaia finally left. They played Jack for three hours straight and made Dean and Cas referee once it started getting competitive.
Dean hummed and climbed over onto Cas, straddling him. “I guess keeping the kid busy would give us some more time for other things,” he trailed off, going in for a deep kiss. Cas reciprocated, but then moved to push Dean off.
"All I have to say is that it looks like I was right about using positive language,” Cas said matter-of-factly as he put Jack in his high chair. He laughed as Dean sighed in defeat and gave him a kiss.
"I'm a cookie shoe chef!" Jack proudly yelled while chewing. That was a habit he definitely picked up from Dean.
Cas placed a bowl on the counter and turned to preheat the oven. He heard two sets of footsteps quickly coming near him in the kitchen.
Dean was a bit shocked to hear that quiet Cas actually said something to them. “Nah, it's alright. I mean thank you for standing up for me, but it's fine. I got thick skin,” he replied, trying to sound like it wasn’t a big deal, even though it totally was.
"Oops." Jack turned to Cas looking like he was either going to laugh or cry, depending on how Cas reacted.
Dean and Cas exchanged knowing looks and this time, Dean gave Cas’s hand a squeeze.
"Mm?"
"Hey!” he said with his hands on his knees and blue eyes looking up to meet Dean’s. “I just wanted to let you know that I told them off – my friends. I can see you're trying and that's all that matters. I'm sorry they keep acting like jerks."
“How are my two little chefs?” Dean asked, leaning against the doorframe of the living room. He laughed as Cas flipped him off from behind the play kitchen set. Jack was sitting at the chair waving to Dean and thankfully facing away from Cas’s rude gesture.
Dean then begrudgingly got up and put his arm out in front of Cas. “Hey, stop. I’ll take care of it and I’ll do it nicely, so Jack sees that I care about the living things too.”
Cas tilted his head to touch Dean’s and sighed. “Very much so.”
Dean stepped up and turned to face Cas. The two exchanged teary-eyed looks of love. Bobby cleared his throat and began the officiant’s speech. He was proud of himself for passing his online test for officiating weddings, even though this wasn’t even a real wedding. “We want it to be as real as we can get it, son,” Bobby had said while printing his little certificate.
"You already did," Dean lightly smirked.
Dean felt his face get hot.
Even though Dean didn’t really celebrate Easter, he and Cas decided to do it this year for Jack. The kid deserved to have some fun and have another excuse to eat a bunch of candy.
pizza? I should come over here more often.”
“Cas, what the hell?” Dean became very flustered and suddenly jealous of
Dean raised his eyebrows at Cas and Cas just smiled and shrugged. Their kid was no doubt a fun little handful.
“Wow kid, I guess you did your research. That was a hell of a presentation!” Dean chuckled.
"Hi Cas, I haven't picked out a movie yet-" Dean stopped talking as he turned to look at Cas. His mouth opened a bit in surprise as he took in the sight in front of him. Cas was wearing one of Dean's Led Zeppelin shirts and his hot dog pajama pants.
"Cas, that's going to be one of the easier ones for him," Dean replied, putting another egg inside a box of Cookie Crunch.
“Hey, wanna go play some ping pong?” Cas would ask after dinner, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
Thanks for reading!
"Yeah, on a hunt." Dean pointed out. "I mean here, on vacation. Just us - no monsters or demons or other angels. An actual vacation like normal people.".
As the weather turned colder and the semester went on, Dean continued to steal glances at Cas and also continued to make a fool of himself. Though, he was proud of the one day he managed to successfully explain some thematic elements from Cat's Cradle to the surprise of himself, the teacher, and the rest of the class. A second win that day was the smile Cas had given him from across the room.
The guests left happy and saying that they couldn’t wait until next year’s tournament. Jack told Cas and Dean that he wouldn’t start training for next year for a while because “even champions need a break”. The two of them sighed in relief as their plan actually worked.
(See the end of the chapter for
He would’ve kissed Cas right in that moment, but he knew Bobby would have been pissed at him for wrecking the order. Dean then slipped Cas’s silver ring on his finger. Carved on it was enochian for
"No, no, everything's good. It’s just…I can’t believe you are actually wearing my clothes.” Dean rubbed his hand over his face, hiding a smile behind it.
“Enjoying the view?”
“Hey!” Eileen said after she finished her slice. “Happy one month anniversary!” She twisted two hooked fingers up in the air to sign
home…from school,” she replied. Seeing Cas’s glare, she quickly gathered her bag, coat, and keys. “Well, I have to go to the hospital now. Have fun you two!”
Cas checked his watch and then shot Dean another smile. “Well, I’m glad you’re interested! When we get the reading schedule for the next book, we can figure out a time to get together.”
“And why is this?” Dean wasn’t totally against the idea of a cat, but he also wasn’t sure why right now was the moment to deliberate this. He at least needed some coffee first.
There was a minute of silence, then footsteps, and finally Cas opened the door. He looked tired but lit up upon seeing Dean's small smile.
Cas laughed, got off the bed, and sat down on the floor next to Dean. “Tell me about it. I’m so looking forward to next year when we barely have to be in classes and just get to do work on our own time. What are your plans after school? Have you applied to any colleges yet?"
, Dean thought as he made his return to the Dean Cave.
Jack walked up to his dads and handed Cas the clipboard. There were no legible words on it but drawn at the bottom were three little stars. “You passed this time! I’m going to sit down again, and you can bring me some more food,” Jack stated as he marched back to his seat. Dean patted Cas on the back in congratulations, and pity.
It had been almost a week since Cas returned from the Empty. Sam and Dean greeted him with open arms, but an unspoken reciprocation lingered in Dean's embrace. He needed to tell Cas how he felt, especially after everything Cas had been through. But he couldn't bring himself to do it, not yet, and especially not with Sam around. He needed some more time to process.
he thought.
The two parted slightly. Their breathing was heavy, and pulses were racing. Dean never felt this way about a kiss before, especially one that was so PG. “Cas is this al-“ Dean started ask, but suddenly Cas crashed his lips back on Dean’s.
The tournament was a great success. Everyone had a blast eating, drinking, and playing round after round after round. The final match ended up being between Claire and Jack, who were also the two that played the most over the last few weeks. Finally, Claire missed the ball and gave Jack the win, suspiciously at the same time Cas coughed. Dean would ask him about it later.
“Well first, you should be quieter, because we’re in the library.” Charlie rolled her eyes but put her hand comfortingly on Dean’s back. “And second, you should go talk to him instead of hiding in here with me.”
“Of course, Dean. I’ll make sure Jack does his research.” Cas leaned over and gave Dean a quick kiss and smiled. “I’m glad to hear you’re not completely against this. I really think this will make Jack happy and it will be another activity to keep him busy.”
He sometimes wished he could be friends with Cas. The guy seemed nice, but he was also one of the smart ones - the group who looked down at Dean. They would likely give Cas a "B" for just talking to an idiot like him.
to say that you aren’t all that and that you’re much better. But, now that you're whining, maybe I'll take it back,” Cas explained cheekily as he went to lay down next to Dean.
"Thought I'd be dead already?" Dean laughed, but also speaking a little too much truth.
Cas's bedroom was neat, but full of things - books, action figures, posters of space, and even a little statue of an angel on his desk. Cas tossed his backpack on the floor and then stood nervously in the middle of the room as he watched Dean look around.
At 7:45, Dean changed into a t-shirt and pajama bottoms and headed to the kitchen to grab the aforementioned beers and popcorn. Was he panicking?
“Dean, I think we’ve been taking it slow long enough, don’t you? We have the rest of our lives to talk. Right now, all I want is
As soon as the bell rang, Dean hustled out of the room. His heart was beating fast and he knew his cheeks were still red. He didn’t know if he felt angry or embarrassed, or angry that he felt embarrassed. All Dean knew was that he needed to just go home, put on his headphones, and zone out.
Cas’s cheeks turned pink. “I said, would you like to go over the next book with me?”
It's finally time for Dean to hang out with Cas. He's nervous, but maybe Cas is too for his own reasons.
He was just about to open the Impala’s door when he heard his name. Looking around a couple times, he finally noticed Cas jogging over to him waving his arm.
"Well lucky you, because I do love you and now you're stuck with me." Dean poked Cas's tattoo when he said 'stuck', which just so happened to be his ticklish spot. Leave it to Dean to trade the mushy for annoying.
“Is that…?” Dean asked, blinking up at Cas.
Thankfully, the Dean Cave was empty when he arrived, so Dean had time to set everything up. He recently found a couch at a thrift shop, so now in between the two recliners was an old loveseat.
“Maybe you should,” Cas winked, leaving Dean in his room, grinning in disbelief. Maybe English class wasn’t as bad as he thought.
“Yeah, and he smiled too…” Dean reflected, thinking about the cute smile Cas had given him while holding up the paper. But Dean was an idiot and bolted out of the room once the bell rang, because he was scared. Of what, though? His crush? He shook his head. “I guess it’s safe to go to my car now. He usually takes the bus so he should be long gone.”
Of course, once you get a win, you also get a loss. A couple weeks later the class finished a Dickens novel, which had taken a toll on Dean’s mind. He preferred modern books with more relatable concepts and themes. It was difficult to relate to rich English people. The teacher was leading a discussion on the novel and, of course, picked on Dean to answer the toughest question. Feeling all eyes on him again, Dean began to ramble a response, trying to remember the characters’ names and plot lines. He mixed up two of the characters and that’s when the laughing began. That group - Cas’s group - and a few other kids in the class were huddling their heads, looking over and giggling at Dean. He finished the answer and the teacher moved on, but many in the class still turned to him and had smirks on their faces.
“It’s looking a little too hungrily at Jack, maybe we should get rid of it,” Cas reasoned, his parenting instincts now kicking in.
“Dean, are you sure?” Cas clearly didn’t want Dean to be saying this just because of his confession.
"I'm weady daddy!" Jack squealed as he raced into the room.
“Yes, Cas, positive.” Dean then leaned in and gave Cas a kiss. It was hesitant and light, but everything Dean could have ever wanted.
The TV suddenly lit up with a PowerPoint slide that had the title, WHY WE SHOULD GET A CAT. Jack had chosen a rainbow theme with little cat pictures all around the words. Dean shook his head. He couldn’t believe the kid actually made a PowerPoint for this cat. He definitely tried to hide the smile that was trying to break through.
“You said he turned to you when the schedule got handed out though, didn’t you?” Charlie asked half-heartedly. They had been through this several times in the last thirty minutes and she had homework to get done.
Cas got up and grabbed his notebook from the bed. “Do you want to see them? The drawings? They’re not much, but-“ Cas flipped to the back and turned the book to face Dean.
Dean crossed his arms and glanced over at Jack who was now waving at the spider. “Mmhm well what does it say about talking about actual monsters. I mean we’re going to have to tell him eventually,” he challenged, raising his eyebrows.
“But not as good as the view behind you, am I right?” Dean winked even though he knew Cas couldn't see his face.
“I live on Seraph Street, south of downtown,” Cas revealed as they pulled out of the school lot.
"Thank you, Dean. Now that wasn't too hard, was it?" Cas was enjoying this too much and Dean was going to make him pay for it later that night.
. “Alright, alright, I won’t come in. But you better not be messing with anything in there!” Dean said through the door.
“Don’t apologize. Do that again. Please.” Dean whispered the last word as he turned his head back towards the movie. It was near the end, so he must’ve been sleeping for at least an hour.
"Daddy's going to have to eat the food isn't he, Jack?" Cas said mockingly to Jack in his baby voice. He gave Dean a side glance and smirked as Dean huffed in defeat and grabbed another spoon.
Cas broke out into laughter and then Jack joined him, clapping his hands together.
"You would?" Dean asked, shuffling his feet and feeling like a damn giddy schoolgirl.
Then, things took a bit of a turn for the worse when the two started discussing the origins of the holiday and Cas casually mentioned how good Jesus looked when he rose.
and their family. Dean and Cas joined hands and headed back up the aisle, waving to everyone along the way, ready to face both the afterparty and the rest of their lives, together.
“I was just being funny, Cas,” Dean groaned, letting go of Cas and shuffling over to flop on their bed.
Dean picked up a couple extra tables at a thrift store while Cas painted a banner. If they were going to do this, they were going to do it right. Jack handled the guest list and then he and Cas made a round-robin chart with everyone’s names.
It was amusing, until Jack overheard them talking about going for “another round of ping pong” and sadly asked if they were playing without him.
"Jack did an excellent job baking, didn't you?" Cas said, giving Jack a kiss on the cheek.
“Yeah, yeah, they’re all God’s creations”. Dean rolled his eyes. “Jack, the spider is our friend,” he called over to their baby who looked back at him, smiling.
“Yeah.” Dean assured, smiling.
"In Maine? We've been here before," Cas replied, squinting in confusion.

“He’s brutal!” Dean laughed.
"Yeah, but too bad you're slow-" Dean started to say as he launched at Cas, but Cas quickly pinned him down, proving Dean's statement wrong.
Cas helped with the planning of course, but he was more than happy to watch Dean delve into the details. “You clearly have a vision for this whole thing and I’m just content to do anything by your side,” Cas had said. His only requests were that he got to choose his own outfit and procure Dean’s wedding band.
They continued to stare at each other for another moment and then Dean gave Cas's doorframe a tap with his hand. "See you at the Dean Cave at 8 o'clock, then. I'll bring the beers and the popcorn." Before Cas could say anything else, Dean made his way back to his room to freak out a little more for a couple of hours.
Jack sat in the middle of the room surrounded by the remains of the plastic eggs and way too many chocolate wrappers.
He still hadn't picked a movie, but he knew he wanted something not obviously romantic but also not a total horror and violence flick - they experienced enough of that for a few lifetimes. Dean scrolled through the Netflix and after a minute, he heard Cas come in.
"Fine. Look." Dean filled the spoon and stuck it right in his mouth. "Mm so good…" Dean grimaced at Jack. He had a tough time swallowing it, but down it went. "Jack, you better eat the food now," he said, pointing a finger at the baby.
, Dean thought as he tossed a couple blankets on the couch and placed the popcorn and drinks on the table.
"Thanks, Sammy. Let's do this," said Dean. Sam pushed open the door and he and Dean walked through it. The two strode side by side down the aisle. Dean saw all his found family around, beaming at him. He took notice of a few key guests - Garth, Charlie, Jodie and the girls, Eileen, and even Rowena. Then, he glanced up the platform and sucked in a quick breath. There was Cas smiling with silent tears running down his face. He looked beautiful in a navy suit and a matching bee tie. But hell, he could have been naked and covered with bees and Dean would've still wanted to meet him at the end of the aisle.
he was. School was just not the place where he could prove it. There were all the tests, the homework, and the paying attention for 6 hours a day. It was overwhelming. Even though he enjoyed reading, Dean hated English class the most. He read the books, but when it came time to articulate what he was thinking about them, he froze. Kids in class snickered as he rambled answers to the teacher.
It all started with the night Dean and Cas got a little too drunk and they ended up doing it on their neglected ping pong table. After that, “ping pong” became a joke codeword for sex.
Dean was outside the doors of the venue now, just waiting for Sam to tell him that Cas had taken his place at the platform. It was odd to not have seen Cas yet today, but traditions were traditions. They had decided Dean was the one who was going to walk down the aisle with Sam escorting him. Cas explained that it was representative to how he had existed for so long before Dean came into his life and changed it forever.
At least once a class, Cas would turn to look at him at unfortunately the same moment he happened to be looking at Cas. Dean would quickly bury his head down, feeling the heat rise up his neck. When he was brave enough to take a peek at Cas again, he would notice a faint smile as Cas turned back to his doodling.
, Dean thought,
Cas then stood up and headed to the door. “How about I call in that pizza?”
“No problem. I may need a new friend anyway.” Cas looked behind him at the busses filling up with students. “OK I really have to catch the bus now, but have a good weekend!” he said waving again as he ran over to the bus that was about to leave.
Dean kneeled down to be eye-level with Jack. The little baby was cooing and dribbling, but also staring right back at Dean as if he was challenging him.
Jack stared back at Dean and nodded like he understood. But, then he laughed and started clapping again, so the message probably didn’t stick.
Then, Jodie, Donna, and the girls started coming over to play. Even Garth got wind of it and came down for Dean’s famous burgers and some rounds of “whiff-whaff” (Garth insisted on using the old British name). Jack was ecstatic of course at all of the friends that were stopping by to play.
, Dean thought as he joined in with their laughter.
While the cookies baked, Cas took on the task of picking up all the chocolate chips. He let Jack off the hook to go take a quick nap because he got so sleepy his head almost fell in the bowl mid-scoop.
“You know there’s only four of us right?” Sam raised his eyebrows, looking at all the pie in front of them.
They pulled apart and looked out at the crowd clapping and cheering for them. This was the best day of Dean’s life and now he was ready to enjoy the rest of it all with his
“Really. Look man, I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, and I’ll probably regret saying this in a second, but I may have a little bit of a crush on you.” Dean couldn’t believe he said that. However, he actually felt a bit better, lighter, after saying it out loud.
on it while Jack's said
Cas titled his head at Dean, holding up his ring, and he let Cas take ahold of his hand. Cas had chosen a black band that shone in the light. As Cas slipped it on his finger, Dean noticed a tiny line of bluish silver in the middle.
Cas's hands were all over Dean's body as Dean writhed and tried not to laugh. Finally, Cas stopped and held Dean's hands down on the bed. Cas gave him a kiss and then smirked. "You know what, I really am enjoying
anymore.
Sighing deeply as he brushed away the wetness that fell, Dean wished he could find a way to avoid this conversation. Wished he could simply say she would understand when she was older – but that was another of those overused parenting lines and this one he
So Cas was coming home.
How had he gotten so lucky? How many chances had he been given to finally make it here?
Anyway! Remember: starting tomorrow, I will post five AC one-shots that are set in the future and while I know it's not ideal because Lumberjack Cookies isn't finished yet, I still hope you'll forgive me. I promised to post them in 2020 and I plan on keeping that promise 😘
in "Once Upon A Time".
And now he was here, still strumming on the steering wheel, still trying not to go insane with the need for answers.
So he wrote them down and collected them all.
Despite that, Dean was unable to keep his hands off of Cas. He was finally here, finally with him and while Dean was tired and emotionally drained – not only from the past few hours but also everything that transpired over the past few weeks – he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he fucking
Michael, honest to God, gave him a pitying look. “Dean, please. You should go after him. Talk this out!”
for his past relationship.
have a favorite. And trust me, it is nothing like Papa John’s.”
… we never got to talk about how you feel about it. And then last night– and I guess– I just wanna make sure you’re feeling… alright, I guess?”
for him, God damnit!
Dean raised an eyebrow, hoping Cas would understand that he had lost him – or rather, that Cas wasn’t making sense in the slightest. By the way he rolled his eyes, Cas seemed to easily grasp Dean’s confusion. “We only had it yesterday because I let Zar order. He knows how much I hate that pizza. Speaking of,” he added with a frown, mumbling as if talking to himself, “I’m pretty sure he only did it to get some sort of reaction out of me.”
The question was asked with a raised eyebrow but Dean didn’t let it deter him as he nodded. “If that’s the place we decide on in the future, then yes. Of course.” He was interrupted by a quick kiss but still went on, “Just… please don’t think you have to make that decision alone. I think that’s something we can – and probably should – talk about and discuss together. And we can’t forget about Gracie’s opinion in this.”
a purebred Quarter Horse. Trust me, she
They talked for well over half an hour until Dean reminded his daughter that Sam would be picking her up soon. Without much fuss, Gracie got up and waved at her aunts. “
Pulling his thoughts away from that, he focused back on his students.
It took but a few seconds for Dean to break.
Joshua ended the call and Dean had to swallow to press down his nerves and the weird little flip flop his stomach had begun once Joshua started speaking into the phone. Cas was letting him come up. He was willing to see him and from how it had sounded, he hadn’t even hesitated long.
“What does he do? Besides sit in a coffee shop with our granddaughter?” asked Harry.
. He drew a sharp breath and focused on the delicious feeling. It was never the same when he did it to himself, never as intense, and this had been unexpected and –
With his senior class, it was even easier. He simply let his students get distracted by the Christmas cookie sale they had planned for the Friday right before Christmas. If they really wanted to go to New York for their final field trip, they needed all the money they could get, hence their campaigns to raise money needed to be planned very well.
“Yes!” Gracie exclaimed, pointing to the pile she had already opened before turning back to look at him.
“Oh?” Dean replied, intrigued now. “Top five? Will you tell me about the other four?”
He needed Cas.
“CAS!”
Sighing, Dean gave in, reciting the legend the Shurley’s had told them about.
Cas’ back arched off the bed, pressing them even closer together, and his moan alone sent fire through Dean’s whole body. But it was Cas’ answer – breathy, and yet so sure, so prompt, as if he’d longed to say it for ages – that had Dean nearly lose it.
“Wanna tell us what this is about?”
They also didn’t let any man slay a poor dragon for them.
Dean was so startled by the sensation on his skin, he actually banged his head against the hood of the car he was currently working on. Quickly reaching for a pen, he scribbled back before the words in his mind even made sense.
“Thanks, pumpkin.”
“Huh?” Dean asked, dumbfounded.
“– but is this how you treat all your friends? By playing your stupid games with them–”
Dean knew he was the last student for their first shift, but before he could join the rest behind the table to sell cookies, he pulled the boy aside.
“Shit, that is so hot,” he heard Cas moan out, and he wasn’t sure what exactly Cas meant but it didn’t matter anyway.
Gracie only grinned at him. She had already told him that she’d messaged her aunties the moment she heard the good news, so Dean had been prepared for this to be the main topic during today’s call.
He had to try again, of course. “Cas, please–”
“Oh, please,” Dean scoffed. “Are you really going to pretend that’s not the case?”
Other men might not do it for him.
He smiled at how sweet she was when she added a, “Thank you,” squeezing him in a vice-like hug before adding a kiss to his cheek. Cas received the same treatment before she finally went back to her little camp.
“Yeah, well. Too bad he already up and left for New York.”
“You… you baked more Angel Cookies?”
“Let go of me, Dean. I only came here to tell you to leave me alone.”
and get on the horse, or for fuck's sake, I’ll put you there myself.”
Gracie complied, switching off the torch and putting it aside. Her nose was already back in her book before Dean had even turned around.
Instead, he made sure to change the subject.
“Oh,” Lydia answered, her smile falling again. This time completely.
Getting through his stuff at a rather great pace, it was about an hour later that Dean was able to put his pen down and enjoy the satisfying feeling of a job well done. For the moment there was nothing left to correct or prepare, so he finally allowed himself to call it a day without feeling like a crappy teacher again. After cleaning up his desk, Dean left his classroom and the school, making a beeline for the diner to pick up his daughter. He could already see her blonde mane from a few yards away, yet when he looked past her, he was completely caught off guard as he saw the man she was sitting at a table with. So caught off guard, actually, that he stopped in the middle of the street, just staring, wondering if he’d been picked up and dropped into the wrong movie.
“You like my voice?” Cas asked in wonder, sounding so surprised that Dean couldn’t suppress his laugh.
“Don’t say that, please. Something bothering you isn’t stupid, so what is it?”
No, none of this felt strange or outlandish or awkward or anything even remotely negative.
For a long time now, Dean had had the suspicion that Cas had made his way anyway, even without Dean’s help. Hearing that his last name was
he still wanted to be Dean’s friend.
Cas to know. “She looked like an angel and she told me that she wanted me to be happy again,” he finally pressed out, and he knew the smile on his lips was probably a soft one, even though he felt a familiar pang of melancholy. He always did and he probably always would when he talked about Lisa. “I mean, she mostly just smiled at me and was just
“Good,” Jo answered, returning the soft smile.
And he
“It’s just…” When she fully turned towards him, body and all, Dean knew he was in deep trouble. “I really,
Right now, he was sitting on campus as well, enjoying some lunch while reading a good book, and Dean’s eyes had wandered towards him more often than he cared to admit. Damnit!
“That would be lovely, dear,” Alice replied, but before Dean could get up himself, Harry held out his hand to stop him.
When he looked up, he was the first to notice Dean standing there, watching them. His smile, while still soft, turned a tad wider, leading Gracie to take note and turn around.
“Really?”
Dean pulled his hand away and took the flashlight from his mouth, pointing it at Cas’ shoulder. Seeing the disaster, he had to force himself to stay calm so as not to scare Cas. Once he was sure he had his voice under control, he gave Cas the verdict.
Trying to stay calm at that admission, Dean nodded, searching for the right words. “Please? He left without a word and I– I just wanna make sure he’s alright. I have no idea what’s even going on. Please, just… five minutes?”
“What? Oh– oh
explanation, really. His thoughts circled back to when exactly the change in Cas’ mood had happened. It seemed so unreasonable and weird, but-
Watching his daughter now, seeing how happy she was, the way it bubbled out of her as she bounced around the kitchen, making cookies with her Grandma... Dean knew
There was no Cas as far as he could see.
Hastily grabbing his phone and his keys and an extra pen, he hoofed it out the door and into his car. Technically, he could run to the park but that would cost him precious minutes and he would be out of breath by the time he got there. He also knew they both faced getting into trouble, the park being closed this time of night – but that thought quickly flew out of his mind and five minutes later, he parked his Chevy right next to the entrance, rushing inside.
“Okay.”
“You have his number, right?” He waited for Grace to nod before he went on. “I’m sure he would like it if you two kept in contact.” Maybe Cas had played him and maybe Dean had no right to be so sure of the truth in Cas’ fondness in regards to Gracie. But he refused to believe that Cas would be so petty as to ignore his daughter. “He gave you that script for a reason, after all. So don’t hesitate to text him.”
“It must have been amazing for her how everybody supported her,” Charlie spoke up, apparently finally calming down her crazy just a tad.
Not that he could ever be fully prepared for this conversation.
! It wasn’t as if this was the only reason Dean reacted like this. But it certainly added fuel to the fire and he needed to forcefully hold himself back to not
= amazing / incredible
“Of course,” Cas replied almost breathlessly.
Dean had to squeeze his eyes shut to fight against the pain welling up in him. How much he wished he could answer such a simple question. Technically, he
“What are you talking about?”
freak.
Inhaling slowly through his nose, Dean reflected on Harry’s question. Then he began anew.
He liked to keep tabs on some of his former students, so he knew that Miss Masters was a detective over in Hartford. But he hadn’t heard much more of her. However, before he could ask after her welfare, a more insistent shush shut them both up again. Dean pressed his lips together to keep from laughing and the look he shared with Cas left him glad to know they were both grinning at the situation, no hint of discomfort showing on Cas’ part.
. Dean would never say it out loud, but the fact that his little girl still wanted to watch these kids’ movies made him extremely happy. At two,
“Ah,” Dean replied, rolling his eyes. “What you saw was her finally annoying me enough that I told her off for good.”
Yeah, sure, the thing with Krissy and Ava
“Auntie, do we still have some Angel Cookies? I’m really craving them right now,” she explained, one hand on her belly.
His heat, his breath, his scent.
not know what people are saying about
Michael seemed to take his silence as an invitation for more awkward talk.
He cleared his throat, leaned forward, and put his mug down. Not looking at the girls, Dean chose to instead keep his gaze on his hands, loosely folded between his legs. “Jo … how … how did it …”
“Sure,” he replied, getting out of the car. “Just tired.”
“Don’t be such a baby, Winchester,” he mumbled to himself, finally selecting a video that looked promising. ‘
I have to admit, I personally love that scene in the town square even more now that we saw Dean's side as well - and all the people who were there 😁 ... how about you?
Maybe they could find a quiet moment tomorrow. Maybe… maybe if the whole cookie incident had calmed down again, they could take the time to really talk about it. Then Dean would feel out the situation and…
Max hesitated and Dean had an inkling that it was not because of the question itself but more because he had no idea how to answer. In the end, he nodded.
Here was Dean’s chance to talk with Cas some more instead of just standing around stupidly. His daughter was still busy talking to Michael, so Dean frantically searched for something to say.
There was a figure sitting on their porch swing as they got back and Dean couldn’t help but notice Gracie’s hopeful glance – only to see her shoulders slump the moment they came close enough to recognize the person in full.
“It’s fine, ladies, really.
“Technically, it’s not your decision to make,” Cas had the audacity to throw in, pissing Dean of for real.
done in his life, this! This right here – this ranked so fucking high he couldn’t even reach it anymore!
“You want to know if I feel ‘alright’?” Dean asked, a bit perplexed. He had always known that Cas was a sweet soul but he had never expected this. It took him a moment to let the impact sink in. Cas’ gaze never wavered, his eyes on him as he seemed to search for the slightest reaction on Dean’s part. “No, Cas,” he finally whispered. “I’m not ‘alright’.”
. To honor our snowman.”
Once again, there was a push against his arm. “Your daughter needs you. Go! I’ll take care of Cas.”
Cas seemed to be in this weird mix of equally not wanting to go back to reality and giddy excitement of heading back home to his family as well as Gracie.
By the feel of it, Dean suspected that there were two items wrapped up, so he put the bundle in his lap and then carefully began ripping the Christmas paper apart, uncovering indeed two items. They were wrapped again but obviously more for protection than suspense.
“But instead, you sprang away the second you heard someone call out. Like you had burned yourself; like you wouldn’t dare be caught with–”
“Welcome, all my friends of Stars Hollow,” the voice of Taylor Doose boomed through the microphone, interrupting Dean’s thoughts and making him wince before he turned his focus back towards the stage. “On this fine Friday evening, we’re opening this year’s Stars Hollow Winter Fair. I know it’s a bit earlier than previous years, but you’ll see that it will do the town good to have this here for the whole of December!”
“Nope, he didn’t. Your old man found that out all on his own.”
He was so occupied with his own thoughts, he only barely registered as Cas started to sign along while he talked to Eileen, surprising Dean. Not enough though to completely pull him out of his musings.
part!” Cas replied with a grumble, ignoring how his friends rolled their eyes. He hated when they gendered his soulmate. As if it was a given that they were a man. Cas didn’t care either way – that’s what it meant to be pan-sexual. Just because his partners had only been men so far didn’t mean gender mattered to him.
Chuck.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He is. But I’m not so sure he wants to see you.”
~*~*~*~
, Dean wanted to scream. But his vocal cords were still all jammed up. When Cas went on, Dean was sure he could see a tear make its way down his cheek.
Dean couldn’t help it, his smile only stretched further and he half-heartedly hoped his blush wasn’t all that noticeable through the screen. “Thanks, guys.”
of what he said was anything close to what he apparently told you.”
“But-”
For some reason that eluded Dean, Cas blushed as he took the phone.
Thankfully, this wasn’t a complete lie. He could have lived with waiting for a bit longer to talk about it, but this moment was probably better than most.
And now... the chapter so many of you have been waiting for 😇
“And he keeps calling you Mr. Winchester. Why does he call you that?”
[Eileen 7.56am] If you’re not calling us within the hour I’m coming over!
“Love you, too.”
Shocker.
“The more important question is,” he instead went on, “why the hell do
“Cas, what are you trying to tell me?”
Probably.
Really?
This time, it was Dean who could reply only with a nod. He wanted to comment, wanted to push, wanted to say something. Instead, he pushed himself off the doorframe and walked over to the railing, looking out over the garden. It was beautiful - he had always loved the Shurley estate - but today, he was unable to really focus on it.
Realizing that his thoughts were spinning once more, Dean dried his face and finally left the bathroom, closing the door behind him. Immediately, he heard a book being closed and put away and then the rustle of blankets. Just as he turned around the open doorway, Grace closed her eyes and lay completely still.
“Ehm … Cas.”
Soon after, Bobby told them it was time for an old man to go to bed. Since the storm was still going strong – maybe even worse than before – he also offered Dr. Richardson the guest room to which she gratefully accepted. It wasn’t the first time – and more than likely wouldn’t be the last – a late night emergency call kept her stranded at one of the ranches surrounding Stars Hollow.
The fact that he was
“I very much hope,” he began, his voice surprisingly calm as he looked up, “you’re not playing at what I think you’re are right now.”
“Yeah… but I’m not gonna date anyone, now am I?”
about what he was about to see or hear. But it seemed enough and finally, Gracie nodded and began anew.
look back around as he pushed open the door to his building and made his way inside. Leaving the strange encounter far behind him.
“Yeah, yeah,” he replied, switching on the lights in his daughter’s room. “And put away that flashlight. It’s only hurting your eyes.”
The smell of fresh snow was lying heavy in the air, mixed with the fragrances of the ranch. Dean had always thought of it as a soothing combination. The feeling of home that was associated with this place was only intensified with the clean and earthy scent the newest layer of snow had left. Breathing in this air – especially at night – was usually able to calm him down.
~ Anonymous
and then nothing but silence. Silence and the wind howling around them and their heavy panting as they breathed the same air.
Dean had always loved Stars Hollow in winter. The town was beautiful every moment of the year, but winter time simply had something magical. The snow, the fairy lights, the smells in the air, the happy chatter. It was amazing.
Jo just caught her hand and held it still. “I’m fine. She’s actually calming down a bit.”
“Sorry, man. I really don’t know what’s in that letter.”
Yet, no moment could last forever, and all too soon the smooth warmth of Cas’ skin was gone, the loss of the contact once more like a physical pain. One not even a deep breath and the fluttering of his heart was able to chase away.
Again, what a hypocrite he would be if he did that! He had no right to judge what these two had and he wouldn’t dare try.
Waking later than usual Sunday morning, Dean knew right away that it would be a good day. At least, he hoped the feeling he woke up with rang true. Aside from that, there was this sort of giddiness he felt. That shred of hope? Yeah, that had grown overnight and for once, he made the conscious decision to try and release his negative thoughts and instead bathe in that warmth, in that
“Absolutely,” Dean was quick to agree, hoping no-one would hear his accelerated heartbeat. The prospect of Cas stopping by was certainly something to look forward to. Not that he would admit that, of course. “Kids really need the money. They want a trip to New York and there’s a lot on their list they wanna see.”
Opening the passenger door for his daughter to climb in, he shortly admired the night blue Chevrolet Camaro right next to his Baby. While nothing would ever beat his classic ‘67 Chevy Impala, the newest model of this brand was certainly something to look at.
Lydia was sending Emma away before it had even happened.
“Don’t pretend like you’re not enjoying this, Winchester,” Michael replied, fixing him with a stern gaze.
His brother sighed before he started anew and somehow Dean had the feeling that he didn’t say what he’d wanted to say before.
. Dean decided to get some popcorn for all of them, not even letting himself be deterred from the long line. The movie had already started once he joined his friends again, handing one full bucket of popcorn to Gabriel and kept the other while sitting down next to Cas. Why his daughter had decided to switch places, he had no idea but he would certainly seize the opportunity.
The sound of his name on Cas’ lips made Dean’s head perk up, a slow smile tucking at his mouth as he found Cas’ deep blue eyes again.
Spanish translation:
Opening his arms, he let Emma step in to hug him. He was well aware that Gracie had mixed feelings about these two - well, honestly, not so much mixed feelings as downright not liking them - but Emma was a sweet girl who had lost her father too early. So really, when it cost nothing to give her a fatherly hug now and then, his daughter would simply have to grow up. It wasn’t as if she had to share him with Emma.
Either way, they were all perfect angels – which in itself was a bother to Dean. Usually, his class was loud, full of laughter and productive energy. Now it was just boring work and he hated to see how lackluster his students were because of it.
“What do you mean?”
Instead of replying right away, Cas’ fingers started wandering again, as if mapping out every muscle in Dean’s back. “I was so certain you were going to kiss me then.”
Dean had never known how hypnotic shadowy pattern on the roof could be in the middle of the night. Then again, he’d never before just been lying around awake, night after night, only catching some sleep here and there.
He should have gone after him.
“I also never had any trouble drawing the line between friendship and just being a teacher with any of my other students. But with you… God, Cas, I had to force myself to call you
Plus, he was glad that Cas had people looking out for him.
Within a heartbeat, he stepped back from Cas, putting space between them once more, as much as it hurt to do so. Before his thoughts had even caught up completely - before his mind could process what he was doing - he was moving for the end of the alley. All he knew was that he had to defuse whatever this old student of his might have seen. Needed to steer him away. Needed to protect Cas.
“Absolutely, Sir. I’ll send him right up.”
While Dean had been distracted by that captivating gaze, Cas had lowered himself back over Dean and for the first time, their cocks touched without thick jeans in the way and
Maybe it was all in Dean’s head, yeah. Maybe it didn’t mean a thing - mostly because Cas was with this Zar guy - but for Dean, something had changed. Nothing huge, nothing tremendous. But still,
Dean couldn’t help the little teasing note in his voice; he was currently too giddy to control it. “Yeah, I know. It was hard not to hear how you hightailed it out of the city with your Camaro.”
“Please don’t say ‘it’s not what it looks like’. You’re way too young to say that.”
19 (middle part)
In his place, another, heavier weight began to press down on Dean’s chest.
Yeah, okay, so maybe Dean had given this conversation about his feelings he absolutely didn’t want to have a bit more thought than was probably adequate.
“Dean, I assure you: it won’t sound stupid. It was a dream and it seems important to you, so it’s alright,” he reassured him, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. “And like I said, you don’t have to tell me.”
Maybe he was just sick.
“It’s all just a game to you, isn’t it?”
“Grace,” he interrupted calmly and thankfully, his daughter got it right away.
The man's hair catches his eye because, for all his composure, his hair is a mess, strands group together, sticking up as though he rakes his fingers through it several times an hour. And he’s struck with the intense desire to do just that, to learn what it feels like, but he silences the thought.
Blind determination drives him forward. Keeps him going when sleep begs to be had with every blink of his eyes. His stomach aches with no food yet churns and threatens to empty itself when fed.
Dean shakes his head fondly before catching himself and stifling off the action and the thoughts that accompany it. He shouldn't be getting fond over Cas, he shouldn't be imagining feelings and innuendos where there aren't any, simply because he wishes for something he can't have.
He works faster. He pours the antiseptic onto the wound and Cas grits his teeth in pain, moaning feebly. He rolls him and washes the exit wound. He douses a shirt in the liquid and stuffs it under Cas’ shoulder to keep it from touching the ground again. His hands shake, blood pours. He works faster.
“But why? I mean you shut me down the instant I tried to bring it up as kids.”
He doesn't get far in making a plan, getting to point number one before stopping and having to think. Hence, why he’s sitting with empty pages in front of him and far too many thoughts swirling around his head. After a few more minutes he begins to write.
“The first time I worked with a horse, her name was Temperance, thoroughbred, calm and gentile. I was working for a gin mill that also served as an inn at the time and her owner had dropped her off while he went about his business, well dropped her and his three other horses off with us. I remember the look she gave me, kind of like she could see all that was in my past and all that was in my future but she made no judgment on any of it. The man ended up staying in town for some time and he let me take her out once, not that I ever understood why he trusted me with a beast like her. But riding her even for that short while was like nothing I’d known before. Made me a sucker for animals, horses more than any other. They’re a lot easier to understand than us folks, kinder too, fewer hidden agendas and ulterior motives,” he says distractedly, lost in the memory.
“Yeah that's fine,” he pauses as Cas moves to the burn on his shoulder, the nerves in his stomach turning into something a lot less innocent when Dean hears him tsking at what he finds. “Is something wrong with my shoulder?” he asks, keeping his voice as unconcerned as he can. The last thing he needs is a fever.
He’s stunned silent, his skin blushing deeply and covering those freckles that Cas adores so much. He tries to look away, shy away from the attention but Cas doesn't let him. He cups his hands on either side of Dean’s face and manipulates his head as he pleases. Drawing it forward he lays soft, warm kisses to his forehead, down his temple, along the hill of his cheekbone, over the bridge of his nose. Tracing his way along Dean’s freckles, leaving him breathless and causing him to blush more under the intense attention Cas is giving him.
“What’s going to happen when I leave?” he asks then.
It’s quiet for a moment, his meal left forgotten on the ground for however long they've been talking, could be five minutes, could have been twenty. He picks it back up, and even though it’s gone a bit cold he starts to work on the rest of it.
“Seems a bit harsh though, I mean kids are gonna run and tussle till the day's end, you couldn’t have thought as a kid that something like that would result from playing.” The humour is gone from Dean’s voice as he makes sense of what Cas is telling him.
That night when Cas shows up with his supper he’s pulled almost immediately into a kiss, it's reckless, in a way that lights a fire in his blood, doing so almost in view of the house.
Once Jody is ready, they head over to the stables. Castiel makes a mental note to make sure the gig is moved into the equipment shed before the day’s end.
“Touch me, please Dean,” he begs, not at all caring for how desperate he sounds, not if it gets him some relief. He cries out when Dean palms him through his pants and his eyes slam shut when Dean leans in to breathe him in, just as he had done earlier. The hot wet breath seeping through the layers makes him weak at the knees. A coy smile plays at Dean’s lips when he opens his eyes again.
Before he ends this night before it’s begun, Dean forces his eyes open. Spotting the tin, he reaches for it, digging two fingers and pulling out the thick coating. His nerves pick up as he spreads it around his fingers, it’s been some time, even longer with an audience, but nothing could stop Dean as he sits up slightly on Cas chest before reaching around behind him.
“I did always wonder if I was the only one reading into that,” he replies, taking a step back to give Dean a once over, checking for any obvious evidence of what they’d just done. He motions for Dean to do the same for him and gets a hand through his hair before Dean deems him clear.
“Boy, what do you want done first, resetting your shoulder, dealing with your burn or the cut you’ve got on your leg?”
“You’re so needy for it Dean, you're just desperate for me to give you anything,” he says and Dean can’t help but groan, his name passing through those sinful lips as he inches him closer to his release is almost too much for him.
“I’d have thought that with all these scars you would be better able to avoid injury, and yet here you are with three all at once.”
Dean doesn’t say anything, he just slowly crawls towards Cas. Cas for his part turns more towards him and moves his arms, leaving a space for Dean to occupy once he’s reached Cas’ torso.
“I told my parents I’m leaving. Said goodbye to my siblings… asked Gabriel to send them my letters so that they still hear from me, I don't know if he will though, I told him not to reply until I can send him another letter.”
“I’ll start working on that now,” he replies with a nod.
“My ma and pa are heading into town the day after tomorrow for some business. Not exactly sure what it’s all about,” Cas blows out a breath, “but because of that, my presence will be needed in the house more.” Dean tries not to let his disappointment show. “However, after the kids have gone to bed, and with no parents to wonder why I'm out so late, I figured I could make my absence up to you somehow.”
They eat and pack quickly, the promise of civilization driving them.
He tries to not let the fact that Cas hadn’t shared his name with his family bother him, the title isn’t even a full day old, but it stings differently to have a name and for it not to be used.
“Dean, is that a gun?”
His hand reaches out and slips inside his bag, his fingers grip around his pistol, the metal cool and familiar in a way that never fails to turn his stomach.
“Hello there! It’s Kevin,” a voice calls from the front of the porch. Dean steps away from Cas and walks towards the man as he continues, “I’m here to take Ringer to the stables.”
He hopes that his younger siblings will fight for what they want as much as he tries to, especially his sisters. His mother would have them no sooner married off than they reach adulthood if she had her way, all to satisfy god's plan for them. Anael is already getting close, at just barely seventeen he can tell that his mother will set her sights on her soon enough.
is blue in the face.
He groans low in his chest as he feels his arousal tighten impossibly in his pelvis. Dean copies his own earlier movements and rolls his sack around his palm, caressing the crease with his fingers as Castiel uses his mouth like Dean wants him to.
Sitting up, he listens again, adrenaline pumping through his veins. He hears steady footfalls suddenly and his grip on his gun tightens. He raises it in warning to whoever is on the outside of the barn. Panic flashes through him, it makes no sense, the timing doesn’t fit at all, neither does the evidence but still he immediately thinks that he’s been found. That his time on the farm has surely endangered everyone and everything on it. He cocks the gun and waits.
“Dean, I made it a duty of mine not to inform you as to which of the farms was my own as it wouldn't be fair to the others. If it's not my property that you choose, a letter will be sent out to the owner detailing plans for your arrival and you will leave on Ringer within a week of the letter being sent. I’ll be in town for four days and by that time I’ll need you to have decided on which property you’d like to work on, if you want to take this position. I understand now that this is quite sudden and you may wish to remain here, though if Charles is looking to send you away, I would think that he doesn’t have much use for you here. Whatever you choose, it needs to be chosen before I leave. Oh, and if you choose my land, you’ll have the option of leaving whatever time you’d like as long as it’s before the end of the month,” she says with a motion to the page, it no doubt saying the same thing.
The sun paints shadows that grow long on the ground around them, casting haunting shapes that as a child had scared him more than his parents could stand. Gabriel had always been the one to calm him, only a couple of years older and yet, so protective of him. He often wonders if Gabriel had known all those years back that Castiel wasn’t like his siblings, had known that the world would be cruel to him, beat him down in more ways than one and leave him to deal with the fallout, and he, in whatever way he could, had shouldered some of the burden for him to make it easier. Had shown him love and selflessness long before the world could begin to rob him of the pretenses a child has.
Full disclosure I cried several times while writing this chapter, Cas made a huge step to be the person he wants to be, a step that wasn't easy, and maybe even one he wouldn't have had to make for years, but he made it here and he just has to see where the chips fall.
It's quiet as he watches Hannah, that kind of peaceful quiet that makes him want to close his eyes and let it surround him like a blanket. He doesn't let his eyes fall though, content to watch as his sister's breath evens out as she succumbs to sleep. It's hard to stop the tears that make their home in his eyes. The simple act of his sister being able to sleep once again in her home without the worry of her not waking in the morning causes something to break and swell in his chest.
It seems that Cas didn’t get his apparent habit of not asking a vagrant, and a stranger at that, about his past from his ma, Dean thinks as he squirms a bit at the feeling of her fingers prodding at the sides of the gash.
Sam goes a little red in the face, embarrassed by the no doubt grossly romantic scene he’s set up in his mind, “There’s a small park behind where we first met, just down from the courthouse. I was thinking that maybe I would take her there after her midwifery shift was over and propose.” He ends his plan as though it’s a question, unsure as to whether Dean is going to rib him for what he’s come up with.
“Cas is your ma tellin’ me you’ve sworn a blue streak around her before. Colour me surprised I must say.” Dean gets no response from Cas so his smile falters into non-existence and he steels himself for the relocation.
Taking a steadying breath, he lifts an arm and reaches out to tuck Cas’ elbow into his side. His chest ends up flush with Cas’ back and every point of contact seems to light up and it's all he can do not to react. Though he can do nothing for the way his breathing changes or how his mind goes a bit out of focus with the warm skin of Cas’ neck mere inches from his lips.
“I’m decent, I guess. I can hit a target from twenty yards.” He’s being modest, he knows it but Cas doesn’t have any frame of reference for marksmanship and he’s never been one to boast when not needed. His skills have won him a few bets and a few disputes in his history but Cas doesn’t need to know that.
“You said that we needed to ‘be you’ so that if Chuck checked in he wouldn't be suspicious, wouldn't that mean that he's not playing his little games anymore, at least not when he’s off killing the worlds he built just because he wants a clean slate?” Other Dean asked sincerely.
“I’m safe Dean,
The serenity that has been with them for days dissipates in seconds and, without even realizing it, his shoulders have tensed. He listens but little in the way of noise makes its way to his ears. It's as though even the animals know to hide.
… they needn’t worry, they’ve already reached salvation.
Cas sends him an unimpressed look but relents without a fight, “I got the barest glimpse of her, but I was already running late and I know how you worry.”
“You think too poorly of yourself, Dean,” he says back with no room for argument in his voice.
He hums lowly, nodding his assent at the dirt. The feeling of exposure squirms along his skin, he doesn't want Cas to come at him with sympathy and a gentle voice, he hates it, always has, when he’s treated like glass, on the cusp of breaking at all times. It rarely matters that they mean well, the second you get treated with soft voices is the second a target is put on your back. There is no difference between showing weakness and having those around you treat you as though they think you need help. At least there is no difference to those who would gladly take on a man they deemed easy pickings.
! We should get bells for you both that way I can keep my wits about me.” Anna giggles again and he can't help but think that her laugh, light, airy, and unburdened, is beautiful. “Hey, Ma! Should we get them bells so they can’t creep up on us anymore?” Uriel throws his head back laughing when the only response they get is a mumbled garble of words that in no way properly answers the question. “Just as well, I may get those bells myself if I need to, now are you both ready for supper?” Bouncing nods are all he gets as a response so he sets Anna down and releases Uriel. They take off towards the front of the house to rejoin Inias, where she’s still looking out the window. He walks to the base of the stairs and calls up to get everyone down in time for supper being served.
“I’m finding it hard to understand why I’m being asked to explain myself to my child,” he says with barely restrained anger. “When did you learn such disrespect?” his father asks rhetorically.
“Ya right, favoured by who?”
“When Chuck told us that you were the one who never listened,” he chokes out a broken laugh, “it honestly made perfect sense, you did always say that it was our story, that we were the thing that was real in a world of manufactured realities. And when he said it I swear it was like I was standing in that ratty kitchen, minutes before Lucifer rose, minutes before you di—died for the first time, listening to you say that we were making it up. And I thought as Chuck went on and on how maybe I haven't been dreaming it up all these years, maybe it wasn't Chuck’s doing, and I was going to try to talk to you about it, after a shit ton of booze mind you.” He’s quiet for a long time, the snow begins to blanket the space around him and he thinks about how he’ll never get to brush snow off of the lapel of Cas’ stupid trench coat.
“Wouldn’t be if I’d had help this morning,” Dean tosses back with a playful smile, laughing as Cas rolls his eyes yet again at his antics.
As he walks into the house, he spares another glance towards Dean but is only greeted with the man's back as he walks towards the stables. Castiel huffs a disconcerted laugh at his own intense inner monologue. Dean seems so unbothered by the distance between them lately, and he can bet that Dean is not sparing him a single thought right now, nor would he even if their roles were reversed and Castiel was the one being cold.
It's as long a shot as any they've tried to take but if there's even the smallest chance that they could get even a bit of Michael's grace they might actually be able to get Cas back.
“That isn't necessary, I’m fine to work by myself.”
Dean just gives him a look and Cas groans, “Pie really? That's what you want.”
Cas battles the fear of learning you’ve loved a person who was never fully who you thought they were. If they lied about so much can you even be sure they told the truth about loving you? Can you honestly know if your love for them was even real when for all intents and purposes you loved a person that didn’t exist? What do you do when the person who lied to you both is and isn’t standing in front of you? What do you do when bit by bit the resemblance fails because you created a portrait in your mind that sustained you for almost a century and a half but the paint you used was tinted rose, and the man you immortalized was stained with blood instead.
I made up pretty much everything to do with the spells and the rituals. Which was all kinds of fun actually.
Knowing her patience when it comes to this sort of thing isn't never ending Castiel lifts his weight off the back of his heels and stumbles with his sister into Hannah’s room.
He knew it was foolish and indicative of how screwed he was that even seeing Dean and speaking to him briefly, though the result of it seemed to tear at his heart, was enough to keep him going as the day progressed.
There's a flame inside him that was lit far too long ago but has never ceased its burning. He wouldn’t doubt that Dean feels the same, that he has this same flame in him. It was born the moment his brother got sick, grew after he died, grew again when his parents took their mourning out on him, the pain of being forced into growing up too fast, of shouldering burdens no child should have to.
He doesn't know if it's his imagination or just the fact that he’s looking at Cas more often, but nearly every time his eyes seek Cas out, Cas is looking at him. Warmth blooms in his chest as a flush takes to his cheeks each time their eyes lock. He makes himself busy to keep his mind off of it, not having the time, energy, or bravery to think on it.
“Cas, I understand you may have some questions but I need you to think about whether or not you actually want the answers to them,” Dean cautions. He’s all too aware how conversations like these go, and the last thing he wants is to scare Cas away.
Cas didn’t know how to change what music played at first, so he pressed buttons until something happened and took note of the outcomes.
“Okay Dean, first I assume you’ve picked which farm you feel most certain about. I’m going to need you to write it on this first line here. Castiel, are you able to act as witness on the contract?”
“Not here Dean, soon, but not here,” Cas soothes with a smirk.
Jack offers his own—weak as it is—for the spell, and while they think it might work given that a Nephilim holds power similar to that of an archangel, a part of Jack is already needed for the spell and they've never found a spell where doubling up on an ingredient source has worked.
“Uh… shoulder I think Ma’am.”
Cas plants his hand against Dean’s throat again and runs his thumb down the column of his neck and the bow snaps. He groans as his release hits him like a bull, shattering him, slamming into him strong enough to knock the air from his lungs and he lays there, pleasure drowning him in waves as he struggles to even breathe. His vision whites out as his brain shuts off for a few seconds.
Dean never got the chance to ask why Cas had been in the barn in the first place.
Just about anything that is looked upon fondly is fair game to be shared, the first time Cas was stung by a bee, much to Gabriel’s dismay, the first time Dean played a game for fun and not for keeps, the first time they each went swimming, the woes of being the older sibling. Dean laughs for real over and over again. Anecdotes slip from Cas’ tongue freely and he counters them as best he can, offering up stories of people he’s encountered to bridge the gaps that, even after the confessions, are still so large between them.
It takes him a moment to remember that even if Cas had been around since the Cambrian explosion in reality he’d only experienced humanity for eleven years. And all of it was spent fighting, shouldn't he get a fucking chance to just
On his ninth day on the farm, Hannah had returned feeling a far sight better than she had according to Cas. She was still on rest but she was home, and Dean could feel the farm and its occupants release a collective sigh of relief at the good news.

“Where’d you get this burn from?” she asks and Dean curses internally, in the rush of the new injuries he’d forgotten about hiding the rope lashes on his right shoulder.
He lines up for another shot, pulls the hammer into place, and makes sure Cas knows it's coming again. This one hits closer to the center, the bullet lodging itself deep in the trunk. Quickly he cocks his pistol and fires a third shot, it lands similar to the second.
The wound on his leg hadn’t been as cooperative as the other injuries, the binding on his leg hadn’t done as much as Cas and his ma had hoped to close up the wound, and it had to be sewn up. He’d only ever had something like that done to him once before. Luckily for him though the one time he’d done it had been with poor tools and as such had hurt a fair deal more than when Cas’ ma took the needle to his leg.
By mid-afternoon Castiel is sitting under a tree facing strategically away from the house with Winchester beside him. He looks nervous and unsure of how to best balance his slate in his lap. Castiel sits with a pile of books that his younger siblings have finished with and while it is optimistic, he hopes they might be able to move into reading even just a sentence before their makeshift lesson is done.
He’s thrown back for a second to the first day Cas taught him how to write, when Dean’s form was wrong, he crowded into his space to correct it. Of the touch of his fingers against the soft skin of his inner wrist and how the air had seemed to crackle when Cas got so close.
As more children arrive at breakfast the volume rises in the house, and he starts to mentally catalogue what he knows he’ll miss when he walks out the door for the last time. Anna’s smile while her mouth is still full of porridge. The way Balthazar slowly wakes up and begins to talk animatedly to Uriel. How Anael manages to sneak in bites of her own food with the chaos of a full table.
He should have known that Gabriel's arrival would cause such a commotion. He’d barely had time to fret over how he wasn’t able to take Dean his supper the previous night because Hannah was worried about her eldest siblings coming home—she barely knows Gabriel let alone Michael or Hester because of the differences in their ages; plus, after being sick and becoming the talk of the town, she was a bit nervous for the possible attention. That had meant that the last bit of time Castiel would have had with Dean prior to the arrival of his family was lost.
“I uh—I’m getting records today,” he says nervously.
So Cas has been through some shit too, I couldn't leave it all for our unnamed man to through!
Dean tries to ignore the hollow feeling in his chest until every other ingredient is collected; he refuses to allow himself to be overcome with the dashed hopes that the needs of the spell has created.
“I’ll try my best, sunshine.” A dopey smile and a fond gaze take over his paling face.
He never thought he’d find a person he would like doing this with except for Sam but dammit if Cas doesn't shatter every construct he’s ever thought into existence just by breathing.
The last thing he remembered was Chuck leaning over him, Jack far off in the background staggering to his feet, blood pouring from his head. And through his mind he replayed the fight realizing he hadn't even had time to fully reason with it, hadn't had any time to process it, not any of it, and now he was going to die as well.
Collateral damage is just part of the deal for those who may come after him. He's seen it enough times himself, shuddering against the faint sound of groaning and the transparent images of blood-stained skin. He’d be offered up like a lamb for slaughter, and he doesn't even blame the man, couldn't if he tried.
“It’s pretty straight forward work, feeding the animals, working on the horses, that kind of thing, you’ll be needing tools and such for the fence work but I want you to do that tomorrow or the day after. Today we’ll be heading to the livestock for checks.” Ahead of them is a second barn, this one more suited for housing animals than the one he’s staying in. A pen extends out from the side of it and troughs line the enclosed outside wall.
“Winchester, Si—Cas, that can be how you write me into the books,” he says half-smiling in the low light, Sam’s laugh echoing in his head as he thinks back to the sun on his neck the buzzing in his ears and the hot metal of a rifle in his hands.
He smiles as he walks into the room and sits opposite them. “I’ve done a great deal of thinking in the past weeks since my older siblings were home. Seeing them living their lives, being happy with what they had found for themselves made me realize something,” he pauses. He can see that his mother is getting excited thinking that he’s going to request a courtship. He wishes he could say he hates to disappoint her but he doesn’t. “I’m ready to start my life, my proper life. I’ve discerned that to do this, I’ll need to leave. Being here at home, I find myself too drawn into the routines that we’ve had for so many years, and to begin my adult life I need to be able to separate myself from that.” None of what he’s saying is technically a lie. It's just not the full truth either.
“What do you think marks that start if it isn't this?”
“It’s hard, especially the first few times, for you, you’ll worry about who it is that you are leaving, what ties you have that will break once the distance gets too great for the connection to withstand. You’ll fret over unfinished business and words left unsaid. But it gets easier, either you stay for shorter amounts of time or you never manage to forge the same connections with the people you meet next.”
“What’s the name, the one that means valley?” he hopes he likes it because the idea of having that type of connection to the place that his best and more cherished memories are from warms something in his chest, abating the fire that had reduced itself to embers when he saw the struggle Cas was going through.
Before he can get his arms up to fight another blow lands squarely on his face. He feels his nose crunch, breaking apart, against the strike, the sound of it replays in his head as blood streams from it. His eyes well so much and so quickly that he can do nothing to stop the third punch as it lands on his jaw.
Unlike the first time they shared the flask, in a then unknown first night celebration, Dean moves in close to catch the deep dark blue of Castiel’s eyes in the soft yellow of the room.
“Castiel, we aren't getting any younger and you are at the same age now that your older siblings started seriously thinking about courtship and starting their lives properly. We just want you to be happy, with a family and doing something good with your life.” He looks down at his plate, trying to calm himself. His mother only wants what she deems is best for him even if he’s said more times than he can count that he doesn't share the want.
Dean grasps it in his own, making sure to match the force Gabriel is using. They walk back towards the house together engaging in idle chatter, Gabriel asks where he gained the skills he uses in his work here, Dean counters with a question about Gabriel’s livelihood. It’s oddly comfortable for two people who until mere minutes ago hadn’t shared even a look between them. He doesn’t get up in arms about the questions either, quite unlike how he felt when Cas had started in on him during the first days of their budding friendship. He reasons he has Cas to thank for that.
I will be editing both when my meds are back in my body doing what they are supposed to be doing
“With how good you seemed to be at helping I can only assume you roughed up your siblings a fair bit in your youth,” Dean tries at humour and watches as it falls just shy of landing as he’d hoped, the smile that passes over Cas’ features is as fleeting as the calm of the morning before the birds wake.
“That’s right, me and Sammy found one in the brushes off a ways from town one day, when he was a kid he always liked to imagine he’d be a counsellor one day, the time we found the gun, he wanted to, and I’m speaking right from his mouth, ‘take the law into his own hands’, I had to manhandle him away from it before he picked it up and shot it.” He doesn’t mention that he went back to get the gun that same night, doesn’t mention that he used it for a time. Instead he says, “It’s the name I used on his school forms too way back when… I’d almost forgotten I’d done that.”
He understands a moment later, they don’t have time to spend on such things while they still stand on the Novak’s land.
“And now you have your answer,” his father states despite not having answered the question at all.
He’s a bit breathless as Cas lifts the flask to his mouth and takes a long pull from it, the muscles in his throat work around the liquid and heat pools in Dean's groin with the knowledge of how that skin tastes, how it feels as it works to choke out broken pleas.
A slight nod from his youngest brother has him standing and hauling him into his arms.
He loses himself in the press and glide of their lips coming together again and again, in the gripping of Cas’ fingers on the back of his neck, in the small noises that are pulled from each of their throats.
Cas raises the gun again and takes a few deep breaths, his finger plays along the barrel before it curls to rest against the trigger and Dean finds himself frozen watching it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before Cas wakes up, he heads to the clinic again and stocks up on whatever he thinks they’ll need. If the woman at the desk looks at him concernedly, he pays her no mind. He catches sight of himself in the mirror the clinic has set up, his jaw is blooming into a deep purple, bound to continue getting worse for the next few days, the cut on his cheekbone sports a bruise of its own and as he looks at his nose he curses, it’s skewed to the side and is swelling, a small bruise has made its home on his inner eye. When he attempts a smile at the clerk his jaw clicks, and he just knows this will be one of those injuries that sticks around for years.
By the time he’s eaten breakfast, supplied again by Charles, Remy is ready for travel.
His mind is so singularity focussed on Cas’ hands he hardly hears the crack of the shot. Realizing that if he doesn’t get the gun out of Cas’ hands, he’ll likely embarrass himself, he reaches for it. Cas relents and hands the pistol over to Dean, the metal warm from his hands. He doesn't have to think about his actions as he lines up a shot, it’s good, mindless and just distracting enough to take his mind from the thoughts of dragging Castiel to the ground and letting Cas have his way with him.
Team free will 2.0 was reduced to a three year old fighting against his really pissed off grandfather. A three year old who knew he’s going to lose, he may have been stronger than the angels but he’s not stronger than god. Dean knew it as well as Jack seemed to, and his only wish was that their kid would see the other side of this war.
He covers his fears as best he can. Looking at the forever hopeful eyes of his son he tries his damndest to smile for his thoughtfulness on the matter at hand. He was always a bit too good for this world.
“Oh congratulations! That’s very exciting.”
Letters started showing up about three weeks after they arrived, Sam and Gabriel at first, but then Anael and Hannah, Balthazar and Inias had letters turning up all in envelopes from Gabriel. Cas had cried when he opened a letter only to discover Hannah’s beautiful writing hidden within a note from Gabriel.
When Cas hands the flask over to him, letting their fingers slide against one another, Dean doesn't hide the shiver that wracks his frame. Cas’ eyes light up watching Dean, he makes no attempt to hide his ogling, his stare burns hotter than the whiskey in his throat.
“What about your other brothers? And your sister?” he asks as Cas joins him.
He meets Dean’s eyes in fleeting glances and there is no way to misinterpret his meaning when his gaze, though mostly directed to the ground, carries a heat he’s seen only a handful of times before.
Both of them had been panting, the action drawing their chests closer together. His eyes flicked down against his will to Cas’ lips and he snapped them up just as quickly, only to see Cas mirroring him. Time seemed as though it was suspended, the two of them crowded into each other's space for far longer than what was deemed acceptable.
He ignores the niggling in the back of his brain and the uneasiness settling in his stomach about the situation, deciding that he would have to be content with the explanation that Dean was simply getting into the habit before the arrival of his family. Castiel finds himself worrying throughout the day, regardless.
“Now that that's done, will you let me give my little brother a hug to cement this momentous occasion in his life, or are you going to work yourself into a frenzy all over again?”
It’s quiet around the farm. That kind of quiet that makes him feel out of place for making even the smallest of noises, as though the night is upset with him for disturbing the all-encompassing silence. Moonlight bathes the paths of packed earth in shades of blue and it only adds to the serenity.
Dean watches as Cas retreats to the shade with his family and something grips his heart and lungs, his whole chest feels a bit tight and without his permission, a smile spreads across his face. Just as he’s dealing with what all that can possibly mean, Cas makes it back to the group and three children hurl themselves at him. He grabs one and spins them around as a dazzling smile covers his whole face, the kind that even from a distance Dean knows shows his gums and scrunches up his nose.
“Never Hannah, in fact I think you’ll be spending so much time with them that you won’t even have time to see me at all, but I’ll still show up just so you can kick me out.” He sits down on the side of her bed. “I'm betting that Gabriel is going to try to convince you to let him and Kali sleep in here because you’ve always been his favourite.”
Castiel wishes he could say how it's never a waste to spend time with Dean, but his father apparently took their conversation last night as a sign that being around Dean was a chore and is trying to alleviate that from his plate.
It feels good to shoot again, even better now that it’s for fun.
, he thinks, is what the feeling is, and as much as he tries to ward himself against it, it never works.
Dean has to laugh a little at Gabriel's name for his brother, he can’t imagine Cas enjoys it much if he knows anything about the man. Gabriel looks slightly affronted at Dean’s reaction, no doubt assuming it was in response to his assertion of his own distaste regarding decorum.
” he knows enough to know it might be a reference to sexual pleasure but he can’t shake that something about the line draws him in, what with his death being undone when Dean brought him back.
Dean slid his pants down just past his waist, tucking the fabric below the swell of his ass and rucked his shirt up past his ribs, the memories of the night before fueled the fire that raged in his core. His body felt like it was buzzing with need. He gripped his cock, slowly stroking from base to tip as his breathing turned laboured. He imagined Cas’ hand on him instead of his own and tilted his head back with a groan as a spurt of precome released from his slit. Dean brought his hand up to his face and licked a stripe up his palm before stroking again. He imagined all the things Cas would say to him, growled into his ear while he laid there at the mercy of the man. Just that thought seemed to kick his arousal higher.
Cas flips a few pages around trying to find the good parts.
He hears a creak of a door and steady footfalls coming towards the barn. They falter as they get closer, but only for a step before they recover. He stands quickly, not wanting to offend the man before he’s gotten his food.
Honestly, he knows he would stay if Cas asked him too, perhaps it’s foolish to think that way, to be willing to give up an opportunity like this but he’s never exactly been bright.
His chest is cracked so wide every part of him falls inside, his very soul falls into the pit, tumbles down and down and down because there are a million things that he and Cas will never get to do but there are a billion things Cas will never do again.
One of the men, the shorter one, steps forward, though his companion isn’t far behind.
Dean looks up to see Cas nod, the inside of his lower lips is pulled between his teeth and he worries it as he mirrors Dean’s position on Ringers' left side.
fault. He laughs bitterly to himself, he thought he could be a good person, but here he is again, two more murders to his credit and responsible once again for someone he—someone he cares about getting hurt, almost dying. Cas has nothing to be sorry about and if he could form any words that carried any emotion, he would tell Cas that. But all he can manage is noncommittal noises and ‘rest Cas’ as they travel on.
A home that brought pain and sadness along with the joy, where his brother took his last breath, and his parents cried in their shared bedroom even after Gabriel had moved in. A home where all of his worst memories are sewn into the lace of the curtains and painted into the grain of the wood, so that he may never forget them no matter how insignificant or life-altering, the pain of a scraped knee, the tears of a sibling who sits as he and their mother tend to their injury, the weight of responsibility and guilt on his young shoulders, of learning that his father has never been the man Castiel thought him to be.
The torture had lasted far longer than Castiel though fair, and by the time Dean had finished, his skin glistened in the late day sun, shining golden as he worked some tension from his muscles, soft noises of satisfaction had escaped his lips on nearly every pass of his stretching. Castiel had been far more grateful for his loose-fitting shirt than he’d ever had cause to be before when they made their way back to the house. The long fabric hung a few inches below his pant hem, sparring them both from the mortifying and damaging evidence of his attraction to the man beside him.
“You better stay awake Cas; I swear to god.” Cas manages to roll his eyes which must be a good sign.
“Yea, I think I did somethin’ to my shoulder, it doesn't feel right and I can’t really move it.”
When he gets close enough, Dean reaches out and grabs the boxes from him. Cas stands still as Dean slides them beside his belongings under the gig's seat, grateful once again that Jody wrongly assumed that Dean would be packing more than he is.
Dean makes an appeasing face and tilts his head back against the wall.
“Are you sure? I cou—”
Winchester is looking out onto the fields; the breeze plays with his hair as it curls slightly around the shell of his ear. He fists his hands to stop himself from reaching out to smooth the hair, to tuck it against the soft skin. His hand clenches around the chalk and for the first time since sitting down, he remembers that he is supposed to be teaching and not simply spending time with Winchester.
“I never went to school because if I did, we’d’ve starved. Now, I don't need your sympathy so you’d best not start offering it.” He shuts his eyes against the flashing images of a vacant stare, of blood, and the heavy weight of reality on his young shoulders and against the nausea that rolls through his stomach as violently as it always has. His brain may be numb to it but his heart isn’t always quite as apathetic.
He mouths his way down to the bolt of Cas’ jaw and slips just past it, caressing the soft spot just below his ear, a soft noise releases from Cas’ throat and Dean smirks against his neck. Kissing down further he laves his tongue against his pulse point and sucks. Cas’ knees buckle slightly against the sensation and before he knows it, his head is getting pulled back up as Cas crashes their mouths together once again.
Cas scrapes his teeth against the indents he left on the base of his neck and like a gunshot, his climax hits him. His lungs give up as he coats both of them with his release, his head tipped back with a silent scream.
Dean watches dry mouthed as Cas lines up another shot, his thumb pulls the hammer as his fingers slide across the metal to mimic the position Dean showed him earlier. Dean’s blood diverts its course low and he nearly lets out a moan but seals his lips around the sound before it has a chance to escape.
He shuffles off Cas’ lap and steps out of his clothes as Cas does the same and moves further onto the bed. His length stretches proud against his stomach and Dean’s mouth waters as he remembers his taste and the weight of him in his mouth. He crawls forwards and smirks when Cas’ breath hitches in his throat. Moving in close, Dean can see that there's hardly any blue to be found in Cas’ eyes, his pupils blown so wide they swallow almost every bit of their beauty.
The rest of the afternoon moves on trend with the day, each time he spares a glance to a clock he sighs. The hours tick by slowly until finally, it’s time for supper.
Sure it's not fire and brimstone and hanging from hooks or being pinned on the rack but that’s not what the empty is supposed to be. Once the empty is put back to sleep it goes back to the way it's supposed to be, pure nothingness. An existence that ceases to even exist. No one awake, no one relives a single thing good or bad.
“Morning son, my name’s Jody Mills,” Jody extends a hand for him to shake. He's mildly surprised at the force behind her grip. “I’m here to look at the work you’ve done with Ringer.”
His eyes drop to the gauze wrapped shoulder and he reaches up to play with the seam of gauze on his skin. Cas reaches up and brings Dean’s hand to his mouth, laying slow, closed mouth kisses to the skin as Dean drinks in the sight of Cas bared in front of him.
It's not a wanting feeling he’s used to, he wants to do more than finally give in to the desire to know him physically, there's a softer desire coupled with that want, one that he never let himself dream he could have. One that he knows Cas deserves.
“Oh, I hadn’t thought about that…” Sam says distracted with the finer details of planning swirling around his head.
He makes no move to speak knowing that soon enough Cas will fill the silence with whatever it is that brought him here in the first place.
Sliding into the right side of the carriage he offers a small smile to Cas who returns it in kind.
fault, because I wanted you, because I loved you and I told you, how do you expect me to go on when my selfishness is what is going to kill you. You're going to die, get sent off to angel hell for eternity because I was selfish enough to want you to be mine.”
. This could be his name with nothing more than a promise to himself not to forget it.
He doesn't want to get his hopes up too high, but any deviation makes him think that maybe, just maybe there's still a chance for Cas to come back—for everyone to come back. That’s what's driving him, that's what's keeping his head above water as the undertow tries to steal him away again and again.
He debates deflecting again, but decides on at least telling a partial truth, “My shoulder gives me a hard time now and then, it's really nothing you need to worry yourself over.”
“Yes?” he responds tersely.
He reasons that he’ll work, heal, and rest up a bit, and eventually pack up and leave again before anyone misses him. A few days; a week at most before he puts this land behind him and carries on.
He fights for each piece of information the man is willing to give him, offering up more about himself than he gets in return and the fear in his chest grows larger with each passing minute. If it could be considered as such with how early into their correspondence he finds himself, the moment his name passes the man's lips is the final nail in a coffin he willingly laid himself in. The longer he spends talking to a man who only offers a nickname at best to call him by the more he realizes how far he would be willing to go for him.
“So huh, how much did you hear besides y’know that last part,” Dean asked sheepishly rubbing his hand against his heated neck.
A few of them find themselves on the porch with Hannah, who after several days of seeing but not truly being part of the festivities, had grown sick of it all and wanted to sit with her siblings in the shade. This annoyingly makes Gabriel’s smile larger. The look in Gabriel’s eyes reminds him of the look he’d received as a child when they had travelled into town and Castiel, young and far too obvious for his own good, had his attention caught by a young man running around in the street laughing and screaming. Gabriel had been the one to nudge him out of his wistful staring, and through his downcast eyes and incriminating blush, he had seen his brother give him a look that said ‘I think I know what I just saw and I love you but I'm not going to call attention to this’ before he turned back to their family, leaving Castiel to compose himself.
He was a blank slate when he died and Castiel can paint whatever portrait he’d like onto that canvas, but never will it be right. Never will he know who his brother was meant to become.
“Can you—I mean will you be the one dropping supper off tonight?” he sounds hopeful, but it's like he's trying to hide it.
“Cas… we seem to have some visitors,” Dean says quietly. Calmly walking himself between the men and Cas. “Don’t interact with them, please, I don't know what they want. I’m going to take care of it, just stay here, with Ringer. Keep him calm.”
“I’ve been patching kids up for twenty-four years and I don't think I’ve ever once been thanked so kindly before.”
“It’s okay,” he says to Cas holding a hand out to stop him. “I got them fighting a dragon,” Dean then says to the girl.
“How’s the work going?”
His double gave him a look that clear as day said I’m not buying that. “C’mon Dean I’m you, we experienced the same things, I know what you feel, how you feel. If there's anyone you can talk to about this it's yourself isn't it?”
He’s not sure how long he spends looking at the carving, or when the wind picks up and shakes shivers through his body. He’s not sure when the tears dry and the wracking sobs take over.
Dean looks up and his eyes bore into Castiel’s, he holds the stare while never slowing in his ministrations. Dean's free hand, the one that had been burning where it laid splayed against his bare hip bone lifts up to grab at his own where it’s perched in Dean’s hair. Shock and a surge of heat shakes him to his core as Dean begins pushing Castiel’s hand, effectively fucking his own face until Castiel understands the directive.
Eventually, of the million thoughts flying around in his head, he settles on a question that he knows Jody will be able to answer.
The farm is quiet, its occupants asleep as they should be. The ground cools and the trees sway in the night’s breeze. Dean sleeps soundly, it’s new for him to be able to do that.
He sets his eyes at the house. It surely is a pretty little thing although ‘little’ may be the wrong way to describe it. A woman looks through a window at the barn, at him; but can hardly see him through the barriers between them. She's peeking through curtains strung up on the frame; real dainty, white and sewn, nothing like he’s ever had, or will ever have. He can see the curious young faces again in a window, desperate for information on the newcomer but forced to stay inside by their father.
Dean's mouth turns down with petulance but there's no argument to be had, everyone here knows that it’s true.
His goal had been to give Dean just enough to know his friendship was real, but he’d gone so far as to give him all the fuel he would need to ruin him if he so chooses.
“So, I have here my own slate, and I thought it might be good to start with just writing out the alphabet, so you can get used to the way the letters look and the sounds they make. Then we can work on writing out some small words, mind you I’m flying by the seat of my pants here because my siblings didn't know near the number of words you do so if this doesn't work, we can try something else.”
“Might be, depends on the habit doesn’t it?” Cas replies pointedly.
Cas tells him he’s being a bit paranoid, and Dean wants to believe him but then he sees the gauze poking out from the collar of Cas’ shirt and ice washes through his veins. So, he ignores everything and only listens to the voice that says again and again to get to a place where Cas is safe.
“I rise at dawn, so I expect you to do so, too if not sooner. Don’t worry, the roosters will wake you in time for that. Breakfast will be then, but you best eat it quickly. The horses set about all day and’ll need taking care of. Most all the other animals we’ve got here are left to themselves. I’ll be giving you Remy, here, for when you go to fix up the property, so make sure you get comfortable with her before that.” He pats the black horse that he had ridden out on as he goes on, “The wash closet is off the back entrance, use it as you need to. My boy will be out after supper to give you some food. Just sit tight till then."
“I’m sorry?” Dean asks after a beat of stunned silence.
His apprehension must show on his face as Cas corrects himself, “To sleep Dean, let me hold you as we
They vowed to throw a ‘we stopped the end of the world again’ party when things had calmed down and the team was finally finished with looking over their shoulders for the next big bad evil to fight.
Instead he raises an eyebrow and Cas who shakes himself a little before answering honestly, “Yes.”
That’s it then, Castiel thinks as Jody extends a hand to Dean. Shooting him another glance, Dean takes her hand and shakes it soundly. He’s slow to realize that her hand is now extended to him but shakes it best he can as his mind races.
Castiel is taken aback by the low blow Dean just dealt him, for all he’s talked about his disagreements with his ma about the practice of marriage, he thought Dean would understand how falling into line would make him feel more like a fraud than anything else and how much he would hate himself for doing so. Not willing to give him the satisfaction of a response, Castiel soldiers on.
Twin smiles grace their faces, Dean seems to understand that he can’t stay long without him having to say it. Which he’s grateful for.
“Cas?” Is all Dean says, the word is let out on a breath, barely audible over the rushing in his ears.
“Alastair that's enough,” yellow eyes says, clearly displeased with the violence.
“Hey hey! Dean, wait stop! You’re bleeding,” Cas says jogging up to him. He looks back and is surprised to see a decently sized pool of blood on the stable ground.
“Gabriel says that he hopes to visit again soon, and that ah! Kali is pregnant again and they want to get the travelling done before she gets too late into the pregnancy because and I quote, ‘as much as she loved seeing all of you, she was about ready to kill me by the time we returned home’. He’s going to be picking up Hannah and Uriel and whoever else wants to come along too. I can only imagine what their journey will be like,” Cas says with a laugh.

Relief pours over him at the sound of Cas’ voice, his heavy breathing continues but at least he’s now able to take a proper breath.
His most egregious sin is silence when he should speak. He continues to sin, he damns himself to hell, if only to allow them a few more moments of happiness.
“Don’t be, it was unbelievably hot.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam texts him to meet him in the garage. Michael seems to have taken residence in one of the rooms in their hall so the garage is the best bet to make sure that they aren’t overheard.
“No, Father, you don’t need to do that. It’s just that—” he wishes he could see Cas’ face better, but there is no way he’s going to approach the window now. He doesn't know if Cas is going to spare him any possible harm. It seems that now is when Dean will get to learn if Cas has had any clues as to his true motivations—though hidden even to himself at times—behind his actions. He waits with bated breath, the few seconds between Cas’ sentences seem to stretch forever.
“God yes, fuck please Cas,” he grits out as waves of lust strike him again and again at the prospect of finally having Cas where he’s desired him since the first week he knew him.
As much as talking about it upset him Cas seemed responsive to his advice about moving on. He even looked, at times, as though the entire ordeal was seeming less and less impossible as Dean detailed the aftereffects of undergoing such a decision.
“All part of god's plan as Ma says,” Cas says through a mirthless laugh. “I love her, but she doesn’t seem to care what I want. And my pa doesn’t care one way or the other what I do as long as it doesn’t cause him grief.”
He isn't sure how he’s going to get supper tonight with the state of the young girl being what it is, but it wouldn’t be his first night without a meal so he supposes, in the end, it’ll be no issue.
“I hope that I’ll still be able to get away during the days while they are here, but it may not work out as such,” he pauses as an unsettling thought crosses his mind. “Come to think of it, I might not get much of a chance to stay with you for your supper during their stay.”
Frustration flares in his chest; despite having tried his damndest to get Cas to possibly understand that what he does is not foreign to him the man turns out to be as obtuse as a stack of hay.
“What about your shoulder? You can’t think you’re going to lift yourself on it,” Dean asks incredulously.
The woman's face splits into an excited smile. “You must be Dean! Well welcome welcome, Jody’s quite proud to have managed to get you.” His chest warms at the woman's words, a fondness for Jody burrowing into the warmth. “And please call me Ellen, anyone who has Jody’s approval has mine too.”
He barely speaks, only asking Cas how he’s feeling and if he needs to stop for anything before falling quiet again. When they stop for the night in a trail town, he gets Cas a room and takes his post outside of Cas’ door.
At some point Cas pulls out some ink and paper and sets about writing Gabriel a letter, he watches Cas write and his heart swells as he sees Cas writing in cursive. Cas notices of course and gives a shrug as his cheeks and the tips of his ears go pink. It's endlessly endearing to know that Cas went out of his way to keep Dean from the possible embarrassment of being the only one to sign in print back on the farm.
“Cas,” Dean says in a choked off groan. “Please.”
As usual, he takes Dean his dinner, and as is their new normal, the air is heavy with tension. Dean can feel it too but neither attempts to fix it, not knowing where to begin in the slightest. Castiel still takes what he can from their limited time together, gentle touches, soft smiles, stories shared. He makes memories with Dean while he can, not knowing if he’ll ever get the chance to again.
“Doesn’t seem like it to me, Dean,” he says as Dean looks at him and sighs heavily.
Dean’s blood freezes in his veins slowly as Lucifer talks. Chuck is back on the board and he's using the weirdest pawn to enact his will. Lucifer and Chuck teaming up is odd enough but then the devil honest to god just calls his brother a ‘cuck’. That’s his life now, god he misses the days when he only had to deal with salt and burns.
He asks Sam how to learn the words in a song and Sam shows him how to get to a ‘Google tab’ so he can look up the song (Sam reckons a genius lyrics page might be a little too much for Cas). He types the words he remembers into the ‘Google’, and is decidedly confused by what can only be the name of the song. Take Me to Church, while a lovely name, stands out like a sore thumb in his head alongside the titles of the pieces he aimed to perfect in his old life.
“They may if I was to leave after a courtship began, but if I am only leaving for school I can’t imagine they’d give me one,” Cas responds as Dean climbs out of the cab bed again after finishing with the cleaning and oiling of the hinges on the doors and the handles.
Dean nods ever so slightly, before he lifts his head up to rest on his hand, his arm bent at the elbow. “Go save your brother, though I can’t say I’d blame her for it if you don’t make it in time.”
They carry on through the week similarly; Gabriel leaves and everything calms down again on the farm. Cas spends much of his day inside with his father and having finally given him a name to use for their records they compile the money Dean had made in his five weeks on the farm. While Charles had been right in saying it would be reasonably small, it was still more than Dean had been anticipating. He has an inkling that Cas might have something to do with that.
Dean strides up next to him and flicks the revolver open, with deft fingers, he slides the three new bullets into their temporary homes. He gives the gun a once over while more of the inner workings are exposed before he spins the cylinder again and clicks it back into place. He looks up and sees that Cas’ eyes are trained on the gun in his hand and the flush has come back, stretching down his face to his neck and disappears down the back of his shirt.
As he’s setting off to change, his father's voice stops him.
He sees the man taking in the house, a slightly awed expression takes residence on his face and turns it from hardened and rough to something softer and hopeful in a way. Before he can see him looking Castiel removes himself from the sill and makes quick work of finishing getting ready for dinner.
Dean sucks in a quick breath, clenching his jaw in anticipation of the pain while he tries to keep his body as untensed as possible.
He’s still unsure as to how to read Cas’ advances, if they could even be called that, but regardless the knowledge that someone aside from his brother at least cares for him even in the smallest way means more to him than he would have thought.
Gabriel pulls back with a quick kiss to her cheek before he turns and envelops Castiel into a tight hug. “It’s good to see you, Castiel.” Castiel can’t help but agree with the sentiment. Since his birth they hadn’t gone longer than a few days without seeing each other, so the past ten months have been especially difficult.
Dean nods once before he turns back the work he was doing. He doesn't want to leave but he knows there's no way he’ll be able to spend the day with Dean if his father knows he's not needed.
I would like to quickly say that I know almost nothing about raising, training, or taking care of horses and as such (even though no one would) do not take what you see here as advice about horses.
He knew that he’d need to finish quickly, so as he ramped up his speed and flicked his wrist in a twist against the ridge of his tip, Dean focused his mind on the way Cas had felt against him. How he had felt a stirring low in his stomach at having him so close, how incredible his name sounded as it fell from Cas’ lips in the ragged way it did whenever Dean managed to get Cas more riled up than normal, like he had done the night before.
“Then? Then I suppose I say goodbye, I don't see what else there is to do.” The words taste bitter in his mouth, laced with anger and frustration at the situation he’s found himself in. The situation with Cas, with him on the farm, with him and this work. The mess that he'd created simply by staying far longer than he ever planned to is coming back to cause terror and there's nothing he can do for it until he can leave.
His pa excuses himself a moment without explanation and his ma jumps right into asking about Kali’s pregnancy, forgetting that Castiel is sitting right there. It’s not that he is opposed to hearing whatever Kali chooses to share, it's that, normally men wouldn’t be in the room to hear talk of a pregnancy that they had no part in, in fact even the father may be absent for such discussions.
“No I know that but, this past year, you’ve really seemed to move past the idea that you needed records to be someone.”
“You want me to lie to my little sister?”
“I won't pretend to understand your father, or your life currently, I know circumstances are different between the two of us due to, uh you said god was ‘Chuck’? I don't know all that you've been through because he didn't like us apparently didn't like that story, but the core of our being are the same, and in my world Castiel and I, we - Dean we loved each other.” The other Dean gave him a look so hopeful and sorry that the hole that was punched in his chest at hearing that this fucking version got
Almost immediately a woman calls out to them from the bar.
Sam tells him to put his hands behind his back and he wraps a brush stock around his wrists and tells him that he can't break them no matter what, with a wide grin Sam tells him that he can make things come true with him trapped like this, and being the good big brother that he was he plays along, arguing that Sam can’t make him do anything but lets the trick go on. Sam looks him dead in the eye and asks, “Your nose is itchy isn’t it?” and just like that an annoyingly apparent itch spreads across his nose and down the curve of his nostrils and his eyes begin to water from the feeling. He wiggles his nose back and forth trying in vain to scratch it somehow.
“It does I think, thank you.”
He can’t lie though, the house itself is lovely. It is painted a dark muted red and stands out against the backdrop of the blue sky. It gives off such a welcoming aura that he can actually imagine it becoming a sort of home for him.
“See I’m not so bad, Ibby seems to like me just fine, you’ll warm up to me soon enough.” His voice is soft, gentle, the way you would talk to a crying baby late at night, soothing and calm. A pang of longing spreads through his chest when he realizes that he has no memories of either of his parents, or anyone else for that matter, talking to him in such a way.
The man walks him to the barn, and as they pass the main house he catches the faces of several young children in one of the windows. He notes with some surprise that not all of the man’s children match his light skin tone, but he makes no comment on it, sure that if he was meant to know why he would be told.
Dean flicks the other page for him to look at. It’s still unsigned, as though Dean knows Castiel wants to see it before he agrees to it.
Cas makes a muffled sound, Dean swallows it and the bolts of pleasure that stretch down to his toes come to settle heavy at the base of his spine, stoking the fire and making it hard to think.
“No complaints from me.” He really means it, something about Cas wanting to claim him makes him believe that Cas wants to stick around for a while. It’s a promise for the future that neither have the guts to properly put a name to, but it’s there all the same.
“But why?” he can't help but ask.
“I'm just about done here, head on over and I’ll meet up with you there, oh and Cas—” he waits for Cas to look up at him, “—try not to undo my hard work eh? I saw you with him yesterday and it wasn’t pretty.” Cas looks affronted for about two seconds before he smiles and heads off towards the stables shaking his head in good-natured disbelief.
Cas rolls his hips down on to him with so much force he sees stars behind his closed eyelids.
“Cassie, surely you know that I know the truth, and I am more than happy to keep that to myself for as long as you would like me to; but I felt it necessary to say that while I caught you staring at that boy today more times than I think I stared at Kali the first time I met her, I believe that I caught him looking at you as well, far more than a normal farmhand should look at the one who taught him. Though I must add that each time he did so, he turned the instant he thought you might see him. It was almost as though he couldn't help himself.” Gabriel's voice barely carries, it's dropped so low.
“Perfect.” The word is said so reverently and with such a deep expression that Dean fights the urge to roll his eyes, knowing that Cas wasn’t answering his question at all.
He worries about how much he might give away to Cas, his pure face may give the hope of trust but real trust needs to be earned no matter how his chest yearns for this man to know him and so he shuts down his storytelling and flips it to Cas, “Your siblin’s ever done something heart-stopping like that?” Scooping the last few bites of food off his plate and using the last bit of bread to gather the sauce he grimaces at the cool temperature of the once hot meal but eats regardless.
While Cas had been awed and succinct, all Dean can manage is a strangled out “Fuck.” when faced with the feast that is Cas displayed before him. He’s a man starved and for the first time he doesn’t have to stay that way.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s late for the snow, weeks too late but the world has been colder since—well since.
Cas had told him one night that an old cut had gotten infected, a small branch had gone into her arm as she played but it had seemingly healed, however beneath the closed skin it festered and made her ill. The doctor in town was able to catch it in time, keeping her there to have it monitored with the utmost care as the reopened wound healed again.
Dean can tell that Cas is trying not to think about what the farm is like in his surprise absence. What the first morning was like when they all woke up and he wasn’t there anymore. When neither of them were there anymore. Did Cas elect to leave a note behind, or had he let it slip to Anael that he was leaving, did the youngest kids cry about their missing brother? Dean doesn’t know what it’s like to have someone disappear without explanation, he’s always been the one who vanishes. Thinking about it now he can’t help but wonder if anyone he’s left has wondered where he went.
His breath catches with the intensity and his flush darkens, stretches further down his neck reaching all the way to his chest. Cas lays his palm flat against the blush stained skin and Dean’s heart hammers in his chest so forcefully he thinks it might beat through his ribs.
As fast as it came it's over, his breath skitters from his lungs as the dog simply puffs away. He’s not seen it before, even with all of the people they've had to say goodbye to since this all started. It makes it all so much more real somehow. How can it be that there's just nothing left of the dog, of any of their loved ones, any of their friends? Of
“Well I for one am glad he took that so well,” he says to one of the ambling pigs, though the only response he's given is a disgruntled snort. “It could have gone a lot worse, couldn’t it? But I'm right you know, Ibby is getting along great and Cas, well he doesn't like him all too much, ‘s not his fault mind you, it’s just the way of things.” His audience makes no comment on his assessment, the animals choosing to simply carry on as though he wasn't there at all. It makes him smile, to be able to speak freely and not worry about who might be hearing, he never thought he could value something so simple as much as he does.
There’s a risk people can’t help but focus on, fears about what he’s done and who he’s made bad with before, it’s cost him jobs before, but showing up to new places usually lends itself to being a clean break for him in the past.
“In a heartbeat.” Cas said as he laid them both down on the mattress, instinctively he knew that Dean needed to be held, that more could happen later, but in that moment Dean needed the surety of Cas being there solid against his chest and so that was what he did. Being human sleep grabbed at him almost as soon as it had Dean and with a smile, Cas let himself fall into its grasp, warm, content, loved, safe, and above all else the happiest he’d ever been.
Accompanying him had turned out to be a grave mistake as Dean quickly found the work to be more laborious than he first had thought. Castiel sat stunned as Dean had spared him a glance before gripping the hem of his shirt and hesitantly lifting it over his head. He’d watched helplessly as Dean tossed his shirt onto Remy’s saddle and promptly returned to work. His breath had lodged itself thick in his throat as he had taken in the man in front of him, the power he held in his back, the way his muscles rolled around each other as he lifted his arm again and again over his head, the glint as the sun's reach shifted over the scars that adorned his skin, a sight he’d yet to ever see in such length. The scars didn't detract from him at all, if anything Castiel had thought that it spoke to Dean’s character and strength, building him up instead of tearing him down as the man seemed to think.
“What? No not at all. The only thing I want is to see my brother happy, he gives so much of himself to others and never accepts anything in return. He deserves to find happiness. I know it's… dangerous for him to live as he does, but I know he has no choice in it. I don't pretend to understand it fully, but if Castiel could be as happy with a man as I am with my wife, he should be.”
He calls a family meeting in the war room, the map table laid out with what he’s gathered, the tack board covered in loose-leaf pieces of info, lore and spell work. Jack looks confused, Sam looks concerned, they both look conflicted. Like they want to be hopeful but of what they don't yet know.
Cas rolls his eyes with a smile. “Certainly.”
“Why do you have a gun?” Cas asks, making his way into the barn, albeit slowly, as though he’s afraid the gun will go rabid as a dog might and hurt him.
The entire conversation leaves something odd in his chest, same as it had the night Cas tripped over his blanket. But he refuses to examine it.
And yet he has no plans to find out the truth, at least he doesn't have any now, maybe he’ll be made to work with Dean and he’ll then have the chance to ask him about it when Dean can’t just leave to avoid the conversation.
Castiel plays into it tilting his head to the side and pinching his brows together, “If you were just going to hire someone when I leave, why would you set up the transfer when you could have kept him here and avoided that all together?”
“Oh god Cas you feel so good, fill me so good,” he whines as Cas snaps his hips up, burying his cock to the hilt.
He admonishes himself for his melodramatics before he realizes that, as much as this isn’t his death and this isn't time for a eulogy, he’s likely never going to return to the farm. Sometime soon he will lay his eyes upon his siblings for the last time in his life. Perhaps he’ll be fortunate enough to see them again in a few years, when the predictable scandal of his sudden departure has calmed to the point of being nothing of note. Perhaps at a wedding or in a visit planned without his parents' knowledge.
“We never got to leave the farm much growing up, had our chores, our school work too, and with so many of us we didn’t need to venture from the property to find something to fill the day,” Cas says, glancing back at the house before stepping further into the barn. “My ma and pa were busy folks when we were all young, still are, truth be told, so my older brothers and sister would create games for us and we would play with the animals around the farm. As they got older my ma kept pushin’ for them to get married, leave home and start families, follow the plan God set out for them, make something of themselves,” Cas pauses, kicking a small puff of dirt with the toe of his shoe. “She’s set those sights on me now, she’ll have any number of young women come in from towns all over, she won’t listen when I say I don’t want to get married, that I don’t want a wife.”
He breaks himself out of his reverence with the notice of a swaying of a branch a bird had just flown off, its call growing fainter as it puts distance between it and the sullen thoughts bouncing inside Castiel’s head. And looks up just as Winchester—quite quickly—turns his head back to the slate. He doesn't miss the tingeing of his neck, but still he doesn't know what to make of it.
He eats his way through about half of his meal before Cas speaks, “My sister Hannah, that's who was taken into town today, she's been sick for a short while now but nothing we did ever seemed to help for long. She’ll be thirteen in a few months, she always said she wanted to be a seamstress as much as she wante—wants to be a mother… The doctors don’t know what’s wrong.” He scoffs, “Ma wants us all to pray as though that's helped before. I'm sorry if you’re a religious man but what God would put sickness and death upon a family, and if he does why should we pray to him for saving?”
“Oh stop apologizing boy, I’ve got fourteen children, the eldest few have children of their own, I’ve seen and dealt with worse than this in my life. Now if you’d so please, sit on the chair there and we can get started on fixing you up.”
“No way!” she says excitedly before her face falls. “Castiel says there's no such thing as dragons.”
Oddly out of breath but decently clothed again, he figures he can do nothing about the fact that he’s shirtless still and waits for Cas to finish helping his ma. The barn is quiet without Remy there, something he noticed in the days since she last spent time here is that without her huffing the barn seems a lot less welcoming.
“Nothing ‘m fine, it’s just my knees.”
Cas comes over to Dean’s right side and lifts the shirt from its hem, Dean slides his right arm through the sleeve and ducks his head through its hole. Now essentially bare from waist up he tenses, acutely aware of the eyes on him as Cas and his ma work the shirt gently down the injured arm.
“The smaller chest, under some of the clothes.” Dean shoots a glance to the gig; the box is sitting on the footboards.
“I completely understand if you want to tell me to piss off after this,” Cas begins, his nerves kick up again, unsure of where Cas is planning to go with this train of thought. “But I’ve been thinking more about how you don’t yet have a name. How you said that it needed to mean something.”
“Will the leg heal up well though, quickly?” he asks. If he’s kept off his leg he’s not sure what will happen, would Charles send him off as he can no longer help, would they make him stay until it was healed, and if the latter how could he make sure that his past transgressions don’t endanger the family that’s helping him so incredibly.
Jack keeps getting stronger and while they have no fucking clue how they aren’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
He can tell that they both want to say more, but he’s not in any mood to hear it, especially considering he knows their general consensus on his choices.
When Cas pulls away from the kiss he whines and chases his lips again, but Cas holds him back.
Almost as though he was summoned, Dean walks through the barn doors. Castiel can see a few pieces of paper of the letter he had written to Sam sticking out of his pocket. Castiel’s own sits hidden in his room.
He loses his rhythm soon, the myriad of sensations becoming too much for him to handle. Dean gasps and claws along Cas’ back scoring the skin, leaving lines of red in his wake. He can’t help the odd pride that overwhelms him to know his claim is left on Castiel, knowing how red and marked Cas’ back must be by now.
It still carves into Dean that Cas is willing to leave but that he doesn’t want to do so with him. What had made him sure of leaving was that Cas wouldn't want to go with him because he wasn’t ready to leave his home. But now it seems they’ll both be going, just not together.
Cas’ skin is blanching further and his eyes are fluttering closed again as he tries to talk to keep himself awake.
Dean has to agree with him, three days of damp cloths and some soap has made him long for even a basin out behind a tavern to clean in. He doesn't even care if the water is as cold as hell as long as it’s not poured from a canteen, he’ll be happy.
“Just the one?” he says, not catching on to his pain. “What’s his name?”
“I know I asked you all to come home quite some time ago but gave no reason as to why I felt it necessary to have my grown children home again.” Castiel can’t tell if that's a barb at him. “As you all should be aware, our home and the land it sits upon used to belong to my father and his father before him and so on. I was given the land when he deemed himself too old to work it feasibly. While I am not yet at that age, I felt it necessary to announce that Michael will be inheriting the farm at which time I choose. I have spoken to him about it in length, he understands that the farm will not become his until Anna and Samandriel have had the same chance as all of you to grow up here.”
On one sweep of Cas’ hand across his bare torso, his thumb catches on his nipple and he lets out a small moan. Cas does it again and Dean bucks his hips, his cock pulsing in its confines.
“Gabriel, language,” his mother scolds while taking his bag from him.
“Well I don’t see how you’ve gotten me when I’m still right here,” he teases with a smile.
“Hi there Kevin, I’m Dean this is Cas—”
“Did you hurt it? Or is it more a pain that never likes to go away?”
Dean gets the feeling he might not be just talking about sex; he swallows around the lump that’s grown in his throat. The prospect doesn't scare him as much as he thought it would, and what he sees in Cas’ eyes takes much of the rest of the fear away.
The rider sizes him up, and he can’t help but fidget slightly under the weight of his gaze.
Cas drops his head against Dean’s collarbone as he locks up above him. Twin whimpers sound from them as Cas’ spend mixes with Dean’s on their bare torsos.
“Well, either way,” Dean says, letting the sentence hang in the air.
“I was simply asking after a bit of confusion, it just seemed more logical to me to forgo the process a second time.”
He swirls his tongue around the head, laying extra pressure against the ridge where the shaft connects and sliding his tongue through his slit, gathering the bitter fluid that had collected there. He moans at the taste of Dean on his tongue before leaning in and swallowing his cockhead, laving his tongue around it. One hand comes up to grip the base of him as Castiel uses the other for leverage and control.
“I never had cause to, but I’m sure I could have. I marginally stayed in contact with Sam up until I left town this last time. Sending money to him whenever I could. But leaving doesn't mean that you have to cut those people off.” He quiets for a minute. “Actually, I was hoping to send a letter ahead of my arrival to tell Sam about all that's changed since last he heard from me."
Castiel is silent for a beat too long after that sentence, “No, father you don’t need to do that. It’s just that—” Castiel pauses, “he’s got no one Pa. I figured it was the least I could do to be a friend to him.” He doesn't wait for his father's response before continuing on, “He’s been alone all his life, he almost seemed desperate for it.” There’s a laugh on his face, the corners of his mouth ticked up to persuade his father. Of all the sins he’s committed in his life this one seems the most egregious.
A murmured “thank you” makes its way to his ears and when Cas curls around him, both of them lying on their right sides, his chest to Dean’s back, he takes hold of his wrist, careful while moving his injured arm, and searches out his pulse. Cas lays his hand over Dean’s heart and together they fall asleep to the matched beating beneath their fingers.
Dean’s movement stops the second he hears Charles' voice, his tone leaves no room for assumption, whatever this conversation is about, it’s bad. He knows Charles is talking about him, just as he knew it was a poor idea to go near Ringer before he had had permission, but to hear Charles speak of him with such contempt hurts in a way he never thought it could. At least not from a man who barely knows him but still allows him on his property day after day.
Yep, still tasting dull.
“I apologize, I didn’t–”
Maybe it hadn’t been
“Can’t we stay a bit longer?” His daughter’s whine was to be expected.
“Good to know,” he replied with a happy smile. “But still.”
To his very core, ripping it open and leaving him bleeding.
“Shut up,” he added for good measure and then made his way over to the door.
He had no idea how, had no context to go on – and yet, he knew
With that, he turned around and left, not giving Dean any chance at all to say anything else or to stop him again. Dean wanted to. Every cell in his body screamed for him to go.
“I know, Gracie, just making sure,” he reassured her. She really
This time, we'll hear a bit of Spanish - once again, translations are there as "hover overs" as well as in the end note.
A kiss was pressed to his lips but, if that was supposed to convince Dean to let him go, Cas was severely mistaken. Instead, Dean pulled on his wrist, trying to wordlessly get the man back on the bed and more importantly, back into his arms.
,” Babette exclaimed, clutching her hands together like a proud mother.
Right now though, he had to concentrate on getting to class.
Dean was pulled out of his sleep by yet another dream. He rolled over in bed and stared up at the ceiling as he recalled warm skin on skin, closeness, comfort. Intimacy.
“I guess I’m just wondering how you feel,” Cas finally began. “The other night… it was your first time with a man and thanks to… well,
“I totally get why your parents would call it that,” he finally told him. “I love the whole storyline with those rose petals.”
Cas nodded in agreement as his thoughts seemed to wander far away – most likely to two weeks ago. A moment later though, his eyes went wide and his gaze caught Dean’s again as he exclaimed, “Oh God, I know why. That Sunday was the day you told me you know I’m C. S. James. It completely distracted me and–”
But she had also seemed worried for Dean –
Dean stopped him right away, ignoring the little sting in his heart at the way Cas was
“You aren’t mad at me?”
said it to him already but Dean knew it didn’t count – because he was sure Cas had been asleep.
Cas had made his choice – and it wasn’t Dean.
- and if you like her looks better for this Gracie, you can totally just picture her like that 😊
“Good,” she replied, her focus immediately back on him, too wide smile back in place.
“Yeah, I think Castiel is pretty awesome. Too bad he doesn’t visit more often. I really like him.”
But they needed to talk first. Cas
“Cas, you were a
Dean stayed unimpressed by his eagerness - at least on the outside.
The whole time, Cas signed along because Eileen was standing with them, a glass of wine in her hand and a serene smile on her lips. The fact that Cas always made sure to include her gave Dean a warm and fuzzy feeling around his heart… or rather, it simply amplified it.
Laughing at something Eileen had just signed, Cas was almost breathtaking.
While Alice and Harry shared a moment over being reminded of Chuck’s situation, Dean was unable to look away from where they were holding hands. It was one of the things he loved about them as a couple. All these years and they still sat together on the same couch and held hands. All these years and they were still close, were still each others’ source of comfort. A haven for the other. Dean had to swallow hard, reminded once more of how this could have been him and Lisa one day, if only -
. Who - well, sorry to say this, sir - but everybody knows: wants you as her new baby daddy.”
. I don’t want anything from you. I never did nor will I ever. So stop behaving like I’m already Emma’s father. Stop pushing her in that direction. And for the love of God, stop forcing a friendship with my daughter. She doesn’t like it, she doesn’t like
“Yeah,” Dean replied, almost hugging his daughter for breaking the weird spell that had been put on him. With one last nod towards Cas, Dean hurried after Gracie, taking a deep breath of fresh winter air the moment he stepped outside.
Lying in bed that night, Dean knew he wouldn’t get any rest at all. He’d been waiting downstairs while Grace had been with Cas. He might have gone upstairs himself if it hadn’t been for Michael, asking him to give his brother some space.
Careful not to jostle the hand, Dean began to move his fingers up Cas’ forearm, touching him softly every few inches in search of other spots that had possibly suffered from the fall.
“Now look at you, looking awesome like that. You should travel more often, it’s doing you some good.”
“So… how do I react to such a question? I shouldn’t lie, but I also can’t spill the secret. So… what do I do?”
“Wait, what?” Cas spoke up, but Dean was happy to see Luke ignoring him, listening to Dean’s request. Which led to Cas trying to argue with Dean instead: “Mr. Winchester, that’s not –”
“What’s wrong, what happened?”
Dean huffed out a soft chuckle, amazed at how easily his soulmate was able to read him. Doing as C ordered, he took a deep breath as he watched C write more words.
Zar was at Cas’ apartment.
okay?”
After all, they had a lifetime together to look forward to.
For that reason alone, he was grateful when a familiar voice called out his name, distracting him from his thoughts. Looking up, he smiled as he saw his old friend Lydia and her daughter Emma step up to him.
she signed back right away. After just a moment of hesitation, she added:
“Did you know that he had feelings for you?”
Sunday dinners at the Shurleys was always a loud affair – but today had to top every one before and Dean simply enjoyed it, soaking up the laughter and joy, the atmosphere of warmth and family and love. He laughed with Michael about Gabriel’s antics as the younger Shurley brother trekked around the house, playing hide and seek with the kids; he spent some quality time helping decorate the tree together with everybody else; he joined Sam when his brother went to bring in their presents once the tree was deemed complete.
“A letter of recommendation?”
She left the room before Dean could ask anything else. Instead of pondering over it or going straight after her, Dean sighed and jumped into action.
Cas’ blue eyes fell on him, making Dean’s heart skip a beat. For just a second, he was sure there was no hate, no ice in Cas’ gaze and it made him more hopeful than he’d thought possible.
“Not your problem,” he finally admitted. “I guess I’ll see you. Or not.”
My love also goes out to my dear friend and incredible beta,
“We’re so happy for you, Dean,” Jo’s voice finally came through the speakers at a normal volume again. “You deserve it.”
But no, it was Cas, just Cas, and that was okay by Dean.
“Look, Dean. I know you might think it’s none of my business –”
Also, you don't need to tell me how cruel I am with this ending, one of my alphas already did 😂 ... though the other one thinks it's perfect 😂
Instantly, Charlie’s eyes flew wide and a breathy “ohhhh” left her.
When Cas first spoke, Dean was amazed at how unaffected he seemed by all this. Then, however, Dean looked at the man.
For that, Gracie earned herself a poke in the shoulder which only made her chuckle. “Ouch. Thanks for the confidence boost, Munchkin. Anyway, I should get going. You okay now?”
All the while, their hands roamed, mapping each other’s bodies, exploring, stroking, caressing. It felt so incredibly good. Not only to touch, but also to be touched again. Cas’ hands really were unbelievably soft, his fingers brushing along Dean’s skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake.
Hello my dearest readers 😍
It's quite obvious that LC will turn out much longer than AC. I've been asked if it might be because it's easier for me to write Dean's POV and my immediate thought was: nope, I'm usually much better with writing Cas. BUT! Then I really thought about it and I have to admit that, yes, with this Dean, this particular version of him, it really is easy as pie for me to get into his head - because he has been with me for a long time. I wrote AC within a few weeks, but LC has been with me for over three years now. So yes, I guess, when it comes to these two versions of Dean and Cas, Dean is easier for me to write.
,” came the shocked cries but still, for just a second, Dean was tempted to go through with his threat.
“Ehm... probably. We... well, we haven’t talked about that yet. But hey, how are you?”
“My hand,” Cas grunted, his breathing ragged.
That was probably the moment he should’ve left, but just like before, he kinda missed that cue.
more and for a second – just a second – Dean considered laying his heart completely bare. But… something held him back. He knew how he felt about Cas – always had, always would. But he didn’t want to tell him simply to reassure him. Not while they were in bed together, about to get frisky. It would look like he’d only said it so they could have sex and, well… that felt cheap. After all these years, Cas deserved more.
, Dean definitely took note of the reaction.
“Dad, can we have a game night tonight? Please?”
“As if you need any class on how to take apart a motor and put it back together.”
Dean felt a cold shiver run down his spine. Not that he was ashamed of anything he had written – but there were certainly some things he’d rather C heard (or read) from him the first time instead of from their family. So he couldn’t help but ask.
He had to shake his head minutely, reminding himself to get away and get to class – shit! He had class!! – before this would get any more awkward.
Instead, Jo nodded.
“He told you that?”
“Oh, very funny, Cas, very funny,” he retorted drily.
“Okay.”
How long it took them to begin sobering up, he had no idea, but after a while, their laughter died down to a few chuckles. As the ensuing silence grew, the air between them became charged and from one moment to another, Dean became intensely aware of how close they were.
“I see you knocked some sense into our son?”
“You would move to New York?”
“I am sorry that you think that way,” he spat out. “I can assure you that is not the reason for my friendship with Eileen or Grace.”
“Yes, and that was already one too many times.”
The thought stung like a bee, but once it had latched onto his mind, it just wouldn’t go away. Did Cas seriously forego his morning run just so he didn’t have to meet Dean? Really?
“Oh, go eff yourself.”
“The thing is, Dean... life has given you a second chance. And no matter what your choice will be this time, it won’t lessen the way you loved your wife, so stop thinking that way. It only means that you can be happy again!”
The growing distance from Cas was like a physical pain that wouldn’t go away.
And it felt terrible.
attention.
He hadn’t even met C yet. And already, he hardly thought of anything else other than meeting them, hoping it would be soon.
I know I said
For the umpteenth time, he considered getting in the car and searching for him. But really, what good would it do? All it would do was put himself in danger and he couldn’t do that to Gracie.
“Hey, Daddy. Did you finish early?”
Still, Dean took a risk and did not lean back into his own space, enjoying the moment to be this close to Cas. The soft warmth radiating off of him, the enticing smell that always reminded him of cozy afternoons and happiness. It took every ounce of Dean’s self-control to not reach for the man’s hand and just hold it. Or better yet, put his arm around his shoulders and pull him into his embrace, enjoying this wonderful movie while cuddling him close. The thought alone had Dean’s heart racing faster. Every cell in his body urged him to do so. Just reach out, it would be simple to fit Cas to him, like the last puzzle piece.
(See the end of the chapter for
All these sensations – already divine on their own – mixed and mingled, merged and combined, crashing over him like waves. Sweeping him away like a forceful storm.
When Jo spoke again, her voice was soft, nothing left of the hard edge that had been there earlier. “Slowly, to be honest. First, I would just seek out her company, thinking it was normal. She was my friend after all, right?”
“Lisa…” was all Dean was able to whisper.
Dean pressed a kiss to her head before he spoke. “You’re welcome, pumpkin. But it’s not all.”
Meanwhile, he let go of Cas’ ass so he could push down those annoying sweatpants.
Both men nodded silently, neither able to form words.
At least, when it came to the dreams he had at night.
Dean held his breath, prepared for Cas to run again, but thankfully, this time, he continued to talk.
And it’s
Sam insisted when Dean huffed.
= hello
Wasn’t she?
And what?
Dean’s fingers nervously drummed against the steering wheel while he forced himself to take even breaths and not speed. The streets were still in terrible condition this early in the morning and he didn’t wanna risk any accidents.
Charlie glared back at her before suddenly turning on a sugar-sweet grin, whispering, “
Schooling his face, Dean tried his darndest not to act strange. Maybe Cas hadn’t noticed that Dean had almost kissed him.
“Bathroom. Why? Wanna join me?”
to him? Was he attracted to
Six am came and went.
“Oh no.”
Smiling, Dean positioned the pen again and without overthinking, he let his heart speak as he wrote his words to Cas.
Time to stop guessing and pretending this was normal.
Thinking about the irony of that for even a minute longer would drive him insane.
Cas had finally called him
= Hello, honey
The drive back was silent and Dean hated it more than anything. He knew Gracie didn’t blame him, knew she wasn’t mad at him. But somehow, he couldn’t help but wish that was the case. He would gladly take the brunt of her anger or even her disappointment at him if it meant she had something to focus her emotions on. Instead he could only guess that they were all over the place, wondering why Cas would do this.
He was so close now.
He sighed again, turning back towards the door. “Forget it,” he told him quietly, knowing that he had blown his one chance. Just because he couldn’t find the right words.
Dean had to force his breath to stay even but he was unable to stop his eyes from roaming all over Cas’ face, trying to take in every inch. “Yes,” he finally whispered. “I... I just had to come back.”
He understood it then, what Alice had told him. Love wasn’t black and white. It didn’t matter what happened then - because it was
The words pierced into Dean on so many levels. But really, he was only able to address one issue he had with this statement.
“No problem, girls,” he replied, giving Krissy and Ava a smile. That was, until he saw the slightly reddened cheeks and wide grins. “Have you been drinking?”
“Where’re you going?”
Before he could continue, Gracie had made her way around the car and was coming up next to him. “But, Dad. Our snowman. We wanted –”
avoiding him. He’d obviously stopped running, or maybe he was taking another route, or whatever. Dean knew for sure because, yes, damnit, even though it hurt like a bitch every damn time, Dean never missed a morning ride. Just in case.
Cas’ reply sounded somewhat forced, but the happy smile was still on his lips and it gave Dean a smidgen of hope. He wasn’t willing to let go of the man just yet, too captivated by his eyes, and as it seemed, Cas wasn’t rushing either. Just like the day before, the tingling where they were touching was almost driving him crazy. Maybe even more this time, since it was skin on skin.
“Thank you, pumpkin. For trusting me with this.”
He had no idea how much time had passed, maybe they’d even fallen asleep again, maybe not, but the next thing he was aware of was Dean’s hand softly brushing up and down his back.
Even though he would not admit it – didn’t want to admit to the small hope growing inside of him – Dean could
aka the WIP Big Bang - because guess what 😁 ...
They said their goodbyes and Dean was relieved when he could slip his other hand into his pocket as well. Minutes later, he reached the café and sighed when the warmth engulfed him. Giving himself a second to lose the chill, he watched the scene in front of him.
Obviously, Michael wanted to speak to him alone.
“Love you too, pumpkin, bye.”
Dean reached his hand out and right away, Cas took it, leaning into him as they followed their friends. They exchanged a quick kiss, smiling at each other as they remembered that Pride wasn’t all that was special about today. It was also their one-year anniversary – and how fitting that it would be celebrated in such a fashion and with so much love.
“You said Lisa’s name in your sleep.” Cas’ voice was so low, nothing more than a feeble whisper. But Dean was close enough to catch it anyway, the words surprising him. And Cas wasn’t even done yet. “Twice, actually, looking so content and blissful. It just... scared me. It brought back all my fears, this fact that you would dream of her when I was by your side.”
