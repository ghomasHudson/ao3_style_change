"Mrs. Hudson, this man has been dead for multiple hours. Getting an ambulance won't help him anymore but getting DI Lestrade will help me a great deal." Sherlock quickly said, rubbing his thigh while he started to look at the body more closely. His abrupt movements hadn't done well for his injury, but he couldn't really care. There was a body on his doorstep, it was fresh, no one had tampered with any of the clues and he would still have a few minutes until Lestrade's crew arrived. It was like Christmas had come early. If he couldn't nail down Moriarty with this one, he would never be able to he feared. Delivering a dead body in broad daylight was anger at its finest and angry people made mistakes. Sherlock was ignoring the crowd of interested people gathering on the street in front of the house since the door couldn't be closed without moving the body.
“You knew what you agreed to” Sherlock moaned in his defence.
Sherlock wasn't paying attention anymore to what the other said because he felt the ground disappearing under his feet. He shrieked slightly when he noticed that the thing, which was being levitated, was his body. It wasn't possible, no. There were fundamental physical forces. No human could ever set them out of effect. Except if… Sherlock believed he really was talking to the devil himself.
"I already did tell you that I don't often get to talk to someone like you?" the devil asked with a raised eyebrow.
Sarah groaned, “Don’t remind me. She’s been non-stop talking about the wedding for weeks now. I really need a break.”
“Sherlock, just wait for a second”, John managed to wrestle his friends body into immobility, sitting on the other’s legs, arms pinned behind his back and one arm braced in front of Sherlock’s chest. “God, just tell me what this is about?”
Autumn truly had London in its claws now and dodging beneath trees or jumping through hedges had left their coats awfully damp and covered in fallen leaves. They had just escaped the wrath of an antiquities dealer who was selling stolen goods surprisingly open in his little shop. Sherlock had insisted that they were able to get the needed information themselves without having to go through the official routine and Lestrade. Somehow thieves weren’t that into someone photographing their trophies and their accurate accounting about each and every offence. John still couldn’t understand how stupid one had to be to not try and conceal anything at all. In the end, they had rather taken the route of a quick escape than risking a fight with the dreaded official consequences. Still, the shopkeeper had been remarkably fit and Sherlock had to use all his wits and knowledge of London’s streets to shake him off, all while texting Lestrade with the little hint that he might want to check up on that particular antique shop.
"Yes, half a piece of toast. That's why you're going to have something now" John insisted, nudging the other's arm with the plate.
"That's actually… thorough."
“So, I’m still a mystery and you are now trying to do what exactly?” John grinned, trying to conceal the glee he felt at, without even trying, having upstaged one Sherlock Holmes.
"That is… strangely sad. Do you realise that?"
When the shirt came off with a practiced swoop and accompanying cheer by the ladies, John didn’t even notice at first. He already had been transfixed by the long lines of muscles visible under the thin fabric and their movement. Taking away the bit of clothing didn’t make it any more sexual. Hell, John already felt like the temperature had risen several degrees since the performance started.
"Generalisations aren't really my thing so I try to ignore them as best as I can, unclouding my mind so to speak."
John felt like what was to come would firmly put him in the place of prey rather than predator. It sent a feeling of excitement racing down his spine. He just assumed that if Sherlock really wanted to, he could be downright dirty instead of softly suggestive. Sarah probably would have fallen off her chair but John couldn’t wait. Now, he had only one question remaining: Was he even deserving of the offer?
"I'm sure you are aware of the rules?" the devil mentioned a bit impatient, setting Sherlock down on the ground again, when he saw the realisation in the other's eyes.
Lestrade laughed, "What, is he listening in?"
“You’ve bettered your standards remarkably since the last time I saw you.” Sherlock could be mistaken, no he never was mistaken, the voice sounded almost impressed. “Still, a bit of a mess and your kitchen is a bio-hazard catastrophe waiting to happen.”
Every word he heard made him perk up a bit. Of course he wasn’t out of danger. As much as the doctor, not terribly hard to deduce when someone tells you that straight on, seemed to hate the idea, his heat would set on and then all morals would be blown to the wind. Perhaps, just perhaps, he could get a few words in first. Perhaps the medical man would allow him to take birth control. There must be a way to spin it. Sherlock nodded to himself, yes at least he could make it as painless and with as few consequences as possible for himself. He nearly missed the faint tap on the door and the calmly spoken words, so caught up was he in his plan.
“I told you, I would take you apart”, John breathed and nipped at the plush bottom lip right in front of his face, “And I’m going to do exactly that now.”
“I’d rather not” Sherlock gritted out, feeling more comfortable at a perceived safe distance. Additionally, he didn't want to be commandeered about. He had hated it as a child, and over the past years, he had gotten even more particular in that regard.
"How... why?"
"Sherlock, breakfast" John sighed, nudging the plate closer to the detective, who was writing in a slim notebook. It had been just about a fortnight since the woman, Mary Waterman, had been found dead and robbed of her soul. That particular detail didn't make an appearance in the official police report but it didn't alter the truth. After the initial turmoil had died down, John was effectively stuck with Sherlock. Stuck meaning, living a normal, boring human life. With nothing more to do than the crossword and getting acquainted with his future clients via trash TV, John had started to notice patterns in Sherlock's self-care routine, mainly that there wasn't any routine. Sherlock would crash for a maximum of two hours of sleep anywhere his body currently sat or lay. He regularly went at least 36 hours without shutting his eyes or taking a rest of any sort. It had John googling the effects of sleep deprivation on humans at some point. Tea would be drunk if offered but there seemed to be no effort on Sherlock's side to stay hydrated. Food was even worse. Yes, baked goods would go down without question but neither breakfast, lunch nor dinner were steadily kept times for Sherlock. John had managed watching him go for two days without once having a bite to eat before he had cracked the first time. He felt a bit like a parent, keeping constant tabs on an unruly child.
Sherlock stayed silent for quite a long time. Seven years ago, he had finalised the end of eternity for himself, or at least so he had thought. Now, there apparently was an opportunity to change the course of his life. He had made many mistakes in the past and right here the devil of all people gave him the chance to make it all up. Of course, he was slightly shocked into immobility. No amount of superior intellect could save you from that small moment of embarrassment. When you suddenly get a chance you had given up long ago, your new outlook took a moment to settle in. At least, this was what Sherlock told himself as he felt his mind practically reboot.
“Okay”, John started softly, “I think we need to get a few things straight. First, what’s your name? I’m John by the way.”
"I can't fulfil the contract" Sherlock said crestfallen. He couldn't see a way out of his situation. Of course, he had done and would do all the needed work to catch Moriarty but he wouldn't be able to do so himself. He was effectively bound to sitting down and watch others do the work.
“It’s only quick if your mind is that slow”, Sherlock shrugged, his eyes gleaming with the hint of a challenge.
"I'm never anything else." Sherlock smiled and turned around to look for Lestrade. The card he would have to hand over but not the information what he had done with it since he had found it. Sherlock thrived on this, being a step or three ahead of everyone else.
"If you're my client I might need information on multiple occasions. Additionally, I have the feeling that you might be able to tell if the latest victim turning up is just a junkie who overdosed or one belonging to this case. Every piece of information is crucial and I won't botch up this investigation by letting you sit around at home. Get used to it, you'll be staying in this world for a while. Do keep up."
"What exactly?" John asked, having sat down in one of the armchairs well away from the DI after finishing the bandage around Sherlock's leg.
“They just had to look at her shoes. The answer was right in front of their faces the entire time. How did these people manage to pass their public exams and which faculty deemed them competent enough to be the ones dealing with murders?”
"I believe that was seven years ago" Sherlock grinned. He simply knew that the devil would stay. This gave him so much more to work off of. The bare points of the case were condensing into shapes in his mind palace, taking up residence on an empty wall. This investigation would need the utter most care. It certainly promised to be the most dangerous for him, since his soul never had been on the line before. Sherlock stapled his fingers underneath his chin, mug of tea forgotten on the armrest of his chair. The devil was sitting in front of him and the first facts were in his head. There was a short flash in Sherlock's eyes. The Game was on!
Sherlock looked a bit put up when the touch disappeared and John had to laugh gently, “Hey, just let me get out of my clothes, too. You are quiet impatient, aren’t you?”
John crawled up so his body was lying alongside Sherlock’s, his own erection brushing against the other’s hip. He put his hand first on Sherlock’s waist stroking there in small circles before wandering closer.
John sighed and stepped into the flat "I'm sorry." He wasn't sure if there was a betting pool open on these words but he was determined to never let anyone get to know of his current situation.
“Wait for what we still have planned”, her maid of honour smirked. “This will be unforgettable.”
"You give me too much credit."
“I’m fine”, Sherlock called already closing the door to his room behind him.
Since that little trip had brought him nowhere nearer to discovering what his flatmate was up to in his spare time, John was constricted to fantasising which was neither satisfying nor a thing he wanted to do for too long because it always ended in some fantasy of Sherlock exercising some weird sex practices alone in his bedroom and that was a direction John forcefully did not try to think. Especially, since he had witnessed with his own eyes that the detective was not at all completely above the carnal pleasures. That case had been something John very distinctly did not write or think about. That case was lost somewhere in the depths of his drawer never to see the light of day on his blog. He did not think about how Sherlock’s body had been pressed against their suspect. Or how he had kissed as if his life depended on it. Or even how the whole scene had be one of the most erotic John had seen although both parties had still been fully clothed. No, he definitely wouldn’t think about it. Just like he didn’t think about the jealousy that had welled up when he unsuspectingly stepped into the room. That was all something that he desperately tried to forget.
"You know if anyone finds out what I'm doing here to clean up their mess, I never get my authority back in working condition." John chuckled and brewed tea. Although he really didn't need sustenance, he had found out that tea was something he actually enjoyed. Even if it was just to pass the time of which he had way too much at night, since it wasn't acceptable to be out every night. Mrs. Hudson really had a keen eye and ear.
"Not really" Lestrade shook his head "I hoped you could tell us more. These are coming too quickly now. Even we can't ignore it anymore."
"Hm?" Sherlock looked up towards John, having been lost in thoughts.
“Oh, did you find him then?” the elderly landlady poked her head out of the door.
"Well, I told you I could persuade even you to doingstuff without using my 'devil voodoo' " John reminded Sherlock.
"Okay but what could he do? It's not like he could just dump a largely mythical place on earth and declare himself king." Sherlock still found it rather odd to remind himself of who John was and where he came from.
?” John asked with a smirk, Molly’s crush was obvious but it was as well clear it wasn’t anything serious just the same as any other crush on a famous person you couldn’t reach and if you were honest with yourself, didn’t even want to reach.
"This is it then? We're working together on this" Sherlock asked.
"Food is boring" Sherlock groaned, plucking up one sheet and scrawling a few more notes on it. The groundworks of this case would be how daemon deals could be abused. To figure out that part, he first needed to find out under which parameters and rules they actually ran. John keeping the information like a trade secret didn't help him at all. He had the prime source, the devil, sitting right under his nose but still he was confined to better guesswork. Sherlock was frustrated and the thumbs hadn't been nearly as interesting as initially promised.
would definitely be too much a thing common people would do for you”, John teased but leaned in just a fraction closer. If he was doing this, then he’d do it right, “I mean that is a pretty quick succession from ‘Who are you?’ to ‘I’m stalking you’ to ‘Let’s have sex’ don’t you think?”
"He's with me." Sherlock offered as simple explanation.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “That is beside the point.”
“What do you want?” Sherlock’s electric mood had suddenly disappeared, “My time isn’t up yet.”
"I'm pretending, I didn't hear that" John hummed, gently tapping his fingers against the soft upholstering of the arms, "Since you didn't feel like briefing me beforehand, I assume you either haven't thought of a cover story or where childish enough to not tell me out of spite."
Thanks if you are still reading, it means so much to me :)
"Well, how should I know how much of your brain was still operational through the pain?" John asked, standing awkwardly next to the bed. He really hadn't done this in a long while, so he was a bit rusty on the protocol.
"Please don’t tell me you get your corps parts delivered to your front door, now." Lestrade sighed.
"Hey" John said a bit affronted.
John looked down onto the lithe figure on his bed. The eyes looking back up at him, completely vulnerable but totally honest and clear, crashed through any barriers he had built up. He might have been able to refuse Sherlock while the Omega’s mind was in the grip of heat but he had the distinct feeling, the other was actually clear minded enough. Now leaving him here was a thing of the impossible.
"Which one?" Sherlock asked, proceeding to cut through the optic nerve of the dead mouse on the kitchen table.
"He might be closer than you think." Sherlock said slightly ominous but left it at that "Good day inspector. Do call when something crops up"
"You have no idea how close I am to take up your human practice of praying" John grumbled and turned back to the living room wall. As agonising as this was, he wouldn't trade it for going back to what actually was his job.
"I'm not fidgeting" John said a bit defensive.
"Because I think religion is utter bullshit, right?"
It took a few more moments for Sherlock to find the beginning of the thread he had unravelled earlier that day. "Well, I'm not quite sure how exactly he figured out the whole idea of you being real instead of a fairy story. It probably was some kind of 'lucky' accident, but he must have been raised in a quite strict religious setting, otherwise I doubt he would have reacted this extremely. I expect it to be quite the shock to the system to find out that beings you mostly perceived spiritually, can actually take on quite tangible forms."
John smiled and hummed, “You mean when you’re not in heat.”
"John's not here" the DI pointed out, "I'm just saying. You were practically attached to each other lately."
"And the only difference to dying without a contract is that you don’t get picked up like a small child from kindergarten?"
"Well, I might be able to help with that one a bit" John smiled and leaned back, breathing slightly easier again.
"Yeah, how long did you think that was the case before you sold your soul when you realised it was a mess?" John groaned "Don't answer that. You ignore yourself too much."
"You're curious and really take badly to not having your questions answered. I think that is a very valid tactic with you." John shrugged, "By the way, I'm waiting."
Sherlock shot her a put up gaze, "It's not about telling a story. It's about outlining the process of reason I use to determine..."
“I have enough time John Watson since I'm not fending off admirers left and right from where I step” she grinned, continuing to sort through the books.
“I guess you’ve never actually been with someone then?”, the question was more to confirm what information he had already gathered about the Omega since his appearance in the doctor’s flat.
“I’m not following you”, Sherlock defended himself, spitting the word ‘following’ out with more scorn than John had ever heard anyone speak.
John wasn’t sure if Sherlock was really talking about him, because he felt like he was about to vibrate out of his skin. The teasing touches were maddening. Those fingers always skimming just past where John would love to feel them.
In the end he just put on some pyjamas he found in the case and wrapped the blanket back around himself tightly. None of the clothes had been anything he had actually already worn. Everything was so new it could have had the tag still on. Sherlock hated it. It was just another reminder how utterly over his old life was. With cautious steps he went along the hallway, through a kitchen and stood in the large sliding door leading towards the lounge. The Alpha was sitting with his back to him in an old armchair, mug in hand.
As the music started, John realised that he recognised the song Sherlock had chosen. It was a quite well known pop tune but any further contemplations were just out of the realm of the possible. The first drawn out note sprung Sherlock into action and subsequently turned off John’s brain. Sherlock twisted and turned his body in perfect sync with the music, letting his muscles work at a languid pace. Since he was standing quite a few steps away still, it looked almost as if he had erased John’s existence. He seemed to be dancing for himself, rolling his head back and running the tips of his fingers up his body. On occasion, he pushed his hips out to the side just slightly, hinting at what he could do if he fancied. John knew the coyness was only a farce but the way Sherlock moved his body almost as if he had forgotten he was doing so, made him want. The feeling was simmering deep down inside him. He wanted to hold, wanted to touch, wanted to feel that body move against his. It was almost scary what not even a minute of watching Sherlock dance did to him.
It took Sherlock half an hour of thinking before he dared to put his pen to the parchment. He had never in his life exerted so much concentration on the writing of a document as he was now. In fairness, no other document had ever held the chance to change something irreversible into nothingness. Sherlock felt the added weight on his shoulders. It didn't help that the devil was still sitting just a few feet away from him, very clearly observing every minuscule move he made.
"What?" Sherlock asked, and turned around slightly to look at John, seeing the parchment in his hand, "What are you doing?"
"Don't fidget so much" Sherlock murmured, voice softer as he was getting sleepier.
The detective rolled his eyes, making an exasperated sound. “No, like I said: If we don’t embark on a relationship, you will inevitably leave me for some petty woman.”
The other had already dropped his hands to fumble with the zip on John’s jeans. “Slowly, we’ve got time”, he rumbled, stilling Sherlock’s hands, “A lot of time and things we need to do” He brushed his hands to Sherlock’s waist and untied the silk dressing gown the other was wearing to reveal creamy skin.
John scrunched up his forehead in confusing “Nothing to be honest. I had a run in with him at the end of last term, mind you I was drunk as hell but I doubt that’d have mattered much to him.”
John took a deep breath. Okay, so much for processing the incidents of the evening in peace. He must be absolutely mad. Dazed John walked into his flat and looked around. He couldn’t imagine Sherlock, weird name but it seemed oddly fitting, in these surroundings. John looked down his own body and contemplated the other’s words. Shower. Well, if someone who was bloody gorgeous wanted to come to give you a private dance show, you could also make an effort to not reek like an entire club.
"Care to elaborate for me?" John smirked.
“Did you really just do what I think you did?” the girl whispered looking at John as if he had just defeated a bear with his bare hands.
John just rolled his eyes but couldn't help smirking a bit.
“Hello?”, he said softly, his hand on the door handle but still keeping the door shut, “I’m coming in. I just wanted to warn you.”
"Excuse me, but I don't think I quite understand."
"I've got a few questions to your serial killer theory and since you can't be bothered to come to the station, I have to make house calls." Lestrade sighed and zeroed in on the way Sherlock was sitting on the living room floor, one leg elevated, instead of frantically pacing or lying on the couch, "Wait, what's this all about?"
“Yes, oh god, yes please”, Sherlock whimpered, his hands holding on tight to John’s shoulders. John could feel the body underneath him going pliant. It was a heady feeling to have such a wonderful person in his bed and to be allowed to come so close. With a smile John pulled his hand from Sherlock’s hair, using it to unbutton the other’s shirt while his lips feverishly kissed and caressed every newly bared piece of skin. Sherlock’s sighs and broken of tries at forming words only spurred John on even more, dipping his tongue into the other’s belly button and gently nipping at the skin just above his waistband.
"Ehrm..." John thought for a moment "You could probably call it 'Hands tied' "
"You'd better explain yourself thoroughly" Lestrade grumbled, arms crossed in front of his chest.
"Mrs. Hudson this is… John Watson", Sherlock introduced the devil, stepping a bit to the side to give her a better view, "He will be sharing the flat with me for his stay in London." He had pointedly ignored the glare received when saying the name 'John Watson'. What had struck Sherlock about the devil from the beginning were his utterly ordinary looks. It was all so plain and normal that he needed a boring, everyday name to suit the exterior. 'John' had almost immediately popped into Sherlock's mind and after trying it out a few times it felt right on his tongue. He would be living with John and solving a case for him. Yes, that sounded a lot less ominous than: My flatmate the devil.
EDIT: If you are interested: the_elusive_plot has pointed out to me that they have written a story with a similar plot (http://archiveofourown.org/works/2683154). So if you like the general idea, definitely head over there and check their work out :)
"Oh hell, no" John snorted, "People are weird believe me. What you've made up across the centuries is quite amusing but nothing more than that. I do have a bit of a problem with any extremist though, they usually take it upon themselves to punish others and I don’t like my job being done badly."
“No, not impatient”, Sherlock growled, “I just don’t like unnecessary time delay.”
"Yes you are" Sherlock just replied and settled is head on John's shoulder. He couldn't tell why, it just seemed like the right thing to do.
“John, don’t be so slow”, Sherlock whined, writhing on John’s lap.
“I found your bag.”, he said just loud enough so it could be heard through the bathroom door, “I’ll put it down here in front of the door. Then I’ll go back into the kitchen, make tea and wait for you. Take as much time as you need, towels are easy to find if you need them.” He knew there would be no confirmation so he made his way back to his living area turning on the kettle to make a cuppa. That was the thing he had been looking forward to on his way home and now his quiet evening had taking a pear shaped turn. Some things you simply didn’t want to have to deal with after a long day at work.
"Well, it's how it is. I can't go around and willy nilly make things happen." John hummed, "What kind of world would we live in if that were possible?"
“What?” Sherlock snapped trying to get his lips back into the proximity of John’s.
"It's okay. Go to sleep" John murmured from a place that sounded like it was far away, "Go to sleep, you were brilliant." Sherlock just let his body relax and fell asleep, wondering how deeply he actually trusted John because this hadn't seemed like it was the end of it.
“John”, Sherlock moaned, hands tightly fisted into the other’s shirt, “Touch me, please.”
“You don’t really think I would allow you having to get yourself off after that”, Sherlock’s voice rumbled, lips right next to John’s ear as he pulled himself up a bit.
“You’re completely barmy, John Watson” Molly shook her head and smiled.
"The devil can bite me and either way he'll have a field day with you first, so I'm pretty safe in line behind you."  Lestrade just shrugged and put Sherlock's files all on a pile towards the side of his desk.
"Oh Sherlock" she smiled softly at him, "Of course you are, but usually it keeps you perky a little longer. Has another of your puzzles come up then? Was it through your blog? You know, you should really get someone with a knack for storytelling to write up your cases. It's all a bit boring, if I can say so."
Sherlock found himself smiling tentatively. A compliment was a compliment, even if it suggested an eternal life as a personal servant in hell.
"I mean that went not too bad, did it?" John repeated.
For a moment Sherlock was struck with awe before he realised what was happening. When his brain had caught up he couldn’t help himself but sag against the Alpha. With the simple brush of their lips he felt like his whole world was set ablaze. Before he had met John, and before the Alpha had turned everything Sherlock thought he had known about the world upside down, he had been certain he would never want someone. But the past two months had opened his eyes. Suddenly a big part of his time was spend trying to figure out how to best keep the doctor to himself. He might finally have found a way because those practiced lips were currently taking him apart and he had no intention of fighting it.
"What a hateful bunch" Sherlock grumbled as he limped out of the hospital doors. It hurt but he definitely wasn't about to accept help. Not after he had worked hours on convincing the doctors to let him go. They hadn't been concerned much with the wound itself since it hadn't pierced any important arteries. His blood loss and subsequent blackout were more of a concern to them and after stitching up his leg, they had wanted to keep him in for observation. At the time, he had been too weak to put up much of a fight so he stayed the night. As soon as he had woken the next morning, he was hell bend on getting out of there. Hospitals weren't his favourite place especially when doctors were trying to unearth more and more information.
"You're on a case?"
"And demanding" John huffed, feeling Sherlock's long fingers tighten their grip in his hair. There would be a lot of self-control to be exerted by him tonight and John already felt the edges of his persona going fuzzy. Sherlock was like a vortex, pulling him in further and further the closer he got.
The Omega was completely putty in John’s hands, quivering against his chest. It took some control from the doctor to hold himself back long enough for the dark haired ones to gather his wits enough to give an answer.
"Which I think is awfully inconvenient" Sherlock hummed "Just think about how much easier it would be if everyone could send their complaints directly."
The devil looked at him and asked with a calm voice, "What is it that you desire so much that, after all this time, you want to strike a bargain?"
"Lestrade?" Sherlock called, already opening the door to sprint down the stairs, nearly falling over a very surprised police officer who had sat on the stairs to write his protocol.
"That's a bit snappy for people who let you in on their work without you having the proper education and degree." John chuckled, "You are just your word while they have the academic proof to back them up."
Sherlock fell entirely silent. He never had considered the extend a failure could have. Yes, he had known that Moriarty was dangerous and that there must be a lot at stake for the devil to ask for his help. Nevertheless, the sheer size of the whole operation just started to sink in. Moriarty wasn't more than a terrorist. He was nearly no different to all the suicide bombers the world had seen over the past years. The one difference was that he wasn't contempt with people dying at his hands, he wanted to make them suffer and he wanted to make everyone suffer. He was operating on such a large scale with such tremendous knowledge that it ran cold down Sherlock's spine.
“Did you solve me?”
"Lestrade, we both know that without me your division's numbers would be miserable" Sherlock said dismissively "Anyway, he's with me because I think he might have information regarding my latest case."
John grinned in between bites of food “You want to catch the baddies then? How ambitious, never thought of you as the crime fighting sort”
“Oh god”, Sherlock whined, his face screwed up with pleasure. His eyes were firmly closed and moth was hanging slightly agape.
Sherlock thought for a moment about the implications he had derived from John's explanation, "Isn't that a somewhat limiting rule? I mean people can declare whatever item, be it a shoe, as holy for them. It seems to me like there are a lot of useless rules that only hinder you."
"That point would be more powerful if you hadn't already involved me in non-human business" Sherlock reminded him, desperate to get information "You cannot expect me to make connections when I don't even know if I have interpreted your business correctly."
“You really are as terrible as they all say, in some aspects, aren’t you?” John sighed, he was too bloody tired for this game, “I did something someone else should have done long ago, preferably your parents. I don’t care if you are an uncivilised arsehole unless you let it out on others. So you know where the door is, go and be a nuisance somewhere else.” John gestured towards the door with one hand and turned around to unpack a few of his books.  There were about a million things he needed to do and he wasn’t inclined to waste anymore brain power on the lanky student than absolutely necessary to get him outside.
Sherlock chuckled lightly and his head fell down again, hitting John’s pillow with a slight thud.
“Sherlock, what the fuck was that?” John panted, leaning against the wall in their hallway.
"It's not bad, just a wound and it will heal" Sherlock tried to weasel out of the situation.
"I hadn't noticed that now you were also asking for payment in return for answers."
"Well, it's not just you I have to keep in mind." John shrugged, "And after all, you still have a chance of performing an act of contrition at the end of your life and be done with it, provided you still have your soul."
“I know and if this goes on for much longer, I can't be held responsible for my actions anymore” John took a look at the stack of books in front of his friends “I see you tried to be quicker than everyone else with getting the exam relevant reading materials. Sure you feel like reading that all at the same time?”
Sherlock looked him straight in the eyes, “I’ve been dancing for years. Everyone is dull and predictable. Within half a minute there is nothing new about them. Yet here you are. You should have been so ordinary, so easy to please.”
“Answer?” John really could do with a less mentally challenging task at the moment.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again but leaned over to press his lips a bit more forcefully to John's. This time he couldn't escape quickly because John was prepared and caught him, lengthening the kiss quite a considerable bit more than Sherlock had planned on. He found that he didn't mind.
He had been so lost in his thoughts that his tea had gone cold and just as he wanted to get up to set the now useless drink aside he realised that Sherlock was standing right in front of him. In his dressing gown. Just in his flimsy, thin, silk dressing gown. A dressing gown which clung to every part of the other’s body as if it was expecting punishment should it hang too lose at some place. John looked up at his flatmate with big, surprised eyes and a mouth gone dry.
"Sherlock" John called, still standing next to the corpse, trying to process what he had just witnessed, "What makes you think they'll answer?"
At first Sherlock wanted to protest but strangely he felt his body already relaxing back into the embrace and just went with it, his head resting on the doctor’s shoulder. To his surprise he felt calm. Calm and content and weirdly happy.
Like on auto-pilot he navigated his way to the address Lestrade had texted him. There was no way to know for sure this belonged to their case, at least not until John would give the confirmation. Part of Sherlock hated it, he wanted to prove that he could do this without having some divine intervention all the time. After all, he had enough to go on, didn't he?
"And what use did this unclouding of your mind have?"
"Why?" Sherlock asked confused and John was at his wits end. They wouldn't move forward if he continued to evade the topic. He squared his shoulders slightly, trying to force confidence back into himself. Slowly, John extracted his hand from where it lay beneath Sherlock's and moved it so he could gently pick up the other's head from his shoulder.
“I thought
The water boiled way too quickly for Sherlock's liking and soon he found himself in his armchair again, opposite his unwanted visitor.
“Oh god, more please”, Sherlock moaned and pressed his face into the crock between John’s neck and shoulder. John felt the short breaths and small whimpers hit his skin and had to bite his own lip. He had never thought that having someone come completely undone in your lap with only a hand job could be this hot. Sherlock’s body, with his hands clinging onto John for dear life, taught him otherwise.
He was still high from the chase. That crime had been a particularly stimulating one. A victim in a locked room within a locked room mystery. It had entertained him for a whole week until he had figured out what happened. After that, finding the culprit had been the work of a mere day. Still, the conclusion to such a wonderful distraction always left Sherlock swimming in endorphins. Lestrade had let him go since he figured he wouldn’t have any success with getting a statement from the consulting detective, even if he chained him to a chair.
Angrily he hung up and tossed his phone into some corner. No one was served with his extreme reaction at the moment. There was nothing he could do now that the Omega was in his flat and so shortly before his heat. Besides he needed to talk to the boy first before anything else was to happen. A deep breath calmed him down enough to take the suitcase and bring it into the small hallway.
The break passed very light-hearted. John was glad that Sarah’s maid of honour had planned a hen night that would let the female doctor forget a bit about the stress. As far as he had heard, Sarah’s mum had asked but the girls had pretended that the bride hadn’t wanted a night out and they were honouring that decision. John took another look at his friend and was trying to imagine how she would like the night which would follow up their admittedly boring week.
"It won't simply reverse the contract and leave me to die?" Sherlock wanted to cover his bases before he let the spark of hope grow bolder in his chest. The case itself was unimportant. If it was something routed in the real world, he would be able to solve it. The payment though still seemed too flimsy. He had no guarantee the devil wasn't simply using him. After all, wasn't his opposite the incarnation of all evil?
“I have no problem with that” Sherlock smirked, running his hand along John’s jawline to the back of his head to pull him closer, “I might even be glad you did.”
John smiled softly, not able to believe what had just happened. Sherlock perched on his lap, breath calm, body limp and head resting against his shoulder. One arm was still around the Omegas waist, John holding him close. He gently pressed his lips to the side of the other’s head and murmured, “Tired?”
So there would be a dancer. Well, John could appreciate a good body so he did not think he would have a problem with the show program. Okay, a woman might have been nicer for him, but this was Sarah’s night and if the guy wasn’t totally incompetent, he would also enjoy it.
He took a few steps to make sure he could observe the bigger picture. It was a man in his late forties, probably stuck in an office job, making good money but without the prospects of bettering his career at least in his current company. No ring on his finger which made Sherlock stop for a moment but then he put it down to the modern affliction of always wanting something better. Overall the man was dressed like he had just been on the way home from work, so probably didn't make it home last night and somehow got into Moriarty's antics then. There were no obvious signs of murder, except that he turned up as a corpse. Sherlock went back to the head, trying to take a closer look at the face of the victim without moving him. There was a curious sense of recognition within Sherlock, as if he had already seen this man before but hadn't thought of him as important enough to make a retrievable note of him. It was just a feeling that nudged at the back of his head. There were no visible bruises to mark a fight or an unwanted restraint. Overall it just looked like the man had simply died. Nevertheless, there must have been a significance to this victim. Moriarty wouldn't just put any old body on his doorstep, wouldn't compromise himself if he didn't want to send a message. Sherlock continued his search, looking more closely at the shoes, nice but off the high street, at the suit, same deal, it was altered but not bespoke, showing the necessity to keep up an appearance rather than an interest. "You are remarkable in your unremarkableness" Sherlock murmured "If I didn't know better, I'd say you just were at the wrong place at the wrong time." He crouched lower, getting even closer to the victim’s face, smelling for the traces of poisoning. Nothing. "This is getting tedious" Sherlock mumbled, probing at the man's skin. Even close up there were no traces of an outside force but Moriarty was making deals, so why not make one to kill this man. "That could be not too unreasonable" Sherlock said and stood up.
"How do you mean that?" John asked suddenly very interested, he really wanted to get to one of Sherlock's closely guarded theories.
"You know I could have helped you before" John pointed out as he plucked up the pile Sherlock had referred to. He actually had wondered what he was still doing, sitting around for an hour without Sherlock saying a single word, somewhat feeling superfluous and ignored. That had been something new.
"Just to be sure, we could try out if they work" Sherlock hummed, "Really, just for an emergency"
Sorry, this chapter is quite short but the last one will be pretty long. So I hope you can suffer through two relatively short ones before that extended 4th chapter.
“Hey”, John murmured hushed, pressing his lips to the corner of the young boy’s mouth, “Everything alright?”
"No they definitely shouldn't, especially not something as ridiculous as that." Sherlock sounded a little affronted.
"I'm working on that" Sherlock murmured.
“Are you here with someone?” John continued caring for the new student, after that public display it was the least he needed now “Otherwise you can come and sit with us. You see the girl with the long brown hair there? Just go to her.” He pointed at Molly who’s eyes grew bigger and her expression clearly said ‘Don’t pull me into this, you idiot’. The new student nodded thankful and tried to make his way as quick as possible to where Molly was sitting. He wasn’t the centre of attention anymore either way that was John now.
“Well, it wasn’t quite your style, too soft and careful for your taste. Still, I would argue
---- Act 3 ----
"In what world is that the logical course of action?" John huffed "Not only is it uncaring but also completely idiotic. I'm not giving up the chance to definitely catch him for perhaps catching him earlier. If there is one thing I'm good at it's waiting. I've been doing that for eons."
"Look at where it got you" he groaned into the well-used cushions of his leather couch. When this business was over, if he actually managed to finish it, he might have to think about the whole friends thing again. He liked to play it down, but he was feeling rather lonely. With the drugs his 'friends', speak drug buddies, had disappeared, too. At first, being alone had helped him to concentrate on what he was living for: the work. With the years ticking by he was slowly recognising the error of his ways. Now it was too late to change it. Probably. He had never felt this uncertain before.
There was a moment of silence in which the DI visibly debated with himself if he could go off another of Sherlock's whims. In the past years though they had always been correct, there always had been more evidence and not just Sherlock’s word, but the man had always been right. Eventually, Lestrade took a breath "Okay, but I want your explanation by tomorrow morning and it has to be at least two pages of concise arguments otherwise no one will be convinced."
Sherlock just batted open his eyelashes in response, not having noticed closing his eyes in the first place, and reached out to actively pull John back down. Thus far he had only gone along with what John was doing but if the danger of the other stopping at any time was on the table, he would have to get a bit more active in his role.
"Mrs. Hudson" Sherlock called, re-entering 221 after spending some time at the morgue the next morning. The morgue was his usual excuse for having a few hours out of the flat. His landlady didn't ask any questions about it since it meant, in most cases, the more dangerous experiments were conducted outside her flat. Today, he had used the excuse to present a situation in which he could have met the devil's new human persona. If he wanted to keep the devil living in his flat, he would have to introduce him to Mrs. Hudson at some point. Since he didn't go about making friends all the time, having someone presented to him in the lab of Bart's by an acquaintance seemed to be the best solution.
“Stop thinking”, Sherlock’s voice was deep and still a bit slurred although the pleasure induced fog in his eyes had cleared again, giving them back their cutting edge, “This was way too good for you to be thinking now.”
“Well, yeah but you did it” Molly reminded him, flipping through a book.
“Hey, okay. That’s enough now” he raised his voice over the cutting remarks Sherlock was still delivering, something about the boy’s father being a drunk which was apparently visible in the way the student held his bag. There was an audible gasp as the rest of the people realised what he had just done. John didn’t care much about that and turned towards the young student, he looked barely 18 and was thoroughly frightened.
“For one, you’ll need a chair”, Sherlock hummed and quickly grabbed one of John’s kitchen chairs, spinning it around in the air as if it weighed nothing. “Sit down, having you stand around awkwardly just makes it more difficult.” His voice stayed matter of factly, although it didn’t help to ease off the buzz under John’s skin. He doubted anything would really pull him down right now, as he sat down, looking up. Sherlock had walked around the perimeter of the available open space, probably to familiarise himself with the surroundings.
"So, ehrm" John cleared his throat. He was only slowly relaxing into their new position, still hyper aware of Sherlock's head on his shoulder. "Anything new you got from the little stunt tonight?" It was a cowardice route, talking about the case. John knew it as he tipped the balance into that direction.
"You got that from looking at her for not even a minute?" John asked surprised. Within the year, they had been dealing with this problem, they hadn't gotten past the point of 'Somehow manipulated to sell their souls for someone else’s gain and then don't remember it’.
"Well, if we go with that theory, what sins have we already crossed off the list then?" Lestrade asked and stepped aside so the crime scene photography could get the necessary pictures.
“No, at least if you weren’t referring to their horrible quality.” the man grinned “I was just seeing if I was right.”
"You really are terrible at your job" Sherlock sighed, being reminded of that list gave a little sting, "I can think of at least five more."
"Sherlock, I have been in yours and Inspector Lestrade's company already. As much as you might be able to tolerate him, it shows that your mind grinds at the idea of him doing any justice to your thought process in his reports."
“Originally, I did this to prove that my dancing is worth more than a
“I can’t argue with that,” John laughed and tipped his head back to give Sherlock a bit more space.
In the end, it had cost a few jabs more than Sherlock had planned on. Lestrade just had been particularly stubborn that day. Nevertheless, he could soon delve into a mountain of files, quickly skimming them all and dividing as he went. He was too aware of John's presence in the room. It was unnerving and exhilarating at the same time. Sherlock felt like his mind was much more on track, more focused on what was in front of him, quicker at observing the important and making a decision. John's simple, quiet presence worked like a magnifying glass. With a shudder Sherlock realised this feeling was close to what cocaine had brought him, at least in the beginning. He quickly pushed the thought aside.
"I could call him but then he'd know it wasn't her." Sherlock smirked and sent the message. It was a long shot, granted, but it was better than nothing. Perhaps their criminal was ready for some publicity.
John’s whimper had apparently been enough to convince Sherlock of another tactic, since he chuckled. “Well, it’s getting late so perhaps we should get on with it.”
"This is your grand plan?" John asked a bit dubiously after he had set up a mountain of blankets and cushions on the floor which Sherlock used to sit and rest his leg.
“Then keep your moral high ground but get out of my sight”
“I doubt it was just beer.” the dark haired scoffed, then extended his hand, “Sherlock Holmes.”
"Just give this a chance and believe me when the next victim turns up on your doorstep" Sherlock insisted, pushing the files a little further over the table.
As the minutes ticked by slowly, John had some time to think back. He was curious about what he could expect, there was no way to deny that. What Sherlock had done in the club, had been… pretty. John had appreciated how the long, sinuous body had twisted and turned to the music, highlighting perfectly defined muscles and just poking a bit at your imagination. Sarah had been totally enthralled by it and none of the girls had really stopped talking for long about that show afterwards. Anna really had landed a hit. Still, Sherlock’s words were ghosting through John’s mind ‘
While he was running errands for Sherlock, John had been caught up in his mind just mechanically buying everything that was on his list and a few things he just thought might be handy to have. When his practice had taken up shape the topic of an Omega had been broached by his mother numerous times. For a moment he had even thought that he could do it, get a young Omega just to have them out of the traditional claws, perhaps fund them an education and let them get a life they wanted. But he had scraped that thought just as quickly as it had come. They would still be bonded to him against their will and never have the freedom to find someone their own age to love and cherish. With that the topic had been closed for him but how the young man who was currently in his flat showed, his mother had just been waiting for an opportune moment to push the whole dilemma back on him. He really needed to find out more about the circumstances of the deal. That all could wait until after he had made sure that Sherlock was as comfortable as possible. He might not have wanted an Omega but now that he had the frightened boy at home, he would care for him. His medical self wouldn’t let anything else be good enough.
“Touch me”, Sherlock growled. His voice having the raspy edge of someone who just had pushed his body through a bit of a work out.
"That's nice. Hello, dearie" Mrs. Hudson beamed and shook John's hand, "There is a second room upstairs if you'll be needing two"
John headed off to Regent's Park. When he had left the flat, he didn't have that aim in mind. He just wanted to leave through the door, so he would actually be free to go wherever he pleased. Apparently, he had already spend too much time on earth, his feet carrying him to the park. It seemed like something he would do if he were human: Taking a walk when Sherlock was particularly insufferable. Being around other humans who cared particularly little about who he was, helped him calm his temper. It had been centuries since he had last cared about the earth. He had just disregarded it as a place full of boredom. Sherlock had forced him to take a closer look. London really was a pulsating city, letting good and evil and all in between clash. John found that he loved it. It was so much more intriguing than the ins and outs of his life. Sherlock's dazzling intellect just made it all shine brighter. John had felt like an outcast wherever he had been his entire life. His current situation just highlighting all the flaws that had accumulated over the eons. Sherlock had simply picked out whatever information he needed and disregarded everything else as boring. John had felt strangely accepted by him. It made their current situation hurt even more. The feeling was strange, he was the devil after all, still he had to admit that with every minute his clarity continued to return, he more and more felt like his outburst had been misplaced. After all, he had only hired Sherlock because all other methods had failed him. Trying to force the other in a direction would just lead to another failure and slowly, John couldn't afford more time passing.
Around them a deep silence settled as Sherlock was clearly stuck in thoughts. John felt more than a bit awkward, on the couch next to Sherlock while the other seemed miles away in his head. It made John be stuck in his own, too and it wasn't a place he wanted to be in at the moment. There were just too many thoughts coursing through it for a stay to be comfortable. Additionally, their seating arrangement was slowly testing John's restrain. Sherlock was near, vulnerable and not paying attention. If he wasn't careful, John could use all of it without meaning to. He only noticed that his fingers were twitching on his legs when he suddenly felt a soft weight settle over them. Sherlock had reached out his own hand, laying it on top of John's nervous fingers. The warmth spread through John's arm and he wasn't yet sure if it made his position better, more difficult definitely.
"Oh god, are you sure dear? Shouldn't we call an ambulance first?"
"So, there are disembodied body parts floating all through hell? What kind of place do you live in?"
"Alone is what I have. Alone is what protects me" it came so blandly, John almost took it as a joke until he saw that Sherlock was just working, not smiling, not smirking, not giving any indication that it had been meant as a joke.
A rough pull later, the other was back on his lap, their mouths pressed together hastily. Their bodies fitting back together in the new position seamlessly. Like this John could feel that long body again, holding him with one arm, the other hand still buried in that nest of curls. He would never let go of them.
"You sure you could convince me?" Sherlock asked, tilting his head slightly to the side with an inquisitive gaze. "I'm a pretty hard person to convince, or so I've been told."
“You know this whole thing is a bit anticlimactic” John remarked and turned around, looking at the room he had stumbled into. Most of the walls were covered in dark, old bookshelves which were stuffed full of all different kinds of books, definitely not only Volumes that would be necessary for the other’s field of study. There was a skull on the mantelpiece and one on the wall, wearing headphones. The coffee table seemed to overflow with random notes and papers. The flat looked lived in but there seemed to be no trace of anyone else sharing the space. So at least one of the things you heard was true. If you were able to afford a flat all on your own near University in London, then you had to come from money.
"I only do what they ask for" Sherlock hummed and brushed past Lestrade into the flat. It practically screamed 'up to rent' at him. Nothing had been left out which made the dead body in the middle of the living room a little more strange. Usually, he had at least some clues from the environment to go off of. This was again just the corpse. Slowly, it was getting annoying. Couldn't their culprit take at least one misstep? He hadn't even answered to Sherlock's text after the last one. By now, Sherlock was fed up with finding out who did this. Perhaps he just needed to take a different approaches on this one.
"They gave me a transfusion and all was fine again." Sherlock muttered grumpily. The pain was pulling at the edges of his mind and he was cursing his past addiction problem which prohibited him from getting any real painkillers. He wasn't looking forward to the next days of moving as little as possible in order to keep it manageable. Besides which he would need to devise a new tactic to go about the Moriarty case. John hadn't seemed to be in a hurry to take up whatever loose ends had been left when Sherlock was shot. Rather worryingly he had stayed by Sherlock's side. He felt that they would have quite some down-time now to figure out what mess they've gotten themselves into.
The next day, John had been busying himself with cleaning the flat a bit. He couldn't stand Mrs. Hudson coming up and doing those basic tasks for them, especially when they were both perfectly able to. It had taken him approximately ten minutes to stumble across a pile of brown folders which he recognised to be the same kind as the ones NYS used.
“You honestly believed that?” John asked “I’ve seen his flat, I doubt anyone would go in there on a voluntary basis much less to have sex. With the acid on the table, and I doubt that was the only dangerous thing in there, that flat is a disaster waiting to happen”
The evening stretched out in front of Sherlock like a never-ending abyss. By all rights he should be deep in trying to line out the groundworks of his new case but he couldn't bring himself to do so. His body had prepared for a night of down time after a case. He knew he liked to ignore biological needs such as food and sleep. This meant, after every case he usually needed a night to restore his reserves. Now, he had to go directly from one case to another.
“What are you doing here if I may ask?” a smooth voice inquired from out of nowhere.
"And in what way won't you be able to stay within the contract? I don't see you stop working." John pointed out carefully.
“No you are being dramatic”
"Perhaps the case is not going like he wants it. Who knows?"
John gently placed his hands around Sherlock's face, smoothing one thumb across a sharp cheekbone, "Because you've done enough to redeem your soul twice over." He pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock's forehead and murmured, "Everybody needs a little help sometimes and I don't want you to reject it because of a formality."
"But why send him here? Because he was greedy in life? What has this to do with anything? Or has Moriarty suddenly taking a liking to help old ladies not get ripped off by slimy insurance brokers?" Sherlock was slowly getting on thin ice, he needed any kind of straw to clasp at and pull this back into something he could investigate.
Hastily John turned around to face the other person in the room.
"It's not how it works." Sherlock growled "I figure out the reason, I can figure out where he is, most likely."
