, though,” he echoed, chuckling lightly. Of course Steve would think of something as simple as a movie and a bit of fresh air. Strangely enough, it sounded perfect.
“Nuh-uh,” Tony mumbled against Steve’s lips, while pointing a finger at Bruce. “Keep rubbing, Big Green. You owe me like… eighty million dollar for Wakanda alone.”
Steve watched Tony from the short distance between them. Tony's movements were all languid and graceful and he felt an attraction to him that was, it seemed, beyond normal. He ate him up with his eyes and did nothing to hide it. When he had Tony's attention, he gave a curt nod.
Lowering the hand from his face, Steve set it firmly on Tony's shoulder and pushed him onto his back before shifting to rest some of his weight on top of him. He stared Tony in the eye for a brief moment, then shook his head, his eyes closing.
He’d seen it all, not caring very much. He’d watched history unfold, and waited for the next order to arrive, only mildly interested in the disasters human kind wreaked upon itself.
A tight heat engulfed him only seconds later and Steve moaned his surprise loudly into the otherwise still room. He heard Tony chuckle and the vibrations around his erection almost made him lose it then and there.
Bucky and Natasha started laughing before Steve had even finished talking. They were already used to hearing that line, it was their usual whenever someone asked where—or more importantly
“I don’t regret what I did,” she said quietly, before she stepped through the door. “And you can’t hate me forever.”
Pepper and Rhodey both cast him wide grins, raising their glasses when he turned to look at them, and even Obi struggled for an approving expression.
Steve swallowed. “Not… really.” His gaze didn’t waver, but he dropped his eyes eventually, and sighed. “For as long as I can remember I… I was used to not getting what I wanted for myself. I was alright with the fact that my responsibilities came first. My friends, my team… everyone. But now… knowing that this might be mine… makes me worry I won’t get it, you know?”
So in the days after Lagos, the emergency plan they’d formed in case of another incident rolled into high gear the instant Tony, Maria and Pepper had started making phone calls. They had split into groups and had set up round the clock attendance, trying to keep the truce with the UN intact.
At that he unfolded the paper Steve had tried to scrunch up, and let his eyes drift over the scribbles. Over Steve’s neat handwriting, the few scratched out words, but also…
And with those two words, the world outside ceased to exist. Steve all but dragged him into the bathroom, his hands roaming freely across Tony’s body. If there had ever been a point when Steve had been modest about this, it was definitely over now.
Tony’s eyes watered, as their thrusts grew harder and more frantic. Steve was going to knock the life out of him, but Tony didn’t care. At this point, nothing mattered but staying as close to him as he could.
While they got ready for bed, the television was still running. With people’s smartphones and security cameras and even satellites, the news station had covered the scene from every angle, showing over and over again how Rumlow had killed himself, and how Wanda had thrown the explosion right into the building where relief aid workers had been trying to do their job.
She held up a hand in a placating gesture. “I’m not asking for details, I just wanted you to know that whatever happened between the two of you… it’s your life. I think you should finally start thinking about yourselves. Put yourselves first, that’s all.”
Throwing his shield into the far distance towards three of Klaue’s armed guards, Steve noticed a swift movement right behind him. It was the same sort of air blast that always preceded a punch right to the face. Pietro Maximoff—only this time, Steve saw him coming. He turned around while raising his hand to catch the shield in time, bringing it up and smashing it right into—
“I know,” Steve replied. He pressed his erection against Tony’s bottom, teasing his rim before pulling back again.
They were sitting in a café near the church, having a last coffee together with the team, before Bucky would leave for New York, and the rest of them would travel to Vienna.
Tony whirled around, and he could almost believe Thanos’ face had frozen with the beginning of a smirk on his lips, when a final blast came loose from the last remaining stone.
Sam huffed. “Are you kidding me? Steve would beat me seven ways from Sunday if I’d let you get hurt.”
His body rubbed sinuously against the length of him, pressing down hard and demanding. Tony moaned and his body arched into him, thighs parting to accommodate him, shifting to grip his waist as his hands raked his back and shoulders and biceps, kneading his flesh.
“That line is getting old,” Tony retorted bitterly. He stared up at the ceiling of his bedroom. “Was it the way to go when you decided to rip everything we had apart? To look at the one chance that could’ve kept the team together, and decide to damn it all to hell? That the way you’re talking about?”
of them accepts, they’ll all come. They’ll be too afraid to miss something big. And they’d be damn right about it.”
A sharp pang struck deep inside and the air around Tony grew thick. Tears threatened to overwhelm him again, but he refused to shed them. He’d cried for hours on Titan, his fingers brushing along the soft ashes on the ground. He’d cried all the way over to Earth.
Those days seemed so long ago now, nothing but a distant memory. Nowadays, his responsibilities never ceased, and it seemed the obstacles thrown their way were getting larger every time.
Tony was retreating. The look on his face was… It seemed desperate, but how could that be? Didn't he want to stick around? To test if the antidote worked for Steve as well? This kind of behavior just didn't make sense. Unless…
Tony nodded. He turned to leave again, then stopped. Steve watched as he clenched and unclenched the hand at his side, but eventually, Tony put the same hand on his shoulder, lingering for a moment.
Tony sighed. “Bucky Barnes’ old unit was captured in ’43. Zola experimented on him. And I guess that… whatever Zola did, might’ve helped Barnes survive the fall in Italy. And the years that followed.”
“There,” Clint chimed in before Steve could say anything more. “It’s the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge.” He paused for a moment. “It’s them. I got three with the cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.”
He didn’t finish, because the next thing he knew, Tony had all but tackled him to the roof’s surface. His legs were slotted around his waist, his arms firmly linked behind his neck. And he was kissing him. Kissing him with relief and giddiness and a few light chuckles in-between.
“All right,” Fury said then, drawing a deep breath. “Mister Stane… obviously you have some thoughts as to what this letter means. Please enlighten us.”
“I never heard you play,” Steve said, feeling a bit bad that he’d never asked. He’d seen old photographs of Maria and little Tony sitting at the piano together, but it had never once crossed his mind that Tony might still be able to play.
Tony shrugged, unapologetically. “There’s only so many ways to find out if someone swings your way. Showing some skin and seeing if you’re being ogled is one of the easier ones.”
And yet, Steve didn’t want to think about the inevitable end of their relationship when they’d only just touched the beginning. Before they’d had to part ways again, they had a series of moments together that Steve wanted to fill with happiness. Something he wanted Tony to carry with him for the rest of his immortal life.
“Not all that good, apparently,” Tony countered, and it was always like this with him. He was bold and flashy and his words were meant to show that he didn’t care either way, but beneath all that, he was the most vulnerable person Steve had ever come across.
, Tony thought with a small nod. A drunk mind speaks a sober heart and all, right? He believed Steve when he said he wanted this now, and that… would have to be enough. At least Tony knew what he was getting himself into. He just had to brace himself for impact as soon as Steve’s moral compass set into motion once again.
“I know,” Steve said and tried for a smile as he leaned down and kissed Tony’s lips softly. “I was so worried.”
When Tony arrived at the common floor, Rhodey and Barnes were standing nose to nose, arguing loudly.
“You sure you don’t want to take a nap?” Sam asked quietly as he made to stand up. He’d been sitting at Steve’s side for hours without complaining. “I could stay a little while longer.”
Impatiently, Tony grabbed Steve’s ass, fingers digging into his skin. Steve nuzzled the back of Tony’s neck, breathing heavily through his nose, knowing the effect that had on his nerves.
“That was the single most erotic thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Tony whispered, breaking the silence and brushing a small, tender kiss across Steve’s heart.
it open. And in the darkness, Steve spotted Iron Man’s angry eyes. For the first time since meeting Tony, he raised his shield in defense.
But those days were over. For good. The new department was now officially introduced, the investors were lining up to throw money at the company, giving a nice closure to Tony’s first quarter as Stark Industries’ CEO.
Wanda Maximoff stepped up next to Steve. Her eyes were calculating and pensive as she looked upwards. She raised her hands in front of her, the red starting to wave around Ultron’s head.
It was strange to see them like this. Not that Tony wasn’t an attractive guy, but… he had never been an option, had he? And even if that changed at some point… it was just completely unfathomable how two people who were so different could ever want to spend the rest of their days together.
sometimes. Of course, the mischievousness sparkling in his eyes right now was one of the reasons why he loved this guy so much, but
Instead of looking pleased, Tony’s face tightened even more. He cast his lashes down so that Steve couldn’t see his eyes. Then, the corner of his mouth twisted into a grimace. “I guess we should.”
He closed his faceplate again and brought his thrusters to full speed, following them. When he flew past Steve, he caught his arms and raised him up into the air.
,” Bucky shouted at him over the noise, but when Steve turned to him, his eyes were practically sparkling with glee.
“You want me, Captain?” Tony asked. He bit at Steve’s lips again. “You wanna fuck me? Or do you like it the other way around, hm? Like to go on your knees and—”
Barnes only regarded him briefly from where he sat hunched against the Jacuzzi. He didn’t look surprised at all and only turned around to once more look at his own reflection in the wall-mirror. The bionic arm was hanging limp at his side, there was a small cut on his cheek, and some light bruising on his human arm. He looked completely out of place in the luxurious bathroom. Steve had done his best to make the room a little less clean-cut and a bit more homey, but it hadn’t thoroughly eradicated the minimalistic atmosphere.
His words, however, clearly surprised Tony. He blinked, then stared at Steve as if he only now saw him. His eyes burned while sizing him up—and good Lord, if this was a dream it sure all felt very real.
Steve couldn’t fathom it. He stood up and took a step closer, staring at the ring on Tony’s finger. And sure enough, it was a wedding band—simple and elegant, one Steve could imagine himself buying in a heartbeat. “We’re… married?”
“They’ll be okay,” Bruce said next to him. He heaved a great breath, and the typing stopped. “This isn’t working. If we had more time…”
Tony smiled at him. “Trust me, okay?” He leaned in, bathing kisses down Steve’s throat, one hand caressing Steve’s back soothingly as the other brought him into position. “We’ll go as slow as you need.”
As soon as Tony felt Steve clenching around him in a vice grip, felt the wetness between their bodies, he gave his thrusts more momentum. He’d been close the moment he’d pushed into Steve for the first time, the flesh around him too hot and definitely too tight to not bring him close to coming right away. And with the way Steve tightened around him further now, encasing him in warm velvet, Tony knew he wouldn’t last another minute.
"No, Bucky. I—" Steve lifted his chin. "I didn’t give him anything. That friend of mine looked out for me and told me his age right away. I wouldn’t…" He crossed his arms and sighed. "Cute kid, but not someone I could ever consider. Even if he weren't underage, he's a student and I'm a staff member. I'd get fired so hard I'd never be able to find another job in this field."
He felt Steve grin against his skin. His hand slowly trailed downwards, blindly reaching for the towel around Tony’s hip and loosening the knot until it fell off of Tony’s body. His fingers made circling motions upwards, until his palm was brushing over Tony’s erect cock.
“You’re kissing me,” Tony murmured, regaining some ground. There would be a moment to cry his heart out, but that moment clearly wasn’t now.
He couldn’t fathom why, but each day, he was getting a bit more anxious as to what would await him in Stark Mansion.
“I love you,” Steve whispered against Tony’s ear, because that was the one thing that was undoubtedly still true. Then, he closed his eyes.
“Has been going on for a while.” Steve glanced sideways to Bucky. “I’ve meant to tell you, but…” He trailed off, noticing the attentive but otherwise very unsurprised look on his friend’s face. Natasha sported about the same expression, and Clint hadn’t even bothered to turn around from his seat in the cockpit.
"Tony?" he called after him, but it didn't slow him down. If anything, Tony seemed to be more in a hurry than before. Steve followed, but by the time he reached the elevator, the doors had closed.
Steve paced the length of the Quinjet restlessly. It seemed that if he didn’t stop moving even for a moment, then it would all have been a dream. A nightmare maybe. But a dream nonetheless.
“Tell me to stop and I will,” Steve said, his free hand tugging on Tony’s legs until he wrapped them around Steve’s waist. Sound drowned away in favor of their mingled gasps, Steve’s fingers setting to work, and his brilliant blue eyes consuming him whole.
"Close…" he whispered, eyes closed and heart pounding. Soon after, when Tony changed his angle a little and thrust a bit harder, Steve's body coiled, and his release was so sudden, so deep, that he couldn't even let out the strangled sound stuck in his throat. It spilled out of him moments after his warm essence coated their bellies, and he couldn't help the shudders of aftershocks if he'd tried.
There was an endless moment of silence. Tony just stared at him, the wings twitching ever so slightly. Then, there was a wordless, agonized sound in Tony’s throat and kissed Steve again, almost painfully hard, over and over again, his mouth devouring Steve’s. And, oh, the taste of him, the feel of him, the long slides of that sinful, knowledgeable tongue against Steve’s. No one had ever kissed him like Tony, so passionately, his mouth so eloquent with everything that he was feeling. Tony kissed with his whole body, so focused on Steve that the whole world spun away and there was nothing left but them.
At first, Steve was just relieved that Bucky was no longer in his cell. But seeing him sitting in the living room, wearing colorful sweatpants and a t-shirt, watching what looked a lot like ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ while Natasha was stretched across the sofa with her head resting on his lap, still in her pyjamas… that was something else entirely.
When he settled in his bed with the too-soft mattress, his eyes were so heavy he fell asleep the second his head hit the pillow.
A grin broke onto Steve's face, then. A confession to a sleeping man. He shook his head at the sweet memory. That was such a Tony thing to do. Stretching a little, he turned to leave the bathroom and wandered closer to the bed, eyeing Tony's form—draped in his bed covers and still naked—with hunger that would never be properly quenched. "So, breakfast, or more cuddles?"
“It is,” Tony said, sighing. “So you didn’t want to be impolite and decided to go to the one place that would one hundred percent, no doubt whatsoever, get you into prison if anyone saw you?”
Fuck—this was ridiculous. He wouldn’t be falling for Steve in the future, he was already right there, wasn’t he? Believing in fate, though, that was something Tony just couldn’t do. It was too much of a romantic notion. All of these patterns, choices and opportunities, as if his life had been designed to bring him here, to meet this version of Steve that would make him see how good they could be together?
Tony wasn’t sure if he should answer that, but then again, why the hell not. “Guess we needed a break, too,” he said meekly, smiling. “Not many of us around anymore.”
Should he tell him about the visions? No, probably not a good time. He didn't feel he knew enough about them, yet. Not enough to bring it up and discuss it at length, but what if Tony had some intel from Natasha and Clint that Steve wasn't aware of? He'd been avoiding pretty much everyone over the past couple of days. For all he knew, there was an absolutely logical reason why the others had gotten visions of real memories, and Steve got something… else.
The creature they were fighting looked, for lack of a better description, like a huge predator plant that had both teeth and a trap, and
It felt like much more time than just half an hour had passed when the Quinjet finally touched down on the rooftop of Avenger Tower. Steve ran straight into the elevator, and then into Tony’s workshop a few floors below. By then, he had envisioned about every possible scenario, what he
“Tony Stark is standing in front of me with a baby in his arms. And he’s not trying to run away,” Phil mused to himself. “My past self would probably be having a laughing fit right now.”
Steve rolled his eyes and moved away. “Nice try, but we gotta at least say hello properly, stay a couple of hours. I could be persuaded to leave early, though.”
“It’s not helping… my being here. I’m just the rain on the parade.” He paused, his hand on the railing as he glanced up at the Helicarriers. For weeks, Tony had been elbow-deep into constructing the new repulsor engines. He hadn’t known about the weapons, though. Steve was sure of that. Tony wouldn’t keep something like that from him. “I won’t agree on this. You don’t need me.”
“It definitely is,” Steve said, grinning before he planted a wet and open-mouthed kiss on Tony’s tight-pressed mouth, then blindly slapped a hand on the elevator’s button. Instead of pulling back, Tony fake-moaned, loud and very obscene, before he poked his tongue out and swiped it all across Steve’s lower lip. Steve simply kept kissing him, laughing.
He hadn’t been here often. They had repurposed the room as a small library and art room when it was clear that a gym up here wouldn’t be meeting Steve’s standards. It was mostly Steve’s room, had always been, and after only a step across the threshold, Steve’s scent reached Tony’s nose.
But he wouldn’t. Invading Tony’s privacy like this was unthinkable. Determined, Steve grabbed the letters and pushed them into one of the many drawers. There was a slight resistance though, and Steve frowned as he looked down to see what the problem was. The bottom of the drawer was slightly askew.
“How many minutes can you be late before Fury will rip me a new one?” Tony asked, and stepped closer, making Steve’s breath hitch in return.
He didn’t know when Tony had come so close; all he knew was that his hands had closed around his upper arms and his mouth was on Steve’s in a hard, almost demanding kiss. The contact was so sudden that Steve didn’t realize what had happened until Tony’d released him.
He looked at the dimly lit room he lived in. Everything was exactly as he'd left it when he went to bed. Everything was very still. He was in his apartment in Mass, and it was—he glanced at the digital clock across the room—four thirty in the morning.
Realizing that, Tony opened his eyes all the way. That weight on his waist was an arm that was wrapped around his middle and his legs were somehow tangled in Steve’s. They were spooned together tightly on the floor, a thin white blanket draped over their bodies.
“You are late. Again,” Nat exclaimed as she pointed accusingly at Bucky. “We’ve got to be at the hangar in five minutes.”
Clint hummed in agreement, then bit his lower lip. “Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Laura and the kids. I know we promised to be honest with each other.”
“I’m beginning to see that,” Steve admitted, and he hated this, because he knew that without HYDRA, those people might’ve had a chance. But Tony was right—they couldn’t afford to keep their morals in check right now.
It didn’t exactly hurt. Tony had stretched him for long minutes, but the feeling was still a lot to handle.
Of course they would, Steve thought. His future self had worked with a functioning team for years. He
It was such a strange thrill to feel Tony's nakedness only against his dick, and when his fingers traced between Tony's cheeks, probing gently at his entrance, he couldn't help the hitch in his breath and how easily his finger slipped inside. "So ready…" he mumbled against Tony's lips, then pulled back and put both hands on Tony's shoulders. "Bend over the bench."
Tony swallowed, trying not to do a happy dance right then and there, because Oh. My. God. That was—he’d never thought there would ever be the chance to get what he wanted. Sure, yes, it was just a theoretical chance, but a chance all the same. Months—
Steve’s hand was firm around his, his thumb massaging circles into his skin. They were all here, lying side by side, and Tony knew, this would be a moment he’d think about forever.
Looking down, Steve felt his insides twist with the sudden want to be able to do that all the time. He wanted to soak up Tony’s warmth; wanted to take him in his arms and hold him close enough so that their memories became one.
Steve flushed again. He leaned in just the tiny bit further, breathing in Tony’s skin, the warmth of his throat, and—on a second thought—pressed the most innocent kiss against his pulse point.
Steve smiled as he placed his hands on Tony’s legs, pulling them further up until they were practically thrown over his shoulders.
Was she afraid? Afraid of what Steve would think of her? Now that he knew she was an actual demon and not just a really badass bounty hunter?
Well, two months and sixteen days if you wanted to be nitpicky and count the two days it had taken Tony to actually accept that
At some point they’d be saved—or they had to make a life for them here. The cycle would continue whether or not he was paying attention, and he liked to think that it wasn’t better to know just how many days they’ve spent under this otherworldly sun.
“The fake doctor is Colonel Helmut Zemo. Sokovian intelligence. Zemo ran EKO Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.”
declaring his feelings. Those weeks might’ve been just as much an eye-opener for him as they had been for Steve. Maybe he wasn’t alone in this sudden turmoil of feelings after all.
They hadn’t argued much afterwards, Steve had been too busy ensuring that Tony was alright after what the man had thrown at him. It didn’t mean they wouldn’t have to talk about it soon.
“Tony…” he started, hesitating as he searched for the right words. “About Stane. I—I think there’s something wrong with him.”
Stepping into the Morning Room, Steve heaved a great breath. He liked it here, no matter if Stane said the room was a poor substitute for the rooms in the west wing. He dropped his sketchbook on the great desk and sat down. The desk was made of fine wood, mahogany maybe, and it looked almost regal. On top of the wood finish lay a new box of fine pens and a stack of letters Steve hadn’t noticed before.
“I…” Tony said then, clearing his throat a little awkwardly. “I don’t think I can take you again tonight, I mean
“We gotta go help them,” Steve said. “We can’t let Rumlow get away with that weapon. But afterwards…” He stared at Tony. “You’ll have some explaining to do.”
Tomorrow, the sun would rise and his life would begin anew. Begin as it never had before. And Steve… Steve was going to be with him when he awoke, and then, they would both finally get that break from their daily chaos that they so richly deserved.
Tony, the man he’d met in his dreams back in 1943 was standing in front of him, seventy years later, and was somehow his team member, ready to fight an alien God at his side.
Natasha clung to his shoulders and let out a mewl when he twisted his hips, rubbing the tip of his cock against a sensitive spot inside her. Settling his hand on Nat’s ass, he walked their connected bodies to the bed. Natasha released a breathless laugh as he pushed her onto the bed. Standing back up, he removed his boots and then slipped his pants off his ankles.
Steve sighed as he made his way towards the Commando Bridge. “I’m nearing the console. Tell JARVIS to get off my back, Tony, we talked about this.”
Tony smiled, putting a hand on Sam’s shoulder in understanding. “Trust me, Steve could read you the phone book and it’d have some motivational ring to it. It’s… it’s the whole milk and all that fresh air. At least, that’s my guess… which is as good as any.”
"Okay." Bucky sighed, downing what remained of his drink and calling for another. "It's a big deal for you." He turned to look at Steve, leaning his elbow on the counter and a little towards Steve. "But if you're only getting riled up on my account, don't."
A small statement. Four little words. Nothing specific, and yet they all knew exactly what he was talking about. Steve wasn’t aware that he had been staring at Natasha until she shifted uncomfortably and averted her eyes with a note of the same.
Steve rolled his eyes at the slightly hysterical tone in Tony's voice. As if he'd care how Tony had gotten to his island. As if that dimmed the time they'd spent there after their wedding. As if that could possibly be worse than what Tony had done with Ultron.
“Her rings, bracelets she always wore... They’ll identify her body,” Tony explained. “Then they’ll remember the other woman, the woman buried in the crypt. And they’ll know I lied.”
It would be easy to blame everything on SHIELD and Stark Industries. After all, it was the combination of their time-consuming jobs that had them both make the decision to live in different cities for a couple of months. In the end, though, it had been he who’d said yes to Fury and sometimes… and it was probably weak to feel like it… he regretted that decision.
“I see,” Tony said. When Steve’s gaze snapped back to him, he wasn’t looking at him anymore, but instead to the window.
Alright, his future self had given him a mission. An easy enough mission, from the sound of it. Retrieve a highly experimental time machine from some dark looming castle in the middle of nowhere, without the owner of said dark looming castle noticing, and switch both Steves back.
The mission Steve had been talking about, the mission they’d apparently face tomorrow, had to be their raid on Strucker’s base in Sokovia. The one where they’d gather Loki’s scepter.
The years had taught him many things—namely to trust his senses, and seeing Steve leave without him? It just felt wrong on so many levels.
Sorry! Thanks so much for the lovely feedback, I'm so happy you like the story so far. Final chapter will be up sometime next week.
Tony murmured something unintelligible, though Steve thought he’d heard something close to ‘Fuck off, Elsa’, then he basically hugged the coffee machine until it produced what had to be a triple espresso.
“I’m afraid he already knows,” Agent Romanoff said and the sympathy on the woman’s face was almost unbearable.
The others arrived back at the camp about an hour later. After dinner, they all sat outside for a little while longer, staring out into the mountains until the light was gone. They talked about college, about plans for next Christmas, about spending the next holidays together. Through it all, Tony was uncharacteristically quiet, only talking when directly prompted. He seemed… lighter, but there was still something pulling him down—and Steve had no idea what it was.
Tony snorted. “I am, trust me, I am. I’m… this is already better than everything I’ve ever done before.”
Order. Chaos. Destruction. Victory. Defeat. Those were all things Tony controlled now. And while that had worried Steve at first, he knew… Tony was good to the core. He cared about people more than he cared about himself.
Immediately, he raised his son into the air, laughing and pressing kisses against his cheeks. “You can
jackass Steve had ever met. His words really should inspire revulsion—not exhilaration. Steve should be clenching his fists in rage, not feeling himself stiffen at Tony’s intense stare.
There was no reaction. There was nothing at all. Bucky was blocking the way to the targeting console—and time was running out on him.
Yesterday, they’d scouted the area together one more time, and apart from that: They hunted and fished, washed their clothes, they built and ate and slept. Tony continually worked on their shelter, improved it with tools he’d found in the penthouse, while Steve cooked over the fire. When they were not doing that, they were taking shelter from the storms that were slowly getting worse. And when they were not doing that, they were doing the rest all over again.
Howard said, and Steve stared at him disbelievingly, at his old friend, and it felt a lot like looking at a stranger. How he couldn’t see the hurt and loneliness in Tony’s expression was beyond Steve.
“Yes, Steve?” JARVIS asked, making Steve smile a little. He was the only one JARVIS called by his first name, Tony included, and Steve couldn’t help but feel a little honored every time he did so.
This one wasn’t, but it had still given him so much. There was warmth across the icy plains of his heart and though a part of him withered at awakening in an empty bed, the larger part of him was rejuvenated.
Steve breathed a probably too-large sigh of relief. Everything would be okay. He was absolutely not alone and everything would be fine.
For a long moment, Steve stayed where he was, perched over Tony, but he pulled himself up after a while to look him over. Tony looked absolutely delicious like this, all pliable and soft and Steve had never seen him like this, not even after blowing him that morning.
“Betty once taught me.” He gestured to the island. “Also, T’Challa’s has a huge library and I was bored.”
“Sure, you—” He couldn’t talk anymore, because the next second, his lips were covered with Tony’s. As Steve closed his eyes and opened his mouth to deepen the kiss, he forgot all of the reasons why he’d ever believed this wasn’t exactly what he wanted. Steve’s hands wandered up to tangle in his hair, to stroke his face. Finally, he broke off and rested his forehead against Tony’s.
“I really wouldn’t mind sleeping outside,” Steve offered quietly, coming to a stand next to Tony. He knew he was standing on shaky ground, but he couldn’t just let Tony do this all on his own without even trying to help. “You know my ma and I were camping all the time…”
He was stalling, they both knew it. Facing Stark after everything… it wasn’t exactly on his list of things to look forward to.
Natasha nodded in agreement, first looking at Maria, then at Coulson. “You of all people ought to know that what he’s going through demands privacy. What he needs right now is rest and quiet.”
“I’ll stay in hearing range. I won’t be gone long,” Steve answered, then swallowed down the last of his meal and stood up.
He had already fanned the embers into a blaze by the time Steve got to the firepit. Tony looked up at him, then squatted on his heels beside the fire.
Steve was starting to have. But when all was said and done, Steve was worried, and decided to check up on him. So when he couldn't stand the nagging voice in the back of his head any longer, he already found himself walking towards the Science Faculty.
, he needed to cherish this moment, and he needed Tony to believe they could still be happy together.
But the smaller, more reasonable voice reminded him that this was something Steve had to work through eventually. And he would. He knew Steve well enough that he could almost see the plan formulating behind his eyes; the promise to free Barnes, damn all the obstacles. Steve always kept his word. And nothing short of a shot to the heart could keep him from doing what he thought was right.
“I have to go,” Steve said, forcing himself to hold himself upright. “I don’t wanna see you again.” With that, he brushed Tony’s hands off, and couldn’t look at him. Couldn’t be held when he knew. He’d
In the next few hours, Steve watched as Tony put the plan into action, the rest of the team simply trusting him to do the right thing. They all worked together like a well-oiled machine, never once questioning each other’s intentions, never once doubting they could do it.
“Goddammit,” he muttered once it got a bit too much. He stilled his movements as he tried to get himself back under control. He felt his whole self being centered to his middle, all the blood in his body going very much south, and he was
Wincing a bit at the stiffness in his muscles, Tony rubbed a hand over his face. He walked down the hallway leading to Barnes’ cell, glancing into the examination rooms as he went. They were all empty. Of course the one time Tony had to come down here was the day Steve decided to actually sleep in their bed.
Honestly, he was so fed up with all of this. At first, it had almost been funny. But soon enough, funny turned into annoying. He couldn’t stop thinking about how great the sex had been, how great touching Steve and being touched by him had felt. And how truly great just talking to him had made him feel. It was that sort of magnetic pull that was hard to miss and, apparently, even harder to ignore. And now, a feeling of longing had made itself at home in his gut, and Tony couldn’t think about anything other than Steve all the damn time.
Steve felt a sudden burst of anger well up inside him. Of course Tony would prefer ignoring all of this instead of just facing what was happening between them. It was so goddamn typical and Steve was about to give him a piece of his mind when he suddenly realized how miserable Tony looked, how completely and utterly
Tony could feel Steve’s heart thudding against him. Pounding. His blue eyes were large and the sight of fresh tears encircled him with a sense of hope.
“For what it’s worth, I think you’ll be good for him,” Pepper said, breaking Steve’s reverie. “For Tony.”
Ian stopped howling when Tony lifted him into his arms, but didn’t stop his fretting. He kept crying, his little breaths hiccupping every couple of moments. “Hey little man, it’s okay, daddy’s got you.”
Happy shook his head with a confused sort of look. “How did all of this happen? Media’s in a fuckin’ frenzy. Some are comparing you guys to terrorists—there’s demonstrations, the NATO called in an emergency meeting, it’s all kinds of crazy.”
He glanced over his shoulder to find Vision standing there, eyes set on them with a sort of apathy that was at once eerie and soothing. "Uh…"
Tony smirked at that. He looked down at his watch, wondering if Steve would already be at home by now. He sighed, throwing his head back and staring at the ceiling. “Honestly, it’s a wonder I’m even functioning these days. You could say something nice about that for a change.”
wrong. He didn’t know what was happening exactly—if what Ultron said was actually true—and not being able to know for sure was absolutely terrifying.
Steve deflected the first with his shield, and barely dodged the second. The third hit his waist, leaving a severe burn mark, and on the fourth, Steve had already reached him, pressing his shield down on Tony’s throat so hard the metal of his helmet cut into his skin.
to be like them,” Bucky snarled, and rammed his metal hand down on the man’s face repeatedly. It wasn’t enough, the Winter Soldier suddenly had both hands around Bucky’s throat, choking him with an insane amount of strength. Quickly, he let go with one hand, and reached for the upper part of Bucky’s metal arm. A grin flashed across his face, and Steve knew what would happen before it did. He twisted the arm, crushed its middle part, and then—to Steve’s horror—ripped it off.
A part of Steve knew he should go—that whatever they said wasn’t meant for his ears. There were secrets he simply wasn’t allowed to unravel.
The second Iron Man’s boots touched down on American soil, he truly grasped the extent of Thanos’ doing. He’d imagined it, of course, about a million times, one scenario worse than the next, but seeing it with his own eyes—seeing what the war lord had done to the planet Tony had sworn to protect—it was even more horrific than he could’ve ever envisioned.
He didn’t remember much of what followed after that. Consciousness was an on and off sensation, but he realized that everyone—even Thor, Bruce and Clint—were in the van with them. They weren’t moving, as far as he could tell. Distantly, he heard Steve yelling at someone about how their priority was getting Tony out of here, not to take hostages. Belatedly, he watched his team fighting off the remaining HYDRA agents, when at once, they all broke off the attack, their attention drawn elsewhere. Acting quickly, lest their attention shift again, Bruce grabbed Tony under his shoulders and pulled him fully onto the backseat.
“Baby, you’re going to have to get up and do this yourself. I think we’ve established by now that I can’t carry you.”
"I want to, don't get me wrong, but it's just…" His eyes fell a little lower than Tony's face, and he stared unseeing as he spoke. "I just need some time to… understand what I saw, I guess?" Finally, he looked away entirely, letting a small smile rise to his face. "I appreciate the offer, though. Might take you up on it later."
Steve had a feeling he knew what Tony was thinking about it. It hurt to even think those words, and voicing them would be even worse, but he didn’t really have a choice.
The idea was, at last, beginning to sink in. This was real. This was a real possibility. Tony Stark was actually asking Steve to come with him.
A few newspapers already began to demonize Tony. He was a monster, they wrote, a monster that had never loved his wife—a man, who had been glad she’d died, so he could take new people to bed. Tony Stark was known to never turn down a chance to surround himself with the most beautiful and famous people, after all. No wonder he’d rushed out to identify a stranger’s body as his wife’s, too eager to forget, too desperate for fresh thighs to part for him.
.” No matter how much he’d trust Steve in the future, no matter if they had somehow become the bestest of best friends—there was absolutely no reason to give Steve access to
The scent of his cologne teased Tony’s nose as their cheeks brushed, and he allowed himself a moment of pure and utter happiness. He inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the scent he’d identified with Steve for as long as he’d known him.
The words embraced Tony’s heart, and he knew then if he'd never known before: Whatever lay ahead was more than worth it. Whatever they had to face would be a fate shared. He felt the strength of Steve’s love encompass him wholly.
came to mind, but Tony angled his face just so, fingertips digging into Steve’s skin, and then Steve didn’t think much anymore.
Glancing at the bottle in his hands, he reminded himself that there was nothing between him and Tony, nothing more than a very tentative, very fragile friendship. That had to be good enough.
Steve hummed, pressing a chaste kiss against Tony’s lips before glancing at his sweatpants. Meanwhile, Tony’s left hand was skating intently down his front to undo the button of his jeans.
He heard Steve calling for him, and a moment later, the door to his cell opened, and Steve was crouching on the bed next to him. There was some sort of alarm blaring, as Steve’s hands pulled him upwards into a sitting position, his back pressed against Steve’s chest.
He turned around and, because he didn’t know how comfortable Steve was with making their whatever-it-was official yet, he awkwardly petted his shoulder. “You got this, right? I forgot I have this… thing… in the workshop. I’ll be up again for dinner later.”
His technique was almost as good as Steve’s, and that was something that he refused to take lightly. He sat his shield back on his back and flung the helmet on the ground—eternally grateful that Tony was already on his private jet right now, because it was pretty safe to say he wouldn’t approve.
Sam, Barnes and Natasha weren’t here yet, but it was only a matter of minutes now, then Steve would be sent back to his own time.
She was silent for a minute, her hands caressing the shoulder where his metal arm was curled around her. Softening the skin where he was as hard as stone. Soothing him where he ached.
“Oh you sneaky bastard,” Tony said, grinning. He’d never been much of a fan when it came to vaseline, but the glide worked well enough, and if it meant they could actually be doing this now, he wouldn’t be complaining. “Master strategist,” he mumbled absentmindedly as he took the little box from Steve, “If America only knew.”
Well, true enough, the house evidently enjoyed more tourism than any of the places they had seen so far—the grounds were filled with people, the parking areas nearly completely occupied.
“I…” Tony shook his head, then huffed. “Yeah, sure, Steve, but… wow, this got very serious very fast.”
“I could never hate you,” Tony said and it sounded so broken that Steve wanted to curl around him and never let go again. “And I won’t hate you when we’re done.” He made another feeble try to reach for Steve, but he batted his hand away.
“Oh, look at you,” Tony said, laughing, when Ian glanced at them sleepily. He sat down next to Steve and brushed a finger along the baby’s forehead, stopping at his mouth when it made some suckling motions.
When Steve walked back to the mansion, stepping into the great entrance hall, a hushed conversation drifted through the air. Steve recognized the deep timber of Stane’s voice immediately, but there was someone else with him. Someone Steve
Natasha didn’t flinch. Didn’t move. Merely studied him. Their breath billowed out between them in soft white clouds. “I know you hate it when I lie to you,” she said with a soft tone, making Steve huff. “But I know you, and you weren’t ready for this. Telling you about him would’ve cost you everything.”
Soon enough, all seven of them were lying on the RV’s roof side by side, staring with their goggles at the sky. He and Rhodey had set up their equipment in record time, having practiced this step of the way for a Million times. The telescope was ready, as was the camera. They would have the perfect pictures—the perfect videos—but now, it was time just to bask.
Just a few dozen feet away from Tony, in the living room, the whole gang was drowsing on the huge couch area. Thor was lounging in one of the big arm chairs, laughing heartily at whatever they were watching. Tony couldn’t see Steve’s face from where he was sitting on one of the couches, his back was to him. But he could tell by the slant of his head that he was sleepy, his attention only vaguely focused on the television.
There was a man in a fine-looking suit. And Steve was almost sure he hadn’t been there a minute before. What on earth was going on here?
Still, it took Tony a moment to take note of his injuries. When he did, though, he made a little cry of alarm. “What the hell?” he yelled, fingers hovering over Steve’s hand, and… Yeah, it was all shades of black, blue, and purple. So swollen the skin was shiny, stretched tight around them. If you knew what to look for, you could already see the serum kicking in, repairing every cell at top-speed, but for now, it just looked really bad. Steve sighed at the sight and brought his legs up so that he could rest his elbow on his knees.
Strangely enough, while their conversations were still tense, still agitated, they both seemed to be more willing to actually listen to the other’s standpoint, at least—most of the time.
Tony murmured something in return, but didn’t wake. His heart rate slowed down, his breaths evening out, and deep inside Steve’s mind, a decision was forming.
Their ability to be alone had taken a serious hit over the last few weeks. While Steve wouldn’t give up Ian for the world, it took some readjustment. Suddenly, there was a very demanding third person in their lives, and between their jobs and caring for their baby, there wasn’t a lot of time just for the two of them.
“His opinion isn’t worth more than your own,” Steve prompted gently. When Tony didn’t answer to that either, Steve cautiously stepped up next to him.
Shaking his head once, Tony decided to drop all of those thoughts then and there because there was no problem to solve, yet. They were doing fine, and Steve wanted this, and he wouldn’t fuck it up before it even started.
“Once the carriers reach 3000 feet, they’ll triangulate with Insight satellites, becoming fully weaponized,” Bruce explained. “Then it’s a just a matter of seconds before they launch Project Insight.”
“I’m gonna stop listening to you, now,” Steve announced, grinning for a moment, before he pressed his face against Tony’s neck. “You’re just gonna be silly about this and I have better things to do.”
It wasn’t a very good picture. Aside from the poor quality of the image, the angle was odd, and yet… it was them at their happiest.
Tony sighed, and didn’t say anything. What was he supposed to say to that? What Steve was calling 'flesh wounds' had been four broken ribs, one fractured cheekbone, two stab wounds, one graze and two gunshot wounds, as well as a head trauma and severe blood loss, but it wouldn't be of any use to rub that in, now.
Barnes only stared at Steve some more, before he turned around swiftly, eyes landing on Tony where he hovered over the scene, keeping the HYDRA agents away from where Steve and Barnes stood.
“Right,” Tony said, swallowing. “I get a check-up regularly, and I’m clean, so… I wouldn’t mind… going bare. But I don’t mind the condom either.”
A not too-small part of him was bathed in relief that all of this mess had just been the outcome of something that had been beyond all of their control. But then again, it wouldn’t change much of anything.
. “Fuck, I never should have brought you here,” he said softly, a long, resigned sigh rolling off his shoulders. He brushed a kiss across his brow. “God, I wish I’d never come back.”
Steve didn’t go into Barnes’ room. Not anymore. He’d tried a few times, in the beginning—had tried to talk to him, but Barnes hadn’t reacted well to his visits, either ignoring him completely, or showing severe signs of anxiety until Steve would eventually leave and let Bruce deal with the aftermath.
“I love making you incoherent,” Steve said, flashing Tony a quick grin. “You’re always so good with your words, and I’ve… missed this.” He released him completely without warning, his hands finding Tony’s wrists as he turned them around and pressed Tony on the bed so he could look at him.
He grabbed hold of his rifle and pulled himself up the slope. He took a good ten seconds to aim, waiting until the car reached the right height, before he pulled the trigger. The shot echoed along the Potemkin Stairs, and then the bullet burst through the car’s tires. The car veered off course immediately, and skidded sideways, falling off the embankment.
… I’m not sure you’re fully aware of the consequences. SHIELD is the only organization with the right ways and means to ensure world safety on an international level.”
Steve's nose scrunched up adorably at that, but he was otherwise out of commission. Tony pressed himself as close as he could get without causing Steve any pain, and closed his eyes as well.
Steve startled, whirling around. Bucky stood at the other side of the corridor, casually leaning against the wall as he smiled at him.
‘Confused’ was to minor a word for the way he was feeling right now. ‘Bewildered’ might be better. He wasn’t into guys. He’d never… he’d never thought about a man like that, and he
Oh God, his head was spinning. Next to him, he saw Tony struggle, clearly bewildered as first Pepper then Rhodey pulled him to his feet and hugged him.
He’d survived all of that, if just barely. He’d survived, because Bucky had always been by his side.
did a scan of your arm just now and there’s only a small glitch with the motion sensor that made it shut down. I can fix that in a minute or two. However…” He paused for a moment, gauging his words very carefully. “There’s a few things I could improve. I mean, don’t get me wrong, the arm is amazing as it is, the responsiveness is state-of-the art, and the way they integrated the settings with your nervous system is giving me a headache, but… if you’d let me work on it for a few hours, I think I could make it move a bit smoother, I know some mechanisms are still giving you a bit of a hard time.”
Despite their more than rocky start, Tony had come to like the guy. Even though he was ninety-nine percent sure he kept stealing the sesame bagels whenever Steve bought them some.
“No,” Tony replied stubbornly. He was practically writhing on Steve’s lap, his unmistakable erection rubbing sensually over Steve’s crotch. In the meantime, he had evidently given up on Steve’s shirt and fumbled with his pants instead. “Want you,” he panted.
Tony regarded Steve, his brows furrowed in deep thought. Steve looked so anxious, and he knew whatever he’d seen had really pushed him off his feet.
His hands started out resting on Tony’s chest, but gradually found their way up to his face. And Tony was growing light headed and he touched his forehead against Steve’s.
There were things they both needed to face. The world outside waited with a whole bunch of people who would not understand, and the next catastrophe was already somewhere down the road. It didn’t matter, though. Nothing mattered right now. Tony’s arms were around him.
When Tony came out of the shower, Steve couldn't help but enjoy the sight of him, dressed casually, scrubbed clean, refreshed after a good night's sleep. They stood there smiling at one another for a long moment, before Steve turned and they went to the common room together.
“Happy?” Steve asked softly. He looked gloriously bedded, his blond hair a complete mess, his lips distinctively kiss-swollen.
“You think that now,” Tony whispered urgently. “But the only thing you’ll get is regret and hurt and a million other things you could very well live without. If you think
say anything about although those were clearly outdated, and Steve did have access to Tony’s movie database.
The thought gnawed on him—he hadn’t liked it that Tony’d been distracted all the time, that Extremis’ evaluation often counted more than Steve’s opinion on a matter, but he’d never, not once, wished for Tony to lose all those possibilities Extremis gave him.
,” Tony echoed, his voice askance. He grinned broadly, nudging his nose against the side of Steve’s face and drawing his mouth back to Tony’s. His tongue teased his lips, doing his damnedest to drive him up the wall. God, he loved kissing Steve. “Real kinky.”
Tony’s hands were drifting along Steve’s face as he leaned back. “Who would’ve thought,” he murmured, chuckling when Steve immediately stole another kiss from him. He couldn’t help it. There was a fierce happiness trying to push to the surface, and Steve had a hard time keeping himself in check.
Sam nodded. Then nodded some more. “Yeah, sure, that’s cool,” he said, glancing at Mjolnir for a second before he turned around to place another coffeepot on the counter.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, still worried. “I mean, we were down in your shop, talking about the mission tomorrow and you just… collapsed. I wasn’t fast enough and you hit your head on the floor pretty badly. Are you okay?”
It took a few long minutes, before Steve breathed in deep, then looked up at all of them, his expression stern but non-accusatory. “From here on, I need you all to be honest with me. We’re a team, and record shows we’re a good one. I can accept that there are some things you can’t or don’t want to tell me, I’m not so naive as to expect you to share all of your secrets, but I need you to be honest about the things that matter. With the way things are changing right now, I need to be sure that we can tell each other everything.”
Tony slumped back against Steve and cast him a pointed eyeroll. “Fine, party pooper,” he said, waving at the stairway next to them. “Second floor, 22 D. And the guy there isn’t my boyfriend, just so you know.”
“Not so sure about Stark,” Bucky murmured, and before Steve could say something to that, Natasha had already whacked him on the back of his head.
Well, that was until Steve had walked into Tony’s room without knocking, and caught him with his pants down, masturbating while focusing on Steve’s graduation photo.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve managed to say. He’d always thought so, but never dared to boost Tony’s ego even more.
. I know the signs.” She pressed a kiss against Steve’s cheek. “It’s not as crazy as you might think it is.”
“I’ll get it,” Tony said, jogging up the small stairway before Bruce could disagree. When he opened the door, he paused, his eyebrows shooting upwards almost instantly. That was… not what he had expected. When Bruce had said ‘friend’, Tony instantly thought of someone who was, well, like
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand once before he walked towards the suit, which was still leaning up against one of the walls. “On it,” he said, crouching down to pick up the helmet. “Pretty sure we won’t get any signal out,” he told Steve, even before the HUD came to life. “I think the basement was built specifically to block any sort of radio waves, that’s why I couldn’t scan it in the first place. The others should’ve received our last signal before we walked down here, so I don’t think there’s any real need to worry just yet.”
Bucky looked calm as he took in his surroundings, but there was a tremor in his metal arm he couldn’t quite control. Steve could detect the scent of fresh sweat on Bucky’s skin, and it was obvious how nervous he was. Bucky was opening one of the books now, for once not all that wary about his surroundings. That was a good sign, Steve thought; that Bucky wasn’t on edge all that much anymore.
The air was strangely warm around them and Tony trembled with little shocks of aftermath. He had Steve drawn as close to him as he could and feathered the side of his face with soft kisses. He was still inside him, partially hard and growing more so. It didn’t really surprise him.
“Maybe it’ll be different in my time. I know time travel has its consequences. Maybe me coming here is going to change things.”
“A ball.” Pepper’s eyebrows were raised up so high that her bangs covered them completely. “You want to throw a ball.”
A shake of his head. “I don’t think that’s possible. Right now, we’re kinda it. Wanda’s under surveillance, Tony’s gotta take care of Ross.”
“You’ll wait,” Tony yelled over the com, his voice all authority. “Maria, don’t you dare push that button. Just let me
Bruce huffed, and pointedly let go of Tony’s feet as he stood up. “Ultron was a team effort,” he declared. “And rubbing your feet while you guys make out easily accounts for forty.” He walked over to the working station and washed his hands. Then, he sat down in front of one of the holographic monitors.
“Not like this,” Steve said firmly, hating himself for not having shoved Tony off long ago. He wasn’t a weak leaf of a thing anymore; he
Steve was thrusting in deep, hitting every sweet spot, and Tony’s mind just whited out, his body losing all posture. He groaned, surrendering entirely to Steve, and came, hard, his cock pulsing against Steve’s fingers.
. And I—I didn’t know how to fix it without losing Bucky in the process. But that didn’t change how I felt about you, how I… how I still feel.”
There was evident hurt in Tony eyes and something darker Steve couldn’t quite figure out.  Something he would have to deal with come dawn, no doubt.
“You’re not a burden. You’re my team member, and you’re my friend, as far as I’m concerned. There wasn’t anything to forgive in the first place, and I shouldn’t have said and done what I did, but that’s not something I can undo so… I apologize.”
“It seems they are travelling with Agent Rumlow near south side of the city,” JARVIS went on. “Coordinates are being transferred to the Quinjet as we speak.”
Burying his face in Tony's neck, Steve hastened the pace just a little more, following the telltale hints in Tony's voice and the way he moved, until the tension was unbearable, and when Tony finally climaxed it was beyond what Steve could contain, and he followed suit. The rippling muscles around him and the all-but-writhing form under him were all the incentive he could ever hope for.
Fuck it, Tony didn’t care how desperate he must be looking. Not with Steve. He only wanted more. And more.
Tony was kissing him and kissing him, his hands moving over Steve’s hair, his face, delicately moving over his skin in achingly gentle touches. Touches which never moved below his collarbone, as if he had no right to Steve’s body.
Taking hold of his arms, Steve gently pushed Tony off his chest and rolled them over until Steve was more or less on top of him. “In that case… How do you feel about having sex with a father-to-be?” he teased.
. He had the words on the tip of his tongue, but now that he faced Tony, a man who intimidated him in a way no other person had ever managed to do, all arguments seemed to fail him.
The skin of his naked chest… well, in the sunlight it gleamed almost golden. He could only resist its pull for so long, so he reached down and let his finger lightly trace Tony’s upper arm. He didn’t do much more than prod his shoulder, though his hand did take a brief detour to run through his black locks to see if they were as soft as they looked.
An air blast rushed past Steve and when he managed to look up, he saw Pietro Maximoff shoving Ultron out the way. There were red blasts of magic wavering through the air, and Steve heard her before his blurry field of vision cleared up. Wanda walked towards Ultron, and the street’s guard railing was pulled out of the ground one by one. It wrapped itself around Ultron’s body, squeezing him tight.
It had already been three years, Steve reminded himself. Bucky had probably finished rehabilitation. He was… alive. Steve just needed… He needed to…
falling, but he left the soft space around him and—“Ugh,” Steve grunted as he dropped on some floor, or rather, on a very fluffy, very colorful rug. His shield fell down right next to him and Steve immediately reached for it, bracing himself for what was to come. One quick look at his surroundings told him he didn’t know this place, but at least, it didn’t look like a hostile environment.
Tony sighed, gaze not swaying from the brunette. There was a glow of reverent awe bursting through his heart. “When on earth did you become so noble, Brucey?”
“I—” The man said, then followed Tony’s gesture with his eyes. He pointedly reached for a pen that lay on the table between them, and leaned back. “I’ve actually read most of it, already. The changes are good.”
Steve grinned. “I’m counting on it. He’d only be nagging the whole time I cook. He really didn’t want to celebrate.”
Tony raised Steve’s gaze with fingers on his chin. He smiled and kissed him deeply. “I’ll miss you, too. So much.”
He knew because Tony had developed a fierce obsession with writing down each and every one of Ian’s stepping-stones and letting FRIDAY compare them with the average. Secretly, Steve thought Ian would simply do and learn things when it felt right for him to do so, but Tony’s need to support and encourage their son on every step of his way was endearing in itself, so he figured it was okay. As with everything else, they balanced each other well.
Around them, the Kamar-Taj was buzzing with the voices of Strange’s men. All the young sorcerers-in-training who had survived the latest battle with Thanos were outside, fighting the fight. Their mentor, Wong, was looking at Tony warily from across the library.
In any case, Steve’s words seemed to trigger something within Tony. He just stared at him for a whole minute, his pulse racing. The scent of his aftershave was flooding Steve’s nostrils. “And what do you think I came here for?”
Reaching his hands down to rest at Tony's waist, Steve guided him away from the curb and towards the outer wall of the club. "What am I going to do with you…" he mumbled, not sure if it was a question or a complaint or what, but he knew, as soon as he had Tony pinned, that he couldn't turn back now.
Hanging his head low, Steve resigned himself to starting his day early as his panic slowly abated. He'd planned to wake up at five and get some gym time today, anyway, but first, he needed to let his heart-rate go down. To that end, he settled back onto his bed.
