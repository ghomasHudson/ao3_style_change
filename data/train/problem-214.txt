“You must be John’s Alpha,” Mary said with a smile.  “He told us what happened, but you’re here now, that’s the main thing.  He gave us quite a scare for a minute or two!  You need to scoot right up close, so he can scent at your neck where the pheromones are strongest, if you haven’t already?  It’ll help him with the healing.  Do you need anything, John?  Do you want me to prepare the little one a bottle?”
John dropped onto his back at Sherlock’s side, panting and sweating. “Jesus Sherlock, where did you learn to do that?”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.  Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”  John was even more confused now, he hadn’t said anything at all about looking for a flatmate… Oh, Mike must have mentioned it in the text he had sent earlier.  John turned to Mike to confirm his suspicions.
He softly cupped Sherlock’s face in his hand.
Sherlock flicked through the file, skimming each report in turn, taking in every detail.  “No.  There was no deviation in the methodology whatsoever; if it was two people working together, they were together for every theft.  No, you’re looking for one person.  I need to speak to your suspect.”
Two hours later, Xander was fast asleep in Greg’s arms and Sherlock had the contents of the file spread all around him on the floor.  Greg stood up, needing to stretch his legs, and Sherlock was immediately on his feet, almost growling at Greg.  The detective inspector stopped dead, holding one hand up to Sherlock, and said “Sherlock, it’s okay mate, I’m just stretching my legs… But since you’re up anyway, can you take him for a moment so I can nip to the loo?”  Sherlock took his son carefully in his arms, bringing him up close so he could scent the baby again, rubbing his nose on the soft cheeks to cover Xander in his own scent.  Greg had been very careful not to touch the baby any more than he had to; he had tried to keep his own scent on the child and his clothes to a minimum.
“Mary, I’d like you to meet Alexander Sigerson Watson-Holmes,” John said softly.
Focused as much as he was on those sensations, it was a shock to feel the finger retreat entirely, leaving him empty, and he turned quickly to see what was going on.  As he did so, he felt the finger return, and another, stretching his tight hole, increasing the pleasure.  Another moan was forced from him, louder this time – Sherlock had always been very vocal – and he increased the pace of his stroke to match that of the fingers now pumping in and out of his arse.  He felt the tight coil beginning in his belly, he knew it was a matter of moments before he would come all over the doctor’s clean paper towel covered couch, and he didn’t care.  At precisely that moment, Dr Watson pulled out both of his fingers, leaving Sherlock empty, confused.
“Whatever you did? Whatever you did, Sherlock? You’re down there with another man, and you’re wondering
was still in charge of cleaning out the fridge, it would be happening twice a week, and anything Sherlock brought in that was not stored at the bottom of the fridge in airtight and properly labeled containers would be disposed of, no matter how important it was.  If, on the other hand, Sherlock could see his way clear to help out with the cleaning… At that point, Sherlock had decided that perhaps he
“I’ve narrowed it down to two people, but it depends what vehicles they have access to.  I should be able to let you know in the morning.”
*****POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING*****
So Sherlock's been working in the morgue at St Bart's this week, our friend Molly often saves body parts for him to experiment on, and she's had some unclaimed kidneys.  He claims all the experiments he does are essential for building his database, but I've yet to see the case solved because Sherlock knows the rate of absorption of Coca-Cola by the tissue of the big toe.  Perhaps I'm missing some vital data there…
The boys are avoiding each other in the aftermath of The Kiss. John does a favour for one of Mrs Turner's married ones which results in him being injured... and brings some things to a head.
you… You could have at least told me you don’t want to be with me any more, instead of letting me find out this way.”  He turned back to the toilet, angrily shaking Sherlock’s hand from his arm as he did.
“Sherlock, I’ll clean it, I’m the doctor, after all!”  He stood, continuing to speak.  “Thank you for what you’ve done, but I can manage now.”
Sherlock looked John straight in the eyes.  “Then would you kiss me too?”
John’s hands tugged roughly at Sherlock’s hips, lifting them from the desk and giving him access to the button and zip at his fly.  He pulled at the coarse fabric, hearing the button pop loose and ping across the room.  One sharp tug saw Sherlock’s trousers bunching around his knees, the tight black fabric of his underwear snug around the plump cheeks of his arse.  John ran one hand appreciatively over the stretched fabric, then abruptly grabbed the waistband and yanked it all the way down, exposing Sherlock’s skin.  He felt the younger man shiver despite the warmth of the room, and knew it was the excitement of exposure.  John stepped back a couple of paces, leaving Sherlock bent over the desk, that delectable arse on display to the world.  Using his booted foot, he spread Sherlock’s legs apart until the trousers around his knees stopped them moving any further.  John could see a glimpse of the dark shadow between Sherlock’s buttocks, and after what felt like an interminable age he stepped forwards again.  John rubbed his hand roughly along the cleft as Sherlock moaned, arching his back like a cat, and pushed himself back onto John’s hand.
“The first flowers I put on your grave were roses, as dark in colour as this one, but with almost no scent – it was the wrong time of year, they were hothouse roses.  This was what I wanted to give you then, something as incredible, and powerful, and unique as you were.  I couldn’t do it then, so I’m going to do it now, like I promised that night with the petals.”  So saying, John handed the rose to Sherlock, and they walked on together, the scent of the symbol of John’s love for Sherlock drifting up between them.
I can't believe I'm talking about this with him. Do I tell him?
His lips are soft and he smells divine. His hands grasp each side of my face and he breathes. It's a deep life sustaining breath. My hands find his arms and I cling to his plush jumper.
There it was again. Sherlock's sadness, badly disguised under petulance. John didn't really know what to do, what to say, to relief Sherlock's fears. The only thing he could think of was something Sherlock would surely not welcome. It's not like John could just reach out and...
Automatically, I look at John. That's a mistake.
I feel myself getting more and more control over myself. Time to decide how to respond. I can't pretend nothing happened. Not now.
Is this what it's supposed to feel like? Because, surely, this is the moment where he finds out. I hope he doesn't leave right away.
“What was that?”
And it wasn't just the sight of the words that were comforting, it was the knowledge that they were there. I needed this. A part of John, now a part of me.
“You've had plenty of moments in the spotlight. I was due for some action.” John quipped back and stood up from the table without letting go of Sherlock's hand. Sherlock followed John's lead and rose from his own seat.
John steeled himself. He felt that what he was about to say could possibly break the relative peace now left in the kitchen.
John stood up tentatively and squared his jaw. Ready for battle.
“I can't believe we came all the way over here and you didn't bother working with the local police.” John's tone was scolding. This was typical Sherlock.
John was having a hard time following Sherlock's leaps in logic, and had a sinking feeling that the local D.I. (or whatever their title was out here) would have an even harder time of it. They would find out soon enough, as they were currently driving towards the police station at 113 Hverfisgata, which was of course located down town. When John thought about it, they could as well just walk over there from their hotel.
“You don't have to understand it, Sherlock, just believe me when I say that we won't leave you.” John took another bite of bacon, even though he didn't really want to. He wanted to present a picture of normal so Sherlock could ease up just a bit.
I should say something, but he's holding me captive with his steady gaze. I feel my lower lip quiver as my mouth fights my brain to produce an answer to John's impossible query, but nothing happens.
to know.
John leans down and draws me in. He's kissing me. We're kissing.
He does this sometimes. He catches me doing something completely normal and he freezes. I understand. I do it too. It's those moments that remind me of before. It makes me uncomfortable so I adjust my focus again and start identifying bacteria.
“Don't be obtuse. I don't take cases on Wednesdays.” Sherlock frowned and crossed his arms.
“Panic attack.” Sherlock muttered. “Yes, John. Very perceptive as usual.” He sounded like himself, but his breathing was a bit off. Shaky. Uneven. Too shallow.
“Okay, John. Let me spell this out for you. First of all, Irene is married. To Kate. Her old assistant.”
It was a Monday morning when he finally realised what had been missing in his life.
John could see Sherlock's Adam's apple bobble in his throat as he swallowed.
“That I'm not-, we're not-, not like that.” He couldn't say it.
John's voice died out. He couldn't speak. It was too much. He thought about all the scenarios where Sherlock would leave him for his unwanted affections, and John completely clammed up. He gestured lamely with his fork and looked down at his half eaten bacon and eggs.
“I love you too, John,” Sherlock whispered against John's lips.
John sighed and finished buttoning up the ridiculous garment. Seriously, was it really necessary to have buttons down both legs as well as the front? It looked like an upside-down Y-incision, and John really didn't want to compare his daughter to a corpse during autopsy. He picked Rosie up from the sofa, held her against his hip, and made his way to the kitchen while she happily hit him in the face with the teething ring she really didn't need any longer.
John giggled. Sherlock felt affronted. “How?” John wheezed. “How am I supposed to meet a woman? Where would I find the time, or the opportunity, or, more importantly, the motivation?” John was looking at him with his don't-be-ridiculous face, but it looked almost fond now.
He turned around slowly to observe, with surprise, Sherlock murmuring softly to his smiling daughter.
John stared at him for a bit. Maybe a minute. Perhaps a year. Sherlock wasn't sure.
That is all that I manage. I shake my head a twitch and detach myself from my microscope. It's in the way, so I push it aside.
“I know it isn't.”
That sealed it.
“Why doesn't it bother you?” Sherlock couldn't help asking. Word vomit. Foul phrase.
“Saliva.” I hope my answer jolts him out of his human glitch.
“I know, Mr. Married-To-My-Work. But why don't you just try? See where it goes?”
On Wednesdays, John finished paperwork at the office which made his working day at least two hours longer than usual. Therefore, Sherlock got to pick up Rosie from daycare.
John strode back to the living room holding two empty mugs. “What did you say?”
Reykjavík was beautiful. Well, at least this part of it was. Here the streets were narrow and full of pedestrians. The buildings were quaint and colourful, and some even adorned with extraordinary artwork. Every other building seemed to house a pub or a café, and the rest were either tourist shops or expensive looking designer clothing stores. John had to almost drag Sherlock past a couple of them.
I don't feel nearly as brave as this move should demand.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock stated with considerable authority in his voice; a trick he must've picked up from Mycroft.
“I'm just asking Daddy if I can play with the fancy legos, but he's not answering.” Rosie pouted and crossed her arms childishly. She was a child after all, so she had the right to, Sherlock guessed.
“Rosie will stay with me today, don't worry.”
“Were would you want to go?” Was Sherlock's only response.
It was, in fact, an actual flat. John hadn't known what to expect, but what was in front of him right now certainly wasn't it. The flat was modern, open, and spacious. It had a breakfast bar, a kitchen table, lounge area with an orange sofa and a glass coffee table, and at the back stood two queen sized beds separated only by a bit of wall.
“What's that?”
Sherlock's smile could outshine the sun.
Sherlock felt a mug nudge his fingers and reflexively closed his hands around it. Might as well. He went through the motions of lifting the mug up to his face, tipping it against his lips, then swallowing the lukewarm contents. Afterwards he felt a bit more like himself again, although incredibly confused by his own body's apparent shutdown.
“I love you.”
This was a disaster. What would John say? John trusted Sherlock to pick up his daughter on Wednesdays. He trusted Sherlock not to hijack her for his own. Rosie was John's daughter not Sherlock's, but now she was calling him 'Daddy' and that couldn't possibly escape John's notice. He was after all, slightly less of an idiot than the general population.
“Sherlock? Aren't you going to answer?”
“Alright, lets go home.”
“Can we go feed the ducks, Daddy?”
God damn it! His vocal chords and mouth were rebelling against him. Stupid transport. He swiveled in place, then decided that it was for the best to retreat to his bedroom. Let John stew for a bit before facing his anger.
“Thank you. I'm John Watson and this is, well, Sherlock.”
Sherlock raised his head slowly and made eye-contact. His eyes were shining, John realised in horror, with unshed tears.
“And I love you,” he whispered back. “So much.”
“Can I?”
John's voice has a new quality to it now. I'd be enjoying this moment if what he's saying isn't making me feel like my insides were blinking in and out of existence. I wish I had realized how my apparent death would affect him before I left.
“No, I really don't,” John said quietly. When Sherlock showed obvious signs of a coming rebuttal, John cut him off. “Look, we can't go to Iceland because for one: It's very expensive. Secondly: It's dark, damp, and cold, and final and most importantly: It's god damn bloody expensive!” Having said his piece, John leant back against the sofa cushions, but Sherlock just glared at him.
Hudders at the door. Not so amazing.
They popped into the hotel to ask the clerk if they had any strollers for rent; John's arms were about to fall off from carrying Rosie. Toddlers were deceptively heavy. The clerk had smiled and nodded and before long, John, Sherlock, and Rosie were on their way.
Detachment it is, then.
John couldn't help but giggle and they walked side by side into the building, Rosie dead asleep in his arms. Sherlock stated his name to the clerk behind the service desk in lieu of greeting.
Also, Rosie had just declared Sherlock her father. She was incredibly confused. This was no good, no good at all. She was already almost 4 years old and Sherlock was all too aware of the fact that John couldn't share a room with her forever. Sherlock gave it about 5 more months before John would have enough and decide to move away so Rosie could have her own bedroom. This 'Daddy' issue would only exacerbate things.
John sat up slowly, his mouth open.  He reached across to Sherlock’s chin, raising it, so he could look him in the eyes. Sherlock’s eyes filled with tears, and before he knew it, John had pulled Sherlock down into his arms, rocking and soothing and peppering his hair with kisses.  “It’s all over now, you did it, you saved us all,” he crooned softly.  “I love you Sherlock, and I’ll buy you flowers every day for the rest of your life.”
“We’re not, I am,” said Sherlock shortly.
He's going to kill me for this one, but Sherlock's got an admirer! A lovely young lady in her seventies has heard about him and asked for his help in tracing her granddaughter - the case itself took him about twenty minutes on Twitter - but she's decided he's the best thing since sliced bread and keeps popping round with biscuits and cakes for him.  Our landlady's nose has been put well and truly out of joint by the whole thing, as she usually bakes for Sherlock.  I think she sees him as another one of her sons, she's constantly trying to feed him up and he rarely allows her to.  Things got a little frosty around her for a while, after Mrs Evans dropped a box of biscuits off for the third week in a row - until I pointed out that he'd been scattering them in the park over the road for the birds - I'm not sure that's very healthy for the birds, but it's definitely healthy for our flat!
he was being, by caring enough to try and find John when he thought he’d been kidnapped.  When the phone rang again twenty minutes later, he ignored it again, determined not to
“Even if it might be dangerous?  And I might get hurt?”
Sherlock had to tear his eyes away from the baby when he became aware of John’s weight leaning on his arm.  He was sleeping, but looked pale and sweaty, and Sherlock was sharply reminded of how much John had suffered during the birth.  He finished feeding Alexander, brought him up onto his shoulder and gently patted his back until he brought up a large burp.  “Just like your Daddy, Alexander,” Sherlock muttered quietly, and gently tucked the sleepy baby back into his bassinet.
“Sherlock, it wasn’t until after… after the rooftop… that I realised just how much you meant to me.  And then when you came back, I was caught up with Mary, and I couldn’t just drop everything with her, I had to do right by her… Lot of good that did me in the end though…”
Sherlock gets started on his investigation, and immediately starts crossing lines that shouldn't be crossed. John's reaction puts him into a moral quandry...
John smiled.  “Oh, I think I could manage that,” he replied, “after all, it’s our duty to teach new students coming through, and experiencing the procedure yourself makes you more empathetic to the patient.  I think there are a few other, less conventional techniques for prostate exam I could show you too…”
There were always plenty of horny servicemen looking for love… or a reasonable facsimile of it, anyway.  John had tried going to them for help when his faux-heats came, but none of them were ever willing to go through it with him.  There was something about John that had put them off; a scent, or a feeling, nobody was ever really sure, just sure enough to turn him down and leave him with a frustrating and indefinable ache.  John sometimes felt resentful about it; his mouth was fine for a quick blowjob behind the mess tent when one of them had had a near miss and wanted to reaffirm his vitality, but nobody was ever willing to put themselves out on John’s behalf.  He’d managed to curb that feeling most of them time, it was a slippery slope from that kind of resentment to deciding that if they weren’t willing to help a guy out, then neither were you… and given John was a doctor, it would amount to professional suicide.
Sherlock did his usual thing, spoke to the client for about two minutes, upset her dreadfully, then swanned off to look around, leaving me to try and calm the troubled waters.  Next thing I know, he's off down the garden path, muttering something about a party - apparently she'd gone to some swanky Christmas do and worn the necklace, Sherlock was almost convinced she'd got drunk and lost it on the way home, but when we spent two days running around in the biting wind and freezing rain to interview her work colleagues, they all said the same thing - she doesn't drink at all due to an alcohol allergy (yes, that is possible, and no, it's not what you have when you're suffering from a hangover, that's pure overindulgence and doesn't deserve any sympathy at all, Greg!).  Could she have lost it in the back of the taxi home from the party, Sherlock asked?  No, the party happened to have been on that particularly warm evening we had a week or so back, so she'd walked home - a bit of a gym bunny, apparently, and doesn't like to drive if she can walk instead.  Ah-ha, says Sherlock, perhaps she was pickpocketed without realising it?  (Can you pickpocket someone's neck?  I'll have to ask Sherlock…)  Nope, says the client, and shows Sherlock a picture she uploaded to Instagram when she got home - the necklace is clearly visible around her neck.
As Sherlock and John approached the group, John could hear a particularly enthusiastic argument taking place, unfortunately the two young men doing the arguing were paying too much attention to the argument, and not paying enough attention to the frisbee… but Jilly was, and as it sailed off into the distance, she darted after it. Sherlock found himself galloping across the park, his long legs flying as he tried desperately to stay on his feet.  John collapsed in a heap, laughing a deep belly laugh at the sight of the man he loved abandoning all attempts at dignity in return for not making a complete arse of himself.  He managed to pick himself up from the ground and started to trot after Sherlock and Jilly, who he found together in a pile on the grass a little way up the park.  Sherlock was sporting some bright green stains on his knees, evidence that he had lost the fight with his balance, and Jilly was sitting with a mouthful of Frisbee, wagging her tail and looking very pleased with herself.
“You could have waited half an hour, and I’d have been home, Sherlock….”
Thanks to everyone who commented earlier, we managed to find him, he'd been trapped inside a deserted shop while trying to solve a smuggling ring.  Turned out to be absolutely nothing to do with the heavies running the ring, he'd misjudged things when climbing through a window.  The shop had a sunken floor that wasn't visible from outside, so the fall was a lot further than he was expecting.  Unfortunately, he managed to land on both his mobile (which smashed) and an uneven pile of rubbish which resulted in a rather severely sprained ankle.
“Where do you think you’re going?” he spat out, fixing John with a piercing gaze.
They had both taken off their shoes and socks, and were standing knee deep in the muddy water, nets in hand, looking for tadpoles.  They weren’t having any luck mainly because it was the middle of August and the tadpoles had all developed into frogs and toads already, although neither boy realised this.  While they were searching, they returned to an old subject they had discussed before.
Jilly had finished licking up the scraps of chicken from the floor, and was now sitting by the door to the flat, whining a little in the back of her throat.  She looked back over her shoulder at John, and whined again.  “Oh god, she needs to go out, Sherlock, what do I do now?  I can’t really take her for walkies like this, can I?!”  John walked through to the kitchen, and encouraging Jilly to follow him, led her through to the bathroom.  She scrabbled awkwardly on all fours, her neck bent at an awkward angle, but eventually managed to follow him inside.  About fifteen minutes later, John returned, with Jilly following along behind, looking much more relieved.
John and Sherlock start to get used to life with each other, and both find themselves mysteriously drawn to the other...
“So… You’ve solved your first case.  How do you feel?” John asked, as Sherlock sipped at his tea.  He smiled back at John shyly.
John looked up at that, blushing a little.  He couldn’t take his jeans off in front of Sherlock; as unlikely as it seemed, he was already starting to get aroused at Sherlock’s gentle ministrations, and taking his jeans off would only make that worse.  John couldn’t bear the thought that Sherlock would be faced with evidence of John’s desire so quickly after being scared off, so he decided the only thing for it would be to clean the wound himself.
Sherlock himself had begun refusing cases from Lestrade, and only accepting the ones from the website that he could solve without needing to leave the flat, or indeed to let clients visit.  The only people allowed into the flat were Mrs Hudson and Mike Stamford, although Mike was only allowed in to conduct John’s antenatal check-ups and then very firmly escorted from the premises.  Mycroft had attempted to visit, but as he was an Alpha, Sherlock’s response had been to stand blocking the bottom of the stairs and growl fiercely until Mycroft had gracefully raised his hands and left.
John pushed the plate back in Sherlock’s direction.  “Yes, Sherlock, you did.  You need to eat too; you expended rather a lot of energy the last few days.  What was that all about, anyway? You said it was as though we were bonded, how can that have happened?  All we did was have sex… Rather a lot of sex, admittedly… Rather a lot of really good sex…” John trailed off, then abruptly shook himself, blinking rapidly, as though bringing himself back to the present.
“So what are we going to name him?” John’s voice interrupted his thoughts.  “We can’t just keep calling him ‘the little one’, or ‘the baby’, he needs a proper name.  What do you think of David?”  Sherlock considered for a moment, and then wrinkled his nose.
“You’re so hard,” Sherlock breathed, rolling his hips again and sending another bolt of arousal through John.
John lay on the sofa, breathless and panting, just watching Sherlock.  He looked younger like this, relaxed, his walls down in a rare, unguarded moment.  He opened his eyes, focussing on John, and smiled.  Then he seemed to come to some sort of realisation, and John could see the walls going back up; the look of pain on his face worrying John.
Twenty minutes and another three pints later, Greg was starting to become seriously concerned.  He’d switched to mineral water, but John was still steadfastly drinking pints, as though his life depended on it.  Greg had never seen him drink this much, even when he’d tagged along on a boozy evening out with John’s army mates home on leave one night.  He had always been sensible, alternating pints with mineral water to limit the hangover.  Greg knew John was in for a world of pain in the morning, but he wouldn’t stop.  He called a cab, knowing he’d had far too much to drink to be able to drive home safely; he could drop in on the way to work to collect his car.
“You’re a bad man, Sherlock Holmes,” he grunted, snapping his hips and thrusting his cock into Sherlock’s warmth.  He reached under Sherlock, taking his cock into his fist and making the younger man groan in pleasure.  Each thrust of John’s hips pushed Sherlock’s cock through the tight ring of John’s fist, and it wasn’t long until Sherlock was orgasming, jets of come painting the desk and the floor beneath him.  John felt the pulse of his muscles around his cock, and quickly followed him over the edge, emptying himself deep inside his lover.
“That depends,” she smirked, “how many of them have you eyed up so far?  I’d have thought the one you brought with you was enough, but what would I know?  I’m a ladies' girl!”  She winked at him as she set his pint down on top of the bar and moved to grab a wine glass.
The Estonian for twelve months is absolutely true, and caused many days of amusement when I attended a hypnotherapy seminar with a group of English friends and we discovered it... The amazing Eesti translators knew exactly why we kept shoehorning the phrase "twelve months" into everything we said that needed to be translated to the group, and despite this, managed to keep their cool and do a very professional job!
It's been a horrible week, this week.  After solving the Magpie Theft case last week, it took Sherlock all of three hours to declare he was terribly bored and needed a new case.  When I pointed out he'd just solved one, and couldn't he find something else to do instead, he destroyed one of each pair of socks I own, claiming it was an experiment.  I'm not sure why he only ever experiments on my clothes and not his own…
He attempted to pick up the bowl and first aid kit, but hissed in pain when he put pressure on the dressed wounds on his forearms.  Sherlock stood immediately, grabbing the bowl and kit from John.  “Don’t be silly John, you’re in no state to do it.  Take your jeans off, I’ll get some clean water.”  He laid the kit down on the coffee table, and went to refresh the water.  John quickly stripped off his jeans, and sat back in the chair, covering his lap with a cushion and wincing again when the graze on his thigh rubbed on the coarse fabric of the chair.  Sherlock returned again, setting the bowl on the coffee table next to the first aid kit.
As Sherlock started to look through the contents of the lads’ lockers, Lestrade began to explain the facts.  In the three weeks since the other group had been in the camp, there had been eleven thefts of different items; money, iPods, little things that were easy to conceal, all taken from the dormitory.  There hadn’t been any thefts before the group had arrived, so Lestrade and Donovan were working on the assumption that it was one of the group.  Of the twelve, two had been sent on the program for drugs related assaults, four for vandalism, three for persistent graffiti, and three for breaking and entering and theft.  Of those three, one had been sick in the infirmary at the time of one of the thefts, one had been on supervised punishment at the time of one of the others.  For this reason, Lestrade explained, he and Donovan were concentrating on the third, Bateson, as their main suspect.  He was strenuously denying any involvement, and they had been unable to find any of the stolen items in Bateson’s possession, or anywhere else for that matter; the theory was that Bateson had already managed to sell them, so until something turned up or another theft happened, they weren’t able to take much action.  Lestrade handed Sherlock the file with the detailed accounts of the thefts, saying, “Of course, we have also considered the possibility that the other two were working together, so their alibis become irrelevant at that point…”
“I told you before, those files are private,” John smiled lazily, twisting his key in the lock of the door behind him and walking slowly over to Sherlock.  John gripped the back of Sherlock’s neck with his right hand, and Sherlock’s left wrist with his left hand.  Moving quickly, he pulled Sherlock forwards, spun him round and planted him face down on the desk.  Sherlock let out a breathy moan, and rubbed the fingers of his free hand along John’s thigh as high as he could, his knuckles grazing John’s balls.
“Really John?  You wanted to stay there with all the children, attempting to do magic again for the second time in your life?  Oh don’t look like that, I know you don’t know how to do magic, what on earth made you agree to do the party?”
Sherlock swallowed, breathing deeply, and deliberately tamping down on the feeling threatening to overwhelm him.  “I’m fine John, just wondering where you were… You could have brought the tea up with you.”
pretended to be English when the
“I saw him first, I’ve just come from the garage.  Anderson wasn’t there, and I need to talk to him to know for sure if he’s the one.”
Please take note of the tags; as I post Chapter 1, I haven't quite finished writing, so it is entirely possible the rating and tags will change.
“Would Mycroft-” John was rapidly cut off by Sherlock’s growling; his feelings on THAT suggestion were pretty obvious.  “Right, no Mycroft.  Obviously the British Government and all it’s resources will be of absolutely no use whatsoever…” Sherlock – eyes rolling again – moved over to the table again, and after a few moments of diligent nosing of tiles, John read the following message: WILL WEAR OFF NO NEED FOR FATCROFT.
“Stamford! Mike Stamford! We were at Bart’s together.”  At his words, John recognised the face before him.  They had spent more than a few nights studying together in the wee small hours; Mike was an open-minded Beta who didn’t mind spending time with a broken Omega, and talking through the different modules they had studied had lead to a greater understanding for both of them.
He eludes me.
Rosie's tone was so matter-of-fact that it was now Sherlock's turn to blink down at her. He blinked and blinked and blinked. She didn't seem to mind, she still had some bun left.
“It's fine.”
Mornings like that made John introspective; he would linger over the stove and take a look at his life, and the two most important people in it, and remind himself that he was happy.
“Got a plan?” John asked when Sherlock held the door open so he could enter with the stroller.
“Sherlock, can you hear me?” John was so close. Sherlock could feel his words on his skin rather than hear them. The light was in his eyes again and John swore under his breath. The ghosting of hot air straight from John's lungs on Sherlock's lips gave him the start that he needed to snap out of his... stasis?
Which is why when Sherlock asked: “How about Iceland?”
“Shut up, I'm not finished.”
He says it like it's something that has been said before. I feel warmth spreading through my very being. It's not physical, not really, but his words warm me.
“Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that I'd like to see more of this,” he muttered and gestured in Rosie's and Sherlock's general direction.
“Rosie,” John began. “Sherlock and I have been talking and I don't think you should call him 'Daddy' anymore.” Sherlock froze rigid. What? “It's much too confusing. It's too similar to dad. What about Papa, hmm?”
They arrived at their hotel around noon. It was right in the heart of down town Reykjavík. They had driven past colourful little houses and a pretty pond full of ducks, swans, and other water fowl. John struggled to imagine how high the rate of their room must've been, because the location was simply superb. The hotel was within spitting distance from the pond (John vowed to take Rosie down to feed the ducks at some point) and, according to the map on his phone, right next to the
, John! I'm not-. We're not-.
Sherlock just sat there, staring somewhere to the left of John. He was offline. Then, in a blink of an eye, he shuddered and spoke.
” Another pause, almost like she got interrupted. John took a deep breath, steeling himself for the inevitable. “
“Christ, I think you're having a-”
Hand-holding. Soft. Warm.
” She finally hung up.
He's asking if he can touch. I'm sure of it. 76% sure, that is. I nod.
“Look, Sherlock,” John started and Sherlock's face pivoted towards him instantly. It was slightly unsettling. “I hate to spring this on you like this, but this is something I think you ought to know about me and Rosie.”
“And finally, you will reach out to the local police and try to work with them.” Sherlock scowled at him and opened his mouth. “No, listen! I'm not going to get arrested for housebreaking or mistaken for a murderer while in a foreign country with
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock-”
“Sherlock!” John hissed. “You're going to get us thrown out of a country we've barely been in for more than five hours.”
“Good day and welcome to Kvósin,” the man said with a bright smile, seemingly unperturbed by Sherlock's lack of social grace. John gave the man an apologetic smile.
His fingers are stroking my skin. Circles. They go in circles. He's feeling it through his fingertips like Braille.
John clung to old rituals, because in this moment everything could change. As long as he'd be able to make Sherlock eat his breakfast, everything would be fine. At least, that was his pathetic argument.
John places his right hand on my left, which is covering his left, which covers my left arm, and gently pries it off. He removes his left as well and my skin feels suddenly cold. His chair scrapes against the floor as he stands up. I can't help but watch him as he stands for a moment.
“Certainly.”
I don't think I've fooled him. He's most likely rolling his eyes at me, because he's shifting his weight like he does whenever I exasperate him. I must distract him.
John felt his lips stretch into a fond smile. He couldn't help it. Sherlock had really changed and grown over the past two years. That he considered John and Rosie a part of his family still caught John by surprise sometimes. At times like this, John knew he wouldn't be able to deny Sherlock anything.
“I just don't understand.”
Well, he had agreed, hadn't he?
“It's fine, if it is.”
“I couldn't get your name, of course. That would have been dangerous for both of us. I got the next best thing.”
John halted a bit and Rosie squirmed. With a snort, he called back. “Are you taking the piss?” Rosie's fingers refused to cooperate and kept getting caught in the sleeve.
I've known for a long time that I love him, and now the possibility of him knowing that I love him makes me ill.
“I think, John. If this is indeed a proposition, I might be inclined to accept.” Sherlock muttered, more scared than he'd ever been before in his life. Including the moment of Rosie's birth, and when Moriarty had shot himself in the head. Maybe not when John was in that bonfire. He might've been more scared then.
“Sorry, this is Sherlock Holmes and my name is John Watson,” John tried for casual but he was sure he still sounded incredibly awkward. He silently pleaded for Sherlock to just sit down and behave for once.
This revelation was a sham. When he thought about it, really, it wasn't a revelation. It was more like finally someone nudged his focus and he could suddenly see.
Sherlock continued to be still as a statue, John couldn't help but marvel at the softness of his curls. It was almost a crime to let them go once Rosie's fingers had been carefully disentangled.
“Why does it scare you?”
This was their routine now, the daycare staff knew Sherlock would arrive at precisely 15:45, and Sherlock always took great care to have nothing going on every single Wednesday. If a level 10 case popped up on a Tuesday night, he would let it sit until after Rosie was asleep the following night. This had only happened once so far, and John had nearly admitted Sherlock to A&E for potential concussion or stroke at the time.
John couldn't hold back a chuckle. “This is getting ridiculous, Sherlock. I told you, I don't need a holiday.”
“You are her father.”
It helped. Every time I felt the calling of the needle, a desire to give in, to just stop existing, I'd think of those words. I'd rub my arm and remind myself, ground myself.
“John,” he said slowly, “I will say this one more time, and you know how I hate repeating myself, I am not interested in talking with Irene Adler”. Sherlock underlined his words by leaning forwards and resting his elbows on his knees, fingers steepled under his chin.
“Alright, just a moment,” she gave Sherlock a polite smile and picked up a phone receiver. “Hi, Auðun?” John had absolutely no idea if that was a general greeting or perhaps someone's name. “Yes, this is Steinunn here from the front desk. There is a man here asking for you.” Steinunn paused for a second, eyed them again, and pulled the receiver slightly away from her face. “What's your name?”
“Strap her in, I'm going to grab a squeeze pack,” John said and went for the fridge. He was still rummaging around for the most likely flavour of baby food to pacify Rosie, when suddenly the kitchen went very quiet.
I am 98% sure the saliva has not transferred to my arm, but I check anyway. A quick glance; and my world stops spinning.
“We need to lay down some ground rules if we're gonna do this,” John began, lifting Rosie up and into the seat on the swing. Once he was satisfied that she couldn't possibly fall out, he started pushing her gently. She squealed with delight. Sherlock stood and watched him silently, waiting for him to continue. “I mean, I can't bring her on crime scenes. I don't know what I was thinking, before. Probably not thinking at all.”
“John,” Sherlock started with a frown. “I'm not some imbecile. I know you'll leave, eventually. It's perfectly logical.”
“Stop thinking so loudly. It's annoying,” Sherlock spat, and John suppressed a shudder of shame. “You're misunderstanding. Stop thinking no one would want you just because you're 43 years old and you have young child. It's ridiculous. You're a
“I can speak for myself, John,” Sherlock hissed quietly.
,” Auðun said and waived Steinunn out the door which closed automatically with a dull thud.
Sherlock looked up. John! Of course, they needed to talk. Talk about Rosie. Where was she? Sherlock's eyes roamed around the kitchen, then towards the sitting room.
I nod again; don't want him to think it's not. He sighs at that and brings forth his whole hand. Not just his fingertips now, but his whole hand resting on my arm. His thumb raking back and forth over my skin, bringing so much warmth.
“I guess you're right. I messed up last time, anyway.”
“Can't we just take the next step?” he asked, his voice quiet and velvet.
Thoughtful John. Ever cautious, my John.
John turns, but he doesn't walk away, instead he walks around the table to stand next to me. I twist my torso to face him and look up. Search his eyes. Am I breathing?
Steinunn seemed unperturbed and switched instantly into English. “Is she expecting you?”
Nothing happened. Not really. Sherlock just sat there, petrified, except his eyes had started rapidly blinking. He was processing, John realised. He had done this exact same thing when John asked him to be his best man. He was in shock. He was having a sort of panic attack, John's inner doctor's voice supplied.
“Yoohoo!”
“I love you, Sherlock. There's no one else for me, or Rosie for that matter. I think I've been in love with you since I met you but I just didn't realise right away, and I understand if this makes you feel uncomfortable because you...”
Steinunn held the door open for them so they could enter with Rosie, then she let it fall closed and lead them down a narrow hallway until they reached an open space full of desks, paperwork, and chatting police officers. She beelined towards a door across from them and knocked sharply before opening it. John could see a brunette woman in her forties sitting behind a large desk as Steinunn ushered them inside. The woman, Auðun John presumed, looked up but didn't acknowledge them in any way.
“What?” John sat bolt-upright on the sofa and stared across the sitting room at Sherlock, who was, of course, lounging in his chair with his laptop delicately balanced on his knees.
“I thought it was
John hesitated for a second, glancing apologetically in Steinunn's direction, before following suit.
“Yes, and honey bees fly at 15 miles per hour with a wing stroke of 11,400 times per minute,” Sherlock drawled while staring at Rosie, fascinated.
Sherlock seemed to be done for now, so John let out a breath he'd been holding for a while. Auðun's face was hard to read. She either looked incredulous or astounded. Then something shifted and John was sure that now it was fury he was seeing in her face.
He was back at 221B, his daughter was happy and healthy, he was back to running around with Sherlock (within reason), and everything was good.
It was not like a permanent marker, simply resting on the top of my skin, ultimately fading away as my skin cells died and got replaced by new ones. This was ink, pure ink, pushed down through my Epidermis and deep into my Dermis where it would reside for the rest of my life.
“M-hm!”
“I can't see why not.” John called from the kitchen.
The bacon was calling John with snarks and snarls from the pan. He grabbed plates and started serving breakfast.
They were ridiculous. Two grown men, standing with a kitchen table between them, both professing their love like it was a weapon they could throw at one another. As John realised this, his feet were already carrying him around the table, towards Sherlock's unmoving figure.
“Well?” Sherlock demanded petulantly.
Sherlock groaned. It was her go-to answer to everything. 'Why are you drawing on the wall with a sharpie!' 'Because!' 'Why don't you hang up your jacket?' 'Because!' 'Why aren't you asleep yet?' 'Because!' Sherlock took a calming breath.
John is asking if I want tea. It's a bit too warm for tea, but it's John's so I hum and try to busy myself. Must look normal.
I notice my heart is beating furiously. I wonder when that happened. I dare not move.
“Bisexual,” he whispered.
“Yes,” Sherlock spat with a curt nod in the general direction of the offices that surely laid at the back of the building. Steinunn eyed them but didn't call out Sherlock's lie. Her eyes wandered over to Rosie; she was probably wondering why they had a baby in tow if they were on official business at a police station.
“Possibly.”
I might as well have said it. The words. Any idiot off the street could have seen the sentiment radiating from me. John is still. So very still. I hope he hasn't forgotten how to breathe. One of us needs to remember.
Sherlock flinched at that, and averted his eyes. “You can, er, yes, I mean. Fancy legos, sure.”
John couldn't believe it. Gay? In love? Waiting? He-
“That's not what I meant, Sherlock, and you know it!” At this, Sherlock opened both eyes and pointedly stared at him. John sagged a little, and returned to his chair. After a quiet moment, he murmured: “I could help you, you know. You'd just have to ask.” Because he would. Sherlock was obviously not experienced and just needed a little help. Irene was rather a handful after all. He glanced towards Sherlock and suddenly his breath was stuck in his chest. Sherlock had sat up and was looking at John with such disbelief carved in his features that John had to pinch his arm to check whether he was dreaming or not. Sherlock never looked like this.
“That's not actually how the sound-”
Sherlock threw a cheeky grin at him. “Mycroft would be jealous!”
Rosie looked deep in thought. She was considering the matter in utmost seriousness.
Sherlock tried pretending to himself that John's response hadn't hurt his feelings, but being able to acknowledge the fact that he had tried ultimately meant that he had failed.
“Here,” John passed him the packet. “Give her this while I make us a proper breakfast.”
John looked up. Sherlock was smiling. Genuinely smiling.
“Cubicle beds,” John snorted, finding this incredibly funny for some reason. Then again, he'd never seen anything like this before. Sherlock simply hummed and set their luggage down by one of the beds. John closed the door and stood awkwardly in the middle of the flat (Jesus, a flat!) with Rosie breathing sleepily on his neck. She'd woken up as he'd ascended the stairs earlier.
Once they got back to 221B, Sherlock gave Rosie some legos before collapsing into his chair in front of the fire. He hadn't bothered to shed his coat or gloves, but he didn't feel warm, not at all. In fact, he could feel a cold shiver running up his spine as he sat there, frozen like a marble statue. His mind was racing and he let himself fall back into his Mind Palace. He wandered around John's wing which now had a gorgeous greenhouse attached to it full of memories of Rosie. He knew he'd need to expand and give her her own wing one day, if he was lucky. Maybe John would get furious and move away and never contact him again and he figured the greenhouse would be enough if that happened. Just the thought of John leaving and taking Rosie with him caused Sherlock to shiver violently, although, he could only vaguely feel it, for he was deep within his Mind Palace and his transport was of little importance at the moment.
“Yes, John.”
“Earth to Sherlock!” John's singsong voice rung in Sherlock's ears. “Hey, you okay?” John had apparently deemed Sherlock back to the present enough to answer questions. He felt John's fingers curl around his wrist. John was taking his pulse.
“Great. We're going to get thrown out, aren't we?”
“Incredible.”
Sherlock sought John's lips once more and moaned wantonly when he kept missing. John helped by latching onto his bottom lip and
“That's why they're fancy!” Sherlock pouted.
“Sherlock?” John murmured into his ear, and Sherlock forced himself to take his eyes off Rosie to look at John.
“95% of Iceland's energy is renewable; if we rent an electric car it would do wonders for our carbon footprint.”
“Thanks, Daddy.” She said primly and dabbed at her cheeks with her uncoordinated toddler hands.
Rosie blinked up at him, seemingly befuddled. He was indeed aware that he was trying to have a serious discussion with an almost 4-year-old, but he met her gaze and nodded gravely, regardless.
I surprise myself by my honesty.
“Walk the plank, sea dog!” Rosie pointed a plastic hook at Mrs. Hudson, who giggled and left the flat with a 'you silly boys' and a few 'honestly's. Sherlock gave John a warm smile and moved so he could hold his hand again.
Sherlock's eyes tracked him as he rounded the table and stood in front of him, a foot shorter but unnerved.
I force myself to keep eye contact. It does not bode well to look away at a moment like this.
They moved to the couch in the sitting room to observe Rosie play with her fancy pirate lego set Sherlock had bought for her 3
Rosie was listening to him with rapt attention. John tried to hide his amazement, not wanting to scare Sherlock off again.
As wonderful as those mornings were, John knew he was missing something, he just didn't know what. Those sort of thoughts kept him up at night. He found himself lying awake at four in the morning making mental checklists of thing that made him happy and why.
“John?” Sherlock looked up from his microscope as John entered. He could swear he saw mirth in Sherlock's eyes even if he was trying to school his face into an expressionless mask.
Now it was John's turn to tear up. He let out an unsteady bark of a laugh and rubbed his eyes with his free hand.
“I'm not interested.”
Now he looks down into his mug. He hasn't had any of his tea yet. It's just sitting there, right in front of him, untouched. Like me.
“Can I play with the fancy legos, Daddy?” Rosie suddenly piped up.
I'll add it in the notes at the end as well, for those on mobile.
He seems receptive. At least in the moment.
“It's got volcanoes and glaciers.”
“Sherlock, John, nice to meet you. My name is Auðun Steinþórsdóttir.” She nodded at each of them as she said their names. “Care to tell me what you are doing here?” John had to admire her bluntness.
John realised Sherlock was deducing his thoughts by the emotions crossing his face.
', had Sherlock really been that moronic?
“I didn't expect to return, to come back to London. Back to you. So I thought I'd get away with this.”
Her soft curls, in particular.
“The motivation? Really?”
“I-,” Sherlock started, but realized he didn't know how to proceed, and god forbid finish. What were they talking about.
And with that, John kissed him again, ruffled his curls, then took a step back to gather his belongings.
“The Aurora Borealis should still be around at this time of year.”
He smiles now. Just a small smile. A fond smile.
Sherlock sounded confident, alright, but John could sense an unease about him.
“I know. Wanna tell me what it's about?” John tried to make his voice sound soft. Somehow, it didn't work.
Sherlock melted.
Sherlock was still blinking, but he was listening. John could tell.
What?
Sherlock looked from their hands at John, who'd just done the impossible. John, the most wonderful man he'd ever met, smiled back at him. Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth twitch upwards and gave into the smile erupting on his face.
He'd have to say it. Spell it out.
“This has been an incredibly long time coming, hasn't it?”
“I guess you have other concerns, then.”
“How very observant of you, John.” Sherlock swiped his card and opened the door.
There's a fair bit of dialogue in Icelandic in this chapter (and probably the rest of the fic once I finish writing it, but alas) but you should be able to hover over those bits to get the translation.
Sherlock took a deep breath and held it, forced himself to really look at John, then exhaled slowly. Careful.
John could hear him murmur quietly to her and stopped banging around with the pan to listen.
Keflavík Airport was incredibly windy. John grimaced as he wrapped his arms around Rosie and followed Sherlock who was being uncharacteristically helpful as he was dragging all of their luggage behind him.
“I asked when?”
“But you deserve one!”
“What truth?” John's voice was carefully neutral. Sherlock chocked on nothing. He kept his eyes shut.
John seems calm and collected. I don't know how he does it, because right now I feel like I'm watching myself from high above. I'm not sure I can connect with my body in this moment.
“What?” John was staring at him, dumbfounded. Sherlock squeezed his hand, softly. John let out a quiet 'oh', and looked down at their hands for a second, before squeezing back.
“Sherlock? Oh god, Sherlock, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-. Oh, shit. I've ruined-”. John cut himself off rather abruptly. Why? Because Sherlock had reached across the table and taken John's hand in his.
“I'm her father, not an idiot!” Sherlock protested and started cutting more bacon for Rosie.
“Well, I don't think that is-” Auðun started, but Sherlock, unfortunately, cut her off.
; Sherlock must be crying.
“I'm afraid you'll take offense and leave.” Sherlock had been ready to end there, but then he felt the words leave his mouth without his consent, again. “And I'm afraid to hurt Rosie's feelings when I have to tell her the truth.”
I didn't think I'd ever go back; back to John. It didn't feel real. Suddenly I'm sitting in my kitchen at 221B and John is there typing away slowly on his laptop.
, so Sherlock stayed quiet.
I adjust the focus of my microscope slightly and the red blood cells I'm studying jump into sharp focus. I'm aware of John. So aware.
“Here we are!” Sherlock announced and, with a flourish, indicated to a small green car. It looked brand new, and somewhat futuristic, John would admit, but it was rather tiny. Sherlock looked happy enough, so John just shrugged. “Don't worry, John. It comes with a car seat for Rosie.”
“Good. Any other concerns?” John was smiling now. No concerns. Except for the obvious. Parents were usually
“I love you.”
“That's why I was afraid, John. Not this exactly, rather, the opposite of this.” Sherlock muttered. John looked back up at him. Now or never. He was going to say it. “You see, for the past few years, actually, since shortly after you moved in, to be honest-”
. It was only mid afternoon and they were in a quiet respectable neighbourhood in the suburbs of Reykjavík. John knew the Icelandic people were tolerant and friendly, but somewhere they must draw the line. Surely.
Sherlock was calling from the kitchen while John was wrestling his 1 year old into a complicated pajama onsie.
John hummed softly and Sherlock's eyes darted back to his. John reached out with his left hand and laid it on the side of Sherlock's face.
“Be careful with that,” Sherlock was saying. “We don't want to get all dirty this early in the morning.”
And it was, because the next moment, John had thrown himself at Sherlock and snogged him senseless.
“Yes, you are. You like Rosie, I know that, but whenever I'm around you seem to tense up.”
“Sherlock? Are we staying in the backyard of Iceland's parliament?”
That had been a week ago.
“Okay?” John asked and kissed along Sherlock's jaw.
“Hoist the sails, you scally-wags! Hard to starboard, you lazy scoundrels, for we sail for Tortuga!”
“Yes.” John affirmed.
“I'd better leave, Sherlock. I don't know what I was thinking, bringing Rosie. This, the blood, is just-- oh god! I'm awful!”
“I'm not leaving you, Sherlock,” John murmured. “Eat your breakfast.”
“I'm sorry I called you a machine.”
“Yes, John,” Sherlock sighed with a put-on exasperation. “I will follow your silly little rules for Rosie's sake, now can I please tell you all my brilliant deductions I made at the crime scene?”
John chuckled softly, for he couldn't believe his luck.
John hauled him to his feet and proceeded to drag him into the kitchen. Sherlock felt his legs start moving on their own accord, helping John move his transport.
The only thing that mattered in this moment was that Sherlock was stepping out of the cab that had transported him to Rosie's daycare and since it was already 15:43, Sherlock was about 2 minutes from picking up Rosie; because today was Wednesday, and Wednesdays were good.
Unless what, he hadn't time to figure out because Rosie chose that moment to say:
“Good thing I came to check on you. Left to your own devices you'd have fossilized eventually.” John gave a half-hearted laugh at his own lame and inaccurate joke. Sherlock didn't tell him how that wasn't remotely close to how fossilization worked, which John then noticed and furrowed his brows. It was adorable. “Okay, you're scaring me now. Get up, I'm going to make you drink that tea I made you.”
“I love you.” Sherlock breathed. “I meant to say it before. I always have.”
“Is this okay?”
“So, you've been talking to her, then?”
Wednesdays were supposed to be good.
That's when it hit him.
I grab the slide from out of my microscope and put it on the side. I reach for my next specimen, saliva sample from a frozen corpse, and slide it in place. John is staying very still now.
“We're not going on holiday, Sherlock,” John said with an air of finality.
John busied himself by cleaning Rosie's face with the wash-cloth, she giggled and tried to suck on it, opening her mouth comically every time John stroked her cheeks.
Rosie, in general.
“Yes.”
“John, look at me,” Sherlock crouched down next to John's chair and put a hand on his knee, “it's okay.”
Sherlock could feel John's eyes track him all the way to his bedroom, and even after he'd closed the door, he could still feel a tingling sensation at the back of his neck as if John's eyes had been lasers that left permanent nerve damage wherever they lingered. He sat down on his bed, suddenly realizing he was stuck in his bedroom with nothing to do. He was still wearing his coat and scarf. Stupid. He furiously tugged on his scarf until it pooled on the floor between his feet, then shrugged the coat off. He could hear the faint buzzing of his mobile from somewhere within the folds of his coat. He'd set it to vibrate because today was Wednesday.
“I know you are an idiot, John, but this is taking it a step too far”.
who couldn't return my affections!”
Rosie was skipping next to Sherlock, clutching his hand and swinging it back and forth. He liked taking her on public transport rather than a cab; she loved the ticket gates at the Tube. They stopped by a bakery and bought pastries for themselves and some bread for the ducks. Rosie got to pay with Sherlock's card, but he had to lift her up to the counter so she could tap it against the machine. She giggled when the cashier thanked her for her purchase, and then she demanded to carry the bread all the way to Regent's Park.
“I feel, John. I feel a lot, in fact.”
An abrupt burst of hope springs into life somewhere inside my chest cavity.
“Hello, little Watson,” he said in greeting and swung her around in a circle. He was acutely aware of the usual staff looking at them with unusual interest, so he put Rosie down and led her to where her outside clothes hung.
“I'm not sure I understand,” said Auðun slowly. “I don't see a camera crew trailing behind you so I'm assuming you're serious.”
“And this morning, Ragnar Jónsson was found with his head bashed in on his living room floor.”
John regarded Sherlock with fondness in his eyes. Sherlock was staring at his own hands.
“That was obvious,” John snickered. “Is it a case?”
John, in his revelation, could barely move a muscle. He gulped down his tea as a distraction and glanced to his right at Rosie who was smirking blissfully from her high-chair. John realised that Sherlock wasn't going to say anything more on the matter. It was all up to him. John would have to take the first step.
He begins, but stalls a bit. He twirls his mug and I hold my breath. The silver lining is that neither of us is likely having a stroke.
The hair on the back of my neck bristles and my stomach rolls. My left eyelid feels tingly and the likelihood of me having a stroke rises 35%.
“Answer me first.” John's voice had an edge to it now. Dangerous.
“A text, John.”
“Papa Pirate?” She tried out, then grinned and her laughter danced into Sherlock's heart. “It's perfect!”
“Are you done with your cinnamon bun?”
I surprise John as well, it seems, because he looks up at me and his eyes are impossibly round. I can see his left hand inch forwards a bit and twitch slightly.
Do what exactly? Kiss him? Hold his hand?
“Our relationship?” Sherlock thought he sounded inarguably stupid.
This was awful. He knew Sherlock didn't want him to leave, but would he want this? Did he truly want some middle age fool in love with a toddler in tow? Most likely not.
“Relax, I'm glad you got her to stop trying to breach the sound barrier.”
“I failed in that respect. I feel attached and it scares me.”
John resigned and leaned back in his chair, listening.
“No, honey, don't hit Daddy,” John murmured and promptly got another wet smack to the cheek, “at least not in the face”.
And off they went.
John is trying to calm me down, I know that I should let him, but my body is stubbornly locked in the fight or flight response.
“Auðun was not expecting you but she's willing to see you anyway,” she rose from her chair and walked towards a door to their right. “Follow me.”
At that, Sherlock timidly approached where John was fighting the screaming banshee. John moved out of the way and handed Sherlock the straps.
“You are able to string way too many syllables together way too coherently right now. Let's fix that.” John whispered against Sherlock's earlobe, which made him shudder. John grabbed Sherlock's rear with both hands and pulled them together. It was electrifying.
He could see Sherlock roll his eyes as he sat back down next to Rosie and retrieved her plate.
“Explain, please.” John's voice: still carefully neutral.
John nods again and I swallow nothing. These are crossroads, as I understand them. This moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
Come to think of it, his transport was not just shivering, it was positively shaking. Sherlock surfaced and realize that he was indeed shaking. He was being shaken. By John. John!
John barely held back an exasperated sigh. “It's master, you git. You need to practice something for 10.000 hours to become a master, Sherlock, and that's just something people say. It's not hard science,” he finished lamely, but followed Sherlock anyway into the eerie darkness of the house.
“Well, Johnathan asked me what I call my daddies, and I said Dad and Sherlock. Then Kevin said that you couldn't be my daddy if I called you Sherlock because that's not a daddy name. He calls his mommies Mum and Mummy. So now I call you Daddy and Dad is Dad, because you're my daddies and daddies aren't called Sherlock.”
The victim had travelled from Asia only 12 hours before their death. I can recognize bacteria found in South-East Asia, although that could be the result of illegally imported cuisine. I must double check that.
The door fell shut behind them with a soft thud, and John steeled himself for an undoubtedly very awkward encounter.
“I think it's incredibly beautiful.” There was something in Sherlock's voice that made John turn to look at him. Sherlock's eyes snapped to the road again.
“I rather think you've stolen my thunder, John.” He said gravely. His wide grin probably gave him away, though.
“I love you too.”
“Sorry, sorry, a lot to unpack there.” He heard John sigh and rub his face. “Hey, look at me, Sherlock.” He really didn't want to, but he opened his eyes anyway. He had a sneaking suspicion that they were wet and glistening. Embarrassing. “God, Sherlock.” John exclaimed and
I chose a nondescript font, for the very meaning of the words were more important than the look of them.
“Not you Dad, I'm asking Daddy!” Rosie called back. This time, she was definitely grinning like she was up to no good. Sherlock shook his head minutely.
They were almost at the station according to John's phone when Sherlock suddenly burst into giggles.
Today was Wednesday, and Wednesdays were good.
“It's a tattoo, John. Ink embedded in my dermis. You're a doctor, don't play dumb.”
.” Steinunn paused for a second, eyed them again, and pulled the receiver slightly away from her face. “What's your name?”
“Fulgurous!”
His soft curls, in particular.
“John, that's not true. We're not just offering our help
“Okay, look, since you insist,” John started. He had to pause a bit to transfer bits of bacon onto Rosie's plate. She was getting restless. “I'm not sure you'll welcome this, but since you insist on understanding whatever this is, I guess I'll just say it.”
“On your arm.”
“Today we learned about mommies and daddies, and how some people have two mommies instead of one mommy and one daddy, and I told them I had two daddies. Kevin's got two mommies but everyone else got mommies and daddies. Except for Gladys, she got only one mommy and no daddy.” Rosie took another bite of her cinnamon bun as if that had been explanation enough.
The bacon had started sizzling on the pan when John casually turned around and leaned against the counter. Sherlock froze again under his gaze and John couldn't help but ask.
Sherlock still didn't speak, but he did close the distance to them and started pushing Rosie from the other end. John faltered a little. The sight of Sherlock doing something so utterly domestic threw him off.
“Boys, I love having her, honestly, but I really must go now. My bridge night with the girls started 20 minutes ago and I've yet to call a cab.” Mrs. Hudson walked into the kitchen from the sitting room, hands on her hips. “Are you done with your little domestic? Am I free to leave?”
I'm way ahead of you, John, but at the same time a lap behind.
He was staring at John now, wide eyed.
” Another pause as she listened for a reply. Her eyebrows drew together and she frowned slightly. Oh, here we go. “
“You really think I don't feel like you do? Well you're wrong.”
And he deserves to know.
Sherlock froze and stared at her unblinkingly. He could have sworn he saw a mischievous glint in her eyes, the devil.
I am so glad for him, which in turn makes me terrified of him.
Sherlock beamed. “Plus, it's a
Sherlock had no concept of time when John quietly opened the door to his bedroom. He had no idea how long he'd been sitting there staring blankly at the wall in front of him. Not moving. Not even thinking. He just felt numb.
“You?” Sherlock croaked.
John paused, clearly not as confident as he wanted to portray. Still, he was talking in
Mornings, these days, were John's favourite part of the day. He would wake up ridiculously early to feed his grouchy toddler, then usually around 30 minutes later his other, and considerably taller, grouchy toddler would stumble into the kitchen and refuse to be fed.
He took a deep breath and let it out. Ahh.
. If we get into trouble, what will become of Rosie, huh?” John set his jaw and glared hotly at Sherlock, who stood a bit dumbfounded for a second. Then Rosie kicked him in the head on her return swing and laughed shrilly. It was the most beautiful sound in the world and he couldn't help grinning like an idiot. Sherlock grunted and rubbed the side of his head, but John could see his lips twitching at the corners.
“Didn't you say something about this place being beautiful?” John criticized. The landscape looked bleak, so far. They were driving down a highway in the middle of nowhere. Literally. The North Atlantic to their left. Empty moss covered lava plain on their right.
Sherlock straightened like a rod and started spluttering.
“You're right. I thought we were just discussing that. Our relationship. And how Rosie fits in it.” John looked a bit puzzled. Sherlock felt like he'd slipped into an alternate reality.
Sherlock stopped flailing his arms and just stared. His, at the moment, blue eyes were radiant.
My wonderful John. My interesting John. My forgiving John.
Or rather, The Icelandic Phallological Museum.
He caught up with him on the second floor. “The clerk said apartment, not room.”
“Are we alright?” John inquired. He was worried. Five minutes ago, they had been Sherlock and John, best friends and flatmates. Now, they were something different, weren't they?
Sherlock opened one eye to glare at him. “I don't know. I haven't looked at it, have I?”
And wasn't that just the point?
He sat down himself and started tucking into his own food. Sherlock still hadn't moved an inch and Rosie had started to tug on his curls.
“Which of you is Sherlock?” Auðun finally broke the silence and Sherlock bristled visibly, but didn't answer immediately.
He's asking me a direct question. He's also looking me directly in the eye.
, especially now, is just ludicrous!” John shook his head, chuckling softly. He found John's behaviour endearing, but Sherlock felt confused.
“Yarrr!! Mateys!”
they need it. We're saying we'd like to be brought in on the case, full stop.” Sherlock turned back to Auðun who was staring up at him aghast. “Please?” he added after a brief consideration, but of course it sounded like he was shamming politeness. Which he was. John knew then and there that the fight was over.
“Morning, can you lend me a hand with her real quick?” John glanced back at Sherlock who stood frozen by the fridge. “Sherlock, come on, before my ears fall off!”
“Good, I love you. Don't you forget it.”
I should tell him. We are, after all, just sitting here in our kitchen. In our flat. Our home.
Auðun looked even more confused than before, but Sherlock seemed to consider John's brief explanation more than enough and therefore stayed silent.
“I'm just her dad's flatmate.” Sherlock spat out. His eyes were stinging now, behind his eyelids, which he kept scrunched up.
“What do you mean, last time?”
“Am not.”
“When you were gone, I- well, I wasn't in a good place.”
This sent Sherlock into hysterics. He was leaning against the wall, clutching his middle, and cackling. They were attracting a fair bit of attention, now, but John couldn't give a rat's arse about what other people thought. He was having the time of his life with his best friend, and it was perfect.
“No.” My voice feels odd, like sand against the soft linings of my vocal cords.
“Yeah?” He called back and carefully threaded Rosie's right foot into place, making sure her little toes didn't get caught between the snap-and-click buttons that ran all the way down the leg of the onsie.
“No, it's not like that. I- well, just don't freak out, okay? I think, actually I know, that I won't be able to love anyone again. Not while you're still here. Because, Sherlock, I- err,” John trailed off and swore under his breath. What a coward. Sherlock needed to know, he
“Nope.”
“Murder, remember?” John had hissed, but Sherlock had simply pouted at him.
“She's downstairs, playing with her fancy legos at Mrs. Hudson's.” John supplied. John was reading him, this was all wrong.
” John tightened his grip on Rosie's stroller. “
birthday. It had quickly become her favourite. She handed Sherlock a familiar looking lego pirate.
“Why not?” John spat out, half giggling, half concerned.
“I think we need to talk about this.”
.” There's that tone. Confusion. They were so going to get kicked out. “
“Can you please do the voice, Papa?” She pleaded, testing out Sherlock's new parental term at the same time. It was perfect.
I thought he was making tea?
I was in Instanbul when I got it; just a tiny little collection of letters on the inside of my right forearm. It was a little over a year into my self-exile and I had been pondering over my decision for months by that point. It wasn't exactly a thoughtful, objective, conscious decision; it was a need, and I caved.
Why does he keep saying that?
“Nonsense, John.”
“Should we turn on the lights?” John inquired, but Sherlock had already pulled out a pocket flash-light and was brandishing it vehemently, illuminating what appeared to be copious amounts of blood on the floor. “Oh, god! I've already made my daughter into an accomplice”.
. John was currently trying to look inconspicuous while holding a baby and glaring at a certain Consulting Detective who was, of all things,
Sherlock cleared his throat softly but otherwise didn't move. John decided they had indeed waited long enough and the next step was inevitable, so he took the last step towards Sherlock.
John answered with: “What about Iceland?”
“So, when you said bashed-,” John started.
“If you say so.”
And this would be it. They would have some tea, and the moment would pass and they would both pretend that nothing weird had happened. John wouldn't ask Sherlock what was wrong, and Sherlock wouldn't talk about the 'Daddy' thing. Eventually, things would simply go back to normal.
It feels a bit easier, now that it's all out in the open. Now that his eyes aren't piercing into my soul.
“Hey, you okay?” John inquired softly. Sherlock was aware of John's presence but he couldn't make his eyes pan over to look at him. Now that he was aware, he realized he couldn't move at all.
Since then, Sherlock had called out random, albeit interesting, facts about foreign countries every day. His whole let's-go-on-holiday-idea had been far from dropped. Sherlock was adamant about the three of them going abroad to some holiday destination together, for some reason. John's strategy, so far, had been to just ignore him, hoping Sherlock would soon find a new experiment or a case to distract him.
That smile followed John as he positively skipped towards the nearest tube station on his way to work.
“Women are not my area, I've told you this.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John had stopped seeing the humour in this situation.
Mouth and brain cancel each other out and I'm left sitting here, slightly haunched over my microscope, looking up at John's perfect eyes through my lashes.
“So, err, ground rules, yeah?” John stepped to the side, allowing Sherlock to push Rosie by himself. He leaned against the sturdy wooden frame of the swing set. “We need to find someone to watch Rosie while we investigate the case, and only for a few hours at a time. This is still a vacation and I want to do vacation stuff with her... and you, so no running off on your own.”
They finally managed to calm down a bit and after a short walk, they arrived at their destination. The Reykjavík Metropolitan Police was housed in an unassuming white building next to a large bus station. Now that they were here, John felt anxiety pooling in his belly. Sherlock didn't have the best track record when it came to officers of the law. He had no idea how Sherlock came to work with the Yard and now he regretted not asking about it. He had a vague theory involving Sherlock maybe stumbling onto a crime scene while high and spouting off outrageous deductions until Greg either started taking him seriously or arrested him. It had probably been both. He made mental note about asking Greg about it over a pint once he got back to London, knowing Sherlock would probably never tell him the whole truth.
Now it was John's turn to lose it. He took a couple of deep breaths, trying to steel himself, before he burst out laughing. There they stood. Two men in their late thirties and early forties, one in a bespoke suit, the other with a baby in a stroller, and they were positively howling with laughter.
“Yes, yes. Of course. I'm sorry,” John blurted out, stood up, and practically shoved Sherlock out the door. They walked briskly towards the lobby, John not daring to look back. If they hurried, they might avoid arrest.
“You yourself got up late this morning, probably due to your inability to stop working even when at home, and did a sloppy job of buttering your son's sandwiches before hastily putting them in a lunch-box he doesn't prefer. He's bound to complain after school today. Furthermore, you are no closer to solving this murder than you were two days ago, and the public's demand of quick closure is driving your boss around the bend. I'm sure the press will be relentless tomorrow afternoon if you're unable to show further developments.”
He's looking me in the eyes now, and I notice his breath growing steadily more normal. He is calming down and I don't understand why because now I'm the one on the verge of a panic attack.
“Oh.” John felt something clutch at his chest. “That's, yeah, good. Very thoughtful. Thank you, Sherlock.” Sherlock gave him a small smile.
“Because,” Rosie stated finally.
John sighed. Of course he didn't. Sherlock wasn't like that, was he? He survived on ones and zeros. He was logical, and what John was proposing wasn't based on logic, it was based on emotion.
“John,” Sherlock all but whined. “I thought I told you before. This is Iceland. Murders are incredibly rare and one needs at least 10.000 hours of practice to become adequate at something. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the Reykjavík Police Department consists of utter imbeciles.” Sherlock pocketed his tools with a graceful flick of his wrist to further nail home the point that he was the expert here, the impossible wanker.
I need to pull myself together. I owe him that, at least.
Sherlock's voice was getting steadier. He almost sounded angry.
“I didn't know how long we'd be staying, so I thought I'd better go with this rather than two separate rooms. This way, I can mind Rosie if she wakes up fussing in the middle of the night,” Sherlock mumbled sheepishly.
Something is definitely wrong now. I hope he's not having a stroke because I can't save him from a stroke. I can't reach into his brain and remove a blood clot. I wish I could.
Probably just as well really, considering Sherlock deduced that he's been organising a dog-fighting ring in Camden, and as Molly is a dedicated animal lover it was never going to work… especially not after Sherlock tipped off Greg and everyone involved got arrested… Just one more public service for you…
Of course, John had to agree, and before he knew what was going on, he found himself with a mouthful of the foulest thing he’d ever tasted.  He thought to himself later that he should have known it would be awful; the girl had dreadlocks, and was wearing a tie-dyed skirt in a muddy brown colour and a necklace that had obviously been hand woven.  John’s naturally genial manner ensured he didn’t just spit the whole mouthful out onto the floor, but it was a close run thing.  Sherlock didn’t give John any chances to refuse more samples, but kept grabbing the next pot from the stand and shoving it at him, saying, “Try this one next, John!”
Some notes on my personal version of the Omegaverse:
Sherlock’s movement and words unlocked the realisation in John’s brain – Sherlock wanted him back! “Yes, oh god yes,” said John, one had moving up to grip Sherlock’s hair, while the other pulled the purple shirt he loved out of Sherlock’s trousers and finally touched his skin.  Sherlock scrabbled frantically at John’s underwear, grabbing his cock in his large hand and stroking.  John threw his head back, eyes closing automatically as a groan left his throat, and his hand returned to Sherlock’s trousers, undoing the button and zip to free his cock.  He took Sherlock in his hand, gripping firmly, and they both began to pump their hips, cocks sliding in the firm grip of each other’s hands.  The kisses became even more frantic, until with a sharp cry, Sherlock spilled over John’s hand, his thigh and his shirt.  The sight of his face, eyes screwed tightly shut and mouth open was enough to push John over the edge, and he followed Sherlock into orgasm, coating his expensive trousers with his seed.
John furrowed his brow, looking at Sherlock… or was it Jilly?  He decided that the first thing he needed to do was to work out who was who.  It would be easier, he considered, to call each of them by the names of their conscious self.  He couldn’t imagine Jilly being able to work out that when he said “Sherlock” he was referring to her, so for the time being, the detective’s body would be Jilly, and the Great Dane’s would be Sherlock.  It was surprisingly easy once he had gotten his head around it, the keen and perceptive gaze coming from the canine body probably had a lot to do with it.
When Greg had finished laughing, he spoke. “You sent a help text with your arse because Sherlock didn’t like you snogging another man?  That’s priceless! Don’t worry, I won’t let
“Well?  Can you give me anything?”  Sherlock’s reply was soft, as though he was trying not to disturb Xander.
Sherlock fussed around him, tucking pillows and blankets in, virtually trapping John in a woolly cocoon, until he roused enough to say, "Sherlock, what the hell?" and was released a little.  John reached out for Alex, and Sherlock carefully tucked him into the crook of John's arm, moving a pillow underneath his elbow to help support Xander's head.  John let out a loud sigh, and snuggled his nose into the soft downy hair on the top of Alex's head, and the pair of them promptly fell asleep.
He followed John down the corridor and into the office, throwing himself into a chair at John’s invitation.  “You’re bored,” John stated flatly.  “It’s only a matter of time until you really get yourself in trouble, and this is your last hope – after that it’s prison.  Is that what you really want?”  Sherlock swallowed hard.  “Of course I’m bored, people are so stupid!  I can’t imagine what it’s like in their funny little brains!  I don’t want to go to prison, but I don’t know what else to do, sometimes I think I’ll go insane from boredom!”
“What are you playing at, you git, get over here…” came the slightly slurred mumble from the bed, as John opened one eye.  “I can hear you thinking from here, it’s annoying,” and at that, he opened the other eye, pushing his hands down into the mattress to attempt to lever himself upright in the bed.  At John’s grimace of pain and whoosh of breath, Sherlock’s indecision broke, and he rushed to the side of the bed, hands gently pressing John back down into the mattress.
“Okay Sherlock, so what do we do about this?  IS there anything we can do about it?”  Sherlock managed to convey a shrug with the body of a Great Dane, and John’s admiration only increased.  “Look Sherlock, we need to find a way to communicate properly.  How about if I grab the tiles from the scrabble set, can we make that work?”  Sherlock cocked his head on one side, contemplated for a moment or two, then nodded.  John struggled up from the sofa, and went to rummage around in the cupboard for a few moments.  The roadworker pounding in his head with a pneumatic drill seemed to have taken a coffee break, and left it to Mr Muscle to gently stroke John’s brain with a feather duster. He swept everything on the coffee table over to one side, and tipped the contents of the box out, tossing the board and racks back inside, leaving just a jumbled heap of letters there.  He sorted through them swiftly, turning them all letter side up, then into piles of individual letters, arranged alphabetically.
