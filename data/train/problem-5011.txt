Steve doesn’t answer that, and he tries very hard not think of the life he and Peggy could have had here. There’s no way Tony couldn’t have known about Peggy, so he must have said that as retaliation for Steve’s earlier observations about Tony’s character. Despite the rapport that they’ve established over the course of this whole budget debacle, he suspects that Tony is still very wary of this new relationship, thus the tit for tat attitude.
He takes a moment and swallows another gulp of beer. “You know I’m in love with her, Kate. I want to be with her. Obviously, she doesn’t feel the same way, or I wouldn’t be—” he stretches his arms wide, as if to hug his whole apartment, “—
Thor closes his eyes and thinks for a moment. “We have a week to prepare. It’s not a lot of time, but given the circumstances, we will need to make do with what we have.”
“I haven’t seen everyone this excited since Barton was about to face plant himself at Thor’s wedding,” Jessica greets them, amused.
“I thought you were thinking about resigning, or worse, had gotten sick! Way to give a girl a heart attack, Steve.”
“Of you and me potentially getting back together, you mean,” Rumiko adds without a beat. “Are you going to tell me why, or is this another one of those need-to-know things?”
Tony rubs his eyes. “How can we talk about it without actually talking about it?” He hangs his head on the backrest and stares at the ceiling. He doesn’t even try hiding how he feels: bone-tired and war-weary.
They all murmur their good mornings and Bruce makes a move to the left of Tony, guessing that now is as good a time as any for him to introduce Steve to him. “Sir, this is Anthony Stark, the Speaker of the House.”
He doesn’t look at her, head down as if ashamed. “I didn’t want to burden anyone with this,” he tells her softly. “It’s stupid anyway.”
Pepper can only stare at Natasha in disbelief. The fearless and fearsome DNC National Chair turns to look at Pepper with a wicked smile. Pepper knows that smile, and she is deathly afraid of that smile. That smile means that no matter how brilliant Tony’s plan is, no matter how well this all turns out for the party, Natasha will be plotting her revenge on Tony for keeping her in the dark.
“And our most important and urgent bills taken hostage with killer amendments,” Pepper adds, remembering the silent threat she had made to Maria Hill three months before with the Women’s Health Act.
Clint chuckles,and Kate couldn’t be happier to hear at least a modicum of cheer still present in him. “No I didn’t, actually. Tony is Tony and he gave me useless advice, but he told me to do what I think is best, offhandedly.”
Suddenly, Natasha spots some movement by the front of the structure. “Over there,” she points, and Clint drives slowly towards the direction Natasha is indicating.
“I know, I thought about that too. So maybe you could bring your own date? Like Pepper,” Steve suggests.
Kate rushes to the DOJ right after ending her call with Darcy, but America had already left the building. She thinks it a little awkward to contact America and ask where she is after not having seen or heard from her in more than six months, but this is important, and she can’t let the team down. So she sucks it up and calls her once-BFF, and they agree to meet at a place they used to frequent.
a major operation,” Cassie answers with a groan, remembering that year. “He totally math-ed the whole thing.”
“Hill’s a bully,” Natasha answers. “If she wants something, she’s going to get it. Doesn’t matter whose toes she steps on, and that’s exactly what she’s been doing. She’s been ignoring Rogers and has gone deeper into the dark side.”
“For what happened between us last March.” Clint tries to wave it off as something inconsequential. “I was out of line and it affected our personal and working relationship.”
They sit there quietly for a few minutes, with Kate resting her head on his shoulder, her hand on his thigh and his hand on hers. She’s missed this, missed being together like this—no words needed, just their presence and awareness of each other. She has missed her best friend above all else, and it feels good to be like this again, even if it’s just for a brief moment.
“Oh wow, he is actually only slightly late to the meeting today. I’m impressed, Stark. Miracles do happen,” Wade Wilson greets him.
He wasn’t exactly a good kid—he got into trouble once in a while—but he kept to himself most of the time and made it a point to do well in school. He did well enough to get into a state school with a full ride, and later Columbia Law, where he was finally able to make his own decisions and take complete charge of his own life. But that meant slowly cutting ties with his family and pushing his past as far down a deep, black hole of forgetting as he possibly could.
Tony sits up straight, bottle forgotten. He clasps his hands and rests his chin on them, eyes narrowed at Clint. Clint pours himself another shot of scotch. Looking at the half-filled glass, he pours some more until it’s filled because you could have looked at it as half-full but when Tony Stark actually gives you a serious look, you know no amount of scotch is going to be enough.
“Mm. Thank you for that, by the way,” Steve commends him. “That was pretty ingenious of you, controlling the news cycle that way.”
Kate nods, muted and apologetic. She doesn’t say anything more, wary about antagonizing her boss further.
Happy drops them off at Tony’s with a SHIELD car some hour and a half later. It's nearly midnight—the picturesque Georgetown street where Tony lives is eerily quiet. The cold is sharp, oppressing even, and Natasha and Clint hurry inside the townhouse after thanking Happy for the ride.
Matt nods. “Yes, but that might not mean much. A lot of other big companies and even universities hire them to do research or augment whatever they’re cooking up in their own labs.”
“The team must be told about Loki immediately.” Thor kisses the top of Jane’s head. “Excuse me while I call Natasha and try to assemble everyone for an urgent meeting later today.” He takes his leave of the kitchen.
“Let’s make this quick,” Natasha starts, clearly impatient and ready to get the meeting over with. “I know many of you are leaving for your respective Thanksgiving celebrations tonight. Clint, do you want to start?”
not being turned away!” Thor had an unreadable expression, one filled with so much anger, frustration, and something else—something thoroughly gloomy. “And you dare talk about family? Family is supposed to be there for each other in times of great need.” His eyes had darkened then, and he had said to Loki in the most accusatory tone, “If this is your family, then where the hell were you when father was sick? Where were you when he died?”
“He probably is,” Tony tells them. “That’s the only reason why he’d step down before being served. He’s a formidable Supreme Court Justice and a highly regarded member of the legal profession. If the charges are hollow, he’ll stay and ride it out, but odds are the evidence against him is solid, if the charges are moving forward.” He turns to Clint again. “Who’s filing charges?”
“You don’t think he’s done that? The guy looks like he’s about to keel over, and it’s only been three weeks since Thanksgiving. This investigation is sucking the life out of him. The man lives alone, Tash, with no one but a voice in the ceiling to keep him company. No, look at me.” Clint puts his hands on her shoulders, looking at Natasha square in the eye. “There are almost a dozen other members on this team, Tash. You have to trust the rest of us to do the dirty work for you. Tony can’t bear to disappoint you so he keeps saying yes, keeps pushing himself for you, because you forget that you have me, Pepper, Thor, Janet, Darcy, and Kate. Hell, even Wade will walk through fire for you if you ask him.”
The Speaker of the House is generous in his storytelling, laying it out bare for the DNC National Chair, which he doesn’t do very often. More than acquiescence to Natasha’s conditions, it is another way of saying
“After all these years, you’re still surprised? You know how much my constituents love me.” He turns to the crowd inside his house, raises his glass of club soda and yells, “California!”
Steve shrugs. “Why shouldn’t it be? Our familiarity has so far been productive and positive. I don’t see why we should change that because we’re in the Oval Office.”
Tony didn't look at Captain Rogers. He shrugged. "It's not that important," he said. He reached out and took the little sword. He gave him an experimental flick and smiled. "Lighter than I remember."
The others settled in and Tony resigned himself to cheerful and banal small talk until he could summon up the energy to make the trek back to Shield Hall. Even as he focused his attention on his hosts and began to ramp up his charming persona, he felt the absence of the Captain in the room like an open wound.
Oh, Lord. "I insist they stay with you," Tony said firmly. "I will be just fine on my own and there are robbers in the woods."
Sousa looked flustered for the first time. "Oh. Well." He threw Tony a slightly desperate look. "Wouldn't Lord Stark be more suited—"
Tony blinked innocently. He could see Peggy stifling a smile out of the corner of her eye, ducking her head so that her expression was hidden behind her gently curled hair.
A firm hand forced his head between his knees. The sudden change in equilibrium made him to gasp and suddenly air could find its way through his lungs again. For several long moments, all he could do was focus on the weave of the carpet below his feet and breathe in and out; too fast at first, and then more steadily. The hand between his shoulder blades didn’t move and its warmth and steadiness allowed Tony to focus his thoughts into something other than the a hurricane of emotion.
“Lord Stark,” he said. Tony didn't bother to ask how he knew - even if he hadn't been around when Tony was a child, everyone had always told him how much he took after Howard. “What a surprise so early in the morning. What can I do for you?”
in there. Cheeky little sod. By that little smirk on his face, he knew it, too. Tony scowled at him and crossed his arms over his chest. If Harley didn't believe that he knew what he was talking about, it wouldn't be for long.
“You want to go into town later today,” he parroted out of sheer habit. Pepper blinked, then scowled.
"Harley Keener," Toomes said. "He's been making a nuisance of himself this month. This is his fourth time being caught stealing food." He gripped the boy's shoulder; his hand looked enormous on it. "Look up, boy. Lord Stark has taken an interest in you."
Yinsen cut him an unimpressed stare. He could probably quit being a doctor and just go around the country being unimpressed by people but Tony didn't think he wanted to hear that.
“You aggravate me so much!” Pepper said. “Why must you always make me feel like I’m fourteen, Anthony Stark!”
He folded the letter and put it back in its envelope. He replaced it in the box. He glanced at the flickering candle and then, resigned at his own terrible decision, reached in and withdrew another letter.
"Foolish of him. Your cousin is lucky to have someone like you beside her." Captain Roger's voice was warm and intimate. "She is a sweet girl, but I've seen that yours is the character of firmness. If you love her, you'll give her as much of that as you can." Captain Rogers' warmth became a little shy. "My first wish for anyone I'm—interested in is that they should be firm. If you keep that presence of mind, you'll be as happy as an old woman as you are now."
Jarvis’s hard look said he was not fooled. “You were very close,” he said again, more meaningfully. “And while I have never been sure of the details, I am aware that you had a—falling out, of sorts, before he left to fulfill his post with the Navy."
Tony winked at her. "Perhaps I will become one of them if you don't come back to rescue me, Miss Carter."
He followed the road into town and took the sharp left that Sharon had said would lead him to the Wilsons' house. It was a tidy little property surrounded by hedges - Tony was about to take a turn around the corner to try to find a gate when he heard voices floating out from somewhere inside. He froze.
That stung, but it was a fair blow. It was what Tony deserved for eavesdropping. He clenched his fists and released them.
A walk. A chaperone. Tony took in the cozy intimacy between them, the flush on Peggy's cheeks. His stomach hollowed out. Oh. So Sharon hadn't been wrong after all, about Captain Rogers paying particular attention to Peggy.
! I’m not a child, Tony. I can take care of myself and this baby. I don’t need you or Rhodey to swoop in and save me.”
Tony sighed. "Your mother was kind to me when she had no reason to be," he said. "I was just this little lord's brat and she never turned me away. Doesn't sit well with me not to pay my respects, even if you and I aren't—getting along right now."
Tony's stomach dropped to his toes. For a long moment, all he could do was blink down at his hands, mind full of white noise and panic. When he could finally make himself look at Bella, she smiled sadly at him.
“Maria just said a big blond man,” she said. “I can hardly believe it can be Steve. He was shorter than me for our entire childhood.”
Reaching the top of the stairs, Tony bent to give her cheek a kiss. She allowed it, then pushed him away with a laugh. Without any other recourse, Tony turned to face their guests.
For a long, suspended moment something clicked and he could feel that freedom in his grasp. The weight of his guilt and hurt and regret lifted as Goose galloped; he was outside of himself, too focused on the dark trees and cool night air and the heaving bulk of the horse underneath him to spare any attention for his thoughts. It was brilliant. It was peaceful.
Barnes didn't look convinced, but it wasn't like he was particularly easy to read anymore. He made a low noise in the back of his throat and shook his head.
Tony thought about Fury's bulk and black clothes and eyepatch. He'd pretty much become immune to the whole effect after years and years of being his neighbor, but it was probably pretty scary to a kid. Hm.
." Parker scowled. It was completely unintimidating on him. "I couldn't let Mr. Toomes cut off Harley's hand!"
“Don’t be sorry,” Pepper said stiffly. She sighed and seemed to relax a little. “I would never want you to apologize for being yourself, Tony,” she continued. “I’m the one with the issue. I’ll get over it.”
Her smile widened. "I think," she told her husband in a particular tone of voice, "it would do you both some good."
"Still skinny." That disapproval was familiar too. Tony had to smile. "What're they feeding you at Cambridge? Coffee and books?"
"No, you don't." Rhodey was too nice to hate anyone. "Rhodey, come on. You used to back him up against those townie kids."
Tony relaxed in his chair, some of the tension he'd been carrying with him since they'd left Shield Hall sloughing away. Small talk, meeting new people, his messy relationship with Captain Rogers, watching Peggy fall in love with the only man he'd ever cared for - all of it was either confusing or painful. Explaining advanced geometrical equations, on the other hand, he could do in his sleep.
Silence stretched between them, heavy and taunt. Tony's heartbeat kicked up and his stomach twisted into a hard, uncomfortable knot. He needed to say something. Anything. But he could barely focus under the weight of Captain Rogers' blue stare, his steady presence. Sweat broke out along his neck.
"How did you even know, anyway?" he muttered as she started to wrap the linen around his torso. It wasn't strictly necessary - he was sure he hadn't broken anything - but Bella had insisted on taking extra precautions, citing Tony's extraordinary susceptibility to any ailment known to man. "It's barely seven o'clock."
The table was too quiet. Tony was very aware that he'd just spoken more in the presence of Captain Rogers than he had in years, never mind that the Captain knew his feelings on the matter personally. They'd had this exact argument before. Some of it must have stuck if he could still rattle off Euler's identity without pausing.
“Uncle just received a letter from Stark Manor!” she said. “We’re to dine with the Barneses tomorrow night.”
like to have a little get-together," she said. "Tony visits all the time but he never talks about anything interesting."
"She probably just wants to make sure she isn't sinking her fortune into a house that's falling apart," Tony said, taking a wild guess.
Tony didn't look but he could see Captain Rogers' head turn out of the corner of his eye. His eyebrows were low and thunderous.
"Last year, James was taken during a raid." She said each word carefully, with crisp enunciation. "The men who took them did worse than kill him as repayment for his actions against their countrymen. When Captain Rogers recovered him, he had lost his arm and much of his memory from before that imprisonment."
Tony couldn't think back on those short, sweet months without his stomach hollowing out. It had been one of the happiest times of his life.
"You've done well for yourself," Tony said. He kept his voice bright and polite. Not a hint of any intimacy. "How
Pepper stuck out her tongue at him. "It's true. You come, you find something to fix, you leave. We've hardly talked about anything
"Lord Stark," he said. He offered his hand and Tony took it, ignoring the man's raised eyebrows. "Adrian Toomes, at your service."
Tony wished he was a little less susceptible to her huge, shining eyes. Sharon was so guileless it was difficult to accuse her of manipulation, but Tony would be surprised if she didn't know how well that expression worked on people she wanted something from.
"Go ahead and find Mrs. Fury and tell her you're in my care," Tony told Lucy. Harley frowned at him, but grabbed his sister's hand and vaulted out of the carriage, carefully skirting around Fury. "She's much nicer than this old bear!" Tony called out after them.
Hours later, Steve drags Tony away from his welding torch. He touches his fingertips to his lips and then covers the back of his wrist with the hand that had touched his mouth.
Steve’s eyes trace over the scar to the right of Tony’s Adam’s apple. He already knows he’s going to be drawing this later.
Steve turns to Baby, who’s sitting on the key table by the door. Baby chirps and sits on his hind legs to rub his face against Steve’s jaw in a goodbye.
Baby chirps and darts back to his hoard. He starts shoving it back under Steve’s bed. He almost doesn’t notice when Steve finishes bundling himself up. Baby sits in the middle of the room, waiting for Steve to say goodbye. But when Steve reaches for the doorknob without saying anything, Baby gives a frantic little chirp.
He continues, “I was in that alleyway for about a week, hissing and growing at anything that moved and it was
Tony knows he hasn’t done his exercises or his warm ups but he needs Steve to know how he feels. Knows he needs to
Steve shrugs a shoulder. “Just… needed somewhere a little less crowded. You don’t mind if I join you for a bit, do you?”
In the time it takes for Steve to get back to the mansion he comes to several conclusions. The biggest being that he’s an idiot. The Avengers is
Steve nods, licking his suddenly dry lips. He spends a moment staring into Stark’s eyes trying to decide how sincere the other man is. He remembers meeting Howard Stark. But, while ‘asshole’ isn’t the word he’d use to describe the man, he can understand how the years could have changed him. In the end, time changes everyone.
Kate’s face softens at the memory. She remembers those days clearly, those days when the work got too much, the people got too selfish, the world got too unforgiving, and the crux of everything that she was doing became lost in a sea of insignificant things and all the other bullshit that came along with the job. She’ll never forget Tony’s words.
He’s all in now, and there’s no turning back. He can’t afford a betrayal, especially not from the most powerful man in the world.
Amidst the laughter that rang around the conference room, Richards threw him a scowl, to which he replied with a wink.
Steve sighs. Of course it will always go back to Maria Hill. “I’ve been trying, but she’s a tough one to crack. She no longer listens to my senior staff. She doesn’t even listen to me, for crying out loud. My options are running out, to be honest.”
Back in Tony’s Georgetown townhouse later that evening, Cassie proudly calls the dinner a success, claims herself the winner of her bet with her godfather, and retires to her room happy and well-fed. Tony, having no energy whatsoever to disagree nor the desire to ruin his good mood, acquiesces to his goddaughter’s pronouncements, kisses her goodnight and goes to bed exhilarated and triumphant.
“You know that’s bullshit, Clint.” She shakes her head and takes another sip of her beer. “Tell me what’s going on with you.”
It’s been a tiring day, and Steve is just about ready to crash onto his bed and sleep until kingdom come. But there’s one thing he promised himself he’d do before he retires to the residence, and out of all the intelligence briefings and diplomatic calls and economic advisory meetings, this last task for the day is perhaps going to be the hardest.
“Between you and me, Obie, who is sitting with the President of the United States and the Speaker of the House tonight?” Rumiko asks him coolly.
Clint shifts, unsure about how to respond. It’s not that he knows where Darcy and Kate are at this point in their relationship, but more that he wants to protect his assistant’s privacy and let her decide what to tell her parents and when. He thinks on it for a moment. “I’ve been in this business for a long time, and I’m not the best person to talk about relationships, believe me,” he tells her in a self-deprecating tone. “But those two? They’re the real deal. If they work hard enough, they’ll make it through the worst of it.”
“Thor?” There’s a gentle hand on his shoulder and he knows it’s his beloved. Jane has been such a force to be reckoned with during the whole campaign that he can’t even begin to imagine not having her around. She would be the perfect First Lady, if she was only given the chance—beautiful, intelligent, eloquent and passionate, among other things—but she will always be his lady love, his rock and comfort. Maybe she won’t be the First Lady and maybe he won’t be the President of the United States, but he knows that he has become a much better man because she was there by his side throughout the whole campaign. For now, that’s more than enough.
She shakes her head. “God, no, don’t do that, Tony. I said yes. I wanted to help. Don’t apologize because none of this is your fault.”
“Really? It’s been a while,” she answers, her tone sad. She pauses, searching Tony’s face for a clue as to where this conversation is headed. Then, gently: “I miss him too.”
When they hang up and Tony is pacified enough to finally be able to sleep, he tucks away the earlier downcast mood brought about by his past relationship with Pepper in a filing cabinet in his mind, along with the moroseness of being and ending up alone. He replaces all this gloom with the electricity of the looming battle, and the thrill of a new friendship.
The ladies exit the conference room first, leaving the boys to gather their things and have a little locker room talk. “I think I’ve figured out why the Republicans hate us so much,” Wade says after having admired Pepper’s and Janet’s gracefulness as they left the Speaker’s office.
Jessica nods. “Which leaves us with more questions: if that’s the case, then which companies? Was the vibranium meant for Oscorp, or somewhere else? And how the hell did Pierce get involved in all of this?”
“Look, Stark may be eccentric and arrogant at best, but you can’t deny that he’s a genius, Pep. I keep telling you, he should just quit politics and put up his own tech company. He’ll give Stane and that Jobs guy a run for their money,” he says passionately as he butters his toast a little too much more than the usual.
Rumiko opens it to find a soft, flesh-colored circular object the size of her little finger’s nail. “What is it?”
“Which reminds me,” Tony signals to Kate, and she hands over three small rectangular boxes. He gives them to Jessica, Matt and Foggy. “These are one-of-a-kind cellphones that I designed and made by hand—highly secure, with their own e-mail, messaging, and call applications, all of which are encrypted. Once you turn them on, JARVIS will guide you through the set-up process. No more communicating through your old phones. If you need to contact any one of us, you use these. Matt, I incorporated a small Braille keyboard in your model for typing and wireless earphones so you have hands-free access to JARVIS.”
“For all that the Republicans say about you…“ he steps closer, their faces less than a foot apart, “…that you’re a philanderer, a drunkard, a selfish bastard, a liar, and a traitor—“
“And Scott would love it, which would make it a hundred times more fun.” They both dissolve into laughter.
Clint and Natasha drive towards what seems to be an empty, rotting warehouse at the end of a dirt road off of Highway 270. It’s the dead of night, and from where they’re sitting, there is no sign of life. Their headlights are turned off, as they were instructed to do so once they had found the dirt road. Everything around them is still as they listen for anything that could give them a clue as to where they’re supposed to be headed next.
Pepper smoothens imaginary creases on her dress and smiles sweetly at Hill. “Just a friendly reminder from your Speaker, Miss Hill.” She turns around and proceeds to walk towards the door.
The Democrats shuffle in the infamous room, laughing and joking around—goddamn them for being so cheerful on a morning like this. Bruce is no longer surprised with the party Stark has brought with him—Congresswoman Pepper Potts, House Majority Leader and his right hand woman; Congresswoman Janet Van Dyne, chairman of the House Budget Committee; Senator Thor Odinson, Senate Minority Leader; and Senator Hank Pym, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He’s a little puzzled at the absence of Barton and Wilson, but he supposes that it must have been for a reason, and he’d bet his life that the both of them were invited to Stark’s pad for one of his infamous planning sessions.
“Boys,” Natasha warns, clearly impatient. She turns back to the issue at hand. “There are still too many unknown variables, but this is a great start. Thank you Clint, Darcy.”
They continue like this in relative silence for a while, only to be broken by the sound of the doorbell ringing. Tony and Cassie turn to each other, surprise on their faces.
“What kind of Thanksgiving would it be if not everyone lent a helping hand, right?” Steve’s tone is excitedly hopeful about the idea.
“Ugh, I’m so tired of this bullshit.” Clint burrows his face in his hands and rubs his closed eyes. “Why can’t these people just do normal crime shit like stealing from poor people or manipulating the market to steal even more from poor people? At least that I can yell about at work.”
“I’m serious! That dynamic that you and Natasha have? I’ve never seen her have that with anyone else.”
"Please," Darcy says with a roll of her eyes. "All your little schemes would fail if it wasn't for my inside information. You need my brains—or rather, my gossip—and if it means getting acquainted with Tony's infamous liquor stash, I'm definitely in."
It's been a year, I know. In my defense, I was in grad school, where I had a million different things going on. But now I'm all done and settled into a new job, I'm trying to be more diligent about this...which is why this update is the longest one I've probably ever written.
Carol sighs, takes out a pen from her bag and grabs a paper napkin from the center of the table. “You’re a menace, Tony Stark.” She slides the napkin towards him surreptitiously. “Don’t leave that lying around.”
“Good.” Natasha pauses to take a bite from her toast and drink from her mimosa. “Don’t worry too much, Pep. You know I won’t let things go out of control. And Tony knows what he’s doing.”
“Did you know that you’ll be accompanying the President to the state dinner for the Italian Prime Minister next week?” Peter asks cautiously.
Tony is in the White House again, and like the meeting last June, his team is with him to make a last ditch effort to pass a budget and keep the government running. While the Democrats know that the opposite happening is a possibility, they don’t know that a shutdown is what Tony actually wants. He’s trying not to think of how Pepper and Natasha will respond to what’s going to happen, and prays that he’ll get to keep his balls after they are done with him.
are all pawns in this chess game, Stark. And to win, we have to outplay the guy who’s trying to make guns with vibranium.”
“You’re happy, though, right?” he asks, in a moment of genuine concern. He loves both ladies but he will always have Kate’s back. Kate, in reply, snorts at him and that is enough for him to know that he’s asked a stupid question. Of course, it’s a stupid question. Kate isn’t the kind of person to be pushed into things. He smiles and shrugs. Kate smiles in return.
“We’ve tried. We’ve tried really hard. She doesn’t want to listen. You know we can’t work this way, Congressman.” Steve sighs. He shouldn’t be talking to him like this. Not after everything they’ve been through. “I don’t want her to take the fall from this with nothing, Bucky.” The use of his first name makes Steve sound softer somewhat.
“All jokes aside,” Natasha glares at Tony, “they're not happy that we had the Pierce case and didn’t tell them.”
Pepper downs the last of her martini and takes a deep breath before turning around to face her mark. “Good evening, Justin. Having a good time?” She extends her arm for a handshake, but he maneuvers it to kiss her cheek instead. She tries not to make her disgust show on her face.
Sam takes his leave, the others following suit. With them gone, Natasha turns on the charm offensive for Killian, determined to extract more information out of him. “What did you do to get on the Secretary of State’s bad side?” she teases.
The atmosphere in the house is festive, though a little sullen because of Thor’s devastating loss. No one will dare to admit that it had been expected—the campaign didn’t spend as much time in Florida as they should have—but it’s still depressing to know that they had the White House at the palm of their hands, only to be taken away from them by a Republican who only managed to win the hearts of America with his blonde locks and charisma. That they lost to him will always make Tony puke a little in his mouth. He hasn’t even started running the country and Tony already hates the guy.
Tony simply shrugs. His promiscuity is probably the worst-kept secret in Washington. “Just trying to lighten the mood. You have grim expressions on your faces.”
“I know that face,” she tells him with a frown. “That face means shit went down with Carol and Rhodey. What happened?”
He had developed a relationship with clothes as he grew older, realizing how much power a well-tailored suit, perfectly tousled hair, and an electric smile had. That’s what had gotten him through his childhood, and that’s what aided his meteoric rise to the Speakership.
“It’s neither youth nor being naïve. I have faith in the goodness of people, especially in those who have sworn to serve this country,” Steve defends. It may be a flimsy argument, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t true.
In Catholic tradition, November is the Month of the Souls in Purgatory—an apt description for the state of Tony’s soul, if there ever was one. It’s a fitting illustration for his physical state, too. His eyes are dark, sunken, and red from the lack of sleep, his hair disheveled. He is unfocused, his mind floating about—the product of spending the whole night tinkering in his workshop instead of getting some much needed rest, like he originally planned in the first place.
“Find a way to get on your State’s department delegation.” He drinks the last of his wine and sets the glass on the table. “Wakanda is the only place we can talk.”
Tony bows his head, not meeting her eyes. “Of course I did. I just thought you wanted to spend it with your mother, is all.”
He can hear her interest pique at the other end of the line. “I'm going to assume you guys aren't dating again, because that ship sailed way back when I was eleven years old.”
Then again, Kate has never seen Natasha so comfortable and so close to anyone else other than Clint. He has a rapport with Natasha that is unique to just the two of them—not even her boss’ relationship with the DNC chair can be compared to what Clint has with her. “She could feel the same way, you know,” Kate suggests after thinking on it for a bit.
“As much as I enjoy catching up,” Tony begins, “I have to admit that this breakfast isn’t entirely a date between friends.”
She reaches out in an effort to console him. “We tried, Tony. We tried for a long time and for the most part, it was fantastic. But when it was bad, we were both absolutely miserable, and our worse days nearly drove our decades-long friendship over the edge. It affected the good work we were doing. We were bound to crash and burn. That is not something I want to go through again.” She pauses, looks away for a moment, thinking. “And I’m in love with Happy.”
“Yes, Kate,” Tony says, exasperated. “I’m going to tell her everything, even that I went behind her back to make an arrangement with a Republican.”
Natasha glides into the State Dining Room with the unrivaled, haughty confidence that she is known—and feared—for. People watch her cautiously as her killer heels tap onto the marble floor, not one of them daring to approach the formidable DNC Chairman so early in the evening’s affair. Which is fine by her, since it gives her time to survey the room and familiarize herself with the lay of the land, taking stock of the attendees that might potentially be useful to them and their cause.
Cassie groans and pulls him back. “No, Uncle Tony! Get in the damn car so we can go and we can finally start cooking. I was taught better than to keep the President of the United States waiting.”
“Now, let’s all just calm down,” Clint says slowly, attempting to bring down the temperature of the situation. “How about you tell us why we’re here, Nick?”
Fury cuts her off. “And if you continue to become a roadblock for the betterment of this country then I swear to whatever god that is you worship that we will paint you and your ragtag team of self-serving assholes as the cause of every single problem in this country.” He stops to recollect himself. “I’m sure Stark and Romanoff will be able to get behind me on this one.”
Steve laughs softly. “Ah, so now I’m starting to see the true colors of the infamous Tony Stark? I’ll take your word for it. Apology accepted.” He takes a moment. “This brand of politics is unmerciful. We didn’t have this kind of ruthlessness when I was in the Senate.”
Kate looks at Tony, his face somber as he hands her a lighter. She walks over to the right end of the room, lights the end of the napkin and throws it into the fireplace. “What’s next, boss?” She asks as she walks back to the desk.
“I thought Thanksgiving was a time for family, Thor,” Loki had said, his words dripping with disdain for his older brother. “Why am I suddenly being turned away by the people who claim to love me?"
“No. Apparently they’re keeping it under wraps at the moment. Wanda gave me information because it’s merely an investigation at this point, so she isn’t violating any confidentiality laws. They’re not sending out subpoenas for actual depositions. Basically, just invitations to talk,” Clint tells them. “Wanda willingly gave us a heads up because she knows Loki is here, and she’s worried.”
“You’re going to have to find a way,” she insists. “Because if someone is trying to figure out how to turn vibranium into a weapon, then we have to be ready with a good offense.”
Kate frowns. “You know, when you say things like that, it’s kind of hard to disagree with you.” She looks up at Tony, who is six inches taller than her. “It’s also very hard to say anything contrary whenever you wear that puppy dog look on your face. Make it go away, it’s disgusting.”
“Not in the slightest.” She shoves a phone into his empty hand. “Here. Natasha called while I was maneuvering through the Istanbul Grand Bazaar—that is, the first floor of your house. She’s been on hold for ten minutes.”
“Realistic? Tony, since when have we—“ Steve rubs his temples, frustration and irritation clear on his face. “Are you trying to punish me for the way I talked to you last night?”
“And with Justin Hammer as a last-minute addition to the guest list?” Pepper repeats, with a note of alarm in her voice. “This doesn’t feel right. All the weapons manufacturers here tonight have been antagonistic towards Tony—and the entire Democratic Party, for that matter—since the Stane-Hammer partnership of 2004. And they’re not huge fans of the President either.”
“That’s…actually not a bad idea.” Tony tilts his head, his interest piqued. He takes a moment to think. “Hypothetically speaking, how much time would you and Darcy need to be able to put together something convincing?”
Thanks for sticking around, and please stay until the end of the ride. Hope you like this one, and please do leave a comment or two! They do help a lot in getting the writing along :)
The household staff had immaculately laid out all their ingredients and cooking utensils in the small kitchen. Cassie reaches out to the racks to distribute aprons to Tony and Steve, and begins to work around the space like it was her own. Tony follows suit, and they begin preparing the ingredients like a well-oiled machine. Steve, being the newcomer, is delegated to vegetable duty, which gives him the opportunity to observe Tony and Cassie in a very intimate, familial sense.
Bruce takes a seat in front of the President. “I personally don’t think it’s the whole story but I have no reason to believe that there is anything malicious about it.” He pauses to try to read the President’s face. “What exactly is bothering you about it, sir?”
He smirks. “When it comes to Wakanda, Miss Romanoff…” He takes a sip from his drink and looks at her with a sly grin. “
“Sir?” someone asks in the middle of all this tension. Tony’s not sure who, because he’s too busy trying not to look so smug.
Clint chuckles, a little embarrassed that Anne had caught on his use of the typical politician tactic of diversion. He shrugs, an abashed smile on his face. “Like assistant, like boss.”
“Goodnight, Uncle Tones. Tell Rumiko I miss her, and tell Steve that I may not have the Secret Service protecting me 24/7, but I’ll find ways to hurt him if he doesn't take care of you.”
When the President gives the floor to the members of the United States Congress to begin the negotiations, the two sides erupt into chaotic debate. It’s no surprise, really, and Tony just wants to sit back and watch everything unfold while eating popcorn. He lets Pepper handle the reins for the most part of the arguing—Tony will intervene when it’s time. He glances at Steve every once in a while, and it’s clear that he’s also waiting for the right opportunity to jump in just like Tony. He’s sneaking glances at Tony, too, trying to determine if the moment is right for the picking.
“It’s not every day that a man and his goddaughter make the perfect Thanksgiving dinner. There must be a story behind that.”
He needs to figure it out because it’s messing with his work (though Tasha doesn’t seem too bothered with this arrangement of work-party-fuck-work repeat). It’s been nine months. Clint knows her favourite perfume. He knows that she only ever sleeps on the right side of the bed. She doesn’t like flowers, hates chocolates except for the champagne-flavoured Royce chocolates that she buys for herself whenever she makes a trip to Japan, and absolutely refuses to invest in a house for herself because she likes the feeling of being transient, of not being held down by mortgage or an actual suburban home.
It’s Stane that actually seeks out Rumiko—he corners her as she’s walking from the bar back to the general vicinity of her table, where both Tony and the President are chatting animatedly with some ambassadors from the diplomatic corps. She almost throws her drink at him when they come face to face, but she holds back. This is not the time to be petty.
“Of course it’s personal, Tony,” Pepper says quietly, sighing in frustration. “I’ve known you since you were a lost teenager in Stanford. Being your partner for a while also helped in the
“I never slept,” he tells her. “I don’t think I’ve had a good night’s rest since the meeting at the White House.”
Dugan clears his throat. “Sir, we’re five minutes out,” he informs Tony, and Tony peers through his window to see that they are already within Capitol grounds. Like 60% of the time, he is not looking forward to another day of being the Speaker of the House.
She shrugs, grinning. “Because it’s fun, and someone has to keep you on your toes somehow.” Sharon then turns solemn. “I want to meet him, okay? That’s all I ask.”
Natasha throws her hands up, disbelief clear on her face. “On what planet, Fury? We agreed to trust each other and then suddenly I’m supposed to put every bit of gossip I hear on a silver platter and hand it to you? Please.”
Phil agrees. “Bruce is right. It’s good for us publicity-wise, reaching out across party lines in order to attain an amicable agreement. Not to mention it will assuage whatever doubts the Republican Party has with this administration.”
Natasha lifts her flute up to him as thanks. He nods curtly and takes his leave, leaving the two women alone once again.
Tony will emphatically deny that at that moment, he found Steve Rogers and his jacket-removal and sleeve-roll motions attractive. No, he’s not even going to go there.
“Ah, this is where it gets interesting,” Foggy says, his tone going a notch more excited. “Richard Parker is a scientist who worked for Oscorp for around ten years before finally retiring from the research industry in 2010. He approached Matt and me around the same time that Hell’s Kitchen was blowing up, because Oscorp had requested him to come back for a short contract to experiment on some new material they had come across.”
However, there is no time to dwell on that—there is still much work to be done. The deadline is in eight days, and there are still many things to be ironed out if this plan of Tony’s is going to work. He looks around the Oval Office and tries to take it all in. Everything that’s happening is intense and fast-paced, but he has to admit that it’s kind of exciting. Who knew that adding a little bit of crazy (thanks to Tony) could make things fun?
Rumiko makes a noise of dissent. “Please. This is the most fun I’ve had in months. Besides, I’m enjoying watching Tony making a fool of himself in front of the President.”
“And I’m not at all happy with him,” she tells Fury with a sneer. “What does he take me for, a wimp? You know the Republicans in the House are out to get blood. Do you honestly think we’d allow that poor excuse of a budget to pass in my chamber?”
It was hard. It was hard for Clint when he had distanced himself from his family and slowly cut ties with the people who had barely raised him. It was hard for Kate when her family had disowned her and left her to fend for herself. It was harder than anything that they had ever done in their entire lives. But watching her like this—happy, at home, and welcomed unconditionally by people not of her blood—cemented the fact that everything they had been through to get to this very moment had been worth it.
“Yes, sir!” she says with a salute, and Tony rolls his eyes again, although with more affection than he would dare to confess. Kate has always loved the late-night planning and the head-to-head sessions in the House, and Tony would never, ever admit to anyone that indulging Kate’s war freak side is a more compelling reason to allow her in these meetings than the fact that he can’t find shit when she isn’t around.
That throws Steve off for a good second, but then he regains himself. No matter how familiar they get with one another, Tony Stark will always be Tony Stark. He will always be thinking of appearances. “Of course. Shall we?”
Pepper’s face lights up. “Is it weird that I’m really excited?” Tony relaxes. Emotional crisis averted for now.
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
Darcy nods in agreement and sets down her empty mug on the sink. “I’ll go take a shower. Can I borrow some clothes?”
So yes, he is a little intimidated, but he’s Tony Stark. He’ll die before he ever admits to anyone that he gets intimidated. He’ll also die before he ever admits to anyone that he took special care getting ready for this meeting. Even JARVIS was mocking him without being too obvious about it. Tony didn’t even berate his AI for it, to his surprise. He blames all of this being out of character on the current circumstances, since a federal shutdown is
“She can handle him,” Tony interjects, shocking everyone listening in. “She can handle him better than anyone else on this team.”
Tony sinks into Steve’s touch immediately, releasing much of the tension that was holding his body hostage. “Mmm,” he mutters, his eyes closed. “That feels really good.”
There is a momentary pause, just a few seconds of a suspended crackling in the air when both men size each other up. They’ve seen each other on monitors, on CNN specials and footage from the newsrooms, but it’s something else to see them standing in front of each other, with Steve towering the all-important one inch over Tony.
His phone rings again, ‘Tony Stark’ coming up on his caller-ID, but he ends the call when he settles in the driver’s seat of his Prius.
“Darcy, what the hell are you doing?” Clint asks his assistant after it registers to him what is going on.
Jane shakes her head. “You don’t understand. Loki hates DC because he thinks it’s Thor’s playground. Thor has power here, and Loki doesn’t like that. He doesn’t like coming in second, which is why he chooses to stay in Ohio where he’s chief judge of the north district.”
“I know who you are,” Tony says a little impatiently. He then realizes he’s talking to the leader of the free world and calms himself down, takes a deep breath.
“Well, it’s fairly obvious that Hill’s behind the wheel on this one, regardless of the fact that the budget was written by the White House.” Pepper stops to think for a moment. “Come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve even
The White House Chief of Staff comes in right after the Republicans do, and just like the previous meeting, he tries to make peace with everyone. Tony has always liked Bruce, respects him a lot too, so he listens to him when Bruce tells everyone to settle down. Kind of. He doesn’t stop giving Maria Hill smug smiles when they’ve all sat down and are just waiting for the President to arrive, and Pepper gives up on telling Tony to behave himself. Some things will just never change.
Thor crosses his arms. “Greed makes monsters of men, Kate. I would not be surprised if he traded his daughter’s dignity for company profit. If I may also venture a guess: Osborn threatened not only to pull his business from AIM, but to convince other companies to take their business somewhere else if Wilson Allan didn’t acquiesce.”
“Has anyone tried calling the guy?” Wade asks the group as he opens another can of beer, his fourth for the night. His leans back on the couch, completely at home. “He’s your brother, Thor. Perhaps showing a little bit of fraternal love will do the trick.”
Tony to come to the White House like a good, obedient foot soldier—didn’t sit well with him, and the cold sensation of regret washed over him immediately after he had hung up.
"I know what they're saying," Tony said. "That's why I want to find out about them. They shouldn't get away with thinking this town is their personal bank."
He offered the stack to Tony. Tony reached out but before he could take it, Yinsen trapped his hands.
After dinner - thankfully he'd passed inspection and was allowed at the table, even if listening to Sharon and Peggy giggle about her walk was nigh on unbearable - Tony tried to go back to his room and work some more. It turned out to be impossible. An itch began under his skin, uncertainty turning into restless energy that he couldn't dispel no matter what he tried to distract himself with.
Pepper had refrained from drinking - something about wanting to keep her head clear just in case - but Rhodey nodded seriously, leaning against Tony to try and keep from sliding down onto the floor entirely. Pepper laughed at them.
Toomes foreboding look deepened. "Four bags of apples, three loaves of bread, a pound of ham, and a newly baked blueberry pie."
"You have to know—" Captain Rogers voice was low and pained. He cleared his throat. "I've always cared about you."
Tony's chest tightened. His body felt too small or the room felt too large. He needed to get out of there, recover himself.
"On your head, then," Fury said, clearly wiping his hands of the matter. "If you're going down to visit Mrs. Killian this afternoon, take your little hellions with you. I don't want them underfoot."
They'd probably be more shocked about where he was going. It had been a long time since he'd visited the county cemetery, but he still remembered the way. It was barely ten minutes from town in a wide, green space protected on one side by the forest and the other by a low stone wall. Tony parked outside of the gates and carefully climbed out of the carriage, ignoring the throb in his still tender ankle.
thank you for the kind response! it's been fun to see reactions to this fic & that keeps me chugging along.
"Those are the Keener children," Fury said. "What mischief have you been working down in town, Stark? Cooper would only say that you'd been called away."
"We'll have to have another dinner with them again so you can tell her yourself, Lord Stark!" Sharon said brightly. "I wouldn't mind at all - it really was the most
Pepper crossed her arms over her chest. Her face was approaching red now, a sure sign of temper. Tony would be warier if he wasn’t utterly distracted by her
"I'm glad to hear you say so!" Peggy sounded shy too. "More than one man has been put off by my strong opinions."
"No can do." The words came out in a rush, one on top of the other. Peggy blinked, obviously surprised, but Captain Rogers didn't so much as twitch at the outburst. His face was stoic once more, not even the minute signs of surprise Tony had noticed there anymore. Who had taught him to have such a poker face? "I haven't been home in some time either; I'm afraid I wouldn't be much use as a guide. Besides, I do believe if I don't make use of the nearest bathtub, your aunt won't let me sit at the dinner table. I'll be out eating with the dogs instead."
Tony's heart rate picked up. "Did she?" he asked, keeping his voice light. "Did you tell her how handsome I am? Maybe she's getting tired of Barnes already."
He didn't want to voice the sleepless nights he'd spent wondering if Captain Rogers' affections were actually solid enough to withstand all of these hardships. Would he want Tony if he was cut off from his family name, his fortune, his future? He hated thinking it, hated doubting one of the few people who had supported him for so long, but it didn't stop the insidious thoughts from lurking. He doubted himself too; surviving on love was all well and good in novels, but it was hardly as romantic in real life. He could make his funds through his inventions, maybe, but how was he going to get anyone to actually take a second look at them without the weight of his name to throw behind his eccentricity? And would he survive the long, lonely months without Captain Rogers when he was off at sea?
Goose was much calmer now that he was away from any scurrying animals and whickered softly as Mrs. Barnes patted his side.
Yinsen firmly told Tony he had no place hovering while Yinsen worked and shut the door in his face before Tony could even check on Pepper. Tony managed to distract himself with indignation for a full twenty minutes and then he spent another ten pacing. Thoroughly fed up with the anxious cycle of his own thoughts, he turned his attention to Pepper’s living room. It only took the work of two minutes to find a grandfather clock shoved in the corner, quiet and broken—Pepper had begun to dismantle it, but had yet to finish. Tony knew nothing about clocks, but how hard could it be? And, at the very least, it would keep his mind off of how bloody long Yinsen had been sequestered in that bedroom with Pepper.
Yinsen blinked. "I—" He tilted his head, considering Tony with new interest. "I wrote to your father several months ago, asking for him to provide some extra protection around town. Would you like to see the letter he sent me?"
“None to speak of,” Pepper said. “His parents are long dead and he has no siblings or cousins. Not that they would have helped me if he did. Things were not—well between us, those last few months. Finding out I was pregnant after his last visit was something of a mixed blessing.”
this one took a while mostly bc work has been kicking my ass this month and i've been trying to tie up a few other projects (notably my mth fills which have taken FOREVER to get off the ground and may finally be publishable some time soon). also had to do a few rewrites to shake loose how i wanted this chapter to go.
"He was too damn small to start so many fights," Rhodey said against Tony's neck. "But he's not small now, Tones. He hurt you."
He was a young man, not even 18 if Tony had to guess, with dark hair and rough, worn clothes. He straightened to attention when he saw Tony like he was facing an admiral. Tony bit down on a smile.
Before he could duck away, Peggy saw him. She smiled, giving him a little wave, and Captain Rogers turned to see who she was greeting. Tony had a brief moment to take in the warm smile he was in the process of offering before he realized who exactly it was he smiling at; the expression froze on his face. Tony bit the inside of his cheek.
"Proposing!" Tony shook his head. "Pepper spends her days scolding me for sorting the vegetables wrong and threatening me with those weapons she calls knitting needles and people think I'm
It had been something just for them. While the others would join in from time to time, it had mostly been just Captain Rogers and Tony, together because they'd liked each other best. The thought was tender as a bruise. Tony flinched away from it.
Captain Rogers had remained out in the garden for almost the entire time Tony had been in the house. He'd only come inside when they were all preparing to go and saying their goodbyes. No one else had seemed to notice except Barnes and, to Tony's surprise, Wilson, who had given the Captain a keen look and drawn him aside for a hushed conversation before they all left. Tony burned with curiosity to know what was said, but he'd learned his lesson for the day about eavesdropping on talk not meant for his ears.
Pepper considered it. "I won't be able to stay up very late," she warned. "Actually, I might just fall asleep in the middle of everything."
It’s all very thrilling to Tony, even with the danger of him losing important body parts to the two most terrifying women he’s ever known.
“It is, but that’s not all there is to it.” Tony sighs. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t tell you over the phone. I hope you’re not upset,” he tells her carefully, his apology genuine.
Jessica Drew’s press conference had caught everyone in the White House off guard. The DOJ had been deathly quiet about this case—no whisper of it anywhere near the West Wing—and he had called his Attorney General in immediately after the last question was answered. Carol strode in his office about twenty minutes later, proudly defiant. They had hammered down and solved their issues, of course, but not after they had spent almost half an hour in a screaming match.
He asks JARVIS to switch off the lights in his workshop as he goes up the stairs back to his living room. It’s late, but tomorrow’s a big day. There is much more work to be done.
“You misunderstand me. This whole crisis is no longer about exchanging goods and services, Nick. You know what’s on the line here.” She stands up and puts her sunglasses back on. “You need to tell your boy to trust Stark. And maybe you should tell yourself that as well.” She tosses a ten-dollar bill on the table and leaves without another word.
“We haven’t met,” interjects a portly man with blonde hair hovering behind the guys. He extends a hand towards Jessica. “Foggy Nelson.”
"Sharon did say you were all friends as children," Miss Wilson said, looking between them. "I hardly believed it before now."
"I would as well," Tony agreed. He saw Harley's eyes widen out of the corner of his eye, but he didn't turn to look at him. Toomes blinked and Tony gave him a smile with too many teeth exposed to be friendly. "Hunger makes people do desperate things, you know? If we just let him go, he'll steal again. He won't have another choice."
Steve nods to himself. Chewing at his bottom lip, he spares another glance at Tony’s retreating back. He wants to go over and offer Tony some sort of comfort, but he gets the feeling that imposing anymore of his presence on the younger genius would be unwanted.  Instead, he heads to what has become his usual corner in the lab and grabs at the sketchbook he leaves wedged on a nearby shelf.
Steve doesn’t know exactly what Tony means by that, but he can guess that either Ironman mentioned their conversation to Tony or that maybe Tony had even requested his bodyguard ask Steve about his increasing presence in the lab.
Tony laughs, a deep gravely noise, like boulders shifting, and signs to J.A.R.V.I.S. to help teach Steve.
work on tech for the Avengers. If he hadn’t’ve seen Stark roaming the halls in search of coffee for himself, he’d think Stark never came up from the lab at all.
Steve pulls Tony into his arms and buries his face against the uninjured side of Tony’s neck. “I love you so goddamn much, Tony. I’m not going to ask you to stop being Ironman; no one else could even compare. I just need you to make sure you come home to me in one piece, okay?”
It is, unfortunately, radio silence from Ironman, which is highly unusual. Half the team is worried about him and the other half is trying to get his attention and Tony is too busy defeating the bad guy to sign to J.A.R.V.I.S. to activate an alternate communication system.
Tony laughs. “You’re such a little shit. Like, you have no idea. It was so much fun watching you and Bucks go at it.”
It’s a silent walk to Tony’s room and when they arrive at the door Pepper gestures at him to go through.
Steve shifts, uncomfortable. His words are… well, in the various categories that Words can be sorted into, his are considered Strange. Words that don’t quite fit into any other category since they’re not obviously a Greeting, a Prompt, a Response, or a Request. At best, the frantic confession could be considered a Response, but even then, they don’t give the impression of a proper Response. They’re not answering a question or returning a greeting. They’re part of the dreaded fifth category, Strange, only surpassed in despair by the sixth category.
Tony hums like sandpaper scratching and wags a finger at Steve before flashing through another series of signs.
Steve’s heart twists in his chest in the best way. He reaches up and fumbles for the zipper on his jacket and the buckles off his harness. Pulling his harness off, Steve says, “You didn’t need to do that for me.”
“I’m fine, Baby, I—” but Steve is coughing wetly into the blanket Bucky draped over him and Baby gives a worried little trill.
“Alright, alright, cool your jets. It’s just a bedroom.” But as soon as Steve opens the door the dragon’s already slithered in and is exploring every corner. He’s a little red blur, going from under Steve’s bed to on top of it to his drafting desk to his chest of drawers to
Steve’s halfway out the door when he stops and looks over his should, a dark blush across his cheeks. “You… you aren’t one of those dragons that can turn into a person, are you?”
“Then you should change back,” Steve says. “You should change into your human form so you can heal and then we can all go out for drinks or something. Just…” Steve feels like he can’t breathe. “Don’t die.”
Some hours later, Steve sets down his sketchbook and makes his way to where Tony’s welding some mystery component of Ironman’s suit.
THERE—SIT, Tony signs, pointing to one of his wheeled stools. He grabs another seat and sits himself down next to Steve. His grin is almost blinding as he starts to share a handful of his favorite signs.
Tony never should have become Ironman in the first place. How could he even try to redeem himself? How could he think that being a hero changed anything he’d done? All the wrongs he’s committed? The people his weapons have killed? How did Tony ever even
After a moment’s hesitation, Stark gestures to the small corner of his workshop that Steve’s heard referred to as ‘The Crash Zone’ simply because, as Pepper has said, Stark uses it ‘to crash out’ and take naps between bouts of working on the Avengers’ gear.
Baby darts out and grabs the glasses from Steve’s pocket. The dragon gently places them on top of the pile he’s made. Then, he carefully crawls to the top, drapes his winds over the pile, and gives a happy little chirp.
Loki nods. “Dragon form takes more magic than human form. He needs to recoup his magic as fast as possible to fight the last of the dark spell. Once his magic is fully restored, he should be completely better. And back to his full size in his dragon form, too.”
Steve whines and buries his face in his pillow. “Bucky, you have to go. The center! They’ll be short staffed if you don’t.”
Clint shrugs. “It’s fucked up, but I’m used to it. The whole soulmate shit is fucked up anyway. It basically just shits on the whole Deaf/Hard of Hearing and mute communities. You only get a soulmark if you can hear your soulmate’s voice with your own ears or if they have a voice to speak it to you? That’s fucked up. How are we supposed to find our soulmates? How are we supposed to know? Hell, with me being deaf and Tony here being mute, we could be a Matched Pair and never know it.”
He tries to convince himself that it’s understandable he didn’t put the obvious together because, well, Ironman talks. But that’s not any excuse because Tony built his own fully functioning AI at twenty-five. How could he have not built some other AI to speak for him while he’s in the Ironman suit?
‘As you can see, the same signs for a word are used regardless of sentence tense. It is for this reason that the ‘Time’ must go at the beginning of the sentence.
The dragon moves, butting its head against Steve’s chest and makes a purring noise deep in its chest.
Steve continues, “It’s not pity, Tony. I don’t pity you. I—I genuinely enjoy your company. You’re smart and funny and probably the most compassionate person I’ve ever met. I had hoped that you were at least considering me a friend but… but if I’m infringing on your space down here, I can leave. Just say the word. It’s just…” Steve sighs, “Most days, it seems like the lab is the only place in the whole mansion where I can find some peace and just be myself. Without any expectations of being Captain America, too.”
Baby chirps happily and then slips back into the darkness. Steve can hear clanking and he has to dart away to avoid being hit by: five spoons, a wrench, Bucky’s crescent set, a screwdriver, two calculators, all four of the missing remotes, a ladle, a tire iron, two pairs of scissors, a hole punch, a shiny little bookmark Sam gave Bucky for his birthday, their teaspoon/tablespoon set, seven of Bucky’s black hair ties, the house phone, a can opener, their missing cheese grater,
It’s a week later and Steve walks out of his work to see a smartly dressed red-headed woman waiting for him by a sleek black car. He tries not to groan, expecting her to be another detective or reporter here to question him. He did have Tony Stark in his apartment for a month without telling anyone while the guy was MIA.
“Mr. Stane?” Bucky paused and seemed to think for a long moment. “I can see that. He’s… unsettling. I’ve only met him once or twice at the Stark Vet C.P. Clinic.”
Steve is… obsessed. And he really wishes there was a better word to describe his feelings about his predicament than that. Or, at least, one with fewer negative connotations.
Steve tosses his phone on the coffee table and when he looks up Baby’s staring at him, head tilted to the side.
“Steve,” she says, gently, one hand still outstretched from where she’d touched Steve’s knee. “Steve, it’s okay. This is another one of those things that’s changed since you went into the ice. I apologize. I wasn’t thinking and I shouldn't have teased you like that. Homosexuality is accepted nowadays.”
Steve winces and can’t stop his hands this time. They come up, fingertips grazing along Tony’s jaw. He doesn’t cup Tony’s face so much as his hands hover just above his skin, feeling the disproportionate warmth from the side that took the brunt of the arrow impact.
And after, Tony can’t find the right signs to refuse when Steve asks him to dinner later. So he just nods and knocks his knuckles into Steve’s bare chest.
Tony sits, face scrunching for a moment before he starts counting on his fingers. He shows Clint what looks like an ‘OK’ sign.
In the end, Steve sighs, exhausted and deflated. He says, quietly, “I care about you so damn much. I love you, you know that, right? You worried me today. It was the worst fucking feeling in the world.”
Steve and Ironman are already great friends so it boggles Tony’s mind that Steve would want to be friends with
Half furious, Steve says, “If I ever find the person who told you that the sounds you make aren’t the most beautiful noises in the world, I’m going to punch them in the face.”
Steve’s signing can be a bit formal so Tony thinks maybe it’s Pepper. But occasionally he’ll throw in the initialized form of a sign so maybe it’s Clint, whose signs ASL to Tony, Signed Exact English to people who piss him off, and, once, Japanese Sign Language to Rumiko.
“Hi! Uhm, my name’s Steve. My dragon, he’s really sick and I don’t know what to do. I saw your page online and I’ve been trying to lower his temperature but he just keeps getting hotter and I’m getting really worried. Do you make house calls or is there somewhere can take him or schedule an appointment or something? I’m—he’s just… he’s only… tiny.”
It’s cold and wet and Steve is drenched in seconds. “This is terrible,” he mutters. But he soldiers on because he has to get home somehow and he doesn’t have the money for a cab.
small. Red Imperials can grow up to fifty feet tall, Bucks.” Steve looks over at the dragon curled up on three of Steve’s old sweaters. “What happened to you, Baby? Why are you so small?”
“Oh,” Natasha says. Nodding, she pulls away from where she’s lounging against Clint. She rests her elbows in her knees and leans into Steve’s space. “What’s
“Okay,” Steve breathes, “the internet says dragons naturally run hot—blah, blah, blah, I knew that—but when they run especially hot it can only mean a few things; illness, pregnancy, or magical interference. If it is preg—go down in a few da—illness or magical interference try to lower the temp—lukewarm rag across the back, not cold—could be a sock to the system and cause further complications. If it doesn’t get better in twenty-four hours—most likely magical—call specialist. Seven-one-eight—”
. So the left half of the faceplate is completely blown away, ruining his lip reading tech and sending shards of glass and metal into Tony’s face.
But Tony isn’t lucky to be alive. His mother is dead. His father is dead. And Tony, at twenty-one, cannot speak.
“Oh,” Steve says as he starts tapping his pencil against the tabletop. “The—um... the only woman I’ve ever been even a little attracted to was Peggy Carter.”
Steve laughs as well. “I’m gonna change and then I’ll be back out. I’m glad you’re feeling better, Bucky.”
, Steve realizes, shocked. It’s either that or Tony still feels awkward about Steve insisting that every time they have sex they’re making love and not just fucking. (‘There’s no love in fucking,’ Steve had said, ‘and what I feel for you is far more than a simple fuck.’)
He starts at the library in the mansion, checking to see if there are any ASL books kept on those shelves. Disappointingly, there aren’t many. The Stark Library seems to be mostly engineering books, novels, and other various reference material.
turn back, he feels so weak. He says the spell kept him from changing forms. But the spell itself is broken. Its aftereffects, though, are still poisoning him.”
Steve aches, the familiarity of it just like every time Baby—Tony’s little dragon form—would butt his head against Steve’s cheek.
But Baby has already launched himself off the couch and is scrambling down the hallway. The two men watch as the dragon disappears into Steve’s room and then, seconds later, come tearing back with Steve’s phone clutched in his little claws over his head.
“Thank you.” Steve leans down and gives Baby a kiss to the top of his head. “I have to get to work; be good for Bucky, okay? He’s wearing his dog tags today and that’s not really a good sign.”
Tony glanced over his shoulder at the line of waiting servants. “Later,” he said. “For now, introduce me.”
Peggy said nothing in response. Tony wasn't surprised - he wouldn't have been able to summon words under the strength of Captain Rogers' warm regard either. His throat tightened a little. Not that he would ever have such a thing turned on him again. No, he was fickle and infirm, easily persuaded by others. Not to be trusted.
? Nearly six years, all told before this thing—" he tapped his bad leg with his cane "—took me out of service and into Intelligence. He was promoted not long after."
Tony's father could go rot as far as he was concerned, though he doubted anyone at the table would want to hear that. He'd learned to keep any harsher feelings about his father carefully concealed, even among those he might consider friends; more than one person had tried to convince him that he should pay the old man proper respect and follow his words like orders.
Clint, overwhelmed by her honest approbation, doesn’t quite know how to answer that. He’s not used to sincere candor. It’s unforgiving, this world of his—cutthroat, vindictive, even merciless—but extremely fulfilling when met with the sort of authentic approval given by the likes of Anne Lewis.
There's a pause. “Darling, you know there can only be one reason why Loki’s here,” Jane says to Thor softly, stroking his arm to comfort him.
“Do you really?” Tony challenges. He knows that he’s testing the limits of the white flag that Steve is metaphorically waving in front of him, but he’s tired of all the fun and games. And if this is one of Steve’s tactics to get him to talk, well, as they say—fool him once and all that.
Wade laughs. “Close, but no. I think it’s because we’ve got the sexiest and most gorgeous women in our party, and they only have Maria Hill.”
Bruce takes a moment to fully grasp the President’s admission. “You’re right that it’s not something that’s done here. Everything is quid pro quo and nothing is for free in this line of work. But you’re the President, sir. You can do whatever you want. And frankly, I find it honorable that you were willing to work with Tony Stark on such authentic terms.”
"Captain Rogers," Peggy said. Tony's stomach dropped at her blush. "He says if he has to marry us off, he's going to make sure it's to him."
Peggy's confused expression cleared as she laughed. "You guess right, sir!" She surveyed him. "But why
Tony forced himself to wave a casual hand. "It's not like I keep a list of everyone I courted. It was six years ago. Who can remember back that far?"
“No, no, I wouldn't want to step on their toes. They should feel that the manor is their home, not that they're the interlopers. Besides, I have business with my father in London.”
"I suppose you'd better come with us," Bella said. "Lord, child, how do you do these things to yourself? We'll have to send for Dr. Yinsen to look at that ankle."
When Yinsen had closed the door, Pepper whapped Tony on the arm. He yelped, giving her a betrayed look.
Harley's sister Lucy was pale and thin and she watched Tony with deep suspicion as he loaded her into the carriage he'd sent for from Shield Hall. Their mother was also wary, though something in her expression relaxed when Tony promised regular visits and that her children would rejoin her as soon as she had recovered. Tony was no doctor, but he was betting something like pneumonia had kept her in bed; she was just as pale as her children and spoke through a great, hacking cough during their entire conversation.
Tony thought it over. The mere thought of leaving Pepper on her own, with no one around who really cared about her to check on her was enough to make anxiety spiral up and down his body, tightening his stomach and making his chest flutter. Jarvis could check in on her, of course, but with a new tenant, Jarvis was going to be uncommonly busy for the foreseeable future. He would hardly have the time to come by regularly to make sure Pepper hadn’t collapsed again.
Captain Rogers turned his head. Tony could just see his profile; the sharp nose and curled mouth and sloping brow.
"Yes, I suppose I do." Sousa opened his mouth, closed it again. Tony waited as he gathered himself enough to say, "I do have a question for you, actually. I didn't want to ask the other day with everyone around listening in." Tony's heart dropped to his toes. "Did you really build an engine when you were ten?"
"Then I do hope Lord Stark can join us the next time we come," Peggy said. Tony froze again. "There are some lovely maps in his library that I thought he could explain to me. Though I hope the poor man doesn't fall victim to another incident!" She laughed a little. "That's twice this week already!"
Jarvis had never been particularly demonstrative, always solemn and reserved, but Tony could see the warmth in his eyes and the small crease to his lips that was his particular form of a smile. Tony smiled back, some of the tension leaving his back. Stark Manor had so many unpleasant memories that he’d almost forgotten that it had good ones, too.
. That the universe works in such a way that all of these concepts can come together and actually mean something - and mean something pretty complex, when it comes down to it -
“Now, now, there’s no need for such filthy language,” Tony said, adopting the prim, proper voice he’d heard one of his many governesses use. “In front of a peer of the realm, too! What would your wife think, Sir Fury?”
Tony woke late the next morning; it had taken him such a long time to fall asleep last night that fingers of sunlight had already been approaching his window by the time his eyes had closed. Groggy, it took him much longer than usual to dress and find his way to the dining room; everyone was already halfway through their breakfast.
"Betrayed by my own friends," Sousa said with mock outrage that made them just laugh at him. He turned back to Tony. "I'll take your challenge, Lord Stark. Now it's apparently a matter of protecting my honor."
Jarvis’s sigh was deep and long-suffering. Tony was surprised at how nostalgic it made him feel. “I find that university has not given you any respect for propriety, Master Stark.”
"Your eyes are getting too big for your stomach," Fury said. Tony couldn't look at him and couldn't decipher his tone. "He hasn't proposed yet."
to. It's not like I asked for your wife to wander into the woods and force me to accept a ride back. I would've been fine. I mean, I'd probably still be limping back, but I would've made it. Probably."
"Hold on, I want to see this mysterious equation!" That was Sharon, down at the other end of the table. "Show the table, Mr. Sousa!"
Tony rolled his eyes and made a face. Peggy giggled and Sousa smiled but the pinched expression on Captain Rogers' face deepened.
"No," he said and though he was making a play at derisiveness, his tone was fond. "He's never really been that good at keeping secrets."
"Peggy asked if you really had been friends as children. When he confirmed you had, she wondered what his thoughts were of you now after such a long separation." Bella eyed him. "He said that you were so altered that he might not have even known you."
Barnes had been the only one of them who hadn't cried when he'd broken a bone as a child. Captain Rogers had sniffled and Tony, he wasn't ashamed to say, had bawled like a baby. He'd been the biggest of them aside from Rhodey, the one who would step in when Captain Rogers started a fight with a bully or Tony ran his mouth at the town kids. Tony had more than one memory of relief at hearing Barnes' low drawl in the middle of a sticky situation.
He held her wet eyes without blinking. Her mouth narrowed, jaw clenching, but eventually she nodded with one sharp jerk of her chin.
For a moment, Tony didn't think Rhodey was going to take the Captain's hand. When he did reach out, his grip was noticeably tight. Captain Rogers' eyes narrowed but he clenched back just as much until their handshake was more some kind of weird contest. Tony frowned. They released each other and Tony thought he saw Captain Rogers flex his fingers before he tucked his hand behind his back.
Tony crossed his arms, watching Peggy tug Sousa with her down the forest path. "I feel like I should be offended," he said. "But honestly, I almost feel sorry for Sousa."
handsome and so rich now after his spoils during the war!" Sharon waved her hands. "He's the most eligible bachelor in the area!"
Yinsen smiled. "I think my faith will be rewarded, Lord Stark." He pushed the book in Tony's direction. "Please."
Tony blinked at her. He had only met Pepper’s husband once, just after his mother’s funeral. He was a local man, a bit of a dreamer, with an eye toward enterprise that his frail body couldn’t match. Tony hadn’t liked him, though it had little to do with his designs on Pepper—he’d had a conniving, greedy attitude that had made Tony’s hackles raise. He hadn’t been happy when Rhodey had reported Pepper’s courtship and eventual marriage, but considering their falling out, Tony hadn’t felt he had the right to intervene. The last he’d heard was that they had moved into Pepper’s father’s cottage and Killian had been recruited into the army.
