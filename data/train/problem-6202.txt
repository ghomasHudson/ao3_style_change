His hand fell away, and he turned.
This work is also bittersweet in that it is probably the last work I'll be posting in this fandom.  My Swan Song.  Thank you again for sticking with me through this journey.
Steve surged forward, his lips crashing into Tony’s like a storm. He was a drowning man, and Tony was air.  Steve wasn’t strong enough to keep suffocating.
Steve was 22 again, camping in the Baghdad rubble.  His rifle was heavy across his chest and his back was scraping against a rough wall thick with powdered grey dust.  The strap of his helmet swung against his chin, pulled low over his eyes as he tried to get some sleep but daydreamed instead of everything that waited for him on another continent.
“Steve,” Tony's voice was hoarse, and maybe it was the fact that he was half-awake himself but he sounded raw and real and concerned, the impassive facade finally slipping.  “What’s wrong?”
He took the strong stuff in the mornings, powering through on the lowest possible dose to try to keep his wits about him. By evening he was hurting too badly to ignore, but his only option besides the meds was alcohol. Back in time, back
Instead he stood, breathing, a transplant in an unfamiliar world, while the natural order stared up at him from uncut grass and faded stone.
When the world stopped spinning around him—or at least, slowed down—he found himself staring up with blurred vision into the midnight sky of New York.
When he came awake in a dusty hospital in Mosul, covered in the blood of his fellow soldiers, that word had come tearing out of his scorched lungs without permission. He had screamed for his ex-lover until four medics wrestled him back down onto the cot, their fingers digging into shrapnel wounds and the shredded remains of his right leg.
Everything was about to change.
“You’re working with kids now, Steve. You always wanted to do that. You still drink crappy beer and you still go out of your way not to hurt me, even if it means hurting yourself in the process.”
“I missed you, Tony,” Steve finally said as he looked at him, his voice hollow and tired, “but I was never going to call you.”
The punch was predictable, too. Steve rolled with it, and gave up trying to be the restrained, diplomatic one.
Most people remembered their dreams. They discussed them fondly and skeptically and traded laughter with one another over misplaced imagery and seemingly-random memories. They were sad, they were funny, they were sweet.
“I fell so hard for you kid. I was in deep,” the words came without warning, like it was the simplest thing in the world. “If it’s that hard for you to see, I still am.”

The elevator doors made a soft sound of compressed air as they closed behind him and the metal contraption dropped away, taking with it the steadfast presence that might have been all that was holding the soldier together. The absence left him feeling strangely cold, that old bone-gnawing chill creeping back into his limbs as a physical reminder of his weakness.
The soldier hated how difficult such a simple task had become.  More than that, he hated that he was so used to it.
Tony didn’t give him the time to lose himself in his head again.  Without warning his lips were back, devouring his mouth. Saying so much without words. Steve groaned into him, losing himself.  If he’d had any doubts that Tony meant every word he said, the billionaire took them from him. From his lips, from his lungs, from his tired and aching heart.  Tony kissed him like a man who wanted nothing more in the world than what was right in front of him.
Tony didn't know that Steve still came here. He probably wouldn't say much about it, especially considering the regular trips the pair still made to Phil Coulson's memorial site, but the soldier knew Tony didn't like it when Steve got too caught up in the past. Said it was unhealthy, and Steve secretly had to agree with him... but some things were harder to let go of than others.
"I know."
"It's not your fault Tony," Steve finally managed to choke out, overwhelmed by what he was hearing, what he'd never dreamed the other man had done for him, "It was a warzone. They couldn't even get my transport out for six months..."
Steve's duffel sat, packed and waiting by the door for almost six months.
Due entirely to his own inattention, the butt of his right crutch slipped on the linoleum. Steve stumbled. He cursed his own clumsiness as his crutch clattered to the floor.  The soldier barely managed to do an awkward half-step and catch himself on the bathroom sink, avoiding another fall by a hair.
"Sorry—" the soldier began dumbly, feeling strangely light-headed because this was all so wrong, all so out of proportion and it was going to hurt them, he knew it was going to hurt them. This was going to break Tony. It was going to cut him deeper than any weapon, and last longer than any poison. It would leave their relationship in tatters. They might never recover. It wasn't supposed to be like this, he was supposed to be able to fix this.
And there it was, the real danger. Tony, kneeling in front of the broken soldier and looking up at him like he was the most precious thing in the world... saw through him like glass.
They never did it like this. Steve walked on glass around Tony, always terrified of even scratching his lover because that was who he was: he cared. He felt and ached and loved, and he wouldn't apologize for that even if Tony mocked it constantly. He cared about everyone, and so deeply, and he was so careful around Tony. But if Tony hurt Steve, on the other hand, they never spoke of it. Steve didn't show it; Tony didn't acknowledge it. Because they both knew how much the super-solider could take, and how much stronger he was than the average man.
Six months ago, the team was in Uzbekistan.
"Tony... Tony's home." Tony is my home.
Steve allowed his eyes to flutter shut in brief frustration, his tone growing sharp in anger and pain. "Would you be this paranoid if it had been the other way around?"
"You know, I'm really not sure how cheap, Asian-made DVD sets are going to make a good impression on these guys..." Pepper was thinking out loud from the next aisle, humoring Tony's poor taste in gifts by joining the search. Clearly, she hadn't found any satisfactory vino.
Even so... he wasn't ready for it to happen just yet. Not now. Not today.
"How's the bike?" Tony looked Steve right in the eye when he said it, and the super-soldier wavered. Tony was giving him the chance to call his own bluff.
Tony didn't know what to say. Wit escaped him; logic fled. He had no cure for this.
“I’m sorry I let you push me away,” Tony went on, shaking his head. “I really should have known better. I should have—“
He was cold. Horribly, unbelievably cold. His eyes were open, but he couldn't see anything. A foggy white film had descended over his vision, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't close his eyes.
Steve couldn’t even remember what peace felt like.
"Come on."
He couldn’t have said how long they laid there intertwined, stretched across that old couch like a pair of lovestruck teenagers.  Tony smiling against Steve’s lips, the soldier floating in bliss and the ache of relief. The voices in his head were quiet, drowned out by the skin-on-skin contact, the roar of blood in his ears.
"Uh-huh."
Tony was staring at him in that familiar way, like he was having an entire conversation with him without saying a word.  Steve forced himself not to look away, reading intensity and passion and awe and something so much deeper in the brown depths.
"Yeah."
Tony rambled on, “that works too—”
Clint and Steve had fallen together, like coins into a slot machine. There had been no defining moment or sudden revelation that cemented their friendship. They were both men whose lives were ruled by their occupations, and whose occupations were governed by skill, composure, and rationale. They worked together, even lived together in some cases. Fought together, and for the same things. It simply made sense.
The countryside was all on fire.
But the next time they had attended a briefing aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Hellicarrier and Tony caught Clint making a pass at Steve, he exploded. Their ensuing fistfight knocked out the power in an entire deck and earned them both a stern conversation with Fury and a prompt ejection from the ship.
“I’m looking alright,”  Tony had the nerve to smile, “and I can’t believe how much I missed those baby blues.”
Something inside the soldier snapped.
It might be nothing; a meaningless little token of good humor. But on the other hand, it might mean everything... change everything.
"Yeah. Well, I think I'll be the judge of that."
Two patches of warmth interrupted the cold: one on his upper arm, hot and tight like a brand being pressed to his skin. The other on his left side, piercing through muscle and tissue to tickle at his internal organs, sparking pain and memory with it.
He remembered.
The silence that followed was loaded and heavy. Steve could physically feel all that Clint had not yet said; wanted to say, needed to. They knew each other too well, by now.
A dog was barking, somewhere in the twilight gray. A car drove over a manhole, and the lid clattered and rang down the empty street. Glen Miller drifted through an open window. Mom probably had dinner ready. It smelled like stew. Where had she gotten the money for groceries? He needed to find a second job; needed to fix this. Needed to try enlisting, one more time...
"You're really, truly, insane, aren't you?" Clint breathed, shaking the soldier gently as he searched his eyes. "You're not—you can't—really be thinking about going back... pretending that nothing happened?"
"Not where it counts," Tony seemed relieved to be able to return the old line, his warm breath ghosting across Steve's skin. "You gonna keep your feet, soldier?"
Steve had believed, for months on end as he lay there, that he was only waiting to die.
It was no surprise he'd fallen so hard.  After tasting that moment, all others simply paled in comparison.  He'd be chasing that high for as long as he lived.
Tony cursed unintelligablly, and Steve gave up on the effort. The solider turned away in disgust, dropping his duffel onto the tile beside the bar. He would pick it up later. For now, he needed to change the outcome of this all-too-familiar situation, and the only way he knew how to do that was by removing himself from it completely.
Steve gripped the other man's arm and squeezed, his throat constricted to the point where he didn't trust himself with words.  He'd thought he had long ago reached the limit of the amount of guilt, self-loathing, and suffering he could bear... he'd been wrong.
Or not,
In a rush of speed and movement, the pair made it safely back to the transport, where Natasha was tossing the last body out the bay doors. Steve crumpled onto the deck, his legs made of jello, and tried not to heave as the vertigo slowly subsided. He pretended not to notice the way Clint looked at him, or the way that he hovered protectively for the rest of the mission.
Breathing heavily through his nose, Steve braced himself as Tony stormed forward, straight towards him. He was convinced the billionaire would take a swing—they were going by the script, here, after all—but instead the armored hand wrapped around the back of Steve's neck and the soldier was being pulled forward, his anger swallowed by a hot, demanding mouth. He hesitated to ever call this kissing, because he didn't remember the gesture as being so violent, so harsh and unyielding. He had a hard time associating this with love.
"Yes, sir."
The super-soldier looked like he was a breath away from protesting, and Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "You want to be hitting the gym later, you hit that first. I don't want another call telling me that you passed out on the bag again."
Tony must have noticed that his boyfriend was being oddly quiet because he paused whatever he was doing to glance over his shoulder. He seemed casual enough at first, but he caught sight of the soldier's bruised features and oddly defeated posture and quickly did a double take.
"Oh, I just thought I'd drop in to make sure Steve was still alive," the assassin remarked darkly.
"They say watching people is creepy." Clint's voice broke the stillness. "I say, its the only way you really learn anything about them."
"Now you don't want me?" The billionaire tilted his head, voice quiet. Steve heard it clearly, an eerie overtone in moaning wind.
Steve swallowed, wondering why those words were so hard to hear. "You don't understand..." was the only, and possibly the lamest thing that he could think of to say.
But today... Tony was really standing here.  In his tiny kitchen, close enough to touch, preparing some kind of culinarily masterpiece with a handful of eggs and spices because there really wasn’t anything he couldn’t do well. Steve was hoping the light of day might make it easier to understand this surreal situation, but as it turned out he was dead wrong.
There was no arguing. Tony gently but firmly removed Steve's grip from his arm and tugged the soaking wet t-shirt up over the soldier's head. It joined the jacket, forgotten in a dismal mess on the floor. Steve was proud that he managed not to shiver as the cool air met damp, naked skin, but it reminded him all too keenly of the fact that nothing now stood between his mess of thick white bandages and Tony's line of sight.
That got him a broad grin in return. “So tell me, Steve. Do we have a wedding date set?”
of that introduction.”
“Tony,” Steve repeated as he took his hand and nearly shivered at the drag of calluses against his skin. Losing himself in the fact that he was
introduction?”
“I mean…” Steve gave him as pointed a look as he could manage when he was still half asleep. Mornings had never been his forte. “I’m just saying, it probably wouldn’t have surprised anyone if you had.”
, Rhodey.” He turned back to Steve, still smiling. “It’s fine, you’re fine. Don’t go.”
Tony started laughing, smothering little giggles -- which kinda proved Steve’s point in the most adorable way possible -- into Steve’s collarbone. “Jesus Christ, Steve. Are you gonna let me give you a pre-wedding blow job or not?”
“The man who’s gonna marry you,” Steve replied before he’d even had time to think about it. He felt his eyes go wide. “I mean. Oh my god.”
“Fuck, Tony,” he told him, voice coming out in a low rasp.
But Tony was laughing now, eyes sparkling and somehow, miraculously, looking almost endeared by him. He arched his eyebrows at Jim. “Is he always like this?”
As Steve watched Jim make his way over to his friend, Bucky scrubbed a hand over his face and gave Sam a half-hearted glare. “You forgot to warn Jim about Steve. There’s something wrong with him.”
Steve stared at him. “Seriously?”
. You’re spending too much time with Rhodey, and I’m banning you from hanging out with him anymore. The point being that no, I did not plan a surprise wedding five months into our relationship.”
Sam snickered as Bucky grumbled something under his breath and Steve ignored them both entirely as Jim and Tony made their way over to them. Tony waved at Sam as they got closer, a sweet little smile on his face that had Steve melting.
“Oh god.” Steve pressed his face into his hands and then peered at Tony from between his fingers. “I didn’t even tell you my name?”
“Great!” Tony caught his hand and, before they could go anywhere, leaned in, giving Steve a quick kiss that, for all its brevity, made Steve’s toes curl in his shoes. Then he pulled back and led Steve toward the door. “Come on, Future Husband. This place is gonna blow your socks off.”
burger you’ve ever had.”
the two of them had in common -- while Steve appealed to Jim to just take Sam away and save him. It was fun and familiar, and all-in-all Steve was having a pretty good night.
you can skip the foreplay.” He huffed out a laugh, the sound thin and reedy as Tony pressed a teasing kiss to the slit of his cock. “Please don’t tease.”
Tony shook his head, keeping his eyes closed and rubbing his forehead against Steve’s neck. “Nothing, I take it all back,” he said, words slurring together and Steve traced the thick vein running the length of him and then rubbed his thumb just under his head. “Oh, fuck Steve,” he said. “It’s not gonna take much.” He didn’t seem to notice his hand moving to Steve’s hip, gripping hard enough that Steve could feel his skin start to bruise. He rewarded Tony with a tight squeeze that had him throbbing in his grip. “Fuck, I’m so close.” He panted into Steve’s neck, rolling his hips against Steve’s side. “Just a little harder, baby please.”
“I kinda do.” It was kind of hard to breathe between the pillow and Tony on top of him, so Steve elbowed him until he got the message and rolled away, letting Steve come back up for air. He turned to face Tony, squinting at him suspiciously. “Wait, you didn’t plan an actual secret wedding or something, did you?”
Tony laughed, delighted. “I know I’ve been known to do some… Spontaneous things before--,”
Steve groaned loudly, fingers twisting in the sheets as his hips twitched up in Tony’s hold. “Oh god,” he mumbled, already feeling his breath start to go, practically panting in anticipation. “Come on, sweetheart. I just woke up, you
He sounded genuinely pleased and Steve laughed a little, giving a shrug. “Well, winter’s too cold, spring always destroys me with allergies, and summer --”
He cut himself off with a low moan, eyes falling shut as Steve wrapped a hand around his cock, giving him a slow stroke. Steve could feel his pulse throbbing beneath sensitive skin, and he smirked.
“Jesus Bucky, I’m fine, okay? I’m -- oh shit, he’s coming over.”
“Holy shit,” he gasped, completely derailing whatever the other three were talking about.
Tony flopped onto his back as he considered this. “Probably not,” he conceded before making a face. “My mom would kill me though. I’m pretty sure she’s been looking forward to planning my wedding since I was born. But anyway.” He rolled back in toward Steve, unable to lie still. “We only just moved in together. I wanna enjoy living in sin a little longer.”
Tony was looking absolutely delighted. “Nope.”
Steve just shook his head. “No,” he told him bluntly. “Who is that?”
And then he saw him.
“That’s one way to put it,” Steve muttered, but he managed a shy smile of his own. “It’s nice to meet you too.”
Steve tilted his head to frown at him. “When did you take off your clothes?” he asked, snickering when Tony just gave him a dirty look.
“Oh my god,” Steve groaned. “I’m never going to live this down, am I?”
“Mmm.” Tony followed him, draping himself over Steve’s back instead and kissing his ear to make him shiver. “No you don’t.”
Steve hummed along to the music that was filtering through the apartment, still sipping at his first beer because, contrary to what Bucky liked to claim, he actually
Steve sighed, and considered trying to go back to sleep anyway, but as stubborn as he could be, Tony could be even worse, and he had a feeling that he wasn’t going to let whatever this was go. Relenting just a little, he rolled over onto his back, squinting up at Tony with half closed eyes. “What?” he asked. “Did you even sleep?”
Tony just shrugged, but he looked pleased. “Well, you know,” he told him, shifting to flop onto his side beside Steve. “That’s what I’m here for.” He pressed in close, planting a kiss on Steve’s cheek, and a punched out, needy gasp slipped past his throat when his cock dragged over Steve’s hip, hard and hot and wet at the tip.
"What do you want to hear?" Steve twisted his hand in his borrowed shirt to hide a fresh wave of pain coursing throughout his body. "I'm not leaving Tony. That isn't an option."
"He... he'll get over it," Steve breathed tiredly, wishing that were the truth.
His heartbeat calmed.  His muscles relaxed. A heady euphoria he only experienced with the help of liquor and pills these days had found a home in his chest.  It curled up and rested there like it wanted to stay.
The voice startled him, and Steve latched onto the flimsy metal sink in front of him so quickly it made the pipes creak in protest as he nearly pulled it out of the wall.
Back in the present, Steve watched the well-defined muscles roll in Tony’s shoulders as he moved, and allowed himself to be mesmerized. He floated somewhere between memory and reality and watched the lines blur dangerously.
"I should go."
Steve had a nightmare one night and woke up to discover he'd broken Tony's nose, thrashing in his sleep. He apologized profusely, wrecked with guilt, but the brunette assured him it was nothing at all and he should just go back to sleep.
Hawkeye's jaw was visibly clenched, and he turned away, standing and moving across the room as if he couldn't stand to look Steve in the eye for another second.
His eyes traveled slowly upwards, taking in the sea of headstones lit only by the dim New York streetlights. Some of those stones showed familiar names. Many of them he'd known... shaken hands with, led into battle. Some had been lost as they fought by his side. Still more he had never known, never seen. Their names had been unfamiliar.
Steve had survived a lot.  He still didn't know if he was strong enough for that one.
"Sleep."
"Finally," Tony was saying from the kitchen without turning around. He sounded mercifully sober. "I was wondering when you were going to show up. Boy, have I had a weird day..."
“Talk to me, kid,” Tony’s voice was soft in the stillness.
Tony sat—more like sprawled, really—across the only piece of furniture that remained intact in the suite. It was a leather love seat that now sagged in the middle. It had creaked alarmingly and made a loud snapping noise when he'd plopped down onto it, but he was so far past caring that the sound had simply been amusing.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to everyone who came through and left kudos, and even to those who only took the time to read and move on.
"Abbot and Costello?" Steve joked dryly as he joined Tony in the kitchen, and it fell even flatter as he caught Tony's grimace.
This time, there was no iron angel falling out of the sky to stop his descent. There were no strong arms, no flash of white light to signal salvation.
“Always the martyr,” Tony shook his head fondly, “when are you going to learn?” Warm lips pressed a kiss into Steve's hair, strong fingers threading into the blonde strands at the base of Steve's skull. “You know, I really thought you were done with me. Should've known you'd be holed up somewhere, too stubborn to ask for help... too righteous to admit what you want.”
"It's raining."
Alarmingly sober and unflinchingly present, Steve felt it all and it was everything he needed.  It was a first taste of water after a grueling ruck. It was his two strong feet landing on an American tarmac after an exhausting deployment, armed with that unwavering knowledge that Tony was only a short drive away from him after too long.
Steve froze, mind going blank as every deflection and explanation fled his mind. It felt as though the air had been sucked straight out of his lungs.
The moment didn’t last. Tony was turning on the balls of his feet to tip the warped skillet over Steve’s plate. He’d clearly made enough for them both, and as usual, served Steve an obvious lion’s share. For what appeared to be over-easy eggs with a side of buttered toast, the food smelled like a feast.
The second attempt was marginally more successful, and with the support of the wire-grate shelves to his immediate left, he was able to remain standing. Thankfully, the shelves were sturdier than they looked. He limped his way to the window and only source of light, his body making itself aware of every forgotten bump and bruise as he did so. He caught hold of the thin sill, sweat beading on his brow, but feeling extremely accomplished for making it the short distance.
Steve doubted he was that lucky.
Surely Tony could see that.
The super-soldier blinked dully, bringing lines and shapes and colors into better, though not perfect, focus. Bruce stood across the room at a stainless steel sink, washing off the blood that was now caked up to his elbows. He didn't remember the pain stopping... but that was because it hadn't. It was difficult to differentiate the feel of hands sifting through his internal organs and the raw pain left in the aftermath of... whatever Bruce had done. Whatever he'd done to himself.
By the time he understood that it was hailing on the thin roof and rattling windows, his heart was racing and he'd shot halfway into an upright position. His body was quick to punish him for this knee-jerk reaction, and he cradled his ripped abdomen and tried to get a grip on his surroundings.
Steve wanted to calm the archer down; allay the fears and suspicions that were undoubtedly building in his mind, but he found that he didn't actually have the energy to say anything more. And then the phone line clicked, and it wasn't hard to let the device slide out of his blood-slicked grip and bounce against the cradle. He didn't bother putting it back properly.
Tony really didn't like the tone of that. "What's that supposed to mean?"
The first time they slept together, they broke the bed.
Steve blinked.
Steve frowned, head falling back because holding it up at all was exhausting.
Shrugging when memory didn't return, Tony fetched a bottle of juice from the refrigerator and stood quietly at the window, eying the shattered glass balcony and wondering why the damage there sparked such a strange uneasiness in his gut.
"Too deep, Steve..." He muttered tiredly to himself, running a hand through his rumpled blond hair, wincing as he inadvertently pulled at a cut above his eyebrow.
The billionaire turned sharply and moved away, halfway down the hall. Steve was half-convinced he would just leave altogether, but this time the brunette didn't go far. He paused, hands on his hips, and turned back to face Steve. He watched him, his expression painfully guarded and cautious.
Sometimes, the best way to protect someone was with a lie.
Steve remembered finding Clint sitting alone on the empty air deck of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hellicarrier. Selfishly, a small part of him wanted to turn away; find his own isolated corner to sit, to shield his eyes and nurse his aching heart. They'd lost so many men... too many men. He felt the desperate need to pull himself together before facing the rest of his team.
Look where it had left him.
That should have been a warning for what they could expect out of the rest of their relationship.
"That, I didn't get."
"Sir," Jarvis announced before Steve could find the words to properly address the horrible, loaded silence between them, "you have a visitor in the elevator. Shall I admit him?"
The cold—all he really remembered from his first brief stint of consciousness the night before—was now back with a vengeance, seeping into flesh and bone and sapping his strength and resolve. As much as he hated the idea of needing any time to recuperate, he was fairly certain that a few days spent in bed would cure everything this time. How to pull off that kind of retreat without arousing Tony's suspicion was the truly challenging piece of this puzzle.
Steve thought of the extravagant stainless-steel kitchen in Tony’s loft in Soho.  Of coming back from a long run in the early morning dew and crisp air. Of Guns N’ Roses turned up too loud and blasting through the speakers while Tony made more French toast and bacon than either of them could possibly eat.  He thought of getting distracted halfway through breakfast and letting Tony drag him back to bed.
“Hey no, wait.” Tony elbowed Jim, who was laughing so hard he had his face buried in Sam’s shoulder. “Shut
.” His voice hitched on the last word as Tony dragged his teeth over the sensitive spot on his thigh.
“Ah, fuck,” Tony said after a few moments, breaking the comfortable silence. He lifted his head to blink dopily at Steve, grinning like an idiot. “That was awesome.”
“Come home with me,” he blurted out, and felt his heart sink as both Bucky and Sam facepalmed. For all his grandstanding, Bucky may have had a point.
“Your first words to me were a proposal,” Tony pointed out dryly. “That’s pretty lame, Steve.”
“Oh my god,” Sam breathed, laughing and looking over at Jim. He shook his head and rubbed a hand over his face like he was waiting for Jim’s cue. “Babe?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “What
“Worst boyfriend ever,” he informed him when Tony pulled away. He stretched a little beneath the sheets, sinking into the ultra-soft pillows that Tony had -- thankfully -- insisted on when they’d moved into together a few weeks earlier. “What’s so important?”
“Obviously.” Tony lifted his head enough to give him a fond eye roll. “Isn’t that the traditional groom’s gift?”
For a minute Steve just lay on his back, staring sightlessly up at the ceiling. Then there was the rustling of sheets and Tony squirmed his way back into the fresh air, hovering over Steve on his elbows so he didn’t squash him. He was flushed from exertion and the heat of his blankets, a loose curl sticking to his forehead with sweat, and he beamed down at Steve.
“Uh, hey guys,” he offered, turning toward Steve and Bucky. “You’re Sam’s friends, right? Sam talks about you a lot, it’s good to finally meet you.” He rubbed at the back of his neck, just a little awkward, and Steve couldn’t stand it anymore.
“Oh jesus,” Bucky muttered as Sam and Jim both craned their necks to see who he was talking about. “Not again.” Steve punched him.
“Oooh, a fall wedding. Pretty!”
“Because you were blinded by my beauty?” Tony offered.
Jim was laughing too, but eyeing Steve speculatively at the same time. He arched his eyebrows at Sam, the two of them sharing a glance before he looked back over at Steve. “Uhh, well. That would be my best friend. Tony.”
-- back out before he could lose track of him among all the other people and nearly sighed at how gorgeous he was. “I think I love him.”
“Fuck it, it is now.”
Tony tilted his head and arched an eyebrow, still grinning. “What, you don’t like burgers? Weird, you seem like a burger guy to me.”
“Oh fuck, Tony, baby, ‘m gonna come.” He was panting hard now, feeling a little dizzy with the lack of oxygen getting to his brain, and he rolled his head against the cool cotton of the pillow beneath him. He was right on the edge, could practically taste his orgasm. “God, Tony, please,” he wailed, forgetting about the neighbours entirely. An instant later, Tony was sliding a hand down past Steve’s balls, stroking his thumb over his hole until it caught on the rim. Steve was pretty sure he stopped breathing entirely as his body went stiff and then he was spilling down Tony’s throat, waves of pleasure washing over him and body so tense he wasn’t sure he’d be able to move after.
Steve just closed his eyes, not even noticing that he was still holding Tony’s hand. “Yup,” he agreed, voice dry. “That’s exactly what I am.”
know his limits. Mostly. When it came to drinking, anyway.
He felt Tony snicker into his skin and then he was swallowing him down again, doing something with his tongue in the process that had Steve suddenly, embarrassingly close to the edge. He rolled his head back against the pillow and panted up at the ceiling, biting down hard on his lower lip as he tried to hold on just a little longer. Apparently Tony was having none of that though, because he slid a hand blindly up Steve’s chest until he could pinch and rub at his nipple, sending sparks shooting up Steve’s spine. He braced his legs, thighs trembling, and Tony’s hand settled on his skin, stroking soothingly.
“Probably not,” Tony agreed cheerfully. “So?”
“There’s everything wrong with you.”
He’d turned away to grab another drink, and for just a moment it was like the crowd parted and Steve had a perfect view of the most beautiful man in the world. He was just coming into the party, looking around for someone and laughing, his entire face lit up with it. He had dark, fluffy curls, one of which was falling over his forehead, and Steve wanted to brush it back so badly that his fingers actually twitched.
laughing at him. “Really?”
Bucky was saved having to continue their witty repartee when Sam spotted them from across the room, his boyfriend Jim in tow. He hollered out a hello, dragging Jim through the small crowd of people between them, and Steve laughed as he waved back. He’d known Sam for years, ever since he’d rescued Steve from a fight one night and the former field medic had bandaged Steve up to save him an ER bill, and they all slid into conversation as easily as they ever did. Bucky and Sam shifted right into making fun of Steve -- the only thing that Bucky
Bucky eyed him skeptically. “You’re in a suspiciously good mood for someone who got beat up earlier today.”
Sam looked unconcerned, patting Steve on the shoulder. “Don’t stress so much, Barnes. He’ll be fine.”
“God, you’re such a doofus.”
Steve gave him a skeptical look, eyeing their terrible friends who were
“Peter, listen to your dad. You’re staying out of this,” Steve suddenly intercepts, helping Tony out in his quest to keep Peter out of the fight.
Tony wonders just how long they can hold on before the dam will break again.
“Whoa- but dad! There’s some things I need to tell you! About these guys robbing a bank, and they had these
It’s all around him, though. On his left a lingerie-store where he sees some men looking. On his right a news stand where he can catch a glimpse of a few magazines that should not be seen by children. There’s even a badly hidden sex-store somewhere around there, where he sees a young couple walking inside, giggling with their hands locked.
“I’m sorry, Peter,” she says sadly. Then she pulls back, putting her hands on Peter’s cheeks to take a good look at him. “He’s heavily under watch, but the encephalopathy is already starting.”
“Good.” Yaël kicked off her shoes as soon as she walked inside her apartment. She went to her bedroom and tried undressing herself with just one hand while holding the phone with the other. It had been a long working day and after installing a new fence in someone’s garden and painting it, Yaël just wanted to go to sleep. “I should call him tomorrow, shouldn’t I?”
"It was alright, Mr. Collins gave us back our Chemistry test, and I aced it," he says, as if it's not that big of a deal. To be honest, it's not really. It's not like it's hard for him to get an A+. "What are you making?"
“Maybe two times is a bit too much before bed,” Tony mutters against, only barely audible. Steve kisses his cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony shakes his head. “You can’t ask that of me,” he whispers out. “I would never put anything before you.”
There’s a moment of silence. Peter can finally see what’s happening as he stands at the doorway. There he sees Steve, kneeling down on the ground while holding Mr. Stark’s face in his hands.
“Well, it’s not impossible,” Steve mutters out. Tony sighs but then puts his head back down.
“Eddie! Oh my God, what are you doing here?!” Peter asks, not even bothering to think about the fact that Spider-Man shouldn’t know Eddie. The jock just chuckles slightly before shaking his head.
“Eh, pretty much,” for a second she hesitated if she really wanted the stamp saying ‘one-night-sting-girl’ on her forehead. But it was Peter, and she didn’t want to be ashamed of herself.“There was somebody, but he only just left again, though I don’t know where,” she lowered her back and made herself comfortable by laying on Peter’s legs. He didn’t really react to that, like it was all natural, well, which made it all natural, of course.
“But… why are we pretending?” Tony wonders. Mary huffs out a breath, clearly disbelieving. Tony just wishes they wouldn’t be arguing about this in front of the kids. He takes a quick look behind him, finding the girl crying against her older brother, while Peter is just glaring at the two of them. The middle-son ignores it all.
“Oh, hey Steve,” Peter says, sitting up in his surprise. He hisses when his ribs protest against the movement. “How have you been?”
Okay, okay, he can do that. After pressing the panic button on Peter’s remote, he leans forward, grabbing on to Peter’s right side and pulling him towards him, until he’s lying on his left side.
Tony snorts, looking over at Peter after that. He holds out his hand and gestures him to come closer, which the kid does.
There are screens in front of him, footage of something Peter can’t really place. He doesn’t pay attention to it anyway. If Tony wants him to know about it, he’ll tell him.
The sky is dark, which makes the thing all the more obvious. It looks like a comet, probably? A small one, surely. The only problem is that it’s headed straight for them.
“Yeah, apparently so,” Peter mumbles out. Another sigh escapes his mouth, and Peter tries to reposition himself into a comfortable position so he can catch up on some sleep.
“I thinking about making something, but I didn’t have any inspiration. FRIDAY suggested I should go look through his old archive of inventions over the years.”
Peter’s phone goes off on the nightstand. Tony looks to the side, feeling Peter stir a bit in his arms. Luckily, he doesn’t wake up. Tony carefully leans to the side to take the phone. After seeing who’s calling, he quickly picks it up.
Peter sags his shoulders, suddenly ashamed. “That first part’s true I’m afraid, though I do have a very reasonable explanation for it. As for that second part; who is kicking my ass?”
As her wounded hand refused to stop aching, Yaël had to wander around, mostly in circles, using only one hand, while humming a bit.
The phone-call ends when they make an agreement for Ross to come by at the compound tomorrow around eleven, and then Tony hangs up the phone with a loud sigh. The first thing he does is rub his forehead, taking a few seconds to breathe.
“Eh, three is better than none, right?” Tony suggests. The joke doesn’t catch. Ross rests his head on his fist and gives him a long look, which Tony ignores.
“Uh, what’s going on?” he asks, confused. Tony points towards the couch before putting his finger to his lip.
“Then you’re supposed to be dead,” Raido threw back “And what’s dead, is supposed to stay dead. So maybe you should just walk into the kingdom and die!”
We can burn brighter
“That’s okay, baby. We’ll make a rain-check, alright?” Not that he was intending on having sex right now. Seeing Steve drunk has mostly been fun , but it hasn’t exactly improved Tony’s lust for the evening. Tony undoes his belt and pulls his pants off in one swift motion.
“These accords suck, that is what they do,” Yaël muttered before thinking about it. Wow, she interrupted Peter and sounded as bitter as an old, grumpy man. She’d better go and take a walk around the city.
with this stuff? “So far, Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow and Vision have signed, along with many foreign heroes.”
“Yeah, I just…” Steve reached up a hand to scratch the back of his head. He could tell Natasha, right? She would listen to him, she wouldn’t joke about it. She’d keep a secret. “I think I-“
They’d taken to each other in a way that danced the fine line between obsession and love—a word they didn’t speak. They never needed to. When they were together, in those stolen moments sweet and infinite, they were the only planets in each other’s universe. Nothing and no one else mattered. Caught up in each other’s gravity, they exploded like stars and basked in the fall.
The soldier swallowed hard and let his gaze slide across to meet Tony’s.  The brunette was sitting almost facing him on the couch, one leg tucked underneath him so he could turn his entire body and attention towards the soldier. He noted distantly that at some point Tony had pulled on a shirt, a plain white thing that still managed to look expensive.
Clint stepped to the side as the elevator chimed, leaning against the wall near the control panel. Steve pretended not to feel the eyes boring into his skull, pretended not to feel the worry and uncertainty rolling off the assassin in waves.
As the door shut behind Bruce, Clint was saying something reassuring to Steve, a warm hand on his cold forehead. The soldier couldn't make out a word of it, but he allowed himself to remember that here, for now, he was safe. He shivered in the aching cold, and turned his forehead into that soothing warmth.
It was the same reason he’d been in hiding, crawling home in shame on a returning troop transport, lacking all fanfare. Why his Purple Heart still sat in a cardboard box by the couch collecting dust. Why every gilded invitation from the Brooklyn Veteran’s Award’s Committee, the same dinner where he’d met Tony all those years ago, now found itself in the trash bin unopened.
Steve was no pushover. The super-soldier serum combined with the now-natural strength he honed daily allowed him to stand toe-to-toe with some of the most powerful beings on earth. But when a mechanical suit set at full capacity punched him through a brick wall—and his shield was nowhere to be found—it damn well hurt.
Yes, Tony Stark was mad in love with Steve. But at the moment, he was the only one who knew that, and he fully intended to keep it that way, because Tony Stark didn't do love.
Steve channeled his pain into a burst of adrenaline, and managing to get his legs wrapped around the merc's. He twisted, and the larger soldier was moving, falling. The man managed to lodge his hand into Steve's harness, and before the super soldier could stop him, the mercenary and Steve's parachute were sliding away into the night.
Tony's expression, as briefly as it came and vanished, nearly broke Steve's heart.
Despite the command, Steve couldn’t stop. He knew Tony didn’t understand what he was saying, didn’t comprehend how much of Steve’s light had been permanently extinguished.  He didn’t understand that he was already talking to a ghost.
"Well, don't let the door hit you on the way—"
Knowing that if he stalled for time for much longer he would really start to lose it, Steve shook out his shoulders and headed for the door. He told himself that all he had to do was make it through a few minutes of idle conversation and compulsory smiles, and then he could beat a hasty retreat to the dark bedroom and a solid night's sleep.
for him.  Tony was everything he wanted, then and now.  And the equally brutal truth was that he was everything Steve no longer deserved.
Blinking at the door across the room, Steve steeled himself.  The first hour of his day was always the most difficult, and it didn't seem to matter the circumstances.
Jamming his left crutch under his arm, he freed up a hand to reach out and pop open the creaky doorknob.
How Tony could constantly mystify him and at the same time, could bare his soul, was something Steve would never understand.
"A DVD set?" He could hear the disapproval in her voice as he pitched his thoughts on a suitable gift for the Japanese super-company they were slated to sign with the next week. "I don't know, Tony..."
The question wasn't fair, and he knew it. But he didn't know how much more of this he could take.
Both of the the clerks he'd questioned had urged him to call a cab, remarking on the poor weather and the fact that the tower was nearly four miles away. He'd smiled and thanked them politely, apologizing for tracking puddles of water into their businesses before making his way back out into the rain.
The meaning of his words went unspoken: I came. Tony didn't.
me...”
"I'm still breathing." Steve tried for a lopsided grin. It fell away quickly.
It took him far too long to remember the number he needed.
"Not smiling like that, you can't." Tony pointed at Bruce accusingly with his juice bottle.
Seeming to read his mind in that uncanny way he had, Tony didn’t move away.  Instead his fingers moved in Steve’s hair, his forehead tipping forward to rest against the blonde’s.  Steve could feel the heartbeat pounding against his own, taking a small satisfaction in the erratic rhythm he could feel beating through his shirt.
He'd come home to find Steve a trembling wreck, drenched in sweat, his eyes glassy and unseeing because he was trapped; always trapped. Bodies everywhere; he couldn't move. The ice was his prison. He couldn't even scream.
“Um.” Tony turned to him with wide, startled eyes, blinking a couple times, but there was a twitch at the corner of his lips. “Who are you?”
Steve grumbled as something ticked at the back of his neck, pulling him out the dream he’d been having. He swatted back, hand not catching anything, and heard a soft huff of laughter from behind him.
Sam shoots another small glance towards Natasha. Tony, too, gives her a quick look, finding her staring ahead without as much as an expression. She’s good at keeping poker faces, but right now, the fact that she’s putting one up is indication enough that she’s trying to hide something.
“It’s possible… I’ll have FRIDAY look over the footage inside his mask,” Tony returns. He then turns to Steve, who has been a constant presence at his side. “Honey, could you-“
“Isn’t it?” Peter asks in a whisper, probably not wanting Tony to hear it. But the man does, and he looks up to him with wide eyes and a mouth fallen open.
But Yaël was smart enough to understand. Fury put her in a cage like a wild animal to see if she’d become the beast he thought she was.
“B-but why not?” he muttered awkwardly.
“Cousin,” Tony counters, just a little bit playfully. Sharon smirks at him, but only faintly.
Peter shifts a bit, then nodding. “I, uh, the others are here? About the test?”
“You woke up here without knowing how you got here? I’m pretty sure that Venom possessed you and used your body to travel all the way here. But… if he’s let go of you, that probably means-“
?! Really?” he grunted “It’s not normal, Yaël!”
going to college after he graduates?
Peter hums in understanding, though still a bit curious. He knows about Dr. Octavius, of course. Ned once wrote a piece on him, and Peter had read through it to check for spelling-errors. He’s done some good work, but nothing really note-worthy that would get him in the papers.
“Is that why you’re so early?”
Not only because he’s still feeling hyper from the whole Thanos-ordeal. He’s mostly anxious because he needs to get out of the house, to get some time away from his now two overprotective dads who won’t even let him out as Spider-Man for two hours straight. It’s driving him crazy, to say the least!
After a while the two of them join the two others again. They decide to pull up a movie to offer some form of relaxation to the scientist who has been gone for a long time. They chose the newest Star Wars movie, since Bruce missed the release of that one. Tony brings up some popcorn. They don’t leave the couch the entire evening. After the movie, they go to bed.
“Destroyed? I thought Thor wanted to prevent Ragnarok?” he asks. Peter shrugs.
There’s also the darker things going on, like Wanda and Vision failing at their first attempt to create a child. It was sad, because Tony actually saw the two boys, the babies. They had looked healthy, ready for life. But bad shit happened, and they’re just… no longer there. It’s safe to say that Wanda didn’t really take it all that well.
“Y-es?” Tony tries. Steve nods at him before reaching an arm towards him and pulling him along a bit.
Peter is quiet, unmoving. His eyes have already bruised, and there’s a cut on his cheek that has already been stitched by Dr. Cho earlier. His arms and legs look blue and purple as well, and there’s an IV passing some fluids with medication through his veins. Tony hates to see him like this.
“Yes, yes, I’m fine,” Steve says, quickly giving him a smile over his shoulder. “Can you take some plates? I think they are in the bottom right cabinet.”
“Wouldn’t you be a victim of them as well?” Wanda questions. Yaël shrugs.
The next morning she wobbled around the compound, her arm hooked through Steve’s. The fun thing was, Yaël seemed to vaguely remember her way through the building. It was no wonder as she used to live there a whole while ago.
“Come and catch me, sweetcheeks!” she counters before disappearing completely. Peter swings back up, going after her without any question. He still needs to know what the tritium was for, after all!
They formulate a plan. Nobody really involves Tony or Steve, who are still holding each other as they look at Peter’s still form, kneeling down next to them. It’s going to be alright, they’ll go back, and Tony can make sure that Peter will never get hurt by that bastard.
“Oh, no, don’t say-“ Natasha starts. Steve clears his throat.
When the girl pulls off her mask, Peter isn’t surprised to see Gwen underneath it.
“Wait, you mean that you’re very much in love with yourself?” Tony asks. Steve snorts.
Steve got to see the new suits Tony made. There were a few. But even more, Tony appeared to have been started on what he called the ‘Iron Legion’. Some sort of army of suits, operated each individually by JARVIS. Steve found himself rather impressed, really. Especially given the fact that, after half a year, STARK-tower seemed to have been changed completely into Avengers-tower.
Peter dresses up at school. Not with expensive clothes, or with designer shoes. He puts on the least remarkable outfits, and gets himself some glasses that don’t correct his sight at all. When the others ask him why he does it, he says they’ll see eventually.
Wanda and Sam feel like Steve’s not where he’s supposed to be. Steve wants to shout it out when he hears their hesitation on it all, but the three of them agree that they can’t just ignore T’Challa’s wishes and storm off without a warning. Besides, they have no plane to fly.
“Don’t say it’s that ex-boyfriend of yours?” Peter asks, remembering the confrontation they’ve had in that alley where that guy didn’t want to leave her alone. MJ laughs at that.
“I don’t really think ‘normal’ is possible with the two of you,” Peter adds. He grabs for his mask before getting on his feet. Taking the phone back in his hand, Peter stretches his neck and takes a swing of his glass of water. It tastes horrible, having stayed there the entire night, but at the same time it feels good to have something cool pass through his throat.
Peter takes in the apologetic expression for a few more seconds before shrugging.
“Whatever you say, darling.”
“Uh, might have to remove the metal plates first,” Peter mutters to himself, but giving it a long look, he figures he doesn’t really have any idea how to do that. Maybe he needs to randomly press buttons? But then again, Mr. Stark did say that the thing didn’t work anymore, so it might not open up at all.
Shit, fuck, fuck! She tried crawling out of the mud. But every scoop of dirt the two guards threw onto her made her fall down again. She wasn’t fast enough to dig herself out again, shredding her nails by trying to remove the mud. It fell on her face, and after few scoops, Yaël couldn’t follow anymore in getting it away from her nose and mouth to breathe. Her chest felt heavy and painful, a squeak left her mouth as soon as breathing became impossible. And as if it wasn’t bad enough yet, it started raining.
- Minor character Death (though in my eyes it's still Major :( )
His browser history lately only contains the latest news about Captain America; if he’s been found yet, what the latest update on him is. People are describing him as a criminal now, but Peter knows that’s not who he is. Steve
“I know, but applying that term to me makes it sound like I’ve got a midlife crisis,” Tony mutters, mostly to himself. Of course, Steve would hear it!
“Oh, you don’t know? For now you’re Tony’s intern – which
The shock stopped right in time for her to dodge the thing, only making a cut in her arm instead of stabbing her heart.
“Morning,” she sounded a bit hoarse. Well, right, she always sounded hoarse. Freaking weird voice, man, Yaël still seemed to forget sometimes what her voice sounded like.
It’s Wednesday now, about a week since Peter called for the ambulance. Tony hasn’t gotten better at all, and even the doctors seem to agree that the encephalopathy seems to be getting worse as he’s getting disoriented all the time. May isn’t working now, and Peter is alone. Pepper had been here a little while back, but she and Happy had to leave again after only an hour. Vision came by as well, but he hadn’t said much. Rhodey is still there, though he's currently downstairs to get something to eat. Walking gets easier for him, so it seems, though he's still a bit shaky on his legs.
“I’m sorry, Steve!” Peter calls out after him. Steve shakes his head, but he doesn’t respond to it. Instead, he leans to the side, pressing his head against the wall while he tries to get over his hurt pride.
“Right, I’ll start up the Quinjet,” Natasha then says, running out of the room. May has her arms crossed, looking extremely uncomfortable around a whole bunch of superheroes ready for action. She has her eyes trained on Peter, observing him carefully.
“Right, uh… Do you have a car, maybe?” Peter asks, trying to get the conversation to go forward. Yaël moves away from the counter after that, revealing that she
“I don’t suppose you have children, Everett? In the end, Spider-Man is still a child, and what better way is there to learn a lesson? He’ll learn responsibility this way, and when he earns it, he’ll get his stuff back,” she says. Tony nods. This is really the best-case scenario he can get right now. If it had been Ross’ choice, Peter would have never swung another web in his life.
“I think it was alright,” he says. Wanda, too, agrees.
The call goes over. One ring, two. Three. Four. Then Steve picks up.
regret it when Tony introduces himself as Captain America’s
“I sent you some of our results on your tablet,” she says with a clear uneasy look on her face. Then her eyes rest on Steve for a few seconds before turning to Tony. “First analysis indicate a non-existent substance. So far, we’ve gathered nothing about it other than it seeming quite indestructible. They’re trying out a few things.”
Tony points towards the bottle of pills with a raised eyebrow.
Wow, his father carried an actual nuke in space. Not many teenagers can say that shit, right?
“Yeah, why not? I want to make sure you can still do it without crashing it,” Tony jokes, and Peter punches his arm in return. After that, he hurries to the driver’s seat and installs himself behind the wheel.
Sure, he was still a jackass most of the time, but after what happened, he started caring for the world around him. And Pepper never admitted how she was secretly glad that he shut down the weapons’ manufacturing. She wouldn’t, after he left her at that party. Sure, okay, Tony realized Obie had been doing some shady stuff and he had to ask beforehand, but was it really that hard to just let her know he wouldn’t be back?
“You just wait here, I’ll be home as soon as I can,” Steve counters. He puts his hand on Tony’s hips as he pulls him closer. “And then we can have lots and lots of hot and steamy sex, okay?”
“Indeed, it could have been much worse,” she says. “Imagine Tony would have kicked him out?”
“I would suggest maybe an awesome coffee machine? The guy likes his coffee…”
“She surely is a fighter,” Yaël said bitterly.
"Do as you please, it won't make me like you any less," Yaël shrugged. "Poor soul, so young and already in so much pain," Yaël whispered as her eyes followed Peters steps.
At the campus, people start noticing him. Going to parties makes him a familiar figure to most of the partygoers. They all constantly greet him, slapping him on the back or inviting him to the next get together they’re organizing. And Peter just accepts their invites without any trouble.
“Seriously, Dad, Pepper’s gonna kill you if you’re not there. It’s only a few hours, then we can watch this guy here on the TV, okay?”
“If you want a chance to bring your grades back up, you’re always welcome to apply for the internship. There’s still a few open slots for the time being, which you might get if you hurry,” Tony says, trying to change the turn in the conversation. The kid looks relieved for that.
Tony lets out a deep sigh. Then he turns around.
call away. I know, Dad, you already told me,” Peter assures him, giving him a smile. Tony, too, smiles back, though only slightly.
The beginning of the weekend means that he’s got two whole days to fill again. Sure, there’s homework to be done but that won’t take too long to make. In his bag, there’s also a list of internship-possibilities for him though he’ll probably look them over with his parents eventually. It’s not like there’s any rush for it, after all.
“Yes, can I help you, sir?” he asked politely, but Yaël saw him frown a bit. This boy had the worst poker face ever. Yaël hoped he’d be able to stay kind to Wade, otherwise he might get fired.
Steve’s face turns a bit red at that, the frown turns into a scowl. Oh, there’s fire in his eyes. Tony just loves to mess with his man like this.
But eventually, Tony takes pity on him. He clears his throat, getting Darcy’s attention.
He kisses him one last time. Then everything goes black.
Steve shrugs. “Sharon,” he says shortly. Had Tony been drinking, he would have spat it back out on Steve’s complete form.
There’s no news, from nowhere. It’s practically the middle of the night, so nobody he knows is still awake. And he’s too tired to head out. He should just sleep.
“Is he dying?” he asks, not knowing what he’s going to do if that’s true. He’ll probably just abandon ‘family’ once and for all and just go and live as a nomad through multiple countries. Tony can’t die, that wouldn’t be fair. Not when Peter only just got him in his life.
Greets,
“Have you heard from Stark?” Wanda asks the moment Peter catches up with her.
"Hi," he greets them. Tony doesn't respond, but Steve looks up and give him a smile.
Steve laughed a bit at her and reminded her about what had happened last night.
“What are
“Will everyone come back next time after I followed someone in this dream?”
- Panic Attacks
“Wha-?” he starts, but Gilette holds up her hand.
“Go,” she tells him, tears in her eyes. Peter nods, slowly letting go of her hands as he walks back into the light.
He does the usual. There’s a mugger on the streets, hoping that he wouldn’t be too obvious. There’s a police chase that he helps along, getting a thumb’s up from the officer when they get the criminal in custody. Allowing the cops to take a selfie with him, Peter hurries off to the next case he finds. He shouldn’t be too surprised when, in the end, he drops back down on the roof with nothing more to do.
Peter gives Tony a long, angry look. He has a nasty feeling in his stomach, his hands balling up into fists. His heart makes a few jumps, making him want to crawl out of his skin and shout out into the world.
“And what is this?” the man asks curiously, taking the two things in his hands and observing them deeply.
Instead, he steps into the elevator once it opens up for him, and he takes a deep breath. He doesn’t need to press the button for the ground floor, FRIDAY already doing it for him, instead. Peter looks at the ceiling with a thankful expression before stretching his arms a bit.
Of course, he doesn’t care about Toomes. The guy tried to kill Peter. That’s enough to be hated by Steve Rogers.
“Not really.” Peter sighs, coming to a stop against a building. “Do you mind passing along all the video-feeds of those patrols to my computer? So I could have a look at it?”
“Du wille elshje hem,”
In case anybody has idead for names for the story, shoot 'em my way! :-)
Steve noticed that Yaël had no answers, herself, so he asked her what she had been doing the whole year when she was gone and she told him everything. Yaël told him about the coma, about the tests, about the bullshit with Fury and her respect for X.
“How so?” Peter asks, immediately afraid that his plan will be for nothing.
“You loved her, didn’t you?” Peter asks, and Mr. Stark keeps his head down, instead downing his glass once more in one go. After that, he simply takes the bottle with him, and starts walking back towards the couch.
‘Happy birthday, Yaël’, she thought happily while licking her lips. She didn’t really care no one knew the date of her earth-birthday. On Helvegen, a birthday was celebrated by the start of a new decade. On that day, everyone came together and celebrated each other’s life with a big festival, which always ended with a big campfire and dancing. Of course, that way of celebrating a birthday had its charms too, but on earth, a birthday was more personal, about one person. Sometimes two, but never a whole kingdom.
“You’re kind of a creep, you know that?” Steve had muttered. Tony shrugged in return.
Peter looks at the camera footage, seeing a man around probably Tony’s age, though still appearing older than him. He looks sympathetic, clearly very eager to continue his work.
“Not so much. The people are insisting another wedding to make sure I am, but… You know that’s not really my thing.”
“He’ll be back, and you’ll be fine,” Peter assures him. Tony huffs out a small laugh.
“Yes,” he says then. People cheer, Steve jumps up from his seat and holds up his hands in a questioning gesture.
“No way, we’re taking you to medical!” Steve objects. “You know you need to have pictures taken!”
“Now give me your school schedule.”
“Actually, no,” Steve admitted. “It’s, uh, the Avengers.”
Tony then nods. “So you’re looking out for the little guy?” he asks. Peter frowns.
“Well, it surely isn’t as weird and awkward as I thought it was going to be,” Peter said while preparing his next spoon of ice.
“Fun for someone who can’t die, idiot.”
Tony is very pleased with Peter’s work. He tries hard, does his best, and shows much promise in everything that he does. Every time Tony thinks that he’s given him the impossible – well, impossible for a teenage kid or any ‘normal’ person but not for him – the kid keeps on proving him wrong by doing just that.
“The Starkbucks coffee machine, the remote controlled windowfilters and the soundless MRI-system, yes. All of which haven’t been the easiest to make, might I remind you,” Tony interjects.
He almost has a heart-attack when he sees the
“So, she has some drama of her own sometimes. Who knew? I thought she was barely human,” Peter mutters to himself.
Hesitantly, Steve gets up, his hand coming to rest on Tony’s shoulder to guide him up as well. May stays seated the longest, only getting up when Tony and Steve are almost through the door. They don’t go too far away, keeping the door open while they gather together in the hallway.
aware of it. The skin where Steve’s fingers are touching him is burning.
“Can I-“ Steve stops, clearing his throat before looking back up. “Can I kiss you? Just this once? To know what it’s like?”
He can’t really say what happened. After his latest argument with his dad, he figures he’s just had about enough of it; the constant accusations, the doubts, the lack of trust. He’s always tried his best to be a good son, but apparently it’s never enough. And he’s tired of it.
“Yes, you are,” Steve returns with a grin. His nose follows the path of the scar, coming up to his sternum until he gets to the other scar, the one that came from the arc reactor. Tony lets out another shaky breath, his project suddenly forgotten. The little device that had been projecting the hologram rolls off his chest.
In the couch, there’s Peter’s friend Yaël, looking like she’s completely out of the world. He shouldn’t be confused she’s here, since she’s been living here for the past few weeks. Despite that, he hasn’t been seeing much of her, given to the fact that he isn’t always in the compound.
“Correct,” he says, sticking out his tongue. Steve starts laughing at that.
And Tony? He decided to take a step back. Explained that he couldn’t do this anymore. Steve knew that he felt guilty about the whole Ultron-disaster, and he couldn’t really blame him. It was impossible to say Tony and Bruce weren’t responsible for it, but in the end, Steve felt like the entire team was in one way responsible.
“But he might be dying!” Steve counters. T’Challa then puts his hand on Steve’s shoulder, gently shaking him.
“Well, uh,” Peter mutters, a bit breathless while he swings around. “Have I been going on patrol during the nights often lately?”
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Simultaneously, the monitor next to him indicates that very same fact. The beeping becomes fast, notifying probably everybody at the nurse’s station. It goes on and on, until there’s a sudden crash. The sound is gone. He feels something on his back, aware of something he didn’t have before.
That was when Steve had started to think about what Stark had said on the helicarrier, that first day they met.
“Nothing much. Bruce and Tony have been trying to find out more about that meteor that destroyed the base,” Steve explains. “We’ve sent out some stuff to Princess Shuri and Dr. Richards as well, but even still the results are coming in slowly.”
Yaël couldn’t shake the feeling that Nilla knew things she wouldn’t tell, like she knew more about the Queen’s plans or…well, there were certainly things she kept to herself and Yaël needed to figure out what it was. Even if she had to do it all by herself.
“Hello to you, too,” Tony mutters out playfully. His legs are thrown over Steve’s, with a sketching book resting above them while Steve uses him as a table to draw around a bit. “How is my dear cousin of mine?”
After all, he shouldn’t have expected that everything that happened there would just magically fix whatever went wrong between him and MJ. He’s not delusional!
“Got the call in this morning – The Fantastic Four were planning on taking care of it but they asked for back-up about half an hour ago when he moved back to the tower,” Cap says, readjusting his helmet and taking a deep sigh before removing his shield from his back straps. Then he nods towards Peter. “Thanks for the lift, Spider-Man. Now make sure you stay out of trouble. Wouldn’t want you getting hurt.”
Peter is suspicious of something; Tony knows it. That has probably something to do with the fact that Tony keeps on staring at his son without really thinking about it. Each time Peter is looking away, working on whatever next Tony is going to add to this suit they’re making, the inventor takes a little time to once again take in what he has created without knowing it.
Flames shot around and rebounded from the glass. Within a second, Yaël had the feeling she turned the cage into an oven and she was getting baked in it. The smoke started to suffocate her as she tried to take the flames back.
Tony had been right there, had been running immediately behind Steve to get to Peter. They were
She nodded.
When he tries to confront
“Have you called Dr. Cho?”
it anymore, either. Having lost all control over his body in that time made him realize once more that he only did these things because it was kind of expected of him.
"Hey, Dad, what's this?" Peter asks, recognizing Tony's handwriting immediately. He takes the post-it and holds it up towards his father, who gives it a short look. Steve then takes it from Peter to inspect it as well.
“You clearly didn’t pay attention in Spanish class,” she says jokingly. “This is Italian.”
“They once were, in the real world, when you were really stuck in it. But this is a dream, remember that. You can manipulate it.” Yaël nodded. Yeah, he was probably right. The problem was, Yaël knew well enough that she wasn’t trained at all. Controlling her powers was a big challenge. But she had to try.
“Peter!”
“So you’ve mentioned…” Steve returns. “As long as you don’t pull any crap like that again!”
Yaël felt a bit nervous as she was standing in front of door, leading to the compound’s gymnasium/training room. Something flew passed right next to her ear as soon as she opened the door. With a shocked yelp, Yaël looked aside to see what it was. An arrow, stuck in the side of the door, was still wiggling from the speed it had been making.
“New game?” he asks Steve, who nods in agreement and puts his cards down as well. Clint, Scott and Sam groan.
“No but I mean they’re still on-“
Steve looks back up, seeing Tony giving him his ‘
Peter nods, glad she does remember.
"We're putting up
“Peter took a hit, he was far from dying, Tony,” Steve corrects him.
Fuck this, he’s just going. It’s not a date, after all. To be fair, the only reason he even started to get nervous around her at school is because of what he knows now. He just wishes sometimes she wouldn’t have said it to Spider-Man, because now Peter’s living with the truth. Has MJ noticed his nervousness, yet?
Of course, Steve’s friends will always be the same. Even during their free time, combat seems to be their top priority, especially being prepared for it.
“You are evil, you know that?”
she returns.
“How?”
“Yeah, I knew your mom very well when she was still a Valkyrie. You look a lot like her!” Yaël didn’t really know what to say, and stared at Hilde instead. “Oh, shit, did the alcohol break you? Should I go get a nurse?” Hilde jumped up. “You know, as you are Helvegian, I thought you’d be able to handle something strong, but-“
“You question my memory?” Thor asks with a frown. Steve drops the papers back on the desk and holds up his hands in defeat.
“FRIDAY?”
. Maybe not by blood, but he might as well be.”
“Stark Tower, please,” Peter tells the man, who then nods and starts up the meter. Peter looks outside, glad to see it’s a sunny day despite the rain that has been dropping down in the past week. Of course, the weather has not stopped him and MJ to just hang out once in a while. They went to the movies two days ago, and one evening they had some Chinese take-out and ate it in the living room of the apartment with Johnny who kind of invited himself along.
“I’m just- glad to have you here with me.”
“Damn it Peter, stay with me, you hear me?! Don’t you dare leave me! Just stay with me!”
“I, uh… I said something I shouldn’t have said to Tony, and he took it badly,” he muttered quietly after a little while. Okay, he wasn’t sleeping. Yaël nodded to sign that he should keep on talking. “You know about Harry, right?”
Hope you enjoy the chapter. Proof read by myself, so please point out anything I've missed. It's about 1:31 in here, I had an evening shift at the hospital, and I'm exhausted, so I might have missed a few things!
“Okay lover-boy, we’ll try and use that to track her down,” Tony deadpans.
He’s already met plenty of other people here, though. There’s MJ, a 28-year-old girl who studied for arts but ended up becoming a journalist instead, Ned, a geeky guy who seems to be just as enthused about heroes as Miles is, and Peter Parker. Now that last guy, he’s pretty much a mystery. First there’s the fact that he’s having this on-again-off-again relationship with MJ (and currently they’re on ‘on-again’, which’ll probably not last for too long). Next to that, Peter’s like super smart. He graduated from Empire State University with Biochemistry and even went to MIT for a bit, though what he did there Miles isn’t too sure about. Next to that, Peter has this strange talent of disappearing at the oddest of times, much to everybody’s annoyance.
Yaël was walking towards the bathroom as Steve stuck out his arm to stop her.
“HEY!” Tony complains. Steve points towards Peter when the engineer leans up. Peter just gives him a wave. “Peter? You’re back?”
“It’s just me,” he says with a wink. “Dad’s home?”
There’s some videos on the test he’s undergone. There’s a few therapy sessions, most of them containing Tony’s therapy-glasses (Peter refuses to call it BARF), and even a few where they test his strength. He’s not really surprised when he sees Harry hasn’t lost all the reflexes, as well as the strength he gained from being the Goblin. He’s not
“I would go… Fuck Cap, marry Iron man and kill… Jeesh I don’t know, the Hulk?”
“Yeah, it’s a shame we don’t know more,” Ned returns, feigning innocence. Harry just keeps on staring at MJ. It’s a bit weird to call her that after using Michelle all the time, but she’s been insisting on it for a little while.
About half an hour later, the door opens again to reveal a freshly showered Steve Rogers entering the room. The two on the couch don’t look up but only wave at him while they keep watching their tablet screens. Steve rolls his eyes when he sees them.
“I don’t know, I was in the shower, but when I came back there was a huge hole in the building. Vision’s really shaken, saying that Clint took her.
He doesn’t.
“What?! Excuse me, I never look horrible, I’m fabulous!” Yaël said fictitiously-insulted. It was sweet to hear that Steve was still bad with thinking through his words when he’s tired.
Oh, shit, right, the man still didn’t know Tony was Peter’s father. “Uh, just because, his internship, you know…” she tried saving herself. Luckily Steve was tired enough to just go with her flow.
Steve looks quiet, eyes checking out the photograph of himself with a man that used to be a friend. Even from this far, Tony can see that it’s signed, though what it says, he can’t read.
“He got knocked out during a fight, I couldn’t wake him up so I panicked,” he admits. Just two sighs coming up from the people with him. They’re clearly losing their patience. Tony doesn’t care.
Speaking of him, Peter quickly checks at his phone to see the time, finding that it’s almost three in the afternoon. His appointment with Mr. Stark is at five, meaning that he has two more hours to kill.
“Hmm, biology stuff? Way out of my league, sugar,” she says without looking up. Peter keeps on walking and she follows easily.
“Mr. Stark, sir, are you alright?” somebody asks. Tony nods and holds up his thumbs.
- Peter finds out some stuff he doesn't know how to deal with
“Yes, why?”
” Tony answers dryly. “
“He knew about it?” Bruce asks. Tony nods, putting a hand on his forehead while he tries to think. “Helen has one of the spiders. She said Peter gave it to her a few years back. She analyzed it and stored it somewhere afterwards.”
Karen returns. “
Bruce and T’Challa are deep in conversation about Vibranium. Johnny and Felicia are doing some sort of game with their hands. Tony is simply looking at his phone and typing down more stuff, probably secretly continuing his research on the black goo they’ve found.
“Mary knew, somehow,” he explains to her.
towards her. It had mostly been the side-effects of the meds, amplified by the alcohol… That combination really didn’t do anything good to him.
“I, uh… I’ve been having these aches in my stomach lately. And, uh… I’ve been throwing up a lot more recently. Maybe…?”
“Just wait on the couch, I’ll get ready,” Peter tells Mantis, who nods and looks a bit scared. To be fair, with those big eyes she always does. It can seriously mislead the enemies, Peter figures, since she’s actually kind of bad-ass when it comes to it.
of the Avengers coming after you. You understand?”
Tony smiles, giving him a light kiss on the lips before resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.
Giving Pepper the Rescue Suit was probably the best thing he could have done. Sure, the woman never really wanted
“He asked for you,” Steve says sternly. “He wants to see his dad.”
“It’s hard to forget that, sir.”
If there’s somewhere he can take a good look at this, it’s probably his Dad’s workshop.
I felt like it was necessary to show that, despite the fact that Harry's cured and so, it's not possible that Peter won't have any sort of reaction to it. With that, I suppose it would have been realistic if he would look up in Harry's eyes and suddenly see the Goblin in front of him. Besides, with the way Peter's body works, I'm sure he's not able to stay on the same medication for long. Eventually, his body will get used to the meds and work around it. He has to change quite regularly. He knows this, and he's aware of how to act in this situation.
“Let’s get you back home, okay?” Tony asks. Still looking down, Peter nods, tears now actually rolling from his eyes. Jesus, Tony doesn’t like how much the kid’s been crying in the past few months. This shouldn’t happen, he shouldn’t be this sad all the time. So he does what any father should do right now; he pulls him into his arms, and holds him in a strong hug.
“Sure you are, son,” Tony returns. When Peter reaches out to hug him, Tony indulges him without hesitation. “You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Never forget that, kiddo.”
“Can you maybe call Steve Rogers for me?” Peter starts. In the past few weeks, he’s seen a lot more of the man. They don’t talk a lot, but they’re friendly to each other and Steve always smiles at him. The reason for their limited contact is probably because he and Mr. Stark are practically avoiding each other, which Peter thinks sucks. He’d always thought Cap and Mr. Stark were very good friends.
Tony eventually returns. He hugs Bruce, kisses Pepper on the cheek and squeezes Happy’s shoulder. Then he greets Brunnhilde with a kiss on the fingers, which the woman seems to find a bit strange.
“But May-!”
Tony smirks. “We used to argue all the time, as well. I’m not sure when exactly we turned from that into friends.”
“Anyway, I was wondering if I could get a lift? Can you get us up there?” Peter nods, holding out his arm to allow the Captain to grab on.
“Tony? What’s going on?”
“I love you, okay? You heard it all when I was going nuts in the hospital. You know what I feel about you.”
“Some juice would be great, honey! Oh, do you have ice cubes?”
“And are you taking his last name?” Dr. Thatch asks. Peter shakes his head.
“You mean Happy?” he then asks. MJ frowns, and then shrugs again.
Right, patrol. He could use the distraction. Peter opens up his window and jumps out of it. With a wide grin on his face, Peter shoots out a web, pulling himself through the streets. Underneath him, he can see people waving at him. He makes a peace-sign and moves along without stopping.
Iron Man suddenly calls out, hovering above him with that same menacing mask as always. Peter looks up, shaking his head.
“Hi, Tony. You alright?” Natasha asks, pretending to be curious. Tony holds up a thumb while heading for the coffee machine.
Surprise, it’s a wedding!: The Stark-Parker-Rogers household receive an invitation to a very royal wedding.
Peter decides that the best way for him to tune the two out is by taking out his headphones and start playing some music. When he looks down on his phone to select a song, he notices a message.
Even now, he’s hunched forward until all he can see is his face.
“Heya, pal, I’m Johnny Storm, but you can call me Torch if you want,” the guy says out of the blue. Peter looks up, raising an eyebrow though the kid in front of him can’t see that.
“Anybody in here?” Cat asks the moment the flames keeping their way blocked are gone. She walks inside, her hands next to her body and ready to start throwing some punches if necessary.
“IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE AVENGERS WOULD HAVE GONE TO NEW ASGARD ANYWAY!”
“Ha-ha, very funny,” Tony counters while rolling his eyes. Peter sits up in his chair. Vision takes another portion and starts eating it again. Is it his third plate, now?
Raido’s eyes grew big. “Eh, I don’t know if I can do that, Yaël. He needs to get smuggled into the castle because he’s not from around here, everyone would notice. Well, where does he come from actually?”
- strong language? I dunno
Natasha remains quiet next to him. He’s thankful for that.
“That was a bit awkward,” Harry says once they’re all outside. Peter shrugs.
By the time he gets halfway through the fourth, though, something quite… strange happens. Peter shakes his head for a moment and rereads the page again, but then he finds that he’s read it correctly. His parents are together for about two years now, making it one more year before they get married. That little fact right there, though, is what’s making this next part so difficult to read, though.
“I’m fine. I just wanted to know if you are, Dad?” he tries. Tony’s eyes widen, mouth falls open. It’s as if Peter’s question comes out as the biggest shock in his life.
True, Peter had been quite sarcastic and dry himself for quite a while
Harry’s been with models, actresses… Peter can’t really believe a guy like Harry would suddenly fall head over heels with a random high school girl, after all.
The two nod, and quickly they set up a line. After that, Felicia runs towards the stairs where MJ is still looking at them. Peter feels a bit relieved when he sees her handing MJ a gun of sorts. After that, he returns back to the enemy. Venom seems pissed off now. That’s dangerous. A pissed off enemy is often unpredictable, able to do
“Wanda, you got any idea where she’s hiding?” Peter asks in a whisper, knowing that she’ll hear him. She’s given him a com-link after they’ve decided to partner up, so they communicate on their own channel.
“Good, then do something about it,” he says with a wink before turning back to the movie. Or rather, he pulls out his cellphone and starts showing stuff to Yaël, who seems to have lost interest in the movie as well.
“I need some air. The roof will do.” FRIDAY doesn’t protest after that, instead starting up the elevator and bringing him up to a floor that’s not even selectable with the buttons. The only way to get there is probably with FRIDAY.
“You really need to watch your language, otherwise Steve will wash your mouth with soap,” he jokes. While Tony freezes on the spot, Rhodey just bursts out laughing.
“Okay, are you now quoting the intro of Pulp Fiction? Girl, stop being way cooler when you’re drunk. You just wait here, I’ll fix you a ride home, okay?” Wade said after he put her back down as soon as they were outside.
And something stung inside of Steve. He couldn’t really explain it, it was just there. Just… Suddenly looking back at Tony, and that feeling got even stronger.
“I can handle him,” she then says, grinning back up to Hilde. Eventually she, too, stands up. That’s Tony’s cue to round things up at last. He tries to get back on his feet before he realizes that Steve has fallen asleep against his chest.
“And that work will still be there in the morning.” Steve pulled on Tony’s chair, getting him away from the desk.
His throat wells up when his dad’s favorite car crashes against the tree. He blinks when a dark figure – with a familiar metal arm – comes into the image. He’s aware of Steve looking at him instead of the video. He doesn’t care.
The elevator nears the floor they need to reach.
Steve rolled his eyes, turning towards Sam who just shrugged after making a full sweep of the territory. A dead end, then. Alright, it was only their first lead after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smirks slightly, squeezing Tony’s hand again and then lifting it up towards his lips.
“MJ,” Peter breathes out. She runs towards him, kneeling down to check him over.
Thor takes the hammer over from her again, and the wind emerging from Jane disappears just as quickly as it came. Her hair darkens again, though looking wild anyway. She looks a bit out of breath, suddenly giggling.
Mantis hesitates for only a few seconds more before she moves into action. Helping Felicia out of the suit and into Peter’s clothes, she guides her through the apartment and helps her down. Peter watches out the window as they get into a taxi and drive off. It must be a weird evening for the driver, since there’s an actual member of the Guardians of the Galaxy in their car.
Everybody stares at the bottle in confusion, clearly wondering what that has to do with it. For a moment, Tony wonders how much they know about Peter’s situation. They probably know he takes things for the depression, but they’ve never really discussed the other parts, haven’t they?
see the answer inside Tony’s head, neither of them has thought to ask me,” Wanda says with a playful grin on her face. Natasha and Vision give her a long look before bursting out laughing.
it,” Mr. Stark suddenly says, laughing a bit before walking back towards Peter and holding out his hand. “Now, get up. I want to see what you’ve done with it.”
FRIDAY answers. Peter throws his head back and groans. Then he grabs his papers together and throws them into his bag along with the arc reactor. He’ll take care of that the next time he sees Mr. Stark at the Facility.
- Harry gets himself a girlfriend
“JUST STAY PUT AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE!” Peter shouts after him. If it’s a showdown Venom wants, then it’s a showdown he’ll get.
“I don’t- I don’t feel well,” he admits before grabbing his stuff and hurrying out of the class to find himself a small, secluded spot where he can get back to his senses. After hiding in the boy’s restroom, he locks himself up in a little stall and dials down Tony’s number. He knows he shouldn’t disturb him with this stupid business, but it’s not like he can call Steve now.
Chapter warnings:
“How do you-?”
that Extremis could be the key in this, but not
“He remembers you well enough,” Yaël jokes. “But I’ll spare you from holding him. I swear I might get bald with how much he likes to pull hair.”
Steve arrives even earlier than FRIDAY had predicted. When Peter hears the doors from the elevator ‘ping’ again, he turns around to see the Captain walk out, looking angry and scared at the same time. The moment he sees Peter standing there, he runs up to him.
Steve frowns; he recognizes that voice. Isn’t that…
Tony escapes from the medical floor exactly at noon, after they’ve served him his lunch. Tony finishes the plate, put it all down on the nightstand, and then takes his crutches and hurries into the hallway. The nurses are busy, there are no doctors, and there’s nobody there to stop him. He’s too good at his, anyway. The amount of times he’s escaped from medical in the past are countless.
“Until Fury decided that she could be a part of the team, instead. You know, with Thor back in space, he probably figured the team could use another alien. Everybody agreed, but I just- I never really trusted her. To be honest; she scared me, okay?”
“Lopt, it’s pretty damn hot in here.” Yaël looked at her other self and saw a drip of sweat roll over her chalk-white cheek. She looked miserable!
“Well, it’s not a fun story.”
“I’m sorry, but he’s fully booked for today. Do you have an appointment?” the man asks. The smile only falters a little, as if the guy actually feels sorry for him. Peter only shakes his head and looks to the side. A woman in a black dress and blonde hair is talking to the redheaded girl, and then both get to the elevator. Despite her mean attitude, Peter wishes her well.
Went to see Black Panther at last! Lots of inspiration, now just to find a way to bring all the ideas in!
“Ah, well, only trying to do my duty, ma’am,” Steve jokes, giving her a wink. May laughs again, and for a moment, Peter is reminded of a time where May used to have a crush on Captain America. If only her past self could see her now, joking along with the man while also dating one of his colleagues.
In the elevator Peter looks at his phone, wondering if he should let MJ know where he is. There could be no trouble in that, right? It might be better for someone sober to know of his whereabouts. He quickly texts her a small message before putting the phone away.
And Peter turns to look at Gwen, letting out a long breath.
Deciding not to open it just yet, Peter puts his phone aside and closes his eyes, sleep catching him almost immediately.
“Well, my first guess would have been that you’re showing symptoms of a spider bite. The muscle pain, the difficulty of breathing, sweating, headache and all the other stuff, it’s very normal after particular spider-bites.”
Peter rolls his eyes. He walks up to her and gives her cheek a short kiss. Rhodey looks at him with a grin on his face and a raised eyebrow. Peter waves him off, not liking the look he’s getting there. At least the shower helped him with his headache. It did nothing for the feeling in his stomach, though.
The door eventually opens again. Steve, still in his prison uniform, walks in at last. His hands are still tied together behind his back, and they haven’t shaven off the beard or the hair for the occasion. He takes a few seconds to observe his surroundings, but then finally moves forward when one of the security guards assigned to follow him from New York pokes him in the back.
“Good evening, Peter,” a voice suddenly says. Peter jumps up, not at all having noticed that somebody was already sitting on the second couch. It’s the same one as the first but a bit smaller, meant for two people instead of three.
“What’s this about?” she asks curiously, picking three small strands of hair and starting up the braiding process, pulling James’ head back a little to get a better view of her work.
That’s not a bird.
“So the mission was a bust?”
“Peter Parker! How about that! It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” Francis asks. The man had been Peter’s mentor for a while back when he first started his internship at Stark Industries. After getting into Tony’s radar, though, he started working at the Compound instead of the tower, thus getting Tony as a mentor instead – which had been the plan all along.
“No,” he said out of the blue. “I’m not better than you, we’re equals.”
As she walked, she started thinking about Jason. Not that she wanted to, but now that she had the space and rest, he just popped up in her mind again. He had a few character traits similar to Loki, that’s true. But he wasn’t Loki at all and those traits weren’t all that bad.
“Well, I guess you are a big reason why they work so well together, then,” she offers. Peter quickly shakes his head.
“Okay, if not Tony, I still can’t just leave Peter alone right now,” he suggests.
Without words, he carefully pulled her out of her clothes. When Yaël fiddled with the bandages to get them off, she noticed he was staring at her. She looked up.
“Kind of,” Ned jokes along. Peter rolls his eyes.
“I don’t like getting objectified.” Yaël muttered, also frowning.
It’s seven past six in the morning. Another minute goes by as Tony stares at the clock in front of him. The bed is cold, or at least colder than it should be. The lack of a person breathing next to him is disturbing, making him feel even more lonely than ever before.
"Flash mobs. The Kardashian zombie horde. Anything with the word 'social media' attached."
Breathing out shakily, the blond shouldered through the doorway on autopilot and ducked into the bathroom. He was hoping to make a quick getaway, hoping to buy himself a few minutes to recover from his new shock and form a battle plan, but he’d never been that lucky.
Yes, Peter randomly told Steve he's Spider-Man.
Oh, crap, is Tony going to get in trouble for heading there?
“I want to make you my Queen. I want to be your proud husband, the father of our no doubt wonderful child. I want to be by your side at every moment possible because I find so much joy in just standing near you. Your passion for science, your Midgardian ways… From day one, when you hit me with that car of yours, I felt a strong pull towards you. And it’s probably crazy to do this, but I do not care, for I love you with everything my heart possesses, and I will love you until the very last moment I get to have you, and beyond.”
Right, Tony said earlier that he would prepare a bedroom for Peter at the tower – not at the compound, since, according to him, it’s not really a safe place to stay at (probably with the fact that they've got Harry locked up there somewhere). To add to that, Tony also seems to have decided to move back, reclaiming his penthouse on the top floor.
Yaël mumbled some curses as she turned back to her starting position. Hey, wait a minute... "Steve, do you want me to burn you or something? What's your purpose here?" she asked with a grin, but she'd never put him on fire.
“You’re crazy,” Peter tells her. The girl shrugs and walks back towards the edge of the roof.
“Auw!” James complains.
“Are you sure?” Tony asks. “Your sister once told me it could be dangerous?”
“I’m coming!” Tony then calls out. He wishes his reflection luck before heading towards the living room, where he finds Steve seated on the couch with one spot left for him. Tony doesn’t hesitate, sitting down on the couch and leaning his head against Steve’s shoulder. Steve, in turn, rests his head on top of Tony’s, and together the two watch the happenings of the world. Of course, it never gets better. Every day there’s another drama out there. But, finally, Tony’s able to say that he officially can no longer do anything about it. Retired and resting, that’s what he’s supposed to be. There’s a new Iron Man around there (though it’s actually a girl and she goes with the name
“Listen, I can’t get you into SHIELD. You’re too recognizable.” Steve rubs his forehead again while he tries to think. “But… we could use Iron Man, perhaps.”
“Tony, can you stop joking about this? You could have died! Can you just imagine how Steve would have reacted?”
“No.”
Of course, Steve felt insecure about it. This was not how he was raised, or not how he was brainwashed by the church or whatever. She was sure about the good morality coming from Catholicism, but the love-part was one of the church’s biggest flaws, according to her.
“Come on, don’t faint,” she mumbled to herself while blinking to get the blurriness away. Were those meteorites flying passed the windows or was she hallucinating?
Yaël stayed and had dinner with the Thompsons, she felt more welcome than ever. But they had always had the talent for making her feel welcome. They didn’t ask her to show off her powers or anything, they just let her be who she was and accepted her that way. Hopefully Scott knew how lucky he was with grandparents like this.
Tony leaned back against the railing, folding his arms across his chest and making a show of looking Steve up and down in a way that made his face heat and his spine tingle. “Hi, Steve,” he drawled. “Nice to meet you.”
“There’s nothing wrong with me!”
“I’m just saying, don’t come on too strong. You… Do that sometimes.”
“You know it.” Steve squeezed his hands against Tony’s skin. “But still. It was temporary. You’ve been just like…
“Okay, that was admittedly a pretty big initial lapse of judgement --,”
“Yeah.” And then, taking Steve completely by surprise, Tony took him by the elbow, flipping off Bucky and Steve and Jim over his shoulder as he steered Steve across the room and out onto the balcony, the noise of the party fading in the cool night air. There was nobody else out there and Tony beamed as he leaned against the railing, looking Steve over. “So tell me, future husband,” and he was teasing, but it felt more like they were sharing a joke than Tony laughing at him. “You gotta name?”
