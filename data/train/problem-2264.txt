“Is that where your wife died?” Karen asked
“AC/DC t-shirt with the sleeves torn off, Brenden, the marathon runner…. Ever heard one of Tommy Tiernan’s stand-up routines” Mycroft smiled.
Willa dropped the gun and ran over to Irene, using what little bedding there was to try and stem the bleeding.
Perhaps they should go visit. John watched as the others started to leave, Karen gave him another small hug and headed out. Diane looked down at John then knelt beside him.
“I have very early memories. I remember mummy being sick when carrying the sprog, not wanting to play with me. Sherlock and Mycroft and Daddy always taking Mummy because the sprog was making her sick. Then she was born. And it didn’t stop. All Sherlock wanted to do was play with that stupid dog and look after Willa. Willa was born and Sherlock got a puppy, Mycroft got a new recipe book, and I got a doll. A doll. A boring plain old doll. Mummy said I could learn how to care for a baby with it. Ugg. I didn’t want to look after the drooling thing.”
It's why Brodie accompanied them now instead of their former assistants Monty and Raquel. The enablers as Mycroft called them.
Eurus laughed as she took of the blonde wig and the leg brace and stretched.
Elijah stood and took a few of his action figures over to the table in the corner of the cell.
“You always work late on Wednesday’s” Sherlock said “And I forgot and had Molly come and start dinner early. I hope it’s still alright.”
It turned out everyone in there had lost someone in those attacks. John just looked down at his hands, so many lives lost because of Moran coming after him and Sherlock.
I hope you are all still here and I hope no one is too upset with the OFC, she just sort of happened.
“Oh?” John inquired
“The doctors say he will sleep the night. You needn’t stay.” Sherlock said looking up at the two.
“It’s not something I am at liberty to say. It goes beyond just family.” Mycroft said “It delves now into government secrets.”
“He going to be alright?” Lestrade asked
“You’re welcome Greg; I figured you’d need a ride back to your car anyway.” She smiled as the two headed to the parking lot. “Are they going to be ok?”
“She’s very patient, and gentle” a familiar voice said.
“Do I get to come along?” A voice said from the floor.
"I'll hold the wound you go to your husband," Lestrade said. Marisol Nodded and Greg firmly placed his hands on Willa's wound. Willa winced. "Sorry"
“If I called him Greg he would probably keel over from shock. I admit at first it was because I couldn’t be bothered to learn his name. Now it’s a game. He gets annoyed but I called him Greg the other day and he practically pouted. I will admit though I am running out of names that begin with a G” Sherlock looked up at John who smiled and gave a laugh.
"Medical personnel is on its way. Can she be moved, would it be better to lay her on the catwalk?" The man asked
He carefully reached up and felt the slats as they went over his head and met at a bar that ran over his mouth, the smaller metal plate protruded into his mouth and sat on top of his tongue. A Scold's bridle is what is was called sometimes called a witch's bridle, a medieval torture device meant as a punishment for shrews or scolds; women of the lower classes whose speech was deemed "riotous" or "troublesome"; by preventing such "gossips or scolds" from speaking.
He sluggishly lifted his head to look himself over.
“I need to tell you, you have every right to know. I know so much about your past but I have barely scratched the surface of my life, my past.” John said reaching up and holding Sherlock’s hand. He lifted it off his shoulder and kissed it.
Greg nodded as Albert left him alone in the Garden with Mycroft.
He’d really messed it up this time, but the truth couldn’t be known, Sherlock could not know about Willa. If he did it would all unravel and he would start asking about Eurus and that was a path Mycroft did not want to go down.
Sherlock sat by John’s bed, the bridle was off and his tongue was still sore these four days later. His shoulder was in a sling, he had been lucky, the bullet only cracked the head of his humerus and so just a sling and no surgery was needed.
“Oh that’s wonderful!” Greg smiled as he stood and hugged Molly. “Congratulations” He said shaking Brodie’s hand before hugging him.
He settled in nicely and he liked his coworkers well enough. Then two months ago he met Molly and while he always liked coming to work. Having her there made him LOVE coming to work.
He heard Willa speaking, he looked up and saw the flames, the house was engulfed, there was no way he could even try to get in and get her.
“For now, we give them space to heal.”
Willa had no answer for that. She never told Ashton about the gifts from the agency, the affairs. She wanted to; he was never supposed to be more than a fling, not something going on a year, now it was too far along, how would she tell him? She had so many one night stands. She'd tried to stop but after trying to kick her addiction to the drugs Victor and Raquel had always supplied, the other addiction started, the need for well not love, not sex, but just someone there with her, so she wasn't alone at night.
She looked out at the garden below, the grave yard they played in as kids, all the wrong dates, a joke of the architects. They should all be waking soon. Then the fun could begin.
“Ok Greg, I’m Paul you just take it easy” he calmly said as he began checking Greg over. “Is this Moran the one who shot you?”
Mrs. Hudson said he blamed himself, but all knew the truth that is wasn’t the case.
“Not all games can be won.” Eurus said.
Mummy Holmes reached up and dabbed a tear away from Sherlock’s eye.
Greg gently pressed his lips against Mycroft’s “Please don’t every push me away again.” Greg said
Sebastian tried to move away but his body wouldn’t listen.
“I can’t.” Willa said crying “Please don’t make me.” She sobbed “Shock me I don’t care. Kill me I don’t care.”
=-=-=-=
“I never let anyone close for fear that my job would endanger them as much as it endangers me” Mycroft said eyes reddening. “Never thought it would be family that hurt him”
“As do you.” Riley smiled “You were just as busy as we were and you had to stay later to check post-op.”
“She lives downstairs, my guess is she is dead too, elderly lady surviving a blast like that is highly unlikely” John said pushing himself to a standing position.
Marisol screamed and Willa cringed as the bullet hit the edge of the gap and ricocheted. Willa let out a gasp. As another shot rang off. Marisol looked up to see Victor pitch sideways onto the runway. She turned to look at Willa.
“Where were they keeping you?” John asked looking up at Anthea.
“I will explain later right now Greg had a heart attack and we need to assess the damage and see if we can stabilize him till we can get out of here.” John said as he looked thought the supply cupboards.
John got dressed and followed them out.
“33 degrees and not a cloud in Floridian sky according to this weather app.” John said looking at his mobile phone as he exited the bed room. He had the day off he and Sherlock were working on a case Dimmock brought them while Rosie napped.
“You flatter me and my two left feet” John smiled again.
“Lunch is ready.” He announced as he placed the tray on the table. Mrs. Hudson smiled as she entered with another tray.
“Me, I’m alright, healing.” Molly said “I’m sorry to be an intrusion on your family”
“I don’t Know” Lestrade replied before the elevator shook violently and began to drop
“Oh you met him already.” Eurus said as the monitor went split screen to show the young boy alone in a room playing with blocks.
Once they were all settled the meal began.
John nodded. She was right, Sherlock had always been so distant; he kept people at an arm’s length not letting anyone get too close or be fully with him. John figured he was scared of letting someone in only to lose them, like he had lost his dog Redbeard when he was younger. Sherlock had been teased and made fun of growing up. He didn’t make friends easily with people. Yet he had fallen in love with John.
“She knew she wouldn’t make it” Mrs. Hudson said coming into view, she had Rosie in her arms. “Her last words to John were for you and he to raise the child together”
Sherlock looked up at the tree in front of him. It was lopsidedly decorated and a little slanted but it was perfect, the kids had loaded up the bottom with most of the decorations they had bought while the adults were left to hang the heavier ones up top causing a slight droop of the branches on the tree’s left. Mycroft was a little off put at the non-symmetrical look of it but Sherlock thought it was perfect.
Eurus removed the pillow and looked at Sebastian’s face. The petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes was quite apparent. Eurus smiled
“Deal,” Sherlock said clearing his table. Lestrade entered and set the files on the waiting table.
Molly was still close to her own parents and made a mental note that she would have to introduce them to the Holmes’s. They would get along famously.
Mary groaned as the building shook. John got up and looked outside, several large garbage trucks were making their way down the street. They all seemed to be loaded with bags of what looked like sand.
“You’re remembering.” Mycroft replied. “After the disappearance of Redbeard she set fire to our ancestral home, Musgrave Hall. Uncle Rudy took her away. You had a small breakdown. Thy sent you away for a summer to get help. Soon you forgot about her. Rewrote you memories and she was gone. Uncle Rudy felt it was best not to upset your delicate mental stability so when Willa who was never supposed to wake, did wake, he made the call to hide her from all of us, told mum, dad and I that she had finally slipped away. We all attended the funeral and I can still hear your sobs. You had lost your best friend and sister.”
Sherlock motioned that he wanted to ride with him as he tried to regain his feet.
“10 it’s a tank they can’t go anywhere” Mycroft answered
“Don’t rush into anything; you and the kids can stay as long as you need,” Carol said standing. She collected the cups and kissed Greg’s forehead. “And if I ever hear from my daughter again I am going to ream her out.”
Sorry for the delay in posting. work has been hectic and I haven't had a lot of writing or editing time.
Greg was in the bed next to Mycroft. He was on a ventilator; the bullet had torn though his stomach causing a lot of damage that thankfully had all been fixed. He’d broken his hip as well, that had been surgically repaired and splinted as well, and there was extensive damage as he had walked on it after it was broken. Adrenaline could do that though. His eyes were bruises as was his nose; Anthea said he had a pretty nasty concussion as well.
“A Study in Pink” McLaughlin spoke up breaking the silence. “First the blind banker now this.”
“For how long?” Sherlock said looking John over.
Sherlock nodded. “In the Morning, we’ll ask Mrs. Hudson to take Rosie for a little while.”
“It appeared he is wearing a set of Sorcerer’s Apprentice Mickey ears.Greg is wearing what looks like an Indiana Jones fedora with Mickey ears.” John smiled.
“For now,” Moriarty said with a giggle.
“I look forward to it” Brodie smiled “Are you off at 5 today?”
“Yes, Sir!” Sholto replied saluting. He took another look at the mess the explosive left and headed to round up the rest of the private security firm.
“Yes” Mycroft answered “and you were both still young.”
“I’m not mad at you for what happened. I’m mad you weren’t upfront with us. No one can blame you or Sherlock or any of your friends for the actions of another person.” Mindy said as she returned to her seat. “But you should have been open with us.”
“Hello Sebby.” He said his Irish accent and voice were beautiful in Sebastian’s ears.
“You should tell Sebastian now, don’t leave him to find out later, after” Irene started
“His bedroom or hospital?” Lestrade asked
“John?”
She turned and left.
“Thank you but I’m fine” John said with a small smile
But now all who took him away from him were going to die, Molly and Lestrade already were and he got the bonus of another police officer. Next was Mycroft Holmes and then the end game, Sherlock Holmes.
Rosie calmly slept in her carrier. The venue had been wonderful and had set aside a play room for guests with kids and a little nap area for the really small ones. They even provided a certified nanny.
The building or rather what was left of it, that housed the pathology unit of St. Bart’s came into view.
“For you my love, I would do anything” Mycroft smiled.
Sherlock gently poured the water over John’s head rinsing the suds from his hair. John had been released from the hospital in the morning. He was quiet and still so weak. He trembled when he stood and would lean on Sherlock for support while walking. Sherlock had drawn a bath for John and now sat behind him in the tub gently washing his hair.
“I hope your mom makes the cake, that chocolate cherry one she makes is divine,” John said taking Riley’s hand as they entered one of the private skyping booths the American USO had set up there.
"Hey, when in the mood, you should see how much Sherlock can eat." Willa smiled as she looked over at his brother, he gave a small shiver that went unnoticed by the two doctors. Sherlock had run out of his stash and was starting to come down. Hopefully, sleep would help. Normally a good sleep chased off his withdrawal sickness.
Mycroft smiled at John using our, for the bedroom, he knew they were going slowly but he was also still expecting that happy announcement soon.
“No John, You and Sherlock, take care of her” Mary said she reached across and put her hand under her arm.
Sebastian smiled. Jim would have been so proud.
Riley missed the Two Canadian Doctors they’d had when he and John began their tour. They were funny and always made a rough day bearable. But they had only been on loan till the new arrivals took over and had gone back to Camp Nathan Smith in Kandahar.
“NO!” Greg yelled out “You bastard, you mother-fucking bastard” Greg tried to get up but was only met with a sharp pain in his stomach. He looked down to see the blood starting to spread across his stomach.
“The Black Lotus Tong is back?!” John said sitting down on the couch. “I though Mycroft said it would be a cold day in hell before they could get a foothold in London again.”
Sherlock linked arms with Anthea and they followed the newlyweds down the aisle. John and Molly followed behind, John now carrying Rosie who was trying to chew her bracelet.
“Thank you.” John smiled and Elijah snored, Mycroft yawned
“Oh they’ve all gone” She said looking around “Well more biscuits for you.” She smiled setting the tray down. She pulled the blanket up over Mary then left.
Mummy took and deep breath and moved to sit on the edge of his bed. She held his hand tight in hers.
“We don’t really know.” John replied before catching Anthea up on everything that had happened.
John gives Sherlock’s hair one more scruff with the towel, then moves around the couch and settles down beside him. “Rosie, show Sherlock the animal sounds.” John picks up the remote and turns the telly on low.
“Forty.”
John wasn’t sure where his train of thought was taking him. Once Angelo left, he pressed on, “She likes you. She’s still texting you, after all these years. Why not give it a go with her?”
And hundreds of other moments were flooding his head. The best man speech. The moment on the wedding dance floor. Sherlock shooting Magnussen. John being Sherlock’s pressure point.
“Of course I remember.”
“Will take a while to dry those clothes,” John murmurs. “Best stay here for the night. This is the most content Rosie has been all day, so you’re not allowed to leave.”
This was… not good. Not even Mummy had shown such pure, honest, exposed grief or emotion on his behalf, ever. She’d always been kept from the worst of it by Mycroft. But this… this was the first time he’d ever hurt someone and had their pain thrown in his face, unable to hide from it, unable to ignore it or wish it away.
John turned to kiss Sherlock’s ear, and Sherlock’s arms tightened around him. After several moments, he pulled back, leaning down to plant a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s parted lips. Knees hurting from so much kneeling, John sat back on his heels while Sherlock straightened up in his chair. Both of John’s hands were grasped in each of Sherlock’s, resting on his knees.
Sherlock was texting furiously, frowning at his phone. He looked up as John approached and put his phone away.
After a while, when their laughs were muffled and exhaled through their noses and around their grinning kisses, John pulled back a bit, his hand on Sherlock’s neck, foreheads pressed together again. “You know, that first night at Angelo’s, I really was trying to figure you out. See whether you might be interested.”
Why would John be avoiding Sherlock, if not in reaction to having wrapped himself around his flatmate in his sleep?
“More like an eternity,” muttered Sherlock as Angelo bustled over. The proprietor's face broke into an enormous grin when he saw them.
And on and on it went. By the time John arrives home with two bags of takeaway, he’s laughing at the text Sherlock had just sent about Mycroft’s sleeping habits, and when they sit down in their respective chairs, eating Pad Thai out of the box and arguing over the benefits of sleeping on the back versus on the side, John’s laugh-crinkled eyes remain firmly locked with Sherlock’s.
Twenty minutes later, they were lazing in their respective chairs across from each other, a fire crackling in the grate, wine simmering warmly in their bellies. Each held a small measure of whiskey in their glasses, relaxed in their seats, enjoying the warmth and the quiet and the company.
Sherlock lets out a laugh… a full-bellied, relieved laugh.
“Sherlock!” he’d exclaim. “Is that you?! Is that really you?” He might give Sherlock a light shove, but part of Sherlock expected to feel John’s strong hands clamp down on his shoulders, squeezing briefly before maybe being pulled into a hug. “Where have you been, you mad bastard?” he’d demand, thumping his back with his fist, like he’d done that one time they’d encountered the American soldier he’d served with and greeted as an old friend.
Something in Sherlock’s face flickered. He pressed his lips together, as if he didn’t want to say.
And John would marvel and shake his head slowly, awed and amazed and so happy to be back, and ready to begin their work again.
Angelo returned with a candle, which he placed reverently in the center of the table, and set two wine glasses before Sherlock and John. Once he’d filled their glasses and took their orders, John lifted his glass. “Happy birthday,” he toasted.
Nothing about today has been predictable. Sherlock remained in the living room all day, lying on the sofa, creating nasty smells and annoying noises with his experiments in the kitchen, going through emails and pronouncing them all “boring!”. That was normal.
The hand tremor. Visible even from across the cemetery. Visible to one pair of eyes.
Sherlock bites his lip.
“Christ, I hadn’t realized the time,” John said, checking his watch. “I told the sitter I’d be out till midnight.”
The buzzing of Sherlock’s phone nearly gives him a heart attack as he is wrenched out of his Mind Palace. He is vaguely aware that he’s been in his mind palace for about an hour before all thoughts flee when he sees it’s John texting him.
Sherlock watched him silently, half his face in darkness, the other cast in the golden glow of the fire, impassive and expressionless. Just watching. Listening.
Sherlock doesn’t realize he’s grinning until it starts to make his cheeks ache. He slumps down on the sofa, gazing at the soft glow of his phone before it beeps again.
reason, I trust you. Even though you’ve lied just as much as Mary.”
“Janine not one for physical affection, was she?”
“Hmm.” John picked up his fork and shoveled a great pile of penne into his mouth. “Could have just said so earlier. Saved yourself the interrogation.” He was suddenly
“I’m not!”
“Mm.” John took another, longer sip of his wine. He nearly finished the glass before putting it down. The familiar burn threatened in his stomach, and he felt his mood take a precarious yet small drop. A whisper of the feelings that had overwhelmed him every night for the past several weeks tickled the back of his mind. The burn of whiskey in his esophagus, the numbing of all senses except pain, the feeling of sinking in quicksand with nothing to grab onto… all were held back by the tiniest string.
Sherlock freezes again. Has he revealed too much?
“It’s all fine,” John agreed, and for a moment, the two of them grinned at each other like idiots. John leaned down. “Good night, Sherlock.” He placed his right hand against Sherlock’s cheek and kissed him.
I had this idea while rewatching The Empty Hearse: How did Sherlock imagine his reunion with John would go? He seemed naively excited, so I wanted to explore what he may have been expecting.
“And how did she react?”
His mouth parted in sudden clarity.
“Lovers,” Sherlock scoffs. After a moment, his eyes fly open. “Is that what you’re afraid of? That we would now be classified as lovers?”
“It was the guilt,” he admitted. “I couldn’t sleep for the guilt.”
“Huh,” John said, twisting his mouth. “Why don’t we save that one for later, and you tell me how you secured a free pass to Angelo’s for life.”
Mummy cries when she sees her little girl, no longer little, yet just as fragile. True to Mycroft’s words, Eurus is unresponsive. Unreachable. A body with no soul. No eye contact, no movements, no signs of life.
The first time Sherlock visits Sherrinford voluntarily, he is with his parents and Mycroft.
“Not bloody likely.” John gave his hands a squeeze, prompting an involuntary smile from Sherlock. “Just… slow, yeah? I want… I want to do this. God, I want it.”
Sherlock chuckled, and began tucking in as well.
“I knew it, I knew it.” Sherlock said it like it was something that has been in the back of his head for years that he’d forgotten about. He took John’s hands, holding them in both his own, and kissing them with what John felt was unbelievable tenderness. He looked up at John, through open, soft eyes. “Good shot.”
John felt the blood drain from his face.
John sighed contentedly, and turned to meet Sherlock’s stare. “What?”
“No boyfriends until forty. And they’ll all have to be vetted by both of us and Mycroft.”
“I was faking with Janine,” Sherlock scowls.
“Going for a pint with Greg,” he called over his shoulder while practically fleeing down the steps, and Sherlock had to suppress the urge to launch off the couch after him. Where had that urge come from? Sherlock settles back on the couch, fingertips together against his lips, and thinks.
“If it’s not good,” John said gently, “you can delete. And I’ll drink the memory away tonight so that tomorrow morning, we can continue as we are.”
A moment later, his phone buzzed.
“What about you?”
John just watches him, patient as ever.
“I’ve wanted to do that…” Sherlock breathed, “for so long, John.”
was fun. It was a would-be serial killer, and Angelo was the wrong suspect. That part’s all boring. No no, the actual case itself was wonderful!” And Sherlock regaled the tale to John while the candle glowed lower, through one more glass of wine each while Angelo boxed up their leftover food, and the outside grew dark and one by one the restaurant patrons all started leaving, until a particularly loud laughing fit made John realize that they were one of the few people left dining.
“With Mary,” John clarified, looking at his glass, twinkling with each flicker of the flames. “The guilt of cheating, even if it was just texting. What kind of man cheats when he’s just become a father? But then I’d rationalize with ‘What kind of person lies about her entire life to her husband’? I’d tell myself my lies were minor, compared to hers.”
“God no. I’m merely wondering.
Sherlock sat in his chair, tense, chest high as if holding his breath, mouth slightly open, eyes glassy.
John grinned at the memory.
He’s soaking wet before he feels his phone vibrating continuously in his pocket. When he pulls it out, he sees a series of texts he just now receives, as his phone gains reception again.
Without realizing it, he took a step forward, out from the trees. Then another. Another. Twigs cracked beneath his shoes. Part of him was doing it on purpose. He was always good at sneaking up on suspects. But the voice in his head, the one that had changed without him realizing, no longer cold and clipped and scornful, but instead gentle yet firm, kind yet unwavering, teasing yet affectionate, told him sneaking up on a grieving John Watson would be more than a Bit Not Good.
“I loved her,” he said quietly. “I did. But I shouldn’t have been married to her. But then I wouldn’t have Rosie. So it couldn’t have been a mistake. It just…”
“Hmm, more like fifty-seven by now, isn’t it?”
“Sorry about that. Sitter was late,” John explained, sliding into his seat against the window.
Sherlock freezes, mouth open, ready to retort. After a moment, John looks up from his laptop and smiles at him.
Once he’d hailed a cab and was on his way home, John pulled out his phone.
You can't tell me this didn't happen.
“How long ago was that?” John asked, when he could finally catch his breath enough to take a cleansing sip of water.
And Sherlock would explain while they walked… yes, walked, Sherlock needed to feel the streets of London beneath his feet, needed to hear John’s steps beside him… to the Chinese restaurant they’d frequented after their first case… that ridiculous Study in Pink. He’d tell John all about his adventures and travels, and John would ask the perfect questions to highlight how brilliant Sherlock had been, and he’d say so. He’d call Sherlock “brilliant” and “amazing” and “fantastic” and “spectacular”, and scarf down his dinner while Sherlock stole his sesame chicken when John paused to question him.
“Yes, but I’d got snot and tears all over your dressing gown, and the next day Rosie vomited all over you. So I’m celebrating until one day goes by where your dressing gown isn’t ruined by a Watson.”
The warmth of John’s hand lays on Sherlock’s forehead, smoothing the hair back in soft, small, repetitive motions that make Sherlock swallow hard and keep his eyes closed, breathing through the burning in his nose.
Knees not thanking him, John slowly got to his feet, still holding Sherlock’s hands. “I do have to go right now. I promised the sitter I’d be back by midnight. God, I’d stay, otherwise.”
Inside, John takes Sherlock’s coat and pushes him upstairs into the spare bedroom with a change of clothes. John’s clothes are, of course, too short, but his slippers are fluffy, and when Sherlock comes back downstairs, wrapped in John’s biggest, warmest jumper, longest tracksuit pants, and roomiest dressing gown, he feels the muscles in his back and shoulders loosen.
Sherlock’s lips quirked, and he broke the gaze to look down at his menu. “Pinot Noir while we decide?”
“You… you… you fucking… bloody… goddamn… arsehole… wanker… tit… mother…..”
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded, eyes boring into John’s. “Anything, John.”
“Are you okay?”
Something painfully soft presses against Sherlock’s forehead for a moment, and he tightens his own lips, afraid their trembling will give him away.
"The one in Milan was the last," Willa replied. "I can stop. I have Ashton I don't need anyone else."
Someone would have to find her, though the voices in the corridor were not exactly what she was hoping to hear.
“OK” Greg replied, knowing he would take the tray back to the kitchen when he was done. Even after all this time living with Mycroft, Greg still wasn’t used to be waited on.
Willa looked at the gun in her hand and then up at the camera.
Eurus fumed, he wasn’t supposed to calm, he wasn’t supposed to have time to focus. All John and Willa’s distracting her allowed him to have the time.
“Your boyfriend is British Government you know more than you are saying.” Sebastian said cocking the gun
A second government operative and a paramedic came to stand before him as the landlady and baby were led out.
“That was a sorry for blowing up in your face I am under extreme stress grunt” John said, Dimmock just nodded and the two headed their separate ways.
“And where’s you landlady? I hear she’s a real firecracker” Sebastian replied looking around.
Greg took hold of each side of the opening and pulled. The doors gave way opening up the 5
She disappeared for a year after Sherlock saved her from the beheading. Then turning up in Greece as a hotel owner. There were the sales records, most listed her as primary owner but listed a Richard Brook as the financer. Greg turned the page and his eyebrows raised. There was a hospital record, not only for one Irene Rochelle Adler but one for a child, Elijah William Adler. There was a document listing the father as James Aloysius Moriarty, but a second one had been issued a year ago listing father as unknown and Irene still as the mother.  There was a statement with the birth certificate change, looked like a Greek police report, someone had translated. In it Irene said she had been forced to have a child with Moriarty. She never wanted children but Moriarty wanted a legacy, an heir to his throne of criminality. He didn’t force himself on her but rather paid for the IVF treatment and paid all her medical expenses.
Judy was already on her mobile calling for an ambulance.
The others had long since gone home. Sherlock just couldn’t help but smile. They had gone through so much but now life was steady, and Sherlock felt settled and safe, Baker Street had always been his house, a comfort zone, but now with John and Rosie, it finally felt like a home.
Sebastian had been planning revenge since the day Sherlock made that leap off the building.
“I am listening in too.” Eurus said the three stopped “Don’t fret, Sherlock is nearby. But he has a very hard decision to make. He needs to solve my riddle, to save you, but the more time he takes to solve it the less chance he has of saving you all. And did I mention he has to do all this without uttering a word. I know how he loves to talk so I have taken precautions to make sure he remains silent.” Eurus gave a chuckle.
Molly shut her eyes. How could she be so stupid, she told herself there was no more getting scared, not everyone was someone looking to get to Sherlock though her. Brodie came highly recommended to the lab; he socialized well with others and he was perfect. He made her feel good, she was relaxed around him and if she misspoke he didn’t make her feel super awkward. She could run off at the mouth and say the wrong thing and he would just smile and add his own little jokes that made everything better.
“Dad, why are you in hospital wear?” Liz asked wiping her eyes.
What was going on?
“Who’s gone?” He asked.
The water started rising further, John was starting to float, soon he would float up, the chain would reach its length and he would start to drown.
Sherlock took John’s hand in his.
Great she thought, going to have to go through a few rounds of shots and tests after this. Preliminary tests showed the corpse of one Arturo Ballston didn’t have any communicable diseases but still, the treat of infection and such. The autopsy table, thank god had remained bolted to the floor so was now probably down somewhere around reception and the receiving bay. The floor under here seemed to be holding up, even if there was no floor under her legs.
“Or a case for Sherlock?” Brodie smiled
The hound wasn’t real, not really.
“Solve my riddle Sherlock, the answer is in the song” She gave a smile as she watched Sherlock stumble around the shipping crate they had used to bring them and everything here the cameras to watch them, the tools of destruction. Oh how it had dragged in the air, weighing down the helicopter. Eurus had been a tad worried it would affect their flight time and their passengers would wake too soon. But now it served as the perfect holding facility for Sherlock. If he solved her puzzle she would let him out. “Once you solve it I will give you the code to open that lock on your little holding room”
I needed another lie for Mycroft to tell and that is what I came up with.
“At first I just stayed on the streets. I would sleep in the rugby equipment shed. Shower in the locker room and do my laundry in the custodian’s room. It was a custodian who discovered me at the end of fall term. I was making a meal in the school kitchen. He took me to the headmaster who took me to the police station who took me to child services who put me in foster care.” John said setting the tea down and holding his hands in front of him. “I thought it would be better. I had a room, it was warm. I had food on the table, and they didn’t beat me. But I still had no one. I didn’t know where Harry was. The family was nice enough but they had taken in a lot of kids and never really stat with any of us. So I was merely just existing. I saw Harry again at the trial. My Father was arrested for killing my mother. I guess with Harry and I both out of the house her had no one else to beat and one night he went to far, she fell and died. Harry and I were both brought into the trial as witnesses against our father. I was 17, nearly 18. The trial was so long drawn out over the year. I wasn’t able to take my first option year for playing rugby for Loughborough, which was fine. I had a lot of time to think while held up in that hotel room. Once the trial was over I walked down to the recruitment office and spoke to an officer. Told him what I wanted to do. Be a doctor and be a soldier. They were more than happy to help. I signed up. Did my basic then was sent to King College and did my medical training there. My final years and internship was at St. Bart’s. I worked at a VA hospital for a bit. Then the war broke out. And I shipped out. My first tour in Afghanistan I was in the Helmand province. I was at a more rear base. The worst of the worst were brought to us. There was me, Riley Sutter, Francis Altman and Judith Warner. We were the doctors. Only Riley and I had full military training. Francis and Judith were civilian doctors who were recruited to work far from the front lines. Riley and I were under the command of Major Sholto whom you have met. The three of us were close. Sholto was like a father to me. When Riley and I got close he looked the other way. As long as we brought him back treats when on leave. Fine whiskey, porn, cigars, and other trinkets from Asia and Australia he took care of us. And we helped him get women, clean women. And we all took care of each other. There were others too but Riley and I were his favorites. We did three tours together. The final one being a front of base, front line hospital an hour and a half outside Kandahar. Think M*A*S*H but with no hijinks and no stoppage in the flow of wounded.” John closed his eyes and squeezed the arm of the chair tight.
“About two hours” Sebastian replied reaching up and running his hand over the long lean torso in front of him. “Are you hungry?”
“I thought I had lost you” Mycroft replied voice trembling.
The others just nodded
Deep down below the old beech tree.
The twins took their spot to line up Marisol behind them.
Sherlock took a moment to consider it and then smiled
Greg and Mycroft stood behind the door leading into the main reception area. Greg softly kissed Mycroft’s neck.
“Yes” Mycroft replied.
“Oh I can get you going quick” Mycroft replied as the two made their way inside and upstairs.
“Yes he is alive, and he will heal. It’s just going to take a while” Daddy Holmes
“The explosive device, I’ve not seen anything like it.” Anthea said as she studied the wall of debris I watched it come through the floor like it burrowed”
"how long will you be deployed?" Willa asked as they started taxiing, Sherlock just dozed in his seat.
“Heart rate elevated. Has he ever had panic or anxiety attacks?” The paramedic asked
Sebastian tried to scream at the paramedic but nothing came out of his mouth, his voice wasn’t cooperating. He tried to push himself up but nothing was listening.
“Leave her.” Eurus said over the intercom. “I was trying to give her a swift painless death but now because you are too stupid to do it right she will have to suffer.”
“I wanted to play I just didn’t want to play the childish games Sherlock insisted on playing because you were too stupid to play the one I wanted to play.” Eurus snapped.
some lines taken directly from The Final Problem.
“Don’t force yourself to stay if you feel overwhelmed.” Sherlock said “Diane said you could leave at any time, so don’t feel obligated to stay if it’s making things worse”
John closed his eyes and leaned against Sherlock’s chest. The warmth of the bath water and the softness of Sherlock’s chest made John feel secure.
Victor nodded.
“Not sure sir” Dalton said
Sherlock’s discovery of not one but two sisters that had been hidden away from him since a tragic incident in childhood, then the lockdown in the parking lot of Mycroft’s office, the singing and the smell, then darkness, darkness with fitful nightmares. John dreamed of being back on the battlefield, about being in the midst of chaos and his life unraveling, of Riley going down then himself getting shot. He dreamed of watching Sherlock jump off of St. Bart’s then sitting over him when he had been shot. He dreamed of the explosion and Mary dying in front of him while he sat by helpless, Rosie beside them in Mrs. Hudson’s arms. He dreamed it all over once more, then it all went wonky, Sherlock shot on the battlefield, Mary jumping off of the roof, and Riley dying in the bombed out flat.
John was jarred awake by the banging and the shouting. Something was happening outside. He threw on his boots and followed his other bunk mates including Riley outside.
John pulled off his boots and laid back. He had already showered, but the heat was immense even in the early hours of the day. The barracks weren’t bad there was a cooling system, but still, the sun could really pound through the windows. John should have really pulled the flap shut before he laid down, oh well, too comfy to move. Riley would do it when he returned.
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to.” Sherlock said. “If you aren’t ready.”
“They’ll heal. I know where the well is.” She said leaning on Sherlock, She was shaking. “I’ll be fine. Tuck and roll. Works wonders.”
“There’s a whole squad of armed men standing outside just on Carlton House, sort of where our wall used to be” Anthea reported
“Now let me take care of you” He said washing off his hands.
There were Riley, John and Conrad Davidson were the British doctors, there was Esben Christensen, Isabelle Jeppesen, and Alvilda Frandsen from Denmark. From the United States, there was Grant Foster, Benjamin Harting, and Louis Marpel.  There were also many nurses from the three countries and more from other allied nations working out of the base.
“I want to keep you safe” Mycroft said
Never would, Andrew and Elizabeth were too close to their father. Not that Greg was boastful about that or had done anything overly special. He just made sure he was there for them. No matter what, school function or sports event, didn’t matter how bad work was he always tried to make it there on time, or close too. He’d missed a few, but compared to their mother who was never there, it made a difference.
Mary woke “Who are you talking to John?”
“No, I don’t, I felt the same way when my ex-husband walked out. I like you had my suspicions but didn’t know how to react. So when he left, it was like a huge burden off of me.” Carol said “And you were smart, all your money from when you played tied up in saving’s accounts for when the kids turn 21. She can’t get that, I know she compline to me, that’s how I found out about the affairs.”
“He’s in the large oak tree by the bluffs” Will a spoke up. “I can see him out the window”
“I would like to be Black Panther and Wonder Woman. They are my favorite” Willa said picking up the figures. “And who are we battling?”
John balled his fist up tightly and locked eyes with Sebastian.
"You are going down Victor. My brother will put you away for a very long time." Willa said moving in front of Marisol.
“I was actually sort of hoping you would be here. It’s always nice to see a friendly face.” Judy smiled as she sat “Are you still waiting for your friend this week”
Greg and Mycroft just nodded.
“You back to not calling Greg, Greg?” John asked with a quizzical look.
“And yet I have no memory of her.” Sherlock said
Eurus’s voice said into the speaker.
John’s mouth moved he was trying to talk but instead choked again.
“If you want to save him yes. Solve the riddles and he lives. Remember don’t get too fancy don’t get too complicated.” Eurus answered. “Let’s start with an easy one. What is harder to catch the faster you run?”
Agent Keinfeld’s body rolled onto her legs she shifted her weight to roll him onto the ground which allowed her to stand, the area was still smoky and the smell of the explosives lingered. The entrance way was blocked by debris and she could see the unmistakable arm of Agent Weatherson sticking out from the rubble. She gingerly moved her bleeding arm, the pain was not too bad, and she could move her wrist and all her fingers, she could move all her fingers on her other arm too just didn’t want to because of the pain.
He looked worse than Sherlock on a drug binge, and the harder he tried to fix it the worse he got.
Molly smiled. He had worked in Afghanistan, maybe he knew John. There were a lot of soldiers there, but Brodie had been in the medical field, perhaps they ran into each other. Sher would ask John. Not now but eventually. John was still dealing with so much, to bring up the war again may not be the best.
"Yes, we do. It's only polite." Willa smiled as the four buckled in take-off. Body dozed in his own seat already buckled in.
“That’s, that’s not all.” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes and entered his mind palace. “There’s something else you aren’t saying.”
“You’re, you’re a Holmes?” Sebastian said trying to pull his hand away but she gripped it tight.
(See the end of the chapter for
Soon the honeymoon would be over. Back to work. Greg would be delving head first into now being the official Detective Chief Inspector, the acting was removed just before the wedding. Mycroft would be back to dealing with the stresses and dangers of politics. At least they would be going through this together.
John just nodded and broke away from Karen, the meeting was winding down.
Riley entered with the X-rays.
Sorry for the long delay. Work, life, mostly work got in the way.
“John, I don’t think the blood is supposed to be coming from under her arm” Mrs. Hudson, said as Mary gasped for air again.
“I think it would get a chuckle.” Mycroft replied just before Greg firmly planted his lips on Mycroft’s and pulled the man closer. Mycroft moved his had up behind Greg’s head and held him close. “I did drive out here myself so when your cousin and family return we could head home.”
“There’s a guy from the police waiting outside. He was wondering about Willa.” Robbie said pointing to the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Was there something he wasn’t doing that he should? Was there something he was doing that he shouldn’t?
“How, you can’t even get out of your own handcuffs” Eurus gave a small laugh.
Greg stood in front and softly knocked.
“Don’t worry Moriarty and I had a plan in motion already, but now it will have to wait, they need to heal for it for to be really fun” Eurus smiled
He tried the emergency button on the elevator console, but it wasn’t working. That’s when he decided to get the doors open.
Now Mycroft wondered what life would have been like if he had defied Uncle Rudy, if Willa had been welcomed back into the Holmes home. Would Sherlock have gone down that dark path? Would they have still become entangled in that deadly game with Moriarty?
Was it the most medically sound and scientific way? No, but it was something they had each done for each other over the years. Slender frames and the poor nutrition made them slender and each had had joint issues for a long time. Ribs being the most common to pop as the rib cage was the most abused part of their body from corsets to bondage to just generally tight fitting clothes.
Mycroft’s smirk fell and he looked at Greg back in the other room, sort of flopped into his chair.
The man nodded and went to get the trucks moving.
“She seems nice” Daddy Holmes spoke up. Mummy just smiled.
Mycroft tried to get up and then tried to search his jacket.
For nearly a year the world believed that Jim was Richard Brook and innocent man killed by Sherlock Holmes. Then the papers started changing the story and Jim/Richard was simply referred to as Moriarty, they barely used his given name. Newspapers praised Sherlock, and continued to mourn his death. There had been no outpouring of grief, no public mourning of Jimmy, even as Richard, just a notation he was dead.
“I am due to start physio in the morning one of the first things they will do is move he to a fully sitting position this will be easier for everyone involved if it is done using the chair. So since the aides are already here and they are trained to move patients like me, they can do it while they are here.” Sherlock said.
“You are getting awful lippy Myc, Should I zap Greg again?” Eurus coldly replied.
“Hello Gregory” He said he kissed his hand again.
“Hello, Jimmy” Sebastian replied “I feel a little underdressed” He made a gesture to Jim’s suit that seemed to fit him like a glove.
“Yeah when I first tried out my Mum wanted me to be one, figured it was safer, but I excelled at being an attacking midfielder” Greg smiled as he started bouncing the ball off his knees and chest, like he was juggling it.
The footsteps up the stairs were slow. Not for dramatic effect but rather just a person trying to navigate what was left of the staircase.
Brodie’s back was broken, and his spinal cord severed. He spent a month in hospital then another two in rehab. He hit a low spot during that time. But after meeting with some great therapists he pulled himself back up.
“You haven’t solved the puzzle yet Sherlock; Maybe Elijah will be the only life you save. Wilhelmina is gone; John does not have much longer.”
"I'll be fine." He replied as makeup artists came over to cover the bruises.
The voices were speaking again, still in German. She heard her name, Sherlock’s and something about the MET.
“Oh the DCI is awake, Hello Gregory. I can’t believe my brother finally found a goldfish he wanted to keep.” Eurus gave an eerie smile. “Sherlock and Mycroft are safe, for now.”
“I want you to officially adopt Rosie. I want you and I listed as her fathers. I want her name to be Rosamund Alice Martha Watson-Holmes” John said moving and resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “ And I would like to be John Hamish Watson-Holmes.”
Sherlock was heading to the bluff, rescuing a child first how quaint. Eurus exited the shed and headed towards the house. A few more matches added to the other side would speed up the process.
Carol met Greg them at the door. She got the kids settled then sat with Greg in the kitchen. They talked over a pot of tea. Carol asked if Greg knew why she barely spoke to her daughter yet never hesitated to call Greg or his grandkids. Greg had no clue. Carol revealed that Margaret was having multiple affairs. Carol had been horrified. Margret knew that is was her father’s affairs that had split up her parents and had upset the family.

Sherlock looked down at the now yawning Rosie, he and John would have a lot of that in their future probably. Rosie even a 4 months, almost 5 months of age was already showing her father’s determination. She was already trying to grab the spoon from them and feed herself and she when having tummy time on the floors she was trying to pull herself up, not to crawl but to stand.
He hoped to get the blood off his jacket and pants, the shirt he would probably just toss out. He watched as a dark haired woman stopped at the room at the end of the hall before heading over to him.
“Sir, there has been some movement in 221. We have watched no one has come out and per your orders we have not gone in.” The man said
“We always land on our feet.” John said leaning in and kissing Sherlock.
She needed to hurt them more.
“Have call, Mycroft, Holmes” Greg said as the Paul put pressure on the wound in his stomach. “Have to warn. Going to Carlton House Terrace”
Greg sat.
“I need it” Mycroft said trying to get up. He paused and looked down at his legs. “They didn’t take as much as I thought they would” He said before he drifted to sleep again
Willa changed her headband as the dressers practically tore the outfit off of her before starting to sew her into the final look of the night.
“Of course, and you should see her, she looks like you” Sherlock said as Mummy brought the little one over.
John wiped his eyes. He hadn’t been back to Mary’s grave since her funeral. He hadn’t even looked at a picture of her. They had plenty. He and Sherlock made a vow to have Rosie know who her mother was. Not fully but she would know she had a mother who loved her dearly even before she met her, mother who started a new life for her, a caring loving mother.
Molly stopped talking an bit her lip, there she was again spouting off at the mouth making things worse.
“I proposed to Riley over a soldier we were stitching back together. A nurse asked what we were planning on doing after the war. I replied I don’t know, get married. Riley answered only if he could wear the dress.” John gave a soft laugh as tears formed in his eyes “Sholto was on his week away leave in Kabul. Drinks, smokes and women week he called it. We got a call to move out. There was wounded and they needed full field medical. Riley and I suited up and headed out. We packed up 23 soldiers for transport. Mostly lost limbs and shrapnel wounds from the IEDs the convoy hit. We were just finishing up, tagging the dead for their own transport, when the ambush happened. A group of Taliban led by a few former British and American military men who had gone bad.”
There was a dial tone and then the sound of dialing over the speaker.
“My wife is dead and all I can think about is now I can finally tell you the truth.” John whispered.
Sherlock smiled.
“Hello Sebastian” She said, the voice, it was the one from the phone. “I am afraid you failed. They are all going to live, they will take a long time to heal but Gregory, Mycroft, Molly, John, Sherlock, even Mrs. Hudson and Anthea all will live.”
“Move the door out to half-way down the hall so it encompasses the upstairs room into the entire flat” Sherlock said “The upper room, John’s old room will be Rosie’s room”
“Afternoon Sherlock.” John smiled
Moriarty and Moran hopped into the near buy security van and sped off out of the base as behind him Sholto heard a sickening boom. He looked back to see D’Helley, or rather what was left of his upper torso against another truck. He’d grabbed a nearby sandbag to try and defuse the blast. It may have worked if had been quicker. The sandbag protected his upper half while the powerful homemade device effectively removed his lower half, a few men from near the rec area lay on the ground. Medical personnel rushed in.
John just nodded. Sholto watched as John extracted the bullet from the fleshy part of his calf.
Mycroft giggled “I saw the video.”
“No Sherlock, you’re still playing favorites” the corners of Eurus’s lips curled up as she starred in to camera.
Greg struggled to open his eyes then keep them open as the footsteps got closer.
“Oh, sorry” John quietly said looking down “I, guess I’m not that good of a doctor, can’t recognize my own head injury and couldn’t save my wife”
John looked over at Sherlock. That would make sense, lace the heroin with the luminol. That would mean that the victims were moving heroin already in the needle.. That from what John remembers from a prior case meant drug parties. Ones that were held for the sole purpose of getting high. The host would lay out drug as ready to use, cocaine already in lines, injectable in their needle, and so on.
John kept up just barely but understood what Sherlock was saying. “What did he say about me?”
John went through his Valentines and finished with Sherlocks that was nothing but
John slowly started to fall asleep, his gut and mind telling him that he is nervous beyond belief, but his heart is whispering that it will be okay because this is Sherlock and Sherlock will always be worth it.
Well, if not boyfriends then lovers because apparently John couldn't admit it aloud.
Far to the left, past the fireplace is a corridor that they are led through, John only glanced at the other two passages breaking off from the room to wonder where they lead. John considered what it would be like just to wander the mansion, but also concluded that he would get lost.Thinking on it further, he wouldn't be surprised if he wandered into a library and pulled out a book that revealed a secret door that could very possibly trap him inside. Another reason why the Manor feels eerie.
Yes, John does, and leave it to Sherlock to see right through him. Even in the dark, when only half their faces are illuminated in the moonlight.
“You did not
From that point on, John and Sherlock have been meeting at lunch in the library. Neither of them really saying much on the topic. When one doesn't have any homework to do, the other would help (or at least try to, after all Sherlock doesn't exactly need someone to help him.) When neither of them had homework, they would sit and eat together-well, John would eat and scold Sherlock for not doing the same.
John did just that.
“Nuvole Bianche, Ludovico Einaudi.” Sherlock filled in immediately. “The first piece I ever learned.”
“Because at Baker Street you never do. But here, you probably just wanted to tell whoever it was to shut it. Given your earlier assumption that I
John folded the paper in half and put it in the stack with the others, a satisfied smile curled on his lips. Come Valentines Day, Sherlock will get a delivery in one of his classes from his anonymous Valentine.
John is gay no question but he hasn't exactly come out yet. John wondered if Sherlock felt this way as well. There has never been any indication that Sherlock is interested in anyone ever. Not even John.
at the blog then you would know that they are two completely separate crimes and were misjudged by the police in thinking they were connected based on their close proximity.” Sherlock corrected her.
Sherlock must’ve picked up on it. Of course he would pick up on it. “I’m here, John. I’m not going anywhere anymore.” He said in a surprisingly gentle voice.
But it’s Sherlock, and that is the only justification he needs nowadays.
“You said it, Sherlock doesn't want me here. And now that you’re here the problem is solved. Have a good evening Doctor Watson.” Mycroft left the room, letting the door close behind him.
"You think we can man a ship this large with just the two of us?" John questioned, taking in the main mass and all the ropes.
With a swift swipe of Sherlocks hand, a large item flew off the table and hit the cabinet, falling to the floor, and taking some black goo with it. Sherlock started mumbling about distractions and false information when John suddenly realized it was a blowtorch Sherlock flung from the countertop.
“Evening gentlemen.” Mycroft greets as he walks into their flat, uninvited. John had just been typing up their most recent case on the website and Sherlock had been in their kitchen doing god knows what.
"Oh no you don't," John says. "I still need you."
The awkward silence was broken shortly after. “Harriet, there is no need to antagonize your brother.” Their mother stated.
I flop onto the deck with John falling beside me. The rain has eased up and the clouds have thinned, but only just.
John scowled. Of course Sherlock is right. He is always right. Johns parents are good-hearted and completely loving. It isn't a surprise that they invited he and Sherlock for a family lunch. They just have to know the brilliant man that John is constantly blogging about.
"Are you—do you have a—areyouinterestedinmen?" He quickly spits out in a jumble.
“Can we get to the subject at hand, please?” John threw in before anyone else could make an immature comment.
“Shut up, Freak.” Sally Donovan said from two tables over. “Nobody asked you.”
John narrowed his eyes. "What are you thinking?"
Sherlock sighed, and tried not to cringe at the pain it caused his stomach. “Yes, John.” He shut his eyes as if he could fake sleeping so John would stop speaking.
John thought about this. “Yes,” He said. “but maybe I don't mind so much anymore.” He couldn't believe the words coming out of his mouth, but he was even more surprised at the utter truth behind them. All this time, John was in the dark with himself. Little did he know that he just wasn't ready to accept it.
“I am. Might I say you have a very intelligent wife.” John blinked. What-
"You three, back in line," I demanded and they did as they are told. I walked towards the ship, pulling a struggling John with me and dragged him aboard. I kicked away the gangplank and forced John to cut away the ropes tethering the ship to port. Not quickly enough the wind caught the sails and slowly pulled the ship away from the edge. The entire time I kept an eye on the other men kneeling and watching us sail away. Once a fair amount of yards from them, I sheathed my gun and went to the helm at the back of the ship.
without question.
I'm falling.
“I agree.” Earnest cuts in. “Tell us how your relationship is going.” She leans forward on her hands and stares directly at John and Sherlock. John frowns, and Sherlock shifts uncomfortably.
“No.” John answered, a slight chuckle falling with the word (or was it a withheld sob)? “Definitely a bit not good.” John smiled down at his friend, who smiled faintly back.
It was the most ridiculous thing John has ever read in his life, and if he had to be honest, it quite offended him. How dare Moriarty taint his friendship with Sherlock by making it out as a joke? Certainly he is a smart-enough man to know they were nothing more than friends… right?
“Johnny?” Sherlock questioned, looking at John and not the overly-enthusiastic blonde girl.
John looks baffled. "How could it—oh never mind," he brushes it off and goes back to eating.
John kept his eyes on the house as he walked, ignoring any thoughts he may have about Sherlock and focusing on the task at hand. The house is quiet, no signs of life are indicated. No outside lights are on, nor the inside, but that could be because Sherlock and his ridiculous knocking terrified them into remaining invisible.
“I didn't recognize the piece.”
call or describe a Holmes as
John could hear Harry giggling in the background, he wanted to glare at her but she and Clara had turned and went back inside; just as their mother called them in for lunch. John was about to follow, pondering why Sherlock is so excited about honeybees, but got caught up in his father speaking.
"Oh stop it, you're embarrassing yourself." I shook my head. "You're
This is definitely strange behavior for the both of them. But perhaps not so much, this right here is John on the inside and Sherlock is more than welcoming of it. He is holding the broken and damaged wreck of a man in his arms and is completely and utterly accepting. Because this is who John is, shattered on the inside and defensive on the outside. Always putting up walls for anyone who comes near him, because really nobody needed to see the inside when all they would get is scraps of a broken solider and a neglected child. No one deserved to see it; it is too much of a burden.
Hello I hope I haven’t alienated anyone with the original character. It just sort of happened while writing. She started off as a male but then I felt it worked to have another female so there had been that balance two male Holmes two female and then loosing that other half. I hope you stick with me thought the duration of this story line.
“You’re lying, I’ve been learning to read your tells.” John said moving closer.

He sealed the letter in an envelope marked “For when I am in London”. He looked down at the stack of paper again began writing this letter was harder this letter held more truth then Jim had ever told in his life. When he was done he sealed it in a second envelope this one mark “For when I am gone”. Jim stood and headed to the main office of the hotel.
“More than enough” Mycroft said. They had already discussed the guest list and while Mycroft would have every right to go big with all his contacts that should be invited. They decided the wedding would be small and then later they would hold a reception and invite all the dignitaries and contacts that would not be at the wedding.
Victor and Sherlock both looked at the government agent.
The clock was just about to strike midnight when the screams woke the room.
It was calm and beautiful. He looked over at Sebastian sleeping in bed. He looked so peaceful when he slept, so calm.
2011. Sherlock was deeply immersed in a case, and so deep inside his mind palace that even when Greg poked him in the nose, at my suggestion, he did not rouse. I offered to help Greg. I had worked a few things on my own when Sherlock sent me here and there for what he called minor cases, doesn’t leave the flat for anything less than a seven as he has said many times. Greg though this was a minor case but just needed a second look. So off to Croydon I went. To the other Detectives on the case it seemed like a simple murder. Man invites younger man over for drinks, younger man learns of older man’s fortune; younger man kills older man and burns his corpse in the back yard. Case closed. But Greg had a feeling, a deep gut feeling that something wasn’t right. For one, the younger man had some physical ailments that seemed to hinder him from basic movements let alone swinging a golf club to murder any one, no matter of age or health. Greg wanted me to make sure the younger man was not faking his illness. I examined him and found him to be in the mid stages of muscular degeneration, he would be in a wheelchair by years end. The other detectives were still unconvinced and so they took me to the crime scene. It looked like a horror movie with all the blood splattered and sprayed everywhere. Hand prints on the walls smearing it. I asked if they sent the blood to the lab to be tested to see if it indeed was the older man’s blood. They had not as the man’s housekeeper said she heard the screams and saw the younger man sneaking off over the hedge as the body burned in the back yard. Having examined the younger man I knew there was no way this man could sneak let alone over a hedge that was seven feet high. I started to examine the blood when Greg appeared beside me. He asked me is old blood was supposed to be that red and shiny and glistening. It was this fact along with the younger man’s disability that made Greg want to intervene on the case; his gut was telling him something wasn’t right. I touched the blood and its consistency was odd, when I sniffed it, it was sweet smelling not the coppery scent normally associated with blood. Against my better judgement I liked my fingers. I think Anderson went to the ginnel to throw up. But what I had on my tongue was stage blood. Armature created stage blood. There was the sweetness of the golden corn syrup, and the light maple tasted from the maple syrup, and an odd addition of a strawberry flavor that I would later learn came from the strawberry flavored food colouring that was used to tint it. The other detectives were astounded. Greg gave them a calm yet harsh talk about following the evidence and not jumping to conclusions. I felt the need to add about seeing beyond the surface, how they saw but did not observe. I got quiet deadly looks for my effort but it was worth it. Greg and I walked the house looking for anything else we could. I asked if Molly had examined the body yet and was told that there was nothing but ash left. Greg asked how long it had been between the burning body was discovered and the fire arriving. We were told it was a matter of mere minutes as the fire station was just down the street. Greg asked me if this was enough time for a body to completely burn. It was not. This led to when Greg made a discovery that helped break the case. We searched the house for more clues and evidence. The floors in the upstairs hallway seemed hollow. When we walked on them they seemed different. So I stayed upstairs while he went to the lower level, when he knocked it was about three feet away from me. The downstairs hall was a good three feet shorter than the upstairs hallway. Greg went outside and stood studying the house before us. That is when he took out his lighter and started a small branch on fire. The other officers naturally freaked out but Greg shushed them and held the burning branch up to the small vent like opening in the attached shed. A few minutes later a man comes running out to put out the fine. Lo and behold this was our “murdered” man. He was taken back for questioning and it turned out to be an elaborate scheme to both get revenge on the child of a former love interest and pull and insurance scam. Greg’s gut feeling about a case, his sense for real justice, saved a man.” John paused a looked up. Greg smiled he was proud of that case, the younger man was still doing well, in the wheelchair as John predicted, but doing well. Sherlock looked on shocked; he had missed out on an amazing case and on witnessing Anderson throw up at a crime scene.
Visiting his sister in Sherrinford is never easy. The first time, with his parents in tow, is nearly unbearable.
“Chinese?” Sherlock would suggest. John would certainly appreciate that. He had appreciated that before.
Sherlock nodded. “Of course.”
John shook his head, unable to suppress a chuckle. “I’m not even going to ask.”
A steaming bowl is set on the coffee table before Sherlock, and John sits beside him, a mug in his hands.
Except.
Sherlock waits with baited breath, and barely a minute later, he receives:
“Me? I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?”
But then John ducked his head, and to Sherlock’s horror it sounded like he was sobbing, and when John lifted his head tears were indeed streaming down his red face, but he was grinning and it didn’t sound like sobs, it sounded like his laughter, his wonderful bubble of laughter. Sherlock was so relieved, he felt his face split into a grin, and he joined in, his chest releasing a tension he never realized he had, and he bowed his head, laughing along with John, who leaned forward wearily and rested his forehead on Sherlock’s collarbone. Without realizing it or meaning to, Sherlock found himself ducking his head down and brushing his lips over John’s soft, clean hair. John didn’t pull away, and Sherlock closed his eyes, shoulders sagging in relief. They stayed there, entwined and leaning together, for a long, long time.
“Ah,” Sherlock said, sitting up a bit straighter, “now
The rest of the evening flew by in a haze of wine and laughter, and after so many months of crushing grief and pain and loneliness and hopelessness, he felt ten years younger, more relaxed and contented than he could remember being in a long time. Sherlock regaled him of stories when he had rubbed catnip all over Mycroft’s new shoes and bag so that when he turned up at Parliament on his first day as an intern, he had been followed by half of the city’s stray cats. John’s eyes were watering with mirth, as were Sherlock’s as he went on to tell about the day Lestrade had been kidnapped by Mycroft, back when Sherlock started working for the Met, and Lestrade was twitchy, jumpy, and snapped at everyone for the rest of the day.
John gave a curt nod, then went back to his food. He could feel Sherlock watching him. “My father was appalled when Harry came out,” he told his plate. “Thought he’d break her nose. She was barely home after that.”
It was not unpleasant. Not at all.
John’s smile faded. He turned his head slightly to look at the fire burning, soft and warm and glowing. He took another sip of the whiskey, relishing in the burn as it made its way through his body.
Feeling himself go cross-eyed, John laughed and pulled back. “What are we doing?” he asked, still running his hands over Sherlock’s cheeks and hair, his neck and shoulders. “What the bloody hell are we doing.”
John took a good look at his best friend. Saw his swollen lips, his bruised and stitched face, marks that John gave him, the too-protruding cheekbones that Sherlock had given himself from drug use, which he’d done to put himself in grave danger, so John would save him, so he’d save John. Saw the way Sherlock was looking at him, hazy and overwhelmed and focused on him in a way John had never seen him focused on anyone, not even Irene Adler. It was… a disbelieving yearning. And the way Sherlock’s fingers were running over John’s face, into his hair, as if Sherlock couldn’t touch him enough, as if his actions were something he’d wanted to do for…
“I don’t think I can go back from this, John,” Sherlock admitted, looking at their joined hands.
John grinned. “Yes.”
Classic signs of avoidance.
Sherlock could feel the tremors running through John’s body, feel his chest heaving with gasps and cut-off sobs. He squeezed even tighter, his fingers digging into Sherlock’s back.
“I believe I said girlfriends were not really my area, and that I didn’t have a boyfriend.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cuddling,” John informs him, typing away on his laptop, one painful key at a time. “The colloquial term is cuddling.”
“Ah.”
“I asked if you had a girlfriend, and you said you were married to your work.”
Until two days ago, when he’d stayed sober with Sherlock, rather than flee back to his house to drown his grief. Instead, he’d lit himself on fire by baring his soul, and Sherlock had slowly doused the flames with his acceptance and love.
– he pauses for a moment, then –

Sherlock made an aborted movement, as if to take a sip of his whiskey, but couldn’t quite find the strength to bring the glass to his lips, so instead cradled it on his lap. He seemed unable to look at John.
John also seemed frozen as he stared at Sherlock. He seemed to just stop. He wasn’t breathing. It felt like ten seconds passed where John stared at Sherlock, and Sherlock stared back, neither of them moving.
John’s text does take a bit longer to come, and by the time it does, Sherlock is nearly coiled like a spring in anxiety.
“Very not good,” Sherlock mutters, staring, unseeing, at Rosie’s book.
“And I am so, so glad that you came back,” John finished.
And then John was walking over to him. Slow at first, then long, purposeful strides, and Sherlock could not walk away, nor could he think of anything clever or disdainful to say, and John’s fists were clenched at his sides, his jaw clenched, eyes hard and focused, and he was right in front of Sherlock, drawing his left fist back, and Sherlock, unblinking and unwavering, still looking into John’s blazing eyes, prepared for the punch…
John had skipped breakfast. John had showered, dressed, opened his emails with his back to Sherlock, tried to read but in reality stared at the same page for about an hour, went upstairs, came back down later, tried to watch telly with the volume far too loud, went downstairs to visit Mrs. Hudson, then finally fled the flat with the excuse of meeting someone named “Greg”, whoever that was.
“Yes,” Sherlock said slowly, picking up his wine and taking a long sip. He put the glass down and twirled it slowly on the tablecloth. “I’m not sure that’s completely accurate.”
“I’m not pretending. I have insufficient data.”
John huffed softly through his nose. “I hope she has no memories of these past few months.”
John hadn’t said a word to him all day. Hadn’t even looked at him.
Sherlock shrugged. “Possibly.”
"Cuddling," John informs him, typing away on his laptop, one painful key at a time. "The colloquial term is cuddling."
“Not quite. Very straightforward. Run until you’ve outrun them. No rooftop leaps or cabbie chases. Dull.”
“She missed you,” John agreed.
John would like that. He had liked that before.
He had absolutely no doubt that he’d be warmly welcomed back, that John would be delighted to see him.
John smiled, and there was a few more moments of comfortable silence as they enjoyed their meals. Then he said, “Girlfriends must be vetted, too.”
Sherlock’s shoulders relaxed a bit on a long exhale. “Good.”
“Because I don’t want to, John,” Sherlock sighed. “There are other people I’d prefer to spend my time with. More to the point, I doubt we’d make it a week in each other’s company before one of us attempted to murder the other.” He picked up a fork, and prodded at his risotto half-heartedly. “I think she’s clever.”
“Oh God, must be ten years now,” Sherlock sighed, rubbing his eyes and grinning deliriously.
I had to write the Fix-It to awkward-morning-after-accidentally-cuddling-in-their-sleep-because-There-Was-Only-One-Bed.
Sherlock’s head ducked as he grinned hard enough to make his eyes crinkle. John felt the expression forming on his own face. He pulled Sherlock’s right hand to his own lips, planting a kiss on it. “I do have Rosie to consider, and you… well, you need to recover. There’s just… Jesus, there’s so much baggage… let’s just go slow so we can do it right.”
John’s fists on Sherlock’s collar clenched so his knuckles were white, and this would be it, this would be when John punched him…
“I don’t need to tell her anything, John. There’s nothing to tell.”
“It’s fine, John.”
Sherlock lifts Rosie onto his lap so they can both stare down at her book as she points and babbles nonsense words. Sherlock repeats the words correctly and slowly, over and over so Rosie mimics as best she can, and John chuckles and smiles and sits right next to Sherlock so their arms and legs press together. And when Rosie grows tired of the books and words and rests against Sherlock, limp and trusting and heavy-eyed as the quiet telly glows in the darkening room, Sherlock sighs a tired yet contented sigh, sliding down on the couch and tipping his head sideways so it rests on John’s soft, jumper-covered shoulder. He feels that unbearably soft sensation press against his head again as his eyes slide closed and he lets himself melt and think only of how comfortable and safe and content and grateful he is now, in this wonderful, warm moment.
He shook his head. “There’s nothing new under the sun.”
“And that you were married to your work.”
for her.”
“Please do.”
The spell was broken, and John grinned. “No crime scenes for Rosie until she’s at least thirty.”
Sherlock thought John was wondering if they were making a mistake. He’d thought John was pulling away.
“I wouldn’t call myself married to my work these days.” Sherlock frowned at his wine glass as he slowly turned it. John stared, hypnotized, at the gently swaying liquid in the glass barely slosh at Sherlock’s gentle movements. “That would make me a rubbish godfather, wouldn’t it?”
It was a hug. A long, gripping hug, and Sherlock was in no rush to relinquish.
The echo of the same question from two days’ before was not lost on John, who took a moment to marvel at how much his answer had changed in such a time. “Right now, yes. I think so.”
Sherlock felt his stomach drop, but took a deep breath and sank into his Mind Palace.
Sherlock, almost shyly, touched John’s face and shoulders and hair, staring at him in what John thought to be awe.
Sherlock stares and stares. Obviously, this has taken John some liquid courage. But… he hopes Sherlock hasn’t been scared off, which means he doesn’t want Sherlock to leave! Sherlock doesn’t hesitate to reply.
“Oh John, I couldn’t possibly explain it all now,” Sherlock would feign indifference and nonchalance. He’d heave a great sigh and adopt a tired, faraway look. “So many cities, so many idiots all over the world. Really, it would take hours and hours to explain.” And he’d wink.
John pulled on his coat, and when he turned to exchange a small smile with Sherlock. As he was leaving, he turned briefly to see Sherlock running slightly shaking fingers over his own lips, staring at John’s chair.
“You seem upset, Sherlock.”
The sitter was late, the tube was delayed, it started pouring the minute he stepped outside, and by the time he reached Angelo’s, his shoes and jacket were soaked. Yet as soon as the restaurant door closed behind him, silencing the rain and engulfing him in a soft golden glow of candles and dimmed lighting, John felt himself relax. And when he spotted Sherlock sitting at the table by the window where they’d sat the night they first met, John smiled.
“Ten years…” John shook his head. “I was in Afghanistan.” He sighed and sat back, full but not uncomfortably so. “What was your first case with Lestrade? How did you two meet?”
John grinned.
A few weeks ago, even a few days ago, he’d have poured more wine. Drank the whole bottle himself, probably. And gone out for more.
“What parents do to their offspring to create a physical bond,” Sherlock recites, sitting closed-eyed on the sofa, his hands posed as if in prayer in front of his lips.
“She initiated. I reciprocated, only to further the illusion of affection and romance.”
“All right, yes, thank you,” John interrupted, his face red from coughing. “Jesus, no need to recount everything.”
And they’d stroll home… to 221b Baker Street… and Sherlock would time it so that they’d arrive when Mrs. Hudson was normally out visiting Mrs. Turner, and they’d go to the sitting room and they’d sit in their chairs across from each other, and Sherlock would pour them glasses of the leftover brandy hidden in the back of the corner cabinet, and he’d finish his tale (leaving out Mycroft’s involvement in that disastrous Serbian fiasco). Then he’d heave a great sigh, turn up his hands, and finish with “And here we are.”
“Ah yes, the seventeen year old aspiring singer with newly pink hair and a slight obsession with British boy bands.”
John chuckles, not looking up from his laptop screen. “Classified? Really, Sherlock. You can’t possibly be as ignorant as you’re pretending to be about cuddling.”
“It’s ten right now, and I’m not too knackered yet. Are you?”
And Sherlock would admit (with the help of the brandy) that he did not enjoy most of his time away. That often, he had been…
“I suppose I do,” Sherlock said, taking another sip of wine. John noticed it was a rather long sip. “She’s interesting. Clever. One of the few not-boring people on the planet. And I feel sorry for her. She’s… solitary. In a way I… used to want to be. At one time
Sherlock’s smile faded slightly. “He might have… arrested me a little for public intoxication. I was a bit high. But while he was driving me to the Met, I solved a case he’d been stumped on for weeks. As usual.”
Sherlock gaped at John’s wicked smile. “Wait… you just…” His face, which had been flushed before, turned scarlet at John’s giggle. Then his lips turned up, and a deep laughter spilled out of his chest. John surged forward, capturing Sherlock’s laughs with his lips.
“I know.”
“We’re both idiots,” John chuckled.
He would whip off the glasses and “Surprise!” and John would do a double take. His mouth would drop open in shock, Sherlock would barely be able to contain his grin, and John would leap to his feet in delight.
Late that evening, John leaves.
“Really John, your vocabulary has quite simply flourished during my brief absence.”
“Hmm. Fancy a nightcap?”
“Not in the least.”
Written as a fix-it to an angsty prompt on Tumblr, in which Sherlock and John are super awkward and uncomfortable after accidentally cuddling while sharing a bed the night before.
“I have withstood many trials in my life, but your death would be the one I could not pass. I cannot bear losing you.” Sherlock huffed and glanced down at his pockmarked arm. “I do not think I would survive that.”
“Not irrelevant, Sherlock. Data.”
John could supply the correct word. He was good at that.
,” Sherlock scoffed. “As if I was actually under his employ. Probation for sixty days!”
they def cuddle again.
And Sherlock would say that the Work was not all that mattered anymore. That there were other things… a person… that turned out to be quite as important…
“Even if I’d wanted to, it really wasn’t an ideal place for that. Timing, as you constantly remind me. We were a bit preoccupied with escaping before more terrorists arrived.”
“You are a wonderful father, John. Rosie will know nothing but happiness.”
“Not really my area.”
“The circles under your eyes are vanishing. And you haven’t touched your shoulder yet this evening.”
“You saw her go into the bathroom while I was naked in the tub, John, what do you think?”
