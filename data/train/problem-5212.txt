Eventually, Steve was beckoned over by Tony. Tony explained how Steve helped get him out of Hel and was also his boyfriend. That got Steve pulled into a Maria Stark embrace.
“Even though it was suspicious that you were there.” Bucky added, but stopped at Steve’s harsh look from beside Tony. Tony saw the look from the corner of his eye and his mouth twitched upward in a victorious smirk. Bucky saw it, grit his teeth, and released a slow breathe. “Sorry. Shouldn’t have threatened you. Sorry.” He rushed briskly.
Thor released Steve’s shoulders slowly and gave Tony a perplexed look. “...Me?” then a look of horror dawned on his face. “I cannot kill Jörmungandr! Loki has loved him ever since we were children!”
Later, most of the Avengers had gone off to bed leaving only Sam, Steve, and Howard awake. The older man broke the comfortable silence that had descended.
Last tour group Steve directed, he had gotten Natasha by interrupting her target practice and informing her their fans were ready for her show. A show of which she had no idea of. However Natasha was a fast thinker and clever, so she had turned her show into a demonstration of how to escape holds with Steve as the attacker, obviously. Steve had figured his bruises and being thrown about were her revenge. But, evidently he was wrong.
Steve decided now was as good a time as any to at least clear one part of this mess up. He would let Tony know he never faked his feelings. If Tony faked his...then they can discuss that. But Steve wanted to make sure Tony knew he wasn’t temporary to Steve. So the blonde walked over to the brunette.
“Let’s review.” Sam said. “We now know how Loki owned Tony. We also know we owe a certain Stark a visit. And we know that Tony’s been with Loki ever since he was a child.”
Then another howl penetrated the air as the group readied themselves. Steve gripped his shield and was thankful that he had the sense to grab it before leaving the Arena. The blonde shook his head to stop that train of thought. He couldn't think about the Arena and what happened there and the person still there.
Loki then teleported himself into the Palace’s Library. He ran towards the ritual table in the center of the room. He then grabbed some chalk off of it, and quickly swept everything else on the table onto the floor. He hurried to write out the correct runes but fumbled once and thus had to erase his mistake and write the correct rune in its place.
2. Tony goes on recruitment alot in the Monster Bog but never tried to recruit Bruce just wanted to make sure that was clear. So Bruce has no idea about Tony’s underworld connection.
Rhodey and a shade name Edwin Jarvis, who Tony had grown particularly close to, had then ran into the room.
“You coward!” Rhodes accused Howard. “You’d trade your son for another chance at life and hide it behind that excuse!”
Thor and the other Avengers journeyed into Hel via a nearby entryway the magic map had pointed out. Once in Hel, they began to make their way down the yellow path.
“Do NOT make me out to be the villain here!” Loki seethed through clenched teeth, he then yelled. “I am the only one who has done nothing wrong in this whole situation!”  He jabbed Tony with a finger. “I kept my promise to
Thor closed his eyes in pain, he was right. He did know how this would play out. He, like all of them, now knew how Tony had come into Loki’s possession.
“Thanks Howard. I...I appreciate the offer. I do. But Peggy,” Steve shook his head and thumbed his nose to try and stave off any tears. “You know Peggy told me I … I  shouldn’t be near her.” Steve grabbed his head and let out a shaky breath. “I’ve always been sickly and weak and” a sob broke through Steve’s mouth and Howard placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “...Why her?! Why did she get it?”
Tony wasn’t there. But everyone else was and no one had seen or heard of anyone seeing him. Phil even reported that none of their rival heroes have been spotted in the area.
“Please those heroes are loving this.” Tony rolled his eyes, remembering all the stuff he had seen about the Avengers the last time he had gone up to the land of the living. “They just want to get love and praise from the masses. And all these fights are just boosting their appeal to Thor
“Yeah,” Tony chuckled quietly into the King's ear so only he heard it. “You’re not that clever.” King Minos began thrashing and a high ranking member of the court ordered a guard to take Minos and restrain him.
“You insulted goddess Frigga and as “punishment” was gifted Asterion here!” Steve gestured to the crouching minotaur. “You then abused him and his mother!” At this the crowd’s eyes swept to the Queen who hadn’t looked away from Asterion, she had such a sorrowful but loving look on her face. “She got him to safety but you dragged him back here. You then lied and used him as a threat to try and gain control over your neighboring city states.”
- “You know why we’re out here in the middle of the night, Grant ?!” Tony put so much emphasis on Grant, Steve regretted telling him his middle name. “I was going to propose to you !” He almost yelled, taking a ring box out of his pocket. If Steve hadn’t been this focused, he would have asked why the hell he had that on him. Instead, he gasped. “On the Manhattan Bridge where we met !”
- “It is, if it’s your second offense.. Which is the case for 10 of these gentlemen.” He wiggled his eyebrows. “And some are actually named John, which is funny, isn’t ?”
-”I won't give you any case today, Stark, because there are none. I know you want to win your bet, but I can’t, and won’t help you.”
Some of them popped crackers full of confetti, and began dancing, while Clint flipped the board and showed a big “STARK WINS”. Tony pointed at it, screaming “Look !” and dance awkwardly toward Steve, a small box in hand. As if it wasn’t embarrassing enough, he got on one knee and opened said box.
Fucking Fury and fucking Rogers for thinking that garbage holiday was somewhat important. Uh. Steve looked at him, like he knew what he had tried, and failed, to do.
- “Nah, it goes on the good dates list.” Steve opened his mouth, and Tony finally looked at him, smiling. “Only ‘cause we caught the bad guys.” He winked.
3 weeks later and fuck. Tony had fucked himself up, hadn’t he ? Because he had… Put his eggs all in one basket or sold something before getting something… No matters how the saying went, Tony had his own way of saying it : He fucked up. Because it had been 2 weeks without any new real solve, any new cases done, and Steve Rogers was now almost 10 points ahead of him.
- “Uh ?” Tony seemed to have forgotten about him. “Our… Dad ? Nanny ? I don’t know. We can’t have two wise brothers.” He shrugged.
- “It’s nowhere in the rules, Stark. Be a good player, for once.” Steve said. Tony blew him a kiss in return.
- “Hey, sorry to be late.” He said, entering and pushing a box into Steve’s arm. He was still wearing his dumb clothes, but at least he was there. When Steve opened the box, he found pie. So at least, he had been kind of nice and thoughtful enough to bring desert.
“Creatures in Monster Bog! It is I Lord Thor, god of Thunder and fertility! I have a question to ask and I expect truthful answers or you will face my wrath.” Thor boomed loudly, making sure his voice carried so all could hear it.
“I told you, we’re reaching the bottom of the amphora here.” He walked over to the balcony and pointed down to the Avengers.  “No one wants to fight them! We’re at the point of either weak creatures or dipping into Hel’s employees and asking them to fight these guys.”
“What?”  Tony whipped his head over and his eyes widened upon seeing Steve and everyone. “Wh-what are you doing here?!”
I’m so glad you all liked the AU I created! It was SO MUCH FUN to come up with this idea and then write it, so I’m truly touched that so many of you liked it! <3
“Well…” Steve drawled self consciously. “There were a few moments where I felt like I stepped in a pitfall.”
“Regardless, I just got a letter of resignation from the satyr Pan. Apparently he has followers who now think he’s dead and he wants to rectify that.” Loki waved the papers he was holding.
“My fellow Athenians! We are here to commemorate and honor these marvelous heroes the Avengers!” The speaker at the podium gestured to the heroes behind him and the assembled crowd let out a raucous round of applause. The speaker then gestured for them to settle down and continued.  “It is thanks to them we will no longer have to worry about the barbarians that have been threatening our walls for the past year!” Another round of cheers, “And not only did they save us from this threat, but on their way here they slayed a giant on the northern road!” The crowd let out more cheers and applause till the speaker hushed them again. “And so we will commemorate the Avengers by adding them to our city.”
Thor then looked devastated and stared back at the frozen scene, his eyes focused on the small child. “Then I fear I know how this will play out.” He mumbled to himself.
Tony’s eyebrows knit together in confusion then smoothed out in understanding, his mouth forming an ‘O’. He then looked away guiltily and Pepper walked in front of him to catch his vision.
Loki’s appearance was different from the shrines depiction of him, but not by much. He was tall, over 6 feet for sure, not counting his horns. The shrine depiction got that correct. Loki had two large horns sprouting from his head, that curved slightly at the end. However he wasn’t blue and didn’t have red eyes; instead he was very pale and had jade green eyes. He wore a black linen floor length skirt that split open at the sides and complimented his long black hair. He also had a ton of gold dangled over his hips, neck, and around his horns.
Meanwhile Natasha grabbed Bucky’s sword and ran to the beasts neck. Clint gave her a boost and the redhead was launched into the air.
“It can be.” the older man said devoid of emotion, as if stating a fact. “All who I knew have long since passed, and if I remained among all of you.” He gestured to the horizon. “No doubt I would draw concern. A man that ages so slowly and knows so much.” He shook his head in the negative “I’d rather avoid it.” Both boys nodded in agreement then Erskine threw them a smile. “Plus sometimes Odin and Frigga come visit me so it’s never too lonely.”
Once they got to the other side, Happy helped Tony off the boat. Happy had to push and pull Tony through a few shades as they had all seemed to stop in their tracks. And it wasn’t hard to figure out what struck-dumb all the new shades.
“What is this manhandle-Tony-day?” Tony asked sarcastically finally getting the water away from his eyes. He then whipped his face over to Steve. “Whoa.” He gasped getting a good up-close look at the apparent adonis that was the blonde man.
“Excuse me?!” Tony exclaimed incredulous, his upper half leaning forward as if he needed to be closer to hear them correctly.
2. Loki you wouldn’t hate Steve so much if you stopped assuming shit and listening to Amora but instead talked to Thor, my goodness man.
He knew Jörmungandr would be able to take care of the Avengers. Nothing the humans could do would be able to harm his precious snake. And Thor and the other gods would no doubt be caught up in the Casket debacle. So he knew Jörmungandr would succeed, he just needed to be patient.
“Wait here guys. I think I know a place where we can rest.” And with that the blonde bolted into the treeline.
“Did Thor talk with you?” Steve asked, moving forward. Bucky reached to pull him back but Steve just took another step towards the god. “Have you-”
“With about 7, sometimes 8 people. Do you live here alone? What do you do with all this space?” Steve turned to Tony and caught him as the brunette quickly averted his eyes and seemed to close himself off from the blonde. “I’m sorry! I shouldn’t have-”
Jotunns were not like the gods who lived in Asgard, they were less wise. They were taller creatures with horns sprouting from their heads. Also the elements of the Cosmos were attuned to their very emotions, some could control fire, others earth, ice, etc. Odin was born of a peace between the (at the time) fairly new Asgardian gods and the old Jotunn’s. Bor, Odin’s father, ruled the Asgardian gods and was set to marry the heir to the Jotunn throne. However, King Laufey and his wife -Farbauti- had no heirs to offer Bor. And so Bor had married the next highest unattached heir. A cousin and counselor to the royal Jotunn’s, Bestla. Odin was eventually born from the union and all seemed well but none noticed the burning greed growing in Bestla.
Steve had to relearn everything. His new body was completely foreign to him. He couldn’t control his strength in any aspect. When he tried to go for a casual run he found he couldn’t stop when he wanted to, as he didn’t take his new speed into account. Which ended up in him smacking into a tree and that tree getting cracked in half. When going to give Bucky a playful shove, he had shoved his friend a good few feet away. When then offering a hand to help him up, he ripped Bucky’s arm out of its socket.
“Steve,” Bucky urged, resting a calming arm around his friend. Both friends shared a look of betrayal. Both were shocked beyond imagining at their friends past actions.
Bucky thanked the guard then pulled Steve back into the city. They had questioned the guards that worked the city gate near Tony’s house, hoping they had some information on Tony’s whereabouts but it was a dead end.
At the Avengers confused faces Pepper seemed to come to a realization. “You didn’t know.” She shook herself, “I’ll elaborate. The Mists of Knowledge ensnares everyone. Tempts them in with knowledge of everything. It shows you whatever you want or ask to see. But while in the Mist, it will steal your energy. For shades this means the final death. For it will pull all the shades energy till they are nothing and no more. For the living,” She gestures to the Avengers. “It pulls your energy until you die.”
“I understand your impatience, but listen to me, as I speak from experience. Acting rashly will only push you further from your goal not closer to it.”
Tony kept studying the blondes face but Steve seemed to be finished explaining. Tony looked away and the brunette’s eyes darted around for some time. Then he looked back determinedly at Steve.
After regaining their sight everyone looked towards the monster only to see it’s body limp and the last head completely charred. And there in front of it was the god of Thunder and Fertility Thor.
“Yeah, I’ll let you all know how Blueberry is doing.” The green ball came right up to Tony, engulfed him and thus teleported him in front of said god.
Frigga then asked Thor to recount all of Steve’s deeds. While he spoke his mother ran her fingers through his hair in a calming manner. Once he was done she gave him a kiss on the cheek and told him all would be well.
“No deal!”  Natasha yelled. Everyone looked at her in surprise, including Loki who arched an eyebrow at the woman.
But his actions belittled his words. Loki’s eyes were roaming Tony’s person, the same way he did when Tony would come back to the Palace after leaving for whatever reason. He was checking for injuries, noting any scraps. Tony popped out one of his hips, folded his arms, and gave the god a look filled with amusement.
“He basically stole my kill. But I let it slide since I saved his ass and can lord that over him forever.”
1. Poor Sam. In MCU he’s roped into fighting basically the whole government and in here he’s roped into standing against the god of the dead.
’ Tony opened the door and stared out at the empty porch in front of him and let out another deep sigh. ‘
Loki then huffed and went back to Hel with Thor. Whom he tried to push and shove away but the god of thunder was relentless. When the portal closed the mortals could all still see Thor and Loki wrestling and arguing with each other. Rhodey just shrugged and assured them all that everything would be fine.
They continued to fight verbally till the words got so heated that they turned to fighting physically.  They had brawled for a bit, all the while Loki would continue to throw poisonous words at Thor.
When Tony was about 15 Loki had offered an overseer position to his friend and one-sided rival Amora. Amora was an immortal that did not warrant the status of goddess, instead she was just at the level of witch. She had lusted after Thor for as long as Loki could remember but Thor never had any desire to be with Amora. Still she pursued him and even befriended Loki in hopes of becoming closer to the blonde god. Loki, however, was no fool and did not let her out match him. That being said he did enjoy her company and would count her as a friend.
Loki was sitting on his throne and attempting to not fidget in impatience. He briefly wondered where Amora had gone off to but dismissed it.
“Everything’s shut tight. Just like you cryptically told us to do before running off.” Bucky said as he and Steve walked over to examine the box.
Tony still enjoyed the company of some shades (Jarvis in particular) and kept up his lessons with the shades who had been teaching him in earnest all these years. But he no longer roamed the Field of Content Souls.
“You will be damning them for all eternity. They will live out their mortal life in your current spot here in Hel and then when they die, they’ll take their own place in Hel.”
Sam and Bruce had laid the brunette down on the beach. Sam had been propping the brunettes back up in order to keep his injury in the back from touching the ground. But when Steve had arrived the blonde had pulled Tony’s upper body towards himself.
“Plus I should be the one escorting you home, not the other way around.” Steve added then pulled the brunette away from the waters edge.
“Please, I am NOT going to forget.” But he headed towards the door that lead to the Palaces inner personal chambers so he could mark the additional year on his running tally.
“I don’t!” Steve quickly added, his arms up in surrender. “Bruce said he thought you were creating a compendium about the Monsters of the world, is that wrong?”
Peggy’s now bony fingers played with the engagement ring on her finger and Steve also fiddled with the one he had on his hand.
“But I would have seen him. How did I not see him?” At everyones curious looks Thor elaborated. “This is the longest I haven’t visited Hel. I usually came here once a month before I met you all.”
“Anthony.” He gripped his son's shoulders, “We’re not heading to the military base. Instead we’re going to...get help to win the war.” He gave Tony’s shoulders a squeeze “in the underworld.”
Happy and Pepper’s faces darkened but they both hid it from the Avengers as the group of friends continued to bicker.
Eventually the Avengers got the snake to follow them down to the harbor. Tony had put himself between them a few times during the pursuit. But as predicted, Jörmungandr immediately backed off once he noticed Tony coming close to his intended target. However, that didn’t stop Steve from throwing concerned looks Tony’s way each time he saw the man intervene.
Tony knew this was a sensitive subject to her. After spending so many years together, after years of her needling all his insecurities. Tony had observed and learned where Amora’s weaknesses were. And he was ready to exploit all of them.
“I know I can’t hurt you….well not physically….yet.” She gave an evil smile. “But I know hurting them,” She waved to the Avengers. “Will hurt you.” She gave a happy shrug. “So it’s like a cherry on top.”
During the walk back home, Bucky had kept his head down and moved briskly. No one tried to make conversation, instead they traveled in silence. After they arrived home, Bucky made a beeline for his room, Steve following the whole time.
“Yeah?” Tony whispered looking into Steve’s blue eyes. “I did to.” He admitted then looked down at the flower in his hands.
Steve’s hands landed on Tony’s hips and began to control their movements. Pulling them down for deep slow drags then faster shallower one. Tony then moved his own hands down and started pulling on Steve’s smallclothes.
“This will end badly.” Loki gave no reaction and Tony ran his fingers through his hair then groaned and let the fight leave his body. He looked Loki in the eyes and sighed.
Steve’s face instantly took on a dark red hue as the others gave him some comforting words. All but Bucky, who only looked confused as he glanced at his best friend then back to their other friends.
“Did you think I was named The Falcon because I like birds? “ He quipped, making his wings spread out behind him in show. Thor, who had known of Sam’s wings, laughed at his friends confused faces.
The centaur glared at the brunettes back then broke into a gallop in order to get in front of the human. As he passed Tony, he had grabbed the man’s arms.
“Great!” Steve then pulled Tony over to the guard that had been talking and yanked the man off the horse.
Training with Erskine had been tough, more than tough it was downright brutal at times. But the knowledge was more than helpful. He went over not only different fighting techniques but taught them all he knew of different monsters and how to take them down. They had run drills on how to handle giant lions, sea serpents, enemy armies, cyclops, and so much more. It was rigorous but incredibly beneficial. Steve had been at the island just over 3 years now.
“I swear Ty put me down or I’ll-” Tony declared finishing his threat by jabbing a leg into Ty’s chest.
“I don’t think you understand what you’re denying yourself.” The centaur then proceeded to flex and the brunette -Tony- made a retching sound and motion.
“Good thing King Minos said he’s never cleaned the death row convict’s bodies out of there.” Bucky snickered and nudged Clint playfully. “Otherwise you’d be carrying a pigs head into “battle”.”
“Perfect!” Steve cheered then turned to the other women and men lined up next to and behind himself. “Alright, again! Get in position and do some practice jabs on my mark.” Steve strode in front of the group and gave the signal and everyone began their practice.
“Not as!... Nothing nefarious! You can trust us!...Just it’s dangerous, and-” He continued to talk to try and get his point across.
Tony had almost broke down but held fast. Though he did readily jump into the hug Steve offered. The blonde then soothed his lover. Telling him he wasn’t mad that Tony was having a hard time adjusting and would need some time. He did reprimand the brunette though. Saying he needed to tell him when he was having a hard time with things.
Howard knelt in front of Tony and attempted to grab his shoulders but his hands fell through. He threw Loki a pleading look and with a wave of Loki’s hand his color returned and his body was whole again.
But Steve rallied against it. Internally he felt as if he was wading through the ocean. Wave after wave was pushing him. But he kept pushing against the tide, against the current, against each wave.
“Should we take bets on how long it’ll take?” Amora asked lightly, a smile on her face as she watched the Hydra almost take a bite out of the smaller blonde fighter.
Tony squatted down in the dirt and drew out a crude map. “You guys will act as bait leading him to the harbor. Thor you’ll be there waiting for us, but out of sight. Once we have him at the water, that’s when you reveal yourself. Cut off his retreat so he has nowhere to go but out into the water. Then push him further and further out into the sea. If you keep laying on the lightning and thunder, eventually he’ll just turn tail and head back to Hel to hide.”
“So much for catching up on that reading.” Loki sighed then put a place marker in the book and set it down.
“Tony this is the Monster Bog,” Sam stressed “Any human that steps foot in here, usually dies in here.”
“Pack your stuff, you're leaving.” Loki ordered, breaking up the tension that had replaced all the ice the Throne Room previously had.
Bucky’s face dropped as Sam beamed at the blonde. Clint and Bruce looked shocked while Thor and Betty looked confused. Natasha didn’t show a reaction other than her eyebrows hitching up higher on her face. Then all the questions came, all at once.
“Did you finish it?” Loki asked, knowing that if he didn’t intervene Amora and Tony would continue to trade barbs and he was in no mood for that.
Clint got thrown in a dumpster. Loki had some muscles in that lanky frame and he used them to throw the only one who managed to track him down into a dumpster. Tony hailed the three of them a cab and threw money at the driver so he would step on it. Steve sprung out of the car and grabbed Loki who thrashed like a cornered Tiger. Everyone converged on that location.
Tony then ran as if to charge and tackle the woman. However she just whipped her head over to his direction and smirked.
Everyone took a moment to let that sink in. Thor then noticed that once again they had journeyed away from the yellow path. Thor beckoned his friends to follow him and once again they departed the mist.
“Yes.” Howard then stood up and grabbed Tony’s hand, then walked them towards where the map said to go. “When in the underworld, do not speak unless spoken to or I tell you to. Do not wander from my side, and do not touch anything.”
The man wore a warrior's dress with purple accents but no cape. He had multiple bows and a variety of arrows on his person, as well as a dagger strapped to his ankle. He had an easy smile on his face as he went over to the deceased and began to take his arrows out of their bodies.
“You’ll fit in just fine here.” She then turned and continued walking. Sam knocked Bucky’s shoulder with a friendly grin and followed after the red head.
The blonde looked unprepared for these questions. His mouth hung open as if trying to will itself to say something but his brain supplied it nothing. Sam meanwhile groaned and pushed at Bucky’s shoulder lightly.
Finally Steve and Bucky felt ready to begin their training but Erskine put them off, giving excuse after excuse till the whole day was wasted. He then repeated this the next day and the day after that. On that third day Bucky finally snapped at the man.
“Yeah but at the same time we should at least know of him. Or have heard about him. When you live here your whole life, it stops being such a big city.”
2. I was SO excited to write the confrontation. Let me tell you I had so many versions of this and loved each of them but ultimately I think this is the one that works best for the story and the remainder of the story.
She yanked Tony closer to her and enfolded him in a tight embrace. Clutching each other they sunk to the temple floor, clinging to each other as they cried. Eventually a crazed laugh broke free from Maria’s lips as she pulled Tony’s face away from her shoulder to look him over. She then let a smile overtake her face, tears still clinging to her eyes.
Later that day, Bucky, Bruce, and Thor went to Tony’s. Thor had flown them all to the cliffside. He had said he was eager to see the statue of Loki his friends had talked about. It wasn’t often mortals decorated their homes with statues of his lover; his mother and father, were common decorations but not Loki.
Bucky looked shocked and completely offended at Steve’s words. Steve meanwhile burst out laughing as Bucky sputtered.
“Yes as I was saying.” Pepper jumped back to her original train of thought. “Happy saw you all go into the Mists over and over. He tried to call out to you but by the time he was close enough you were in too deep…” Pepper seemed to take a moment to really think over her next few words. “He sent a message to come and assist you. I was allowed to come.”
And so the next day, the main hall had a spread of food and drinks out. There was also an excess of pillows and cushions in the room. The couches and chairs were arranged nicely around other side tables which had some dice and other games littered across them. Thor was abuzz with excitement, sparkles shot off from his shoulders and fingertips and zapped a few of the Avengers.
“The only plausible answer is he lied and did sell his soul.”  Natasha deduced but her face gave away that she didn’t quite believe this.
Tony blinked, tears springing to his eyes as he was brought back to the present. He made to get up but Jarvis advised against it.
On their way back to New Thebes the group was accosted by a woman wearing a floor length chiton with some armor that appeared to have been slapped on top of it haphazardly. She held a spear in an inexperienced grip and brandished it at the heroes from on top of her horse. She identified herself as Betty Ross and demanded they release Bruce as he had done nothing wrong and her father had simply lied and slandered his name.
“Thor! What did I say about-” Bruce began to chastise but Thor threw Bruce a brilliant smile, disarming the man.
Grand pillars surrounded the building. Inside there were several bedrooms, a sizable kitchen and food storage area, a grand washroom, a few bathrooms, a stable like area complete with a running course, and two large sitting rooms. One of which had a huge hole cut out of the ceiling. Originally Tony was sure a dome of some sort was built up on the now sky light but Tony asked the god to keep it open. After all this place would become his home after he earned his freedom, so his input into what he wanted was taken into consideration. And Tony wanted a constant view of the sky, specifically the sun and the stars. He also wanted a small garden like his mother had when he was a child. Hence why in one of the several open courtyard areas of his home, there was a small garden next to a grand, life-size statue of Loki.
However as Natasha came at him, Fenrir shrunk then darted in and clamped down on Sam’s leg. Sam let out a shout of pain and everyone shouted his name as they raced to try and help.
“You told me your weakness and I abused it.” Tony made to protest but Steve physically covered Tony’s mouth with his hand. “So I’ll tell you mine.”
Finally Thor had had enough and decided to silence Loki the only way possible. He wrestled Loki against the wall, braved the winter's touch on his skin once Loki unleashed it upon him. He was immortal he would heal from the frostbite. Then Thor began to rip at Loki’s clothes. Loki, in turn, began to tear at Thor’s armor, cursing him the entire time. Eventually he dropped his winters touch but kept his angry blue skin. After divesting themselves of clothing, they jumped each other and went at it against the wall. Loki had stayed blue the entire time. His anger never wavering even after they both climaxed.
“Thor, my dear!” Amora grabbed his bare arm. “Loki and I were talking about something very important before you came in. Please!” She yanked on him with surprising strength and began manhandling him out of the throne room. “Just one moment! Stay out here, let us finish! And then you can come back in and ask for,” She gave him a once over and threw him a flirty wink “whatever you want.” She said in a seductive tone.
The Avengers then began to arm themselves with the weapons they had grabbed on their way out of the mansion. Bucky however looked extremely frustrated as he kept dropping his spear, unable to keep or even perform a proper hold.
His shield was strapped to the back of his warriors dress, overtop his blue cape. Bucky looked like a walking weapons depot. Like Sam, Bucky didn’t have a cape (“Gets in the way of grabbing my weapons”).  He had spears strapped to his back, a sword on his hip, steel bracers on each arm, a dagger on the other side of his hip and another dagger his ankle. He also had his satchel of backup items tied around his waist. Meanwhile, Sam had his bow, a closed case of arrows, and a sword on his hip.
The Avengers and Tony walked into the main hall of the Palace. All the gathered nobles bowed and King Minos beamed at them from his throne. King Minos was a portly man, not to the point of excess but enough to show he didn’t do much (if any) manual work. His hair was kept nicely trimmed,and was mostly brunette, save for the white just above his ears and in the wisps of his hair.
They had been going out for sometime. Steve had wanted to do something special for Peggy so he had planned an outing where they went to the seaside and spent the whole day by the beach. Lounging near the water they had planned their future together, where their dream house would be (“A house right by the water, so we can fall asleep to the sound of the waves”), what they would be doing (“You’ll be running the whole Grecian world.” “Then you can be my kept man”), how many children they’d have (“Two”). It was then Peggy that had pulled a ring out.
“A lovers quarrel?” Sam questioned, glancing at his friends. Steve’s eyes didn’t leave the scene before him but Bucky gave him a shrug.
He gestured to the 6 wet cement blocks that had each Avengers name written in them. On cue the Avengers walked off the stage and kneeled in front of each of their respective blocks.
Then Fenrir shrank drastically till he was the size of a dog. He then launched himself at Tony, causing said man to fall onto the ground.
The blonde let out a deep sigh and made himself more comfortable. “It’s dumb but the sea, to me. Is a reminder that I was….useless. I couldn't do anything.” Steve seemed to be lost in his own world again as Tony sat silently next to him.
“Indeed.” Erskine agreed with a smile. He then got up and gestured for Steve to follow him. “Tomorrow I will join you for your training.”
“Takes some getting used to, trust me.” Bucky chuckled and Steve blushed as both of them began comparing his new form to his previous one.
1. Do you like Sam’s backstory? I went with a Perseus remix and I really like the results. I was debating on killing Riley then thought this is a Disney AU so nope, he’s alive!
Loki thought. Figuring out the humans were trying to keep him talking so they could be rescued by their dear Thor. ‘
“More reason for me to go with you.” Thor tightened his grip. “You may have dominion over dead mortals, but I am the protector of living mortals. It is my right to protect all living mortals. Even from you.”
“Oooh!” Ty cheered, then yanked Tony closer “I like ‘em fiery!” Steve let out another growl and the branch he was holding snapped in his hand.
“Uh-yeah, I gu-ESS!” Tony gasped as Thor gave him a tighter squeeze. The blonde then released a staggering Tony and marched inside.
The two stayed clinging to each other for quite some time. Eventually the tears subsided and Maria begged for answers. Tony found he couldn’t tell her the whole truth. He didn’t want to. He couldn’t bring himself to sully the moment. So he told her the bare minimum. He had been living in Hel and now was able to return to the land of the living.
Tony’s shoulders slumped in defeat and shame. He didn’t lift his head as he couldn’t bring himself to meet any of the Avengers eyes.
Tony had met the Minotaur in Monster Bog. He had tried to recruit the monster but was denied (this detail he left out of his retelling to the Avengers). Tony talked to him more and learned his name was Asterion. Eventually Asterion revealed his life story to the brunette.
A woman at the front desk smiled, her black hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. “Hey! I’m Maria Hill, the school secretary. How can I help you guys?” she asked sweetly.
Peter’s tears tugged at Steve’s heart, wanting more than anything to reach out and comfort the distressed boy. Unfortunately, there was a strict rule in the school against too much physical contact between adults and students. He just hoped Tony would be there soon.
He sat up with a yawn before looking around. His curtains were drawn shut, but light was still peeking through so it must not have been too late in the afternoon. Peter frowned softly and sat up. “Daddy?” he called softly, curious as to where his dad was. When he didn’t get a reply, he crawled out of bed to go find him. Peter made his way out into the hallway, dragging his comforter behind him. “Daddy?” he said again a little louder this time. Frowning more, he got into the elevator. He stood on his tippy toes and pressed the button that he knew went down to Tony’s workshop; he wasn’t supposed to be down there by himself, but if he was meeting Tony, it was allowed… right?
“Quit marking my kid,” Tony said as he took Peter from Pepper, licking his thumb and wiping away the lipstick stain. “You took away my kiss!” Peter gasped, to which Tony rolled his eyes jokingly. “Yeah yeah, I’m a terrible dad… let’s go bug,” he said again. “Thanks Pep! Thanks Rhodes!” Tony called behind him as he got onto the elevator, Peter in one arm and his backpack in the other.
Peter looked at Tony with slightly glazey eyes, nodding lightly. “Mhm,” he mumbled, cuddling closer to Tony. “Y-You said we’d get ice cream after school,” he added faintly.
“Cookie Monster!! I want Cookie Monster!” Peter answered with a giggle. He was referring to the special kind of ice cream that was at their favorite ice cream place. It was vanilla ice cream dyed blue with crushed cookies inside.
“Thank you for reminding me baby, you’re the best,” Tony said with a smile. He noticed Peter sucking his thumb, but didn’t comment on it at all. Usually he’d lightly reprimand him but this time he let it sligh; Peter was already upset enough. He knelt down and picked up the heavy quilt before making his way onto the elevator. “Come on bug, let’s dry those tears hm?” he hummed softly, using his sleeve to wipe his tears as the elevator went up.
Tony walked closer to the room, but stopped when he felt Peter start to pull back. He knew this would come: the part where Peter got shy and refused to go into the room. “What’s wrong bug?”
Peter nodded and leaned up to press a big kiss on Rhodey’s cheek. “Thank you Uncle Rhodey!” he said sweetly, his small hands pressing Rhodey’s cheeks together as he looked up at him. “Of course squirt! Be good today buddy,” Rhodey said fondly before passing the boy off to Pepper. “Thank you Auntie Pep!” Peter said, pressing a wet kiss to her cheek with a giggle. “Payback,” she hummed as she kissed his cheek, her red lipstick leaving a print.
“I’ll see you then too buddy. Now go join your group!” Tony encouraged with a smile. With that, Peter ran off to the room. Tony sighed softly and stood back up, his eyes a little tearful. God help him the day Peter went off to college… oh how he’ll dread that day.
He followed the cries down the hallway, reaching the door just a few moments later. Instantly, he swooped inside and picked Peter up off of the chair before his son had even recognized the man to be his father. “Shh you’re okay bambino, daddy’s got you… you’re alright,” he whispered as he rocked his son back and forth.
“Peter! Get down!” Tony shouted sternly. He watched his son spin around with wide eyes, a guilty expression on his face. “What did I tell you about coming down here?”
Peter giggled happily at that and nodded. “Uncle Rhodey is silly Daddy,” he agreed with another giggle before turning his attention back to the TV.
Peter nodded sadly, smiling a tiny bit when he saw a smile on Happy’s face too. “M’kay… I see you later!!” And with that, Peter ran his way back to Tony, holding his hand instantly again. Tony smiled and started to head up to the main office. The father and son duo walked inside.
“Oh don’t worry about that Petey. It was just the school bell! Do you know what that means?” Steve replied with a comforting tone. Peter frowned and shook his head with a confused expression. “It means your Dad is here!!”
At this point, they’d made their way back to the classroom and were all getting back to their desks. “We’re going to do our ABCs and then we’ll head off to lunch folks,” Steve said with a smile. He took out a piece of chalk and wrote a big ‘A’ on the chalkboard. “This is the first letter of the alphabet; A! A is for: Apple!” he explained to the class.
“Let’s go make breakfast buddy, alright? We can make french toast, waffles, pancakes… whatever you want,” Tony hummed as he stood back up. Peter took that as an invitation to jump up into Tony’s arms, who caught him with a grunt. “You’re getting too heavy for Daddy big man. Soon I won’t be able to carry you!” he teased.
Steve noticed Tony’s eyes, knowing he probably felt the same way most parents did when they first dropped their kids off. “Don’t worry. He’ll have a great time. I put him a great table, he’ll make friends with them in no time,” Steve reassured.
Steve’s heart swelled at that, beaming happily. He loved that Peter trusted him so much, he hadn’t realized how nervous Peter was around other adults until Tony had told him. “Well, I’m glad I could be of help for Pete.”
Once they were home, Tony made Peter some mac-n-cheese and got him a warm bubble bath. Then he got him into a soft onesie and was setting him down for bed. “Okay baby, what do you wanna read?” Tony asked, walking to the bookcase.
Tony rolled his eyes fondly with a smile. He leaned forward with a napkin and gently wiped it off Peter’s nose. “You are just so messy,” he teased softly.
Tony goes to get Peter from school, but something about the teacher makes him feel different than any other time he'd gotten his son from school
Peter instantly nodded his head, his curls flopping everywhere as he did so. “Yes!! Yes please! I gotta see Ned a-and MJ and Harry!! Can we have a playdate? I told them we could have a playdate!” Peter rambled.
Tony groaned teasingly at Peter’s adorable expression and he halfheartedly climbed up into the bed, pulling his little Peter close to his warm chest. “Just for tonight baby boy,” he mumbled softly, turning out the lamp before closing his eyes.
Steve looked up instantly, running over to Peter and the group of kids that had gathered around. “Pete? Hey buddy, you okay?” he asked softly
At that comment, Peter shook his head quickly and clung tighter to his dad as he nuzzled his face into Tony’s neck. “Nuh uh,” he murmured softly. Tony chuckled and pressed a kiss to Peter’s head before making his way into the kitchen, Rhodey following behind them. “What do you wanna eat bug?” he asked again softly. “Waffles!!” Peter cheered loudly, his mood perking up at the promise of waffles.
The rest of the class went similarly; Steve would give a word that started with the letter he said and a student would interrupt to give him another word. “Good job everybody!! We learned the ABCs!!” Steve praised while clapping his hands, all of the kids sitting with wide smiles. “Okie dokie, let’s grab our lunches from our cubbys and we’ll head down to lunch.”
“Hey hey, shh… it’s okay baby… you’re gonna have a great time! Look, you hear all those giggles? You’re going to be laughing as soon as you're there bug. You’ll be okay, I pinky promise,” Tony comforted, rubbing circles on Peter’s back as his boy cried into his arms. His heart broke seeing his son cry, but he knew that he couldn’t hide Peter away forever; it was time for him to leave the nest a little bit.
“Good job Betty! Inside voices though please,” Steve praised with a smile as he wrote a big ‘B’ on the board. “Next letter is B! B is for: Bee!”
The next morning went smoother than the day before and Peter was at school a little bit early. “Alright baby, I’ll see you at 2,” Tony said with a smile, kissing Peter’s cheek.
Tony awed quietly as he wiped Peter’s tears away, his heartstrings tugging at Peter’s words. “Oh baby… they’re gonna love you bug. You’ll make so many friends too!! And I’ll miss you a lot buddy, but I’ll see you as soon as it’s over and we’ll go out to get ice cream together. How does that sound?” he comforted softly.
Steve smiled as he put the backpack in Peter’s blue cubby. His dad seemed nice - not to mention handsome. He made his way around the classroom, making sure everybody was happy in their table groups.
Peter and his group of friends lined up as directed. Harry was at the front of the line, followed by Ned, Peter, and then MJ. Everybody else in the class was lined up behind them. Steve smiled and reminded them to be quiet in the hallway before they left the class. They made their way to the gym, where a man with short blonde hair and a bandage across his nose stood with a basketball. The class piled into the gym, all of them sitting on the floor as a group.
“Lizards are pretty cool too! I like elephants the mostest,” Peter shared with Harry; Harry had been telling him all about how he loved lizards, but his dad wouldn’t let him.
“Alright, Little Red Riding Hood tonight Pete. How does that sound?” Tony hummed softly as he made his way back to Peter’s bed. He nudged his son’s leg over a little bit before climbing into bed next to him.
“Oh… more slides for us then!!” Peter laughed. He played around on the monkey bars for a while before climbing the playground to slide down the long slide.After reaching the top of the slide, Peter crouched down to sit. Before he even knew what was happening. He was pushed to the side by Flash, who went down the slide without a second glance at Peter.
Steve came over and gave an exaggerated gasp when he saw the paper completely colored in. “Wow! Awesome Petey!!” He compliments before making his way to the front of the class. “Alright everybody! We’re gonna head down to the gym and you’ll all get to meet Coach Barton!” Steve shared. “Everyone get in a single file line in front of the door - careful! No pushing please!”
Peter nodded as he stood up. “Yeah! Flash probably just didn’t see me,” he shrugged. Without any worries, he slid down the slide with Ned right behind him. “Ned, wanna play soccer?” he asked, spotting a soccerball about 10 feet away on the grass.
With that, Peter ran to the play set with about half of the class. “Where’s MJ going?” he asked Ned curiously.
“Hey hey, none of that baby. G is really high!! I’m very proud of you,” Tony reassured as they got to the car.
Smiling a little bit at the reassurance, Peter continued sharing his day. “After ABCs we had lunch!! I sat with Ned and MJ and Harry and Liz and Betty and Flash!!”
Peter gave a small nod of his head as he climbed over into his dad’s lap. Usually he was content with sitting next to him, but he had been particularly clingy the entire weekend as the anticipation for the start of school drew nearer. Tony smiled and pressed a soft kiss to the top of Peter’s fluffy brown curls before he started to read.
“You didn’t.” Thor said at the same time Loki said “Well you did.” The two gods shared a glare then Thor turned to the mortals.
“Well...yeah!” Tony answered throwing his shoulders back. Now Steve gaped like a fish. “Steve you don’t have to hide it! I mean everyone knows!”
Loki had not left his blue form in awhile. Tony had made overtures to talk to Loki in order to try and calm him, to no avail. As more time passed, Tony began to truly believe what Loki had already cemented in his head. Thor was sleeping with the humans and Odin approved.
“No man.” Sam cut in “We’ve been talking you up.” Clint nodded eagerly in agreement with Sam. “But we can’t always do that.”
“This is for the best, the less people who know the better.” Natasha advised again. “We’ll all go into the labyrinth, but instead of killing Asterion we’ll get him to freedom. Once he’s free we’ll dirty our weapons with the corpses still in the labyrinth.”
“They already know him. He has a relationship with them.” Loki explained and Tony sputtered nonsense while Amora scoffed.
After the play Tony and Steve walked in a garden behind the theatre. Most people exitted the theatre out to the street so they were alone. As they walked the grounds, both of them gushed and made comments about the performance and different variations of the story they had heard.
Months later, Tony asked Steve if he wanted to move in before the wedding. Steve dodged the question. It was brought up again by Happy, who asked if Steve wanted to use his relator to sell his apartment. Steve took the number but never called.
Steve hit it off right away with Happy Hogan, Pepper Potts, Bruce Banner, and Janet Van Dyne. James Rhodes took a bit more time to warm up to Steve. Rhodey has always been protective of Tony and he could probably already see what Tony himself was denying at this point; therefore he was hesitant to give an instant welcome to the guy Rhodey knew Tony would eventually give his heart to. However, Steve did eventually gain Rhodey’s approval and friendship.
They walked through the city more and by nightfall they were walking along the beach. They had spent a majority of the day in each other’s company talking, laughing, and occasionally lapsing into comfortable silences. Well Steve interpreted them as comfortable silences, Tony interpreted them as time to think of new conversation topics.
“Afternoon everyone.” Phil greeted as he and Betty walked into the dining room where all the Avengers and Tony were having lunch.
“Thor won’t let you get away with this.” Phil spoke up. “Robbing his friends of their abilities forever won’t go unanswered.”
4. And yes Loki did all that research in order to find a way to earn Tony his freedom. He hid it all in his chambers because A) In order to research without constantly being hovered over and B) Protect Tony, so Tony wouldn’t get his hopes up or go crazy with research (it did take Loki about 9ish yrs to figure out).
Everything Tony had done was for nothing. The Avengers weren’t sleeping with Thor. Once the year finished out, Tony wouldn’t be getting his freedom but would be going back to Hel and doing whatever tasks Loki and himself could think up to earn it.
After that, New Thebes city which had already embraced their new-found heroes, began to not just embrace them but celebrate them. An old colosseum style theatre was reworked into a training yard for the heroes. Before the heroes were given beds in the barracks with the city’s guards. Now they were given a modest home for all of them to share.
Thinking of that sent Tony on another spiral. Did any regular people know about Thor and Loki’s tiff? Or was it not known so regular people still assumed they are together and happy? Did the Avengers even know? Or do they just not care, since they’re bedding the god themselves?
“I will not let Loki dwell in these thoughts. This madness must stop and we will stop it. Here and now!” Thor declared.
2 months later the weekend of Jan’s fashion show arrived. Steve and a few friends flew there in Jan’s jet and the rest flew with Tony in his jet. When Steve and Tony first saw each other again at Jan and Hank’s place they were respectful and courteous. Steve tried not to let the fact that Tony had dark circles under his eyes which he had obviously tried to hide, get to him and Tony tried to ignore that Steve’s running shows that they had bought just before the break up, looked as if they were on their last leg.
“This is how you knew.” Steve stated, not posing it as a question. “This is what you used to plan for battle and how you knew the enemies terrain.”
Their mutual friends still spoke to each other but Rhodey and Bucky never interacted with Steve or Tony, respectively. The weekly meet ups still occurred though never at Tony’s mansion, and never with Steve or Tony in attendance. It was odd, Clint and Tony still talked and hung out but Steve was never brought up. Steve still spoke with Pepper and went to Museums with her but Tony was never discussed.
““Why are you sleeping with Thor?” What would make you say that?” Steve asked in a genuinely curious tone while he cocked his head to the side.
“My GODS!” Loki barked with another cruel laugh. “He’s manipulated you! I thought I raised you to be smarter than when you first came to me!”
“Hey Tones.” Rhodey cut in and knocked the brunette with his tail. “Can we get a drink? I’m about to keel over.”
Tony shook his head then cocked it to the side and stared at the woman. A smile filled to the brim with amusement was on his face.
“FOCUS!” Tony yelled, startling both Steve and Thor. “Don’t kill him! He’s just following orders. We need you to scare him.”
Once Steve breached the entrance the King smiled and the Queen looked pained. Tony looked unimpressed and scoffed. Steve tried to give Tony a reassuring face but the brunette wouldn’t look at him.
“I did!” Steve smiled back at her, then he cringed remembering the end of the date. “Till I stuck my foot in my mouth.”
No one answered, instead everyone’s eyes turned to Steve who did a sweeping glare then walked over to stand in front of Tony. The brunette quirked an eyebrow and Steve took an audible gulp.
Bucky’s whole world stopped for just a moment at the mention of his best friend. They were targeting Steve. Whoever this was, they were working with Tony and targeting Steve for something.
“Can’t hear you blueberry, you’re mumbling.” Tony scolded from his spot and Loki turned to him and Amora.
They made it to the theatre and were able to grab some mixed nuts and drinks to share during the performance. The play told the story of Odin rising up against his tyrannical mother (Bestla) and all her kin, the dreaded Jotunns.
Loki had also given Thor a new rule, he must send a message of his arrival rather than come down unannounced. Thor had questioned it, but Loki had waived him off saying he needed to organize his work better and this would help him in his time management. And so, once they received word of Thor’s upcoming arrival Tony would move from his room in the palace to a room with Rhodey in the area of Hel where the monsters and creatures under Loki’s employ stayed.
Thor wrapped Loki in an embrace and tried to sooth his brother. Loki didn’t look happier but he stopped trying to run. He walked away with Thor who thanked all his friends for their help. Once he and Loki were in a car, driving home Tony turned to Steve and apologized.
Tony averted his eyes and tried to shake his head “You don’t understand…” Steve cupped both sides of his face.
“Actually I’m glad you're here.” Tony confessed. Loki tilted his head so Tony continued. “I have news.”
“No.” Clint barked with a laugh of disbelief. “There’s no...call, or whatever. He’s a god! He just shows up.”
Steve watched the man do an awkward run out of the room. He then took a moment to take all his small clothes off and moved them along with their chitons onto the floor and away from them.
Steve now looked extremely frustrated. With a huff he yanked Tony closer then twisted the man and threw Tony over his shoulder.
“Makes sense.” Happy said, then let out a happy sigh of relief. “I’m just glad Pepper came and got you to not go in again.”
Loki simmered in his anger, icicles forming quickly all around the room. Thor had sided with that mortal over him, had mentioned that mortal and his friends in their bed, had undoubtedly slept with him, and now that same mortal was interfering in his work.  This Steve Rogers had to die!
“Actually it’s not that long.” Tony cut in, Steve gaped at him but Tony ignored the blonde. He then took on a look of pure determination. “I was working for Loki to kill the Avengers.”
“Steve, James.” Thor clapped a hand on the ethereal man’s shoulder. “This is Abraham Erskine. He is a mortal that was awarded the honor of being the first mortal to ever visit Asgard.” Erskine gave a smile and Thor took on an apologetic look. “However we were not aware of what would happen to mortals that stay in Asgard for an extended period.”
Once the Ferry pulled up alongside the bank, the Avengers boarded and were met by the female shade. However, before anyone could begin talking a loud bang was heard as a hulking ogre clumbered out of the captains quarters.
Amora’s hackles rose as did her shoulders. “You will be silent! If I could ensnare you then I’d force your mouth shut!”
Loki let out a huge sigh as he slumped into his throne. The mortals were in the midst of a rather large war, involving many different countries or colonies or whatever the mortals called their self made borderlands. The death toll was enormous and thus his job went from mundane to rigorous in trying to account and place all of them. Loki let out another sigh as his mind briefly fantasized about leaving this dreary place. Hel was many things but dreary was the most common adjective that one would use to describe it.
“Not a superstar.” Steve laughed lightly. “And it’s a statue of my friend.” He eventually answered as he made to help Tony up. The brunette gave him a raised eyebrow then got on the horse by himself.
The ogre was about the size of Bruce when he Hulked out. However his jaw was wider set and his two bottom scissor teeth poked out of his mouth due to their large size. He was heavy set but muscular. Overall he was an imposing figure. However that was diminished by the fact that he looked extremely relieved at the sight of them.
“Little shit.” Bucky teased. “You’re lucky I’m still willing to help you.” Bucky got up and went to get into a new, clean, outfit. “Plus I owe Tony an apology. A real one.”
Steve, however, could. As the blonde didn’t respond. The only indication he even heard Tony was that his eyes crinkled and he frowned.
“Asgard is the birthplace of the gods, Steven. It’s water has mystical properties. I have used it before and seen it’s results. It will change your body into that of the perfect soldier boy.”
“He begged for another chance at life but these things come with a hard price.” Loki stood at the end of his throne and gave Howard a hard glare. “One this mortal appears willing to pay.”
Steve dipped his head down in embarrassment and scratched the small hairs at the back of his neck. Sam and Bucky were still speaking but their voices became background noise as he caught the eyes of the brunette man they rescued. He looked to be fiddling with this chiton and gave Steve a small smile then turned back to his shoulder. Wordlessly Steve strode past Sam and made his way over to the man; whom continued to fiddle with his chiton.
“Yeah that’s the other part. See Bruce was cursed, and before you ask, no I don’t know by who or what, all I know is the guy is cursed. Anytime he gets angry he turns into the Hulk, but other than property damage he hasn’t hurt anybody. At least not too badly.” He shrugged.
Howard gasped as he automatically sprung back only to hit a wall as he did so. Looking around him he noted it was a city wall. The city wall of his home. Gasping in shock Howard looked all around and noticed he was no longer a gray shade but back in his body. Not only  that, he was outside his city gates. Loki had given him life and transported him home. He looked at the scroll in his hand and unfurled it.
“Howard Stark,” Loki began as he sat upon his throne. “You are an inventor. You have been creating new ways for your side to overtake your enemy. You died because an arrow hit your horse causing you to fall off the cliff side. Your soul is tied to your parents who are both deceased, a brother who has passed, a wife, and a son....You appear to keep your soul free from most ties. You don’t let people get close to you, do you?”
“He’s a hindrance. You should have gone with my plan, then we wouldn’t need to worry about him.” Amora continued. “Now we know they have someone who can tell them all our secrets and we can’t harm him.”
“How can you say he’s fine? Did you see the bags under his eyes?! His nightmares are probably keeping him up again and no one’s there!”
“I have brought this great hero here to help you Steven.” Thor explained as he walked over to the blonde. “The Falcon has experience in heroics and has accomplished heroic deeds. I thought his advice would be most helpful to you.”
“Can be used like a battering ram when he grows. Or he can shrink and slip through your fingers when you think you have a hold on him.” Tony rattled off then turned back and walked faster towards the temple.
Loki’s eyes were wide and his mouth hung open in devastation as he swayed back a few steps. Tony made to reach out to him also looking pained.
Clint and Natasha gave the god a strained smile. In the background Bucky and Sam were trying to comfort Steve who had spiraled into full on panic.
Painful did not even begin to describe it. He’d broken bones before, he’d had bruises, and bleed heavily before, but nothing had
Loki immediately stiffened and blue began to creep over his body. “What.” His tone was ice and the room began to drop in temperature. “Was that name, again?”
Rhodey shook his head and surveyed the Avengers. He stopped at Steve. Steve had an absolutely smitten look on his face as he watched Tony laugh and smile. He then saw the moment Tony locked eyes with Steve. Tony blushed. It was light and he pushed it down a second later but Rhodey saw it.
“And all of it was for nothing!" She sneered. "I am still going to kill them! You didn’t do anything but delay it!”
Howard then shuffled the conversation back to reclaiming Peggy’s life. They decided that tomorrow Steve and Bucky would go to Hel to try and get Peggy’s soul back. Howard had argued the blonde should go alone but Bucky was not going to let Steve traverse the underworld alone.
And so life went on. From adventure to adventure, there was never a dull moment. Though there were quiet ones.
“YOU INSOLENT-!” Amora ranted and threw insults but stopped abruptly when she noticed black mist pour out of the heros.
“You don’t scare me, no matter what form you take. You’ve never scared me.” She whispered back then gave him a firm look “And next time you try to decide what’s best for me, DON’T.” Bruce ducked his head in guilt but nodded in agreement.
“Yeah and when this is done you can be free too.” Tony joked but it fell flat as Rhodey only glared at him in response. Tony groaned and dragged a hand down his face. “Come on Rhodeybear.”
“Dad please! Please! I wanna go home!” Tony begged, crying and trying to latch onto Howard. Howard gave a choked sob and grabbed Tony in for a tight hug. Tony then began to relax but immediately stiffened as Howard began prying his hands and arms off himself. “Dad? DAD!” Howard was mummering apologies as he continued to pry Tony off himself. “DAD PLEASE!”
“Poor baby Thor, made to carry such a burden that he must walk into the libraries of the world.” Loki mocked.
Tony’s eyes widened as his brain temporarily shut down and all the blood drained from his face. He had said that out loud?!
The two had a small glaring contest which was interrupted by Clint letting out a long and loud frustrated groan.
Then when Steve and Tony were out to lunch one day they met Thor Odinson. The three became fast friends. Thor was unbelievable! A man that shouldn’t exist in this world but somehow did. He was free with his affection, stronger than any person Steve or Tony had ever met, and was so generous he made Tony feel stingy. Steve and Tony knew they had to show Thor off to their friends and thus both friend groups finally converged.
Tony waited a good five minutes before opening the door and checking the Avengers had left. He then crept over to the cliff side and peaked over to verify they were walking away.
“Offer them a deal Loki.” Thor pushed, coming up to Loki’s side. “They should at least be able to try. They have braved Hel after all, they deserve something.”
Peggy looked into Steve’s eyes for some time then smiled and pressed a kiss to his cheek. She then turned to Bucky and gave him a kiss on the cheek as well.
“Thor?” Tony gapped, amazed at the prospect of meeting one of the most powerful gods. “Thor the god of Thunder and Fertility?”
“You’re right.” Bucky admitted seriously. “Steve and I,” the brunette slapped an arm on the blonde’s shoulder. “Talked this morning and it really cleared a lot of things up. I was taking stuff out on Tony unfairly. I owe him a few apologies.”
“Stop stop! It’s obvious you all are close, and your friendships are important to Steve. I mean you guys have tagged along on all our dates, save the first one.”
Thor rolled his eyes “You could have just told me up front you want me to go fetch this...whatever it is.”
After being let into the city, Howard ignored all the questions people threw at him regarding why he was here, how was the war going, and how he returned. Instead he ran to his house where Maria ran to greet him. They kissed and Howard held her, just wanting to feel her. Tony then came running into the house, having ditched his lessons with the other children when he learned his father was back.
“Ste-eve…”  Sam’s voice broke as he also cried. But the blonde just continued to cling to Tony and chant pleas for him to be alive.
“Clints right.” Steve spoke briskly, commanding everyone's attention. Everyone turned to the small blonde, who raised his head and squared his shoulders. “We need to get Jörmungandr focused on us and not on the people in the city.” Steve strode over so he was in front of everyone.
King Minos went to answer but Tony barrelled over him and now looked towards the guards who were watching him.
“This isn’t comfortable.” Tony grunted “So yes!” He grunted again as he strained to get free from Ty’s grip. “But I can handle it!” He finished throwing Steve a smile “Have a nice day.” He dismissed.
“Lord Loki has transported us to the Field of Content Souls.” She explained then made a ‘follow me’ gesture. “Come along with me.”
2. Tony thinks the Avengers are overrated wanna-be-in Valhalla tools and Loki straight up hates all of them.
“Tony dead mortals from all walks of life gather in this realm. You have a world of knowledge at your feet. How can you possibly be bored when you have yet to even explore that!”
“Well,” Bucky hedged, “Then get to know us.” Erksine raised a skeptical eyebrow at Bucky’s eagerness. “Steve is the best man I know. You get to know him and you’ll agree.”
“That’s why I’ll be with them.” Tony explained. At Thor’s confused face the mortal elaborated. “If anyone working for Loki hurts me then they get their strength back. So Jörmungandr will avoid touching me as a precaution. If he gets too close to any of them, I’ll jump in between.”
They all talked for a bit longer then the travelers said they had to get moving if they wanted to make it to the Travelers Shelter before nightfall (an outpost building between towns that gave coverage for rainfall). All the Avengers shared a look at these words then offered up their carriage for them to use.
Suddenly a loud and long hiss penetrated the gorge, setting everyone on edge. Tony tightened his hold on the blue cape. Meanwhile the 5 heroes and gathered crowd turned their attention to the dark abyss. Amora used the distraction to slip away and up to where Loki was, and Loki leaned forward in his makeshift seat in anticipation.
“No he’s not.” The sheepish brunette let out a deep sigh “I owe you an apology, several actually.” Bucky then squared his shoulders and looked Tony right in the eyes. “I’m sorry. I took a lot of stuff out on you when I shouldn’t have. I blew small things out of proportion and made drama where there wasn’t any.” He threw out his arms, “I screwed up and I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve any of that and all I can do is apologize.”
“I wish I knew my friend.” Thor said and place a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “I wish I knew how this all started...” Everyone again nodded in agreement.
Pepper or Virginia Potts was a shade Tony had met in the Field of Content Souls. Amora was actually to blame for their meeting. She had learned Tony did not like spending a lot of time with shades due to them bringing up his father. So of course she sent him on a fetch quest in the Field of Content Souls. He was to get a bracelet she had “accidentally” dropped there. It was a pain in the ass but eventually he found the bracelet thanks to Pepper. She led him to where she saw the bracelet but only after he answered her questions. She then began to seek him out in Hel. She was curious about him and in her own words
So now the 5 all traveled towards the Monster Bog. An area in Greece where most of the monsters of their world gathered. Many people wishing to test their might traveled into the swampland, only to never emerge or to run from it in horror.
“Take this off.”  He demanded as his hand already began trying to help shimmy the material off the blonde.
Tony was already in the bedroom, picking out an outfit for Peter to wear; he had given Rhodey the task of packing Peter’s bag and making sure he had lunch and snacks. “Alright buddy, let’s get you into some clothes,” Tony said, mainly to himself as Pepper set Peter on his bed. Tony had pulled out Peter’s overall jeans and a red sweater with black sneakers. He brought the clothes over next to Peter, whose eyes welled up with tears. “No Daddy!!” he cried, pushing the clothes off of the bed.
Peter grinned at that idea. His plan was to just make it through the day and then the second Tony was there for him, he’d make sure he never went back. Who else would keep his daddy busy in the lab all day?! Peter was practically a professional by now. “Can you sleep with me tonight?” he added hopefully. Peter threw in his infamous puppy eyes too - Daddy could never withstand them.
MJ shrugged, her nose busy in a book. “Tigers. Obviously,” she stated simply before going back to her book.
The bell rang and as the elevator doors opened, Peter was hit with the loud sound of AB/CD… or maybe it was AC/DC? Peter had no clue. He didn’t see his Daddy anywhere, so he ventured in a little further. He figured Tony was somewhere over by one of the cars, but a big shiny metal thing on one of the tables caught his eye. “Oooh!” he gasped as he climbed up on a stool. Peter’s hand reached out to touch and at the same time he heard his dad’s voice.
“I don’t wanna go tomorrow…” Peter mumbled shyly, tears slipping down his cheeks. “W-What if they don’t like me? What if I don’t make any friends? A-And I’ll miss you… I-I don’t wanna go, I wanna stay with you…”
“That’s right angel! Let’s get ice cream. You still want ice cream? We’ll get ice cream, it’s decided,” Tony answered with a smile. He felt awful for having to yell at Peter; hopefully ice cream could make up for it. “What are you thinking? Chocolate? Vanilla?”
Peter shot up from his seat, dragging Ned with him. “Come on Ned!! We’re gonna play on the slides and swings!!’
“Wow Petey!! That’s really big!! Can you count for me?” Tony praised, wanting Peter distracted for a moment as he tried to buckle him in. Peter nodded eagerly and Tony smiled, setting Peter in his booster seat as he started counting.
Tony smiled to himself when he heard Steve’s voice. “Steve! I wasn’t expecting you to call so late. What’s up?”
“Hey buddy, you’re alright, you’re okay,” Steve comforted softly. “You’re Daddy is gonna be here soon alright? Real soon.”
After he was set back down, Peter made work of picking out his outfits. He pulled out a red and blue t-shirt, purple shorts, and hideous bright yellow sneakers. For his 5th birthday, Tony had promised to get him anything at the mall; of course his son would choose the worst shoes to ever be made. Tony cringed as he helped Peter change. The outfit was a horrible combination but he didn’t have the heart to discourage anything Peter did on such a big day.
The ride to the school went relatively smoothly; the traffic wasn’t too bad and Happy wasn’t getting any road rage. Since Happy was at the wheel, Tony was sitting in the back with Peter. Speaking of which, the little boy hadn’t stopped talking the entire car ride, his feet swinging back and forth from his booster seat. “And-And then the spaceman jumped outta the rocket ship!! And he had a space puppy too!! Isn’t that cool Daddy?!” Peter rambled as he talked about a show he had watched the other day.
“Thank you Steve,” he thanked again. “I’ll be back at 2 then.” With one last look at Peter, Tony smiled and left the school. He knew his son would fit right in.
“Pete, we don’t push things,” Tony sighed softly. “Come on, let’s go.” With that, he picked Peter back up and brought him over to the wardrobe. He should’ve known that Peter would want to pick out his own clothes, no matter how horrible his son’s fashion choices were. Peter sniffed and wiped his tears with the back of his hand, the other hand wrapped tightly in a fist around Tony’s Black Sabbath t-shirt.
“Yeah, yeah,” he rolled his eyes again with a smile. “So, do you think you wanna head back to school tomorrow?”
Peter sat in the nurse’s office, tears streaming down his cheeks and hiccuping every second between breaths.
Peter beamed happily and jumped up and down. The idea of school suddenly seemed to be amazing, mainly since Tony had promised him he’d be okay. His Daddy would never make a promise that he couldn’t keep - especially if it was a pinky promise.
Before they could keep making plans, Steve was getting everybody’s attention at the front of the room. “Alright guys!! Let’s get started. I’m Mr. Rogers, your teacher, and I think we’re going to have a great year together,” he said confidently with his bright smile. He then grabbed a pile of papers and started to pass them out. They all had the print of a rainbow on them but they weren’t colored in; the kids were going to be coloring in the pictures. “We’re going to learn about colors!!” Steve shared excitedly.
Tony grinned at that and waved lightly. “Alright, thank you. I’ll see you later then.” And with that, Tony left the classroom.
For the next hour, the class spent time learning the colors of the rainbow and coloring inside the lines of the picture. Peter did a pretty good job staying inside the lines. “Mr. Rogers!! Look! I colored the rainbow,” he exclaimed proudly.
Tony chuckled as he entered the room, plopping down on the opposite side of the couch that Rhodey was sitting on so that Peter was between them. “Gosh Rhodes, don’t you know anything about Paw Patrol? Jeez,” he teased, rolling his eyes. “Uncle Rhodey’s gonna have to catch up, right Pete?”
Peter gladly accepted the offer, running immediately to Tony’s arms. “I-I just wanted to find you! I woke up a-and you weren’t there and I-I didn’t know where you were so I-I thought you would be down here and then I saw the pretty thingy b-but then you were here a-and I’m sorry!” He rambled as he cried, tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Pinky promise,” Tony said firmly, linking his pinky with Peter’s. Peter smiled at that and Tony used his suit sleeve to wipe away Peter’s tears. Most people would never let a thousand dollar suit be used as a tissue, but Tony wasn’t like most parents (okay yes, he is rich but moral of the story being that he’d do anything for his son).
“1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14… um… 14… 15! 15, 16, 17!!!” Peter completed confidently as Tony finished getting him buckled.
“They’re great Tony, thank you. I’m loving the new AC down on the parts,” Rhodey replied with a laugh. “Is squirt ready for his first day of school?”
“Alright guys! I’m Coach Barton! We’re gonna have a fun time in the gym today, what do you guys say?” Clint said with an upbeat voice.
Peter nodded, smiling a little at the idea of getting ice cream. He was never allowed to have ice cream before dinner, but his dad had promised him to get him ice cream after school. “Do I have to go? Can’t I stay with you?” He tried again.
“Okay Daddy!” Peter answered happily, wiggling to get down from his tall seat. He was grateful when Tony was quick to pick him up; he probably would’ve fallen otherwise.
“Thanks Hap,” he said with a smile as he stepped out. Tony walked around the side of the car and opened up Peter’s door while Happy waited against the passenger door. “Alright buddy, let’s get you inside,” Tony hummed as he unbuckled Peter and set him on the pavement. He grabbed Peter’s backpack from the floor of the car and swung it over his shoulder before taking Peter’s small hand in his. “Say bye bye to Happy!” he said to Peter.
“We gotta go bug,” Tony explained as Peter pouted with his arms crossed, upset that he didn’t get to see what Rhodey had made for him. “Shush, don’t give me that look... now give Uncle Rhodey and Aunt Pepper kisses before we leave,” he instructed softly.
“Good job bug!! I’m so proud of you,” Tony praised with a hum, pressing a kiss to Peter’s forehead before walking around the car and getting in on his side. “Alright Hap, ice cream time!!”
Peter giggled and nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah! And MJ and Harry can come over too!! We can have a playdate!!” he decided. Peter loved his new group of friends; they were so cool!!
Tony smiled, kneeling down as Peter came running towards him faster than his little feet could carry him. His son collided into him, hugging him tightly with a giggle. “Daddy! Daddy hi!! Hi!! I did school!! And colored! And we-we had gym!! And counted!! And I made friends!! Ned and MJ a-and Harry!!” Peter rambled excitedly, making Tony laugh softly.
He got about 2 pages in and Peter was already snoring softly. Pressing a kiss to his son’s forehead, he left the room with the door open a crack. He was beyond happy that Peter was actually looking forward to school now.
The entire kindergarten class cheered happily. Peter’s hand was shot up in the air, wiggling his fingers so that Coach Barton would definitely see him.
“Let’s go big guy,” Tony hummed as he took Peter’s hand, leading him back to the kitchen with Pepper in tow. “Look at that, Rhodes made you some snacks!” Peter’s eyes lit up and he ran over to Rhodey. He nearly gave his dad a heart attack as he tripped on a stray toy, hands in front of him to help break his fall. Thankfully, his hands hit Rhodey’s legs first, who had come to the rescue the second he saw Peter stumble.
Peter sniffed softly and nodded, slipping his thumb into his mouth. “Blankie,” he mumbled, pointing to the quilt on the ground.
Tony woke up around 7 the next morning, Peter no longer in his arms. In a slight moment of panic, Tony sat up abruptly. His eyes scanned the room for his sweet boy, his heart rate rising when he wasn’t in sight. “Peter?” he called frantically. He threw the covers off, nearly tripping over his own feet as he ran out of the room.
- “My stake-out food, leave me alone.” Steve chuckled. It was a nice sound. “Alright. Throw one.” He wiggled his eyebrows. Steve did, and he caught it.
- “Because they like the little girls, but don’t know how to say it. All of this, is your elaborate way to flirt.”
- “Manhattan Bridge ? We met on the Brooklyn Bridge !” He seemed focused on Tony, but from the corner of his eye he noticed the second guy coming in and watching them.
- “It could be worse.” Said gently Bruce, patting his shoulder. “Why is your shirt wet, Tony ?” He frowned.
- “Updates. Any progress ?” He smirked. And watched as Steve took a handful of peanuts and threw them in the air, caughting by miracle 2 of them. He laughed. “You’re terrible.”
- “I’m sad yall arrested me… But I gotta say, I’m glad you back together.” The first guy said. The second nodded. He exchanged a look with Tony, and tried not to burst out laughing.
- “No, no wait !” Clint raised his hands. “I may not kill you, but I may end up your bad luck. Here, take the rabbit foot.”
- “You can’t bet your car !” Clint whined. “It’s too beautiful to be in the hands of Steve, I saw you drive !”
Steve was always surprised about Tony’s car. He was the son of a rich, super rich dude. He was probably rich too. But no, his car was an old one, and not even a “vintage” one, just an old one. It was still a pretty sweet car, he wasn’t going to lie, but still. Not something Steve would expect of Tony Stark.
But right when they were about to toast to thanksgiving (with a sour-looking Tony), Bruce’s phone went off. He went to pick up, and came back a minute later.
- “Disaster after disaster, we can’t have that. You’ll digitize files until your luck..” He threw a look at the rabbit’s foot, still on his desk. “Turns.” He turned around and went in his office.
He frowned, and took out the binoculars from in front of his eyes to look at Steve. He wasn’t trying to make a joke, he was sincere. Oh well.
- “Ridiculous. You’re just… That’s ridiculous now.” He huffed and went away, strolling at his desk and trying to finally get a case done.
- “You know, Tony, you should just tell him you like him.” The man was smiling softly, and took a sip of his drink.
- “Nope, going to cut you there Rogers, it’s a garbage holiday that I don’t even celebrate, but someone-” He glared at Fury who acted like nothing was going on. “Decided that I had to go. Team spirit and all. So I’m going, but I won’t “dress up”. He smiled. “In fact, it’s quite dumb to dress up. The whole purpose of it is to eat, so we should just wear sweatpants.”
- “You !” The guy in question, startled and looked at Tony like he was the reincarnation of fucking Gabriel or whatnot.
I don't know what to think of what I write for this fanfic, it's mostly dialogue and interactions, but I still hope you like it !
- “Five… Four… Three..” Began counting down Stark, looking at his watch with the biggest grin. The whole squad assembled, and Clint even bringed the board where the score had been updated.
“Love ya too bug,” Tony chuckled as he knelt to hug Peter. “I’ll be here as soon as school is over,” he promised.
“I’m going to school today! Daddy says that I’m a big boy for going and he pinky promised me that I get ice cream after school!” Peter rambled, not even noticing that Pepper was now wiping his face with a wet towel. “Really? That’s awesome, wow!” she replied, picking him up again and making her way to his room.
“Wow! That’s a pretty cool animal,” Steve agreed. “How about we get you a seat, alright? I think you can sit over there next to Ned.” He pointed to a pudgier boy wearing a Star Wars t-shirt. The boy, Ned, was sitting at a table with a girl with frizzy brown hair and a boy with glasses. Ned saw his teacher pointing to him and he smiled widely, waving to Peter.
Peter giggled as he took red construction paper, cutting it roughly into the shape of a butterfly. Then he cut out little circles from the gold-ish yellow color. He started glueing the circles onto the butterfly with a happy smile, planning to give it to Tony since they were his favorite colors.
Steve smiled and once the class was lined up, he took them outside. “Alright, everybody be nice to each other please; no horseplay and if you have any issues, please come to me,” he explained seriously. “Now go have fun!”
7 minutes later, Tony looked over at Peter to see what he was up to. Sure enough, Peter was fast asleep in his booster seat, drooling a little on his shirt. “Hey Happy, pipsqueak is asleep; how about we just head home, we’ll get ice cream some other time.”
Steve smiled and took the backpack. “Please, call me Steve. And I’ll put this in his cubby. Don’t even worry about it.”
“Eh, sorta. He’s a little nervous that he won’t make any friends and that he’ll miss me too much,” Tony answered, shrugging a little. “But I told him he doesn’t have to go again if he doesn’t want to after today. But I know he’ll love it, he’s gonna meet so many kids and my bug is going to be friends with everybody, I can promise you that,” he added proudly, beaming at his son. Peter’s cheeks flushed bright pink at Tony’s praise.
Peter nodded and moved to stand. The action only brought more pain and when he looked down, he could see why; he had sprained his ankle.
Happy’s stern demeanor dropped as he knelt down in front of Peter, giving him a small smile to cheer him up. “Awe bud, don’t be sad! You’re dad and I will get you at 2 pm sharp, okay?”
Tony rolled his eyes halfheartedly. “Uh huh… anything to distract my kid from getting ready for school,” he joked. As they bantered, Peter ran into the room having heard Pepper’s voice. “Auntie Pep!!” he squealed as he ran into her legs, hugging her tightly.
Peter seemed pretty pleased with that response, happy that his gym teacher was okay. The rest of the class was spent playing a bunch of games - all of them were silly made up games that Clint had made himself. At the end of the class period, most of the class was sweaty from running around: except for MJ. MJ spent gym class reading a book against the wall. Steve rounded the class back up and then they were on their way back to the classroom.
Peter let out an excited squeal, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and giving him a tight hug. Steve sat shocked for a minute before lightly hugging back - he really wasn’t supposed to hug kids at all but he didn’t want to hurt Peter’s feelings by not hugging back at all. Peter let go and ran off to grab his backpack from his cubby as other kids started to leave once they saw their parents. There was a light knock on against the door frame, causing Peter to look up. At that exact moment, a huge smile broke out on his face. “Daddy!!”
It was later that night when Tony was sitting on the couch with Peter in his lap watching Cinderella that his phone buzzed. “I’ll be right back baby,” he whispered to his son, pressing a soft kiss to his curls. Of course, Peter gave a simple nod back in response, way too invested in the movie. After setting Peter onto the couch cushion, Tony grabbed his phone and made his way to the kitchen so that he didn’t disturb the movie. “Hello?” he answered softly.
“Hey Ms. Hill, I’m Tony Stark and I’m here with my son Peter. It’s his first day of school and he’s supposed to be in Mr. Rogers’ class. Can you point me in that direction?” Tony asked, smiling at her. Peter noticed a bowl of candy on her desk and he tugged on Tony’s pant leg, wanting a piece.
“Y-You say not to,” his son replied quietly, climbing down from the stool and looking down at his feet.
And with that, he was walking back to his car with his son, his heart beating a little faster than any other time he had seen the teacher.
“I want my Daddy,” Peter sobbed, wrapping his arms around himself as a way to self soothe. He hadn’t stopped crying since he realized what happened to his ankle and all he wanted now was to go home.
“Excuse me, we were doing fine until you showed up Pepper,” Rhodey shot back. “Uh huh,” she called in response as she shut the bathroom door. “Alright Petey, let’s get you all clean!” she hummed, setting him on the bathroom counter before wetting a towel.
