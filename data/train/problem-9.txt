After the first few tentative months they'd finally stopped fretting over every ache and pain Sherlock felt, now almost accepting that the pregnancy would reach full term without any further issues.
Laying his head on Sherlock's chest, his forehead brushes against Sherlock's cheek. He's warm, and out of habit, John feels the injection site. Warm, but not dangerously so. It's just the medication taking its course. He'd have to make sure that Sherlock drank plenty of clear fluids, and ate at least one solid meal, but he'd be fine by the end of the day.
"Mm feels good, doesn't it? It's an exact model of Collin's cock. I had it made so I could fuck myself while he was away on business trips." She smirks, getting on the bed.
Releasing John’s hand, Sherlock goes up to the alter and looks around. Before finding something that resembles a necklace with a cross on, hanging off the open hand of a statue of Mary. “Is this a rosary beads?” He asks, holding it out to John.
John hums and relaxes into him. “So what do you think? I want your opinion as well, you’re my world.”
“No I’m honored. I just wanted to make sure.” Dominic smiles. “Are you going to ride me, Lee?” He asks.
Sherlock stood with his parents. He was agitated, and irritated that his parents had arranged an omega for him behind his back. He drew his coat tighter around him. "This is ridiculous..." He mumbled. "I have things to do..."
"Definitely different, loads different." John nods in amusement, head tilting back as he exaggerates the word loads.
“No more than usual. Though he did show up with a boyfriend so that was something.” Greg chuckles, happy Sherlock was doing well.
“Yes, Daddy. Love how deep you push into me. How much you fill me. Want your cum deep inside me always.”
“Good. I haven’t fucked a bitch’s cunt in years.” Darius licks his lips and pulls out of Sky’s mouth. Sky breathes hard and leans down more, presenting her holes to them like a trained heat bitch.
Dominic smiles and caresses her belly. “Hello, darling. It’s Daddy. Look at you all warm and safe in there.”
He blushes brighter and nods. “You tell them what to do to me. You decide how dirty they make me. I want to be your good boy. Your dirty used whore.”
“You think age is a bigger problem then the whole male anatomy bit?” Sherlock giggles. “They can do anything, Mycroft. Don’t worry.”
Greg nods. "Anything for you, hun.." He smiles softly. "Christ doctors really do make the worst patients.." Lydia sighs and rubs her face with her hand. John rolls his eyes.
Sherlock holds John close and kisses his face. “Good boy. Let Margaret fuck your pretty little hole and then we’ll cuddle.”
"I'm going to... Erm, finish up here." John said after a moment. "Someone should be by soon. I should be able to manage the injection on my own, but I'd rather not open the door myself. Would you mind answering?" Finding himself wanting to stare at the back of Sherlock's neck, he warms the flannel and places it back over his eyes.
John doesn't let go of Rosie as Sherlock goes to check on Mrs. Hudson. He checks to make sure she's not injured in any way before getting to his feet and picking her up. "They didn't hurt either of you?" He asks Mrs.Hudson, just to be certain.
Sherlock prances around the flat, happy to finally be home. He is going to need pain meds soon and he knows his back also needs to be tended to. He decides to limp a bit so John will check him over and help him.
“If you want to be just mates that’s fine. I’d rather have you as a friend than not at all. But I will admit that I was hoping this could be a date. The first of many dates actually.” Greg says softly.
“How did we become friends? Are you a doctor? Or in the army?” John asks. “No not with those gorgeous curls.” He hums.
"Sherlock. You don't have to do what he says." John said, gently, a hand on the man's arm. "He doesn't own you."
He presses him back against the wall, biting at his throat. "Mm anyone could walk in on us. They would see you so desperate for my cock. So needy for me to fuck your perfect arse. You love that, don't you? The thrill. The risk of being caught."
“Naturally they do but to do anything like that they’d have to practice. How do you think John makes a perfect shot every time he pulls the trigger?” She grins up at him.
“Yeah. It would explain why there are no new born baby pictures of you.” She nod, filling Sally’s glass as well. “They were probably trying to protect you.”
He blushes and nods. He soon comes back out wearing a detached dress shirt collar with a black bow tie, detached dress shirt cuffs and small tux booty shorts.
John laughed at the sight, put on his coat, grabbed the items and practically sped out the door, the events of last night forgotten.
Crystal frowns. ‘He’s stable for now. He’s gonna have to be on a transfuser through the night though.’ She sighs and checks Greg’s mouth for blood. ‘No blood in his mouth so he wasn’t forced to feed. I don’t think this was random, Myc. You don’t think Alderose and Augustus could be trying to get back at us for busting up their feeding ring, do you? Greg was the detective on scene.’
"Make yourself at home," John says. He glances over to the rocking chair and sees Thomas sitting there. He starts to sit, as he tells his parents "The furniture is a bit lumpy though. And it squeals a lot."
“Yes you can. Yes you can. You’re doing it right now. Just a bit more. You can do it. Be a good girl and give me a push.” Anthea coaches.
He smiles and looks over to John. His eyes land on John’s pulse in his neck and stares, fixated at it. “Cover your neck.” He whispers.
"Mm." Greg smiles and stands, pulling Sherlock up with him. The timer sounds for the cookies and Greg turns to take them out of the oven. When he turns he sees both John and Mycroft standing there watching them.
"It's over. Everything is going to be alright now.." Mr. Holmes holds him and rubs his back soothingly like he did when Mycroft was upset as a child.
“Mm that’s true. You’ve been a very good slut for me.” Crystal slowly gets up and walks towards him, hips swaying.
"S-some days I'm terrified it's all just a dream.. T-that it's not real.. T-then I remember that I couldn't live in a world where I wasn't with him.." Greg smooths Mycroft's hair and kisses his head gently, careful not to disturb his sleep.
“I wouldn’t have given it to you if I didn’t want you to have it.” John rolls his eyes. “I think you should read it first before you give it back to Mycroft. Everything that I told you is in there. Written in his own words. The “fairy tales” my mother would tell us were told by my great great great great great grandmother but it was Mycroft who wrote them down.” He sighs.
"Mm do you always feel the need to share my business with everyone?" Turk mumbles, eyes still closed. "Shush." Sky rolls her eyes.
"Obviously you can't bet on this, Sky." He chuckles. "But if either I or Chloe guesses it correctly, we get the entire cash pool, yeah?"
“He hasn’t asked for cock though. He just expects us to give it to him.” Eli tuts as he opens Sherlock’s trousers and frees his cock.
Margaret pulls John in and kisses him deeply. “I love you, too. I want you to be yourself with me. I don’t want you to be nervous about offending me. I’m happy and if I become unhappy I will let you know. I promise.”
Crystal lifts up her huge belly full of babies and lays it in his lap, giggling softly. “They’re so heavy daddy.”
Sherlock closes his eyes and clasps his hands in front of his chest, hoping the Preist would ignore him.
John hums. “I don’t know Kia. Why don’t you ask him?” He says, going into their bedroom. He gently kisses Sherlock awake.
"I.." He blushes and bites his lip. "I fantasized about knocking you up." He moans lowly and his cock gets harder in his mouth just thinking about it.
Sherlock finally lets John out of the shower and dries him off, looking for any irritation or rash coming off his skin but there’s nothing. Once John is mostly dry Sherlock’s scents him thoroughly before dropping to his knees and scenting John’s belly.
She hums and nods. She turns another page and smiles at a picture of her and Zack when they were little. "When we had chances to be together we were inseparable."
"What if I don't want to fake it" almost slips out before John clamps his mouth shut and just nods. Sherlock's offer was quite possibly the best offer he'd ever receive, and he didn’t want to ruin it by scaring his friend off.
“I love you brother. Why don’t you show me around? Take me somewhere quiet?” Mycroft asks, and he looks around the room and the Gods surrounding them.
Mycroft whimpers softly and leans against him. "Don't tell Sherlock about our plan for me to watch.. Tell him I went to shower if he asks.." He mutters softly.
Michael frowns a bit, wanting to just grab his clothes and go. He hesitates. "Should we wake her for the party?"
“Give it to me, John. Please. I need it. Need your cum. Fill me and plug me up.” Sherlock begs, tightening around John’s cock.
"Mm a while. It was this morning though when they both figured out the other wanted the same. They're biggest hurtle was you two, John and Greg. They were.. Hesitant about how you two would react. But they know that you both love them unconditionally no matter what so it wasn't a big deal after that.." She nods.
Camille smiles. “We barely had working machinery before I got captured, look at what you’ve all created in just a few hundred year. You’re all developing so fast.” She says as if speaking about a child at school.
Magdala watches them kiss on top of her. She rubs at their chests and stomach, digging her nails in gently.
Sky hums softly and nuzzles him. "You used to be good. What happened to you? You're hanging out with garbage and fags now." He sneers and Sky stiffens and snarls.
"I've never done that to you!" She cries and keeps walking. "I've never manipulated you. I've never tricked you. I would never do that to you. Never." She says painfully honest. "She thinks I used my abilities against you. People like her are the reason people like me don't tell anyone what they can do. We don't want to be afraid or misunderstood. We don't want to hide but it's better than feeling like this!" She yells. "She doesn't consider me yours because she doesn't think I'm human!"
“Really really. Like the ones that all the middle aged mom’s read and hide in their nightstands. I was actually pretty good at it. Wrote more than ten.”
"I'm sure they will." Greg smirks. Violet blushes brightly as she sees her sons look her over in her bra and panties.
“You poor thing. You need some nice hard dick, don’t you?” He pulls his fingers out and rubs his cock over his hole teasingly.
She whimpers, moving her finger down to rub her clit. "Yes, sir. Want your babies. They'll have huge cocks just like yours so they can keep Mummy satisfied."
"Mycroft Holmes your mother is not some delicate flower that will faint at the slightest of news. Tell me what happened to Sherlock." She says wanting to know what is going on with her youngest son.
He cries out and bites his lip. He takes a breath and pulls himself together. "Fuck me. Fill me. Use me."
He chuckles. "Either way I'd lose money. How about for us we change it to if Chloe's having a boy or a girl? I'll put my money in the pool for that."
Greg groans, his cock leaking into Riley. He taps Ms. Cheyenne’s hip, letting her know he was close.
"Should we warn Mrs. Hudson? Though the more I think about it the more I imagine she'd be thrilled to learn I'm an Omega.." John says, claiming half the sofa as his with his various pillows and blankets then climbing into his makeshift nest.
“But that’s it. You can’t be human without the bad as well as the good. You just can’t, you’d be... dead.” John sighs.
“She asks to come in. You probably didn’t hear her ask me when she came in. Being a ghost she also has telepathic abilities. So she won’t come in unless you give her permission.” Margaret nods.
“I’m trying to. I want one with Mycroft, but it’s hard. I’ve always loved him more than my husband. Why do you ask?” Magdala asks softly.
“You know this is exactly what I pictured for your brother's house. Looks like a posh prat lives here.” John nods.
Once everyone had said goodbye and everything was loaded in the car Dominic drive them to the airstrip.
He chuckles. "Oh please. You're stunning as it is. Mm brains and beauty you're a deadly gorgeous combination." He nuzzles him.
"Mmhmm. I'm growing a person and it's making very hungry. For everything." She says suggestively and licks her lips.
He fucks him hard and fast, making sure to rub his prostate each go. “Tell me when you’re about to cum. Want her to get every drop.”
He blushes brightly. "Fuck me here and full me up before we go to the club. B-But I'm not sure if I can come again.."
John sucks in some heavy breaths, trying to process everything. And after a few moments his head stops spinning and his brain comes back online. He looks up at Sherlock again. “You don’t think she… that Moriarty made her… with me…?” His eyes begin to well up a bit. He’s here, with the man he loves instead of with his new wife which is bad enough, but if he did this to them… if he married her and she was never… “Sherlock…” he pleads.
**I know you’re smarter than that. You must have some idea.—SH** “Ready?” Sally smiles as she comes back, bending over the table to get her coat.
John licks his lips and clicks his fingers as piles of ices cubes and a few flaming candles appear beside them. He picks up an ice cube and sensually runs it over Sherlock’s bare chest.
“It was wrong. It was wrong what you did. What you made me to for you. But they shouldn’t have killed you. You didn’t get a fair trial. You didn’t get any trial. Camille has always let the lives of humans hold sway over us. So many rules. So much punishment for one little slip up.” Giselle sounds a bit slurred, obviously drunk on spiked blood.
"I didn't want to wake you but I needed something inside me I didn't know what to do. So I just came in here and fucked myself on my finger. It's not the same. It's not you." He moans breathily as the rock.
"I'd love a drink, but considering I'm in a clinic, some water would be lovely." He smiles cheekily.
“Good.” He smiles softly. “I’m going to take the blindfold off now. Then I’m going to take you into the shower before we take a little nap. Okay?”
He blushes and smiles, a warm feeling spreading through him at his words and the sound of his voice. "Jake.."
Sherlock purrs and rubs his head into John's hand. Mycroft smacks Greg. "Seven.. T-thank you, Sir. Again, Sir."  Greg moans. "Slut.." Mycroft growls and hits him again. "E-eight. Thank you, Sir. Another, Sir!" Greg whimpers.
**John is not permanently deaf. We are fixing him. Sherlock, however, has cognitive problems because of his concussion. His scans are showing slowing of brain activity. His motor skills are still malfunctioning and slow. --MH**
Sky frowns and nods. “So now I’m scared. I’m scared to be vulnerable. I’m scared that I won’t be able to protect my baby.” She rests her hand on her baby bump. “I’m scared that I’ll fail again.”
"So I guess we're on our own." John says, giving him a small smile, "any exhibition you want to check out?'
Greg smiles and they put on their coats. He holds Sherlock's hand in the cab and rubs his thumb over his hand affectionately.
"All in good time, love. The chair first." He kisses his head and straightens back up. "Spread your legs for me.."
“Oh no, that’s not necessary, I’ll just send her a text. I’ll ask for a rain check and we can do it another day.” He grunted at the effort of getting out of his coat. “God, I didn’t realise how tiring it can be when your brain is trying to think so much. I don’t know how you do it,” John said, flashing Sherlock a weak smile. “Maybe the walk was a bit premature,” he added, as he lay down, resting his cane beside the bed.
"Okay. It's okay now. It was just a nightmare. When she goes out we'll make sure someone is with her at all times." John holds him close as a soft knock sounds on their closed door. "Crofty? Can I come in? Please..." Sky asks softly.
"Such a good girl.. taking our cum hours before you give birth. I think our cum will still be there when you give birth."
"Mm your going to fuck me so good aren't you? I can't wait to feel you inside me." She kisses him deeply and slowly sinks down onto his cock.
"It'll be okay." John smiles tightly and they go to the hospital. "I wasn't expecting to see any of you today." Lydia frowns when she sees them come in.
"The feeling is very mutual." She moans and arches, her legs tightening around him as she holds onto him tight.
Sally moans as Sherlock tries to get even deeper. She licks her lips as she watches Greg come, wanting to suck his cock as he’s fucked.
James rocks his hips slowly as Sky takes him deeper. “Fuck.” He gasps. John grins and kisses him back, deepening the kiss. “Mm, I’d say that’s the best time to be a gentleman.”
Sherlock gasps, it doesn't take but a few rubs to make him cum, John's words have done most of the work.
Mycroft moans, pulling gently at Greg's hair. The feelings rent from him are exquisite. He groans softly.
“Yup. See right there behind that elephants leg? That’s the mummy. And the babies are right there.” Sam nods out to the paddock.
"That's right. Be loud for me. I want to hear you." He praises as he pushes to slick fingers into him along with his tongue.
John nods. “I’ve known him all this years and I would never have guessed he would be... the son of Lucifer.” He says softly.
Sherlock groans and nods, pulling off John’s cock. “I’ll sit back against the headboard and you can hold onto it as you fuck my face.”
John hums happily and kisses him back. "Your ginger snaps are in there as well, My." Greg says and kisses Mycroft's forehead.
“Yes, good thinking. Here you take her so I can get these things.” Sherlock scoops Neriine up and passes her to John.
She smiles softly at him as he comes in. ‘Okay?’ She asks, knowing Mycroft talked to him about going home.
‘Good enough for you to breed?’ She whimpers, taking everything he gives her and feeling him nudge against her cervix.
“Oh no. My mother.. She used to make up songs all the time to get us to sleep.” Sherlock says softly as he spreads butter and jam over John’s toast.
The news has him on his feet and running over to look over her shoulder at the tablet. "And you think they're in it?" He asks, "Do you have the plate? We need to get after them."
"A projection... From my.. Minds eye.. To yours.. I showed.. You what.. I see.. Even if I'm.. Not in that place.." She has a sip of tea and gets her breathing back. "I can seek out people through the subconscious and see what they see around them. I showed you Mycroft and Sherlock because that's is what your minds eye was willing to see."  Her face is flushed and she has little beads of perspiration on her forehead.
Eli presses his cock down Sherlock’s throat, cutting off his air for a few seconds before letting off.
Sherlock chuckles and wets his fingers in her slick and pushes them into her mouth again. “I’ll go see whose arrived. They’re going to be with you one at a time. They’re your masters. They decide what’s happened and for how long. Though I will tell them to listen to you if you ask them to stop.” He smirks. “Let’s see how kinky these Gods can get when they’re free to do whatever they please.” He steps outside and is met with all the Gods, surrounding him, each other different sex toys, from dildos to orgy swings to devices to strap Morna to.
Eli smirks, snapping his hips. “I wonder how much I could stretch your cunt. Or if you could take another cock like this.”
“Easy, love.” John says softly. “If Mrs. Hudson says anything I’ll tell her that she’s my mum’s sister. I’ll tell Mrs. Hudson she must not have heard the sister bit because I was going upstairs.”
Sabine nods and without questioning, goes to the room indicated. She looks around, before deciding to run a bath for herself. She has clothes to dress in, thanks to Irene's current client...
"I don't know. She said she doesn't want to make this any harder on Viper." Mycroft bites his lip. "Is this really what you want? Because I'll go. I'll go far away and you never see or hear from me again. Come with me. Come with me and we can start over. This doesn't have to be it.. Sky? Is.. This is it.. Isn't it?" Viper asks quietly and Sky nods. "Why? Just tell me why? Please.." Viper begs and steps closer. Sky backs away and shakes her heads. "Fuck you." Viper sobs out and leaves the house, slamming the door.
“Sherlock said soon. He was also thinking about Maggie getting knocked up more. Either real or simulated.” Crystal hums.
"I'm not bleeding and it's not my kidneys. They're fine. Take a closer look at my uterus." Sky sighs. Lydia frowns and looks. "Oh Jesus Christ, Sky." She gasps softly.
He breathes heavily. “Thank you, sirs. Thank you for using me. My holes are always open for you to use.”
Mycroft rubs his leg with his foot, trying to be comforting without letting Sherlock know what's going on.
John sighs. "Do you want to get out or do you want to let the cold water out and put some warm back in and I'll wash your hair?"
Michael cries out and comes hard as he feels Jean come into him. Benny moans loudly and comes hard into Jean as he clenches around him.
Greg looks over at John who's been watching them. John bites his lip and shifts in his seat because is trousers are tight and uncomfortable. "Mm what do you want us to do to you, My?" Greg purrs and pulls on Mycroft's ear with his teeth.
John smiles, playing with Sherlock’s hair. “Tell me about back home. Who did you live with, was there anyone there you liked?” He asks.
“All my holes are yours. Whatever you want.” She moans. “You could always fuck one with your cock and the other with something else.” She whimpers and rocks back against him.
"You can also change the way you look.. Watch." She smiles happily and her hair goes from dark brown to an electric blue.
Mycroft smiles softly. “Good. I’m happy when your relaxed.” He shivers and nuzzles into her neck, kissing and sucking at it.
“I’ve locked him in a room by himself. There’s no problem.” Mycroft frowns. “What is the matter, Sire?”
John nods sadly. “What still do exist then? Vampire and witches and ghosts are the obvious ones.” He says softly, taking Leona’s hand.
"I'm going to go fetch a cab. You stay here and if I catch you trying to lift anything... So help me," John said then headed outside.
Sherlock frowns and nods. “You can try but he thinks we’re monsters.. Thinks I’m a monster..” He says softly.
He gasps and moans, rocking against him. "I.. ah.. want whoever has the biggest cocks.. want to be so full.."
"Mm, you are such a good girl. Such a good slut for Daddy." He smirks as he starts pounding into her.
"Sherlock, with my sister back in my life, and your brother never leaving yours, and clients. We should get an air purifier in the lounge. Something we can turn on when other people come over so it isn't overwhelming. Come winter, we won't be able to open the windows as often. Not without freezing ourselves out."
John reaches up and tickles his children, causing them to squeal and flail in his dad's arms. He's glad for his children. This will be the first time his parents meet Sherlock's parents. Two couples with such different views on life has him a bit on edge. But the laughter of his children helps.
Sky cuddles Sherlock between her and Turk. “Mm seems like we had the same idea.” She purrs as their round belly’s full of fun rubs together.
Sherlock smiled softly and kissed John’s head before sitting down. He started to tell John about each dish and why they picked it for their wedding. He told John how Angelo refused to be paid for the event so they made a donation to a charity in Angelo’s name.
"Mm look at them. Look at your husband fuck his sister." Collin bites at Mycroft's neck as he fucks him with his fingers.
“That’s a plus.” Margaret laughs softly. “I’m gonna go see who else is up and let Dominic know where to find you.”
He frowns deeply, looking heartbroken. "I.. I can't.." He shakes his head. "He doesn't want me. He's ashamed of me. He doesn't need to see me. It would be best if I just left. I'll fix Sky up and then I'll just take off. It would be better like that."
He nods and closes his eyes, pressing himself closer to his brother. "I love you, Sherl.." He mutters softly as he falls asleep.
He groans as he takes a picture. “Fucking perfect.” He sends all the pictures to Collin. “Put these up everywhere. Sherlock, Sky and I will be over soon. Us three can use her and get her ready for tonight.”
"Shh shh shh. I've got you, My. Always." Greg holds him and kisses his head. He rubs his back and rocks him gently.
Sherlock sighs. “Sister, I think I know of a way to defeat Camille, she was killed once before right? You know the place.”
"Need anything? Might as well get a few things while I'm there, and if I'm bringing a kettle home, I'm getting a cab, rather than walking it."
John doesn't want to go. He doesn't want to leave Sherlock especially not right now. But he wants to put his and Sherlock's mind to rest by finishing this case. "Are you sure? I can get Greg to put it off till tomorrow."
Greg nods. “They are with the people they love. Their children and husbands and parents. What happened to the two owning the house? Why have they not tried to resurface?” He asks.
"All the windows? Twice?" He asks, turning to Sherlock with a laugh. "Good god, Sherlock. You were a right terror, weren't you? I mean, you still are, so I guess that shouldn't surprise me."
John sighs as he’s let go and rubs his shoulder, trying to get the feeling back in his hand. “Easy with that. I want to read it as well.”
"Hello, Sherlock. Great to see you again." John smiles genuinely. "Did you get a chance to read those pamphlets I gave you?"
"Turn and lower yourself on my cock. I want you to ride me and watch as they fuck Chloe." He smirks.
"We can just put a giant red bow on your head and they'd think you're the best present they ever got." He smiles.
Dean rolls a condom on and strokes his thick cock. "Mm such a prepared slut." He smirks and wiggles Michael's plug. "It's not enough is it? You need a real cock to fill you up. Not some piece of plastic." He growls and fucks him slowly with the plug.
"It's alright. I understand. Is your throat okay?" Greg asks. "Yeah it's fine. Just lost my voice for a bit.." She shrugs.
“Really. I mean they fuck me all the time and most of the time a few of them are fucking me at once so it’s really not my fault that I don’t know. It kinda just happened.” She shrugs and rubs her belly happily, her bump not quite as big as Violets.
Mycroft smiles and kisses her forehead. The gods cheer and wolf whistles as she grows. “You’re stomach is as big as Mycroft.” They laugh, “what does it feel like?” One calls out.
Tempted as he was to stick his head out of the bathroom and watch Sherlock, John sat on the edge of the tub and simply listened, grinning when Percy came in wide-eyed, walking backwards as he stared at his Papa.
John squeezes his hand and follows. Mrs. Hudson watches them from the corner of her eye while she makes tea. She smiles when she's see their hands interlocked. "Have a seat at the table it's almost ready."
Mycroft comes up the stairs, having let himself in but knowing Sherlock would know he’s there regardless. “Look at you. Not even 24 hours yet and you’re already all domesticated.” He hums as he looks down at Sherlock and Jared.
She blushes brightly and licks her lips. "Eat, love. You must be hungry." She purrs and kisses him before slipping under the table, opening his trousers.
"Anna, come help me get some drinks!" Mrs. Brix calls from the kitchen. "Have Trina do it! She's older!" Anna says heading to the kitchen. "Yeah by like four minutes." Trina rolls her eyes and head to the kitchen after her twin.
Rolling his eyes John glares daggers at his sister then says, "We didn't have one, Harry. We bonded, came home, and some bloke from the registry showed up, took the pictures, and left. We haven't even discussed a party or anything like that."
They discuss the changes over the rest of their meal. The four omegas share excited glances with each other. John feels like they could discuss this topic endlessly, but unfortunately for him the baby monitor crackles and a soft "Mama?" Comes through the speaker.
John groans and runs his fingers through Sherlock’s chest hair as he continues to rock into his leg.
“For the most part.” Sherlock shrugs. The table was cleaned off and set for dinner. In fact the entire flat had been cleaned, while it still was chaotic, it had an organized chaos to it.
He smirks. "Mm. I want you to ride me. I want you to ride me and let Sherlock and Greg see just how much you love having my cock up your arse. Understand?"
"Look at you.. Disgusting.. You've made such a mess of yourself. Go to your room and strip. Lay on the bed and wait for us."
Sherlock smiles, “part from as soon as I bite you, you become... like before.” He says softly. “Needy and such.”
Mrs. Hudson bustles in from the kitchen and looks at the stunned faces. She notices the lack of a certain Alpha and nods her head once. She looks over at Mr. Holmes and smiles shyly. "Benjamin, would you be willing to give me a hand with some of the heavier dishes? The table is almost set, I just have a weight limit with my hip."
Sherlock frowns, starting to panic a bit before remembering that Mycroft had given him a panic button in his ring that calls Mycroft’s phone with an emergency message as well as his current location. He presses the hidden button on his ring, still watching Sky on the stage.
"I think it would be worse, knowing I'm alone." John grunts, stuffing the soft shirt as close to his nose as he can without actually shoving it
Sherlock cries out and comes hard into John's hand. "Yes! John!" He continues to rock his hips as the pleasure overflows his senses.
Joann whimpers. “I’m sorry. I.. I tried to stop him. I told him no. I begged him. I’m so sorry, Hanky I’m so so sorry.” She sniffles.
"Mmm, I was allowed free reign of pretty much this whole town, until I presented." John sighs. Sherlock's scents help override the dull chemical scent used to deodorize the rooms between guests. The air purifier in the corner hums, which reminds him of something he'd been meaning to bring up.
"Go on, upstairs with you, you mutt. Get your pyjamas, then come back down for your bath. I'll get the water started on my way to bring our case into our room. So don't dally, or you'll have cold water."
"Mm you're right." He bites at his throat. "I can hear you howling all night long as they fuck you. It makes me so hard when I listen."
"You decide what you want to do with this information," John assures their children. "All your father and I can do is tell you that our bond is the best thing that has ever happened to either of us. If you decide never to bond, we'll support you. You just have the advantage of knowing who your ideal mate is long before we found out."
"But it never passes. The rich like owning things and that includes Omegas. What would they do if they couldn't own something they'd grown accustomed to having their whole life?"
“No thank you. We need you here. Sherlock and Mycroft need you here. We’ll search the palace.” He offers.
Sky moves and kneels in front of him, taking his cock out. “Ohh Master.” She whimpers as she looks at his cock, having a swallow a few times but still drooling at the sight.
"How about dinner and we see how it goes?" She winks at Anthea and goes into the room to check on Sherlock's vitals. "How's the pain in your head doing?" She asks Sherlock and makes notes in his chart.
“You are going to be the death of me, Sherlock Holmes,” John says, shaking his head and smiling as he continues to cook.
He nods and follows him, making sure everything was set at the estate before leaving. “We should take a bus. I don’t know how many there are.”
Anthea sighs and kisses his cheek. “I’m sure he still loved you. I’m sure he still does.” She smiles.
Sherlock kisses John back, holding John’s head in his hands. “I’d rather be with you than anywhere else.” He mumbles against his lips as he kisses him again.
He bites his shoulder and angles his hips to hit his prostate. "Fucking perfect.. Can I come inside of you? Can I fill you up with my come?"
Sherlock groans and wakes as he hears the voices. He turns over with a groan, and smiles as he sees John. “Dreamt of you.” He blushes.
"Mm there is one in the back corner of the wardrobe. Put that one on." He smirks knowing its army fatigues.
She nods and goes out to Anthea in the hall. Greg sits him his chair and watches Sherlock and Mycroft.
Sherlock nods. “And Magdala?” He asks, steeling himself. “We have a spare bed if you need her out as well.” He says as he stands.
Mycroft moans and closes his eyes as he feels Sherlock coat his face. He licks his lips and opens his eyes to look at him.
"Mm you probably know which one I liked best, don't you?" He smirks and snakes his hand into Mycroft's pants letting him fuck his fist.
She whimpers and sinks down onto his cock, moaning loudly knowing anyone who walked by would hear her but she couldn’t help it.
"Okay great!" Sky hums and goes back downstairs. "She's a midwife?" John nuzzles Mycroft as he sits up.
Sherlock stays close to Eli, holding his hand. He feels a bit embarrassed about being so scared and emotional from something so small.
Greg whimpers and tries to get away from John and the room as soon as he says Sherlock’s name. He starts coughing, bringing up blood as he twists.
“She came from an affluent family. She was the only surviving child of her parents so her father educated her as much as he could. He wanted her to be smart and capable. She was both of those things and more.” Mycroft smiles softly.
“Thank you for this..” Carol says softly. “I was a bit of a mess after you told me the news. Now I’m feeling much better.
Sky injects the syringe into Lucas and they moan as the drug hits his system. She pulls the needle out and tosses it aside as she sits back feeding off the high he feels. "What.. What is that?" Jean frowns feeling it too.
"Yeah. I own a few actually all over London. Sky helped me pick the locations that would make the most profit and help the night life flourish. It would be great if you all came and had a good time." Collin smiles.
He shifts on the bed to allow Sherlock room, then sits back on his heels to watch as Sherlock prepares himself. "Christ, you're beautiful."
"Mm good that there's cum still dripping out of me or good that I'm probably being impregnated as we speak?" She purrs. "Mm either one is turning me on."
“Bountiful.” Sherlock agrees. “That corset must be hurting, let me help.” He says softly reaching his hands up, but unable to sit without help.
“Yessss!” She whines, loving how deep he fucks her. She holds onto his shoulders and rides him, bouncing on his cock and not caring that the bath water is sloshing onto the floor.
"Yes I know. Everything is fine. I'm fine. My reproductive system is.. It's fine.." She hesitated for a moment.
"We hope you'll be whatever he needs you to be...but if he mistreats you, please tell us and we'll end the contract...you can keep the money." Mummy said.
“Molly. Her name is Molly. I’ll have a car sent to pick you up. Would you like to come now?” Anthea asks.
He moans breathily, rocking back onto the dildo. "You should tell the others what the plan is tonight."
Greg catches the dvd case and sits it on the table. He hands Mycroft his food. "Love you." Greg smirks cheekily.
Mycroft puts his cards on the table, 22. He starts to take off his tie. “Drink up big sis. We want you nice and inebriated for our first meetin again with Camille.”
‘Mm. Good. You’ll be our breeding slut. A cunt for us to load up with our cum.’ He starts pounding into her.
“She’s perfect fine. I promise. Crystal and I fed from her but Magdala was in control the whole time. She knows her limits and won’t let us hurt her and we’d never let ourselves bury her either.” Mycroft nods.
John smiles in thanks. He opens Mycroft's chart first. He reads the tests and scans. He signs in relief.
Sherlock laughs as he buys another three beers. “Drink up.” He orders as he goes to buy a few shots of vodka.
She moans and arches. “You love this. Love that Mycroft told you to do this to me. To shove your big cock as deep inside me as it can go and to blow a huge load in my womb. That he gave you permission to knock me up and make me carry your babies. That he let you take my cunt for your own.”
“Yeah yeah. Calm down.” She rolls her eyes, not surprised in the least bit. She walks right past him to the cabinet and opens the bottom door, pressing up on one of the shelves so it reviles a hidden panel. She pulls the panel down and hands it to Sherlock, the ring attached safely to the panel. “You can put those fangs away. We have to leave the hallway cause the camera are gonna come back online in,” She looks at her watch, “two minutes.” She hums and closes the cabinet door. “Follow me and I’ll get you out so no one knows you were here.” She nods and starts walking down the hallway.
'I've never been subtle. Why start now?' Sky giggles. "Holy shit. That's something else." Chloe gasps.
"I've already agreed to a trial month, Sherlock." John smiles slightly. "I will have to go back to my bedsit to get a few things."
“To save Camille you did the right thing. To torture me you also incredibly picked the right way of doing that.” He growls, feelings his skin prickle. “As soon as Camille is back Theadora is gone. Out of my domain. Banished.” He snarls, shoving his hands in his pockets so Sherlock doesn’t see how they tremble.
"Mm how do you like it, Greg? Do you like it hard and fast or do you like it slow and deep?" He growls and bites at his throat moving faster and deeper.
"You should get tetanus, and rabies shot, if you aren't up to date. You probably ingested some of his blood, and who knows if he's clean or not."
Greg groans. "You're probably swearing at me aren't you, My? Fine I'll say it. I just want you to know, My, that I don't believe a single fucking word I'm about to say." He gets hit again. "Stop stalling." The voice says. Greg glares at the voice. "Here it is. I don't love you. I never have. You make me sick. Every time you touched me I wanted to vomit. Everything we ever did or said was wrong. I hate you. Don't come for me. I never want to see you again." Greg says in the flattest most hollow voice he can muster. He's never sounded deader inside.
And now, here was the man in question, asking if he wanted a friend's with benefits arrangement with him.
He smirks and hums. "Finish your drink and I'll take you out to the middle of the dance floor and fuck you discretely."
"Mm we've been in here for a while. Maybe around six or seven at night. It's kinda hard to tell how long I'm in here for sometimes." She hums softly.
“You really want to be a cheap whore tonight, don’t you?” He smirks. “If they look like they’ve got money we’ll charge more.” He chuckles.
She kisses him again and pulls back a bit. "I'll be right back." She smiles and goes to get the bag.
"God, how do you get more and more handsome every time I see you?" She smiles, remnants of a black eye bruising starting to fade from her face.
"You're going to feel this when your gone. You're going to feel me pounding into you. Using your arse. Fucking you hard. You'll crave my cock and beg for it when you get back." He groans and marks his neck getting closer.
“Plus the wait just makes it hotter.” Greg smiles softly. “Do you want me to prep you and you can watch or do you want to do it and I’ll talk you through it?”
"Maybe a bubble bath, but I'd have to scrub the tub first. That sounds nice... and some wine? And of course, this cupcake."
He moans loudly as he starts to ride Mycroft, gasping and mewling as the girls kiss and lick at his cock.
“Good. Now you can come since you made Rachel come.” Eli smirks, rubbing Mycroft’s prostate with the dildo.
Greg groans and fucks him harder with the dildo, turning up the vibrations. Chloe moans and swallows his cum.
It takes John a few minutes to realize that Sherlocks not getting hard and when he does, he pulls back and asks, "am I doing something wrong?"
Greg laughs. “Really imaginative,” he rolls his eyes. “You’re going to have to try harder than that.”
Leona sits and groans. “It’s of you. When you were little. John... he fell in the pond. You... everyone panicked. Including Diōnē and Pythia, but... but you dived in and pulled him out.” Her body relaxes as the memory ends. “Diōnē’s laughing, saying you really are Superwoman.”
He lines himself up and presses into him easily, groaning. He leans in to kiss his neck once he's fully seated.
Sherlock's eyes are still a bit watery as he holds onto Greg's hand. His eyes are trained on the floor, too embarrassed to look up.
John sipped his wine and was silent for a long moment. That could have been him surrounded by Alphas, it had been once. He knew the fear she must have been feeling.
“Greg,” John groans, looking around him. “I’m not... I can’t...” he whined. He really has no good reason, other than not wanting to.
John smiles. “You are a good boy. You’re so brave. You’re saving your village single handedly. You’re beautiful and will produce beautiful children. I want to make children with you. I want you to be happy in my arms. You’re so brave and excellent. I want you for the rest of time.” He praises, stroking Sherlock’s hair and cheek and hip, and anywhere he could reach.
Carol giggles and goes to the oven, bending over and switching the trays making sure what’s between her legs is on display for Greg the whole time.
"I'm gonna come I'm gonna come I'm gonna-" Sky cries out and comes hard on his face with his tongue in her hot dripping wet cunt.
John frowns and nods. “Fingerprints would be the way to go then since he didn’t have enough adult teeth.”
"I want it. I need it. Your slut. Your dirty little whore. Anything you want. I want all of it. Everything. I can't live without it. Don't want to live without it." She moans like a bitch in heat, loving his rough dominance.
He thinks of all the things he admitted to the stupid dog - or the very clever one - that he would never have said to Sherlock, had he been standing there. He remembers all the physical contact. The dog comforted him, lay with him, lay
“Okay. Well if you want I can have you move in with me and pay for everything so you can focus on school.”
"I don't know. She's being stubborn. She wants her revenge so she's play his game and it's killing her."
"Can't help it. Just the thought of them knowing my cunt belongs to you makes me gush." She whines, rocking back against him and fucking herself in his cock.
“Yeah. There used to be a house here but it burnt down.” Lydia nods. “I knew Annabelle when she was alive.” Lydia hops down from John’s arms. “Anna? It’s okay. You can come out. We’re friends, remember?” Lydia says softly as she walks around the tree, knowing Annabelle has trouble remembering things sometimes.
“So what’s in the agenda today? Go to the family counseling office and get signed up for the vacation?” John asks, having looked over the file while the bottle heated up.
She moans softly and melts under him. "Just fine. Now I've come along and cocked everything up on you." She mumbles against his lips.
Sherlock’s head turns to face Mycroft, but he doesn’t recognise him. He was a soft, pliable mess, just want for someone to control him.
John moans and tilts his head to one side. “So what happened next? Did you talk to anyone?” He asks.
“Mm. Next time, I want you to wear it all day and then fuck me in it. Work out in it with James. Find me later in the night and fuck me like you’d fuck a whore in the army.”
“Familiar?” Sherlock asked casually, as soft music started to play, a violin piece. Sherlock had written it especially for their first dance as a married couple.
"Maybe you can take a break from wearing it so often? Like only wear it when you really feel like you have to." He holds his hips and kisses his back.
He grins and kisses him deeply. "Parents!" He laughs. "We're gonna be parents!" He jumps around the living room excitedly and Anthea laughs.
." John took out his phone, grateful that Mycroft had shared the GPS tracking code in Sherlock's phone. He watched the little dot speed away from his immediate vicinity. "Any idea where he might be headed?" He sighed.
"*Le coq Gaulois, merci.*" Mycroft smiled, squeezing Greg's hand. (“The Gallic rooster, thank you.”)
“You don’t have to lie.” Sherlock sighs. “I bet Morna would be laughing if she didn’t have Kia in her arms. Oh God did Udos say anything?” He whines, blushing again.
Marie smiled. "*Vous êtes les bienvenus. J'espère que tu iras mieux bientôt!*" (“You are welcome. Hope you get better soon!”)
She smiles softly and kisses him back. “Maybe I’ll be feeding one of yours someday.” She hums softly. “He’s in the control room easing up some of the security protocols. Down the hall to the left.”
“Okay. I want all cameras and sensors up. Let George’s dogs out. They’ll secure the grounds and won’t let anyone in without causing a ruckus. Don’t tell Nina or Danny. They don’t need to know.”
‘If you wanted you could come home with us. I could carry your babies. I don’t think the other girls at home could. I’d probably be the only one that could handle it.’
This is the last chapter saved as a draft. I'll get more saved asap. Hopefully in time to post a chapter tomorrow. We still have plenty more content! - Tindo
"Whatever you want I don't care. I just want to make you feel good. Please whatever you need." She begs and grinds against him.
"That's not a gift." John chuckled, withdrawing one hand long enough to take a sip of tea. "A real gift. What do I get the man who can deduce everything?"
He puts his arm around her, just so no one will suspect anything. "I'm sorry, dear." He mumbles quietly.
John takes a deep shutter breath, eyes slipping closed. He could watch Sherlock anymore or else he’d come on the spot.
Mycroft quickly dresses in last night's suit, grimacing at the wrinkles. Anthea would hopefully take it out for dry cleaning.
She nuzzles his chest, the smell of him turning her on, knowing Turk can feel how aroused she is through their connection.
The boarding call for their flight came over the PA, and Mycroft, his blood practically singing, took Greg's hand in his and walked them toward their gate.
"His brother brought you in to straighten Sherlock out." Mrs. Hudson smiled, handing over the supplies. "You don't have to explain."
“Mary is an assassin who has ties to Moriarty. I didn’t know until last night,” Sherlock says in a rush.
She purrs and closes her eyes, blissed out. "Mm so much cum.. feels so good." She mewls, feeling his cum so deep inside her and filling her womb.
Sam smiles. “Butterflies it is. Do you have a favourite kind? Mine is the blue mountain swallowtail.”
Greg pants his feet on the bed so Mycroft’s back can rest against his thighs as he gets used to the feeling. He rubs Mycroft’s hips and thighs, his cock throbbing inside him. “Check in?”
They smile and take turns kissing him. "How was it?" Collin asks. "Did you like it?" Jason nuzzles him.
Sherlock jumps back and holds John close. “That’s so scary Lydia. No wonder Maggie’s boyfriend ran away.” He says, trying not to look at her eyes.
Gita goes and hugs Chloe as Chloe's mother comes over to hug him. She's crying nearly hysterically happy and sounds incoherent as she congratulates and thanks him.
"You look so fucking perfect, riding my cock like that. I can hear how wet you are, I can feel it against me. One night, we're all gonna pass you around until you're full of all our babies."
“Mm. Grew up in a small town with my family. Not much happened there, so I figured I’d try my hand in the city.”
Sherlock melts against John as John touches his hair. “John, please.” He mumbles, not sure what he’s pleading for.
'Mm you've been sleeping with Turk. You're fixed. Just being near him heals people.' She closes her eyes. 'You and Lydia would have cute little chubby babies..'
"Mm why do you think I spend most of my time running a carnival out in the middle of almost nowhere? " She smirks.
Mycroft sighs. “I’m a freak, Sire. This is my retribution for showing a weakness to a human. I won’t allow her to help me.” He explains.
"Christ... Sherlock..." John moans. "Gonna cum, baby... gon...na...." He pulled against Sherlock's hair warningly.
"I don't think so...?" John shook his head. "I have to wonder if he's bothered to notice I'm not courting the ladies any more... But he hasn't said anything untoward to me."
He squeezes John's hand. "A lot less broken than I..." He chuckles, bringing the hand to his lips and pressing a kiss to the back of it.
Greg nods. “Thank you for telling me. I know it must be difficult for you to talk about and I’m very honored that you trust me to let me know.” He smiles softly. “I may take us some time to find a rhythm and all I ask is that you be patient with me because I’ll probably ask a lot of yes or no questions or check in a lot while we’re together or doing something. I just want to make sure that you’re comfortable and enjoying our time together.”
Sherlock frowns. “I like fish. I’ve never had anything fancy before though. So, so long as I can have you by my side, I’m fine.” He explains softly.
“You can’t be serious!” John exclaims. “Well, for starters she’s a major distraction. Look at everyone fawning over her as they go past - and at you. I don’t like it. Did you see that guy before that nearly ran into the lamp post, because he was focussed on you and her?”
“Mm he is. Raw. Powerful. Just needs some polishing up. But you. Oh god you are a whole other story.” She moans. “Do you know you constantly leak cum when you’re inside me? When you actually come it’s just a flood of even more come but you’ve been slowly filling me this whole time. Feel.” She takes his hand and rubs it over her belly, rounded enough to make her look months pregnant.
"I'm fine, Sherlock... No need to hover." John struggles out of the chair and smiles. "These clothes are comfy... If I need a nap, I'll be fine." He walks over to Sherlock.
She swirls her tongue over the leaking head of his cock unable to help herself and slicks her fingers.
Carol comes over carrying her son. "Danny, his is your Uncle Greg. Greg this is Danny." Carol  smiles. "Hi." Danny smiles and waves his small hand at Greg.
He moans loudly, arching as much as he can into Sherlock's hand. "So good, sir! I love it when he fills my arse with his big cock. Love it. Can't get enough of it." He babbles, rocking his hips harder.
She blushes and nods. She gets up and let’s her robe slip off her, letting it pool on the floor around her.
"Mm. Didn't Myc say he used to come here a lot? He's probably showing Sherlock all the ins and outs of the town."
She frowns and nods. “Maybe that’s not a good thing. I got comfortable and I didn’t notice things slipping. Before it was just you and me. I could deal with that. Now there’s so many. And I have to keep them all safe. They’re my responsibility. They wouldn’t be part of this if it weren’t for me.”
John all but pushed Sherlock into the toilets then called out to him that he'd be looking around the shop. By the time Sherlock came out he already had his hands full of items.
“Crystal?” John asks concerned, as he wraps his arms around her. “Are you okay? Come on let’s sit down.”
"Thank you," John laughs as Sherlock screws his face into mocked seriousness. "Arse," he says fondly while doing his best to make Sherlock work for every inch of skin.
Sherlock nods. “Get the paperwork and I’ll sign it.” He hums. “And you have my blood work from..” He sighs. “From rehab.”
Lydia goes into Sherlock's room to check on him. She smiles as she recognizes the song he plays on his violin. "La da da di da da.." She hums along as she takes his vitals.
He stays very still as he listens. "I swear to god George I won't be able to take it if you're lying to me." He voice shakes and he tries his best not to let's George see him tremble.
“2011. He thinks it’s 2011. Before we were together. He doesn’t remember us being a couple. He thinks we’re just flat mates.” Sherlock took the bag a nurse handed him and planted his face against the opening.
John nods. “I think we’re happy with these rooms.” He smiles. He takes Margaret’s hand. “Thank you, for looking after the house and its occupants and for helping me.” He says softly.
Greg hums and crawls over to John. "I think I like loosing more than I like winning, Sir." He kneels in front of John and looks up at him.
Greg shakes his head. “All these things here. They want our blood. How is it safer out there?” He asks.
Anthea looks at her phone and gives a sly smirk before sending Mycroft a picture of her holding the baby. *Selene can’t wait to meet you, Uncle Mycroft.-Ant*
"Anthea! I need the CCTV footage for the stop and where that fucker went with Sky. Now!" Mycroft orders. "We'll find her. I promise. Take the car and drive over to the Yard. It's two blocks away. Find Greg and tell him to put out an alert to all police about this." Mycroft says to Zack.
"Oh? You like being fucked in public? I'll keep that in mind." Harry grins and wraps an arm around her mate while they watch Mycroft and Jacobs face each other. Jacobs Moriarty still has the IV line in his arm, and he isn't steady on his feet, but his eyes are alert and he looks scared.
“I don’t think he realizes how much me and my kind control his world.” Camille says to John. “I think it’s time he knows.” She goes to the hall and snaps her fingers once, twice, three times making him invisible to all vampires but giving him the ability to see them as he passes by them.
“Umm okay..” John says a bit skeptical, knowing how precise Sherlock is when he picks his clothes. “Any suggestions for the trousers I’m supposed to get?”
Sherlock gets a bowling ball and sets up the pins using the machine. “So you have 10 pins set up at the end. The goal is to use this ball to knock them down in 2 throws max. Watch, I’ll try.” He rolls the ball down the lane, knocking down half the pins.
“I will have to tell him you know. He will need to keep an eye on you too. I hope you don’t mind?” He asks as he sips from the tea, he doesn’t make a face at the taste, even though he wants to- he doesn’t want to upset John more.
“George, Cecil, push in with me and fill her cunt. Don’t waste your cum in her arse.” Mycroft groans, barely holding off his orgasm.
She smiles as she watches him just stand there. “Do you want me to come shower with you?” She asks, not being able to remember the last time they showered alone.
John continues crying softly. He doesn't know if he's making any sound but he could give a damn. Greg gets up and takes a tissue wiping John's face. John looks at Greg and gasps. Greg looks like hell. He's pale and his eyes are swollen with dark circles under his eyes like he hasn't slept in months. Greg stands back and thinks for a second if John would know sign language. "Are you okay?" Greg signs. John tries to remember the sign language classes he took last summer. "I can't hear." He signs back.
He frowns and leans against him slightly. “I understand, but you need to be strong for this. I need you to be there for me. Not only physically, but emotionally and mentally as well. I can’t do this without my doctor.”
Sherlock smiles and carries John into the room, he lays him down on the bed and curls up around him. “I love you.” He whispers.
Magdala moves onto her back so she can hug Mycroft and Diōnē, “I’m glad you’re happy with our arrangements. The three of us bringing you up.” She smiles.
“What is the appointment for? How do we get him to suggest the trip to us?” John whispers to Sherlock.
"Mm yeah." Sky hums and relaxes back into Turk who holds her close, hand resting on her belly possessively.
"Alright, Nurse Watson," John calls out to his mother, "Your expertise? Think these pups have been out in the cold long enough?"
Greg blushes and strips. He strokes himself in front of George and blushes more since their cocks are nearly identical.
"Sure. Or do you want to see what it'll look like when it's finished? I have the plans. Or it can be a suprise. Whatever you want."
Mycroft smiles into the kiss and kisses Crystal harder. ‘You’re beautiful. Perfect.’ He says into Crystal’s mind as he brings both hands up and tangles his fingers in Crystal’s hair, not caring about Sherlock or John.
‘No. She won’t. She’s brain dead, George. And if she wasn’t she’d never get close to the estate. Or to you. Or to Greg. I’d never let anyone close to you lit unless they were 100 percent safe. I don’t even let you guys go out and fuck people with stds for god sakes. I make sure that all of you are safe. Every moment of every day. You’ve nothing to fear. Nothing to worry about. I promise you.’ She kisses his knuckles softly.
"Strong. Brave. Loyal. Smart. Cheeky. Handsome. Reliable. Trustworthy. Loving. And a really great shag. Just to name a few." He smirks.
“Ha Ha.” Sherlock mocks a laugh at John’s joke and follows him downstairs. He goes to make John some toast and gets him some electrolyte drink that helps vomiting.
“You’re taking it so well.” She smiles. She clicks her fingers and all her clothes disappear. “Deeper?” She asks, now curious as to how much Morna could take.
John was disconcerted for only a moment, before he gripped onto the 'order' and got up, ruffled and sweaty clothes sticking unpleasantly to his skin. He took off his jumper in an effort to cool himself down and went to the kitchen, hoping the familiar act would calm his racing pulse.
"Feels good, doesn't it slut?" Collin smirks and strokes him teasingly as Mycroft scissors his fingers.
Mel blushes and whines softly at the emptiness. “Wanna be good. You guys make me feel so nice when I’m good.”
He smiles a little, realizing he wasn't totally against the idea of children. He still had a few more childbearing years left in him, and he felt a small clench in the pit of his stomach.
“Well that certainly can’t continue.” Crystal frowns and deals the next game. “Not blind but your judgement of his particular breed of Watson is slanted because of your history. You loved Violet and you lost her. That kind of pain lingers for ages. And we have nothing but time.” She sighs and looks at her card, 12.
Greg gets off the bed and fixes his shirt making sure his entire chest is well covered. He looks slightly less panicked now.
Jean smirks as he feels her move next to him. "Mm.. I'll fuck you again while Benny fucks Michael, hm? Take you on your hands and knees so you can watch like Michael wanted."
"Guess I'm lucky I don't have those fits anymore. Would have been really difficult to share a bed with her and worry about flailing all about." John tells him. "I'm glad you know your triggers though. That helps."
Mycroft's eyes narrow. "I know you've taken lives for him, but really John. It won't just be me you'd have to deal with. It would also be our mother. She is particularly fond of Sherlock, though one cannot understand *why*." He clears his throat. "Now. Go and do your shopping, before he does require an official pardon." He flicked his wrist dismissively.
“Exactly unless the family really wanted to maintain control over the omega then they would be taken right away into the next alphas custody.” Sherlock frowns.
“So full, Daddy. Want more. Need more. Not full enough. Don’t you want me fuller Daddy? So full of your cum. So full of your babies.”
John stands and paces out his angry energy, as Mycroft returns with a tray of food for them both. He places it at the side of the room and comes closer to John, a little nervously, upon seeing his demeanour.
“Lucky guess.” Sherlock hums. “Look I’ve been there before. It’s almost impossible to get in, you’re going to need a human’s help, not just for all the extra blood you need to consume because of the symbolisms, but because sometimes you have to touch the symbols to get through.” He explains.
“Let’s just say cheetahs get very confused when you run circles around them.” Sherlock chuckles and starts to get dressed.
Sherlock nods. “I’m happy to be a host again. If you need one.” He says softly. “You know I would do anything for Camille.”
He goes in and goes to Jared’s cot. He scoops him up gently, careful not to wake him. He holds him close and takes him back to their room.
“As long as your okay.” She smiles softly and nods. “You’re going to have to work on your pick ups by the way. If I didn’t want to ride you like a rodeo queen it wouldn’t have worked out so well for you.” She giggles and kisses his cheek before heading to the door.
Michael hesitates. "Can I wear one of your sweaters until we go out tonight? I've been trying to wear my binder less.."
Mel gasps and whimpers, leaking her juices and his cum. Carol finally bottoms out inside John, nudging his prostate teasingly.
"Yup." John laughs then shakes his head in amusement as Mrs. Hudson comes back up the stairs with a bag of groceries.
"Oh, I'm used to being in the background, dear." Sabine smiled. "Please, don't feel guilty on my behalf."
Sherlock bites his lip as he looks at her, still a bit afraid of what she thinks of him. He's even more worried now that she's seen him without his walls up.
"Fuck. You feel so good in my arse." She tosses her head back and moans like a slut as she rides him.
John looks to Sherlock. “I’m not living off Sherlock’s energy. He doesn’t have surplus energy like we have surplus blood. Plus I’m still going to be physically aging. I don’t want to look decrepit on Sherlock’s arm. I don’t want to be an embarrassment.” He frowns.
He blushes and smiles softly, setting his coffee down. "You deserve to feel.." He mumbles as he kisses her.
She mewls and kisses him deeply. ‘Tell me how you want my cock to be. How big. Hot thick. I’ll make it exactly how you want it. I’ll fuck You exactly how you need it.’
He growls and puts her on her hands and knees, staying deep inside her. He grips her hips in one hand and presses her head down to the mattress with the other as he starts to pound into her.
“If he doesn’t wake up we don’t have to worry about that!” Sherlock snapped but sat down, putting his head between his knees so he could breathe.
Maggie moans and presses against him as she kisses him back. “Mm I know.” She nips at his lips. “Clever little trick coming up with a girls night and you two distracting me while the others arrive.” She mumbles against his lips, having figured out their grand scheme for her birthday of inviting the whole coven to fuck her. “I won’t tell them I know.” She smirks.
John grips hold of Sherlock tightly, as he is rocked by Sherlock’s powerful thrusts. He moans loudly into the kiss.
“That’s right. You’re mine.” Sherlock puts John’s knees over his shoulders and presses into his omega.
Crystal sits in the counter. “I.. It’s just that Greg is my friend. Was.. My friend. And now that he’s been hurt by someone like me he can’t even stand to be in the same room as me.” Sherlock frowns, hands balled into fists.
Mycroft is stunned into silence at the words, so beautifully poetic in French. He inhales sharply and pulls Greg into his lap, kissing him deeply.
"Yes... and no." John shrugs his shoulders but looks up and smiles at his mate. "They'll find out eventually, might as well find out now. Harry said there's something she wants to talk to me about as well."
"Of course." Yuki smiles. "That's to say everything is all good. When it's not we say." Sky hums. "Hello, Death." Yuki hums. "Life, another dull moment?" Sky asks. "You left so how would you know?" Yuki completes the code.
Mycroft scowls and glares at his car as it pulls away. When he's sure it's out of site, he drops to his knees.
“We were thinking about going into town and shopping.” Mel smiles. “Wanna come be our body guard?” Carol smirks.
Sky sits and Veronica sits next to her. Eli pulls a chair out for Michael next to Sky as Jean, Benny, and Jake sit at the other side of the table.
Camille smiles and pulls a handkerchief from her pocket and hands it to Anthea. “You’re never alone.” She promises.
John whines and pulls his clothes off. With his cock leaking, he pushes it into Sherlock moaning loudly.
"I'm a lovely driver thank you very much! Come on before we hit the traffic!" She smiles and goes back out to the car.
Sky blushes brightly and moans loudly, dripping around his cock as she takes him deeper. “Mm look at you. Such a good breeding bitch. Such a good girl. You’ve already had so many pups and you still want more. You have so much milk to feed your babies you can barely hold it. I can feel your tits swelling in my hands.” Darius chuckles. “You probably can’t even see your belly under your tits, can you? How nice and round it’s getting the more we fuck you. The more we fill you with cum and pups.” He nips at her neck and looks down at Dark as he rubs her belly, Dark’s big cock visibly moving under her skin. Darius rubs her belly and strokes Dark through her skin.
Turk suddenly walks in calmly, having felt her distress. He sits by her side and starts to take her pain away.
Greg smiles and quickly takes charge of the kiss, one hand on the small of Crystal’s back and the other tangled in her hair. “How has it been?” He asks.
Camille frowns as she stands in the hall, feeling them come in. “This way.” She leads them to get office.
John rolls them over again so Sherlock is on his back. "Anything you want.." John kisses him and stretches him more.
He grits his teeth and fights to keep his arousal under control. "No." He looks back down at his work.
Sherlock smiles and grunts as one kicks up to when John is. “I like feeling them move. It’s like I’m meeting them already.”
Greg nods. He's blowing out a puff as his phone rings. "What've you got, Donovan?" Greg says smashing the butt of the cigarette with his shoe. "We've got the guy that gave Sherlock the drugs. Wanted to know if you were free to bust him." Donovan says. "On my way." Greg says and hangs up. "I'm going to go get that son of a bitch that gave Sherlock the drug."
Sherlock moans and leans forward to kiss him. "Will you come all over my face? Would you do that for me, Greg?"
Violet blushes brightly as she looks around, seeing people being bred. Some bend over furniture or tied down, some holding their cunts open while men jerk off into them, some with just their arse ends sticking out from walls being fucked and bred anonymously. “Oh George.. I love it.” Violet whimpers, holes throbbing around the plugs.
“Good girl. I know you’re close. I can feel it. Come for me, love.” He tugs on her nipples, making her squirt milk.
“Never thought of it honestly. Just thought you preferred the dark to make you look cooler and more mysterious.” John chuckles and smiles.
‘You’re making such a mess. I’ll have to lick it up once we’re done. I won’t knot you this time.’ He groans quietly as his cock pulses inside of her, under their hands, as he gets closer to coming.
Margaret shrugs. “I’ll have to speak with your daddies first. But I’ve always seen you as my own daughter Lydia, I’ve always loved you as one.” She explains.
“I’ve been Her right hand for over five thousand years. Today is the first time I disagreed with her and this is what she’s done to me. If this is what she doesn’t to me the rest of you are screwed.” Crystal shakes her head, terrified for them. “You know I’ve never done anything against her. Never. I told her today just to give Greg more time and she threw me around like a rag doll. I used the curtain ropes to pull her off me. She used magic on me. Magic to knock me out. When I woke up I was in silver shackles. We’re not safe. None of us are. We have to run. Flee as far as we can. She’ll kill us all.” Crystal looks to Mycroft, begging.
Sherlock sends Crystal his thanks and texts the number to Greg. He pulls John close and kisses him softly. “You look tired, take some of my energy.” He whispers.
“Ah you need this, mm?” He smirks and strokes himself, he could wrap two hands around his cock and it would still me longer.
"Mm.. Do you know how hard it is to work when all I can think about is how badly I want your cock in my mouth? I can't get anything done some days. All I can think about is how much I want you to fuck my mouth. To fuck my arse. To use me." Greg strokes faster and firmer.
"If you can leave this godforsaken house... Then I have an errand for you." She whispers, leaning in and licking Anthea's ear. "Get us a strap on so I can watch you fuck Mycroft."
John smiles and gets dressed before helping Margaret onto his back. “Will you tell me the way?” He asks.
Sherlock blushes a bit, glancing to Mycroft briefly before looking back to the cats. ‘Would that be alright?’
She smiles and nods as she sets the sticks on a dish, holding the hot tray with her bare hand with no pain.
Greg smirks and starts unbuttoning his shirt slowly. He lets it fall from his shoulders and pool on the floor. He undoes his trousers and steps out of them. He didn't bother putting back on his underwear earlier.
Sky frowns a bit as she looks at herself in the mirror. She puts her hair up in a messy bun to hide the thinning patches.
A crease formed in the middle of John's forehead as he frowned. "Noooo.... sh'lock... g't'oout.... you'll get'uuurt."
“He didn’t tell me his name. He help me get away so I could find Sky.” She hums happily and pets the dog.
"So you were making yourself our enemy." John clarifies, glancing towards Sherlock, "to make me prove to Sherlock I was actually in it to be with him and not all the perks." He squeezes Sherlock's hand and gives him a small smile.
Sherlock smiles. “You’ll have to be a bit bigger. He won’t take you seriously if you’re a child.” He hums. “Or you could go with John.”
"It would give us some alone time," John comments, "but who's Mina? I don't think she's in your class."
“Mm. Push out the other balls so we can get some of these nice blokes to fill your womb up with cum.”
"You're so dramatic." Sky frowns. "Oh really? Fine." Turk let's her go and she cries out as the pain comes back with a vengeance. "Y-you're an asshole." She stutters from the pain and punches Turks chest weakly. "Lying to him about how you feeling it's helping spare his feelings. It's just hurting you. You need to be honest with him for fuck sakes." Turk refuses to touch her to ease her pain as she trembles.
"Your father filled me in as soon as I got here. John your stress isn't good for the pups. We need to induce you."
“Like before?” John asks. “Every time I fuck you like this you get more children to carry. You become my own baby carrier. That’s all you do. Become a slut for my babies.” He growls in her eyes. “But this time I might let Mycroft and Sherlock join in, let them fill you to bursting with their children as well.”
"Oh fuck off," John says while making a rude gesture at the phone. He tilts the shower nozzle to the side a bit so he can lean against the shower wall and still be under the hot water. He looks down at his body, watching the water slide over the soft swell of his stomach. He's nearly positive that the protrusion is from their large lunch, and not the pups, but it fuels his imagination.
James moans, loving the sounds Greg makes. He reaches under and strokes Greg as he works his tongue.
"Chloe!" Mrs. Brix hugs her daughter before pulling back and looking at Zack. "Who is this?" She asks. "My boyfriend, Zack." Chloe blushes and smiles.
“Where have you been, man? We’ve missed you. We have new product if you want to try.” The addicts say. “Your old standard seven percent solution but it has a bit of a kick. I’ll give you first taste for old times sake.” The addict smiles.
"Mmm yeah, but if you're calling about the role of godfather, unfortunately, that's taken," John says coldly and not for the first time found himself thankful for the ability to think under pressure.
"An early Christmas present from Sebastian. We're going home and when he wakes up we're going to have a talk." She smiles and continues to drag the man past Greg.
"Such a good boy. So handsome. Takes such good care of us." She purrs, licking at the mark she made.
Sherlock puts in gloves and takes the cloth from Anderson. It's a white piece of fabric with a black threads running through it in almost random patterns. He frowns.
Sherlock stands up and leaves the room, pulling John away from the children. “They could die. Those two back there. Pythia and Diōne could die and get separated. Maggie and our child could die. John, if nothing else, do the thing to save Maggie. Please.” He begs.
"Pretty much." Sherlock answered. He reached the granddaughter. "Hello Miss. I...would you care for a dance?" Sherlock asked.
“Usually. Unless someone caused a war or something.” John nods. “Not to much has changed. But you’re here now.”
"Well I'm not fairing much better, love." She giggles a bit and hands him a tissue from her purse as she gets one for herself.
"Fuck... this is why he wanted us apart... He was trying to kill you." John swears, tearing at Sherlock's belt and trousers. With a bit of manhandling, he gets Sherlock's trousers down around his knees, and he tears Sherlock's pants down as far as they'll go.
He sits in the bed and opens a pack of chocolate-covered almonds. “I’ll call you my dirty little omega. Made for my cock. How you gag for my cock. How desperate you are for me. How you’re gushing slick for me.”
Darius nibbles and sucks on his neck. “Fill her up once more. You can do it. Fill our mate.” He mumbles against his skin. Sky whines and grinds against their knots, rubbing her clit with Darius’ fingers.
"Well to be perfectly honest with you, Michael, I've been having a rough patch lately and this has really brightened up my day a lot so thank you. Why wouldn't I come over? You're to handsome and sweet to ignore." She smiles and tilts her head just a bit cutely.
He shakes his arse and moans. "I-I can't remember, Sir.." He whimpers as his mind goes blank as the plug inside him moves.
She bites and sucks on his throat. “You better fuck your good girl know. She’s waited patiently for her reward.” She smirks and lets go of his cock.
He blushes and gasps softly. "We should go to the club we normally go to, they don't care if you're 'indecent'."
Sky’s eyes widen as her air is cut off cunt pulsing as he degraded her. Her holes throb as she gets close to coming again from the rough treatment and stimulation.
He holds closer and presses kisses to her. "We're going to go out for food. Do you wanna get up and come with us?" He says softly, nuzzling her.
Neriine roughs up the towel a little bit and turns in a circle before lying down, her little head propped up on the edge of the box so she can see them eat dinner.
“Mm with a nice thick cock like yours I don’t think I’ll manage to hold on very long either. We can always make it last next time. Right now I just really want your cock in my pussy.” She nips at his lips and slowly sinks down onto his cock. She gasps and arches as she takes him all the way in, moaning needy since he feels so much thicker than she though he was gonna.
"That's it, beautiful.. Just like that.. You're going so good.. Just a bit more, love.." He kisses his neck softly and twist his hand on every up stroke.
She rolls them over and straddles Violet’s hips, running her hands over her body. “I wanna be big like you. So fully. So pretty.” She licks her lips as she rubs her belly.
Sherlock smiles softly and carefully gets up, thankfully running into Peter on his way out of Sky’s room. He smiles. “Hey, I don’t want Sky to wake up alone, mind going in there and laying with her?”
Mycroft blushes and kisses him, still feeling bad. "I love you. You're beautiful and amazing. And I'll always love you."
Crystal pulls Sherlock into her arms and hugs him tight. “It’s over. We’re safe. I promise.” She whispers as she hugs him.
"Moaning like a whore." Collin chuckles as he adds a third finger. "Such slutty sounds." Sherlock hums.
"It means I'm a Detective that works on his own, independently from the police, and consults on their cases when they need help...which is always." Sherlock answered.
"Such a loud cockslut for me. Are you going to come? Are you going to make a mess?" He growls and keeps up the nearly brutal pace.
Two weeks later, he smiles, seeing Sherlock's name on his roster. "Melinda, please send Mr Holmes in." He murmurs through the intercom.
John nods. “Thank you. Though I think Greg is going to be needing a mentor, if he chooses to continue with his magic.” He says softly. “Would you like to speak with my mother now?” He asks.
Sherlock moans and lets his tongue travel across her breast. He takes it in his mouth and sucks softly.
“Would you mind? I swear I have the tightest cunt you’ve ever fucked.” She licks her lips as her cunt drips around the plug.
Sherlock nods enthusiastically. “Yes. Yes please. But I want it the old Earth way, with bows being exchanged and the whole showmanship of it.” He almost begs.
“No, Ma’am. I won’t.” Mycroft tells the truth, knowing that if he does something stupid they’ll all die.
“I don’t have to stay here and listen to you say hurtful things.” John grunts and leads Magdala outside, getting them a cab.
Greg slides to the floor. He palms him through his trousers and pulls them down. Greg mouthes at him through his pants.
Mycroft and Sherlock exchange glances before Sherlock spoke. "It would appear that our brother isn't too happy with the happy announcement from you two, Detective. He can be rather.. unconventional. More so than I."
“Will she let me go?” Greg asks, not wanting to waste his time with another vampire if she won’t let him go.
“I turned off my pain because if I didn’t I wouldn’t be able to serve you or the humans. I wouldn’t be able to look at them.” Crystal frowns.
'Oh you brilliant dirty thing you.' He grins. 'I want to kiss that smirk off your perfect fucking face.'
“First I’m going to start by kissing your cock and rubbing some lube over your arsehole.” Greg tells him, squirting some lube into his hand. “We’re going to go super slow, alright?” He smiles softly. “Feel free to put your legs over my shoulders and pull my hair.” He chuckles, laying down between Mycroft’s legs. “Tell me if it gets too much and you want me to stop. My intention right now is to pleasure you and to introduce new sensations gently.”
"Mm you know me." He chuckles and turns him around to kiss him. He cleans him up and puts his clothes back right.
Sherlock's heart rate picks up as Greg moves his hands over his chest and he flinches when he rubs over his nipple, choking out a desperate moan. "G-Gre-!"
“Mm still needy?” Eli smirks against Sherlock’s lips. “You just got pounded by at least two dozen cocks and you still need more?”
“I want to get more comfortable with John... in bed first.” Sherlock blushes. “Will you grow them now?” He asks, moving his arms to show Loral his tiny bump.
“No. It’s too dangerous.” Mycroft states, “it’s for the safety of our race. You said so yourself that you’ve not looked at it or done anything with it. You won’t miss the broach.”
He holds onto him, rocking against him. He whimpers and tightens his hold on him as he comes hard for him.
Mycroft grabs a vibrator, slicking it end easing it into his arse before pushing back into his cunt.
Lydia smiles and tries to her in her head. A few moments later Margret comes into the room. “Sherlock, John. I was wondering if you wanted to get used to the house, put down some anchors here and in your bedroom.” She offers.
Sherlock giggles and nods. “Do you like snow? I like snow. It’s pretty and cold and you can ice skate.”
She moans loudly and arches sharply, squirting around his cock as she comes. "Tonight. Well go out tonight. Everyone can fuck you as you fuck me. We'll both be so full of cum." She whines, legs tightening around him.
“Only trying to offer an out if you needed it which it sounds like you don’t. Enjoy your evening, Sir.” She smiles.
“No you won’t. You’ll just not think about it, until we’ve both forgot or it’s too late.” Sherlock frowns and sits up, swinging his legs off the bed. “Go find Magdala, take Crystal. Go to that secret bedroom of yours and talk. Now.” He begs.
"I want you to come. I want you to make a mess for me. Then I'll lick you clean and sit on your face until you can't breathe." She growls and strokes him as she fucks him.
“Oh thank you!” She nods and leads him to the couch. She has him sit and then she straddles his lap so her tits are right in his face.
“We can talk pictures if you want. Video even. Up to you.” Sherlock smirks. “Just goes to show it’s possible to have an active adventurous sex life while being parents.” He smiles.
“There must be some trick to it.” Sherlock looks around. “Here we are.” Lydia smiles when they get to the bottom of the stairs
"Wait, you said the homicide division, right? That would mean that.. Lestrade is your dad?" He looks amazed.
He hums, leaning back in the chair and putting his feet up. “Mm, fine, take them. They’re boring me.”
“I’ve got a few requests for tonight.” He hums. “I’m sure Sherlock already called you to set up something special for Gregory and us. I’d like you to send an announcement to all patrons that there will be a breeding slut open to anyone who wants to empty their balls in her cunt.”
Greg's face is unreadable but his eyes are full of fear. "You probably didn't think you were going to hear from me so soon, did you? I wanted to apologize about your fathers cancer. It is a terrible diagnosis and I don't wish it on anyone. You probably want to know how I know about your father? Well I had a lovely chat with your mother this morning after she disowned you. It turns out she's a very devout follower of mine and I just had to get to know her better." Sherrinford chatters away into Greg's ear. Greg swallows down bile.
“Here.” Rob hands him a little cup that has nectar in it so the butterfly will stay and have a drink.
Sherlock smiles and kisses Kia’s head. “What shall we do, Kia? It’s up to you.” He asks, looking up at John, to see if everything’s okay.
Greg smiles and leans closer to whisper in his ear. "I'm madly in love with you." He whispers and kisses his cheek.
Sky is laying on a lounge on the other side of the dance floor. Ivan is on top of her kissing her neck when they find her. "Having fun?" She says and smiles at up at them upside down.
John thinks for a moment. "It didn't go so well last time. But seeing as though I can't hear her yelling at me I guess you could talk to her if you don't mind." He signs and shrugs a little hesitantly.
John nods. “It’s nice, knowing Kia has friends here. I’m always worried because there’s no one else her age. It’s good to know she isn’t lonely.”
Mycroft groans at the sight before smirking, remembering that he had the remote for the vibrations. He grabs the remote off the table and wiggles it at John, smirking with a brow raised.
He runs his fingers through John's hair and kisses his forehead. "How about we relax for a bit then?" He lays next to him in the grass.
John shrugs. “They’ll want to raise the child themselves. Feed the child themselves.” He says softly.
“It’s okay, child. Your fangs come down when your emotions run high. You must be feeling rather exhilarated.” Camille smiles. “You will get the hang of it. Of everything.”
Crystal is carrying out a huge crate from the barn as they come out. “Mornin, boys.” She grins and sets down the crate, it’s so heavy it makes the ground shake as it’s put one the ground.
"Oh Hank," Joann curls up and presses herself into his arms. "He tried to... and got angry when he couldn't get me pregnant."
Greg gags around his cock, loving every minute of this. He looks up to meet Collin's eyes as he reaches for his hand, moving it to his own throat.
"Such a loud fucking slut for Daddy." He leans in and bites his neck, pressing him to the desk as he fucks him hard.
He blushes and shakes his head. 'I figured the guard would tell them when they get here. Thought it'd be better to see their reactions.' He mouths back, smirking just a bit.
“Love taking your cock. Want it always. Can’t stop thinking about it. What’ve you done to me?” She whines and rocks back, needing him to move before so loses it.
Sherlock grins and leads John out. They spend the day looking at crime scenes and bodies and racing around London chasing suspects. At the end of it they end up back at Sherlock’s flat, laughing at the bottom of the stairs. “So what do you say, Dr. Watson? Partners?”
"Because if I tell him I'm scared of losing him, then he'll stop and you know your Papa is too extraordinary to stop helping people." John replied, stroking her hair. "Come on now. A quick bath and then it's bed time."
He whimpers softly, sliding his tongue against Jake's. "Take me home. Please." He begs, wanting to be with Jake instead of going to the club with Sky and Turk.
"It's gonna change the world. This little ball is going to help a lot of people. I was thinking it could be used at crime scenes at first. Like before investigators go it can record everything in the crime scene so the data can be more precise." She hums.
Lily's eyes dart over to Michael movement and licks her lips. "Easy girl. He's mine." Sky hums and scratches her behind the ear. Lily purrs and relaxes.
Greg tries to find that one spot. The spot that makes him howl when Mycroft hits it. The pad of Greg’s finger brushes right over the bundle of nerves.
Greg smirks. "Yeah?" He looks down at Carol, pressing deeper into her thrust and cutting off her air.
The box is full of onesies, bottles, blankets, little hats, and little socks. Sky bites her lip and waits for everyone to get it.
“Of course I came. I love you. I wouldn’t leave you.” James takes his hand. “I’m sorry I was an ass. I was just worried and I wasn’t listening because I was scared. I’m so sorry, love.”
“Like I said 95% of the vampires he’s met have tried to kill him.” John says softly. “I would think the same if that happened to me.”
Mycroft felt the walls of his belief shift again. It would take a while, but for now he was happy to wallow in those four words Greg had uttered.
Sherlock gasps as his back hits the couch and moans softly when he feels John's teeth graze his collar bone. "John.." He repeats, pleasure coating the word this time.
John goes over and buries his face in Sherlock's shoulder. "I love you." John says muffled into Sherlock.
Sherlock sets her on the counter. “Alright, stay here while I get the tuna, yeah?” He goes to the fridge, getting out a can of tuna and opening it before setting it down in front of her.
Morna nods. “That’s my job, Sherlock.” She says, patting his arse as she leaves. “If you want a cuddle, I can come back, I won’t change anything on your body though, you’re perfect.” She smiles.
"*Oh, je n'ai entendu que de bonnes choses!*" Juliette gushed. "*J'espère que vous l'apprécierez.*" (“Oh, I've only heard great things!  "Juliette gushed."  Hope you enjoy it.”)
He groans against him. "Christ.. that all sounds brilliant." He pulls back a bit. "But I've got to find the others. Come with me?"
"Can't help it, Daddy. I could come just smelling you. You did this to me. Got me pregnant. Making everything you do to me feel so good. Making you smell so good. You did this and I fucking love it." She moans loudly, loving the feeling of his cock inside her.
“Should I be nice and let your cock free?” Crystal asks, rubbing the claps around her nipples and making him watch.
"That's not true at all. You get up everyday and decide you're going to better than the last, you work hard, you came here, and you've boughten me this lovely drink. I hardly think you've done nothing." She smiles.
Greg hums and nods as he eats. “I work too much I found out. I didn’t have anything to do so I just worked. My boss pulled me into his office today and told me if I don’t take a holiday voluntarily he’s going to suspend me.”
“I’ll go around covered in your slick. I’ll wear it like a badge of honour.” Sherlock shrugs, seemingly unbothered.
“I can feel you, Daddy. Please. Push past it. Push as deep into me as you can.” She begs, her pussy throbbing around his cock.
Sky smiles and watches them go before going to her therapy appointment after making herself presentable. She sits and waits for Dr. Parker to call her into the office.
“Yup. They might not be allowed in today but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t get to come even if it’s themselves that’s gets them off. Plus I have an idea with what to do with all that cum.” Sky smirks.
He smirks and pulls out of his lap completely. He straddles him and faces him. He leans in and kisses him deeply as he sinks down fully into his cock.
"Mm Turk has something to share." Sky smirks as she sits on the end of the bed where all their boys are cuddles together.
The man looks panicked and he raises the gun to his own head. "I need to do this! Just let me do this!"
Sky moans loudly, taking his cock so well. She blushes brightly as Violet hooks her up to the pumps, draining her tits as she’s fucked. “A proper breeding cow now.” Violet smirks as she watches the milk nearly gush out of Sky into the machine.
"Alright Nigel I want you sitting on the bed with you back to the headboard. Ada is going to sit between you legs and lean back against you." Sky gets them situated on the bed.
Sherlock hurried them away from it all. Once far enough away, Sherlock pulled their masks off. "Are you okay?"
"They have a star's exhibit and Hayley says at night the stars light up and make it look like you're not in London." She says, "what about you Papa? What are you excited to see?"
“Well I’ve already got a plug in me so you could take that one and since I’m edging I could take the cockring.” He blushes.
“We could get him one of those slow feeder bowls so he doesn’t eat so fast and overeat,” Sherlock suggested.
Greg's eyes tear up as he looks at the picture of them and reads the frame. He smiles softly and bites his lip. "This is amazing.."
“Yes you do. It’s because she looks like Violet. You’ve not gotten over her.” Sherlock frowns. “Please, Mycroft, for me. For your brother, just speak to both Crystal and Magdala together about what I’ve said, the position you could have. I know that your heart is big enough for two.” He explains softly, holding onto Mycroft’s jacket.
Turk groans and comes hard into Bruce, filling him with a nice big load. Sky moans and comes hard, squirting around Bruce’s cock. Turk breathes hard and kisses over Bruce’s shoulders. “What was the number?” He mumbles.
"They're all so different too. Sherlock is so soft and sweet. So ready to please. Greg is loving and solid. John is tough and he'll fuck you through the mattress, won't he?" He chuckles and tugs on Mycroft's bollocks gently taking a break from stroking him, dragging this out.
“I won’t let you come. I’ll just keep you leaking. Just a steady streak of leaking precum knocking me up.” She purrs and licks her lips. “You have very potent precum. I can feel it swarming my eggs fertilizing them.” She moans softly, eyes closed.
"Mm good girl." She praises and turns down the vibrator while adding a third finger, stretching her arse more.
He kisses his head and rubs his back. Sherlock comes up and snuggles into bed sandwiching Mycroft in the middle. "He promised he'd never leave.. He doesn't break his promises." Sherlock mumbles against Mycroft's back.
Eli greets everyone and sits at the head of the table with Mycroft to his right. The presentation begins with projections of how the building will look.
**Good. Don’t feel bad for not noticing. You thought she wanted to be with Anderson so you wouldn’t have perused her anyway. We’ll see you there. Make sure it’s a good fuck for her. She hasn’t had good dick in years.—SH**
"God... I missed you." John sighs, tilting his neck to the side to give Sherlock better access. "Our pups have been growing without you, but I know they've missed you too... It felt like part of me was missing."
Sky frowns and nods. “I’ve had other successful pregnancies since then. I just never got over that first one. When I’m pregnant I’m always on the offensive. As if I’m waiting to be attacked again. Which I know I’m not. I just.. I don’t want to fail again.” She shakes her head, tearing up.
John goes back into their bedroom. “What’s going to happen?” He asks. “I mean where are we going to live? What about our stuff back at Baker Street?”
John hums happily, Sherlock spinning and twirling them around the dance floor. He glanced at his watch. “We’re free to go whenever you want.”
“Good girl. You can relax now.” John offers as he puts the paddle to one side and pulling out some cream. “Let me tend to your wounds before I fuck you over the little vamps’ body.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “Your blood. It smells... I can’t... you would leave me.” He says sadly. “You’re the only person that hasn’t left me after finding out the truth.”
She whines softly as he pulls out, missing the fullness of his cock. “What does the test say?” She asks, angling her hips up to keep his spunk inside her.
“I could sit like a good boy while you fuck my face. Make me take your cock however deep you deem fit. Make me gag on it.”
"You left... and I don't remember what I did, but my bedding is under my window, which suggests I was attempting to get fresh air. "You came home late, then... there was blood, and judging by the bruise on your face it was yours?"
"She didn't like me better." John snaps, sick of this argument. "She needed to teach me how to not be a pushover and, as you said, how not to beg anything with a knot to make it better"
She smiles and gets a wheelchair. "Careful now. You might feel a bit light headed because this is the first bit of real movement you've had in a few days. We'll just take it slow and see how you feel.." She helps him into the chair.
“There we are, Sire. Take as much as you need.” Mycroft says softly. “Gain your strength, we’re happy you’re back.”
"You're so good. Such a good slut. You feel so good. I could fuck you tight little arse for hours.." He babbles and moans.
"Do you want to make me wear a plug? Just to make sure?" She kisses his fingertips, sucking gently at the pads of his fingers.
"Okie dokie.." Lydia shrugs and goes back to the kitchen. "You have some explaining to do." Anthea looks at Mycroft.
“I know.” Magdala says softly. “I think that’s partly my fault..” She sighs. “When a witch has the sight they can see all kind of different things depending on their variation of the gift. Your sister.. Her variation changes depending on what she thinks she needs to see most.”
"Do your worst," John says darkly, though there's a twinkle in his eye. "But are you going to strip first? I feel underdressed."
"Mm I love you, too, baby.." He smiles. Lydia soon comes back with the wheelchair. "Who's ready for a trip?" She smiles.
Greg nods and smiles. “I want to speak to Sherlock and John alone though. I have an apology to make.” He says softly.
Mycroft hurried in a short time later. John glowered at him. After an argument that had them threatened to be ejected, they were told Sherlock had been taken in for emergency surgery and they would be fine to wait in the waiting area, as long as they didn't start to argue again.
"Just for you..." he says softly, pinching a nut from Sherlock's palm. "I want those things, just from you."
"No, no they did not. Looks like they'll be spending tomorrow cleaning the lab." John smirks, "You can join them if you want."
John's muscles milk every last drop of come out of Sherlock. When his Alpha finally collapses onto the bed beside John the Omega cuddles up close beside him.
“Be honest with yourself, it was never me you wanted. You were going through the motions. Some motions you couldn’t even get it up for,” Mary laughs.
Lydia strokes his cheek soothingly. She gets him to look at her. "It's going to be fine, Sherlock. Just a little concussion. We just need to make sure nothing more serious is going on in that genius mind of yours." She signs so Sherlock can understand.
John rolled out from under Sherlock and held out his hand for his mate. When Sherlock took it, he guided him through the flat, switching off lights as they went, then pulled him into bed. Sherlock stripped out of his clothes down to his pants and crawled into bed.
Greg chuckles and kisses Mycroft’s cheek. “You’re only huffy because you lost that bet with Uncle Rudi.”
John is on his knees soaking up the blood and wiping the floor. He has gloves on and bleach wipes to clean the floor with. “You always make such a mess with these experiments. What is this one even for? I didn’t even know you had a fridge in here. I thought you kept everything in the fridge in the kitchen.”
Jason and James are coming up from the basement from the gym when they see Sherlock walking the other direction not having noticed them. “You stop right the fuck there.” James orders, smirking as he looks over Sherlock’s naked arse and back.
Mycroft groans and comes hard again before pulling out of Sherlock and letting Cecil push into Sherlock.
“I love it when you make a mess. When you squirm and whine. When you beg. You make me so hard when you beg.”
Sky mewls At the nearly painful stretch. “Easy, baby. Just relax. You’re doing so good.” Darius kisses behind Sky’s ear and rubs her clit gently. Sky moans softly and relaxes, nearly purring.
John shakes his head laughing. "Scientists." He mutters, rolling his eyes. "What else have you learned about me, then?"
Sherlock giggles and kisses him. "Come on. We'll go to dinner and the the club. I'll dance with you.." He smirks and nips his lip.
John hums. “That’s going to be your mornings everyday for the next couple of months. Sometimes it can be short like this, sometimes it feels like hours.” He explains softly. “But I’ll always be here.”
Sherlock relaxes into John, his whole body melting against him. “I want to be showered in praise. I need it. I want you to tell me I’m a good boy. I want you to mean it when you say it. I want you to want me like I want you.” Sherlock mumbles.
"I'm glad you did." He smiles. Someone knocks at the office door. Sky moves from where she's was sitting and goes to George, curling up in his lap. "Come in." George barks as he wraps his arm around Sky. The door opens and a man steps in. "Sir, the preparations are almost ready for Miss Sky." The man says. "Thank you. Dismissed." The man leaves with a curt nod and closes the door. George let's Sky go and she moves back to her original seat.
John gets behind Sherlock and kisses his neck. “Mm if you have Mycroft switch to your cunt I’ll fuck your arse.”
"Considering everything I'd say your doing very well. The pressure is gone and there isn't anymore symptoms appearing. Basically the only thing you have to worry about is infection to the incision but considering you have two doctors, John and myself, looking after you be good as new in no time at all." She says and signs so John can understand her as well. John nods and smiles.
"I love you.. I love you.. I love you.. I love you.. I love you.." He kisses his head between each one.
Greg nods and starts to slowly lift the mask off his eyes. He blinks slowly and squints to look at people. “John?” He asks.
"We'll take you to a pub and strip you down. Set you up on the bar and have all the blokes take turns with your cunt and arse."
Sky gasps and moans, rocking back down onto his cock wanting it all the way inside her. “Is that all you’ve got? She’s not even drooling yet.” Turk eggs the man on, knowing Sky can take whatever he gives her.
Mycroft sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I’m going to say what neither of you have said for years. You both care deeply for each other. Regardless of if you realize it, you do. I’ve seen it since your first night together. Sherlock he’s.. he’s never had to deal with these sorts of emotions. Add that with him believing that you were straight, and that mind of his will come up with just about anything, hence what he’s said. He doesn’t believe he’s capable of receiving love from another person. I know this doesn’t detract from the pain his words have caused you, but I hope they will at least give you insight to why he may have said them.”
Nina bounds up to Dark as he comes into the room. “I can hear animals. That’s my special power.” She grins proudly.
"Can't wait until we get home can you?" Mycroft smirks and rubs his cock as he wiggles to butt plug in Sherlock over his pants.
“Of course, Myc.” Sherlock kisses Mycroft back, moaning softly at the taste of Morna’s milk on his brothers tongue.
Kia gasps as the plug keeps her stretched open and plugs his cum deep inside her. She mewls and crawls after him.
John presses his head to Sherlock's chest, letting the man's scent calm him some, wrapping his arms around him.
“True. I can’t tell you how many centuries I’ve gone through without using calculus.” Crystal laughs.
Mycroft moans loudly and starts pounding into him. "You always feel so good, Greg! Christ, I'm close already.."
"It's supposed to be the person you care about most in the entire world even more than yourself and you treat them like shit. It makes me sick.." Greg sighs. The man says something to the woman and she starts crying quietly.
"Out with it Sherlock! We don't have all bloody day!" Donovan rubs her temples. "You didn't do that to him did you?" She looks at Sherlock threateningly.
When the ambulance arrived, they got John onto a gurney but the paramedic stopped Sherlock from getting in.
"Collin, take your fingers out and push into Sherlock. Fuck him slow and deep as you try to fuck yourself in Mycroft's fingers." Carol hums.
“So enough to be dangerous.” Sherlock frowns. “I want your mother to teach you self defense magic. As much as possible.”
"I remember everything, every nice thing you did for me. Every promise, every touch." He whispers, lips ghosting along with Sherlock's ear. "You, Sherlock Holmes, are one very sexy Alpha."
Sherlock frowns a bit and finally looks at the woman for a moment before looking back at Rosie. “Her mother is gone. I share custody with her Biological father. Kind of..”
She rocks her fingers slowly and presses her back against the wall, leaning in and teasing her nipples with her tongue.
Violet moans as she start to eagerly eat her out, holding her legs down to her cunt is flush against her face.
George nods hello to a few people that he recognizes, mentally adding them to the list of people to fuck Sky.
Greg chuckles. “You didn’t do as I said. Plus I know how to put cuffs on people so they can’t get out. Giselle Dimitri. Greek? Where is it?” He asks, still refusing to give them pronouns or acknowledge them as people.
“To get answers, John. That one is useless. I want to know if my blood is poisonous to all or just this one.” Greg frowns, saying it as if it was obvious.
Sherlock growls, knowing John is only trying to rile him up so he goes with it. “I should give you a proper litter. Six or seven pups at least.” He snarls, pressing his cock into John in one swift thrust.
He gasps and moans, gripping the sheets tightly. It'd been so long since he's been with someone intimately, his body oversensitive.
Mycroft leads them inside when they arrive. Joann holds onto John’s hand tight but holds her head high. They're guided into a small room. There are three chairs set in the middle facing a slightly tinted window. Jacobs is already in the other room, secured to a chair. John figures he was brought in first, that way he couldn't smell them in the hall if he arrived after them. Joann hesitates at the door, gasping when her eyes land on the man strapped to a medical chair. John reached his hand out for his mother, holding it just in front of her, giving her the chance to reach back out for his support.
*Selene Aeliana. I’m not sure about last name(s) yet. I’ll ask Molly when she wakes up. Molly did so amazing. I’m so proud of her. She’s so strong, Myc. Breathtakingly.-Ant*
He whimpers and nods, tipping his head back for John. “Yes.. love being passed around like a whore.”
"Of course I am. I could never leave you." He leans in to kiss his head softly. "I love you. So much."
"Anthea!" She nearly shouts as she comes. She shakes and trembles hard under Anthea. She moans as the waves of pleasure continue to wash over her.
She moans like a slut and whines. "You and Sherlock loved it. I'd lay you both on the bed. Let you each suck from me as Daddy fucked my from behind. You two would beg me for it. Daddy and I were such push overs. Sometimes we'd give in two three times a day. We just couldn't say no to our boys."
Greg washes himself then Sherlock. He massages Sherlock's shoulders and back. He kisses his neck softly and massages him till his muscles are loose and relaxed.
She nods and follows him and the others out, her other contacts having left since she gave theme their freedom.
John's not entirely sure it's a good idea but he knows how happy Rosie would be to spend more time in the park and honestly, he's not looking forward to eating another meal alone in the flat.
He smiles softly as he strips as well, leaning in to kiss him gently again, teasing his hole with a lubed finger.
Sherlock shugs. “You can tell him, but he probably already knows it. We have a bookkeeper. They literally record our history, every single one of us is in the books, that story will be in. But if we can’t find her ashes, if she was beheaded, it would be a futile hope. I’m sure people have looked for her, and not found her.” He explains softly. He’s silent for a moment before adding, “In fact they have looked. I was contacted to go on the expedition to look for her. I explained that I was looking after my Sire.” He adds.
