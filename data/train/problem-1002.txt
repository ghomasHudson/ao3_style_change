“There’s something more, you’re mad. Why are you? Oh, Mycroft.” Sigh, “What did my idiot brother do this time?” Exasperated.
A week later a box arrived with a Jerusalem postmark containing a rosary as well as a Star of David.
“John? Sarah’s on your phone, do you want to work today? One of the Doctors called in sick.” Sherlock calls through the closed bathroom door.
John stiffly nods back at her, “Ah, that’s, um good.” It’s not like he or Victor fell into the damned thing to begin with. Sherlock’s jaw tenses, John catches his eyes in the rear view and subtly shakes his head in negation. This is not the time or place to start an argument with his parents.
From the couch John calls out “What bloke could compare with Sherlock?”
Three more women are sold before the next group consisting of males from teen to mid-thirties are led out. The blond man is the last in line, his guard, sporting a recently broken nose along with two black eyes, is holding the ever-present lead extremely short. Sherlock quickly glances at the other slaves before fixating on him. There is something about him Sherlock can’t quite put his finger on. The fierce look is gone, his eyes look glassy and glazed over, obviously drugged. Looks as though he hasn’t shaved in a couple of weeks from the length of the beard on his face. There are a few bruises visible along his legs and torso that look like boot marks, recently inflicted. A new bruise is forming over the blonde man’s right eye, fresh blood slowly trickling down the right side of his face.
I lean over “John!” I cup his cheek. “John, can you hear me?” His eyes crack open “What do you keep saying?”
Kevin is rummaging in his bag as I walk up, he turns and hands me a pad. “Should have given this to you two before, helps with the recoil. I can help you put it on…” he looks at me “I keep forgetting to put it on myself when I come to the range.”
“John, we can’t chase criminals into our old age. We have a several good years left to us, but yes, I would like to retire to the country. I have notes for a book on how I conduct my deductions. I thought we could both go and write. That and raise bees.” He says the last while rubbing the ring on my finger.
They’ve just finished up a human trafficking case for DI Dimmok that was solved in just under 26-hours. During that time Sherlock didn’t sleep, eat or drink anything, not even the tea John had made for him. Sherlock had only consumed plain water, and that only because John forced it on him. A couple weeks ago, John had picked up supplies and made arrangements to run blood tests through Mike Stamford’s office. John felt mostly healthy and hale again other than a slight tingling in his left palm, ring and pinkie fingers from the damaged nerves in his shoulder. Where Sherlock had stitches was well healed and shouldn’t leave too visible a scar. Time for a certain Consulting Detective to have his long overdue physical.
“For what?” confused
“On that note, you’ll notice on here I’ve redrawn the county road in black marker and the red is the border of the property. I marked the houses I’ve left, inhabited ones in blue, and labelled a few other areas as well. The lady who had this cabin showed me around when she came to get the last of the stuff she wanted out of it. She’s renting my old place in Sonoma so if I have questions she’s willing to answer or come show me. Found this place through her, she and Diana were dog show friends.”
Mrs. Hudson leaves to presumably open the door for the ambulance.
Snow was falling outside, from the vantage point of the window next to their Christmas tree, Sherlock estimated the depth to be at least six inches already. The forecast called for more snow through the night. No people or cars were moving out on the streets that he could see. He and John could be the last two people on earth for all he could tell.
Sherlock starts to shake as John starts to rub his fingers over his prostate. John hums, “So far so good Mr. Holmes, everything feels healthy. Just a bit more…”
John looking a bit pleased with himself. “Bit of Army training, course my Granddad taught me a few tricks as well.” Sits down, close to Sherlock, grabbing his cup of tea. Reaching for the take-out containers, handing Sherlock his, “Eat.” Taking a bite of his own curry.
As he walks out John calls out, “Thank you Mycroft.” Mycroft waves his umbrella on his way out in acknowledgement.
“Good. See if Molly can watch Rosie tomorrow. We’ll make a day of it, we could both use a trim.”
John’s punishment list
Molly shrugs as Sherlock answers “Museum, though there are traces of dirt on this sample. Siberia possibly, they’re found in the permafrost.”
“This is our first holiday as a married couple and I want to have a family portrait taken. You agreed to it last week. We’re going to send this picture out as our Christmas card and have a print made up special for your parents and Mrs. Hudson as gifts.” Staring down at his husband, “Now uncross your legs so you can hold our daughter.” The last sentence a command.
“No sir. I finished the dinner dishes, put the rubber bumpers on the coffee table and started Irish oats soaking for breakfast.” As Sherlock reaches for his own toothbrush. He adds toothpaste to both toothbrushes. He leaves the key on the counter between us.
“Where is she?”
“I was waiting for you. The little lady here was too hungry to wait, sorry.” He gives her a spoonful of sauce. Rosie is kicking her legs and giggling in pleasure.
“It all depends on how you’re made to do them.” I finish my drink. As I rise to head for bed I realize the room is spinning and sit back down, hard.
“I don’t John, but you do and some hideous ones at that.” He shudders.
The three agents get back in their vehicle and follow the Jeep back to the ‘office’, Sherlock wanting to get a better perspective on these people before letting them know too much about the three of them.
“Saving him obviously,” raising the paddle with the number 25-1 on it again.
Sherlock doesn’t expect a reply, John leaves his phone in a locker while at his sessions at Bart’s. Feeling happier than ever he smiles at the glare from Donovan as he follows Greg into his office.
Everything that belongs to Rosie, even outfits she’s outgrown are packed. The crib parts are wrapped in spare blankets to keep the pieces from rubbing. They have a small debate over Mary’s belongings, in the end they take her jewelry to give to Rosie when she’s older. They leave Mary’s clothes and any furniture not needed behind to dispose of later. They did however, take all the rugs, towels and blankets.
She smiles and huffs at me “John! It’s your wedding night, there should be no distractions! Molly and I will be at her place along with Rosie, we’ll have a girl’s night. We will bring Rosie back the next day for the wedding breakfast.”
Sherlock blushes.
Violet ends the confusion, “I went to check on the guest room earlier, make sure everything was alright. The portable crib was set up and the babies’ things were neatly arranged across the bed. When I looked in your room dear boy (eyes on Sherlock), the wardrobe was open and I saw John’s clothes hanging next to yours.”
“The bullets stopped flying so I ventured out to see if I could help anyone, Jake was dead. Fred was shot in several places but was still alive. As I was assessing him, I felt a burning in my shoulder and Fred had a new wound in his head. I’m not sure what all happened after that, it’s all a pain filled blur.
“Lestrade. Probably stopped by to make sure there was nothing more to add to your statement.” Sherlock mumbled, sleepily, into my neck, pulling me tighter. His hot breath against my neck sent chills down my spine.
Sherlock opens another file showing a small bathroom “Shower, no tub.” He brings back the kitchen photo “The sink looks large enough to bathe Rosie in though, good.” Sherlock opens another picture of a long room with a high ceiling. There are a lot of windows and mounted animal heads, mostly deer, on the walls. A dining table with chairs a few squashy chairs, couch and a woodstove with a pile of wood next to it complete the picture. “Your friend likes to hunt? He has some impressive trophies.”
“She said she doesn’t mind…”
John sits back and looks at him. He’s serious. “I’ve never given you a physical, only patched you up here and there.” He’s a bit concerned now “Who is your General Practitioner?”
“They do little else.” Smirking.
I continue mingling with the rest of our guests, frequently checking on Rosie. Eventually, I work my way over to free Bill and dance with my husband again.
Behind us Mycroft raises his voice once more “Ladies and gentlemen, the reception is being held a short stroll away at Angelo’s restaurant. If you will please, just follow the happy couple.”
From the bench Sherlock replies “I’m right handed, I’ll start with the right.” He takes a breath, glances at Rosie and me, checking we’re still wearing our ear protection. “Ready?”
John and Sherlock in unison, “Stop what?” looking far too innocent after kicking one of London’s finest.
“I was hoping” John whispers back.
“Um, yeah.” He reaches into the bottom of the box to pull out clothes pins; they are clipped neatly together in a V formation. He just holds them for a moment then puts them on the table. I’m a bit puzzled, aside from the rope he’s handed me everything else from the box.
“NO MYCROFT!” Sherlock yells, furious, into his phone.
Post Reichenbach AU
John gives me a quick kiss then goes back to filling the tray on the table. Scrape, swick, swack.
“We’re coming, give us a minute.” John yells back. Then asks his husband, “Okay, what are we looking for anyway?”
John felt as though his heart stopped when a postcard showing the Las Vegas strip arrived from America. On the back was written ‘Wish you were here’ in a very familiar scrawl that shouldn’t be, its owner having jumped off a roof a year to the date before.
I am PISSED! Sherlock ran off after a killer once again without backup. I barely managed to keep up with the lanky git at first then lost him when he ducked down an alley. I went straight, apparently the killer did as well. As I rounded the corner I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye and ducked, thankfully. A pipe slams into my left shoulder, I stagger but stay on my feet.  As the next blow comes I am able to turn again as the pipe lands just below the last hit. As she pulls back for another strike I am able to wrestle Joan to the ground. I wrench her arm up behind her back, much further and I’ll dislocate it. It’s very tempting, my shoulder is throbbing.
Later, I end up on one end of the couch reading an old mystery as Sherlock taps away on his laptop stretched out on the other end, his feet in my lap. I’m absently massaging one foot at a time. After reading part of a chapter I notice it’s extremely quiet in the flat and look up. Sherlock is staring intently at me, I lick my lips and smile.
At this point I want to be certain this is what he wants, I know we talked earlier but I need to know. “Tell me what you want Sherlock.”
That seems to have done the trick. I hear the snick of the lube again as Sherlock lubes his cock, then takes himself in hand to insert himself. He goes so slowly teasing the tip of his cock around my hole. The look on his face is pure and utter delight when he finally inserts the crown. Sherlock starts to slowly fill me up, entering in slowly until he bottoms out and stills. I pull Sherlock down, lips meeting, breath mingling. ‘’You feel amazing, Sherlock. So, so good. Will you move for me, love? Slow at first.’’
John moans, “No Greg… don’t. Nausea.” Eyes still closed.
He gently rolls me onto my back and places a pillow under my hips and inserts a finger again. A few thrusts later another long sensuous finger joins the first. Sherlock starts scissoring his fingers opening me more and more. I can’t help but moan and pant needing more. “Please Sherlock, I need… more” all I seem to be able to do is moan and beg.
Five minutes later, we shadow Kevin, Sherlock still with Rosie, over to the garage, there is a blue jeep parked inside. “We’ll start with the generator, you’ll need that to run bigger appliances like the washer and dryer and dish washer. The lights can be on for hours with little drain to the solar batteries, most are LEDs.” He shows the shut off for the propane to the unit, how to check the oil and which type to use. So far so good.
Greg looks up frowning, “Was?” he questions.
Meanwhile Doctor Barnes is standing looking like a fish out of water, opening and closing her mouth. Finally she gathers her wits, “I beg your pardon! Just who do you think you are?” She demands from Mycroft.
Holding out his hand to shake hands, “I’m Scott, Scott Sigerson,” adding lower, “I’m trying to fit in, Mycroft thinks there is something foul going on… something about missing people being sold as slaves.” Tapping the picture of the blond man, “This one is too off to have been born a slave, looks like he is ex-military, wounded in action.” Pointing at the scar just visible on the man’s bare left shoulder. “I can’t tell his profession from the photo. He is glaringly different from the rest in here though. John Doe 6-5-1854.” Lifting the catalogue before dropping it back onto the scratched, stained, and pockmarked table.
The kettle clicks off and makes us both start a bit, we forgot all about it. “(Cough) Ok then. Sherlock make a pot of tea and a couple sandwiches then bring it all up to the bedroom. I’m going to shower and get ready for bed.” I do an about turn and head on up the stairs.
“I remember, I liked the one with the bowtie... Though you are still my favourite Doctor.”
John hisses as he feels a sharp pain run from the left side of his neck and down across his bare back to his right hip. He quickly turns around and grabs the whip as it descends again, wrapping it around his left forearm. He gives a massive pull while throwing a punch with his right hand at the man who just lashed him with a whip.
Greg drives us back to NSY, in his personal car, and leads us up to one of the small conference rooms where the files are laid out on the table. Sherlock opens the files and spreads the pictures above each folder then reads the notes. Every room was arranged in the similar pattern, bed, breakfront down to the placement of the artwork on the walls. Only jewellery was taken, even though a couple places had original canvases. He starts to get excited reading over the statements. “How you solve anything without help is a miracle.” He mumbles, barely loud enough for us to hear.
Both eyebrows raised, voice a bit louder, “It’s not the font you git! What language is this?”
Angelo comes over to the table to hand out menus and take drink orders, leaving glasses of water all around before heading off again. Greg looks guilty, and seems more upset by Sherlock’s reaction “Yeah, we wanted to keep it a secret. Mycroft and I both have enemies, don’t need to give them any more incentive after all.” I reach for my water and notice Mycroft’s eyes just about pop out of his skull. Ah, the ring, I smile at him over the rim. Angelo brings the bottles of wine we had ordered just then, so conversation takes a lull as he opens and pours wine and takes our food orders. As he is about to turn away I stop him.
Later that day, John is on his way to the St. Bart’s hospital gym again. Rosie stayed home today with Sherlock at his insistence.
“Good boy. When you’re finished come up to the bedroom, I’ll need help to shower and get ready for bed.”
First thing out of Mycroft when the speaker is on is “Greetings Doctor Watson”. John dislikes that greeting, it usually means trouble.
Sherlock will let him know if he wants him to move out. Odds are John would find his bags packed in the entryway when he returned from work if that were the case.
“You are brilliant!” Taking Sherlock’s hand to lead him up the stairs. “Let’s go cheer up our girl then!”
I’ve curled around Sherlock’s side, left arm over his stomach, legs entangled. I’m happy, sated and on the edge of sleep.
1.	Denied orgasm
Agent Burton then demands “I’ll need to get your statements.”
“What? On the couch?” Insulted.
POV flips between Sherlock & John
John contemplates going back to sleep when he hears a low babble coming through the monitor, Rosie must be awake. Her noises must have woken him up. As carefully as he can, while trying not to wake up Sherlock, John slowly extracts himself from the bed.
When the song is blessedly over Sherlock whispers in John’s ear while clapping politely with the other parents and guests. “The person who chose that song is a masochist!”
“Do you remember the location where you found it?”
He feels more awake for some reason. He let the Siri have all the food earlier as he was too stiff and sore to move when their handler delivered it through the slit at the bottom of the door. By the time he felt well enough to consider food, his companion had licked the bowl clean and has been sleeping almost continually since. He thought finally being full made the dog sleepy. Maybe there is something in their food? That might be while he feels groggy, mind fuzzy, times where his memory is blank but his body tells him something happened.
“Ta, did…” muttered, both eyes opened then John quickly blinks them shut, frowning, pressing his lips firmly closed.
He had been following Miss Wigglesworth for two months trying to gather up the courage to talk to her.  We ended up bringing Mr. Connor up to the flat with us to talk with Miss Wigglesworth, lending him a bit of moral support. They are going out on a date tonight, hopefully everything works out as they make a lovely couple.
Sherlock blushing, “I like it when you call me ‘love’.” Massaging further down my spine.
Kevin points across the way “See that white tower-like structure? That’s 100-yards. To the right of the tower are paper targets, should be easier to spot through the scope. Sit at the bench. Wait a minute, I’ll get a rest for you to use.” Kevin runs back into the barn, coming out with a metal rack and a couple of bags. “Shooting rack, takes most of the recoil.” Looking at me, knowingly. “These are sandbags, rest the barrel on them to steady your shot.” He places both before Sherlock sitting at the bench.
From the stage the auctioneer, with a large beer gut and rotting teeth, calls out “Going once, going twice. Sold to 25-1 for £575.00!” The gavel falls, “That’s it for today folks, our next sale is in a week.”
Rosie did give us a gift, she sat up for the first time by herself today!
While waiting for our orders Violet wonders “Why are you two getting married so quickly?”
“Oh God no! Why me? Can’t Mycroft being the elder son marry one of them or something?”
“No… she wants a child and wants us to be the fathers.”
Looking up John asks Mycroft, “What’s this a bribe?”
Lestrade notices there is a large calibre revolver in there and places John’s firearm next to it, still in the evidence bag. Sherlock locks the box and returns the key to its hiding place. The kettle clicks off as Sherlock asks Lestrade, “Tea?”
Rubbing Sherlock’s lower back with his right hand, “Don’t worry Mr. Holmes I’ll take good care of you. If you are amenable I can add a third finger…”
“Papa? Are you my Mommy?”
Sherlock reaches into the box and pulls out another item to hand me. “Yes. That is a bit and this is a ball gag. Though I do prefer to be able to talk, to use a safe word if needed.”
“Of course John.” Sherlock cuts the motor, removes the keys and pockets them upon exiting the vehicle out of habit. He grabs Rosie’s nappy bag and walks around to take her from me so I can exit. Kevin has already jumped out the back and pacing around looking at the ground.
John gives a thumbs up.
Knocking on the door while letting himself in the flat with his keys, “Hey Sherlock. Busy?” John greets.
“John, they’re trying to take over…”
Cautious, “It’s not just me anymore you remember?”
A few minutes later Nurse Levi comes in with a syringe and a tube of ointment. She stops and takes in the vision of a sleeping John wrapped around Sherlock. “I hate to wake him, he looks so peaceful.” She states, putting her medications on the table so she can sanitize her hands and put on gloves. “Let’s see if I can do this without waking him up.” Wiggling her eyebrows toward Sherlock.
“I said shoot him, not kick him dear brother. Doesn’t matter, get him up on his feet, I want this one here to watch me interrogate the good Doctor.” Brandishing a long, sharp knife in Sherlock’s face. From his position on the floor, John can tell Sherlock is trying not to let his emotions show.
Straddling my thighs, Sherlock mentions, “Eh, not sure about babe, you call Rosie that.”
“Just before my cousin Nancy shot herself, we noticed my aunt seemed to be having issues with her memory and wanted to have her checked by a neurologist to see if we could halt or reverse some of her memory loss. Kim convinced her we were sending her to a psychiatrist to have her committed so we could steal her house. The day of the appointment my aunt ran away from home to Kim’s flat. My mother and I were to drive her to the doctor.
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow at John, “That’s usually my side… Oh, the stitches. You don’t want to accidently bump them in the night.” Walks around the bed stripping, leaving a trail of discarded clothing behind him on the floor. “Maybe he wasn’t ready, or wanted something he thought he couldn’t have. I believe we had that in common from some of the looks he was giving you tonight.”
Body and Soul
“John, would you, um, ever consider getting married again? You once stated there wouldn’t be another wedding…”
4.	Inversion
I hear Greg “…took them long enough to find out they were in love with one another. Thought there wasn’t a chance after Mary.”
A smiling Sherlock next dances with his mother while I take on Mrs. Hudson. Greg and Molly are dancing, Mycroft frowning at them off to the side. Bill and Mike traded wives while Angelo is slow dancing with his. Siger is bouncing around with Rosie in his arms, both of them laughing.
Sherlock and I reply together “Yes. I’ll pay.”
We can’t seem to get away from crime even in the middle of nowhere! We somehow caught the attention of a serial killer who targets same sex families. Andrew Kidde found us in Fort Bragg when we went shopping and followed us back to the ranch. Sherlock’s brother, the British Government, was able to find out and warn us as the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an Interpol search on his intended victims, us!
“That was the one I figured he would wake up for. Let’s see if I can get the cream on without him waking too.” Nurse Levi whispers.
“They’re the only thing that does fit! How come your top covers your arse? Mine barely makes it past my navel…”
Out of the corner of his eye, John sees Sherlock rise and walk over, stopping in front of him. “John” softly. Sherlock uses two fingers to lift John’s chin to look him in the eye. “I have never been bored with you in all the time we’ve known each other. I could never be bored with you.” To accentuate the point, he leans down to give John a passionate kiss.
A muffled curse through the door. “If I go down, do either of you want any?” Greg asks.
Sherlock supplies, “They already look better than they did two hours ago.”
“Old habits die hard Mycroft, even you know that.” Sherlock quirks an eye brow at Mycroft
Sherlock removes both fingers. I moan in protest until I feel three fingers enter. The protest becomes pleasure quickly as he gently brushes against my prostate. I all but arch off of the bed in ecstasy. “Please Sherlock” panting “Please, I need… fuck me… I’m ready.”
“Hudders too.”
“How did you come by…?” Kreisler
Lestrade notices these bills go straight into the cashiers’ pocket. He bumps Sherlock’s hip with a small duffle bag, “Clothes.” Leaning in, “They’re clean, you can keep them as long as you need.”
“I told you what I wanted! None of these Omega have even come close to that. And quite frankly I’d rather have a male at this point, these women have too many emotions and their perfumes reek!” He bellows as he storms out of the room.
Sherlock glances at Mary, still glaring daggers at him, then makes eye contact again with John. Taking a deep breath, he declares, “Mary is pregnant. The baby isn’t yours.” At full volume with a slight echo from their position at the altar.
Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson went above and beyond when renovating 221 while Sherlock and I were on our ‘sex holiday’. The place feels the same, but… updated. The old wall into the flat was moved and the door to B flat is now at the top of the stairs to incorporate Rosie’s room into the main living area and expanding the lounge by several feet. The kitchen was remodelled, replacing the dented appliances, cupboards and countertops. Thankfully they didn’t replace the green glass tile backsplash Sherlock and I both like and repaired after the ‘Euros incident’.
“Ngh… you feel so good John… so tight.”
“Yeah. Shouldn’t be a problem for a few years. I can kip on the couch when she gets older.” Nervous again.
John woke slowly thinking Sherlock had tied him to their bed for some reason until the smell of a strange Alpha hits his nose. He knows that scent, he hasn’t had to smell it in years though. Acrid, sour… he treated the soldier after a skirmish in Helmand. John was promoted and transferred before the Alpha fully recovered.
“Well, this is the third body missing a head in three weeks. Last two have been Russian mafia blokes, this one has the same tattoo on his wrist as the others.”
<< Molly confirms that the victim death from cardiac arrest >> Sherlock informs him. << There are no signs of sexual violence, but traces of semen have been found on the victim's body and on the bathrobe he was wearing. Obviously not belonging to the victim. The cameras do not show that Byron entered the locker room. It is possible to  see him come out and no one else enters or leaves there before or after him >>.
Inspector Hataway puts his hands on his hips, to emphasize  what the two Londoners have just asked him is light years away from being able to be achieved.
<< I have no idea, John. Maybe we'll find out in the next few hours. I stay here, you bring the tests to the laboratory >>.
Sherlock tries to free himself. He feels his head spin, for the punches first and then the clash with the wall. He would like to cry out and asks John's help, but Martin's hand again blocks him.Suddenly the pressure of Martin's body disappears and Sherlock finds himself slumped on the floor, this time with his gaze turned to the wall. A long and persistent whistle invades his head. When he finally feels in control of himself, the typical noises of a fistfight reach his ears. Sherlock turns and has to blink several times to focus on what he sees. John's face is a mask of frightening anger. He hangs over Martin on the ground and hits his face, which has become a mask of blood, with a force Sherlock would never have attributed to him.
<< The forensic's men found the uniform with the tear, as you said. They were trying to force the PC password ... >> Greg says. Sherlock looks up at the sky and pushes him away from the door to enter the studio. He is forced to cover his nose and mouth affected by an intense smell.
Clear signs of four phalanges.
<< It helps me manage my mind. It ... goes too fast >>.
<< Sure, where did you think I were? >> answers Sherlock.
<< You were out of breath in front of George's story and I don't think I have to tell you why >>.
Three hours have passed since Sherlock's stormy awakening. Hours during which the doctor summoned Mycroft, which allowed John to attend the interview to talk about the possible presence of this syndrome.
<< Because he have also the other point of view. Sherlock the strict and decisive rule and you the pamper reassuringly >>.
<< Why? I don't need to stay here to work on the case >> says Sherlock.
<< What do you think the marks on his body were caused by? >> asks Sherlock.
Greg looks incredulously at the smug smiles of his children. He brings his hands to their faces that he always caresses with that fear of breaking or damaging them.
A strange silence falls between them. John holds Sherlock's hand, while massaging him wrist . It's crazy. All the times he has to touch his body it is to medicate him.
John nods, since he has found himself having to load Sherlock on the back, force him into the taxi, reassuring the driver that he is not dealing with a drug addict and his babysitter. Then, John drag Sherlock up the 17 steps, let him fall on the bed. And, finally, transporting himself to his room to take care of his aching back.
<< Breathe with me, Sherlock >>.
<< Just a little stress >> he says, minimizing the situation.
<< Who is Mark? One of the portal managers? >> Greg asks. The girl shakes her head.
<< Your are lucky, lady, because you have a brave son >> Mycroft continues, turning his gaze back to George who, called into question, barely looks up at him. << A boy who used the knowledge gained from watching movies to save his sister and who decided to turn to the consulting detective whose extraordinary talents his father speaks so much about, frightened by the idea that his sister could have ended in a bad trouble. This curiosity about the investigations that make you fear so much that he could decide to follow in his father's footsteps >> Mycroft says, smiling at the boy, who sketches a smile in turn. << In my opinion, he would be wrong if he didn't >> he adds, making George blush with embarrassment.
"Oh" exclaims Moriarty dejected. "It wasn't exactly how I intended to burn your heart."
<< The rooms are all empty, Captain >> Hataway tells him, while John observes the bathroom from the door. << Old Liland used these rooms for the patients. They all seem like hospital rooms, in fact. He was a methodical and organized man, as I said >> Hataway adds, scratching his head visibly uncomfortable. He must not have experienced more complicated cases than an accidental death or road accidents. This provincial inspector has visibly disturbed to find out that one of the women with whom he often spoke is a mad murderess .
<< Yes. I know, instead, that it wasn't you. You were too young when the murders started. You can't have taken part in it >>.
<< You was busy in these two days: everyone knows Morgan in the neighborhood! Angelo gave him a giant bone and  sais that you are too rigid >>.
<< He took advantage of you, of your moment of weakness. I can't  tolerate it! >> John says, hitting the Martin's genitals with his heel. He shouts, instinctively bringing the hands to the groin. He turns over on his side moaning in pain.
<< Sherlock, you  already put the sticks in the wheels to my intimate relationships. I don't need to take a dog >>.
<< It did it with you, though. It killed you >>.
<< John, they also told us that in storms like the one that is breaking down from them, it is normal that many areas remain isolated. Sometimes even for months! And the Lake District Ski Club is one of these >> insists Greg. << Sherlock had told them that it would drop before the weather alert, in order to escape the storm. You know him, he will have been caught by another clue and he will have wasted time, getting stuck up there >>.
<< No. Not now. I'm tired >>.
<< I should make you a list of things you do not know about me, John >> says Sherlock and the doctor notices in his voice a strange tone that could define mischievous. << What are you waiting for, get undressed >> adds Sherlock and John embarrassment reaches peaks so far never reached. << Will we spend the next few days shooting half-naked between strangers and are you having trouble changing in front of me? >>.
<< Oh, please Lestrade, can't you avoid it? >> Sherlock asks. << There are servants, you said. They will be able to take care of him >>.
With the help of Hataway, John contacted three of the four families who lives in the homes around the zone in which they found Sherlock's car, although he had already spoken to all of them, even if at different times. The three repeated that they had not seen anyone, much less rescued anyone. From the research conducted by the teams of volunteers put together by the men of Hataway, howhever nothing had come out.
<< Kelly! >> calls out loud, closing the door to the garden. << Kelly, where are you? >> William cries in fear, while Morgan growls louder now.
Time has flown. It is the dusk when John decides to have a dinner at the Angelo's. A way to allow Sherlock to sleep peacefully for a while longer. Here too the puppy is well known.
<< Really >>
John knocks on the front door and at the same time he feels himself an idiot. John opens it slowly without waiting for an answer and finds Sherlock sitting in his armchair, his eyes closed and his hands joined under his chin. John takes advantage of his flatmate's stay in his Mind Palace to quickly look around. There isn't the backpack in the kitchen and there isn't the guitar at the foot of the sofa. Only many notebooks and sheets of different types of paper bearing drawings and sketches scattered almost everywhere. They must surely be Rosaline Jackson's drawings, diligently delivered by Lestrade's men.
"I told you that there is at least a positive side in this story." Sherlock smiles amused by John's joke and Mary responds in turn, by smiling. He must be careful of all that confidence.
<< Deserves to die! >> she says, assuming the fierce expression of the evil Mary. Sherlock does not appreciate these exclamations, but below it, satisfies him to hear another person recognize that John's had not the best behavior he could have had.
Sherlock tries again to open his eyes to that unwanted contact and notices a large and dark spot that the man has on his left wrist. That hand feels too insistent, annoying.
<< Chief commissioner, if you attacks us, Morgan defense us, what do you expect? >> Sherlock replies standing up. William hides behind Sherlock's legs.
<< He doesn't need to be protected! William needs to feel involved in the investigation >>.
<< Charles >> says, remembering to be undercover. << What is this ... Aufguss? >>.
A terribly painful twinge pierces John's stomach. He bites his lip so as not to miss any moan.
<< So, Doctor, do you want connoting my brother emotionally? >> Mycroft chuckles and anger mounts in John's belly.
<< Very good >> Sherlock says, tapping John’s cheek with his left hand.
William would like to close his eyes but he can't. He sees Sharon bend her legs, ready to pounce on him, and he is breathless. Suddenly, Sharon screams and the knife slips from her hands.
<< Rosaline had already done it in the past ... >>.
<< Thanks >> the detective tells him after lighting the cigarette.
<< What are you doing? >> asks Sherlock.
<< But ... it doesn't make sense >>.
As he had foreseen, she spreeds the cream on Sherlock's face with the same care with which a bricklayer would spread the plaster on a rough wall. Mary pinches Sherlock's nose with that damned brush and he must resist sneezing, which is far from easy.
<< Sniffs its well, Morgan >> Sherlock asks and the puppy  pass the nose diligently over the entire surface of the footprints. When he has collected all the data he needs, Morgan sits on the tail, turning his eyes to Sherlock. << Now search >> Sherlock tells him, pointing to the sheets of paper. The little dog stops on each of the registration forms, sniffs them and go on. Sniff fast the sheets of paper on the five rows they created before stopping longer on one of this. He sniffs it several times, turning around it, leaving those present in suspense. Then, Morgan sits down and starts barking at the consultant. Sherlock with four great steps is beside him. He strokes Morgan's head giving him a little prize, that the puppy munches with satisfaction. Sherlock picks up the form and stands up.
<< No. Or rather ... at the beginning I told myself with these bullshit >> he admits, passing his hand over his tired face. << The reputation, the gossip, things like that. It is not that, however, that has frightened me >>.
<< Can you hear me, shit? >>. Martin mumbles a fatigued 'yes'. << Now we will call the police and hand you over to them and you, as a good child, will confess your crimes. Promise me, otherwise I will squize your penis so tightly to break it and make you impotent. I am a doctor, I know how to do it and I was you I would not challenge myself >>.
<< I will strive for his dreams to be broken >> John growls.
<< Exactly! And he is Morgan like Henry Morgan
He feels his eyes burning with tears and his body shaking.
"No! Rather, I cut my veins and I am done with it, " Sherlock thinks, realizing that he is so tense that his teeth screech. Mary withdraws embarrassed and gently takes the razor out of his hand.
<< Are you trying to tell me that my death would make you suffer? >> Sherlock chuckles in an attempt to break the embarrassment caused by the words of his brother.
John approaches the face to sniff the lips in search of the smell of alcohol, poisons or drugs that may have induced the girl to the extreme gesture or that she has introduced to take courage. Nothing.
<< Perfect. Let's go back to the central, then. We will print some to distribute in the districts and hang them at the meeting points. If your friend is alive, Captain, we will find him. Rumors are running fast in such a small country >>.
"Me too" John would like to reply, but he realizes that he would only make a slim figure. He has no idea what the things Mycroft is referring to. It cannot therefore make a comparison. And even if he could, this wouldn't ease his guilt. He acted like an asshole. As a great asshole. And selfish too. And yes, Sherlock didn't deserve it. It may deserve many things, given his character, but not this. No.
William runs away and the dog is immediately behind him. The girl snorts . << You will only make me waste time, Billy >> sighs and, climbed over the passed out nanny, enters the house.
He was always ready to put his hands in front of someone who dared to say something unpleasant about Harriet's lifestyle choices. John gave and took many to defend her. Both from direct actions and from simple insults in her absence. He may say, perhaps, that he experienced bullying for third parties, if this ever exists. John's sister apparently kept up with insults, threats, teasing and even attempts at violence by the macho on duty ready to convert the cursed lesbian. It has been a tough years for John and he can only imagine what someone with Sherlock's character and ways did not experience at school. John perhaps too often forgotten that the brilliant consulting detective was also a boy and a teenager.
<< What's the  problem? Live it as it is >>.
The man swallows conspicuously and moves just one step back, due the ardor of the Rifleman. The chief adjust his tie and cough nervously before looking at the child.
<< It was a pleasure to see you again Fox and I thank you for what you have done for my daughter >> says Greg to the journalist, offering him the hand that Fox shakes vigorously.
<< I have not really used these words >> Sherlock admits and John, at his side, brings his hand to cover the embarrassed eyes.
<< You come here in a hurry >> Sherlock welcomes him, sitting at his armchair. In the center of the room there are Greg and George, one confused, the other nervous and embarrassed.
Ford's house is silent. Margaret retrieves the key from a porch tile and a shiver seizes it now that she sets foot inside. William tells her enthusiastically how Morgan understood who kidnapped them, by pointing to some of the registration forms still on the floor. The woman looks at her son with loving eyes. She kneels before him.
<< My brother knows how to be magnanimous, John. You better than anyone else should know >>.
Sherlock observes the mass grave from its edge. The cobalt blue scarf protects his throat from the cutting wind. He pulled up the collar of his coat and barely feels his fingers getting cold inside the deer leather gloves.
<< Do you and your friend live together? >> Mary asks him, suddenly changing expression. A shiver runs down John's back, in front of those serious eyes and tense face. There is no longer any trace of the shy girl in this woman now, and what has taken her place calm down the doctor.
<< I know that you are not what dad said you were. That you never did sex in order to earn something >>.
The sound of a masterfully played guitar reaches them. It comes from the fountain in the square, beyond a small group of people grouped around a young street artist. Sherlock heads towards them attracted by the music.
<< This does not mean anything. The car door could have cloded by falling >> mutters John.
<< 'Do ut des'
<< Nothing different, except the fact that she no longer showed us her drawings, as Mr Holmes said >> she says, just looking up to meet the Sherlock's investigator gaze.
Sherlock ignores John, quickly swallowing a potato, seeing the woman ready to put another in his throat.
<< Morgan, come here! We are at the crime scene. You must not leave traces >> Sherlock reprove him and the dog immediately jumps to his side keeping up. << Call your men and give me five minutes, Lestrade >> Sherlock orders to the tired detective.
<< Come on, John, do you think that such a powerful man doesn't have a place among my celebrities? >> Sherlock asks, glancing at him. The doctor ignores him and sits down on the armchair, sipping his tea. Morgan crouches on his feet and stares carefully at the consultant's every move. << My dear, we are about to deal with an authentic bastard >>.
<< Sherlock, wait, let's talk about ... >>.
Alone in the silence. No. He doesn't want to be. It is too strange.
<< Only if doing it does not involve breaking it with punches >>.
<< Its are the ones who Sharon created and presented at O'Hara during the creative writing workshop >>.
John is amazed at Sherlock's sensible and adult speech. The boy shakes his head in annoyance and clenches his fists, giving the idea of not having acepted what he has been told at all.
Ella's voice tells him.
<< Yes, you understood correctly. Howard Byron has bruises that could indicate an assault as being the consequence of an occasional relationship consumed the night before in the locker room. The inspector Lestrade will inform you of how the facts went >>.
<< It's too warm here!! My neurons are melting >>.
<< You don't trust Scotland Yard? >> John asks, surprised by so much nervousness.
"It's terrible," he thinks, stung by a thousand icy pins.
<< What's going on? >> he asks, curious.
<< Fantastic >> John whispers in ecstasy.
<< What is mean this? >> John shouts at the men who almost completely freed the car from the snow. This is upside down. The four wheels in plain sight.
<< Maybe the beer had a higher alcohol content >> Sherlock mutters amazed.
<< You didn't tell either of them what your sister did two months ago >> deduces Sherlock and the boy looks at him in amazement. George swallows several times before slowly nodding, his gaze down. << And you fear that she will repeat it >> Sherlock adds and the boy tightens his eyes from which some tears fall.
Sherlock must be admitted that, however disturbing she is, he is perfectly in line with her judgment.
"No? So who did it, Sherlock? Aren't you going to tell me that you are also the type of person who, after the first time, starts to give it away without any mercy? Take a look at how quickly you can go from to be a virgin to to be a whore. "
<< I will reply when we are out of here in more humane temperatures! >> retorts acid. << You fathom the video footage of the cameras, especially the one out here, and you will find your other man. You should be able to interrogate him and understand if you are dealing with a rapist or with an occasional lover so fiery as to make his partner heart attack >>.
<< And from that moment on they started bullying you >> says Sherlock to Lizzy, again surprised by his intuitions. Greg makes the consultant's astonished gaze travel to his daughter, while George shakes his disconsolate head.
<< Here it is >> he says, opening the file dedicated to Albert Ford.
<< From an overdose, no. From a withdrawal symptoms, yes >> points out his brother, by offering him more water.
<< I'm not crazy, Mycroft. You know how a Mind Palace works. Even you came to my aid. You spurred me to relive that scene. That terrible moment when I had to run away from our father for the second time >>.
John leaves the pub followed by the half-sleepy puppy. He stroll slowly, enjoying the cold but pleasant evening. When John reaches 221B everything is still shrouded into the silence. He climbs the 17 steps holding the puppy in his arms.
<< You are sure, John >> Sherlock asks him, looking up from the message he received to bring him on him. John supports him, resolute and convinced, taking a step towards him.
<< During the Aufguss timetable there were seven other people besides the sauna teacher: four women and three men: Christian Robinson, Martin McNeel and Robert O’Hara >>.
John seems to cheer up his words.
Sherlock asks him to climb over his back and the enthusiastic child clings to his shoulders. Morgan barks at that strange new game.
Sherlock takes the lens from the case and this time it's John's turn to take his jacket. The consulting begins to scan all the walls and only when he reaches the one furthest from the front door does he stop victorious.
<< Hey, but didn't you say not to stand up? >>.
<< Oh, yes, it is there >> William run, but stops suddenly. << To get there, however, we must pass between them >> whispers the child, indicating the men of the scientific department.
John is still amazed by this sudden change. He takes a moment to shake, before answering.
After the dinner John goes out on the street in the sparkling evening of this early spring. An annoying drizzle has dampened the streets and the puppy sniffs everything that happens to him before blessing him with pee. John decides to lengthen the  walk for facilitate digestion. John receives a message and picks up his cell phone thinking is Sherlock. Instead it is Greg who writes to him. The consultant must still be among the Morpheus's arms.
<< Then I will not fail to try it >>.
<< You said you omitted the truth to prevent the relationship between Greg and Sherlock from deteriorating >>.
<< Why is he so lucky? >> asks John a little annoyed.
<< Oh Lord, yes! >>.
Finally Mary stops. She turns to him and a terrible smile is drawn on her lips.
<< Because you can't wear a beard too and you need something to cover your face. Put these too >> a pair of black colored contact lenses passes him.
<< Since when are you so involved in a case >>.
<< You are right. Ashley doesn't deserve it >> he says and he's not even sure that that's the girl's name. << See you tomorrow morning >> he says, keening to go away.
"What good is it, already?" thinks John.
<< Show it to me >> he says and the consultant takes a moment to understand what he is referring to. Sherlock gives to him his bruised wrist and John turns his nose up at the ability of that white skin to blacken at the first tap he suffers.
Chapter 9
<< Those threats, as well as the tutor who was assigned to them, all arrived from a cell located in the Caribbean, a clear sign of the presence of a hacker who wants to keep hidden from his true position >> continues Fox. << Daisy and Rosaline found themselves mixed in something even bigger in the already big mess they had entered. With their mania for protagonism, they have made known to the Masters who Elisabeth's father was, pushing the Master to exclude her. The goal, however, was to carry her forward >>.
<< Sherlock, you're not working alone, are you? >> Fox asks him and his hesitation counts as an answer.
<< I don't know, John. I have to understand the meaning of the drawing that she is engraved on the skin before venturing hypotheses >>.
<< If you say so >> the girl shrugs, tucking the cap over her ears.
John runs his hands over his face, worried that the sensation he feels on the skin may correspond to reality. Mycroft continues to peer at him silently. John cannot understand how Mycroft can be so calm after what he told him.
<< One of the last audiences? Does that mean that there are also private individuals? >>.
Margaret holds her arms tight against her chest. She give angry looks at her ex-husband at regular intervals. She pays little attention to the man in elegant suit that is talking to her. Margaret attention is all directed to the red hairs man, who, together with the consulting detective much praised by her ex, have taken possession of her daughter's room.
<< What you've done? >> she cried, in horror at the blood that had spoiled her precious sheets.
<< So what it is? >> he challenges him, by raising his voice. Some people, annoyed, ask him for silence.
<< The apple pie? Sherlock, you ate it yesterday morning to celebrate the ending of our last criminal investigation >>.
<< I hated him. I've always hated him >> Sherlock admits.
<< Always, I promise you >> John says taking his hand. << Not just for this. For me it's not only this, Sherlock >>.
<< Hi, little one, hello >> Sherlock says. The puppy answers the greeting by licking his nose. << Hi John >> sais to him, hugging the puppy.
"This, however, does not change your situation, my friend," says the man, clapping him on the shoulder. Moriarty leans in turn to observe the corpses frozen by the cold. "Solved or not, soon you too will find yourself part of this cheerful gang."
<< As I said, I think you is making the right choice, madam. If civil ways do not have the desired effect, do not hesitate to contact me. I confirmed the American death sentence of our landlady's husband, it will be very simple for me to find the skeletons in Mr Ford's closet. If you want to destroy it, madame, I will gladly help you >>.
“Not your concern.” John commands. Sherlock smirks.
“Yeah, they each had those sad puppy eyes for each other. But they never seemed to do it when the other was watching! We had pools at the Yard as to when they’d finally figure it out.” I thought I was alone with my feelings for Sherlock, if we’d only known sooner!
“Bladder infection…” he mumbles. Ah!
“You do realize there is a lot I don’t know about you either. All I’ve learned is what little you and Greg were willing to share, which isn’t much.” I feel him tense again “It’s okay if we have secrets from one another, so long as those secrets are not harmful. But saying that, I will tell you whatever you want to know about me. If it is any consolation, you are the first man I trusted enough to bottom for; I only allowed fingers before. Good and bad, you’re stuck with me, I’m not going anywhere.”
“I’ll teach you… we can work on your skills while you help me recuperate. You should be ready by Christmas. Ouch!”
“Alright, £300 once, £300 twice…”
Throwing his arms up in frustration again John heatedly reports, “I haven’t been in the same room as Sherlock for over a month! The last time we spent together was solving the Carruthers case. That was about a week after his Heat. He’s been avoiding me ever since, I thought I’d done something wrong!”
“How could I? I blamed him for something he didn’t do then beat the shit out of him.”
Before they can hear Sherlock replies, “Of course John. You are always welcome. It’s your home too.”
“You have a tan wool dressing gown. The blue one is silk. Are you sure you’re feeling alright Sherlock?”
“I won’t risk you or Rosie.” Angry
I’m preparing to start supper when Sherlock’s mobile goes off. Greg, a body, woman, no visible method of death; his third in three months. This victim’s husband found her when he returned from a business trip, he had an air tight alibi. Greg claims it’ll be at least a seven but I have my doubts. Mrs. Hudson is a saint and agrees to feed and watch Rosie while we’re gone.
“Shhhh, keep your voice down. You and Mycroft are the only ones who know, well, and a few of his minions.”
Inside, Mycroft is sitting next to Greg who has a guilty look on his face. Molly is sitting across from him giggling at the look on his face. Mycroft is just as stoic as always. “Greetings all” I announce as I pull out a chair next to Molly for Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock and I take two of the remaining chairs next to a high-chair for Rosie. “So, Greg, Is this the secret person you’ve been dating lately?” I ask while giving Mycroft a quick wink. Sherlock is still scowling at them. I take his hand under the table and give it a gentle squeeze to behave.
Sherlock’s brow furrows “How many cabins are on this property? Did you dismantle all the ones you don’t want to keep?”
We’re home, well at least in England anyway. We flew back, spent a couple weeks at Baker Street with Mrs. H then decided to visit the house in Sussex, a few miles south of Eastbourne, to see what needed to be done. I’m glad I made a reservation, just in case, at a local hotel as the house was bare. It wouldn’t have been a problem for Sherlock and me to rough it, but Rosie really needs a bit more. The only thing the previous owners left inside the house were the drapes. We toyed with the idea of looking at furniture stores in the area but decided just to take measurements and shop at our leisure.
“I know love, I just can’t help myself. Come let us finish up in here and have a kip. We have some time.”
“I love you too John.”
“Out with it!” he demands.
“I hear nothing from him when you are on ‘hiatus’, he tells me nothing of the assassin I start dating and end up marrying. But, when I’m finally, truly happy, the fat arse warns me away from you!”
“As you keep saying you aren’t gay John. Will you be ok with this?”
The guard is turning a deep crimson, pulling the lead tighter causing the blond man to gasp for air.
A twenty-minute cab ride later, they arrive on scene. It must be brutal as Lestrade is waiting outside for them. “Hi guys, thanks for coming.” Greg greets at they walk up. “This one is bloody…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We have a contract, you know that. Your sister Euros was supposed to marry Coronel Watson’s eldest but fate decided against them.“
“Rosie and I watched a show about a gingerbread house competition and she wanted to give it a go.”
Behind me Lestrade exclaims “What? Another crime scene?”
Thoughtful again, “Just one sandwich, I’m not very hungry, we can share. I could do with a decent cup of coffee though, black two sugars?” hopeful.
“Yes, we gathered that.” Siger says. Both parents notice the surprised looks on John and Sherlock’s faces.
“After he almost died again. I haven’t forgiven myself for what I did to him.”
We find Greg in the master bedroom along with a couple technicians collecting evidence. The dead woman is laying in the middle of the bed in a fancy looking lace negligée. Sherlock whips out his magnifying glass and starts looking at everything, starting with the body.
It’s still light out when we’re finished cleaning up from dinner. Kevin offers “I use a place just up the road for an office if you want to check your email, the internet signal is strongest there.”
He closes this file and opens up ‘freezer”. Inside is ice cream in several flavours, what looks like another gallon of milk and more orange juice. Several sealed packages of red meat and chicken. A few bags of frozen vegetables and what look like vacuumed sealed soups and stews. The next file is ‘close up freezer’, the packages in the freezer are labelled ‘venison’, ‘quail’ and ‘pork’ respectively. “Looks like he had a successful hunting season so far from the looks of this freezer” Sherlock concludes.
Greetings all,
“Yes husband?” mumbled.
Fort Bragg was interesting. We stopped at the Mendocino Coast Botanical Garden and Van Damme State Park on the way. I didn’t pack a picnic lunch today, figuring we could eat somewhere in town. Wandering downtown we found a bakery that had bread that smelled so good Sherlock went in and bought a loaf. We ended up breaking apart pieces of the ciabatta loaf and eating most of it while wandering across the Pudding Creek Trestle. In the end we went back and purchased another loaf to take back to the ranch with us. For a late lunch we stopped at Piaci Pub & Grill for pizza, I wasn’t going to order a beer but couldn’t resist trying ‘Kilt Lifter’, Sherlock tried a sip and pronounced it decent. After lunch we went shopping for supplies at Safeway.
"Keep going, Sherlock," John tells him. At this time even in the John's tone of annoying voice he hears the worry vibrate.
<< Punishment! >> shouts Mary, finally saying a word of complete meaning. She grabs Sherlock by the broken leg and drags him off the bed. Sherlock feels a dull but bearable pain and just grumbles when he falls off the bed. The drips to which he is attached detach from the support and and crawl on the ground behind him. The woman mumbles meaningless words, as she drags him down a flight of stairs. Sherlock holds the trolley close to his chest and tries to put strength on his abs so as not to collapse with a dead weight on every single step. From the stairs Sherlock is then dragged onto the dusty carpet that covers the entire corridor. He hardly feels the tingling it causes on his bare buttocks and surely scratched by rubbing with the ground.
<< How do you expect to understand it? >>.
The doctor, who remained diligently as always on the edge of the crime scene, approaches the consultant, who is standing a few steps from the body lying on the floor. He kneels beside what was a beautiful girl of just 16 years old. He sighs trying to remain as professional and detached as possible, as taught him the years of specialization in medicine first and those on the battlefield then. John bring his gloved fingers close to brushing the girl's left arm on which she has engraved, with a razor blade, the strange draw that then killed her, staining the bedroom carpet with her blood.
<< Two girls who didn't know each other, coming from totally different environments, commit suicide and the only thing they have in common is that drawing >> he says, pointing to the open photo left in plain sight on his armchair.
<< What a funny name >> she chuckles.
He looks down trying to regain control of himself. John turns his gaze to Sherlock, who does not distract his from the boy, while giving him time to compose himself and continue.
<< Listen, Mycroft, what happened between me and your brother ... >>.
<< It is evident, Giles! Look at him! >> Sherlock says, pointing to the boy, that stay with his nose one palm from his pc's screen.
This, however, does not come. Sherlock barely opens one eye, wary, and finds Mary motionless, her hand raised fifty centimeters from her face. The vague gaze, the grim expression. It almost seems that someone has stopped time, as they usually do in the obvious and banal plot movies that John likes so much. Sherlock is almost tempted to raise his hand and touch her, to realize if all this is really happening or is the result of a hallucination. Suddenly, however, the woman recovers and leaves the room, leaving him alone.
The ringing of the telephone interrupts the sonata in C minor that Sherlock played. John's name flashes on the screen, giving him a sense of urgency.
He gets no answer downstairs. No thud of footsteps to make the steps creak.
<< About your girlfriend >> she insists. Sherlock have the perception to find himself in front of a curious and impertinent six-year-old girl.
John can understand the reason for his pain. He too has had the opportunity to become attached to the child-Mary in these few days lived among courts, lawyers, asylum and structures to which to ask to host her. Mycroft did not put the sticks in their wheels, but he did not even try to help them, convinced that it was just an absurd madness.
Sherlock takes place at the top, as far away from John and his woman as possible. Check that the beard is not coming off due to the heat and sweat and finally knows the sauna master. The sauna master greet those present explaining what is going to do and what the rules are. Then, he pours water on the stove. A dense cloud of flavored steam invades the environment.
<< I would have preferred mass murder >> says Molly, giggling nervously.
<< And we just need to lighten our spirit >> Sherlock says getting out of bed.
<< He will never forgive me. Even if he were really in danger and I saved him from certain death. I don't hope that a heroic act will change the disaster I made, Greg >>.
<< I have black, red dye and one to gray the hair >> says Sherlock.
"'The captivating adventures of  Captain Three Continents  Watson". Sounds good as a title! I'm sure the number of visitors would skyrocket with all that sex. "
Sherlock proceeds John swiftly up the 17 steps of Baker Street. John immediately noticed how fast Sherlock is to walking with crutches. John looked bad when i walked with that old stick and was slow as a turtle. The doctor sighs, realizing how even in these conditions Sherlock manages to be better than him.
<< It is not mentioned! >>.
William hears her  nearest voice.
<< You have been very good. Have you seen how many results you have achieved? In a little while you will be able to jump on it >>.
John picks up his cell phone and quickly types the girl's reply message. He hurries to reach Baker Street so he can prepare in a flash and reach the meeting place, hoping not to give the idea of having completely forgotten about it.
Sherlock begins to walk slowly and John follows him, annoyed by this strange attitude of reserve.
<< The boy >> exclaims Greg.
<< Goodnight, Edward >> chirps.
<< The chief commissioner would not appreciate his presence. That's a miracle that he allowed me to ask for your advice >>.
<< Leave her, Morgan! >> shouts Sherlock's deep voice and the puppy obeys. << Give me a good reason not to kill you here, now >> he whispers to the woman, bending her right arm behind her back.
<< Was the cardiac arrest therefore caused by a dispute with another individual? >> hypothesizes Greg. Sherlock sighs.
<< It does not seem appropriate to waste time with useless experiments! >> says the chief commissioner, who did not like his suggestion to leave the scene. Sherlock slowly turns to him imitated by William. In sync, the consultant and the child sigh, roll their eyes and then leaving Margaret Ford's study.
John sighs. It annoys him to have to agree with her. John sits on the sofa and absently looks at the object that triggered the quarrel. How many times has he found himself sharing a bed with a friend? What's wrong, then, if two men both sleep in a bed. Sherlock, in fact, doesn't sleep when he works. No. John is wrong. He's giving Sherlock reason and taking all the blame for himself and that's not fair. Sherlock wants to be a drama queen? That it is!
<< The silence. All this silence scared me >>.
<< It is possible, it affects a lot the mood and here there is enough to drive anyone crazy >>.
Sherlock leaves his Mind Palace and turns his gaze to the door at the exact moment it opens, introducing the detective into their private space.
<< Is Mr. Holmes there? >> Lizzy whispers, brushing aside only half of the blanket of hair with her small hand with black lacquered nails. The many bracelets on his wrist jingle first going down to the elbow, then falling back to the wrist when she puts her hand back on her hip.
Mycroft stayed with them in the room for a long time. Sitting on a chair on the other side of the bed, or standing at the bottom of the room. Silent, discreet, Mycroft absent himself every now and then to answer the phone and for longer periods to follow what was happening to Mary Abbott.
<< You can't stop him. He is his brother, as well as the most powerful man in England >>.
<< Go ahead with me, I am not offended >> says that woman in a mischievous tone. She places a big hand on the back of John's neck and pushes him towards her, pressing her lips against him.
<< What banal beers you drank, my friend >> laughs John emptying his glass. << Don't tell it around, okay? I'm not ready for official coming out yet. When my sister did it my mother almost had a heart attack. I am still traumatized by the side effects of the truth >>.
John laughs nervously. An unpleasant laugh, full of anger, which amazes the consultant.
<< Why this name? >>.
<< What's wrong with you tonight? >> Sherlock asks, his eyebrows arched in a funny expression between the worried and the confused.
<< What are you doing here? >> Sherlock welcomes him, even before John takes a step inside the apartment.
<< Thank you, Mary, it was all excellent >> Sherlock increase the dose, trying to shape a convincing smile.
<< I don't even think about it, Harry. I love you, little sister. Take care of yourself >>.
<< It looks interesting >>.
<< Jesus, Greg! Are you serious? >>.
Sherlock agrees. John invites him to sit on the sofa and sits down beside him. He takes Sherlock’s left wrist and begins to count.Sherlock watches John. The warmth of his hand around his wrist is pleasant. He must try to prevent himself from approaching his forehead and placing it against John’s temple, in the frantic search for reassuring physical contact.
<< Are you already done? >> she asks in amazement, offering him the bowl full of the usual boiling chicken broth. She sits next to him and as always watches him eat slowly. When he is done, she gets up with the usual urgency, ready to load him on her arms and bring him back inside.
To you we acclaim, we exiled children of Eve:
Finally, Sherlock's hands fascinated John. Big hands, confident in grabbing evidence, in recovering clues, in bringing punches if necessary. Hands that act with the same aseptic precision of Sherlock's thoughts, when he works on his experiments, when he cares to derive answers from the evidence he recovers. The same hands that John first strong squeeze in front of the door of what would become their home. The last soft and lukewarm squeeze, even, while taking care of the wrist that John injured him.
Sherlock and John join Greg, that talk to a girl in her thirties. She has blond hair pinned in a large cignon, and her face marked by tears. She still sobs silently. The detective introduce them to the woman.
<< Where? >> Sherlock asks William, crouching beside him, Morgan immediately behind.
<< What's the problem? >>.
"Oh" exclaims James caught by lighting. “It is your father, then! He is the final problem to be solved. Yes, in fact everything is lined up. John made you feel like a whore and Mister Holmes was the first to says that you are a whore, am I right? ”.
<< Yes, especially since Gustav, the sauna master, brought the Aufguss. We can go together if you want >>.
<< Does your father know you didn't go to school this morning? >> Sherlock asks the boy, who almost risks falling from the chair he just sat on. He turns a worried look on the consultant, who in return observes him calmly.
<< You are the best and only consultant detective, I expect to spend hours there not days >> retorts, entering the bathroom again.Sherlock snorts and walks nervously back and forth.
Sherlock opens his eyes, amazed to hear Mycroft's voice after so long.
<< And Mr Ford kicked her off >> Sherlock concludes for her. The woman nods and turns her  gaze to the child.
<< And then for the rest of her days, since they'll find her guilty >>.
A pendulum clock ticks noisily. Mark six, but, given the soft light of the room, it is not easy to understand if is the morning or in the evening.
<< I see a woman almost one meter and eighty tall, with thick and muscular limbs as I happened to see them only in men who are used to splitting wood. She has a square face, a broad forehead and very fine hair held tight in a tail that makes her head seem even bigger. When she wore the fur hat I struggled to define its gender. The hat is old, although it is well kept, as are all the other clothes she wears. A clean person, nothing to say, but scruffy. She was cold. She continues to pull up her scarf to cover her cheeks reddened by the cold. She wears a pair of leather gloves that, although they are large, for men, are small for the huge hands that she finds himself. Hey… wait a moment >>.
<< Nothing relevant. Apart from the presence of that drawing practically everywhere, in an obsessive way >> Sherlock replies and John turns up his nose. He knows well how his flatmate spent the afternoon and also the night. John really doesn't think Sherlock had time to rummage through the personal belongings of the young Rosaline. He cannot understand why the consultant is taking this case lightly, to the point of allowing himself an escapade in full investigation.
John thinks, approaching the puppy, that tends his legs towards him. John caresses him, smiling at his quick licking his hands. Sherlock washed the puppy with one of his precious shampoos, judging by how much it smells, and his fur, despite the dim light of the room, seems have a pleasant chocolate tone. Despite the washing, it's impossible to understand the puppy's breed .
<< I know their methods better than you, I collaborated with them for a year in Madrid >> Sherlock says and John is amazed at his words. Sherlock, so attached to his London to the point of abandoning it only if it is necessary for small and short periods, has been away a whole year in Spain with Fox and his colleagues.
Sherlock also ignores Mycroft's unfriendly findings. Yes, it's possible he's going crazy. That the constant presence of morphine in his body and the presence of a dangerous woman are acting in an unhealthy way on his brilliant brain to the point of making him go out of his mind.
<< No! We are here on business. The rest is just a distraction from the crime investigation >> he says, taking a change of clothes.
<< Did you and Sherlock have a discussion before your departure? >>.
“You, on the other hand, have to stick to the words he said to you. Words, words… well, they're just words you're turning into a problem. The final problem, we could say, given the importance you are giving it. And for this 'problem' you are willing to let a furious madwoman do what she wants with you. Oh my God, it's ok our dear doctor, but that woman ... uff! " huffed in horror. “A woman, Jesus! Here you are again endangered by a woman. "
<< We never liked how that man treats his wife and son >> says Kelly.
<< I only know that she threw you away like I was garbage. I know I could be in a morgue to recognize your lifeless body, right now, rather than here >>.
<< I didn't think it appropriate to put Lestrande aside from the whole one >>.
<< I think it is appropriate to make friends, you and me >> John says, scratching the puppy's nose.
<< Your friend has a funny name >>
"You taught me something new Sherlock, yet another!" John thinks, sighing, now that the door before him opens and Mary Abbott enters, accompanied by another guard.
<< Ah, obviously. This is typical of you >> retorts Greg with a chuckle. << I' am happy that you are still here >> Greg says giving a pat on John's back. << Maybe I was a little too strict with you >>.
"Mycroft!" Sherlock thinks, his throat too dry to scream. He is about to take a step back, but gets stuck in doubt. Sherlock take a closer look at the pale, flesh-faced face, surrounded by tousled hair, but sparse on the forehead. The dark and crazy eyes that are pointing at him are not Mycroft's. The white and slightly crooked teeth he sees from the terrible grin that the man addresses to him are not those of his brother.
<< Admit it, you are surprised >> John says triumphantly.
<< This is already suspect >> notes John.
“Not really hungry, order whatever you want.” Stress headaches also bring nausea.
Doctor Barnes lifts an eyebrow at Sherlock, responds annoyed, “I was asking the patient.” Turning back to look at John, speaking to him as to a child, “Now Doctor Watson, how do you feel?”
“Your Daddy has been looking all his life for a magic hat without success after all.” Sherlock adds, just as calmly.
I squeeze back. “Then you can’t expect it of me either. I have to be there when you need me. You have to let me do that. No matter what or when. That is what it has to be with you and I. We need to trust each other.”
I feel a bit tired and lay down across the bed along the pillows, propping my crooked right leg on them; left leg hooked over the side. I only close my eyes for a minute taking a few deep breathes. Next thing I know, it’s an hour later and I hear Rosie crying and I’m covered with one of our new blankets.
“Okay.” Opening his briefcase and handing over a stack of files, “Mycroft sent people to change my office door and replace the windows with bullet proof glass. What’s going on, should I be worried?”
“Almost done, last picture” this one is labelled ‘back porch/door’. There is an antique claw foot tub on the deck, it looks fully plumbed. “There is a tub, might be too cold to use it if all the firewood is any indication.” Sherlock states. “Hopefully the weather cooperates, it looks big enough for two…” he rises his eyebrows at me with a knowing smirk.
The Personal Blog of
“Understood Doctor, I will be in touch. Good luck.” Mycroft hangs up.
Sherlock looks to me, lifting an eyebrow “Care to add to this story?”
Smiling, “I’m thinking of it as more of an open marriage or I may give being a polygamist a go.”
I growl back, a bit calmer than I was “Donovan. She needs to lay off the insults already!”
Sherlock “John…”
John levels his gaze and pulls out his I-expect-to-be-obeyed, pissed off, Captain Voice “No. We are going to bed. You three are going up to the office for the night. You, Agent Burton, will be waking your colleagues every 2-3 hours. If, and only if, they do not wake you are to come down and get me. Knock until one of us answer the door, do not come in uninvited.” He shifts the gun in the holster on his hip to remind them he can hit a target in the dark.
“Sneaking? You were watching Rosie! Hey, who the bloody hell is watching her now? You didn’t leave her all alone did you?”
Mycroft tilts his head and gives me a penetrating gaze. “I am just checking up on you and my dear brother. I do still worry about him after all. I have information that he is acting strangely of late, I wonder what that is all about.”
What Rosie really liked was the day we spent in San Francisco before meeting up with Kevin. She truly adored the barking of the sea lions at Pier 39. She’s really loving playing with Kevin’s two dogs as well (maybe it’s the barking?). We may have to look into getting a dog when we get back to London (Sherlock?).
“Hmmm, it’s warmer already. Where did you learn to do that John?” Sherlock leans against his chair sipping his perfect cup of tea.
So far, the oddest content of any of the boxes was an extremely colorful full sized sombrero hat with a postmark from El Salvador. Looking closer at the hat John found one dark, curly hair under the inner band.
“Need more incentive Doctor Watson? Doctor Stamford told me you have a child, we offer subsidized 24-hour child care, available 7-days a week. I would really like to lock you down before you’re discharged. Since it will be several months before the position is open, I have been approved to offer you a retainer.” Doctor Murray offers.
Lestrade watches the exchange. “Alright, what’s going on with you two? You’ve been acting strange for a couple weeks now!” He demands.
Dr. John H. Watson
“I’ll leave Sherlock to explain, I’ll pop back up in a bit with tea and biscuits.” Mrs. Hudson leaves.
After, I fill and click on the kettle and fry a couple of eggs apiece along with toast. We eat our breakfast in silence, each to our own thoughts. Grinning at one another off and on. When done I put the dirty dishes in the sink to deal with later. I turn to see him standing behind me.
John cracks an eye open, “Morning Mycroft. Did you stay all night?”
“He kept chanting and charging at the officers who showed up, keeping them back. One thing you must note is the ceiling in the hallways were lower than the flats on either side. The heating, electrical and plumbing for the building was run through them. Anyway, the ceiling was too low to turn the harpoon around, he could only turn in the stairwells or in one of the flats.”
John gets out a, “Ta” as Sherlock enters stating, “yes, thank you Mrs. Hudson, now please move I need to take John’s temperature.” Sherlock is holding a new temporal thermometer in his hands.
Sherlock is ranting, staring at yet another blubbering mess his parents brought home to interest him with yet again. The plump, dark haired female Omega with brown eyes didn’t even have to open her mouth for him to know she wasn’t suitable. They’ve all smelled so wrong to him, horrid. “Mummy, none of these vapid Omegas you keep parading in front of me has even a smidgeon of a brain!”
"Alright. First of all, you all need to stay calm. Lidiya was killed outside, and we should be fine inside as long as we make sure all entrances are locked." John said and everyone started checking all the windows, verandas, and doors.
The house was not far. It was small but with an elegant air of domesticity. Most of the crime scene personnel had cleared off by the time they arrived, which was better. Sherlock could think properly, uninterrupted.
But what if…
"Why did she cancel my mitral valve?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"We're lost." Sherlock finally snapped. They'd been walking around in the woods for an hour now after leaving the car at the edge of the forest. There weren't any paved roads for cars to go through the woods, and so they had to hike the rest of the way to their destination.
Luckily, John seemed to understand. He moved closer, and just like that, their lips were pressed together. Sherlock wondered how his legs still managed to hold his weight as he melted into the kiss. He had kissed people before, but always for a purpose, for a case. He was never kissed like this before. He felt cherished as John's fingers played with his hair and his other hand cupped his jaw tenderly.
<< Wait, you have say this to the people that asked you to caress the puppy? >>.
<< Since when do you listen to what I tell you? >>.
John enters 221B Baker Street and climbs the stairs, by dragging the heavy trolley, one step after the other with both hands.
November 18th
<< My brother died in that desert shit >> Hataway adds, twisting his nose. << Missing. So they said. If he had been at your command, perhaps now he would be alive or, at least, we would have a body to cry on >> he says, looking away. << Umbridge, Southlow, form a team of five volunteers each and beat the area around here. We are looking for the corps of a man between thirty and forty years of age. MacAllister, you put another one together and go around all the districts, let's see if someone rescued a man and took him home. The roads to the hospital are impractical when it snows like this. Once upon a time, those who were sick went to Dr. Liland Abbott. Does Mary still go down to Jo's shop for shopping, Mac? >>.
<< I'm sick, Mary >> Sherlock mutters with a whisper. He perceives the hesitation of the woman beyond the door. The lock turn and the door open slowly. The light hurts Sherlock's eyes though it is faint.
The inspector was categorical and John had to acknowledge that the snow actually got thicker and the wind stronger in a short time. Being out there would have been suicide. Despite this, John cannot find peace.
<< A little too general as an indication >> points out Greg.
John doesn't escape him the grimace of contempt in her face that quickly turns into a fake sadness.
<< There will be all the time later. I want to wait for Lestrade and talk to this 'master' first >>.
<< You said you were married to your job. Anyway, it's not my business >> he says, stopping Sherlock attempt to reply. << Do you think you can ... forget what happened in the last minutes? >>.
<< Why did you come here, Lizzy? >> Greg asks her.
<< I think it's better you go to sleep, John. You must be very tired if you get out of it with similar idiocies >> he says, placing his other hand on John's. Sherlock smiles sweetly at him, making his gaze even more attractive. John would like to drag him and kiss him, just like punk did in that alley, and he is sure that the pain he feels in his abdomen would vanish instantly.
<< No, Morgan, don't eat it! >> William shouts, but the dog has no intention of accepting the unsolicited gift.
<< Sherlock is there, Mycroft, I hear him >> John says now to his unusual roommate. Mycroft, standing behind him, observes the pattern, as attentive as he is.
A painful stab pierces John's stomach who barely holds back a moan. He brings his hand to his aching belly and Sherlock turns to him with a strange expression of frowning concern. John try to reassure him, by sketching a smile, which however has no effect.
<< I will stay here and I'll do everything I can to help you find Sherlock. If afterwards, however, the balance that he has maintained also thanks to your arrival should completely break, then I will no longer help you, John. I'm sorry to be so severe, but you have no idea the extent of the damage you may have caused. Now I am also seriously worried about his safety, not necessarily put at risk by this storm >>.
<< From a woman during an occasional relationship >> answers Greg.Sherlock glares at him and strokes away.
William runs to his room, closes the door and hides with Morgan in the closet. The girl's words barely reach him from downstairs.
<< It's too warm here, John >>.
One of Sherlock's usual texts, one might say. John, however, remains stunned about those last three words. These words have the power to ease the tensions that claw John's viscera. John quickly takes off his coat and runs away. Sara just gives him a nod, now resigned to seeing him run away in mid-shift, and John certainly isn't wasting time with useless explanations. He runs towards the tube and, thanks to a series of coincidences, he arrives in record time at home.
<< Yes, he approached her. Peter is very good with words. He hasn't convinced her yet, though, but I'm confident. I still give him some time >>.
<< She is not there, Sherlock >> Mycroft replies, moving the tuft away from his forehead. << You are safe now >>.
<< There is a door on the back. We found tire marks. The maid confirmed that Ford's car is missing from the garage. They went away with it >> Greg anticipates. << The car was found just four miles from here, in an isolated area and out of CCTV surveillance. They must have got into another car and God only knows where they ended up >>.
<< Don't lie to me! I had understood for some time that something was wrong >>.
<< I don't bet with you, you know >> he chuckles and Sherlock follows him. Here they are, as always laughing in the less suitable places and times. They try to restore a demeanor, touched by the grim look of Greg, who would like to be everywhere except there.
<< Kelly is fine. She will only have a bad headache for a long time. She is also going to the hospital and I think it's better you go too >> continues John, stroking his hair.
<< I know >>.
<< Do you think that Mr and Ms Ford are dead, Mr. Holmes? >> asks Kelly. << William only has grandparents and they are not even the best grandparents on the planet, if I am allowed to say so. My heart breaks at the idea of his future >>.
Never trust a journalist
John remained silent to listen to his colleague explain in detail his theory on what happened to the troubled mind of Sherlock. John and Mycroft just exchanged two looks and there was no need to even explain to the doctor how deep the hole he made in the water was.
<< Are you going to liquidate it like this? >> John asks, incredulously.
<< An unusual weapon in a kidnapping >> notes Greg.
"Oh," exclaims Moriarty, in amazement. "Did you really say that?" he asks, bringing both hands to the face, theatrically. “Sherlock, but it's not done! It is not done! There is nothing more naive than declaring your love on the wave of orgasm" he says, crossing his arms over his chest.
<< It is the only thing that explains to me why this did not offer resistance >>.
<< This is a must see >>.
The name of the pirate William Kidd's ship
November 15th
<< In the novel of the thug, the cottage becomes a furnished apartment, but the description of where it is located is more precise >> Greg joins him. << In the kidnapping, however, Sharon speaks about an underground cellar where the hostages can hear 'the voices of seagulls and the shouting of the people' >>.
Mycroft takes a long sip while remaining silent, his gaze on the flames dancing happily.
<< Yet it is a partial truth that I witnessed a moment ago >>.
<< Do you really believe that the aim of a kidnapping can  be a teacher rather than a businessman, Mr Holmes? >> the chief asks, skeptically.
<< I don't know where is your mom >> Sherlock says to William. << I know that I will do everything to find out what happened to her and also to find her. I want you to know that I'm not foolproof. I will give my best, as always, but I may also fail. Do you think you can stand it? >>.
<< I let you reach your room >> says the chief of the hotel, making their way out of the locker room.
<< Mr Ford riped off the sheet of paper from Ms Ford's hand, rolled it up and threw it into the fire. Ms Ford screamed and tried to take it >> the woman freezes, her lips tight to draw a white line.
<< You said that you would keep the secret! >> Lizzy yells, pointing at her brother, who leaps towards like a spring.
<< It was enough for me to read the titles of the chronology and the source. I don't look at that stuff! >>.
<< I guess you want to control it >> Hataway tells irritably, to John and Greg.
<< The investigation is not over. Will you leave with me? >> Sherlock asks him, just separating from his lips.
<< I can't stand small spaces >> Mary whispers, gently shaking his hand. << Dad closed me in the storage room every time I did something wrong. He pulled me by the arm and closed me there and if I cried, frightened by the darkness and the spiders, he would beat the door, saying that he would have killed me if I hadn't stopped immediately >>.
<< You are really very devoted >> she says. Mary put a bucket of water on the floor and a basin on the chair. However, it is not bath time. Sherlock quickly moves his eyes in every direction to deduce as quickly as possible what to expect and how to organize a possible defense.
<< With that imperious voice you scares him, John >>.
John is amazed at all this organization. Sherlock hates shopping, yet for the unnamed puppy he kicked his laziness.
<< You took another dog. I expected that. You and your parents consider other living being simple objects at your service. I have something for you, little one! >> Sharon says, throwing a piece of sausage that throws to the puppy's feet.
<< I do not know how much longer I can keep her calm, Ed. You messed up this time >> Mary says, turning sadly towards him.
Sherlock turns his gaze in front of him and sees a estate far beyond the wood in which it is found.
<< Jesus, apt quote, my friend >>.
November 29th
The door opens and Sherlock jumps in fear, staggers and falls to the ground.
Sherlock, however, has no desire to follow John's advice. Especially because the last sad and distressing dreams have had the doctor as the protagonist. Him and what happened that Saturday night. Sherlock could not tell Mary about these dreams. He is still lucid enough to remember the violence with which he threatened his homosexuality. He therefor made John's name feminine, making him an ex who, needless to say, Mary hates with all of herself.
<< There is no news? >>.
<< Well, he can do very well without us >> says Sherlock, sitting down in his chair. Morgan crouches on Sherlock's feet and
"I'd rather die here, instead to see her another time!" Sherlock thinks, wondering how it could be possible that in just two days spent with her, since him awakening, he already feels this way.
<< Ok, ok, I understand that at the moment the landlord is him, but I have a kidnapping investigation in progress and I already have an arrogant child to bear. Two are definitely too much! Sherlock, the chief commissioner are coming. I give you ten minutes, not one more. I want to know all you think is going on. It's an order! >>.
"Lord, it's not possible!" he thinks, shaking his head. He chasis away the possibility that Sherlock is really flirting a step away from him with a beggar for coins in exchange for out of tune songs. A part of John would like to remind Sherlock that he is married to his job, but he realizes that they don't have that kind of confidence. Six months of living together and they never found themselves joking in a comradely way on women or ... yes, or on men, too. John does not know why it did not happen. He is not the type of man who withdraws from similar dressing room arguments. With Sherlock, however, there is a wall around all this. To protect what, then, is another untouchable topic.
John shakes his head, giving up. He sees that Sherlock and William's smiles are similar and a strange squeeze in the heart fills him with emotion.
<< Just because Peter arrived on time >> she confesses, by squinting her eyes. Greg is short of breath at the thought of that escaping danger. He turns his gaze to Sherlock in a silent thanksgiving that the consultant welcomes by barely tilting his head. << All those messages ... all that badness ... those rigged photos that put around saying it was me ... I was about to collapse >>.
Sherlock's eyes struggle to open and John lowers the light to prevent it from bothering him.
<< You have the voice of someone who has just come out of the right side of a really interesting person's bed >> she says mischievously.
<< But they still at work now. Till midnight. I didn't know the Spa was open late >>.
John underlines what the little man just said  with the hand in which he holds the check.
<< What? >> John asks, incredulously.
<< You told me to wait for you and I waited for you >>.
Sherlock feels himself exhausted. He has never eaten so much and he is afraid of vomiting everything.
<< John, are you all right? >>.
<< The emotions. Human relationships. The involvement >>.
<< That place is dark and scary, I do not want to close you back there >> sobbing her, squeezing him even more to the chest.
<< John ... >> Sherlock says, meeting the sad look of his doctor. << Mycroft told me that I will have to undergo an operation on my leg to avoid being lame. It will not be beautiful at all and I will have to do a long rehabilitation. I do not want at all that Mycroft is by my side. He would only emphasize how little goodwill I would take. You are a doctor and then ... well, even if it was psychosomatic, you were lame. I think I will need your help, if you like >>.
<< Like Captain Kidd
<< Oh my God, no. This no. >> mumbles. It is not only the excruciating pain in the leg that worries him. He feels his stomach tight, as if Mary's hand had sunk into his hollowed belly, had pierced his skin to tighten his viscera in his fist.
<< What is a Mind Palace? >>.
It covers the left cheek.
<< That's what I tried to do >> screams desperately. << I really thought they could help me and for a while it was really like that >>.
John should stop. Yes, he really should, because Sherlock is too beautiful, his eyes too languid and his smile too sweet. Instead he pounces again on those red lips of the kisses and bites he gave him. Sherlock's fingers draw complex lines on John's back, each capable of giving him the chills. John feels Sherlock's fingers  getting heavier, bigger. He moves on his neck and Sherlock's laughter are like that of a little girl.
"A maild consolation" John sighs, bringing his hands to his face.
George appears more serene and visibly relieved. A beautiful smile is born on his lips and looking at him John realizes that it has really been a long time since he has seen Greg smile the same way. The detective is not the type of man that bestow many smiles on, but on carefree evenings in the pub John occasionally saw him relax to the point of smiling and laughing out loud. The world is collapsing on their friend. It collapses because of the job he loves and that is not accepted by those who thought he loved him.
<< Ford's many partners are in fibrillation for his fate, given the large number of companies he holds. I think it's normal not to have thought about someone else >>.
Sherlock's benefactress nods. With rapid movements, the woman goes to the bed, bending over him. Sherlock closes his eyes, convinced that she wants to hit him with those big hands. Instead, she uses them to operate a lever located on the side of the bed, to lift the top of the bed and allow him to sitting.
The furnishings in the room are in perfect order. Only a few chairs fallen down and some pendants lie broken on the ground. A series of clearly visible footprints on the wax-polished floor, indicates the unexpected presence of only one individual.
<< Ok, you don't like these names >> John says. They go to the park and the doctor discovers that a dog owner has a lot to worry about. On the one hand, those that can lead to high fines, on the other, those that can get run by the vet. Between a collected poop, a stone made to spit after countless orders and the assault of biggest dogs, John leaves the park upset as if after a reconnaissance tour in Kandahar.
