“I want you inside me. I want you to claim my body with your cock. Make love to me, Mycroft. You think you’re ready to try that?”
, have you?” Mycroft was sitting in front of his laptop at the dining room table, which was covered in neat little piles of paperwork. Greg stood behind him, one hand casually draped on his shoulder.
despise small talk.” His keen, pale grey eyes surveyed his brother, missing nothing. One of Mycroft’s generally pristine collars had a slight crease and his tie pin was crooked. There were dark circles under his eyes, and the faint dusting of white on his slightly-too-tight waistcoat looked suspiciously like powdered sugar. Mycroft gave every indication of being in distress, despite his outwardly calm demeanor. “What’s the
who you are!” She rushed down the stairs towards them, far faster than a lady of her years should have been able to manage. “You’re trying to take
“Who are you? And who is that?” John had passed out as well, and tired as she was, Mary wasn’t about to leave them with a stranger. She did a double take. He looked familiar… “Aren’t you an actor?”
He’d thought it was a great shame that no one but him would see this world changing moment, but he was wrong. In a realm far away, another being looked into a scrying pool and smiled. Even through the seal, he’d been able to keep just the tiniest bit of connection to the Earthly realm. He’d waited patiently, watching for his opportunity. He reached his powers out, using the last of his Earthly magic to make a minute creature do his bidding. Things would go awry in perfect precision.
“I…” Mycroft froze with surprise for a moment, watching Greg try not to laugh in the background. “Thank you Fenris. I’m… proud to have you as a part of our family. It’s good to see you’ve recovered from your injuries.”
what? You here to play the over-protective brother? What next? Ask me what my intentions are? Tell me that you’ll kill me if I break his heart?”
“As do I. He’s downstairs, but there’ll be plenty of time for that later. Since he’s agreed to tutor me as a Seer, I imagine we’ll be seeing quite a bit of him.”
, Mrs. Hudson!” He waved his hand dismissively, banishing her image from his mind. “I was talking to
“What makes you say that?” He looked at her sharply, shock playing across his face for just an instant.
“Yeah, I don’t think your brother would be happy if I brought her.” John grinned, picturing Mycroft’s distress over Rosie crawling around on his antique rugs.
“Yeah. Greg and I were just having a chat about… about me and Sherlock. He told me I should pull my head out of my arse.” He chuckled ruefully and glanced at Greg. “She knows about us, by the way.”
Mycroft snuggled in under Greg’s arm, entirely sated and utterly contented. The three had made love several more times in a variety of wonderfully wicked positions, spurred on by the talents of Fenris’s tongue. He’d never imagined either he or Greg could get hard so many times in one evening, or so quickly. Mycroft suspected the wolf God had some sexual power, probably gained from centuries of devouring sex demons. He knew he’d be exhausted in the morning, but he didn’t care. It had been worth it, and he had no regrets. He smiled softly, knowing Greg had enjoyed it as much as he had. His lover, who had been so patient and gentle with him, had obviously been very aroused when Mycroft had begun to take charge. He drifted off to sleep, resolving to be more commanding during sex with Greg.
“Trust a mortal’s word? I think not.” Oberon smiled slyly and fell silent. He turned away from the tree and Sherlock fell in step beside him. He thought back to the pattern of the questions.
“I got a gift for you too.” He grinned, sliding closer to his lover, pressing his body against Mycroft’s. He felt his hardness, matching his own and his smile widened. “And I see you got one for me too.”
“No. You’re not.” Mycroft smiled, slightly reassured by the thought. “You’ve made a good point there, really.”
“Oddly enough, no. I find myself strangely attached to him since we’ve bonded. I genuinely do consider him part of the family now. I suppose it’s due to the magic involved in bonding with him. The idea that my emotions may have been manipulated magically really should disturb me a great deal more than it does. Perhaps it’s because it’s mutual.”
“If Tom agrees, yeah.” He shrugged in unhappy resignation, looking at the man sitting across from him. Tom had made it clear that if Sherlock Holmes was involved, cooperation was his safest choice.
“Well then, shall we?” The same eyes which had flashed red in the study and filled him with fear now looked at John with a surprising gentleness. “I’m assuming neither of you has ever had a three-way?”
“Yes, and I’m sure we’ll all get some lovely injuries along the way for you to mend, but right now…”, he paused dramatically, leaning close to fix those hypnotic eyes on John. “the
“And I enjoy submitting to you when you take charge. I’m glad that we’re both flexible in that way.” Mycroft smiled slyly at Greg. “But since you like me giving orders, go downstairs and get some water. I’m sure we’re all very dehydrated.”
“I can only presume you’ve never been to L.A., Dr. Watson.” Challenger chuckled. “But it seems they only appear at certain times. I got the distinct impression that under some circumstances, he has difficulty suppressing them. And before you ask, I’m positive they were real. I had the opportunity to examine them in rather intimate detail. They’re extraordinarily beautiful; exactly what one would expect from a former archangel.”
“I can’t have you distracted, John. Not now. I can’t have either of us distracted right now.” Sherlock sprang up, grabbed his coat, and headed out the door. “There’s something that I need to do. I’ll be right back. If anything explodes in the kitchen, just ignore it unless there’s a fire.” He stuck his head back in the door. “And stay out of the kitchen. Because, explosions.”
“True. Doesn’t it… worry you? Aside from her being a potentially psychopathic miniature Goddess, I mean.”
“Yeah, about that…” Greg sighed quietly. He’d wanted to wait and tell his father in person, but now not telling felt too much like keeping it secret. “It’s not a phase with Tim, and it wasn’t with me either.”
possible explanations, the only logical deduction is that I’m delusional. Probably paranoid schizophrenic.”
Sherlock had easily charmed his way past the mother and was now being led into the somewhat unkempt and overgrown garden by young Emily. It was dominated by a large ancient oak of a type rarely found in the city. Out-of-season mushrooms stood arranged in a circle in the tall grass, and a profusion of early blooming roses perfumed the air.
“You’re tired.” Greg hung up the waistcoat in its proper place, making sure to space the hanger evenly between its neighbors. Most people might have been annoyed by his fastidiousness, but Greg took each little ritual as a challenge. Mycroft’s clothing was his armor and stripping it from him was part of getting past the walls his lover put up against the world.
“That sounds a bit like a challenge.” He leaned over, grinning at John. “What about you, John? Do you desire me?”
“I intend to be answerable for our actions and to give aid when necessary, but I won’t have those who don’t understand the situation dictate what must be done. I won’t stand for atrocities committed against British citizens in the name of scientific research or military use. Can you imagine what sort of projects someone like Jason or Edwin might propose if they got their hands on a werewolf, for example?”
“Thank you again for keeping her for me. I promise I’m working on getting a nanny as soon as possible.”
“If there’s a matching suit in that bag, I’m probably going to set it on fire.” John grinned at him. “You know, I never really wondered, but how much do you spend on clothes? What does a suit like this cost, anyway?”
“Sorry, wrong list.” Sherlock snatched it back, presenting a bank card and another list. It was no less long or odd, but there were, at least, notations as to where he should go.
dating Mycroft, so we’ve got some stuff in common there. Speakin’ of which, we should probably get back to business.”
“I’d heard the world had gotten a lot more progressive about that sort of thing.” He stepped over to Sherlock, looking at him speculatively. “Not bad looking, really.”
“If we’re able to identify the victim, it’s possible, but do you really want to take the chance of it killing again? We have, at most, a week before it must take another victim, and it’s not impossible that it might decide to upgrade to a more advantageous identity before it’s forced to. It’s probably already killed whoever summoned it.” A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. “We both know that this murder is going to have to be unsolved, officially. Think of poor Greg, having yet another unsolved pair of grisly murders on his record. Do you
“I’m a devil of my word, Sherlock. Here, take this.” Lucifer walked to a tall bookcase to the right of the bar and reached up, pulling down a small book. It was bound in red leather and locked. He slipped a key into the lock and handed it to Sherlock. “Can you read it?”
“Don’t.” Sherlock grinned again and snuggled a little closer to John. “And give yourself a good tip.
“Exactly. If she harbors any ill intentions, then child or not, they’ll immediately become hostile towards her.”
“In you?” Tim glanced up, blushing a bright red. “Oh. I guess Uncle Mycroft told you what Fenris said.”
“Because I don’t think you’d hurt me or Abby. Aunt Martha brags about her boys all the time. She loves you guys like a mother, so you must be good people.”
“Don’t you dare even contemplate it.” He glared at his younger brother. “I swear I’ll use every means at my disposal to have you dragged there forcibly, if need be.”
“Why did Mummy try to hurt me?” The ghost of a small girl reached up, taking Greg’s hand and looking at him with large brown eyes. Drops of water streamed from her clothes and hair, disappearing as they hit the pavement.
“Yes, it is new. And it didn’t go well. As much as I hate to admit it, Mycroft’s right. Sherlock thinks he’s gone mad.”
“Yes, that I’m not to touch anyone unless I’m wearing it.” She smiled. “Do you like the new dress that Mr… Morpheus gave me?” She said the name very carefully, as if she’d practiced getting it right. “He’s a bit funny looking but he’s very nice. He said Bran can bring me back to visit anytime. There’s loads of fun things there to do there. I even got to pet a unicorn.”
“Oh shit, I…” Liam gritted his teeth and closed his eyes, trying to keep the change at bay. Each stroke drew it nearer, and part of him wanted to stop, not wanting to subject his friend to what was about to happen, but the need to keep going was too strong to resist. It had been months since he’d had sex, and the vampire’s bite had his cock aching for more. “I’m sorry… can’t stop… gonna change…”
“They’re far from dull, if you take the time to get to know them. Honestly, if I didn’t have interesting things already in the works in L.A., I’d probably stay here. They really are quite fascinating. You can’t tell me you haven’t found at least
“Yes, and you’ll be able to do all sorts of things if you’re careful. There’s a special place where you can practice doing magic without having to worry about accidents. Will you come with me?”
“Yeah, I gotta be honest. I wouldn’t even tell my Dad if it weren’t for my brother, who’s a right bastard, by the way.”
Greg’s hands dug into the sheets as his lover slammed into him, rough and full of passion, just like he liked it. His limbs trembled as he began to orgasm, cock leaking onto the sheets. His low growl of pleasure was echoed by Fenris.
“So where do you think she is?” John breathed in the cool evening air, wondering if he was going to take his last breath that night and consoling himself that at least Rosie was safe.
“Like who?” He smiled softly at the wince John made at the question. “I’m not trying to start a row, John. I’m genuinely curious. Other than Lucifer, who among tonight’s dinner companions do you find attractive?”
whispered it to me. Then I had a conversation with Mary. I’m seeing ghosts and ghosts don’t exist, so having eliminated all other possible answers…
“Then we’ve agreed to be exclusive. I think, also, that I should say that if I’m ever unavailable or too tired, I don’t have any objections to the two of you having sex without me.” The idea of Greg having sex with any other person would have driven him into a fit of despair and rage, but he found the idea of his beloved having Fenris to turn to in those situations was strangely comforting.
are working on. She’s agreed to put her no doubt busy social life on hold for the good of the nation. But only until next week, so I hope you’re picked a nanny.”
He leaned in, pressing his lips to John’s. John struggled, trying to push him away, but Sherlock’s long fingers were digging into his arms, holding him with all his strength. He tried to speak but Sherlock’s tongue was suddenly in his mouth. He froze, confused and panicked. Then his eyes met Sherlock’s and his panic melted in the heat of desire. As he returned his kiss, Sherlock released his grip and John’s arms went around him, pulling him closer.
“Why? Why do you care about these mortals and their dull little lives?” While Loki didn’t especially dislike humans, their incredibly brief life-spans made it a bit hard for him to take them seriously and he saw little point in getting attached to them.
“Well then, we’d best be off, John. I’m sure you’re eager to see how things went with the new nanny.”
“Yes. What will you do with Theodore’s Tree?” Oberon began to walk through the forest. Sherlock followed, watching in fascination as the woodland around them seemed to subtly transform. The trees became smaller and more varied, surrounded by bushes and ferns.
The phone clattered to the ground as he was shrouded in sudden mist. It seeped into him, feeding on his mind before moving on. His living but mindless body fell with a thud as the creature moved on, its scattered and fragmented thoughts only slightly more ordered by the mind it had absorbed. It wasn’t nearly enough, and it still hungered.
Mycroft moaned with pleasure. In many ways, this was his favorite part of making love; that exquisite first moment when he could feel his lover’s cock filling his body. Greg began to move and he moaned again as the thick head slid across his prostate. His legs wrapped tighter around his waist, his thick cock prodding against his lover’s body as he fucked him. The low, guttural grunts Greg made as he pumped into him were incredibly erotic to Mycroft, and his whole body shivered in orgasmic delight.
“Supplies for this evening’s hell-hound summoning.” He grinned, noting the butterfly sleeping on John’s head. “I see you and Steven are getting along well.”
“How do you know what you sense with your mind is real? How do you know you’re not just imagining it?”
.” Sherlock grabbed his hand and hopped up, hauling to him to his feet. Still slightly wobbly, he let him lead him to the bed.
“I don’t know. He instructed me to go back to my hotel and warned me to put out the Do Not Disturb sign. I have a vague recollection of disturbing dreams that night, but I can’t recall the specifics of it beyond the sense of experiencing what I can only describe as sleep paralysis. When I awoke, it was three nights later, and I was as I am now; a vampire.”
“Well, yeah, there’s that, but I’m the only man you’ve ever been with. I think the experience might give you a little more confidence in just how damn sexy you really are.” He bent his head, kissing Mycroft’s bare shoulder.
“Are you sure you’re cut out for it?” Sherlock flicked his cigarette into the fireplace and frowned. “It’s quite difficult, this caring lot. It’s a very slippery slope.”
A moderate existential crisis and a good deal of anxiety occupied him for the rest of the ride home.
.” Sherlock glanced back at the duplicate of Emily’s tree. “The hive reflects us; how we interact with them and the environment we create around them.”
“What kind of proof?” His brow furrowed as he stared at Lestrade. It sounded preposterous, but the inspector looked entirely serious. “Show me, then, if you’ve got proof.”
“Now kneel behind me and stretch me out with your fingers. When you can get three inside, you can mount me too. You will do most of the moving, Greg.” Fenris moaned with a low sensual growl as he felt Greg’s fingers stretching him. It would be very good to feel both of his packmates inside him, taking their pleasure together.
“No, but a wooden bullet might suffice. I’ll talk to Mycroft about having some made. Speaking of which, if Molly’s going to be there tonight, you might want to see if Mrs. Hudson is available to babysit.”
“Uh-oh.” When Rosie picked up some random new word, phase one was to repeat it a lot, at very high volumes.
“Still, better safe than sorry.” Mycroft sighed heavily. “You call them. Mummy’s much more likely to listen to you. Have them go visit some friends for a few days. I doubt Eurus will bother tracking them down if they’re not at home.”
“There is little left in our modern age to challenge an adventuresome man like him, John. It may have been the desperation of boredom that led him to take such a chance. Having a man like Professor Challenger as one’s role model would be frustrating in a world with no new frontiers to explore.”
sure, that you want that. There’s a level of commitment there that goes far beyond just having your…
“For his breed, he must bite but not kill them when he is in werewolf form. Even then it is only a certain thing if the moon is full. If he bites them as a wolf or a human it won’t work. It can be passed on through mating with someone when he is in that form as well.”
“Damn.” Mycroft muttered softly, momentarily at a loss for words. “Tim, I… It’s very complicated. Fenris isn’t… human.”
…” Lucifer rose as the last notes on the piano rang out. There was an instant of silence as he walked away, and then the dance music began again, an energetic techno remake of

“Yes. Mycroft thinks hygiene is very important. I don’t think I like the tooth brush but I will use it too, so you will kiss me. I like kissing. It’s like jaw-fighting for humans. All of you have short hair. Is that how warriors wear their hair now?”
“Myrtle Jenson, widow, age 78. Died sometime last week of a stroke. Body wasn’t found until a couple of days later when a neighbor noticed she hadn’t been gettin’ her mail. There’s three others on th’ list, so why
“Very.” A small smile curled the corner of his lips, and a very genuine joy showed in his eyes. “I don’t think I’ve ever really been happy until now.”
“I can’t feel my toes, John.” Sherlock grinned, rolling over to face him. “Is that normal?” All his fears had vanished in the moment, and all he felt was a giddy, unfamiliar sense of happiness that was far better than any high he’d ever got from drugs.
“There’s nothing he can do, Alicia. A couple of the more conservative members of our little group might think less of me now, but quite frankly, I don’t care. I’ve got nothing to hide, and Greg’s record is spotless.” Mycroft looked and sounded sincere, but he had, of course, a very great deal to hide.
“Greg and Mycroft?” A small sneer of distaste crossed her face. “I mean, I know Greg’s bi, but what does he see in Mycroft?”
“Oh God, John… my love…” As John withdrew his fingers, reaching down to line his cock up with his lover’s entrance, Sherlock wrapped his legs across his shoulders. He let out a long, contented sigh as John’s cock pushed inside him.
“He says it was after our minds. Somehow it feeds on intelligence.” He repressed a shudder, horrified by the idea.

“I can’t let her go around doing that. She’s shortened the life of everyone in London by five minutes. Do you have any idea how much time it’s going to take to straighten all that out? It’s going to cause no end of trouble.”
“Then I take it he’s far more powerful than Fenris. If the banishing spell didn’t work on him, it certainly won’t work on Morpheus. The circle won’t contain him, will it?”
make me alright.” He smiled, running his hand lovingly across Greg’s cheek. “Guide me, Greg. I am in your hands.”
Sherlock felt the increasingly familiar sense of magic pushing against his mind. He pushed back, gritting his teeth and stilling his tongue.
not judging. He’s real… imaginative.” Greg took a guess on quality based on the label and handed him a bottle of wine along with the water.
“Oh, here now. Remember that werewolf the tabloids were talking about? I was right, there was a lot more to it…”
“John, you’re perfectly safe. I want to say that right off. Killing humans isn’t within the power of Oberon’s Position.”
“What sort of treatment do you recommend, Doctor?” An injection, perhaps?” Sherlock’s tone was entirely serious, but humor showed in the crinkling of his eyes.
“Perhaps we’ll find that answer in his blood sample. Other than a slight sensitivity to sunlight, which the glasses indicate, he’s not yet shared any real vulnerabilities that would be useful in a fight… except perhaps wood.”
“We’re a couple. Yeah, he’s got a lot more money than me, but that’s what couples do; they share expenses. And it’s a great opportunity for Tim. He’s a bright kid, and if he does well there, he’ll have a good start on his future.”
Sherlock wasn’t back when he got there. Feeling something between relieved and disappointed, he dropped off the packages and picked up Rosie. He was looking forward to a quiet afternoon at home. If he was really lucky, he might even get a chance to nap.
“We should prepare ourselves for the worst”, Mycroft intoned gravely to the group, turning to Thomas. “Has our equipment been delivered?”
“Greg…” Mycroft’s fingers clutched at his lover’s short silver hair as he felt the wet heat of Greg’s mouth engulfing his cock. His lover growled, a low soft rumble that sent shivers through his whole body. Slick fingers glided across the smooth skin behind his balls, teasing their way between his cheeks and caressing his hole. He sighed softly as one slid inside him, massaging his prostate with gentle spirals as Greg slipped another finger in.
“Yeah, Sherlock told me. John, as adorable as you are when you blush like that, all this embarrassment isn’t necessary. I’m
“Yes. I like sex in all its varied forms, as long as all parties involved are consenting adults and no permanent damage is done. I’m sure I’ve done a lot of things you’d consider unimaginable. This really isn’t that extreme, compared to some of the things I’ve gotten up to.”
“Yeah, that’s the right word.” Greg’s cock twitched a bit, and he chuckled softly, looking over at his lover. “Mycroft, that okay with you?”
“I don’t know. We’re investigating that, but there’s not much evidence to go on. What about when magic makes its way here? Does that concern you?”
sexy. Besides, you’re a lot hotter than you seem to realize. I’ve had a thing for you for long time.” He reached over and gave Mycroft’s hand what he intended to be a reassuring squeeze. Mycroft snatched it away, then sort of flopped it around uncertainly for a bit before carefully putting it back on the bar.
at me.” He chuckled, reaching up to pull Sherlock’s head down for a kiss. Playfulness soon led to passion as they made their way to the bedroom.
“What? How dare you?” Lucifer set his glass down and stepped very close to John, his temper showing in the red flash of his eyes. His anger was a palatable force, as if the very air pressure had changed. “I’ve existed since the very beginning of time and not once have I ever forced myself on someone.”
“A word first, if you please, Sherlock.” He froze, slowly lowering his hand and turning around. He knew that voice. It was his own.
“I know.” He took a sip of his juice, thinking about the word love and how its meaning had changed for him. “I
just a moment. Mycroft had been vulnerable and he might feel differently now. Greg decided the best course of action was to just bring it up. They had a crisis to face, and they didn’t need sexual tension getting in the way. Getting it out in the open and out of the way would be best. Mycroft would probably turn him down, shredding him emotionally in the process. He’d watched Sherlock do it so many times to Molly that it seemed a natural response to expect from his brother, and Greg tried to prepare himself for what he assumed would be inevitable. He wasn’t the type of man to press his attentions when they weren’t wanted, so once he knew Mycroft wasn’t interested, he’d be able to put it out of his mind. Then he’d suggest they never bring it up again, give him the files, and they’d be able to get on with work.
John laughed and slid down Sherlock’s body, teasing his cock with his lips and tongue until he begged John to suck him. He happily complied, wrapping his hand around the base and taking it into his mouth as far as he could, pushing the limits of what he could take in with each downward movement of his head. By the time Sherlock was approaching orgasm, his own cock was throbbing. Sherlock cried out his name, filling his lover’s mouth with cum and John swallowed the hot fluid eagerly, relishing the bitter-savory taste on his tongue.
“Lock the door. I don’t want anyone walking in on us.” John slipped off his clothes as Sherlock undressed and slipped into bed beside him. “Do we have any lube?”

“You are a werewolf and you acted as a young one does when the blood-lust comes over him. Your instincts overwhelmed your mind. This is a thing you can learn to control, if you can accept what you are.”
“If you mean porn, then you’re right. Look, I gotta get to work, but I promise you, when I get the time, me and you will sit down and have a nice, open, honest discussion about sex, okay?”
“What will you do with her, Loki?” Sherlock’s face was grim as he stared at the form of his sister. Asleep, she looked small and vulnerable.
John could feel his heart pounding in rhythm with the pulsing of his cock. He whimpered in need and confusion as Sherlock pushed inside him, slowiy sinking himself into John’s body. Another flash of pain and panic went through him, quickly fading as Sherlock’s hand stroked his cock. After giving John’s muscles time to adjust to him, Sherlock began to move, gently making love to him as he sought the perfect angle for John’s pleasure. His lover moaned his name, and he knew he’d found it. Being inside someone was a pleasure Sherlock had never known, and he struggled against his own body’s urges, forcing himself to seek John’s pleasure first. As John’s body began to tremble, he picked up the pace of his movements, biting his lip to keep from cumming.
“You shouldn’t be able to reach beyond the circle.” He glanced over in warning as Greg stepped closer, hand on his gun.
“What about when I’m inside you? Do you like that bit?” Despite his earlier tiredness and the mind-shattering orgasm he’s just had, he felt a familiar tingle as his body responded to Sherlock’s. “Do you like feeling my cock inside you, Sherlock?”
wacking it, let alone a partner. And we don’t know if or how it’s passed on. If it’s like the movies, it’s fine if I don’t bite anyone, and I don’t
“I absolutely refuse to put out until you feed me.” He bit back a smile, crossing his arms and trying to look stern.
Now he’d finally cracked, and she wondered what to do. She knew she should report him, but she didn’t want to see his career end like that. Sally didn’t know who to turn to. She knew he wasn’t close to his family, and she didn’t know any of his friends, unless she counted Sherlock. Despite all the help he’d given them and his vindication in the Moriarty case, she still didn’t trust him, and she trusted his brother even less. She sighed softly and went back to the crime scene.
“Of course, he knows. That’s why I just put it out on the table with Mycroft. I figured he’s gonna know anyway, so why not? I just got lucky that he decided to let himself be interested in me. Plus, I’m pretty damn irresistible when I wanna be.” He laughed to show he was joking about the last bit.
Greg positioned himself behind Fenris, slowly working the head of his cock inside him. Both Mycroft and Fenris moaned as he sheathed himself inside, his cock rubbing against his lover’s thick shaft. It was deliciously, wonderfully tight, and he was soon fucking enthusiastically into Fenris, encouraged by the sounds both were making.
“It’s decided then. Molly will process the samples, Greg will join you, and I will get on with setting things up. You have your assignments”, said Mycroft.
satisfied? Am I… enough?” Sherlock kept himself from trembling by sheer force of will, trying to suppress his fear that he wasn’t enough; that someday John would want a woman instead.
When John woke, he was alone. He froze, hearing voices in the next room. Quietly as possible and gathering his clothes as he went, he listened at the door, thankful it was closed for once.
“Not me. God, the first time… I was afraid I’d freak out. But he’s… he picks up skills really fast, you know. I guess I set a good example though, because even the first time was great.”
“Overall, no, but it does have its moments. So, was that all? You just popped round to ask my permission to date
“I think that’d be great. Lover, you’ve been really good with Alice. You’re going to be a great father, Mycroft.” He unbuttoned Mycroft’s shirt, untucking his undershirt so he could run his hands across his skin. “You’re a better man than you give yourself credit for.”
“I didn’t really notice last night, but you’re bigger than me”, he said, slightly dismayed by the fact.
“How did your lesson go, Violet?” Mycroft had, of course, already heard Lucifer’s report, but he wanted to know what she would have to say about it.
“He’s beautiful, Sherlock. Thanks for bringing him by.” When Sherlock had asked her to study the hive at Emily’s tree, she’d been nervous despite his assurance that they wouldn’t harm her. Seeing Steven reassured her, and she found herself now looking forward to her assignment. “He’s not at all like the ones Mycroft told us about. Did he get things sorted out with the hive in his backyard?”
a rational, even scientific explanation. Maybe… some kind of quantum reality thing or a… phased alternate dimension or… or something along those sorts of lines.”
“No. In fact, we’re already going to be late for Mycroft’s. Put those candles out while I make sure nothing’s going to explode in the kitchen while we’re gone. Mary, if you’ll come with me, I still have a few questions for you.”
“I may have found it slightly amusing.” He flashed a quick grin, then suddenly focused a penetrating gaze on John. “Do you regret the fact that I wasn’t interested in a similar arrangement with Lucifer?”
“Yeah? That’s kinda like praise, comin’ from him.” He smiled happily, giving Mycroft another kiss on the cheek. “You’re what’s best for me, lover.”
“I won’t. I know how family can be.” He looked at him sympathetically. “It can’t be worse than the toast my bastard brother gave at my wedding.”
“Look, I’ll make a deal with you. Come by tomorrow, and if you still think I need help after I’ve explained, then I’ll take some time off and see a therapist on Monday. Deal?”
“Silence. Nobody move.” Mycroft forced himself to remain calm as he slowly reached into his pocket, drawing out another ruby. Whatever this creature was, he’d try to send it back to Hell.
He refocused his eyes, watching Sherlock’s reflection appear and disappear as light played across the glass. John wondered if he’d ever understand how he could have come to feel as he did about him, or why. When had friendship turned into love? Why had loving him turned into being
“Don’t you? I’d have never though it possible, but he was actually surprisingly sweet with that poor child.”
Sherlock and John became aware of Lucifer’s presence, but rather than being intrusive, he added another layer of sensuality to their lovemaking. John’s fingers explored the soft underside of his wings, drawing a low, purring moan from him. They felt their climax building to its apex.
believes that Mary’s ghost is…  real?” Sherlock sprang up, quickly kneeling to inspect the area around John’s chair. The afghan was wound around him like a Roman toga and despite its garishness, there was an air of dignity about him. “Ah ha! Crumbs!” He snatched one up and popped it in his mouth. The air of dignity disappeared. “Mycroft
“I don’t know, Meli.” He said softly, taking her hand in his. “I’m sure Mycroft will explain. Right now, there’s something more important I’d like to talk to you about.”
“I’m a bit proud of myself, really. It feels good, you know; being so comfortable with who I am. It all seems silly now. I guess you thought I was a real idiot.”
happy in some sweetly misguided attempt to spare her feelings, but the love in his eyes when he looked at Sherlock made his happiness obvious to her. She’d have to have a word with John and let him know they had her total support. Knowing them both as she did, she realized John would need to know he had the support of his friends far more than Sherlock would.
If this was going to continue, it couldn’t be kept secret. There was far too much potential for blackmail for them both if it was kept secret. He wondered how Greg’s co-workers would react. His own colleagues would only be mildly surprised. The press might be a minor annoyance, considering Greg’s position, but only if there was some hint of scandal or secrecy.
“Worried? About Mycroft? Me? Don’t be absurd.” He made a dismissive little wave, but the line on his forehead deepened.
“Yeah, anything as long as it’s not wine. Can’t stand the stuff.”  He took the proffered glass of brandy, sipping it before setting it aside and looking searchingly at Mycroft. “I’d ask what you’ve done to make you think you’re good enough for my son, but I suppose dragon-slaying ought to count for something.”
“I’d much rather you stay here.” Mycroft looked mournfully at his lover, knowing that wasn’t an option. “I couldn’t bear losing you.”
“Sure, just let me grab my coat.” Anderson tried to sound casual, but the prospect of finally getting back to work was exciting. She’d been good about it, but he was tired of depending on Benji’s help. It would be nice to be able to take her out for dinner for a change.
“Shh. It’s alright.” Greg stood up and wrapped his arms around him, stopping his words with a kiss. “I told you. You never have to say it, because I
“Let me guess your first one. I’m not evil, and I don’t tempt people into evil. People make their own Hell from their own sense of guilt. I merely presided over it.”
in my arms and wake up with you still there in the mornin’. How could I be disappointed?” He leaned in, capturing his lips for a lingering kiss. “I love you. Now go get in bed.” His hands slid across the muscles of Mycroft’s lower back, gently kneading the muscles. He grinned, feeling his lover melt under his touch. “You’re getting a massage.”
punished. It’s no fun if they’re not guilty. It’s one of the many reasons I left. There are far too many innocents in Hell, like that ghost child your brother’s taken in. I refuse to cooperate any longer in a system that is far more corrupt and immoral that I could ever be.”
“I’m sure I don’t know what you could be implying. I am, after all, the one who really saved the city. I took the new Goddess down. All you did was defeat one little dragon.” Loki looked as innocent as he possibly could, which was no easy feat for the Trickster God.
“Of course you couldn’t.” Mycroft rose and sat on the arm of Greg’s chair, leaning over to kiss him on the cheek. “You’re a good man, Greg. It may pose some difficulties, having her here, but we’ll work something out. I have a spell that should at least allow me to see her…” His eyes widened in surprise as Greg pulled him into his lap. He stiffened briefly, then melted as Greg wrapped his arms around him and kissed him long and lovingly.
“Nothing much. I can’t move objects or walk through walls, by the way. I tried that, and I did feel… not the wall itself, but a sort of… resistance. Other than that, and the sense of warmth when I touch someone, I don’t feel
Author’s notes: Fenris (also called Fenrir and other names) is the Asgardian wolf of Ragnarok. The son of Loki and a giantess, it was prophesied that he would bring about the fall of the Gods by devouring Odin. He was bound by a magical chain called Gleipnir, forged by dwarves from six impossible things until the time of Ragnarok. While some legends attribute the devouring of the Sun and Moon to other wolf entities, there is discrepancy in the various tales, and I have chosen to combine them. His right eye contains the power of Asgard’s Sun and his left Asgard’s Moon. The taboo against eating horses comes from his deal with Slepnir, his half-brother (from Loki), who was Odin’s magical eight-legged steed
Fenris was almost quivering with delight as he looked at the large shadowed forest surrounding the estate. As fun as running through the city’s streets and parks was, this was much better.
“It’s your decision, John, but in all practicality, there’s probably little we could do to stop him. Fenris vouches that he’s not evil, if that’s any consolation.”
“Kinda. What I’m really attracted to is intelligence. Gender isn’t on the top of on my list of what I’ve always looked for in a person. There’s a lotta reasons why I love Mycroft, but that’s what attracted me to him in the first place. He’s probably the smartest guy you’ll ever meet. How did your dad find out you were gay?”
Mycroft’s smile widened and he pressed into his touch as he noticed his lover’s eyes, darting over to the lube that sat on the bedside table. Last night had washed away all his fears and uncertainties about topping Greg, and he reached for the bottle with an eager grin on his face.
“You’re not supposed to be here.” A dark-haired young woman sat casually beside him at the bar. He could sense the power in her, and he knew instinctively that she was Death personified. He’d never seen anyone more beautiful in his life, and his heart leapt in a type of excitement that he’d seldom felt in his life. It was as close to love as he could ever come. “I’d take you, if I could.”
. He’s my…” He paused, choosing the proper fairy term to imply the importance of their relationship. “…mate.”
This was said with such utter earnestness that John didn’t know rather to kiss him or to laugh. Neither was compatible with being angry, and he surrendered to the inevitable. He rolled over, determined to go back to sleep. “I hope Mycroft knows I don’t come cheap.”
“I have no idea.” Sherlock looked at him doubtfully, and Mycroft frowned. “Truly. When you made your original report, I reviewed the staff records very carefully and there was no one by that name connected with any of the projects.”
“Possibly, but I need more data.” He set his mug down and flung himself into his chair with a long melodramatic sigh. “One of the three…”, he muttered.
“Well, he is the youngest of us, and he’s always had a lotta energy. I can see where he’d be a handful.”
Their lovemaking seemed dreamlike to John. There, literally surrounded by Lucifer’s wings, the rest of the world receded and it seemed like the two of them were in an intimate, erotic world all their own. His body moved in rhythm with Sherlock’s, hearts beating in tandem, breath rates slowly but steadily increasing.
“I want inside you.” Sherlock grabbed the lube, then nibbled gently on John’s neck. “Will you ride me?”
“I just cleaned it.” Mycroft shivered again, remembering the delicious sensation when Greg had slipped a warm, soapy, flannel-clad finger into him.
“Everyone on the team’s fine. Anthea returned just before dawn. Bran says Mary’s likely to be back by tonight. She just needs to recharge her energy. Rosie and the girls are on their way home; they’ll be back this evening. Eurus is still unconscious, and there’s been no sightings of Moriarty as of yet. Here…” He found the video of Thomas’s news conference on John’s mobile. “Watch this, and I’ll be right back. And do get naked, John. I
“Then it’s settled. Are you alright? I do need to be somewhere soon, but I don’t want to leave if you’re still feeling… distressed by this.”
. The fact that he’d spied on him so much over the years had been a big part of why he’d let Greg past the walls he’d built around himself. He knew
“I think at one point, I almost fainted. You made me swoon, John. I never understood how that was possible; swooning.”
forbidden. Just think about the ripples this kind of thing creates in reality. Like, for example, a guy was gonna die in a few minutes when a drunk driver runs off the road, but that can’t happen because a bus just hit him instead. So now he’s dead early, the bus driver’s gonna be traumatized and the drunk driver ends up getting off scott-free. And that’s just one case. Multiply that by a bunch. All that stuff’s gonna have consequences that Destiny, me and a lotta other Powers are gonna have to fix. So everybody’s gonna be all pissed off, ‘cause she just made a whole lot of work for everybody. Plus the Fates have to weave a whole new thread for Alice, and shorten a bunch more, and they’re gonna be bitching about it for years. I’m probably going to take some flak for not taking… what’s her name, the baby Goddess you’ve got there?”
“No. I have to assume your perception of ghosts is more acute than mine. I may be somewhat sensitive to their presence, but you’re the medium here.”
I’d lose control and hurt somebody; not on purpose, anyway, but even if I was with a girl who wouldn’t just run off screaming, my claws are kinda long and sharp… It’s hard not to hurt
“I don’t know. There’s something about you that strikes my sympathy. And you are rather attractive.”
think that being with Sherlock will make me happy? You know how he feels about love; the scratch on the lens of a sensitive instrument…”
, then wondering if I’m gay or not sounds silly. It’s not even what people might say. It’s just… I find things going a little bit further every time, and I find myself doing things that I thought I’d never do… I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore.”
“I can’t even make love without changing.” His cheeks flushed red as he remembered his encounter with Thomas, and he hung his head, unable to even look at Molly.
“Wilson”, she murmured, skimming the written report on the morgue ghosts. She shuddered, wondering how she’d handle going to work tomorrow, knowing these…
“Uh-huh. Be sure, Anderson. Me and Mycroft aren’t the only gay couple you’ll be workin’ with. Sherlock and John are in on this too.”
, on the other hand, might do quite nicely. I’m bored. Spend the night with me and I’ll give you textbooks to read instead of tabloids. You could be the supreme sorcerer of your age, if you have the gift for it. You can even bring your boyfriend if you’d like.” He grinned at John. “The more, the merrier.”
Slowly stripping each other’s clothes off as they kissed, they made their way to the bed, leaving behind a trail of jackets, shirts, shoes and socks. Sherlock’s nimble fingers had made short work of unfastening John’s trousers, and they slid down around his hips. Suddenly self-conscious, John fumbled with the button fastening Sherlock’s slacks.
“Check my left coat pocket.” Sherlock interrupted him, grinning as John grabbed the coat off the end of the bed and pulled out a bottle of lube and a small box of rubbers.
John just wanted to lie down and think, so he left Sherlock and Mary in the living room. They were trying to introduce her to a very reluctant Steven, who was apparently afraid of ghosts. The briefing at Mycroft’s had run very long, and John was a bit overwhelmed. Greg’s report had been interesting, and Mycroft’s descriptions of their up-coming headquarters and equipment had left John feeling a bit like James Bond. Sherlock’s tale of his meeting with Oberon had led to a very long discussion on the nature of fairies, and all the while, John had just stared at Sherlock and the others, wondering how they could all take it so calmly.
“It’s a wonder you two get anything done, what with all th’ shagging you do.” Bill looked up from the laptop, shaking his head.
“Not a word, I swear.” Phillip suppressed a shudder and glanced uneasily at Greg, only slightly reassured by the inspector’s presence. He’d thought he knew Lestrade, but seeing the two of them together, he realized he really didn’t. They’d been entirely professional since he arrived, but there was something in the way they stood beside each other and something in Greg’s eyes when he looked at Mycroft, that made it clear that they were together.
“Me and Mycroft, so far, but we’re looking to recruit a few other people to help. Maybe Molly Hooper, for starters.”
“Elevated.” John couldn’t move. Part of him wanted to push Sherlock away and part of him wanted to shove him down on the floor and… and… He sat frozen; breathless, blushing and staring at Sherlock.
“Already? I don’t really get it; those two, but I’ve never seen Greg so happy, and Mycroft seems more…”
“When he kissed me in the club, he looked into me and I looked back. I suppose it’s due to my Seer powers, but I could sense that underneath that playboy image he projects is a very deep intellect. In some ways, he and I are very alike.”
“I am. Greg, there’s something I want to want to tell you about.” Mycroft’s expression was neutral, but Greg could see the sparkle of excitement in his blue-grey eyes. “I’m a sorcerer.”
“Then be very careful, and as much as possible, keep your mouth shut.” Sherlock sighed when John looked at him, obviously hurt.
“So you’ve been friends a long time.” He looked at his wife, reaching over to pat her hand reassuringly. “How long have you two been seeing each other?”
“I am? I…” His words trailed off as he watched a very naked wolf God crawl up the bed to kneel between them. Fenris leaned forward, putting his hands on Mycroft’s shoulders. Mycroft’s eyes widened in surprise as Fenris licked the corner of his mouth, then placed his lips against his, gently parting them with his tongue. The stiffness of Mycroft’s posture began to give way to a different kind of stiffness as the tip of Fenris’s tongue trailed sensuously against the roof of his mouth. There was hunger in Fenris’s kiss, combined with a gentleness made evident by the delicate way he tilted his head, keeping Mycroft’s tongue clear of his sharp canines.
“Kicked you out? Why?” Greg kept his expression calm, but inside he was furious. His brother Tony had done a lot of things to anger him over the years, but this was by far the worst.
‘Are you sure you’re alright? You were saying something about fairies, but then your mind seemed… elsewhere.”
“I’m not looking forward to that.” John frowned. “Are you still dead set on it, this chat with the Devil?”
“Mycroft…”, Greg growled through gritted teeth, staving off his own orgasm through sheer force of will. “Cum
“That is a low blow, little brother”, he snarled, entirely irritated at the smug look on Sherlock’s face.
“He’ll need to summon and control a hell-hound. Apparently they were originally created to track down rogue demons, so as long as Mycroft can control it, it should be able to find our demon.”
“Yeah, I’d like that.” Greg reached down, grasping Mycroft’s hand and pulling him to his feet. “I was hoping you’d ask.”
“Well then, I guess I’d better do something about that.” John pulled his fingers out, loving the little whimper of need Sherlock made. He crawled up his body, spreading a bit of oil on his cock as his lover wrapped his long, trembling legs around him. He reached down, teasing the head of his cock against Sherlock’s opening. He felt Sherlock’s hips lunging upwards, seeking to drive him inside.
The house was exactly as he expected. It was a gated, grandly traditional manor, tucked away in a discretely convenient location. There was a manned security gate, and he was suddenly reminded that Mycroft Holmes was a man who could make people disappear. The guard at the front door wore a perfectly polished dark suit and, no doubt, a perfectly polished gun to match it, but he also had what appeared to be some sort of voodoo talisman consisting of nails and what Greg hoped was a dried chicken’s foot tied around his left thigh. Fuck it, he decided. If the whole bloody world was going mad, he’d take a shot and see what happened. Finding out the hard way was what he did anyway.
“That’s because you’re comparing yourself to Sherlock. It’s not a competition. It took courage to admit how you really feel about him, and courage to accept how he feels about you. You should be proud of that.”
“Sherlock, what are you thinking? Whatever she was, whatever she might become, she’s just a child now.”
Shaking Sherlock’s hand and bidding John farewell, he donned his sunglasses and left. John started to speak, but Sherlock shushed him until they heard the front door close behind him.
Sherlock had dressed quickly and was already on one of the laptops when John stepped into the living room. He could hear Bill in the kitchen, quietly muttering something about not stealing something. John shook his head, thinking how odd it was to find himself hoping there was a ghost in the kitchen.
“Aversion therapy.” A theory crossed his mind and he glanced at John, suddenly worried. “Do you find it ugly?”
, she was glad it was John that he’d chosen. John had become like family to her; almost like a brother, and even though they acted as they always had, she could see they were both happy. She almost teared up watching John as he tried not to look
“That statement raises a lot of questions, but the most important is this: Just how harmless is this… Steven, anyway? If Rosie’s going to live here, it’s going to have to be safe for her. No loaded guns, no toxic chemicals, no severed heads in the fridge… and Bill. Bill’s got to go. He may be clean at the moment, but we both know he’s still using.”
“That does seem like sound medical advice.” John grinned, his cock already half hard from massaging his lover’s body. He looked admiringly at the body laid out before him. “Have I told you how beautiful you are?”
“I honestly don’t know. Something expensive, I’d guess.” He blushed, knowing Greg had to realize it wasn’t for him or Sherlock. “Red, I think.”
“You are the only one of your kind right now and it makes you feel alone. I know what that is like. I am the only one like me that will ever be and I have done things that even the Gods called monstrous. But I am not a monster and neither are you. I have found a pack to be part of and humans that trust and care about me. You can do the same, but you must learn to trust and care about yourself. You must learn to love what you are. Think on these things and if you want to learn, seek me out when the sun leaves the sky and I will teach you.” Fenris slipped back into wolf form, leaving Liam to think over what he’d said.
“Of course not. Don’t be ludicrous.” Her brow knitted as she gazed at him in concern. This was the last thing she’d expect from the ever-logical Mycroft Holmes. “Is this some sort of joke?”
it. The kid’s standin’ right here sayin’ her Mum did it, but she’s got an alibi, and three people backing her story up.” Greg ground his teeth in frustration. Cases involving children were always rough, but this was hard to handle, even for him. “And tell John to get Mary down here. I could use her help.” Greg hung up the mobile, resisting the urge to kick the nearest object.
“Don’t rub it in.” He took a few angry bites from his sandwich and instantly regretted it. It sat like a lead weight in his stomach. “Look, there’s no real point in talking about it, because nothing’s going to change. You know how he feels about… things. So even if I… if I felt anything it wouldn’t matter. As per usual.”
“Yeah, I figured you could”, Greg said drily, then grinned, kissing Mycroft’s neck. “But this is more fun. It’s kinda a turn-on, stripping you outta your clothes.” He took his own shirt off as Mycroft carefully hung up his waistcoat, then went to work on Mycroft’s shirt buttons.
“Molly, I know you’re gonna think I’m off my rocker, but hear me out first, and know that both Mycroft and Sherlock back me up on this. Somehow, in the last few months, magic has become real.”
“Alice, Mary’s a good friend of mine, and she’s a really nice lady. I need to go somewhere, just for a little while, and then I’ll be right back. Will you stay here with her while I do?”
tell John. The only reason he stayed behind was for Rosie’s sake.” Sherlock smirked, leaving out the rather long argument they’d had about it and the fact that he’d conveniently left out Lucifer’s warning when he’d told him.
… Greg, yes…” Mycroft wrapped his legs around Greg’s waist, eyes glittering with pleasure as his lover’s thick cock sank deep into his body. His arms circled Greg’s neck, clinging to him as he cried out his name. As much as he enjoyed topping him, or their creative antics with Fenris, this would always be Mycroft’s favorite moment; that blissful mix of pain and ecstasy when Greg entered him, claiming him body and soul.
know, it seems I may have some gift for it, but it’s a very difficult and at this point, unpredictable thing. More research is in order before I can know with any certainty how to wield it effectively, so I’d appreciate it if you would keep this between us for now.”
“I… Do you seriously think I’d believe you? You’re not trying to help him. You just want him, and you can’t stand being told no, can you?”
“Is Mummy going to jail for hurting me? I don’t want to stay with her, but Dad has a new wife and he doesn’t want me. Mummy says
“And what does that mean?”, Loki growled. Although it was a fight he was sure he’d lose, he was frustrated and bored with the situation he’d found himself in and punching Lucifer right on that smug nose of his was beginning to look like an option.
“Yes.” John flushed red and his eyes filled with guilt, but he hadn’t been able to resist answering. For a moment, he’d pictured what it would be like to be pinned between the two of them. “But that doesn’t mean…I wouldn’t… I love Sherlock. I’d never do anything to hurt him.”
words for it! Which one is best? Whichever one, I want to do that. I want to make you so hard that you are aching to… fuck me. While you are doing that I can lick Greg. Then he can fuck me. Then I want to fuck one of you if you will let me. Or both of you. And maybe some more licking. I really like licking.”
“So,” said Greg. “I set up a meeting for you with our vampire for two o’clock this afternoon. His info’s on the flash drive, and I put the copy of the file with my notes on the top of the pile.” He set the flash drive down on the large stack of files he’d dropped off. “Be
“God, Lover, I want your cock inside me so much”, Greg growled softly as he felt it throbbing in his grasp. He reached over, grabbing the lube from the bedside table and warming it in his hand before spreading it on his lover’s hard, hot flesh. Mycroft moaned softly, thrusting into his touch. Rolling over to take the bottle from him, he coated his fingers and worked them into Greg’s body as Fenris slid down and spread Mycroft’s cheeks.
“I’m okay. I’m here, the dragon’s dead, and we’re both still alive.” He reached up, tracing the streak of white that now ran through Mycroft’s hair. “You did good. Rest now, lover. You’ve done your part.”
“What about all the people you helped save? Do you really think the team could have stopped them if you hadn’t been there to help? I heard Thomas talking about it. If you hadn’t been there, how many of those things would have gotten past him and the others? Right now, while we’re sitting here, someone else in this city is alive to see this sunset because
“She’s not set a date, but as soon as she can. She’s trying to save up enough for a decent flat, but if you hire her, I’m sure she could start right away. Why don’t I see if she can come up for a visit tomorrow?”
“John.” Sherlock’s eyes suddenly focused, but his voice was strangely flat. “Are you real? Why are you here? You had work today. Did you have work today or am I just… misremembering that?”
“That’s a funny name too. I don’t think I like it.” She wrinkled her nose in distaste. Mycroft and Sherlock both exchanged glances, wondering if there was any significance to her dislike of her old name.
“What do you mean she’s not there? She’s been under constant surveillance the entire time. How could she not be there?” Sherlock paced the room, subverting his anxiety into restless energy. There was no way to know how long his sister had been free, and he shuddered to think of the damage she’d cause.
“Sure.” Greg grinned, reaching down to ruffle his ears as he leaned over to give Mycroft a kiss. “But lose the fur.”
“What? You’re kidding me! If this is some kind of joke, it isn’t funny.” His mind couldn’t make sense of the idea.
“Well, as I’ve always said, live and let live. Whatever those two are up to with Mycroft, it seems to have done him a world of good. I actually caught him smiling earlier.”
“Because that’s how long it takes Lucifer to grow that feather back, and apparently he can’t fly home without it.”
hope you keep him on. He may have an appalling lack of spy skills, but John says he makes an excellent
, you two are. You almost made yur landlady drop the tea tray.” Bill stepped into the room, café menu in hand. “Sherlock said you’d order down for me.”
“It looks like the police have things under control. They’ll reach our position soon.” Mary was far too exhausted to possess any more bodies, and the seemingly never-ending tide of undead was finally starting to ebb. “Can you get Liam calmed down? We need to get out of here.”
“Mary doesn’t have to kill a toad if she doesn’t want to.” John gave Sherlock a warning glance and rolled his eyes. “And
“I know, Dad.” Greg smiled gently at his father. “Just you trying means a lot. Stay here, and I’ll go get Tim.”
“Right. Here, keep this for me, Sherlock.” Mary handed him her necklace. “I don’t want her grabbing it.”
“Yes, poor dear.” Mrs. Hudson handed him a picture from her mantle of a young woman with short dark hair and large blue eyes, holding a baby. “She’s a lovely girl, really, and a wonderful mother.”
“You are?” John looked at her in surprise. The last time they’d talked, she’d all but ordered him to find a nanny as soon as possible and then reminded him of the many social opportunities she was giving up. “Why?”
“I want that, Greg. I want you to take me. I want to feel you drive yourself deep inside when you cum. And I want you to suck my cock until I cum and then kiss me, I want to taste myself on your lips, I want… I want
“Isn’t it? Disturbing as the whole idea is, even if I… if I were in love with him, it doesn’t mean things have to change. It doesn’t even mean I
“Then what you did back there, the ice… that was magic?” Arthur looked at his son in astonishment. “You’re some kind of… of wizard?”
Lucifer sighed, wishing he at least had one of Maze’s hell-forged knives to fight with. Even the sharpened edges of his wings wouldn’t penetrate the dragon’s scaly hide. A blast of dragon-fire flowed around him, instantly disintegrating his suit.
“Kinda. I’ve only dated one girl who even let me do arse stuff, and it was this whole big deal with some kinda secret washroom prep, and then there was, uh… licking and fingers and a lot of lube…”
werewolf. I would hope you share my curiosity about your condition. How do you feel about being a werewolf?”
, if you like the taste…” He gasped as Sherlock tongued his nipple, lightly nibbling on it with his teeth. “Oh god, I love it when you do that.”
, Sherlock would remain as dismissive of romantic entanglements as ever, and John would never live it down. At worst
“It’s a bit fuzzy. John, obviously.” She looked lovingly at John. “The next thing I remember is John.”
“Well then, I’ll leave you to your misery for now.” Lucifer gingerly pushed Fenris’s bowels back inside him and took to the sky, heading towards Whitehall. He sincerely hoped the sorcerer had been able to deal with the dragon. It wasn’t an experience he ever wanted to repeat.
You fucking come out on Twitter before you tell me? And why didn’t you answer me when I texted you?”
Sherlock had arranged for John and Molly to examine Thomas and Liam at the blood clinic Challenger owned. Even knowing what to expect hadn’t properly prepared them for the reality of watching the form of a man shimmer and become that of a wolf. Between the equipment there and what Molly had brought, they managed a good set of readings, measurements and samples.
“Yes, Mummy, he’ll be with us on weekends and throughout summer. He is, after all, about to be my nephew as well.” Mycroft truly detested being called Mikey, but he resisted his strong inclination to correct her in the interest of getting this dinner over with a minimum of trouble.
Greg was no fool. Mycroft just might save the world with this team he was putting together, but he was also maneuvering himself in to a position of power in doing so. By the time the dust settled, he’d be the director of the most powerful agency in England, if not the world. Magic was going to change the world. Mycroft had been tracking the rise of magic, preparing for that time when the world’s awareness of it made the leap from tabloid headlines to front page news. There was going to be chaos if someone wasn’t there to reassure the public that they could keep them safe, and Greg couldn’t think of a better man for the job.
“Dad’s kicked me out.”  He dropped his things beside the chair and sat down, looking miserable. “I didn’t know where else to go.”
He rolled over, drawing Sherlock in for a kiss before his lover returned the favor, teasing and licking his way down John’s body. His tongue slid across the underside of his cock as he swallowed him, lips locked around the base as his talented throat muscles contracted around the crown. John gasped as slick fingers caressed his balls, then teased their way across the smooth skin behind them. He parted his legs, raising his hips so Sherlock’s fingers could reach his opening. There was no fear now, just anticipation. As the first one slid in, caressing his prostate, he grabbed Sherlock’s hair and cried out his name. Sherlock ground his cock against John’s leg, urging his own flesh back to hardness. He drew out John’s pleasure as long as he could, fucking his fingers gently into him, caressing his prostate as he sucked him. By the time John came, erupting in his mouth and screaming his name, Sherlock was desperate to be inside him.
“What I mean is you can’t think straight, and I can barely think at all. What I mean is that you’re drinking more and I’m smoking more, because
been glorious.  Mycroft had done things he’d have found personally unimaginable, and his enthusiasm had overcome his inexperience. He’d been impaled on Greg’s cock, pinned to the bed by Greg’s strength and weight and silenced by Greg’s tongue in his mouth, and he’d never felt freer or more confident in his life.
“Not the word I’d use…” Greg growled. “I forgot she was off, so I dropped by the morgue. Guy there today probably thinks I’m a total nutter.
A thousand cutting things to say rushed through Mycroft’s mind. He quietly sat his olive aside and waited for Greg to continue.
…”, Mycroft panted. “… so good.” Greg’s body was hot and tight around his cock, while Fenris’s tongue fucked into his arse, lengthening as it pressed against his prostate in hot, wet spirals.
“I do hate to interrupt…” Lucifer stood in the doorway, grinning at the pair. “…but I thought you’d want the results from our tests of the girls as soon as possible.”
spoilin’ you.” He kissed his cheek and grinned happily. Mycroft had become much less self-conscious during their little clean-up ritual.  “You deserve it. Besides, it’s fun.”
“Oh. I must have forgotten”, Arthur said indulgently. She’d said no such thing, of course, but perhaps her attitude towards Mycroft’s relationship with Greg would soften if she had a chance to get to know him.
“Because the person I fell in love with is a man. It really is just that simple. I’m happy, Dad. I know it’s hard for you to accept, but can’t you just be glad that I’m happy and with somebody who really loves me?”
“Of course, I’m not sure. The only thing I’m sure about in all this is that I love you, and everything we’ve done up to now has been incredibly good. The first time, for you; didn’t it hurt? I tried to be gentle, but I’ve got to imagine it did.”
“Sherlock… I’m… I’ve never been very interested in toys in the bedroom. I like to do things the old-fashioned way…” He unbuttoned his shirt and set it beside the jumper.
“It’s not silly. It’s a normal reaction from a normal human being. I’m scared too, and I’ve had longer to get used to ghosts being around. Sherlock and Mycroft
“I have recently acquired some ability as a sorcerer. I have a spell that should return it to Hell, and another one that will contain it temporarily should that fail. The rest of you will be armed with swords and weapons loaded with explosive rounds, as we’ll need to decapitate it should my spells fail. Are you experienced with guns?”
“Good. You there, Craig. Get the computer system up and running. We need eyes on what’s happening outside ASAP. Greg, see that everyone’s properly equipped. I’ll be in my office, preparing spells. Sherlock, you and John come with me. I have a spell that should hide us from her, at least temporarily. It may buy us some time.”
“Yeah, pretty much. I can eat a bit of other stuff when I’m, you know, human, but I get these cravings…”
John sat and stared at his sandwich. He made a few half-hearted nibbles, then decided he’d eaten enough of it to count as a meal. Reluctantly, he made his way upstairs, wondering if Sherlock had returned and half hoping that he hadn’t.
sure I love you.” He gently rolled Sherlock onto his side, facing him. His hand trailed down his lover’s body and he reached down, his fingertip tracing the vein on Sherlock’s cock. His eyes traveled up and down his lover’s body, then back to his cock as his finger slid across the smooth head.
“Indeed.” Mycroft looked at his lover, letting a small smile curl at his lips. Anderson was far too nervous with him there for the fairies to come out. “I’ll leave you to it, then.”
“I’d do the same to him if I thought he’d gone mad. He’d be far too dangerous. As would I. I would have to say that I am
“According to Greg, yeah. I, um… kinda ran into him last night when I went down to the kitchen. He sort of figured out the wine wasn’t for us…”, John shrugged apologetically.
“What do you want? I could make you an omelet, or a sandwich, or we might have some leftover take-away…”
“I see.” Lady Smallwood’s lips tightened, and she arched one elegant eyebrow in accusation. “You told me you didn’t
“Yeah, and a whole lot of money too. He claims to get all his blood strictly on the legit, and by what I can find, that’s true. He funds a damn blood
“That’s not what I meant.” He stroked Sherlock’s cheek, and looked into his eyes. “Are you satisfied with it, what we do together?”
“I’m kinda too busy to teach you, but I’ll send one of my helpers. It’ll be a pain being short-staffed for a while, but it’s probably worth it in the long run. But if you run into any other mediums, you’ve got to promise to teach them in return. As long as they’re not, you know, assholes. You’re gonna have enough trouble with amateurs as it is.”
“Until I lost it. I fucking ate the bodies…” He clutched at his belly, stomach churning with the memory as he fought off another round of dry-heaving. “If Thomas hadn’t been able to get me under control, I’d have attacked the police. I almost bit him…”
“He can, but he can’t force me. We think it’s because I’m linked.” She sat on the end of the sofa, just out of Rosie’s reach, and waggled her fingers at her daughter playfully.
The tatters of its once brilliant mind hungered, yearning for completeness. It instinctively sought what it had sensed earlier; two brightly luminous minds among many dim ones. The pale sunlight had kept it at bay, hiding in the shadows, and now that night had fallen, they were gone. It paused, trying to track them like a hound catching a scent on the wind. One was lost to it; the distance was too great, but it could sense the other, far away. It flowed across the fog-shrouded landscape, making its way toward London.
time ago not to give two shites about what kinda label people wanna put on me, but lemme ask you just one simple question. Does he make you
“I can drop you two off at Whitehall.” Lucifer straightened the lines of his suit as his shimmering white wings popped out. His brown eyes turned a bright, glowing red as he summoned his demonic power, gathering it around himself like a mantle.
“That sounds very complicated. I was hoping you could help him. He is afraid he will be alone, and never be part of a pack. To be alone is the worst thing that could happen to a wolf or a werewolf. He may be the only werewolf there is right now and he has been human a long time, so human ways are all he knows. He needs to be part of a pack. Would you date a werewolf or would you only date a human?”
“We can go to the registrar’s office on Monday. There’s a twenty-eight day waiting period, so that would put us on the twenty-fourth of next month.”
which she had yelled repeatedly at high volume, as being a friend’s name. Halfway through the interview, Rosie had become bored with her new word, and, as she usually did, started combining it with words she already knew. Her first combination had been particularly unfortunate. “Dick
person. Now he’s apparently quite content being with Fenris as well, and with the idea of having three children in his life. It seems nearly incomprehensible.”
Sherlock spent the next several hours curled deep in his chair. Without moving, hardly breathing, eyes closed, he revisited several cases in seemingly perfect detail. Most dismissed or unsolved, they all had only one thing in common. In each one, there was some unexplained element that would, to an illogical mind, seem to be supernatural in nature. Each individual case could be dismissed, put down to exaggerations or delusions on the part of witnesses and such, but taken as a whole they represented a distinct pattern he was convinced no rational man would believe. Balanced against believing in the supernatural, believing he was suffering from some psychosis was the only credible theory.
Mycroft was sitting at the kitchen bar, sipping a martini and wondering why he’d chosen that room for their meeting. It had seemed oddly appropriate at the time, but now he couldn’t quite place why.
Sherlock writhed underneath him, self-control shattered, cold intellect overtaken by wild abandon. There was only John; the taste and scent of him, the heat of his body, the urgent need for friction. John moaned, close to cumming, as Sherlock arched beneath him, whispering his name, driving him over the edge with him. John kissed him again, enraptured in the afterglow, then collapsed on top of him, panting and dazed.
“I’ve got to get Rosie and go to the house soon. We’ve the nannies to interview this afternoon.” John frowned. He’d resisted the idea of having a full-time nanny, and even now, despite the obvious necessity, he still didn’t like the idea of leaving Rosie with a virtual stranger. He’d been dreading the interviews, and chasing down potentially murderous garden fairies sounded much more appealing. “I guess I’ll see you after that, then.”
“It probably saved your life… and Mycroft’s. Without your warning…” He shuddered, thinking of how close he’d come to losing him. “I couldn’t bear losing you”, he said softly.
hard for me. There are much bigger things on which we should be focused. You know that. I know that, but this… attraction is
“True. I never thought of that. I’ll pop down and see Mrs. Hudson.” A thought struck him, and he paused at the door. “About tonight… Well,
, we’ve got a briefcase full of the impossible waiting on your kitchen counter that needs our attention. So, let’s iron out these details while we get cleaned up and dressed, and then get to work.”
“He’ll be placed in a secure facility for the criminally insane. He won’t be seeing the light of day for a very long time, if ever. Steven, does the madness caused by your venom ever wear off?”
“I love you too.” Greg patted his back reassuringly. “I’ll be fine.” He silently prayed he wasn’t lying.
“Sherlock”, John laughed. “Slow down.” They’d barely made it through the door and Sherlock was already pulling John’s clothes off along with his own. His response was to practically rip John’s jumper off, tossing it aside. John pushed him against the wall, kissing him passionately as Sherlock’s long fingers made quick work of undoing his trousers and yanking them down, along with his pants.
“Yes. Please have a seat.” Mycroft sighed softly, noting Tim’s nervousness. For some reason, the boy didn’t seem to be able to look him in the eye. “You’re not in trouble, Tim.”
It felt strange coming to this realization so late in life, but he now had no qualms about identifying himself as bisexual. Sherlock was still the only man he wanted, but the idea that he might notice an attractive man in the same way he noticed a beautiful woman didn’t seem so unthinkable anymore. It didn’t lessen or change the incredible love and devotion he felt for Sherlock. If anything, he was even more in love with him and very grateful that he’d been the one to lead him to this self-realization. For the first time in his life, John felt entirely comfortable in his own skin, and it felt good.
“Yes, it does. And he is quite useful to have around. One does pity the intruder that gets past my security team with him about the place.”
Sherlock moaned into John’s mouth as Lucifer’s long fingers slid inside him, pressing against his prostate. He closed his eyes, trying to open his mind, concentrating on Lucifer’s voice and the sensations around him: the hardness of John’s cock, the heat of his mouth, the soft sea of feathers surrounding them.
“You’re right. I’m sorry.” She abruptly stopped struggling and cocked her head, smiling at him. She might not be able to use any magic directly on him, but she could still see the pattern of the world around him. An enormous bolt of lightning shot down from the hazy, smoke-filled night sky, striking Loki on its way to the rooftop beneath him. John cried out, trying to shield his eyes from the blinding brightness. It was so close he could feel his hair, standing on end. Sherlock rose to his feet, making his way back to John and wrapping his good arm around him, pulling him further from the pair.
John looked at his daughter, who had ceased crying and was now looking at him with wide blue eyes. She gave a little hiccup and he patted her back, soothing her as he laid in her crib.
“It’s highly likely. Loki did refer to her as a Goddess. You’re going to have to be extremely careful with her, Mycroft. We have no idea what kind of powers she has, and even
“I am. I’ve got to go rest for a while, but I’ll try to contact Greg and let him know you’re alright.”
…” John felt his body begin to tingle as Sherlock’s finger caressed inside him. It wasn’t long before his limbs began to tremble as wave after wave of pleasure washed over him. It seemed to last forever; one orgasm after another, until he thought he might pass out from sheer ecstasy. Gasping for breath, he could finally take no more, and had to beg Sherlock to stop.
“Yes, and though he has some very reasonable reservations, given her history, he’s in agreement with me. If we can safely do so, we’ll care for her together. He’s always wanted children.” He smiled gently, thinking of the affection Greg had shown Alice. “He’s quite good with them. He’ll make an excellent father.”
“It’s alright. You can’t really hurt me.” Thomas licked at the blood oozing from Liam’s wrist, relishing the warmth and the taste on his tongue. He was intrigued by the exotic flavor; much less salty than human blood, and gamier, but delicious nonetheless.
“Then let’s get going.” Sherlock stood, pulling John up with him and giving him a quick kiss. “The game is on, John!”
“Been there the whole time then, have you?” His anger abruptly melted, and he glanced guiltily at the computer screen, blushing.
Greg returned to find Mycroft braced against the wall of their large walk-in shower with Fenris kneeling behind him, enthusiastically licking his arse. Greg tossed his dressing gown aside and joined them, smiling happily.
“Don’t be silly. Of course it’s not the news. It’s just one of those films they make these days. Stop it. You’re going to scare the ladies.” He smiled reassuringly at Mrs. Hudson, who he found he fancied a bit. “He’s just at
“Me too. John’s always kept him grounded. I owe you a tenner, by the way. You were right about Janine.”
“It’s… rather complicated, but there’s a new player on the board; one that poses a significant threat. Meet Sherlock at my home, and he’ll brief you. I really don’t want to go into it over the mobile. And have your jet readied as well. It’s best we evacuate anyone non-essential. We estimate that the south of Spain should be far enough to be out of the range of magic.”
“While that’s an extraordinarily flattering offer, I’m afraid I must decline.” He reached back and grabbed John’s thigh, pinning him in place. “I think you’d find me disappointing.”
pleased at that”, Mary chuckled. She looked at him admiringly, thinking how far he’d come in just three days.
me.” He grinned as Mycroft squirmed beneath him, seeking to drive him deeper. “Tell me if you want me to suck your cock until you cum.”
“I thought a bit less formality between us might ease things for the boy. I’m sure this has all been rather difficult for him. He’s quite good with the fairies, by the way. They were very brightly colored this morning.”
“Mycroft, your little book of spells isn’t going to do any good against her. Eurus can do more than just see the pattern. She can manipulate it, which means she’s capable of doing nearly anything she can conceive of. She doesn’t need spells to wield magic.”
“I can’t tell you. I just know or I don’t. Your mind is human so it doesn’t work like mine. I never smell things that aren’t there. You should find another God to teach you that. Would you like to have sex instead?” He cocked his head, breathing in deeply. It was much harder catching a scent in human form.
Greg had plenty of time to think during the drive to Challenger’s family home in Rotherford, and the more he did, the better he felt about this little trip to Dracula’s castle. He wondered how the others would feel when they found out the vampire was now part of the team. Greg wasn’t thrilled with it, but he understood why Mycroft had made the deal with Challenger. In the end, it had come down to money and time.
care, but I think you’ve made the right decision. Being out means you don’t gotta worry about blackmail.”
“It disintegrated.” He sighed softly. “I’ll explain it later.” His sleek black sedan pulled up beside them. “Please just go to your hotel.”
was an idea that was difficult for him to let himself imagine. However, once he did, he suddenly and to his great horror realized that his imagination had a
“I don’t know if I should be more appalled by the fact that you’re still here or the suggestion that I have a… squishy side. The implication of either one being true is dreadful.”
“We’re all just one big, happy family, Mother.” Sherlock grinned, enjoying the confused look on his mother’s face.
you to be able to focus on this crisis. So just listen to me for once in your life, please. I expect when it does come down to the two of you and… sex, you’re going to have to be strong. You’re going to want to panic, and I don’t think John would handle that very well. I admit I found the reality of it rather daunting at first, but Greg has a way of very gently and patiently of guiding me past my misgivings. John won’t be able to do that. You can
“Perhaps, but it’s true and you know it.” Sherlock smirked. “You’re the resident sorcerer in this little group, brother dear. You’re going to have to resign yourself to doing
“Yeah. I like our little rituals.” He pulled him into his arms, kissing him again. “We’re good for each other, Mycroft.”
“I’m going to kill you.” Sherlock’s voice was deadly calm and matter-of-fact. The doors of his mind palace had slammed shut, cutting off all emotions except one: the cold, implacable need to see John’s killer destroyed. Nothing else mattered in that moment.
“Do you think they’re really going to have a three-way with Fenris?” John wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to know, but his curiosity had got the better of him. “It’s hard to imagine your brother would go along with something like that. Not that I
, Greg”, he solemnly intoned. Sherlock was, as always, posed dramatically, the sun at his back and his coat collar flared. His tone was deadly serious, and his eyes flashed like steel. Greg was suddenly reminded of the first time he’d met his former father-in-law, and the urge to burst out laughing was nearly overwhelming. He took a long drag off the cigarette instead, grinning.
Mycroft knelt behind him, quickly spreading oil on his cock. He drove it in hard and fast, knowing Greg liked a little pain mixed with his pleasure.
, when you look at it that way…” Mycroft froze, somewhat proud he hadn’t flinched. Greg was… very close. He found he didn’t mind nearly as much as he thought he would. “Maybe this would be simpler if you told me what
“He’s made a lot of things easier.” John tried, very hard, not to fidget or blush. “Having him to talk to about me and Sherlock, I mean.”
“No. Let John take charge of that. Mycroft, take the concealment spell off me. If I can draw her attention, it might prevent her from summoning anything else.”
“Un-distract him.” He snorted, growling at the phone. “And how am I supposed to do that without getting distracted myself? How is it that you’re
“I love you, Sherlock. I love you, so much.” John rolled him over onto his back, tenderly kissing him as Sherlock’s hands roamed across his skin. He grabbed the oil and spread it on his fingers, slipping them between his lover’s cheeks to caress his opening. Sherlock moaned softly as he slid one in.
gay, it’d be different, but I’m genuinely afraid I’ll just snap. That we’ll be together one day, and I’ll just panic and lash out at him or just
“Certainly. As I told Inspector Lestrade, I’m happy to be of assistance. Please feel free to ask me anything that you feel appropriate.”
“It’s… from Death.” Sherlock could feel a mild pressure in his mind, along with the intuitive knowledge of what the raven was. He frowned slightly, still uneasy about being a Seer. He glanced over at Greg. “Your tutor, I presume.”
He heard the tea tray rattle as she sat it down, and his stomach growled. Unable to wait any longer, he dashed to the bathroom. She was still there when he finished, squealing in outrage.
effect on you, does it? Well, the good news is that we can probably skip the bit with the toad’s blood.”
that is related to the rise of magic is merely speculation. I’ll give you what notes I can and the audio recording from the salvage team.”
“That’s incredible. You can do all that, just in one morning?” He gazed proudly at Mycroft, his deep brown eyes filled with admiration. “You’re amazin’, lover.”
reckless, brother mine.” Mycroft looked at Sherlock in exasperation. “You’ve made a very open-ended deal with what is essentially a foreign potentate to aid illegal aliens on British soil.” He glared at Steven, who sat perched possessively on Sherlock’s shoulder, slowly flashing his wings and hissing softly. “And you’ve brought back a
“Yeah.” Greg sighed softly as the boy went back to staring at his shoes. “You got questions, don’t you?”
here, Mr. Holmes. I don’t think they like grown-ups very much.” She peered doubtfully up at him through thick glasses. “They might, though. You brought biscuits.”
“I do have to admit I don’t like leaving him alone with you. He was very… flirtatious at dinner last night.”
not good. Do you even listen to yourself? Sometimes you really do sound like a heartless, self-absorbed bastard. Are you really more concerned about having dinner with you parents than the fact that innocent children can end up in Hell?”
He’d been wrong. When Sherlock embraced a new skill, he honed it quickly, and this was no exception. He teased John to the point that he was writhing beneath him, mindlessly babbling Sherlock’s name and pleading. Sherlock slowly swallowed him, pinning his hips to prevent him from thrusting, until his lips were locked around the base and the crown was pressed against the back of his throat. He swallowed, muscles contracting around the head John’s cock. Slowly but steadily increasing the rhythm until John was near orgasm, he slid back up. Taking a deep breath, he engulfed him again, repeating the process until John was begging him for release.
The work continued, both at home and at the new headquarters. There had still been no word on Moriarty, but they all know it was only a matter of time until he resurfaced, more dangerous than ever. Scotland yard continued to come to them with cases both magical and mundane, though it was Sally Donovan that brought them instead of Greg. Sherlock began the task of cataloguing and ensuring the safety of fairy hives while working daily with Loki to master his Seer abilities. John began quietly making the rounds at St. Bart’s, using his healing abilities to help when he could. Mary worked closely with Greg, cataloguing and sometimes capturing London’s ghosts with the aid of Bran..
, though. Maybe, you know, a bit when I was younger, sure, but I don’t have a problem with gay people. My sister’s gay.”
been attracted to another man, but with Sherlock… it’s different somehow. It just took me a long time to admit it to myself.”
“It… I don’t know, Sherlock. Despite that… what we just did, I’m still not gay, and it’s hard for me to imagine us as a couple, raising Rosie and growing old together. I think I need time to get used to the idea, but I… I know I can’t imagine my life without you in it.”
“That is good because I would not permit you to enslave him. I carry the power of Asgard’s sun in my right eye and I would burn you to ash if you did.”
” The raven circled the van, keeping it clear. Thomas tore the back door off the van as the woman inside screamed.
“There’s no need for violence, ill-advised though it would be. You and Sherlock have something in common that you haven’t discussed.
. I don’t want that creature flitting about at meetings.” He glared at the fairy, not bothering to hide his distaste.
“No, it’s just hard to imagine. He’s just so…” He paused, sensing that the wrong choice of word might lead to something much worse than losing a potential job. “…terrifying.”
“Entirely.” He stretched and rolled over, facing his lover with a smile. “I feel strangely rested for someone who only had a couple of hours of sleep.”
. There’s a file on Alice in my office. If something happens to me and Mycroft, I want you to make sure she’s taken care of.”
“In what way?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes warily. This conversation suddenly had the potential of going in a direction he was especially unwilling to go.
“You already have. Bein’ with you is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I’ve been in love before, but never like this.” His deep brown eyes shone with happiness. “Now come on, lover. Let’s get some sleep while we can.”
“Of course I did. I let him know you stepped up and took over where he failed. I tell you, if I was a little younger, I’d have given that boy a sound thrashing, I would. The very thought of it; tossing his own son out on the streets like that!”
“You needn’t worry, John. You’re far more tempting to me than he is. I suppose I should text Mycroft and let him know.”
When they were done and all cleaned up, Fenris had changed to wolf form and curled up on the bed beside Greg. Much to Greg’s surprise, Mycroft hadn’t objected. Instead, he’d affectionately ruffled the wolf’s ears and told him he’d left some clothes for him in the chair for when he woke. Greg tightened his arm around his lover and smiled. He’d always suspected that under all his shyness and reticence, Mycroft had a kinky side. Seeing his lover become progressively more dominate throughout the night had been incredibly erotic. As sweetly moving as his initial shyness was when their relationship began had been, Greg enjoyed seeing this confident, kinky side of his lover.
to lose, because I am the one with the connections to get things done. Sherlock, imagine the chaos this will cause when the general public finds out. We need to find ways to prepare for a number of potential scenarios, but we can’t do that until we understand what we’re dealing with.”
“Do I have to ask Mycroft, then? Because God help me, I’m perfectly prepared to march right downstairs and ask him what happened…”
“And what do you want with a hell-hound, Mycroft Holmes? I’m assuming you didn’t intend to summon me.”
“I think certain concessions might be made.” John shifted uncomfortably under his gaze. He tried to look away, but there was something hypnotic about Sherlock’s eyes at times.
“Yes, I presume so.”  Mycroft watched him rummaging through the refrigerator searching for breakfast ingredients. Seeing Greg with the fairies had reminded him of how different the two of them were. Greg had greeted them with an almost child-like delight, and Mycroft had seen the fairies transform right before his eyes. They’d been, according to Sherlock, a drab and somber lot compared to the other hive, but after fifteen minutes with Greg, they’d become more colorful and vibrant. He’d literally disarmed them, and only a few had retained their weaponry by the time they’d gone back inside. “Greg, about last night…”
“Yeah.” Unable to meet Tom’s gaze, his bright yellow eyes were focused on the floor. “It’s not as big of a deal in the day, but I can’t… It’s really hard to keep from changing when I’m… you know.”
“That may be one of the most idiotic but romantic things anyone’s ever said. Of course your soul is worth the risk.”
“Perhaps, if you have the gift. It seems that not everyone can wield magic. Tim, you do understand that you can’t tell anyone about any of this, no matter how tempted you may be to do so. I can’t stress enough how very important it is that you don’t say a word to anyone, no matter what.”
me.” Mycroft reached over, grabbing the lube off the bedside table and handing it to him. “I want… I
“You don’t have to.” He pulled him closer, nuzzling his neck and whispering into his ear. “Forever, Mycroft.”
“And another thing. We’ve had our disagreements, but when have I ever not been supportive of your sexuality?”
“Among other things, yes. I’m… very concerned at the moment.” He’d worked it out. When he imagined someone in the room, it was if they were actually there, down to the smallest detail of shadow and reflection. Mary
“Fuck no, and fuck him too. Are you alright? Where are you?” Tim blinked back tears at the sound of his older brother’s voice.
“I’d much rather they were heading to Cadiz with the others. It would be the sensible thing to do.” Mycroft sighed softly, knowing Greg wouldn’t leave his side, nor would be abandon the city to its fate. “Neither of them will be much use if this comes down to a magical battle.”
“Yes. You people owe me an Armani. You do know it’s a bit presumptuous to give me orders, don’t you?” Lucifer’s lips curled with amusement.
“And what if I cum first?” Greg slipped a second finger in, twining then together as he slowly slipped them in-and-out. “What do you want me to do with your cock?”
“Yeah, so does Mycroft… pick up skills quick, I mean. Just look at how quick he’s learned magic. He just got the book yesterday, and he’s already saved us once with it. We’re lucky guys, you and me.”
“So, no, not really then.” John sighed softly. “You do need to sleep occasionally, you know. The girls are back, by the way, and so is Mary. They’re settling into one of the spare rooms.”
“I have other titles as well, and abilities that are part of my nature. Besides, while I may have abandoned the throne, no one else has claimed it. Until someone does, I’m still capable of wielding that power. I just choose not to.”
“What am I going to do with you?” John grumbled. He wanted to be angry. He decided he had every right to be angry, but his anger crumbled under the weight of what Sherlock had said. He placed John’s love
“Just sit quiet, and you’ll see.” Greg dug through his pockets and retrieved a small packet of biscuits, rattling the cellophane as he opened it. He broke one of the biscuits into smaller pieces and placed them in the palm of his outstretched hand. With moments, a large bee appeared and landed on his shoulder. Anderson’s eyes grew wide, and he shivered.
“I really can’t even imagine that sort of life.” Mycroft smiled lovingly at him, and reached across the table, covering Greg’s hand with his. “I thought I’d grow old alone. It took
“I was wondering about that. I noticed he always came when one of us did. I still can’t believe I let him top me. It didn’t hurt nearly as much as I thought it would. It was actually quite… good.”
Greg growled softly, not sure how to feel about Mycroft’s “special protection”. Keeping field command under Mycroft’s direct supervision was a sound idea but getting special treatment at work because Mycroft was his lover didn’t sit well with him. He was a bit surprised. One of the problems he’d always had with relationships was that Greg had often had to put his work first. There’d been too many plans cancelled and too many nights when he’d been called in to work. Now the problem was his partner wasn’t putting his own work first, and that didn’t fit with what he expected from Mycroft. By the time he pulled in Mycroft’s driveway, he’d worked through his initial anger, and decided he’d calmly ask him what his reasoning was.
“How does that help? It’s not as if he’s going to stand still so we can pound a stake through his heart.”
“How about Phillip Anderson?” Greg suggested, glancing at Sherlock somewhat apologetically. “He’s a decent forensic technician, and he seems like he’s got his head together these days.”
a couple. His arguments had been passionate but sensible, and Mycroft had found himself in complete agreement, even though it had all seemed to him to have happened very fast indeed. It wasn’t a bad plan, really. They would be casually open about it with friends and associates and arrange to be seen in public together in appropriately unremarkable places. In this day and age, it’d likely go ignored in the press. Mycroft found himself with several unanswered questions about what sort of duties and obligations came with being a couple, but Greg had just laughed and promised that would work itself out as they went. Mycroft decided he wasn’t surrendering control so much as delegating authority. Greg was the superior expert in matters of emotion, and Mycroft trusted him.
“I’m makin’ dinner, so why don’t you two get acquainted.” Greg grinned at the two and kissed Mycroft on the cheek. “You want your usual?”
“Yeah, and it’s good and thick too. I mean, I’ve always been proud of mine, and it’s just a bit bigger than average. You gotta be at least seven inches, and if I remember my statistics right, that puts you up in the top ten percent.”
, really, it’s just…” John closed the folder and looked over at Sherlock, eyes suddenly searching for an answer.
“Sure, wine’s fine.” He chuckled. A large, ornately framed mirror hung opposite of them, reflecting them both. “Silver. We thought you’d reflect in it. Ghosts do the same; at least some of them do.” He took the glass from his host, glancing at him curiously. “I’m curious to know why you left out some things when we had that little conversation about your abilities, Mr. Challenger.”
“Yeah, kinda.” He gestured at the small form sleeping in a nearby medical bed. “Moriarty’s still out there somewhere, but we’ll get him. Lay back down before you fall down.”
“There’s a small herd of deer, but I’d rather us not kill any of them. I’ve just re-established them and I’m trying to build their numbers up.”
“I thought it might be something like that, what with you being with the government, and Uncle Greg being with the Yard. Does he have some sort of special power too?”
“It will be good to have the house to ourselves again.” Smiling, Mycroft stood behind Greg in the closet, unbuttoning his shirt. He asked Greg to make sure the girls were safely tucked in, giving him a chance to quickly undress himself before his lover got back to the bedroom. It was time, he thought, to spoil Greg for a change. He slid his hands beneath Greg’s undershirt, caressing his skin. “You really have been very helpful in all of this. I’m quite sure having so many houseguests would have driven me mad without your help.”
Greg leaned down, kissing Mycroft’s ear and whispering in his soft growl. “I love you too, Mycroft.”
“No. He only senses guilt, something a true psychopath has none of. He might be of use in finding out her greatest desire, but she may be able to resist answering. We’d never know if her answer was truth or not. But there is a way of determining her
“I’m not sure that’s true. Remember the assurances he demanded of Thomas? Why would an evil being demand he not kill? If he were evil, then why would he care? And why exact a promise that he wouldn’t create more vampires?”
“I wasn’t always the Devil, John.” Lucifer’s pure white wings sprang from his back, a shimmering reminder of what he once was. He wrapped them around them both, engulfing John in a sea of pure white, then gently tugged out a pin feather and handed it to him. “Here. Now there’s no need to call it blackmail. You and I can set him free together. That’ll have to grow back before I can fly properly, so you’ve got three days to decide. I’m not flying commercial. It’s abysmal. All you have to do is ask me a favor. Ask me to help him. You already know what I want in return.”
“I’m a monster.” He pulled his hand away. “I didn’t know. I thought it was all just running under the moon and having fun, but it’s not. If Thomas hadn’t been able to get me under control, I’d have done a lot worse. He’s my best friend, and I almost turned on him, even after all he’s done for me.”
“I know what happened. Fenris told me.” She sat beside him, quietly reaching out to take his hand. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“Come on, my love.” John rose, taking Sherlock by the hand. “I’m here for you. I’ll always be here for you.” He led him to the bedroom, slowly undressing him as Sherlock stood there, mute and almost unresponsive. He tucked him into bed and hastily stripped his own suit off, slipping in to lie beside him and taking him into his arms. Sherlock laid his head on his chest, holding him tightly and listening to the beat of his heart.
“I could just stay here. I don’t wanna be in the way, what with you just getting engaged.” Tim looked at him anxiously, brushing his hands through his chestnut brown hair.
Fenris pulled away, sitting with one hand on each of their thighs. He tugged gently at the sheet which covered the pair and grinned.
“I’m not selling my soul. All I want is to talk with him. From what Mary learned from Death, magic was sealed off almost three thousand years ago. We can learn from studying werewolves or vampires, but they’re just threads on the surface of the tapestry that is magic, and surface knowledge is all we’ll gain. To understand the bigger picture, I need to talk to one of the old ones; an entity like Death or Lucifer, who’s existed all along. We have no idea how long it will take the seal to break completely, or what the consequences of that will be. Time’s not on our side here, John. If Lucifer Morningstar isn’t what he says he is, then at worst I’ve have wasted a day or two. If he is genuine, then we have a chance to learn about the underlaying structure of magic and what kind of entities we may have to deal with. Problems like vampires or werewolves are easy to solve. You proved that in the lab tonight, and we now know how we might detain or destroy one. Dealing with ancient entities like Death or Lucifer is an entirely different proposition.”
Alice had jumped from the car and headed straight for Fenris, throwing her arms around his neck with a gleeful smile.
that’s relatively easy to deal with. Really, if people will just co-operate, all we need to do is send out a pamphlet and a gift basket of biscuits.”
“Yeah, and he was real good with them. I haven’t told him about the rest of it; he’s been through enough for now.”
“Let’s make a deal, Sherlock.” Lucifer’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “You leave her out of this and I’ll quit making John admit what he
Sherlock felt the flush of heat and goosepimples rising on John’s skin as he began to climax, and he let his own body follow, wanting them to orgasm together. He felt John’s cum, erupting slick and hot on his hand. They both cried out each other’s names as Sherlock’s orgasm followed, filling John’s body with his seed.
, but her not running out of here screaming when she saw you kind of balanced that out. And Kat does seem like a very good mother. I think she’ll take good care of Rosie. Letting her help Mrs. Hudson take care of her while we’re gone was a great idea.” John was sorting through the shirts he’d brought over, trying to decide which one was appropriate for a meeting with the Devil.
He stepped into a dimly lit, cavernous room. The small bottle of lube he’d impulsively bought felt strangely heavy in his pocket. A pathway of lighting showed the way, eventually leading to an entirely tradition kitchen.
“Leave it for observation…” He gritted his teeth, fighting a sudden overwhelming compulsion to answer against his will. “I’ll recommend to Mycroft that Molly take over the study of this hive for now…” His effort to resist showed on his brow as the words were dragged from him. “If they show any dangerous inclinations, I’ll secure the child and have the tree cut down.” He glared over at Oberon, eyes narrowed. “How did you force me to do that?”
“I’d like to try a spell to remedy that, if I may?” John nodded his assent, and he drew another piece of jade from his pocket.
“No.” He sighed softly, wondering if the face was worth all the explaining that came with it. “I just look like one. I’m the God Loki. I don’t know
“Useless as it was.” Mycroft smiled wanly. “And yes, I do see the irony in our situation. Our sister’s unfortunate condition might be good reason, perhaps, to question some of our long-held principles of personal conduct. It could be that in some situations, caring may be the
Mycroft looked around the space, feeling quite pleased at the progress the work crew had made. It would still take some time before all the equipment and appointments were installed, but the space should suit their purposes admirably. It was suitably large, with one above-ground level that had a roof suitable for helicopter landings and three below, all heavily-reinforced concrete. The ground level would be disguised as a private parking garage, and would house the various vehicles they might need. The first underground level would be where the offices would be located, along with living areas, a dining area, shooting range and armory, and common areas. The second level was reserved for the various labs and research areas, and the third would contain detention cells and a large space suitable for the practice of magic.
.” He grinned wolfishly. “We’ll probably be very late tonight, and I imagine chasing across London after a rogue demon is going to leave us a bit too tired.”
“We need you, Molly. Right now, it’s just the four of us… or five, countin’ Mary. We need your expertise in the lab, but more than that, Mycroft needs people we can
“Yeah, kinda. Look, leave your stuff in the car and come round back with me. There’s somethin’ you need to see.” Greg led him to the back yard, wondering how Tim would react. “You gotta promise not to freak out, okay?”
“Unfortunately not. There are a couple of people who, if they’re truthful in their claims, may merit investigation, but nothing pertinent to my situation.” He snorted dismissively, closing the laptop. “I’m going to talk to Fenris. He called me a seer. I want to know exactly what he meant. Do you want to come with?”
“Certainly. As I said, I want to help and working with you would be quite an honor. I’ve put my contact information on the flash drive, including my personal number. I look forward to hearing from you soon and am willing to devote myself and my resources to your investigation.”
I’ll see you out.” John looked over at Sherlock. “Are you sure you don’t want anything from the café?” Sherlock waved at him dismissively, not even looking up. John shrugged and followed Greg down the stairs.
could be dangerous. I could be dangerous. It’s a bit like going mad, what we’re about to do. At least to
“Hell, no. With Dad, it’s best I tell him alone. Tony, I’m just gonna call, or it’s gonna be a row. Probably end up punchin’ him out again.” He frowned, remembering the scene at his wedding, which had included an insulting speech from his brother, filled with homophobic references to Greg, that had ended in Tony being carried out. “He’s a real piece of work, Tony is.”
“She did? I can’t imagine why.” He smiled softly. He was beginning to get used to being deeply touched. “Violet said much the same thing. She want us to adopt her, so they’ll be sisters.”
“Of course, there is.” John sank into the white leather chair and grinned. “We can join the Mile-High Club.”
John, call Mrs. Hudson up.” He reached out, lifting the necklace then letting it go, while Mary fussed at him to be careful.
“Avoidance, probably. I really am dreading it. If you don’t want to come, I’d understand.” Despite his words, John could tell by the expression in his eyes that he desperately wanted him to be there.
“Good morning, brother mine. Do come in.” Mycroft nodded a greeting to John and led them into the kitchen. “How was your trip to L.A.? Was he genuine?”
Pleasing his lovers was something Greg took pride in. He liked making them moan, liked the sense of power he felt when he made them cum. He knew that in those brief moments of physical ecstasy, he was the entirety of his lover’s existence, and he liked how that made him feel.
“I know, but it’s the truth. There were always women in my life, and I just never let myself think about being with another man. Believe me, I’ve spent a lot of time in the last week sorting myself out, but I’m done with questioning myself. I’m bi, and I’m not ashamed to admit it. We’re in love, Harry, and I want to be with him forever. I’m going to marry him.”
“I was wondering if you’d be able to change in daylight as you got more control. Possibly this is a similar situation of just gaining better control over the change.” He smiled sympathetically. “Maybe you just need more practice.”
are we going?” The car Mycroft had sent for them pulled right onto the tarmac, heading towards a large, sleek Gulfstream jet with upswept wings and the letters TLC emblazoned on its tail.
“I was talking to the fairies. They told me that you scared them at first, but now you don’t. Then I tried to throw the ball to Alice, but she couldn’t catch it. I felt sad, because I wanted to play with her.” She frowned, wrinkling her nose as she tried to remember. “I wished Alice wasn’t a ghost, so we could play. I don’t think it was fair that she has to be a ghost. Then my head started to feel funny and I woke up here. That’s all I remember. I’m really hungry. Is it time for dinner yet?”
“Yeah.” He was sitting in the bed, legs drawn up, pretending to fiddle with his toenail as if he were embarrassed about his feelings. “I love her too, John,” he said softly.
stoop so low as to accuse me of having a… squishy side.” He chuckled, somewhat insanely. “Apparently, she’s wrong.
“Because I want to know. It’s only fair, after all.” John took a sip of the scotch he’d poured for himself to cover his embarrassment. “He made
“You’re not Mycroft. I don’t know what kind of… of trauma you went through to make you decide to use such extreme methods force yourself to become celibate all those years, but…”
“No. Hand me the blue chair. I think it’d look nice by the fireplace. Look, it lights up like a real one.”
“Other than being surprisingly scrupulous about ensuring certain promises from me before he granted my favor, he asked for nothing. I’m not allowed to kill except in self-defense; an easy vow to make, as I’m not by nature a violent man. He also instructed me that I wasn’t to transform anyone else without his express permission and made it quite clear that violating my word would have dire consequences.”
. I’ve work tomorrow.” He peered blearily at the apparition of his wife, sprawled comfortably across the sheets on what had been her side of the bed.
“How long will she be unconscious?” Sherlock knelt beside her, trembling slightly from the effort of locking away the riot of emotions he felt. “What has she become?”
“With Mummy there, he will probably tow the party line, but I expect he’ll be far more disappointed in Sherlock than in me. I think he gave up on any ambitions he might have had for grandchildren long ago as far as I’m concerned.”
“He would have hurt us, if it wasn’t for Steven.” Kat said softly. “Aunt Martha, would you get the girl’s breakfast ready? I think they’re probably hungry.” Like Sherlock, Kat know her aunt was happiest if she had something to do.
“It’s alright, John. He does need to know everything I can tell him if we’re going to figure out this ghost business.”
“I’m afraid so. Thankfully, he didn’t go into detail, but…” Mycroft sighed wearily. “He told him that he mated with us.”
“Thanks, Tom. Uh… does this make us lovers or something? That would be kinda too weird for me. I mean, I’m not gay.”
“Funny, isn’t it? How regardless of our respective lifestyle choices, for both of us, it all comes down to just one person. Just one chance to get it right. We’re not so different after all, are we?”
“No. Thomas asked if I’d like to have sex sometime but I’m still getting used to the idea that I don’t have to kill him. Vampires and werewolves used to be enemies but he has been a good friend to Liam. So maybe I can be friends with him but I still don’t want sex with a vampire. I just wanted to know what our pack’s rules are.”
“Yes, to a point. He’s been quite helpful. Disconcerting though it may be, he’s been very up-front about what he wants from me. Loki’s motives are far less clear.”
It was the first time he’d invited Lady Smallwood to lunch. After she’d left him her personal number, he’d taken to calling her to meet for drinks every few weeks or so. He found her support on the council useful, and he’d tried to cultivate her as an ally without encouraging any romantic interests she might have in him. He planned his words carefully. Losing her support right now would be disastrous, but if he played this right, he might even strengthen it.
“Yes. Happily, he was rather insistent on that point.” Mycroft didn’t try to contain his smile. “It’s very recent, but things have already become quite serious.”
“I can tell you the whole story now, but you’ll just have to sit through it again at the briefing. Bring the tree over, would you?”
“She seems a sensible choice.” Mycroft sighed. “Sherlock may need more time. He’s already got all the proof he needs, if he would just believe his own senses.”
“And I’ve made you a list.” He reached over, plucking a sheet of paper out of stack without looking. John looked at a list of names, all female, with contact information included. “I had Mycroft run the background checks. It’s all on here, saved under Nannies.”
good at finding them. It’s really quite impressive how quick he’s become. But I’ve heard enough bits and pieces to have some small reason for concern. For
“Yes.” John blinked as his vision clouded for an instant, then cleared. He looked at the girl in Greg’s arms and his eyes filled with sorrow at the thought that this beautiful, laughing child had been murdered by her own mother. She looked as solid as Mary did, but water dripped from her hair and clothes, a sad reminder she’d been drowned. “How long does it last? Is it permanent?”
givin’ blow jobs. How’s this: I’m gonna tell you exactly what I wanna do, and you tell me if that sounds like something you’d like.”
“You okay, Anthea?” Greg finally allowed himself to relax when the last team member still in the field returned.
when I…” Mycroft wasn’t used to struggling to find the words to speak. Usually, finding just the right words was one of his specialties. He sat up straighter and forced himself to meet Sherlock’s gaze. He knew he was treading on dangerous waters, conversationally. “Look, we both
At least it gave him an excuse. He glanced unhappily at the flash drive. He’d been planning on checking in personally with Sherlock soon anyway. His brother hadn’t noticed the pattern yet, but it was inevitable that he would. Mycroft could only hope that it wouldn’t drive him mad when he did.
“I’m trying. This sort of thing is very difficult for me. I’ve spent a lifetime building up my defenses. Letting them down is very counter-intuitive to me.” Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose, fighting off a headache of his own.
“Oh, God, Sherlock!” John’s body bucked wildly, seeking to pump himself into Sherlock’s hand while his hips thrust back, impaling his lover’s cock deep inside him. Waves of intense pleasure crashed into him, over and over, as Sherlock’s cock slid across his prostate, and he could feel his balls tightening as he wavered on the edge of a powerful double orgasm.
be. I admit I’m nervous, but I think that’s in great part because I’m not entirely sure I won’t embarrass myself by panicking. It
“Sir, I think there’s something you need to see.” Anthea stuck her head in the door to his office, trying not to smirk.
“It’s alright. It’s not your fault.” He put his own mobile away, and intertwined his fingers with Sherlock’s. “It’s not how I wanted to come out, but I’m not ashamed of it either. I love you, and I don’t care if the whole world knows.”
“She’s right, brother dear.” Sherlock burst into laughter. He’d never have to hear that particular boast from his brother again. “
“No! Of course I knew I liked women. But that sort of thing; it’s just a phase with some people, like that… emu thing.”
“I feel ridiculous. Must I?” Mycroft looked unhappily at his reflection in the mirror. He’d donned the black body-armor suit under no small amount of protest, mainly because Greg had been both insistent and still more than a little angry about that morning.
“And John? Are you sending him off too?” Greg knew the answer even as he asked the question. John wouldn’t abandon Sherlock any more than he would abandon Mycroft.
“Quite” A small smile flickered across Mycroft’s lips. “And Fenris… you can just refer to us by our first names. People don’t generally use both names in conversation.”
After much quibbling back-and-forth, John and Mary had finally settled on three candidates and arranged to interview them. John had to admit they were all much more promising than the last few nannies he’d interviewed. They were all out of his price range, but when he’d pointed that out, Mary had, very proudly, informed him that she was paying for it. She’d negotiated a salary for herself as well.
“It’s an herb, and yes. We’re going to perform a series of experiments designed to provide empirical data. Even magic
“Did Mycroft tell you what he and I discussed?” He knew his brother had done no such thing, but he suddenly wondered how John would react to the news.
“I know. I can tell how much he loves you, just by the way he looks at you. I hope one day somebody will look at me like you guys look at each other.”
“He distrusts humans and considering what I know of humanity, he’s not unwise to do so. He needed some assurance that I wouldn’t use my knowledge of the Fae against them. What happened… it’s my fault, not his. I took the oath too literally. I’m not used to factoring in my feelings, and the Fae are very empathic. I am… sorry, John.”
Fenris raced over to them as soon at the car cleared the gate, a small, damp child clinging to his back and laughing with glee. Mary followed along behind them with a large raven perched on her shoulder.
“Look, before we get into all… this,” Greg tossed the briefcase on the counter, bemused by Mycroft’s attempts to open a beer for him, and entirely unsurprised that it was his preferred brand. Seeing him in such a normal domestic setting seemed… surreal.
“Greg, I heard you, behind the skip today.” She looked at him sympathetically. “I know this line of work gets hard. The strain gets to everybody sometimes. I just think it might be best if you took a little time, maybe talk to someone…”
“Oh, Greg… yesss…”, he moaned. Waves of bliss traveled through his body as he writhed on the sheets, overwhelmed by pure, carnal pleasure. Greg kept it up for long, delicious minutes, until his own cock ached with need. When Mycroft was ready, arching into his touch and begging, he pulled his fingers out, kissing his way up his lover’s body. He pressed his cock against  Mycroft’s, leaning down to whisper in his ear.
“Yeah. Neither one of them is as invulnerable as they pretend to be.” He smiled softly. “We’re privileged, you and me. We get to see the things they hide from the rest of the world.”
“That would be… acceptable.” Mycroft found that he and his cock were both very curious to find out exactly what Fenris could do with his tongue. “Is it agreeable to you that Greg help… prepare you for me?”
“John!” Sherlock wheeled around as John’s gun clattered to the ground. Even with the speed spell, he was too late, and he watched in horror as Jim Moriarty tossed him off the roof. He raced over, striking a crushing blow to Moriarty’s larynx. It should have incapacitated him or even killed him. Instead, he backhanded Sherlock across the rooftop, sending him flying with inhuman strength. As Sherlock rose, murder in his eyes, Moriarty cleared his throat and laughed.
“So, I take it you liked it?” Sherlock grinned down at him, obviously more than a little pleased with himself. “I thought I’d broken you there, for a moment.”
John was slowly dragged from the land of dreams by a series of small sounds: the tapping of a keyboard, the soft mutterings of Sherlock’s voice, the quiet rustle of paper. He propped himself up on his elbows and peered sleepily at his lover. Sherlock was sitting up, computer perched on his lap and files stacked somewhat precariously on the nightstand.
one have this sort of conversation, anyway? Hello, John, do you think you might be going a bit mad? Oh, hello, and how’s your dead wife doing today?”
“You’ve been family to me for a long time, John. I mean, yes, we’ve got the sexy bits now, but at least I’m used to having someone in my life. Mycroft isn’t and now his house is filled with them. It seems… bizarre.”
“I’ll have to ask him, but I think he’ll agree… and I may have a source for getting a regular supply. Can any non-medium help? I’m sure John and Sherlock would, especially if it was to help Mary.”
“Yes.” A small smile curled at the corner of his lips. He was amused at the idea of his brother having a teen-ager around the house. “You must be Greg’s nephew, Tim.”
Their days were filled with mystery and adventure, their evenings with family, and their nights with passion in each other’s arms. It wasn’t quite the same as their old life, but they were happy.
“Because the fourteenth of July will be our three-month anniversary. Did you really think I wouldn’t realize that?”
“You give me too much credit. Once one has committed to a course of action, there’s no point in panicking.” Sherlock decided it would be best to get John’s focus off his worries. He sat down on the bed beside him, pulling him into a kiss. “What is it exactly that you find attractive about him?”
“…” Speechless, Mycroft ate another biscuit without really noticing until he finally tried to speak. He stuttered, took a sip of tea, and started again. “I have never in my life
“Yes, it does.” She smiled at him. “Almost as absurd as the idea of you feeding Inspector Lestrade a mouse.”
“What’s all this for then?” He stared down at the list. Other than some stereotypically arcanely-titled books, there was a long list of bizarre items. “Powdered
without saying the words. He rolled off him, gathering him into his arms for a kiss. Mycroft snuggled into him, marveling at how this man had changed his life so much in just one week. He’d thought himself content being alone, but now, looking back on his life, he saw how lonely he’d been. They lay there for a while, then rose to clean up and change the sheets.
