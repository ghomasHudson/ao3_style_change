“What’s the matter?” he asked, concerned.
“Thank you, Father.” Tony sat down beside his mother.
“He doesn’t have any issues!”

help you sleep. Good to know. Good night, my handsome prince.” Steve rolled over and went to sleep.
As the two super-soldiers were leaving, the hybrid turned to face Bruce, grinned again, and waved, then he turned back to his friend. “Steve? Can we have tuna for dinner?” he asked in a whisper.

“He slept in your room last night, right?” she asked.
“Thank you, Jarvis!” Queen Peggy rose from her throne. “If Your Highnesses will please follow me?” The three royals walked out, but Tony was stopped before he could follow them.
“Well, do you want to try going back to sleep? I can sing to you, if you want,” the man suggested. The kid nodded and lied back down.

“Thank you, but please call me Bucky,” he whispered.
“It’s very nice to meet you, Tony,” she said. She stepped back from the doorway so both of them could pass. Steve whispered in his ear for him to take his shoes off before entering. The house was modest and beautiful. The wood was bare and a fifties-style television rested on the corner of what Tony assumed was a living room.
She was silent for a second. “What
“Whatcha paintin’, Stevie?”
And a jug of milk.
Bucky was back in a few minutes, and walked in to see Steve with a brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other. As soon as it was switched on, the brunet hissed and started batting at the hot air.

“Here you go, Boss. ‘I don’t remember. Hydra never used anesthesia when they would perform surgery on me, so I passed out from the pain. And they would put me through mind wipes after every mission, and every time their

“What if she bites me?!” Tony sounded slightly panicked.
“Buck, we had that for dinner, remember?”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Really, just take a fucking nap. I’ll wake you up when we get there.”
“Hey. It’s ok!” Hydra’s former assassin soothed. “You’re safe, Little Kitty. Shhhh. Everything’s alright. What happened?”
“You keep the experiment in the basement?” he asked.
“We need to keep him close. I don’t want him out of my sight.”
…so horribly, hybrid or not. He walked into his bedroom and put his gear on the bed. After taking a shower and grabbing a sketchbook and pencil, the captain went into the living room to sit down and draw for a while. Walking in, he saw the other two men laying on the couch, fast asleep and cuddling. He smiled, then leaned over to cover them with the blanket that was on the back of the couch. He sat in the couch across from the one that the genius and hybrid were on and began to draw. When the super-soldier was almost done, there was a noise from the other couch.
“Then make sure you don’t get caught.” He slipped the agent a wad of cash, roughly five thousand dollars, then turned back to the kid and bent down to his level.

“I’m sorry, Buck, but you don’t have a choice.” Steve started stripping the feline of his clothes, trying not to cry at the sight of the bullet wounds and scars all over his torso and back.
The man known as Iron Man was quiet for a few seconds. “I’ll help you explain things to Bruce, but I have conditions to Bucky living in the Tower.”

“I swear, Stark, one more word out of you, and I’ll…”
“Yeah, he’s an amazing guy. He’s helped me since the first day we met. You sure raised him right, Sarah.”
“Tony!” Steve interrupted, removing his arm from around the other man and sitting up. “You’re welcome. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Your Highness, I have chores to see to this morning. You’re welcome to stay here and go back to sleep, or do so back in your own bed. Either way, I’ll see you this afternoon for your lessons.”
“Maybe… Thanks, Natasha. Stay safe!”
“Thank you!”

“Careful, Bucky. I was stabbed there,” Steve winced when one of the feline’s arms pressed too hard against his side.
“Ok. I pulled out a set of pajamas for you. Go put them on and come back here. We need to dry your hair.”
“Are you making fun of my height, Rogers?”
“That’s fine. Steve, make sure Bucky doesn’t have anything to eat or drink after midnight tonight, ok?” Steve nodded just as the hybrid was waking up.

“Well, maybe she’s changed. It happens.”
After grooming the king’s horse, Tess, a dark chocolate brown mare with a black mane and tail, the riding instructor got to work grooming Lightning, Arrow, Patriot, and Falcon, the knights' horses. No one had ever seen such fast and agile horses. The knights hadn’t known that when they picked the little foals to be theirs, or that all of them had picked horses from the same breed. They were tall, honey-colored horses with manes almost the same color, except for Patriot, who had a series of dark brown star-shaped freckles on its right hip. Soon, Steve came back to the prince’s side. “All finished?”
“You know who I am. Where are the experiments?”
“Sorry. Where’s Cap?”

After lunch, the royal went back to the stables for his afternoon lesson.
“Call me Tony, please.” They shook hands. “I’ve heard a lot about you, Princess.”
“Stay close to me, okay?” he asked, before grabbing an umbrella to keep them dry from the rain.
“Rest a little…” Steve said before going back to the pilot’s seat. “Please?”
“Did you…know about it?” the royal asked, without looking up.
. Did. You. Do?”
“Fine!” The young royal turned around and stormed out of the castle.
Bruce blinked and his eyes turned from their usual golden-brown color to green. “Give me a minute,” he growled before turning and walking away.
“I’m fine. I should be over it by now.”
Tony sighed, but dropped the subject. He took the garment from Happy and went to bathe. Soon, he was ready, and, after putting a pack of cigarettes and a lighter into his pocket, made the long walk to the throne room on the other side of the castle, where his parents were waiting.
Steve helped him down, since America was such a large horse. Tony said a quiet “thanks”. The blond tied the horses to one of the fences so they couldn’t run away, despite being well-disciplined, but it was better to be safe than sorry. The prince reached out for his instructor’s hand, intertwining their fingers before the blonde could knock on the door. “Stevie, is that you?” A woman’s voice called from inside as soon as Steve knocked. It was possible to hear the sound of the door unlocking, what made the royal wonder how thin the walls were.
Tony hesitated, as if he

“What? What’s Buckitty want?” the business owner asked, and got twin glares in return.
“Happy birthday, Your Highness!” His Royal Highness, Prince Anthony of The House of Stark was woken on the morning of his twentieth birthday by his family’s butler, Edwin Jarvis, throwing back the curtains around his bed, letting in the blinding morning sunlight, and his attendant, Harold “Happy” Hogan, speaking loudly.

“Whatever, I am going to sleep,” Tony said grumpily, pressing the elevator buttons with rage.
Tony was confused, but agreed. “Ok. I’ll be there soon.”
“I’m sorry, JR. But you don’t need to worry. You’re going someplace where you’ll be safe and happy. We’re going to take really good care of you. I promise!” JR nodded, still looking a little sad from having to talk about Grampa Stan, but suddenly perked up. The jet!
“Oh. But...what about the bird?”
“Who’s flying the plane?!” The business owner sounded panicked.
…” Steve was cut off from his rambling by the royal kissing him on the lips.
“I know, sweetheart.” She put a hand on the prince’s face, stroking his cheek with her thumb. “You are so handsome,” she told Tony. Steve tried to intervene but she ignored him. “You look so much like your father.”
As Tony watched, Steve blinked awake.

When he got to Steve’s location, he didn’t see the captain at first (‘
“What? Are you jealous?”
“I’d like Bucky to live in the Tower with the team. I’d also like you to help me explain things to Doctor Banner. At the very least, Bucky needs a check-up to make sure he’s healthy. I don’t trust any of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s doctors. Doctor Banner isn’t a medical doctor, but he’s the closest thing the team has, and I do trust him. Plus, he

They traveled for hours and hours. When they arrived, it was already late at night. Peter yawned over his horse. The guards almost stopped the boy from getting inside until the prince said the kid was his guest. As the prince dismounted from his horse, he saw the family reeve stomping toward him.
“Of course! I’ll wait as long as I need to.” Tony smiled.

are Bucky-sitting.” Both men opened their mouths to argue. “That’s an order!” He moved the feline off his lap. “Now, if you will both excuse me, I have to go pack and make sure everything is ready to go. I’ll be back as soon as I can. Try not to kill each other while I’m gone.”
The genius stretched and yawned, then looked at his worktable. Still laying on the corner was the letter Bucky had written to him that morning. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., translate this for me.”
“I see. Well…” the nurse was interrupted by a knock on the door. Bruce had come back, this time looking a lot calmer than he had earlier.
’ As he reached his hand forward to grab a screwdriver and fix the elbow joint that keep falling off the main structure, he heard beeps behind him. Bucky turned just in time to see Steve open the door and walk in.
“I thought there would be a second bed. I can’t take your bed, Steve!” He started to go back downstairs to ask Sarah if she would mind if he slept in their barn.
“Thank you for catching me.”
“It isn’t safe. That’s why you and Tony are staying here while the rest of us deal with Hydra.”
Приди, котя, ночевать,
Bruce, not the Hulk, right? Why would...? Are you hurt?”
“So, what’s his name?”
“You don’t have to do them with me. Actually, Ma might yell at me if I let you.”
The other man shook his head. “Я не помню. Гидра никогда не применяла анестезию, когда они выполняли операцию на мне, поэтому я потерял сознание от боли. И после каждой миссии они вытащили меня через салфетки и каждый раз, когда их
Soon, the elevator stopped and the doors opened. When the two men exited, they saw Tony and another man standing in a room across the hall, deep in discussion. “Is that the doctor?” Bucky asked, whispering so that only Steve could hear him. The genius and the doctor both turned at the sound of the two super-soldiers approaching.
“Fine,” he grumbled. Tony closed his eyes. Just as he was about to fall asleep, JR woke up from his nap with a startled gasp, bolting up into a sitting position.
“Котя, котенька, коток…”
“Stark, you can't do that!” Director Ross said firmly.
“Will you be sleeping with me tonight?” Steve asked, grabbing his hand.
“He said that?”
“Ok,” he admitted. “
“Ok, kiddo. We need to look for a jet, an airplane. Do you know what an airplane looks like?” JR nodded.
“Yeah, Capsicle.” The man stood up and walked over to them. “Buckitty is just fine. I have something to tell you two. I was talking to him about his new arm, and I said that we’d have to figure out how the arm he has now was attached. He said that he doesn’t remember because he passed out from the pain. Hydra, who I will now refer to as ‘

“You think I don’t know my own son, Prince Stark?” Tony flinched. He hated hearing his father’s name being used to refer to him.
run screaming when he sees Bucky.”
“Flying the plane,” Bruce said. The billionaire turned, surprised.
“That’s great, Bucky!” Steve said. “I’ll make whatever you want for dinner to celebrate, and to welcome you to your new home. But, for right now, we should go see Tony. We’ll see you later, Bruce.”
big of a deal to them,
“Yeah, Buck?” The blond turned from unlocking the front door to see his childhood friend trying to hide in the shadows, and his tail, which he had been hiding in the back of his hoodie, was dragging on the ground. ‘
“I’m sorry. Do you want to talk about it?”
The genius sighed. “Oh, Bucky… My anger is at
Tony whimpered, still scared. “I don’t want to learn to ride, but my father says I have to if I’m going to be king. I’m just so afraid!” He started crying softly.
After working on it for another three days, he was exhausted, but finally finished. The arm was

“No, I’m fine. I’m just...I need your help, Tony. Please.” The billionaire paused in typing the code to get to his latest Iron Man suit. It was rare for Steve to use his first name, and if he was doing it now, then it was important.
“He’s a little boy, a
“Pep, get a guest room ready for Peter, and arrange a meeting with Doctor Banner tomorrow morning.”
“But you’re not!” Steve held Tony tightly, his hand playing with the hair on the prince's neck. “It was mean of them to make you have these classes when you didn’t want to.”
“Go lie down. On your back, please.” Once Steve did as the prince asked, Tony got in the bed, too, from the other side, and lay so he was on his side, with his head on the blond’s chest and his arms and one leg around the other man. He untangled himself for a second to grab the blanket, then got right back into his previous position. “Comfortable? Warm enough?” he asked.
“We both know I can’t do that.” He felt that annoying headache in the center of his forehead. Bucky reached forward, pulled down him onto the bench, and placed a kiss right on top of the spot that Tony’s hands previously were, trying to soothe the pain.
“Can I sleep with you?”
Pussy, little kitty,

As he was finishing emptying the first bag, he heard his instructor’s voice. “Come on, Rose. Come on, girl,” the man spoke softly to a yellowish tan-colored horse, who had a white stripe down her nose and a white mane. ‘
The hybrid let go of his tail. “Ok. Let’s go see the doctor.”
’ He looked down at his project and frowned. The elbow was fixed, but he saw the same problem he‘d had all day.
The royal paused for a second. “Let me think about it while we get ready for bed.” The riding instructor nodded. A few minutes later, Tony had a solution that he was almost positive would work.
“You’re welcome. Anything for Prince Tony...the Tiny,” the riding instructor teased. Tony glared.

’ “Great! While you’re doing that, I’m going to groom them. Shout if you need me, ok?” The prince nodded again and got to work.

“You two going already?” Sarah asked a few hours later, when she saw Steve packing his things.
“Yes, you fixed the elbow. Congratulations,” the genius said sarcastically. “But you fucked up something else on your new arm which I now have to go back and fix, which will take me even longer than if you hadn’t done anything.” He pulled the arm out from behind his back. Steve burst out laughing when he saw the fist flipping Bucky off. “
The captain unlocked the door and headed for the lobby elevator. “F.R.I.D.A.Y.?” he said, looking at the left-hand corner of the ceiling. “This is my friend, Sergeant Barnes. He’s going to be living here in the Tower from now on. Could you please add him to your list of approved people, and help him with whatever he needs?”
“Taking care of other people's lives is, too.” Tony turned and saw a muscular young man, with blond hair, behind him. “Are you Steve?”
’ He tried to sit up to look around, but found himself pinned to the bed by somebody’s arm. The prince looked over to find the source of his immobility. ‘
“Yeah, Capsicle. Mission complete! Turns out you were right. They
“She...she’s not my friend, Steve. Just because I’m a prince, that doesn’t mean I’m always surrounded by friends. Well, that depends on what you define as ‘friends’.”

“Get your things ready, Anthony, we are traveling this evening,” the king said harshly.
“I know. Your mom told me,” Tony whispered back, having woken up when he heard the other man’s voice.
“Hello, Mummy!” He said, kissing her cheek. “Father.”
“Yes, please! Thank you, F.R.I.D.A.Y.!”
“I hate to see you sad,” the hybrid whispered, pulling Tony closer to him. The genius let his head rest against the other man’s shoulder. “Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?”
you want to come with me?” The prince hesitated for a second then nodded. ‘
“Right. Now, tell me what’s going on.” Bucky sighed.
“Yes, Captain.”
“See you, Steve! Bye, Bucky!”
Steve grinned and both men finally got onto the elevator. “Could you take us to Doctor Banner’s lab, please?” he asked. “I think he’s expecting us.”
“He won’t kill you. I promise. Come here.” Steve grabbed the horse’s reins with one hand and Tony’s hand with his other hand. Slowly, he put the prince’s hand on the horse’s mane and moved it in a petting motion. “Yes, horses are big, but they’re gentle creatures. They won’t hurt you if you don’t hurt them.”
Tony’s father spoke for his wife. “As you know, in our kingdom, a prince is eligible to be king on his twenty-first birthday. Which means that you will be in line for the throne next year. As king, it will be your duty to journey to other kingdoms to forge alliances and aid them in times of war, as they will do for you. There will be times when you will be expected to ride a horse...without having a fit of terror, so we’ve hired an instructor by the name of Steve Rogers to teach you. He’ll be here soon. Go wait in the stables for him.” The king picked up his Starkpad and turned it back on, clearly dismissing his son.
’ “Alright. I’ll meet you at the stables in an hour. Wear something...I’m not even sure if you have anything like this, but wear something casual. Something that you won’t care if you get dirty. And work boots, if you have any. But nothing fancy!”
“You’re forgiven. But next time, ask before you try to fix anything, ok? And maybe don’t give me anything dead as a present, yeah? And also stay away from my clothes, maybe?” He petted the super-soldier on the head before turning to the new arm. “We just have to figure out how the arm you have now was attached. Any chance they might have told you?”
“She won’t.”

punished. So, now, he’s only been speaking to me because he knows I won’t hurt him, and he either waits until we’re alone, or, if other people are around and he has no choice, in whispers. And Hydra wiped his memory for years and years, so there are... gaps.”
The feline knew he wouldn’t be falling back asleep any time soon, so he decided to see where the mechanic spent most of his time. The elevator was fairly easy to use, but unfortunately his passcode, which was supposed to work on every door in the tower, did not work to open the workshop’s door. After several failed attempts, he decided to just tap on the glass doors until the genius let him in. Tony didn’t notice at first, the glass was soundproof after all. Just as he was about to go back to his room, the door unlocked, and the hybrid happily skipped over to the genius’s left side, but the other man
“H...horse. Big. Scared.” Tony stuttered.
As soon as Tony turned around, Steve Rogers saw that the person he had been speaking to was the prince. He quickly dismounted from the horse he had been riding and knelt, his whole face turning red in shame.
“I’m not interested in her, Steve, or really women in general. Especially after last night.” The blond man frowned. “They were all boring and gossipy, and…the only reason I slept with Christine is because she‘s always been able to distract me from my loneliness.” Tony sighed. “I wanted you to come with me, but my father wouldn’t allow it. I asked.”
did he say to you?”
work for Hydra.” There was a moment of quiet in the room.
“Ma, I was planning to tell you...” her son tried to defend himself.
“May I wash your hair?” the captain asked softly.
When Tony woke up the next morning, he was very confused. ‘
Steve blinked. “You are...
“Of course! But I have to go now. Bye!”
Steve grabbed a shower cap with flowers all  over it and a pair of scissors. He placed the cap on Bucky’s head and carefully cut it so that it only covered his cat ears.
“Capsicle found Bucky when he was on his run. We’d like you to give him a check-up.”
“It’s okay, Mom. We already ate.”
“He called me an izvinyayus!” ‘
“I’m trying to sleep, Buck.”
get here?”
“Ouch! I think I hurt my leg,” the prince complained when he tried to put weight on his left foot. “Can you help me back to the castle?”
She wrote down that information on a notepad that she had taken out of her pants-pocket. “Thank you, Captain. May I ask why
The blond shook his head and the stranger lifted their chin. “This is Bucky. Apparently Hydra gave him something when they kidnapped him so that he was able to survive the fall. They had him this whole time. They gave him a new arm to replace the one he lost when he fell, and gave him...well, not exactly the same serum that Dr. Erskine gave me...but as close as they could get, then wiped his memory and stuffed their Winter Soldier programming into him. And
After that- well- the rest was history.
Okay, so Tony didn’t want to go any further in the details. Fair enough. Steve shut his mouth and nodded in understanding. “Sorry.”
It beeped once, twice, three times. Then- “Steve?”
There was a pause in the room, long and heavy. Steve couldn’t look at the other man. Too scared. Too cowardly.
He shook his head and just smiled, despite the nagging his friends subjected him to in order to try and make him spill. He couldn’t explain it without them wondering
There was a short silence, the three men all staring at one another. Steve swallowed down the panic and tried to focus, but all he could see was the way Tony had looked when he’d gone down earlier in the fight. He’d been too far away and Steve had been too preoccupied with fending off three different attackers, and so he hadn’t even been able to call out to him. He could only watch, horror-stricken as the bomb had gone off, and then listen to Tony’s following scream.
Bucky flailed his hands around a little, cheeks going slightly pink. “I wanted it to be a surprise, asshole! I was… I mean- you were gonna be miles away, and I didn’t wanna have to rely on the shitty train times to decide when I got to see you, and I don’t know- what if there was some emergency and you needed me and… yeah,” Bucky shrugged, patting the dashboard, “so I was planning to get a car soon as I heard you were moving. Granted, I was kinda hoping to be able to save up for a slightly better model- but alcohol and Natasha both persuaded me this one was fine, so here I am. Coming to take you to school!”
With a deep sigh, he turned around. Carol had said room eight. He assumed that was somewhere down the science corridor, which wasn’t so bad. Thirty seconds away, tops. In and out. Didn’t even have to look at him, if he didn’t want to.
It wasn’t even something he needed to consider.
“Clint came down the stairs and you looked like you were literally about to be murdered, so you launched yourself across the table and kissed me like it was the last time you ever would, and of course that was enough to persuade me to defend you from the oncoming wrath of Barton when he discovered his favourite box of cereal in the trash.”
“Obviously not, they’re not nearly as trustworthy,” Tony muttered, just before a second little staticky noise and the sound of a distant voice behind him
“So you’re a PI,” Tony muttered encouragingly, his eyes burning holes into the side of Steve’s face as he pulled out an antiseptic wipe. “How did that—sorry, this’ll sting— how did that end up with you turning up at my house then?”
He just shrugged, picking at a hangnail to try and find something to do with his hands. “Well. You don’t want to be- y’know- seen with me? Around your richer friends. Which is… I
Steve couldn’t say he’d ever experienced it before, no- but he knew what it looked like, and it looked like Tony. If the stumbling around didn’t give it away immediately, then the red-rimmed eyes and faded smile stuck to his face sure did. Tony was gone- completely fucking gone.
“You do.” Steve looked down at him for a second, tongue running over his bottom lip, until he blinked and then held up the wet cloth, seemingly attempting to come back to himself. “We should clean up.”
Okay. Point. Tony rolled his eyes and let his head drop, Steve’s warmth seeping through his bones, relaxing his muscles. He pushed his thumb lightly into Steve’s wrist, starting up another count. They were firm and true, and the steadily-climbing number helped give him something to focus on that wasn’t… everything else.
“That won’t work,” Reed told him, and the words split through whatever modicum of determined hope Steve had been holding onto, damning him to hell, “Steve, I’m so sorry—”
They were both sat on the grass outside the tiny barn Steve had rented, a blanket under their backs as they stared up into the blissfully clear skies.
He thought of none of it now. There was just this.
“What? Steve, don’t be ridiculous.” Tony’s back straightened as if mentally preparing himself for something. “You’re staying with me.”
, because the last thing he remembered was telling Tony to stay away, then lunging… lunging with the intent to kill.
He took Tony’s hand, and a second later Rhodey took his other. Tony looked between them, the laughter petering out.
Losing Iron Man wasn’t just irritating. Losing Iron Man was going to risk his position on the team.
“Tony,” he whispered, like saying his lover's name would bring him back. He sank to the floor, still holding to the piece of sink that he’d ripped off the wall. “Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony…”
he should have started running.
Steve took two steps forward and turned, positioning himself in front of Tony and grabbing the man’s shoulders so that he could spin him around. This wouldn’t take long. But in his last moments, he wanted it to be Tony’s face he saw.
He wouldn’t be able to stop this even if he wanted to.
to view it. He felt like he owed it to the boy three floors above him, even if Peter wasn’t even aware of anything that was going on. Someone had to watch this happen and care about it. No one else who’d been seeing this ever had.
“Hey, Steve,” Tony answered the phone after two rings, and Steve found himself smiling tiredly at the sound of Tony’s voice alone.
think of you as expendable. Not in a million years.” He looked at Tony with a sad smile, before looking back down into his lap again. “But like I said- if you don’t reciprocate, that’s completely… I understand, we can just-“
The receptionist paled as he looked down at the letter, barely even reading it. Any threat of a lawsuit—especially one from a man as rich and powerful as Tony Stark—was enough to make any bored nightshift agent cower. He nodded weakly and waved a hand. “Uh, okay. You should… you should probably go through then.”
“Well, clearly social services is off the table for now until we expend all other options,” Bruce said, looking around the room, but Natasha and Steve both frowned, glancing at one another.
“That looked like my face,” Tony peered down at him, a small little crease forming on his forehead that made him look adorably confused, “did you draw me?” And it seemed a second later he worked out the answer to his own question, because his eyes widened and his hand curled around Steve’s wrist. “Oh my God, you did, didn’t you?”
By the time Tony had come to the end of the piece, Steve was slumped bonelessly into the couch, watching Tony through his tired eyes and trying to tamp down on what he knew was probably a ridiculously large smile. Tony glanced over at him, his hands falling into his lap, and when he took in Steve’s relaxed position, his eyes twinkled. “Really does it for you, huh?” He said cheekily, trailing his fingers absently over the keys and playing a quick tune.
On the other side of the room, Natasha briefly turned away from Spanish Peppa Pig and pulled a face. “I’m sure we have done this before,” she said, but Clint threw a pillow at her and told her to shut the fuck up, so she just shrugged and turned back around.
He blinked into his pillow, frowning at the incessant beeping noise coming from his right. It took a fraction of a second for the tone to register, and then he was upright in a flash, grabbing the phone while his finger simultaneously slid over the answer button. He was used to going from asleep to battle-ready by this point. Came with the job. “Captain Rogers,” he said, voice clipped and a little croaky—he
“Yeah,” Rhodey breathed out a big sigh, “yeah, I think… listen, I don’t wanna start making random diagnoses here, and I’m not a trained professional, but Tony hasn’t been to see one of those in years, and this is- it looks like it. It always has, to me. My dad, he, uh, he served. Sometimes the same things would happen to him.”
“Oh, actually me and Steve already-“
Tony thought viciously as he grabbed a bolt from where it had almost rolled off the desk. Steve had boundaries and Tony hadn’t respected them. Steve had feelings, and Tony had hurt them. Tony didn’t blame him- he’d punch himself too, if he was in his own company for more than three minutes. The fact Steve had been doing it close to three years was incredible.
“You fucking fool.”
Wishful thinking, but nice all the same.
“And you’re rather drunk,” Steve plucked the cigarette from Tony’s mouth once he reached him, stepping on it before Tony could even complain, “you need to go home, Tony.”
“Who initiated?” Clint got straight to the point, rolling onto his bed and looking at him from upside-down, “it was Tony, wasn’t it? Was he a good kisser? What base did you g-“
Tony blinked up at him and frowned. “That’s not why I invited you over,” he said grumpily.
There was just him, and Tony, and the ledge that was seconds from falling away.
Yeah, there it was. The kicker. He knew, of course, that the way he’d handled the entire thing had been pathetic. It just… it still felt like a stab in the chest to realise the others thought so too. That they knew there were a hundred things he could have done, but never did. He licked his lips and turned back around, ducking his head. On the first day, when he’d just woken up, the whole team had watched as he’d cried nonstop for fucking hours, but he hadn’t shed a tear since he’d found out what had really been going on, and he didn’t intend to start again now. Because it wasn’t worth crying about, not any more. Hell, it hadn’t been worth crying over to
Sam folded his arms and walked back to them slowly, before landing right behind Steve. “Is there a problem here?”  He asked warily.
So, once he’d gotten some of the chores for the day done, he grabbed his sketchbook and a couple of pencils, and then made his way down to Tony’s lab. The doors slid open for him fluidly, and it took a moment or two for him to locate the other man in the mess that was his workshop. Eventually however, he spotted two sneakers poking out from underneath a huge device that was emanating a low humming frequency into the room, and Steve cocked his head at it curiously as he took it in. This was obviously Tony’s big project, then.
Steve whispers hoarsely, pushing the bottle of pills carelessly off the side of the desk and then crouching down, his arms trapping Tony in his chair, “please don’t do that, Tony. Please. I’m… I couldn’t deal with losing you too-”
“Sorry,” Steve muttered, “just a nightmare. Get ‘em sometimes.”
He smiled up at the other man—the one he’d loved and lost, then found again. This time, he wasn’t going to let him go for anything. Not the government, not SHIELD or HYDRA or whatever tried to come up against them. He knew the truth now. He knew Tony for the hero he was.
Tony, who Steve loved more than anyone else. Who had always, always trusted Steve without hesitation; who’d fallen countless times into Steve’s arms with no worry about Steve hurting him with his strength, knowing and understanding that Steve was powerful enough to do whatever he wanted, but believing that Steve never would.
“We’re going to google him like stalkers,” Bucky clarified, then dodged a smack around the head from Peggy.
Steve didn’t flinch. “I’m not afraid of ‘people like you’,” he said bluntly, “I never have been.”
Silent tears slipped down his cheeks, and he kept his eyes fixed to the ground as he shook his head.
He carried on for a few more steps until he felt Tony twist around, stepping in front of him and cutting him off. He bumped into the other boy’s chest in surprise and looked up just in time to meet Tony’s mouth in the middle as he leaned down, capturing him in a short, sharp kiss.
He was so perfect. Even though bruises mottled the side of his face, and stitches ran along the top of his shoulder. Even though he could be the most stubborn bastard on heaven and earth, or the
and you didn’t even like me enough to feel jealous. God, I suck at this,” the royal muttered to himself.
“I can’t, Sir. I’ll be fired.”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y., call Natasha.” After a few seconds, the red-head answered.
I have to stay with Buckitty,” the genius requested, finally making his presence known.
After several hours, the prince looked up from his book and saw the sun starting to raise behind a faraway mountain. ‘
Femalemarvelfanatic and M1das thought it would be fun to have a little game at the end of this chapter. Since we never mention who the knights are, we want you to guess who they are, and tell us which horse belongs to which knight. The first person to get them all correct will get a cameo in the next chapter!
“We’re just talking about the plan for your new arm,” Tony said. “We think it would be best if you had one last surgery to detach the arm that fucking Hydra gave you, then reattach the one I made.”
“It’s ok. You were busy with your friend.”
“It is not difficult at all, Your Highness,” Jarvis said, patiently. “It is just improper. You are a royal, and our superior. Calling you by a shortened version of your given name would be disrespectful, not only to you, but also to the King and Queen, who spent many months searching for a name befitting of their adopted son and heir, since your birth mother, Maria, died before she could name you.” Happy nodded, agreeing with Jarvis.
for what they forced you to go through. It isn’t your fault. Nothing that’s happened to you because of Hydra has ever been your fault.” He was cut off from saying anything more by Steve and Bruce entering the room.
is why I was having stress! You were able to attach the elbow.
Bucky stepped out from under the umbrella and walked a few yards away from his friend, his eyes never leaving a nearby tree where a small group of pigeons were sitting and chirping to each other. One bird turned its head, looked directly at the hybrid, and let out a short series of chirps. In response, he made a noise that, to Steve, sounded like a cat
“No, I’m ok. Just a little sore, but ok,” Tony said, straightening his shirt. “Although it’s quite nice having your arms around me.”
“It’s alright, Mrs. Rogers. You didn’t know. And Steve helped me. No big deal.”
“It’s a bath squirter. You squeeze its sides, then put it under the water and let go so that water gets sucked inside. Then pull it out of the water and squeeze the sides again so that it squirts out water. Wanna try, Buck?” The feline grinned and spent the next hour spraying Steve with water, giggling happily the whole time. Eventually the captain said that it was time to get out of the bathtub. He wrapped a towel around the hybrid’s waist, then picked up another towel to carefully dry his cat ears and tail.
He dropped his umbrella, quickly walked over, stanched up the hat, ran to the super-soldier, who was crouched on the ground, and crammed it on Bucky’s head before anyone could see the cat ears.
Уж как я тебе, коту,
“Tony, your father wants to see you. He’s in the library. I’m far too busy making sure this castle runs smoothly, and on schedule, to be the king’s messenger, but I was the first person he saw with a communicator. I’ll never understand why kings aren’t required to wear them like everybody else. I’m coming to get you. Stay where you are. There are some things I need to talk to you about on our way to the castle,” and without letting Tony answer, she ended the call with a “goodbye”.
“Hi, Steve!”
“Steven! Tony is our guest! You never make a guest do any work! I raised you better than that!” She took the plates out of the prince’s hand and gave them to her son. “Now, you do the cleaning up and set up for the surprise party you think I don’t know about, while
“Good!” Tony said, sitting up.
“Tony, do you know what time it is?” Pepper complained, but it was understandable. “You’ve been gone for almost three nights! Queen Peggy has been so worried about you that she’s refused to sleep! She sent out search parties to look for you from the moment she found out you were gone, and even threatened to leave your father because he kicked you out! She went to get some rest after she got word that you were home.”
За работу заплачу –
“What’s wrong?” The silence went on for so long that Tony was sure the blond had hung up on him.
“Good morning, Your Highness! You are very lucky that I came in, instead of Jarvis or Their Majesties, otherwise there would be questions about your whereabouts. Now, what would you like to wear today, Prince Anthony?” The prince’s attendant crossed to the wardrobe.
Steve sighed in annoyance. “Come on, Stark. Answer your damn phone,” he muttered to himself, until finally the other man answered.
“Did you make
“We’ll take him to post-op, if you allow,” a nurse asked.
“Why didn’t you tell me?!”
. But that isn’t really important right now, since you’ll just be staying on my floor with me for a while. As for this doctor being like the ones at Hydra... he isn’t. I promise you, he’s
“Excellent! Your father and I are expecting guests, and we want you there to greet them. Come to the throne room as soon as you can,” the queen said.
“For now. Hopefully Laura will let us stay for a while. At least long enough for us to come up with a plan to protect this adorable little kitty-cat. Who doesn’t seem to like heights very much.” He turned to the child, who was whimpering in fear and holding on for dear life. They were
“You wouldn’t,” he mumbled.
“Bucky, stop,” the blond said, using his “I am the Captain, and you
’ he thought. He grabbed the thick and heavy book off the shelf and settled down into an armchair to read.
“Yes, Sir! Happy birthday!” Jarvis said in a softer tone. The prince groaned in response and rolled over, trying to go back to sleep. “I do apologize, Your Highness, but you cannot go back to sleep right now. Their Majesties are waiting for you in the throne room.”
“Because if Hydra decides to take advantage of our not being home to get their so-called weapon back, someone needs to stay here and help Bucky.”
“It’s time to go, Buck!”
“If you don’t stop, you’ll knock it out of my hand, and then your hair will stay wet, and you’ll get sick. Is that what you want?” The hybrid shook his head. “Alright, then hold still.”
The royal nodded immediately. “Of course I do!”
take them out to the paddock to get some fresh air and exercise. Once they’re outside, we’ll have to muck out every stall,” the blond said.
“Not at all, pr...Tony.” He seemed uncomfortable. “Friday is a very well behaved horse. I trained her myself!”
“Him,” he corrected. “It was mean of him to make me do this. It was my father who insisted on it.”

“Wow… You get
calling you a dumbass!” ‘
!” Tony growled, and pushed the prosthetic middle finger into the soldier’s face. “
“I can be. Eight in the morning?”
“Hello to you, too,” the former Hydra assassin said grumpily, but took the child, who immediately became fascinated by the man’s cat ears that were so similar to his own. Tony rolled his eyes as the suit slowly went back to the place it was housed on his chest.
“Just some freak that we rescued when we were taking down A.I.M. I’m sorry you had to see him, Captain. We’ll make sure he doesn’t bother you again.” The captain had to take a deep breath to control his temper and not say something that he would (not) regret.
“I’m not sleeping.”
“Is everything alright? The anesthesiologist will come in a second,” he said before leaving. Steve nodded then comforted Bucky, petting his ears. A few minutes later, he was taken to the operating room, which had a theater for people to watch the procedure. Tony hands were shaking. He could feel Steve’s glare from the gallery.
“Are you sure? I don’t mind helping you.” Tony nodded. “Alright. I’ll see you tomorrow, then.”
’ he thought, happy that he had managed to stay awake all night and not dream about the past. Standing up from his chair, the prince stretched, then grabbed the empty mead pitcher and walked back to his room to get ready for his morning lessons with his very handsome riding instructor.
He could still see the look on her face, even now. He didn’t think he was ever going to forget it. But he recited the words that his therapist had told him, when he’d spoken to her about on the phone that night, his voice quiet and broken as he’d huddled in the corner of the room and asked himself whether he could even recognize himself any more. “Trauma does things to people, Tony. Bad things. Your mind is physically altered by what happened, and it changes you. Does that make you a bad person? No. But it makes you a person who needs help and support to try and change. I got therapy, Tony. I talked to my friends about it.” He stepped forward, moving over to Tony’s side and winding their fingers together. “You need to talk to me, sweetheart. Don’t push me out and try to handle the situation yourself. It’ll get my back up, and we’ll end up in the situation that we were in a few hours ago, with you giving me orders that I can’t follow and me getting angry over it.”
Steve waggled a finger in his direction. “That’s your plotting face.”
“Steve, tell me what’s wrong,” Tony asked softly, putting a hand up and pressing it against Steve’s jaw. He was worried- really fucking worried- and was briefly debating whether to get Thor to take Steve down to medical when the blond just shook his head, smiling stiffly.
Sometimes he looked back a few months, and realised quite how far he’d come since then. It was… it was good. To think about the progress. His mom would be happy with that, he knew. She’d always wanted him to make more friends, and, well, here he was now, surrounded by them.
“But Peter- there is not, and nor will there
“Thank you,” he murmured, sounding like a broken record, but it was all he knew, it was all he could think. Tony had found this. Steve hadn’t got the faintest idea how, but he’d got this and he’d done it all for Steve.
“Should’ve tried to knock some sense into him,” Steve mumbled, “or, failing that, just knocked him.”
“Thoughts on me dressing up as a playboy bunny for Halloween tomorrow?” Tony asked with a raised eyebrow, pulling away for a second to gauge Steve’s reaction. “I have been told I look good in rabbit ears.”
He would do anything to try and stop that from happening to them.
They cared. For whatever reason, they… they really did.
Eventually, it stopped being a joke.
As he stood up to put his bowl in the sink, he looked down just in time to see Sam’s hand wrapping around his bony elbow.
“In your dad’s stories about me, did he ever mention the Howling Commandos, or my best friend?”
“He’s downright precious. I’ll do the check-up later. What about my house in India?”
A small pause. “Correct.”
“52 beats per minute, sir,” JARVIS informed him, voice quiet, “a little more elevated than when you last checked, due to the fact he just had a cup of coffee.”
Fuck, he needed to sleep. His jokes were getting downright shitty, and that just wasn’t good enough.
Steve frowned, about to snap something back- but Tony just shut his eyes and palmed at his head weakly. Even his hair looked a little droopier. "Fucking hate the comedown," he muttered to himself, taking in a slightly shaking breath of air.
It’s not.
“So you
“Sorry,” he blurted, suddenly feeling all the eyes turn to him. He felt as if they were judging him. Would they talk about him once he left? Probably. He’d been acting weird lately and he knew it. “I just had a really fucking good idea. I gotta shoot off and make a few calls, see if I can bring it to life.”
And sure, Steve was probably going to break up with him imminently, which Tony was very pointedly not thinking about via distracting himself with this, but even if he did, Tony wasn’t going to just discard this idea. Whether Steve loved him or hated him, he didn’t deserve the treatment he got. No one fucking did.
“Well, for starters, one of them just melted straight through the reinforced doors.” Tony put more thrust into the repulsors. “We need to keep the ones remaining outside focused on SHIELD and not the surrounding buildings. Those civilians are sitting ducks in there.”
He really fucking hated it.
It was okay. Only a dream. That was all.
have to deal or affiliate with. He deserved better than that. Jesus Christ, not even a few weeks ago Tony had nearly gotten Steve killed with the whole lab-accident thing, and if that wasn’t an indicator as to everything Steve had to put up with in this relationship, then Tony didn’t know what the hell was.
He felt the gaze of the entire team of Avengers settle on him, and felt incredibly small. He looked down at his lap. “Look,” he began, but Steve cut him off with a sharp shake of his head.
Tony stood up and moved over to him swiftly, checking him over just in case. But the boy was fine, and as soon as he clocked Tony, he lifted his head and raised his hands out in askance. Tony didn’t hesitate; wrapping his arms gently around Peter’s body and then taking him from Bruce’s arms. “Hey there, big guy,” he murmured as he gently rocked the baby on his hip, “you’re causing quite a lot of trouble in this place, aren’t you?”
Tony rocked them side to side gently, letting Steve cry quietly into his jacket for another minute before they receded into smaller little hiccups, and then silence as Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder and over to the view spun out in front of him like the finest silk.
Steve’s mouth opened, then shut again, lost. He was pale and his eyes haunted as he looked at Tony. “No,” he whispered with a shake of his head, and Tony fucking lost it. With a scream of frustration, he turned around and grabbed the mug, throwing it viciously into the wall, just wanting to hear something that wasn’t Steve’s subdued voice. This wasn’t how they argued, this wasn’t how they did
He looked at her, then groaned softly as his leg flared up in pain. “You should’ve stuck to your guns ‘n gone to the Bahamas,” he muttered, remembering their conversation earlier that month.
Tony veered left, and Steve yelped. The grab rail felt too fragile, too easy to let go of- and before he knew it, his hands had clutched tightly around Tony’s waist instead, cold fingers grabbing the fabric of Tony’s jacket like his life depended on it.
“Surely by nature of them being ‘horror’ movies, they’re not fun.”
He said the last part in their heads, not wanting Maria to hear it. Tony stilled against him, before Steve felt an eyebrow lift in surprise.
As soon as they heard the voice, he felt Tony stiffen against him. Steve watched his face drop, and then turn a little irritated as he sighed and released Steve’s hands. “Hey Ty,” he said, looking up and over Steve’s head to where a boy was stood with his arms folded, watching them curiously.
Of course, when Steve saw Tony trudging up the hill, his face broke out into a smile reserved only for him. His shoulders relaxed a little. He looked more like himself. “Morning,” he said easily, his hand finding Tony’s and helping him up the hill with a small tug. His skin was deliciously cool against Tony’s overheated fingers. He hated walking,
He took a sharp inhale through the helmet and tried to calm his heart a little. This was the weirdest night of his life- if someone had told him he’d be hitching rides on the back of Tony Stark’s motorbike after meeting him at a party, he would have just asked what they were smoking. And yet here they were.
“Absolutely.”
Steve watched him hurry off suddenly, and pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth as he reeled back the small question in the back of his mind as to why he wanted to get rid of them so badly. Before they’d been dating he’d seen Tony walk around with what was quite frankly way worse covering his neck.
Dad raised an eyebrow, taking a sip from his coffee and watching Peter with a look on his face. Peter just sighed. He knew what was coming.
It didn’t really work. They both walked out of their five minutes later looking as if they’d been electrocuted, but still. He felt a little warmer for it- although that might not have been entirely to do with the dry hair.
No response. Tony put the other hand up in repulsor-firing position then he pushed at the door, opening it up with a too-loud groaning sound. This room was lighter, mainly because it was huge enough that the roof had windows which let in the light from outside. It was also vast, spacious, like an auditorium, and filled with… medical equipment, it looked like. In the centre, Tony realised, was the same machine that they’d used on Bucky Barnes for all those years. Or at least, it had been. It looked kind of mangled now.
Tony just shrugged. “I’ll tell ‘em to bill me,” he responded, before burying his head into Steve’s chest and shutting his eyes. Steve was warm and comforting and familiar, and Tony was so, so glad that he hadn’t lost this. Not that there had ever been the risk of that happening in the first place, apparently, but still. It was nice to come to the realisation that Steve was, for some reason, a sure thing.
- but Steve had a stupid no-kissing rule set in place, so I waited ‘til he was gone!”
Tony looked like he might debate it for a moment, but then he just nodded, forcefully shaking the thoughts from his head as he fell onto the bed. They put their pyjamas on hastily, and then Steve pulled Tony back into his arms the moment they were done. He still felt shaken. They’d been so lucky today. A single different variable in the equation and everything could have gone very differently. He barely even dared to think about it, instead just holding Tony a little tighter and pressing a kiss into his shoulder, letting the heavy relief wash over him. “M’sorry,” he mumbled as he pressed Tony close, tried to block out the intrusive thoughts from his mind, “I should have seen him.”
To Steve, that's just plain unacceptable.
Steve had no idea what Tony was saying, except that there was a please in there at the end, and so just kissed his cheek comfortingly and squeezed his knee. “Just give us a minute, let us get your shoulder sorted, ‘kay?” Thor settled his big hands around Tony’s bicep and scapula, and Tony’s head tilted toward them nervously. Steve curled his hand around Tony’s jaw and tipped him back toward Steve, smiling at him with feigned confidence. “Hey. Look at me for a second. Don’t concentrate on Thor right now, just look at me.”
“Right, okay, I’ll shut up,” he broke away and mimed zipping his lips, although it ultimately failed a second later when Steve kissed them open again.
Tony could hardly keep a straight face by that point. “I love you too, sweetheart,” he nodded and then leaned forward to kiss Steve’s forehead. By that point, Steve had given up with the whole one-knee schtick, and was no simply kneeling at Tony’s feet and draping himself over his lap like a very large golden retriever.
He’d woken up in a shit mood, he’d looked at his phone and the corresponding text messages and then fallen into an even shittier mood, and now his idiot best friend was at his door trying to talk to him.
Steve sighed, hands curling around the rim of the crib and shoulders hunching inward. He stared intently down at Peter and worried his bottom lip with his teeth. “I still feel like I might break him at any given moment,” he admitted, voice nothing over a murmur, “but now— now I’m kinda glad I’m so strong. All I want to fuckin’ do is find out who hurt this kid and just—”
“I told you not to get electrocuted again,” Tony said weakly in an attempt at lightheartedness, but it came out a little more strained than he intended, “you goddamn asshole, why don’t you ever listen to me?”
“Stop trying to give me money, Rogers,” Tony raised his hand and left the ten bucks that Steve had slid into the leather jacket on the table, “this is a fight you will not win.”
hmm. Tony notes down in some corner of his mind that Steve seems pretty sensitive to kisses on the underside of his jaw.
“Steve,” Reed warned, “no, that is not what I—”
you to do this for me.” He looked imploringly at Natasha and Rhodey, biting his lip. He had to get them to understand. “If you two were in my place, would you want me to stay?”
He clenched his jaw and bumped her with his shoulder. “Let’s just get this over with,” he muttered, slipping in behind Natasha as she scanned in with her keycard. Since it was so early in the morning, most people would be at home, and only the night guards would be on duty. That made it a little easier, he supposed.
Steve looked at it with a raised eyebrow, noting the halloweeny themed foiled chocolates within the cardboard box. There were all sorts in there; caramel brains, mini toffee apples, white chocolate vampire teeth. And seeing as Steve seemed to never stop eating chocolate, it would help enforce some positive associations with Halloween if what he was enjoying so much was to do with the holiday, right?
“Hell yeah! Bucky Barnes and Peggy Carter, right? You talked about them before- bring ‘em over, yeah, it’ll be good,” Sam clapped his hands excitedly and then apologised when Steve winced, “but tell them to bring all their revision notes and shit. We mean business. We’re not going to get distracted- this test is important.”
“Well I’ve got a double period of it, so the next hour’s gonna be fun too,” he mumbled, rubbing his eye and then sighing dramatically, “how much do you think Mr. and Mrs. Wilson will disapprove if I just say fuck it and drop out?”
Tony’s nose scrunched adorably as Steve’s wet hair touched his chin, and Steve was about to move away, but Tony just made a noise of disapproval and clutched tighter, wrapping his arms stubbornly around Steve’s shoulders and sticking his whole face into the blonde wetness without another complaint. Steve just laughed again. “God, I love you,” he said softly, placing his greeting kiss against the plating of the reactor, “I love you so much.”
turns into a different person when he’s angry. You having cat ears and a tail isn’t really
The prince frowned. “I’m adopted,” he said, then looked at Steve, who shrugged.
The blond man put his arm around Tony’s waist, with the prince’s arm around his neck, and started walking slowly back to the stable, promising that he would put Friday back in her stall and then help the brunet back to the castle. “Will you be ok by yourself for a few minutes while I take care of Friday?” He carefully helped the royal onto a crate so he could rest for a moment.
the scandal! Howard was already married to Queen Peggy when he met your mother, but that didn’t matter to either one of them. Maria, and everyone else, truly believed Howard when he said he would leave his wife, but then he changed his mind after she told him about you. Didn’t want anything to do with either one of you. After she died, you were sent to an orphanage for a few days. Everyone in the village knew perfectly well who your father was, so rumors started spreading about the cruel king who refused to take care of his son after the sudden death of his mother, and just a few hours after giving birth, too.”
“Oh, come on, Rogers! He was a brainwashed assassin for Hydra for seventy years! Who knows what he believes now?! We have to make sure his mind is
“You’re welcome. And we’ll cancel your morning lesson tomorrow so you can rest.” He got into bed next to the royal. “Good night, Tony.” Steve closed his eyes, but just as he was about to fall asleep, the prince broke the silence.
“Well, you have to marry someone! You’ve rejected all the other princesses that your mother and I have brought before you.”
“No, thanks, Stevie. I already have something I can give him!” He stood up and ran to his room to collect the pigeon he had fought with, killed, and snuck into the house that morning, all without Steve knowing about it. He had originally been planning to give it to the blond as a “thank you” for helping him, but this was better. Bucky started purring as he put the bird into his pocket and left his room, then walked to the elevator and went back to Tony’s workshop. ‘
“Oh, for fuck’s sake…” Steve took a deep breath to calm down. “Tony. Listen to me. I’m right here. I would never let anything bad happen to you. Do you trust me?”
“Um…” Tony hesitated. “Actually...could I come with you? Maybe help you with whatever chores you have? Please?”
“Steve?” She asked, and he jumped a little, turning back to face her. She was looking at him with a smile, eyebrows slightly raised, “you seem a little out of it today. Anything the matter?”
“This is all I’ve been thinking about for weeks, Tony,” Steve said with a broken little laugh. “It’s the only thing that’s ever on my mind. I got a knife in my leg because I was beating up a terrorist and then suddenly I remembered the last person I’d hit had been
“I- what?” Steve asked in confusion, as he was led briskly over toward the studio he’d been watching intently for months by that point.
to fucking defend yourself, or—or make me feel better, something that’s not just fucking ‘sorry’!”
“Explain to me how this a team game, again,” Tony said dryly.
Steve hummed his acknowledgement and then called off, and a second later Tony heard his front door opening. He turned hastily back to the now-broken coffee cup and its contents, both scattered on the floor at his feet. In order to busy himself with something, he grabbed for the paper towels on the side and then dropped down to start cleaning it, all the while hearing Steve’s footsteps on the tiles as they approached through the hall.
Tony had to go. Loathe though Steve was to admit it, Ty had the upper hand. He had the leverage.
Steve let Tony sprawl over him and sleep for four hours, not even allowing himself to get up and pee. Tony’s warmth seeped into his bones, and when he curled into Steve’s chest with his whole body wrapped up in Steve’s own, he looked so much slighter and more defenceless. His closed eyes fluttered with dreams, and Steve watched his eyelashes twitch and curl, enchanted by it. Tony looked beautiful all the time, but there was something particularly heart-wrenching about seeing him sleep. He was altogether more child-like; he clung onto Steve and buried himself in blankets, and more than once Steve had woken up and turned around to face him, and only ended up seeing a tuft of dark brown curls, everything else buried under pillows and sheets.
“Can I just ask- does that make sense in your head? Because it certainly doesn’t in mine.”
Tony gasped, looking down at Peter in mock horror, while Peter just sucked on his thumb and looked innocently back at him, uncaring of their judgement. “You just urinated on an American Icon, Petey-Pie. I hope you know that.”
She was holding Peter in her arms.
Tony just shut his eyes and shook his head, moaning a little. “Worse,” he gritted, “Obie’s… come si dice… Obie’s smart. Smarter than— than Howard. Lives’n Cali. Can’t be alone, per favour, please, just… no hospital.”
“It’s a transmitter,” Tony spoke up loudly into the room, and Steve jumped. He hadn’t known that Tony had even heard him come in. “For transmitting and storing really really big bits of data and information. We’re talking, theoretically speaking, the entire internet- you know, in case of an alien invasion in which they manage to cut off that sort of thing to prevent communication. Hopefully, if I can work out some of the kinks, it’ll also be able to effectively transmit messages through space at rapid speed. Figure it might come in useful if we have to start taking some of our fights up out of the atmosphere, you know?”
“However,” JARVIS continued, “an AI such as myself would sell for up to hundreds of millions of dollars—enough for you to live out the rest of your life more than comfortably. Were you to find an appropriate buyer—”
, Steve thought he might burn from it.
Tony looked back, over to Steve with a wary face. Police reports were rarely good news, especially when it had things to do with small and vulnerable babies. He spun his finger. “Pull it up, J.”
“Blaming yourself. You had no idea this was going to happen- all you saw was your boyfriend saying he didn’t think you were important enough to worry about. That would be enough to upset anyone. You were perfectly within your rights to walk away.
"Hey hey hey, why the frog-marching?" Tony glanced behind him and spotted Clint, looking rather confused as Steve pushed him into the room firmly. When he set his eyes on Tony and the kid, he frowned. "You're up early," he said.
Bucky nodded, patting him on the shoulder. “Coupl’a scrapes from having to haul your ass back from that ledge, but nothing serious. I’m good, Stevie.”
He frowned, his sleep-addled mind not quite processing the connotations of those footsteps for another second or two. When he did, however, relaxation and peace suddenly felt a million miles away, and he wrenched his eyes open in horror, sitting up ramrod straight on the bed and then grabbing Tony’s shoulder, shaking him sharply. He could feel his heart start to leap in his throat, faster and faster as the sound got closer.
He shut his eyes softly, steadying himself on the sidewalk. Now was not the time.
“A cognitive block,” Bruce had said, and then when Tony had asked what the fuck that meant, he’d just smiled tiredly and told him the name had been invented about five minutes ago. “HYDRA were… there was a lot of testing equipment in the base when we got there. We think that you were their guinea pig, what with your brain being so…”
He drifted just above unconsciousness lazily for a few minutes while Tony padded around the room, brushing his own teeth and then getting into his pyjamas. When Steve felt the weight of Tony’s body shuffle onto the bed, he rolled to the side and then stretched out his hands. Tony laughed quietly, tiredly, and fell into them.
There were muffled curses and threats above them, but Steve and Tony were already moving, Steve pulling at Tony’s hand again and dragging them out of the room, running out into the corridor just as Bruce rounded the corner and spotted them.
And just like that, Steve was wide awake.
“Oh my God, Steve, I am so sorry everything associated with me is threatening you today,” Tony shook his head and held his head in between his hands, “he won’t- I swear he doesn’t mean that, he’s just what we would consider a very socially awkward teenager right now, still in the really early stages of development, buggy, y’know-“
His fingers worked, all his focus entirely engaged on the man as he twirled and spun and worked his magic upon the room. Soon enough, there was another little sketch sat roughly in the corner of his sheet, and Steve smiled happily. The man really was perfect- his whole aura was something Steve felt as if he could physically latch onto and draw for days on end.
“Hey,” Sam called, “you can sit there and look pretty and run through the last question with me at the same time, right?”
(And if Steve was being honest—painfully,
He grinned to himself as he opened up another email from Pepper, this one involving the agenda for tomorrow. A busy schedule, full of meetings and PR and an event opening down at MIT. The smile slipped. Goddamn it- he was going to need so much coffee to keep himself from blacking out tomorrow. So, so much.
“Don’t scream, please, or you’re gonna make me cry,” Bucky hurried to say, eyes widening as Steve gasped.
Steve thought about how it must have gone down. He worked through the timeline in his head, over and over and over again as the road sped underneath his feet and the silence of the car stretched between them. He wasn’t sure when Ty had managed to get in touch with Howard in his poisonous revenge plan, but Steve figured it must have been sometime that afternoon. He wondered what Tiberius said-
Steve just waved a hand, leaning further into Tony’s side. “All’s fair in love and war, buddy,” he declared, which earned him a pillow to the face.
“What?” He asked drowsily, voice a little croaky from disuse.
Steve’s heart sank at a steady pace as he listened to Fury reel off the facts: how Tony had become reclusive at the same time Iron Man had shown up, how there was intel which told them that he’d made purchases on the black market for parts that would only be needed for weapons designs that matched up with Iron Man’s armoury. Tony had stopped production of weapons nearly a year ago now, so there would be very little reason for those purchases. With every example Fury reeled off, another black mark was struck against Tony’s name. Steve could hardly believe it, but… but it was right there.
Steve’s face fell like a tonne of bricks. He looked like he was going to
Tony could hardly stop laughing enough to confirm it, by that point. “Yes, baby, we’re married. Don’t worry. There’s no one else.”
“There’s nothing solid yet,” Fury told him tersely, “he’s too smart to leave a trail. But the whispers alone are enough to warrant a search, at the very least. Even without Iron Man as his excuse—buying weapons-grade plutonium? Hiring out mercenaries with known kill-counts?” The Director’s face managed to look sympathetic for a second as he watched Steve. “There’s something dirty going on, Rogers. Whatever you knew of Tony before… he’s changed. Something’s gone wrong.”
“Tony—”
fuck does he know, what it’s like to feel that sort of pain. And he can’t stand the thought of Clint suffering the same.
People kept telling him it wasn’t his fault, but if it wasn’t his, then who else was there to blame?
It’d all happened so goddamn fast. This wasn’t even an Avengers callout, that was the most irritating fucking part of it. They were just on holiday. Skiing in the Alps in the two days before Christmas, because Thor had never done it before and when Clint had explained the concept to him, the man had begged for them all to go, and they’d thought, why the hell not? It would be fun, right? Harmless skiing, wind in your hair, no work-stuff having to follow them into the mountains?
Don't worry- they'll stop skirting around one another eventually. I promise.
“Supposedly,” he said, “but I’m thinking of rearranging it.”
“Depressing?” Steve said with a wry smile, “yeah, it kinda is. But it might help me. And someone’s gotta keep her grave nice and tidy, or she’d go nuts.” He laughed nervously, before thinking about how weird that must have sounded to Thor. Most people didn’t talk about the dead as if they were still alive.
intimidated by people, not as a genal rule- but he knew these kids. He knew how they pretty much ran the entire school. And he was also aware that they never really liked newcomers.
“Oh Jesus- Steve,” he said with a small laugh, taking the man’s face in his hands and tilting it back up so he was looking right at Tony, “sweetheart, I’m married to
Steve stared at him for a fraction of a second, and then he turned away, mind already on other things, more important things. He looked for Tony in the screaming crowds.
For The SteveTony ten year anniversary.
Tony asked incredulously, all anger forgotten as he stepped forward, sliding over the table in the center of the room and putting his hands on Steve’s shoulders.
Tony was aware of his plan- he knew it was really supposed to be tomorrow that he put out all the stops and then, well,
Hm. Maybe he’d accidentally drunk decaf this morning.
“Hmm, should damn hope so,” Steve huffed and then flopped back down onto the bed, face smushed into the pillow. He cracked open one eye and watched Tony with his perfect smile, the sheets shifting over the planes of his back. Tony wanted to jump back into bed and do exactly what Steve had suggested: stay. But, unfortunately, duty called, and would probably not appreciate being fobbed off in favour of a morning blowie.
“Guess what, Barton, no one asked you. Keep your damn mouth shut,” Steve snapped, and
He could start there, see what it dug up.
He wondered what had happened. How he’d gotten here. Whether everything really was okay now.
“Damn right it is,” he nodded solemnly and held out his hands, wrapping them around Tony’s slim waist as soon as he got near enough and tugging him into his lap, “best remember that.”
Well, that answered the question of how Tony had managed to get here last night. “Right,” he said, shuffling into the driver’s seat and then carefully pulling out and disconnecting the wires that JARVIS directed him to. Soon, all the cables lay loose amongst the car, allowing the computer, and therefore JARVIS who was trapped inside it, to be moved.
It was two hours and three minutes later when Steve’s phone went off. He grabbed it immediately and Bucky turned his head, automatically turning down the volume.
Steve manoeuvred them over to the bed in the other room and then gently settled Tony onto his side, crawling on top of him and planting a small litter of kisses across his face. It had to be getting close to three in the morning, and Tony was struggling to even keep his eyes open by that point, but hey, if Steve was feeling frisky, Tony was going to give as good as he got. With a half-smile and a small roll of his hips, he pressed his hand against Steve’s chest and slipped his fingers through the buttons of the man’s Henley. Although Steve smiled into the kiss, he ended up pulling away a second or so later. “Don’t tempt me,” he murmured, “we should both be sleeping.”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded, “thanks.” He moved his hand to Tony’s shoulder, nudging him gently until the boy’s eyes fluttered open hazily. Steve smiled at him. “Hey there. How’s things?”
“Steve.” Tony clamped down on his shoulder, his face serious. “Believe me, the US military wouldn’t dare touch me. What was it that you were investigating?” He was staring at Steve like the fate of the world rested on his next words; like this meant more to Tony than just getting an answer. Probably because it was relevant to Tony’s interests, what with his own plan to raid the same base.
"No- the kid."
He just couldn’t stop acting like a fool in front of that stupid, beautiful fucking boy. He was going to take his shopping bags and hit himself over the head with them, Goddamn it all to hell-
He’d changed, since she’d last seen him. And for some reason, that thought really hurt.
So he went on with his life. He stayed in Wakanda and thought about the fact he’d just lost everything,
,” Natasha said, sounding confounded, “when the wave came, the Enhanced split off to the basement floor, but all the other targets just marched right past and through to the exits on the other side of the building.”
“You’re staying with me tonight then,” Steve told him simply, and before Tony could even argue, he just strode ahead, “also- and forgive me if this is too invasive, but I figure that I deserve to know these things: What are your triggers, Tony? Do you know?”
, I thought you were bored of me, you missed our
“Care for some company?”
Peter burbled happily, sucking at a piece of lego as he looked up at Tony through his startling blue eyes. They reminded him of Steve quite a lot, if he was being honest. Tony frowned and then tugged it out, pulling a face at the saliva coating it. “Ugh, gross. Hey Steve!”
“Trippy?” Steve finished, and Tony laughed, nodding his head.
He wouldn’t.
“I’ve got you,” Steve said softly, “s’alright. I’ve got you.”
Well. That was one way to get noticed. He felt himself blushing, looking down and hurrying out of the way before the guy deliberately drove over him. When his eyes turned back upward, they were pulled automatically into the gaze of the boy he’d been staring at seconds previously. Who had obviously heard the noise and looked up. At him.
Tony followed shortly after, pulling a face. “We all know that, buddy, what I’m asking is why you decided to nearly start a fight with him in the middle of an empty corridor. You’ve never even spoken to him!”
Paul looked down fondly, but there was a small crease in his forehead as he took Steve in. “How’ve you been doing, kid?” He asked after a moment, leaning against the counter.
“Sir was not in a fit state to be driving last night,” JARVIS responded, “I requested to take over and he wired me in.”
Oh. Tony blinked and then sucked one in, feeling it burn almost like alcohol in his throat--- but that was not a train of thought he wanted to go down just then, so he shoved it away. “Thanks for the reminder J,” he said breezily. The temperature was dropping as he moved further North, and he watched the icy planes of the Russian tundra loom up ahead of him. Steve hated the cold. Always had.
“Would you prefer if I were quiet?” Steve asked- and there was nothing confrontational in his tone, simply a question. He wanted to know, because he just wanted to fucking help. And here Tony was, treating him like shit.
Tony always helped.
Steve’s face fell like a tonne of bricks, quickly going from surprised to horrified to furious in under a second. “You’re not fucking leaving, Tony, don’t be ridiculous,” he snapped harshly, “put the suitcase down and just go upstairs and get some sleep-”
“Steve, you don’t have to—”
“I’ve never seen so much effort put into a blanket fort before,” Steve said, awed. The biggest fort he’d made had been using the furniture in his living room, and he’d been seven. It had consisted of one blanket and a handful of pillows. “How did you make the blankets keep their shape?”
The others were relatively okay. Natasha had already come back around, and although her arm was definitely broken and she was suffering a mild concussion, she’d live. Rhodey had also only suffered a flesh-wound, the bullet piercing through flesh only. Bruce had been punched around a few times, but his self-defence training had pulled trough and he’d come out on top, so he was only facing a few bruises and some sore muscles in the morning. They could live another few days in here.
“Wha’ddya lookin’ at,” Steve asked, eyes still on the road as a small smile cracked his lips. Tony just leaned back in his seat, popping a chip into his mouth and raising his eyebrows.
Steve stared at him for a few more seconds. “What are you gonna do to my phone?”
Peter banged his hands on the table, the thing he was holding making a sharp metallic clang as it hit. Tony looked at it curiously, before- “NATASHA,
“Keep it. Can I?”
“Okay, well that’s just weird-“
Steve nodded tightly. The homework part of the sentence was a joke, but the rest was true. Bucky wouldn’t lie to him- he wasn’t looking for a fight. He’d said he’d try and make things right for Steve and he knew that he meant it.
He had to follow.
Turning over on the bed, he curled his arm around Tony’s waist and tugged him in closer, feeling the other man fit himself subconsciously against Steve’s body. He smiled at the action; pressing a kiss against the soft crown of Tony’s head whilst his fingers traced delicately around the scar on Tony’s shoulderblade. Bullet wound, he knew- he’d run his fingers over it enough times to be able to identify it to Tony’s body with his eyes shut.
As both men fell asleep, they had the same final thought: ‘
“Thank you, dear. You know, every time Steve called me and talked for hours about how beautiful you are, I didn’t believe him.” Tony’s face turned red. “I can see why he’s so in love with you.”
“Yes, you did! Good job! Now you have to put on the bridle.” The royal stopped smiling. “Yeah. You aren’t quite done yet. Sorry!”
“You were...flirting with me?”
“You’re lucky you’re cute,” he grumbled.
“If you promise not to get my ears wet. It hurts.”
“Hi! How are you feeling, kitten?” The super-soldier blinked again, trying to stay awake.
“Of course he can. He just…” He sighed. “He spent seventy years
“Can I see it?” the genius asked, and Bucky handed it to him. “Who is this?”
“Oh, I
’ He walked over to a supply cabinet and grabbed a pair of scissors. The hybrid walked back over to the sleeping man and carefully began cutting up the shirt the billionaire was wearing. Soon, the top looked more like a crop-top than a t-shirt. Satisfied with everything he had done, the super-soldier put the scissors away and went back upstairs, leaving just as Tony was waking up.
. But that wasn’t the problem!” He shoved the arm into Bucky’s face again, then turned and walked back to the elevator and disappeared from view, taking the prosthetic with him.
“I'm sorry, Prince Anthony. There’s a matter that your parents would like to discuss with you immediately,” Happy said, going to the young royal’s wardrobe and pulling out a garment.
“‘James Roger Stark, Junior’. I hope you two don’t mind. Having my last name will give him a bit of protection. And he’s a Buckitty Junior, so that’s where ‘James, Junior’ came from.”
Steve frowned. “How long has it been since you got a full-night’s sleep?”
Oh my god…” The prince was interrupted from whatever he was going to say next by a notification on his communicator that Queen Peggy was contacting him. “Hey, Steve? Could you hold on a minute? My mother wants to talk to me.”
“What is it, Barnes? I’m busy trying to fix your fuck-up,” the billionaire greeted him as he walked in. The hybrid stood there for a second, not saying anything. “Still don’t feel up to talking to me? Ok. Let me go get a notepad and pen for you, so you can write out an apology.” He stood up from where he’d been sitting next to Bucky’s new arm and went to the other side of the room. As soon as his back was turned, the super-soldier pulled the bird out of his pocket, put it next to the other man’s project, said a quick “извиняюсь”, and ran out of the room, all before Tony could turn back around.
“I’m sorry we had to wake you up early on your birthday, darling, but we have a surprise for you!” The queen looked pleased by something.
“Peter has school, which means no one would be home during the day to help if Hydra shows up. Yes, Tony. I know you have to work, but it would be much easier for Bucky to go with you than it would for him to go with Peter.” He looked at Bucky. “
“Of course! I’m at the stables. I’m just finishing up the last of my chores for the night, but I’ll be done by the time you get here. If you want, we could go down to the village for a while. I was going to go there after this to see my mom. Why don’t you come with me?” Steve suggested. The prince nodded.

“You all know I’m not
“Cleaning equipment while they eat. Then we’ll...
“Steve! You’re home! I missed you!” The hybrid climbed off of Tony then ran up and gave the blond a big hug, purring all the while.
“You’re a very cute kitten, do you know that?”
Нашу деточку качать,
“Capsicle? I’m here!” Steve looked over at the sound of Tony’s voice.
“How do
safe. I don’t know what I would do if something happened to any of you.”
“Hi, Steve. Tony went down to his workshop to get started on a design for Bucky’s new arm. He wants both of you to go down there when you’re done here. Hello, Bucky! My name is Bruce. Tony and Steve asked me to take a look at you, just to make sure you’re healthy. And maybe see if I can help you with your ears and tail. Is that ok?” Bruce’s voice was calm, gentle, and soothing, so Bucky immediately felt relaxed around him and nodded. “Good! Could you take off your hat and hoodie for me, please?” The hybrid did as the doctor asked. “Thank you. Now, let me take a look…” He reached up and gently parted the super-soldier’s hair. After a few minutes, he stopped and took a step back. “Well, I’ll have to consult with a friend of mine, who’s a neurosurgeon, or he was before his accident... and run a few tests…” Bucky interrupted him with an inhuman screech, and ran for the door.
“Don’t forget your communicator, Sir!” Happy held out a gold cuff bracelet, with various adornments, that vibrated softly when there was a holographic call and opened a hologram if it was pressed twice. The communicator could also send text messages if the sides of the device were pinched. It was fairly easy to use, didn't look like a technological device at all, and everyone in the castle and on its grounds, except for the king, was required to wear one. Tony took it and slipped it over his left wrist.
’ Tony thought as he walked. ‘
“Hi, Bucky! It’s nice to meet you!” Bruce smiled, then turned to Tony. “Could you tell me what I’m doing here, please?”
, then
“Have fun tonight, Your Highness!” The blond turned and headed back to Friday.
“He does! He hates me!”
“What do we do? How do we help Bucky?” he asked after a few minutes of trying to soothe his friend, who had fallen asleep in his lap. For the first time since waking up, he was at a complete loss on what to do.
нарушалось.” The genius sighed.
Bruce came back in the room, looking tired but calm. “I called my neurosurgeon friend. He was busy with another situation, but he’ll call us back. Since the arm Bucky has now was surgically attached to him…” He paused to take a calming breath. “...we’ll have to operate
Fuck, what an
, obviously, I was- I was just… you know what I mean.”
Steve said nothing, simply swallowed and looked away. There was a dark, petulant part of him that was still a little angry at that. Upset that Tony hadn’t managed to just pull himself together for long enough to offer Steve at least an apology. But it was stupid and irrational and selfish of him to feel that way and he knew it. Tony had been frightened, cornered like a caged animal. He hadn’t been thinking straight. God, some of the shit that Steve had said to Bucky back in the immediate aftermath of his mom’s death would’a put Tony’s simple statements to shame. He hardly had a leg to stand on here.
Tony was okay. He was okay. It had just been a dream.
“Three doors down on your left. And Sir-” JARVIS’ voice was serious and low, “if this
It took him twenty minutes until he was finally ready to get into bed. Steve lifted him, gentle and slow, out of the wheelchair and into the bed as if he didn’t weigh a thing, and then carefully plumped his pillows and tucked the sheets over him. Tony smiled at the action, and Steve smiled back, and for a single second things were almost normal.
“How does it feel,” Tony had asked when it was finally finished, lifting it up and touching it against Steve’s cheek. It was incredible, how… how real, it looked. If not for all the missing scars and marks that Steve had long since memorised on Tony’s old hand, Steve wasn’t sure whether he’d even have known it was a prosthetic at all. Hell, even the hairs were the same.
“Oh, we’ve been through this more than once in this evening alone,” Steve informed him, and then cackled when Bucky threw a pillow at his head.
“You shouldn’t know my name. It’s supposed to be classified. That is, unless you’ve been peeking into private SHIELD files. But why would a reclusive billionaire want to be doing that, huh?”
Sam was staring at him with a frown on his face, fingers locked under his chin. Tony had his legs crossed and was sat in front of Sam, finger tapping underneath an equation as he looked over at the other boy expectantly.
“Thank you,” he choked, and then walked over to the elevator without another word. He could feel her eyes on his back as he moved, and pondered on what it was she was thinking. Maybe she was debating whether she should call Steve’s team. Or take him down herself.
“We have to get him,” Natasha said it first, looking around the room, “there has to be a way—”
“Don’t slander me in front of our daughter, Steve, I can make dinner perfectly fine thank you!” Tony’s voice shouted from the kitchen, and a second later his head popped around the corner, looking a little bit frazzled. His glasses were all steamed up. “Maria, get away from that liar immediately and come fulfil your duties as culinary sidekick.”
But then Rhodey nodded. “Still breathing, still a pulse. Just unconscious. She got knocked into a tree.” In that moment, Steve noticed Rhodey’s own wounds. There was a tear in his jacket, and dark red slowly spilled onto the green of the material. The man saw Steve looking and held up a hand. “I’m fine,” he gritted, “just a flesh-wound.”
“Steve, believe me, it
That was all Tony's fault. Fucking Tony Stark, with his fucking eyes and his fucking hands and his fucking smile and God, he was a mess, but he smiled at Steve so genuinely and he could be so kind-
“Thank you,” he said quietly, “for everything.”
It was what Tony needed. Steve had been so selfish, ignoring his calls. Now he had to make up for it while he still could.
As for Steve… well, Steve was just going to have to play it by ear. See if he could stick around in the janitor’s office and then call Nat and ask her to buzz him out once the building had been released from lockdown, maybe.
There was a distant clanging noise, and he fell to the floor with a thud. They’d released his chains. This was it. This was his chance. He could fight it, if he fought it now then he could get out, there were no restraints, he could… he could make it…
Steve nodded, a tired smile breaking out. “Kay.”
Bruce rolled his head lazily, observing the situation from underneath his steamed-up glasses. “It appears so,” he declared a good five seconds later, before he rolled off the coffee table and fell to the floor with a heavy thump and a small ‘ow’.
They stood in silence for a moment, before Tony opened his mouth again. Steve, however, got in first.
“Hey, so d’you wanna do something that’ll probably really piss Bucky off?” He asked in the end.
Her hand descended and pushed his away, guiding it back to the side of the bed. “They warned me you’d be a nuisance,” Helen told him. “You’ll make a full recovery, but it still needs time to heal, so stop fiddling with it.”
She eyed him blankly for a moment, but then chose to allow an expression to fall over her face. Sadness. She touched his cheek. “I wish you didn’t think things like that,” she murmured, “Tony, we’re family. That is what Christmas is for. Going home, being with loved ones. And seeing as the majority of us didn’t even
I bet I’ve got crumbs all over my damn face now. Coming out here was a mistake- in fact, just dating you in the first place was a mistake I shall regret to my dying day-”
Thor grunted in approval, shuffling up the couch and then picking Peter up before standing and following Tony. “I think he missed you,” Thor commented, and Tony felt himself stiffen.
“I don’t belong here,” he murmured, “this isn’t my world any more. If I go back now, I will fix everything. But as things are… well. The world can’t live without him.”
Right. Because Tony was Iron Man. Tony was now apparently filling his extra time with
Tony considered carrying on the bickering for a little while longer, but Steve’s mouth was right there, soft and gorgeous, and as much as he loved listening to Steve talk, he much preferred feeling Steve kiss him. So he just shrugged, muttered, “Guilty,” and then wound his hand around the back of Steve’s neck to pull him in again.
For the record, he tried to keep a straight face. He really did. It was just… hard, with the memories so fresh in his mind.
“Peter’s enhanced,” Steve told him, voice clipped, “that enough of a problem for you?”
But for now, Steve was just going to enjoy the stars above him and Tony beside him and the fact that the world appeared to have stopped, just for tonight- just for him.
He waited around in one of the bathrooms on the 2
“Well, we’re fighting for the same cause then, pal,” Steve responded, finally letting his shoulders relax a little as the tension began to drain from the room, “I understand. I mean, I’d have appreciated if you could have left it a little later, and maybe not acted so… intimidating, but-“
Loki just shrugged, chucking the spliff into the glove compartment. “He’ll be alright,” he told Steve, in what he could only guess was the boy’s attempt at comfort, “I’ve seen way worse.”
“I won’t let you do this, Steve.” She looked at him from the elevator, her hand extended, forming the small force-field over the edge of the panel and barring Steve’s escape. She was still in her nightgown; hair flowing over her shoulders and eyes flecked with little bits of sleep. Her icy stare didn’t waver. “You’ll destroy the universe.”
“Look at me...I’ve been flirting with you for
“The ones from A.I.M.”
“Bucky?” The person looked up. It was a boy, maybe four years old, with light brown cat ears that looked just a little too big for his body, one of which was severely damaged. His hair was covered by what looked like a sock that had a large hole cut out of it for his face and two more holes on top for his little ears to poke through. He was wearing a large shirt that went past his knees and covered his hands. The child opened his mouth, revealing sharp teeth and a sandpaper tongue, and let out a tiny “hi!”. The captain frowned. He was about to speak when he heard the sound of people running. Looking up from the kid, he saw two agents, a man and a woman, approaching.
’ He took a minute to just look at his riding instructor. ‘
“Oh my God, kid! You’re coming with us to castle. He can come with us, right, Stevie?”
, it’s a
“Come on. It’s getting late. Bedtime for little kittens named Buckitty!” The feline felt his forehead being kissed right before falling back asleep.
’ He pulled a pencil out of his pocket, flipped to a blank page in his notebook and started sketching. Just as he was finishing his drawing of the sleeping royal, Tony woke up.
“I’m sorry, Mister Stark, but you can’t take experiments out of the building.”
“We’re not gonna stop until all of Hydra is either dead or captured,” he vowed.
“Understood. Dismissed, agent.”
are who we turned to. After the check-up, could you see if you can do anything about his…” He sighed, and looked at Steve. “Maybe
The genius smiled. “You’re welcome, Bucky. And thank
“What a smart boy you are! Are you in preschool?” The boy shook his head.
“извиняюсь? Are you sure that’s what he said?” she asked.
The prince nodded and exited the room. As soon as the doors closed behind him, he asked Pepper to arrange for him to have a carriage of his own, both so that he wouldn’t have to be around his father more than what was absolutely necessary and so he could leave later than his parents on the off chance that he found someone to sleep with. He then asked Jarvis and Happy to lay out his dark green suit and a fur cloak.
“It’s too expensive. If you have Stark tech, you are either
“Yes, but Steve doesn’t trust the S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors, but he trusts
“It’s your anger, Boss. Bucky thinks it’s his fault.” There was a moment of silence. “He’s apologizing for whatever he did to make you angry and begging you not to hurt him.”
“Bucky…” the blond complained, wrapping an arm around the hybrid.
,’ he thought happily, then turned serious. “This is my fault. I shouldn’t have pushed you so fast. Are you ok? Can I get you anything?”
“Well, the
“Why are you so scared of horses, Tony?” he asked shamelessly. The brunet looked up from his task of cleaning a saddle.
’), but after glancing in an alley, spotted the man, who was crouched down behind a dumpster and speaking softly. “Don’t worry,” he heard. “Everything’s going to be ok. I promise.” Tony opened the faceplate of his helmet and spoke up.
Tony shook his head. “Sorry. I mean, can I sleep next to you?” He paused. “Unless you want to sleep
Sarah also got a kiss from Tony. “I’ll miss you, Sarah. Call us, okay?”
“A phone.”
Around two o’clock the next morning, Tony was still awake. ‘
“I love it! Thank you, Steve!” The blond chuckled.
“Oh, that’s fine! I guess I’ll just talk to you later?” the blond asked hopefully.
“Queen Peggy told me all about the ball they went to last night. Apparently there were about a hundred princesses for Prince Anthony to talk to, but he didn’t want anything to do with any of them. The king was very displeased,” Natasha said.
“First make sure it’s the right size for her. If it’s too big, it will slide around in her mouth, but if it’s too small, it can pinch her. Now take off the part of the halter where the noseband is. Pick up the bridle from the top part with your left hand. Just let the rest of it dangle. Move the straps to the outside of the cheek pieces so they don’t get tangled up. Good! Now put the reins over her neck. Hold the bridle in your right hand. Hold it so  that the two sides are a good distance apart, with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.” The prince just stared at him blankly. “I mean the part that goes near her throat. That just makes sure her bridle doesn’t fall off. Grab the reins while you do it so that you don’t create loops for her to step in and keep all the straps off the ground. The next step is to have her drop her head so you can get the bit in her mouth.”
“Tony? What’s wrong?”
“Come on, Your Highness. Time for bed.” Steve stood up and lead the prince up a small ladder that Tony hadn’t noticed when he arrived, which lead to an attic bedroom. There were high windows on either side of the room, a desk and chair under the window on the left-hand side, and a bed with a twin mattress facing the door.
was apologizing!”
The blond shook his head. “It’s ok. I said it’s fine. I just…”
“...excuse me?”
He took off the hoodie he was wearing and wrapped it around the hybrid that was shaking from the cold and turned on the car’s heater. The first thing he did when they got inside the Tower was to shove Hydra’s former assassin inside the master bathroom on his private floor.
“They're dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle. Why would I want anything with a mind of its own bobbing about between my legs?”
Steve nodded. “I know you are. You can eat after the surgery.”
, Steve. I can’t... Please don’t make me go through that again! Please don’t let him or his friend hurt me,” he begged.
“Yeah, I thought you looked tired when I first saw you this morning. Well, it’s almost time for lunch now, so why don’t we take a break, and go back to your lessons this afternoon?” The prince nodded and they parted ways for a few hours.
he thought to himself, and got to work helping the business owner. An hour later, he was done. ‘
Tony looked at his instructor, trying to figure out if the blond was a man of his word, but nodded after a moment. “Yes, we do.”
“I’m Juniah!”
“I’ll be right back.” He tapped on the notification, which made a second hologram appear, and immediately saw his mother’s face.
“I wanted to stay longer, but Tony has work to do, Ma. We will be back as soon as we can,” he said, and kissed her forehead.
“I never said that. I just don’t think your son would like me in that way. We’ve only known each other a few days, and he’s already become my best friend, but I think he likes somebody else.”
“No, thank you,” the blond said politely. “May I ask why you want to sleep here instead of in your own bed, Your Highness?”
’ “Ok, JR. You can open your eyes and stand up now. Take my hand. When the doors open up, walk as fast as you can, and don’t let go of my hand.” When the elevator stopped, he stepped out and was immediately stopped by two security guards.
“If you want to.”
“Because they’re all boring and ditzy! If and when I get married, I want it to be to someone that I actually love. Someone that treats me like an equal! Somebody who can see passed the crown and money, and just see me!”
“Hi, Pepper,” Tony greeted the former princess, who had chosen to give up her title and help his family after their former reeve passed away suddenly.
As Tony was saying “K is potassium” to himself, the riding instructor finally came out with a beautiful mahogany-brown horse with a black mane and tail. But the size of the horse made the young prince take several steps back, and Steve frowned.
died in World War II, standing in front of him with a tail and ears that perfectly matched his dark brown hair, and blue eyes with diamond-shaped pupils. He felt like he couldn’t breathe. He took a few more steps back, shakily. His chest was hurting, so he tried to suck in some oxygen, but he was just gasping instead of breathing properly.
“Oh, please, call me Sarah,” she demanded. “Is Stevie doing well in the castle? At first I thought he wouldn’t  adapt very well, but now I see I was completely wrong.”
“We should let him sleep. He’s had a long day. Don’t worry so much, Tony. We found and disabled the tracker. And no one knows about the farm. Clint told me that he went directly to Fury, so there’s no papertrail. The kid will be safe there.” The billionaire sighed and nodded.
“Bye, Mistah Amewica!” the child called as he was taken away. The woman was about to follow them, but she was stopped by the super-soldier.
“You got it. I’ve been calling him JR. And JR isn’t safe! We need to leave New York as soon as possible. Ross will do
Yeah, he does. Is that where we’re headed?”
“Thank you, Sarah.”
As they took the equipment for the horses outside to clean, Steve thought. He showed the prince how to clean everything, and thought. They were both quiet as they got to work on their task, and he thought more. Suddenly, he couldn’t stand it anymore and had to ask the royal a question that had been bothering him for the last two days.
“Stark? What’s wrong? Is Bucky ok?” the captain asked, concerned for his friend.
“We’ll meet you in Doctor Banner’s lab, Stark,” the blond-haired man said. The genius nodded, lowered his faceplate, then fired up his jet propellers, and flew away.
“Hey, Mister Rogers! Can you give this to your ma…” The boy froze as he saw the prince’s face smiling at him. “Tha-that is the prince!”
The next morning, Steve woke up with his right arm numb. He looked down to see the prince still fast asleep. “I love you,” he whispered.
Hydra’,
“I...It’s complicated. My father and I, we…” The other man started sobbing, and could no longer look at his instructor.
“Better?” The soldier nodded, closed his eyes, and let him wash his hair. After a few minutes, his hair was washed and the blond spoke again. “Oh! I found something for you. Let me go get it!” He reached up to the shelf next to the tub and pulled down a white cat.
“I do what I want. Can I take a companion with me?” ‘
that he won’t suddenly turn into the Winter Soldier before he meets the rest of the team...but
“This way, Mister Stark.” The agent lead him into an elevator and they travelled down several floors. The genius frowned.
“Barnes is going to murder me!” he said in a rush. He could feel a panic attack starting. ‘
“Are you sick, kiddo? When was the last time you went to a doctor?” He pressed his hand against the child’s forehead, and winked at the boy. “You have a fever.” He turned back around. “He has Coopedupitis! We have to get him to a doctor
“This is
“Bad dweam,” the child whispered.
’ the hybrid thought darkly.
“About five minutes. Can you be out of the Tower by then?”
Soon a letter slid under his elbow. Tony had no idea how to read the messy Russian that the super-soldier wrote.
“And ‘Roger’ because my last name is Rogers?” Steve guessed.
“Thanks, Rogers. Now, what do you need from me?”
“You did?” Tony nodded, then sighed again, and ran his fingers through his hair.
, and another agent said that he’s, quote, ‘just some freak that we rescued when we were taking down A.I.M.’! It was awful. I’m not sure how much longer the Avengers can work with S.H.I.E.L.D. with Ross as the Director. He fired all of the good agents, or they disappeared, except for Natasha and Clint, and brought in these people that I’m pretty sure either worked or
“It’s fine, Tony. Really!” Steve stopped him before he could leave the room. “I don’t mind letting you have my bed for the night.”
“The lavender suit, with a black shirt, please.”
to chirp like a bird. The pigeon chirped again, and suddenly the former Hydra assassin lunged at the group of birds, and tried to catch the one he had been chirping to.
Around seven o’clock that night, Tony finally got in touch with Steve, via communicator.
“Mmm...good morning,” the blond said, his voice thick with sleep. “Did you sleep well, after you came over last night? No nightmares?”
“...I think it would be better if you saw this for yourself, rather than me explaining it over the phone,” Steve eventually said.
“Ты безумен. Пожалуйста, не сердись на меня. Мне жаль. Что бы я ни сделал, чтобы рассердить тебя, мне очень жаль! Пожалуйста, не обижай меня!” The super-soldier shrunk back in fear.
Steve asked Bucky to cover up, not only because he was part-cat, but also because he didn’t want anyone recognizing them, although the little old lady from the fruit stand recognized him in the first few weeks, even with the baseball cap and hoodie on.
“Steve? Shut up, love,” the prince said as soon as he pulled away. “I love you, too.” He paused to give the blond another quick kiss. “We should get up though. You have chores, and
“I know the perfect thing to wear! I’ll see you soon.” Tony got out of Steve’s bed and walked back to his room.
When the prince got there, he found Happy waiting for him.
“Yeah, but to where?” Bucky asked, looking up from the bench he was sitting on, with JR fast asleep on his lap.
