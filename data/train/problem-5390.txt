“God Tony you’re so tight.” Steve said, gripping Tony’s hands harder, “You feel so—ohhh!— good.” He cried out as he continued to thrust, speeding up a bit.
“Well yes mostly him but you take care of all of us.” He paused, “He seems really happy, I’ve never seen him smile so much.”
It had been three days since the battle, and Steve spent them all on bed rest. Thankfully the serum allowed him to heal quickly so he would be back to normal in just a few more days. They all were horrible breaks and had he been human, he probably wouldn’t have survived.
“Only the Museum Of Modern Art! I rented out the place so we wouldn’t be bothered. What do you say?”
The rest of the night was spent looking at incredible art and afterwards Steve took Tony to an old Brooklyn restaurant and treated him to an amazing dinner. They talked about the Avengers as well as sharing other personal stories, they got to know know each other better. Both of them loved every moment of it.
“The painting also has one of her knives in the back. Not many people knew she used them.” Tony said.
Since waking up in the new world Steve had more or less been trying to move on. He hated the fact that everyone he knew was gone but he had to move on and forge new connections. He had a team now and he wanted them to be family.
“I’m glad to see the world has changed for the better.” Steve said seriously, “When I was a kid I was forced to hide who I was. I’m glad to see for the most part people don’t have to do that anymore.”
If everything went according to Hammers plan, he was screwed. But if he managed to escape or… if the Avengers would find him, well there would be some changes.
“Okay I think I’ll try this tomorrow, I need some sleep.” Bruce said, tired yet with a satisfied smile.
He walked into the room, expecting Steve to be asleep but instead was greeted by a very alert looking boyfriend.
“Sir you have successfully finished the stabilizer. You are already tired from the training session, perhaps it is a good time for you to get some rest.”
“Wow Steve, trying to butter me up with gifts but you really just want my undivided  attention don’t ya?” Tony teased.
“It’s good to have you back man.” He said as he squeezed him tight. Tony closed his eyes and reveled in feeling his friend there.
“You have been working so much lately that I thought you could use some food. Jarvis said you haven’t been out of here in the last two days.”
However, when Natasha got all of them on the furthest target, Tony was forced to stand there as she threw a pie in his face and had Bruce record it. Tony knew the video would be up by the next day.
He stretched his arms and as a result Tony began to stir. Tony reached a hand to Steve’s chest and mumbled out, “Mornin’...” while smiling softly.
Tony took a moment before replying to think back on the last few weeks. Him and Steve had been getting along much better and had even come close to becoming friends. Tony had been trying to keep his distance, he couldn’t stomach the idea of anyone on his team, especially Steve dying in battle. Besides he was a selfish billionaire who had caused too much death due to his carelessness, not to mention the lack of being able to sleep due to the nightmares that consumed him. No, Steve wouldn’t want anything to do with him once he got to know him. Just like everyone else.
“Seriously you could just tell him to fuck off.” Tony said then sighed, “But fine, it’s only a few days. When do you have to leave?”
“Just be happy that you’re one of the few people on this earth that is blessed with my presence.” Clint retorted.
Well… that had totally gone to shit. Tony just tried to breathe in and out and will the tears not to come. It was ridiculous to want to cry over some stupid argument but it wasn’t fun to have someone point out your insecurities and use them against you. Much less have them voiced by a close friend.
Tony but down on a scream bit thrashed his head from one side to another. He couldn’t stop the tears that came to his face from the horrible pain. Dark crimson blood soaked his midsection.  He kept panting even after Justin was finished.
He expected a bunch of rambunctious Avengers to greet him but all he got was Steve sitting on the couch...sketching. He walked closer to see what Steve could be drawing and he saw what looked to be the inside of an older home. But before he could see anymore Steve turned around.
Once the laughter died down Steve offered to make them both dinner. That’s how Steve and Tony ended up eating delicious spaghetti. After that ended up sat together on the comfy couch watching some comedy movie.
Tony had accidentally fallen asleep with Steve on the couch last night. He had to admit that it was really nice talking with Steve, he had even managed to surprise himself-what did he expect? He was Tony Stark-by opening up to him. It was unexpectedly easy to talk to the man, Steve was very different from Captain America who commanded them on the field.
Tony whimpered at that, “No no please Donald I can’t take it! It’s killing me! Make it stop now.” He said as he felt a large spark of energy shock his insides.
“Yeah I did I spent a lot of time in the lab, I think I’m close to finding a way to controlling the Hulk.” He replied enthusiastically.
Steve met Tony down in the lobby in a nice suit. He caught Tony staring for a moment before ushering him in the car.
“Look guys I really don’t appreciate you ganging up on me. And Rhodey you don’t even think to question what Pepper is telling you? You just assume she’s right.”
Tony ignored him, “While I was gone I took the liberty of getting you all presents. Little souvenirs, but next time we all can go.” Tony said kind of shyly.
“Ah now it all makes sense! This is why you are the leader of the Avengers. Forget saving the world, you just need the admiration and cheers of adoring fans.” Tony added.
Once everyone settled down, they turned the TV on. It flipped on a news channel and a very enthusiastic anchorwoman began speaking, “And just in we have a photo of two of our favorite superheroes. Tony Stark aka Iron Man was spotted holding hands with Steve Rogers, aka the Captain America. Are they together? Well folks seems like it, they were spotted leaving a pizza parlor, sounds like a date to me. We will leave you to ponder this during our commercial break.”
Justin bared his teeth at Tony, “Don’t you dare you worthless piece of shit.” He growled out, then yanked Tony’s arc reactor from his chest.
Tony rested his head against Steve shoulder. “Yeah well I didn’t really feel this way before, just with you. I want a home not just a house.”
“Is he okay” Bruce asked concerned, “I haven’t had time lately to join him in the lab and he does seem to be busier than usual.” Bruce said, “Come to think of it he does seem stressed.” He added concerned.
Tony shrugged, “Well that’s what usually happened. Howard would host some huge party, usually it was a stunt for business and I would end up alone. Jarvis saw that and took me with his family instead.”
Tony considered fighting or trying to run but he was drained. Even though he was awake and alert during the energy transfer, that adrenaline wasn’t made to last. He was also mentally and emotionally drained.
As he rounded the corner back to the tower he stopped when he got in the lobby. He saw Tony with Pepper looking irritated.
“Okay good.” Tony said shifting, “Because I have something else for you since you’re my favorite.” Tony said, pulling out a necklace.
Steve was captivated, there was so much incredible art, Steve however asked Tony if he knew what the meaning of a painting was. It had an equal symbol in rainbow colors with incredibly detailed male hands holding onto each other.
Before uncapping the lube, Steve wanted to make this extra special for Tony, so he brought his face to Tony’s crotch. He spread Tony’s thighs and began licking lightly around his hole.
“Come join us, brother, this movie is amazing.” Thor dragged him over to the couch. Where he wedged Tony in between him and Steve.
Tony thrashed and tried to pull away from the onslaught of water that was hitting his face. He couldn’t breathe, his lungs felt like they were on fire and he was gonna die, he would never see Steve or the Avengers again and—
Steve glanced at Tony and he was just frowning and staring at the counter like it was the most interesting thing in the world. Natasha was staring at Tony, smiling like she knew something.
Steve was drawing at his usual place at the table when Thor comes out looking a bit ragged for a God.
Steve smile just grew, “Think of it as a peace offering...or an apology for what happened yesterday.”
Then Steve pulled away, uncapping the lube and began to spread it on his fingers, he moved his hands to Tony’s hole, massaging the area around it.
After this it became somewhat of a thing, Steve or Tony would let the other know when they couldn’t sleep. It could be at any obscure hour of the night, but they would always help distract each other until they fell asleep.
“Tony, love.” He said gently, “Tony can you hear me? It’s Steve. Come on baby, you can open your eyes.”
Another man entered the room and it was none other than Justin Hammer. All Tony could think was: You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. Again.
“My fellow Avengers! The vessel that transported that horrible man is now vanquished! This Gala is officially a success!” Thor boomed.
Another night Tony showed up and knocked on Steve’s door. Tony stood there hugging himself and Steve wrapped his arms around Tony shielding him for the world. He then told Tony stories about the war until they both passed out.
Tony tried to scream but all that came out was small gasps and whimpers. God this weapon felt so much worse. He would do anything to make it stop.
“You know what would help me? If there was someone making some bacon.” Said Clint rather grumpily while walking into the kitchen yawning.
Steve sat down and Tony sat on the bench in front of the piano. He took a breath and began to play what Steve knew was the most beautiful piece of music he had ever heard. It was a happy song, that much Steve knew and from the looks of it very complex.
“Why?” Steve asked, “People must tell you how good looking you are like a million times a day.” Steve said, his hold on Tony’s waist tightening a bit.
Bruce had moved Tony from the OR to a regular room when he saw enough progress. The whole thing had been one giant waiting game and Steve hated it.
Just as Steve was going to rip one of the arms of the robot off, it twisted and shot at the building Natasha and Clint were in.
To say Steve was mad was an understatement. He called a team meeting, besides Tony, to explain what Fury had said and what they were going to do about it.
“No Tony there is no mission.” Steve said, standing up from the couch where they all sat. “We want you to look at these please.” He said, handing him several documents.
After that, the conversation continued, mostly about Avengers related business and future training. They eventually headed off to the common room where Tony spent a long time telling Steve about this improvement he found that he could add to improve clean energy. Tony was smiling and rambling and Steve could barely follow but to see Tony happy like that made it worth it. Tony was about to excuse himself to go to the lab when Steve interjected,
Steve sighed, “Look Tony I’m not trying to be ungrateful here, I know you want to help me.” Steve said, reaching out grabbing Tony’s hands, “I just need to move a bit more slowly, I don’t want to change the way I look right away. But I’m definitely open to maybe a few shopping trips.” Steve finished smiling.
“A pint and a half is what Jarvis said would work. Just enough to heal his injured body but not enough to overwhelm him.” Bruce said as he prepared the IV.
Tony however didn’t, “No it was just the one time. Someone noticed Howard’s son wasn’t at the event and from then on out I wasn’t allowed to not be there. I had to represent the Stark name.” Tony added bitterly.
“Oh that’s in support of LGTB community. Basically the artist supports Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders. They are showing their support for people to love who they want, no matter who they are.” Tony said nervously, he didn’t know Steve’s stance on the matter, but considering when he was born he imagined it wouldn’t be good.
“You should have seen the great and mighty Directors face when our Captain said he wasn’t asking for permission.” Thor said proudly.
“I’m sorry Tony.” Steve grimaced, “We know it was wrong to change you like this, to do this to your body without your consent. But we were desperate, we had to save you.”
“Why? Are you worried I pose a threat as competition against you.” He winked at Steve and stuck his tongue out at Tony.
Tony couldn’t believe he could endure this much pain. He felt as if he was being burned alive and drowning at the same time. He was drenched in sweat and the pain was never ending. Not only was he helping his enemy, but the weapons took forever to charge. He had to stay conscious through all of it. All he could do was cry and scream for an end that he knew wasn’t coming.
He was dying! Dying. He wouldn’t ever get to see Steve again! His last breaths will be with these two horrible excuses for humans.
Tony shook his head “I’m no hero, that’s why I have the nightmares. It’s the price I pay for being a murder.” He said, looking like he wanted to cry. “I just need sleep so badly but I can’t watch you guys die, it’s just… too much.” He said sadly. He then made a move to get up but Steve held firm.
Tony sighed, “Yeah I know.” He knew Steve would want to deny it but the fact that that was the first thing on his mind stung.
“Remember when we took your blood?” He asked rhetorically, “Well we splattered it on a crime scene and, well, now everyone thinks you’re dead.” He declared, clapping his hands together.
“Sorry about that.” Steve said, unsure of what to say next, it didn’t matter because Tony brought the ice cream over and sat down next to Steve at the table.
“Wow.” Tony scoffed, “You and Rhodey really seem to be on the same page.” Crossing his arms over his chest, “Because he feels the exact same way, that I’m not worthy of leading the Avengers.”
Donald walked in then. He smiled and looked to the weapon beside him. Yellow bars lit up on the side.
No one in the car had the heart or energy to argue with him. So they all just murmured sounds of agreement.
“Wow Steve, it’s been almost a century and you still can’t properly climb down a tree.” Tony said teasingly and laughing, still having a severe case of giggles.
Now that Tony was more awake and alert he was beginning to notice things he didn’t before, like the fact he could hear the cars on the street and read the sign outside the door with really small writing. Both of which he was positive he could never do before.
“I don’t understand why you drag me to these meetings. They’re pointless plus you’re the CEO. I have better things to do.” Tony snapped
“Let’s go furniture shopping.” Steve said seriously, then slowly smiled, “Then we can christen that as well.”
They kissed, soft and sweet at first. They were exploring, testing the limits. Tony deepened the kids and wrapped his hand around Steve’s neck and ran his fingers through his hair.
As Tony tried to spit it out Donald walked over to grab a bucket of water. He brought it over and used the cloth to cover Tony’s mouth and face. He poured the water over the cloth and began to waterboard Tony.
“Aww come on Nat you know you love me and would never leave me to the wolves.” Clint batted his eyelashes at her.
When Steve asked Bruce how he managed to do that, Bruce just smiled knowingly, “Let’s just call it a scientist’s intuition.”
“You’re wrong.” Tony said louder, “The Avengers want me, they’re coming. And when they do you’ll have hell to pay.” He said resolutely, he didn’t realize how much he believed that until he said it.
Steve didn’t need to be told twice, he lined himself up with Tony’s hole and waited a moment to take a breath before pushing all the way in.
That night, Tony slept soundly and content. His last thoughts centered around the possibility of maybe getting closer to the Avengers and possibly just being able to take a little breather.
“Sir I strongly advise you get some sleep. You haven’t for the past 48 hours and have consumed nothing but coffee since then.” The AI cut in.
In this chapter Tony gets water boarded as punishment but it doesht go on for very long. Then Justin Hammer carved letters into Tony’s stomach with a knife. Then Tony’s arc gets used to power weapons against his will, he is also force fed some pills.
Uh-oh Tony thought, here comes the part where Steve asks him to resign-he shared too much-and now he’s going to lose everything.
After Tony read the documents, a warm happiness he hadn’t felt in a long time settled in his chest. The team all decided to spend time together in the common room after that.
Steve sat down on the couch and Tony quickly sat down next to him. Steve was surprised… there was a lot of room on the couch. They locked eyes quickly before looking away. Bruce sat next to Thor and they all decided to watch a Disney movie in order to “culturally educate” Steve and Thor.
“Okay Cint, I got you this Samurai Yumi bow. I thought you would like to add it to your collection. It’s very treasured, but I pulled a few strings.”
Once Tony passed out in Steve’s arms, he called out to the others, “Guys we need to get Tony to the quinjet now! He needs Bruce and medical!”
They both stood in the kitchen preparing dinner, well more like Steve was preparing dinner and Tony was doing his best to distract him. He sat on the kitchen counter doing his best to steal the fries that came out of the oven.
He took in his surroundings, it was dark and he seemed to be in a dungeon of some sort. All of a sudden the memories came back, Jarvis was down and the robot came and snatched him away.
“You know,” Tony started, “If you wanted a good tour guide, I’m the person to ask. I have access to some pretty cool places. I’d be happy to take you and Thor if you wanted.”
“Oh Tony I would love too but I’m actually leaving this evening. I have a flight in an hour but I wanted to see you before I left.”
Tony woke with a groan and a pounding headache. Damn what had he done last night? It was strange because ever since he was with Steve he had stopped drinking, so the consumption of alcohol couldn’t explain the pain in his head.
Steve was very nervous, he had no idea how Tony would respond to this. He wanted to give something to Tony, something that he couldn’t just buy. That already was an extremely complicated concept itself, not to mention Tony was a billionaire who could buy literally anything he wanted and on the rare occasion he couldn’t buy it, he could just build it himself.
“There was a man, his name was Yinsen.” He paused, putting his hand over his arc reactor, “He helped me build the suit. And he sacrificed his life for mine, he told me not to waste it.”
“Yeah yeah, ‘earth's mightiest’ heroes and all that. We just need you to show up and look pretty.” replied Tony, trying to get to the point.
Tony screamed as he felt his rib eventually give and bend inside him. He couldn’t stop the tears that fell as the pain exploded.
“Coulson sent me an emergency signal and one to Thor as well. We both came as soon as we could.” Clint said, “You don’t need to thank us man we have to protect our team.” He smiled.
“Captain Rogers would like me to inform you that there’s breakfast for the whole team waiting for you in the kitchen.”
“Tony I need you to understand something. What I was trying to say yesterday was that I am worried about you. Not because I don’t think you’re capable of taking care of yourself-trust me, I know you are. I see you working yourself to the bone and you don’t have to.”
“Here’s what happens when you talk back to me.” Justin snarled. “I hope you learn your lesson. Bonus points if you scream.” He said, smiling.
“Oh…you don’t talk about your family much. What were your parents like?” Tony asked interested, sitting down.
“Okay so obviously we need to build a bigger closet because we need to get you a whole new wardrobe.” Tony declared with finality.
They all sat together, Steve and Tony next to each other, grateful to have people in their life that they could call family.
Tony smiled bashfully in response and-jeez when did Tony Stark display such emotions? Probably when he fell in love with Steve Rogers.
Tony looked up through his tears, horrified that Steve was leaving him. That it was all true after all.
He looked up to see Tony with a hand to his chest, looking awful and breathing hard. He made a beeline for the fridge, yanking a tub of ice cream out of the freezer.
“Yeah well why else would we be friends? It’s because I’m useful. I have money and I can build you the best tech available. Now if you’ll excuse me I really have a lot of work to do.” Tony said in a dismissive tone.
“Come on Steve! Let’s go on a vacation then. Have you been to Paris?” He said while pacing back and forth.
“God you’re such a sap.” Tony accused, however he all but melted into Steve and wrapped his arms gently around him.
“Haha very true but sometimes we need help with the small things. Come on Tony match your breaths with mine.” Steve coaxed.
It was nice to finally have someone who wanted to hear his story, who came to Steve for advice. In short it was nice to be needed and not needy.
Tony fought hard not to smile and looked down at his work, muttering, “So...is this going to be a regular thing now?”
They walked into the kitchen, “So I heard you received the title as co-leader of the Avengers, that’s big man!” He said clapping Tony on the back.
Steve was one minute away from a total panic attack. He was screaming on the inside, God Tony had been so hurt. He was beaten within an inch of his life and god knows what else. Despite seeing Tony in such a state… there was something else that was bothering him. When Tony saw him he seemed partially surprised that him and the team were there. Almost like he was surprised they came for him. Whatever it was he would have to talk to Tony about it when he got better.
And the rest of the night was spent watching a terrible comedy movie until they both passed out on the couch.
“Wow when that’s incredible! Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. I know I’m no scientist but I’m always here.” Steve smiled.
Tony rolled on his back onto the bed and decided to call Rhodey. He hadn’t heard from his friend in a while.
A few days later Tony and Steve were in the common room. Steve was fully healed and now Tony wanted to make him watch his favorite show.
They both moaned out at the incredible sensation, every nerve ending felt alight with fire. Steve felt like he was going to burst, intense heat and tightness surrounded him.
Steve wanted to ask him more about that, but he could tell it was something personal that he wouldn’t want to share in front of everybody.
Steve just sighed and leaned in to give Tony a deep kiss. Tony started to pull him in more- “Nuh-uh, Tony we can’t have the burgers burning.”
The sensation of Tony tightening around Steve caused him to cry out in pleasure. Then moments later he felt his own orgasm coming.
Tony sighed, he took a minute  “Nothing it’s stupid.” He tried to explain, but then looked up at Steve. “It’s just everyone, Fury, Pepper, Rhodey, they all keep telling me that I’m irresponsible and take things for granted. I’m told to ‘behave or else’.” He said looking down “No one believes in me, or even likes me.” He said quietly.
“Steve!” Tony called out, immediately blasting over to him and shooting at the tentacle that was gripping his boyfriend.
Other than that things had been going really well. When Steve threatened to take down Fury that had meant the world to him. Steve was his best friend and was proving to be such an incredible person. He didn’t like sharing his friend! No way no how.
Tony just grumbled in response and got up, smiling softly at Steve. Steve just led him out and followed him to his room to make sure Tony was actually going to bed.
They managed to get an employee who didn’t cause a scene, to take a photo of them. A photo that featured Bruce holding his Hulk plushie in one hand and Iron plushie in the other, Natasha on top of Bruce’s shoulders as the reigning queen and Tony and Steve holding hands together with cotton candy.
“Now, now Mr. Stark.” Donald from the gala said, “That kind of talk will get you nowhere here.” He smiled.
“Hmmm sounds like he’s doing just fine then.” Steve smiled, deciding not to question Natasha about her ability to check in, “I like knowing he’s okay.”
“No, it was planned. Tony was down in his lab and that was exactly where to robot go him.” Steve said, barely containing himself.
“Sir your heart rate is increased too much for such little time, do you need me to alert someone for assistance?”
Tony breathed heavily and tried to maintain a stoic expression but it was hard, especially after the arc reactor was fried from powering weapons. Hah, the irony in that was incredible.
He met up with Bruce, Natasha and Tony on the quinjet. Tony was looking a little pale, he wanted to ask why but he knew now wasn’t the time.
Tony smiled teasing, “Hey I’m not sure, I mean it is the most technologically advanced building on earth, but hey it’s not Brooklyn.”
I realize that Fury, Pepper and Rhodey all seem a bit mean right now and unlike how they are Imin the movies. This is for the story but don’t worry I will fix it by the end. I really do like Fury and Tony’s weird friendship...? That they have in the movies.
“Oh I have to take you to this restaurant!” Steve said, and before Tony could protest, they were off.
A few days later Tony and Steve went out on another date. Tony took Steve to one of his more private restaurants. They both were enjoying a lovely evening when Steve got a call.
“Not over?” Steve scoffed, “Its either Tony dies or lives a bedridden life, with the constant threat of his heart giving out.”
“Whatever you want is good with me.” Steve smiled, still having a hard time believing he was going furniture shopping with Tony Stark, his boyfriend.
“So, it looks like a burger place is not going to be an option for our next date, because there is no way I can up this.” Tony said.
Steve walked out of the lab a bit sad that Tony didn’t want to talk, but determined not to let himself  be pushed away.
Steve wanted to tell them about the conversation he overheard with Pepper. He wanted them to understand the kind of stress Tony was dealing with.
“Yeah we used to all try and pitch in and buy each other things that our neighbors needed. We would just call out the windows and someone would pick something up for us.”
When Steve had asked to show Tony something, this is definitely not what he was expecting. Tony was at a loss for words, he knew exactly when each moment had happened from the paintings he was seeing. He tried to fight back the burning sensation in his eyes. It was ridiculous but it had been so long since someone had thanked him, let alone gone to such lengths to be so thoughtful.
Tony sighed and decided to open up about his strained friendships with Pepper and Rhodey. It felt good to get it off his chest, and the whole time Steve just listened and held him against his side.
“Oh yes of course, I would love to help you Bruce!” Steve smiled, “But now we need the other guys help.”
Another half hour went by of Tony working before Steve walked into the workshop. Tony was so deep in concentration that he didn’t notice Jarvis alert him of his arrival.
He kept on shooting blasts but there seemed to be no effect. Tony was beginning to panic, “Steve, baby don’t worry I’m gonna get this thing off you. Just hold on!”
Natasha was playing the ring toss game and Tony made the mistake of betting that she wouldn’t win. “Perfect aim is Birdbrain’s thing!” He claimed, confident.
“One second.” Donald smiled. He walked over and grabbed a camera that was mounted on a stand. He picked it up and put it on the other side of the table, opposite to where they were standing by Tony. He pressed it on to record and gave Justin a thumbs up.
“Tony, it took me a long time to get to the position I earned in the military.” He said crossing his arms, “You have to be responsible, and if you actually care about your team then you’ll take the job seriously.” Rhodey said with a frown.
The Gala started off excellently, Steve even volunteered to say a few words for the cause and that completely won the crowd over. After that there was a lot of mingling and dancing.
“No Tony I won’t. You can take it, I made sure it won’t kill you.” He said cupping Tony’s face in a mock loving gesture, “And besides this is just the first weapon, you have so much more to go through.” He smiled, then walked away, closing the door on a screaming Tony.
This is the beginning of some serious Tony whump. If you’re caught up you know he gets kidnapped. Warnings for waterboarding, arc reactor torture and violence with a knife. If this is triggering then please skip it. For those who don’t want to read I’ll include notes at the bottom of what specifically happened. I know arc reactor whump has been used before but I really wanted to include it here, also it will be important for later. Don’t worry! I know things seem bad but they won’t stay that way for long! And to the rest who do read, I hope you enjoy.
He rolled out of bed with a groan and quickly got ready. The faster he was ready, the less likely Pepper was to get mad at him. Although with the way things were going, it couldn’t get much worse.
He couldn’t believe they had said those things about him, all along that’s what they thought. And Steve…. he didn’t love Tony. God Tony loved him so much, with everything he had and it wasn’t enough. He felt his heart break when they said those hateful words, it was without a doubt their voices on the recording. It’s why they hadn’t come for him. Justin said he wasn’t hard to find. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever be okay again. Just goes to show that Tony Stark was hated and worthless.
Two weeks had gone by and Steve hungout in Tony’s workshop regularly. Tony was so surprised by this, normally anyone who came down would leave as quickly as possible without seeming rude.
A picture of a distraught Captain America covered in mud and a smiling Thor in a tourist hat was on every internet site the next day, and the next week for that matter.
In this chapter there’s the usual using Tony’s arc for energy. Then they manipulate Tony by showing him the news broadcast that reports that everyone think he’s dead. The Justin beats Tony and breaks his rib. Then he begins to whip Tony.
“That’s total bullshit Tony.” Steve said and Tony looked shocked. “The team absolutely loves you and I think you know that. And we’d all be happy to tell anyone of them a piece of our mind.” Steve the added, “We are the ones who don’t deserve you. Now come up and come spend dinner with your family.”
“Are you sure you want this…with me?” Tony asked, looking ashamed, “I understand if you don’t, I mean I’m me and you’re captain America, you deserve the best.”
“Oh I could never get sick of you, Rogers.” Tony smiled mischievously, “Plus I can think of a few ways to keep us from getting bored.” He said as he leaned in and kissed Steve deeply.
Steve chucked in response and pulled Tony against him, so that Tony’s head was pillowed on Steve’s chest. The skin on skin contact felt amazing. Steve couldn’t remember a time he felt so warm.
“Yeah.” Natasha said, smiling slightly. “Didn’t get much taking done, but there are a lot of activities that don’t require very much conversation.” She said smirking.
Something had changed with the team after the Gala movie night, it was as if a damn had been broken causing all of the Avengers to want to hangout much more than before. They were the only few people to know what it was like to be superheroes and after Steve’s speech, not only did they want to support one another, but they saw the importance of it.
“You sure you want to do this man?” Clint asked, “It could end in humiliating defeat or serious bodily harm.” He warned.
“It all makes sense now.” Tony said in mock delight, “Now I know why the shitty coding was familiar. It was your work that you wanted me to include for the Avengers. Oh wait what happened with that? Oh yeah I rejected it.” Tony sassed.
“Come on, Lories Pizza Parlor is just down the street.” He smiled, taking Tony’s hand and pulling him along.
“Harder!” Tony yelled, then Steve began to speed up and fuck him harder until they were both panting in each other mouths. Steve’s pelvis met Tony’s ass and the slapping of skin on skin and moans were all that could be heard.
“So, uh, I don’t really go in this room much but, what can I say? I’ve had a lot of inspiration lately and a lot of good things in my life.”
“You really do know how to make a guy feel better.” Tony smiled, “God I don’t deserve you.” Tony said snuggling into Steve, pressing his face into the crook of his neck.
“I just wanted to apologize for yesterday, I was stressed and took it out on you. You did an amazing job, it was no easy task and you did it.” He said putting an arm on his shoulder.
“Yes the Man of Iron is not only just a comrade but a brother to us all.” Thor said solemnly, “He gives us not only a shelter but a home.”
However when Steve didn’t say anything Tony panicked and grabbed Steve’s wrists, “But I’m okay I promise! I have enough energy for missions and to not make mistakes with building tech. Everything I do will be of the highest quality-”
“Good.” Steve said smiling, “Now I think it’s time for you to get some sleep. Jarvis told me  you are running on next to nothing except coffee.”
“I have to warn you though.” He said, in fake seriousness, “This weapon will be the longest yet in terms of powering. And it’s larger than the rest so it will be more painful than the others.” He smiled.
“Hell we wouldn’t even be here now if it weren’t for him!” Exclaimed Clint, “The Nuke would’ve blown us to bits, or it most likely would’ve.”
Tony held on tightly, it felt amazing to be hugged, burying his face in Steve’s chest. He felt better after spilling his guts and the knowledge that he wasn’t alone in his nightmares helped him feel more a part of the team.
“Wow well, that’s great that you’re comfortable saying it out loud. I figured something like that would be hard.” Tony said although he was internally reeling/screaming.
“Yeah yeah we get it, you’re super skilled.” Said Bruce dryly, “Steve, do you know if something happened?”
“Yes we are but this serum-I guess you could call it-would allow me and Hulk to communicate better and thus figure out when it is best for him to come out and not just react when I feel angry.” Bruce supplied.
Tony was about to turn and thank Steve for hanging out with him, but when he did their faces were only inches apart.
“You are still an important part of Stark Industries Tony. Besides you have responsibilities, you need to be a part of the meetings, it’s essential to knowing where everyone stands. You have to grow up.” Pepper replies sounding like this was the millionth time she had to explain this. Before Pepper looked back up a flash of hurt crossed Tony’s face before the irritation took its place.
Steve sighed smiling softly, “I just want to defend you Tony. You’ve had way to many people accuse you.”
Then Justin put-actually punched-the arc reactor back in place. He could feel the internal bruising.
They both learn so much about each other this way, coming together for comfort. Consequently, they become really close friends and the team starts to notice, none of them really mind because there are nights where they all hangout to help each other.
They headed into their room and all of a sudden Tony became emotional again. At Steve’s worried glance Tony explained.
It had been ten minutes since Donald left the room. Meaning now Tony was left alone with his thoughts. He tried to fight his restraints, more to distract himself than anything else, but he just tired out.
Thor Immediately jumped off the quinjet and landed in front of the alien and managed to wrestle Steve out of its hold. Tony grabbed onto Steve instantly while Thor shocked the alien with his lightning.
The next morning they woke up in each other’s arms. Tony began to stir and then Steve was quick to follow.
“You know what Rogers that’s it!” Tony exclaimed as he grabbed the ketchup and squirted the bottle at Steve who tried to duck away.
“Yes Clint that’s true.” Steve said, sighing. “I just think that everything else was blocking that out.”
Bruce just rolled his eyes, “Don’t listen to him.” He stared pointendly back at Clint. “We missed you buddy.” Clint just stuck his tongue out.
The bot whirred happily and spun around before quickly running away and handing Steve a wrench, which is what Tony had originally asked for.
Tony was working, thinking about how he had snapped at Steve and Thor. He didn’t mean to, it’s just after he found out that Pepper and Rhodey seemed to talk and spend time together without him, it hurt to see Steve and Thor getting close. He felt like everyone was getting along and no one wanted to spend any time with him. He was worried he was losing his friends, and Steve most of all.
Steve took a moment to reply. He wasn’t expecting Tony to be this open with him. “Howard was so different from the man I remembered. The man I knew was a happier man, someone I would’ve called a friend. It’s clear now that that’s not who he turned out to be. I’m sorry you had to be on the receiving end of that. No one deserves that but especially not you Tony.” Steve said sadly.
“You scared the shit out of me, Steve. I want to be mad but, well the only ones to be mad at are the those stupid octopus aliens.”
“So are you.” Steve said as he kissed Steve lightly on the lips. “You're okay right? I didn’t hurt you.”
“Okay I’m almost done!” He heard Tony grunt, “Okay it’s down.” The robot immediately shut off and crashed to the ground.
“I’ve never been more sure if anything-well other than you.” Steve smiled, “And I want to share that with the world, and give hell to anyone who disagrees.”
No one caught Bruce mumbling, a mix of exasperation and affection, “And yet we are the people they trust to save the planet.”
“Tony you are a hero. There is no denying that. Sure you made mistakes before in the past, but so has every member of this team. A hero is not someone who’s perfect, a hero is someone who became something more.” Steve looked down and took a deep breath, “I can’t comprehend why you look down on yourself so much, but I’m telling you, you turned your life around, you saved us all. Tony Stark is a hero.” Steve smiled.
“Tony that wasn’t your fault. You had no idea what was happening, and as soon as you did you stopped it.” Steve said forcefully.
Tony sighed contentedly and kissed Steve one last time on the cheek. Tony was so happy and elated. He felt like he had finally found his other half.
She reacted stiffly at first, the only one who she openly was affectionate with was Clint. However she recovered quickly and hugged him back.
“Oh yes that sounds great! I can take you to this new burger place that’s supposedly very good. Maybe I can convince you to stay.” Tony winked.
Steve was taken aback by the offer, Tony rarely let people in his workshop, let alone showed how he worked, “Are you serious?” Steve asked, “Tony that would be awesome.” Steve smiled excitedly.
“Mmm well I think we made good headway today.” Steve said, kissing Tony. They kissed for a quick minute before a sales click cleared their throat.
Then Donald flipped the switch to the weapon on and said, “Hope you have fun.” With a sadistic smile.
“Oh god.” Steve said as he picked up a note that was left in the rubble. It read: Your resident tech builder is out of commission.
Tony beamed at the mention of the word boyfriend and took Steve’s face in his hands. “Yes, yes and yes.” Tony said swallowing a lump in his throat, this time from happiness. “God, Steve I want everything with you, please come to me too, we both need to be equals in this.”
Tony couldn’t remember a time when he had company like this in the workshop and on top of that, Steve genuinely seemed to like Tony. They were quickly becoming friends and started to learn new things about each other.
Tony hadn’t really left his lab since his… fight..? talk…? With Steve. He didn't exactly know what to think or how to feel. He wasn’t sure if Steve was just trying to keep an eye on him because he thought he was a loose cannon or if it was something else.
“Okay, yeah I understand.” Tony said smiling softly, then tightening his hold on Steve’s hands he added, “There just isn’t a gift I don’t want to give you. God knows you deserve the world. But I’ll try not to be extremely overwhelming.”
Then he took out a bottle with two grey pills, “Normally a procedure like this would make you pass out but this special medicine will keep you awake and alert to feel all of it. Think of it almost as a cross between liquid energy and adrenaline.” He said, then forced him to swallow the pills roughly.
In order to distract himself he attempted to find a weak spot in his bindings or any tools in the trunk but there was nothing.
Steve looked up at his boyfriend’s now shining eyes, “Tony don’t you dare blame yourself! I screwed up, I wasn’t paying attention and I got myself caught. You did what you could do and without you, so many people could’ve been killed. Plus we didn’t even have our full team until the very end. You took over and told Thor and Clint what to do. You did great.”
He had been in the workshop for about an hour, working on upgrading Steve’s suit when Jarvis interrupted him,
“The second is that I am working on some new… tech if you will, and I need a more stronger power source than I currently have.” He began walking towards Tony, “That is where you come in.” He said, tapping Tony’s arc reactor. “I am going to connect my machines to your arc reactor and take its energy, which will be extremely painful.” He added smiling, “Then after you power my machines, the world will have no need for Stark Tech and neither will I. You will be replaced in the technology business and no one will remember you.” He smiled, “So then I’ll hand you over to an associate of mine who will decide what he wants to do with you.” He smiled, “You can come in now.” He said into a walkie he picked up.
Knowing that Tony needed a distraction, Steve pulled out his sketchbook, “Hey Tony, look this is a sketch of my favorite park at Brooklyn, one time Bucky and I thought it would be fun to race to the top so we climbed up the tree but then I ran out of energy and I couldn’t come down so they had to call the firemen to help me. When I got home my ma yelled at me.” Steve said wistfully, “I was in so much trouble.”
“I think I’m the lucky one.” Tony said as he grabbed Steve’s face and pulled him in for another breathtaking kiss.
The thing was that no one had ever needed Steve. Before the serum he was just Steve, a sickly burden, the only time he became useful was when he was Captain America. That’s who the world worshipped and that’s who the Avengers relied on.
“So basically we are going to give him the blood the same as we would do with fluids in an IV. It’s the most direct way and that way we can control the amounts.”
Everyone in the room scoffed, except for Natasha, “One more word out of you and I’m making you sleep outside.”
“I worry about you and the team all the time, hence my insanity on the field.” He added to lighten the mood.
“Yeah,” agreed Clint, “And you know what else was weird? When Pepper came in I felt like she was mad at him.”
Donald looked a mix of humiliated an terrified, which was an excellent look on him if Tony did say so himself.
“It’s okay guys, just thanks.” Tony said looking down, he still hadn’t completely recovered from the battle.
Steve stiffened in surprised and Tony panicked, horrified that he overstepped. As he started to back away Steve relaxed and tightened his arms, wrapping Tony in a bear hug.
“Hey now don’t be rude Clint. Keep that up and you’ll be locked out of this tower to fend for yourself.” Wanted Natasha who had just walked in.
A few days later Steve and Tony decided to go out for furniture shopping. It was a little silly, considering the tower was furnished to the nines, but Tony insisted. He wanted the place to be theirs and he mostly picked his furniture for the sake of appearance. Tony Stark was flashy and rich so that’s what his apartment needed to be.
“That’s great! Maybe you could come with me to a pride parade if you’re ready, because I’m bisexual too.” Tony said while looking down. “And it really does do wonders to help the cause when famous people show up. Can’t imagine what would happen if you did.”
He was brought out of his thoughts when Donald entered the room. He clapped his hands together with a huge smile, “So Tony, I bet you’re wondering why you’re here. Well the first reason is that one, I hate you.” He all but spat.
“We also need you to know that we kept the arc reactor in you but you no longer need it.” Brice said suddenly.
The cloth was abruptly pulled off of him, leaving him to cough and swallow in gallons of air. He had to, he might not get another chance.
“Tony tony relax, I’m not mad.” Steve said, placing his hands on Tony’s shoulders, cutting off the downhill rambling, “I definitely don’t think that that’s why you asked me to move in. I know you aren’t like that and I never will think that.” Tony Immediately relaxed. “I was going to ask you about the same thing, I really want to be closer with you. I would love to, tonight or any other night.” Steve said, cupping Tony’s face and kissing him deeply.
One would think that Tony and Steve would be complete opposites when buying furniture, but that was not the case at all. Turns out Tony likes simple and comfortable as much as Steve.
“You know.” Tony said looking at their joined hands, “I know that I have a bit of a reputation, but this is real to me.” He said looking at Steve in the eyes to make sure Steve knew he was serious.
As he slowly came to consciousness, his memories returned. Donald, the arc being used; Hammer and the torture and beatings.
“I’ll be taking you to a warehouse where we will spend a few days bonding.” Tony looked down and shut his eyes, “And then I will be taking you to your new home where no one will be bothering us!” He exclaimed.
“What are you talking about? Of course I have to! We have to be prepared for the worst and  that means having the best tech and suits available. And that doesn’t happen by sitting on my ass.” Tony replied frustrated.
Captain B. McCrea was arguing with AUTO and that part freaked Steve out a little. When AUTO knocked over the captain off the ship Steve asked Jarvis, “You would never do that to us right Jarvis?”
“Ah yes running a company does take a lot of hard work.” Replied Pepper still smiling, “Come on Tony we have to go.”
It had been two weeks. Two weeks of endless searching for Tony and they were no closer to finding him. That’s when they got the news, blood had been found at the scene of an accident at an empty building.
“Ah if it isn’t the famous Tony Stark, it has been so long since I’ve seen you fellow comrade” Thor said, pulling Tony into a bear hug, “Tell me Man of Iron, do you still have my chamber from last time?”
“Oh and Bruce you’re on standby, if worse comes to worse, we will call a code green. But for now just try and help Tony figure out the bomb from base.”
Natasha got up and walked out of the room, sensing this was a moment they needed alone. She hoped the boys had finally got their heads out of their asses.
“Oh yeah that was me, Tony, I was a real drama queen who needed the spotlight at all times.” Steve said sassily.
“No, none of that Tony,” Steve interjected, “She was helping me out, nothing more. I told you that you are the one I want to be with Tony.” He said, reaching out to grab his hand.
So Tony spent the next two hours explaining how his tech worked and how he developed the ideas. Steve was actually able to follow along and became increasingly impressed as he began to understand just how incredible Tony’s mind was.
Jarvis was instrumental to them, he knew everything about Tony and his health so he made the most educated guesses about how much blood to give Tony and how to make it the most compatible with Tony as it could be.
Steve sputtered, “Betrothed...what-No guys! This wasn't a date! But I do want to talk to you about Tony.” Steve said quickly.
After Steve helped a disgruntled Tony clean up, he managed to win Tony a plush Iron Man toy by hitting the high striker as far as it could go.
He was adding a tree to his sketch of his favorite park in Brooklyn when he heard someone come into the kitchen.
Tony laid there, shocked, humiliated and hurt beyond words. He cried from an entirely different pain that night.
“Hey,” he said grabbing Tony’s arm, “You have us now. And I’m sorry you didn’t have the childhood you deserved.”
The kiss was passionate and breathtaking. Steve didn’t need anymore explanation from Tony, they were both overwhelmed in the best possible way.
Steve’s cheeks tinted pink, but before he could reply Thor shouted in shock, “Captain! Is it true? Are you betrothed to our Man of Iron?”
Understanding crossed Tony’s face and he proceeded to explain how his armor worked to Steve and they both felt much better.
“Wow Steve that’s incredible. It sounds like you had some amazing people in your life.” Tony said looking down, “I’m sorry you had to leave it behind.” He added.
“Yes that is what I believe.” Bruce said, “The damage comes from electricity and it not only hurt the reactor but the area around it. We think there is damage to his heart. The reactor was used improperly, it's meant to help Tony’s heart and Tony built the suits especially for the reactor so that’s why it’s never damaged him before. But after whatever they did to him, the reactor eventually stopped working like it did before. So some of the shrapnel managed to break loose.” Bruce sighed. “We can replace his reactor but Tony’s heart is damaged and we don’t know what the long term effects will be. We could fix him and his heart could still be overworked. My guess is that we could fix it with surgery but his heart would give out, and that’s without going out to be a hero.”
“Goodnight, love.” He said with his eyes closed, however Steve didn’t fail to notice the light blush that spread on his lovers cheeks.
After that last conversation with Tony went downhill, Steve decided to give the other man some space. He decided to do the one other thing that could help clear his mind: drawing. He grabbed his sketch pad and started drawing whatever came to mind, his old childhood home in Brooklyn came to mind first. After that he drew his shield-but not the way everyone knows it to be: shiny and perfect. He detailed it with scratches and scars specific from every battle that had held a special meaning. The vibranium metal was resilient but that didn’t mean he was. He moved on to the next sketch, Tony’s arc reactor. He started off with in the center and made his way out and before he knew it, an hour had passed. Once he was finished he felt like he would finally be able to talk to Tony.
“No Tony there isn’t anything I need you to sign.” Pepper sighed pinching the bridge of her nose, “I have been asking for weeks that you finish your clean energy stabilizer for Stark Industries and you still haven’t done it.” She said sounding frustrated.
“Director. We have reason to believe Justin could be holding Tony at a warehouse just outside of New York. The place was under the name of a distant relative of Donald Henderson, the creator of the robots who took Tony.” Natasha quickly supplied.
After that everyone went to get on with their day and Steve set out to clean the kitchen. He was washing dishes when Tony walked into the kitchen looking exhausted.
Steve was so surprised by this, he didn’t know what to say “Well gee Tony, that’s just swell. Thank you. Maybe Tony Stark does have a heart.” Steve teased.
Bruce sighed, “Okay, So I managed to stabilize Tony for the time being. I was able to give him some more blood and we are working on fixing his rib which was broken.” He paused, “But that’s not our biggest issue here. Whatever happened to Tony was bad… there’s severe damage to the arc reactor.” Everyone winced at that. “It seems to me that someone used it to power something.
Just as he was about to insert himself in the conversation, Donald-an asshat who Tony had to play nice with-came up to him.
“Yes there is a warehouse on the outskirts of New York under the name of a distant relative. However I had to hack into several servers to find that.”
He was stuck with the physical and emotional pain. All he could do was cry and hope that help would come.
Tony sucked in a deep breath, “Yeah it’s just aliens and I aren’t really a good mix.” He took another deep breath, “When I found out we would be fighting aliens it made me think of the wormhole. And then leaving you or losing you is just too much.” Tony said shaking.
“Get out where?” Tony asked rubbing his face, he wanted to run up to Steve, but they hadn’t talked about how they would act in front of the others, or in public for that matter. He wouldn’t blame Steve if he wanted to keep it a secret, if he were Steve he probably wouldn’t want people knowing he was dating Tony Stark. All those doubts washed away as soon as Steve spoke.
Steve was so happy that Tony agreed to go out with him. He half expected the man to go hideout in his workshop. He quickly figured out that his excitement wasn’t just coming from taking a friend out, he knew he had feelings for Tony but he didn’t want to mess up their friendship.
“They um… Donald-he.” Tony took a deep breath, “He strapped me to a table and I couldn’t move and they used the arc reactor to power his weapons. And god Steve, it felt like it was burning me alive and sucking the life out of me at the same time. It was probably the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t escape it, I could only cry in pain and it never stopped. I begged them to stop and they wouldn’t.” Tony said, tears flowing freely down his face.
And they all stormed out of SHIELD headquarters, ready to find Tony and end anyone who got in their way.
“I wouldn’t take that personally. He’s very invested and probably doesn’t want to tell anyone just in case it doesn’t work.” Steve explained, running a hand through his hair.
Tony tried to picture Steve again, if these were his last few moments then he wanted to see Steve before it was all over.
He cried out when he realized that he had been kidnapped and that he had no idea if the other Avengers were okay.
They ended up getting takeout from an old Thai place, but before they ate Steve made Tony “Hike 50 miles through the wilderness to Steve’s favorite tree.” -Tony’s words, not his.
“I think maybe Steve and Tony could use some alone time.” Bruce said, “Unless you have questions Tony.”
Steve groaned, “You will be the death of me.” He said, grabbing Tony’s hands and rubbing them. “Go to the table, it’s almost done.”
Right at that moment the rest of the Avengers piled in and damn, they cleaned up nice. Tony’s eyes immediately went to Steve and they both looked at each other at the same time.
At Bruce’s confused expression, Thor quickly filled him in, “Anthony is gravely injured, we needed to get him here as soon as possible.”
Steve and Tony go furniture shopping...but not everything goes as planned. Hope you like! We will have a much longer chapter coming up.
Just as he was settling in to look it over the power cut out. “What? Jarvis what’s going on?” Tony asked.
They were laughing hysterically and Tony decided to grab an apple from the tree and throw it at Steve, they both picked leaves from the tree and threw them at each other until eventually Steve gave up, “Okay Tony! You win, I yield!” He shouted and then dramatically flung himself off the branch.
“It already is.” Steve said, pulling Tony to him  by the waist, “But yes I’d love to go shopping with you.”
“Okay now that we’ve gotten past the awkward hellos.” Tony said, “Can we just get to the nitty gritty.”
Steve had loved the movie, it was definitely one of his favorites. The love story between Wall-e and Eva was just way too adorable. He could also relate to Wall-e, sometimes Steve felt older and out of date. He couldn’t get over how cute Wall-e was though!
Bruce had just come in again, to go over Tony’s progress with Jarvis, when Tony himself began to stir.
“Wow someone is being extra affectionate tonight.” Tony said, but everyone could see the huge smile on his face.
Steve just rolled his eyes and said “Okay, Tony.” And turned to look at Thor, who sat on Steve’s other side.
Steve walked into the tower exhausted, the mission was a success but there was some unexpected fighting towards the end.
“So I was thinking maybe you’d want a bath… and if you’re up for it the team wants to have a movie night. I can make you your favorite cheeseburgers and we can all just relax. But if you want the night to yourself then I totally understand.”
Steve added a second finger, then a third, scissoring Tony and stretching him out. Tony was so tight and Steve was so hard, he would never forget the sensation of feeling him.
Nights like these were usually when he couldn’t stop thinking about Bucky and Peggy and how much he missed them. This was the first night however when he found himself not wishing he could go back. As much as he loved them, he was finding space in his heart for his new team. He smiled when he thought of the other night when Thor, Tony and himself were all practically snuggling with each other.
They all shared one massive piece of multicolored cotton candy. Tony managed to get some revenge by sneakily putting cotton candy on Natasha’s crown that she had one by breaking the record on the ring toss-but he had a feeling Natasha let him.
“Well I think it would be better if we went at night.” Tony said slowly, crossing his arms,“It’s less crowded that way.”
“Holy shit that did not just happen!” Clint shouted, “Someone call the history book authors!” He shouted.
“It’s okay Cap, don’t worry about me. The big guy and I have been doing better, oh also remember that serum I was telling you about? I’ll need your help with it soon if you can.” Bruce replied shyly.
“Yes.” Said Agent Coulson, “Your priority is to minimize the damage and destroy that thing as soon as possible.”
Tony sighed and rubbed his face. He thought about the battle, it had mostly gone well, aside from the fact that he wasn’t fucking fast enough to keep Natasha from getting hurt. And oh yeah, the fact that Steve had yelled at him. It didn’t help that he figured out he was having feelings for the other man. There’s no way Steve would ever feel the same, how could anyone like him? He wondered if Steve regretted making him a co-leader. God why couldn’t he do anything right? Now Steve was mad at him.
“Ha ha ha, very funny,” Tony replied dryly “We are the perfect unit, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Moments after Tony saw the hologram a warm feeling settled in his chest. He had no idea that that’s what the team really thought. At best, he considered himself lucky to even be part of the team, thinking he was only tolerated because of his money and tech.
