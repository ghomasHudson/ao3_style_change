“That’s the thing, it’s her fault, that stuff. She got kicked out of the squad for going out with me, that’s why she wasn’t at the game on Saturday. But she didn’t want Dean making a big deal out of it, so she asked me not to say anything to him. Which means not saying it to Dad. And I guess the cheerleaders wanted to make me feel bad about dating her too,”
“And Sam. He hasn’t said much, but I don’t think he’s impressed that I’m considering taking you back.”
Faith knew he was trying to avoid bringing up the idea that she was raised in an orphanage, afraid of insulting her.
“Uncle Cas?” Jack finally spoke. “Maybe pace yourself, Claire will combust before we make it to breakfast.”
“Why are you dragging yourself through the gutter? You’re far too old to have your rebellious phase.”
“The principal of our entire school!” He did an almost perfect impression of Patience’s uptight reaction.
“Are you going to see Patience some time this week?” Claire asked. She hadn’t been intending to ask anything like it, and she wasn’t sure what it was that made her ask it, but suddenly it seemed important to ask.
“Don’t push it, Faith. You see what you see because you’re our daughter. Other people wouldn’t feel the same.”
Because of this, it is actually hard to find a lot of concrete evidence about the Sacred Band, and so beyond the basic facts I absorbed, I tried to piece together life from my experience in Athens, the histories and myths and legends I had known since I was taught in school as a kid, media accounts that are available and whatever other sources I could find including the Iliad and the Odyssey.
'You know what, Dax? I don't want to talk about it.' And she reached over, and turned the music up even louder than before. Dax had clearly underestimated how much Gabriel's words - and his own - were bothering her.
Castiel took the makeshift ice pack away from his lip for Dean to inspect, though he kept his distance. After all, Dean had been the cause of these injuries. Castiel had thought that Dean was about to kill him with an angel blade, and had barely escaped that injury. He had lain in the main room of the bunker for a good hour, replaying the scene before Dean had shown a glimpse of remorse and offered to help nurse the injuries that he had created. That Cain’s Mark had made. Castiel had to believe that it wasn’t Dean who would hurt him so badly, who would even consider ending Castiel’s existence. He had to believe it was Dean who aimed the blade at the book in the end. If he didn’t believe that, his heart would break.
“Who is that man, Claire?” Her grandfather asked, while Claire passed the cup of tea. Her grandmother held it, but didn’t drink from it. And once again, she wondered how much she was meant to reveal. No one else knew they were engaged, they hadn’t even organised rings - why should her grandparents get to hear it first?
“Ugh, fine, if it makes Dean feel like he’s part of the family and accepted and junk, I’ll do it.” Claire grinned at her father. He wrinkled his nose in happiness, and picked up his own taco, taking a bite.
“What do you think she would think of this place?” Claire asked him now. “Of living in the cemetery?”
He pushed the thoughts out of his mind as the fight in front of him was called off, and the victor was rewarded by his erastes with a long kiss. Dean stepped forward, and controlled his breathing as he took the measure of the soldier opposite him. Dean had two years of training on this man, and he knew he favoured a low cut, near the knees. Benny had trained him well, and treated him even better.
“Mrs Winchester, I’m not local to here. Dean and I will have a lot to consider. We might have jumped into marriage but the rest we’re taking our time on.”
“I’ll manage. But you might get lucky and sell me a soldering iron for a five hundred per cent mark up.”
There was a silence in the room, as Sam and Becky both processed what Castiel was telling them. Castiel could hear the hum of the fluorescent light above them as they tried to understand.
“We know. Dean hasn’t stopped talking about you. I think. I don’t know, I keep looking away from him.”
Castiel waited until Dean had left again to allow himself to think. For all everyone said about Dean getting his empathy from his mother, it seemed incorrect. Dean had so much compassion, so much understanding. Or maybe it was just because he did love Castiel so much, though he barely acknowledged it even now. But Castiel knew that he wasn’t ready to return home to Mary’s frosty reception. Instead, he zapped himself to another place he would be welcomed.
He rarely touched Dean in this way, hands working their way through his pubic hair. Dean normally wanted other things, he wanted to be in control. But now he was letting Castiel set the tone, even as he sucked on his fiancé’s neck, biting and licking the small patch of skin.
“AMBUSH! AMBUSH! GET UP!” They both started yelling, their voices overlapping as they tried to raise the alarm.
“But Cas? It’ll get easier. I mean, it’s not the best feeling in the world, but you have Dean. That’s not changing. That’ll make it easier. The way Sam makes so many things easier for me,” she smiled again, and Sam kissed the crown of her head as he walked past. Castiel could see her point. Sam had gone from not liking Becky, to being completely averse to her, to tentatively dating her, to now being so in love that it didn’t matter what Dean thought. Sam was with Becky. Maybe there was hope. Maybe he would never be Mary Winchester’s favourite, but he was still Dean’s, and that had to be enough.
Dean kneeled down in front of him, caressing his hair with one hand while stroking his bicep with the other.
They fell quiet, watching the people they loved bonding, getting along, dancing and laughing and talking non-stop.
At the door, Castiel couldn’t resist a goodbye kiss, one that lingered, one that was sweet and full of more of those unspoken words. Dean walked inside with the same dazed look on his face that he had the first time they kissed, and Castiel took a moment to watch him before returning to the car. He sidled up close to the partition once inside, and rested his head on the edge as Kevin started the car.
“Oh man, what did I just eat?” Dean snorted, and speared a cube of potato jelly for Castiel, holding it close to his mouth. “Eat this. Is it for real?”
Claire stepped closer, reaching in to her bag for the two rings, passing one to Dean, and the other to Castiel. She gave her father a tight hug.
“Dean,” he sighed, and melted into his husband’s arms. The world could have ended right then and Castiel wouldn’t even notice, because Dean’s embrace was his idea of Heaven. Fortunately, Dean didn’t seem to be in any hurry to end their embrace either, but he did start talking to Emmanuel.
He passed it over as though it were a fragile treasure, and Claire took it apprehensively. She lifted the lid, and was surprised to see neat rows of envelopes. She lifted one, and saw her father’s tidy cursive, her name and old address, and a postal stamp dated three years before. She looked up at him.
“Well, don’t. I take my oath seriously. And even if we didn’t swear fealty to each other, I would still look to protect you above all else. But if you fall, then I do too. Even if my body still moves and my heart still pumps and my brain still thinks, if you go, then my soul is in the underworld with yours.”
“We don’t know anyone in this town,” Dean said over his shoulder. “And I haven’t seen Cas in three days.”
“I suppose so,” Castiel drew out the words, sounding puzzled. “I would have to ask father Apollo to appeal to the council to be sure. Why would you wish to return?”
“Don’t freak out,” she said as she got even closer. Claire took a deep breath in, and let it out slowly.
Dean stared at Castiel, as though his eyes could communicate what he himself could not at that point. He knew he wanted to say something about his priority being his family, but even he wasn't sure what that would entail. He also wanted to point out that most angels were douchebags and he didn't care about what went on, really. But he knew well enough to know that telling Castiel that would upset him too much.
But if he didn’t go for it, then what? Castiel would spend his life regretting it, and he couldn’t bear the idea of going to all these functions alone. Meg had grudgingly agreed to some of them, but he hadn’t pushed her to agree to more than the bare minimum, knowing she would hate it as much as he did. And he didn’t want anyone else, he wanted Dean. He
'Oh, come on Dax! Faith might believe the bullshit, but I'm not that naive.' Stevie shook her hair back, into the wind coming over the windscreen.
“No. You’re allowed to change your mind, or do something for you. And if you’re talking yourself into the basics of a relationship then it doesn’t sound like a good start.”
“The plan should work,” Dean insisted. He finally turned to look at Castiel, standing up from Faith’s bed and approaching the angel slowly. “There’s seven of us, and two of them.”
Faith stopped moving, leaning up against a tree. She heard the words Gabriel hadn't said. Her mission had already been declared.
She clutched his arm as they walked up to the front door, where a young man was sitting outside on the porch, just watching people arrive. Emma pushed away from Dean at the last minute.
'Because it took me this long to work out what you were, why you were so interested in me. I thought you were my father, come back for me. But you're not. He's an angel. You're a human, but you seem to know more than most. Hunter, am I right?'
'It's a cycle, like Sam said. I never live past fifty. One drop is enough for a cycle. Sam's probably holding three thousand years in that tiny bottle.'
Or even, if Castiel wanted to reach into really unlikely fantasies, this kiss would end and he would have the words to say how much he missed Dean and how much it hurt not to hear from him. How Meg had offered a solution by marrying her and it was knee-jerk but he had only needed a sign from Dean to call it off. How it felt like Dean had spent so long being angry with him and he had no idea what he had done to incite that anger. But how grateful he was for this kiss, for the feel of Dean’s stubble against his - which Gabriel was correct, Castiel loved - and for Dean coming with no other agenda than talking to him.
“Thank you.” She took another sip of her drink. “How long are you both here until you finally move to Maine?”
“You’ve still got the kids,” Claire pointed out. The girl leaned into the crook of Alex’s neck shyly, and they both looked down at Kieran, who had emptied out an entire shelf.
“There is, Gabriel. You saw me come. Do you see a boat on the beach? You must know where I’ve come from. Don’t lie to someone from Olympus.”
Castiel pursed his lips as he thought. He had had the cat for nine years, and he’d known Dean three weeks. But Emmanuel could look after his cat; there was no way his twin would step in with his husband.
“There is. The weather is gorgeous and I thought it might be fun. I can spend my time in a tube on the lazy river and you two can enjoy yourselves. Bathing suits are in the trunk, and towels. The ceramics was for me, but this is for the both of you.”
“Keep your make up sex down, okay?” She gave them her parting shot. Neither of them laughed, and when she peaked back they were both slurping up their coffee, though Castiel had reached his hand further along the bed to rub a finger along Dean’s arm. She went back to her room, where Alex was sitting up in her bed.
She started moving away, almost gliding across the floor. Sam and Castiel hurried to keep up with her, hoping that the science fiction section was less populated. Flora didn't seem to realise that she had inadvertedly met Sam Winchester.
“And my dad is a great person. He listens when I have a problem and he talks through issues and he’s just … he’s great. I don’t know everything that went on when he left, but I know my dad, and he doesn’t deserve this.”
“Ye-yes. Yes, of course, Mr Novak, sir!” The girl was breathless on the other end of the line. “Dean Winchester?”
Castiel spared his brother one look of pure venom, before he searched for Dean, feeling for some part of his essence that he could pick up on and travel towards, and then he too left Gabriel’s office.
Dean held her tightly, both of them oblivious to the attention the others around their small camp were giving them.
“Which is how you got your nose broken,” Jack frowned, like he was doing the math, working out how it all fit together. “So, either you’re in the wrong for telling Uncle Dean that she was kicked off the squad or you’re in the wrong because you didn’t and she’s been unfairly suspended for it?”
Kevin nodded, and Castiel left him in the entrance hall to look for the keys to a car that perhaps wouldn’t be missed by his eldest siblings.
“Claire, if you need anything,” Castiel spoke urgently. “Call me. I’ll leave the place if it’s noisy, but I will pick up. Even if you just need to tell me I’m a massive jerk.”
Dean’s thoughts went back to near silence, and Castiel felt frustrated. Had Dean already learned how to shut him out of his thoughts?
“I don’t know what I’m trying to say. I know what you’ve said about identifying as ace and I remember thinking the same about myself at one point which is why I had that book in the first place. I guess I’m saying, you’re not moving too fast for you, are you?”
“Hmmm.” Jack started playing with a lock of her hair. “I’m sure they have a reason for staying away, Claire. You do wear an armour, maybe they think you’re okay.”
Alex wrinkled her nose and slipped her hand from Claire’s, pulling out the desk chair and grabbing Claire’s vanity seat so that they could sit side by side and work.
“Well, maybe for Alex, she’s considered all the things you have both gone through, and she knows that regardless of all the hormonal crap, you’re worth fighting for?” Dean tried.
Gabriel looked annoyed, but did what he was asked, leaving Dean alone with Sam. They smiled weakly at each other, before Sam pushed his own hair back from his face.
Claire didn’t want to talk with someone who used the word ‘like’ every time they inhaled, and thank goodness, their teacher walked in before she had to. She got on with her work, even as classmates who barely gave her the time of day tried to slip her notes. Unfortunately, her teacher spotted the girl next to her trying to hand her one of them and swooped in, grabbing the note and unfolding it. And then, in a classic asshole-teacher move, read the damn thing out.
“There’s nothing wrong with people knowing you love him.” Faith whispered. Something like irritation, or guilt, flickered across Dean’s face.
Castiel had been walking down a hallway, towards the board room hidden behind an old Greek statue. He had presumed that no one but other board members were in the gallery, but obviously he was mistaken. He ducked behind a formaldehyde structure, and peeked out into the room where the voice was coming from. There were two men moving around, dragging sculptures into place. The slightly taller of the two, and slightly thinner, wiped his forehead and gestured across the room, away from where Castiel was hiding.
'Focus on the baby, Faith. I'm sure he's fine in the basement. Someone brought him some water earlier.'
It sounded like his Dean again. Not the stranger who had hurt him. And now Castiel had the choice, to deflect the way he had always done, or to finally admit the truth. He hoped that maybe if he admitted his true feelings, maybe Dean would show some remorse, would channel his grief at losing Charlie properly, would take Castiel’s advice on getting rid of the mark more seriously. Maybe, if Dean knew what was at stake, he would understand Castiel’s reaction better.
“Not the stuff about Amelia, I don’t know enough about her, but I’ve said before, I get what it’s like to lose a Mom.”
When their bodies had burned, and there was nothing but ash left; they dug a hole, and buried the remains of Sam and Gabriel together. Dean heaped the soil back over the ash, and Castiel laid a stone with their names over the mound. They stood together silently, looking at the overturned soil until it was time to return to Olympus.
'So, why's God let you bust out of Heaven for the night, hmmm?' Dean croaked as Castiel added teeth to the patch of neck he was concentrating on. Dean was sure to have a hickey, right under his jawline for the entire world to see the next morning, but he didn't care. He'd been wanting this for too damn long. He groaned loudly again as Castiel nibbled along his chin, arching his back and grinding his groin up into Castiel.
“Maybe if you stick around she’ll wake up and you can ask her yourself?” Jack sounded hopeful, like Claire would take the opportunity to blink her eyes open and greet her girlfriend. She made a snuffling sound and moved her head on the pillow instead.
They were at a stalemate, Claire could tell. And she was done with the evening. All she wanted to do was crawl into bed and stare blankly at BoJack Horseman until she fell asleep. And to get there, she had to tell Sam what he wanted to hear.
Castiel hadn’t expected Dean to apologise. What did he have to apologise for? It was Castiel’s brothers acting up, after all. He forced himself to speak.
“Can we have a rule where you don’t phase into our house?” he put down the paper he’d been reading, as Becky began to gasp. “Are you okay?”
The book was deliberately unhelpful, as far as Claire could see. Everything seemed like such a grey area with asexuality, there was no one definition that fit all. She dropped it and clutched her head, trying to process.
“Okay. Well, to avoid becoming insanely jealous of this Jack guy and to make sure Patience stops having a heart attack every time I’m in the same room as her, should I order in some food?”
It was finally the day before the wedding, and since the early morning, the entire family had been on the go, making sure that everything was prepared. Claire had been working with Sam on making sure everyone’s outfits for the next day were in their rooms, and checking that everyone who was meant to be arriving from out of state was. Dean and Castiel had hired a mansion to house their guests, and host the wedding and reception, and Claire barely had the time to appreciate the surroundings, so sure she was going to get lost on her way around.
“This is not about Dad! Geez, you have to stop! I’ve seen the crap Mom and Dad sent each other, okay? I know Dad tried to see me, and he’s been guilty for years about Mom. Stop playing the victim, God! I’m going to go and help Dean help Gram, and if you loved her you would do the same and to hell with stupid rumours or who Dad sleeps with.”
They stared at each other for a moment, and then Claire ran her spoon through the milk in her cereal bowl.
He slumped on the floor when it finally finished crawling in, making him consume every molecule. And then he could feel a sensation similar to pins and needles, working its way through every cell of his being, the sensation growing more and more intense until it made his vessel rigid, and a bright white-blue light shone from every orifice for a matter of moments. And then it was gone, and Castiel lay with his head buried in the thick red weave of the carpet, eyes closed as though he could shut out the obvious truth. As though he couldn’t sense Gabriel, still standing so close, trying to communicate with him without words. As though he couldn’t feel his wings wrapped around himself, soft and tender and a bittersweet comfort. Gabriel crouched down beside him on the floor, slipping a hand underneath a wing and squeezing his little brother’s shoulder.
“Yeah, we thought we saw some lip-lock action.” His shorter, pudgier friend looked at them both eagerly. Claire and Alex swapped a look, which Claire was hoping meant the same to her girlfriend. Do they explain it? Do they deny it? They just wanted to be together, not to perpetuate the gossip mill.
Claire looked down at her feet. Maybe Castiel wasn’t the most understanding person she could have discussed this with.
They appeared in the room together, Gabriel crashing into the seat beside Castiel as Dean stood near his mother.
‘I nixed lilies already. Association with death. Funeral flower. And I know, I know, everyone’s going to be mourning the fact that I’m off the market, but still, no lilies.’
'Well, you were a great help there, thanks Cas,' Dean finally snapped. Sam and Gabriel looked between them, their own conversation obviously interrupted.
“Are you trying to tell me that this is some kind of experiment? That you don’t even know if it’s going to work?”
“Yeah. She’s tried everything to find my real family, and nothing’s happened. And apparently it’s been long enough that even if they’re out there, she can legally adopt me. Jody’s going to be my mom for real.”
“But on the first day it was a partridge in a pear tree. On the twelfth day it was twelve drummers drumming, eleven pipers piping, ten-”
Claire nodded, and watched as she was transformed into a girly girl. It was a strange sensation. After the hair, the assistant opened the door and she walked out. Dean and her father were standing close together, talking softly, but they both turned as she walked out, Castiel’s face softening into a soppy expression as he leaned against Dean. Even Dean looked like he was close to tears.
Claire didn’t mind Alex accosting her at school so much. It turned out you can bond a lot with someone when you lose Monopoly to your English teacher. But also, Alex hadn’t asked too much about her mom, or probed too much into Dean and Castiel’s relationship, and Claire liked that. Plus, Alex was a total brain so it made tackling homework easier when she was around.
“He said you were irrelevant and I was too old for a rebellious phase. But you’re not, you’ll never be irrelevant.”
“And that’s all you have to say?” Castiel stood his ground. “Dean, after everything we’ve been through-”
Dean hung up the phone, and looked across the room at Castiel, who was frowning at him from the mattress.
'Daddy?' Faith interrupted timidly. 'Don't get mad. Please. It's bad enough … please, Dad, I need you right now.'
Castiel let the compress fall onto the table, just looking at Dean. He couldn’t tell if Dean was trying to be argumentative or whether there was a potential for them to try a relationship. He didn’t want to upset Dean when he was already so volatile, but he also didn’t want to let the opportunity go. After a few moments of staring between them, Dean reached across and lifted the compress. Castiel flinched before the cold was back on his face, and then he relaxed slightly.
'Relax, I only did it because Dean choked. It wasn't the same deal, Faith. She grew up in three days by women who set out to kill their fathers. Your situation is so different. We're going to protect you, I promise.'
“Still, how do you think it must feel? To want to be with him and know that she can’t, not properly?”
It became too much, and he looked away, concentrating on his shirt cuffs, deliberately straightening them, trying to focus on this one task and not everything else that would come from the day. The more he adjusted them, the calmer he was likely to feel … surely?
“Not too far! But this apartment was fine when it was just you and I, and then with Dean moving in … and now Jack … it’s not built for so many people. It’s not fair that Jack just has a couch. And the Winchester family home is so big, too big for just Sam and Eileen … they’re talking about moving into Eileen’s place, which is smaller. We could have the Winchester house, and Charlie could rent this apartment. Her lease is almost up on her apartment and it would mean I could trust the person living above the store. What do you think?”
“But it’s different, with you,” Claire interrupted. “My dad barely laughed until you came along. You make him happy in a way I don’t remember him seeing. He’s just scared.”
“Dad, can we go now?” Claire raised her voice, trying to shut them up before they declared their undying infatuation in front of the few people left in the building.
“Oh, you’re kidding! That was cute though. You were this tiny little thing, and no one really wanted to let you play because we were jerk kids. And I let you have my stick and you were so fast, you used your height, and you have a wicked power serve. We were stuck like glue after that.”
Dean gave a small shake of his head, so that Mary wouldn’t see it. Castiel frowned at him, and he mouthed the word ‘later’.
Castiel opened his wallet, and pulled out one of the cards he used when he wanted to go incognito. She ran it through the machine, and handed it back with a thoughtful expression. Castiel didn’t want to wait to figure out what it meant.
Although Dean’s words were harsh, he smiled fondly at the mention of Charlie. Clearly, she was important to him. Castiel wondered if she were his girlfriend, if she knew that they’d been flirting. Castiel brought a hand forward, surprised that it wasn’t shaking with his nerves.
“Yes.” Castiel nodded behind Dean, and he turned to see eleven musicians on clarinets, flutes, recorders and panpipes. “I’m trying to think of other ways to match this song after you said not to take it literally.”
“You said he didn’t know how good he had it,” Donna pointed out, and grabbed a truffle. Jody bit into one herself.
Claire looked over at Dean and Sam, who were carefully avoiding eye contact. She sought her father in the crowd, but all the faces blurred together and she couldn’t pick him out. She met Chuck’s eye reluctantly, and nodded, swallowing hard as she did. She had already made up her mind that she wasn’t going to confess anything about Dean and Castiel’s relationship, but she could still tell the truth around that omission.
Dean barely slept, and he watched as Helios pulled the sun along the eastern horizon, gently nudging Castiel awake and affixing his helmet back on as they both sat up. Castiel did the same, and the soon arranged themselves with the rest of the troop, to the left and near the front of the regiment. Normal Greek warfare dictated that the strongest fighters be on the right but Thebes had a long tradition of putting the Sacred Band to the left, meeting the strongest of their enemy head on. It had been their trick against Sparta before, and Dean felt a thrill knowing that he and Castiel were considered some of their strongest soldiers. It was something he thought wouldn’t happen again after the threat from Argos, but it was rewarding to have the generals confirm they thought he and Castiel were worthy.
He merely looked at her, that passive gaze that she didn’t buy. He had to be cussing her out every time he looked at her like that, pilgrimage or no pilgrimage. He had to regret coming back in her life, dragging her into his apartment, playing the doting father again. He had to hate her using his name, instead of calling him Dad.
Castiel shook his head to dispel the thought. He did not need to encourage Gabriel, and he knew the thought had only occurred because they had been drinking.
“Stop with the warm fuzzies and start the car. The sooner we get home, the sooner I can escape and you two can get on with your gross reuniting.”
he paused to think about the fact his daughter was distance learning and not interacting with any other kids, and did the math and got to the correct conclusion …
“I guess that makes me unprofessional then, because I will put your daughter first as much as I can. I love Claire, way too much to let anyone get away with hurting her.”
They ended up stopping in Eileen’s diner for lunch. Claire assumed that Dean had passed on the message about what her grandmother and grandfather were like because although Eileen looked happy to see her, she treated her just like any other guest. If her grandparents had anything to say about their waitress being deaf, they didn’t share it with Claire, which she was grateful about. It was one thing them blaming her parents divorce on her father and acting like being gay was criminal because of that, it was another thing to realise that two people she did love were completed bigoted.
“If you’re really going to push me, Cas, I’ll say that you’re the thing I want to spend that money on. It’s yours. It was always yours.”
She shot up in bed, clutching her chest, her breath heaving. Castiel was sitting on the edge of her bed, his hand hovering over her shoulder.
Faith had settled against the front of the sofa that Junior lay on, her knees propped in front of her, the swollen lump of her pregnancy bump wedged uncomfortably in the space. She lay her hands on the bulge, and spoke to the baby, grateful that all the adults in the house had gone to bed, or at least left her alone in the room with Junior. At least she could communicate with the baby silently, in her head.
Luke took hold of Castiel’s wrist himself, and Castiel felt himself collapsing. How could he explain to Luke of all people that he needed to go to the irrelevant man and save his most important relationship? He did the only thing he could do, and sent a text message as surreptitiously as he could.
He knew Dean was busy, knew how he got about his projects. He knew as well, that Sam and Charlie were important to their big brother and he would drop most things in a heartbeat for them, no matter how much he might complain. But to not hear anything after they had slept together, been intimate with each other, it was wrong, wasn’t it?
Castiel turned the compress over, putting the cooler side against his skin, and considered where this conversation was going. Dean hadn’t reacted horribly to the news, which would have been a bonus even without the mark’s influence.
“Kevin. Kevin Tran.” He held a hand out to shake. “And you’re Castiel, aren’t you? The quiet brother.”
'Trust me, Ben, I would've done anything, anything to make sure you were okay, that you were safe. The year I spent with you and your mom, it was one of the best years of my life. And then I had to put a gun in your hand when you were eleven years old. I couldn't do that to you, Ben. Whether you were my kid or not.'
“Or you could tell them the truth about you and me? It’s so hard not to tell people you’re my girlfriend, especially the cheer team.”
“Well,” Castiel’s voice came from behind Dean, and he turned to see his husband at the top of the basement stairs. “My brother Manny lives next door, there’s plenty of room for everyone. Maybe Dean and I could renew our vows some time, and everyone could visit then? My father was upset to miss the wedding too.”
Castiel merely nodded. They fell silent, and Castiel knew it was his time to talk, really talk. He had to treat this as though Dean had been genuine. It felt much more like the man who joked about scallop forks and kept a reassuring hand on his back. He looked up at Dean, bracing himself to say the words, and they finally made eye contact. He could see it so clearly, Dean begging him, saying more words than his mouth had, and he wondered if Dean could see the mix of emotions he had swirling in his chest too. He must have done, because he raced across the room and caught the back of Castiel’s neck, and the next thing Castiel knew, they were kissing. He didn’t know if he started it, or Dean did, or if they had the same thought at the same time.
He heard another hiss, and felt one of Dean’s hands rub against his head, near his ear. He nuzzled against it as he started caressing around Dean’s penis, his fingertips rubbing, his palm cupping briefly before he pulled his fingers tight, their path undefined until he hit one particularly thick vein, which he traced from base to head and back again. Dean tightened his grip on Castiel’s head and pushed his own hand in the way, gripping himself tightly in a way that Castiel could see would be too difficult to prise off. Dean’s knuckles were maybe an inch from his eyes before the hunter began kneading himself. Castiel wasn’t going to be beaten, even if he now had to rush. He kissed the head of Dean’s penis, and licked the tip slowly, his tongue barely grazing the swollen skin.
Meg tugged him onto the makeshift dance floor, and he relaxed slightly as they began to dance. Dancing could be embarrassing, but it was less stressful than holding conversations with people he didn’t know. He could pretend it was just himself and Meg. Or at least, he could until he felt a familiar calming sensation, and he turned his head without overthinking it.
Emmanuel didn’t argue, but went with Castiel along the pathway to their houses. Castiel could feel the relief seeping in as Manny left the confusing mass of Dean’s siblings’ emotions.
'Regardless, Dean is not the kind of man who would stand up and declare his emotions in private, much less in front of a crowd of people we barely know. He shows me how he feels in the only ways he knows. Like when I ask him not to hurt the boy who has damaged the Men of Letter's reputation for centuries because he means something to our daughter. I've had to learn, Faith, to cherish how he shows it. And you're fortunate, because he doesnt hold back as much with you, even in this brief time you've been made aware of him. Maybe that's why you don't understand.'
It hurt to hear Dean talk like that. Castiel forced himself to go through with this interaction, clearing his throat and opening the front door again.
"Sounds good. We could definitely use the muscle if she's still nearby. We're at Ben Braden's house right now."
“I think I need to pretend that Charlie on coffee is not going to wreck the store. I can’t watch if it’s actually going to happen.” He sat on the couch himself, pulling her feet onto his lap, and patting her calf. “Want to talk about it, Bear?”
Dean didn’t say anything that night if he had found out what was wrong with Alex, and Castiel was sympathetic to Claire’s concern. He was more interested in learning about Claire’s new friend, and Kaia seemed to be the hot topic of the night.
Ideally, Dean would have laughed off the offer of money and declared his undying love for Castiel. But the artist was skeptical to a degree that Castiel hadn’t banked on.
'I will when I can, Dean,' Castiel promised between kisses, working his way across Dean's chest. 'But I have to kill the antichrist. It has to be me.'
Castiel groaned, and flopped back onto the pillows, and Dean tried to appeal to Gabriel’s better side.
“My mom died a few years ago, my dad bailed a couple years before that. It’s just me and my aunt. I watched my mom die, it gave me night terrors. Sorry if I wake you up screaming.” Kaia supplied.
“If you ever need to talk Dean, before or after you move up there, you know I’m here for you, right?” Sam broke into his thoughts. “Even if you wanna drink a beer and not talk, I can do that.”
'Hey,' Sam's voice came from the doorway. Faith turned around, and saw her uncle leaning against the doorframe. 'Are you okay?'
“You’re interrupting, that’s what’s going on,” Lucifer sneered. The boy turned in his seat, watching their exchange with apprehension. “I’m hiring a new driver. I had to let Julian go. He couldn’t tell the difference between a red light and a green light yesterday, he nearly killed me.”
“That’s Sam,” Dean pointed to Sam’s back. Castiel already knew, from the day before, but they hadn’t really been introduced properly. Sam looked around, watching Dean approach the fridge and pull out two bottles of beer. He snapped the caps off with no issue, and Castiel was quietly impressed. He needed a bottle opener every time, but then he didn’t work with metal every day. Or drink very often.
Last one for now (there is more!) ... I feel like now I could write this chapter a heck of a lot better.
'Are you still judging him because he's not fully human?' Gabriel asked softly. 'Because really Faith, you need to drop the prejudice. He wants to help.'
Castiel looked back at him. Did he come across that way? Did Dean think he was as bad as everyone he was forced to socialise with? Then why had Dean agreed to come? He tried to reassure him that, despite appearances, he was very much interested in Dean. All while not actually saying he was interested, because God knew what Dean’s story even was.
“Okay, would you’ve preferred it if I was like, Alex is my girlfriend, that’s why I spend so much time with her? Even though we agreed not to tell anyone yet because you didn’t want crap for it, even if it would have made it so much easier to protect Dean and Dad? I did the best I could, okay? Like I’m doing the best I can now.”
“No, not the texts Dean sends where he references a lot of pop culture I’ve never even heard of. Do you remember when I came back? Just before the funeral, they agreed I had full custody and I helped your grandparents sort out the house. You were angry and throwing your belongings into boxes, and I went into Amelia’s room. Our old bedroom. There was something I wanted for you, and I thought she would have hidden it in there. I found it under her bed.”
He kissed her forehead, and they shared a brief smile before another contraction was upon her. She squeezed his hand again, breaking bones that had barely begun to heal again, trying not to give in completely to the pain. Junior got her matching his breathing, and he tried to do it as slowly as possible. When the latest contraction faded, he winced at her.
“This is the weakest part. Let Michael know. One of the cogs makes it difficult to strengthen it properly and if that spoke gets damaged, you’ve just got a mass of scrap metal scratching up your floor.”
“This isn’t Purgatory, Garth. Your actions, and Junior’s actions, over the last few months have ensured that you won’t ever see that place.”
And then they went from zero to sixty, Castiel slamming into him, his fist keeping up his furious rhythm and Dean was practically bouncing on his lap, leaning back against Castiel’s firm chest. The orgasm kept building in Dean, and every time he thought that maybe he was ready to go, Castiel pushed him that little bit further.
“That’s so Cas.” he shook his head. It was the second time he’d used the nickname, and Claire was a little freaked out. No one ever gave her dad a nickname, her mom had always called him Castiel. But the way Dean said it, so full of affection … it was their second date, that was weird. “Where did he think we were going?”
“I was not expecting this,” Castiel spoke quickly. “I’ve never understood people going out on New Years Eve, just to start the new year with a hang over and a list of regrets-”
“Oh really?! Then what have I done that’s worth you denying yourself any pleasure I could give you?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean has to clear his throat and say it again because his voice decided to go on strike.
“Oh, shit... Okay. Well, ha, how about we sit up real quick? Yeah, okay.” Cas gives one parting suckle to Dean’s ear and snakes his hand back down and out of Dean’s shirt, sitting up and staring with his head tilted while Dean pushes himself up and decidedly away from him against the headboard. “Okay yeah, that’s a bit better. Um. I’m just wondering. If what we’re doing is… what you want to be doing?”
"Nah, Cas, this was for you. Maybe next time, but this right now is for you." The tenderness he's met with is going to rip Dean apart one day, but before it has a chance, they're exchanging sweet kisses and Cas is rolling onto his side to pull him closer. They sleep like this most nights. Facing each other. Sharing breath and a memory foam pillow, almost naked under the covers and feeling completely safe in each other's company. Cas rests his hand on Dean's shoulder, where the scar he put there used to be. Both of them regret that it can't be seen anymore, but they can both feel the connection there, even after almost a decade. It's a comfort now, just like it's always been.
That look, mixed with Cas's tenderness, makes Dean sob just once, and it's so strange. Dean is so revved up from doing this with Cas that he felt like he was going to explode a few minutes ago, but now that Cas is setting the pace, he feels… numb, almost. In a really great way. He knows his knees are getting stiff along with his jaw, and he's still so turned on that he can't form a single cohesive thought, but none of that is important to him at all. Every time Cas does a slow roll of his hips and huffs out a labored breath, Dean gets a punch of something in his stomach. Every time Cas lets out one of those sexy little sounds, he lets out one of his own. Something has Dean so gone that the only thing that matters is making sure Cas feels good, and it's fucking exhilarating to have evidence that he does.
He closes the gap himself and Cas hisses through his teeth and throws his head back as Dean places a wet kiss to the head. Dean scoots forward to get a better angle, and then he starts gradually taking Cas into his mouth. He tastes clean, and he smells like Irish Spring, and Dean's been told that he looks like a cockslut in the past, but it might actually be true right now because he cannot get enough. He closes his eyes and just goes for it, rolling his tongue on the bottom as well as he can with how girthy Cas is and swallowing the precome and saliva that keeps pooling in his mouth. Dean has no idea how long he just lavishes Cas's cock with his mouth, but he knows Cas has been letting out punched little breaths every time he swallows and grunting when the head of it presses against Dean's soft palette.
"Yeah buddy, getting head's pretty great." Dean is deflecting with a joke, but Cas doesn't press him this time, he just huffs out a little laugh and tilts his head to smile at Dean as he pulls him closer to kiss his forehead.
“Ungh, yeah, hey, uh Buddy? I was wondering, um. If you, actually wanted to take this any further?” Talking is so hard, but absolutely nothing else is happening until this gets resolved, so Dean’s just gonna have to soldier on. Cas makes being a soldier more difficult by taking this as an invitation. His arm that isn’t propping himself up snakes under his shirt, his fingers climbing the ridges of Dean’s ribs with barely-there pressure.
“For every stupid mistake I’ve made? Every time I’ve ever gotten you or your brother hurt? You’ve forgiven me. Immediately, you have let me back into your life, Dean, no matter what. All those things you say I gave up for you? Those are the reasons I left. I left heaven because you made Earth seem like home. I betrayed the angels because you showed me what a family should be. You included me in yours. Until I met you, I was just blindly following their orders. I didn’t have a cause until you, Dean.” Dean doesn’t have anything he can say to that. He feels like his chest is made of broken glass and helium. Light, but in a way that hurts. Cas lets his confession hang in the air for a few long moments, just staring at Dean while he tries to manage the tide of emotions that are threatening to swallow him whole. Then he breaks the silence, and in a much gentler, much sadder tone says, “You’re all I could ever ask for, and more than I will ever deserve.”
Dean lets himself go loose and relaxed, dropping his hand from where it was holding Cas’s to his face and instead letting it fall to his lap. He’s entirely in Cas’s hands now, the most implicit expression of trust he can come up with. He understands what Cas meant when he said that watching Dean feel pleasure is exhilarating. That is exactly the word. Even on his knees, completely at his mercy, Dean is overwhelmed by a rush of power when he sees Cas’s pupils blow even wider and his mouth fall open in reverence. He whispers one last request against Cas’s hand before he surrenders himself to him completely.
Cas’s adam’s apple bobs as he swallows again, looking down and away, at anything that isn’t Dean, and shifting his upper body where he had been slightly hunched and gripping his thighs.
He had intended to stay pliant, to let Cas decide everything, but with every tiny movement Dean makes out of instinct, Cas grows more feral. Dean sucks on his tongue when he thrusts it into his mouth again and Cas hooks his leg around Dean’s torso to pull him closer. Dean moves his hands from where they were dangling in his lap to grab Cas’s hips for support, and Cas takes one of his hands from Dean’s hair to fist it in the back of his shirt and pull him closer. Anything to get closer.
The casual conversation Dean had planned had gone about as well as any of his other plans seem to. Cas was three feet away from him, looking down at his feet, his hands dangling between his legs. Dean hated seeing him like that. Hated that Cas saw himself that way, but words were failing him again. Actions have always spoken louder in Dean’s mind anyway, so he pushes himself off the bed and down onto the floor, bringing a pillow with him which he sets down between Cas’s feet. Cas doesn't even look up as Dean knee-walks forward and situates himself on the pillow, too caught up in his own angst to pay attention.
If anything is going to happen, it will be Cas who makes it happen. Regardless of what Dean wants, that’s the whole point, but apparently their wishes are aligned because Cas starts unbuttoning his shirt from the top down, never breaking eye contact. When the last button is undone Dean’s hands fall to Cas’s zipper, but Cas reaches down and pulls Dean’s shirt over his head and drops it on the floor instead. Cas’s shirt falls open to reveal his skin, and Dean is laid bare before him, and this is exactly what Dean wanted. His hands are in his lap again as he waits for Cas. What he is waiting for exactly, Dean doesn’t know, and he doesn’t have to. Cas will take care of him.
"Thank you, Dean." Despite how aroused Dean was earlier, the gentle kissing and touching is lulling him to sleep.
Cas seems genuinely confused by this and tilts his head further than what it already was. “I want to do whatever you’re comfortable with, Dean. I want to make you feel good.” And Dean sees why Cas goes wild when he says that to him, that’s totally not fair.
“Oh… well. I do like sex. Watching you experience pleasure is unparalleled to any experience in my very long life. And knowing I gave that pleasure to you is… exhilarating.” On that last word Cas’s eyes go dark and he licks his lips as he contemplates what Dean looks like when he “experiences pleasure”. Dean hadn’t really given much thought to what Cas did when he was in the middle of cumming his brains out, but now he realizes that he must just watch. That shouldn’t be as erotic as it is, but Dean’s brain keeps conjuring up all the times he told Cas to stop staring at him even before they started this whole thing, and isn’t that a thought? Maybe he's into exhibitionism a little bit. A lot bit. Cas is known for his voyeuristic tendencies so maybe Dean has just adapted to like it. Either way.
"Dean, that was…" Cas trails off, staring at the ceiling like he just had an epiphany rather than an orgasm.
“Dean…” Cas’s voice is deeper than it’s ever been and it sounds like he’s pleading with him. Now that the dam has been broken, he wants, and Dean has lost all higher brain function to know what Cas is asking for specifically; he just knows that he wants to give it to him. He wants to give him everything. He wants to see him too, so he takes his hands from Cas’s hips and untucks his dress shirt, but that’s as far as his subconscious is apparently able to go because his hands just hold on to the bottom seam and Dean waits.
At first, Dean just thought he was shy because Cas is an angel. This act of human debauchery has got to be appalling to say the least, but now Dean’s getting worried. Because Cas is an angel. He doesn’t have human urges and desires like Dean does. Maybe he’s been doing all this sex stuff with him because he feels obligated, and that is not what Dean wants at all. Cas has always said that he wants to, and that he enjoys their time together no matter what they do, but being fine with sex isn’t the same as wanting sex, and if Cas isn’t an enthusiastic partner then Dean’s just not into that. Cas has always seemed enthusiastic, but the doubt has firmly taken root in Dean’s mind by this point, so he decides to bring up the matter with Cas before they get too hot and heavy in their next make out session. Let him know that they don’t have to have sex for Dean to be “fulfilled in their relationship” or whatever. It’s Cas, they’ll figure it out.
Dean has a realization that Cas hasn't cum a single time since they've been getting freaky together. Cas will lick every inch of Dean, touch every part of him, and make him cum from a million reverent strokes and kisses. But he never lets Dean reciprocate. Dean’s tried getting him off first, but he’s incredibly good at finding ways to distract him for a guy who was a virgin for a millenia. He’s also tried insisting in the heat of the moment that he enjoys providing for his partners. Whispering in Cas’s ears that it gets him off to know that he’s the reason that they feel so good, and that he wants to make Cas feel good too, if he’ll just let him. But no dice. Even though Cas seems to very much enjoy when Dean runs his filthy mouth, if the way he always groans and attacks it to shut him up is any indication. He uses Dean’s post orgasmic high to gently redirect his attention to cuddling and gentle caresses, insisting he feels fulfilled just from watching Dean come undone.
“Are you sure?” Everything with Cas is so pressing: his lips, his hands, his eyes, his speech. Every single thing that happens is the most important thing that has ever happened, and sometimes Dean finds it infuriating, but right now he aches with fondness for him. Of course Cas would still ask.
“Dean, is what we’re doing not satisfactory? Have I done something wrong?” and no nevermind, Cas is the roadkill puppy.
Cas straightens Dean’s head and hesitantly puts his own hands on his belt, asking a question with his eyes, and Dean nods. His head is still loose from Cas’s manhandling, but watching as Cas’s long fingers carefully undo the belt and pull it from the loops, all without looking away from Dean’s face makes him burn with want. When Cas pulls down his zipper achingly slow, Dean has to fight the urge to lunge forward and rip the offending pants off, and Cas smiles.
“Well… I guess. I feel as if I’ve made so many mistakes. I’ve hurt you so many times in so many ways… I just want to give you something that I can’t take away with another one. As for why I haven’t allowed you to return that sentiment… You’ve done enough for me, Dean. I don’t deserve that kindness from you.” Cas reaches over and caresses Dean’s thigh as if this confession is something they can just brush past, and Dean harshly shoves his hand away.
“Dean,” he rumbles back, not stopping his mission to cover the entire fucking surface of Dean’s neck with his lips. Dean clears his throat again.
Cas looks amazing like this. His eyes are dark, and his cheeks are pink, and his lips aren’t quite as swollen as Dean’s must be, but he looks like he has complete control and that he’s losing it at the same time. He moves with complete intention when he takes his thumb and slowly presses it back into Dean’s mouth, and Dean takes him in. Cas presses down on Dean’s tongue and it opens his mouth wider and steals the breath from both of their lungs. Cas takes him and Dean takes him in; it’s all taking and pressing. His thumb pulls out and pushes back in. Out and in. Out and in.
Despite having faith, Dean feels his stomach twist in anxiety when he pulls away from Cas’s lips. They’re laying on his bed; Dean on his back with Cas caging him in from the top. One of his thighs is pressing between both of Dean’s, and his entire body weight is being supported by one arm up by Dean’s face while the other caresses the strip of skin between his shirt and the waistband of his jeans. Angelic strength makes finding comfortable positions the easiest thing in the fucking world, much to Dean’s delight. They’ve done just this for hours before, even going as far as kissing Dean to sleep on more than one occasion.
The second Dean’s mouth turns away from his, Cas moves to his neck; pressing relentlessly gentle kisses down the column of his throat and making Dean’s brain catch fire.
"mmnhm Cas." They keep kissing, and Cas smiles into each press of lips he puts to Dean's steadily slackening mouth.
"Dean. Dean, I'm- fuck, I'm-" Dean groans in answer, and then Cas is cumming down his throat and Dean is swallowing around him. Cas holds Dean's head down on instinct, burying himself as deep as he can into his face without choking him, and riding out his orgasm. Dean's not complaining. This is exactly what he wanted. For Cas to let go. For him to understand that Dean wants to be there for him; that he wants Cas. And maybe he is a cockslut because fuck if Cas's spunk doesn't just taste good. He tastes good and he looks like a God with his mouth hanging open and his head thrown back in ecstacy, unable to keep eye contact with Dean through the waves of pleasure wracking his body. Dean never wants to forget this.
“Sure Dean, what would you like to do?” Apparently Cas is set on murdering Dean, because he mumbles this directly into his ear and gives the tiniest bite to the lobe while his thumb swipes across Dean’s nipple.
It takes Dean leaning forward and making Cas meet his eyes for him to realize their position has been changed. His eyes widen as he sits back and swallows.
Dean can see Cas’s resolve break like a dam, but his movements are still deliberate. The air rushes out of his lungs and his shoulders hunch in as he leans forward and steals Dean’s pliant lips in a kiss. He’s still so gentle, and Dean loves it. Dean has bared himself like this in the physical sense to other partners, but he’s never felt this cherished. His surrender was always met with claiming kisses and violent tugs of his hair, but not with Cas. Of course not with Cas. The kisses he gives him are so sweet it threatens to kill him, and in a romance novel Dean definitely hasn’t read, they would be described as divine. It’s reverence again.
Cas’s entire spine shudders and he groans as he pulls Dean close and starts mouthing things against his lips again. Thank you. I love you. Thank you.
The first roll of his hips up into Dean's face is hesitant, but as soon as Dean groans his satisfaction, Cas finally lets go and starts fucking into him at a steady rhythm. He's not forcing Dean's head down at all, or choking him, or even thrusting hard enough to push more of himself in. He's just rocking in and out of Dean's mouth like he's making love to him, and it's the sweetest face fucking Dean has ever taken part in. Whether it's the emotions or his gag reflex betraying him, Dean starts to feel tears rolling down his cheeks as they're stretched to fit a cock in them, and Cas swipes his thumb to catch them, back to staring at Dean like he hung the moon.
"Take me, Cas. Fuck my mouth, please, I want you to." Before Dean is done talking Cas is throwing his head back and moaning again. The edges of his hair are catching the lamplight and forming a ring around the top of his head, and Dean smirks a little because of course this is what would give Cas a halo. Dean decides to take matters into his own hands again by lowering himself as far as he can onto Cas's dick, which is just over halfway, and holding himself there. Thankfully, Cas takes the hint.
"Dean, I don't- what do you want?" He's a mixture of extremely aroused and slightly panicked, and Dean realizes that Cas needs him to spell it out for him. He's never had anyone like this before, which Dean is incredibly grateful for, but it also means he needs guidance. Dean will happily oblige.
He keeps his lips pressed to Dean as he murmurs, "I'm more than willing to return the favor…" and desire flares up in Dean so fast its comparable to a flash grenade in his stomach, but he just swallows before he pulls back and grabs Cas's jaw with one hand and meets his eyes.
“Done enough for you?! Cas you gave up everything you knew; your home, your family, your cause; everything. For us. And every mistake you’ve made, every time you’ve hurt me, you did that shit because you were trying to do the right thing. All I’ve ever done is be hard on you and ride your ass about it, but I get it, man, I do... And I’ve made a million mistakes of my own, for much worse reasons. If anyone doesn’t deserve kindness here, it’s me.”
When Dean finally admits defeat and has to take a second to breathe, Cas holds him still; pulls on the hair at the back of his head to tilt it upwards as Dean falls back to sit on his calves. Dean’s mouth is swollen and shining with Cas’s saliva and his eyes are unfocused as he catches his breath. He can feel how flushed his face must be and wonders how he must look with his hair all fucked up from Cas’s hands and his mouth all fucked up from Cas’s teeth. Probably really good, and this is proven correct when Cas takes his hand from Dean’s shirt and cradles his face again.
“No, no! God Cas, no, you’ve done everything right! Extremely right actually… I just, I wanna know why you won’t let me touch you back? It’s fine if you don’t want me to! Hell, it’s fine if you don’t like sex at all, it’s just not for some people. It won’t change the way I see you, I just want to know what the reason is.” Dean’s glad his frantic tone chilled out by the end of that, but it would be nice if he could just say what he means the first time around so Cas doesn’t get whiplash.
Cas kisses him again, slowly. He keeps pulling back and mouthing something against Dean’s lips, but he can’t tell what. It doesn’t matter. If it did, Cas would tell him. Dean is floating again by the time Cas pulls back and holds Dean’s head in his hands. Everything in his face is full of tenderness, and his hands are so gentle when they rock Dean’s head back and forth on his neck. It is an exercise in control that would make Dean’s legs give out if he weren’t already kneeling, and Cas does it just because he can.
“Cas. Take. What I am giving you.” There is a moment where Dean thinks that Cas is going to push him away, when the softness in his eyes hardens for just a second, but then Cas shudders as the tension leaves his shoulders and he exhales. He lets his fingers wander, caressing Dean’s scalp and gripping his hair. The hand that cups Dean’s face steadies and his thumb strokes Dean’s bottom lip, and Cas looks so vulnerable. He’s beautiful like this, when he admires Dean. Maybe that’s an arrogant thought to have, but Dean cannot bring himself to care. He’s on his knees begging for a man, who he’s mistaken for God on more than one occasion, to let him worship him. And Cas is still holding back.
He grabs Dean's head with one hand and his dick with the other, lining up so they're an inch apart before he asks again. "Dean, are you sure?" His voice is strained with the effort of holding himself back, but Dean knows if he said no, then all of this would be forgotten and they'd be fine.
“You’re not demanding, Cas, I’m offering. I want to kneel for you.” Dean puts as much sincerity into those words as he can, needing Cas to understand. By the looks of it, he has.
Dean interrupts him with Cas’s thumb still resting on his lips, making direct eye contact. This position is making Dean’s blood rush through his head and his brain go mushy, but he puts as much command into his voice as possible.
'Sit.' Sam demanded. Dax looked like he wanted to argue back, but thought better of it, and collapsed into the chair as Dean held his hand out, keeping Faith back as Sam leaned over the table, fists supporting him as he towered over Dax.
“Okay, I guess it’s a slumber party thing to share secrets, and you guys are the first friends I’ve even made all high school, but … I get dissociative episodes. It happens a lot, zoning out, delayed reactions, stuff like that.” She tucked her feet under her on the armchair. “They said it’s like, childhood trauma. I don’t remember it, but I know my Dad fell out with my Grandma, big time. I think I was close to her, and I was part of their falling out, but I don’t remember. He said she was crazy. I guess I inherited it.”
Claire nodded, and got out of the blanket, walking into the kitchen. Her limbs felt oddly heavy, and it took her a moment to find the tea bags. It felt like Alex was watching her every move, but when she looked back at the sofa, Alex was reading Castiel’s book. She watched as Alex turned a page, and then refocused on the tea, pouring water onto the tea bags and setting the cups in the microwave.
Sam looked up from the screen, surveying Dax carefully, his gaze drifting slowly to Faith. Dax could tell there was a lot more going on in Sam's head than he was expressing on his face. Dax was never going to play poker with this guy.
“If you’re just going to sit there and make me feel like crap, you can just go. I’m not in the mood.”
'Uh-uh, no talking in code, tell me straight what you're thinking.' Faith folded her arms across her chest. Castiel stepped forwards slowly.
'Nothing,' Dean turned back to the stove, shaking his head and trying to keep his hand steady. He couldn't resist muttering to himself 'What a ball-buster.'
“Please, introduce him to Return to the Past, and Unusual Experiments and the Stable Mild Picture Show.” She huffed out, leaning across her math homework. Dean’s laughter died down into a smirk.
Dean's tone had changed, his voice was deeper and rougher, and something in the tenor made Faith shiver. She'd heard her father like this before. Whatever issue Sam suddenly had with Dax, that Dean was apparently now up to speed with, it was enough for Dean to go Hunter Mode. But he hadn't been like this the few days they'd been back in the bunker. She felt the need to read the papers, to see why her father had turned so … alpha male.
“I told him it was best to have the space tonight, because tomorrow morning was going to be difficult. We’re going to have to get used to the fact that the Dean we see is different to your principal. Otherwise when he needs to discipline you, things are going to get more complicated than they need to be.”
“Oh my God,” Alex laughed. “What if he was there to make sure Mr Winchester didn’t jump your bones?”
The cake tasting had gone well, and Dean had been less stringent about the wedding cake than he had been in the planning so far. Castiel had heard Dean’s brief thought that their angelic powers would be enough to protect their guests, and he had forced himself not to think contradictory thoughts and keep his opinions to himself. Dean had shot his a filthy look that implied he knew exactly what Castiel was avoiding thinking, but the effect was marred by Dean’s cheeks bulging with cappuccino cake.
Somehow, they had wandered up to the diner. It was still mid-morning, too early for a burger, but Claire would never turn down one of their shakes.
Faith pretended not to hear him as they walked through a few more busy blocks, until they reached an old, yet cared for, green-and-cream coloured Volkswagen Camper. Dax unlocked it, climbing into the driver's seat and pushing his shaggy fringe back as Faith climbed into the camper part, drawing the curtains before storing her machete and a small pistol she had tucked into her bra. He pulled out into the crazy New York traffic as Faith climbed forward into the passenger seat, shoving her long brown hair back and checking her cell phone.
I first came across the story in Athens in 2017. On a family holiday where my son and I were determined to see everything related to the Percy Jackson and the Greek gods. At the Acropolis museum, I came across a book talking about Eros. In there it discussed love between gods and mortals, the women of Lesbos, incidences of homosexuality in Greek life and the roles of erastes and eromenos in society. I started to get a germ of an idea. I read about how when men came of age, they either courted girls or went into the army. Some armies, like the Spartan armies, would turn a blind eye to their soldiers copulating without their wives there. Thebes went one better, and made their most elite squadron one made exclusively of homosexual couples. The theory being that, if a man were fighting on the battlefield with his lover, he was going to be the fiercest, strongest, most ruthless soldier on the battlefield.
“Rookie mistake. You screw the admin, and get them to parrot your agendas while they’re still besotted. Then if it goes wrong it doesn’t fall back on you.”
“Ah. Yes. The slumber party.” He cleared his throat. “Jack, maybe we should go somewhere else? The sofa is yours, ladies.”
It was dark in the street, and Claire wasn’t sure where she was headed. She couldn’t go to Alex, things were better but still strained between them. She didn’t know where Kaia or Patience lived. Mostly, she wanted her Mum or her Dad, but neither of them were options at that moment. She could bother Charlie at the bookstore, but that didn’t seem like a good option either. So she kept walking around, wishing she hadn’t told Jack the truth. Eventually, a car started idling next to her, and she looked over to see Sam in the driver’s seat.
Alex didn’t talk for a while, even as she was leading Claire through the town. Claire didn’t know how to start the conversation, didn’t know what Alex was waiting for. They skirted around the town hall and started doubling back towards the diner before Claire finally thought of something to break the silence.
Castiel hurried across the room, no hesitation despite being caught in such an awkward position moments before. He stopped just before Faith, and allowed Dean to take his hand again.
'Siobhan, I can hear you. I could hear you if you were a mile away. And I don't have a stick up my ass, I'm worried for you. Like I said, we have things we need to discuss.'
Kaia scraped her chair back, squaring up to him, unafraid of the fact she was younger than him and much shorter.
“That’s teenspeak for ‘I’m over it, Dad’s boyfriend, but I need to save face.’ You learn to speak the lingo when you teach teenagers for ten years.” Dean spoke to Castiel as they got into the car. Claire slid into the back, just as Dean launched into the importance of saving face at the age of fifteen. Castiel cut him off with a kiss. “What was that for?”
Sam was eyeing Dean warily as they sat at that small table. Castiel assumed it was after the knowledge that Dean had tried to kill him, although it may have been because Dean and Castiel were continuing their mental conversation. They hadn’t said a word out loud since Dean had appeared in the doorway, they hadn’t needed to for themselves. But Sam and Becky were both looking at them with the same judgemental expression which only highlighted the differences between their true faces. Becky’s unblemished, innocent, naive facade; Sam’s demon-blood-damaged mess of soul, both managed to convey the exact same emotion. Castiel swallowed around a lump in his throat, and made himself talk out loud. Becky and Sam deserved to hear it all.
“I don’t want to celebrate without you there, Bear. It won’t be strip clubs or poker or anything like that. I just want time with my family, like I said. We could go to a theme park together maybe? Or that pottery painting like I’ve been talking about forever.”
Castiel arrived at the Winchesters for the next evening with Dean, a heavy weight in his stomach. He didn’t know how Dean was going to be, he hadn’t heard from him in over twenty-four hours, and Lucifer had been on his case all day about Dean’s intentions and Castiel’s naivety. He was exhausted from trying to avoid his siblings, but he couldn’t avoid the evening’s plans. Amara’s birthday dinner. The silver lining of which was that he could talk with Dean all evening and eat good food, maybe even dance together. Although Castiel would feel nervous dancing in front of others, the idea of being in Dean’s arms and how good they felt around him was enough to quell that. If Dean were willing to dance with him, that was.
The first thing Dax noticed, was the explosion of plaid everywhere, in various colours. Most of it was confined to the shirts strewn everywhere, but there was a check print on the blankets as well. He searched as quickly as he could through this room, pausing when he found pictures of two different women, one blonde and one brunette. Pausing to look at the pictures was a mistake.
“I’m being sensible. I might not completely get this whole ace thing, but why do there have to be rules?”
“You don’t recognise me. That’s okay. Thank you for keeping me safe. Sorry to leave you the moment I was born but I have a lot to do right now. I came because you wanted to see me.”
“I know.” Faith snuggled into her pillow, as Dean sat on the edge of her bed, Castiel hovering nearby.
“I’m sorry about them,” Claire told the mirror in front of her, looking at the woman tying her dress behind her.
A tear rolled down her cheek and she batted it away, but more came. She curled further into the armchair, and hoped that her father and principal didn’t notice. But she could hear the credits rolling and knew she wasn’t going to be successful. She heard someone stand up, and the next thing she knew, Castiel’s arms were around her, and he was holding her tightly. She could smell Dean’s cologne, clinging to his button down, and she could hear Dean, stopping the DVD and putting it away.
“Devon’s on the football team, I think Ben is too? So you know, typical meatheads, but it might be fun.”
“Claire?” Sam interrupted her internal dialogue, his voice hesitant. “Why did you ask about me and my brother in the diner?”
'I'm giving you food and a place to sleep tonight. I'm agreeing to look after a werewolf when I have children. You can answer me.'
“I’m not trying to influence your emotions, Claire. I don’t want you feeling guilty, or unable to express yourself. But I do want to reassure you, and I think maybe this would help that.”
“Should I remember all this if Athens continues its derogatory campaign of Thebes? What if Sparta rises again? Maybe I should just lay on the floor and accept my fate?”
It was Faith. Dean sat up, made sure his underwear were still covering everything important up, and he wriggled his way out from under Castiel.
“Thank you. I’d better go before too many of your classmates show up and see your old man embarrassing you.”
Castiel looked forward, wondering if he could bear to have this conversation on top of Meg’s betrayal.
“Well, my mom died and left me with a dad who showed how little he cared six years ago, so if that’s not a joke I don’t know what is. Don’t judge me for how I’m dealing with this.”
“Just pretend that the closet had a cowboy hat on it,” Claire told her father. “Because I’m not saying what the hell went on in there, okay?”
Finally, he was summoned by one of his superiors, as a new group of rookies arrived. He heard the other established soldiers making their choices, picking out those with the broadest shoulders, the thickest chests, the tall men who looked as though they would fight well. Dean studied each of them, trying to see if any of them held a spark of interest for him. On first appearances, no one stood out.
'Another hunter. He bust his leg up pretty good so he's on some down time right now. Not his choice, his girlfriend made him. She's the one coming to pick us up. She knows about hunting, but she's not really involved. I think she thinks we're all crazy.'
“Hey, if you want to wear your underwear outside your clothes, that’s between the two of you.” There was yet more laughter. “Dean also will try and fix any scrapes with duct tape and a stern look. Although, since you’re not a five-year-old kid who grazed his knees, there’s probably less chance of that. Dean’s a pretty creative person when it comes to free time as well. Sorry to those of you know know this story, but one time when I was about five and Dean was about nine, he decided he would teach me some baseball. We were living with Uncle Bobby then, and a lot of our free time was spent playing in the junker yard Bobby would work on at weekends and in the holidays. We didn’t have a tee ball set, so we improvised. Dean found a wrench that was about the right size, and the nearby apple tree had left a whole bunch of tiny sour apples on the floor. Perfect for a learner for baseball. We found a spot in the junk yard to practice my swing, with Dean throwing as many apples at me as he did at the wrench. Bobby came out of nowhere, after I hit one and nearly took his eye out. Dean dropped his apple, and I threw the wrench. Right into Bobby’s truck window. Or when we were a little older, and Bobby gave us a curfew, Dean thought he was smart enough to work around it. He did the old pillow trick and shimmied out our bedroom window to go hustle the local pool dives. He found out recently he got sold out right away by Bobby’s friend Rufus, but didn’t know Bobby bribed me to give him info too. So, sorry Dean, but peanut butter cups and nachos with marshmallows were just too tempting.”
"Maybe I don't care. Maybe I don't see the wings, or the baby bump, or when you get annoyed at me. Maybe I see the way you talk to your uncle and love your father and miss your mom. Maybe I see the heart behind the front. And I like it."
Somehow they had survived Mary’s questions about anal sex, and managed to null the topic. One by one, they had all fallen asleep. And when they woke up, they all had breakfast together, Dean and Sam helping Mary senior to organize all the cereals and pancakes and food fads that cropped up.
Claire went, and Alex helped Patience up, bringing her to the table. They settled on the chairs and grabbed paints from Kaia’s rainbow collection, starting to work on the posters that Kaia was planning on hanging up around school.
“I think so,” Claire said slowly. “We’re still, you know,” she didn’t know how to finish the sentence, how to talk to Jody about her relationship with Jody’s foster daughter.
“I can’t either. I thought this would go the same way as that rumour about you and me,” both Winchester’s pulled the same revolted face. “But it’s way out of hand now. I can handle losing my job because of this, but not everything else. Not being put on the register, or going without them.”
“Hello handsome!” She beamed, leaning against the door frame. “You’re a little late for being my Christmas present.”
Sam and Castiel were back in the New York Public Library, looking for Flora, asking around for anyone who might have seen her. No one seemed to recognise their description of the little girl, even when Sam claimed that she was his daughter, who had run away and he was worrying. The security guards let Castiel view the CCTV footage, but there was no sign of her in any of the tapes, though they only stretched back a week.
OMG, I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to update. I was doing a LOT of hours at work over Christmas because I'm hardly in January. I'm doing artwork for a Big Bang too so need to spend time on that, and I've been planning for another con. I'll be at OrlCon in just under two weeks and it's taking a lot of prep and panic with the flights and everything. But I still have a few things I want to throw at this story so don't think I've abandoned it x
“I can feel it too, Dean. What little I remember of last night, I remember thinking you were perfect. That you were gorgeous and funny and you tasted good and … maybe this is crazy, maybe no one else will get it. But I don’t like the idea of getting an annulment. I’d rather have done this the traditional way, but now,” he paused, and pursed his lips for a moment. “We’ll get to know each other, do the whole thing backwards. When do you leave?”
“I don’t expect you to get it. I’m not saying I don’t want her in my life, I’m not saying it was a bad thing. But I love her as a friend and when we were dating I was trying to change myself to make her happy. I think we’ll both be happier as friends.”
“Are you in?” He grouched. The stranger flipped a chip forward, and raised his eyebrows at Castiel, who pushed a few chips across the table.
“Reasonable? Dean, my daughter has broken bones! It’s the least confident I’ve seen her, the longest silent treatment she’s ever given me. I feel sick just thinking about what she might have been through. But how will that help her? How do you expect she’ll talk to us if we’re yelling about this? And you’re the principal, Dean, you’re meant to be impartial here.”
'So, this Castiel guy, he spends all this time bossing Gabriel around and not paying us any real attention, and the first time you meet him he's doing stuff with your dad? What's up with that guy?'
“So, what was up? Did you get sick?” Claire pressed. Alex flinched, and closed her locker as a few cheerleaders walked down the hallway.
Claire had taken her father up on his offer of a mental health day, and woke to a book on her bedside table and a note from her father, encouraging her to read. She took a fluffy blanket off her bed and traipsed onto the sofa in the main room , curling up under the blanket and reading the book. She didn’t often read unless forced to do so, but she knew her father meant well and he obviously thought this book would communicate things more effectively.
“Like you?” Gabriel rolled his eyes, and slung an arm around Castiel. “You need to lighten up, little bro.”
“No. Mr Ketch already confused you for Mary’s father. It’s better that I do it.” She stood up and left the room, and Dean looked at Castiel, who was watching him with a steady gaze.
“You know my brothers power-play. They were doing it long before you came along, and when you did come along, you somehow became Michael’s pawn. When he was talking about you in that suit, the one you wore to your art show; part of me agreed that you would look so good in that suit - and you did, you were irresistible - but part of me wondered if Michael had set it up somehow, had talked you into agreeing to date me so he could push his agenda. At home, Michael asked about you constantly, about how we met, when we started dating. He was too interested. It made me wary. Meanwhile, Luke was hovering, making off-hand comments about Michael. I thought he was backing off, becoming easier to tolerate. He started questioning your motives. He’s good. It was like, ‘so the artist has agreed to come to an auction and let you buy him an island, Castiel?’ and I didn’t see through it. But then we kissed and it was everything I wanted.”
It was an interesting choice, Castiel thought. People normally went to Carmen or Madame Butterfly. Castiel was visited with that urge, to talk about Berlioz and his obsession with a book that led to the narrative of the opera. How it was an interesting journey of one man’s obsession with a woman that led him into hell. How his overthinking led to a life of unhappiness … maybe it was best not to discuss the plot line and ruin it for Sam. Or overanalyse how close Faust’s fictional life seemed to mirror parts of his own. But he couldn’t say nothing to Sam.
“Sure, come on.” Claire led the way back to her bedroom. When she was being made ready for the day, they had told her that Castiel had arranged for them to sleep over the night of the wedding. At the time, Claire was a little cautious, but after an evening of dancing and seeing her parents so in love, it felt like the perfect ending. They walked along the hallway arm-in-arm, Kaia trying to work out sleeping arrangements. Alex yawned behind the back of her hand, and Claire patted Kaia’s head.
The soldier held his shield closer to his body, but made no other move. Exasperated, Dean went for the initial attack, making a large swipe at the soldier’s sword. As quick as a bolt from Zeus, the new soldier reacted, meeting Dean’s xiphos with his own, sparks flying as the blades met.
She got up from her chair, and gave him a hug, before heading to her bedroom. She put on a trashy romcom, and reflected on everything her dads had said.
“Everyone’s talking, I can’t sleep,” she grouched. Dean stood up to help her, but his mother held up her hand.
“I am friends with you because we fit together, Castiel. Because I understand you and you understand me. Because we both need to survive the crappy families we were born into, and we help each other with that. I just don’t like seeing you bringing down all your defences and throwing yourself at a guy who barely has two cents to rub together.”
She sat up with a start, her breathing coming as though she had been running a marathon. Looking around her, she took in her new bedroom, the light coming in from the street lamps outside, everything else dark and quiet. Her phone said it was around half three in the morning.
"I'd like to think my flirting had improved since I was three," he teased, and then turned serious. "Faith, I know this is complicated for you. I know you're not over your last boyfriend, and you think I'm ugly, and you probably think I'm going to end up just like my Dad. And your Dad is probably going to skin me alive for even going there, but, well … if you wanted me back, that would be awesome. But I know last night wasn't … I know we're not going out."
“If you dare call my girlfriend a bitch,” Claire dropped her voice low, her eyes narrowing as she invaded his space, putting their faces close together. “Then I will kick your ass all over this cafeteria.”
He sat beside her at the ceramics painting as well, reaching across her for paints, or brushes, or water to rinse his equipment. Castiel was once again sitting opposite them, monitoring the way they were together, making sure neither accidentally ruined the other’s work. Jack had picked a cat he was decorating for his mother, and Castiel had chosen a mug, whereas Claire had decided to decorate a photo frame she was hoping would match her room. She didn’t want to admit it out loud, but it was actually a nice activity that Castiel had picked. He was in his element, painting his mug, and Jack was having fun with his project, but Claire felt like her soul had been soothed while she picked colours and made gentle strokes against the ceramics. They were quieter after their breakfast, all of them absorbed in their work, and Claire aware of Jack to an unhealthy degree, but when she glanced at her father, he looked so contented. And really, that was all that mattered.
“Why’s he punishing you, Cas? Because of me? Because I made you turn your back on your brothers and sisters? Because I encouraged you to have free will?”
“About a week ago. Dad felt guilty about Jack sleeping on the sofa, and the apartment wasn’t really big enough. Sam and Eileen wanted somewhere smaller, so they moved into Eileen’s place and Charlie’s in the apartment, and we came here.”
He forced a smile, and she slid out of the car, heading straight for her locker, ignoring the other kids as she passed them. She swapped her books over, and headed for Alex’s locker, where her girlfriend stood, sliding a notebook into her schoolbag.
Castiel was flustered, and unable to wriggle out of Azazel’s grip as he was walked back to his rooms.
Dean frowned, not understanding why he was being given this story. What did it have to do with the battle, with Thebes, with Castiel? He wanted to ask, but Aristaeus ploughed on.
She felt a tear roll down her cheek, in spite of herself. Junior thumbed it away before she could reach for it.
Dean was grazing his fingers along Castiel’s torso, neither of them breaking the silence between them, It felt like the world would implode if they did, and the fragile moment between them would shatter. So instead they traced each other’s bodies, enjoying the touch of skin on skin, until Dean finally rolled over and climbed out of bed. Castiel did the same, and they got dressed in silence, before Castiel led the way back off the boat, and over to the limousine. In the car, they sat side-by-side, Castiel leaning against Dean’s shoulder and Dean resting his chin on Castiel’s head, their fingers entangled, still silent as they made their way back to Dean’s house.
“I’m going to eat so many waffles,” Jack said as he joined them, grabbing the shoes right beside Claire. She tensed, almost expecting him to hold her the way he had in the dream, but her cousin was oblivious, taking a seat on the bottom of the staircase and kicking his feet into his boots. She glanced at him from under her hair, but Jack was busy lacing his boots up, looking at what he was doing. She looked away before he could finish, and straightened up, arms out for her father’s inspection. He mistook it for a request for a hug, and she ended up in a tight embrace.
“Why do you have to be the one to help? Why did she have to take the others in? Like, I know they’re our brothers and sisters but they’re not really anything to do with her. She didn’t have to adopt them and make you help.”
Mary’s expression softened, and she held her arms out, which John fell into straight away. Dean was a bundle of elation, but Castiel felt even bleaker. Mary loved Dean, she liked Gabriel, and she had forgiven John. He stood up, leaving the plans for the wedding alone, and zapped himself out of the bunker, instantly appearing a moment later on a hidden mountainside, the rock face severe, but dotted with flowers and small patches of grass. He cupped his face in his hands and sighed heavily, before allowing himself to acknowledge the idea that he couldn’t let himself think in front of Dean. That for all he had heard of Mary Winchester, as loving and giving a mother as she was, she was bigoted. Homophobic. It was the only explanation Castiel could come up with. She had never foreseen her child falling for another man. It didn’t matter how well Castiel treated her, how much he tried to engage, he had the wrong vessel.
She was heading to the benches outside to eat lunch when some jerk ran into her in the hallway outside the cafeteria. She lost her balance and fell over as he stumbled back, and then she was on her feet, pushing him in retaliation.
“You have enough stress to cope with. We’ll be fine. It’s just been difficult, being separated for so long.”
Dean frog-marched her to the exit, where the catcalls followed them. Dean returned the clubs and his ball, and handed over ten dollars for the one Claire had lost into the water, and then he made her get in his car. They rode in silence as Dean drove over to Eileen’s cafe. Claire refused to speak as they went inside and Dean handed her a menu. He leaned across the formica towards her.
'You owe me better than this, Gabriel! Mary at least got a warning! She had someone going through it with her!'
Castiel sat on his front porch with Emmanuel and Daphne, his cat, waiting for Dean’s car to show up along the horizon. He felt like a little kid who had been promised Disneyland, or a teenager waiting to hear what college they were going to. Yes, he and Dean spoke every day, usually on Facetime so he could see those beautiful lips and wonderful freckles. But it wasn’t the same as having him there. Emmanuel placed a hand on his shoulder.
“Not trying to be an ass, Cas, but that’s an in-person conversation. It’s complicated and messy, and I might need to actually have you here to, you know,” Dean was lost for words now, and Castiel felt his chest thrum in double time.
The way Dean’s voice shook made Castiel wonder if they were actually talking about the money, or whether it was a distraction from Dean’s obvious hurt.
Sorry that it relies so heavily on Faith. I hope that having her be the narrator more than anyone else won't be a deal breaker x
“It’s intriguing,” Castiel commented. Okay, so he wasn’t exactly the best conversationalist. He knew enough from studying art history, from being on the board at the gallery. He could have spoken for hours about art with Dean, who he was sure would listen and contribute as well.
It had been a month since they had left their temporary safe house, and Faith's memory had been restored. In that month, they had managed to reach Illinois and realise they were lost. Garth had been navigating the entire time, but surprisingly, it was Gabriel and not Dean who got angry at the situation.
“I knew Gabriel was ageing. I knew he didn’t have long. But Sam?” Dean choked out. Castiel placed his hands gently on Dean’s shoulders.
Haha. Seriously, can you come meet them? Properly? I think Sam might actually ban me from seeing you if you don’t. You wouldn’t think I was the eldest the way they’re going on.
“I do like nougat,” Jack mused, and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. “I suppose if you look at it like that it’s not good and I should be upset, but I have a mother who loves me very much and has given everything to make my life a good one. I have a compassionate uncle who is willing to help out even if he can’t do much, and I have a cousin I’ve missed for eleven years who wants to spend the day with me. I might even be able to stay in college. Life is good.”
Castiel fell on the bed too, kissing him once more, gasping as their bodies came together, skin on skin. He wanted to memorise everything; tingling skin and passionate kisses, firm caresses and a graceful flow between their two bodies. Dean broke off the kiss, angling Castiel’s neck with one hand, and he started kissing there, nipping the skin with tiny bites, sucking slightly as he did. Castiel scrambled to put a condom on, hoping it wasn’t too presumptuous that he would get to be inside Dean. He didn’t even know if Dean liked anal. But Dean had been surprising him so far, and he didn’t want to be told no. He adjusted on the bed, sitting underneath Dean’s legs, parting them firmly. He sat up, and Dean looked at him tenderly. He didn’t even need to ask, The look on Dean’s face screamed that it was going to be okay. So he eased himself into Dean. Dean who sat up, and started thrusting with him, riding him, their lovemaking keeping pace with the motion of the boat on the waves. Dean was hot and slick with sweat against him, their kisses were now clumsy but full of passion. Castiel was working hard to keep pace, gripping on to Dean’s back with both hands as he did.
Dean grinned widely, curling tight against Castiel’s body as Gabriel and Baldur’s song drifted into silence.
“Of course. We take an oath. We’re in this band in order to be close to each other. Most men here were recruited from their original erastes. I feel more myself in this environment.”
She felt a stab of loneliness as she watched them, and forced herself to focus back on Little Shop of Horrors.
“… So then the house goes quiet. Too quiet. Sammy was a regular chatterbox and there wasn’t a peep out of either of them. I know these boys well enough to know silence is a bad sound with them. So I look everywhere, in the bedrooms, the bathroom, the kitchen, the study, the den. And then there’s this clunk outside. I had junkers all over the place at the time, I liked tweaking them and I’d been teaching Dean some things, and the clunk came from out there. I go outside, and at first I can’t see anything, and then when I go around my truck, I have to duck the half-apple that comes flying at my face. These two idjits were improvising a little baseball. Sam was wielding a wrench about twice his size like a bat and Dean was throwing apples from the crabapple tree at him to hit. They see me and Dean drops the apple in his hand and looks guilty, and Sammy tries to throw the wrench away. Took my truck window clean out, glass everywhere.”
“Hello,” Castiel said cheerfully enough, and continued hauling the books to the display. “Claire, could you ring him up please?”
Castiel looked down at his own still-full bottle. Dean didn’t have any idea what the mark could do to him - what it was doing to him - and he was meddling with powers that even Castiel couldn’t compare to. How was a mere human going to protect themselves from something even an angel couldn’t fight against? Even if that was human was Dean Winchester.
‘We’re back from our honeymoon!’ Becky sang out behind him, before he could utter a word. They started walking down the steps together, as Dean quickly ran a hand over Castiel’s hair, smoothing it down. He bent forward and straightened Castiel’s tie.
They'd been talking for hours, cocooned in Faith's wings, discussing everything Dean could remember about her childhood. Faith had been surprised when Dean mentioned that she had quickly fallen in love with flying, as her wings were still throbbing and cramping, at least until he pointed out that she could go decent distances without them according to Sam. She sheepishly admitted to jumping the Grand Canyon six months before, expecting Dean to yell at her, but instead he laughed loudly, deeply, and squeezed her shoulders harder.
Castiel shivered as adrenaline shot through him. He wanted to stay in this hallway, in Dean’s arms, for as long as possible. But Dean had made a good point, Michael would be unbearable if he knew that they had come to this auction only to sneak off and make out the whole time. As appealing as that prospect was. He made himself step back, and clear his throat.
He sat down on the floor in front of Dean, and grabbed a bowl of water and some fabric. He wet the fabric, and then started cleaning Dean off.
“I was gonna be, but then my Gram and Gampa showed up. Um, they don’t know about us. I kinda want it to stay that way.”
'If it makes you feel better, I think Metatron's a tool as well. He's going to remain in Heaven's jail even after Faith has her baby.'
Faith decided not to respond, and instead looked over at Junior, who was still unconscious on the backseat. For a moment, she could have sworn his wolf-like features had diminished and showed him as a normal guy, albeit a chiseled, slightly scruffy, good-looking guy. Dean squeezed her shoulder, and the car fell silent until they pulled up outside Ben and Claire's house. Claire passed Faith the keys again, and she went forward to open up the house as everyone else carried Junior into the house, and laid him down on the couch in the front room. They heard crutches tapping on the tiles in the kitchen, and they all looked up as someone hobbled into view. His eyes locked on Faith, and her bump.
'You just need to think about this, Faith. Whatever Gabriel said, whatever's going on, you can't just take off! Come on, everyone is saying you need to think before you act, now is not the time to run! What's Gabriel said to you?'
He resolved not to have any alcohol this time around, ensuring the car was without champagne. He didn’t want Dean to have his drinks tampered with again. If there were anything between the two of them, he wanted it to be organic, and he wanted Dean to remember it.
Jody looked behind her, as though she could see through her own front door, and then she looked at Claire with a fixed smile on her face.
The rookies were put through their paces under the blazing sun, tested for their fighting ability, their endurance, agility, and ability to take orders against those soldiers who wanted to bond with them. Dean sat towards the back of the crowd, and soon found himself watching a particular soldier.
He wanted to approach, to get to know this guy, but how? How? What if they questioned who he was, what he was doing? He knew that, if this was Michael, he would merely introduce himself as a board member without giving too many details away, make some small talk about Edith and walk away with Brother’s real name and number, already putty in his hands. Luke would just walk by confidently, making Brother chase him. Gabriel would prank him and break the ice that way. Balthazar wouldn’t bother with formalities and would stick his tongue down Brother’s throat.
But it didn’t stop Castiel from fantasising about him, pretending it was Dean beside him in the bed. He had tried to sleep with Meg, closing his eyes and imagining Dean but it was too hard. Meg’s breasts were too soft and supple under his hands, her skin was too smooth, she smelled too floral. She complained that Castiel remained too soft, even when she concentrated on his cock. Sometimes, and Castiel felt vile for doing it, but sometimes he would relieve himself in the bathroom before getting into bed. Sleeping with Meg was a step too far, a step he knew he wasn’t willing to take. The few attempts they did make fizzled out quickly, and Castiel would turn his back on her to sleep, until Meg seemed to realise how fruitless it was, and finally gave up.
“We can,” Castiel nodded, trying to react as Cas would, all suave and confident instead of full of crippling self-doubt. But both sides of him wanted that contact with Dean. “And anything you want to say to me, whisper it in my ear. Even if it’s just about the Mayor’s wife and her four chins. It’ll look more couple-y.”
