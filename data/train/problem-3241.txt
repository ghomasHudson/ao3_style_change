Cas nodded and Dean turned his lip up at the nickname. "Pie," Cas whispered and the omega schooled his features.
Castiel sat patiently as Dean gathered his thoughts. Quite frankly, he wasn't sure if he wanted to hear about Dean's abuse or not. He was so attached to the kid that he was dreading the torture that he had endured. The fact that he called it "working" for Alastair made his skin crawl. This spectacular omega thought that what was done to him was his fault and his choice. Cas calmed himself before his scent changed and gave his feelings away. Dean needed to process this. He needed to start his healing process. If he had to live through it, then it was the least Castiel could do was to listen to him.
Dean looked like he had seen a ghost. "Nothing. I was just rambling. Just that we get along so well, ya know?"
Cas smiled, but Dean seemed irritated to have someone so loud and chipper around him at 6:30 in the morning. "We just had breakfast. Ellen made plenty."
Dean's laugh filled Castiel's ears and it was the most infectious sound the alpha had ever heard. Cas was far from immune to his omega's unintentional charm. "You smooth motherfucker. Do you ever say something stupid? Like, ever? Or do you just go around with your suave words and drop all the omega's panties?"
"Then don't think badly of yourself right now. I'm sure that Sam is just as excited as you are. His family was taken from him, just like yours. I'm sure he wants to know he wasn't completely alone in this world."
"Love, man. Like, actual love. It felt like it was in my fucking bones. It was safety and protection and laughter and all of the fucking things that you shouldn't be able to actually feel. But... I did. And I do every fucking time you walk into this room." The more Dean talked, the quieter he spoke.
Cas gingerly got out of bed, careful not to disturb Dean from his peaceful sleep. He had plenty of time before work as he had showered before bed. So, he decided to make breakfast. Eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The whole nine yards, as Dean would say. He placed the eggs and bacon on a plate and sat them in the microwave to keep warm. He fixed a glass of orange juice and put off to the side. Then, he got out the Batman sectional plate that he bought the night before. He carefully cut the pancakes and placed them in the biggest section followed by small pieces of bacon and some berries in the little sections. He poured some orange juice into a matching Robin sippy cup and placed them on the table.
Instead of pulling Dean’s underwear down as he expected, he laid his cock down on Dean’s stomach and smiled. “See, baby boy, that’s how deep Daddy will be in you when I fill you up for the first time. You’re going to be so fucking full of cum. I’ll plug you up and cum in that sweet little hole over and over and over until I can see it. Right here.” When he said those last words, Cas pushed down on Dean’s stomach right above where his cock was laying.
Castiel grabbed Roche by the top of his hair. "I did, 'mega. I'm so sorry that he made you do that."
Castiel let them down slowly and ran his hands over Dean's thighs. "You are so good, baby boy. I love you so damn much."
"I can smell you from here. Just get in already." Dean turned away from the shower head and motioned for Cas to join with a finger.
"Of course, sweet boy. I'll email Mr. Singer right now and let him know that we need Sam's contact information. You too seemed to get along very well, and believe it or not, spending one-hundred percent of your time with a grumpy, old alpha like me isn't very healthy." Cas smiled and Dean shook his head in return.
"You know, we haven't really fooled around yet... I mean, without you being Daddy or me being your baby... I wonder what it would be like to just have Cas and Dean experiment with one another?" Dean kissed up Cas' neck and sucked his earlobe into mouth. He nibbled a little before looking into Cas' eyes. "I mean, I need to know what spots make you shiver and how to touch you, babe. I need some practice."
"I know. I'm... I'm sorry I keep cutting you off, man, but I went through this same process an hour ago. This kid has all the same bruises as the other victims, but it's clear... objects were used on him. The evidence that was around him shows that. Just... toys... all around him." Gabe shivered. "No one touched him while he was there. No one gave him any sense of humanity. He was... just an object to them. From what we can tell, he was one that Alastair took a sick, special interest in." Gabe rested his head against his chair and stared at the ceiling.
Roche gave a dark chuckle and moved his hands to his belt. He looked up and laughed, "Oh, Alastiar certainly does know how to find a good bitch."
"Well, someone braggin' about me woke me up. C'mere, Alpha." Dean moved over and let Cas sit on the bed. Dean laid his head back on Castiel's shoulder as the alpha wrapped his arms around Dean. "You're not in trouble, are you?
"I can make some pretty good dinners, although burnt toast is my specialty." Castiel's dry humor made Dean cackle.
“Motherfucker!” Dean had came without even touching his hole. Fuck. He was looking forward to playing that game with himself. Fucking Cas with his sexy everything.
"It was here when I bought the house. I like the way it looks, I suppose. I just really hate baths. It's like swimming in your own dirt."
"First of all, you need to understand how touch-starved this kid is. He is fighting for his life at this point. He screams when other people try to touch him and he has been extremely aggresive. His brain won't turn off his fight or flight response. I truly think that the only reason he didn't try to attack me was because I wasn't wearing a uniform and I didn't smell like the hospital. Until he allows to someone to touch him, you know that his healing process will take ten times as long." Cas sighed heavily as he turned onto the highway.
Cas could feel Dean nod against his shoulder as his lips found Cas's scent gland. He kissed it softly before licking over it. He was almost reverent in the way he drug his tongue over the small area over and over. "I can taste it. Taste you. It feels right." Cas just hummed in affirmation as Dean continued to lick over his neck. Eventually, the licks turned into soft suckles as the omega drifted off to sleep.
"Hey, I do what I can for those I like. The rest of 'em can screw off." Charlie smiled and took another sip.
"I can make you get off at our house. I promise. As many times as you want." Cas kissed Dean's forehead and lifted himself up to his elbows. "But until we get there, how about this, sweet boy?" Cas lifted two fingers to Dean's mouth and smiled as the omega sucked on them slowly, his tongue moving smoothly and surely around the digits.
"Let's get you home, 'mega-mine." Cas whispered and could tell from Dean's quick nod that his hyper-puppy stage was slowly leaving and his quiet stage was coming. He really didn't want Dean to fall into his quiet stage again. He knew that it was healthy for Dean to do whatever came naturally, but he couldn't help but feel like Dean was having more and more of these periods of silence. Cas was concerned that it would start up one day and not stop.
Cas was relentless. Talking so fucking sweetly as he was doing such dirty, dirty things to Dean. “And after tonight…” Cas kept his hands where they were but looked into Dean’s eyes. Dean gulped. What the fuck was he going to say? This was so fucking sexy. “I want your moans. I want your begging. I want your desperation and your release. I want those little sighs and gasps. I want that tight heat. I want to fill you up, baby. Over and over again until you can’t see straight. I want to be your Daddy and I want to be your lover and I want to fucking wreck you.”
"Of course. By examining the different proteins we can see how closely related two DNA samples are and how their are connected. In Mr. Wesson and Mr. Winchesters case, let's see..." he scrolled down the screen and Dean's grip tightened, "you two share 54% of your DNA. You are biological brothers."
D exhaled loudly and shook his head. Oh, how could Castiel have forgotten. This omega was too big and bad to be caught playing a game. He was certainly not a baby. "Okay, that's fine. Then, maybe you would like to help me test out some other therapy aids? You're my only patient right now, but the ODT is always looking to see how effective different aids would be for other patients. It would be a huge help to get your perspective."
The omega nodded his head once but then immediately shrunk back against the pillows. Castiel gave a small smile and went back to his seat. It was clear this omega had plenty of fight left in him, but he was scared to use it. That's probably what kept him alive this long.
The drive to the hospital was about fifteen minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Castiel kept thinking about what he would see when he got there. He was thinking of bruises and cuts and any other mark that Alastair probably left on this young man. He may even have broken bones. Or worse. At that, Castiel shook his head. There was no need to worry himself with morbid thoughts before he even knew what he was dealing with. The last thing this kid needed was for Cas to come in there with a worried or angry scent. Sure, he used scent-muting body wash, but it wasn't a scent blocker. Those were extremely dangerous to use and Castiel found that his scent was generally helpful in his line of work.
Dean looked up and hit Castiel with a sharp gaze. "Are you kidding me? Why would you want to be tied down to me? You can't smell me. You don't have any obligation to me other than what's in the contract you signed to be my ORS. After everything I just told you about my life- do you really think I wanted to let you know about this damn bond? It would've hurt less when the contract is up. You don't need a fucked up omega leeching off of you for the rest of your life."
"Probably. Anyways, if it happens again, only one or two nurses will be coming in. With his aggression and history, having more people just seems to scare him."
D pushed the bee into Cas' hands and looked at him expectantly. Castiel knew that it probably wasn't the healthiest thing, but he rubbed his wrist on the plushie a few times to put his scent back in the fabric. As soon as it reached D's hands again, he took a deep breath, settled into his spot, and looked at the television.
Cas woke to the sound and movements of an unhappy omega. The clock indicated they had slept until four in the afternoon. He turned on his side and saw Dean's chest rising and falling quickly as his head turned back and forth. This looked like one of the worst nightmares he had had recently.
The omega dropped his free hand beside him, almost in defeat. Cas took it in his slowly and brought his hands together so Dean's were surrounded by his own. "Dean, I promise you that I am not angry with you. I want you to take a deep breath and think about whether or not you can smell anger on me. You know I'm an alpha, right?" Dean nodded. "Okay, so, then you know I wouldn't be able to hide that scent." Dean took a deep breath, but it was full of hiccups. "Try one more time, sweet boy." Dean tried again and this time, it was a continuous breath. He looked up at Cas and his shoulders dropped and he fell back onto the bed. He was exhausted from the fear and panic.
Dean wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but it was nice. The constant thump of Cas’ heart. The way his Daddy’s thumb tasted in his mouth. It made him almost forget how much he wanted to punch the CEO of IKEA in the face. It was perfection. However, they heard the girls coming out of the room and quickly went back to their jobs.
Castiel rummaged through his dresser and found some lounge pants and a much-loved AC/DC shirt for himself. For Dean, he knew he had a few totes of Dean's clothes that he had bought the day he was released from the hospital, but he had a feeling that the omega would prefer to have something with his scent on it. So, he got Dean a pair of boxers from one of the totes and one of his old pullovers from the back of the closet. As far as pants, he picked out a pair of new jeans as well as a pair of flannel pants. He would let Dean choose that.
I am SOOO sorry for the delayed update! We got a rescue dog this weekend, a bit unexpectedly. He was amazing and required all of the attention!
The omega nodded as he ran his fingers over his chest again and stuck them further into his mouth. He began grinding against Cas's tongue so the alpha's nose was tickling his most private parts. Cas could tell he was getting close when his moans became higher pitched and he shot a hand down to his pretty cock. When Dean finally found his release, he couldn't help but to pull Cas in impossibly closer. Cas smiled at the feeling of Dean cleching around his tongue.
Roche shouted, "I didn't--" but his voice was cut off by Castiel slamming his head into the dishwasher.
I am not lying when I say that I thought about this fic and these characters every day. However, other things took my time and creativity.
"Oh, you're going to be 'indecent' with me? Mr. ODT Professional? Mr. Ethical? Mr. By-the-Book? You're going to be indecent?" Dean laughed.
“What the fuck? No! I wasn’t masturbating… I—It’s not that.” He instantly regretted letting those words leave his mouth. Dean thought to himself that it probably would have been easier to go with that lie. He shouldn’t have said anything to contradict Cas’s thought process.
Castiel gave a small smile. "It's not a problem. I was wondering if you have noticed anything about the omega I'm visiting."
Dean listened and continued his work. "Love this cock, alpha." Cas couldn't control to whine that came from his throat. Such a sweet boy he had. His whine quickly turned into a shocked moan when Dean ran his tongue over the tip. "Fuck, alpha, this is addicting." With that comment, Dean went back to sucking and licking and slurping over Cas's cock. He didn't have a technique, per say, but he was exploring every inch of Cas's body and it was magnificent. Dean showed no sign of stopping.
This caused Dean to stop for a moment. He tried to start a few words, but his lips ultimately crashed into Cas's. The alpha couldn't help the surprised noise that came from his throat as he wrapped his arms around Dean. "My alpha. No one else gets to have you. You are mine."
Cas shut the bathroom door halfway as he took care of his morning routine. He looked in the mirror and shook his head. His torso and neck were littered with small red and purple marks. He had one territorial omega. He loved it.
As I said earlier, this was going to go with the previous chapter, but it was a little too long. Going ahead and warning you-- the next chapter will be all plot. Sorry! But, hey, you just got two delicious little chapters.
"The hell? Who would've made this test a priority?" Dean looked up at Cas. The alpha shrugged. He really had no idea.
"When you gonna mate me, Cas?" This was at least the tenth time Dean had asked since the two had found their places on the bed. He ran his nose up Cas's jaw, as was his custom during their close-contact therapy sessions.
Dean listened and began grinding back onto Castiel's face. "A... Alpha... Cas... I'm... I'm so close, please..." His once deep groans were now high-pitched gasps and pleas.
"That's good." Castiel tried to not let his disappointment show through. Dean was a victim of sadistic, long term abuse. He needed time before he would be comfortable seeing Cas without his usual layers on.
Cas took a deep breath and entered into room 327 again. He looked over to D and noticed that the stuffed bee was missing. Of course, the omega was faking sleep again, but Castiel could see the shape of the bee under the covers. Cas smiled and sat down in his chair. He read for a few pages before looking up at the omega again. His eyes were still closed. "You know, D, you're allowed to keep that bee. It's all yours."
Around five in the morning, Castiel could tell that his scent was changing from uncomfortable to something akin to complete irritation when Dean rubbed his chest and whispered "Just noise, alpha. Sleep." Then the heat turned on, the blinds shifted and let in some light, and Dean growled.
He couldn't help but notice how both of them were smiling so much in the kiss. It was less of lips and teeth and tongue, and more of smiling and breathing in the same air.
Cas pulled a pillow between their torsos so the only part of their bodies that could touch were their heads if they laid down. Which, Dean seemed to want to do. So, there they were, a medical professional and an neglected omega, as close as they could get when Dr. Roche walked in.
"I had noticed that they had lessened for a while, but it does seem like they are becoming more frequent again."
"Wonderful. Maybe you can tell me about how you want to wind down when we get home or how you want to relax?"
"Please, then, tell me what this is ab--" Castiel stop talking mid-sentence and cocked his head curiously at the untouched pie to his left. "Something must be bothering you."
“Sorry I snuck up on ya.” Dean crossed the floor and wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist. He was taller than Cas, so he easily rested his chin on the other man’s shoulder. “Thank you for cooking, babe.”
Dean's eyes crinkled as he smiled and shrugged. He held his hand up with his thumb and index finger close together.
"Oh, my goodness, I was in such a tizzy that I didn't introduce myself properly. I'm Suzanne Wesson. My husband, David, is in his office putting some things away, but he should be down soon. Please, come in." Suzanne stepped to the side and gestured for the couple to enter the home.
Suddenly, Daddy was right beside him and whispering in his ear. “What do you think your punishment is, baby boy?”
“Well, for me… I want this.” Dean gestured around himself. “I still want us to be best friends and roommates. I still want us to live the way we’ve always lived together. But… I, uh… want to be able to kiss you when I want and I want you to, uh, make love or whatever, to me…”
"Yes, absolutely. If you look at different fMRI and CT scans on people who have experienced abuse, you will see that having a strong bond with a mate can help their brains... wake up, for a lack of a better term. This has been documented more with omegas than other designations, so I was not surprised by his quick improvement. His body needed much more time to heal."
Sam nodded and looked away from Cas. The alpha couldn't tell what the kid was thinking about, but it seemed that the wheels in his head were turning rather quickly.
Cas groaned and ran his hand down Dean's back. "Well, why don't we get this blanket off of us, hm?" Dean kept his head in the same spot as he kicked the comforter down the bed. Castiel could tell that he was nervous about getting out of his comfort zone. It appeared that Dean was not very keen on moving from his spot. "Now, hold my hand."
"Yea, but let me get some more good news first." Gabriel's scent changed to something slightly sour before he took another bite of his candy.
Around 8:15, Cas caught sight a gruff man came walking into the station with his arms full of papers. He walked straight to Gabe's office. "C'mon, baby. I think the lawyer is here. I need to talk to him. You can come with me and watch TV on Gabe's computer, okay?"
Dean looked at him and nodded once. Despite how hard he was trying to appear tough, it was clear he was excited.
Dean's muscles were finally back online and he leaned in to kiss Cas. His boyfriend, his daddy, his lover, his everything.
As he turned towards the bathroom, Cas thought to himself "I will never get used to that." Dean was standing with his forehead pressed into the shower wall as he let the water run down his back. His eyes were closed and his lips were parted slightly. His muscles flexed as he stretched his arms above his head.
When Cas tried to let Dean go, the younger man grabbed his wrist and rubbed it along his neck. "Wanna smell like you. New place."
"Well... that's a good reason to share. My date and the old lady walked out and the older gentlemen held his arm up to hold the door for me to leave... but he was much taller than I was so, to me, in that moment... I thought he was trying to hug me."
Castiel was sure that there must have been a gas leak or something similar in the doctor's office. There was no other reason that he should be crying this much. It wasn't a sobbing, from deep-down-in-your-gut cry. It was a free-flowing tears and laughter cry. Celebrations and togetherness. Watching Dean hold his little brother, one of the missing pieces in his life, made Cas's heart swell with pride and happiness. He found his family. The odds were incredible, but Dean seemed to be an omega with a penchant for giving the odds a kind "fuck you."
"Of course I want to be intimate with you, Dean, but I'm concerned about how well I'll control myself. Perhaps you could... maybe it would be best if you were on top?"
Looking back, Dean supposed it was never about the thumb-sucking alone. It was about feeling safe, comforted, and full in all of the right ways. It completed him when he was at his most vulnerable. So, when Cas promised to fill him up in a way he was too scared to ask for himself, Dean tensed up in pleasure and anticipation. It was going to happen. The man he had loved for years was finally going to open him up and give him what he wanted.
"Home? Stay home?" Dean's breathing continued to be erratic. He grabbed Cas's hand and rubbed his wrist all over his neck and cheeks. Castiel knew that Dean wanted his scent on him, but he also suspected that after so long without touch, the omega wanted a concrete reminder that Cas wasn't leaving him and that he was safe.
Dean slowly made his way out of bed, putting one of Cas’ t-shirts from his dresser on as he went. “Daddy?” Dean called into the living room and kitchen. Daddy wasn’t there. Hm. He walked into the kitchen. Nothing. Where was he? Dean needed his Daddy. Where had he gone? He needed to talk to Daddy, to Cas, to know that everything was still okay.
When the nurse came in, Castiel stepped outside long enough for D to use the restroom and get his medicine. After that, the nurse came out and smiled. "Whatever you're doing, keep doing it. He growled at me a few times, but he didn't throw anything."
Dean gave a brief wave as they pulled out of the parking lot before doubling over with his head between his legs. "Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck..."
“Don’t apologize. I was just grabbing my watch to go to work. I’ll see you this afternoon.” Cas really wanted to skirt around Dean and ignore the shame he was feeling rise in his cheeks.
Charlie nodded. "It is. Everything seems to be going to plan as far as his mental health. Well... as far as we can tell. He's the only kid we've ever seen with these extreme problems. It's physical. We've had him here for a little less than three days. With the amount of antibiotics and care he has received, the mild infection he had should be gone by now." Before Castiel could question Charlie about the infection, she put her hand up.
He frowned and took the bag over to the bed. He sat down and tried to keep his eyes from watering. Sure, he didn’t have any pictures of him and Cas, but Cas was always taking pictures. Yea, they lived together, but this made Dean reconsider everything. What if Cas didn’t want to be his Daddy all the time? What if it was just out of pity? Was he as important to Cas and Cas was to him? Cas worked at a counseling facility, so this could easily be his way of trying to help with Dean's fucked up mind.
"I have an idea, D. Why don't we get everything you want today for the bedroom and for the living room. Then, maybe tomorrow, we can go get your phone set up and get anything else that you want for the bathroom and kitchen?" Cas knew if he didn't cut the kid off, that he wasn't stopping any time soon. Charlie was right with her prediction in the hospital.
Castiel looked up and Charlie and she gave him a small smile with tears in her eyes. Either D was going to improve or he was going to die. There was no in between. Everyone in room 327 knew that as a fact, the omega himself included.
"Fuck!" Dean couldn't remember a time that Cas had ever gotten so loud. "You're a fucking filthy little boy, baby." He pushed Dean forward a bit. "Keep your fingers right there, baby." Dean followed his instructions, curious as to what was coming next. "Fucking... dirty, baby." Then he felt Cas spank his hole. His actual hole.
Since checking his email only took about five minutes, Cas decided to sit down and watch some TV. He had been hooked on Orange is the New Black lately and he was excited to watch the next episode. Right as he was about to press play, he heard something move in the bedroom.
Castiel was certain that if D heard his thoughts about "snuggling" with the bee that he would have his head on a plate. No, he was sure that D considered this to be something much more "grown-up," like protecting the bee from the hands of Dr. Roche. It was admirable.
"Okay... okay... Our bags are still packed. I'll get Dean and we'll be ready to go as soon as they get here."
Castiel was seething. Thank God for scent-muting body wash. "Sir, with all due respect, this patient needs to be your top priority. He needs constant attention and care."
When he arrived on the third floor, all eyes at the nurses' station turned to him. He froze. Charlie walked over to him. "Hey, Angel."
Gabe sat down at this announcement and threw away his lollipop. He put on his professional face and grabbed his notebook. Bobby clicked his pen and sat ready to write, as well.
He did not look at the omega, but he didn't need to to know that the kid was staring him down. The kid didn't have a scent, but Cas could literally feel the anger rolling off of him. He was sure that if he looked over that he would get a bedpan thrown at him. "My name is Castiel. I'm an omega rehabilitation specialist." The omega rolled over away from him. "Since you don't want me to talk to you, I'll just read okay? Let me know if you need anything." He still didn't look up at the omega. He could see the kid's head look back at him over his shoulder out of his peripheral vision. Castiel was done talking for the moment so he began reading.
Dr. Roche was clearly not prepared for that line of questioning. "I... I think he should be able to say something. That will show marked growth from any data point we have and then you can stay on his care team. Until then, I want you gone. It's about to be 5. Visiting hours will be over. I suggest you get your things together."
Sure, the trial was coming up, but Singer would handle that. No, he couldn't smell Dean yet, but it would come. All of the little mundane inconveniences like remembering to pay the water bill, what he would cook for dinner, and how he was going to fit everything on his to-do list into his schedule rolled off of Cas's back and down the drain. Nothing else mattered except that he and Dean were safely together.
“Yes, really. Take your shower, without jerking off, and then come eat lunch. If you don’t do as your owner said, then you’ll have consequences, dear.” Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s cock and stroked it until it was fully hard. “Now, go follow Daddy’s rules.”
Cas didn't say anything, but held his hands out closer to Dean. The omega rolled his eyes and angrily held onto Cas. "I can't speak for anyone else, Dean. I can't answer those questions. I wish I could. I pray that I could give you a simple answer that could explain everything you've been through and wrap all of the knowledge that you need in a nice, pretty bow, but I can't. I can't do that. I can tell you, though, that I want you. You are my home now and I would be absolutely lost without you." Cas hoped that Dean could smell his sincerity.
Dean nodded and slowly turned around to face the wall. He shivered as his cock touched the tile. "What... what're you gonna do to me, alpha?" He was clearly drunk on lust. Castiel loved it.
The two stayed in that somewhat uncomfortable position until they reached their destination. Sam's junker seemed quite out of place in front of the home. It was parked on the street instead of the two-car garage was attached to the multi-story brick home. Castiel was no contractor or architect, but he was certain that the home was at least 3,000 square feet. While it was not a mansion, per se, the immaculate flower beds and front porch furniture made him feel as if his one bedroom was quite inadequate. He could feel Dean's tension, though, and remembered that their home was perfect for them.
<<From Cas: Well, little one, if you can get through the day with no more mess ups... I have the most wonderful surprise for you.
Cas slowly helped him up out of his high chair and tried to ignore the delicious sound of Dean's whine and the squelch that accompanied him getting off of the dildo. "Good boy." He didn't need to be horny during after care.
“Yea… I like sucking my paci, Daddy. It feels good.” He shyly ducked down under the covers and closed his eyes.
Castiel closed the door quietly and waved to Charlie who was returning from another patient's room. "Hey, I'm going to run home and do a couple of things. If he wakes up, let him know that I'm coming back soon." Castiel handed Charlie his card. "If there's any emergency, here's my personal cell."
Dean looked up, confused and sleepy. Cas kept eye contact as he put something to Dean’s lips. “Open.” Dean did as he was told. The mystery excited him. Then he realized Cas had put a pacifier in his mouth. A fucking pacifier. That’s what he had gone and bought. He should be irritated and angry. He wasn’t a baby. But… the feeling of something different than his own thumb was exhilarating. It tasted different. A little like plastic, but a hint of sweetness. The feeling compounded with Cas’ arms and scent made him feel more comfortable that he ever had. “Suck.” Dean instantly began sucking the pacifier and he kept his eye contact with Cas. “Good, baby. You’re such a good boy.”
“I more than hate it. I… fucking hate it! I hate it more than… I don’t know. I just hate it. I can't even pronounce the name of this damn shelf! Nothing makes sense and fuck these instructions and—“ Dean went on his rant for a few more minutes while angrily screwing in half-screws before Cas had had enough. The two men had been friends long enough for Cas to know that this rant was far from over. If history was any indication, then chances were that it would keep unraveling until Dean was venting about someone at work.
Dean cleared his throat. "Well... maybe I spoke..." He took a calming breath. Cas tried to put his hand on Dean's thigh, but it didn't seem to help. "Maybe I spoke too soon. Those... those newspaper articles that you found are probably about my parents with those dates, but that... I guess that that don't automatically mean that we're brothers." Dean trailed off and looked out of the window.
"Save that delicious smell for when we're at home, okay, baby?" Dean winked and began pushing a cart towards the home goods section.
"Mom? Gone. Dad? Gone. Foster homes just didn't give a fuck. Ended up with Alastair. And now? Now I find out that I may have a brother who got to get out of the fucking system? It shouldn't, but it makes me so mad! I mean, how could I forget him? How could I be that damn irresponsible? How could I... why was I the one no one ever wanted?" Dean walked up to Cas. His tears were still flowing, but he was full of anger instead of sadness. The omega jabbed himself in the chest. "Why did no one want me?"
Dean walked into the bathroom and let the water begin heating up. As he did, he stripped off his boxers and threw them in the hamper. Then, happy as he could possibly be, he walked back into the kitchen with his cock hanging half-hard between his legs. “Hey, babe, are the towels already in the closet?”
"So hard for me, omega." Cas tilted his head down and caught Dean's lips in a kiss as he moved their hands around his shaft. Dean sucked in a breath as Cas led his hand up and down, twisting at the top. While they continued to stroke Cas's cock, Cas's other hand cradled the back of Dean's head.
Dean couldn't speak he was laughing so hard. Tears were forming, but Cas was proud that they were from laughter that he caused.
"Thanks, Dean. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it." Sam smiled and put the dipstick back in its place.
"Well, apart from the car, I'm doing well. Excited, nervous. Pretty much the same as Dean, I'm guessing."
“Fuckin’ a!” So, as it turns out, IKEA bookshelves are a bit of a bitch to construct. Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak were not exempt from this rule.
Dean's jaw dropped. "Well, damn, Cas! Just put it all out there." This was going to be harder, much harder than he thought. He figured Cas would be like "B. Butt stuff. Yes or no? Continuing." Not this full-on conversation bull shit!
"Yes, but again, remember that this may be his first, middle, or last name. Perhaps even a family name. I just want us to proceed with all of the caution that we can."
When the credits began, D gave a soft snarl. "There's a sequel coming out in a couple of months. I know I was upset with that cliffhanger, too." Castiel couldn't help but chuckle as D motioned at the screen with one hand and looked at Cas with disbelief. "I know. It was criminal leaving us to wonder, wasn't it." D let out a huff and shook his head. "D, whenever you start talking again, you're going to have plenty of opinions to share aren't you?" D gave an over-exaggerated smile. His good eye crinkled and his nose scrunched up as much as it could with the bandage over it. "Well then, friend, I look forward to hearing every one of them."
"Yea, I know why I need to talk about all of this shit." Dean smiled up at Cas. "I don't want to, though. Not yet."
Instead of growling like he did when the first met, Dean shivered pleasantly at the sound of his designation. "My best alpha." Dean turned his head and began giving Cas a matching mark on the other side of his neck.
"I got in no problem. Got some food. When I turned to leave, this guy was just standing there watching me. He got this weird look on his face and just smiled at me. He asked me how I managed to get in. I figured at this point I was caught, might as well come clean. I told him I picked the back door open." Dean shook his head bitterly. "Should've left then. But, he told me he was impressed that I could break into a lock that advanced. Offered me a job."
As soon as he stood, Dean was reminded of just how fucking sexy all of this was. He saw clothes all over the floor, his squirrel in the chair, and various, shall we say “supplies,” like lube and the pacifiers littered the desk. He was totally fine living the rest of his life exactly like this.
Castiel looked down at D and smiled. D gave a silent laugh and shrugged one shoulder as to say "yea, what can you do? I'm great."
"Okay, just don't get too hopeful. I'll talk to you tomorrow, Gabe." As Castiel hung up, he took a deep breath. He was looking forward to seeing D again. He knew that it was going to be a slow process, but he could not wait to see how he was doing today.
Sam grabbed him quickly. The look on Dean's face showed that Sam's surprise hug did, indeed, surprise him. He smiled and wrapped his arms carefully around the beta. "Want us to wait with you, Sammy?"
For one, Dean was up and in the shower before Cas had even managed to acknowledge that it was a new day. Secondly, he came out of the shower dressed in jeans and a black t-shirt rather than his usual boxers and hoodie combo. He had even gelled his hair. He wasn't necessarily in his hyper-mode, but he couldn't stop pacing.
"Well, I was thinking that maybe I could soak in that big garden tub that I saw and you could take a shower at the same time." Dean blushed. "I, uh... I don't think I want to be in a room by myself right now."
Castiel could never deny his Omega of anything. He added a third finger and rubbed his thumb across Dean's rim. He lifted himself up and kissed the shell of Dean' ear. "Come for me, baby boy. I want you to come for me, 'mega."
"Alpha, you shouldn't be jealous of him. He's the kind of guy I want to get a beer with and hang out with while we watch TV or throw a football around with. He's not the kind of guy you are."
Cas stared at her. "There's no way. Not with the amount of communication he can give. Sure, it's minimal and nonverbal, but it's something. His mental state seems stable."
"Motherfucker," he muttered to himself. "Yea, Bobby?" He said a little louder while he was rubbing his head.
Cas removed the pan from the burner and turned around. “Dean, I need to us to talk like adults for a minute.”
Dean's whines pushed Cas to add a bit of teeth and suck on the omega's rim. It tasted like heaven and he didn't even have a scent yet. He would never grow tired of this. "I want you to come for me, sweet boy."
Oh, great. Here it comes. Dean seriously could not take this. He could not accept losing this. This was a one-time thing and Cas was going to end it. He had taken away his paci. It was done. Dean turned over and held his blanket tight. He couldn’t help that tears started to form.
"Yogurt with honey it is, then. I'll be on the phone with the cafeteria while she helps you out, okay?
"Sweet boy, remember, I still can't smell you. I didn't fall in love with you because of your scent or because of a chemical reaction. I fell in love with you because you simply exist. When I first laid a hand on you, I was lost. I am yours, Dean. And you are mine."
"I'll get some after while. Hey, come in here for a minute, and I'll let you know the run down of today's schedule. It's not too much." Gabriel balanced his pie from A Little Slice of Heaven in one hand and fumbled with his office keys with the other.
"It's touch therapy, doctor. You said you were okay with this after you saw that his infection stabilized." Castiel made no effort to move and Dean just moved closer to him. Cas could feel Dean's anger seeping into the room. The kid had no scent, but you always knew where you stood with him.
Cas quickly readjusted so he was laying down, propped up by a couple of pillows, so Dean could rest his head on his chest while he read. Sure enough, Dean quickly crowded into his space, wrapping his arms around his waist and looking up at the book. “Can I have my paci while you read?”
Dean just let out a pained moan and rolled over. His nose found Cas' scent gland quickly. He breathed in deeply, although unevenly and shakily. After about five minutes or so, Dean was calm enough to speak again. "Any," another hiccup, "anyways, I was down there for two years I guess. Never thought I would ever get out. No one even knew I existed. No one out there looking for me. Gave up on life. Lost my scent. Couldn't talk. Then that guy broke down the door and shoved his gun in Alastair's face. I thought he was going to kill us all, but then I saw the badge. I think that was the first time I smiled in two years. I shut my eyes and then I woke up here."
He slid down the bed and moved Dean wordlessly until he was on his stomach. He kissed right under Dean's hole as he spread him further. The sound of Cas' licking mixed with Dean's panting. Cas licked slowly and teased the outside of Dean's rim with his thumb. He continued his teasing until Dean began rocking back against his mouth. Castiel wasn't sure if his omega was even conscious of his movements. The alpha then let his Mate have some relief and slowly pushed his tongue inside.
"You got him? Are you serious? You got Alastair?" Castiel immediately smiled and clapped his hands a couple of times. "Oh, wow! Gabe, that is wonderful! We've been trying to track him down for what, five or six years?"
To absolutely no one's surprise, Dean was right. He was completely distracted about what Cas had planned when he got home. Today was filled with standard things-- oil changes, tire rotations, and two air filters that needed to be changed. At this point all of that stuff was muscle memory, so Dean let his mind wander. What was Cas going to do to him? Make him keep his cock warm while he watched TV? Spank him red for being so dirty from work and tracking something onto the carpet? Fill him up over and over until Dean came on his cock?
Around three in the morning, the siren of an incoming ambulance woke Cas out of his sleep. Groggily, he reclined the chair back further and turned on his side. After a few moments, he opened his eyes to find Dean staring back at him.
"Thank you for letting me know. And my name is Castiel, by the way. I'm sure we are going to be seeing quite a bit of one another."
"Well, that..." Castiel cleared his throat. "I think that can be arranged." Maybe he didn't need as much time as Cas thought. True Mates and all that.
"Yea, a job. With room and board. When you're a sixteen-year-old with no where to go and no roof over your head, you don't even ask what the job is. So, I said yes."
"I hit my peak around 3 in the afternoon, too." Cas kissed Dean's forehead and laid down. He chuckled as Dean climbed on top of him.
"A job?" Castiel was trying his best not to tear the rail off of Dean's bed. The son of a bitch probably gave Dean over to Alastair.
"I'm alright. I'm not some delicate flower that's gonna break." He chuckled, but took the water anyways.
When Castiel returned with a plate of lasagna and salad, he decided it best to bring Dean a napkin. He would hate for the kid to burn himself. He saw Dean take a deep breath and a sated grin crossed his face. "Does it smell good?"
"Oh, please. I'll count it as a business lunch and get reimbursed. You're saving me money." Bobby laughed and walked out of The Roadhouse with Sam.
The next morning, Castiel woke up with equal parts concern and excitement. He was obviously concerned for this young omega and wanted to work with him until he was able to talk and take care of himself. He was also excited to meet him. Someone who had survived for this long without physical touch was unheard of. He must be an extremely resilient and brave young man. Castiel knew that he would learn so much and he hoped he could serve the omega the best that he could.
"It sounds like his mental state was much stronger and stable than his physical." Bobby kept his eyes on his paper.
When Castiel opened the door, he was certain that he stopped breathing. He, Castiel Novak, was the first man on Earth that did not require oxygen to survive. He just needed the sight before him. Dean was standing in the shower, massaging his scalp with Cas's shampoo. He could tell from the scent. His once so obvious bruises, welts, and cuts were hardly noticeable against his somehow-always tan skin. His head was tipped back, eyes closed, and lips parted. Dean finished rinsing his hair and let a quiet moan escape from his throat.
The sun filtered through the sheer curtains in room 327 and Castiel slowly blinked himself awake. He looked over to his left and saw D still sound asleep. Bee was clutched tightly to the omega's chest and his hand was still palm up from where Castiel had held it the night before. The omega's soft snores filled the room, along with the sound of his heart monitor, the IV drip, and the muted sounds of hospital staff running around the hallway.
"Gabe, I really don't want to know. I'm about to get out of the car and the last thing I want is for him to smell anger, pity, or concern on me. He's a headstrong one, that D, and I know he would shut down if I came in there with anything other than a calm attitude."
Shout out to @jessicascastiel on the old Tikky-Tok for an awesome edit that inspired part of this chapter! It is linked at the end of the chapter.
"No, I said that he gave no response. Hold on," Castiel set his bag in the passenger seat of his car. Armed with a weaponry of soft toys, block puzzles, and case information, he was ready for his second visit with D. "Sorry, I was getting everything in the car."
The alpha smiled and placed his coffee mug on the counter. He walked over Dean and wrapped his arms around his waist. "I know, D. It's okay to feel nervous."
Dean walked to the bathroom to get a rag and he felt… strange. Not a bad strange. It was just strange to feel content after being denied and punished. He felt nice. Which made him feel absolutely peculiar. When Dean returned to the living room with a warm, damp rag, he ran it over Cas’ chest slowly. “It’s a shame all this is going to waste. I have so many places you could’ve put it.”
I completely understand how conflicted you may be this morning. This is the breakfast that I’ve fixed for you, baby boy. If you don’t want to be little today—or ever again, for that matter—I completely understand. Eggs and bacon are in the microwave and a glass of orange juice is on the counter. This is your choice, Dean. I will know what you chose when I finish getting ready for work. If you want me to take care of you, then eat this breakfast and began tackling the to-do list on the back of this page. Otherwise, eat the other and go about your day off as usual. Either way, I respect your decision.
"So, any news?" Dean, oblivious to Cas's thoughts, bounced around the living room like a chihuahua on speed. Cas figured that he was a bit like an old blood hound with the amount of energy he had at the moment.
The alpha smiled at Dean's pouting and wrapped his arms around the other man. They had settled into the couch cushions, ready to watch some boring documentary before Dean's stomach told them that their plans had changed. Cas was sitting in a corner of the sofa with one foot on the floor and the other leg stretched out across the other cushions. Dean had found a comfy spot between Cas's legs and immediately claimed the alpha's chest as his head rest. "Sweet boy, you know that you're hungry. As soon as I push 'play' on the remote your stomach will make a fuss again. Come on, why don't you come with me into the kitchen?"
"No more calling you, omega, huh? What should I call you?" Almost instantly, the kid stopped growling and seemed to be surprised. He cocked his head and narrowed his eyes.
Without a word, Cas began brushing his teeth. It took a hot minute, but Dean joined in eventually. He was super confused. Why were they brushing their teeth? Together? At 10 o'clock? After Dean made a complete ass of himself?
Castiel thought for a moment. He would never allow something so personal during a routine case, but this was far from routine. He needed Dean to stay calm and to not develop separation anxiety. Leaving the coat was a better option than giving in to Dean's desire for Castiel to just never leave. "Sure, bud. You can keep my jacket."
"You don't think you deserve to be saved." Cas didn't say this as a question. It was a fact. Dean saw himself as someone less than human.
With that, Cas kissed Dean’s forehead, promised to be home at three like always, and walked out of the room. He couldn’t wait to get home.
"Oh, good, you're awake! Have you heard from Mr. Singer yet about Sam's contact information? I know that you were going to message him last night, but I don't know if you were able to or not, and I-" Cas put a finger to Dean's lips.
A smile crossed his face as Cas clicked his pen and prepared to write some quick notes. He hated writing in complete sentences- he saved that for when he typed his notes. Gabriel always questioned why he didn't just type them to begin with, but Cas enjoyed the feeling of a smooth pen gliding across the paper. It just seemed more... official, for a lack of a better word. He looked over the notes he had already written the day previous.
Castiel began thinking over any mention of a brother, or of a close friend, from Dean's childhood, but he came up blank. The omega had never mentioned any connections of import to him except for his abusers. Castiel remembered that Dean had mentioned having an imaginary friend named Sammy when he was younger, but surely Dean would have remembered that he had a younger brother.
"So, if I said I was ready right now, you would do it?" Dean's eyes shifted between Cas's eyes and lips.
While he didn't receive an affirmative answer, Castiel took the "humph" from Dean as a positive sign. Slowly, Dean moved back to sit on the other end of the couch. Castiel couldn't be sure, but he thought that Dean might have said something along the lines of "stupid alpha being all stupidly protective."
Dean's words were cut short by a nurse that Castiel didn't know came into the room. "Good morning, boys. Breakfast order needs to be in in the next few minutes. Mr. Novak, could you get that done while I help our patient with his morning needs?"
"Oh, yea... I kind of forgot about that. I haven't watched Netflix or Hulu or whatever in a long time." Dean's smile left for a moment, but he shook his head and continued on.
Dean slowly pushed his ass back onto Cas’ morning wood and smirked as he heard a quiet gasp from the other man. Daddy was a hard sleeper, so Dean rubbed himself onto him a little harder. Still not fully awake. Feeling adventurous, Dean drug one of Cas’ hands up to his mouth and began sucking on his index finger. After a few moments, and contemplating if he should just get up, Dean felt Cas grind his hips up and felt that enormous cock sliding up and down his ass. He also felt the hand around this waist move and grip his hip. The finger in his mouth pushed in deeper.
"Hey, Sam." Dean gave a nervous smile and found his seat directly across from the kid he had been raving about all morning. He seemed to be holding his excitement in quite well.
The kid instantly went rigid and lifted his head slowly, baring his teeth and growling. He looked like a rabid dog. "I will never touch you without your consent. The doctors are coming soon to see how your body reacts. D, I would be honored if you would please hold my hand." D sat the bee down and sat up to his full height. Cas was right, he was tall. If he ever got some meat back on his bones, this would be an omega that could fuck someone up. The growl got louder. Cas backed up. He didn't want to threaten the kid.
After Dean showered and ate lunch with Cas, the two finished getting ready and headed out the door. It was like any other time they left together; Dean with a Henley and distressed jeans (from
Sooo originally, I planned for this to be about 15k words, but now I don't even know when it's going to end. This chapter was getting super long, so I thought I would chop it in two.
"Be patient with him. He has so many physical obstacles to overcome at this point that I'm not truly ready to tackle speech therapy, touch reconciliation, or even word association. I'm just going to read today- like I did yesterday- and try to talk to him about once an hour or so."
Cas chuckled and covered Dean's hands with his own. "So, A. I think of asphyxiation, anal play, and age play."
Instead of a verbal response, Dean turned on his side and patted his hand on the bed beside him. Cas found himself far too willing to hold the omega until he was back asleep. Castiel took the blanket with him and covered himself up before opening an arm for Dean. Dean moved into his space quickly. The only skin-to-skin contact was Dean's forehead smushed against Cas' throat, but it was so nice to know that Dean was getting what he needed. It was also nice to know that Cas was the one meeting those needs.
He felt Cas stiffen and before he could process what was happening, he was suddenly on his back. Cas' hand gripped his chin and pulled him closer. "You may not be my baby boy right now, but you are still
The rest of the men stood in Gabe's office, stunned. Gabriel spoke up. "Cas, has he touched anyone--"
He felt Cas' fingers lightly scratching up and down his back. "Just a minute, baby. Then we need to talk, okay?"
Cas decided to show him some mercy. He walked over to his boy, slowly, and pushed down on his shoulders. "Stay," Dean whined as the toy filled him up, "now, I'm going to feed you dinner. For dessert, you're going to have a nice surprise, okay? You'll get some yummy dessert if you keep your cummies to yourself, understood?"
Castiel stood and put his book down. "Hello, I'm Castiel Novak. I am this patient's rehabilitation specialist from the ODT." He reached out his hand, but did not get the handshake he was expecting.
"But it's cool as all get out, man!" Gabe stuck the lollipop in his mouth as he backed away from Cas, but stayed crouched away from the window. "A touch-starved omega with aggression problems becomes instant besties with some random beta? That's weird. Cool as fuck, but weird."
Dean simply leaned into the touch and rubbed his cheek against Castiel's palm. Castiel didn't dare move his head or his hands. He didn't know how long they sat there. Enjoying one another's presence and the feel of the other beneath their hands. "Sweet boy, would you like to help me work and get your mind off of things? I know you're still a little worried."
"D..." Dean simply grunted in response as he ran his hands down Castiel's chest. "D... can you turn around for me?"
Cas passed over the plate and the napkin and Dean's eyes widened as the food got closer. "I'm going to need you to make this at least once a week from now until forever."
Dean ran back into the bedroom, trying to find his phone to call Cas. Once he turned the light on, his toy squirrel, his blanket, and two books laying on the desk caught his eye. On top of them was a note. “Choose your bedtime story. Daddy’s taking a shower. I’ll be in soon to read to you and get you to bed. Love you, baby. You were perfect today.”
Dean sat with his jaw on the floor. Seriously, he was pretty sure he could feel the linoleum on the bottom of his chin. “D-daddy?”
"Well, we needed to get started. It's getting late." Cas smiled and rubbed his thumbs over Dean's hands.
“Promise, Dean.” Cas rubbed his back and kissed the top of his head. “I have, uh… I’ve been yours since the day we met. Do you want to know what I want?”
"Probably. We'll do all of the exercises and everything at home, of course, so he certainly won't backslide like a lot of patients do when they're released."
And so began a normal conversation between the two men. Laundry was always a point of contention. It really was astounding how even though their relationship had changed so much, so quickly… everything was still oddly the same.
, too bad." Dean smiled and moved until he was sitting criss-cross with his chin resting in his hands. Bee was watching from between his elbows.
“Good boy, you’re already two minutes in. Keep up that good work.” Only two minutes? He wasn’t even halfway done and his cock was painfully pressing into the mattress. If it wasn’t for the hypnotic way Cas touched him inside, then Dean probably would’ve gone soft from how hard his cock pushed into one of the mattress springs. He was sure he let out some moans and grunts, but he couldn’t hear due to the blood rushing in his ears. If Daddy would just add another finger, then he would be able to cum and have a cool down before his next punishment. It would be worth it if he could just cum from his daddy’s fingers.
"Yea, sweet boy. Let's go." Cas struggled to move through the house to his computer, but Dean was already standing by the desk and shifting nervously from one foot to another.
“Oh, I, I don’t know, Daddy.” Dean looked down and felt his blood rising up to his cheeks. Less was going to his dick, so that was a good thing.
Dean turned on shaking legs and Cas could see how hard he was breathing. Cas looked up at him and smiled before cleaning all of Dean's mess with his tongue. Once Dean was completely clean again, Cas took his now soft cock into his mouth. He sucked a few times before withdrawing it and standing up. "You... you are so perfect, Dean."
Cas just shook his head. "Anyways, yes, the kid has made a lot of progress. For one, he allowed me to hold his hand. Turns out he had, or has, a serious infection and needed some form of touch to stabilize him. The doctor explained that the only options were to let him die from infection or risk touch shock."
D nodded and let his eyes flick down to the bed. He began toying with a loose thread on his sheet. Cas closed his eyes and clenched his fist. This kid was at a level 6 pain, but considered it a 1 because of how shitty his life had been before. Cas had seen something similar in an alpha war veteran he worked with prior to his omega certification. The minor aches and strains were nothing compared to the shrapnel hitting his leg, so he considered the current pain to be negligible. It certainly was not. Any other person would be in bed crying in agony. This kid was tough as nails.
Castiel gave a firm nod and left his omega in the bathroom. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. He had his Mate in his house and he was about to get naked and they were about to do something and he was freaking out a little bit. All of their confidence was gone now that this was actually happening. It had been almost two years since he had been with anyone. He had forgotten about how panic-inducing sleeping- showering- with someone could be. Especially someone that you care for so deeply.
Dean was slowly calming down and his breathing was returning back to normal. Regardless, Castiel knew he needed to let the doctor know that Dean was a possible self-harm patient. It seemed that self-inflicted punishment was not unfamiliar to the omega. Castiel reminded himself that he couldn't go down that road with Dean in the room. Not where he could smell his emotions so clearly. He continued to praise Dean for simply existing. "Not to mention, the best young man this hospital has ever had the privilege of caring for."
That was how Castiel found the two of them ending most of their days together that week. It was domestic bliss. There was really no other way to describe it. The threat of the trial was looming in the back of both of their minds and Cas could always see a police cruiser in front of the house, but this was as close to perfect as his life had ever been.
Dean walked to the kitchen as quietly as possible. Even though he was definitely the submissive one in all of this, he really loved Cas.. er... Daddy. He wanted a chance to watch him in his element. So, Dean leaned on the door jam, crossed his arms, and just watched. Cas had music playing softly and he flipped the burgers on the stove. He hummed along quietly as he got down two glasses from the cabinet next to the stove. He held one in his hand and Dean could tell he was contemplating if he should get Dean his Batman cup instead.
“D-daddy?!” Holy fuck, no. He could not be spanked… certain issues would come up that could not be avoided. And cute little ass? Yes, please. This is the kind of dirty talk he could get behind any day of the week.
"Yea, baby. Wanna feel your cock..." Dean rolled his hips against Cas's thighs and that was all the evidence that Cas needed.
Dean didn't respond immediately. When Cas looked over to see what he was doing, he saw the omega was smiling and looking down at his feet while he tried to hide his blush. "Our room, huh?"
As Castiel sat down, he could sense the kid staring at him. So, this was going to be a thing. Constant staring and confusion while Castiel wasn't looking and faking sleep or defiance when he was. Cas didn't look up as he flipped to his spot in his book, but he wasn't interested in reading. He was observing the omega. His movements, his breath, any possible sign of a scent. So far there was nothing but the occasional rustling of the omega trying to get more comfortable.
"That sound like a great idea, Mr. Novak. Maybe I could give you my cell number? Feel free to text me anytime. You too, Dean." Sam smiled at the omega.
"Awesome! So, I am going to throw the ball to you and you throw it back. If you want, one of us can ask a question and the other answer it. I would love to get to know you better."
“Silly boy, I had to get some lube. I felt you tense up. I need to prep you more. Now, you asked to have something in your mouth. Put it back in and I’ll start our timer.” Dean glanced over his shoulder to see Cas clicking on his phone and tossing the lube onto the bed. His brows were furrowed in concentration. In a few short moments, his full attention would be on his baby boy. Dean smiled as he put the boxers back in place.
Dean was still crying a little, but he gave a quick half-smile as he heard the compliment. "That's right. You're the best patient I've ever had. The best Dean I've ever met. The best superhero fan in the whole world. The best friend Bee will ever have."
Dean took out his paci and nuzzled Cas. He nodded his head. “Yea, it was real good… Read it again, Daddy? Please?
“If you don’t follow the rules, then you will be punished, little one. However, if you are my good boy all day, which I know you can be, then I’ll reward you. I’ll make you forget your own name because you will be flying so high, baby.”
"D... Dean, that's not appropriate." Cas clenched his eyes tightly and tried to tamp down the smell of confusion and arousal that was sure to be arriving at any moment.
By the time his notes were finished, it was around two in the afternoon. He had three more hours before they would kick him out. "I think I'm going to go grab a late lunch." He pulled out the visual menu. Lots of colorful pictures of the foods that were on D's approved list. Applesauce, Jello, the whole "liquid foods" deal for at least a week He hadn't really looked at it when Charlie gave it to him, but it was bright and cheerful. Something to put the younger kids at ease, probably. "Do you want anything on this list?" He held the menu up in front of him.
Castiel never let up his assault on Dean's hole, but brought one hand around to grab his omega's cock. It took one, two, three strokes, and Dean was coming all over the wall and shooting slick down Cas' throat. As he came down from his high, Cas licked over Dean's rim slowly and rubbed up and down his back.
"Your hand?" Dean's words were becoming a bit slurred. It seemed like he was becoming intoxicated on the scent of Castiel's arousal. The alpha hoped that he would do the same when he could smell Dean.
"Sadly, yes. Yes, I did. I hugged him. This random man. I hugged him. My arms went around his waist at the same time that he caught the door. Then, it turns out we were parked beside of them and we had to walk across the parking lot together."
"You say that all the time. I know I'm human, but what kind of big bro..." He froze. "Well, I ain't much of a big brother yet. Must've been a real good one if Sam forgot about me and I forgot about him." He let out a shaky breath. "I should be able to tough this out for Sam's sake."
Cas chuckled and sat up with his back against the headboard of the bed. "Well, talking about your nightmares could certainly help. That helps because it allows you to process what happened and start to gain an understanding of--"
Cas hung up the phone quickly and ran back into the bedroom. "Baby, we have to go, okay? We're going to stay at the ODT headquarters for a little while. Gabriel, the lead agent on your case, said that Alastair told him that Roche is one of his men. We have to get you safe."
“Love you, too, sweet boy. I’m going to get a rag to finish cleaning us up, and then I’ll be right back. We have quite a while before we have to get ready for today.” Dean yawned, nodded, and stretched his arms high above his head before curling down into the bed. Cas kissed his forehead and got up. Right before he got to the door, he turned back, handing Dean his blankie and pacifier. “My baby.”
"Fuck, Cas! I have to meet his parents!" Cas could hear the omega trying to take deep breaths. "I fuckin' forgot that I would meet his fuckin' parents! How stupid am I? Holy shit!" He sat up. "How the hell am I supposed to talk to these people? How the... oh, shit, Cas we can't go, baby. We can't." Dean was shaking his head quickly.
“I told you not to move, love. Lay down and take it. Be my good boy. This is your punishment. You don’t get to come from this. You knew that when we started this. You take what Daddy gives you. No more, no less.” That was true, but Dean had never anticipated that something could feel this good. Cas’ movements never stayed the same. A few quick thrusts, and few slow ones, a mix of the two… It was a never-ending tease that Dean was welcoming with open arms. He had opened himself up enough to the point that one finger wasn’t supposed to give him surprises. Sure, one of his fingers would fill him a little, but he wasn’t completely full. Regardless of that, Cas seemed to know how to twist his finger and the speed to use to make Dean fall apart. He could feel his precum leaking onto the bed and he knew that he would cum before the five minutes were up if something didn’t change… and fast.
Sam shook his head. "I don't think so, but you do look familiar. Did you go to high school at Sun Ridge?"
“You are mine.” Daddy’s lips trailed down Dean’s chest and sucked his right nipple into his mouth as his hand found his left. “Your nipples are mine. Mine to bite and suck and leave wanting more.” Dean was sure that he was going to cum from that stimulation alone. Cas could play him like a fined-tuned instrument. His mouth moved lower and his drug his teeth down Dean’s stomach. “Your tummy is mine to fill with yummy food and butterflies, but right here,” Daddy moved down a little more and bit right above Dean’s belly-button, “right here, Daddy fills you up with his cum.” Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. It was finally going to happen. Right? Fuck, it had to. Cas straddled Dean and pulled his cock slowly from its confines. Dean’s jaw dropped and he could feel drool on his lip moving to his chin. He knew Cas was big. He just didn’t expect his cock to be so… pretty. The thickness was proportional to the length and the thick vein underneath was slowly pulsing with want. Daddy was at least two inches bigger than him and any fake cock he had ever taken. Fuck.
After what seemed like an eternity, Gabe sighed. "I'm not saying this to judge you and persuade you otherwise, but how do you know if you can't smell him?"
Dean had changed into a pair of too-big sweat pants from Cas's bag and fallen into the uncomfortable bed that they were assigned. Castiel was certain that he would need to buy a new wardrobe by the time the omega had combed his way through and claimed his favorites. Cas was in his comfiest pair of jeans that had frayed long ago at the hem. Currently, both men were shirtless to give Dean as much skin-to-skin contact as they could in the privacy of a police precinct. They would've been willing to completely disrobe if not for the half-way torn curtains and the issue of public hygiene. The joys of a government building.
Dean moaned at the thought. What else did Daddy want to fill his mouth with? What if this turned sexual? Cas… well, “Daddy” was making Dean’s wet dreams come to life. Daddy… Cas… His Daddy? Yea. He could get on board with this.
Castiel laid down on their bed and turned down the comforter for Dean to join. Their bed. What a beautiful concept.
Dean blushed slightly and Cas chuckled. "Well, let's get in there and get started. You two can get the test done and I'll let reception know that we will get the car out of the parking lot as soon as we can."
"So, with all of that being said, all I really need is for you to be able to explain the state that Dean was in when you first met him. Since you began your relationship as his rehab specialist, you can speak on his behalf. This will help us establish the extent of the abuse Alastair encouraged and establish a pattern of torture with those he has kidnapped."
Castiel could see blood pooling beneath of Roche. Dean had bit and he bit hard. The alpha let out a groan and hauled himself to his feet. He stumbled his way inside.
"Well, when we're leaving, there was this elderly couple behind us. I held the door open for my date and for the couple." Cas cradled his head in his hands. "Ugh, do I have to tell you?"
The alpha was truly amazed at how Dean could be so calm, soft, and vulnerable with him when they were alone. So open to feelings and so very, very gentle. As soon as another person entered the room, though, Dean's defenses were immediately up again. The man sitting on the bed was not the same man that tried to give Cas a hickey the size of Texas. This man was... guarded, ready to pounce at the slightest sign of danger, and threatening. He may be an omega in hospital, but he had the face of an alpha in battle. Dean never spoke, but his eyes briefly shifted to Bee before landing back on the nurse.
As Cas looked over to the driver’s seat of the Impala, he couldn’t help but smile. The windows were up due to the crisp autumn air and slight mist, but somehow Dean’s hair was still windblown. How did he get this lucky? As he pondered on this, Dean reached his hand over the bench seat and grabbed Cas’ tightly.
Dean nodded his head fiercely and began hiccupping because his sobs were so strong. Castiel looked back to Charlie and motioned with his head for her to go. She nodded and mouthed "sorry," as she left.
"It's the same, Gabe. I know I can't smell him, but when I'm with him, I'm happy. Our therapy sessions don't even feel like therapy. It's just us getting to know one another and working together to make him stronger. I feel like I'm part of a team and I can't lose my teammate. So... I think I need to lose him as a patient."
"Hmm, good, baby boy." Dean's eyes widened as he looked at Cas. Was this asshole going to look his way? At the same moment, Dean realized that Cas was finished with his food. So, he grabbed the fork and began to get some chicken. That got him a light slap to his cock.
"Yea, maybe." Dean ran his hand down his face. "Anyways, I thought I was beta for a long time. Mom died when I was four. Dad died when I was six. So, I bounced around a lot, foster homes, group homes, you name it. When I turned sixteen, I ran away from my foster home. They treated me alright, I guess, but it wasn't home and it sure as hell wasn't where I wanted to be. They were fake. No real family."
"So, heading to my alpha's house, huh? Never thought I would say that." Dean smiled as he looked out of the window. "It's been forever since I've been in a car."
"Yes!" At the sound of his name, the beta perked up. Dean leaned forward to listen. Cas was simply amazed at how well the two got along. It was almost surreal. "It's for a random liberal studies class about genetics. We were talking about genetic probability and I wanted to do some digging into my family history. As I mentioned yesterday, I was adopted when I was three. I'm doing some research into my birth parents. I haven't found a lot."
"Great." Dean scooted over in his seat so he was as close to Castiel as he could manage. He laid his head on the alpha's shoulder. "You know, for someone so dominant in the hospital the other day, you sure do seem a bit shy, baby."
Ever since Dean was four years old, he has been petrified of thunderstorms. A bolt of lightning hit a transformer box and started the fire that took his mother away from him. A thunderstorm made him and Sammy orphans. It wasn’t just noise. It wasn’t just scary lights. It scared him to his core. He couldn’t let anyone see that—especially Sammy. Normally, he can cope with it. Thunderstorms usually pass after a few minutes. This one was freakishly long and catching him off guard. He felt raw… vulnerable…
With that, Dean spun them around so Cas was against the wall. He settled his knee between Cas's legs and kissed below his ear. Cas could feel the omega's confidence return.  "Nah, Alpha. You're the kind of guy that makes me so desperate for you than I get dizzy. You're the kind of guy that I wanna wake up with in the morning with you grinding against me before you even know you're awake. You're the kind of guy I wanna get on my hands and knees for and beg you to take care of me, baby." Castiel was breathing fast at Dean's words and he couldn't help the little squeak that came out of his throat. Dean let out a quiet laugh as he pulled Castiel's earlobe between his teeth. "You're the kind of guy that I want to mate me and fuck me and breed me and--"
Castiel blinked hard a few times. The room spun. He realized he was still on the floor of the garage, curled up beside of the driver's side tire. He was by the kitchen door and could almost see inside, but it felt like he was miles away. Everything was shifting. Blood was rushing through his ears and he left like he was going to vomit. The concrete was cold and he wanted nothing more than to get up and run and find Dean, but he couldn't. His hands and feet were tingling, so he knew that his feeling was slowly returning, but who knew how long he had already been out cold. Dean was probably far away.
"Mhmm. Daddy, I have a secret. Sometimes, I just like to play with myself before I put anything inside of my hole. It makes it feel a lot better when I get filled up. Sometimes I do that before I go outside and I get all excited during the day. It's a fun game. Do you want to play, too, Daddy?"
Dean's tears were starting to fall. Fuck Cas, you know what? Fuck him for ending this thing this way! Fuck him for being an absolute perfect gentleman and making sure Dean cleaned up the dried cum off of his stomach and brushed his teeth after their sloppy make out sessions and fuck him fo---
Cas shook his head. “I’m going to let you cum after you finish cleaning me up. You get to cum after I’ve given you some compliments myself. You did beautifully, baby. You took your punishment so well.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. "I definitely want you to join me. I just... I don't know what all I want to happen. Can we just play it by ear? Not put like... an expectation or something on it?"
"Cassie, you didn't even think that the kid would be conscious enough to communicate and instead he's given us a name. I think you need to give him more credit."
Castiel approached room 327 with caution. He took a deep breath and knocked lightly. He didn't hear anything, so he slowly opened the door. The omega appeared to be sleeping on his side facing the wall. Cas was sure that he was faking. So, instead of approaching the bed, he sat in the chair that was beside the window. He decided not to talk directly to the omega and to simply read in silence.
"It looks good on you." Dean just hummed in response. "I'm going to put on some comfy clothes. What would you like to wear when you get out?"
The four men sat in the booth and let silence surround them. The distant clanging of pots and pans, the overlapping conversations of other customers, and the quiet classic rock on the jukebox slowly faded into the distance. Castiel wasn't sure what to think about Dean's admission. It was quite the bold statement, but it would explain Sam and Dean's instant connection.
“Dean, this is no joke. How often do you suck your thumb? You could be developing, or have already developed, serious issues with your teeth. Perhaps even the roof of your mouth.”
"So, I could do that, or I could be shared among him and the other employees. I, uh... I think I was the first person to ever tell the bastard 'no.' He got this mean look in his eyes and got all alpha on me, even though he was a beta asshole that used fake pheromones to get laid. He asked me again which one I wanted to do and I told him I was out. I was done. I turned to walk away and he..." The tears began falling.
Dean thought about that one for a minute. Taking a nap sounded great. He slept the night before with Cas, but it was not a very restful sleep. He never woke up, but his head was filled with dreams. Dreams of this little thing going further and further until Cas had him full… in all the ways he wanted.
"Mhmm. Thank you, Daddy." Dean couldn't help reaching out for Cas's hand and bringing his thumb up to his mouth. "Please, Daddy?"
"Your panties are the only ones that I care anything about dropping." At that, Cas could feel a shiver run through Dean. "However, I can assure you that I have said more stupid things than I care to ever admit to my mate. Who will spend the rest of their life with me. With potential blackmail. For forever."
Dean's head lazily rolled up and his eyes widened slightly when he saw Cas unbuckling his belt and kicking off his pants and underwear. Cas stroked his cock a few times before pouring the cool strawberry pie filling over his cock. Dean just gave an almost inhuman noise in recognition. Once his cock was covered, Cas stepped up and positioned himself so all Dean had to do was bend down and take it.
"Yea, sweet boy. I think it will be a very good day. Now, why don't we go watch an episode or two of some TV before it's time to go?"
“Do you need anything before I go?” Castiel was excellent at reading his best friend, but this was like unchartered water and he really didn’t want to swim in it longer than necessary.
Cas left the room which left Dean to his predicament. He could feel the slickness of Cas’ cum in his hole. He could taste it. He could feel it cooling on his back. He felt good, but he needed to cum so badly he could hardly stand it. In the back of his mind, he knew that Cas would eventually let him and that Daddy knew what was best for his baby boy, but he began to feel a little panicked. What if Daddy ruined his orgasm? What if he wouldn’t help Dean cum? What if he cleaned him up and sent him on his way? What if, what if, what if?
Dean smirked and sat down. He looked up at Cas and batted his eyelashes. “What do you need me to do now, Daddy?” Oh, no, a punishment of sucking dick. How horrible. Nooo. Psshh. Please.
While Roche had his head thrown back in anticipation, Dean's green eyes darted to the open kitchen door and caught Castiel's blue ones. His eyes widened for a millisecond and then he winked. Quick. His eyes were back on Roche so fast that Cas thought he may have been hallucinating. "Come on, doctor. Don't leave an eager patient waiting. You know what I need."
Cas chuckled and kissed Dean's nose. "If we hadn't had such a hectic day, then yes. Of course. Today was a bit stressful, though, and it's not over yet. I think that it would be better to wait. Unless you are absolutely sure, that is." Cas knew that Dean wasn't ready, but he didn't mind throwing out the idea of mating his omega that very moment.
Dean smiled in response around the finger in his mouth. He nodded his head slowly and moved his hips so Cas’ cock was caught between his thighs. He had Daddy right where he wanted him. Finally, Daddy was going to fuck him and fill him and wreck him and all of those things he wanted.
"Well, I will go there tomorrow and see what I can do to help. Just know that having an omega-care certification doesn't make me a miracle worker. I won't give up on him, but please do not expect him to be ready for a trial or anything like that any time soon. Or ever, for that matter."
"You as well. May I ask why we needed to meet so quickly? I assume that it is case related." Castiel looked at Gabriel with great concern. It was strange for his fun-loving, light-hearted friend to do anything with a sense of urgency. He was quite concerned about what this conversation would entail.
"Are you fucking serious?" This was the first thing Dean had said to a staff member. He stood and pulled Sam up from his seat. He hugged him tightly and Sam returned the gesture. "Nice to have you back, Sammy."
"H-how did you--- How could you possibly---" Sam tried and failed to start many different sentences.
Dean gave a weak nod and continued sucking on his finger. Cas kept eye contact as he attached his lips to Dean's hole. He pushed up so he was sitting on his knees and Dean's hips were up in the air. The omega wasted no time and wrapped his calves around Cas's head, bringing him even closer. "Alpha..."
The two continued on to the pillows and Cas had to laugh quietly as Dean zoomed down the aisle, checking each and every one that caught his eye. Most were too scratchy. Some too soft. Some too firm. A select few, though, found their way into the cart. There was no discernable color scheme or theme, but Cas couldn't care less. Certainly not as Dean threw the pillows that met his criterion over his shoulder to Cas to put in the cart so enthusiastically.
"Yea, I think it does. You are quite the intelligent omega, my sweet boy." Cas kissed the top of Dean's head and pulled him into his chest.
The nurse looked up and then immediately back to the computer. She was typing so quickly that Cas was sure that there couldn't be actual words showing up on the screen. "327? 22-25 year old male omega? John Doe?"
He still had a while before Bobby would be okay with him going back out on the floor. So, he laid on his back and put his head back on the couch's arm rest. Not a whole lot more comfortable, but he decided it was better than sitting up. He needed to calm the fuck down. He had been horny during shifts before. Hell, that's what got him through some of them... thinking about going home, stripping down, falling in bed, and doing whatever he wanted to himself. Why was this time any different?
Their apartment was relatively close to a shopping center, so Castiel decided it best to clear his head at a bookstore. That always seemed to do the trick. However, after spending nearly thirty minutes in the Barnes and Noble with absolutely no luck, he decided to peruse the rest of the mall. Nothing remotely piqued his interest until he stumbled across a baby supply store, for a lack of a better term. In the window was a matching set of baby clothes, shoes, etc. What really caught Cas’ eye was the little pear-colored pacifier sitting on a small table beside the ensemble.
"Whatever." Dean snuggled into his spot. "So... is talking about this shit really the only way that the nightmares may slack off?"
Charlie chuckled and took the card. "That's what us nurses have started calling you. You're that kid's angel." Castiel shook his head in slight embarrassment. "Anyways, go do your thing and I'll take care of Dean."
Cas pinched Dean’s arm. “Hey, you better show Daddy some respect.” Dean looked up, but the look on Cas’ face was soft. His smile was warm and Dean couldn’t help but mirror it.
After far too long, Cas was straddling Dean’s thighs and placed the phone where Dean could check the time whenever he wanted. “Are you ready to begin, love?”
"Hey, no, none of that. They've been arrested. None of them know you're even alive. No one is going to come for us. Trust me. Those assholes are going away for a long time."
Cas must have heard Dean’s quiet moans. “Close your mouth and suck, baby. Can’t be a proper punishment without you being a little hard and needy for me, can it?”
Dean held onto Cas' hand as tears threatened to form as they walked from one end of the apartment to the other. Towards Dean's room. Towards the end of it all.
Dean felt like he could cum in his underwear like a teenager if Cas kept fucking teasing him like this. “I want your sarcasm and teasing and obnoxiousness.”
“But you don’t suck your thumb like you’re a fucking baby!” Dean got up and stormed to his room. Why did Cas have to be so damn understanding? Trying to connect with him and shit. It pissed Dean off to know that Cas thought this was okay. Normal, even! A grown-ass man sucking his thumb. He was completely prepared for rejection. Not this understanding, emotional shit.
Before Castiel could say anything else, D pointed to the screen with a couple of hard jabs of his finger. So, Castiel decided to shut up and watch. Maybe there was a news report about Alastair or another omega from the same location that D was found.
Castiel shuffled them around  so Dean was laying on his stomach between Cas's legs with his head on his shoulder. Cas pulled the blanket over them successfully, albeit a bit awkwardly. He wrapped them up tight. He knew he would burn up during the night, but hearing Dean's sigh of contentment made him not care quite as much. The omega found his favorite spot on Cas's neck and began making small circles on it with his tongue.
“Dean, they left half an hour ago. You were in the bathroom for forty-five minutes. Are you sick?” His roommate of three years and best friend of five held onto his wrist and stared at him with those damn soul-piercing eyes. You would think a psychology major would know that that stare made people uncomfortable in times like these.
“So, that’s where rules two and three come in. Rule two, you have to accept compliments today. If anyone thanks you or compliments you, say you’re welcome or thank you in return. No deflecting. Rule three, you cannot talk badly about yourself or put yourself down in any way.”
Sure enough, when Castiel opened the closet door, Dean was sitting on the floor with his knees to his chest. The omega was squished between some boxes and the wall. It was not a big closet by any means. He was wearing his boxers and Cas's hoodie, which seemed to be his preferred outfit. Bee was tucked under his chin and his head was turned away from Castiel. Regardless, Cas could tell that Dean was crying.
“You little slut of mine. Daddy will give you what you need. You need to remember what you are, don’t you?” Between his words, Cas bit and licked Dean’s ear and neck.
Right when he was about to have an inkling of understanding as to what they were talking about, the doctor walked through the door. "Alright, so, Mr. Wesson and Mr. Winchester," he paused to pull up a report on the small computer in the room, "here are your DNA reports."
He crossed over the floor slowly, trying to stay quiet and let Dean settle into the moment. He sat down on the edge of the bed and chuckled as Dean opened one eye to peek at him. "Dean..."
"I don't know. It's up to you. This is your home now, so you can decide on decorations, soap and stuff, board games... Whatever you think you would want."
Despite the intimate and comforting manner in which they fell asleep, neither Dean nor Cas slept well. They had stayed in that position for about half an hour before the realities of life reminded them of where they were. The fluorescent lights from the hallway kept shining in every time that the heat kicked on and rustled the cheap blinds over the window. The night-shift agents were meandering the halls and making quiet, constant noise. An occasional laugh or shout made it's way through the closed door to the couple's quarters. Then, of course, there was the underlying anxiety and concern about the prior day's events that kept either man from completely relaxing.
Cas smiled softly and pulled Dean in close. Soon, the omega's breathing was deep and even. Castiel stared at the ceiling while he thought about everything that had happened over the past few days. He just couldn't figure out how Dean was improving so quickly. He was of course excited that it was happening,  but who was this man that could so easily defy Death itself?
Dean turned his attention back to the book and squeezed Cas’ waist. “Thanks, Daddy. You’re my favorite.”
“Well, you’re going to need to shower later, and I know how you like to spend that time. You have quite the loud mouth on you, baby.”
Dean smiled shyly and found something interesting on the floor to stare at instead of Cas's face. "When you came that first day. I remember staring at you because I didn't understand you. You were nice and you weren't asking me to do anything. You didn't run any tests. You confused me. Then you left and when you opened the door, the air rushed in, and... it was like a damn ton of bricks fell on me. I knew that it was just... right? I guess that's the word. I had never smelled anything like you before."
Castiel cleared his throat and dabbed his eyes. He wasn't the one who had experienced any of this and yet, here he was, falling apart, while the man who did suffer was chilling out in the next room. "As far as his mental state and communication, he was extremely aggressive and he could not verbally communicate at all. He could growl, snarl, and scream. He was, however, able to communicate his needs through gestures. He performed quite well in speech therapy. He was able to ask and answer questions, identify his emotions, and even joke around."
"In the nightmare, I saw my imaginary friend. I totally forgot that I had one when I was a kid, but around the time my mom died, I started to have an imaginary friend named Sammy. So, I think just hearing the same name or something must've like... I don't know..." Dean trailed off. Cas was sure that he was doubting himself again.
The two finished their meal and started to walk hand-in-hand to their room. Dean gave Ellen a small wave and a quite "thank you, ma'am," as they left. As they rounded the corner to the ODT offices, they ran directly into Gabe.
“Fuck! Yes! Now how the hell am I supposed to go to sleep like this?” Dean gestured to his groin and looked at Cas with a you-better-fucking-take-care-of-that look on his face.
"I'm aware." It was obvious to Dean that Cas was not going to help him at all. So, he lifted himself one more time before lowering himself all the way onto the silicone cock beneath him.
When they arrived at the doctor's office, Dean was rocking back and forth on his feet. He refused to let them go into the office without Sam, because "he's just a kid and might not know where to go." Cas wanted to point out that Sam had probably been in a doctor's office before, but that didn't seem incredibly productive, so he kept that to himself.
"I know, but I need to." For a few minutes, Dean laid on his side with Bee in one hand and Castiel's hand in the other. Eventually, he took in a shaky breath and continued. "He, uh, he grabbed my arm and told me that leaving wasn't one of the options that I had. That I had to choose." Dean's grip was so tight that Cas thought his fingers may break. But that was okay. They would heal. Dean needed his support.
Castiel could see the signs of fatigue on his face, but Dean would never let Roche know how much this had taken out of him. He would never stop fighting. He would never let the bastard have the satisfaction. Castiel wouldn't be surprised if he went silent for a few days after this. All Roche would see was a warrior of an omega.
“Forty-five minutes? Shit…” Dean wiped his hand over his face. “No… No, I’m not sick.” He refused to meet Castiel’s eyes. Cas didn’t need to know about this shit. His fear of thunderstorms… his “habit,” nothing…
"Of course, Dean." Cas could tell something was bothering his mate. He turned to Bobby for a moment. "Thank you again, Bobby. You really didn't have to do that."
"You didn't get 'kind of crazy.' Not at all. You discovered some potentially lifechanging news. I think you're entitled to bit of uncharacteristic behavior."
D just huffed. "I am worried about you." With that, D reluctantly looked over at Cas with his one good eye. "They say..." Cas took a deep breath. "Again I'm just being honest... they say that there is a good chance that you will not live through the week without a change in your care plan." The omega broke eye contact to burrow into the hospital bed with his stuffed animal.
The smile remained on Bobby's face as he passed some papers to Cas. "Just wait till that bite is on your neck." A brief look of sadness passed over the older alpha's face and he sighed. "So, let's talk about Alastair, shall we?"
The alpha let Dean start the water and he picked up their clothes. When he threw them into the hamper, he smiled. Flannel, henleys, and button-downs look nice mixed together.
Castiel dropped his bag on the floor. In the same instant, his hand lifted Dean’s chin and looked into his eyes. “Baby boy, you are so good.”
Cas nuzzled his neck and kissed his throat gently. “I know you can, love. Now, we have a little while before Charlie said she needed us, so, why don’t we take a short nap before getting ready.”
Castiel thought that he was a fantastically professional and kind doctor. He was so thankful that Dean did not have to deal with any additional sarcasm, arrogance, or general asshole-ish behavior like he did at the hospital.
Dean nodded and looked down, almost like he was preparing himself for rejection. "Yes, I like you very much, Dean."
"Do you want me to sit beside of you?" D gave a weak nod and turned his back to Castiel. He clung to his bee tighter and shut his eyes. "Of course, D. Thank you."
"Wonderful, Charlie, that's just... It's wonderful." Castiel looked over to Dean. "I'm proud of you for trying this D, and I am so happy that it is working." He leaned in closer and put his hand over his mouth so Charlie couldn't see what he said. "Would you like to tell her what we just discovered?"
"And I won't let him forget it. Anyways, our love has always been an easy one. Jobs came easily. College came easily. Money came easily. Children, though... that blessing is one that we could not have on our own. We tried for years. Nothing. We even applied for IVF, but our alpha/beta status kept us from qualifying. So, naturally, we looked into adoption."
"Then it's a good thing you're here, hm?" With that, the doctor turned away and left Castiel in the hallway.
As much as he hated to do it, Cas pushed Dean back. He looked down at the young man and caught himself groaning. His hair was messy, eyes still tired, and his mouth slightly open. He was beautiful. "Dean, I could lose my job if someone ever saw us doing... that."
Sam was typing away on his phone. "Actually, I was thinking that to save time and get some lunch, I could get my dad to pick me up on his way home from work. He doesn't work far. It'll be like ten minutes until he gets here. Even though I paid for it, the car is technically in his name and I don't want to leave in the middle of the parking lot."
"Well, this... kid. I swear he's probably only 22 or 23. Anyways, this omega will probably need upwards of two years."
"You know, since that awful date story, your corniness has become so much more obvious. You gotta tamp that down, man." Dean gave a half smile as he opened the door and stretched. A small bit of skin showed and Cas smiled. What a resilient man he found.
At this point, Dean had leaned in closer. He was fully invested in the story. "I'm sorry that you went through that."
"What, Dr. Roche? Impersonal? Unemotional? I'm sorry, sir, but that is not what this patient needs. He needs to make new connections and this is working. He has made remarkable and unprecedented growth in the few days that he has been here. It is my professional opinion that this is due to touch therapy."
Before he knew it, Cas was finished with the book. Dean didn’t even know what the book was about. “So, baby boy, did you like that one?”
Suzanne hugged Dean tightly. "Of course. Of course. You are part of this family, Dean Winchester." She cradled the back of his head as he hugged her back. "You always will be."
"Well, I got my omega certification," there was that face again, "because there aren't a lot of people in this field. It's a lot more complex than people realize and there's a lot more to take into consideration than with the other designations. I wanted to help people in a field where there wasn't a lot of help. As for your case, I figured I needed a feisty man with an affinity for explicit language in my life." Cas smiled and threw the ball back.
Sam spoke up next. "It doesn't sound too crazy to believe. How did your parents pass, Dean? If you don't mind me asking."
With a quick wave to Gabriel, Cas pulled into the cramped one-car garage. There was room for the car, his two totes of Christmas decorations, push mower, and that was about it. He squeezed himself out of the driver's seat and motioned for Gabe to follow him in through the garage.
"Yes, really. We can stay home." He was struggling to focus on the road, but thankfully, the medical complex wasn't too far away from their house.
Castiel shook his head and covered his mouth with his hand. "I--" he stopped and started talking several times. "Can he choose?"
"Not that I can tell. Temporary bruising in his throat, but it should go away with time. We see that often with victims of sexual abuse. I'm sure you're aware of that. Good day." The doctor turned to walked away.
Castiel turned around with the sandwich plates in hand and smiled as he watched his omega walking around with nothing but his boxers and a hoodie on. The omega's quiet yawns and the way he rubbed sleepily at his eyes made Cas shiver with contentment. He loved Dean more than he thought he could love someone else. The fact that Dean was able to calm him down so quickly and knew the exact reason for his anger allowed the rock of anxiety in his gut to slowly crumble away. All that was left was the foundation of love and adoration that he had for his omega.
He began by making up his bed. The fitted sheet had come off of one of the corners. Instead of walking around like a normal person, Dean decided to try and fix it from the other side. He had to move back and forth a few times to get it done.
"Alone, indeed. So, we're sitting there at the booth and things are going as well as awkward first dates can go. Then Kali shows up and drops a condom on the table and tells us that Gabe sends his regards."
"Cas, I'm fucked up more than you realize. I told you what happened in that basement, but it's so much more than that. I did shit before I went into that basement. Agreed to shit in that basement. I... you don't need this bullshit, man!" Dean ripped his hands away from Cas's and turned around. He leaned his head back so he was looking at the ceiling. "Motherfucker!" Cas watched as Dean's hands ran through his hair and settled into fists by his sides.
"Then I get to do what I just did in there over and over. I don't mind that at all." Castiel grinned as he felt Dean shiver against him.
Cas hummed quietly. “Sucking your thumb, hm? I can see how that would be considered therapeutic. Children must enjoy it for a reason.” Dean just stared at him. Are you kidding? Could this guy be any more attractive? He was okay with this. He didn’t push Dean away. “However,” Cas continued and Dean looked up shyly from his spot on the couch. Here it comes. Some remark about how he needs to grow up. This friendship was going to end soooner rather than later. “Sucking your thumb repeatedly for this many years does not go without consequence to your oral health.”
Cas hadn't even realized that his scent had changed from content to mildly distressed. "I'm sorry, D. I was just thinking."
Dean did not ask about whether or not he should do anything for Cas in return and it made the alpha smile. His omega was learning what sex could really be about; how it was an exchange of love and affection, rather than solely being a way to satisfy biological requirements or the sick result of an unchecked alpha-complex.
“Then I am going to fill you up, baby. The way I know you want to be filled more than anything. I’m going to put a finger in you, baby. Fill you up nice. Maybe more than one if you can take it. I’m going to finger my baby for five minutes. One minute for each thing you did not do for Daddy. You cannot come. You cannot rut against the mattress. Five minutes of your tight little hole taking what Daddy gives it. Can you handle it?”
When he was done, the two men left in 327 began laughing. The laughter brought tears to Castiel's eyes, but so did the happiness he felt when he heard Dean's voice. It was surreal and he wasn't sure he had fully processed what had just happened. Dean was silent again. He was still laughing, but he was looking at Castiel with a satisfied look on his face.
Castiel held Dean's hand tightly in his as they walked the brick steps. It was a short walk, but it felt like a mile. The front door was real wood, of course. Cas didn't know anything about woodworking or carpentry, but he thought it looked heavy and handcrafted. The small window towards the top of the door gave a peek into the picturesque home. A crystal chandelier glinted against cozy recessed lighting.
With that, Cas walked back to the kitchen, leaving Dean hard and frustrated in the hallway. “You dick!”
"D... We... we can't." Castiel knew he didn't have the strength to push Dean away this time. The first time this happened a few days ago had been the only other time that Dean tried to do this. For that, Cas was grateful. He knew his resolve to tell Dean no- to any request- was crumbling.
"Whenever you're ready." This question and response had become a daily, if not more often, occurrence. Regardless, it gave Cas butterflies like a teenager.
D quickly nodded twice and shook their hands roughly side to side. He looked up at Cas with nothing but happiness shining in his eyes. Castiel didn't know how long this moment would last, but he couldn't take his eyes off of D to check the time. It was a perfect experience. Two perfect strangers making the discovery of a lifetime.
“I… I slept too long… I couldn’t have finished the list even if I wasn’t scared.” Dean hid his face in Cas’ chest and wanted to cry when he felt Cas tense beneath him.
Castiel sat on the back of the ambulance with Dean tucked under his arm. The omega laid his head over Cas's shoulder and wrapped the rescue blanket around them tightly. Roche was pushed past them on a stretcher. "Territorial, huh, alpha?" Dean was trying to sound upbeat, but Cas knew that he was hurt. He was hurt by Cas leaving, hurt by what he had just done to Roche, and hurt that his life outside of the basement wasn't getting easier.
"Yes, I'm hoping that he is a bit more alert today. I don't know what all you saw in that building, but he needs ample time to feel comfortable with any kind of human interaction. I may even need to just do once every other hour."
Admittedly, Dean was one of the most resilient patients he had ever worked with and certainly had a fighting spirit, but he was still human. Castiel considered himself extremely optimistic when thinking of Dean's rate of recovery. However, Dean needed to acclimate himself to using his voice again. He needed to practice using his fine motor skills. (If Castiel was honest with himself, they would probably be doing some gross-motor therapy as well.) Dean needed a lot of care. He needed his scent back. Most importantly, he still needed time to process what had happened to him over the past few years.
“It’s all okay, sweet boy. Everyone gets frustrated, we just have to calm back down. You are such a good boy for Daddy.”
The talk show host began talking. "And we're back. After watching a good superhero movie, I always think it's a good thing to back to the origin of the heroes. As I mentioned before the break, we're going to be looking at some of DC Superman's early years. You just saw him fighting the big bads in the
“Good boy. Now, go take a shower. I want you to get nice and clean for me. Then, come back to the living room with no clothes. You can get your pacifier and blanket if you think you will need them. When you get in here, you will sit on the floor by my feet. Do you understand your instructions, sweet boy?” Cas continued to stroke Dean’s hair as he explained his expectations. He definitely noticed the shudder that went through Dean as he spoke.
"Easy there, Alpha. Don't want you to kill him. I think he knows that I belong to you, now." Dean walked over and gave Roche another kick in the crotch to send his point home. At this point with the blood loss and the bashes to the head, the doctor was nearly unconscious. There was no point in continuing. This was Dean simply enjoying an unorthodox therapy session. Dean knelt down beside Roche's face. "You know, Doc, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but I would think less about getting my dick wet during a damn kidnapping." Dean stood up and cracked his neck.  "Oh, and just in case no one has ever told you, that little thing you call a dick is just pathetic." Dean smiled before spitting in his face. "I'm going to go get the door, babe. His ride's here."
“That’s right. I’ll always make it okay.” With that, he put his thumb back and kissed the top of Dean’s head.
Before Castiel knew what was happening, Dean was leaned over his waist, staring intently at what was before him. The omega took Castiel's wrist in his hand and moved it away. Then, he put his own hand back and began feeling Cas all over. Castiel couldn't say that it was necessarily pleasurable to be tugged this way and that, but to see his omega exploring his body was orgasmic in and of itself. Castiel let out a moan as Dean paid extra attention to the tip. "Sp.. spit on it, baby boy."
Gabriel stuck his fork into the lemon meringue pie that sat in front of him. He picked at it several times before eventually pushing the styrofoam container further back on his desk. He had a piece of pie at least twice a week -every week- from A Little Slice of Heaven since he joined the Omega Defense Team ten years ago. This was the first time that he could not stomach the thought of eating.
Dean's tears threatened to fall. "How did you not know that we were brothers?" His walls kept him skeptical.
"For real. I love working with kids. They make some interesting observations. Anyways," He paused and began running his fingers through Dean's hair. "There was this little girl. Sharp as a tack and as sly as a fox. She was a sweetheart when she wanted to be, but she had a mean streak. A real mean streak and she knew how to hide it from her teachers and parents. She was always the victim." Cas paused and looked down at his omega, who seemed to be fully invested in the story. "Well, one day, a girl pushed her back on the playground and she fell. They were at the top of the slide. She broke her arm and had a terrible blow to her forehead."
"As much as I would love to just talk with you after seeing you cum in front of me in there and put me in my fucking place, I think I need you a little closer to my cock than that. I need
He shook his head in hopes that it would somehow make the shroud of confusion disappear. Unsurprisingly, it did not. He did, however, chuckle as he saw Gabriel pacing back and forth beside his car in Castiel's driveway. It was an old Crown Vic with chipping mint green paint. It was tacky, horrible on gas mileage, and was prepared to break down at any given moment. Gabe loved the damn thing, though. Castiel was quite happy to drive his 2007 Camry. It was modest, decent on gas, in good shape, and completely paid off. "Paid off" was a beautiful phrase for government employees to hear. He supposed that's why Gabe kept his monstrosity.
"I said, take it, boy." Cas still wasn't looking at him, but his voice had changed into a growl and Dean knew he needed to sit all the way down, and quick. After a few minutes of pleasure clouded with embarrassment and arousal, Dean was down to the final inch.
Cas knelt down and kissed Dean's cock. He chuckled as Dean bucked up on sensation alone. He grasped Dean in his hand and kissed him slowly. "I love you, baby boy. You did so well for me. Now, I need your to come. Come for Daddy."
After spending some much needed time enjoying their skin-to-skin therapy, Dean and Cas agreed that it was time to get something to eat. They had spent the majority of the day lounging in bed or dozing on the couch. Eventually, Dean's stomach reminded the two that they required more than soft touches to stay alive. Truly unfortunate.
Roche's eyes bulged out his head as he turned to leave. His lab coat was comical as it wrapped around him like in a cartoon. "See you tomorrow, Novak."
Cas turned around, prepared to accept defeat in all its misery. He gasped when he saw that Dean had snuck up behind him. “Dean! You startled me.”
Dean and Cas' alarms both sounded off at 6:30 on Monday morning. They both startled and messed with their phones before falling back down onto the bed.  "I guess we just need one alarm now, huh?" Dean laughed as Cas' breathing tried to return to normal.
"Yea, I am. Your point? I needed that lazy afternoon. Now it's back to business, Mr. Grouchy. So, have you heard from him?" Dean was up on his hands and knees with his backside wiggling back and forth. He looked like a hyper puppy that had been told that they were about to go for a walk.
D was staring at the TV with tears in his eyes. He looked quickly at Castiel and then back to the screen. "Hey, hey, what's up, D?" Castiel sat down beside him and D grabbed his hand without looking. "Did something sad happen on TV?"
"Yes, Daddy." Dean groaned as the first few inches pushed their way into his hole. It felt familiar and comfortable, but so new at the same time. He lifted up and sat back a bit. The best he could figure, he was about halfway down and his cock was about halfway up. It made sense.
With a huff, Dean began cleaning his room quickly and efficiently. Hopefully, Daddy put something pleasurable next on the list.
Dean had been quite talkative at the beginning of the day, but with the excitement of coming home, meeting Sam, and their alone time, Castiel was sure that the omega had said all that he wanted to say. Dean's words had softened over the past few hours and he was gesturing more than he had been that morning. After all of his years as an omega rehab specialist, Cas knew that Dean would eventually become overstimulated and need a "recharge" period, so to speak. However, it did make him a bit sad to see Dean needing that time even after they had had a good, albeit busy, day. He was hoping that Dean would acclimate to his life even quicker than he had before now that he was living with Castiel. Cas sighed. True Mates or not, Dean was an omega who had experienced a great trauma. He would need time and Castiel was happy to provide it for him.
Castiel knew his body wash was doing nothing to hide the rage he felt towards this man. "He could have what, doctor?" He spat out the last word. "Cuddled it to death? Please. You said it yourself that it's a good thing I'm here. You have so many other patients. This-" he pointed at the omega, "man is my one and only priority. I am here for him and him alone. He wants this stuffed animal to deal with the trauma? He gets the stuffed animal. He wants to finish a puzzle? He finishes the damn puzzle. You know how sensitive his case is so I suggest that you stay in your lane, Dr. Roche, and let me do my damn job."
Dean paused and looked at his friend. He couldn’t lie to him. “It started when I was little… Um… sucking my thumb helps. There, I said it.”
Cas pulled him closer. "Let Daddy watch. Let Daddy see you touching your little hole, baby. Let Daddy see it take this all in. Let Daddy, fuck... Let me watch you, baby." At this point, both men were panting hard and their hard cocks were occasionally brushing against one another.
The omega must have heard Castiel's compliment because his cheeks were flaming red when Cas walked back into the room. Cas decided to change the subject before taking his place back in his chair. "Hey, D. Do you want me to find us something on TV now or would you like to rest?"
"Yea, my job is to help you get better. I could lose that job if we were... physical in any way with one another."
The omega whipped his head towards Castiel and shook it back and forth quickly. He looked panicked, as if the information he found would slip away at any moment. His eyes darted around the room. He gave a frustrated snarl and then his eyes landed on Castiel's ODT badge. He pointed to it again and huffed. "The D in my badge--- oh, D! Did they say your name?" Castiel got excited and smiled as D nodded his head quickly.
Cas rolled his eyes and began playing with Dean’s hair. “You know I love you, sweet boy. I would never let anyone talk badly about you, would I?”
Dean's eyes were filled with unshed tears and unspoken words. "Just leave, man. Forget about this fucking... whatever I just did."
"Well, we never got to test out those other therapy aids. I was wondering if you would like to toss this back and forth." Cas held up a foam ball. It was about 6 inches in diameter and should be large enough for Dean to easily catch.
Cas put down the butter knife and wrapped his hands around Dean's wrists. He laid his head back on Dean's shoulder. "I know you're safe now, Dean. I just feel very... angry when I think about everything that you have had to experience."
Castiel chuckled. Apparently D and the nursing staff had a tense relationship. "Thank you. He's quite the strong patient."
When Dean exited the bathroom, he grabbed a pacifier from his room and walked into the living room. Cas’ back was turned to him, as he was sitting on the couch watching some documentary. Dean walked around the couch and was about to sit down where he had been instructed, but what he saw made him freeze. Cas was sitting with his legs spread slightly with his manhood standing at attention. What the fuck. This was not a punishment at all. Seeing Daddy’s cock? Fuck yea.
"MacLeod? I have his approval right here." Castiel shoved the case file at the doctor. "I may be an external rehab specialist, but I can assure you that I am working within my jurisdiction. Now, please let me calm my patient before I request a new doctor for his delicate case."
"I see that you're feeling energized this morning." Cas knew his voice sounded rough, but damn, he had just opened his eyes.
As Cas walked away, he could hear Dean groan loudly. He could hear him pant and try his best not to come from the cock that was buried in his perfect little hole. He could hear him almost cry from the need to come. "D-daddy... please... 'm your good boy. Please..."
Dean shook himself out of Cas's hold. "Yea, you do, and I love you so much. You'll never know. Never gonna know how much I love you." Dean paused. "Isn't it fucked up though? We met because of some asshole that decided I wasn't worth anything and I'm living with you because I don't have shit to my name and I'm a fucking drop out. Ya know-" Cas wanted to interrupt, but he wanted a black eye even less. Plus, Dean needed to grieve what had happened to him. He needed to process this. "Ya know, I wanted to be a firefighter. Find a husband or a wife, have a couple of pups, white picket fence. Maybe even a fucking dog runnin' around in the backyard. But some damn fire had to come along and fuck it all up."
"I'm sorry, Daddy," Dean smiled and pushed his hips up to meet Cas' thighs. "Daddy... you make me feel all warm inside and you make me feel like my special spot is all empty... I just want it to get filled up. I'm sorry that I was bad."
"Yea, babe. I can take care of you. Always." Huh, Dean had never thought about being the one to take care of Cas. He was the bigger of the two... so he supposed it made sense. He wouldn't always be the submissive one in the bedroom, it would seem. That's okay with him... he guessed. He could get used to it. He would do anything for Cas, after all.
Cas must have felt the change in Dean and also noticed the uptake in his breathing and heart rate. "Dean, if it's too much, we can wait until tomorrow. You did just finish a punishment, after all."
"Hey, there, Alpha." Dean wiped the blood off of his mouth with the back of his hand. Dean took one last shot at Roche's balls before moving back against the wall. "He's all yours, baby."
Bobby did not leave his position against the wall. "Other than his academics and his work ethic, I don't know a lot. He's a quiet kid and he's always got his nose stuck in a book. Keeps to himself. He's extremely intelligent and always puts his best foot forward. Sam is our top intern."
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel's waist from behind as the alpha perused the multitude of games. Many alphas hated having their mates stand taller than them, but Cas was enamored with the difference. "I want you and me to take a bath. One with that really fancy bubble bath stuff that's under the sink."
