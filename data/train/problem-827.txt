John Watson knew a lot about his abilities being called freakish, so when he met Sherlock, who was equally as strange, he really couldn’t blame himself for slipping into feelings of love. However, he didn’t know shit about how Sherlock felt.
Crowley strutted out of the bookshop, with his dark hair styled into a mullet, and wearing fashionable, well fitting clothes.
(A/N: I’m totally projecting my own back problems on Crowley rn. If my back hurts and I Walk Like That, so does he. Also since my run is so weird ‘cause of it so is his.)
He was waiting in a little coffee shop, waiting for John to come back from trying to find witnesses. Boring.
Aziraphale’s words snapped him out of the haze he was in before, which was quite strange and unlike him. He never felt that emotionally vulnerable to someone he just met, not even John, who he practically fell in love with when he complimented his deductions on the spot.
With a sly smirk, the person shifted into a leaning position against the wall. “You are aware that your friend iz right behind you, right? Or are you that ruzty?”
John quickly opened a mental link to Sherlock, trying to make it sound like Sherlock’s thoughts warning him away from danger.
Sherlock stared at John's hand clasped within his own, a blush spreading across his face. With a small smile, he squeezed John's hand. “I suppose it is.”
Pursing his lips, Aziraphale shrugged. “Whatever you say my dear. So shall we get on with the interview?”
“I’m sure he’d be willing. He knew the girl that was killed himself, he was practically like a father to her, however much he’d try to deny it.” Aziraphale said with a sad smile. “He’s really hoping you guys can get the culprit, since he heard your in town.”
Also note that while the fire/holy water thingy didn’t happen in my weird mash of book/show canon, heaven and hell have show canon, for the most part, and their salty as fuck about Armageddon.
John yawned, and stomped on the ground, molten red cracks appeared, and Beelzebub was swallowed into the ground, and when John turned around, not even a scratch upon the ground was left. Seeing Sherlock, he sighed.
Sherlock sighed heavily, sinking into a chair with a flop. “Absolutely nothing. The killer refuses to show up.” It was clear he was grumpy, even to the most unobservant of people.
The omega reached out tentative hands and latched onto the soft fabric. He buried his nose into it, sniffing John’s scent, then wrapped the blanket around himself. “Thank you, Jawn.” His eyes were wide with joy, as if he could  hardly believe it. “I-It is soft…. And a pretty colour. Like the sky… or the ocean.” The omega lifted his eyes quickly, meeting John’s gaze, as if fearful he will be hit for talking so much. But when nothing happened-except John smiled rather goofily-he returned the smile. “It smells like you, Jawn…. Like gunpowder… strength… courage… honey…. Milky tea. Smells good.”
Sherlock broke into heartbroken sobs, his thin shoulders jerking with each sob. “How can you like me, Jawn? How can you care for me? I am not worthy of being cared for…”
The omega looked up shly. “Can I sleep with you? In your bed? I mean… not for sex or anything… just because…. Because…”
John seemed to realize that he was this close to kissing the young omega and he quickly let go and scooted back, feeling his face grow warm. . “I-I’m sorry… That was…. Out of line…”
Once they were a good distance away from Trevor, John stopped and turned to Sherlock. “I’m so sorry about that…. Trevor shouldn’t have said things like that. I’m sorry if you were uncomfortable.”
John leaned over the boy, pinning the slender arms down and pressing his lips to Sherlock’s exposed neck. He curled up his lips and slowly sank his teeth into the soft flesh.
“Yes, yes love, it’s me,” John said, brushing a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead. “Are you… are you feeling alright?”
“Yes ma’am,” John replied with a smile. “Oh… thank you for picking up the groceries. I meant to do the shopping today but with the omega and everything…”
“No, love, it’s your choice. I want you to be comfortable. It’s your bed after all.” John went over to the corner of the sitting room, where he kept an old trunk full of blankets, pillowcases, and whatnot. Pulling out an aquamarine colored blanket, he held it out towards the omega. “This one almost matches your beautiful eyes, love, and it’s soft too.”
John ran his hands through the sweaty raven-colored curls, humming quietly. “Oh love….” He couldn’t think of any words that would bring comfort to the trembling omega. Instead, he just sat there, rocking back and forth, letting the omega cry. Occasionally, he kissed the damp brow.  “Shhh, love… it’s alright.”
“It should be illegal for people to do this,” John said through gritted teeth as he wiped dried blood away from the cut.
Beneath John’s touch, the omega shuddered and looked away, crystal tears sliding down his cheeks. “They all said that… they all acted like you… then they…” He choked and pulled his head from John’s grasp. “They… lied. They all lied. I don’t know what to believe anymore…”
“Stop. I don’t want this!” Sherlock retorted, twisting around in the alpha’s grip and baring his teeth. He bite down hard and his teeth sunk into soft flesh that tasted like rotten fish and smoke. The taste made him gag and feel like he had to vomit but he remained latched on, despite the alpha’s best efforts to get him off.
Sherlock whimpered softly and his eyes slowly fluttered open. Piteous eyes met John’s. “J-Jawn? Is… is that you?” he murmured, some color spotting his pale cheeks.
Ace Watson balanced precariously on the edge of the roof of the royal palace, gazing over the small kingdom. He drew in a deep breath, enjoying the crisp, cool air and the breeze toying with his blond locks.  “Wow, I could get used to a view like this!” he exclaimed. He placed a hand over his eyes to shield them from the sun and drank in the sight of the glorious kingdom. Although the kingdom wasn’t the largest, it was a place of happiness, where everyone had enough to eat and where everyone had a warm bed to sleep in at night. Unfortunately, everyone except Ace Watson, who happened to be on very bad terms with the king’s guardsmen.
Taking a couple deep breaths, John calmed down a little bit. Beads of sweat shone on his forehead as he climbed out of bed, standing up on shaky legs. God, why did this always have to happen to him? He wished he would forget it all… forget all the blood, the deserted cities, and the sights and sounds of the dying. But he can’t. Every day, the dreams got worse and the guilt felt increasingly heavy. “You’ve got to stay strong, for Sherlock,” he reminded himself, brushing away the sweat with the back of his hand. “I… um...thought we might go shopping today, love, for some clothes for you. You can’t wear my things forever. They don’t fit you right.”
“Wait?” The boy sounded confused. “You mean you don’t want my hair?”  He regarded Ace with suspicious blue eyes.
“John?” Mrs. Hudson entered the flat, carrying a pan covered by a towel. She smiled and began to tip-toe when she saw the sleeping form on the couch. “Oh good. The poor dear is finally sleeping. He needs his rest. Now John, I’m not going to do this for you all the time but I made a casserole for you and your omega to share.” She set the dish on the table. “It’s still hot, so be careful.”
Over the weeks, Sherlock and John had been drawn closer to each other. John had taken the omega out on several outings, which Sherlock had enjoyed immensely and they spent most of their evenings curled up on the couch together, in each other’s arms. John realized that his limp was gone and his shoulder, although it ached occasionally, didn’t bother him as much as it used to. The nightmares had surprisingly stopped and he attributed it to Sherlock, who spent the night hours curled at his side, his arms around John’s waist. Sherlock himself had started losing the haunted look in his eyes and looked much better, his body filling out and looking more pleasing every day.
Jim Moriaty was angered that his precious life source had been taken away and he was determined to get it back. The magic had flowed into baby Sherlock and his raven curls carried the special gift of healing and youthfulness. Moriaty snuck into the baby prince’s nursery, armed with a pair of scissors. He took hold of one of Sherlock’s curls and began to sing the spell softly.
“Well, it’s easy for you to say,” Ace said, squinting down at the paper and frowning. “You guys look amazing.”
“Then I don’t know why it takes so long,” Moriaty said. “Oh, darling, I’m just teasing!” He broke into high-pitched laughter that made Sherlock squirm.
It’s selfish really. To think of yourself as alone. You remember what it was like to be truly lonely and you think of Lestrade and Molly and Mrs Hudson and about what a disservice it is to them to consider yourself alone.
John knows that tone, cautious and unsure, and his heart feels full from it. Nightmares don’t happen often these days, but that doesn’t mean they don’t happen at all. John smiles, warm and fond in the face of Sherlock's concern, and pushes himself off the fridge towards him.
John affectionately raked his hands through the omega’s curls. “Crying is not bad, love. It’s a natural outlet that humans use to release emotion. You should not have been punished for that.” Inside, he was seething. Who in their right mind would be so cruel as to beat a boy for crying? John longed to find his omega’s torturer and throttle him but he knew that was not possible. Suddenly, overwhelmed with emotion, he wrapped his strong arms around the omega and pulled him close.
Sherlock then realized that the cramps in his stomach had numbed to a dull ache and, although he felt hot, it wasn’t as intense as before. Relieved, he looked back up at John. “I feel better.”
“That was…. Wow… um. Amazing. Like, I don’t know how to describe it. Love, you are brilliant!” John exclaimed with a smile.
The omega settled on his hip, John moved about the flat, gathering up the supplies he needed to freshen up the boy. He found a jumper and a pair of boxers that should fit the boy in the bottom of his drawers and retrieved his first aid kit from beneath the sink. He walked back into the living room and gently settled the boy on the couch. “Here, can I remove your shirt?” he asked.
“Love, you don’t have to be afraid. If you don’t like it, it’s alright. You might need something softer for your stomach, after all.”
Sherlock reached out and touched the fabric. It was soft against his rough, scarred fingers; much better than the itchy cotton and wool clothing he was used to wearing. “I like it?” he asked hesitantly then ducked, awaiting a blow. Why was John asking him his opinion? He was  used to making decisions. His old masters always did it for him. A punishment was dealt if he dared speak his mind.
Sherlock moaned as a sharp pain shot through his abdomen. “Jawn?” he whispered through trembling lips.
“That’s good,” John replied, ruffling the unruly curls. He wanted to stay like this, with his omega touching him, trusting him, but then he noticed the scars on his omega’s arms, legs, and neck and realized that he needed to tend to the wounds immediately. “Love, let’s get you cleaned up, alright? I don’t want your cuts and scars to get infected. Also, I’ve got some clothes -probably too big but they will do until we can go shopping. They are much better than the clothes you are wearing now. ” He gently latched his hands around the boy’s wrists and ran his fingers over the scarred knuckles. “Why would they hurt you like this,” he whispered, not intending for the omega to hear.
There was some shuffling around and then the door slowly creaked open. Sherlock stood there, covered completely in black. The omega’s pale skin was smeared with what appeared to be black soot and his clothes weren’t faring much better.. They were singed. Whenever he moved, his dark curls shook and a black powder fell to the ground. Mrs. Hudson covered her mouth with both her hands to prevent the scream from escaping her lips.
John held back his laughter. “Sherlock, it’s alright. Relax. I’ll clean up and you eat.” He fetched  a wet rag and set to work scrubbing off the wall while Sherlock watched with wide, solemn eyes, most likely wondering why John didn’t make him clean it up himself.
“She wasn’t in my life much,” John replied, relieved that the boy had dropped the subject of punishment. “Ran away when I was eight, leaving my sister Harry and I behind with Dad. I guess I really don’t… I guess I don’t think about my parents much. (which, by the way, John knew was a total lie and he hoped that Sherlock would not deduce that.) They didn’t care about me. They didn’t even love me. Or, at least I don’t think so. They didn’t show love towards us kids at all. I think it was mostly my dad’s fault that our family fell apart. He was an alpha and loved dominating my omega mother, who hated it. She always was very spirited. But… enough about my family.” John wrapped an arm around Sherlock and pulled him close. “Are you feeling up to telling me a little about your family?”
“Oh love, what is it? Darling, why are you crying?” John worried, taking his thumbs and wiping away the crystal drops.
I'd like to take all of Sherlock's fucking owners and kill them with an axe... (I'm not really violent in real life lol) Poor babe...
“Excuse me,” said a beta woman dressed in scrubs and wearing a doctor’s badge. “Mr. Watson. We need to take your omega to the x-ray room. It’s just to check for any internal bleeding, broken bones, etcetera. I’m afraid you can’t accompany us but you may wait out in the lobby and someone will call on you when he is finished.”
“No problem,” John replied, putting an arm around Sarah’s shoulders. “Hey… let’s see what we’ve got. We might have some leftovers… Oh, would takeout be okay?”
“Stop!” John shouted before he even realized what he was doing, and he stepped in between the omega and the beta. The beta paused, whip held high, and the omega fearfully looked up. It was then that John saw the boy’s face. God… he was beautiful. Perhaps the most beautiful creature John had ever seen. The boy had high, aristocratic cheekbones that looked so sharp you could cut yourself on them and a plush, red, cupid’s bow mouth. His eyes were perhaps the most startling of all; they were a brilliant combination of green, silver, and blue combined and were framed by long, dark lashes. Seeing John staring at him, the omega looked down quickly and curled in on himself, obviously awaiting a blow.
Sherlock looked around him. He was lying in some sort of a nest, made with old pillows and duvets that John had bunched together. The whole thing smelled of the strong, blond alpha and Sherlock buried himself in it, inhaling deeply and feeling his body slowly relax. Now that he was in a clearer mind he realized that he had shouted at John-something no slave should ever do to his master or his betters. No matter how terrified he had felt, he should have never yelled.
Sherlock laid motionless on the bed, whimpering weakly in pain. He was naked, his skin smeared with saliva, semen, blood, and tears. Every inch of his body burned terribly, like he was on fire. Moran had fucked him until his anus had torn and the blood had run freely onto the sheets. He supposed he ought to be grateful; his arse felt numb and he couldn’t really feel the pain.
Instantly, Sherlock leapt  from the couch and scuttled to the corner of the room, whimpering softly. “Please…. Don’t…. Don’t do it, please don’t,” he cried, yanking on his dark curls in distress.
“I bet you were a real cutie when you were a pup,” Mrs. Hudson continued gently. “I always wanted pups of my own but as you know… I’m a beta and I was never able to have one. However, I do consider John my pup.” She winked cheekily at John and the omega let out a little huff that sounded vaguely like a laugh. “He’s a good one too.”
The omega turned his head, looking up at John. His eyes read “I want to believe you… I want to believe you so badly”  The beautiful eyes welled with tears and the cheeks flushed pink. He wrapped  his thin, pale hands around John’s strong, larger ones and brought them up to his chest.
John smiled tenderly, running his fingers through Sherlock’s silky curls. “Does it make you feel good?”
John clasped Sherlock’s hand in his own and brushed Sherlock’s knuckles with his lips. “No… no.” Tears were now streaming in rivers down John’s tanned cheeks. “It’s not your fault… please, Sherlock. Don’t blame yourself.” He forced a smile and rubbed his cheek against Sherlock’s hand. “I… I don’t know what I would have done if you… if you…” He looked away, coughing awkwardly.
Sherlock nodded, curls bobbing, and lowered his head so that John could unbuckle the old, auction house collar. As soon as the old, dried leather fell from his neck and was replaced with the new, soft, and beautiful collar, Sherlock looks like a changed man. He looked at John, eyes sparkling with joy, and offered John a real, genuine smile. John was momentarily dazzled; Sherlock had a beautiful smile. His eyes wrinkle at the corners. His beautiful plush lips parted to reveal straight, white teeth. And the way the omega was looking at him-with such adoration and gratitude-was adoring. John couldn’t help but pull the boy into a hug. Sherlock leaned into his owner’s touch and whispered, “Thank you, Jawn. Thank you so much.”
A frantic voice broke through into Sherlock’s mind palace, where he had hidden himself away in the deepest room possible. The voice sounded far away, like it was coming from several stories up. The voice sounded terrified… desperate. Sherlock’s head was pounding. The pain was driving him crazy. Strange lights flashed in front of his eyes. He smelled something sickening. Someone was poking him. He felt a needle in his arm that stung every time he moved.
That sets them off again; laughing and laughing until their eyes are wet and they are both panting for breath.
John continues to watch Sherlock, his expression still so soft, and fond and Sherlock has to look away from the brightness of it. He rubs nervously at the back of his neck, he feels awfully exposed and starts to wonder if he can just yell
After a good giggle and some more shuffling John rests his palm on Sherlock’s back and starts slowly running it up and down Sherlock’s bare skin as the detective begins to explain the results of his experiment.
You don’t miss the brief flicker of panic across his features before his expression slips back into a mask of neutrality.
John is just on the precipice of sleep when he feels the bed dip beside him. He smiles into his pillow before turning to face Sherlock, who has taken up his usual position on his stomach; hands tucked under his pillow and face tipped towards John.
You can’t remember the last time he seemed truly happy. Mary’s death did a good job of focusing John’s guilt into a shroud of misery that he seems reluctant to shed. Selfishly you long to be the source of that happiness again. You remember breathless laughter in the entryway of 221B, adrenaline laced confrontations, interrupted dates, arguing over the contents of the refrigerator, giggling at crime scenes, and you long to give that to him again. It's a foolish and seemingly impossible hope. But you hope all the same.
John feigns annoyance briefly before rolling his eyes and getting up to add another log to the fire, thankfully bringing an end to the whole hateful conversation.
“Yes John; men. Only men. Whilst I can appreciate the appeal of womankind, the appreciation is entirely aesthetic, in the way one might admire a piece of art. There is no doubt that the Venus de Milo is beautiful, but I don’t want it in my living room.”
Eventually people start making their excuses to leave, Mrs Hudson fusses with the dishes a bit before, finally, it’s just the two of you left. The silence stretches a little as he sits across from you in his chair and sips his scotch slowly. The embers from the dying fire seem to dance in his eyes and seeing him sitting there, with his recently cut hair and wearing a cable knit jumper, you allow yourself to be content with the teasing echoes of nostalgia for just a moment.
Sherlock, stunned, blinks several times. He stares at John for an inappropriate amount of time before attempting to manipulate his mouth into making some kind of response. All that escapes is a rather humiliating and strangled sound from the back of his throat.
Sherlock watches the perfect curve of his arse as he bends over to reach for the poker and blushes at the thought of John turning around and catching him mid-ogle. Sherlock groans internally at his own humiliating reaction to the simple image of his friend crouching down to poke at the coals and makes a mental note to never consume alcohol again.
“Yes I want to, I desire to…I mean. I have wanted to. I did. Once. Well, a few times it happened but…” Sherlock trails off, a sick hollow feeling filling his gut. They are definitely on dangerous ground now and Sherlock can’t see any possible way back to safer territory.
The omega tilted his head like a curious puppy, leaning into Mrs Hudson’s touch, eyes closed with ecstasy.
John strode over and took a seat next to Sherlock. He turned on the telly. There was  a documentary playing about African wildlife and Sherlock seemed interested so John kept the channel on. He laid his head against the back of the couch and closed his eyes, exhaustion finally sinking in. As he breathed deeply, he was  suddenly aware of a sickeningly sweet smell. It was faint but enough to make John open his eyes. He knew that smell.
Hours later,  darkness fell on London and John glanced at the clock. He was shocked to realize it’s nearly eight and he hadn’t eaten anything since that morning. “Oh, Sherlock, love, are you hungry for supper?” he asked and then, when there was no reply, he realized the omega had fallen asleep on his lap, hands still fisted in John’s sweater. Smiling to himself, John gently lifted the omega and carried him to the couch, where he settled the lanky form on the cushions and covered Sherlock with a blanket. The boy barely stirred, only sighing and pulling the blanket tighter around himself. John kissed the pale forehead and headed to the kitchen. He was  starving, he realized, and the omega probably was too. Biscuits don’t really fill you up. “I guess I’ll just order in,” he muttered to himself, grabbing the phone book.
“Y-yes m-master,” Sherlock stuttered in reply, forcing himself to kiss Moran back, just like the man wanted him to.
“Isn’t that what you bought me for, Jawn?” the omega said quietly, head bowed. “I’m supposed to… to pleasure you in the bedroom…..” The omega trails off, eyes wide and frantic. “I can… suck you off… I’m not a virgin but they said I make a nice… nice fuck…”
“Oh, shh, shh,” John said gently. “It’s alright. You don’t have to walk if you can’t. Here, let me pick you up.” The omega stared up at him with shock and shrank from the outstretched arms, eyes wide with suspicion. “It’s alright. I won’t hurt you. You can trust me, alright?” He lifted the boy with ease and settled him on his hip. The small omega immediately buried his nose in John’s shoulder, clinging with both fists to John’s sweater. “That’s a good boy,” John said, surprised that the omega is not trying to squirm out of his grasp. He gently stroked the tousled curls.
“I-I slept without permission, Jawn,” Sherlock sobbed, burying his head in John’s shirt and inhaling lungfuls of the alpha’s scent. He could sense no anger in John so perhaps he had nothing to be afraid of. John was calm, stroking his hair, and Sherlock slowly relaxed. Suddenly, he felt very stupid when John said:
“Someone get a muzzle and cuffs on the bitch if he resists,” a gravelly voice says and suddenly, three men are standing above the small family, glaring down at them with eyes full of greed.
Sherlock, who was toying with the bumblebee’s wings, smiled and shrugged “I didn’t really notice. I’m used to going without food for a long time.”
“Don’t be, love. Talk about your pups all you want. I know that it’s hard to go through that kind of loss.” John cradled the young omega in his arms, wiping away the boy’s tears with his thumb. “I wish I could have been there… to protect you and your pups.”
Sherlock shifted underneath the sheets and shook his head. “I feel… funny. My leg is numb. What did they do to it?” His forehead wrinkled in confusion when he saw the IV line sticking out of his hand. He raised his hand in the air, which seemed to take a lot of effort, and stared at the needle. “What’s this?”
Sherlock looked into the eyes of the man he thought he had trusted and then broke free from John’s grip. Without looking back, he ran out of the flat as fast as his legs could carry him, his heart pounding ferociously against his ribcage.
“I’m thinking you need a name…. Have you got one?” John said, desperate to break the awkward silence.
Sherlock squeaked loudly, then looked embarrassed. John merely laughed  and slowly slid in a third finger. Sherlock’s hole clenched and unclenched around his fingers and more slick seeped out onto John’s hands and the blankets. “Does that feel good, love?” John asked, carefully gauging the omega’s reaction.
“No need, love. Now, second things second. Bed.. A bed for you.” John bit his lip. The omega was probably used to sleeping in his owner’s bedroom but John wasn’t sure he wanted that for the boy just yet. After all, if you slept in the owner’s bedroom, it most likely meant you would end up in the owner’s bed, getting a hole full of cock. He didn’t want to scare the boy. That could be a major setback regarding the omega’s trust issues. “Would you like to sleep on the couch? It’s pretty comfy. Tried it myself a couple times.”
The Kingdom searched and searched, but they could not find the little Prince. The king and queen cried together, fearing that the worst had happened to their beloved son. After weeks and weeks of searching, the hunt was called off. The little prince was gone without a trace. Filled with grief, the queen locked herself away from the rest of the world and the king put his anger and sorrow into building the kingdom into a stronger, richer country.
The two companions traveled across the meadow, through the cave tunnel, and onto a rough road overgrown with grass. Ace was relieved when Sherlock seemed to shake off his trepidation and started enjoying himself. Every so often, they would have to stop so Sherlock could examine an interesting flower or plant or just gaze at some birds sitting in a tree.
John came out of his startled reverie and blanched upon seeing his prone omega. “Shh, love, it’s alright,” he comforted,leaning down and putting an arm around Sherlock. Sherlock shivered in his touch, tears falling down his beautiful, flushed cheeks, and John’s heart ached. Gently, he petted the tousled curls and, after some hesitation, pressed soft, light kisses to the bared neck, hoping that it  would somehow reassure the boy. “You haven’t upset me, Sherlock. I shouldn’t have snapped like that… I was just… surprised.”
At the touch, the omega stirred, whimpering softly, then let out a soft sigh of content, the worry lines on his brow fading and the cupid’s bow lips softening to a tiny smile.
Ace couldn’t hold back his smile. He knelt down on the grass beside Sherlock. “Amazing, isn’t it?” There was something about Sherlock and how he was so excited that made Ace appreciate even the simplicity of grass and the smell of dirt.
When I was 16, Jim took my virginity and began to treat me more like a sex slave instead of a lab rat. He never b-bonded me, because he had his own mate, Sebastian Wilkes. Wilkes was just as cruel as his mate, even though he was an omega like I am. Sometimes, he and Jim would take me in both my holes and fuck me until I bled in both areas and passed out. I didn’t even have a blanket… They’d put me naked in a collar and chain and would lock me in a cage that barely fit me….”
Jim kept the flower hidden underneath a camouflaged basket and whenever he was feeling ill, he would go and sing to the flower and get rejuvenated by the flower’s healing powers. When he heard that the king and all the kingdom was searching for the magical flower, Jim fled to the hills with a shovel. He could not let them get their hands on the very flower that was his life source. He would dig it up if he had to.
Weeping quietly, Sherlock bent his head, arse in the air,and licked up the urine, nearly gagging at the taste. He licked and he licked until there was nothing left, then Jim stepped forward and lifted him up by his curls. “Open your mouth, bitch,” Jim ordered and Sherlock obeyed. Jim tapped his cigarette, allowing small black ashes to fall onto Sherlock’s tongue. “Close it and swallow.” Sherlock shut his mouth and swallowed, nearly choking on the gritty, smokey bits.
(10!) John couldn’t help the growl that escaped his lips and Sherlock let out a whimper, nearly dropping the biscuit he was holding. Soothingly, John ran his hand through the curls. “I’m not mad at you, love. I just… you had 10 pup terminations? Ten? Why?” He could only imagine the pain and heartbreak the young omega had been, fucked mercilessly,probably since he was old enough to walk, and then, when he was of age to have pups, was impregnated, only to have his pups torn away from him before they had a chance at life. John’s head started to ache ferociously. How could this be the world he lives in? Every part of him screamed out for justice for Sherlock and every one that was in his same situation.
John growled with arousal, all sense slipping away at the sight of his beautiful Sherlock. “A-Are you sure, Sherlock, love?” I want you to want this… I want you to do this not because you feel an obligation but because you really do want this.”
Ace gazed into the face of the most beautiful human being he had ever laid eyes on. A boy… It was a boy. He could tell by the deep voice that so unsuited the youthful appearance of the creature. The boy had long, black curls that trailed down his back and across the floor and -oh- that’s what Ace was tied up with. He looked into the boy’s eyes, fascinated by their unique coloring: blue one moment, green the next, and sometimes silver, depending on the way the light hit them. Plush, rose red lips shaped like Cupid’s bow were parted slightly in an endearing fashion that made Ace’s heart pound. The boy had high, sharp cheekbones and despite his gaunt appearance, looked striking in the purple tunic and black leggings he wore.
“Darling, you’ve got to lie still, alright?” John said, gently easing Sherlock back on onto the pillows. He almost laughed when Sherlock did the most adorable pout and bored John with pleading puppy dog eyes. “I know you want to go home, love, but you have to stay here until the doctors say you can be released. Don’t worry. Mrs. Hudson called to say she would drop by this afternoon with some biscuits and your stuffed bee.”
The other shoppers in the stores-mostly alphas-were leading their omegas on leashes, the slaves obediently crawling on the ground. Sherlock looked at the others and edged closer to John. Every muscle in his body was screaming at him to get into a submissive posture. He was so used to crawling on his hands and knees. It was uncomfortable and foreign to be walking upright and next to his master. He almost wished John would put him on a leash; at least, he wouldn’t have felt so odd.
A part of Sherlock wished that the alpha would kill him then and there. He wanted to end all this pain and misery. Another part of him wanted to live, because of John, even if John never wanted him back, Sherlock wanted to live for John-the only man who had ever shown kindness to him. Sherlock hung limply in the alpha’s grip, not even fighting. Black spots were forming in his vision and he could feel his lungs strain with each strangled breath he drew. “Jawn…” he whispered weakly. A vision of the golden-haired doctor flashed before his eyes and he felt fresh tears spill down his cheeks.
“I look at you, Jawn, and I see you want me… for who I am. You want me because I’m… I’m Sherlock. I’m not a slave, in your eyes. I’m…. a… a friend?” He said this last part like a question and anxiously searched John’s face.
John looked at the females, seeing the hopeless looks in their eyes and wishing he could take every one of them away from this awful place. “Um… I-I have no preference,” John replied, struggling to tear his eyes from the pleading gazes of the miserable wretches. “I just… am looking. I don’t think I’ll buy today… I just wanted to look around.”
“Jawn,” Sherlock whispered, trying to smile but finding that his face was numb and he couldn’t move it very well. “Jawn… you...came?”
“No, you’re not, Sherlock,” John said firmly. “You’re not a bitch. You’re Sherlock. The smart, amazing, beautiful, brave boy who I was so lucky to find.” He bopped Sherlock on the nose and the omega ducked with an embarrassed giggle. “Now, love, are you hungry? Mrs. Hudson’s brought dinner.”
“Um… that’s the funny thing about birthdays,” he ventured hesitantly, twiddling his thumbs nervously. “They’re kind of an annual thing…” He took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. “Father, I’m turning eighteen. I wanted to ask, what I really want for this birthday… actually what I want for every birthday…”
Every evening, whilst by the fire, Jim would comb Sherlock’s long, untamed curls and have the boy sing to him. The tower room would be filled with the sweet, childish voice of the little lost prince, who knew not where he came from.
Mrs. Hudson didn’t appear to be home-probably off running errands. “Let’s go up to the flat,” John said. The boy clung desperately to him, grabbing fistfuls of his sweater, his eyes wide as he took in his new surroundings. The flat was small; barely big enough for one person, but it had a homey feel to it. The kitchen was neat and everything was clean, despite all the furniture and what nots outdated. It smelled faintly like cigarette smoke from a previous boarder and, above all, like Earl Grey Tea. John carefully set him down on the living room divan and put the bin and folder on the coffee table.
John glanced down at the omega, who was curled at his feet, naked back covered with faint scars. “No… Not really. I’m sure he will be just fine for my needs. Now, do I need to fill out any paperwork?”
“Alright then.” John sat down and settled the boy on his lap. Mrs. Hudson put two plates in front of them. John forked a small bit of the steaming food and blew on it before offering it to Sherlock. “It’s really good, love. It has meat, which you most definitely need,” he coaxed when the omega pressed his lips together.
“No Jawn… I need you!” Sherlock whispered, eyes wide and pleading.. “Please… Please… Please… I don’t care… I just need you…. I need you to make me yours.…. I want you to… to….breed me.” Sherlock latched his long arms around John’s waist and pulled him closer. “Please, Jawn.” Tears started rolling down his cheeks and his shoulders hitched as his body was wracked with sobs. “I need you to fill me… I need you. I am thinking straight… You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted! I love you… I love you so much!”
“No, it’s not. You’re a human being not some… some fuck-toy.” John gripped the cart until his knuckles turned white. He caught a glimpse of Sherlock’s face and saw the boy flinch. “Oh, no, I’m not mad at you, love. I’m mad at… I guess, I’m mad at the world and all the people out there who’ve treated you so badly. I wish…. I wish I could have stopped them.” John reached out and tenderly cupped Sherlock’s face in the palm of his hand. He was pleasantly surprised when the omega leaned into his touch instead of pulling away. “I’m never going to let anyone hurt you again, Sherlock. I’m never going to let people treat you less than what you are-a human being with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. You’re safe now, Sherlock.”
Mrs. Hudson held a finger to his lips. “Shhh. It’s no bother. You were busy. However, if I’d known you had gotten an omega, I would have purchased other items… The poor dear is so thin… I think I have some clothes that will fit him until you can get him some new ones. Do you need another room, John? I can open up 221A. It’s got a cozy little bedroom.”
“I’m sorry!” the omega cried, cringing as if expecting a blow. “P-Please don’t punish me… I’ll stop talking!”
As another cramp racked his body with intense pain, Sherlock grasped desperately onto John’s hand. “Jawn… please… please… I need you!” he cried before he could pause to think about his words. His biology was screaming for the alpha to mount him, claim him, and breed him. “Please… Jawn! I want you…. I need you!” he babbled nonsensically, barely able to see straight. Then, he contradicted himself: “No… don’t hurt me! Don’t! I don’t want you… I don’t want you to hurt me!”
“Um… yeah… no can do. Unfortunately, the kingdom and I are not exactly simpatico at the moment. So I won’t be taking you anywhere,” Ace replied with a huff.
John laughed, scooping the boy up. “I’m glad. But you haven’t heard my snores yet.” Gently, he laid the boy down and pulled the comforter over him, tucking it neatly under the omega’s chin. Sherlock wriggled underneath the warm sheets, his beautiful eyes shining with excitement and, for the first time since John’s seen him, without fear. The sight of his precious omega made John want to lean down and kiss the boy on those plush lips, but he refrained himself, knowing that it was Sherlock who must want that..  “My beautiful omega,” John whispered, running his hand through Sherlock’s dark curls. “Have sweet dreams.”
Sherlock was afraid. More afraid than he had ever been in his life. His heart pounded fiercely against his ribcage. His mouth was dry. He could not breath. He could not even cry out.
For a moment, Sherlock stared back at him, then slowly, wrapped his pinky finger around John’s. “Pinky promise?”
“Hey… hey… Stop blaming yourself. I’m not going to punish you. I’m not angry that you kissed me. I don’t mind at all. I just…. I wanted to wait until you were…. Until, things settled down-” He broke off, flushing painfully at his attempt to talk. “I just wanted to wait until you were ready, Sherlock. I wasn’t going to force anything on you. I don’t want you to…. To kiss me  just because… because you feel as if you must pay me back for what I’ve done for you. I want you to do it because you want to. Because you want me.” He avoided Sherlock’s gaze, feeling incredibly stupid. Customers around them were staring at them, some with confusion, others with disgust. What did Sherlock think  of him? Did Sherlock think he was a sex-hungry pheodphile who just wanted to use him for his own sexual gratification or would the boy sense his genuine concern and….. and attraction.
A little while later, after being thoroughly spoilt for attention all night, Rosie begins to fuss. It’s past her usual bed time and you panic briefly at John’s comment about needing to leave soon before you remember you prepared for this eventuality. You sweep in and scoop her up, offer to put her down for the night, you bought a cot for upstairs after all.
You find yourself anxious at the thought of John’s approaching birthday; occasions have a way of making people melancholy with longing for people who aren’t there to attend them. You hate parties and you loathe the thought of entertaining a host of people but you swallow the unpleasantness and organise a small gathering at 221B.
John considers feigning annoyance for a second but he is too drunk on contentment to bother, so he giggles instead and is soon joined by Sherlock.
In reality it’s the slapping of your own heart beat you can hear violently clanging in your ears as you lay on the mildewy floor, vision slowly blacking in from the edges. The whoosh you hear is somehow related to the burning in your side but your thundering brain can’t make the connection.
You hear John potter around, checking your vitals, fiddling with the monitors. Murmuring softly to his daughter while he prods gently at your drip line.
When you come to 48 hours later it’s to the blinding white of a hospital room and his unimpressed expression.
Not that night. Not the aquarium. But your brain still panics that the tableau will stir images in his head and threaten to tear this all apart again.
John wakes the next morning to humid breath on his neck and soft curls tickling his nose. He allows himself to bask in the heaviness of Sherlock’s frame draped across him; a firm thigh pressed against the semi-hardness in his pyjama bottoms and a hand curled around his shoulder.
“Look I’m just saying; yeah I’m an idiot but you have to admit that you two had…chemistry. And she was certainly laying it on thick.”
Your eyes are playing tricks on you and your brain catches up to that fact soon enough. Just the flashing blue lights of the response car, and the shot you heard was just Sergeant Donovan’s car door slamming.
He’s smiling at you and this time its genuine, you smile back even though it pulls on your stiches and for a second, despite your current predicament, you are content.
You see Molly across the kitchen, she is giving you a look that’s far too knowing for your liking. You roll your eyes and hope that does enough to prevent her from coming over and speaking to you with a voice full of pity. You remember a time when you pitied her, found her admiration of you pathetic and worthy of scorn.
Quality of the kiss? Intentions behind it? The skill of the other participant? Whether or not there was,” Sherlock twirls his hand searching for the right word, “
The next time you come round its dark and you’re alone. The tube has been removed but the same feeling of panic from before threatens to engulf you again.
You solve it without even leaving the crime scene and still, even though you know it’s not coming, you look to him expectantly.
“And if you recall also; I distinctly remember telling you that girlfriends were not really my area. So who is the idiot here?”
It’s not like before. The wind whipping your hair, bitterly cold against adrenaline flushed cheeks. High on your own brilliance and the sound of his footfalls on the pavement beside you.
One time at a crime scene the victim lies on the ground, her golden curls a shock of brilliant colour against the muted grey of the asphalt and fear grips your heart so tightly you wonder for a second if you’re having a heart attack. You pull yourself together, but it’s too late because he has already seen and everything stops for a moment and you swear you can almost see the unnatural blue lighting of the aquarium rippling across his cold expression as though it was that night all over again.
“Tell me I haven’t completely bollocksed this up here Sherlock. I know I’m an idiot, but tell me I haven’t come to the wrong conclusion here?”
It’s John, face panicked as he barrels into the room, a crying toddler in one arm and a feeding bottle in the other and you both just stare at each other before you can’t help yourself- you’re suddenly laughing. Laughing and laughing, while he stands there dumbfounded, eyes narrowing suspiciously and lips hesitantly quirking, milk dribbling from the bottle he has forgotten he’s holding, Rosie crying and squirming.
He is stopped by a hand on his wrist and Sherlock calling his name and ends up being pulled down into a searingly hot kiss that lasts long enough for John’s knees to start cramping from the odd angle he is twisted at. John has kissed his fair share of people in the past but nobody has managed to make his hair stand on end and his heart thump the way that this wonderful man does. Eventually Sherlock pulls back, free palm cupping John’s face, and plants one more soft kiss on John’s top lip before releasing his now sweaty wrist.
Sherlock shrugs self-consciously as John uncrosses and crosses his legs again. John nods again before taking a breath to continue-
“Has there ever been…anyone else?” John takes a deep breath before clarifying; “anyone else you’ve ever…loved. Like that I mean? Been in love with?”
“Because you’ve been my best mate for seven years, give or take a couple of missing ones, and we’ve never once talked about this. Because I’m curious and drunk enough to keep asking you things I’ve never had the balls to ask you before. Perhaps,” John shrugs, “you’re drunk enough to answer?”
Time to deflect again, they are getting into dangerous territory now and Sherlock foolishly has just finished the last of his scotch and thus no longer has something to occupy his hands or stall his responses.
The staff are getting sick of you and the nurse, no doubt aware of the fact that John is a doctor, suggests that your surgeon might think about signing you out early if there is someone who can keep an eye on you at home.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but quickly realises John isn’t going to let this one slide and any further evasion is only going to mean an awkward end to the night. Sherlock takes a deep breath and braces for the ensuing conversation, John needn’t think he’s going to make it easy though.
Sherlock nervously speaks through the thick feeling in his throat; “John, you’ve already said that. Perhaps it’s best if that is the last glass”.
Sherlock can’t bear to draw this out any longer and suddenly he is leaning in, lips planting awkwardly on John’s. It’s hardly even a kiss really- their noses bump and John, stunned by Sherlock’s boldness, is temporarily frozen as Sherlock presses his overly stiff lips to John’s partly open mouth.
“His name was Victor. I think I fancied myself in love with him at the time although I realise now it was more of an infatuation. I wanted to kiss him. I did kiss him, we kissed a few times. Before I ruined everything. So if sentiment is what you’re after then yes I suppose he was the best. But as I understand it most people are sentimental about their first kiss, at least that’s what my research leads me to believe.”
John shakes his head, clearly frustrated at Sherlock’s tried and true tactic for derailing such discussions.
He has just about drifted off when he hears Sherlock mutter beside him; “You still owe me that blowjob.”
“Yes. University.” Sherlock pauses, contemplating if he is prepared to throw caution to the wind completely. Well; resisting temptation has never been his strong suit, particularly when that temptation was John Watson. He ignores the claxons sounding in his head and continues.
John chuckles and then they are kissing again. Slow and sweet and heated all at once. Emboldened my John’s enthusiasm Sherlock moves to rest his palm on John’s thigh which is apparently the right thing to do because John drags his hands up the nape of Sherlock’s neck in response and proceeds to thread his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. John tugs slightly and the sensation on Sherlock’s sensitive scalp makes the detective pull back with a gasp. John uses this as an opportunity to start kissing his way down Sherlock’s neck; laying soft pecks and wet sucks along the underside of Sherlock’s jaw. The feeling of John’s teeth gently pressing on Sherlock’s sternocleidomastoid muscle draws a startled moan from Sherlock and he tightens his grip on John’s thigh. He feels John chuckle against his moist skin as he starts kissing his way back up Sherlock’s neck.
John snorts; “mate you’re thinking about this too hard. I don’t need a spreadsheet or anything, just what was the best kiss you’ve ever had? You know; rocked your world, made you see God type of snog.”
It’s quieter now. Deductions a little more cautious and words carefully chosen. Not because you care anymore than you did before about the outcome. At least not for your own sake.
You think sometimes that, even if John moved back and starting looking at you with that easy affection from before and held you and kissed you and all your wildest dreams came true- it still wouldn’t be enough. You’ve become so used to wanting that maybe you don’t know how to be any other way.
Sherlock shifts slightly, hand loosening from its grip on John’s shoulder and thigh adjusting against John’s groin. John exhales at the warm pleasure that zings lazily along his nerves in response to Sherlock’s movement. It hasn’t gone unnoticed-
Sherlock shuffles over and offers John a hand and John reaches for it. The wicked grin on John’s face should have been enough of an indicator to Sherlock of what’s going to happen next but the alcohol has slowed his wits and he is on his bum beside John before he realises John’s underhanded move.
“Sherlock. Look. If it makes you uncomfortable to talk about this we can just drop it….but I’d like to ask you a question, if that’s alright?”
They eventually stop and John, ignoring his phone’s wailing again, looks at Sherlock with such a fondness that Sherlock feels weak and absolutely ruined with sentiment.
Sherlock feels the slight chill of panic down his spine at John’s question, worried his thoughts are written all over his face. He blushes deeply, thankful for the low light of the dying fire, and decides quickly that he needs to derail this conversation before it goes any further.
Sherlock pushes up and kisses John slowly, mouth sour from sleep, and John relaxes into the liquid feeling of it. Sherlock pulls back and winks; “hold that thought”, before throwing the covers back and dashing off into the bathroom. John gives a frustrated huff as he smiles to himself and rubs his hand over his face and waits for Sherlock to finish.
When the giggling eventually peters off Sherlock realises their hands are still clasped and their faces are close enough for him to feel John’s breath on his cheek and it makes his stomach do a sudden, not entirely unpleasant, somersault.
Sherlock gives a non-committal hum, eyes already absorbed back in the work in front of him. John chuckles, despite the itch along his spine at the thought of going back to an empty bed, and makes a move toward the bedroom.
That after everything you put him through he still wants to give you the time of day. That after making him watch you jump from a building, manipulating him time and time again
“Yeah, yeah, it’s just an expression. You’re avoiding the question anyway. I won’t judge you know? Where just 2 drunk mates…having a chat.”
Eventually he pulls back and takes in the sight of Sherlock’s blown pupils and kiss-plump lips. John smiles softly down at him and Sherlock smiles coyly back and John drinks it all in and thinks simply;
Sherlock is just staring at him; his face is fragile and fierce and amused all at once and in that moment John’s heart seizes and the next words tumble out of his mouth so easily and sincerely and without any hesitation.
The thick silence is abruptly interrupted by John’s message tone going off and the noise startles a jump out of Sherlock who manages to smack his chin into John’s forehead.
“Before that was someone at university. So you see John, I don’t exactly have a wealth of experiences to pick from. But I suppose if you take away the lack of attraction and the fact that it was a ruse to get to Magnussen, technically speaking, Janine was the best. If we’re going with skill.”
But John. Wonderful, brilliant, amazing John has noticed Sherlock’s reaction and begins to slowly rub his thumb over the tight bud and it hits Sherlock suddenly that this isn’t just kissing anymore. This is leading to something. This is leading to sex.
Yes, hope comes snapping at your heels in the dark quiet nights when the fire is banked and you’re still buzzing from the high of his company, but reality does a good job of kicking it away.
Sherlock lifts his gaze and John is staring right at him and the intensity of that look is making Sherlock’s cheeks, already alcohol-flushed, heat even further. John licks his lips and shifts a little closer and Sherlock can feel his own heartbeat thundering against his rib cage and pounding in his ears. For a second he wonders if this isn’t all a dream, it feels surreal; as though he is a spectator on his own life. Not for the first time tonight he is reminded of John’s stag night and how they carefully hovered by the edge of something more. He still wonders whether John felt the same electric heat that Sherlock did that night, heavy limbed and almost magnetically pulled toward each other; the distance between their chairs counting for nothing. The shadows of that night and how it could have ended were something Sherlock often revisited in his mind palace, the echoes of warmth and contentment and hope choosing to come back and tug unpleasantly at Sherlock in his lowest moments.
) foray into romantic sentiment, what he felt for Victor did not even compare to the absolutely world altering feeling of loving John Watson.
You think of all these tiny little things, unpack them all at once and then jumble them all together and hope so fiercely you can almost shut out the waspish voice in your head saying
It’s utterly ridiculous and you laugh at the absurdity of it all. Laugh and cry. It’s humiliating- just a massive rush of endorphins and adrenaline flooding your system.
“Yes well, Irene Adler. Just the once. After I saved her from a beheading. I believe it was a kiss of gratitude, possibly a reaction to adrenaline and the threat of her own mortality. She’s gay of course, but she has spent so much of her life manipulating people of all genders with sex and desire that I think it was a natural response. Or perhaps she just saw it as a fitting end to the game. There was, I suppose, an attraction between us, but for me it was never anything more than the attraction of a worthy opponent. She played the game well, she did it in such a way that fascinated me. But I didn’t want her. Not in the way you assumed. She is an attractive woman. But as I’ve mentioned before, women aren’t really my area.”
John’s got that look in his eyes again and Sherlock realises now it isn’t pity. Not really. It’s an odd mix of sadness and wonder. His expression turns contemplative for a second, his eyes shift away and his brow furrows and Sherlock begins to think he has made John uncomfortable. He watches John’s free hand as it clenches and unclenches against John’s thigh. The possibilities of what’s triggered that reaction can usually be narrowed down to only a select few things. Sherlock wonders - anger? Or stress? Evidently he is suppressing something. Sherlock waits for the inevitable outburst but, as usual, John Watson surprises him.
He pauses, waiting for Sherlock’s permission to continue. Sherlock waves him ahead nonchalantly, pretending his stomach hasn’t just dropped to his knees.
Sherlock doesn’t end up getting that blowjob but later, when they both lie there with sticky skin and ruddy cheeks, he looks over at John and says the word so easily.
He stops by every third day with a cup of tea and a pastry from the bakery outside the hospital. He doesn’t wipe your face or fiddle with your monitors and there is something distant about his presence.
You come to several hours later, bones aching with cold and your own neglect and you trudge down the road to the chippy and order so much fish and chips that the lad behind the counter gives you a wary look, like he’s not sure if you’re having him on. You can’t really blame him; last time you were there you were drugged to the eyeballs and got into an argument with his co-worker about not wearing a hair net. You take the steaming bundle back to the flat and gorge yourself on chips until your stomach aches from it. Your phone pings and you ignore it. It’s just Mycroft, he wants to know if there’s a list.
Your wounds heal, your stitches come out, life sluggishly moves along. You’re not allowed on active cases for a while but Lestrade brings you some cold case files and Molly lets you borrow a few body parts from the morgue.
Sometimes, late at night, when the sounds of Mrs Hudson’s serials have stopped drifting up the stairwell and the traffic outside has slowed to an erratic, infrequent hum, you allow yourself to hope.
The two took a cab to the Omega House,which was basically a facility that bred, trained, and sold omegas. It was  a long, low building made out of depressing cement. The lawn, fenced in by a chain link fence, was in a pitiful state; the grass seemed to have been burned. Vines were creeping up the walls and the shingles on the roof were rusting. When the two alphas entered the building, they were greeted with an onslaught of omega scent-a mixture of fear, arousal, and pain.
“Come on, this is not a trick, love,” John pressed gently, suddenly realizing that the omega was probably scared of eating because his previous owners would trick him with food.  “You can have all the biscuits you want. I won’t take them from you, I swear. I know you don’t believe me…. But please, try too. You need some meat on those bones of yours. Didn’t they feed you at the House?”
They came around a bend in the road and were greeted with the sight of what appeared to be a ramshackle inn. A crooked sign hung on a rotten post: The Yard. Several tired looking nags were tied to a crooked hitching post, eating from a pile of hay. A flea-bitten hound dog lay in the middle of the path, watching the road with tired eyes. From within the inn came a bright, warm, glowing light. “This is it! The Yard.” Ace took Sherlock’s arm and marched him up to the door. “Welcome to the real world, Sherlock.”
so sorry this is short. I wrote it while on vacation and I was very distracted. Anyway, please enjoy and no negative comments, thank you :)
“I like that,” Sherlock said, smiling slightly. His finger remained latched to John’s and John didn’t make a move to let go. The omega wrinkled up his nose, eyes fluttering, and bit his lip, as if deep in thought. “Jawn?”
The handler raised an eyebrow, looking confused. “Don’t you wish to examine your purchase?” His expression read: Clearly, you are not an experienced owner.
The omega nodded solemnly. “It… it doesn’t hurt that bad. It hurt worse when they beat me, I guess.” His shoulders hitched when John poured some peroxide on an especially deep cut.
“You’re welcome. We’re going to go home now, alright? Can you walk?” John unclipped the leash. He wanted to take off the collar-which was tight around the boy’s thin neck-but it was illegal for an omega slave to be seen in public without a collar.
“I’m not afraid of you, John. At least, not anymore! I know I was and I was wrong. You showed me what love can be and what love is and I…” Sherlock leaned forward and gently pecked John on the lips. “I want this. I really do want this.”
Unfortunately, the task was not easy. You see, instead of sharing the moon’s gift, the advisor, Jim Moriaty, hoarded its healing power and used it to keep himself young for hundreds of years. And all he had to do was sing a special song. The lyrics go like this:
Sherlock bit his lip, which John found to be adorable. It was all John could do to stop himself from kissing the boy right there and then. “Y-You’re…. You’re the nicest man I’ve ever met, Jawn.”
- This is my brother. He works for the British ministry. A very important figure to me and to England itself. God save the Queen. I almost forgot, I'll give you your jacket back tomorrow morning. Don't be late for school.
- Nothing. We've just come to the conclusion that it's time to bury the hatchet. It doesn't make sense, does it?
A drizzling rain at 8 am. A piercing sense of loneliness and a dream to soar to the heavens just at the sight of the grey buildings. Treading lightly in the world without leaving their footprints anywhere seemed to be the only way for each of them, but they went against all the rules and chose their own.
London's Westminster School. The grey walls that hold the wisdom of the ages, the gates adorned with Latin lettering, the courtyard and the library that is always full of people. School really does become a second home - not all at once, of course - but you get to love the routine of the days spent reading, the joy of meeting friends, finishing lessons and taking long walks afterwards, arguing about nothing and talking about the same things. It is a time to find true friends, the rest is in our hands, whether we manage to keep it through the years, whether we can teach something new, and whether we learn ourselves.
"Even though we were close every day, there were still those things between us that we dared not say. As we lose faith and drift away from each other, we will try to find the words. No one knows what the future will bring, but moving forward hand in hand is exactly what makes us stronger. I want you to accept even my bad sides, because that's part of who I am now. And from this day forward, we will be what we have always been, we will be dreamers."
- Don't misunderstand him, John. He wants to get better, but he doesn't know how. He lacks faith in himself and in his future.
On a day off, it was business as usual. Morning mail. Redbeard dutifully brought the paper into the house, swiped the bacon off John's plate and ran out into the street. After breakfast, John went shopping with his grandmother. But the red dog was gone. Redbeard did not respond. It became a little unsettling, but still normal, because John knew his dog. He'd never run away from home for more than a couple of hours. Already since lunchtime, John started looking for his friend. He walked around the immediate area with Sherlock, asking around the neighborhood, but everyone said they didn't see any lonely dog wandering around.
Gratitude. An inability to repent. Arrogance and intelligence. That is exactly what Sherlock could say about James Moriarty in a few words. Their rivalry began a long time ago and is long overdue for an end, but neither of them will go for it first because it is a weakness to yield to your enemy.
After a couple of hours they did get down to their homework. Books spread around, the smell of paper, leather covers and worn dusty pages. In the small library of the Holmes house there was one ancient stained-glass window depicting the Virgin Mary. The sunlight falling on it turned into a multi-coloured glow. They sat beneath the stained glass window, studying the history of the Middle Ages, and in this blessed silence they heard each other's quiet sighs. And now, they were already sitting shoulder to shoulder. Sherlock's thin fingers traced across John's face, slowly descending to his lips. No, he didn't ask to close his eyes, he didn't ask permission, but he couldn't resist his friend's charm. A cautious and quick kiss. The same one that any girl who was in love with Holmes dreams of.
The conversation, which had started from nothing and gone nowhere, made them see each other's world in a new way. John was no longer the pragmatic and quiet but brave hero from one good fairy tale, and Sherlock turned out to be a dreamer. They listened to whispers of secrets, hoping to be heard. You cannot deceive your own heart, for it knows the true path, knows all secret desires. And the whole world was now open before them...
Confused, he made his way home. Sitting idly by was simply impossible because his friend was in danger. Not far from the outskirts of the town there was a road leading into the countryside and there into the forest. A whole day had been wasted, but it was only evening, there were still a few hours before complete darkness set in. "That will definitely be enough for me. I'll find Redbeard myself!"
- He's never been to a city this big. Back in Scotland, I could let him go for a day because I was sure Redbeard knew the area and would always get home in time. But it's not like that here!
- Well, it's not hard. You're Scottish, but you're not a redhead. Your hair's blond enough, I assume you inherited it from your father. Your middle name is Hamish. No Englishman would give that as a first name, I mean at baptism, and as your middle name is John, more reversible in speech, I can deduce that your mother is English. Blood mix, pure genetics, chemistry, and we get you. It's also the accent from the north of Scotland that gives you away.
...wasn't an only child. His twin sister, Aria, died at the age of three of polio. An acute viral disease of the nervous system. In other words, spinal paralysis. No one could accept her death. Her parents began to hate James because it was their daughter and not their son who suffered such a fate. Aria was the favorite among the twins. Well, James was only "the other one." The constant yelling, the beatings, the hate speech. What do you think happened next? He lost his childhood. Closed in on himself, insecure, silent, himself full of hatred for people. In junior high school everyone was afraid of him, so he had no friends. When he turned nine, his parents sent James to boarding school, just to avoid seeing him. He didn't come home during the holidays and went abroad with the money he had saved. Better to be a wanderer without money than a rich heir to such a family. At thirteen he transferred to our academy. James had always been first in his class, but now he was second to me. Second again. Ever since then, he started bullying me. I put up with it, but at one point I hit him. Then for a long time I couldn't forgive myself for that. I decided to go to his house to apologize, and there I learned his story. I wanted to share this pain, I wanted to get closer to him, but I was scared. I pushed him away, and even now I'm sorry.
Sunday morning. They have arranged to meet in Regent's Park. Sherlock tells John that it's a favourite place for Londoners north-west of the centre. Like Hyde Park, Regent's was the personal hunting ground of Henry VIII and only became public in 1845. "I'm like my brother and proud of it" - Sherlock repeated this often, as if to remind John that he was just as clever as Mycroft. An ordinary walk between two friends, but they still had so much to learn about each other.
- All right, all right. I'll give in this time. But remember, one day, I'll burn heart out of you...
They sat on the silver-tinted blue silk, grabbing every breath because there wasn't much oxygen either. Disheveled hair and a half-unbuttoned shirt, a naive but sly deceptive look. They already knew who was playing this game, but they were in no hurry to expose it, or else there would be no excitement to play this game to the end.
The cold wind bit his face again. A fervent rage at the realization of his own insignificance in this world raged in his timid heart. Rotten leaves scattered along the road. To John, Redbeard is more than just a dog. He is more than just a friend. Someone so loyal, so understanding, who is never sad or bored. And if to John Redbeard is only a part of life, to Redbeard John is a whole life.
The argumentative questions were interrupted by quick kisses that made it hard to breathe. Fingers tangled in her hair, a shiver spreading through her body, a heartbeat so frantic that it echoed off the empty walls.
The sky is bathed in the fiery hues of sunset, and dusk is enveloping the earth. This evening will be the same as always. Quiet conversation, a cup of tea and a melody woven from the ephemerality of the violin and the truth of the piano. Two geniuses do not need words to understand each other. Music has the power to chisel fire out of people's hearts - and it will speak for them. And yet this evening was unlike any other before. Sherlock dared to say everything in one phrase, combining the apology with a promise to always be there for each other.
- It would distract me from my studies. My parents want me to be a doctor, maybe a chemist, maybe a diplomat.
- You're really good at dodging the question. I say one thing and you say another. If I say you're vain, this time you're saying you can't find a man in the world who lives as wretchedly as you do.
On the way home, each thought differently, but something united their thoughts. The anticipation of tomorrow. The two boys, very different from each other, were suddenly friends. It was incredible for both of them. Already at home, as night fell on the city and people slowly entered the realm of Morpheus, John and Sherlock looked up at the stars. Across the city, when the distance was measured in tens of kilometres, they were still connected by a single sky.
- Yeah, you're right. It's so boring... being perfect... being you. Oh, Sherlock, if you only knew what I miss.
- You don't divide people's actions into exclusively black and white, but I dare you to ask this, Sherlock.
All people in this world have in common the bitter taste of regret over ignored circumstances. It's like standing at the edge of an overflowing river and knowing you can't change anything. It's like that in life, you're drowning. You want to go back in time and make things right. James didn't like idle talk, but he did it anyway, thus deceiving himself. The illusion of friendship, of someone actually being interested in you, and vice versa.
- I wrote you letters, but I got nothing back. I was deluding myself, covering my thoughts with a thin layer of dust. I was told to let it go, but I couldn't. Soon I stopped doing that too, so as not to disturb you unnecessarily.
- Almost right. Scots and Picts. The history of the Scottish kingdom begins in 843, when Kenneth MacAlpin united the two tribes. Eh, teach better.
The next day at the academy, the first lesson was world history. Sherlock and John were already sitting together reading the last pages of the paragraph, finishing the assignment. James knew that Sherlock was certainly not alone, but still managed to approach and say a polite hello. A brief conversation ensued between the two geniuses, understood only by the two of them. Such behaviour surprised absolutely everyone. "What happened to him?". "Surely this is James Moriarty, the one?".
After that, John gave his jacket to Sherlock and started to go home. John expected nothing in return, but the words of gratitude reached his heart. At that moment a spark was kindled that would soon burst into a bright flame. At the gate young Holmes caught up with him and tried to say something, but it only amused John. At first.
Westminster School London is one of the most popular and elite schools in England. He had just transferred here. He had already received his uniform and textbooks the other day and had time to remember all the classrooms and teachers' names. He and his family had moved from the north of Scotland to London. There was a reason for that - his father's death. His mother could no longer stay in that house, it hurt her to be in those places where she had first found love and then lost everything. London was chosen, perhaps because his grandmother lived there. And so, a week later, he goes to a new school where one encounter will change the rest of his life. He is a fourteen year old boy with blond wheat-coloured hair called John Watson.
In the beautiful gloom of the past, we do find freedom, and our wish - to always be honest and sincere - is fulfilled.
Being proper Englishmen, they began with a cup of tea and milk. Outside the window it was pouring with rain that never seemed to stop. Sherlock's older brother would be arriving in two hours, so they didn't have much time.
He chased Alasdair like never before. The ground flew from under his hooves, dust rose, and his heavy breathing echoed. Almost in darkness John noticed something flickering among the trees. He tried to stop the horse, but it reared up sharply, toppling the rider. There was a thud. John's head hit the ground, but he quickly got up and ran after something ginger. Scratching against thorny branches, stumbling into puddles and stumbling over rocks, he kept running. "Redbeard! Redbeard!" But it wasn't a dog, just a fox. Alasdair remained waiting for John at the spot. Going back home didn't feel like it at all, because that's how John found him. A little longer and night will fall, darkness will descend on the land, and then the way home will be almost impossible to find. John ducked into the horse's mane, struggling to hold back the tears, and so on all the way home...
Being a true Scot, he is willful, hot-hearted, but kinder than anyone else. There, he was truly free. Little Watson's favourite time of day is evening, towards sunset. The sun is slowly retreating beyond the unattainable horizon, giving way to his sister Moon. The cold breeze from the fjords brings something far away that you can't find in your own land, which is probably why you begin to think that you are lonely. In the Scottish fields John would run with his dog, flying a kite, or sometimes ride his father's horse. A noble Clydesdale called Alasdair, which is a family favourite. John was upset when he had to leave for London because it was impossible to bring the horse with him, but his mother was never able to sell him. Despite all the pain, that horse belonged to her husband and he gave it to his son. John now lives with his grandmother in Kensington in a huge mansion that has been passed down through the generations. The neighbourhood itself truly reflects the English atmosphere. Victorian architecture, stunning green streets and upscale restaurants.
- You never noticed me. Ever since we were kids, you and I had been rivals, but we were friends. Do you understand? Don't you remember what it was like before?
- It's up and to the end, then to the right. I'll be right there. I want to get some books from the library.
- Last week you promised to let me read a book on astronomy. Would you be so kind as to bring it to me, please? I've got a car coming to pick me up soon.
The trip to get the books turned into a conversation where they exposed their souls. John listened to Sherlock talking about his life, about his brother, about where he was with him, about his dreams and expectations from his life. And after young Holmes asked some questions John was very astonished, because it seemed that Sherlock knew absolutely everything. John's story was not so interesting - usual life of a boy out of town, playing with his friends till the dark, hiking in the mountains and seeking adventures, but Sherlock was listening to it with bated breath. No rules, no obligations or responsibilities, but a life of freedom. They listened to what they didn't have themselves. Two completely different children from completely different childhood worlds found themselves in someone else who became truly close.
They were together again. The master and the red dog. Redbeard plopped John down on the ground and never stopped wagging his tail. They were both insanely happy. Sherlock told him that he had found him near the river near the bridge. Redbeard was lost and didn't know where to go, so he didn't try to find his way home. None of that mattered now, because the worst was over. John couldn't even find the words to thank Sherlock. He just kissed him. In the middle of the street in the moonlight they kissed softly, knowing that words were unnecessary here.
- You mean like violin lessons? How about horseback riding? Fencing? Shooting? I always thought of you, but at one time you were depressed. I still don't know what happened.
James himself favoured the exact sciences, such as mathematics or physics. Mathematics, he said, encompasses not only truth but also the highest beauty - a beauty that is cold and austere, like the beauty of sculpture.
John ran to the stables without saying anything to his grandmother, saddled Alasdair and was already on horseback heading down that road into the woods. They had a long way to go in the woods: miles of silence and no wind. The cautious flitting of birds. Purple bells in glades, trembling aspen leaves, triumphant light, and finally, forest twilight, when dampness reeks from moss and fireflies burn in the grass. The forests are never silent. But all John wanted to hear was a familiar voice. That tinkling bark of his red-haired dog.
Soon a black car pulled up, out of which a young man in a sharp suit and a nice tie, holding a classic black umbrella. John at once realized that he was from the upper classes of British aristocracy, but who he was to Sherlock was not an easy mystery.
- Erm... Well... There were definitely Scots and I think there were Gaelic tribes... Come on, there's no such thing!
- Thank you, Sherlock. Tell me if you ever wanted to cry, but no tears came, so you just sat there staring into the void, feeling your heart break...
- And then I left him by the river on the other side of town. John was very worried about him. That dog is his friend.
- Because you and I both believe that this world isn't such a cruel place. And I'm ready to accept you, James. Are you ready?
