“I said he’s clean. I’m his partner. We
Actually, I'll be very surprised if someone is still interested in finding out what's going to happen to our boys, thank you for being so patient. I really appreciate it!
John closed his eyes to gather his thoughts, but before he could say anything, Mycroft spoke again, “Third floor, room twenty-six. I have already informed the doctor that you are coming.”
I hope you enjoyed the short update, and please, tell me your thoughts! I'd love to hear them.
Gently closing the wooden door behind him, Sherlock exited the room, and exited his mind palace.
After the moment of surprise, Sherlock relaxed under his touch and brought his left hand up to cup John’s cheek, his thumb caressing the skin as he kissed John back. John could feel the faint stubble on Sherlock’s jaw brushing against his skin, as Sherlock dived into the kiss, opening his lips just enough to allow John’s tongue enter his mouth.
A little bird with a disproportionately broad, grey-brown chest and a large, rounded head fluttering above the dashing pedestrians, blissfully unaware of the pressures of ordinary human life, let out a high-pitched chirp, but it was drowned out by a fist-shaking man shouting obscenities at a cab driver. Undeterred, the bird spread out its quivering wings and dove downward, landing in a patch of sunlight that danced on a nearby windowsill. As if elated by the warmth, its breast puffed up like a lump of yeast dough ballooning under a tea towel, and it began to sing joyful, whistle-like notes, its buoyant call giving the promise of a pleasant, rainless day ahead.
Sherlock closed his eyes briefly. He stood on both feet, his dark blue dressing gown hanging loosely around his slim body, which had grown even thinner during the past week, his pyjama bottoms dragging low on his waist. His face needed shaving, his hair wasn’t immaculately coiffed as usual, his curls a dishevelled mess on top of his head, standing in awkward clumps. John couldn’t help but notice the coffee stain on his white T-shirt, standing out like blood on snow. Sherlock could be so vain and pedantic, and John knew that he would never intentionally wear dirty clothes. Knowing that Sherlock was unaware of the coffee stain made his chest feel tight. John didn’t have the heart to point it out. Instead, he made a mental note to remove the stain later when Sherlock abandoned the shirt somewhere in the house.
He heard a monitor beeping in the background, the voices of three—no, four—people in the room, shoes squeaking on the linoleum floor.
“I just thought you could use some advice,” Mycroft added after a short pause, looking uncomfortable as he eyed the black umbrella in his hand.
He heard the worry in John's voice despite his attempt to hide it. Sherlock winced unintentionally. He was in pain, it hurt more than John could imagine. It wasn't just his sight that had been taken away from him. He had lost the ability to look into John's dark blue eyes, to watch his sandy blond hair getting ruffled by him running his fingers through it, to gaze at John's perfect ass. To see him smiling and laughing. Sherlock's heart ached. It burned in his chest, making him feel nauseous.
Hey you lovely people! :)
He felt John’s hands on his face, as he carefully removed the mask. Sherlock leaned into his touch, letting his eyelids flutter closed. There was only darkness, a suffocating blackness, and he couldn’t escape it. It was everywhere. He swallowed hard against the lump in his throat, and bit the inside of his cheek in order not to cry, but he couldn’t stop the single tear from escaping the corner of his eye.

“It’s very rare, and more common in overweight women so—“
The sound of the antique German wall clock penetrated his mind.
The man, Sherlock, blinked several times in quick succession, his eyes widening. With a haste that surprised John, he scrambled up into a sitting posture, something allied to fear flitting across his features before his face returned to something inscrutable. As Sherlock twisted his head toward him, the frown on his forehead deepened. Instead of looking at John, his eyes were staring somewhere above his head with curious intensity, his expression schooled into an unreadable mask.
Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat, and John pulled back a bit, pausing, their lips barely touching as they breathed each other’s air.
John had an aggravating habit of fleeing whenever they had a heated argument, but as much as Sherlock tried to convince himself that this time was nothing out of the ordinary, he couldn’t vanquish the thought that it was a prelude to John’s leaving him permanently. Because surely he hadn’t said anything that warranted such a strong reaction, he reflected. Admittedly, telling his boyfriend that his work was the only thing that he had left was a bit not good, as John would so aptly put it, but certainly the man should know by now that he was everything to him—a friend, a partner, a lover, a soulmate, his companion and one true love, his heart’s desire, or whatever other clichéd, sickly sweet word or mawkish expression there was to convey how much the man meant to him.
Although he knew Sherlock couldn’t see it, John smiled at him, satisfied; he considered it a victory whenever he succeeded in making Sherlock Holmes eat. “Just that I’d prefer my boyfriend alive.”
“Jesus, I didn’t see you at first,” John said, evidently startled. “God, it’s pitch-dark here. Wait, let me switch on the lights.”
Feeling agitated, Sherlock pressed the tips of his fingers to his temples, as if to push the distressing thoughts away. He understood with painful clarity that he wasn’t the same man whom John had fallen in love with. A twinge of anxiety went through him at the thought, and he screwed his eyes closed, the three middle fingers of each hand massaging the skin above his ears. He was a mere shadow of the enigmatic and ingenious consulting detective who had somehow managed to enamour the gallantly courageous, charming, and ever so gentle army doctor. Digging his fingers deeper into his skin, Sherlock clenched his jaw, his molars grinding together. He could hear his brother’s voice in his head, his tone thick with derision: “I told you it wouldn’t last, brother dear. People like us aren’t meant for romantic entanglements.”
John swallowed, the saliva in his mouth felt suddenly thick as glue. He wasn't ready for this, not ready to deal with a man unwilling to show his weakness, unwilling to say he was scared, that he needed comfort. That he needed John.
The door to the room was slightly ajar, probably left open by an absent-minded nurse, Sherlock thought, or perhaps by John.
I'm so sorry that it took me so long to update. This chapter wasn't easy to write, but I'm happy to finally be able to publish it.
Even his sense of smell had become more sensitive, at times unbearably so, his brain interpreting incoming signals from the olfactory bulb with astonishing precision. He pressed the side of his face closer against the back of the armchair, breathing in the familiar and comforting scent of John—a rich blend of sandalwood, cedar, sweet orange, and a hint of tangerine—mingled with the faint, musty smell of dusty cushions and a trace of tobacco—an undeniably amusing reminder of the time he had thoroughly enjoyed a cigarette slouched in John’s chair in a tacit, and perhaps a bit childish—though he would never admit it to John—protest after the man had gotten rid of his secret stash in his Persian slipper. The right corner of his lips curved into a half-smile at the memory, but when he caught himself, it vanished and was replaced by a pout.
He wouldn't be able to offer John the life he deserved, not without his sight. John hadn't asked for a baby to take care of; he had more important things to do than to help Sherlock dress, help him shower, help him do everything. John had got bored with his job as a GP. He would get bored with Sherlock. John craved his daily dose of adrenaline; he wouldn't get it with a man who didn't manage to spread butter on his bread.
The waiting was unbearable. With the sound of the steadily ticking clock, echoing through the almost empty waiting room, John wrung his fingers nervously, casting a desperate glance toward the wall clock every other minute. He wanted to see Sherlock. He
Without further ado, I hope you enjoy this new chapter!
John placed the empty cup on the bedside table and returned his gaze back to Sherlock. “You need to get some sleep.” John kept his tone gentle but firm, catching Sherlock’s hand in his.
Closing his eyes, John stayed still, breathing in the scent of Sherlock’s hair. He could smell a hint of disinfectant and latex, but the familiar musky scent of pine trees and lavender was still detectable. Breathing through his nostrils, John let the scent calm him, to remind him of home. He wanted to linger in the warmth that radiated from Sherlock’s body, curl up next to his sleeping form, and forget everything else for a while.
“Because I love you.”
John watched the nurse, not letting go of Sherlock’s hand, as she proceeded to check the monitors, writing down the results on a chart in her hand.
“So do you.”
But oh, how wrong they had been. Sherlock certainly had a heart, and now it was breaking, shattering into a million pieces, because of John.
Reaching the end of the hallway, Sherlock saw that the light was coming through an open door. He came to a halt, grabbing his chest, feeling his heart beating erratically through the damp fabric of his hospital gown. He was gasping for air, his vision blurring, when he suddenly heard a noise, a beeping sound coming from the room.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, his breathing uneven.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock straightened his back, feeling his senses heightened by the sudden surge of adrenaline that swept through him, and took a cautious step toward the open door. The beeping grew louder and louder, more frequent, as he took another step.
Without warning or ceremony, mind full of John, Sherlock found himself sitting on the ice, excruciating pain splitting through his left arm, before he even knew he had fallen. A young couple came over to ask if he was all right. Sherlock nodded, held his arm close to his body and struggled to stand. He had to shuffle slowly towards the edge of the rink. To his immediate and eternal mortification, John was skating towards him.
Sherlock woke up and froze. He was confused for a moment because he was too warm and felt a bit sticky. He stilled, not wanting to make any flopping moves or strange stretching noises to awaken John. Slowly, he opened his eyes. There he was. John. His John. He’d always been his John, but now it was realized in all of the ways Sherlock had wanted.
Sherlock raised himself up slightly so he could look at John. He softly smiled as he took in John’s relaxed expression. His John was so beautiful.
He leaned back and said, “It’s all right, but I’m just thinking of my chemistry homework.”
He stopped so suddenly in the lounge doorway that John bumped into his back. He quickly turned as John was saying, “What -” He cut him off with kiss. Sherlock pulled John’s smaller frame to his and tightly wrapped his arms around his shoulders, shoving one hand through the hair on the back of John’s head. John reached up and threaded both hands through Sherlock’s curls. They stood there in the doorway, kissing, feeling. John’s hands roamed from his curls to his jawline to his neck then back up to his head. Sherlock, on the other hand, had settled his large hands over John’s bum and was pulling him upwards, squeezing and holding his hips close to his own. The feeling of John’s hard cock, trapped in denim but very prominent, was pushing Sherlock towards desperation. His hands shook, he shivered all over, and his breath came out in quick puffs and pants.
(See the end of the chapter for
John was silently wondering why Sherlock thought they would like this place, when their usual haunts tended to be quiet, hidden dives known only to a handful of locals, with delicious ethnically interesting dishes. He was extremely flattered, however, that Sherlock seemed to want to wine and dine him in an extravagant restaurant.
Sherlock smiled a small, shy grin, “I’m yours for the taking.”
Sherlock shook his head. The movement pulled at his neck muscles and he winced.
“No. We’ll visit Lestrade in the morning. Then,” he sighed, “I go model for some bad guys.”
“Hello, Sherlock.”
Sherlock looked at him for a lingering moment, wondering how it was possible to feel so much at once. Peace, calm, affection, desire. And when he thought of their mission, dread and fear. His stomach turned with it.
“Hello.”
“I love you too. I’ve got you.” John’s strong arms cradled him on the floor eventually grounding Sherlock in their new reality.
“Neither do I. Maybe he got in some kind of trouble, faked his own death. This is exactly the kind of person who would be running an international human trafficking ring,” said John. “A phantom.”
When puberty hit he furiously wanked whenever he could, getting hard and ejaculating into hands, sheets, tissues, pants, whatever was available. During those years, he spent long hours in his room exploring his pleasure with many different tools: his fingers, palms, lotion, a fondly-remembered silk pocket square, and nudie magazines procured from a skip behind the local pub. In the loo, he used the hand-held shower head, set to pulse, to summon bliss not previously experienced.
Sherlock was still staring deeply into John’s eyes, but his lips had started to quiver and his eyes were stinging with unshed tears. He blinked, willing the tears to resorb into his eyes and not fall embarrassingly down his cheeks.
“Now?”
John looked back at him, tension and sadness still tinged his eyes.
They were too close for Greg to respond so he stayed silent.
“D.I. Lestrade. Works in homicide.”
Why would he be sad? I wondered if he was an emotional drinker. Family history said ‘maybe’. I did not like the direction this conversation was heading. I needed to make John happy and interested. I needed to make John stay.
Suddenly I wished that I was reclining on the couch. Sitting face to face with those inquisitive eyes felt like being flayed open. I supposed that’s how everyone felt when they faced me.
When they were thirteen, Victor told Sherlock that he liked boys. Like,
John snorts a small laugh and says, “I’m sorry,” without a hint of remorse.
Sherlock lunged forward. The moment before he crushed his lips to John’s, he whispered, “Let's.”
One last thought, he said, “So maybe not drugs? How would they get me out unnoticed if I’m passed out?”
They’d lost him.
Sherlock stared at John, both hands tightening into fists.
One hour and seventeen minutes later, I heard the downstairs door unlock. John was home but he did not immediately ascend the stairs. I listened as silent minutes ticked by.
Sherlock looked horrified. “Oh my god.”
Sherlock didn’t take his eyes off of John and bumped their cups together. Sherlock leaned in and kissed John sweetly. He pulled back and said, “I love you too.”
Sherlock looked at him and crinkled his nose, “What? You haven’t...Oh! Oh…” Sherlock seemed to realize something. “I wasn’t thinking about your old blog post. I was thinking about when I...left,” he looked cautiously at John, “I learned the brightest stars and when I looked at them I imagined you were looking at them too.” He paused for a long moment, then took an extra-long draw on the wine bottle. John took his hand. “I dunno...it made me feel better.”
“The night of your first date with Sarah, you said you hoped I wasn’t suggesting you and I go on a date. Remember? You said what you and Sarah were about to do, you hoped I wasn’t suggesting we do together. What was I to think?” He finished quietly, “I knew then that your attraction to me was over. Which was fine actually, my feelings for you were not known to me then.”
“All right,” Sherlock answered seriously. John smiled and it was a huge, honest thing that crinkled his eyes and revealed two almost-dimples in his stubble-covered cheeks.
on Tumblr. I'd love it if you'd come by and say hello.
Sherlock's lips quirked at how silly (adorable) he looked, and said softly, "John."
“Now. Mine,” Sherlock moaned, “Please.” Sherlock had never been so eager and rarely plead for anything.
The figure immediately threw off the blanket and cowered away from him, scooting several feet back until he sat in the corner with his knees tucked up towards his chin. The man looked at him, unblinking and terrified. Sherlock knew those eyes as well as he knew his own. Relief and sheer terror washed over him simultaneously.
John looked around the very neat home office. His eyes landed on the photographs framed hanging above the desk. There were several different shots of Graham with various celebrity designers. They all had the flashy posed look of photos taken at the Vanity Fair party or Met Gala after-party by a professional paparazzo. Graham had his arm around each person and a huge smile. There was one other photo that was much more intimate. No flash, no after-party glazed look on his face. It was him and Mary, somewhere on a London sidewalk, arm in arm, looking at each other with clear affection. Mary looked older and very professional, but also soft and happy. He had to remind himself that she was not the loving woman he had married. She was a criminal. A psychopath. She had Sherlock. And possibly Victor and Noah. And maybe poor Jack was still alive somewhere. She and Graham knew where all of those beautiful men were locked up. John wanted the key.
“All right.”
John told the driver to pull over several blocks away from Agra. He held Sherlock’s hand even when paying the cabbie. They exited the car and stepped into a small alley.
“Wait here.” Sherlock took off around the corner. John scrolled on his phone until Sherlock returned 10 minutes later with a posh-looking bag from a small grocer nearby. “Come on.”
“Let me go! Fuck you!”
John felt Sherlock flatten is tongue and swipe quickly up, and up, and up, and up against his entrance, over and over again. John could feel every taste bud drag along his sensitive flesh. He writhed back and forth thrusting his cock up into nothing. He couldn’t stay still, but Sherlock held onto him tightly. Just as he was going to ask for more, or different, or something...Sherlock right hand moved towards his own lips. Sherlock was sucking on his fingers.
. Someone he cared about and didn’t want to insult by checking his phone mid-flirt.
Mycroft had the decency to look slightly contrite. “As soon as this operation involved my brother, I had to intervene.” John wondered who he was talking about.
John nodded.
Sherlock excused himself to use the loo. John took their plates, cutlery and leftovers to the sink to rinse. Even over the rushing water, John heard the bathroom door open and Sherlock’s soft footprints approaching him. He switched off the tap just as Sherlock’s arms slipped around his waist.
There was no way for him to know how long his body and mind hovered in that state, but he was aware when the high began to even out. He became aware of when he was able to hear. Finally, when his eyes were open, he could actually see. He saw Victor, also on the floor, still and breathing shallowly, almost as if in sleep.
“Yeah, that’s her. Do you know her?”
John turned his head to the side and crashed their lips together with a groan, sliding their lips and tongues together wetly right there in the spring sunshine.
He shook her hand and walked out towards the main door to the office.
“It’s driving me crazy!” Sherlock pulled his hair with the orange gloves, made a pained face, and stared at his hands. He looked utterly confused about why his hands were covered in industrial rubber and removed them, flinging them in John’s general direction. “It’s a Eurasian wryneck,
Sherlock sighed, sat down on the nearest bench and let John touch his arm. His touch was so gentle. He cradled his forearm with one had in his palm, like a handshake, and the other hand at his elbow. It hurt. His arm hurt, probably a broken wrist. But it also hurt to look at John’s concerned face. His touch was gentle as his eyebrows knit together, mouth tightly held in a frown.
They laid back, looking up at the few stars they could see in the light-polluted London sky. Every once in awhile one of them would sit up to take a sip of wine.
Seb visibly tensed at this. “I’d rather do this here and now. We have a fundraiser to attend and need to leave very soon.”
“But you?”
John reaches across the table and brings their fingers together, just his fingertips gently brushing against Sherlock’s. Sherlock turns his hand over in clear invitation. His smile grows a little wider, and the blush on his cheeks spreads to his ears. John wants to eat him alive.
“No, it was you.”
Sherlock eagerly unbuckled his belt and opened John’s jeans and reached in for his prize. It did not disappoint. It was hard and hot in Sherlock’s hand. John grunted and moaned when Sherlock stroked his cock, matching the rhythm of John’s hand on his own cock.
John reached his other hand over to cradle Sherlock’s jaw. “Oh, love. Darling. Tell me.” The endearments seemed to make Sherlock weep more. John got up and awkwardly bent over to hug Sherlock’s head to his chest. Sherlock’s arms came up and clung to his back as he silently cried into his jumper. John said, “Shush, love. It’s okay. We’ll find him.” He repeated over and over, “We’ll find him. We’ll find him,” until Sherlock’s breath calmed and his grip on John relaxed.
John stood in the hallway of a very posh apartment building, keeping silent as Greg’s people entered the listed address of Graham the Assistant. The only reason he was allowed at the scene was because he’d insisted, and would not step less than half a meter from Greg at any time. Greg acquiesced because he’d helped make the connection between James and Graham. What he didn’t know was that Greg had also allowed it because he liked John and knew that he was good for Sherlock.
Sherlock held John tightly around the shoulders with his good arm, the other flung up above his head. His mouth was open, panting, and John’s face was at his neck licking from one freckle to the next.
As calmly as I could make my voice, I said, “I’ve been clean for almost a year. I apologize that I didn’t mention it when I proposed we should live together. I understand if our new living situation is now in jeopardy. You must, of course, do what you think is right.” I dreaded looking back into his eyes but I knew I had to.
“About where it should be.”
“Dear, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with this but I think everything will be just fine. What have the last few days been like with Dr. Watson? He seems to be a bit obsessed with you already. He asked me what you liked to eat and how you took your tea. He talks about you like you are already a pair. Asked about the laundry. Nevermind about that. My point is he seemed to already be very invested in your friendship.” She added, “Partnership.”
“Two days,” John interrupted.
on Tumblr.
When he spoke, his voice was very low and gruff. It was almost a whisper, “Sherlock. Holmes. Stand. Up.”
Greg said, “It’s useless, something has happened to my people. We have to go.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John laid there with his eyes closed, humming on every exhale, rubbing his hand softly over Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock had his head resting on John’s hip, smiling at his blissed out boyfriend.
“Stimulation is a good thing for a marriage,” John smiles around his next sip, eyes never leaving Sherlock’s, “Keeps you from getting bored.”
He nodded again, lips curving up in a gentle fond smile.
In his mind’s eye, Sherlock was naked on his bed, duvet just covering his groin. All of his other skin would be exposed for John’s perusal. He would stand in the doorway and rake his eyes over long fingers, long arms, and miles of lean legs. John would not hesitate, he’d take off his own clothes and join the beauty in his bed and see where the night took them.
Sherlock had the good decency to look abashed. “I’ll buy you new ones.”
“Me?”
They each emitted small grunts and groans that were probably entirely inappropriate for the sidewalk, outside of the Russell Square Pret windows, at half four, on a Thursday. That wasn’t why their kiss slowed, however. Once John’s large smile, and Sherlock’s large smile, made it impossible to go on, they stopped and stood staring at each other with huge grins and the occasional giggle. It was entirely undignified and they heard, not one but two, tuts directed their way by passers-by. Neither of them gave a toss.
Another
John’s pulse stutters when the meaning of Sherlock’s hesitance dawns on him. It’s not a choice, though. It’s never a choice when it comes to Sherlock.
“What does that have to do with anything?”
John is instantly alert.
They eat in tense silence. Mycroft spooning porridge from a plastic pot should amuse him, but not being able to laugh about it with Sherlock somehow takes away the appeal. John keeps hoping some of the food will stain Mycroft’s bespoke suit, but the man is as meticulous about handling cutlery as he is about his job.
John swallows. He can taste bile. “Katherine.”
His skin tingles under James’s gaze. John can almost feel the heat of the burning oil fields that made the sky glow and him reckless. Adrenaline spurred him into action that fateful night in Afghanistan – but he knew his actions would be welcomed by his commanding officer; the situation with his straight flatmate is completely different.
John looks like he wants to argue but opts against it. Instead, he produces his phone and sends off a quick text. That John texts instead of calls will annoy Mycroft indefinitely. Sherlock sends John a small smile that the other man returns with a mischievous glint in his eye. It’s almost as though it were all back to normal.
Baker Street doesn’t have the space for a child.
“I didn’t want to find out the gender without you, my love.”
If their father could see them now.
John almost steps on it.
“Danny had to leave,” Harry pouts. “I wanted you to meet him. You’ll like him, Johnny, he’s really handsome and smart.”
The walls have cracks, running deep and destructive along the halls of his mind palace. Redbeard barks and whines at every creak that echoes overhead.
“Do you have a sister?”
Moriarty.
The shout gives way to laughter, a cackling almost, that stops when another whimper escapes the girl in the background.
The wound on her temple speaks of blunt force trauma – most likely the butt of a gun. John spares the white supremacist another glance, noting the expertly executed shot with a sinking feeling. The bulge below the fabric of the man's jacket, courtesy of a service weapon, draws his eyes.
John exhales sharply but Sherlock expected this.
“What?”
“I’m afraid England needs me more than you do at the moment.”
The doctor on call arrives before John has a chance to look up. For all of Sherlock’s mental prowess, he is unable to deduce just what he would have seen in John’s eyes.
“We’re on the run and needed a safe place to regroup.”
“How?”
“Tonight found me in the company of Mr Magnussen.”
“It was just texting.”
John groans. “What did he do now?”
“She’s become famous on YouTube with her sisters, then they split to go off to university but Cherise just released a new video last month – she’s going solo,” John fills him in without prompting. “Who’s Lukas?”
There is no time for conscious thought, just instinct. John slams into Sherlock’s back, tackling him onto the ground and shielding his body with his own.

John nods, genuinely grateful. He is in no condition to go flat hunting.
“May I ask what this is about?”
“Is Harry with you?” There’s a nervous quiver in her tone.
All Mycroft does is arch an eyebrow at his brother, unimpressed.
Mycroft is already shaking his head. “She never made it into Moriarty’s inner circles.”
John blinks, dropping his eyes back to the contents of the folder. His conclusions would mean that somehow Anthea has acquired enough authority to get the government to fund a house for him and his child.
“There has been movement among the criminal element.”
The blend of agony and fury on John’s face when Sherlock revealed himself in that restaurant is something he will never, ever forget.
John reaches out, gripping Sherlock’s slack fingers with his own.
“Sherlock,” John says. It conveys the ‘You better fill me in right now’ sufficiently.
“Why are you here?”
Sherlock seems to be galloping three steps ahead, listing every kind of nut he has ever read about. John blinks. There’s something tugging at his memories.
“The report?” she prompts.
Harry’s new flat is… impressive. The location alone, in the north of Southwark near London Bridge, means that Harry must have scored a decent new job. Then again, she has about three decades of experience as a graphic designer under her belt, and from what John heard she has a knack for it, too.
Sherlock feigns innocence. “That’s what I said.”
“That’s why he stays.”
“Last week, you asked Mike Stamford how his girlfriend Patricia is doing. Even I remember their breakup, and I deleted it twice already.”
“Jesus,” John coughs. He does not shield his eyes. Not for the first time, Sherlock wonders what horrors he has seen during his deployments.
He almost expects Sherlock to protest, but, with a look softer than anything John has ever seen on him, he holds his tongue. John is unable to look away, even as his pulse speeds up until it’s positively beating out a staccato.
“You know nothing!”
The thought of Mary cooing over ultrasound readouts, pretending they’re living in a bubble of marital bliss… John can’t suppress the shudder that image evokes.
“Yes.”
There you have it. Thoughts?
Janine even drops by for a visit, a tin of homemade biscuits in her hands, though her presence has no effect whatsoever. John could say he doesn’t feel viciously satisfied about it, but that would be a lie.
“Indeed.”
Then he skips out of the room, no crutches, no external assistance. The enthusiasm is infectious, John finds.
“I made a vow, John,” Sherlock whispers, “and I stand by it. We will find her before anyone can take revenge. I promise.”
Zed is not moving.
“You might have surpassed me in the number of death threats you receive, John.”
“Lestrade?! This is
“Keep me posted, you hear? And call me if you need a badge to ease the way.”
Sherlock flinches back, eyes widening when all the man does is get up again and worry about his hairstyle.
“They,” John gasps between laughs, “they faked suicides at each other? That’s what you’re telling me? Jesus…”
The older Holmes gives the faintest smirk. “You of all people must have realised, John, that Moriarty’s preoccupation with my brother escapes the confines of logic. If someone were to kill my brother right now, I assure you Moriarty’s revenge would make the earth quiver.”
Mycroft heaves a sigh. “As a doctor such as yourself should know, human beings require regular sustenance to function. I cannot have you faint in sight of cameras or gossiping nurses, John.”
He wants to make a quip but the look in Mycroft’s eyes stops him.
“I won’t run, John, I promise, just please, let me up, love. Please.”
When Q joins him at the kitchen island, the tea is cold and his eyes dry, but the box is closed. Q stares at his hands, speckled with blood.
“Signifying what?”
“She is your sister, isn’t she?” John says.
Mary’s tone is almost calm in comparison. “Call them back or I promise you, Jim, I will shoot.”
“This is a family matter,” Mycroft gripes.
A faint voice whispers inside his head that he’s being manipulated – but he also knows miscarriage statistics. He removes his left hand from where he was pressing both her wrists into her back at a taunt angle and shifts his legs to take the pressure off the damaged knee.
“Oh!” Sherlock gasps, eliciting an encouraging nod from John. “Siblings!”
John allows himself to feel smug about that for a second.
John’s brow furrows in interest. “To get his stuff on Mary?”
you.”
“Seriously, who? And why’s it keeping you away from Sherlock? Or… is that to protect him?”
“Is everything okay?” he asks loud enough for the absolutely inconspicuous group of ‘relatives’ at the table next to his to overhear.
“What,” John growls, turning to Mycroft. “You said you didn’t know. At the hospital – you said you’d have warned me if you had. But you lied, didn’t you?”
“And that’s a reason to smile like the cat that got the cream?”
“I found it,” John chimes in, crossing his arms. “On the floor of Sherlock’s room this morning. You know, when you couldn’t be reached.”
Close to midnight, Mycroft Holmes appears in the door to the master bedroom.
Jim has stepped back, letting the sniper completely take over battling John. He is obviously an expert in hand-to-hand combat; the chances of John emerging victorious are slim, yet if Sherlock’s estimate proves correct, they will have backup in three, two, one…
Not even James Bond seems to be able to think of anything to say to that. They fall silent, James’ hand never pulling away from around his shoulders.
“Hello, John.”
For on the first day of October, large posters appear all over London and cyberspace, showing a very familiar wedding photo.
Sherlock flashes a smile, replaces his Browning in his hip holster, and fulfils Janine’s wish. The ensuing hug comes as a surprise.
“All right, that’s it,” John grouses, followed by the sound of bare feet marching across the living room.
With that, Greg hangs up. John has never checked his emails faster in his life.
“I’m not at liberty to say,” Anthea interrupts smoothly, ignoring his curiosity. “Now, John. May I schedule you for the interview?”
“Sir.” It’s the butler. “There is a gentleman at the door going by the name of Mycroft Holmes. Do you wish me to let him in?”
“Lestrade?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak but stops himself and starts anew, eyes growing clouded. “Moriarty knows; more than what Riley printed. The eviscerated dog, the code word for the sniper…”
“At the
is surely going to sell a horrendous amount of papers.
“Well, we’ll have to inspect the crime scene.”
For several bittersweet moments, John indulges in a fantasy in which he is allowed to share Sherlock’s bed. He can see it perfectly: the kid playing with the skull, Sherlock trying to teach the periodic table with matching building blocks, John watching from the exact same chair he is currently sitting on.
Mary in a wedding dress, holding a gun.
John feels his hands clench into fists. It’s a good thing they confiscated the gun as evidence.
“John, please.”
“You’re just a PA,” is what John says.
Lestrade and his men pour in from the main hallway. The commotion distracts the sniper long enough for John to strike by slamming the man against a wall and pulling off his ski mask.
Mycroft’s features soften into something worse – pity. “Regret is such a nasty sentiment. Poisons one’s every waking thought. Correct me if I’m wrong, Doctor Watson, but last I checked it takes two willing participants for a wedding.”
The last request is mostly directed at John, who nods before narrowing his eyes at the older Holmes again. “Well?”
He turns from his position on the sofa, fingers still steepled together underneath his chin. John, dressed casually. Tomato stain on his sleeve. Cooking, then.
The name sounds familiar, but John can’t quite place it.
John drops the phone as though it had caught fire.
At first, it’s to clear his head. Then, to think. When the fog shrouding his vision clears and he finds himself near Bart’s, the first rays of sunshine emerging from the horizon, he finishes the journey his feet began.
“Norbury didn’t shoot her.”
His destination, the Gideon, is the type of club John imagines Sherlock frequented once upon a time during his cocaine benders, at least based on Greg’s sparse stories. Sleek lines, posh, attractive people, expensive drinks and an atmosphere that makes John’s skin itch. The bouncer is silently judging John even as he lets him enter – Janine or Moran must have told him to – and he tracks down his sister as quickly as possible.
“These don’t have prices.”
– they’re going to upload it on YouTube!”
“The only reason one would steal such an item is to hurt its owner, which requires both knowledge of its worth and motivation to inflict pain. Mr Jones here said he helped out in the kitchens last night, yet a waiter mentioned Jones also helped clear away used dishes. He overheard Janine explaining the necklace to Mr Moran when he observed them at the bar and saw his chance.”
Mycroft’s lips press together in a thin line. His posture is stiff. John recalls what he knows about the other man, thinks back on the smug demeanour during the aftermath of the shooting, and something clicks.
“Oh?”
The video ends with another whimper from Cherise.
“Neel,” John volunteers, watching as the man in question blanches.
“Why can’t I remember her?” Sherlock sounds positively wrecked.
“Not in person, you mean.” John’s tone is off, somehow.
It’s the ringing of his mobile that wakes John. The sun has barely risen but Greg’s number is flashing on his lock screen, meaning he already texted Sherlock but failed to get a reply.
All Sherlock does is hum. John bites his tongue. He doesn’t need to state the obvious. The Sherlock Holmes of a few years ago wouldn’t have been so fast about deducing emotions.
“I don’t give
“I thought we had something!” Neel shouts at Moran, and half a minute later John has to step in to keep the man from adding battery or attempted asphyxiation to the list of charges.
“Well. It’s… it doesn’t matter now. Moriarty is after us. Hardly the time for romance.”
“Oh darling, of course I do,” Mary insists. She sounds sincere to Sherlock’s ears. “I’ve loved you since the first time I saw you.”
John forces an exhale. “Found the tin you brought empty yesterday. Got two cups of tea into him this morning. I think he’s getting better.”
Sherlock is tempted to ignore the question, but after ignoring
“I used to,” Mycroft corrects with a vengeance. “It’s
“IRA.”
“Why,” he repeats, harsher.
Shoulders squared, chin high. Battle stations. “Moriarty helped her escape custody. Moriarty’s alive.”
Anthea merely smirks before taking her leave. John stares after her. Whatever this means, it doesn’t sit well with him. And ignoring the uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach has never served him well.
The woman doesn’t bat an eye at the volume of his voice, or his tone. “This is a delicate situation.”
Photographers and journalists surround the flat like vultures circling a cadaver. The last thing John wants is to walk past them but he must, or else he would miss his appointments with Mary in the maximum security facility.
Seeing as he doesn’t have a key, John circles around the old residential building until he finds a way to sneak in – bribing the cleaning staff may be boring, but it gets him into the staircase he remembers practically carrying Harry up. He is careful to tilt his head away from the surveillance camera in the hallway, pretending the lock picking kit in his breast pocket is actually his keys.
Sherlock’s pulse stutters, a counter-rhythm to the dial tone in his ear.
Sherlock has formulated a reply within a split second, yet his brother’s warning glare makes it clear the question was rhetorical. Sherlock wishes it hadn’t been.
“I’m not deflecting,” John argues, but even to his ears it sounded petulant. He sighs, removing one hand from the steering wheel to rub the bridge of his nose. “We kept in touch after the wedding.”
“Well?”
“Three previous victims, all of different ethnic and social backgrounds, no uniform cause of death, but all missing their hearts,” Sherlock says, pacing through the living room where Gleeson’s cleaning lady found the body. “Eight theories –” he stops abruptly, turning away from the book shelf. “No, seven. I’ll need to see the other victims.”
John walks.
It is already two o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and Q knows better than to argue. He is not going to find any sleep tonight, yet maybe he should try and compose himself outside the agency. Cuddle Zed, do some recreational coding until he feels more at home in his own skin again.
John. John in the doorway, but not in the clothes from that night in CAM tower. A soft smile playing about his lips.
“He’s in a right strop, poor Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson says amidst the clinking of china. “Pleaded with him for ages this morning but he wouldn’t come out.”
In moments like this his army training pays off: John is awake and coherent within seconds.
“I need you to access the Met’s data bases from your laptop.”
The doorbell rings, signalling Greg’s arrival. He’s not alone, though – Molly has arrived along with him. She gives John an awkward wave.
“So the killer is taking revenge?” John interrupts.
“We do?” John echoes, his eyes darting to the crime wall. “What about Miss Peregrine and her –”
John is so relieved he doesn’t register the disgruntled look on Sherlock’s face.
“Redbeard’s death. He wasn’t put down, was he?”
Moriarty fakes a pensive hum. “Is it, though? You think you’re so clever, Gabby. Clever little spy, much too good for all the disgusting wet jobs and low pay. But you’re dull. Boooooring,” he sing-songs. “You think daddy cares about you, don’t you? Sorry to disappoint. Say hello to some old friends, Gabby.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft looks down his nose at him. “An international crime syndicate has several branches, John. Do keep up.”
Chuckling. “You and I remember our first date very differently, then.”
John doesn’t need to think before shaking his head. Being alone with his thoughts wouldn’t end well.
The mystery prompts yet another dive into his mind palace, where memories of his experience during the coma have already been dissected too many times to count. Sherlock has not grown bored in the past few weeks since Pinewood Hill.
Sherlock’s mind lights up with a flurry of ‘what-if’s and ‘if-only’s, all bringing fulfilment to a fantasy that has accompanied Sherlock for quite some time.
John blinks. “Inside your skull?”
“Hiya, John,” Janine says. She looks torn for a moment – John’s seen it before, clients contemplating whether to issue some platitude about condolences or ignore it completely. Janine opts for the latter.
“You know, you could always just read it,” John says, but his dry remark also goes ignored. “Something about three mercenaries. Brothers. Name’s Garrideb – hope that helps. And, well… Mary wants us to have a scan. Find out if it’s a boy or girl.”
A wide grin blooms on Mary’s face then. “It kicked! Come on, darling, feel it!”
A gasp tears through the crowd. Sherlock and John turn as one to locate the source of the panic.
Mycroft’s gaze takes on a dangerous glint all of a sudden, though his voice remains calm. John keeps his shoulders squared, refusing to back down.
Life might have gone on. John might have begun measuring time in cases solved rather than weeks. But as always, the universe has other plans.
Zed is lying on the floor, at the level of the television set between the living room area and the kitchen, pale moonlight falling in through the window and illuminating what the hallway light cannot reach. There is blood. Not much, but enough that in theory the loss of such an amount would suffice to kill a small animal.
“Your agents.”
“Your sister is a brilliant graphic designer, Captain Watson,” Moran says after John shushed Harry’s rant about unskilled waiters who drop champagne flutes in people’s laps and applies bandages from the first-aid kit. “You must be so proud. Is she helping you pay the rent? I own property in Marylebone; I’m aware of the steep prices.”
Q obeys, though he does not have to lie when he informs M that there genuinely is no trace of any external influence.
Then he sees it.
“Janine and Moriarty shared a foster family in Ireland, John. My sister’s final mission brought her into contact with the IRA. I’m unclear on the exact timeline of Jim’s criminal activity or when he began dealing with terrorists after his move to Britain, yet the evidence suggests the files Eurus and Mycroft retrieved derailed whatever scheme he had concocted.”
as reference for the medical details on Sherlock’s wound. John’s Freddie Mercury poster was inspired by totheverybestoftimes’s headcanon, seen
“Is Miss Hawkins still there?”
To make matters worse, red dots appear on all their bodies. The simultaneous threat to Sherlock and his unborn child threatens to rip John apart.
“How is my brother?”
Sherlock knows Molly is going to send him away the second he lays eyes on her. Even Rosie, propped up on her hip, isn’t looking at him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “It was bought recently. Old money, most likely. Obviously it belongs to one of your army mates – military influence blatant in the security measures – but you barely talk about your tours, John, and if you do you use these obnoxious nicknames. I lack sufficient data to tell if this is
“I’m not good at this stuff, Sherlock, so I’m going to read you something,” he announces.
He never gets to make his move. The red dots vanish just as the large double door of the factory hall splinters off its hatches.
John approaches tentatively, inching closer and expecting a fuss, but he manages to take Sherlock’s pulse without a problem. It’s racing and his skin is clammy. At least his pupils are reactive. Regardless of what else is going on, John reasons, Sherlock is definitely dehydrated.
James nods, slowly pulling his hand back towards him. “I’m going to look for something nice. Stay here for as long as you need.”
“She’s so wicked, Dr Watson. I can really see why you like her.”
He finds her, along with Janine and Moran, in the manager’s office. All have dressed to impress: Janine chose a bold green dress, Moran opted for just shirt and waistcoat hugging his muscular frame, and Harry donned a pair of trousers that might as well have been painted on. They would have driven their father mental.
“Hm.” Sholto, again.
He never deleted the building’s layout, so it’s barely any challenge to plan a route that won’t leave them too vulnerable to surprise attacks as well as take them to the rooms most likely to be used for hostages first. John follows his lead without hesitation or question, causing something warm to unfurl inside Sherlock’s chest.
, a voice in his head murmurs, but he ignores the renewed flare of worry. Maybe Mrs Hudson will get through to Sherlock today.
case, Holmes!”
“I can explain, love, just,” a gasp, tears in her eyes, “let me up. My hand, it needs –”
“You. Telling me he’s gone.”
“You said you hadn’t seen him in years.”
Sherlock’s eyes are drawn to where they are always drawn: John. Who, at the moment, is slumped in a chair right next to the hospital bed.
“Why would she be involved?” Sherlock scoffs. “Don’t you think I would have noticed if she were under Moriarty’s thumb? It’s not exactly a trivial detail, like the date George went on last night. She’s a great kisser. Or at least he thinks so. Please choose something more riveting for date number two than ‘dinner and a film,” he adds in disgust. “How dull. Take her to the torture museum; she’d enjoy –”
“Hello,” John greets. His smile feels fake even to him. “What can we help you with?”
“What does that tell you, Sherlock?”
John just hopes this is as good a development as he thinks it is.
Beta'd and Brit-picked by the wonderful
“Where is she now?”
“Why help her escape only to pull the rug right from under her like that? Why unmask her in front of the entire world, it doesn’t make any sense…”
“I had to handle one hostile,” Mycroft continues. The barest hint of trembling is seeping into his voice. “One. I had a clear shot and…”
“The science of combustion,” Sherlock mutters.
“A minor position,” Mycroft repeats, now clearly annoyed. “I’m not privy to each and every thread in the global web of criminal masterminds.”
Janine still looks worried, but eventually she defers to his judgement.
Medical staff descend on them then, and the inkling slips away between Sherlock’s fingers.
“Well, I shaved it, didn’t I.”
“It’s quite alright.”
… but the message is gibberish.
John looks up to Donovan, fighting his embarrassment. “Sorry about that.”
“Doctor Watson, if you truly care about my brother as deeply as I suspect you do, you will not mention what just transpired to anyone, ever. You will not investigate any suspicions you might have. You will keep it to yourself until such a moment in time that the truth of the matter becomes evident. Do I have your word?”
“The factory hall,” Sherlock concludes.
He should probably feel insulted, but John’s mind latches onto the metaphor instead.
A resigned sigh. John can tell she wants to tell him to toss off, but she doesn’t. “I’ll check if anyone brought her in.”
After shouting, he tries banging on the door.
It’s amazing how one syllable can convey so much joy and grief.
“Well?” John prompts, and the moment shatters. “Enlighten me.”
John’s protests die on his tongue. Something has shifted in the air between them. Mycroft looks… dejected, almost. Pained.
“She’s in custody?”
“You wouldn’t have met Sherlock Holmes.”
Her other hand is holding the gun. Sherlock exchanges an apprehensive glance with John.
“I’m disappointed, Sherlock.” Moriarty sighs in exaggerated desolation. “You were so slow. But you can still grow… Rise to the occasion… That was only task one. Tell my fans I said hi,” he adds in a happier tone, before hanging up.
He whirls around. Mycroft is standing two metres away from him, half in shadow. They are on a bus. There is no one in the driver’s seat.
“It’s what he wants, isn’t it? That’s why all these rotten public areas. He’s stirring up a panic.”
“Chess,” he spits. “That’s what you meant, hm? Playing chess with Moriarty?”
John ignores him. He doesn’t tell him about the joint account, set up years ago when they first started taking payment, doesn’t mention Sherlock never concerns himself with finances and contends himself with giving John free reign.
Frontal assault. Even with his eyes on the road John catches Sherlock’s flinch.
“Brussels?” John echoes. There was something on the telly earlier. “At that summit? But that ended –”
Like Sherlock and cocaine, John’s relationship with alcohol is one of a mere practical nature, thus this turn of events is hardly surprising nor does Sherlock deem it worthy of worry.
No reaction.
“You’re still running.”
Catalyst Hall is a mere shadow of itself. Especially underneath the overcast sky the three-storey building lacks any of its former appeal.
He stops the thought in its tracks. Chasing down ‘what-if’s and ‘could-have’s will not bring Beth back, will not change the fact that Sherlock cared more for Mary than he did for John, that Sherlock murdered someone for Mary when John shot a bloody cabby the first night they –
“Outside help. MI5 is investigating.”
“You can’t,” Mary says. “No one can.”
The hammer clicks as Janine holds the gun to Sherlock's head.
- EMP-related thoughts by shadowfax044,
“I see you are unsurprised I kept tabs on you.”
Great, it’s their target. And she’s holding a knife to a younger man. If asked, however, John couldn’t pinpoint who looks more scared by the turn of events.
Pain flaring beneath Sherlock’s scarred skin.
Opening the door reveals Mycroft, umbrella in hand.
“He’s currently in Brussels.”
“How…”
“Why’s he so obsessed with Sherlock then?” John could answer the question for himself, but projecting one’s feelings onto a criminal genius might not be the best thing to do, he reckons.
And fyi, this verse differs hugely from canon when it comes to the Holmes sister. You’ll be the judge of which version you prefer :)
“Moriarty.”
“Why?”
right now,” John barks, much to Mrs Hudson’s dismay. Sherlock doesn’t seem to hear him, which only adds another layer of urgency to the situation. “His brother’s been… I’m not sure, given something, and I need supplies at Baker Street right this very second.”
He is under no illusion that Mycroft could have him whisked off if he continues to refuse. Every second that trickles by is keeping John from Sherlock.
He almost complies.
That earns a laugh. “Oh, Captain Watson. No threat or amount of pain could make the Napoleon of Blackmail give up so much as a recipe for biscuits. We will have to offer something of equal value.”
“I have an update on your wife,” Mycroft announces afterwards. “While she will regain full range of motion in her knee, she will never move her thumb again. She also refuses to talk.”
The implications of Magnussen’s words register, but it’s like looking through tainted glass – he gets only an impression. John stares at whom he thought is the person he will spend the rest of his life with, and what he sees doesn’t make sense.
“Focus,” John cuts in. “My sister is missing and I had to spend an hour counteracting the psychedelics in your system. Now you’re going to pull yourself together and help me find her.”
John takes a minute to process this. Once the implications hit him, he can’t help but laugh.
“I needed to examine you,” John explains, making Lestrade’s eyebrows rise. “And it’s Harry. Turns out the fourth Musketeer in her new group of friends is Moriarty. The others are Janine and Sebastian Moran, by the way.”
She pauses with her hand on the doorknob. “We’re going for drinks this Thursday,” she says. “Would you like to join us?”
“I’m here,” the agent says, lifting a hand, palm up, and slowly placing it around Q’s shoulders.
“How did you find us?” John asks, not looking at Sherlock because he doesn’t trust his facial muscles just yet.
“Fine. Go home, Q. Rest. Be back later.”
“But you did?” Sherlock challenges, eyes narrowed.
John almost jerks back. “What? Now? But –”
Sherlock expected as much; after all, he can still feel John’s grip on his shoulder, saving him from the ricochet of at least two bullets instead of protecting his wife, yet he opts not to dwell on it too long since his heart always gives a pathetic flutter at the memory.
“Why don’t I show you to the guest rooms?” Sholto interrupts. “The beds have yet to be made up but the bathrooms on the floor are fully functional.”
“Bloody hell – I confirmed his return. There were sodding
“It’s our nicknames,” Harry rasps. Then, to her brother, “You said he’s smart.”
Sherlock releases an audible breath. He’s preparing for a deduction, John realises with a flash of panic. He needs a distraction.
“I’m not a bloody invalid,” Q snaps, finally meeting James’ eyes. He regrets his outburst immediately when he sees the mellow expression on James’ face, which does not change one bit as he waits for Q to take a deep breath and mutter an apology.
“I don’t have to ignore the reporters,” John threatens.
“That’s what you said,” John goes on. “Remember?”
Rage so primal it blinds him for a moment flares in John’s chest.
“She might have tried if you’d had those connections. Mycroft has done far worse in his time.”
“Then what –”
“Oh Lord…” Mrs Hudson moves into the room, gasping when she sees Sherlock. “Oh my, is he all right?”
The sight of Mary turning on the floor, clad in what looks like black Velcro, ripping off her beanie and gazing up at him with pleading eyes, is the most surreal thing that has ever happened to him. There are several minutes left before the ambulance will arrive at the Tower. Time for answers.
“Do you realise how hypocritical it was, criticising everybody’s memes and whatnot, by means of the very medium they are employing as well? Your words could have carried meaning, John –”
Moriarty has reached John by then, whose body is coiled tight, like a predator waiting for his chance to strike. For now, however, he can only stand there as Jim puts an arm around his shoulder, pulling him close. Sherlock envies his composure, how he remains unflinching at the touch.
They both glance at Sherlock, who feigns surprise and sneers. “Oh, so I do get a say.”
Mary swallows. “It didn’t even take a month and you were running off to storm a drug den with a tire iron. You’re best friends with a sociopath. You’re a doctor who never came back from the war.”
Sherlock is still looking at him imploringly when he stops laughing. The baroque house towers above them in the moonlight with only three of the twenty-one front windows lit up. John licks his lips as they wind their way up the small hill.
“Water under the bridge. Where was the necklace seen last?”
“Eurus.”
“More than once, it appears.”
“You can’t keep that up forever.”
“I’m still armed,” he growls, then rolls to his feet.
For some reason, Sherlock smirks back. “He made me wear the hat? He always carries handcuffs?”
“Why would she wait out there in the open?”
“Who’s missing?” Sherlock asks, sitting up on top of the duvet. “Apart from my dressing gown?”
A song Sherlock doesn’t know starts playing and Moriarty sways his hips to the beat for a moment before executing a spin and sighing in joyous relief. “Oh, it’s good to be back!”
Janine laughs at John’s joke. “As long as he gets me out of these, he can be as modest as he wants.”
“I’ll fetch my gun, shall I?” John suggests, and puts the meat he intended to cook back into the fridge.
Before John can ask what he means, however, footsteps and the sound of a stretcher announce the arrival of the paramedics.
Sherlock’s reply is barely a whisper. “I – I do.”
John gives him a dark look, then returns his attention to Sherlock. The heart monitor is beeping steadily, a soothing rhythm that assures John there is still hope.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade warns, but falls silent at a look.
Mycroft remains unimpressed. “I’m exploring every option.” A weary sigh. “There’s an east wind coming, Doctor Watson. We must be vigilant.”
Sherlock swallows, eyes flicking from Mary to his friend. John obviously doesn’t understand.
The wet gleam of Mary’s eyes spur Sherlock into action. The faster they resolve this and stop being sitting ducks in the open space, the better.
“Sherlock!” John calls. “Open up! I’m not doing this for a bloody giggle, it’s an emergency!”
As expected, Mycroft is not amused. That John is chuckling at his own joke in the middle of the man’s sitting room might not be helping matters.
“It’s an expression.” John rolls his eyes.
The ambiguity of the statement is certainly not lost on his brother, whose mask cracks, showing a hint of worry – though it’s Sherlock who should be concerned without being able to pinpoint why. There is something gnawing at his mind, an echo from the depth of the galanty show his neurons conjured up for him during his coma.
Hooray, the name-giving chapter :) It also holds my favourite scene so far. Enjoy!
Silence descends. Then Sholto murmurs, “Do you ever wonder… what might have been?”
Sherlock succumbs to curiosity, but the sight of a damp John in his ugly dressing gown quickly becomes white noise in contrast to the horrified expression on the man’s face.
Sherlock’s heart rate spikes.
“Want help cleaning them?” John offers.
It’s Spooks.
“I have a case for you.”
Mycroft’s lips have formed a thin line that doesn’t seem inclined to move any time soon while anger is loosening John’s tongue.
“How?” Sherlock stammers.
Then there is silence.
“Cor, bint,” John answers, if only for old time’s sake. Somehow they never outgrew their nicknames. “Thank you for this,” he tells Donovan.
“It?”
Among the hundreds of missed calls, emails, texts and notifications, the very last one stands out: a picture, taken in a darkened room. Janine, tied to a chair with thick rope, squeezing her eyes shut as Moriarty kisses her temple, one hand curled around her neck.
“She seems to be Mycroft’s age.”
“Don’t get smart with me, Mycroft,” John snaps. “This is your fault.”
“Oh, I was wondering when you’d speak up,” Sherlock sneers. “Throat closing up with sentiment? I think not, judging by the thread count.”
“Is Moriarty staging all this? Or just capitalising on some deranged sod?” he wonders on the cab ride back.
“Then get on with it.”
There is no landing, just the sensation of rough sheets – low thread count, standard-issue hospital supplies, Mycroft didn’t even spring for an upgrade – against his back. The steady beat of monitoring equipment, the smell of antiseptic and… something else.
“We’ll find her,” John promises. “Let’s get you out of these first.”
“Your wife, sir.”
“Shame. Here I was hoping we could toast your wife’s escape and plait each other’s hair over cake.”
John’s left hand is fascinating.
“Now she’s a fugitive.”
“Oh, don’t apologise,” Sherlock taunts. “Needs must, Inspector, when you have a newly identified serial killer on the loose.”
Sherlock clears his throat. “How did she die?”
John breathes in deeply to calm his racing pulse.
Curiosity wins out. John complies after signalling the guard outside the door and is rewarded with a strong kick from his child.
“Call an ambulance!” he bellows at Magnussen. “Tell them there’s a GSW to the chest, three additional wounded, the shooter among them.”
John gives him a flat look.
They inspect the room and the boudoir Janine mentioned, then go on to question all members of the staff in attendance the previous night in a room apparently intended for meetings in the West wing of the house. John doesn’t feel quite as uncomfortable as he did in Buckingham Palace, yet he finds himself on the receiving end of quite a few condescending sneers from Moran regardless. Sherlock obviously doesn’t need him at the moment, so he wanders off on his own.
“Nothing.” Sherlock shakes his head, coughing. John immediately hands him the glass from the bedside table. “All right, I’ll need a cork board, white board, any board will do, and all you have on the woman who calls herself Mary –”
“To solve it,” John replies.
James offers the box to him, though Q hesitates. He doubts he will be able to place Zed’s body inside without shedding any tears and as much as he and James have fallen into this… this thing, he doesn’t need 007 to see him cry over a pet.
“Oh, and I bet Moriarty just loved selecting the rope,” Sherlock spits.
“And here I was looking forward to kip on silk bed sheets,” John comments, making Sherlock huff as they make to leave the kitchen in favour of the armoury.
[07:15 AM] finalproblem.me. Let’s bring you some relief ;)
John shoves it aside, pulls the handle – locked. His veins feel like they’re on fire.
Now he definitely owes her a pint.
Sherlock once offered to teach him, only to blink owlishly when John revealed he had long since mastered that particular skill.
“Oh, no, it’s a horrible idea,” John agrees. “But…” He clears his throat. “She’s my sister.”
John keeps his head bowed until the burning sensation is gone from his eyes, then straightens his back and squares his shoulders. He meets Sherlock’s eyes and sees the same iron-hard resolve reflected back at him.
It’s just that, though – a fantasy. An illusion that shatters as soon as John opens his eyes in the real 221B.
Sherlock already has his hands raised and eyes closed, clearly trying to solve it in his mind. John’s lips twitch when he sees Mycroft’s smirk, even though he should probably snap at the older Holmes that now isn’t the time to hold some childish competition.
“I know a place. We’ll be safe there for a bit.”
After that, it’s chaos.
Apparently Mrs Hudson has been making tea for the journalists camped out in front of 221B since yesterday, so John reluctantly goes back to the suburbs where every item reminds him of Mary. He opens a bottle of whiskey that Mike sent along for the wedding and drinks it in the dark hallway until he reckons he might give sleep a try and win.
Excited to hear what you think of this chapter! =)
“It’s not a trick,” is as far as John gets before none other than Mycroft Holmes descends on them, pushing into the living room like a storm cloud.
“Of course, I didn’t, John. I would have stepped in otherwise.”
Their gazes hold for a few long seconds.
He complies after a beat. Sherlock hopes his eyes convey the ‘It’s fine’ he is trying to project even as his mind is galloping on three roads simultaneously. Janine? It doesn’t make sense.
?” It’s more of a snarl than anything, but Mary doesn’t so much as flinch. Then, in a voice so eerily calm it both thrills and shocks Sherlock, John concludes, “You never left his service.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Moriarty quips. “I watched you, Sherlock. Got my eyes on you. You’re ready now.”
“You’re too slow, John,” Jim teases, tilting his head. Another minuscule movement and his lips will brush over John's skin.
They force John to go home before MI5 leaks the identity of the fake shooter.
The line of Sherlock’s shoulders tenses, almost as if he is preparing for battle. “It’s me Moriarty’s after.”
This chapter gave me very heavy Mycroft feels. And Sherlock feels. And John feels. Just… warning for feels, folks. :)
“Please, John, say something.”
John nods. “Intent?”
“And find my phone!” Sherlock calls after them just before the door shuts.
Sherlock stares. “You detest legwork.”
John glares, clenching his hands into fists.
Sherlock stops with his hand on the door knob to aim a smirk at the other man. John’s tone had an impressed tinge. Sherlock clings to it through the onslaught of memories that assaults him the moment he crosses over the threshold.
“James Moriarty once told his network that my brother was in possession of an incredible weapon – a key that would unlock every door. It was nothing but conjecture, of course, but Moriarty enjoyed watching the chaos he caused.”
“We know Moriarty gave you up,” he tells her. “Painted a target on your back.”
Whatever production Moriarty staged, it has already drawn a crowd before the police managed to close down the station. Dimmock earns his right to exist by parting the masses when they hurry down the stairs off King William Street into Monument Station, John covering his six by silent agreement.
“Redbeard?” John prompts. “Your…?”
No such luck.
The man blinks awake, seemingly disoriented. The confusion vanishes a moment later when Sherlock’s state registers, giving way to surprise and then something Sherlock can only describe as relief.
He averts his gaze. “It was for a case.”
John uncrosses his arms and gives a curt nod without a moment’s hesitation. Mycroft Holmes mirrors the nod, then leaves. John watches with a sinking feeling in his stomach.
“He’s dead,” John says. “Blew his brains out.”
“Mary was working for Moriarty, you bloody drama queen.”
“Prick,” John says but there is no heat behind it. The grin isn’t helping either. “You know what I mean.”
He reads the talking points. Tries to imagine himself sitting in a chair surrounded by studio lights with a lapel mic underneath his jumper, explaining that yes, his wife turned out to be an assassin and that no, she’s not a threat anymore.
Sholto doesn’t miss a beat, narrowing his eyes. “Moriarty?”
The detective remains silent, which does nothing to soothe the turmoil of anger and confusion in John’s head.
“Harry?! Harry is in London?”
This time, though, is different. He doesn’t wish for Sherlock to come back to him, he just wants to never see him again.
“I shot my wife,” John says. “But that was… That was different.” He shifts forward, leaning in. His voice drops to a whisper. “But I keep replaying it in my mind… if I’d known… what then? And…” John swallows. There’s a lump in his throat. “I’d do it again. I just wished I’d been there sooner. Three seconds. That would’ve been enough and you wouldn’t… You made a vow, too, you know.”
John squeezes his eyes shut. He wants to kick something but he can’t take his hand off the wound, can’t remove the one lifeline he still has left.
There is a faceless woman following Sherlock about like a shadow. Try as he might, she remains outside his reach, her blue dress slipping between his fingers. He feels like he used to know her. He used to know many things but now, surrounded by his crumbling palace, he can’t even remember the way out.
He has never seen Mycroft Holmes look this bewildered.
He clearly doesn’t expect them to explode into movement at the slightest nod of Sherlock’s head, but that's exactly what they do: John ducks to evade the sniper and barrels into Moriarty’s lower abdomen, Sherlock pulls Janine towards him by her gun arm, one knee coming up to punch the air out of her lungs.
“You’re making tea. So the world really is ending,” John rasps. The joke falls flat – Sherlock isn’t listening.
Mycroft lets out a soft breath, barely audible even in the silent room. “If you decide, there is an SIS officer stationed outside your room. Simply inform him and it shall be arranged.”
“But you’ve got seven; all right, let’s see if I can get this – hang on.” John narrows his eyes at their surroundings. “What are we doing at Bart’s?”
“Then what am I supposed to tell the Prime Minister?” M snaps, beginning to lose his usually so unshakable temper.
The action seems to have stunned Sherlock into speechlessness.
John’s right shoulder is already colliding with the door. Mrs Hudson gasps, horrified, but John doesn’t pay her any heed. The material around the lock gives out at the third assault and John crashes into Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Anything out of the ordinary?”
“Sherlock,” John calls from somewhere – hallway. Freshly showered. The temptation to turn and catch a sliver of exposed skin is enticing. Sherlock almost yields to the distraction.
“Time to wake up, Sherlock. We’ve got work to do.”
“Listen, Anthea, or whatever the hell your name is,” John snaps. “My best friend’s just been shot – your employer's brother – and what I need is to go to hospital.”
John had the good grace to look slightly less angry at that.
Lips quirked just slightly higher but his head didn’t move. “Hmm?”
Never looking away from John’s beautiful dark blue eyes, Sherlock licked his upper lip then raised the straw to his tongue. He rested the tip of his tongue at the tip of the straw for one, two, three seconds. Just rested it there, looking at John with a small, knowing smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, I mean...it’s too…,” Sherlock’s was staring down at John’s cock. He breathed out quietly, like a prayer, “It’s seventeen inches long and twenty inches around.”
“Sit.”
Months later, Moriarty came back but it wasn’t him, of course, it was Janine. Janine and Mary had worked together for years. There was no baby. Mary disappeared. But Mary had truly loved John. That was true. Was that a surprise to anyone? It's very hard not to love John Watson.
Sherlock was baffled.
His body jostled and swayed with the bumps on the highway, they were travelling at a high rate of speed. He blinked and blinked, trying to clear his vision. When his eyes were briefly open, he only saw blurry images of the back seat of a large luxury sedan. He was on the floor, hands still tied behind his back. Mercifully, his legs were unbound.
He felt John thrust in one last time, burying himself deep into Sherlock. He let out a long keening cry through gritted teeth as he came into Sherlock’s body. He could feel John’s cock pulse and jump within him, which was glorious, lovely, amazing. He pulled John down on top of him so their chests met.
for posting this challenge for September. Thanks everyone for your kudos and comments, I hoard every one.
“I had to stop, I’m close. I don't want to bite you,” Sherlock panted.
John mumbled unhappily, something about “early” and “my cock.”
“Or not…” John said softly, turning to pour the glasses. He was confused. Sherlock had been the one to invite himself over and now he seemed deeply suspicious. Possibly he was paranoid from the cocaine? Although, to John, he didn’t seem high anymore. He looked dead tired. And too thin. John pulled up the mobile app that allowed him to order local delivery and placed an order from his favourite Chinese.
Sherlock sniffed and frowned a bit, “I suppose. I like looking at you, wobbling about.”
Sherlock interrupted his awkward rambling, “Cocaine is my preference. I have strong cravings for it, now and always. I don’t think my experience over the last few days has made that worse.”
“I’m an idiot. It’s too soon, I’m sorry. Forget I said that,” he said as he scrubbed his hands over his face. “We can talk about it later, or in a year...or never,” he rambled, feeling more miserable as he realized what he had done.
“I'm pleased to see you too.” He cleared his throat and looked down at his shoes. When they looked back at each other, Greg saw the look on Mycroft’s face and inhaled sharply. He looked nervous and a bit sad, but also hopeful.
Slowly Sherlock leaned back and while John was still mostly hard inside of him he said, “John Watson. I adore you” and tried kissing him but John’s smile was too wide.
His genius had only gotten him so far. People were on the verge of telling him to piss off permanently before he’d met John. Lestrade only put up with him because his tiny little brain couldn’t solve even the simplest case, and with a support team that included Anderson, how could he? Molly put up with him because she wanted to date him or fuck him. He never could understand that. As if it would ever, ever happen with her. He respected Molly but he would never, could never. He was only ever attracted to one person in his entire life. He wanted John from the moment they met, and wanted him all of the time now that he was finally allowed to touch. He felt it like an itch under his skin and a quiver in his groin that could be tamed temporarily if necessary, but would always return. It had been years, and he wasn’t bored, and hadn’t found John any less attractive. In fact, he felt more possessive and more needy than ever.
“Ignore it? No,” Sherlock said firmly, a bit too loud, and turned towards John and glared at him.
John interrupted him and said, “Yes. Of course. When?”
I took up with some old notes from the early days of London’s police force. In the case that I had dug up they missed every clue, of course. The Bow Street Runners were more interested in serving warrants and collecting fees through the magistrate than they were in actually solving crimes. I begrudgingly accepted that today’s Scotland Yard was better. They should be after almost 260 years!
“Um...it’s a bit late.”
“I made you some broth and tea. It’s past time for your pills too.”
“Yes, what’s it for?”
“I know. I can see,” Sherlock said, smiling. Sherlock felt nothing more than brotherly exasperation as they sat down on the lawn.
Before I met Sherlock, I was not a man. I was a broken, distraught, exceedingly lonely ghost moving through life half-awake. He has shown me how to love and be loved.
on Tumblr, please come by and say hello.
“John, you’re fidgeting.”
The man himself was lying on the sofa with his hands steepled under his chin. It was a pose that John desperately missed when he’d been dead. Looking at him now, he smiled at how very Sherlock it was.
He heard John walk down the hall to the bathroom and quietly close the door.
“Why are we doing this?”
Sherlock desperately hoped it was true. From what he could deduce, John was cautiously accepting his apology with the grace that partners in long-term love affairs knew well.
“I heard you were looking for work. Can you come to New York?”
“All right.”
Sherlock could see the mischievous glint back in John’s eyes, and thought there was a slightly smug quirk to his lips.
He stood. “Ms. Morstan. I didn’t know you would be joining us.” That was true. He thought maybe she’d be watching remotely but he never thought she would actually show herself at the scene of the crime to be.
Sherlock felt his cock stiffen, his skin growing impossibly tighter, as his orgasm ripped through him. It started at the base of his spine and lit up his prostate and cock. It radiated up to tense his abdominal muscles in violent spasms. He shot all over John's chest and up under his chin.
, Sherlock thought. He’d seen John jealous before, when that completely ridiculous Bradstreet clapped her hands excitedly and kissed his cheeks after he’d helped her with a mind-numbingly boring case. Really, she was more idiotic than most of them. The evidence was right under her too-tiny, professionally sculpted nose. John had not seen the absurdity and futility of her actions, as apparently Detective Bradstreet is “bloody stacked” with a reputation for “getting a leg over with every warm body at Scotland bloody Yard.” Well, Sherlock didn’t know about all of that. He was not responsible for the behaviour of others, especially ‘fucking’ McGregor.
John stilled and narrowed his eyes. He didn’t know what he expected. He supposed she might be frightened or hurt or...contrite? But not this Mary. He had to remember this was not the woman he’d fallen in love with when he was just a kid. He didn’t know what she was now, but he suspected she was a criminal sociopath.
It was chaos. Lights flashing from four - no five - different police cars. The faces around him were either grim or contorted and shouting.
Sherlock was busy pouring drinks and flirting, obviously gathering information. He angled his head, revealing his throat. He threw his head back to laugh, touched himself constantly. He even leaned forward and winked at a few people.
“I don’t understand why.”
John raised his eyebrows,
Silence. The kind of silence that indicated that all of the other microphones were off.
“I deduced that you were attracted to me when we first met, but then it seemed like you got to know me better and decided that I wasn’t worthy of your attention in that way.”
His cheekbones jutted from his face, his lips were impossibly full and pink, and his eyes...what?...his eyes were too light for a man with such dark curls. He never stopped moving, swishing his coat about, fingers fidgeting, rapidly blinking as he took in the space.
“Do you have a boyfriend, then?”
Duncan smiled and they shared a couple of air kisses. He turned to the other men, and said, “You remember Orkun, and this is Seb.”
Sherlock turned in John’s arms and rested his head on the pillow facing John. John hadn’t opened his eyes but he was smiling a self-satisfied little grin.
“Temporarily missing,” Greg amended, “We’ll find him and we’ll find him soon.”
He knew what it was. He recognized the colors in the background. Black, dark black, with yellow sunlight highlighting dark curls. From their first photo shoot together. He wondered why John had it. He wondered if it was a forgotten proof stuffed into the side pocket of his work bag. He pretended he wasn’t staring at it from his bedroom doorway.
The small room would be a private area for Sherlock to get ready for the shoot and change clothes.
Sherlock knew what she was doing. As she tried to find out if he had anyone close to him, anyone who would miss him, he tried to project an image of a detached, beautiful loner. It wasn’t difficult.
John scoffed. Sherlock didn’t do apologies.
“Oi,” John grunted, but there was absolutely no heat in the statement, “It’s not ‘cute’. It’s your freakishly large hands. They make everything look smaller.”
Light was streaming in from the kitchen and there was soft clanking of pottery and cutlery.
It was one of a handful of times Sherlock had ever said those words to John, or in front of John, for that matter. The words felt foreign coming out of his mouth, and he was slightly surprised to note that he actually felt remorse. He wasn’t just saying it because that’s what he was supposed to do. John made him want to do better.
And wasn’t that the saddest, most heart-rending thing he’d ever heard?
“A bit,” Sherlock said facing away again.
Sherlock decided he liked this dominant John and submitted.
The woman’s eyes went wide and she gasped in shock. Tough-Guy’s whole face turned red and he said loudly, “I...I...do...not...I do not!” To his girlfriend, he said, ”Baby, I don’t. That’s not why...”
Sherlock looked at the shoes and could never, ever picture John wearing them. At least never again.
John was used to Sherlock changing his mind without warning. They stood up, Sherlock settled the bill, which was deeply discounted, and they left. Outside of the restaurant, Sherlock said, “You’re still hungry.”
“You’re looking at me now.”
John moves his hand to his own cock, lightly gripping the head, quickly stroking only a few times and then his cock is jumping. He’s coming again, this time shooting onto Sherlock’s flat quivering stomach. Sherlock thrusts up a few more times, milking his own orgasm and trying to prolong John’s. John collapses down onto his chest, arms splayed out to each side.
Three men exited the car all at once. The driver, a large man clearly hired because of his size, approached Mary first. She smiled hugely, and exclaimed, “Duncan! So fabulous to see you again.”
Sherlock didn’t answer this time, he just narrowed his eyes at John.
“So do you, you’re gorgeous.”
*When John watched Sherlock jump off of the edge of a building. They were chasing a suspect, who had led them onto a rooftop of a four-storey building near Brick Lane. Just as John jumped the small wall between buildings to reach Sherlock, who was wrestling with the much larger man, he saw him fall off the building’s ledge, Belstaff fluttering against the starry sky.
“I know you love it. I can tell by the little hitch of breath you take before you roll your eyes.”
It was during that time that Jack went missing.
Sherlock didn't need earphones to hear music. He was probably playing a whole symphony in his head for his own enjoyment. The dancing was proof he was enjoying it very much.
Eyes still shut, he awoke around 9 am judging from the sounds filtering up from Baker Street.
At John’s wedding he was so jealous. He was so obviously manipulated and teased by A.G.R.A. She loved to watch him squirm. Even at the time, he understood what she was doing and how much she enthusiastically enjoyed hurting him. Unfortunately, that knowledge didn’t stop the pain. He felt jealous, left out, and utterly confused.
He turned to John, looking worried. Seb was already in the car and his colleagues were standing next to the car discussing something but they seemed to be in agreement. They were about to get into the car and drive away. Graham was already in the building. John grabbed Greg by the wrist and said lamely, “They’re leaving.”
He stared at it for a long moment before deciding that it was not too harsh. Hell, it probably wasn’t harsh enough. Sherlock had snuck out in the middle of the night!
“Chemistry. Graduate chemistry, actually.”
“I want to go there.”
“Mmmm,” was the only response John could give.
Mycroft’s voice brings him back to harsh reality. “Mrs Watson is en route to a secure holding facility near London. The baby is perfectly fine, yet I’m afraid the extension of visitation rights will have to wait.”
Their entourage consists of eleven of New Scotland Yard’s finest – and Donovan, for reasons that currently elude Sherlock – as well as five of Mycroft’s Suits With Guns. The closer they get to the fence warding off the modest garden in front of Catalyst Hall, the more Sherlock’s skin tingles. The
Mycroft clears his throat. “Twin sister. My twin.”
The speaker, a bland woman with a tough edge to her, is wearing a suit that costs more than John’s entire wardrobe. She looks incredibly out of place in the cafeteria of St Bart’s, where John has been ordered to go instead of pacing in front of Sherlock’s room for the better part of the next hour.
It’s not until the older Holmes is almost at the front door that John’s body remembers what it’s supposed to do.
“Your brother knows more than he’s letting on, that pillock. He’s not sharing. Not now. I’m sure he knows where Mary is, what she’s doing, why…” John laughs, but it’s humourless. “Moriarty. James fucking Moriarty.”
“Oh – no, uh… It looks good.”
“Really? I rather thought the moral is that he’s unpredictable, dear brother,” Sherlock quips, emerging from the A&E bloke’s care. “I’m surprised none of us got whiplash.”
’s house or
John’s reply has to be non-verbal for Sherlock doesn’t even hear a murmur. His own tongue is in knots; his throat tight.
He places his left hand on Sherlock’s shoulder (for medical reasons) while he dials Mycroft’s number with his right. It’s Anthea who answers.
“As long as he won’t retaliate today; it’s not just you braving the photographers, you know,” John grumbles, almost hoping it was too low for Sherlock to hear.
Gottle o’ geer. John used to hear it in his nightmares – it’s one of the things Moriarty made him say while he was wearing semtex at the pool. Sherlock referencing it… He’s just reading off a script. He’s not defenceless. Miss Aldridge probably forgot about the bullet in the cartridge.
John doesn’t need to go on for Sherlock’s mind to fill in what happened after that: the blood pushed the pericardium beyond its capacity and started pressing on the heart, which stopped. Cardiac tamponade. No pulse.
“Of course.”
“Would you like to see her?”
“Thank you, Sherl,” she whispers close to his ear. Sherlock can hear John clearing his throat, which proves a fatal distraction because the next thing he registers is his gun being pulled from its holster.
“No need,” John manages through gritted teeth.
John says nothing. Rage is boiling right underneath the surface of his skin, one spark away from erupting. It is a sight to behold.
John, too late at the aquarium, because of Rosie.
“Won’t matter – Magnussen must have received his information on Mary somehow. If he’s in league with Moriarty, as I am fairly certain he is, he’ll be able to disprove any of the tales your pretending-to-be-secret Service is capable of spinning.”
Sherlock stops abruptly. John takes a pre-emptive deep breath.
Beside him, the woman relaxes a fraction. “You can come out now!”
“Eleven, technically, seeing as we are already on the second,” Sherlock corrects. “We need to get to Reading Gaol. I already texted Lestrade, he will arrest your serial killer before she strikes again.”
PS: I'd love to supply the memes etc. I mentioned in this chapter, but I don't art or photoshop very well.
“But not untrue.”
Sherlock snorts. “Chess would require him to have a modicum of control.”
“Screw logic, Sherlock,” he snaps. “Last time you faced him down alone you jumped off a bloody roof. Not another suicide mission, not on my watch.”
They reach the outskirts of Twickenham, dispose of their mobiles and find an inconspicuous car to steal. When John takes the driver’s seat with determination, Sherlock arches a quizzical eyebrow.
John, an army doctor, not providing first aid to his dying wife.
The young man, Neel Jones, says he helped out in the kitchen during the celebration and went to bed right after. His alibi is weak but John can’t find a motif.
John’s eyes flicker up to meet Anthea’s. “Mycroft’s way of telling me to sod off?”
“You do,” is John’s response, firm and sincere.
Sherlock fits right into the splendour of the entrance hall. John tugs at the hem of his three-year-old shirt and pulls his hands behind his back to hide the threadbare cuffs of his jacket.
“A bit not good,” John confirms.
The sound of slowing tires makes his head snap up.
“Always been my ambition.”
“You said the same thing about me.”
“You’ll see.”
John wants to punch it off his daft face.
“It’s, uh, it’s from John.”
Moran raises his hands but his smile doesn’t waver. “I wasn’t implying anything untoward.”
John startles, is next to the bed a second later, but there is no further reaction from his best friend. When it dawns on him that he’s been an idiot – there is conclusive evidence that talking to coma patients affects them in a positive manner – he almost kicks the bed.
“Who was right behind you, Sherlock?”
“Pardon?”
He forces his voice to remain calm. “Not really, no.”
“But you’re powerless,” John says, clarity dawning on him. “That’s the ‘truth of the matter’, right? How long’s this been going on?”
The statement hangs in the air between them. John pushes to his feet when realisation strikes.
“Sherlock Holmes strikes me as a natural with children.”
“Fast asleep at this time of the morning – you didn’t get any rest the night before, even though you had a drink – whiskey – like you tend to after a difficult case or losing a patient to help you fall asleep; you showered in the evening rather than the morning since presumably your rhythm has been disturbed, and yet you have engaged in prolonged physical activity today – walking, probably, but it might have been cycling, though to judge that I’d need to take a closer look at your hands. So, something happened to upset you and required processing, prompting you to walk – here, since the lack of crumbs suggest you did not stop for breakfast where my brother would have undoubtedly had one of his lackeys collect you to avoid unplanned media coverage. And since,” Sherlock continues even though his voice is thinning, “Mary is no longer in custody, I deduce Mycroft came by before you had retired last night to tell you about her escape.”
“Care to expand on that, brother mine?”
Worry darkens John’s features even further at Sherlock’s admission. They proceed with similar caution, weapons raised and ready to fire, checking around corners and sweeping the path ahead for traps, which is why they notice the active CCTV camera.
“Do you have one of your minions track me, or is it just coincidence that you always call when I’m heading to the shops?”
Upon his return, James quickly surveys the room and the subdued atmosphere.
For several seconds, no one speaks. Mycroft leans on his umbrella in front of the closed door leading to the entrance hall while Sherlock is glaring at him from across the room. James’s eyes flick between them from his position in front of the kitchen table. The expensive piece of furniture serves as a wonderful shield between John and the rest of those present.
Anthea regards him. “Shall I arrange an appointment?”
“It was Moriarty,” Q whispers eventually, his voice dull and hoarse. “Or one of his men.”
Harry has her arm around James Moriarty.
“Yeah, and get accosted by every dickhead in the city?”
Sherlock hesitates. “I don’t know.”
John makes a dangerous noise at the back of his throat that Mycroft certainly heard. And yet he remains quiet.
Sherlock splutters for a moment, a blush rising up his neck. “May I change first?”
Sherlock's pulse is racing. The answers don’t come. “Solve what?”
“Her genius was of use to the government. She was recruited early. She introduced you to chemistry, Sherlock,” Mycroft adds. “She brought back Redbeard when you were five. A gift.”
No amount of hoping for the best can soothe the sense of foreboding, and the sharp pain in Sherlock’s chest at the sight of Lukas’s mutilated dark skin makes it hard to focus for a moment.
“I shan’t ask you how you are feeling, John,” Mycroft says, “since it would be an exercise in futility. I am here to tell you that Sherlock has been banned from your room as you requested last night.”
“Your brother’s a right wanker,” he tells Sherlock. “But you probably know that already.”
Sherlock’s reality tilts on its axis. His mind supplies the visual, extrapolates the actions taken by the parties in involved.
“Text me if you need more information,” John tells her, then narrows his eyes at the phone.
Last seen: Valencia, Spain – 28 September 2014
“He’s in a meeting and cannot –”
“Then bloody tell me what you know!” he shouts, slamming one hand on the table while stepping towards the other man, who jerks back.
Canon quotes are taken from Arianne DeVere’s
Sherlock throws the thing into the air with a grin. It turns when it reaches the highest point before falling back into Sherlock’s waiting palm. Indeed, there’s a slip of paper inside the cavity…
On the same day he calls an agency in order to get the house on the market.
“We can discuss that during your debrief.” Mycroft’s expression sobers when all John does is glare. “I promise to have you delivered to the hospital long before my brother is out of surgery.”
“We could, um, sign something?” Molly supplies. “A confidentiality agreement, or, um…”
Ending on a high note this time :) Hope you enjoyed this chapter!
“I’ll leave the script,” she says, placing the folder on the pile of fan mail on the cluttered coffee table. “Read it. You can always change your mind.”
Janine seems to concede the point but somehow fails to explain who the ‘we’ is she’s referring to and why John could be interested in joining them.
Harry’s lock screen background shows some ad campaign – probably one she helped design – and her password… is not her birthday. John tries her wedding day, and once that fails the day of the divorce.
“The flat is under constant surveillance, John. No one will sneak in to deliver substances of any kind.”
John watches him dash across the room and up the staircase to the second level of Magnussen’s office.
“The two of us against the rest of the world,“ he says with passion.
“Donovan called; said she’s a no-show at the agency.” Lestrade’s voice, in a tone that suggests he only just started on the case. “And Mycroft’s men are checking CCTV city-wide.”
“Aw, brilliant,” Janine beams. “Danny will be thrilled; the bastard’s an amazing baker. I’ll drop by tomorrow, all right? We’ve got a meeting in the afternoon, but after that I’m free. I’ll bring another tin. Can’t have our favourite detective starve to death, now, can we?”
So John clicks on “New blog entry” and starts to type.
“While I tend to think five moves ahead in every area of concern, John, you are by far not the only issue on my agenda.”
He sobers quickly, however. “We have to get you out of here.”
“His name’s Greg.”
Sholto hums a yes.
“We all did, you prick. Let me check your pupils.”
With an audible exhale, John steps past him and down the stairs. The other man follows, either because he knows what John is getting at or due to mild interest. Either way, John crosses his arms two metres from the front door, the message inescapably clear.
“How?”
Nightmares wake him before the sun rises.
Logic. There. Obviously Sherlock can’t leave now.
The way Mycroft’s voice curls around the word ‘friends’ has John’s stomach in knots.
“Quite,” Sherlock comments.
“… pecan, maybe pecan pie, some Americanism; or pistachio – Italy isn’t too far from Spain after all…”
“And when was that, exactly?” John’s tone is clipped, cold. “That day in the lift?”
John walks home. It doesn’t clear his head but it calms him down enough that the uneasy feeling in his chest loosens.
“Wear this. You’re going to get sick if you don’t dress in layers.” Sherlock said, his eyes not on John’s face but somewhere farther down, avoiding the quizzical look John gave him.
John first pulled out slowly, then pushed back in, his movements gaining speed after a while. Sherlock moaned audibly and arched his back when his prostate was repeatedly being hit by the cock inside him. Both of them felt their nearing climaxes, and Sherlock grabbed his length, eagerly pumping his orgasm out.
“Masturbating, John,” Sherlock had to grip tightly on the bedsheet to avoid climaxing just from John’s aggressive swearing. He found it tantalizingly thrilling – being looked down on by John who was only holding onto a thin thread of self-control – to tear his curtain of restraint little by little, until he unveils John’s true self. “While thinking about you ramming your cock into me.”
“And we couldn’t have that, could we,” John snorts. He’s too tired to be genuinely ticked off and, now that the smell of porridge fills his nose, also rather hungry.
“Mycroft insists.”
They are all there, from Janine’s stolen necklace (dubbed, “A Scorned Man”) to Miss Peregrine’s greedy solicitor. Not one word on Mary or Moriarty. It’s almost as if John has uncharacteristically chosen denial over confronting problems head on.
“She would have needed help. A confidante. To fake her death, I mean. Like Sherlock,” John adds, unnecessarily. Seeing Mycroft grimace at the reminder makes it worth it, though. “Who?”
Sherlock turns to James, probably to ask about restocking on ammunition, but John steps into his line of sight with clenching hands and a resolute glare.
(See the end of the chapter for
John breathes a sigh of relief. They have a destination.
Oddly, the deduction soothes something inside Sherlock.
It has been far too long since Sherlock heard John give a full-bellied laugh, and it’s definitely worth the blush colouring his cheeks. Even more so when the outward proof of Sherlock’s embarrassment only makes John laugh harder.
It was working, it really was. He’d pulled a bloke in his favorite old haunt in the Village. He’d met a beautiful young woman (not a model!) at a gallery opening just a few nights before. They were going to MOMA tomorrow.
As John tapped the screen to call Mike back, he heard Sherlock move into the bedroom. A flutter of anticipation bubbled low in his belly, not for shooting a potentially career-changing celebrity car campaign, but for having the sexiest and most beautiful man he’d ever seen enter his bedroom with lustful intentions.
He pumped his hand up and down the shaft, sucking strongly at the head, causing John to moan. All of John’s muscles became taut and Sherlock knew he was close. One last thrust and his throat was held open by John’s pulsing cock. He hummed around it, feeling so grateful for the unimaginable pleasure of making John come, feeling his beautiful release, his incredible pleasure. Sherlock loved everything about sex with John but John’s pleasure was paramount, the ultimate goal.
Sherlock placed one last peck on John’s lips and climbed off of him, wincing slightly. He held out his hand to John. John took it and he pulled him to standing, then led him into the small loo. They cleaned themselves up with a flannel found on the edge of the tub. Sherlock tossed it over his shoulder, never taking his eyes off of John. John stared back at him, letting his hands wander over Sherlock’s torso.
Sherlock had been waiting years to hear those words. He had given up hope, simply contented to have John back in his life after two long and lonely years without him. But this was finally happening, and Sherlock needed to make sure John knew it was welcome and wanted.
At that precise moment, Sherlock wrapped his hand around John's incredibly stiff cock and slowly, so slowly, pushed himself down on it.
Sherlock smiled, because this was what he wanted all along.
Sherlock frowned and grimaced and snarled. He gave beautiful angry faces to the camera and did exactly as John had asked.
They had met when John was shooting a wedding in Kabul. Well. Not the wedding exactly. He had hidden on a rooftop with his longest telephoto lens. The groom’s father was the highest ranking General in the Afghan army. One of the wedding guests, the general’s life-long best friend, was a high-ranking Operative for Al Qaida. John photographed the General and the Operative for an hour. He captured them them shaking hands, holding hands, sharing smirks and smiles, hugging, laughing, and generally looking like they were having the best time of their lives. John supposed he was biased by his own personal preferences, but it sure seemed to him that the two men shared more than one heated gaze when they thought no one was watching. John knew those photos would interest quite a few nations, and not to mention bring in top dollar.
“Oi,” John protested, and reached around to smack his arse again.
