Sherlock kept his eyes closed as he lucidly dreamed of his lover. The sound of John’s voice as he whispered in Sherlock’s ear. The taste of John’s kisses. Tea and jam.
“You have no ambition to find an omega and settle down?” James asked thoughtfully.
“Why not bring him in here where he can be treated properly?” John asked.
Sherlock dipped his chin and gave John a glowering stare. “Now is not the time, John.”
Williams’ eyes flittered back and forth between the two people. “Impossible!”
“By order of King William and Queen Mary, I place you under arrest.”
After an hour, Mike stood up straight and stretched.
Sherlock melted into his body, leaning heavily on the strong alpha. His thin frame overwhelmed by John’s broader chest and strong shoulders. Sherlock could feel the alpha’s muscles through his tuxedo. The idea of John concealing his greater strength and his alpha demeanor made Sherlock desire him more.
Sherlock gave John a pleading look then turned and pulled away. Victor smiled at the door as Sherlock walked passed him and out the door.
Sholto read the orders and realized he was completely wrong.
“The police are still looking for you, Frankie.” Sherlock said.
“WHAT!?” shouted John. “Connections? I don’t have connections!”
Tandoor was a thin man with oily black hair. He was sallow skinned and narrowed face. He was the offspring of a British father and a Southeast Asian mother, therefore never accepted by either culture.
Years later, Siger Holmes had  pushed for the king’s niece, James’ daughter, Mary, to marry her cousin, William of Orange. Mary was only fifteen. Mycroft had grown up with Mary and after she was married, Mycroft traveled with her back to the Netherlands and stayed with her for a year as a confidant. Although he was only a year older than Mary, she grew to rely on his judgement and wisdom.
Mycroft glanced at the man who shook his head no. The guard shoved the branding iron deeper into the embers and went to the table to pick up a pair of thumbscrews.
Sherlock stood gleefully in middle of a pile of boxes. He spun around looking at the miss-match pieces of furniture and odd collections of bric-a-brac that cluttered the flat surfaces. He was filled with a sense of independence and excitement he had never felt before.
He looked around the clean and fresh smelling flat and felt a wave of pride at what he had accomplished the day before. He decided today he would tackle the bathroom and his room. It took him most of the day to finish cleaning the flat the way he wanted to. In the evening he went to the shops and bought fresh fruit. When he came into the flat another present was sitting on the table. A note and small paper sack from a posh salon. John unfolded the note and read the message.
“You can leave now.” Sherlock said as he flopped down into his chair.
John stepped forward his gun still trained on the dead man on the floor. Sherlock stood up and rushed over to John.
“I quit, are ya’ deaf as well as stupid.” Harry grabbed a cup then dropped it onto the counter. It shattered.
John laughed. “Don’t be confusing us for them. We are more free-lance.”
Using his elbow, John broke the glass front of a case holding a fire extinguisher. He grabbed the red tank and slammed the bottom of the extinguisher onto the door handle, snapping it off. Greg and the other police officer shoved their shoulders into the door once the lock had been broken. The remaining metal snapped the door crashed open into the hospital room.
“You know you don’t need to do that.” John said as he slipped into the booth near the back of the pub.
John turned and left the flat again. He was planning on going to Mycroft to tell him Sherlock was using again. But half way there, John stopped. He didn’t want Sherlock taken away from him. If Mycroft knew, he would whisk Sherlock off to rehab and more than likely keep John from seeing him.
“I know his parents died when he was young and his brother is an arse.”
“I’m sorry you went through that. I’m sorry you ever thought you had to go through that. Were you alone after I left?” John asked.
“Yes. In whispers.” Sherlock said.
“John, wait!” Sherlock shouted as he realized John was going to drop him.
“No!” Sherlock quickly said. “221 Baker Street, Regent’s Park.”
“I should have been there.” John captured Sherlock’s thread.
“Not now, Sherlock. I’m done listening.” John grabbed his coat and slammed the door closed as he left.
“What? But that doesn’t make sense. Why would the same gun be used? They didn’t know anyone in common,” said John.
John twisted and glared at the omega. James quickly turned the car down the ramp of an underground carpark. He sped the car into the poorly lit garage and over speed bumps. He quickly parked the car and turned around. The small gun was already pointed at Sherlock when he spoke.
“Holmes don’t do relationships.” Sherlock snorted.
John felt his knees buckle. He dropped everything in his hands. His backpack slipping off his shoulder and hitting the floor hard.
A clap of thunder directly over the ship ripped the sky open. A bright flash of light blinded the two men for a moment.
“Sir Henry, always a pleasure.”
“Thanks. But I need another favor.” John said.
He returned to attention back to the table.
“It is a viable option since I just lost my scholarship.” John said. “And before you argue the point, no you are not paying for my education. It is my responsibility and I will find a way.”
“Oh – are you in trouble?”
“God, no! Never! How boring.” Sherlock leaned back next to John. Their shoulders touching. “There are things I can do . . . willing to do.”
“Everyone keeps telling me, I’m a doctor.”
Sherlock pushed himself off the sign post and started to follow John. The doctor headed north. He walked through Smithfield Market. The market was beginning to slow down and several of the vendors were already hosing down the pavement in front of their stalls. John walked passed the splashing water and through the wrought iron doors onto Charterhouse Street. There was a small French pastry shop across the street. John crossed the street and walked into the shop.
Sherlock laid his head on John’s chest and listened to the steady beat of the sailor’s heart. It was strong and constant. Not hurried but relaxed. Sherlock did not like to sleep. The hours before exhaustion finally overtook him, would be spent in frustration as his mind would switch from one thought to another. Unable to make connections or deductions. But listening to John’s heart slowed Sherlock’s mind. It cleared the distractions way and left only the rhythmic sound lulling Sherlock off. For once he did not regret the idea of sleep but instead welcomed it.
“What did he want?” Greg asked.
“Eliminate my problems.” The omega said twisting the barrel to look down the bore. Then he smiled and twisted the gun back around and pointed it at John. “Don’t you believe it would be the simplest answer to my problem? . . . Elimination?”
Sherlock ran up the steps and watched as the ship sailed at them.
“I’m fighting a war in Scotland right now. Why can’t he wait until we are done up north?” William moaned.
“Not my division.” Greg said as he stood up. “Beer?”
Hanson smiled. “Don’t worry, Captain. I’ve got this covered.”
“She’s an idiot. You can do better than that for a sexual partner.” Sherlock seemed to be studying the skull.
“A case . . .” Sherlock coughed again. “A case. They were smuggling Chinese antiquities.”
When Sherlock returned, one of the women who was dressed in male clothing opened the door. She let her eyes travel up and down his body before she let him in.
Sherlock let his hands move down John’s back and around to his front. With is palms spread wide, Sherlock pulled John back into his body.
“I haven’t met one yet, although my brother does have an assistant that might come close if she wasn’t so foolishly devoted to Mycroft.”
“And so I did, so I did. Who is this young man?” Tandoor’s eyes glanced over Sherlock’s frame salaciously. As if Sherlock was naked and up for sale to the highest bidder.
“I am sure. Your brother has been very thorough in making sure that your little indiscretion didn’t become public knowledge. Your brother cares for you deeply.”
Magnussen laughed softly. “So petulant. So childish. Just like your brother.”
“No, I think Port Royal might be a better destination.”
John rolled his spine and pushed further into the wet heat. Sherlock felt wonderful. The perfect sleeve for John’s cock. Tight and hot. Slick gushed out of the man and eased the way. John started to rock more intently. Pushing himself deeper. Slowly, Sherlock picked up the rhythm and started moving with John, driving the alpha deeper into his body. Their scents grew and the room became saturated with the combined smells.
Sherlock’s mind cleared and the ringing in his ears lessened. He felt hands on either side of his face as he lay on the floor of the van. His head was cradled in John’s lap. He blinked his eyes and looked up into John’s face. John’s helmet rolled across the floor as the van turned sharply.
He looked into Frankie’s eyes. He expected to see fear and hopelessness but he didn’t. There was something else there. It was almost like admiration.
“John! You’re a doctor . . . you know you shouldn’t be drinking while you’re pregnant!” Sherlock let go of John’s wrists. “Did some alpha try and pick you up?!” Anger burned white through Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock growled and pushed Moran back out of the flat. The alpha stumbled slightly, then stiffened his body, ready to attack.
“I just made that bed.” John growled at the man.
“Will we ever get a break?!” Mycroft cursed. He tossed his handkerchief over the box in the woman’s hands. “I need to speak to Admiral Ritter immediately. It may be time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I . . . I apologize, om . . . Captain?”
The pictures flipped to one of Moran’s favorites. It was taken while Sherlock was inside the flat at 221 Baker Street. Moran had taken it with a high power telephoto lens through the window. Sherlock must have been alone in the flat. He was standing in the middle of the living room, away from the windows but still visible to Moran. It appeared the omega had just gotten out of the shower because he was nude except for a towel hanging loosely over his narrow hips.
“You will come for me as soon as you are released?” John heard the uncertainty in Sherlock’s voice. Emotional pain flickered in Sherlock’s changeable eyes.
Sherlock had rushed up the stairs of his flat and immediately sat down at the desk. He grabbed the first book on a stack of them and started thumbing through the pages. John and James came into the flat behind Sherlock. Two, twenty-one, B looked roughly how John had remembered it. Cluttered and disorganized but homey. He glanced around looking for evidence of the flat mate that Sherlock had spoken of, but other than a trashy romance novel that John severely doubted Sherlock would ever touch let alone read, there was no evidence of the other omega.
“But you probably come from money. Why would you want to live here? With me?”
“It is when the last time he got pissed off with someone, he broke their jaw with a single punch.” James smiled.
“Tracking down a lead, Holmes. I was involved on a raid over in Mile’s End tonight. Guess what I found.” Dimmock teased.
Frankie glanced away for a moment then looked back. “Just a few drugs. Nothing major.”
“Is he abusive to Sherlock?” John asked. John kept his eyes down and tried to not act overly concerned.
The sound of the church bells could be heard in the distance. The time was midnight.
“But I would prefer to fuck it off.” James returned John’s smile.
John in the kitchen making the perfect cup of tea for him.
“Going somewhere?” John asked as he stood watching the other man.
John sighed and glanced around them. “Let’s get the fuck out of here,” he said as he shoved his hands deep into his pockets.
Only about two dozen spectators were present for the evening. James and John stood towards the back of the crowd and shifting behind the other on-lookers as they watched a woman dressed in a traditional red silk Chinese robe approach.
Sherlock started on John’s left thigh. He licked the slick glistening there. It was sweet and warm like brown sugar or honey. Sherlock believed he could get drunk on it. He leaned forward and licked at the source of the slick. John moaned and pushed back into Sherlock’s face.
“No, no, no.” The man came closer to Sherlock then without warning he punched Sherlock in the gut with a quick jab.
“I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock started to rise up.
“Interesting.” Moriarty hummed.
“Who? I barely knew Victor and Moriarty. Who do I know who knows them other than you?” asked John.
“Ah, no . . . the heat is over . . . I just want to get cleaned up.” John said, still blushing as the naked man stood over him.
“So it is you who is paying the scholarship! I should have known! Where is the money coming from, Sherlock? How are you paying for that and forcing Mrs. Hudson to give us this flat and everything else?! Is it drugs?!” John felt a stabbing pain to his heart. Sherlock had been treating him like a child. Hiding things from him and lying to him about everything. Had he just lied about loving him?
“John, just shut up. You’re making my head hurt.” Sherlock moaned as he closed his eyes and leaned his head back in the chair.
“Not exactly, but we would be investigating and chasing down anyone who is dangerous.”
John wanted to cry. “Did it work? Did it help?”
John shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “Who is he?”
“I sincerely hope my sacrifice will someday be appreciated.” He reached down and picked up his briefcase. “Well then, I am needed elsewhere.” He started to walk towards the door, then spoke again without looking at Sherlock. “And thank you for the information regarding your method of egress from the flat. I will make sure that the roof access door of the neighboring building is locked and bolted.”
“Don’t be rude.” Sherlock said. The irony of the statement seemed lost on him.
“It doesn’t matter. Johnny Boy is too stupid to remain where it might be safe with Sherlock. He will leave Sherlock and return to his flat. You can pick him up there. Take him home and get him used to being yours. If you like, I have several suggestion on how the break the man in. I even have a few whips and gags if you like. I used them on Sherlock years ago. I think that it would poetic that you use them on Johnny Boy now.”
“I found you a tutor.” Mike said still smiling.
“No, I was tracking down a serial killer in Bristol.”
“No.”
Jim’s expression hardened and his eyes grew cold again.
Sherlock trembled slightly as John’s finger lightly grazed his cheek. “No, it’s fine.” He whispered.
John was so busy watching the crowd, he missed the taxi that had pulled up in front of 22 Northumberland. It had been parked there for at least a minute before John saw it. He noticed the passenger in the backseat turn around for a second and look right at him. The male passenger was tan and seemed to looking for something. He turned around and the taxi started to drive off.
Sherlock stepped forward and looked up at the spikes of electricity arcing from the mast.
“Absolutely. Sholto killed the man trying to kill me and Blackwood killed Magnussen. It is over.”
The man smiled and nodded. “He was experienced at it.”
“And did you?” Seb raised an eyebrow.
“I am aware that you have been seeing a man by the name of Sebastian Moran.”
Sherlock slowly drug his finger through their combined release on his belly. Then Sherlock brought his finger up to lips and tentatively licked at the pearlescence cum. His tongue swirling over the finger lewdly before plunging into his mouth – between those red plump lips.
“Alright, I’ve solved your case. Will you get us the evidence on Victor’s murder?”
“How melodramatic.” Sherlock quibbled.
James twisted and looked at John. The soft lights making James’ scared face smoother as his intense grey blue eyes stared at John.
That last thought drove the soldier to darker thoughts. Thoughts about stealing John away from which ever alpha had taken John from him. Marking John as his own. Crushing the life of every alpha that had touched his John. Moran holding John tight. Making sure no one would ever take him away again. He would get John and lock him up. Bar the doors and windows. Keep him caged. He would collar the omega. Leave him waiting for Moran to come to him. To serve him and do his will. Dark thoughts that included keeping John naked and on his knees.
Sherlock looked annoyed as he sat in the back of the ambulance. The paramedic had slipped on the same orange blanket he had just shrugged off, over his shoulders again. Sherlock rolled his eyes and glared at the beta.
“No, problem, no. I just was . . . out shopping.” Sherlock plopped the bags on the kitchen table. He noticed John was holding the bottle of alcohol.
“Fine. Brief skirmish east of Chughak. Nothing bad.”
2010 London, England
~221~
“Yes, and I was sent off to school at eleven, and he was dead by the time I was fifteen. He never felt the need to tell me his opinion regarding many things. But I was aware of how he felt about me.”
“This is what will happen Sherlock. I’m done waiting for you. You are mine now. It is your choice on how comfortable your life will be from this point forward.”
“Your ship is sinking. You have only one option. Call your men off and surrender. I will let you row out of here on your long boats. Otherwise you will drown with your ship or be hung by the British.”
“John I need you to wake up now.”
“Did you murder Victor?”
John pushed his meal away from himself. The owner came over to refill both mugs. He glared at Sholto.
“They keep putting this blanket on me. Why do they keep putting a blanket on me?” Sherlock rose and tossed the blanket off again.
“Shame.” Sherlock said as his fingers slipped into the pocket of John’s shirt. He pulled out the vial of liquid cocaine. John never felt it. “I think I would enjoy fucking you.”
“You could have warned me.” Sherlock offered. “I’m not an idiot.”
“I was a child. I didn’t know.” John repeated.
The fact the man knew who Sherlock was meant that his kidnapping had not been random. That made the situation that more dangerous for him. Sherlock struggled to his feet, digging his fingernails into the swollen boards of the bulkhead. His bare feet sliding on the slick deck.
Greg studied Sherlock to see if the man was trying to trick him. “Like last time?”
Renfrew Road was a narrow street lined with the depressing, pale brick buildings. A housing projects from the fifties. Small one car garages protruded in front of each unit. Small windows prevented any view in or out of the flats. No gardens and nothing individual about any of the houses. Numerous two-story units connected together in a huge ugly block of small nameless flats.
“I was assigned here.” John said trying to not sound exasperated by being asked the same question over and over again.
Before Moran could close in on John, Sherlock ran forward placing himself between Moran and the stunned alpha. Sherlock clenched his fists, his right tucked under his chin and left slightly forward. Sherlock kept his elbows tight to his body in an attempt to protect his ribs. He jabbed his right fist forward and caught Moran on the chin.
“We’re sailing west to Jamaica?” Sherlock asked.
John stood up and carefully pulled his shirt on. He started towards the door and staggered. James leapt up to catch him, but John pulled away from him.
“Sleep, John. When you wake you will feel better.”
John mentioned the flight number and Sherlock was distracted again from the two other people in the room. John watched his bond mate start pacing around the room, whispering the flight number. John glance up at Irene. The woman was smiling at him. She was happily telling him, that she could take his mate away from him and their child whenever she wanted.
Jim’s expression rapidly changed. A dark shadow cross over his face and his eye hardened to flint. The back of his left hand crashed into the side of Sherlock’s face. The slap was loud.
“Sherlock?!”
“I can’t help myself. It’s a compulsion.”
“Has he been catching her?” Moran raised an eyebrow.
In the back of his mind, Sherlock rushed to find a reason why Magnussen would have kidnapped him. He wasn’t seen getting into the car by anyone. And even if he was, it would appear Sherlock did so under his own volition. No reason for someone to call the police. No one would have thought to.
John scanned either side of the road as the cab slowly drove down the narrow street. On the left side, he noticed a unit with a skip parked in front of it. Building scraps were piled inside of the skip.
“I need to send a message.”
“I need to work.” Sherlock said as he turned his back to Blackwood.
“If you were familiar with me, you would know that I don’t give compliments. They are often futile and false. No, I’m simply stating a fact. You have chosen to live your life by your own terms. And in a world that doesn’t readily accept women of such ambitions. You are to commended.” Sherlock sat down in the opposite chair and crossed his long legs.
“Yes. The fire brigade will be dispatched almost immediately.” She quickly turned and opened the door. The smell of smoke wafted into the room. Anthea rushed out.
“A combination of Coconut milk and sulfur.” John said.
It was a spring afternoon when Greg stepped out onto the pavement in front of the headquarters of Scotland Yard. The afternoon traffic was heavy and the smell of auto exhaust was thick in the air. He pulled on the knot of his tie and started to walk. He was heading for the tube station when he noticed the black limo following him. Greg paused by the kerb as the car pulled up alongside him.
“No, none at all. And the two of you seem to be living within the limits of your pension, here in London, but . . .” Greg paused. John forced himself to remain calm and not ask ‘what?’
John shook his head and stood up. “Better if I get some sleep in my own rack.”
“NO . . . NO . . . NO . . !” Sherlock screamed as the firemen pulled him away from the fire.
“Maybe the man John knew wasn’t loathsome. You’re letting your personal emotions color your observations.” Mycroft said. His mind beginning to spin away from the initial assessment.
“Only just.”
“Is that what you did with that woman in San Juan?” Sherlock’s voice was horse.
“John, I tried to reach . . . we all tried to reach you.” Moran set his hand over John’s. He looked down at their joined hands. “It’s okay. I’m going to make it okay.”
Sherlock watched as another man pushed the first man aside, and then took his place. His thrusts were more rapid. More demanding. The woman gasped and tried to move away, but the brut held her in place. She groaned and it was obvious she was not enjoying it anymore.
Sherlock stared for a moment then reached out and pulled John into the cottage. Wrapping his arms around the younger man.
“John . . .”
“And who would want to kidnap Sherlock?” Lestrade asked again. Lestrade could list numerous people but none were willing to murder to get him.
“Stupid little omega. On the floor where you belong.” Jim said. Then he turned and spoke to someone outside of Victor’s view. “He is waiting for you.”
John stood up straight and glared at the man. “DON’T YOU DARE! Don’t you compare what I did to what you are doing!”
The man looked down on the dead body of his daughter-in-law’s brother. He spat at the dead man and turned and walked away.
“You really want him?” Moriarty asked.
The two alphas were growling at each other. At any minute they were going to start to fight. John needed help. He needed to get to hospital.
“Tell me.” John whispered. His pulse rate increased. He could feel a hunger begin to build. A need. Something he hadn’t fed since leaving England. Something that had been hidden away for long time.
This day Moran was sitting in the window and watched as Holmes and John had returned from shopping. The alpha growled as he watched John carry the white shopping bags while Holmes studied his phone. Moran watched from the opposite flat at the three people inside. Holmes and that woman, Adler, and his John. The omega was sitting at the desk and was obviously upset. He could tell by the slope of John’s shoulders and the stiffness he held in his back. Moran wondered why Holmes had not noticed John’s discomfort. Why Holmes was allowing Adler into his flat with the pregnant omega.
“Who is it?!” he heard shouted through the closed door.
“What? . . . Wait, who? I’m not Sherlock.” John said. He was confused.
“Why?”
The water had helped. Sherlock’s head was clearing. “Can you tell me why he wants me?”
Scandal in Belgravia
“The guy who is trying to get you out of the rubbish. Now give me that suitcase and then your hand.”
Sherlock and two other men carried John’s limp body up to his cabin. They gentle laid him down on his bunk. Sherlock pulled a chair close and sat down beside him. When the other men left, Sherlock picked up John’s hand and brushed his lips over the back of the knuckles.
Moran winced as he shrugged off his coat. Sherlock pulled on a pair of latex gloves and watched as Moran struggled to remove the cotton shirt. The fabric had adhered to the wound as the blood had dried. Sherlock grabbed the man’s shoulder and pulled him forward to look at the exit wound.
“John, I’ll leave for now. But I will be back to get you. And I’m going to keep you whether you like it or not. You are mine now!” Moran growled in anger.
“SHERLOCK!” Mycroft’s voice boomed across the inky night. Sherlock smile grew.
John quickly stood and wrapped his strong arm around Sherlock’s waist pulling the man flush with his body.
“Hanson was real good at poker. He won all the time. He also saved most of his money packets from Afghanistan. Never spent much while he was overseas.”
“Yes, come in.” Lady Smallwood’s elegant lyrical voice called out.
“You wearing a wire or something?”
John felt a lump in his throat. He remembered how horrible it was growing up with his abusive father but he never thought of taking drugs to deal with it. He placed his palm over Sherlock’s heart, feeling the steady slow beat from within.
“What’s happening?” John asked as Sherlock pulled him into a room then through an open window.
John dragged his thumb over Sherlock’s dark eyebrow.
Perplexed by John’s laughter, Sherlock remembered it was what he had said to the American after he had almost ripped him from the backseat of the taxi. He too started to laugh. For a brief moment, the alpha and omega stood laughing in comradery at the whole absurd situation. Then they noticed the real police officer walking towards them.
“Why were you asking about the gun?” Sherlock asked.
“I was not aware that you was your department?” Mycroft said as he sat down. He carefully folded his hands together and set them on the desk.
“What’s this?” asked John.
“This is between us. You leave him out of this. He is a good man and doesn’t need to be bothered by either you or your brother.” John took several threatening steps forward towards the dark haired man.
John gave a weak smile.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open and instantly he regretted in letting Mycroft know that he still had feelings for John. Sherlock hadn’t said anything, but the emotions were plain to read on his face. A knowing smile came to Mycroft as he handed over a manila envelope to Sherlock. Sherlock took the envelope suspiciously. The last time Mycroft had done this, it had turned Sherlock’s world upside down. He hesitated before he lifted the flap and removed the pages inside.
“Sherlock, I don’t know what you are talking about.” John said softly, there was an iron intensity to his words.
“Let me guess . . . there is a certain ex-Army doctor with him right now.”
“James,” John’s voice was soft. “I know. I know you are there for me. And you gave me so much.”
“You sell drugs to people?” John’s mind slipped to a question he had been afraid to ask. “You sold drugs to Sherlock?”
He still was unsure if Sherlock was ready for another physical relationship, but he was even more uncertain if he was ready for the requirements of a homosexual relationship. He knew he found Sherlock attractive and desirable, but would he find the act of homosexual intercourse as enjoyable as heterosexual?
The other women who lined the ally and spoke to various men who wandered passed them. The younger men would point and laugh. Waving their ebony canes and critiquing the various deficits each woman had. They would sneer and jest. Sometimes poking the women with their canes as they laughed. Michelle hated them.
“I would have killed Moran if he had harmed you.” John said coolly.
“Because your boss in England wouldn’t be happy with you. You need me alive for him. And if I kill myself, you not only lose his support you could lose your life!”
Then there was Jeanette.
“No!”
“Sherlock! Mycroft! That is enough!” Violet snapped. “One would think you were raised without any manners or dignity at all.”
“I agree.” The voice came from behind John.
“Yes, my lord. We just learned of it today.” Montague said in a gasping breath. The man must had run from the far side of Whitehall when he was summoned.
He said to himself and turned to leave the flat again.
“Where should I start to look?” Lestrade asked condescendingly.
“So the gentleman is now a sea rat.”
To say Sherlock was unhappy about John’s new job would have been an understatement.
Dimmit said “Yes” the same time John said “No.”
Blackwood immediately emptied his guns into advancing sailors. He pulled out his cutlass and started to hack his way through the enemy.
Greg blinked his eyes. He recognized Sherlock Holmes and John Watson immediately. He just didn’t know why they were sitting in his living room at eleven o’clock at night.
Mycroft took on a haughty expression. “Sherlock is needed here – by my side. England needs him and it is his duty to serve her.”
McMath readied his cannons and fired again. The cannonballs sailed into the superstructure of the ship. The masts snapped and cracked. Falling heavily onto the deck.
He was a tall man. He walked like a young man but not with swagger of youth. He paused for a moment and looked at the other woman. The woman smiled broadly and showed the missing tooth in her smile. The woman pushed up her bosom and wiggled her chest, cackling as she did so. He was unimpressed and walked on. He came up to Michelle.
John could tell Sherlock was close to his ear. He could feel Sherlock’s breath across his cheek. Something very bad must have happened for Sherlock to sound so worried.
In another corner, he saw was he thought was an Iron Maiden. A wooden box tall enough for a man to stand inside. Metal spikes protruded inward from the various sides of the box stabbing anyone who was unfortunate enough to be placed inside.
When more frozen balls pelted them, the two men curled up trying to protect themselves. They shouted and screamed but Hanson kept firing until the reservoir was empty. Their bodies were bruised and bloody. By the time the two men realized they were no longer being fired upon, Hanson was already on the stairs running down to the street level.
“I will provide you with the name of your spider if you rescind the conservatorship.”
“Don’t . . .” John said cautiously. “You should be happy that you were right and I was wrong.”
“How was she murdered?” Sherlock asked.
“As well as the surveillance teams.” Sherlock snarled as he went to stand next to John.
“So if it was already going off, then removing the painting from the wall wouldn’t trigger it?”
“A mere newspaper man who has the opportunity to step into the very halls of power. Think of the all the interesting little bits of information you could gain with Lady Smallwood indebted to you?”
Sherlock threw himself off the boxes and crashed into Frankie. His hands wrapped quickly around the man’s throat.
John stood staring out at the flat patch of ground to the south east of the camp. It was broad and flat and reasonably free of stones. A smile came to his face.
“That is not love, Sherlock,” John said. “That is not how someone who loves you treats you.”
“This is unacceptable. I can not allow you to compromise my position by your weaknesses. There must be consequences for this Sherlock.”
“I want to touch you.” John whispered into Sherlock’s mouth.
John glared at the man.
“Well, then, if you are available for tonight, I would like to introduce you to one of my favorite chefs. I will request he makes a private meal for us and we share it here in your hospital room.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I did not.” John argued back. He wondered how Dimmit had gotten the information about the interviews so quickly.
“And that’s my problem why?”
John sat down and read through the complete document. It was true. Sherlock had transferred half of his trust to John. Seven million pounds. He couldn’t accept it. Then it occurred to John. Sherlock said he was going to court John.
“Ah, only professionally.” John said. He didn’t know why he felt like he was lying. He had no intentions of seeing Sherlock except professionally.
Moriarty smiled. “Yes it is . . . good thing I wasn’t bonded during my heat. If that had happened then I would be in trouble. How long does a heat bonded omega last after his alpha is killed?”
“Sir Henry, the letter.” Stapleton prodded.
John looked up at him and couldn’t help himself. He smiled and placed a chaste kiss to the man’s lips. Sherlock could feel the shift within John. He knew that nothing more would happen now, but he also knew this was just the beginning.
Moran watched as the evac helicopter took off with John and Huntley laying on the deck. The doors were open and Moran could see the medic tearing John’s shirt off to get to the wound on his shoulder. Moran’s own shirt was soaked with his and John’s blood. He and the rest of his squad were taken back to the forward base by a Humvee. It would be an hour before he could reach John. They pulled into the base, just as Moran saw another helicopter taking off.
Dimmit cursed and slammed the file folder down on the table. It made a whish sound as papers slipped out of it.
“Pick up my shit?! What are you talking about? You don’t clean up after me. I do.” John shook his head. “And that still doesn’t explain why you quit your job!”
The door of the lift opened. Sherlock was rushed out of the building and into a van that had just pulled up. Sherlock was deposited on the floor of the van. The vehicle was moving before the back door was even closed. The tires squealing on the tarmac.
was obvious.
Something else had to be responsible here.
“Sleeping is boring.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock looked up at the man. “How do you know that?”
He remembered waking up as a big, heavy alpha climbed on top of him. At first he thought it was Jim, but he man was blond. He was too muscular to be Jim. His shoulders were broad and there was a scar on his face. His eyes were watery grey.
“Mister Holmes?”
“Except be my own person!” Sherlock barked. “I’m an omega! I won’t ever be allowed to be myself!”
“Yes! Yes! I am yours!” Sherlock shouted as John’s knot pressed through the muscles and into the omega’s body. It swelled rapidly locking the two of them together.
“Yes, I know it was stupid of him.” Sherlock said.
“John?” the voice was deep and familiar.
John promised himself to write a letter the next day. It was just a few lines. How much John enjoyed shooting and how much he hated the food. He wrote about the morning runs that started in the dark and finished just as the sun had moved above the horizon. He wrote how much he missed Sherlock and hoped Sherlock was taking care of himself. He quickly ended the letter before he started to gush and write down how badly he wanted to be with Sherlock and how much he wanted to wake up next to the man. He sealed the letter and made sure it was in the afternoon mail bag.
Mike shoved the rest of his sandwich into his mouth. Following it quickly with a sip of coffee. John waited but frowned as he watched his friend take his time.
“Moran was Moriarty’s right hand man. He will be upset with the person who killed him.”
“Are you wearing any pants?”
“I guess this is about you and Sherlock,” he said as he set up the coffee maker.
“What? . . . In the bedroom? . . .” John stepped in the room beside Sherlock and saw her. Asleep in their bed. Irene Adler. “Oh . . .”
“Just something to help you relax.” Culverton said. “Now, back to my friend. He is an interesting man. Very charismatic. Clear thinking and an excellent planner.”
“Children? . . . I’m not even pregnant and now you are talking about children. Plural?”

“No, you go first.” Sherlock mumbled.
“Find out who killed his step son.”
“John, you can’t believe him. He is a ‘gob-shite’. He thinks he is still your boyfriend.”
“Would you come to bed?”
“You would have reveled in the fact that I came to you for help. Never.”
“John, he protected you. It is time we protect him. The conservatorship is nothing compared to that.”
“I won’t follow you into a drug den again, Sherlock! I won’t sit there and feel helpless while I wait for an ambulance to arrive. Wondering if my brother will die before help comes. I won’t let you do that to yourself again!”
“What?!” John barked.
“Pity, I can just imagine how long it would take me to break down that stoic expression of yours.” The woman stepped forward and smiled knowingly.
“I will deal with my brother as I see fit, Doctor Parker.” Mycroft said as he pushed passed him and towards Sherlock’s bed. If he kept speaking to Parker, Mycroft may had to acknowledge things he wanted to keep buried. Fear of actually losing Sherlock was the most important one.
Greg was moving around the boxes checking lot numbers with the list of stolen boxes when he heard a sound of scaping. Something softly being dragged over the concrete. He glanced around the room to see where the sound had come from. There was a gurgling noise, like someone was drowning. Greg pulled out his torch and held it like a truncheon. He slowly walked around the various pieces of heavy machinery still bolted to the ground. His footsteps seemed unnaturally loud.
He knew he could deduce all those things if he had been allowed more time to study John Watson, but he wasn’t. He only had a few brief moments with the man. Brief, intense, memorable moments. Sherlock wasn’t sure why it mattered so much to him but it did.
They were docked in Charlotte Amalie.
“And I was tossed out by Sherlock. I don’t ever plan on making the same mistake twice.” John pushed the hard edge to his voice.
Moriarty’s hands encircled Violet’s neck.
Two days after John had stopped taking suppressants, he woke up alone in the flat. He hadn’t seen Sherlock since the night he asked John to bond. John thought about the conversation with Sarah. He thought about all the times he had shouted he never wanted an alpha bond mate. He remember the alphas in the army that had tried something with him. He had broken two arms and one nose of alphas who wouldn’t take no for an answer. Suddenly John’s mind was swirling. John wanted to believe he wanted to bond with Sherlock but what if when he was in the throes of heat he reacted like he did in the army? What if he panicked or if Sherlock panicked? Sherlock had never seen him naked. What if Sherlock changed his mind after seeing John’s scarred body? What would happen to John if Sherlock rejected him?
“If you refuse to participate in group therapy.”
“SHERLOCK, CAN YOU HEAR ME!?” John shouted.
Sherlock closed his eyes. He never said the words to John, but he meant them too. That is why- that is the reason when Mycroft showed the picture to him, Sherlock had to act. He had to protect John. Sherlock made his deal with the devil and he sent his heart away from him. He made the choice, never telling John. If John had known he would have stayed. He would have fought. Sherlock sent him away, never letting John know how much it hurt him.
John paused and looked over at Seb. “It’s not that.”
“How could it have been one of my men? I didn’t even know where you were until I saw the CCTV feed.”
“Victor did things for him.” Frankie said.
Mycroft caught himself and stepped back. He smoothed down the front of his suit as he glanced at the three people who were looking at him.
John gave the address of a building halfway down the street from his. In the opposite direction of where the men were looking. Within five minutes, firetrucks and police cars came rushing to the address John gave. The street was lit up by the flashing emergency lights and the blaring of sirens. Firemen were rushing into the building and banging on doors to wake up residents. The police were blocking the traffic.
The small boat turned and the four men on the oars rowed as hard as they could. James grabbed the end of the rope and watched as it played out as John swam away from them.
“Friday.”
“Clear, clear.” John heard distantly.
“This interview stops now.” She said with a slight Welsh accent. She placed a sleek black briefcase on the table, blocking Dimmit’s view of infuriated John.
“No, we don’t. We don’t need to do anything . . . together.” John said as he quickly scanned the room.
“Then I’ll order a sleeper sofa and you will be more comfortable.” Sherlock said. He opened the book and started to read again.
“Mycroft, you gave in too quickly. What is wrong?” Violet asked her eldest.
Ryan had locked the lift so John couldn’t leave. No one else was in the flat and John was alone. John turned when he heard the sound of the lift operating again. The doors opened and Sherlock stood in the car. He stared out at John before he lowered his eyes and averted his glance. He walked forcefully into his living room trying to give the impression he was in control.
“John? . . . Are you done?”
The nursing staff had gotten John out of clothes and had him lying naked in Sherlock’s lap. They were slipping the hospital gown on when the mid-wife arrived. The woman gave John an examination and then reviewed his chart. The nurses and the mid-wife spoke in hush tones glancing occasionally at John and Sherlock. Then the mid-wife left and returned with the attending physician.
“Just like last time we were here. Half of the crew can leave now and the other half tomorrow night. I want someone on duty at all time. And if the Scotland shows up in the harbor, fire a cannon. We should be able to get back to the Morstan quicker that way.”
“I told you before. We won’t return to England. We’ll help you find out who is behind Magnussen, but we can’t return.”
“I . . . I don’t . . . maybe six or seven times.”
“Johnny, good morning. What brings you around? Is Sherlock with you?” Frankie’s course Eastend accent had vanished with the realization a patron was present. “You know we aren’t open this time of day.”
The demand of Blackwood’s order brought Sherlock back. He scampered up from under John and carefully wrapped his arms around John’s chest, lifting the man up as Blackwood grabbed John’s legs. Together they carried the unconscious John over to the Morstan. They carried him down to the lower decks and to Mike, who was already bloodied from saving other sailors.
John turned his back on Sherlock and moved back to the table. He glanced down at the empty glass then at the bottle. He knew he was slightly drunk but he was more than able to make decisions.
He tossed off the shawl and stepped out of the water bath. He stomped across the parquet floors, his wet feet leaving footprints behind.
He held them there for a briefest of moments, then John felt the smear of a tongue across the seam of his lips. The gentle push of Seb’s tongue requesting entrance. John relented and opened his mouth. He tasted beer and curry, and something else. Something heady and delicious. John closed his eyes and opened his mouth further allowing Seb full access. John’s hand slipped up and around the bigger man’s shoulders. He could feel the muscles under the cotton shirt and the heat coming of Seb’s body. For the briefest of moments, John compared it to another man’s body. A thinner more refined body than Seb’s. Then John forced the memories away and pushed forward into Seb. Letting new memories erase the old.
“You’re in shock.”
Moriarty was kneeling beside him on the bed. His head was bowed and his eyes were closed. His body still trembling from the incident.
“Yes, there was a wall between the exhibits and the glass front of the gallery. But the doorway was huge. You could see from the back of the room to the front.”
“John Hamish Watson, I’m arresting you in connection to the murder of Victor Trevor.” Greg said firmly. “Step away from him, Sherlock. For you own good.”
John groaned and twisted his head to look at his shoulder. “An infection?”
The phrase ricocheted inside Sherlock’s head. ‘
“John . . .” It was a gasp. Relief.
Lestrade cleared his throat. “I’ll need to know where the two of you are going. Tomorrow an officer will come by and take a full statement and then we can file formal charges against Trevor.”
“Yes, sir.” The private saluted and immediately left with John trailing behind him.
“I have to go there!” Sherlock announced as he stood up, pulling out of John’s grasp.
Greg and John glanced back and forth between Sherlock and themselves. Greg finished his beer and held the bottle up towards John.
“UPSTAIRS!” One shouted.
“You don’t have much in the way of reading material around here and I my phone needs to be recharged. You don’t have the proper charging cables.” Sherlock said as he turned the page. “Have you ever seen a case of schistosomiasis?”
“Those guys were just giving him what he wanted. No one was hurt. No harm, no foul. There’s no reason you need to bring this up to your brother.”
John finished reading the newspaper article about another celebrity dying unexpectedly after rehab. The young woman had been a reality TV personality who had been arrested numerous times for possession and disorderly conduct. She had just finished her second stint in rehab when her dead body was found in her hospital bed. The article speculated that one of her many celebrity friends had snuck drugs into the hospital for her and it was an overdose that killed her. The autopsy was expected to reveal the true cause.
The men who had been staking out the flat, got out of their vehicle and turned to watch as people came rushing out of the building, screaming, and shouting. The entire street was now awake and people were coming out to the street to watch. Crowds gathered and the flashing lights added accents to stark faces.
Sherlock smiled. “John won’t keep anything stronger because of my history. You will just have to suffer through.”
“Not exactly, but close enough. I could make a counter proposal.”
“No.” Mycroft looked as uncomfortable as Greg felt. “The other one.”
He sat in his chair with his fingertips steeple under his chin. He remembered the sensation of John’s unexpected kiss. The firmness of John’s lips. How warm they were pressed to his. The scent of John skin; generic soap, hint of mint toothpaste and something so very specifically John Watson. Moments of the past month came rushing back to him.
John frowned at the antics of his teammates and went to his locker. He toed off his shoes and socks, then took off his shorts and pants in one go. He grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his waist. Grabbing his shower bag, he went back over to Wilderbrant.
“You couldn’t stop me if I wanted to take John away but . . . but I made a mistake . . . I thought John and I . . .” He closed his eyes and sucked in a breath through his clenched teeth. “Just help me get him back from James. He will hurt John and I . . . neither of us want that.”
“No. Who is he?”
James leaned back slightly. “Okay, John. Whatever you say. He sleeps with the crew and I’ll put him on the scrubbers.”
“I’m surprise you would notice. My mother was a lovely person. Kind and giving.” Moriarty said.
“JOHN! . . . JOHN!?”
John blinked. He wasn’t sure why that information was important, but he didn’t choose to argue with the policeman.
“The whole way back, I thought about it, Sherlock. I thought about us, and what I want us to be. I want this. I want you.”
“Oh, sorry.” Greg said.
“STOP!” John shouted. He grabbed the driver’s arm. The man braked the truck and it spun sideways on the gravel.
“I still don’t understand. Why were you kidnapped and not your brother?” James asked.
“He works with the Met.” John explained. John stared back at the mirror and caught James’ worried expression. “Don’t worry. I’ve got this under control.”
Sherlock spun at the voice and kicked himself mentally for not noticing the other boy in the room.
“I’m sorry, sir. But I knew you needed to see this immediately.” The man said as he rushed forward and handed a tablet to Moriarty.
“Sherlock was young. Only three when our father left us for his mistress, Jessica Moriarty. She had already given birth to her son, James, by the time he left."
James glanced up at John. “So if I asked you to go to bed with me, you would?”
“Get below and hide.” James growled at the man.
The message was repeated across the ship and seconds later the gun ports on the lower deck were open and a single cannon was rolled into position. Just as the smaller boat was pulled up and onto the deck, the ship rocked to the side with the shot.
Sherlock had made a promise to his brother that there would always be a list of what he had taken. A list just in case he needed medical intervention. The list was there but Sherlock was not.
Sherlock hummed and John could feel the sound rumbling through the dark haired man’s chest and into his back.
John shifted over Sherlock’s body as he pushed Sherlock’s shirt up. John bent down and laid kisses across the man’s breastbone. Light soft kisses that felt like shocks of electricity running through them. John’s teeth lightly teased at Sherlock’s nipple before biting down on the nub.
“Yes he did . . . shot one of his own men and left with me and four tons of heroine. We celebrated in Singapore.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He stepped away from the body and circled around the room. He noticed the bathroom door open. He marched over and looked inside the room. A mirror was laying on the marble counter. A white powdery residue was evident on the mirror. There were also another empty bottle of alcohol and several small medicine vials scattered across the counter and spilled pills. Dirty towels were tossed on the floor.
There was a hesitation of only a few seconds and then the Morstan rocked again to the side as the cannons fired. Water splashed up and covered the deck of the Hound. The ship rocked as holes were punched into its side. The hull groaned and the ship listed further to the left.
“You okay?” Frankie asked.
“McMath?! Why aren’t we retuning fire?!”
Sherlock stood in the middle of his flat watching as John retreated into the other room. He wondered if he had made a terrible mistake.
“I did not encourage the colonel in any way. Not in Afghanistan and not here. I didn’t even know he was London until two nights ago.”
He opened the bag again and looked at the dildo again. It was a model of an alpha cock, nine inches long. John took it out of the bag. It was large and heavy. A small remote with two different buttons came with it. John pressed the orange button on the remote and the knot near the base of the dildo began to swell. Small rollers moved along the fake knot pushing the latex out to a diameter of three inches. The roller kept moving and would add stimulation to the omega prostate once inside. John felt his mouth go dry. He pressed the red button and the whole dildo started to vibrate. John almost dropped it. He felt his whole face warm with embarrassment, even his ears. He quickly turned the dildo off and bundled everything together. The clothes and the latex cock. He rushed upstairs and hid them in the bottom drawer of his dresser. He wasn’t sure what Sherlock’s game was, but he was positive they were both going to have a talk before they went any further.
Magnussen swung the flogger again and the leather straps wrapped around John’s torso. The sound of leather scoring flesh was as loud as the gunshot. John gasped again and flexed in his bonds. The leather fell away and streaks of blood were visible on John’s body. Magnussen struck again and again.
“It was Victor who got him using drugs, wasn’t it?” John finally asked.
“I can’t believe I’m having to explain this to you.” John said shaking his head.
The shouts and cheers were not helping his headache but the operation had been somewhat of a success. Ten of Moriarty’s men had been arrested. Three were in hospital. None of the police had been injured. They had seized evidence of criminal activity ranging from extortion to robbery to murder. There was enough information to keep the courts busy for years. The bad news was Moriarty got away and Sherlock wasn’t there.
“Detective Lestrade, a moment please.”
Sherlock pulled his arm away from his face and looked at John. “Do you?”
The sound of the keys being slipped into locks and bolts being pulled back. The door opened only a few inches and Frankie’s pudgy face appeared.
“Well, this time it’s not about you. It’s about my training. The army will help me become a surgeon. And will pay me to do so. You just need to get over yourself.”
“My friend will be here in half an hour. I am taking Sherlock away from here to some place safe.” John said directly. It was a statement of fact. He was not asking permission from the other alpha.
“You mean if you guide him. No, I refuse to meet him.” Sherlock growled. He spun on his heels and marched across the ballroom to the opposite side.
Sherlock saw a slight flush come to John’s face, before it just as quickly seemed to disappear. John took a hesitant step back. Sherlock returned his attention to the file in front of him. He picked up a report and started reading through it.
John sighed. “No, I’m fine here.”
“I understand . . . I just want you to know that you and William are the most important things to me.”
“As well as two men serving together,” John said. His eyes slid sideways towards Sherlock suspiciously.
“If you two are done being worthless imbeciles, you can take me and my friend home.” Sherlock said as he wrapped his arm around John’s shoulder.
“I wouldn’t bet on that.” John said calmly.
“Unacceptable!” Sherlock shot out of seat and glared at his brother. “I want to be in London now. My studies are stifled here. I need to be there!”
2010 London, England
~221~
Jim raised his dark eyebrows. “Which was?”
“John said! John said! I don’t care what John said. I’m fine. Leave.” Sherlock pouted.
“Fuck.” John growled and took off running down the gangplank. Blackwood and Barr on his heels.
“I just want this over with. As soon as he realizes I’m not guilty, then he can finally go and look for the person who killed James.”
“You fucking liar.” John growled.
He stood up quickly, pushing the metal chair he was sitting in back. It rattled loudly as it scrapped across the pavement. He reached into his jacket and pulled out the gun. He fired once. Sherlock slammed backwards and hit the ground. His black coat spread out around him. The red stain spread across the white shirt.
“No, we go to Magnussen. Tell him his blackmail information is now worthless and he can’t force Mycroft to sell me off.” Sherlock said.
John was tired of being threatened.
Sherlock’s mind flashed back to another photograph Mycroft had shown him years before. The photo of both he and John walking down the Embankment. The two of them were smiling and laughing at something. Sherlock couldn’t remember. It had been late fall and Sherlock was wearing his large black coat and John had on a wool shooter’s jacket Sherlock had bought him. They were happy and nothing was bothering them. The reason Sherlock had lied to John and told him to leave.
“Well, where were you living before you were kidnapped?”
“Oh, okay. So how do you know he didn’t shoot himself then?” John asked feeling very unsure of himself all at once.
“Alright, enough of this. Time for us to go.” Jim clapped his hands. “I have meeting at nine I don’t want to miss.”
Suddenly, the crackle of gunfire made the men duck and rush to the sides of the road. A bullet hit the mudbricks near John and stung his face with shards of broken brick. Bill Murry tripped and fell to the ground with a loud grunt. John reached out and grabbed the webbing on the man’s back and pulled him behind the corner of the building with him.
“I got shot.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Mycroft sighed and rolled his eyes again.
“I’m a soldier just like you, sir.” John said, his voice taking on an edge.
“Yeah, sure. I’m working at St Bart’s now. Just give me call.” John smiled and went to leave.
Sherlock let his fingers slide through John’s short hair, while his mind tried to reason why John was lying to him.
“You won’t collect your thousand pounds if I’m dead.”
WARNING graphic depiction of torture in this chapter.
Sherlock studied John’s expression but read the story behind John’s eyes wrong. He sighed dramatically and frowned. “It wasn’t your fault. Moran was waiting for us. James couldn’t stop him from taking me. You couldn’t have either.”
“Did you call her or Mycroft?” John asked.
John stood up then hesitated. “Let’s just get this over with. I’m tired of being accused of something I didn’t do.”
“It was. And because you were so determined at self-harm, a conservatorship has been set into place. I am your guardian. I will be making your decisions for you.”
“No,” said Sherlock
“I don’t want to leave you, John.”
“I’m not involved with you anymore. You made sure about that. But if you want a different doctor – Drs Bhasin and Gordon are taking care of other patients. They might be able to get to you in three or four hours. Or you can get two units of IV fluids, a CAT scan and then leave.”
“You were to give the memory stick to Smallwood. You were to discredit Holmes.” Moriarty glared at the other man.
“John doesn’t care about me. He has made it very clear that I am nothing to him but an uncooperative patient.” Sherlock said turning away from his brother’s gaze.
Sherlock had no idea when Trevor would return and he couldn’t care less, but for safety sake, he decided to lie.
“What is he doing here?” Sherlock asked nodding to his brother.
John returned to London, unsure what his future held for him. He was required to see a therapist for six months to received his disability from the army. But he felt it was a waste of his time. His tremor grew worse and he started to have nightmares. Everything that once was so familiar to him, now seemed strange and foreign. He went for walks as often has he could because sitting alone in his bedsit only caused him to wish he were dead.
“We were right, John! We were right!”
John’s smile increased. He turned to the British officer and poked him lightly with the tip of his blade.
Moran sighed. He knew Moriarty was doing this on purpose. The more he complained the longer it would take for his boss to acknowledge him.
“You shouldn’t be disappointed, Gregory. Sherlock would have been an inappropriate mate for you.” Mycroft said.
Sherlock went to the counter and ordered his coffee. He waited till the barista prepared the Café Americana before taking the cup and saucer outside to one of the tables on the pavement. He sat down, setting the coffee next to him. Crossing his legs he glanced up and down the street. His eyes quickly categorizing everything surrounding him.
“Yes, a sponge bath in between bouts. I also made sure you ate something and gave you something to drink. I put Arnica on your bruises. How do they feel?”
“He was murdered about a year after you and your sister left. Unsolved. It is believed it was a rival gang but there was some speculation that it might have been someone within his own organization.” Mycroft finished.
John’s nimble fingers undid the buttons and loosened the strings, giving him access to Sherlock’s engorged member. With the first light touch, Sherlock arched his back and brought his hips up to meet John’s hand.
Mycroft disconnected the call. He glanced up to see John and Sherlock had disappeared into the bedroom. He knew this was a better situation than Trevor, but he was certain it wasn’t the best for Sherlock. He knew he would be called back here again to fix this problem too.
“You could just sleep with her. No commitments. No promises.” Sherlock’s eyes were locked on the computer screen but his attention was on John.
“Because Adams wouldn’t let me take a specimen from the morgue.”
“Mummy, as always . . . very stimulating seeing you.”
Sherlock still had the sheet wrapped around his body, as he sat with his legs crossed and defiantly refused to look at the intruder.
“If I remember correctly, you turned that offer down.” Jim laughed condescendingly.
Sherlock blinked trying to decipher John’s comment.
“Visitors? When do I get visitors? Who would visit me? If you are speaking of my interfering brother, I would be thankful if you kept him away from me.” Sherlock returned to his sulk.
“Is it really that important to you?” Sherlock asked.
“Hell, your friend is probably sleeping it off if he ain’t prick deep in one of the girls.”
John growled and his hand twitched again for want of a weapon. Magnussen noticed and smirked.
“I might have had to tolerate foolish behavior from your father, but I refuse to allow the two of you to act like children. Sherlock, give the thumb drive to Mycroft. Mycroft will keep his end of the bargain.”
Sherlock noticed it and glance up at her quickly, then looked back at the computer screen. John turned and smiled up at the young woman. She smiled back.
“I need to stop my brother. I need to make sure James Moriarty can’t hurt anyone else important to me.”
Several messages started to come through. One said he was at the Tower. Another claimed they saw him walking into the National Gallery. John quickly disregarded them. Two came in saying they had seen him with two men. One was near the Enclave and the other was on Waterloo Bridge.
“OH MY GOD! Sherlock we’ve had sex in nearly every room!”
“You can protect him. You can keep him safe.” Sherlock pleaded.
“Do you know this John Watson?”
“I sent your men on an errand. I need your attention, Sherlock.”
The conversation quickly came back to John. He was having a very difficult time with the class and was falling behind badly. If he didn’t quickly pick up the information he was going to fail and then there would be another reason to worry about losing his scholarship.
Sherlock glanced up at the man. Greg could tell the omega was upset. For a brief moment there was a softness to Greg’s expression. Compassion for the burden Sherlock was enduring, then it replaced by the determined and emotionless face of the policeman.
“Her eyes.” Sherlock said.
Their sex did continue and often. But Moran found himself being fucked as much as he was fucking the dark haired omega. There was no passion or sharing or raw aggression. He discovered, James enjoyed humiliating his partners in bed. Moran had refused to be tied up and beaten by the small omega, but he was required to sit and watch as James did it to other alphas. Alpha business partners who had failed to follow through with their promises to James. James relished gaging these alphas and using his various crops and whips on them. The alphas so ashamed, they never told anyone of their assaults.
Moriarty laughed. The sound made John shiver as if he was plunged into ice water.
The drill sergeant glanced sideways at John then told the men to reload. He stood behind John and watched the young man fumble as he slipped the cartridges into the magazine, then push the magazine into the gun.
“Well, he might have been prohibited from avoiding to speak to me.” Mycroft mused.
John took a moment to study the wall and it’s patchwork of cuttings. There were newspaper clippings about robberies and drug confiscations. There were two ‘missing persons’ articles as well.
“I’m the one going out. You brought him here, you deal with him.” James said. “Anything special you want to see him in?”
Victor stood up slowly. His hand clutching at his broken nose. Blood streaking down his suit and staining his white shirt.
Sherlock took the card and looked at the name. Isabella didn’t wait for an acknowledgement from either man. She turned on her black high heel pumps and marched down the hall. People stepping out of her way as she passed.
“What do you want, Major.” The morphine had lowered John’s inhibitions.
“She would want to bond. She’s the type who would want a family and security and . . . everything that goes with it.” John said as he pushed the half eaten pie away.
“Names? How many are there? Anything?” Lestrade was texting as he spoke.
“I called him and told him what had happened. I’ve never met her but have heard about her,” said Sherlock, still staring down at the embossed card.
“Handsome . . . beautiful isn’t used to describe males.” Sherlock said. His voice sounded like brittle glass.
Sherlock resumed his seat. His eyes fixed on the photo. “Was there anything else in the letter?”
“What happened? Why aren’t you taking me back to Barbados?”
Mycroft Holmes power started with his father, Siger Holmes. Mycroft was born the year after Charles II and his brother James had returned to England. Siger had worked hard to return the monarchy to England. He was proud to have aided Charles and James’ return.
“Maybe . . . I don’t know.” John shook his head. He never actually saw Sherlock answer any of the texts. He didn’t go out looking for her once he knew she was alive. And she kissed him, not the other way around. “Seb, I just don’t want to think about it anymore. Please . . . can we talk about something else? How are things in Sangin for you all now?”
Sherlock watched. “Three months and then the rest of your life, John.” The train started to pull out of the station. “Goodbye.”
“You can hand out the money yourself. You don’t need me there.” Sherlock pouted.
“London,” John said.
“You wouldn’t dare!” Sherlock shouted.
“Cocaine, elevating heart and respiration leading to cardiac tamponade and death. Heroin suppresses respiration and smooth muscle function leading to death.” John recited from the textbooks on drug addiction.
John’s mind sparked out at the image of him pumping into Sherlock perfectly formed arse. A sane normal alpha would never allow it . . . but Sherlock. Every omega’s dream and Sherlock was offering it to John.
It all sounded so sensible to John. So logical.
Sherlock thought to himself. It was so obvious a trap but he was certain that Moriarty wouldn’t pass up the chance to taunt him in person either.
Sherlock looked straight into Moran’s water grey eyes. He saw the ageless need there. The want and desire he was sure was reflected in his own eyes.
“I will have his head on a spike at London’s Gate. Right beside William’s. And my ungrateful bitch of a daughter will spend the rest of her miserable life in the Tower.”
“Never.”
“Was it?” Sherlock asked surprised.
“Where have you been?” Sherlock growled as he moved down John’s neck. Biting into the muscles that connected John’s neck and shoulder.
“Because of me.” John said from the couch. Mycroft glanced back at him. “I’m a . . . a medical student. We were at a party last night and Sherlock realized they were selling drugs there. He got me out before the police arrived. If I had been arrested, I would have been kicked out of school. I wouldn’t be able to sit for my boards.”
John alternated flexing his fingers, giving a rippling effect up the man length. Sherlock closed his eyes and tipped his head back against the edge of the tub. He let out a deep groan as his hand tightened around John’s arms.
Suddenly John was hit with apprehension. He had left Sherlock alone downstairs. He wondered if Sherlock was still there waiting for him. Would Sherlock have taken one of the prostitutes for the night? Would he want to? Would the prostitute be woman or man?
“It was the only sculpture he made there.” Greg said as retrieved another bottle of beer. “Stupid looking thing that had lights in the base that changed colors.”
“Read what it says.”
“I believe he was expecting to be invited in,” Anthea said quietly as her employer climbed the few steps up to the door.
The sound of a woman’s gasp came across the room. Not from Irene but from the shadows. The sound of Sherlock’s phone. John felt the bottom of his world fall out. He heard the sound of solid steady footsteps walking away. John took a step to follow but Irene held up her hand.
Sherlock rose with incredible speed and grace. He rapidly grabbed Mycroft’s wrist and twisted. The man grunted and turned as his arm was rotated up and behind his back. Mycroft hissed as Sherlock shoved him forward and into the edge of the door jam. The wooden corner bruising the alpha’s pale skin.
“Yes, just cases. Nothing special. So, the doctors told the family I should be allowed to visit. And I did. I brought cold case files for him to read through. He seemed to devour them like . . .” Lestrade tried to find a good description.
Mycroft’s responsibilities ranged from foreign and domestic affairs. His analysis was valuable in manipulating the international money markets and foreign elections. He maintained a firm grip on the intelligence community as well as the military. His decisions directed the leaders who directed the country.
“Cullen check with Stamford and see how many wounded. I want this ship fighting fit by morning.” John shouted. “Well done, McMath!”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said drawing his brother’s attention. “There is no connection between Elizabeth and this Cavendish. Her family wouldn’t arrange her murder.”
“Yeah, but we lost touch with each other years ago.”
Blackwood and McMath held him down on the deck.
“Lestrade. Greg Lestrade.” The British officer said between gasps. “And I’m an officer in the British Navy. You can not take me as your prisoner.”
“Because of me?” Sherlock pressed.
John leaned up on his elbow and watched the omega, “Sherlock?”
“Either.”
“GET OFF ME!” The woman screamed.
John's deployment
Sebastian Moran quickly pulled the gun from behind his back. He fired twice. Both rounds punctured holes in the attorney’s chest. Crimson blood oozed from the holes and stained the white shirt.
“I believe we may have to intervene for the doctor’s safety again.”
John’s legs seemed to no longer support the doctor’s weight. He weaved slightly then collapsed into the chair next to Sherlock.
Sholto watched as John disregarded his own safety to save the young man’s life. He was amazed. He had never seen a new recruit so fearless or so determined as John was. When John crawled back into the truck with him, Sholto growled, “Get them out of here!”
“I know. I feel it too.” John said as he closed the distance to the Colonel.
“Sherlock!” The voice was sharp and demanding and Sherlock didn’t like it.
“It was my fault,” Sherlock said.
“Babcock made it different. Time has made it different. If we . . . well we can’t for the sake of the Morstan and her crew. We can’t.”
“Like Mycroft?” Sherlock asked. He slowly rubbed his cheek.
“Finally,” Sherlock sighed. He was going to have to owe Jim this time. Sherlock wasn’t in the mood to get down on his knees for the man and sure as hell wasn’t going to let Jim fuck him.
“I want to spend hours taking you apart. Watching you.”
John was shaking. He grabbed the edge of the table to help steady himself. He squared his shoulders and pulled his body into military attention.
Sherlock took off and leaped down the main deck. He didn’t even use the stairs. He ran across the deck as the crew prepared the Morstan for battle. The cannon fire from the other ships was getting louder as they approached. Sherlock ran up the steps to the forecastle into the gun room. Blackwood and his men were loading muskets and pistols.
“Mornin’.” Sholto replied.
The leather seats were soft as butter as he sat down. His hand slid across the cool upholstery. The air conditioner was blowing cold air throughout the passenger compartment. The man sitting next to Greg had on his dark brown suit with a pale cream colored silk shirt. Greg had an incredible strong desire to drag his fingertips across the smooth fabric. Mycroft’s wine red tie was immaculately knotted and tucked into his waistcoat.
Overwhelmed with a need to do something - anything, John stood up and stormed into the bathroom. Sherlock heard the water running in the sink then the crash of something falling out of the medicine cabinet. He took two hesitant steps towards the bathroom door when John marched out. In his hand he had his shaving kit. He tossed it on the bed and went to the wardrobe. He pulled his jeans back on without even putting on his pants. He grabbed a jersey and pulled it on over his head. Then John grabbed his clothes out of the cupboard and tossed them on the bed too.
“Neither will I.”
“Rather Machiavellian.” John mused.
“Thank you, but do not worry yourself. Sherlock will not be remaining here long. I’m having him transferred.”
John turned back and looked at Sherlock. He raised a questioning eyebrow.
John’s fingers massaged over Sherlock’s balls – lightly pulling on them as he listened to Sherlock’s groans. His finger moved further back and over the taut skin behind them. Sherlock bucked in John’s arms. A quick moment of tense muscles before melting further into John’s embrace.
Moran nodded his head. Both the attorney and the accountant relaxed.
“Not him, doc.” Ryan said as he pushed John into the backseat of a waiting car. “The blonde one. The one with a scar.”
The men in the small boat were surprised by their captain’s actions. For a moment they sat still at the oars. Then James shouted.
Greg glanced at the man lying on the floor of the crack house. He was wearing brown trousers and rather new looking trainers. He had on a dirty button down shirt but no coat. Greg looked back at the young man and raised an eyebrow.
“Her name was Mary. She was a nurse.” John whispered. He leaned back in his chair. “It was before I joined the army. We worked together at the same hospital. I met her one night at work. Some idiot jumped out a third story window and changed his mind on the way down. Landed on his feet. He broke every bone from his pelvis down. We worked the case together. She was smart and funny. She made me laugh as we put this guy back together again. A week later we went out on our first date. A month later we were living together.”
“John, you keep telling everyone you are not gay.”
“You idiot! You fucking son of a bitch!” John growled.
“Whoever she was, she was idiot for letting you go.” Mary said softly as she took a step back.
“He lied to us. He doesn’t have two cents to rub together let alone two thousand pounds.” John turned to face his friend. “He’ll sleep with the crew and work for his passage to St. Thomas. Treat him like anyone of the deckhands.”
“How do you know it was my father that was pawning the watch?”
“I don’t understand why you think I would go with you.” John repeated himself.
The dark haired boy returned to John’s lips and let John’s tongue move into his mouth. The two men caressed and massaged each other. The tension that had been building and the adrenaline that carried them on for the last few hours burned through their veins like gasoline. They were starving men finally allowed to sit at a banquet.
“Shrapnel?” Hinde asked.
Sherlock didn’t wait this time. He stood up and went to John’s chair. He knelt down in front of the man.
“What do you mean?”
Down the hall he could still hear the two men arguing. Moran smiled as he wheeled John to the lift. He waited for the door to open then he quickly wheeled the unconscious man into the lift and off the floor. The doors were closing when the second lift pinged, announcing its arrival. Moran watched as an elderly couple walked passed the closing doors. They were carrying some plant with blue flowers.
“Mister Holmes is not my omega.” John said quietly.
“Mister Holmes, you will be needing to come with us to New Scotland Yard. There are some questions we need to be asking you. You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence." Dimmit said.
“You’ve been unconscious for thirty-six hours. Sleep was the best thing for you but now it is time to get to work.” She closed the binder and set it back down. “Detox, group therapy and rehabilitation.”
“I recommend you don’t get too close to my brother. It seems that the two of them are . . . involved. Doctor Watson has become very possessive of my brother. He put two of my security men in hospital this evening when they attempted to remove Sherlock from Doctor Watson’s home.”
He wrapped his hand behind Sherlock’s neck and pulled the omega’s face up towards his. The kiss was messy again. The two men slightly out of sync with each other. It took a moment for Sherlock to catch up with John then to take over the kiss.
“Sherlock you don’t need to . . .” John was surprised by the sudden giggle that escaped his mouth. Sherlock ignored him and flung his giant black coat on.
“I sincerely doubt that.” Sherlock sneered.
“Yes it was. Totally. And you know it was amazing.” John smiled at the omega.
“Mycroft! What’s happened?!” John was frantic.
James frowned. “It was long time ago, John. The Admiralty believes Underwood was killed by the Dutch.”
Sherlock turned and looked at the older man. The years had not been kind to Frankie. Always a heavyset man, Frankie was now obese. His pasty skin sagged over thick jowls. His eye seemed to sink into his head as thick shaggy grey eyebrows divided his face from his receding hairline.
John nodded his head.
John was smirking at the alpha but Sherlock obeyed John and leaned forward tentatively. Their lips kissed. A gently brush of sensitive skin. An encounter of warm breathe on skin. Then Sherlock pulled back and looked at John.
John looked up at the man, then mirrored the smile. He took the final step that brought the two of them together. John tipped his head slightly to the side and Seb leaned down to meet his lips. Seb could feel the pressure release in his chest. John still trusted him. He still could keep John with him.
“If I had shot him, John, I wouldn’t be worried about him contacting you. He would be dead.” Sherlock answered sincerely. It hurt even more to know John seemed to be more concerned with Moran’s safety than his own.
“I will have to agree with John. Victor, you are not wanted here. Leave and quickly before it becomes uncomfortable for you.”
“Please, Jawn . . . I want to feel your knot.”
“Enjoying myself.”
“Knife.” John waved at the dead body a few paces off from him.
Sherlock went through detox rather quickly. His body metabolized the drugs rapidly. The rehabilitation portion of his treatment was far more difficult. After two months, not much had changed regarding his attitude to the whole situation.
“Yes, I’m studying medicine.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “No, John. Just for the time being. No strings. You can sleep on the couch. It’s just temporary.”
Greg smiled again. “His nephew was sick.”
John looked up at the older man and smirked. “Is there anything else, sir?”
Sherlock shook. He hoped John would never hear that. He knew how much John would blame himself if he did.
Greg followed the young man as several other uniform officers spread out behind them. Wright and Greg walked down a dark hallway and into what looked like a machine workshop. Massive machines stood silent and rusting. Stacked next to an ancient drill press were a dozen cardboard boxes. The names of various cigarette manufactures were printed on the outside of them.
“What took you so long?” Sherlock whispered as he leaned forward wanting a kiss. He hesitated for John’s reply.
Sherlock turned the eight by eleven sheet of paper over and read the few words written there in primitive block letters.
Sherlock smacked the picture frame on the edge of the table. The glass broke and the frame bent. He pulled the photograph out of the debris and held it up to look at it again. Then he slipped it into his coat pocket. He pulled out his phone and key and dropped them on the floor. He walked out of the flat and into the world. Alone.
Blackwood and his men quickly jumped from the deck of the Morstan and onto the Band. There was shouting and pistol shots. The sound of metal hitting metal. Of men dying.
“What is taking so long?” James Stuart asked.
Mycroft turned away from his brother, hiding his reaction. “There might have been threats.”
Sherlock had heard the crew talk about the ship that John and James had served on. He knew it had sunk several years ago off the Azores.
“Yes, yes. I did.” John nodded and got out the taxi. He gave the building a quick glance then his eyes scanned up and down the street.
John swallowed audibly before he struggled to answer. “He asked me in Sangin to marry him. I said no. That’s the reason I sitting outside the camp walls when I was shot.”
“Not exactly.”
“Just get out . . . both of you. I’m tired of this. I’m tired of being treated like a child.” John said.
“He won’t say sir, but he has brought two coffees with him.”
Sherlock came into his flat to find his flat-mate, Victor Trevor, sprawled across their couch. The omega was still wearing his dressing gown and pajamas. An ashtray with several stubbed out cigarettes butts was sitting on Victor’s chest.
“I don’t want you to work there.”
John Watson had grown to trust Blackwood completely. On the Morstan, he was given the unofficial rank of officer. He helped with planning of raids and led his own squad of muskets. He had more freedom and responsibility than he ever had in the King’s Navy. This evening, he was taking the Middle Watch. From midnight to four in the morning. The ship was silent and asleep. The only sound was the occasional rustling of the canvas sails and Blackwood’s footsteps on the boards.
“Right handed people don’t shoot themselves us with their left hand.”
“It was planned out perfectly. And had been planned for months.” Sherlock smiled as he picked up the photo of the sculpture again. “Has anyone been allowed into the crime scene since the theft?”
“I told you he is not my boyfriend. I won’t go with you, Seb. I don’t know why you think I would.” John said coldly.
Frankie went behind the bar and turned on some switches. The lighting under the bar came on as Frankie started to fill a carafe with water.
“Yes . . .”
“I’m not a strong enough alpha for your scent to be stimulated?”
James tipped his chin up defiantly. John continued.
Mycroft wondered how his mother knew Magnussen was already dead. ‘
“You were correct in that the drug test showed I had been given something similar to rohypnol. Thank you for encouraging them to perform the test before the drug had left my system. But that is not the reason I’m here.” Mycroft paused as he tried to find the correct words and phrases.
Mycroft Holmes walked down the halls of his office noticing the change in everyone. Before his arrest, the crowd of government workers would part in front of him like the proverbial Red Sea. They would stop their conversations and stare as if the Queen herself was passing by. But now the workers who lined the halls appeared to be indifferent to him, except for the hushed whispers as he passed. He could feel himself losing his temper as he heard more than one person laugh at him and several comments about deviance.
John watched as the woman’s finger moved and the gun clicked. Dry fired. John released the breath he was holding and slumped in the chair.
“John, please sit down.” Greg said.
“Really, Sherlock.” Mycroft pouted.
John and Sherlock get to see St. Elmo's Fire
“I’m sorry, sir, but I was surprised to see him here. I mean I saw him last night at the club and here he is this morning. What happened?” John asked as he realized he had made a terrible mistake in front of his professor. The man prided himself on his detachment from his patients.
John Watson held the Browning up and aimed at the target thirty yards away.
John didn’t hesitate, he got into the car.
Moriarty discusses his final plans for Mycroft Holmes while Moran makes plans for Sherlock.
“Do you think he will believe you? If the tables were turned, would you believe such a story.”
Sherlock remained in his seat for two seconds before he leaped up. John moaned and hid his face in his hands as Sherlock walked down the steps to the podium and stared the lecturer in the face. Then he turned to the class and said.
“That’s a semi-automatic, if you fire it the bullet will travel over a thousand meters per second.”
Mycroft Holmes had proved to Detective Lestrade he was completely innocent of the man’s death. That had been the encouragement Greg needed to proceed with a relationship with Holmes. He had read the reports that listed Mycroft Holmes as a person of interest in several crimes, but he didn’t see any direct evidence linking the man to any illegal activities. There were whispers and hints but nothing that could actually be followed or even considered plausible testimony.
“And he’s not bad on the eyes either.” Mike said with a smile as he took his first bite of cake.
“Marriage.”
“Does it hurt?” Sherlock looked up into John’s face.
“Maybe that would be a good thing,” James said as he poured himself another cup. He sipped the liquor from his own tin cup.
“It’s the very best place for it.” Mary laughed softly. “And who said it has to be romance, why can’t it just be what ever it will be?”
Dimmit looked at the photos. It was the front door of the building and the pavement. A tall man with blonde had was walking out of the door. In the next photo, the man’s face was more visible. He was older than John. Taller and broader in the shoulders. He wore a bulky dark green canvas coat and a black ball cap. He was putting on a pair of yellow tinted glasses. The next photo was the man walking away from the door.
John turned around, glad to know that the subject of their previous conversation was dismissed. He fixed the coffee.
“I don’t tolerate threats.”
“Get to the Langham, now. I’ll explain there.” Lestrade disconnected the call.
“You’ve known the man just over a week and you are giving him advice about him and his boyfriend?” Lestrade asked.
“So you and your flat-mate are . . .”
“What can I get you, mate?” Moran asked pretending to not know who he was.
He couldn’t sit up. He struggled to pull himself off the bed. He fell to the floor with a crash. Victor heard a door open and the sound of someone entering the room.
“Imagine how our dear brother, Mycroft will react to the news.” Jim’s dark eyes gleamed in delight.
“Are we here to see the queen?” John asked.
The game continued for several hours. It was down to Humphrey, Mary and John. John hadn’t embarrassed himself at all. Winning often but not the most. That would be Mary Morstan. Humphrey was down to his last chips. The Jack of clubs, nine of hearts, seven of hearts, seven of clubs, three of hearts and ace of hearts was on the table. Humphrey left his cards on the table and only lifted the corner of them to look at them. He finally smiled and pushed the last of his chips in.
A rumbling groan broke free from John’s chest and he started to pull the tall man back down to him.
“Yes, two sons. Mycroft and Sherlock.”
Sherlock turned and looked at John. A superior expression on his face. “I knew what I was doing. I wouldn’t have suffered long term effects.”
The taxi pulled over some distance from the crime scene. The dark street had been cordoned off with the blue and white police tape. It had rained earlier in the evening and the red and blue lights from several panda cars reflected back. The stark glare drained the color from the faces of small crowd of gawkers lined up to watch. John slipped into the crowd and watched as investigators in blue coveralls walked in and out of the abandoned building.
He thought his voice sounded muffled, like he was speaking from under a blanket. He felt the sound would not travel across the small space to the other man. Sherlock didn’t look up at John. Instead, he picked up an empty envelope that once had newspaper clipping in it. The sour smell of news print ink still clung to the paper.
“You bastard.” But there was heat in John’s words. He smiled broadly. All the way up to his eyes.
“And he shot James?” John asked.
John blinked then sighed. “He wasn’t. I promise you. He was just someone who died on the Maywand.”
Barr looked around at the men getting into the two other long boats. “Are you sure, Captain. Maybe we should keep most of the men on board.”
Sherlock refused to be intimidated. He remained still.
“Getting our position.” John said. “It’s a big ocean. I need to know we are headed in the correct direction.”
“There’s a dead rat in here!” John shouted.
“Not anymore. Not now,” he whispered.
“Yes, have you acquired the project?” Mycroft asked remember he had sent Jocko to find Jim Moriarty and hold him.
“Jim Moriarty was bat shite crazy. He treated people like objects. Not real. I didn’t want you to get caught in any crossfire. When you left for the army, I thought it was for the best. And as for Sherlock,” He nodded his head towards the other man. “It really didn’t matter any more to me what ‘appened to ‘im. Moriarty could ‘ave ‘im as far as I cared.”
“Well, when he ‘eard, he was going to cut you from the team. I sent some boys over to explain to ‘im that was a bad idea.”
“This isn’t over, Mycroft. I refuse to stay here.”
Mike noticed John blush slightly. He set his sandwich down and stared at his friend. “Or was it you who did something?”
Thank you for your comments and kudos. The story is almost over. Just a few more chapters. I hope you will continue to read it.
Around them, the unknowing audience shouted and screamed. Many had started to flee the auditorium. The sound of running feet and shouts accompanied the sounds of the fight.
“Two thousand pounds – sterling.” The stranger said. He opened his eyes and stared up into John’s. They were the most remarkable color that John had ever seen.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He is safe for the time being. Well, when I say safe, he is not being . . . overtly harmed. I’m sure the men he is with are entertaining him. I found out he was very popular when he was in the army. Did you know that? He did love being fucked by a man in a uniform.”
I know not a lot of plot for Sherlock and John in the last two chapters but I wanted Moran's story to be a counter point to their story. Things are going to pick up soon plot wise for the two boys.
“Sherlock what?” John felt like he was listening through quicksand to the strange omega.
“Have you even ever held a gun?” Colonel Bennet asked condescendingly.
The man went to grabbed Eddy when Sean McMillian reached over and blocked the man’s punch. “It was just an accident, man, don’t go crazy or nothing.”
“Full sails!” John shouted.
~221~
~^+^~
“What do you mean?”
“I don’t know . . . have you changed your mind about alphas?” John asked in return.
“I believe we can convince him the ‘Spider’ is dead. He was murdered in prison.” Sherlock glanced sideways at Frankie. “Your doing?”
“If the network is destroyed, Mycroft will believe Moriarty was in charge.”
“Sherlock knew as soon as he saw them speaking to you. He spoke to them later, when you weren’t around. He said Margery’s sole aspiration was to be a ‘Page three girl,’ and he told Norma she was so stupid she thought the capital of France was F. That you wouldn’t want anything to do with the likes of them accept to get a leg over.”
John’s voice played out in Sherlock’s head.
John huffed and pinched the arm wrapped around him.
“Sherlock, did something happen? I mean, are you alright?” John couldn’t believe how small his voice sounded. He growled deeply. He didn’t understand why the omega was rejecting him.
“Clear!”
Sherlock’s eyes were wild with fear. The same frightened expression he had when their father had walked out on them twenty-two years before. Sherlock was only three. He didn’t understand where their father had gone. He didn’t know why their mother was crying. Mycroft was fourteen but far more mature than the adults he lived with. He understood. He knew about the omega his father had been having an affair with. The reason for Signer’s departure.
“Who is this?”
“I am very aware of the fact that you are completely innocent in this situation.” Mycroft lied again. He wasn’t sure but he sincerely doubted that she would implicate herself by sending him a note luring him there if she knew about Victor’s dead body.
“John!?” Sherlock gasped excitedly. “I can walk!”
“Sherlock, please sit down! This is important!”
“And you wanted to kiss me back?” John pushed. A small smile playing at the corners of his mouth. Maybe Mike was right. Maybe he had been missing things around here.
“Climb!” John shouted.
“If he is able to land in England and march here unopposed, nothing, not even Parliament will stop him from retaking the throne and placing the two of you in prison.” Mycroft said firmly.
Sherlock quickly had his kit off and handed it over to the boy. The young boy rushed from the room leaving Sherlock alone with the bucket of water and McMath’s clothes. Sherlock dipped a flannel into the water then wiped his face with the cool water. It felt wonderful. He dipped the rag back into the water again and brought it up saturated to his face. The cool water dripped down his cheeks and onto his chest. It raised gooseflesh. He wiped his brow then down the back of his neck. He closed his eyes relishing the relief the simple act of washing up brought.
“RAMC.” John answered taking the beer and sipping it. The two shots of scotch had warmed John nicely and he was beginning to feel good inside. “Medical discharged. Gunshot wound.”
“What?” John asked.
’. Everyone on the quay was watching as McMath was reloading the small cannon.
He was three blocks away from the building where Sherlock lived when he noticed the dark saloon driving beside him slowly. John glanced over and thought immediately it was Ryan sent to pick him up and take him back to the St. Bart’s. John didn’t hesitate when he opened the back door and slipped into the leather seats.
“I’ve been reading John’s journals. He’s leaned things about healing with plants and various chemical compounds. He understands about medicines. He’s been collecting formularies.”
John climbed the stairs after the first day of classes for the semester wondering if he should have a very intense conversation with Sherlock. He was petrified as to what was going on. He wanted to know where Sherlock went to whenever he left the flat. He also wanted to know why Sherlock had alibied Jim when the police questioned him. John was afraid Sherlock was selling drugs for the man. He needed to know where he stood with Sherlock because things were about to change for them.
“No reason to call in your attack dogs, Mycroft. I sincerely doubt I will ever see Captain John Watson again.” Sherlock slipped the file under his coat. He would read it later, when he was alone.
“From the someone who wants to meet you.”
In Sherlock’s mind palace, he sat down in the leather chair in John’s room. His eyes moved from one picture to another. There were far too few framed moments on the walls. He wanted more information about John. He needed it. His eyes glanced over at the thick manila envelope on the imaginary table beside him. It was still fastened closed with Mycroft’s ostentatious sealing wax over the flap.
Mycroft Holmes was a very busy man. He always stated he maintained a minor position within the British Government, while Sherlock claimed he was the British Government. Sherlock was closer to the truth than Mycroft was. Mycroft’s exact title was a state secret. Less than five people in the country actually knew what it was and that included the Prime Minister and the Queen.
“Alright, but why murder?” Greg shrugged his shoulders.
“No, not really. We didn’t give him all the money. We kept most of it for ourselves. The next time it was rigged poker game we robbed. Then another and another. Some guys from the squad hooked up with us for our biggest score, a casino. Then it just grew from there.”
John thought.
“I worked a late shift so I didn’t get up until after half-past ten. Went for a run around the neighborhood, then ate lunch. Sherlock came by for about ten minutes then left. Around six the constables picked me up at my flat and brought me here. I’ve been here since then.” John glared back at Dimmit.
“I HAD BAD DAYS!”
“Gentlemen, is everything ready?” Jim Moriarty asked as a greeting.
“Isn’t it obvious . . .” Sherlock said as he stepped closer.
2017       Moran walked into the pub near the Barbican Theater. He had a smile on his face because of the fantastic shag he had earlier in the day. He had left John’s flat while the doctor got ready for his shift. The two men had fucked twice during the day, and John gave him a blow job while they had showered. Moran knew John was hesitant about the sex but everything was working to plan. In just a few more days, Moriarty and Moran could spring the trap on Holmes. Then maybe afterwards, he could arrange things differently for him and John.
“Darling, I’m sorry all that happened to you. And I’m sorry that you have doubts. But never doubt you are loved now. Never question that you are valuable to me. It’s difficult being a parent. Sometimes very scary and some people can’t handle the responsibility. But that’s the past. It can’t hurt you now. I won’t let it. You are mine, now. I will keep you safe. I will never leave you. I will never abandon you.”
John was beginning to feel very exposed. “Yes.”
“JOHN! ARE YOU HURT?!” Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulders.
“Seb . . . you can’t take me away from my child . . . please.”
Also no one commented on him no longer walking with his cane. It seemed he had left it in Ryan’s car. He didn’t want to waste time thinking why he didn’t need it since the night he thought he was going to die. There was something about the fear and exhilaration of being in danger that seemed to invigorate John and cure him of his limp. He knew if he told his therapist, Ella, she who have told him it was a psychosomatic limp and he never needed the cane in the first place.
He waited until the dead body was removed and Moran came back in.
Sherlock was quickly putting the watch back together as John was yelling at McMath. When McMath left, John turned to attention and anger towards Sherlock.
James shrugged his shoulders at John. Apparently the cryptic answer wasn’t what John wanted. James looked around the strange sitting room. Across the walls and pinned to the fireplace mantle were photographs and maps. The photos were of graffiti. Chinese appearing letters or figures in yellow paint. He stepped over and looked over Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Well.” Sherlock rushed out of the darkness and crashed a lead pipe into the head of the man walking down the tunnel. “The radius curvature of these walls is nearly four meters. If you miss the bullet will ricochet. Could hit anyone, might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you.”
“Stay with me.” John said.
“Sherlock – if you don’t engage with your therapy, you will never be able to leave here.” Dr. Owens said.
John let his tongue lick over Sherlock’s lips and felt the younger man shiver underneath him. Sherlock pulled John closer so he was laying on top of Sherlock. With his hand free to roam, John let his stroke down Sherlock’s side - feeling the lean muscles of the young man’s body. Listening as Sherlock groaned and twisted under him.
Moran was about to follow them when he received a text. He pulled out his mobile and saw that it was from James.
“You know you really don’t look anything like your mother.” Jim said.
“Maybe I just like Chinese circuses.” John offered.
“What has happened to Sherlock?”
“Bring him.” He waved at Sherlock.
Stapleton’s attention fixed on Mycroft Holmes.
“Sir Henry, the queen’s request.” Stapleton reminded his master.
“It is unclear what exactly happened, but it is believed that Mister Mycroft Holmes attempted to commit suicide. You will remember Holmes was the prime suspect in the murder of the omega Victor Trevor last week, but Scotland Yard didn’t feel able to file charges against him. Mister Holmes’ mother was murdered just a few days ago and speculation is that he was also involved in her death. This might be the reason why Mister Holmes attempted to take his own life.”
“I’m here, Sherlock. I’m awake.” John struggled to say. His mouth felt so terribly dry. He felt weak and his shoulder still felt like it was on fire. “Water . . .” he croaked.
“Lovers?” John asked. “We’ve slept together but I wouldn’t say we are lovers.”
John turned to Lestrade. “Sir, your ship?”
“What about Lady Smallwood? You did promise.” Smith leaned into the man.
“Your brother tried to kill himself. Yes, yes, I know that most drug overdoses are mistakes but I don’t believe that is the case this time. I believe your brother wanted to not wake up. He may deny it but the quantity of heroin was sufficient to kill him.”
“That is a good question. Individuals jealous of me in the government wouldn’t know about Victor and Sherlock sharing a flat. Those who would know about the connection between Sherlock and Victor wouldn’t know about the defense analyst and the Bruce-Parrington Plans. And murdering our mother? I can’t think of anyone who would want to destroy me like that . . . except. . .”
“If we go to England we will never learn the identity of whomever sent Magnussen after me.”
John turned and walked up to the stranger laying on the deck still wrapped in his chains.
John went into the shower room and stepped under one of the shower heads. He turned it on and enjoyed the blast of hot water on his skin. Several other players were already showering. They were laughing and congratulating each other on a great game. Several men slapped John in good nature as they walked passed.
John smiled. “Oh . . . I didn’t . . . of course. I think there is more than enough room for both of us in here.”
Something inside the sack smelled delicious and Mycroft’s stomach growled.
Sherlock leaped up off his chair and stalked over to John.
The music stopped and the young man quickly spun around to see John dressed and standing there watching him.
“Probable if you do not act.” Mycroft pressed.
“Mycroft wanted him dead. Monty had been skimming off money from his business with Mycroft. Mrs. Hudson learned about the money when she discovered he was sleeping with the dancers at his club. He assaulted her. Domestic violence. She was distraught. I was ordered to kill him. I couldn’t . . . I couldn’t kill him myself, but I knew I couldn’t leave him alive. He would just hurt her again. So I found another option.”
Dimmit had brought him to the Met and took away his wallet and phone. He put John into the interrogation room then left; saying he would return shortly. John wasn’t sure how long he had been waiting, but he was sure it was over half an hour. He shifted in the hard chair for the ‘umpteenth’ time. He was beginning to panic.
John hesitated and then stumbled getting out of the taxi. He paused on the street, again looking up at the sign. He remembered when it said the ‘Frankie’s Backdoor.’ It seemed like a lifetime before. Maybe it was.
“We served together.”
“I don’t know what you mean.” John replied. The ‘
“We aren’t Victorian, Mister Smith. I sincerely doubt anyone would care now.” But Mycroft knew that was wrong. As modern as England was, there were still certain things that Royals and politicians were not supposed to do. Drugs, sex and illegitimacy were amongst them.
“Very much so.”
“It’s not like that, Mike.”
The orderlies lifted the kid from the man’s arms and set him on a gurney. John already had his stethoscope out and listening to the boy’s breathing and heart.
The oil lamp swung gentle in the corner with the movement of the ship. It cast the room in a warm golden glow. After dinner, John had opened the door leading out to the balcony and the Caribbean air was scented with flowers and salt. It was warm in the cabin. Warm and humid.
sorry this is late getting updated. Internet problems.
“You don’t see it do you?”
The two men were back at the house John and James were renting. Mycroft having begrudgingly agreed to let Sherlock stay with John after the two had helped him avoid jail.
Sherlock glanced over at Moran. The man was laying perfectly still. His eyes were open and blood was spreading across his chest and pooling at his sides.
He flipped back to the first picture of Sherlock standing in the living room almost nude. The man’s thin body and square shoulders. The pale brown numbs of his nipples. Moran ran his tongue over his teeth. He wanted to bite those nipples. To suck and nip at them as Sherlock bounced on his lap. Then it hit. Moran climaxed. His hand covered in his hot semen as his hips twisted and rocked. Moran arched his back and groaned softly. A long low growl of ownership.
“What an odious little man.” She said softly.
Greg looked at Sherlock for several seconds then back to John. “You know this sounds insane?”
“Yes, he didn’t find anything.” Lestrade answered the omega.
“Is that what he told you?”
“For Irene? No, she is more interest in sensual compensation and being tied down and whipped in not my idea of a good time.”
“It is there for you to control me.”
Moriarty allowed the alpha a brief moment of superiority.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John wondering if the man was joking. John turned back to Barr who was standing on the deck.
Mycroft glanced up. His usually unflappable assistant was sweating. Her skin was flushed and her eyes wide in fear.
The SAS officer looked up into the policeman’s face. There was a distinctive scar on the side of the policeman’s face. A burn that had healed. The policeman’s eyes were clear blue and sharp. He looked too old to be just a constable.
“Cottle-gear, cottle-gear, cottle-gear . . .”
“You can see he didn’t listen to you.” John waved at his face. “He said he would be back for me. That I was his now.”
“Lavidia has informed me that the bonding will take place before Christmas.”
“John, I won’t be able to . . .”
“Are you asking me or telling me?”
John filled to mugs with tea and bought them out with one plate of food into the sitting room. Setting it down as he walked up to Sherlock and without thinking about it, lightly kissed the other young man’s cheek.
Sherlock stepped closer to John. He wrapped both of his hands around John’s arm. His fingertips digging into the thick corded muscles under the fabric.
“John, please. He knows we are aware of him. He will no longer try to deceive you. He has no reason to . . .”
John was getting more frustrated with her. He was won a game tonight. This was supposed to be a celebration.
Seb was a friend of the bouncers and the bartenders at the club. He got John into the club for free and both of them had been getting free beers all night. Seb had kept bring John drinks, then pulling him back out on to the dance floor. It had been a great night. They had been there for two hours before Seb danced close enough to John to slip his hand around John’s waist. Slowly, he pulled the shorter man closer. John let him. It felt nice to be held again. To feel a strong arm wrapped around his waist and another person move close to him. Two hours and fifteen minutes into the evening, Seb bent down to kiss John for the first time.
John thought Sherlock looked confused but then nodded his head. He glanced over to Blackwood.
“Three hours. I think I know where they might be. James has several safe houses around London.”
Lady Smallwood’s crystal blue eyes locked on Mycroft’s and beckoned him over. Mycroft nodded and walked forcefully towards her. That is when he noticed the dumpy man standing beside her. He was dressed in a florid blue suit with a garish wide pen stripes. His buttoned up waistcoat looked like it was straining to retain the man’s girth. He wore his collar open without a tie. Unbuttoned low enough to show the hint of blond chest hair. The man had a round face that matched his round body. A broad forehead and thinning blond hair. He had sad eyes and the corners of his mouth drooped downward.
“If Trevor put you up to this, you’re going to regret it. I will press charges. I’m not afraid of him. I will make sure that bastard goes to jail.”
John sped up his stokes. The weight and dimensions of Sherlock’s organ growing in his hand. A brief thought that this engorged cock had been inside him repeatedly for the past three days flashed through John’s mind. He felt a tingle slide up his spine at the idea. The realization it would be there again and hopefully soon. John sped up again.
“If it does, we’ll buy you a beer to cry over.” John offered.
John sat up slightly. “Yeah, he was stationed with me in Sangin. He was a major back then and my superior officer.”
“NO!” John snapped. “You won’t keep me.”
“Where are you going?” Greg followed Sherlock
“No, I’m not a . . . oh fuck, Sherlock, don’t stop.” John sagged in Sherlock’s grip. He regained himself. “There were one or two hand-jobs in the locker room and maybe one spectacular blowjob. But I’ve never had a boyfriend.”
“He was not our friend,” John said. He was amazed at how calm he sounded. He was shaking slightly. He could hear the rushing of blood in his ears.
Mycroft felt a stab with the coolness of the greeting. “Detective Inspector Lestrade. It is nice to see you again.”
“I was shot in Sangin just outside of the camp walls. I was med-vac’ed out to Bastion. Then from there to Landstuhl in Germany. An American base. He could have been looking for me but because I was on an American base he couldn’t reach me,” explained John. “After my last surgery, I was discharged in Germany. I received transportation back to England and ended up in London.”
“You are obviously a sapphist.”
The voice was sing-songie. Almost childish in its tone quality. Also, it was familiar. Mycroft forced himself to not open his eyes. He couldn’t react to the man just yet.
Sherlock hummed softly in answer. A train pulled into the station and people stated to get off it.
“And what?” Greg asked.
“Magnussen shot me?” John asked.
“I never beg for mercy in my life . . .” he said to her.
“Like I told him, no reason to keep looking for the thieves. They will probably never commit another crime in London again.” Sherlock refused to look at John.
“What?”
“No, and I say good riddance to the bastard. We don’t need ‘im.”
“No,” John snapped back. “Like you said, there was someone else in the alley. He was following you.”
Captain Jefferson Hope has not given up yet.
“I sincerely doubt that.” Sherlock said indifferently. Sherlock doubted John could hate him more than he already did.
Sherlock laughed darkly. A deep rumble from his chest.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft raised his eyebrows into his hairline.
Moran leaned forward and kissed John’s surprised mouth. John tried to pull away, but Moran slipped his hand behind John’s neck and held him tight. John squirmed and fought to push the alpha away. Moran pulled back as John shouted into the man’s face.
“Do you recognize this? It’s the bill from the Langham. Your signature and a bank card.”
“The evidence would be easily thrown out of court. Nothing he learned could be tied to any ongoing investigations and I felt reasonably certain he wouldn’t betray our previous closeness for the purpose of furthering his career.”
“Seb, I asked you a question . . . who was the omega to you?”
John stepped forward. “There are three other murders that can probably be linked to Smith.”
Mycroft raised both of his eyes in surprise. Greg ignored his surprised expression and kept talking.
John couldn’t be involved with the police. He needed to stay off their radar. The small grey haired woman followed Sherlock up the stairs but John quickly slipped his coat on. He was out the front door and hidden around the corner before Sherlock noticed he was gone.
Jim turned away and started to circle the room again.
Sherlock walked into the hospital room and saw his parents over the baby’s basinet. His mother was transfixed on the small child. Sherlock glanced at the bed and saw it was empty. He quickly looked around the room, expecting to see his mate sitting in the chair.
He then shut his phone off again before Mycroft had enough time to locate it. Sherlock leaned back heavily into the leather seats. He closed his eyes and hoped John was alright.
Sherlock reached over and picked up a bottle of shampoo. He snapped it open and pour a small amount into his palm. Slowly, he smeared the runny shampoo around with his fingers. It was thin and pearly white. It reminded him of semen.
There was no name. there was no direct threat, but Mycroft was still chilled. It was evident that his greatest fears were being realized. Someone was using Sherlock against him. And if Mycroft didn’t do as they asked, Sherlock would be killed.
“No, it has to be Jim Moriarty, but he had help. Someone who no one would question why they are there. Someone who is above reproach.”
“I’ll leave you a list of what I take so you will know what to tell the paramedics.” Sherlock joked.
“Witnesses also told us that you made quiet a scene at the hospital when you saw Wilderbrant. The doctor had to pull you away and reprimand you.”
“England can never repay you. I can never repay you.” She smiled at him.
“I broke your old phone. I owe you a new one.” Sherlock said unconcerned.
Frankie didn’t say anything. The corners of his lips pulled down and he nodded his head again in agreement.
“According to witnesses you did.” John was about to deny it when Dimmit continued. “Said you punched him in the face after he missed hitting you with a bottle. The bruise is still visible on his chin.”
He didn’t know anyone at the party. They appeared to be uni students. Pretensions and ignorant. The more they drank the stupider they became. Sherlock was leaning against a wall when a pretty young thing approached him.
“Why? Because you’re a berk? I think he already knows that.”
“Goodbye.” Sherlock smirked.
“Believe what you want, but no I won’t marry you or anyone. I don’t believe in love anymore. It’s a trap. We helped each other. And it felt good – damn fucking good. But it was physical and nothing else.” John returned to pacing.
“Spotters. I saw three in the street on my way back. They are good and hard to see, but I caught them. I circled around the block and noticed a sniper’s nest on top of the building next door.”
They followed Sherlock into the living room. The dark haired omega looked at the champagne flutes that were inside plastic evidence bags. Sherlock grabbed the bag and tore the ‘shatter tape’.
“No, it was good.” John pulled out of Seb’s embrace and sat on the edge of the bed. “I just need to go to work tonight. I’m on the late night shift again.”
“You can’t make me stay here. I want to return to London!” Sherlock pressed.
“Oh, please, Mister Smith.” Mycroft said. He swept the barrel of small gun around the room. “You tried to murder me.”
John bowed his head and hid his eyes behind his hand. He wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. His future just walked out the door with his sister. Everything he had worked for – struggled for disappeared. What was he going to do now? He would have to drop out of school. He would have to give up his chance at becoming a doctor because his drunk sister. Because of the legacy of his abusive father.
“You’re an idiot if you don’t know.” John whispered.
“James, please take Sherlock home.” John said as he continued to stare at the policeman.
“I apologize for being so forward.”
“Where are the guards? Where is Anthea?” Mycroft asked.
John shook as he felt a jolt run through him. ‘
“Of course he is. He had Moran do his dirty work. Moran was the face that everyone feared but Moriarty was the one pulling the strings in the background.” Sherlock said. “Victor Trevor used his connection in banking to help launder Moriarty’s money. Victor, being foolish, stole some of the money and Moran killed him as a warning to other members of the organization. Moran killed James Sholto because Sholto recognized him from Iraq. He knew Moran was wanted for murder and desertion. Moriarty didn’t even know who Sholto was when Moran pulled the trigger.”
“It is important that we present a united front, Sherlock. Moriarty is a very dangerous man. We can’t allow him to divide us. You must know this.”
Sherlock cocked his head slightly to the side and considered his brother. “What are you going to do?”
The first night John worked at Frankie’s, he broke three glasses. The cost of three glasses came out of his share of the tips. The next night, he had his arse pinched. He spun around to punch the pincher only to see one of the bouncers pull the guy up by his shoulders and push him towards the door. After a week, he quit blushing when he had to ask a new customer if they would like a ‘Blowjob’. He had several takers who were surprised when John set a small glass on the counter of Baily’s, Kahlua, and whip cream.
“Strong?” Sherlock asked.
“Tandoor said it was okay.” Wiggins said, ducking his head and avoiding the man’s eyes.
“John?” Greg chased John. “Wait up.”
“You did?”
John looked up at Sherlock. “So you are to blame for this again?”
“You won’t even give me a chance to plead my case!?”
“Are you here to kill me?” he asked tying to sound unconcerned.
“Who are you exactly and what do you think you know?” James asked.
“Okay.” John said distracted as he turned and read the file while limping down the hall on his cane.
“Exactly. Someone easily manipulated. If James returns, Parliament is done for. Everything will depend solely on the king. And whomever is operating in the shadows can manipulate James into giving them whatever they want. Even the country if they are clever enough.”
“Hmm, who?” Sherlock glanced up. “Oh, Victor. . . Date.”
Sherlock followed John up the steep steps and out into the sunlight. Sherlock brought his hand up to cover his eyes as the Caribbean sun glared down on the narrow deck. The Morstan was well built ship. It was different from the ship that had brought Sherlock and Mycroft out from England. The Morstan was narrower. Only twenty or twenty-five feet wide, but it had four or five decks below the main deck as well as a forecastle and a sterncastle.
John’s oiled finger lightly grazed over the furloughed skin of Sherlock’s entrance. Sherlock rolled his head back up and he slowly opened his eyes.
“You answered Mike Stamford’s question regarding my injuries. You made the poultice that was used on my wrists. You have anatomy book on your desk. And you grow plants for medicine. If you weren’t a doctor, you should be.”
“I said confused. I don’t know. I don’t want to be and I think you don’t want me to be, but we need to take it slow to make sure.” John tried to sound reasonable but all he could think was he sounded like an idiot.
“John, one more good push. We can see the crown.” Doctor Mathis said. His head down between John’s knees.
“Of course it is.” A woman’s voice called out from an open door on the far side of the room. “John Hamish Watson. I thought you said you weren’t one to enjoy my pleasures.”
Greg turned back and studied John’s face. With the soldier’s eyes closed and his face finally relaxed, Greg could see the years and dangers John had been through. Wrinkles with tan lines radiated out from the eyelids. There were small scars across his forehead and on one cheek. Where his hair was singed back, first degree burns reddened the tan skin near his ear. John’s lips were chapped and grey. Greg regretted having to question the man, but if John was a threat to Sherlock, he needed to be stopped. More importantly, it was his job.
“Serial suicides?” John looked confused. “No connection between the three individuals?”
“We have a client.”
“Seb, where’s my baby?! I’ve got to find William!”
“It is.”
He ignored the man’s nudity and proceeded to gently shift Sherlock’s thigh so he could get a better view of the wound. It was red but the skin was not puffy or tender to the touch. There was no discharge and the edges looked good. John returned to his bag and removed a hypodermic needle and a small vial of antibiotics.
Thank you for the wonderful comments. We get to the smut now. If not your thing, skip the portion with Sherlock and John. I've used a term from ff_fans series the "Seven Ages". Boi is a derogatory term for male omegas. It is somewhere between bitch and whore.
“Oh, God YES!” John tipped his head up and shouted to the ceiling.
John glanced up and saw James and smiled. James had never noticed before how open and inviting John’s face was. How his blue eyes were bright and friendly. Something twitched inside the older soldier.
John held his ground and looked up into the man’s meaty face. He had thick jowls and his brown eyes looked washed out and faded. John could see discoloration surrounding the man’s corneas. The fatty deposit that indicated heart disease.
It was near ten in the morning and the sun was a white ball of light in a bleached-out sky. The ground around them was pale and yellow with patches of green fields and silvery trees in the distance.
Corporal Bill Murry had found John laying in on the ground after he had been shot. Murry dragged John back into the compound. John’s blood stained the dirt and left a trail from the river’s edge to inside the walls. James came running out and he saw John’s lifeless body. A medic tried desperately to stop the bleeding. As soon as a helicopter was ready, John was Medi-Vac back to Camp Bastion. James tried to get on to the helicopter with John, but Bennett stopped him. Ordering the man to stand down.
“Sherlock!” John shouted as he climaxed. His vision burring and his ears ringing. He felt light and euphoric. He was glad Sherlock was holding him down because he was certain he would have floated away if he weren’t held.
John pulled back and quickly ran over that last few weeks he had known Moran.
“But you already lost your virginity.” Sherlock said remembering a conversation from a year ago in a bathroom.
“Never.”
“Probably wants to expand the lottery or something else ridiculous.” Elizabeth turned and smiled at Mycroft. “I will leaving for my country home this weekend.”
John pulled his shoulders back and tipped his chin up.
“I’m arranging nothing. I just wish to introduce you to the man. He is very influential and may have a political future if he is guided correctly.” Mycroft said dismissively.
“Why are you telling me this?”
On the fifth month, James received his new orders. He had been expecting them and now that he had the orders, he wanted to move forward. He wanted more. He went to John’s tent to tell him his plans.
“My excursion? You mean my stint into a drug induced tolerance for living.” He sneered at the woman.
“There is an individual who is standing out front for everyone to see. He is believed to be the leader of the organization but he is only window dressing. A puppet to the real leader. The puppet maintains control with fear and ruthless retaliation.” Sherlock said. “But he is only an associate. Someone who does the dirty work for the real leader. Someone who is the face of his enterprise.”
Sherlock glanced around at the crew as they started to search the bodies of the dead. Some taking boots and clothing – other gathering weapons.
“Sorry for pulling you in like this,” Greg apologized.
Sherlock didn’t stop now. He openly stroked John through his tight jeans. John could not hold back any longer, either. He groaned and reached up to grip Sherlock’s arms.
John rolled his eyes and went through the events for the fourth time. Frustrated, John left work early and went home to the flat. Sherlock was waiting for him along with another detective from the Met.
The omega shivered and moaned softly. “But you said . . .”
“Very Shakespearian of you. How did you plan on forcing me to do that?” Sherlock asked feeling sick to his stomach.
John watching him with growing interest and appeal.
John typed rapidly.
“Why are you nervous?”
“I have need for man with your skill sets.” Moriarty let his eyes sweep over the alpha again. “A man trained in various forms of combat, a sniper. A killer. Someone who can lead others. An alpha that can keep his head in crisis.”
Conversation with the devil. The question is who is the devil?
John turned and glared at the man.
Mycroft blinked his eyes, surprised by Sherlock’s cold and calculating assessment.
Sherlock took one last look as Jim and his blonde bodyguard walked out of the club. There was something about the bodyguard that was familiar but he couldn’t put his finger on it. It was a distant memory. He wondered if he had met him when Sherlock was a Jim’s flat. He wondered how he had gotten to Jim’s flat in the first place. Maybe the bodyguard had picked Sherlock up off the street and took him there. Maybe that was the reason he remembered the man.
“I sincerely doubt I would be sharing them with you.” Sherlock said dismissively as he glanced out the window at passing buildings.
“Shut up, you git. I kissed him. He proved someone was a murdered and it was announced on the telly. We were cheering and jumping around the flat and it happened. I grabbed him and kissed him.”
The next morning John woke up and tried the new shampoo and shower gel. He could believe how wonderful it made him feel. His hair was soft and his skin felt smooth. He swore to himself he would use it sparingly. John made another cup of tea and ate one of his almond biscuits.
“Oh yes, ah . . . John Watson. Hey, how did you know I was in the army?”
“But Magnussen was shot.” John interrupted. “If he was part of this plan to bring Mycroft down, why was he shot?”
Frankie frowned. “I found her in Birmingham. Got ‘er into rehab – twice. It didn’t take. She is still there. Barely getting by. She doesn’t know me from Adam. Doesn’t want my ‘elp.”
“Mister Holmes you simply do not understand.” The doctor started to say.
“I meant you.” John whispers.
Mycroft seemed surprised by John’s comment. A snide expression came over his face. He addressed Sherlock while he stared intimidatingly at John.
Sherlock smiled at John who returned the smile.
“Even if he believes you are dead, he would want somewhere he feels in control of all of us. Somewhere he had the upper hand.”
John spent the next three days ducking the landlord. He left the flat before five-thirty in the morning and waiting to come home after the time he knew his landlord usually went to bed. He scraped together what little money he had left and bought food for Sherlock, but the young man didn’t seem to want to eat anything John brought. Sherlock seemed to live on John’s tea and air.
“Good evening,” he said as he nodded slightly at Mary.
“Sherlock, what are you talking about?”
“Are you hiding too?”
“Next time, I want to suck you off.” James whispered.
Sherlock hummed and burrowed his face into John’s neck. He breathed deep the scent of the alpha.
“Sherlock, what are you talking about? She was your mother. She must have cared about you.” John pleaded.
Sherlock rose from the chair and went into the bathroom.
“I spoke to John.” Mycroft said as he sat down in a chair by the window.
“Tell us who is after him.” John stepped forward threateningly.
“I refuse to believe that. Many things can happen between now and then.” Sherlock stepped closer to John. “Look at what’s happened so far in the past four months.”
“Do you want the chair cleaned?” Moran asked Moriarty.
,” Whined the omega. “I’m ready . . . please.” Sherlock would deny he was begging but there was no other word to describe how he sounded.
“I was in lectures in the morning. We met up after class and went for a walk then back to the flat afterwards and we were together for the rest of the day.”
“Get out! Get out and leave me alone!” John shouted.
He heard the gurgling again and quickly turned to the left. There on the floor he saw two scuffed up trainers. He stepped closer and realized there were feet in the shoes and legs attached.
Sherlock did what she showed him. He sucked in the first wave of heated air and smoke. He coughed.
“Not even a salute, soldier?” the brigadier asked in a threatening tone.
“Do you mind?” Sherlock growled as the men pushed the two of them apart.
The man smiled at Mycroft. “Only a minor position, yet one of great responsibility.”
“When did I tell you I wanted to be kicked to the kerb?”
“Probably. Or he started before Victor showed up in the picture. Either way I think he was using back then to cope with it. He let Victor beat the crap out of him just so Victor wouldn’t leave him. Then you came along.”
The room became very silent. A heaviness came. The accountant turned and stared at the attorney. Moran shifted slightly as his fingers wrapped around the grip of the gun in the holster at the small of his back. Culverton Smith simply smiled.
“Mrs. Savage is confused. She was calling out and I came to see if I could help her.” The troll blurted out.
The lectures and professors didn’t drown out the sound of dream Sherlock’s voice.
John felt his face suddenly warm. “Irene, that’s not what we’re here for. And I don’t bugger my crew.”
Sherlock turned and rushed up the stairs to their flat.
Confused by Sherlock’s comment, Greg continued. “By the time everyone turned around, the painting was gone. The police had already been called because of the ‘smash and grab’. We get there and we have a eighty-five-thousand-pound painting missing. No signs of how the thief could have gotten it out of the building. The guests were blocking the front door and the back door was locked.”
“You saw him twice. I picked him up after he left here today.”
The final weight was lifted from John’s chest. He knew he couldn’t wait a moment longer.
“Why do they show up here? What are you doing here that would need someone like Moriarty to show up?”
“What did they say?” John blurted out.
“What?” Greg asked.
He was concentrating on ceiling when there was a sudden burst of camera flashes. His eyes shifted to the main door of the room and at the men who had just entered. Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes.
“John, you should realize that everything I do is necessary.” Mycroft said as he stepped closer and loomed over John.
“Would that be bad?”
The ship rocked again as McMath gave the final coup de grâce. The boards of the main deck buckled and groaned.
It was only a short drop. Sherlock was no more than twenty feet above the ground.
“Don’t tell me where he is ever again. I don’t want to know. I don’t want he hear his name again.” Sherlock said.
The weeks passed in a haze of unfamiliar faces and drug induced images, as Sherlock traveled. He remember waking up on a beach once. The sound of the waved rhythmically washing over the rocky beach. There was a man with him. He didn’t remember who the man was but he was small and red-headed. His face was round and open like John’s. His eyes were the same shade of blue. He told Sherlock his name was Arthur. Sherlock left him on the beach.
“’ey, what the blood ‘ell do you think you’re doing?” The barman growled.
“John are you . . .” Sherlock couldn’t finish his question because John was kissing him again. Fervently and possessively.
“Let me be the judge of that.”
“You’re an idiot.” John smiled. “Come here and kiss me.”
Mycroft almost shouted ‘
Sherlock looked down into the flushed face of his mate. He could see the fear at the corners of John’s lips. The etched worry lines creasing his smooth face. John’s dark blue eyes pleading with him.
“You’ll take me to England if I work as a common sailor?” Sherlock asked hopefully.
“Sherlock, he is a villain. The antithesis of everything the Holmes stand for.”
“For something else.” John said glancing over at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s cleaver fingers were already mapping out the girth and texture of John’s length. The smooth velvety skin over an iron hard rod. Sherlock’s mouth watered. He twisted up so he could watch. He had to watch!
“He is my bond mate! Get out!” Sherlock shouted as John stepped forward and yelled simultaneously, “NO!”
He turned and left.
Sherlock kept staring at the wall.
John felt an overwhelming need to reassure the omega. John had promised and he would never willingly leave Sherlock. Never hurt him, but John knew this was not the time to remind him. Sherlock needed to focus on his family and not on John.
“Relieved to know you don’t believe I would do so just for the sole purpose of humiliating you.”
Silently, he walked out the open door and onto the balcony. A large oak tree grew close to the house. The broad limbs and leaves giving shade to the house from the heat. It was a warm night but the moon was nigh. It was so dark that Sherlock could barely see more than a few feet in front of him. Carefully he crawled up on to the railing and reached out for closest limb. He had to do this one handed since he still held the vase in his other hand. If he missed, he would crash to the ground, right in front of the guard – probably with a broken bone or two.
“Yea Captain?” the eager young man said.
“John, you are a reasonably intelligent person. You must know that you are attractive both physically as well of intellectually to me.”
“Will you lay down with me? We should get used to sleeping together.”
He turned and left the dressing room of the pool. The man behind John pushed him to follow. John stumbled then picked himself up and walked behind Moriarty. The dark haired omega walked passed the empty pool. The water was drained away because the pool had been abandoned. After the building was nearly bombed by Moriarty a year before, most people refused to allow their children to return to the pool. Schools stopped using the facility for swim meets and staff found jobs elsewhere. In the year since Moriarty had tried to kill Sherlock and John here, the building had been left to decay on its own. A notice pinned to the front doors announced the destruction of the swimming complex in the next few weeks.
“He wasn’t threatening Moran when he was shot.” John said. His hand slipped down from Sherlock’s wrist to his hand. Their fingers laced together.
“You said something about a proposal?”
“Sherlock?” John was concerned, “What’s wrong? Did I hurt you?”
“No, he and the soldier just glanced at each other. Didn’t even say bloody word. But Jim’s bodyguard. Your friend saw ‘im and he when crazy. He grabbed ‘im and said he ‘ad been look’n for ‘im. Sebastian Moran.”
~^+^~
The dark haired stranger tipped his head back and looked carefully down at John.
The man got up and started to slowly walk around the room. He looked with contempt at the various mementos of the Holmes family.
“It’s just simple mineral oil.” Blackwood explained. “It’s stored in the forecastle with the muskets.”
“You do not have a choice, Sherlock.” Mycroft said.
The alpha’s attention was on Moran. Sherlock was shouting something at the man when John cried out again.
“I must admit, he is significantly better than your last dalliance but anything would be.”
“I want to try.”
“Yes, now to work. Where would Moriarty take John?”
The day after Moran and Moriarty bonded, the two left for Milan, then Dubai. Moran became the threatening shadow at the powerful omega’s shoulder. If anyone meeting with Moriarty wasn’t intimidated enough by James, the glaring alpha standing behind him scared them to death. Moriarty opened more of his network up to Moran to see. The ex-soldier had only known a little beyond Moriarty’s assassination squad. Now he learned of James’ connection to weapons and illegal drug trade. Human trafficking and extortion. Also he learned that James was involved in numerous legitimate companies around the world. The man’s fingers were controlling the reins of several multinational corporations. He had bonded with a very powerful omega.
And together, they took off running.
He thought. John was willing to do anything for Sherlock, he just needed to know what to say.
Yes, John was jealous but he was not going to give the woman the pleasure of knowing.
Moran fell backwards over the parapet edge, pulling Moriarty’s body with him. The two plummeted to the pavement below.
The SAS man glanced up from his seat and saw Sean pushing Eddy into the woman’s lap. He set his newspaper down and started to reach into his jacket. The smoke bomb began to billow white smoke out from under the man’s chair.
Sherlock tightened his grip around the omega at the thought of the man whom had threatened to remove John from Sherlock’s life.
“Did ‘e now.”
“Royal Hill, Greenwich.” John told the driver.
John glance back and forth between the two of them. “So which is it?”
“You killed him? You murdered John’s father?” asked Sherlock.
The woman’s eyes flew open wide. “Now? At this time of the day?”
They approached a waiting car. The driver had the back door opened for Moran as he approached.
Finally, there were the experiments. It happened gradually and John didn’t realize it until it was too late. There was the experiment with mold under the sink. Then the collection of native insects to London appeared on the kitchen table. The day John came home with dinner from local Indian restaurant, he found a dead rat in the refrigerator.
“Now come with us or I will allow Seb to not only shoot you in the knee, but also give the order to place a bullet right between John Watson’s dark blue eyes.”
“Police in the lobby. They are on their way up.” The second man whispered.
“I have been a good soldier for you. I have done everything you have asked of me. I want the Holmes omega as payment for a job well done.” Moran said as he pulled his shoulders back and tried to look like the army officer he once was.
John scrutinized James’s expression. “Bennett tell you I wanted to leave?”
“Doctor John Watson. He’s been helping me with several inquiries.” Sherlock said slightly deflated.
“NO!” Shouted Sherlock as Magnussen fired.
“Hit you? Beat the pulp out of you?” John asked. “I still might. Don’t be doing that to me again.”
Seb’s arms came up and wrapped around John’s body, pulling his close. John felt the bulge in front of Seb’s trousers pressed into his hip. The kissing became more urgent and messy. Seb’s fingers reached up and dragged through John’s short hair. The soft blonde strands bristling through Seb’s callous fingers.
“He was really upset, John. He was scared and upset. He thought he would never see you again.”
He knew he was couldn’t see John again. He couldn’t handle seeing the anger and pain in John’s face. Anger and pain he had put there. He hoped his last horrible words he said were enough to keep John away from him.
“John, your boss called looking for you. Where were you?” Sherlock asked as soon as John walked in.
“Regardless of whatever Victor said, John, Sherlock will be there tonight. He is counting on you to be there to.” Mike said sincerely.
“You taste as delicious as I thought you would.” Sherlock purred.
“You have a simple choice to make, Sherlock.”
Mycroft held the straw again to Sherlock’s lips and the dark haired man took another drink. Greg didn’t say anything more. He just waited till Sherlock was able to speak again.
Irene laughed and waved her hand. The naked woman stood and quickly put on her dress.
They rolled together on the bed; only parting to remove another article of clothing. When Sherlock’s trim cotton shirt was removed, John pinned Sherlock’s hands to the mattress, lacing their fingers together. He licked up Sherlock’s neck and whispered in his ear.
“You cooperate with the doctors here and you go through rehabilitation and I will allow you to leave here in four months.”
“It is not me, Sherlock. It is John who has decided to leave.”
“Well, we will see, won’t we?”
“Why not?”
Lestrade looked suspiciously at Mycroft as John spoke up.
“You got any food in the place?” John asked.
Sherlock didn’t even hesitate. “I was with Jim. We were at a party somewhere. I don’t remember where. Then I went with him back to his flat and stayed there till only an hour or two ago.”
“Coow,” she hissed and tried to sit up.
“Sherlock, this isn’t the time . . ."
Sherlock glanced at John for a moment. He could see John’s anger boiling under the surface. John was embarrassed as well as angry. Sherlock turned back to Irene. “Tell me what you know about the kidnapping a man named Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock smiled. “Of course.”
“What? Are you suddenly saying you aren’t offended by gay men hitting on you?”
John turned and went into the bedroom. He needed to find the smallest shorts he had. He thought he might need to use the scissors again.
“In his quarters.” Blackwood finally said. “Leave him alone. He is dying.”
Mycroft glanced briefly at his brother then let his own attention move to the flames. He would never admit it out loud, but his brother was correct.
The small round faced man stood next to the bed. His mouth was open and pulled into a frightened gasped. His sad blue eyes were wide and panicky.
His heart was racing and his mind was clouded with the fear that John was missing. He opened the bedroom door and stumbled out into the sitting room. His long limbs not quite working correctly as he tripped into the room.
John turned and watched the numbers descend above their heads. The door opened and two men stepped out of the lift.
“Sherlock said it was a set up. You shot that kid up with drugs and brought him into A&E to get to me.” John said as he watched for any reaction on Seb’s face.
“Nothing will change that.” Sherlock whispered as he leaned closer and kissed John’s lips.
