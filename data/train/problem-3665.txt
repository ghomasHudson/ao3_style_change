The balcony opened onto another stair, this one curving down along the trunk of a tower and disappearing into what appeared to be a raucous jungle of roses. Fruited musk filled the air, like every sweet fruit-bearing plant bloomed in this place. Above them, the cavernous sky blushed blue and green like the ribbons of an aurora against the unfathomable depths. Castiel pulled Dean to a barrow in the thick of the garden and settled him at its peak. He placed both palms against Dean’s shoulders, and looked at him with the hooded gaze of a pleased cat.
Castiel jolted.
He opened his eyes to the dull dawn, then heaved himself up to sitting, swinging his legs to the side of the bed. There, he paused for a moment, collecting himself.
So he had been right about the intent of the growing force ahead. “Why?” he asked.
“This chick cursed you when you were a kid, Cas. What makes you think it’s gonna go any better when you’re an adult? Cas!” Dean said, tightening his grip when Castiel tried to stand up. “Look, I’m sorry about everything. All my fear of magic and shouting at you and making you feel like shit— I’m better now, though.
“Baby,” Dean smiled, “Anything feels like a kink if you’re involved.”
Castiel watched the main door, as well as the length of the workmans’ greenhouse while Dean climbed onto the center table. Reaching high and squinting against the drifting spray of the spray can, Dean painted a careful angel trap across the ceiling. He stepped back and forth between the tall workbenches to span the length of the path, until the white-painted trap was completed. In the mostly cloudy sky, it was largely invisible against the glass, blending into the window framing. It would hold Lucifer there for a short time, if he tried to leave through that doorway. There was just enough room for Castiel to squeeze past the trap, if he threw all dignity aside and crawled under the tables close to the wall.
Over breakfast the next morning, Castiel emailed his realtor with the plan he’d sculpted overnight. He knew both himself and Sam Winchester had worked through agents to complete the sale. Surely he could convince his realtor to contact Sam’s realtor. Castiel would be in touch with Sam before the end of the day, his ghost problem would be solved, and he could move on with his life.
“Sometimes I wonder…” Dean stopped and hung his head, examining his hands in the light of the fire, turning them in its warmth. “Is there any chance of us winning? Any hope? Even if I kill...Lucifer. How do we come back from this, Cas?”
By the time evening rolled around, he had tamed his more insidious demons. He sat comfortably on the front stoop of his building while he waited for Dean to arrive. Whatever happened, would happen. Whether it was a dat or not...or if it went well or not... There was no point in agonizing over it, right? He inhaled deeply, watching the neighborhood bustle around him.
“You made it through the worst of it this afternoon.” Dean tapped the headset. “This should take maybe...half an hour? Forty-five minutes? Then you can check back with reception in 302 to schedule more appointments.”
“They’d keep to themselves,” Cas guessed, thinking about Ketch and his mysterious society which had never come up in any of their other interactions with hunters. They surely must be insular. “But maybe someone’s run into them? Figure they must need supplies from time to time. Food. The basics.”
But despair never stopped him from trying.
The equinox was a strange time, magical city or not. It heralded the official start of fall, but Maltese still held firmly onto the hem of summer’s dress. Flowers bloomed out of season on the equinox, filling the trees with night-blooming morning glories which twined through branches. The air was sweet with a heady mix of bloom and early leaf decay. By the next morning, the leaves would begin to turn like well-trained dogs and fall to the ground one by one.
Dean’s proximity felt dizzying. Castiel didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look up to watch the fine textures of Dean’s scruff dance as he spoke. Dean continued speaking, apparently unaffected. Right. He was a professional.
speaking aloud? Anxiety churned in his gut, and his mouth burned sour with every audible exhalation.
Castiel could never put into words what changed, but the chill seemed to calm suddenly, like a friend settling beside him. The creaking stopped, but the cold remained wrapped around him like an arm flung loosely around his shoulders. Castiel had spent the past month nursing the paranoid belief that a presence dwelled in his house, but tonight was the first time it actually seemed like a comfort. He wasn’t alone.
“If it doesn’t go well. If we die tomorrow.”
“Cool, right?” And that was pride shining on Dean’s face. Well-deserved.
Raphael’s outpost is in an office building so new the smell of fresh paint and plastic permeates everything. Castiel stops in the hallway and closes his eyes briefly. He’s got two angels searching the second floor, and another soldier just ahead. Zoriel, one of Raphael’s righthand guard, is rumored to be hiding out in the shell of this place. Castiel sent three angels after her. None of them returned.
“Dean,” Castiel bit off. “I’ve got this. Get him to the Fern Room.”
When Dean passed through the portal it sealed behind him like a suddenly healed wound. The princesses gasped and flocked to their precious hatch as Dean sidestepped around them. And then, still invisible, he walked out of the palace and through the forest to the home he shared with his brother.
Magic permeated Harroway, wrapped around Dean, and soaked down into the chambers beneath the royal apartments. Dean had expected the hatchway to open up into the long, dark throat of the palace. But the winding staircase was neither close nor dark. Instead, light assaulted his eyes. A forest gleamed as far as he could see on either side of the steps, and the ceiling was flecked with light as though by stars.
“Castiel.” Dean’s lips twitched in a smile. “Can’t say it’s entirely been a pleasure but that’s no fault of your own.”
“That’s no excuse, Mister Salad.”
Charlie dropped her chin theatrically to her hand. “Spill everything,” she insisted. They passed the time amicably after that, spitting cherry pits and plotting ridiculous scenarios to kick-start Castiel’s love life.
“But if you talk, then…pies?”
They hesitated outside the archway, looking at each other with more than a hint of nerve. All, that is, except for Channing. She surveyed them with amusement, then proffered her arm to Kevin. “The band I want to see starts soon on the First Street crossroad,” she said. “Who’s coming?” She glanced at Dean and Castiel.
Not that Dean seemed to have such reservations.
Dean— and Sam, yes, because when Dean gave, it was of a deeper well than just his own means— had given it to him. He reaches up to the tie that Dean had loosened, tugging it further with a crooked finger, and sits on the bed. His bed. Dust doesn’t fly up under his weight, so that’s already a positive sign.
A soft sound escapes his clenched throat, barely more than a thready gasp, and he feels Castiel shudder against him.
He has to hold back a moan, back arching against her as teeth brush the back of his neck.
“Sam just said there’s nothing here.”
He can hear it behind him, clacks and scrapes and huffs and tremors that reverberate down the hall. It sucks out the air like a massively silent roar, violently empty in a way that makes his teeth ache in his jaw and he nearly slams into a wall rounding a corner.
Dean’s stopped pacing but now Castiel has the urge to, the room too small with the both of them there. He speaks quieter instead, “With Sam, it felt more like he was answering
For a moment, he remembers Dean’s lips on his- Dean’s fingers bruising his hips to keep him close, closer, like if he pulled hard enough Castiel could just melt into him,
And Castiel realizes, with a sudden drop of his stomach, he is
Her hands know just how to touch him as he closes his eyes and imagines, his own hand working slow and steady. When she slides to her knees her tongue knows better still, working skillfully enough at him that he let slides another sound, louder this time. He’s louder than he means— if a lifetime of him and Sam living in and out of each other’s pockets taught him anything, it's some subtlety, alright— but something about this feels
Castiel almost scoffs.
He can feel his heart hammering in slow motion, but all he can hear is Dean’s.
“The waters have always been here. The Men of Letters found it later. Now, it’s a part of… everything. It runs in the walls, in the wires, the manmade leylines and wards. All of it.”
The water feels thick, alive around him. It won’t let him sink.
. Fine as can be, anyway, when I’m stuck in here-- after all, I’m still working on this, alright? It’s not like you’ve been helping, just laying around with Dean in the Impala-”
Castiel had been waiting patiently as Dean tinkered, but his attention draws away. Dean straightens as the angel strides to the door.
Were they the future? Was he seeing his
about the stone. His concern makes Dean itch.
“Sam, you better be holding this thing-”
but see what, exactly?
Her mouth curves, sweet as sin, and—
“You’ve got questions. We’re gonna ask them. Well,  you’re gonna ask ‘em.”
surprised by the action even though he was the one that started this mess.
“We could just go right now—”
Dean hesitates.
Dean thought he knew all Cas’ expressions; many are similar, sure, but there’s the little quirks and tweaks that give him away. Not that he can
“Unless the steam drowns us in our sleep, sure.” Sam retorts. It’s amused almost, eyes hooded. For a jarring moment, Dean doesn’t recognize him. “Come on, it’ll be easy. Lore says after a couple times with the same person, you don’t even need to ask out loud. It’s more like… syncing minds, and seeing what we see.”
“Oh. Okay.” Sam lifts both empty hands uselessly, and shrugs.
Dean shifts from foot to foot, turning to face the other man fully. He’s barefoot, sweaty and sticky in rumpled pajamas-- but not Cas, no. Castiel, as always, is dressed in full suit and tie, trenchcoat falling wrinkled over his shoulders. Not that Dean minds the look—  to the contrary, anything else unsettles him on Cas—  but when Dean’s not dressed, he doesn’t like the contrast. The balance is too pointedly off and the whole holy tax accountant thing feels all too real, leaving Dean a snotty immoral ape barefoot before a calculated wavelength of pure will.
is overwhelming.
Thank frigging god.
It’s true enough, judging by the way he’s already struggling back to his feet, dragging himself after her even as the movement makes his vision spot red at the edges. A jagged swath of his side is already darkening to a startled purple, blood dripping sluggishly to swirl into the water and sweat rolling down his skin.
This is the steam sanding his self-control to ribbons. This is a mistake. This will undo them, and Dean means more to him than this.
The ones he’d flipped had mostly been unlabeled, and small enough he hadn’t noticed them missing before-- so hopefully, nothing too catastrophic.
He smirks and his cheek knocks against the tile when she shoves him, steam burning down his throat as he sucks in a breath. He can taste the faintest tinge of copper on his teeth, and it goes straight to his dick because of course it does, he’s fucked up like that, remember?
Yet, it feels familiar… He prods it with a discarded fork and it gives way like dry dust, crackling apart. He expects juice to spill out of it, to stick to the fork and make a mess of the tin, but nothing.
Dean yawns and sits up, folding his arms over his knees to look at him.
The room is dimly lit, but Castiel has the strange, static feeling of standing in the dark. Straining to see something you can’t. It sets his nerves on edge.
His wrists twist against Castiel’s grip -- testing it more than trying to rip free, Castiel realizes, and Castiel has no interest in failing Dean’s tests. Something in Dean’s expression shifts, chin tilting up the slightest, and his skin has bloomed warm from his collar up his neck but there’s still something in his look, something that hooks the edge of his mouth into something challenging.
you. C’mon. Come sit. Stretch out. Lay down, take a break.” Dean thumps the spot next to him lazily, eyes half-closed.
The water level’s drawing high in his room, but he hadn’t realized just how high until he sees it starting to gain on his mattress. Any further and he’s got no clue where he’ll be sleeping. His head is pounding, though, which makes that a problem for future Dean.
“...We, uh- we gonna do this or what?” Dean’s a little breathless, a little cocksure in the way he has when he isn’t, and he tilts his head back to look up at Castiel through his lashes in a way that-- he has to know what he looks like.
Dean stops as he hears Castiel’s steps following close behind him.
He straightens as he hears a muffled gasp and a- whimper? Dean Winchester doesn’t whimper- it feels wrong even as it sends a surprising little jolt through him. He shifts to stand, ‘stay’ or not, but freezes as Dean steps out naked.
“So who’s going under first?”
And goes dark.
Still, he tries to see if he can smell Castiel on him, maybe smell the whiskey, but all he smells is his own sweat, the humidity in the room insufferable.
A lit match falls into the tangle of leaves, and smoke billows up in graceless little tangles around them.
. If he somehow found another to desire, would it always be a shade duller than this? The thought aches but he’s too close to say this was a mistake- not when he’s still inside him, hands stroking over Dean’s skin, the last aftershocks of pleasure still bleeding out of his veins-
Still, Castiel sounds curious more than anything, and Dean’s shoulders loosen. Following Castiel winds them deeper into the bunker, past bedrooms and halls and empty doorways.
Somehow, despite the whites of Sam’s eyes right in front of him, Dean feels watched, and not just by how Castiel’s attention swivels to him.
Gray spills down the stairs, twisting and coiling around Castiel’s ankles. He leaves a gash in the thin haze as he strides in, and Dean’s right on his heels only to find the angel staring down at the long, jaggy crack in the cement floor.
The shower is running, and Castiel isn’t even certain he’s still supposed to be here when Dean emerges, rubbing himself as dry as the humid air will allow with an old towel, but Dean doesn’t comment on Castiel’s presence. He just throws himself down on the bed next to Castiel - there’s another hint of that overly confident stance from earlier, too cocksure to be sure, but Dean just mutters a noncommittal “Y’ know, you can stay if you want, shower’s open,” and that’s apparently that.
“In your room?”
And Castiel... well, Castiel shouldn’t be looking.
He’s in the laundry room, the one place Dean’s never actually seen him before. The angel’s back is to him, Castiel just staring at the wall as far as he can tell.
"Come on- come on, do it, Cas, you've gotta be close," Dean's voice is lazy-soft around the edges, slurred almost, softer than Castiel's maybe ever heard it, whispering a "fuck," when Castiel sinks into him and Dean's head falls back against the mattress as Castiel grips him tight.
“What?! How long’s he been gone?? If I die—”
Still, and he thinks his voice is remarkably even, “How?” It had been so foggy, an island of their own; he remembers the haze only falling away as the Impala’s black gleam betrayed her at arm’s reach. Where could Sam have been, to see them?
“Careful! Shit, is this— gas? That could be toxic, probably a leak, we’ve gotta get out-”
“Cas?
“This is a good thing, Dean. I’ve seen things, too, okay? It’s
Dean’s bed isn’t so large, not with both of their not inconsiderable frames laid out in it. Even without touching Dean, they’re close enough that he can feel the warmth radiating from the man’s bare skin. Besides, he knows Dean is a light sleeper, restless and jumpy (understandably so), and Castiel has no idea how Dean’s other... bedmates have fared waking him.
Everything has been strange; something about this entire situation is like sandpaper on his skin. None of it feels right, but… He can’t say why.
Well, good to know his life never settles down. Fuck him, right?
Castiel… he isn’t beautiful, not the way Dean figures that kind of thing. He was striking, sure, the same way lightning is; blinding, static and the alien smell of ozone so parched it could be set off with a spark. His dour mouth is just as dry no matter how many chapsticks Dean pointedly tucks in the pockets of his trenchcoat, lips creased and pink like the line of his own hand and just as familiar—
Dean frowns, waiting, but he keeps his eyes closed. Still, nothing seems to be coming up. Just a nagging little feeling, deep in his belly. The hell was
He can’t blame the ambrosia this time, if he gives in now. Nothing at fault but his own weak will-
Dean’s stomach does a gravity-defying flop that lands wedged up his throat. ‘Alone’ meant Cas either wanted to start up about Sam again-- or talk about what they’d just done, and that way laid so many things Dean had barely gotten a grip on for himself, let alone for public consumption. Let alone for Cas.
The smoke wafts up again, stinging his eyes, and when he looks back over Sam’s head tilts back in that same unsettling way as last time, eyes rolling back in his head. Jesus, had he looked like that? He’d have to ask Castiel, or Sam when they were done.
“...Perhaps we should go to the archives, and see if we can find a translation for this?” He offers after Sam remains quiet.
Castiel is leaning closer to Dean, a hand on the counter next to him as he studies Sam.
All over Dean, who’d left it balancing precariously on the arm of his chair. It spills down Dean’s torso, lush rivulets spreading down his shirt before Castiel can manage to grab the bottle.
Despite the fact they are utterly spent Castiel drags Dean out of bed when it is still dark, they wrap up warmly as the wind is howling and they make their way down to the shoreline, the sky is starting to lighten as they make their way down.  They find a bit of Earth that won’t get washed away anytime soon and bury the vial of grace there, hoping it takes root as something beautiful like Anna’s tree.
Cas has met a girl he thinks he likes a lot on the commute that he does from the hospital to home, she is pretty with blonde hair and blue eyes that are filled with affection.  She is intelligent, funny and would be perfect for her, if he had the balls to ask her out.  Instead all they do is flirt on the train journeys and that’s about it.
Castiel wondered what it would be like to be that free, to do what you loved. “I envy you,” he said softly.  Jo scoffed packing up her the wigs in to the suitcase and without even looking walked away, her head low staring at the ground as if all the weight of the world was upon her.  Castiel blushed at the rebuff but wanted to go after her, there was something not quite right and he wanted to help, but after that conversation, Castiel was pretty sure that Jo would not want it…
“In case Hester comes back.” Sam muttered,
Castiel met the hunters green eyes and he felt his heart ache, the hunter had so much faith in him, even after everything that they had gone through. It was one of the many things that Castiel loved about Dean Winchester and he knew that the hunter was the only one who could get him this, he breathed deeply, "Dean Winchester will you accept me?"
He returns on a late summer evening when you are reading to Samuel on the porch.  His beard is longer and his uniform thread bare.  He looks like he has lost some serious weight but you would know your husband anywhere.  He is walking up the little track that leads to your farm and you know that soon you must face the music but it is important that his return be at least a little happy.  You put the book down and whisper to your son who is on your lap that the man walking towards the farm is his father.
Castiel had to admit he did not really have much interest in women, all throughout his teenage years he never really felt connected with a woman.  He preferred to look at the boys he went to school with and while he had no problems with this, he was sure his family and society as a whole would find a problem.  It was one of the main reasons he so wanted to change the world.
“That’s a lot of money. What’s it for?” Chuck asked
It shouldn’t surprise you six months in to your marriage when you wake up one morning and run to the pail to be sick.  Dean is by your side immediately, wiping your sweaty face with a damp cloth.  He gently embraces you soothing you but he has a hopeful smile upon his face.  You are more cautious and tell him it could be stomach illness, he agrees telling you to give a few more days.
“Who’s your team, please don’t say Manchester United?” the boy said not watching Castiel, continuing the beat the wall into submission with the sheer force of kicking a ball at it.
He drove back to the motel, angrily slamming doors and kicking the stones on the pavement, now not really giving a shit about a Christmas as he charged through the door and ready to slam it to kingdom come when he saw that Sam was not alone in front of the Christmas tree.
But there is a car behind him flashing his lights and is blaring his horn.  On a country road that Castiel knows he should be the only one, he knows that it’s Dean.  He pulls over and barely gets out of the car before Dean is on him, pinning him to the car and kissing the life out of him.
You see him writhing in pain in front of the fire; you go to his side and gingerly kneel by his side.  He has thrown his blanket off him and you see that he is cold.  You gently brush his hair and scalp, calling his name softly telling him to wake up.  He wakes with a start and grabs your wrist and you start immediately and would fall but he stops you.  You stare at each other for a few seconds before he lets go and you pull his blanket over him before getting up, your belly making it hard for you.  You start padding your way back to your bedroom when you hear him softly thank you.  You swallow hard battling tears as you hoarsely reply that he is welcome.
But by kissing him you have sealed your fate.  You are so lost in Dean you swear your heart stops when a light is flashed on you and angry voices order you to halt.  It happens so quickly, arms grab you and pin your arms behind your back.  You are punched and you feel your nose break, you look to Dean who is currently being punched and kicked to the ground and you cry out.   You try and scrabble to him but your vision flashes white then black as the butt of a rifle connects with your skull.
Castiel smiled at that, “Well good luck,”
Some would say that he is already half way there, a fallen angel.
Castiel’s father made true on his promise. Castiel had the $250 burning in the pocket of his jeans that night as he made his way through the dancers at the hut.  Making his way through them he found himself not blushing as much as he did the first time as he found Dean and Jo slow dancing to Stay.  He gently tapped Jo on the shoulder beckoning her to come to him. Jo looked at him shiftily but Cas shrugged and held out the money. “Here’s the money.”
“Why should you tell me what’s right?” Alastair leered defiantly.
As the axe falls you soar.
It is when you see him.  You have not seen him for five years but he has not changed at all.   That defiant glare and jut of his jaw you would recognise anywhere.  He was your best friend through school being neighbours in your little village.  He had gone to travel while you had stayed; you had shared nearly everything together at one time.  You could never imagine him being here and wonder if he is part of the German Resistance.
Till now.
It has never felt like this before, you think as you feel your body take over and you stare into those green eyes, loosing yourself in those green eyes.  You feel it building in your lower body as you move faster and faster.  You are hurtling towards the edge of something, like waves thrashing in the seas.  You try not to cry out but every time you bury yourself deep in him on releases itself from your lips.
“That’s my favourite car.” Anna simpered.
But still Cas thinks what if?
Before he could make her excuse, Chuck answered for her “Sure he would,” and Castiel put on his best smile.  Which was why for the second time that day he had been roped in for something he really did not want to do.
He is trying to eat his way through the remainder of the Christmas chocolate when his phone starts ringing, he doesn’t recognise the number so he answers it, instantly recognising the voice that says “Hey Cas, so you never changed your number...”
Bored, Dean watched the warm golden light, he couldn't help himself be drawn to the light, and it felt so peaceful compared to the thoughts of Castiel which raced by at 100 miles per hour. The grace looked so lovely to him, he did not realise how close he was until he was in the centre of it.
Your cabin is small, room enough for you to stand and a truckle bed, so you are standing close to each other.  Dean demands a reason to why you have been avoiding him.  Are you ill?  Has he offended you?  Has he done something to make you hate him?
He starts to move back onto your thrusts and you try and keep your moans and gasps to a minimum in case anyone should hear them.  You gasp as he scratches his nails down your back as you build up your pace.  It builds the heat in your body and you breathe out raggedly into each other’s mouths, gasping each other’s names.
These thoughts were firmly in his head as he paid for the rum and some pumpkin pie at the gas station, he wasn’t really wanting to address the issue of why Cas not turning up for Christmas was bothering him so much.  But then there it was, his inner thoughts screaming at him,
Tears fall down Castiel’s cheeks and he feels Dean hands cup his face as he kisses his lips, his eyes, his cheeks, lapping up his first tears, while constantly breathing “Yes. Yes. Yes.”
Up close, Castiel got to see how beautiful he was, his eyes were the brightest shade of Jade he had ever seen, with different shades of green on top of that, his jaw line was perfect and he had the most beautiful kissable lips ever.  With the mysterious air and the way he danced, Castiel felt even more enthralled and also threatened.
“What on how to say goodbye?” Dean scoffs, immediately tensing and looking away.
And I'll tell you baby, it was easy
You ask the stranger if he knows the symptoms but he shakes his head, his description relies on one word.  Black.
Crowley is angry and calls you a measly whore, telling you that he will find somewhere else to buy his produce.  He is deaf to your fearful pleas and storms off, the noise brings Samuel toddling out and you fear that you have been foolish and placed your boy in danger. You lift Samuel up on to your hip and sooth him with a kiss upon his scalp.  Just how will you survive now?
Did you know? How much I loved you? How much I wanted to be with you, kiss you, touch you, always? Deep down I knew you loved me, why didn’t I ever do something. Why didn’t I over the years tell you I loved you, screamed that I loved you, whispered that I loved you.
The grace, the infinite being that he was.
There is a knock at the door and you know it will be Dean.  This is it, this is goodbye.  You cling to each other kissing each other passionately.  He tells you that you will never age to him, you will be timeless.
“So it’s not an emergency. We sweat it out and try to get some sleep. Then tomorrow, we can head into town, see if we can get it figured out.”
“Morning, Cas,” Dean starts, but Castiel isn’t paying attention, looking around their kitchen with furrowed brows.
They both look up sharply as Sam’s voice rings down the hall, “Dean?!”
“...Really, we haven’t given you a room yet?”
back into his still body, vertigo hitting almost instantly. His stomach is churning as he blinks his vision clear, eardrums popping like the pressure dropped. He sees Castiel first, looking past his shoulder, and he hears Sam’s annoyed tone before Sam’s in front of him, blowing out the rest of the bowl and waving the smoke away.
Sam lifts up the bowl of leaves, still smoldering smoke, and Dean breathes in.
It makes him feel strange. He ignores it.
It was a stupid, stubborn itch, and one he’s used to ignoring- mostly because he wasn’t sure if it was an itch or an IED, and he wasn’t about to find out.
How had he ever mistaken her for Sam??
How would
yet? It’s like a friggin’ jungle in here, and I’m catching a heat stroke just
“The scent. It must be the water. You’re... coated in it.”
“--like the nectar of the gods.”
“Yes.”
The thought of racing to catch up to him, to do something about all this, seems absurd; as absurd as the break in pattern when Sam suddenly disappears back into his own room, door closing in a soft sweeping slosh of water, leaving nothing but an inch of wet that steamed, sending soft coils of unplaceable scent crawling up Castiel’s skin.
Dean walks the bunker, searching high and low for Sam, but no dice. He hasn’t run into Castiel yet, which is good because his incorrigible and
Her eyes bore into his.
Dean settles slowly, sinking down until they’re flush, skin to skin. Castiel looks up at him helplessly, then away. He breathes, short shallow breaths, trying to steady himself. He’s inside Dean, they’re one and the same, he’d never dreamed of it, not like this-
He grimaces, peels off his damp jeans to slide on a pair of relatively dry boxer briefs, and climbs carefully onto the mattress. He drags himself to the center of his bed and curls up, squeezing his eyes shut to keep the images from superimposing. He’s exhausted; he’s been sleeping, sure, but it all feels like running in place, a constant low-level drain instead of recharging. If he could just
He opens his eyes to footsteps, sitting up to see Sam’s tall shadow pass his open doorway. The taller man is barefoot, and his steps slosh in a way that echoes off the tile, a soft, wet sucking sound.
It shambles forward. Castiel’s blade is in his hand, and something unsteady builds up in his belly, something absurdly like panic.
Castiel has his mouth open to argue (he
“...So anyway, we’re Lucy in the sky with diamonds for now, though I figure what the hell, huh? And our resident angel doesn’t approve, but when’s the last time
Sure, he’s looked a couple times, he’s done his fair share of eye fucking across packed bars but who doesn’t flirt? Flirting’s fun. Flirting’s great. He loves flirting almost as much as he loves women- more, sometimes. He doesn’t count his black-eyed days because that way lies madness and he’s drunk away all he can of that chapter of his life in true Winchester fashion, but demonic ardors aside, he’s never gone and done anything with a guy, so. De facto not gay.
“Where to?”
Sam disappears down the hall, and Dean’s left alone with thoughts that keep trying to drift back to Cas, but the pie is good and he focuses on that. Every bite makes it a little easier...
“So what, you’re some kinda ghost? This your unfinished business or something?”
There’s not even a scratch, of course. As if nothing was ever there.
Dean chokes out a “
How long before they drowned in here?
The steam rises, clings to his lashes, running down the bridge of his nose only to drip back down into the darkness, like it’s drawing him into this strange, humid ecosystem of heat. He can’t see to the bottom, dark beyond the soft curls of wet air. He can only see the stratified layers of cracked cement, of stone, and dense, living earth below—
Sam considers him. He’s still pulling on his shirt. Already, it sticks to his skin.
They’re suddenly, utterly alone, sitting crosslegged across from each other in the center of his bed. It’s a rumpled island of sheets, and the black water billows out slow around it like flat funereal flags.
we don’t know how all this works! It’s about soul connections. He could’ve fried your insides when you connected. You don’t know.”
“It’s only steam. Something… natural, I believe. Not chemical fumes.”
“Oleander. Freshly bloomed. I know what the scent has been, now.”
before—
But unlike most puzzles, there's way too much magic and mysticism tied up in all this shit to make heads or tails of. Give him a carburetor, a radiator- that, he could get it running in no time. This? It's bullshit. A bitch and a half all twisted up together— maybe if he wasn’t sweltering half to death he’d be seeing it clearer.
“You, buddy, are gonna choose a room. Here and now. C’mon.”
“...Sure, Cas. That’s a good idea.” Sam says. Then, he sits next to Dean, and closes his eyes as he relaxes back.
MORE GENERALLY:
He lifts a hand to Dean’s chin. He nudges it back, and for some reason, Dean lets him.
They dissipate in a stop-motion snarl of fog as Castiel opens the door calmly and walks inside.
Sam makes a face at him, but it’s warm and familiar and he doesn’t stop, handing Dean a bowl and some butter, and Dean grins.
“No.” Castiel replies simply.
, his father murmurs, because even a decade later his voice is still etched into the b-side of his brain).
“No, but you’re obviously riding high off all the funtime fumes.”
Next to him, his cell phone rings -- or has it been ringing this whole time? Sound is going in and out of his ears, pulsing around his perception. It rattles noisily on the bedside table, and without taking his eyes off of her, he reaches for it.
It’s been quiet for what feels like weeks, ever since God and the Darkness just… left. No Lucifer, no hunts, no world-ending catastrophe, and Dean has been hovering somewhere between tentative calm and just about ready to slice ‘n’ dice the first thing that looks at him sideways.
Dean finishes off his slice, and reaches for another. Sam nods once. “Okay. Okay, there’s a few more things we need, but I think we’ve got them all. I’ll gather them up. Stay here.”
Dean stares at him for a moment, a bolt of pure panic inside and flippant outside. Sort of, anyway. Enough.
Dean pulls himself out from under the oak table with a shrug, dusting himself off- was that a cheeto? Gross.
“With how many we go through, I really don’t know.” Sam replies dryly from where he’s sitting across from Castiel at the kitchen table, several old manuals laid out in front of him.
Someone.
“Pick up what?”
“....While I am aware that you don’t believe everything you see on television, Dean, at times I have doubt.”
Besides, he’d been ready for it to go sideways. He coulda called it, they could’ve just jerked each other off or something.
Dean relaxes partway; that was something, at least. “Earthquakes in friggin’ Kansas,” he grouses. “I’d say end times, if we hadn’t run that horse into the ground ten times over.”
Sam exhales a soft laugh, the lighter clicking as he lights the bowl. Dean waves at it with a scowl, “Sam, knock it off, we can do this tomorrow.”
“Safe,” Sam echoes again with a firm nod, resonating, like he- they?- like he knows that’s the demand on Dean’s tongue.
He swallows, thumb running over worn silk. He’s tempted to take it off, take it with him, make Cas take it back later, but Castiel had wanted him to leave it be, so he does.
They’re closer, Castiel braced so near that he’s practically in the chair with him, the outside of his thighs bumping the inside of Dean’s and Dean has the delirious nonsensical memory of Lisa in much the same position, only there was a rumpled bed and way,
is making a pie it's probably going to be full of ground up
“I was bored. Thought I’d surprise you.”
It barely fits in the four walls, hunched over low and lumbering. It fixes dark eyes on him.
Castiel heads down the halls with purpose, skirting over the puddles that are beginning to form on the floors. The archives often had the answers they needed. He can fix this. Hopefully, the water in the air wasn’t harming the more fragile records.
The other man doesn’t acknowledge him, and Castiel frowns. Perhaps he's sleepwalking; Dean had spoken of it, several times. Sam’s subconscious uncertainties, anxieties, at times reach a fever pitch, one he would manifest through walking in his sleep, miles and miles of unfulfilled terrain without ever knowing, ever since he was a child. You weren’t to interrupt; it could do more harm than good. Best to let sleeping Sams lie.
Dean eyes him, but tugs his shirt back down into place anyway. “Cas, if I’m sucking up asbestos right now, you’re the one fixing it,” he grumbles, raking his hands through his hair. “Steam… so you think there’s a leaking pipe or some kinda, I don’t know, groundwater or something under there?”
“It’s only a thousand degrees and counting, Cas, you tell me.”
Dean scents the air, tries in vain to find anything other than the faint smell of old paper that never quite faded from the war room, and shrugs.
It’s barely half an hour before he’s given up even that, jamming the rickety old fan in the doorway and letting the door close on it, a whirring breeze that’s at least marginally cooler than his room is currently. It’s funny— he thought it’d be futile, trying to sleep that way, but here… It feels different, somehow.
He’s in his own bed, dripping in sweat. His heart is too tight in his chest, and he rubs at it hard with the heel of his hand as he looks around his empty room, trying to blink away the afterimages.
“An illusion, Dean.” Her lips don’t move, but he hears her, a murmur in his mind’s eye. “Sorry, it wasn’t really under my control.” She has a grassroots clip to her vowels that Dean faintly recognizes as familiar, a roll that reminds him of the gas station or the diner in town, oldtimers jawing over cheap coffee.
Nothing answers him. Even his echoes have dampened down, as if the steam is eating his words as they escape his mouth. All he can hear is dripping water and his own breath.
“Isn’t that one for the lighting system?” Castiel points out over his shoulder, gravel against his ear, and Dean nearly swears, skin prickling from the bolt of his jaw to his gut.
“I have it.” He hears Castiel’s voice instead, the ladder steadying almost instantly, “Sam left to go look at the electrical panel again and see if he’s missed anything.”
Dean can pretend otherwise all he wants, but he knows the look on his face from who knew how many others - he always knew when he was
“—what?”
“Uh. Cas! Heeeyyyy.” He has to force the words out, and hopes they don’t sound too much like it.
In any matter, from outside this fixed point, he can let his mind wander; was Dean dreaming, right now? What of? Though he purposes not to “eavesdrop”, as Sam puts it, thanks to their oft-repeated stance on the matter, sometimes their minds were all but shouting to be heard-- and those shouts were rarely pleasant meanderings or daydreams. He is gratified, almost, to walk by Sam’s room and hear nothing, an emptiness that spoke of calm, rather than the young man’s usual well-buried turmoil.
But Castiel had made sure he couldn’t find Dean a long time ago.
Fresh out of the oven, the pie looks amazing. Perfectly toasted at the edges, steam rising from the middle... It crackles delicately when Sam cuts into it to get them each a slice.
Dean smirks as Sam’s broad frame lumbers out of the kitchen. He takes his half-empty mug to the sink, spinning on the tap to rinse it out, but yanks back just as quick as scalding hot water spills out, burning his fingers. He drops the mug and it clatters into the sink, spilling the loose pink and green leaves of the tea.
Dean’s already working at Castiel’s coat, the buttons of his crisp shirt, quick needy hands as his tongue sticks out the side of his mouth in concentration. “So many goddamn layers,” he grumbles, and Castiel placates him by laying a hand over his jeans, feeling out the length of him before rolling his palm against it. Dean keens his want, deep in his throat, and Castiel’s never heard that noise from him before.
He studies his glass, amber and gold. Dips a finger into it. Coating it in the whiskey, and when he lifts his hand it drips in languid, easy rolls over his knuckles. It’s thick like syrup, rose-tinted gold. Castiel’s spent enough time with Dean to know it wasn’t quite right.
He gets footing enough to turn and run, only sliding once through the water pooling at the crossroads. He needs ground- needs space to think, to plan, his gears grinding.
Two plates are set out at the table, left as they were, half eaten slices of pie still speared by forks- the two must not be far, then.
Castiel steps into the kitchen, following the warm scent of dough. The counter is clean, dishes dripping dry, but neither Sam nor Dean are present.
And Castiel does. He doesn’t miss the way Dean watches.
thinking that, but y’know. Thanks Cas.” Dean mutters, lifting it into the light.
He reaches both hands into the crevice and collects an armful of oleander. It should be easy enough to come up with a plan, now that they knew what they were up against.
The lights come back to life with a muted flicker, and he gives the box another once-over before shoving the door shut with a creak. It still takes him jamming his shoulder against it to get it closed all the way, but it’s almost satisfying.
How long has he been wandering this desert?
Uhhm so you know how the rating went up? it's this chapter's fault. this is not camilla's fault. camilla is a good writing saint. camilla tried to stop me but too late now. camilla = word smart, hanzie = all gumption meets zero upstairs brain. I ARGUED FOR THIS. ??? paying for it now in spades of embarrassment but welp . merry christmas babyyy (insert 'the mortifying ordeal of being known' here)
He fills Sam in with what little he’s got, though he leaves out Cas’ mouth or the broad fingers twined through his and… Really, he pretty much just leaves the car out of it, a neat little omission he doesn’t give a second thought to. Habit.
“Dean,” Sam repeats, soft as anything. “That’s okay. That’s good.”
Dean freezes midstep and almost just pinwheels back out of the room, but too late- Castiel’s already looking at him over his shoulder, and Dean is pinned in place about as surely as a dead bug in one of Sam’s seventh grade science projects.
It’s an unwelcome thought, and one that he banishes immediately. The haze is getting to him, no doubt.
Sam stares at him blankly for a moment, and then throws his hands up. “No- yes, I mean, that’s where he always is now, so I figured, okay? And by the way, Dean’s not exactly lifting a finger to help, either.” Sam says. He purses his lips, tapping the desk in an agitated thump-thump-thump before he continues, tone heaving a 180 so quick it leaves Castiel in the dust.
“--What, and you weren’t? Cas-” Dean is keyed up but he’s studying him now, Castiel realizes. He tries to pull back himself, but Dean’s grip only tightens, “...You didn’t do anything wrong, okay? We were four sheets to the wind. You think it’s the first time I’ve--”
Castiel shifts a little closer, looking down at his glass. Should he be concerned? Why? Perhaps Dean is concerned- “It won’t kill us, if that’s what you’re wondering. You’re fine.”
He doesn’t notice passing through a pleasantly surprising buzz until he’s too deep to care, the library a hazy, comforting cocoon around him. Around them. Dean had been right: this was a good idea. He finally feels relaxed, for the first time in... days? He isn’t even sure, but it doesn’t seem so important, either. He lets his shoulders fall, rolling his neck slowly as he leans back against the side of the table, and realizes Dean’s worn boots aren’t up next to him anymore.
Castiel is still. And when he looks up at Dean, the smirk on his face isn’t so much lazy as languid. His hands are cooler than they have any right to be, a balm on too-hot skin.
Naturally, it opens like a flower under Castiel’s touch.
Sam nods slowly. “Well, let’s keep close. Wait for this to blow over. I figure we can try the ritual one more time... But if that doesn’t work, I found some dynamite. We can tackle that stone again.”
Coupling
“Yeah, that’s a hard no on the hive mind-”
He remembers archaic Enochian script, winding over his ribs on radiographic film. Remembers feeling weirdly overwhelmed that it lived under his skin. The strange ache of losing Castiel’s eye on him, even back then.
Sam asks his question carefully— and great, he’s using his practiced harmless concerned tone, like he has the kid gloves ready to go in case big brother finally has that last meltdown and-
“What, no opinion on all this?” He raises a brow, a little sarcastic, a little prodding, and frowns because Sam’s got his thoughtful face on. Dean waits like he’s supposed to, and finally Sam sighs.
“Pie? ...Oh-- you mean Dean’s thing? Wouldn’t leave me alone til I tried it. Gross, right? But mostly… really weird. I figured I’d look up those flowers and-- look, we should be concerned about him, right?”
Castiel runs a hand over the smooth grooves of one of the sigils, shoving his thumb against it like he can erase it with sheer force of will — which, normally, would yield a very satisfactory result. This lack of response in any manner, heavenly or no, is rapidly turning into a burr in his skin. He even vaguely recognizes the language, which is bothersome enough.
? What, just sit on my thumbs while you go interrogate Sam over- No way. I’m going.”
“--perfect vessel,” Dean’s voice is strained, anguish and anger all wound up in one, “--have to-- Michael needs his sword-”
“Get your own line, sasquatch.”
“Ask.” Sam says, voice soft and low.
He’d thought, a while back, that there was maybe something to the way Castiel watched him.
“I know, I know, but… the last rites we did? I think Castiel’s angel mojo threw them off. I didn’t go under all the way, not really. Did you?”
share exactly how many, I’ll make us some sweet-ass victory burgers?”
Dean’s head is spinning a little, swimming, and it’s not unpleasant but he’s not in control of it all the way, and he opens his mouth again to retort but Sam is waiting, blinking his eyes open slowly. Sam’s pupils are wide and dark, swallowing up sunflower flecks of gold.
“...What do you mean, last night?”
Castiel watches, examining him until Dean lifted a brow at him quite directly, raising his voice though he knew that Castiel could hear him in the faintest whisper.
Castiel is still naked as well, lying on his back, sheet folded neatly over his hips. He doesn't know what to do about that, either. Dressing while Dean was still naked felt improper, somehow. Uneven.
“Jesus, Cas. Nice survival instincts, there.”
supposed to know-
It’s pale, a silent, bone-white monolith. It doesn’t beckon, or shun, or repel— it just does the thing huge boulders do, namely ‘being hefty’ and ‘getting in the way’. Dean knows he should care that it’s there.
“Only if you’ve got a white sand beach and a balmy breeze on hand. Oh, and maybe some friendly babes in seriously- and I mean
The beast lurches at him, and Castiel strikes.
He hadn’t felt it the first time with Sam, he hardly remembers any of that, but the bowl with Cas... it clicks. Feels familiar.
“Ah. Sorry about your shirt. Usually one would be naked for this.”
“Of course not. Why would we?”
His eyes open with a gasp, the world silhouetted in sharp relief around him. He takes it in with the sweeping, spiked post-adrenaline of a fight. A farmhouse. Dead vamps on the floor, masks scattered, heads still rolling. Somewhere, he knows there are two kids, running but safe. Saved.
his hands are there, just that they
Sam’s the first to break the muggy silence.
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dinner is like any other night, despite the heaviness of the air. The stove radiates a more normal heat, and the burgers are flipping delicious, if Dean says so himself. To be fair, he’s spent more trial and error time than he cares to count up figuring out what went into a burger that really made Cas’ mouth water. And, despite Sam’s grumbling about heart attacks and cholesterol, his brother always puts aside the salads and quinoa and unending broiled chicken whenever Dean cooks for them.
“And heart.” She whispers-- and cuts their connection. The gray caves in around Dean and takes him with it, dropping like a stone to slam back into himself.
Nothing continues to ring, and the sound fills his ears like buzzing.
Castiel remembers showers; as a human, he’d rather enjoyed them. He’d even attempted a cold shower, once, at Dean’s suggestion. At least, he’d taken it as an actual suggestion, and thus given it a solid try.
Dean reaches forward, seeing and not-seeing, delving deeper.
The entryway is blocked by a bone-white stone, a slab nearly as tall as Sam when he loses that slight tall guy hunch and lets himself fill a space. It has a hand-hewn roundness to it, and a strange texture that resolved upon study into hundreds, thousands of sigils, every inch of alabaster covered.
Sam waits, unmoving, like some kind of living stasis.
about basically everyone they'd met didn't mean... It didn't mean the same).
Dean stares at him, eyes narrowing in confusion. “...So you’re just
Naturally, he finds Castiel first.
With a snarl, he throws it to the ground. It crashes, skipping on the puddle and sending ripples swaying around his feet.
“Fair enough.” Curling his fingers into the shirt that they had been laying on, Gabriel pulled Sam along to the private elevator at the back of the large room. Sami rolled his eyes as they passed while Amenadiel just shook his head. Cas and Dean on the other hand just smiled and nodded, respectively. It was probably a good thing that the elder Winchester seems to have given his blessing, though he didn’t doubt for one minute that he was going to get away without getting one of the Winchester style shovel talks. He was actually looking forward to it. They were almost as good at meting out vengeance as he was, and that said something given that he was a trickster, and they were only human.
Bowing down Dean placed the softest whisper of a kiss on Cas’ lips, before he released his face and instead wrapped his arms around the angel’s torso. With what seemed like almost no effort, he straightened and lifted Cas off of his feet. Cas’ arms moved so that they were wrapped around the taller man’s shoulders, as they hugged for a long minute. When Dean let him down, he didn’t release his hold at all to Cas’ contentment.
He nearly flinched when Sammykins reached out with one hand and tucked a loose strand of hair back behind his ear. The other man’s fingers lingering on his cheek. Gabriel could feel his wings start to shiver in response to his proximity to the other man, but he kept them tight against his back no matter how much he wanted to stretch and reach them forward to wrap Sam up in them. It wouldn’t do to let the patrons of his brother’s club see that they were very much the real dealio. As long as they thought that they were just fake cosplay wings that was one thing, but he had promised Sami to keep them under control while he was downstairs in the club.
As the video restarted a peppy blond reporter made what were probably supposed to be sexy faces at the camera.
Sam nodded right as the elevator dinged and stopped, its doors sliding open. With a hand that was careful not to touch the wings themselves, the taller man guided Gabriel out and into the large room beyond. “They’re beautiful. I just thought...”

Gabriel smiled as he conjured up a mini sized Snickers from wherever he kept his never-ending supply of them. “Yup.” He popped his ‘p’ just before he popped the chocolate into his mouth. “So, who’d you off? Please tell me it was someone who deserved it, especially if dear old Dad was willing to look the other way about it.”
“I’m sure he’s forgiven you.” She laid a hand on Ella’s shoulder. “We all thought it was fake. Well, all of us except Azrael and their Dad.” With a shrug Chloe hopped off the counter and went back to where she had laid out the taco supplies. “I guess Azrael has a super sense when it comes to things like that since she’s Death or something.”
He hated that he had to dash her hopes, but… “He’s not here. He’s in the other realm, the one Casi and I came from.” He felt tears start to well up again. “He’s one of the few people I actually do miss from there.”

“So, no hunting?”
Drowning - Radio Company
“So, you’ll teach me how to do that?” Trixie asked as she pulled away from her sort of step-uncle and pointed to where Cas and Lucifer were going through a basic kata, while Amenadiel was patiently talking Dean through the same.
Cas had the startling realization that he hadn't and in his surprise his words came out whispered on a sigh. "If I had, what would you have said?"
“Thank you. It did.” Cas watched silently as Linda moved to leave the room, just before she was out of sight, they called out to her. “Doctor Martin, please call me Cas.”
The low voice that came from his sibling was raspy and barely a whisper, but it drew a soft smile to his lips anyways. Looking over his sibling, he realized that he did remember them. “Your older brother.” He kept his own voice calm and quiet, in the manner that his detective had long despaired of convincing him to use with case victims. Switching out of English and into the multi-phonic Enochian speech of their family was as easy as breathing, and he figured that it could only help his case convincing his sibling that they were safe. “You are one of the 144 lost-taken-stolen fledglings. Youngest-save-one of my siblings. You are my beloved-favorite-happiness. Little-tiny-bright spot. Casi, my brother-sister-light Castiel.”
“I doubt you’d be able to keep up.” Amenadiel sounded confident in that, completely disregarding that Cas was rolling their eyes and smirking at him.
Looking up into the shattered mirror, he caught sight of a blond haired woman. The same one who he had seen earlier go towards his baby brother-sister-mote’s room. She looked utterly unperturbed by the fact that he had thrown a glass and her lips were drawn into a smile as soft as her voice. “Who are you?”
Once they had both nodded at him, Lucifer started to sing the opening verse of the song, Gabriel taking over halfway through and then Cas joined both of them on the chorus. Dean was entranced. Moving closer to the banister, Dean leaned on the railing smiling as he watched the three sing his favorite song, switching out who was singing at different points in the verses. He didn’t even react to Sam coming up to lean against the rail by his side.
“What the hell dude? What’s wrong?”
Standing next to the piano that Morningstar guided Gabriel to, was the tiny darker skinned person, who Dean could only hope was Cas since they looked like the person from the video. But he wasn’t completely sure given that they were not dressed in a navy-blue suit and matching tie, but instead they were wearing a bright blue tunic that fell to midthigh and loose black slacks and their hair was hanging in a loose braid down their back. They too had large wings tucked against their back, but theirs were raven wing black and were reflecting just about every color of the rainbow almost as if their wings had crystals embedded in them.

Elohim nodded. “Azrael could you tell Sam what you told Me about his brother, please.”
~*~*~
Half an hour later, Dean was actually proven right, much to his surprise as a valet took the keys to go park Baby and a few fangirls and boys in the lines took their pictures as the bouncer ushered them into the building. After getting past the entrance, which oddly enough didn’t have metal detectors or even a security check, Dean pulled Sam into an alcove.
“It does, doesn’t it. Little bro knows what he likes and what he doesn’t.” He looked up towards the ceiling for a moment in thought. “And who for that matter.” Looking back to his bonded, he grinned. “Cas will decide when he’s ready to settle on pronouns in his own time. But for now…” He waggled his eyebrows causing Sam to laugh. “Tell me all about what you’ve been up to lately big boy and maybe I can break out the whipped cream later and we can have some fun.”
Rather than angering Lucifer, Dean’s snark actually made the archangel laugh. Dean could see that he was just getting ready to say something else when he was shoved to the side so that he fell into his brother. The space where he had been standing was immediately filled by the youngest archangel who was grinning, his whiskey eyes dancing with laughter as he watched his brothers stumble over each other.
With a nod, Cas, reached out and took the cuff of Dean’s sleeve in their hand. They stared at the familiar handprint stained into the fabric of the green jacket’s shoulder feeling unsure what to do next. They just knew that they didn’t want to be in the club anymore, nor did they want to be upstairs where Gabriel and Sam had gone. Looking at their brothers, Cas asked as quietly as they could, if they could leave. Cas waited until they both nodded, Sami with a soft understanding smile and Amenadiel with a touch of confused concern.
“That’s what you took from that?”
Jack’s gaze fell to where their hands were joined. “You might not be able to come back.”
Linda nodded as though she expected to hear that. “Not surprising. Everyone has their breaking point when it comes to being treated like that. If you don’t mind my asking, what was the catalyst for you?”
for this chapter:
Casi nodded, glancing over their shoulder once, before looking at Lucifer. “Thank you, Sami. My wings were not corporeal where I was prior to this.”
Songs from the
Elohim nodded, “Yes.”
Gabriel found himself nodding as a swell of sadness filled him again. It was odd that he missed his nephew Jack, having only briefly met the kid, but he kind of did. “I wish I could introduce you to my nephew Jack.” The words fell from his lips before he knew that he was going to say them. But even as he realized that he had said them, he realized that they were true. Cas had raised a good kid.
“I know they’re not!” Gabriel raised both of his hands, now clutched into fists again and rubbed them against his eyes as he let out a low growl. When he lowered his hands, his face was hard, but there were tears evident in his eyes. “I am the Angel of Protection. I love humanity. I died for humanity. I fought a version of Michael to protect humans. I am bound to a human and I ache every day that I am not by his side. But Sami you need to understand, I am not like you.” He paused long enough to take in several gasps of air as he threw his head back to look up at the ceiling. Once he had calmed a bit, he looked back at Lucifer. “I am the Archangel of Judgement and I am a Spirit of Vengeance and I have been for thousands of years. I have walked among humanity for that entire time. I have seen them at their best and their worst. The only humans that I have ever permanently killed deserved what they got. Have I gone too far a few times… probably. But this was not one of those times. This was so mild compared to what I could have done to those bastards.”
The kid started to look a little bit flustered and started to play with His fingers as His brows drew together. It was a look that Sam had often seen on Cas and Gabriel when they were worried and trying to hide it. Feeling a swell of compassion, Sam reached out a hand and placed it palm up on the table in front of Jack. Once the younger man had taken it and lifted His eyes to meet his own, Sam smiled softly.
“Before?” Whiskey eyes met chocolate, before narrowing as their owner contemplated the other male angel. After a moment Gabriel’s face reflected shock as he straightened pushing Cas until they were almost completely behind him. His eyes hardened as he pressed Cas awkwardly into his back. “Tell me the truth. What I remember, is it real?”
Daniel took a careful half step forward, even as the blade swung closer to him as the person holding it trembled. Meeting unfocused eyes, he spoke quietly in what he hoped was a soothing tone. “You’re looking for someone? I can help. I’m a Detective with the LAPD. I can help you find who you’re looking for. Just tell me your name.”
Hopping off the bar stool, he ignored the startled exclamation of the demon and jogged the short distance to sweep Cas up into a hug. Once he pulled away, he grinned at the relieved expression on baby bro’s face. He waggled his eyebrows just to see Cas’ eyes lighten more. “What do you say we go bother big bro down in that fancy club of his? Get up to a little mischief.”
Sounds of Someday - Radio Company
Gabriel shared a few quiet words with Dean Winchester before his attention was diverted to the taller, longer haired man standing behind the hunter. Lucifer was only able to identify them as Sam and Dean Winchester because Ella had made him watch a few episodes of that hideous show with her. It had upset him the first time he had watched it, especially when they had reached the episodes that had featured Gabriel’s death. Even if it was just an actor who looked like him, there was no mistaking those whiskey gold eyes. He couldn’t watch it anymore after the episode where he had to watch his baby brother’s eyes widen in shocked betrayal as that world’s version of Lucifer stabbed him. Of course, that didn’t stop him from throwing the themed charity event at his siblings’ request.
“My son is a Nephilim.” She shrugged as she smiled. “A mortal, as far as we know, Nephilim, but still…”
Lucifer actually felt himself take a step back when his brother’s voice raised to a yell. There was something seriously wrong with his brother if he thought that that was okay. That humans meant so little. “There are rules about things like this. Humans are not toys.”
Sam nodded. “We will.”

It wasn’t until Sam and Dean woke up from their naps that Sam admitted to Dean that he had prayed to Gabriel. “I don’t know if he heard me, but I wanted him to know that I knew he was alive.”
I hope everyone has a happy and joyous New Year. Stay safe and remember for those who drink, please drink responsibly. And that was my year end PSA, we'll see you back here with another chapter next week. Happy New Year!

He waved a dismissive hand as he shook his head, while Trixie looked up at him curiously. “Maybe not, but you did learn not to turn into an emotionally repressed homicidal maniac when his contract came due.” Looking down at the young human attached to his side he smiled softly at her. “It was a big thing at the time. I tried to teach that lunkhead a lesson by sticking him in a time loop.”
Sam learns a bit more about Gabriel.
Cas waved a hand at the room's only chair. “Please.”
Blanking, he turned to face her again, as he blinked several times. “What?”
Goin' Straight - Dick Jr. & the Volunteers
“Everything?”
“I saw that.”
Sighing, Lucifer reached up and rubbed his face. Thousands of years. There was no way that he would be able to keep his brother from extracting vengeance for slights if that was the way he had been for that long, but maybe he could impose a few rules or at the least let him know what the big rules in this realm were. Holding up a hand he forestalled anything further that his brother might have said. “Dad has one big rule for us. It is a rule that only I have ever broken, and Dad actually condoned it. We do not kill humans.”
Chloe just nodded as she slowly put together all of the ingredients for the tacos that she had promised to make everyone for movie night. “Yup he does.”
Dean nodded, he wasn’t about to fault his brother for following his urge to pray to Gabriel when he was too chicken shit to do the same and pray to Cas. Somehow it was just not something that he was ready for. It was… there was just something in his gut that was holding him back. It was similar to the fear that had held him back from telling Cas how he really felt just about all of the years that he knew the angel. He knew that he could have told him so many times, but… there was always a but. He hated that, but Dean didn’t know what to do to actually break past that. He was hoping that when he saw Cas that he would finally know what to say and what to do.
Cas knew what they themself needed and personally they needed Dean. It was odd to not have the gender of Jimmy Novack anymore, but at the same time… he… they… it was hard to pick or even know what they were anymore. Cas had been male for over a dozen years and gotten quite used to it even though they had been female in the vessel prior to Jimmy and nongendered when in-between. The body that Cas currently occupied was both and yet neither and Sami said that it was what Cas had originally had and that it was up to them what gender they wanted.
“I’ll miss you too. Just take care of Cas and Uncle Gabe okay.”
However, it turned out that he only allowed Cas and Gabe to still call him Sami. It would seem that he went by Lucifer now. A fact that had made Gabriel laugh until he started to cry again when they were told. Gabriel had spent a great deal of time crying over the last couple of days. It made Cas uneasy to see their usually happy brother so somber and heartbroken. Whenever they came across their brother, Cas would make sure to hug him like they had used to do with Dean. Cas wasn’t sure how well it helped their brother, but Gabriel always had a smile for Cas afterwards. Even if it was just a tiny one.
The bewildered tone of his sibling’s voice, delighted Lucifer. It would seem that his dear baby sibling even now still retained some of their innocence, though he could feel the taint of guilt and loss on their Grace. “I do believe darling that no one will be looking at your feet, especially if you don’t winch in your wings.”
The next scrape is so close he can hear the wet edge of the puddle it drags through.
The three of them sit around the kitchen table.
figured out a few things, if Sam would stop long enough to listen), but he falters. “...You saw that?” He thinks of Dean’s fingers on his; heat flushes through his veins, swelling to his cheeks.
“Chill, man. It’s too hot to think, or all this… whatever you’re doing. Aren’t you
truly unfortunate level of self-awareness with the knowledge that him and Cas in the library hadn’t been a future vision- that they’d already gotten down to brass tacks twice, pretty much in less than a day? Twice could still be a coincidence, something he can brush off, but the thought of three times? That thought makes him sweat.
Castiel watches Dean, sprawled out long at his feet. He has one leg up, an elbow resting on a bent knee. His head is tilted back against the stone, almost as if in supplication.
Dean whips around the corner after Sam’s voice and Castiel chases, but as soon as he turns the corner- it’s empty. It’s a long corridor, straight and open. Dean should be there. He’d been right there--
Castiel takes what he presumes is a hint and showers, something bittersweet and aching about washing off the scent of them, but he’s all too aware that his vessel is sticky and sweaty and filthy in ways that have nothing to do with dirt.
“That’s
“Nothing concrete yet, but I’m chasing a lead.”
And with him and Castiel… Even if Cas did have a thing for him back then, he’s never said a word about it, so Dean figures it’s sorted. They’ve only gotten closer since then, and Castiel is too smart to carry a torch for Dean fucking Winchester. Dean’s even kind of relieved, because it means his best friend is unshakably his- and it’s just one less way that Dean can screw it up.
“Sam!”
, lady-”
Dean blinks, like he’d been just starting a spiel and wasn’t expecting not to finish it—  likely because that was exactly the case. But Castiel doesn’t see the purpose in it; while he enjoys hearing Dean talk, even this sleep deprived ramble, he’s already made up his mind.
“...Don’t worry, Dean. I’m going to fix this. Take rest.”
“...Okay.” Dean breathes out slowly, and it takes, somehow. He can feel it under his skin, spreading like warm molasses.
“Has anything happened, Dean? Do you feel strange, or unusual?”
Completely naked.
Dean starts to come down soon enough, a flushed vision that Castiel can’t tear his eyes from as he mumbles Castiel’s name, shifting against him in a way that makes Castiel give a startled moan and realize he’s been utterly still, buried in Dean as Dean shudders to a finish.
The bottle is endless, Castiel is certain. Hours later and it’s still half full, amber warm and comforting in Castiel’s glass as Dean keeps it from emptying. He’s leaning back against the edge of the table, Dean tilted back perilously far in a chair almost directly in front of him. His boots are up on the table next to Castiel, ankles crossed loosely and shin bumping Castiel’s thigh whenever he shifts.
Dean stops entirely, because it felt like his stomach dropped right out of him.
“-All I know is that Sam doesn’t feel like himself. He knows things he shouldn’t about where we’ve been, what we’ve been doing,” Dean shoots him a strange look, but Castiel continues before he can interrupt, “And then there’s your bowl rituals. The mark of them is truth. What Sam said about the waters isn’t true. Pneuma can and have been extinguished. I know this. I simply don’t know
until the concrete cracks under his grip. Crumbles. He tears and he tears and he throws the broken pieces that don’t fall in aside until he can start to see darkness opening up below, water pouring in a ring past him and disappearing into the darkness with a wet roar.
is barely even here yet, Dean. Besides, what do you know about mornings?” Sam grumbles right back, but mostly he’s ignoring him.
For whiskey, it’s strange, he notices in a faraway sort of way. It hits him hard, curling and coiling warmly inside him. Thicker, sweeter than he anticipates, lush on his tongue. But Dean grins at him, and that’s sweeter still.
He searches for his angel blade but doesn’t know where his coat had landed-- but with Dean moving so quickly he has a stab of fear that he’ll lose him in the haze if he doesn’t keep up, so he forgoes it to race after him. He’s hardly a step behind, and together they pad barefoot across the wet floors, carving paths through rising steam.
The world spins crookedly around them but they’re the burning center of this hazy little universe and Dean isn’t about to let go, hands digging into the starchy fabric of his slacks, thumbs hooking the sharp angle of his hips--
“Shit. Yeah… Yeah, okay. So tomorrow, we figure it out. Tonight, we just boil. Peachy.”
“Close your eyes when you kiss, huh?” Dean murmurs against his jaw, and Castiel can feel the way his lips curve against his skin and then, against his mouth, husky and oddly flustered for a man with his hand tangled in Castiel’s hair, “I mean it, don’t be- don’t be weird, alright?” so Castiel obeys.
Castiel tries to keep up, but it’s complicated without the ambrosia easing the way, overthinking every shift and touch. Dean’s mouth is too warm on his, slower at first but now like second nature. Dean’s eyes are closed but only just, like nothing outside of arm’s reach concerns him and-- Dean opens his eyes, slowing for a second as they meet Castiel’s headon, uncharacteristic pink cresting his cheeks before his gaze flicks away.
“-- Or what it says, right?” Sam cuts in, studying Castiel’s face, “Because you can’t read it, either.”
Into him.
, something’s
It felt real.
He remembers Castiel’s eyes, darkening with heat. Broad, callused hands, not unlike his own. Castiel is nothing like Anna - no, more, she’s nothing like Castiel. If it had been real, anyway. He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to remember details that’ll prove it one way or the other and immediately regrets it as his traitorous dick jumps, skin heating at the memory of Castiel pushed up against him, frenetic rubbing off and--
Sam inhales deeply, but he doesn’t close his eyes this time, gaze fixed on Dean. Dean’s head slumps aside and he watches him right back, unerring.
He can faintly hear Sam shouting for them across the haze as he gathers Dean up, tilting his head away from the water. Dean’s panting, eyes rolled up in his head, mumbling panicked things Castiel can’t make out. And of course, the steam, he needs to get him away-
“Yeah?” Dean growls. He sounds worn through, and Castiel feels an instant twinge of sympathy despite his annoyance.
It’s hardly a minute before Castiel is sitting alone at the bed, a damp hand towel in his hand.
Dean’s hands are all over him, touching and brushing and checking like he might be missing something, or like his hand might come away bloody even though Castiel’s clothes are only damp with water, and Dean looks too concerned for Castiel’s sense of urgency.
He has regrets.
“The beast. It was pursuing me, it must be close.”
Once it’s filled, Sam lays the dough out over it like a lumpy blanket, and then it’s in the oven.
“-’the world likes pie’, sure, so why not try something new? Hey, come over here and help.”
“He’s an
“...Not a word.” Sam frowns, “...Cas, you got anything here?” He watches Castiel come closer, the angel’s shoulders squaring as he looks between them.
Castiel paces faster. The room numbers drift by, counting up and down and out of order. Time unwinds gently around him, minutes spinning away into hours, as if he’s simply forgotten the way human seconds felt like eons.
“...Well, you get that it makes sense, right? Breathing in the steam. Becoming an oracle. Once you’re fully ascended, it won’t be a problem at all getting us out of here - I mean, you’ll already know how we’re going to do it.”
Her hand squeezes his, and she leans close enough to kiss his cheek, lipstick smearing a red gash across his skin. She scrapes the smoking bowl with a finger, and streaks ash up his neck. Across his mouth, charred sour on his lips.
Sam shakes his shoulder away from Castiel’s touch, and Castiel takes a step back, studying him.

kinda fantasy.
Dean scowls, “Sure, but what do they
The walls are deep navy, and aside from the made up bed, it’s barely more than furnished. A desk sits empty in one corner, chair tucked in neatly. The boxes Dean had mentioned are piled haphazardly on top of a side drawer.
Sam had laughed at his gooseprickled skin and sour mouth for the entire evening after.
, Cas.”
in the middle of it all. There isn't any room for ringing phones, or lurking shadows. Castiel eclipses all of it, a glistening halo in low light, honey dripping hot and sticking between them.
“Dean,” he hears from faraway as she turns back to him, eyes pale and liquid as the steaming lake. Pitying, almost. “You can’t break the compulsion.”
vibrates in Dean’s throat right as it escapes his mouth and the way they catch and slide between them, Dean’s cock dripping a wet smear across Castiel’s stomach.
She lets her thin robes slide off her shoulders, draping it over him. The filmy gray fabric shushes over his bare skin along with her fingertips, touch as much a goodbye as her lips.
Dean leans up and Castiel closes the space left between them, his mouth on Dean’s. It’s all Castiel needs for a spark of arousal that runs far hotter than any bit of grace.
“...You, uh. You do laundry now?”
and something shoves through him, skin and bone giving way with a wet snap. He can feel it lodge inside his chest, cold and sharp and too, too big.
Dean takes the opening without hesitation, grabbing a fistful of Castiel’s shirt this time with a sharp jerk. Castiel pushes back, and there’s a flurry of motion Castiel can’t track, frustration more than fury driving them backwards until Dean’s hips hit the side of his bed and they stumble. Dean curses, dragging them both down, a short scuffle that lands both of them breathing hard with Dean’s back flat on his bed.
His sheets still smell like Cas, he realizes. He tries to ignore it, push his face into his pillow and just zone out until the world’s rightside up again, but his brain won’t shut up.
Castiel takes a beat before he answers, fingers stilling on his temples. His eyes barely flick to Dean’s, something that Dean doesn’t miss. Something Cas isn’t saying.
A pause, and he lifts a hand to Dean’s shoulder—  his right shoulder, because while he doesn’t avoid his left, there was something unavoidably intimate about laying his hand onto the faded, perfectly fitted handprint on the man’s skin. Pleasant and strange as it may be in that first moment, it then unfailingly made Dean quite impossible to deal with for days after, all one-liners and circular brush-offs that make Castiel tired.
He was going to let go, but Dean’s hand clasped over his, fingers around his wrist, expression irritated.
“High as hell.”
“Smell what? Ah-- c’mon, don’t tell me something sprung a leak.”
Dean’s shirt is stuck to him again, and he fans himself with a hand as sweat rolls down his throat to soak into his crewneck.
Behind him, the call wall is going mad. A tattered box of cell phones is threatening to rattle right off the table, strays clattering against the desktop, filling his ears til he’s drowning in it-
in the bunker with us?”
A figment.
“‘Why’?” Sam repeats, “I mean, why
He throws his knife back onto his rumpled bed and pulls on his robe, immediately regretting it in the muggy warmth and yanking it back off. Fuck it.
“I got nothin’, Cas.” Dean shakes his head, “Hey, I’m gonna take a look around, see if anything aside from the lights’ve gone hinky. I figure maybe a fuse blew somewhere. Hell, maybe they’re gamed to pop off in case of a quake- Men of Letters planned for just about everything else, so I mean, who knows. You coming?”
Where they’re slowly soaking into his shirt.
Dean tilts his head back, their noses bumping. Castiel rolls into him, swallows down the jagged sound Dean makes and keeps it for himself. He starts to move again, Dean’s thighs tight around his waist, but he refuses to let Dean overwhelm him; he wants to give him this. It’s the only thing holding him back from falling over that peak himself and drowning in white-hot heat.
He clicks the safety back on, holstering his gun. The metal’s a cool weight against the small of his back. A shiver tingles at his skin, and he adjusts his jacket with a tug.
Castiel comes to a crossroads, sitting down on his haunches. He rakes his hands through his hair. He looks left, right, forwards, back where he’d come - or was it? It’s all the same. The bunker was broken.
“We shouldn’t have.” It’s clipped. Castiel braces himself to be pushed away, but Dean doesn’t push, or even let go. He just keeps him close. So Castiel continues instead, “You were under the ambrosia’s effects--”
“Give it up already, Cas, c’mon,” Dean says, and the tone of his voice is unlike him, low and drifting. He’s sitting on the steps and leisurely leaning up against the stone, soaking in the cool of the surface; it’s only lukewarm, but compared to the stifling heat growing around them, it’s like ice. He’s halfway to falling asleep, Castiel can read it in his low-leveled lethargy- something else he found peculiar. He’s found Dean quite used to running on empty— at times, it even seemed like he preferred it. Yet another self-destructive habit to keep the man busy, he supposes.
Her hand lowers out of the corner of his eye, pressing against his bare chest. Chipped nails dig into his skin.
And for all Dean’s swagger, he’s the first one to admit that he’s absolutely, definitely, the wrong guy.
Sam studies him, and Dean expects questions, concern, anything-- but Sam just rubs a giant hand over the back of his neck.
They all pause. Castiel is staring at the stone with a furrowed brow.
“You kiddin’ Cas? That movie was basically the goddamn History Channel— Oh! Hey, can I tell the future now? How do I tell when that great little grease diner in town is gonna open up again because I tell ya, I let Sam do the grocery runs too many times in a row and personally, I need some honest to god triple bypass style chili fries-”
"With- baking??" Dean’s pretty sure Sam’s never baked in his goddamn life. Come to think of it, he isn’t sure he has, either- “Why?”
His skin is already pinking sharply. It’s only a few fingers, but they’re stinging dry and hot and, well, that’s definitely gonna leave a mark. He waves his hand in the air to try and cool them, because twisting the tap to what’s generally the frigid prairie morning side doesn’t do anything to lower the temperature. He goes for the icebox next, only stilling when Cas steps up behind him and reaches out to clasp his hand in his own. Dean automatically tries to brush him off, but it’s too late.
He flips the faucet cooler than he usually likes it, just to shake the last of the flush from his skin. So it’s just salt in the wound when the shower spits hot water onto his shoulders, jolting him awake even faster than the cold shower he’d been aiming for.
life, as always, is a frigging disaster... but WE'RE BACK Y'ALL. thanks for waiting (I promise, chapter four's nearly here with some A+ weird deancas content, and the rest has been plotted out from the get-go). And also, jsyk, empirical and definitely unbiased studies have shown that comments
Dean’s eyes flick up to him at the sound, almost startled, but there’s a pleased little twist to his mouth that makes Castiel’s skin prickle from head to toe, a “there you are,” in a tone Castiel won’t soon forget.
And when he opens his eyes, he’s alone.
Castiel ponders his day, and he wanders, as he usually does. He makes circles through the bunker, hands clasped loosely at the small of his back. There’s a usual path that he treads: it circles through the lower layers first, and then slowly back to more well-tread paths to emerge near the hallways where the bedrooms were, and then begins anew. It’s a meditative trek, the solid steadiness of shoe soles on smooth concrete as he thought. The bunker is his own labyrinth, a minor pilgrimage in lieu of one more vast, but one that never ceased to draw him closer and clear his thoughts- even if at times, clarity only complicated everything further.
Dean waves a hand, “Look, what’s the harm in him listening? I can do the asking, so just-- unbunch your tighty whities, already. I ain’t fried.”  Sam has that particular twist to his mouth that says he’s mulling over something he wasn’t happy about, but he nods finally. “If anything feels off-”
“On I-80?”
He should tell someone. The Winchesters’ concerning behavior made a little more sense now, after all.
Dean squints, and sure enough, there were neat little tape labels by some of the switches, even though they were all numbered (no doubt by some chart in one a thousand other weird little manuals to this place). He recognizes Sam’s angular scrawl on the labels, marking off the need to know stuff.
“Cas, leave it alone already. You tried for hours, come on, you— here.” He gave a tug, and Castiel found himself sitting perched on the edge of the front bench. “Stay, alright? Do whatever it is you gotta do, but just… stay here, for a little while first. You gotta relax about all this, man. I mean, what’s the harm in a little agora-whatever now and then?” His tone is charmingly cajoling, but it’s the thread of actual want underneath that keeps Castiel’s feet in place. Dean alights onto this fact immediately.
It’s all odd flashes of... moments. Moments he doesn't remember living- and ones he can't possibly have. There’s one that really keeps him up at night, though, the one the images always end and start their loop on...
And hell, twenty minutes...? Dean glances at the wall clock, confirms with his cell, and frowns. He straightens, rubbing the notch between his eyebrows and trying to pay more attention to the other two.
He wades into the water. The burn of it fades as it swallows him up to his thighs. Pale gray fabric swirls around him, already translucent with water, clinging and then billowing out around him as he steps deeper into the pool.
The questions can be tricky, Dean knows, and so at the frown on Castiel’s face he adds, “...Is there any
Tears on his face he grabs you and plunges his lips upon yours.  You kiss back passionately threading your fingers through the hair and clinging to his neck.  You pull him closer to you as he seeks entrance to your mouth, trailing his tongue on your lips.  Together you fall down on to the bed, hands wandering over each other’s bodies.
Just put your hand on the past, I'm here tryin' to pull you through
The best way to describe it was it was like floating on your back in a very large lake, he looked to Sam who stared at him, his eyes wide and he saw the body of Jimmy on the floor. Sam was talking to him but he wasn't answering even though his lips were moving. But they were not his words; they were not even his thoughts.
...Castiel carries a watermelon, has a dance and develops a crush on Dean Winchester.
You are in love.  Every part of every day you think of him, look forward to seeing him and look forward to making love to him.  But there is a storm brewing.  The ship sails closer and close to the New World and you do not know what will happen so both of you live for the moment.
Dean sat down beside Cas, their knees brushing, the hunter sighed watching his breath evaporate in front of his eyes, he look across to the angel, "You know, I do actually have faith," Dean started and Castiel whipped his head to the hunter, "Just not in Jesus," the angel huffed, "or God."
That happiness is ripped away when Sam returns that evening from the arena.
It is while you are on guard in one of the towers on the perimeter of the camp when you see him arrive.  You watch the new arrivals trundle in, wearing their civilian clothes that will be taken from them. Their hair shall be shaved and they will be expected to wear a uniform and an identification number tattooed into their skin.
Dean sighs and sits up, swinging his legs over the and hears the groan from Cas with a wince as he pulls his boxers and jeans on, he cares about Cas and feels sick about he is doing, perhaps he should end it but he knows he can't. He cares about Cas, more than anyone could ever know but he keeps that deep, letting it come to the surface would lead him down a route which would only end in pain.
“I’m Castiel, Castiel Novak, yeah sure,” Castiel replied, leaving his bike, walking back towards the garages.  The pair played for hours, kicking the football against the wall, talking about their favourite footballers (Andy Cole, Ian Rush and Alan Shearer) and their families (Dean also had a little brother called Sammy but only a Dad after his mam died).  They laughed and tackled each other over the ragged football, argued over which better sega or Nintendo and agreed that Empire Strikes back was the best Star Wars film.
Hello, Sorry for the delay in the latest chapter, have had a few health problems the last few weeks but hoping to get a bit more regular now.  Special thanks to Moosetacular on Tumblr for beta reading and battling my obsession with commas.
They managed it somehow, both being in the control seat, it confused Sam when he tried to tall to Dean and all he got was a tilt of his brothers head and though it's brother's voice it's wasn't Dean. Then in the next moment there was a crack of a bottle opener and Dean was there handing him a bottle of beer.
Crowley does not bite, he rolls his eyes and calmly informs Dean that you, he, Sam and Zachariah all belong to him.  And that Crowley can do as he pleases with all of you.  He looks from Dean to you and tells Dean that you are nothing more than a whore before he grabs your wrist and drags you inside.
“Come on Cas!” Dean yelled grabbing Castiel’s head and wrestling it under his shoulder, ruffling his dark fluffy hair that because of puberty was never really doing anything good.  The lads in the group loved WWF and the Undertaker was god and to be honest all the boys spent a lot of their days play fighting and genuinely trying to hurt each other in the most hilarious ways.
He wishes Dean could see this sight.
It is days before the tunnels in the tomb are about to begin to be laid when Pharaoh summons you.  As always you rush, palms sweaty and heartbeat rapidly beating in your chest, threatening to escape through your throat.   His eyes take your breath away as always so you don’t immediately notice that he has dismissed his guards and you are entirely alone.
Naomi calls you telling you your time is over, you must make your choice.  You let go of Dean’s cheek and turn from him when you hear him say Goodbye Cas.  You gasp and immediately turn back to him grabbing his face and place a chaste kiss upon his lips.  He gasps as your break off but you do not look at him you walk to Naomi.
Castiel was surprised by that, watching them grind their hips into each other, “Well aren’t they?”
You wonder if he has all been a test, every time leading you to this moment.  Have Heaven and the Host been trying and trying again to rip you from Dean.  Will they rip you away again?  You look at this Dean, this righteous man.  You recognise parts of all his previous selves in the current one.  Loyalty of the Pharaoh, the passion of the Gladiator and the love of a daughter.  The forgiveness of a husband betrayed and bravery of a man willing to risk everything for what he believed in.
He feels his grace thrum in the empty church, feeling the history of a million prayers that had been said in the hallowed ground.  He lets himself pulsate in the church, feeling lulled into peace.  Would he be able to give up this?
Fury filled Castiel’s veins as he tensed up. he wanted to punch Alastair, but not wanting to embarrass Anna more than she already sounded, he bit back the sound that wanted to escape from his lips.  “I’m sorry you had to see that,” Hester said patronisingly, “Sometimes in this world, you see things you don’t want to see.”
But Castiel also noticed as the more alcohol they drank, the more they touched each other, the soft brush of fingers that lingered when they passed each other a drink or a pool cue.  The way they were back to staring at each other, with Dean smirking just as he had always done and Castiel trying not to smirk back.
Sarah does not look at you with disgust or judgement, she only asks you when you last bled and together you work out that you are three months gone.  You start to cry again then and she holds you gently as you tell her everything that has happened, how far you have fallen.  Sarah tells you that you cannot change the situation; you did what you thought was best at the time and some actions always have consequences whether good or bad.
Cas can feel himself blushing standing as he gazes over Dean and realises that Dean is doing the same thing back to him, Cas has grown into his body, he now feels comfortable with his blue eyes and lean running frame, it has taken a while but he feels confident in his body.  He knows he can attract men and females and isn’t the same naive 19 year old boy he was.  But as always Dean smirks and Castiel feels the usual tug of his own lips that is firmly stopped by him nipping them.
Castiel was in love with Dean, utterly and completely, from the moment Dean had entered him, taking away that last part of innocence, his virginity, he couldn’t have hid anything from the hunter even if he had tried.  Dean had stripped everything away from him.
Castiel loves playing football, but doesn’t want to boast, “Don’t mind it,”
And they yet again it changed all over again and the angel was responsible for it, one night he kissed Dean to distraction, laying him down and worshipping the hunter’s body.  Sucking his neck and collarbone, marking him, playing with the skin in his teeth, toying with his nipples, licking his stomach then blowing hot air from his mouth where he had licked making Dean a quivering mess.
Castiel chuckles, “I needed time to think.”
Castiel looked away so she could not see him roll his eyes, he now really wanted to go after his sister not listen to her prattle on, “You hungry?”
Then the woman Dean danced waved at Max and cut off Castiel’s daydreaming, “Hi Max, aren’t my dance lessons paying off?” she giggled and Castiel glared, she was dressed as a slut, her low cut sequinned dress more suited for cities rather than a holiday park.
“Yes!” Exasperation was turning into anger as Castiel yelled, standing closer to the hunter, “You never see it! Do you? Everything I do for you, to protect you-“
He means to say useful, but he doesn’t get to finish as hefeels,
Loving and leaving them.  Those words haunted Cas as he looked at his phone with all the messages that he and Dean had sent to each other, flirty messages but Dean now wanted to see Cas, he wanted him to come over because it was there in black in white,
You expect him to leave you but he doesn’t.  He stays but ignores you, he won’t leave Samuel and you fear for a moment that he will take him away from you but you realise he wouldn’t do that to Sam, he wouldn’t take him away from his mother.  You live in silence making his meals and you watch him angrily harvest the crops.
Until Dean blurts out, “Why did you never tell me?”
He was given extra chores instead.
"Tell me how you feel," Cas breathes on his lips as he breaks off the kiss, but his lips hang off Dean's "Dean..."
You gingerly sit yourself up and drink some water that has been left by your beside.  You don’t want to disturb Dean so you are quite content to sit and watch him.  Finally he stirs and opens his eyes and blinks when he sees you lazily watching him.
But now you would not think of any other outcome, if you die before him you would feel robbed.  You love him and cannot imagine a day without him.
He hears Castiel drop the towel on the floor and walk to stand behind him and Dean feels his breathing hitch as he feels Castiel's breath on his shoulders, he can feel the warmth from the body behind him and he knows for sure that he isn't going to walk out of that door.
What didn’t help was Dean Winchester was one of the best looking guys in the school, he wore the best trainers, the best tracksuits, his green eyes still sparkled and he was skinny but lean, he had a little bit of muscle, he had floppy curtains like Leonardo DiCaprio and had this smirk that melted the hearts of girls.   Castiel had almost died of jealousy when Dean had dated one of the exchange student girls earlier this term.
“Good good, you know pretty much, working,” he nodded, holding up his beer, “drinking you know, getting by, you on leave?”
You laugh manically and cry out that you do not care for you will be going to a better place.  That any place, whether be eternal hell would be better than serving the Reich.  You would rather be yourself now in your last moments than serve the evil regime that has murdered thousands.
Castiel looked to Dean and Sam. If Jo was knocked up and unmarried she was doomed. Castiel had heard the familiar stories of girls that got pregnant and then abandoned. His stomach fell even further when he looked to Dean, remembering the way he and Jo danced together.
It was starting to get dark when Castiel waved to Dean and rode back, completely happy in the fact he had made a friend, he hadn’t really realised the time or the fact he had ripped his new trousers. His mother had though.
You believe him until the pain of the first incision, you clamp down on Dean’s hand and feel your vision fade to dark, Dean’s voice ringing in your head.  You believe this is what it must be like to die.
But there is a subtle change in the warm early summer sunshine, the girls fill their vest tops a lot more than they did last summer, they are now wearing bras and you can see the straps under the vest tops.  The boys are awkward, last summer they would be rolling on the grass with them but this summer, this summer they don’t want to in case one of them is on their period or something and that sounds gross (a rather too detailed lesson at school left most of them traumatised).
He was a typical soldier with the short cut, nice and tanned from training somewhere hot but the green eyes were still sparkling as they spotted him before a massive smile erupted on his face.  Castiel smiled back politely but he didn’t expect Dean to march over to him to say hello.  He didn’t expect that and he felt his heart throb in his chest.
“Did you know it would end up this way?” Castiel whispers softly, “Did you know that it would end with me doing this?”
“Go back,” Sam said emphatically looking over his shoulder fearfully in case anybody had seen them
"That's almost blasphemous Dean," Castiel grumbled a smile tugging his eyes, "But I get your point."
You collapse to your knees at his feet and beg to be kept by his side.  You have never initiated a touch between you both before, but you do now.  You grab his feet and beg not to be sent from his service.  You apologise for any misdemeanour that may have caused offence and you beg for forgiveness.
Castiel does have friends, but they are far and few between, it didn’t help Castiel got suspended at the beginning of the year for sticking up to the bully who had been making his life hell.  The bully who was twice the size of him and who proceeded to knock him out (Castiel’s new nickname at school was KO- he despised it).  But he did have friends in the music department and those who were like him in music and fashion tastes.  It was these friends that were swapping the blue shirts of their uniforms and getting people to sign them.
Castiel watched Sam’s eyes grow wide with panic, instantly throwing the records down. He marched to the centre of the dance floor and whispered a sentence in Dean’s ear.  Castiel watched as the entire colour Dean had in his face due to dancing most of the night drained away. He apologised to the lady beside and ran from the dance floor with Sam and Castiel quick behind him.
Castiel watched as Jo threw her leg up high being caught on Dean’s shoulder and he felt himself swallow, it looked so exhilarating and he felt a bit of jealousy, if only he could feel so exhilarated and free.  But he didn’t really want to say anything to disagree with Hester; he didn’t want to cause an upset with Kellerman’s granddaughter.
Those orders that sent him to Hell to raise the righteous man.
You are proved wrong.
The court became fun but more reckless place, the king was in love and wanted to make his mistress Queen, a commoner elevated to the throne of England.  It had inspired all ambitious people everywhere.
You look to Dean’s panicked eyes as Crowley drags you, Dean struggling with the guards as he yells out to you, and that is when you realise that you love him. That you would do anything to protect him and right now you have to persuade Crowley that Dean is worth all the trouble he is causing.  That is possibly the greatest gladiator ever.   Because sometimes Crowley believes that if even if they are great, if they have a troublesome personality they are not worth it.  Because a troublesome personality can cause too much chaos and possibly even mutiny and that is dangerous to men like Crowley.
You know you are a woman blessed indeed; you have a home and a man who lets you be how you are, a man who isn’t afraid to love you and make it known.  He holds you hand whenever you go into town and glares at any man who tittles at him.
Castiel would suppose he could hear Sam but his heart was beating in his chest as he felt himself flush under Dean’s stare, why was he feeling so nervous?  Normally he wouldn’t be so intimated, but he found himself, Dean looked at him as if he expected Castiel to say something, “I carried a watermelon…” Castiel offered as if that would explain it all.
Because back of his mind is always Dean, wondering what he is doing.  He hears of him once in a while, how he has been in Afghanistan and Iraq and Cas has to still the worry in his heart and beat himself up saying he has not got a right to worry about Dean as he is not in Dean’s life.
One night alone in car with Dean was all it had taken.  Dean had been seething with resentment; it was naturally going to bubble over.  The hunter could only ever speak with actions, when his emotions ran high he would often say things in anger that he would not have usually said.  That night in the car his temper broke, it broke with both actions and words.
“Friday,” Vivian cooed in reply.
He felt his cheeks burn as Dean shook his hand, “Cas! Hey how have you been?”
You have been overwhelmed by his touch, by his kisses by the way he looks and holds you.  But nothing can prepare you for the way he feels.  You are gentle as you prepare him with fingers and his come.  But even more so when you enter him, you know it will be painful and the brief grimace in Dean’s eyes is just that, a brief grimace.  Soon his face changes into wonder as you gently start to move and he greedily claims your lips.
The crowd whooped loudly as Dean and Jo arrived. Castiel felt his heart beat faster in his chest and watched as Dean grinned, drinking from a bottle of beer before joining Jo at the centre of the dance floor.  Castiel felt envy flare to life in his chest at sight of them, so in sync, and they weren't even moving yet.
Dean glares at you as he gets dragged away and you force it to the back of your mind as Crowley resumes fucking you while muttering how these brothers will be the greatest gladiators he has ever owned, the best in Rome or the very death of him.
Jo turned her tear stained face towards him, mascara marking her face. “Angel? Is that your name? You know what Angel? You don’t know shit about my problems.”
But his eyes, beautiful green eyes that watch you coolly as he marches over to you.  The Saracen that was holding you releases you and you sag slightly, your knees unable to take your full tired weight before you look up fearfully.  Surely this is when you die, but then this beautiful Adonis surprises you by speaking to you in French.
Sam blinked at the admission but could sense the atmosphere around the pair become more volatile, now they were ignoring each other, watching the scene where the shepherds rejoiced the new boy king marching off to Bethlehem.
Cas finishes work early and dawdles up to Ward 24, he sees that it’s visiting time, he finds out which bed Dean is in and walks to it, he pales when he sees Dean lying in the bed sleeping.  His face has been seriously injured and his shoulder and chest are covered in bandages, his arm and left leg are clearly broken.  His face is brushed and there are lacerations above his eyebrow and looks like his cheekbone has been completely smashed.
Castiel has his sign.  It is one of his own making.
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
You cling to him when he is in your uniform and watch him with tears in your eyes as he kisses his golden haired son goodbye and brushes his hand down your cheek.  He promises that he will return and that he will write when he can and that he loves you utterly.   You cry that you love him and watch him as he trudges off into the distance, off to war.  You realise the idyll is over.
You are fucking Crowley, your eyes focused on the shadows cast by oil lamps on the ceiling when you hear the commotion and banging on Crowley’s door.  Crowley swears and stalks over to the door throwing it open.  A guard speaks a couple of words and you flinch when you hear Crowley’s roar.  He throws on a robe and tells you to stay where you are.  You grab a sheet to cover you as the door bangs open and the guards drag the brothers in throwing them on the ground.
But they were never truly together, not in the way that Castiel really wanted, but that feeling was a secret, that was locked away, but the pain of Dean fucking him and leaving him meant that the purity of that first time was being tarnished by the lies, the secrets, the quick blow jobs in dirty bathrooms, the motels miles away from Sam so that the younger Winchester wouldn’t find out.
You are astounded that he is making you feel so many things, such heat, and such desire.  He is hovering over you and you meet his eyes and know that this desire that seems to be melting your bones is not just being felt by you.  He is even gently when he enters you, as if trying to keep himself in check.
Castiel had wordlessly stayed with Sam, Dean and Jo as they had gone back to the shack where they had been dancing,  Dean sending Sam for blankets and brandy.   Castiel watched as Dean wrapped Jo in a blanket, brushing her chin with his hand as Sam poured some brandy. “What do you think you’re doing? If you are ever in trouble you know to come talk to me, right? I’ll take care of it. you should have come to me in the first place.” Dean chastised softly.
“She’s knocked up, Angel,” Sam said replied causing Dean to turn “Sam!” he chastised.
Dean rakes his hands through his hair and gives it a good hard tug, pulling his legs up to sit in the middle of his bed. His jeans are still sticky, and he grimaces. If he
“...I think Sam’s lying to us.”
“I mean, Dean, there’s a lot we just don’t know about this place.”
A single oil-black feather falls to the floor and he stares at it, watches as it flows with the eddies and swirls of the moving current, and disappears into the deep gray of the seam at his feet.
“It’s not the same,” Castiel grits out, eyes on the mattress next to Dean’s head.
“The Grecian oracles. They breathe in the steam of the well, and would create altars, craft their own concoctions of herbs and flora, to help ease the way and channel their predictions. Oleander was a key component to their mixtures.”
This time, when Dean kisses him, he closes his eyes. It’s harder to predict, to sense the way Dean will move next without watching him, but there’s something satisfying in it. In gaining one sense by denying another, skin lighting up along the trail of Dean’s fingers.
Castiel reaches out to touch his arm for emphasis but stops just before he makes contact, a little jerk of aborted movement.
“Wait- wait, just- gimme a minute,” Dean grouses, and Castiel’s thumbs rub gentle circles on his hips in apology as Dean simply breathes.
It’s easier than everything else they’ve been doing lately.
Sam’s all he’s got left in the whole goddamn world.
He wets dry lips, pulling up enough to look Dean in the eye. His thumbs brush Dean’s wrists where he held them. “Stay?” He asks, and Dean’s questioning expression heats, he swallows and looks away and then nods jerkily-- but when Castiel loosens his grip, Dean starts to move anyway. Castiel frowns slightly and presses him back down, “Stay.” He repeats, and Dean abruptly reddens, “Oh you-- yeah, Cas.”
”, and when Dean comes it’s the hardest he’s ever come probably in his life, striping his hand and the tile as he comes to—
“-Just-- hold your horses, huh? Or your dick, just-- jack off for a second or something, alright? Just don’t cross the finish line or anything.”
“Dean,” Castiel warns. One warning- it’s all he has left.
Dean nods slowly, considering the ragged seam. “And now, maybe it’s running up against something hot. A pipe, maybe. Could be what’s causing all this steam…”
Sam is nowhere, Sam is out of bounds- and Castiel. Cas couldn’t find his way out of a paper bag, not that he can remember why right now. Still, he knows that Cas is it. Castiel is the only one who’ll notice he’s gone.
But it’s clear Sam isn’t listening, broad shoulders hunched up. Castiel gives him one last, lingering look before turning to leave.
He bites back another sound pointedly, like a rebuke to himself. It’s hard to think, like the steam’s creeping up in the wet nooks of his brain and fogging up the windshield, but he could swear when he opens his eyes partway that he can see her, kneeling in front of him, dark hair wet silk tumbles over her shoulders as the water slicks down her back.
“Dean— Dean, what are you doing?”
“So what the hell do you want, then? What brand of monster are you?”
It’s hard to imagine warmth feeling great at the very moment--  but healing the way Cas does it, it’s a soft film, one that wells up and burns under his skin until the outside doesn’t, and Cas lets him wave him off when it’s through- even if waving him off just means the angel cedes a few inches to propriety.
“Look, just- describe it to me, all right?”
Then he smirks, leaning back.
Cas is in the lead, nearing the top of the steps when Dean feels that spine-deep ripple of tension in his system that means
Steam wisps up around him, swirling heavy over his skin, making dewy points of his eyelashes where they twitch over blank, unseeing eyes. Future dissipates into memory into present into past, soaks into his eyeballs and his mouth and steeps in his chest. Sweeps out the air in searing lungs. Bands up his heart tight.
But when he sinks down and leans back against it, all he can bring himself to care about is how blessedly cool it feels against his skin.
Castiel straightens, placing the bronze globe back on the shelf before he turns, considering the air.
The garage.
“Oh, I don’t know, Sam, maybe because we’re not from a thousand years ago or Greek or even all that suited for filmy robes?”
He meets his eyes, just for a moment, before a ghostly Sam sits in the same seat Castiel is in. Their forms overlap, and Dean has to look away before his stomach rolls again. Fading or not, the double-vision is getting to him.
“Mhm. Yes, it’s a shame we haven’t had it before. It could be useful.” Castiel straightens, looking down at his glass. He tilts it back in one go, willing it to hit him in whatever angelic organ was in charge of his self-control, talking if only to cover the way he wants to fix his hair, his coat, smooth at his creaseless shirt- “Interesting, isn’t it, the things angels refuse themselves?”
“...I still don’t know.”
him and fuck all this, he
Sam smiles.
He isn’t quite sure where he is.
Hell, he feels energized, clearer than he has in days, like he could go on one of Sam’s daybreak runs- that was its own kinda sick, but.
Dean’s eyes narrow. There’s been something to his energy this whole time, something just a key under fevered. Cas can feel it, too; it’s almost like before, the tension taut between them but without ambrosia to dull the knife-edge of it.
- slip out of his mouth. It was like they had a life of their own, the idle thoughts at the back of his brain stealing the reins and driving straight off the nearest cliff.
Cas is breathing hard in his ear but without a sound otherwise so Dean shows him how it’s done, letting his head fall back with a moan, hips rucking up against Castiel’s as he catches at Castiel’s hips, riding each other and how the fuck hadn’t they done this before?
behind his stupid mortal self) with one hand as he looks down the hall Castiel had barrelled out of, and Castiel can’t see his face but the line of his shoulders is a hard, familiar one. Coiled. Ready.
