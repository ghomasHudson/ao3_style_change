“Yeah, yeah, yeah now that you say it, I heard it too from Sherlock. A buddy he is very close to, a childhood pal. Hey, by any chance is your fellow named Jim? As in James Moriarty?”
Sherlock swallowed audibly, “Are you just flattering me, trying to make me feel good or do you really mean this…. I mean, are you sure I shouldn’t wear a tie and all that?” He touched his long neck and gave John a quizzical stare.
I had eaten a pizza ‘donated’ to me by a neighbour earlier, so I didn’t have soup. Gave it to the cat that lives next door. Damned ungrateful creature kept meowing ferociously all night.
Not that Sherlock didn’t like this place at all. It was the perfect weekend getaway, a summer holiday home or a place where one could come over for a week with friends and have fun without having to bother about neighbors complaining about the noise.
He stared around the bedroom, which was sparsely furnished and had nothing else besides the huge and comfy new king-size bed, the spacious walk-in closet, a chest of drawers and a dressing table. It needed a couch by the window, a couple of night stands, a nice elegant lamp shade on one of them and perhaps a bench sofa at the foot of the bed, maybe even a soft rug on each side of the bed. They’d all happen slowly but surely, for John might have been lacking in time but certainly not in funds. He was an accomplished Lego artist and an art designer, one of those niche skills that not many possessed and even fewer people explored. Working as a partner in Magnussen, Stamford & Watson he had made a million pounds last year and close to eight hundred thousand the previous year. That’s why the spacious, second-floor flat in a Cooper Road Townhouse, a three bedroom three bath abode in reasonably fashionable and expensive neighborhood.
As it eventually tapered off into aftershocks and finally settled into a cozy, deeply satisfying afterglow, John found himself finally soften and the tense contracting muscles around him finally relax. With a soft moan he slipped out, followed by a heartfelt shudder from Sherlock as their connection, now fulfilled, snapped.
“I am, what they call, exploring,” John said, “Left one church whose ways I disagreed with and moved towards one which is better suited to my values and principles. I am on the fringes but not in the core group yet. I can still marry and still get ordained, not have to give up my family.”
Harry shivered in his shoes. John noticed the man was in severe paranoia and his fingers were shaking automatically. “Do you wanna come in for a cup of tea?” He asked sympathetically. “No, no sir, no, I would rather leave as soon as possible. I don’t wanna stay here too long lest I am spotted and then my fate becomes a part of confused and botched police investigation.” He panted for a few moments, trying to catch his breath, “You two must be very careful. Great evil is upon you and the only way you can be safe is if you find love amidst the evil that surrounds us….. you must call out with all the love in your heart. Remember my words, I might not get a chance to say this again so……”
“I am a local here, remember! I can do anything and everything. By the way, I climbed this place because it gives a great visual of the lake and surroundings. You can see for miles, if anyone is in the woods or the rocky terrain, if there’s a boat in the waters or a car on the only road that connects one hill to the other, you can see from up here!”
“All for you, only you,” John said with a flourish of both arms as he ushered Sherlock out of the elevators and into the super-luxury marble foyer. There were mirrors and expensive teakwood paneling, parquet and Italian tile finishing everywhere.
Sherlock looked angry too at first, but then his expression changed to bemused. “Good one,” the genius said, “She was my nanny once. I am twenty-seven now!”
There was no reply he could give Lestrade at that point and thankfully the man didn’t insist on any answers either. But the truth hit home, hard. John later suffered through an agonizing thirty minutes as Sherlock and Mary stepped out of the flat and went downstairs ‘for a walk’. Apparently Sherlock wanted to smoke and Mary wanted to spend time with him. John didn’t get invited to join them so he stayed back, but part of his soul floated after them, straining hard to hear the conversation they were engaged in. Oh to be a fly on the wall and hear whatever was going on, in the lives of the two people he really liked and loved. Yes, he did love Sherlock too, or maybe he loved Mary too, whatever it was he found himself in a strange conundrum, trying to assign feelings and labels and failing miserably.
Sherlock let go and came instantly. He was so on the edge that he was only waiting for that one command from his Jawn to tip over the cliff and fall headlong into the vortex of pleasure. With a loud and keening cry he came, moving back and forth on John’s cock as his own phallus started to spurt out ribbons and ribbons of cum.
John stopped. She had already walked out again. “He is your boss, not mine,” he growled, wishing he could do that on her face. She was being disrespectful. But for now he let it go, since he had bigger shit to handle. Magnussen was calling him and that could mean only one thing, he was going to reprimand him right under Sherlock’s nose.
“No, I am good, it’s fine….” Sherlock went back into the bedroom and heaved a sigh of relief. What a near miss! He was about to finish typing the response to Jim when a thought struck him suddenly. “Wait,” he murmured, “Wait, wait, how did he know the tea had gone cold? Did he taste it after pouring it or did he just touch the exterior of the teapot and……”
Greg grinned sportingly, “That’s a given. I saw him with a group of friends and for the net six years I just kept following him around like a lost puppy, trying to find ways to involve him in a conversation. But there were many who wanted his attention, too many shameless creatures vying for his company and that too, in the most obvious way. We never got the chance to spend some time together and speak.”
“I know you are bored but you might not be in that situation for a lot longer,” he began with an assuring smile, “I never told you,
Thanks to his sudden meetings, both the personal ones with Raymond and the professional ones with his sponsors and reviewers etc, he had been held back in London for four days. He had repeatedly called the house phone but for some reason always got an excuse for John not being able to receive it. The previous day was worse, the line appeared to be wonky and got disconnected repeatedly, leading him to call Mrs. Hudson and Haines on their mobiles. They claimed everything was fine but their tones told him otherwise. Both sounded a bit afraid, evasive even.
As it turned out, Sherlock had got to know that his brother and Moriarty were meeting at a place close by and that would be a gamechanger in many different things, be it Mycroft’s future, the crime scene in the country, Mi6’s role in rehabilitating a notorious criminal and of course the future of a rather unreal relationship, between the chief of intelligence and a genius mastermind who had gone rogue years ago and wanted to return to mainstream. Though he didn’t admit it, it was pretty clear to John that Sherlock’s real reason for being there was Mycroft. He was worried about his brother, though he would never admit that openly.
Sherlock had almost opened his mouth to say it was Santa when one of his cousins tossed a package at him. Sherlock excitedly opened it while his mummy commented that this wasn’t a gift either she or his daddy or his uncles, aunts and grandparents had given. “Could be one of your older cousins. Cecile I think. She often doesn’t write her name on the gift box. Silly girl. She really should.”
John thrust erratically into him, riding out his orgasm, then he buried his face in Sherlock’s neck and sucked a rather colorful bruise on the pale skin there. “Ohhhh,” he went, squirming as he came down from the high, “Oh fuck that was so good baby!”
“Goodness,” Sally looked at Greg, shaking her head in disbelief, “You seem to be in mourning! There’s been plenty of good news for us of late. Last week we solved three homicides, two in London and one in Warwick. But not a hint of joy on your face. Instead you’re stuck on this unsolved bitch of a case and that ungrateful boy who hardly realizes what you feel for him.”
“I think it’s time to turn out the lights anyways, ten thirty already,” John said, feigning tiredness so Sherlock didn’t feel so mortified, “Good night Sherl.”
“And leave me with a paltry sum every month, like some fifteen year old on a strict allowance. He will give me more if I ask, but that’s precisely what he wants me to do, make me ask.”
Sherlock lit a cigarette, one hand still on the wheel of his rundown vehicle. He scowled at Greg, “You worried that I will go back to the estate? I won’t. I am persona non grata there. The security guards, the retainers won’t allow me. You go. I can drive myself back to Baker Street.”
“No worries. So yeah, he is a very wealthy man. What’s best is that his wealth is secure, stable and growing.”
Sherlock was aghast. He had seen flashes of Jim’s temper and had got used to his barbed comments and his obvious lack of patience, snappy tone etc, but this was a bit too much even for Jim. He was quite aghast.
His tone was more curt than he would have liked and her eyes widened slightly at that. But Mrs. Hudson
“Alright hop on. I can’t change the route but after I reach the next village and am on my way back to the depot in town, I will take the right turn and drop you at your doorstep. I promise you that. Come on, get inside now quickly. All my other passengers are eager to go home too so please make it quickly, yeah!?”
Sherlock moaned shamelessly and rasped out, “I need more than just your….fingers this time, please give me your……”
He woke up, feeling a strange sensation. “Jawn?” He called out, realizing the sensation was emptiness, of being alone on a large bed. Then more loudly “JAWN?”
Someone pounced on Mycroft and they began grappling. Greg and the last fellow in Irene’s group were already fist-fighting, their guns on the floor. John pushed Irene, grabbed one of the guns and pointed it straight back at her.
“Beautiful,” Sherlock murmured, “Look at the water, so clean and clear one can see the bottom, almost. The place is perfect, so private and quiet and amazing. It’s shielded on all sides by trees, low hills, boulders. How come no one knows about this place?”
Jim’s eyes glowed with joy and the cloud lifted over his face and aura. “Who’s worried?” He said, grinning and stretching and looking like a new person all over, “What are these things? I am so hungry, why haven’t you got me some food?”
After several years of wonderful experiences and meeting awesome people on AO3, reading fantastic fics and sharing ideas and thoughts, I have recently faced some really annoying comments from some cheapskates. Honestly, none of us like all authors or all genres, sometimes not even all the stories of an author we sort of prefer, but I don't suppose that gives us the right to leave hurtful, insulting comments for them. We don't make any money off this, neither are we aiming for some literary prize. I am aware I am not perfect and neither are my plots. But I am done writing my ass off and posting for other people's entertainment, only to have them come back with snide remarks in the garb of anonymity. I know 90% of you are genuine, good, kind people and it's a pleasure interacting with you but a handful of rotten small minded people have forced me to turn off comments on my stories. I shall reopen them when I feel like. I won't stop posting. Not going to give them power over me.
Molly was a bit mousy looking but she seemed like a nice, pleasant person and smiled broadly at John. He decided he’d like to meet a hundred Mollies every day because she seemed like a non-threat, someone helpful and kind. No wonder she was a popular, well-liked person.
“Of course I know you, right?” John grinned, “You’d need to do a bloody workout in order to get rid of your sullen moods and when you get open stretches to move around you must cover as much of it as you can.” He pointed at the vast landscape before them with both arms, “This place, it has so much natural beauty and open spaces to enjoy and explore. Good suggestion for a holiday Seb, I think I am going to go back from here a completely new man!” Sebastian smiled broadly and tossed his cigarette away, “I think I am going to sleep like a baby now. Having this little chat really helped me John. Come on, I don’t wanna miss our first morning here by sleeping till 10 am or beyond. Must be up by 9 am at least. They don’t serve breakfast here beyond that.”
“You don’t call them animals or dumb,” she chided the salesman, “They have sharper instincts than us. They sensed something wrong.”
Once the butler had left, John pulled Sherlock into his arms and kissed him hard on the lips. Sherlock moaned softly into the kiss and wrapped a leg around John’s hip. Despite the fact that he was taller, somehow John seemed to tower over him due to his authority, age and personality and Sherlock always liked climbing him, being lifted and horsed around in those strong, assuring and able arms. John’s strength was deceptive, as was his masculinity. Neither was toxic, it was just enough to be virile and attractive and had the softened, sensitive edge to it that kept him likeable and affectionate.
Jaw sweeping the floor, eyes like saucers, John watched in stunned silence as a marvel unfolded before his wide eyes. From the bed spread to the curtains, the rug to the color on the wall, the incandescent lighting and even the orchids displayed in vases of various shapes and colors, the room was now clean, airy, fragrant and colorful. It was in fact so vibrant that for a moment John felt like his seven year old self. Whenever he used to walk into his mum’s bedroom he always felt he was entering wonderland.
On one side was a neat row of garages. On the other side was a concierge’s office, plus quarters for him and his family and the security personnel who manned the gate. From one of the windows John could see a middle-aged woman cooking lunch.
“Millionaire,” John corrected Sherlock this time and pulled his hand, getting him into the building where their flat was.
“Not tonight baby,” John stopped him, much to his dismay, “I just want to enjoy the moments, pretty much like you.”
John was stunned into speechlessness. Here he was, out of his mind, anxious and desperate to find out where Sherlock was, and there was Mycroft, totally unconcerned by his tone and voice, his earlier call, and talking about some stupid ear ache……. Or that was what he thought until Mycroft added more to his unusual question. “I just came back home and found Jim writhing in pain. He had a flu which he threw off, but it was a very bad one and the cold was heavy and gave him a severe chest congestion and sinusitis. It seems he always had this ENT problem; heavy colds always turn into an ear infection for him. I…. I can’t…. I have never seen him in pain, can you please help?”
He saw the door was open and heard the sounds of laughter and banter. Okay, at least the whole atmosphere was not charged with animosity. Maybe it would be a little reprimand and nothing more. John smiled uneasily, scratched the back of his head and entered Magnussen’s cabin. Shuffling his feet and eyes on the floor, he walked up to the older man’s desk and cleared his throat. “Hi.”
“See, how quickly we change our tune,” Greg said, “Okay, Bruno, don’t bark. You must not intimidate this man. We are here to help him, not give him a royal scare……”
, then put in a car and driven to some isolated location where he was dropped, right next to his parked car. His gift, like all other times, was placed on the passenger’s seat right next to his own. This time John didn’t even open to check it. Usually they were nice ones, like tickets to a concert and a watch, two day trip to Paris for him and Sherlock, an art that could occupy a pride of position on their mantelpiece etc. Jim had good taste and Sebastian had good information on John’s likes and dislikes, so the gifts were mostly appropriate ones.
Sherlock nodded, still dazed and somewhat worried. What if something was wrong? What if one of his calculations had gone awry? What if something happened to his John? His shaking hands opened the package and there lay a beautiful blue robe and a racy, sexy pair of underwear in see-through material with strategic slits in the right places. One was made of chiffon and the other was leather.
They rolled on the bed in passion, alternating between straddling their lover and lying passively underneath them, their hands following all those places their mouths couldn’t reach and moaning so loud John was sure Mycroft and Greg would have heard them from the garden shed. For a brief moment John’s eyes grew unfocused as he remembered the task at hand and the dagger, oh yeah the dagger, Gosh, he had left that in the car dashboard. “Mmmm, no, don’t go,” Sherlock locked him in atop himself with his long arms and limbs, wrapping his ankles around the small of John’s back. As their cocks touched, John groaned with pleasure and lifted his hips slightly so he could rub it against the exposed opening of his boyfriend’s crack.
“That’s-That’s very good news,” he stammered, “S-Sir, would you consider selling-selling this car back to me? I-I have emotional attachments to it sir and want it back. I had to sell it due to some financial issues but now those are sorted…. They are all sorted. I can pay you more.”
“Nope, not got an offer yet but waiting for one. Even if I do get one, I’ll need this weeks’ time to sort out a few personal responsibilities. I have to move into my new flat and do some spring cleaning there. I can join only from next week, Monday.”
“There, finally we are done,” Sherlock said with evident satisfaction as the courier boy carried off the parcels they had prepared for submissions to one of the three companies they worked for, “We did meet the deadline we had been given for this month. It was a near miss, had you not remembered this morning we owed them the final papers of our research and recommendations we would have defaulted for the first time. Must say it’s good we didn’t get to spend time with them today. While they are good company and…..”
When the elevator took too long to arrive, he loped up the stairs in double quick time and rushed to the door of their flat, fumbling with the keys as he did so. He managed to open it after three attempts. He was hot and hard, his fingers shook, his vision was getting blurry around the edges. God, he felt so hot under the collar right now he felt he could spontaneously
Two weeks had passed. For John his world went from light to dark, from smiles to tears and happiness to misery in the space of an hour. From the comforts and joys of his stay at the hospital to the pits of despair and hopelessness of the place he was in, things had gone downhill in such a swift and inexplicable manner that he was baffled, shocked and devastated by it. He felt like a train wreck every day, bereft of any positivity and hope, just plunged into a bleak world from where the skies were no longer visible.
John took the file with shaking hands and gave Mycroft a small nod of acknowledgment. He also noted that the usually stoic and always in control man looked a bit nervous at that moment. Memories had clearly surfaced and the Mi6 boss managed to look paler than usual, the expression on his face haunted by the past.
Thankfully, Sherlock slept almost instantly. John waited for a further five minutes before he tiptoed to the bathroom, closed and bolted the door, ran the water in the sink and then jerked himself off to one of the best and most explosive orgasms of his life.
John’s heterosexuality was at stake as he felt this unbelievable pull to go towards the man he knew rather than follow the woman who was tugging at his arm. Did it make him gay, bi-curious, straight, crooked, confused, he didn’t care. An urge was an urge, a deadly urge in this case which almost made him shrug off Mary’s arm and rush to the hotel foyer after Sherlock. Fortunately for him, Mary interpreted his skittish and fretful ways to concern over his housemate’s safety and wellbeing. “I knew something was wrong and knocked on the doors of the restrooms where you’d left him,” she explained, “Then I borrowed someone’s outfit, makeup, wig, purse and heels, fishnet stockings and garter belt, then talked him into ‘desperate times require desperate measures’. Snuck him into the ladies’ room and helped him out.”
“One month paid vacation. Two days off every week, mostly Sundays and Mondays. Senior surgeons get the Saturday-Sunday combination but once a month or so even you should get that. But everyone has to be open to attending to emergencies, irrespective of the day. The Hippocratic oath must always be applied.”
Sherlock gave them a curious look, “You mean you want me to take him home with me? Like I did earlier with Malcolm Wardle and then with Mary Finch? Well, I don’t see why not! But something tells me you aren’t quite telling me everything. Is there something else I should also consider before I say a ‘yes’ to this suggestion of yours? Was the man a criminal…. Oops, sorry, he won’t…. he doesn’t remember.”
“It takes people almost a week to just find their way around,” John said. There was no conceit in his voice, just plain facts being stated.
Phil burst out laughing and said, “It was my duty to warn you. Now whatever happens, I just hope he doesn’t break your heart too bad. From what I know, after tonight you’ll be discarded.”
“No problems really,” she flashed a sweet smile, “But as they say…..two grown men living together when both can easily afford separate accommodations, it’s like screaming from rooftops and proclaiming, ‘Hey world,
Greg Lestrade almost lost his patience and exclaimed, “That’s wonderful news. At least he’s gone from there and Sherlock is safe. Now I will find him and get him into an interrogation room, just as I had planned…..” But he was interrupted by his moll who added in a flat, droll tone, “Not so fast sir. He is back now, unfortunately. Sherlock came back yesterday and late in the night he got him back from some place. We are back where we started.”
“Great. I shall see you soon. Don’t call me too often. I’ll text you, from that blocked number so he can never trace it back to me. Goodnight!”
“Ohhhhh,” Sherlock threw his head back and stilled, “Jawwnnnnn!” He shot all his load over his lover, soiling him from the neck to abs and even getting a shot on his shoulder and one of the upper arms. John was still cumming inside him and grabbed his narrow hips, slamming inside. Finally, as they came down from the high, Sherlock giggled happily and asked, “What brought that on?” He didn’t expect an answer, nor did he want one. He just knew he was
“William Sherlock Scott Bouffler,” John went down on one knee, “Gosh, I am doing this naked but then we are both naked… how’s that for common ground huh? So, speaking about common, you are already something like a common law husband for me so why don’t we formalize our relationship and take it to the next level. I want to marry you and make you mine for an entire lifetime. Don’t care if I’m being greedy, I don’t wanna ever let go of you anymore.”
The knee knocking and jittery nerves had lessened; Sherlock looked ready to give John his attention for a while.
She gave him a startled look. The production manager, Manuel, was similarly surprised. Johan lit a cigarette and smirked, “I do have some sources and I have been in this line since 1990. I have seen those days when his father, Alfred Hess Watson was in charge and before him his father, aka John’s grandfather and his grand uncle were in charge. There is a reason why he doesn’t like the spotlight. Many years ago, nearly twenty five years ago I suppose, he was thrust into the spotlight for very unflattering reasons. His father had a scandal, much like his grand uncle used to have and that triggered a series of events in the family. Marriages broke up, lots of talk in the press, people accusing each other, silences needed to be bought, children sent away to high-security boarding schools to keep them away from this mess.”
Later, as they emerged from the house again, Sherlock came to the gate to see them off. “I believe even your pet was not spared,” Greg mentioned. “Excuse me?” Sherlock lowered his brows, “I didn’t understand…. Oh sorry, yes we did lose our pet. Though it was more of Hugh’s pet. You know, he was mum’s secretary. Right now he sort of runs errands, helps with the electrical fittings and plumbing, occasionally sorts out my papers etc. KitKat was his pet. From the army days. Sixteen year old Fox Terrier.”
“Are you kidding me Jimmy? We have stopped doing anything right since they came in and we fell for them so hard we lost our bearings, our controls and everything else we had so carefully preserved. For now, it’s not about being right but about survival. Do you want Seb to love you or hate you when he knows who you really are?”
Sherlock had had a torrid time in the past two weeks, from the moment he had been woken by Haines and told that Stacy had fainted on seeing the blood and Mrs. Finch was possibly dead. Then he had to look at that face, horrors of the night and her last moments visible on it, then had come the invasion of cops, media and forensic experts. The ordeal had been draining on his emotions and he had resisted from informing Mycroft, lest he ruined his brother’s conference and holiday.
“Yes, one of the towns where the rich love to live in, away from the buzz of London but close enough for a daily commute. Only 75 minutes by train to central, less than sixty for the southern and western boroughs. The prices of properties here are way more than most suburbs and we have a few celebrities who own homes here.”
An awkward silence followed as Sherlock stood in silence and so did John, neither man knowing what to do. John had every reason to initiate the next step, which was to touch Sherlock, look into his gorgeous eyes and give him an indication of what was to follow, then close the door gently and give the waiter a subtle hint to leave them in peace for the next two hours. But whenever he tried something stopped him; whether it was his middle class values or his natural inclination towards giving his partner the space and time to be ready for intimacy, but he was simply unable to coerce or even coax Sherlock into doing something. Finally, out of sheer need to say something, he quipped, “There’s champagne and strawberries and some really nice French cheese. Do you want to go to the sitting room?”
“Shut it dude. You don’t thank family for such small things or gestures. Or maybe you have finally realized you hadn’t quite acted as a son and brother for two and half years, hence any small brotherly assistance surprises you!”
the way it had occurred right before his eyes nor could he grasp the implications thereof. John had fallen. The precipice had broken. The accident that he had so dreaded and warned about had
“You’re being slightly dramatic, Mycroft,” John said, though he was slowly able to see the other man’s point of view.
,” Sherlock said with a shrug and a wink, “Just like he keeps an eye on me, I also track him somewhat and I can create a pattern at times. For the past few days, in the guise of keeping an eye on me whilst you were away, he had been dropping by unannounced every day. I knew he will do that again, despite having found nothing unsavory about my behavior or any suspicious moves from my side. Maybe this experience would keep the panda on its tree, where he can hibernate as long as wants.”
And they did! About ten minutes after Sherlock had ignored John’s plea and entered Charles Magnussen’s cabin, Marlene walked into his cabin.
Sherlock sheepishly stated, “Our situation of course….. and-and they’re afraid of me, of us, therefore they are leaving and keeping themselves as safe as they can.”
“Excuse me sir.” It was the same waiter, Ivan. He was giving John a strange look. “Yes?” John asked, wondering if he had tipped too less.
“Phone’s switched off,” he sighed as he sat drinking tea with Mrs. Hudson after returning home from work, “I wanted it to be a surprise. Maybe I should have told him.”
though? It can’t be for a long time, I am sure that might pose other issues for you, like her family objecting or protesting. If it’s only for a few weeks then it’s okay I guess. We can’t just turn her out on the streets.”
Sherlock obediently sat down. “What is this tantrum all about?” John enquired, “You seem pretty hassled.”
The next day John and he went out for a mid-morning Andre Rieu concert and a nice long beer and seafood lunch afterwards. Post lunch they even shopped some and came back loaded with bags in both hands, groceries, new shoes, wine glasses and a sack of Chinese food for dinner.
John was drunk too, if not as piss-drunk as his housemate, and he tipped backwards, losing balance, then landed on the chair Sherlock normally occupied. “That’s MY chair,” Sherlock screeched and tried to shake John out of the seat. Playfulness surging through him, John resisted and soon found Sherlock trying all kinds of things to get him up. He met each move with his own deft move until he found the green-eyed brunette sitting on his lap and refusing to get up. That was when John realized he’d taken things too far, he was hard
“More to come from there,” John said mischievously and headed straight for the bedroom with Sherlock in his arms.
“In the first case you may lose the person after the confession. But if they do forgive you, then happiness is guaranteed and rarely ever fades with time. It’s a gamble son, like most things in life. Why? Do you have something else to talk to me about?”
He looks so bloody fuckable all spread out like that, like a delicious buffet lunch all at my disposal! That was all John thought as he drew on all his knowledge about gay sex and, without even a second thought, went straight for the anal penetration. Someone had told him many gay men didn’t like that and preferred not to, but that source was not a gay man himself so his advice didn’t really count. He would try this with Sherlock, mainly because he wanted to fuck him. He was a quintessential top, so if they didn’t do it this way the only other option was to use mouth or hands. No, one was too experimental and bold for him and the other didn’t seem to be as exciting or arousing.
He stood in the parklands for a good half an hour, making up his mind and reminiscing of the few days he had spent there in bliss, then slowly walked towards the garden gate. After one more sweeping glance around the grounds and a last wistful glance at the house, he left.
“Oh that, I shall tell you right away,” Molly said after she had done a little stroll around the area to understand the landscape and surroundings a bit, “That detour leads you to the Three Villas Lagoon, a nice little residential area by the lakeside. It’s part of the village but cut off from it by that hill and some of these woods. Road slopes down to the lakeside, they say it’s only two minutes to the lake from that area. The rocks on the three sides form a nice little cove that creates the lagoon like effect over there. I think as we move past these woods we can actually see those villas in the distance. The rest of the village is just about another eight hundred meters straight ahead.”
“The client was very happy. Our company got an extended contract. They want to build a Lego world on their property and also want us to construct a swimming pond and surroundings for them. Rich people, the payment will be fifty percent in advance.”
Greg smiled a bit shyly and admitted to the truth. “Yes,” he confirmed, “I am. Even if he doesn’t know and might
There was indeed a God watching over them, or maybe the Guardian Angel He sent to rescue them, but that rescue arrived in the form of a bus that stopped suddenly a few feet from them with a great groaning sound of its engine. It was one of the buses that traveled from the town to the villages up ahead and back, perhaps it was the last one since it was close to midnight now. The door opened with a mechanical sound.
“You know something Seb, I feel we owe a moral responsibility to help this village. After all this village has given us a lot to cherish, enjoy and even take back with us. It’s given us the love of our lives. Now that it’s suffering, don’t you think we need to do our bit as future sons in law of this place? I mean, after we are with our men their families will become our in-laws. If they are attacked then it will affect Jim and Sherlock and in turn affect us as well. We are on holiday, we don’t have a lot to occupy us and this is community service, which we both believe in. In my honest opinion we should help Gregory Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes track this bastard and cleanse the town of this terror.”
“This is beautiful, thank you,” Mary said with a smile as she wore the single strand pearl necklace, “Splendid, see how it matches my earrings.”
“To be honest, no,” Greg replied, “They are at the threshold of their own lives, focused on career, relationships, friends, family, kids. To bring someone home, that too an eighty year old with a past history of mental illness, it is a bit unique.”
For a moment it seemed like he was about to say something but eventually Greg changed his mind and walked out of the room. Sherlock heaved a sigh of relief and was about to go upstairs again when he saw Mrs. Hudson standing in the hallway. “I am sorry son but I did overhear a bit of that, actually all of that. He might have a point you know.”
Suddenly he actually ‘saw’ all that happening. Behind closed eyelids he saw the handsome young sleuth in his naked glory, spread out on the bed, pleasuring himself and making those delicious sounds that went straight to John’s cock.
Sorry. After my medical leave I got back to work and was immediately assaulted by deadlines and buried under tasks. Will try to be more regular with my updates from now on.
“And that’s why I agreed to do this,” Greg added on top of that, “This might not sound complicated and it might not involve celebrities or the Mi5 but the best thing about this case is how layered and puzzling it is. It forces us to think and act.”
“Used to happen in the army all the time, I know about that,” Sebastian said, tilting his head and shrugging his shoulders, “But it never happened
“I’m…. I’m cumming too,” Sherlock panted, clawing at the blanket and straw strands, “I’m cumming too, OH!!!”
When he went out of the room, skipping and hopping and happy as a lark, John found himself smiling as well. He was still smiling when Mary walked into the home office, carrying a file and a couple of other items in her hands.
“We were woken by some uneasiness in the coops and pens and the barking of our dogs that night. But that only lasted for a few minutes so neither of us investigated, thinking some odd fox or a large critter might have got too close and hence the unrest. But the next morning we saw two chickens and a kid goat killed and partially eaten.”
John snorted and looked away, shaking his head. “Bad joke,” he grumbled, not the least bit impressed by the teasing. Henry grinned, “What? Pardon me if you assumed I was pulling your leg because I wasn’t. I was thinking that since it’s been a month from the day the two of you started talking to each other, you must have ended up in bed several times and finally spent a night together. After some real heated activity between the sheets you’d have woken up because of his snoring several times in the night. Now I realize you have probably not even managed to kiss yet. Oh John, John, John, even kids nowadays are faster. You’re dragging your feet back to the Victorian era and one of you isn’t even a Victorian lady in one of those puffy dresses.”
Mycroft shook his head, “I wouldn’t have woken you had it been only a visit for coffee or a glass of wine. I’d simply have come back later. I came here to tell you there’s good news. Remember we have been fighting a case over Plot 23, Block A, Vibgyor Township?”
“Ballroom, billiards room, bar, sitting room, home offices, library and dining room on this floor,” Sherlock explained, “Bedrooms on the first floor. Second floor has my lab, a media room, a parlor which we use for tea or entertain smaller, intimate groups. It has an art and music room too…. What’s the matter?”
She sighed and didn’t say anything but Elizabeth Smallwood, who was also present there, didn’t mince words at all. “A man can never wean himself away completely from his roots,” she spoke without bitterness, there was only sadness in her tone, “For example, you may leave your home but influences of your home and family will never leave you. I must say he was a model son/nephew for us until he retired and started a civilian life. Since then he has been approaching John for cash just as his father used to speak to John’s dad or his grandmother kept pestering Dame Rosalie for financial help. The bad news, there is never an end to their unscrupulous requirements.”
John stepped into the northern section of the mansion, accessible only through an interconnecting door on the first floor, between two hallways, and from the ground floor via a set of stairs/elevator. John of course took the door, which no one else opened without permission. His grandmother’s section of the house was mostly kept segregated and isolated, to ensure the old lady was not disturbed and no interference came from her or towards her.
As soon as they had left, Mycroft put his hand on his head and sat down heavily on a rock next to them. He was clearly shattered by what he had just heard. Greg was also wrecked by the prospect of having to deal with so heartbreaking a situation but managed to remain steady.
John was sure he wanted to reply in words but in reality only a growling sound came out of him and in a flash he was on to Sherlock, attacking his neck and jawline with his teeth before kissing the hell out of him. Hands grabbing his lover’s sides, hips, buttocks and the small of his back, John backed him off into one of the bedrooms, not even noticing which one it was. Everything blurred for John, everything apart from Sherlock’s pleasure-contorted face, his sinfully delicious body and his throaty moans.
“You didn’t quite escape unscathed, just see the splash you got on your nose and around your mouth Jimmy.”
Mycroft was silent for a long moment and John mistook that for a sign of acceptance. He was about to thank Mycroft for his time and tea and take his leave when the elder Holmes sibling spoke.
John sat there, gob-smacked, as Sherlock rolled over, faced the other side and soon fell asleep. The doctor waited, holding the tray, dishes, cups, glasses in his hands, waiting for a response. When twenty minutes had passed and Sherlock seemed deeply asleep, John got up with a sigh and walked out of the room. When did Sherlock start keeping things from him? Here they were, solving mysteries for the world while a huge unsolved mystery existed right here, in their home.
THUMP…… “Ouch,” Sherlock winced and looked around, finding himself on something hard and fluffy. The woodpecker, a.k.a. Elizabeth Smallwood had thrown him off the tree and he had landed on the grass beneath.
‘I thought Mr. Jenkins would benefit from an extra physiotherapy session for his knee, oops, sorry, I had forgotten he has a gastric problem and his knee is perfect.’
There was a lesbian couple in the elevator when they walked in and, after following the last bits of the conversation, one told the other in French ‘I am so glad we don’t have men in our lives, right Clementine?’ To that the response was an equally emphatic ‘You bet’. John understood it, as did Sherlock, and the doctor was enraged to see Sherlock grinning impishly to that.
Strange yelps and soft wails came out of Sherlock as he went through the aftershocks but no matter how long John kept him in his mouth, he kept leaking and remained almost as hard. Finally the good doctor got the hint and let him go with a wet, popping sound. “I love the lusty bitch in you,” he said with the confidence of a truly potent alpha who knew how to go the mile, “Today I intend to feed her!”
“Yeah, it does, and you look really elegant,” John replied, kissing her cheek, “Pearls are always a great look on women.”
He saw the hesitation clearly written on Eckhart’s face and frowned, “You do remember you work for me, don’t you? What is it that you’re hiding? I want to know and you need to tell me now Eckhart, you have to tell me right now.”
He dialed a number and waited for the rings. As soon as a voice answered he asked, “Hey there baby, do you remember if we gave the Hublot to Captain Flash Gordon?”
The papers are now in the bin. Somewhere a tree died so my brother in law could indulge in his whims.
Both of them looked around in panic, not sure what to do. The window had started. The midnight gongs started to go off in the house across the street, the Holmes villa where they had an expensive and grandiose old fashioned clock. “We only have minutes John,” Sebastian said, “We need to act now. Remember what we used to do during the war, if you don’t have the usual then innovate. If you don’t have a weapon convert something into one. We should be doing just that right now……” His eyes fell on the ajar kitchen door ahead on the right side of the grand hall, next to the dining room area and he clutched at John’s sleeve.
“Mr. Holmes thank you so much for your generosity,” Dyson held aloft the hundred and fifty odd pounds Sherlock had thrust into his hands earlier, “Is there any work I need to do today? Kitchen? Bathroom? The upstairs bathroom?”
The blond man anticipated the question his lover wasn’t able to ask aloud. “Yes, I am absolutely sure I want to do this,” John said as he spread his legs and allowed Sherlock the access he had never given to anyone before, “If you want me to spell it out for you then here it is!
“Is that so? Poor nana had no idea she was telling a thief the story of a smaller robber. Yes, Seb’s father and grandmother have been serial beggars but they are family. They have some right over our wealth and are entitled to filial support. You can’t escape blame for your deeds by shifting the blame on to him. He has been cheated on too, your boyfriend, the devious Jim, who used his own sex-appeal and looks to trap Seb just as you trapped…..”
“I like that, a hint of ego and arrogance to a pretty face and charming disposition, like the perfect seasoning on a gourmet dish,” John said with a smug grin, “Good job Greg. As Mary said, please collect your payment and get a bite to eat. I need some time alone with Sher-lock.”
Jim was acting as if he didn’t know Sherlock at all. He was standing closely behind Sebastian, a little shy, a bit reticent to even smile or talk, as if he wasn’t sure of his welcome here. But Sherlock knew that was not true. Jim could enter Buckingham Palace and make himself at home there. This was again one of his games, an act over which the curtain rose or fell according to his whims and fancy. He was in control and manipulative as ever.
“But then,” Sally defended her sister, “John is not a criminal and there’s no reason for us to report to the cops. It’s just some information that would be helpful in his recovery, officer.”
“Oh well….okay. You see, in my family Mike is the dominating factor. My mummy….our mummy, but she loves me more, I am sure…..okay, yes, so mummy is a strong and reasonable woman while daddy happens to be fonder of Mycroft and very supportive of him. Alright, I think I just confused myself.”
“Look cuz,” he began on a very even tone, a calm and steady voice, “I don’t disagree that I have been born privileged. But that’s not a sin. I don’t need to apologize for it or make it up to others for that. It’s like ‘I am Bruce Springsteen or Ed Sheeran, I can sing really well and therefore I have to be extremely apologetic to those who don’t have the gift of a singing voice’. That’s not how the world works and a street smart person like you, someone who has roughed it out as well as seen sophisticated and cultured society, a true all-rounder, should very easily figure out. Also, to be frank, your parents had a chance of building on the wealth they had instead of squandering it. At least that way you’d be millionaires several times over rather than……”
Moments passed and he heard Sebastian this time. Tentatively he turned and saw the six-and-half-foot sniper, face still flushed from his orgasm, standing behind him. Fortunately he was wearing clothes and a huge grin on his face. “Thanks man, he was happy and I am ecstatic!”
John laughed triumphantly as he felt those tight muscles squeeze even tighter around his hand, making him almost lose it for the second time.
She said she was sending us dinner that night through a cousin who was in the area nearby and passed by Baker Street on her way home. In the background I distinctly heard daddy say, ‘Oh Eugenia, where did we go wrong’. I think they messed up the plumbing again.
“So,” she said, putting her hand on his shoulder after taking off her oven mitts, “Do some introspection. Do not rush. Whenever you are ready, you’ll feel it. Yeah, you will.”
Mrs. Hudson was taken aback and looked embarrassed by the reproach. Sally took pity on her and intervened, “I appreciate your sentiments but I think we are digressing,” she said in a firm tone, her look equally stern, “Mrs. Hudson, we need to go and see John and Sherlock right away. All we can tell you at this moment is that Sherlock’s life is in danger and it’s very important for us to keep John away from him, for his own safety and protection. So give us the address and also any other information that might prove to be helpful. Did you notice anything peculiar about John’s behavior of late? Did he ever give the impression of hostility, especially towards Sherlock?”
Seeing no other way, John pulled out, managed to get his trousers back up and lifted Sherlock in his arms like one would carry a child. Despite the difference in their heights he managed it very well and Sherlock wrapped his legs around John, to prevent them from dragging over the ground. It was not an easy carry but John made it to the bed easily and lowered Sherlock on the mattress, putting him on his side.
John was totally taken aback by the statement and the unexpected good news. He had more or less stopped believing that plot could come back to him. After all, the other party had a solid case and some really powerful background claims and information. “This is unbelievable,” he said, shaking Mycroft’s hand, “It’s all thanks to you, of course. So your fee will be double for this one.” He paused as Mycroft took a small bow, “If you can also prepare some transfer papers please. This plot will be a gift from me to someone, who’s probably brought me a bucketload of good luck and happiness over the past ten odd days.”
John had gone up ahead into the woods and was looking at something in there. Or rather, he was searching for something or someone in the woods. When he felt Sebastian’s hand on his shoulder he jumped and got a real start. “Gosh, don’t do that man,” he said panting, putting his hand on his throat, “Jesus Christ! My heart jumped all the way into my mouth, almost. Are we starting already?” He looked at the Lexus and the three ladies bundling into it in a hurry.
John was hardly convinced of what the other man was saying. He was just relaying and narrating his own thoughts, right? If it was a matter of mere opinion then Seb could be wrong too. How could someone just
Sherlock bit into a sausage and picked up the apple juice, “Nope. The only thing we should be wary of is staying behind our potential.”
“Sherlock has already attempted suicide, twice. Unsuccessfully. I don’t want him to be third time successful.”
The very next moment he heard his father enquiring, “Hey, has anyone seen the bottle of Finnish vodka I had brought? It was yet to be opened. The whole bottle has
With a deep breath he raised his plastered foot and kept it on an ottoman and settled into a more comfy position on the chair. Then he allowed his head to loll on one side and closed his eyes. He was not tired but staying awake didn’t motivate him anymore. He wanted to pass out.
“No, no, no, no, not at all,” John shook his head hard, “Absolutely not. Sherlock, I don’t think I can explain things succinctly at this point. I need some time to sort things out in my head. But yeah, I agree and admit my behavior has been weird and I shouldn’t put you in an uncomfortable position.”
Sherlock saw that and interpreted it. John wanted something more. Goodness gracious even he did. Their dreams were synchronizing together, their today was merging, their tomorrow was getting accumulated in a single beautiful thread. His heart was warm with the glow of love.
“Good,” Lestrade seemed happy, “You learn fast, respect the process of booking a prior appointment and don’t waste time in unnecessary chitchat. I like that. Every busy man in this world needs to respect the other person’s schedule. That way we are all taken care of. In this world and society we must all be givers. Then everyone gets what they want. Otherwise, with takers all around, you begin to feel drained and used and it just gets so difficult to….. did you understand what I said?”
“Jim I am not….” Sherlock tried to protest but something happened right then that told the green-eyed man that his relationship and association with Jim was a far more dangerous and risky proposition than he had otherwise assumed. Out of the blue appeared Sebastian. The otherwise charming handsome hunk appeared very menacing with his imposing height and bulging muscles as he pulled a chair and joined them at their table.
“Yes you are,” Sherlock sighed, “I was hoping you’d let me know if I can do something to loosen things up a bit, from my side. I don’t want him to think I am a tight-arse, stiff, socially incompetent fool.”
Sherlock was left shocked and befuddled. How come John was in that dreadful place? Why did Mike send him away even after Sherlock had assured him he would bear the expenses? He looked at Ben and said, “You did your best BB. I don’t mind the lack of results because you were stopped from doing your best. It’s fine, give me the gifts and letters please, let me take them to him this time. I shall take these into that center myself today, and I dare anyone to try and stop me legally from meeting my dear friend.”
“Not to mention if one of our retainers suffer then the authorities will make our parents suffer with all their interrogations and intrusion.”
As the holidaying group settles in, Jim and Sherlock are anxious about the future. In the meantime, Irene and Molly get a nocturnal visitor.
Sherlock blinked, “Of all things, this is the most unbelievable. And Greg, you knew all along? Did Mycroft know as well.”
The milk and cookies had been laid out. The midnight hour was near. The stockings had been hung up. Now all that was needed was the old man…..
“He didn’t buy any of these, did he?” Eugenia asked, looking pointedly at John. Reginald immediately stopped her, “It doesn’t matter who bought it. They are one unit and the gift is from both of them.”
“True! Do you want me to speak to the security guards and keep him off our premises? I mean that gentleman who came to see you, Jimmy Moriarty.”
“Rubbish,” John tipped the bridge of Sherlock’s nose, “We are one unit now. So those gifts are from both of us. There is no John without Sherlock now.”
Sherlock suddenly giggled and John climbed over him, immobilizing him with a swift movement. He held down his lover and gave him a mock-angry look.
. “Hold it you two, you mean to say you’re Sherlock’s brother, the same one who heads the Mi6?” He sneered at the tall man before turning towards the woman, “So should I suppose you’re the wife? But then no, you just called him boss, so you’re an Mi6 operative as well. You work for him. From your high heels, long and polished nails and makeup it appears you too do a desk job and not slog around on the dangerous missions.”
Earlier Mary was the girlfriend he desired and occasionally slept with and Sherlock was the dear friend. Now he felt Mary was the dear friend and……
Sherlock gasped as he walked closer to the bed, tentative footsteps that didn’t falter but stayed on the cautious side. “You-You knew that I was about to come and see…. visit you today?” He asked, unsure of what John meant by that surprising opening statement.
“They did Sherlock. I tried to ask but you know not everyone talks to me properly. I went to the polices station two times, once in the first week and the second time three days ago. They call me a freak and all that. So I didn’t ask after that. I decided not to go there either.”
“You bet,” Sherlock grinned, looking her in the eye, “You seem very happy Mary! I hope there is some good news you wanna share, along with whatever you are thanking me for!”
Sherlock nodded, “Hmmm, but I still think his disappearance might be related to something else.” Eva waggled her brows, “Oh possibly! Now, are you and your hubby free this Saturday noon. Vic and I wanted to take you out for lunch!”
John had been given an old laptop to use and he was listening to music on that. The disappointment registered on his face instantly. But he quickly pushed it away and offered Sherlock a brilliant smile. “I’ll manage.”
He sat down on the armchair with a thump and put his sack down with a bigger thump next to him. Cringing at the milk and cookies he sighed, “Or maybe this doesn’t take too long to be prepared on a busy night. Never trust those grownups, they have learned to lie.”
“I have heard that before, several times, now shall we discuss the job opportunity please?” Sherlock asked, sipping the tea but only after he had sniffed, checked under the cup and turned the rim round and round and blown on the surface. Greg suppressed a grin and said, “Well, it is a contract for six months minimum and up to a year at the most. You will be paid a hundred grand upfront, thirty grand per month and a bumper bonus of half a million if you finish in six months. In case you finish in a year you will still be paid the same sum, a total of one million by the end of the contract. Of course if the employer is happy he may reward you, a brand new car, some extra cash, an all-expenses paid trip somewhere etc.”
“As a matter of fact we do. This ill-fated gentleman, Harry…. Yes, that was his name, he came to see us the same day he died. He was trying to warn us, told us we are in danger and if in doubt, to turn to someone called Marvin Von Dyke for help. We were hoping you’d help us find him.”
Martha Louise Hudson was nearing sixty but had the ebullience and energy of a woman thirty years younger. She had once been a beauty but years of living tough and surviving situations had eroded her looks and given her a harder edge, both in terms of appearance and behavior. While she was sweet and wise and helpful, John could spot the tough bird underneath and knew she was not to be messed with.
“Absolutely,” Mike said and left him alone. Sherlock didn’t want to tell him the real reason he wasn’t signing the documents. He didn’t want anything monetary from John, not until he had solved the Jim problem and clarified everything.
She looked at him imploringly, “But we don’t know that for sure, do we? In any case, if we are to keep you happy we compromise Sherlock. All the odds and risks are on him,
Noel and Nathan looked at each other and after a subtle gesture of a ‘go ahead’ from one, the other, Nathan Barrow, made a strange revelation.
John also felt delighted, not just because he was able to help Sherlock but also because his faith on the man’s abilities was justified. Even if bruised and battered, Sherlock remained Sherlock.
John had to stop him at that point. “Mycroft, I hate to burst your bubble but I am not a gay man,” he admitted honestly, “I date
“Yeah you bet they do. They like to talk about it in details. What surprised me was how much they seemed to believe in it. Mrs. Hudson actually shut the other two up or they would have gone on and one and on.”
John had, on purpose, kept Mary away from Sherlock and hadn’t even mentioned her during any of his conversations with his housemate
“Very well, I am leaving early morning tomorrow for the conference in Geneva. I’ll be back in three weeks, so be good, stay safe and stay in touch. Okay?”
Greg looked at a number on his phone, debating whether or not he should call there. After a grand total of thirty seconds his thumb automatically hit the ‘call’ button. The phone rang only thrice before it was answered. A smooth and polished voice answered him, “Hello. You are back already? Can we do dinner tonight then?”
Both men began to chuckle. Then Victor said, “How did you find out his name and what he does? You haven’t spoken to him at all, right?”
John felt annoyed at himself. I need to stop talking about him constantly. “Because you always ask me to describe the cases, his name pops up,” he said in a disgruntled manner, “It’s not like I deliberately mention his name while we are on a date.”
He came running to the gate so he could stop the departing man but by then John had disappeared in the misty morning. There were no signs of him. It was Ben Bickerton - Sherlock’s ‘eyes’ and ‘ears’ around the estate. The man stared at the lonely road ahead, puzzled, and distressed. His autism played up and he was left angry and upset, bereft of words. So instead of calling Sherlock he simply went to his room and shut the door, muttering under his breath.
Sebastian’s eyes grew huge as he saw his lover’s form shift on the bed and then ‘expand’ fluidly, as if someone was stretching his form. He knew he should move, he should switch on the light, he should send out the signal for Mycroft and Greg to get into the house but his hands and senses were both frozen into space and time.
“I don’t suppose I am that disgusting but I understand your reservations. Try Belinda. What? No? You need a guy! Okay, try my secretary Pierre.”
John thought for a few moments and responded, trying not to sound too holier-than-thou and yet getting his point across as politely as possible. “If I earn an income from a job as a doctor, I am still entitled to the pension I receive sir, which is legal and perfectly valid. But if I also get disability cheques, won’t I be double-dipping into the public purse? I don’t mean to say this isn’t legal or I am breaking the law, because you wouldn’t allow that to happen in your watch, but does it still seem fair…..just putting my two cents on the table.” He stopped and looked a bit hesitantly into the other man’s eyes.
“We do have to take some action Myc,” Greg said, “We need to ensure this is not repeated. If others find out about them they will create a big hue and cry and then we will be FORCED to act. Do you want that?”
When Greg came back to his loft apartment that evening, a day in advance because his work had got over quicker than he thought, he was surprised to find Pierre still there. The man had been fired earlier that week. “What’s the matter?” He asked politely but sternly, “Didn’t you find suitable accommodation at a hotel?”
. With a big grin he turned to talk to Sherlock when he realized it was John who had just sat in his car. Grinning like a crook, John pointed at the wheel and said, “Drive!”
“Um….Sherl, I have some presents for you too,” John said, “Since we’ll start early tomorrow for your mummy and daddy’s house, I thought maybe we could open those gifts a day early.”
. That was precisely what a scorpion like Phil had banked upon and that’s how he had managed to bribe a greedy waiter and asked him to do the honors, spilling some on Sherlock so John got a chance to take the next step. That would mean Sherlock would definitely misunderstand John.
John almost groaned with frustration and disappointment. What the fuck! How was this even possible? It was the same oaf Andersen and he was waving his arms wildly at Sherlock from the service lane. “Hey come on, I have my car today.”
Suddenly he saw himself outside the ICU of a hospital. A doctor, whose face he couldn’t see, was saying, “I am very sorry but your mum is not going to make it. She is sinking. I had told you last year she was not to be exposed to any shocks and strong emotions, nothing that should affect her and in her fragile condition…..”
By and by Sherlock discovered a new Belstaff coat in medium ash-grey, a big jar of the product he used on his hairs to settle and style his curls, a Hugo Boss cologne, a book on the lives of famous violinists and finally…..the Black Pearl ship from the Pirates of the Caribbean series.
John peered into the other man’s bedroom, whispering out the name. He called out a second time, eyes trying to adjust to the darkness. There was no response, not even a grunt. The dark lump under the covers shifted slightly and he could hear the man breathing. Sherlock was awake but not responding to him.
There were only two slices of toast left so I put them in the toaster. Then I decided on microwave pancakes. This time I set the oven to the correct timings and temperature. Then I set about scrambling eggs and frying some bacon. Seemed simple enough till I realized one can only save one thing at a time and not the entire world. The smell of burning toast distracted me and I forgot the eggs and bacon, then as I was trying to resuscitate the toasts the frying pan caught fire and the bacon and eggs were gone. I tried to handle the situation but only managed to slip and slide on the gooey contents of a cracked egg on the floor (no idea how it ended up there) and my palm landed on a side of the hot pan.
Apparently, there were many things wrong in that sentence which John didn’t hesitate to point out. One – We were not in a mere ‘relationship’. We are married and therefore I should have used the word ‘marriage’ instead of relationship. Apparently, I undermined our marriage by omitting the word ‘married partner’ in that sentence. Two – I am supposedly a man with a Boomer mindset. In today’s world people are simply partners and gender divides should not be quoted in terms of duties and responsibilities. So a wife can earn and a husband can cook, a wife can take the car for servicing and a man can buy eggs and milk from a grocery store. Three – The implied meaning in my sentence made John feel less of a man and he had high objections to that.
Dizzy with the orgasm that he’d just gone through, John still answered Sherlock. He stumbled off him and pulled down the garter belt with his teeth, giving Sherlock a show of his ‘alpha’ status, then tore off the stockings and exposed his frilly, lacy, saucy underwear. One tug and it ripped into two, the delicate little thing that it was, and Sherlock’s rock hard erection bobbed free instantly.
“You seem to be in a blue mood Sherlock,” John observed as he rowed the boat with Sherlock taking a break from the same activity. They were going to the Vulcan Isle, which was one of the three islets in the midst of the lake, each one not bigger than the size of a football stadium or the size of a small auditorium. Sometimes people went there, sat on the benches and hammocks built under the trees that dotted those islets and had a picnic or barbeque. The sandy banks of the lake were also popular for people who wanted to sunbathe or take a dip.
As he walked off towards an agitated Irene, Jim grinned at him and nodded, “Yes it was me Sherlylocks. I have more or less given up my former profession but sometimes I do tend to help out a man or woman in need. So, I am guilty as charged. Even today I can’t resist the odd letter to James Isaac Moriarty, aka the spider, especially a letter that ends with ‘Please Jim can you fix that for me?’.”
Sherlock was quite shocked with himself that he didn’t think so despite John’s rambling and forward statements, the incessant questioning and persuasion, the somewhat incorrigible insistence that Sherlock keeps sitting and chatting with him despite two hours having passed. He was also beginning to find the other man charming and interesting, dorky at some point but still so utterly adorable and honest. There were no airs about John at all, he was a genuine and authentic human being with a heart and courage to wear it on his sleeve. Despite his intentions to conclude things and never see this man again, Sherlock found himself suggesting they should meet again someday soon.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Do I have to say it aloud? Alright then, I shall say it aloud. I’d really be disappointed if you asked me to go and not…. Use those things you kept on the nightstand. Just don’t use the blindfold, I am not ready for that yet.”
Sherlock rubbed his nose and she laughed. “What?” He blinked. “You always did that whenever you couldn’t say what you really wanted to say,” she said, “Oh by the way, your daddy and I are trying to push your elder brother to set a date. I wouldn’t be surprised if you beat him to it.”
“Shit, what must you think of me right now…..” he muttered, pulling at his own hairs in absolute and utter anguish.
“It wasn’t just about the hundred and fifty million or the five million,” John’s disgust turned towards his own self, his annoyance now self-directed, “It’s about how I trusted you blindly and allowed you to dupe me. Once again, I lost to someone I trusted and loved.”
“Why would they go?” Sherlock objected before either of the two men could answer, “You haven’t seen anything or noticed any unusual stuff, have you Jawn? What about you Seb? What would you do? Stay here or leave for town?”
. The other man hadn’t noticed John either and had his back turned towards John the entire time. “Oh, sorry,” Sherlock said apologetically, “John please meet Phillip Andersen. Phil heads our sales team at the college. Thanks to him we have so many sponsors and collaborators. His team also designs all the student packages.”
“Jimmy,” Sherlock had only just noticed that his ex was, somewhat inexplicably, in the thick of things and trying to help him. He glanced at Jim in respect and affection but also confusion, asking, “Thank you for your help, I really am grateful. It also seems that you know Jawn. But….. What brought you guys here suddenly, how did you even know we were here?”
“To be honest, I like Sherlock and if he’s happy we are happy. He’s a good man and he deserves an achiever. Someone he can be very proud of. A prince of a guy must at least be with a Knight of the Order, isn’t it?”
“I knew about that already mummy,” he said to his mother with a wistful smile, “They were very cunning, both of them and left no breadcrumbs behind. Neither the cops nor Mycroft can do anything to bring them back or incriminate them for their crimes. The necklace was sold by a third party, not them. The money was withdrawn to a joint account between me and Jim and there’s no proof he took it all out and it was not me.”
“That’s true,” Mycroft said in John’s direction, “He did tell me that he was bringing a guest, that he
“So,” Greg Lestrade said, “In effect you have nothing to offer on either of the two men. Can you at least tell us who did this and used your assets right under your nose without you knowing it.”
Sherlock rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands and hung his head, trying not to show the despondency he felt. But those wise and experienced eyes, even with their fading eyesight, managed to notice the look on his face. “John is a simple man at heart Sherlock,” she continued, “He loves gestures, he loves loyalty, he wants someone he can trust with both his eyes closed. Sadly, it’s easy to get handsome, rich, famous, powerful and successful people these days, but not good souls.”
When Phil Andersen reached the hotel and found the waiter, Jerry, waiting for him in the foyer and showing him the thumbs up sign, he was sure the battle had been won. He had successfully broken up John and Sherlock’s fledgling relationship and now he’d step into the scene like a knight in shining armor and whisk off his Sherlock into the sunset.
John was about to open his mouth and just yell at his housemate, frustrations getting the better of him, when Jim sang out the following words.
Sherlock was about to open his mouth and argue but he decided against it. He knew just how much John hated it when he didn’t consider their combined wealth, or the money John had bequeathed to him, as his own. “You are right,” he said with a knowing smile, “It’s my money too. But you know what I mean…. I was talking about something that I have worked for and earned on my own.”
Seconds later John had mounted him like a wolf and was deep-screwing him as Sherlock cried, screamed and babbled with sheer pleasure, hardly able to keep himself upright with the relentless onslaught he had been subjected to. He was aroused again, his cock was aching for a touch but he could barely move in this situation. If he got even one of his hands freed he would topple over and hit the mattress face first.
Jim looked so taken aback and speechless, for a change, that Sherlock grinned with satisfaction. It felt so good to give it back to the man, finally. But he had no idea he was unleashing a brute, someone who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. “I see that fucking the reclusive bore who lives in this mansion, the one with more money than sense, has given the little boy a sense of entitlement and bravado, huh?”
at a nice restaurant that served French cuisine, Sherlock barely managed to grasp the message and hurriedly said a ‘Yes of course, text the name of the restaurant’ and hung up. John had a client commitment that morning so they hadn’t met. John’s car was with Sherlock, so he knew sooner or later the man would meet him and take the car keys.
“Oh cut out the ‘titular’ addresses and salutations. They just create a wall between people. You can call me Rose or… nah call me gran. Many people do. Only John and Sebastian call me nana.”
“Fine, fine, no need to boast,” Mycroft checked his watch, “I suppose you’re here because you’re hungry and need to eat something, eh?” When Sherlock nodded the elder sibling acted like a total bully and snapped, “Well then, you’re old enough to sleep in until eleven in the morning then I suppose you’re also old enough to make your own breakfast. Petunia is away today and I am not cooking anything for you.”
“Bastards,” John grinned from ear to ear, “They seem to have become richer and more ostentatious. The loveable adorable bastards. My friends!” He ran across the street and thrust his hand out to shake hands with them but the two delighted men pulled him into a group hug. “Guys-Guys-Guys it’s so good to see you both,” he exclaimed, feeling genuinely happy to see his mates doing exceedingly well, “I heard about the takeover of two more banks and about two whizkid bankers who had taken internet banking and investment banking by storm! I am so happy for you both. By the way, how did you know I am going to be released today? I didn’t inform anyone at all.”
As he walked out of the cell for the last time, his cell mate sighed and shook his head. “Spirits and souls are like molds of clay. They can get de-shaped but with the right sprinkle of emotions and kindness they can be reformed and reinstated. Good luck to you John, dear boy.”
“I think you should all go home now,” Reginald Holmes suddenly stood up and announced, “We shall reconvene in the morning, if necessary, after we observe the boys’ health. They aren’t kids after all. I think it’s nothing that a good night’s sleep can’t cure. Sherlock had been a somnambulist as a child, If he is very tired or disturbed it could recur, Thank God Mikey was there! Greg, go home son. You had a hard day as well.”
“Because this is mine,” John said as he started to take off his clothes, “Now it’s ours, of course. Fancy a dip?”
“I can’t even if I wanna…..” Sebastian rasped out between thrusts, feeling his controls slip and his strength on the verge of spending itself, “Fuck Jimmy, gonna cum right nowwww!”
John looked here and there, thought of all possible solutions and ways out of this embarrassing situation, then decided to take the help of the lobby manager. He sort of knew the man because Larry, as the man was called, was also a resident of Baker Street. They sometimes met at the Launderette or the confectionary shop. “Listen, I need a pair of trousers….for a six foot man, slender build, waist about size 32.”
“The Kawasaki Ranger?” John said, “I bought that too. But a car is also necessary, you see! Weekends we’ll use the motorcycle. Weekdays and rainy days are for the car.”
“So,” he said, shame filling him now that he realized he had spoken too much, “You must be thinking I am quite the confused weirdo, right?”
Sherlock squirmed with unease and shock. He was not used to being flirted with so openly, that too at a place where his John worked. “I… um, I’m sorry, I have to go now. This is my floor.”
Another car came by and screeched to a halt a few meters ahead. Then it reversed and Greg, recognizing the swanky Mercedes S class, quickly stepped forward to greet the person behind the wheel. Sherlock remained behind next to his own car, leaning against it and puffing away.
“Please Mr. Bouffler, if you are in trouble or he is bothering you then you have to tell me. Maybe I can help in some way. At least I can give you some background. Not just about this man but also about the other man, Colonel Moran, our employer’s cousin and family.”
John looked at Sherlock. For the first time since the night before, Sherlock actually looked into his eyes. He had been subtly avoiding John all the while, even during the two hour ride to the Holmes family’s stately countryside home. “It’s ‘our James’ now?” The detective muttered.
“The seafood here is awesome, where do they get such fresh catch?” Sebastian commented as the group sat eating a scrumptious lunch on a Wednesday noon at Beckett Town. This was hosted by him and John for their new beaus and their gal pals who had been feeling neglected and had recently faced some unsavory moments in the village.
“John, we all make mistakes in life, take wrong decisions. That’s not a sin. None of them are. But they do become cardinal sins if you hold on to them and keep making a chain of repeated mistakes. What you just told me is tragic, sad, should have never happened that way, but it’s not something that doesn’t happen to people. What’s important is whether it makes you a better man or a bitter man.”
“He was saying I need to pay him to have sex with him. You heard the last bits, ‘you shall pay for this’. Yeah.”
During this time the retainers worked their magic and when John stepped back out, the fluffy towel around his hips nearly dropped as he jumped in astonishment. He breathed in a cold but fresh air and took a good look around the room, admiring the quick fix from Sherlock. “Sherl…. Why this is so…. I feel like I am alive again. What as I living in all this while?”
“It’s beautiful. Both rings look grand and gorgeous. I hope they like them and also accept our proposal. Honestly speaking, it’s them who are holding us together in this difficult hour.”
Mycroft held his head in his hands, “Dad, I don’t believe this! You didn’t report it. You just let it go, thought you could get away with it by hiding it for a lifetime?” He gave both his father and Jeremy a disappointed glance and murmured, “If there is another such creature out there then it doubles our problems, do you realize that?”
She smiled without any contempt or judgement and shook her head, “No, you are not John. And even if you’re confused or feel a bit weirded out by yourself right now rest assured many of us have been in your place. What I hear from you is an irresistible attraction between two men, one of who claims to be married to his career and asexual, the other likes to scream from rooftops that he is NOT gay. Well, let me tell you sometimes we are all gay for certain people. It’s a natural instinct, to be attracted to someone who is good looking and charming with a larger than life persona and the sort of brilliance Sherlock carries on each leg is hard not to get impressed by.”
The couple at the next table grinned. “Guess even Holmes and Watson have their silly quarrels, don’t they?”
Mrs. Hudson met them briefly as they came back to the house around 4-30 pm. While they were walking in through the front door, she was coming down the stairwell with their overflowing laundry bag. Good old woman always repeated ‘I am not your housekeeper’ and yet did all the duties of one. They wished her good afternoon and she even made a comment like ‘It seems you guys renewed some vows lately, you both look different.’ Sherlock obviously ignored her and walked upstairs while John offered a polite smile, shared a word or two and thanked her for the laundry.
John went and stood there and Sherlock quickly took the pic. But instead of walked back over to safety, John took out his camera phone and said, “Hey, I simply love the way the skies and those tree tops look and, with you in the foreground, I am pretty sure this will be our second best pic, if not the very b……”
“I dunno really Jim-Jim,” Sherlock kissed the other man’s forehead and inhaled his scent deeply. Vanilla, cinnamon, passionflower, mix of honey and maple! Fruity, fresh, masculine! He had missed this! “He doesn’t seem like an oddball to me,” he continued, stroking the raven dark tresses, “Yes, he has some issues from the past but then so do we all, don’t we? Sometimes we are able to rise above all those issues and be normal people, sometimes we can’t be so. He has his good and bad days but never did I see anything totally strange about him, let alone dangerous. He’s treated me like a real friend and companion, not as an employee or a bridegroom for hire. I was, honestly, expecting a lot worse when I went into this arrangement.”
As the huge antique grandfather clock began to chime downstairs, indicating it was 12 am, Sherlock finally gave up on the book and put it aside. He turned out the light and pulled the sheets over his head.
It was a bit dark that evening, despite the approaching summer. The sun was hardly visible and due to the shade of the trees, her yard was fairly dark already. About twenty feet ahead was the bank of the river and perhaps because of the possibility of rain, no kids were canoeing nor was any boat to be seen from her kitchen window.
Sherlock suppressed a grin and said, “I’ll ask Daphne to get some for you or maybe one of the retainers. Oh by the way, here are the gifts for those two, this one is for Jawn and that one is for Sebastian. I had ordered them at ‘Frances’ and your sister picked them for us last evening on her way back home. Thanks to her non-intrusive nature, didn’t even ask me who they were for. Or maybe she thought we had bought them for each other!” Jim looked thrilled and took the package offered, opening it before he remembered he was not supposed to do so. “You are sure it’s the same thing I asked for?” He asked, “You didn’t go there yourself, you placed a mail order, right?”
There was a cottage opposite to their property, occupied by a lady named Mrs. Martha Louise Hudson. There was also an Edwardian style detached home right next to the lake behind their manor, where a family lived. It was a local doctor named Mike Stamford, his wife and two kids.
. I only happen to live under the same roof with Sherlock because we can’t afford the high rent. Also, one of our common friends got us together, I mean introduced us, and we thought we can sort of tolerate each other….there’s enough space in that flat and….that’s how it happened.”
The moment of ecstasy came only a little later, their long unheeded needs coming to a boiling point in a matter of seconds. They trembled with a much awaited and thunderous release, coating each other’s hands with thick cum as their mouths joining back together again.
“Yes,” Sebastian stated confidently, “We won’t be involved in any wrongdoings. But we do wanna help them, if it’s still possible.”
Jim grabbed his friend by his arms and shook him hard, “Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, don’t do this, don’t panic, don’t be impulsive now,” his rebuke worked and Sherlock became more alert and coherent after that momentary disorientation, “It’s me who’s impulsive, you are the deliberator. Stay that way please now, okay? Look into my eyes, we have got really wonderful men in our lives now and we are NOT going to let go of them nor let any harm come their way. How bad can it be huh? We only need to be careful for about 2-3 weeks in a year and we shall manage. Yeah we will manage it somehow, don’t you dare give up before we have even started to enjoy the best phase of our lives.”
The squeaky voice was Jim’s and Sherlock saw him as a deceptively lovely and cute rabbit but the moment he tried to grab the apple the rabbit ran away. Sherlock chased after it and almost fell into a rabbit hole when someone grabbed him and pulled him back, sending him reeling backwards so he landed on his arse on the grassy lawn.
Sherlock felt a shift in the air between them. John was opening up. Physical intimacy had already been established, now he was getting emotionally drawn towards Sherlock. “Well, thanks to your good karma you were born in a family with mega riches.”
Sherlock realized, with a sudden unraveling of facts in his brain, that he was not so concerned about Jim’s demands and expectations anymore, as he was worried about John’s mental health and overall wellbeing. The man had borne the brunt of many ill-events in his life and didn’t need one more blow. His throat had gone so dry he had to drink a tall glass of water to moisten it. He was so distracted that he spilled the last of the water and almost fell on the bed while trying to get into his track pants. Suddenly a strong hand grabbed him and steadied him. John’s caressing, kind and affectionate voice came into his ears. “Relax. Whoever it is, can’t be a cop with handcuffs ready. And yes, you are allowed to have a visitor or two if you so wish. Nothing to worry about.”
Their lead was thirty seven year old Gregory Stratham Lestrade, a Superintendent by grade (a level higher than a senior inspector) but an investigator at heart. Even now, he was known as one of the best of the lot and whenever smaller towns, suburbs or the countryside reported crimes that no one had a clue as to how to proceed on, he and his team were very much in demand. Along with them was their faithful and efficient watchdog, Bruno, who was three and half and had succeeded his ten year old father in this job. Bruno’s father Dino was now retired and live with Greg’s parents in South London, keeping them company and enjoying their pampering and attention.
“No, no, no, I am not reneging on our agreement,” Sherlock stopped him, “I promised five million and you will get five million. But I need a little more time. For now, I’ll try and get you something. There is a room downstairs, the wing where his mummy used to stay. There is a store room and there they’ve stashed quite a bit of jewels and art. It’s difficult to get the paintings out because they’re too big but maybe some of the gemstones. I’ll try and get hold of the gemstones.”
; it wasn’t as if he was okay about getting hard while holding down his bratty housemate who had just annoyed the hell out of him. But he put it down to adrenalin rush, extreme exhaustion, disorientation due to anger and an overall sense of despondency that had driven both to the edge.
Sherlock sat quietly, lost in some thought, while his parents opened their gifts. “Oh my God,” Eugenia gasped, clasping her mouth in pleasant shock, “This clutch purse is so gorgeous. Kate Spade purses are really amazing, and this one compliments my formal outfits, most of them. Very good choice Sherlock.”
In any other situation they would have run but this was about their men, their partners, people they had put rings on.
“I still want you to take your time,” John said, “We will share a room because we need to make this seem real, seem genuine. So, in order to know each other better, how about we cycle around the property or do you want to do some rowing on the lake?”
“When you are in your nineties my dear, you realize you’re living beyond what’s due to you, like ‘borrowed time’. That’s a harsh statement but true. Your peers, friends, almost everyone you grew up and grew old with have gone. Sometimes it’s not nice to be the one left behind!”
“No,” John repeated as he let go completely and climbed up his body, as naked as Sherlock was, and kissed him deeply on the mouth. Sherlock tasted his own musk and it was strangely intoxicating. He moaned for more, hips moving up and down on their own. “Not like this my love,” John hissed, feeling for Sherlock’s opening with two fingers. They slipped in easily.
I refused a case today. It wasn’t so interesting. But while I was refusing it over the phone the eggs burned and when I tried to flip them over, they flew upwards and got stuck in the ceiling. Mrs. Hudson almost got a crick in the neck staring at them in astonishment.
“Jawn will,” Sherlock said, yawning wide. Sleep was catching up to him finally, the results of a long day, the meds and the last bit of adrenalin leaving his body. His body went slightly slack and he blinked sluggishly.
“Martha, please consider something before you discourage him,” Haines had closed the door and joined them by then, “For the first time in weeks I saw him smile. Must we be naysayers and just take that joy away from him, again? You have brought him up, I have watched him from childhood to teens to adulthood. You know he is a shy, reticent man and not someone who’d socialize and date and find boyfriend at the click of fingers. He has relatives who still keep sending him pics and profiles of girls. Mycroft and Roger have been introducing him to several men who seem to take a fancy towards him, only for him to turn them all down. Shouldn’t we be happy that for once he seems to be interested in someone?”
Over the next three days John found Sherlock to be a package of opposites, a complex and unpredictable man who needed to be handled with care and caution. He was alternatively annoying and charming, endearing and provocative, pleasant and irritable.
A small rash on his hip was bothering him, a typically mild overnight rash due to allergy, so he went into a closed booth and shut the door. Sherlock took a few minutes in adjusting his clothes and spraying a mild anti-allergen on the affected spot, then using the toilet and re-fixing his pants. But by the time he emerged, the whole scenario had changed. The semi-crowded men’s room was suddenly totally empty and quiet, save for one single figure standing at the door. Sherlock noticed that the door had been locked from inside, obviously by the same man. He frowned, “What did you do?”
As it normally happened to human memory, with time every wound heals, every bad memory recedes and every fear evaporated into just a tiny, niggling worry. The same happened to him.
“You were foolish to think I am so dense,” Sherlock went on, swallowing hard, “Then you made the same mistake with Mary. You thought she’s just…..guess what, she told me she’ll step aside and I told her the same but then….do you really deserve any one of us? I have stayed away from sex, from attraction, from infatuation, diligently, carefully, zealously. But you pranced in, made me change, made me vulnerable and then you hurt me.”
Sebastian answered, “We know man, we know because we did what it took to remedy the curse properly. It took a lot to use the knives but when we finally did….. stabbed, at that very stage between animal and man as their beastly forms reversed to human shape, we saw…..”
Sally put down her bowl of salad and gave both men a sour look. She lit a cigarette and crossed the room, going to stand before the window. “I am sorry, I don’t mean to be a bitch but I am not used to seeing THE Superintendent Lestrade in such a pathetic condition. We have worked as a trio for 10 years now – ever since you and I were constables and he was a detective inspector. We have shared not only perils and success but also joys and disappointments, ups and downs of all kinds. Any man would be fucking pleased to be with you but this fellow…. I understand he is very good looking but…. C’mon, our Gregory is not just ‘anyone’ either, is he? Admit it chief, whatever you are doing in this case….. you are taking it to a personal level. That John might not be any problem at all and yet…..”
“Jaww-wwnn!” A hoarse and desperate groan left him and his hips jerked up, hard. He was so close to cumming he could taste his own release, well almost. Every time he tried to tense up and release, John took his mouth off cunningly and only used his fist, leaving him on dry banks again with his orgasm receding. “Please…..” he begged, breathy voice and pleading tone unmistakable as he longed for that orgasm, “Make me…..” he paused. Even after years of being in John’s bed he was still a shy virgin in some ways. John talked dirty and voiced needs, he couldn’t do so even now.
When John called Sherlock the next day to have lunch with him, pulling out all the punches he had to take things to the next stage, he was horrified when he heard Phillip in the background. Moments after Sherlock had accepted, Phillip took the phone from him and said, “Hey John, you wouldn’t mind if I come along too huh? After all the more the merrier, right?”
Sherlock woke up and knew by instinct he was not alone in bed. John was with him and he was in his arms, safe and sound, loved and protected. For some peculiar reason, he felt like John was the stronger, more anchored and powerful partner in the relationship and he was the dependent one, needier too, if one might add. Perhaps it was the emotional thing where Sherlock felt he was more vulnerable than John was. From time to time he had noticed a particularly admirable quality in John, a steely look in his eyes that told him the man was far mightier than his circumstances permitted him to show.
Sherlock sat up in a hurry and was almost immediately wrapped up in an embrace by John who turned on the bedside light hurriedly. “Easy, easy, it’s only me, I am back baby boy,” the older man said soothingly, “Sorry I got so late but my mentor, the world renowned surgeon Diana Mason Wright, she spent more time working on my file than I had expected. It’s 2 am, go back to sleep hon.”
“I should have asked him to leave that very night,” he rued as he studied the titles of the books. The cunning man had arranged the books in such a way that it wasn’t the case of a small conspicuous gap between the other books. Then he could have identified the missing item in a matter of seconds.
“What….?” Sherlock asked in an incoherent manner, turning his head slightly to one side to check why John had stopped licking his hole.
John gave him a mesmerized glance before he pulled him into his arms. “You amazing man you! I had been thinking about that for a while now and you just pulled the words out of my mouth and said them. It’s like we share one brain, one chain of thought or something like that….” He kissed Sherlock on the forehead, “You see, I think this is a year of healing and reconciling. If I am expecting you to reconcile with your family then I must lead the way. Whether or not she was from the wedlock, we share a parent. Harry and I share a mother and for that she deserves to be a part of my life, of all this, of this family. If my dad and my grandmother had no problems either, then it’s foolish of me to be such a stick in the mud.”
And so things went on, the same way as before. Sherlock confessed some of this to his former landlady and current housekeeper, a lady by the name Mrs. Hudson, who visited his home once a day for all five working days of the week. While they were not related, they were exceptionally close and understood each other. Sherlock, whilst scolding Mrs. Hudson for talking too much and being too nosey, also used her as a sounding board for all decisions he took and ranted with her about situations and people when needed.
In less than a minute they were wrapped up together, limbs coiled, mouths mashed against each other, their hands thrust into each other’s bottomwear. While John jerked him off with long, luxuriant stroke and frequent rubbing of his thumb over the slit, Sherlock used both hands to pleasure John. He used his right hand only around the mushroom head while with the left one he kept playing with his balls.
“I-I see….but no, I do not have that problem. I have….sincerely I have no clue what’s happened to me. Maybe it’s just you.”
Sherlock nodded, quite grateful for that information and already making up some strategy in his head about how he’d tackle the conversation with John. He knew it wouldn’t be easy. While his love for John had never died, too much water had flown under the bridge and he knew the initial interactions might get angsty, stilted or counter-productive. Having a plan would certainly help. He was in no mood to take any shit anymore, not after his innocence had been proved and the real culprits were out in the open. He very much wanted to know what actions, legal or otherwise, John had taken against his own cousin, or was his ire and sense of judgment only reserved for non-family members?!?
“Nnng-Nnng-Nnng,” Sherlock went, making nasal sounds of ‘objections’ as he cupped and fondled John’s sizeable balls, sucking even harder. He loved how well hung his man was and he felt his luck go on an overload mode whenever John responded to him so lovingly, with so much passion and eagerness.
For a few moments John had a comical expression of shock and bewilderment on his face. When he realized he was forgiven and all was well he relaxed visibly and when it dawned on him a moment later that Sherlock himself wanted to willingly take the next step, a huge grin broke through his visage. He let out a chuckle, shook his head with a relieved smiling before lunging at Sherlock and picking him up in his arms. “Ohh,” Sherlock clutched at his arm, surprised by how easily John lifted him off the ground and didn’t even break into a sweat, “I didn’t know…. You are so strong!!”
Sherlock had sensed what John was planning/thinking to do and had played along, even though he was not comfortable with that. He could have refused but he didn’t.
Something moved in the corner of her room and then she saw them, those eyes, the pair of eyes that just couldn’t belong to a human.
In the darkness he could see the outline of a figure on the bed. Yes, yes, yes, just a few more steps and my work will be done, mission accomplished, a year of searching and planning finally bearing fruition! Yes, this time I will have my pound of flesh.
She very, very cautiously looked up and another drop landed, on her cheek this time. It didn’t take her more than three seconds to recognize what seemed to ‘have been’ her boyfriend.
Mary moaned as John took a nipple in his mouth and sucked hard on it, all the while as he kept thrusting into her. He had cut out the foreplay and started sex the moment they had entered her small flat and Mary was so excited by the time they had taken their clothes off, she was wet and ready for the next thing.
“Johnny the man,” Mike Stamford greeted John cheerfully as the former army doctor entered the now empty autopsy lab to meet his former college mate and current referee. Well, the lab was almost empty. One nurse was still there and she gave John a pointed look as she left.
for him. Whether you’re a male or female, you eventually look for someone who’s perfect for you. They needn’t be perfect for real, they just need to be what you need. Find out what Sherlock needs, feed him that and he will be yours forever.”
“I was going to say intrusive people but that wouldn’t mean you. You expressed an interest in me as a person, not in mere incidents and gossip or private things about my life. There is a difference between what you asked and the other thing.”
“Yes sir, I do. I was going to show you or maybe I was expecting you to notice it on your own. Remember the photo I snapped when you were jet skiing in our lake? The same one. I framed it and kept it on my desk at my home office. My cousin is welcome to walk around the house an enter any room, aside from my bedroom of course. So he must have gone in and his companion might have spotted your photo.”
…… the thick and long dick probing in his very core managed to brush some part of him inside which made sparks ensue, bolts and bolts of pleasure and white heat hitting every nerve end of his body and culminate in red hot fiery passion crackle within him.
“No you don’t need to search tomorrow,” Ben said, looking at the garden door, “I saw someone there, in that shed over there. That’s John. I remember the jersey he was wearing when he left. You go in there and you’ll find him.”
“There is a reason,” she said, “One is for being a good friend to my son, a friend he’s found after a long time. The second one is for not giving up on him, because I know he can be unbearable at times. The third is from a mum who’s just very grateful to you for saving her son’s life.”
“That’s how people speak when they are given such odd surprises,” John snorted, “If you want better language or manners, then identify yourself first. I do not answer to anyone and everyone. As for my height, it is none of your business.”
He pressed the button of the intercom and asked the concierge on duty at night, “Yes Baker. I am awake. What is it?”
Mycroft was the first one to react, “Aren’t you one of the salesmen in the same institution Sherlock teaches in?”
He flapped and flailed his arms and legs and tried to hold on to something that could break his fall and maybe it was a miracle, maybe he was lucky, but he did manage to grip something just about seven or six feet above the ground – a protruding branch of a tree.
John wanted to lash out, yell at him for forming imaginary things in his head and calling them facts but his conscience stabbed at him.
“Awww, innocence how I miss thee! You really thought I was in love with your Puritan arse and Mormon like lifestyle…. Oooh touch-me-not, oh no we can kiss but not tongue-kiss, date but not fuck, who the fuck agrees to such frigidity and suck-arse morals nowadays huh? A hot blooded Irishman like me, someone who can get anybody he wants, well, I was only using you. Yeah, you would have eventually been a good lay and I sincerely regret not having fucked you or get fucked by you…. But that’s fine. I have the biggest cock in town, Sebastian’s.”
Sherlock, with the encouragement of his first boyfriend and roommate Victor Trevor during their Cambridge days together, started to work as an amateur detective when he was only twenty. After solving the mystery of Victor’s rich dad’s stolen Rolex watch and later the mystery of their college principle’s stolen property papers, Sherlock had become quite famous in the student community.
Greg checked his watch and said somberly, “I think you better leave now Myc. It’s midnight already. I am a lot better now and I’ll be fine on my own.” But Mycroft shook his head at the suggestion, “
John licked a hot strip up Sherlock’s neck, across his jawline and then the shell of his ear. The younger man thrashed about, his wiry limbs jerking and shaking, a look of pure need on his beautiful and rose-flushed face. With his hairs all askew, his eyes darker with lust, his nude body all spread out like marmite on toast, he was the most amazing creature John had ever seen. He attacked the twin nubs on Sherlocks chest with his lips, teeth and tongue, making him keen beautifully.
Which John did and after shaking hands with Greg, he patted the girl on the head and pinched the boy’s chubby cheeks. “Hello, what are your names?” He asked, then looked at Sherlock, “They are adorable. You must be so proud……”
Sherlock grabbed the letter first and started to read while the retainer cooed and cuddled the canine which went ‘yip-yip-yip’ at the sight of Sherlock, enthusiastically wagging its tail. Sherlock took it in his arms and continued to focus on the letter and the more he read, the more his heart wrenched in his chest. It was short but poignant.
She gave him a shy smile before she left and was soon replaced at the doorway by a rather peeved Janet.
“M’awake, m’wide awake colonel, what’s the rush?” John got out of bed and stepped into a pair of shorts and picked up a T shirt.
Obviously Mycroft had to take some quick measures to ensure absolute secrecy. No one must know he had brought a guy home and that fellow had stayed overnight at their place. The first thing he did was to give their housekeeper Petunia a day off. Petunia was a stay-at-home help and was delighted to have this free time so she could visit some relatives. A second maid came by every alternate day to do the laundry, vacuuming, gardening and run some errands for Petunia. She too was sent home after the laundry was done and slightly before Sherlock woke up after a sleep-in on the weekend.
“We have to talk,” Jim said, clenching and unclenching his fists as he walked, his shorter legs taking speedier strides to keep up with Sherlock’s longer ones. “Yes and it’s best to talk somewhere where we won’t be disturbed. I was also very annoyed by her, actually that Irene female and the other one, face caked with makeup. Anthea, yes Anthea.”
“It’s just the name of the building we live in, all buildings have a name and address….err, most of them do.”
He jumped down from the tree and landed a few feet before Sebastian, lithe as a cat and steady on his feet. Sebastian lifted him in a piggyback ride and said, “I love this place and could have stayed here all day but if you wanna show me other parts of the lake and land, I am game. Now, which way are we going to go?”
It was supposed to be a quickie and it sure was, but the results were blinding. Both men nearly lost their five senses as their orgasm shuddered through them and Jim punched the closed window a few times, head turning from side to side in ecstasy. His legs were in the air, his fingers digging into the older man’s skin, his pale skin flushed crimson as Mycroft heaved and moved over him.
John’s voice brought him back to the present. “Unbelievable! I really like those too. I was just wondering if young people nowadays are still fond of plays and theater as much as they love movies with all those CGI and sound-play and 4D experience and all that.”
Pamela never married. She wasn’t heartbroken, merely astounded and lost faith on menfolk since that evening.
Irene came around, blinking, “What-What was that?” She asked, hoping she was wrong. The men she had brought along stood up, helping their injured comrades back on their feet and trying to make sense of the situation too. They heard more growling, now at the front door and back door. One of the men went to the back door at the kitchen and tried to double bolt it. for a second the growling stopped then…..
John was quite startled at this unusual and extra-friendly interaction. This senior surgeon and HOD could call anyone for a sudden meeting and no one would bat an eyelid. People were usually honored to be in the presence of this man, who was always busy and had little time to chitchat. “It’s perfectly okay doctor,” John replied with extra respect and politeness, “Also, I am not done for the day yet. I finished one surgery, appendix removal. I have at least four or five more hours to go. It’s only 2 PM now so yeah, attending this meeting is no problem at all.”
Lestrade turned towards his assistant. “He will stay in my guest room, not the hotel. Charge him only half the fees I normally take.”
“I guess that phrase by created by those who think there are non-real men in this world,” John snorted and then playfully ruffled Sherlock’s hairs, “Hey, I am sorry okay? I really am. I didn’t mean to run away, I was just trying to get out of your way and get you out of my system until I realized you’re with me even when you’re not. You have cast a spell, some sort of black magic effects on me and I don’t think I can shake it off.” He paused, took Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissed his forehead, “Darling I don’t want to shake it off. You’re that microchip that’s embedded into my soul and no matter how many surgical attempts are made to separate us, we simply won’t be able to.”
“How about this,” Sherlock said, “Let me come and see you now and then, let’s see if we can be friends. Actually I might need some help around the house, my lands, tenants, my investments. You could be more of a support than a liability. Help me make more time for my research.”
. He leaned in and grabbed John’s head, kissing him so hard that his teeth and John’s teeth collided with each other’s lips, the faint taste of blood lacing their mouths as they swapped spit and emotions, kissing the hell out of each other. John, who had been contemplating a relationship with Sherlock for a long time, was glad he had finally taken the step and was eager to take this ‘forward’ to more
“Oh….” The two parents turned towards Sherlock, looking baffled. Even for an eccentric little rabble rouser like Sherlock this was quite a huge thing. Mycroft snorted and shook his head, waiting for the younger sibling to take a whack or two.
“Neither do I. But with the amount of investigations you have done on me, do we need to be so extra cautious. I am clean. I got tested three days ago.”
“I remember the entire kitchen set-up,” Sherlock said proudly, “From the jars and containers and their contents to the drawers and the fridge. I just looked at them once and then set a pattern in my mind palace to help me remember the whole thing and…..”
On her insistence he accepted the package and started opening it carefully, trying not to look took eager or too disinterested. The situation was becoming unreal now. He was accepting a gift from the mother of his housemate, who was
, John felt his hips jerk upwards as if seeking more friction. They were both breathing heavy and John no longer felt a drunk, mischievous and out of control housemate on his lap but a really handsome young man, with a sexy gravelly voice, who smelled great and impressed him daily with his brain-power, sitting so tantalizingly close and in such a provocative manner, that he wanted to…..
“I can’t believe how easily and quickly Sherlock turns a perfect tidy, clean and freshly painted flat into something of a mess,” the landlady complained in a good-natured manner, “The boys and I will clean it all up today, don’t worry John. Sherlock still asleep? There’s tea on the kitchen table, I am sure you need a cup.”
, the big fat old man who needed a haircut, needed to lose weight even more than that, who ‘judged people 363 days a year and rewarded them on the 364
She froze and opened her mouth to scream out for help but no sounds came out. The sounds of voices had receded, as had the chirping of crickets. Now all she could hear was the faint snarling and breathing of the creature. Then she saw its shadow on the wall as the car, whose engine she had heard earlier, drove past the window. This time she let out a strangled cry and got out of bed hurriedly, her panicky and jerky movements pulling the IV bag and stand down with a crash.
, sit down, we shall discuss this properly. And wear this, my robe, even if it’s a bit too short. Your teeth are chattering so loud Mrs. Hudson can hear it from her flat.”
He kissed Sebastian on the shoulder and suddenly tasted blood from the tiny half moon shapes cuts he had given the man during their foreplay. His eyes snapped open, the pupils now almost white with a maroon rim and center. He could feel the heat coming on. He could taste and smell what he wanted to avoid – his victim’s blood!!
Already the predatory beast inside him was threatening to come out. At the sight of his friend and fellow shapeshifter being threatened, Sherlock lost his remaining abilities to keep the creature contained within himself and ‘turned’.
“Or perhaps your boyfriends can help choose. Here, would you two like to come inside and take a look at the fish and birds section.”
. Only Sherlock could manage to disguise a compliment in an overall insult. “Go ahead and change. I will order something for us to eat.”
“Sure love,” he replied with earnestness, “I would love to go there for tonight.” At least that part was no lie, no feigning and pretending. He did want them to go there so they would be able to get on with their plan and ensure the ‘cure’ was given to both of them. Somewhere he knew John was also moving towards such a step. He wondered how much luck he had!
With that, Sherlock got up from the table they were sitting at and went off. “I have a class now,” he declared on his way out. Phil looked at the two women seated at the other end of the table in the staff lounge and was rather irked when he saw they were grinning. “He has really changed,” he snapped as he too got up to leave.
Pierre just nodded and saw him off till the door. As John bounded down the staircase, he whispered, ‘What indeed’ and whipped out his cell phone. When the call connected he snickered and said, “Mission accomplished. It was a piece of cake. He is going to call him there tonight. You can transfer the money right away. I need to get out of here before boss returns.”
John’s hand shook at the cup he was holding. The liquid spilled on to his hands and he winced, then mumbled a quick apology. “You okay?” Mary asked, frowning, “You look pale as a sheet.” She paused and studied his countenance for a few more seconds and asked, “Did some trigger happen? A memory trigger or something? Look, I am asking because such triggers need to be reported to Emily…. Dr. Mortimer, your shrink.”
No, I do mind. I wasn’t inviting you, it was supposed to be me and Sherlock. Why don’t you find someone else to be your lunch date. “Yes you can come too.”
With that he stood next to the door, “Now, if you don’t mind, I have other things to take care of. I wish you all a very good day ahead. Excuse my rudeness and lack of hospitality but I wasn’t exactly expecting you.”
“Make tea…..what?” John looked on, dismayed, as Sherlock pushed past him and took a seat at the breakfast counter. Unprepared for this moment, this situation or this behavior, John just went ahead and started the kettle, muttering under his breath about housemates and crazy geniuses. Minutes later he disdainfully slammed a mug before Sherlock before he took a seat next to him. “Now tell me,” he demanded.
Jim is still the mastermind. Sebastian is a support and an informer, but planting Sherlock in John's life and home is Jim's handiwork and his brainchild.
“I saw that thing too, whatever it is. Mrs. Hudson, it might be a night prowler, an animal with glowing eyes that doesn’t mind climbing ledges. The size and those eyes, they didn’t quite seem like that of a regular house cat though.”
Sherlock got a jolt at that. So John’s mother’s necklace had been stolen and sold. Now things began to come back to him. He could put two and two together. The sounds he had heard while napping with John in the den on that side of the house, the flash of blond he had seen at the window the other day, the fact that Jim was suddenly in the house and no one else knew, it all added up. Sebastian and Jim had leveraged information culled from him, found a way to break the lock or disable the alarms and stolen the necklace.
Those were words spoken in a long time as John and Sherlock explored each other’s bodies thoroughly, kissing and touching and caressing one another with fervent joy and pleasure, the creaking sounds of the bed and the tapping of the headboard against the wall bearing testimony to their impassioned movements. When John entered Sherlock the duo cried out with unbridled joy, clinging to each other as their dreams were finally fulfilled and they had connected at the most intimate level. As the momentum built, the sounds of things rattling on the nightstand and Sherlock needy moans complimented each other perfectly, punctuated by John’s grunts and little chuckles as they went on and on, craving culmination and yet unwilling to let go just yet.
“Fifteen minutes,” Sherlock said, rolling over to face John. He looked well-rested too. John’s head fell back on the pillow and he threaded his fingers through those dark curls, playing with them as he absentmindedly thought about the situation. Did this change anything? Of course it did. Once you slept with your best friend it was ruined….or indelibly different from whatever equation you shared with them before. John hoped it was different from now on but manageable. He didn’t want things ruined. They shared too good a thing to stop…..living together or working on cases together.
He was looking closely at the bathroom, happy to see it was squeaky clean and had no leaks and mold, when he felt someone literally breathing down his neck. He turned and his nose knocked into someone’s chin.
“Hmm, he does seem attached to Sherlock and may not give up easily. John, you also remember I hope that there’s always a chance of retaliation. So cover your arse at all points, don’t give him an opportunity to destroy your carefully built castle because given a chance he shall do so ruthlessly. From what I heard in your texts, he’s getting desperate.”
“Alright, I am neither sorry nor thrilled,” Sebastian said in a matter of fact manner, “Let’s just get back into the vehicle, shall we?”
They kissed, putting their arms around each other. The gentle, light kiss deepened, as if often happened whenever they got into a lip-lock and for more than a minute they just stood there looking into each other’s eyes. If Gretel thought they were taking too long to get ready and come out, she didn’t hurry them up nor did she show any signs of impatience. “Alright,” John pulled back after a long time, “We really gotta go downstairs now.”
Jim kissed Sherlock on his chin and the corner of his lips, suggestively brushed his rear against his arm and walked off with Sebastian tailing him like a faithful hound. Sherlock wanted to follow them but he didn’t deem it worthy. He was actually glad they had left,
Fortunately at that late hour no one appeared. Servant quarters were in the basement, most of their work was on the ground floor and bedrooms were on the first. The second floor, or the third level of the mansion, usually remained deserted post dinner. All the rooms were kept closed for the night. “Hello Jimmy,” he whispered again, slightly louder, “What’s with all that awful noise around you? Are you partying??!”
Greg snorted, “I have never had complaints about lack of effort from you two so I’m not worried there. What intrigues me about this is the motive. Why would anyone want to kill that woman? In that aspect I agree with Sherlock and I too kinda feel he has a point. But then, if he really came to steal the gem then why wasn’t another attempt made to steal the thing? Nope, the local cops kept an eye out on the house, the residents installed new security cameras and burglar alerts, so surveillance has been beefed up considerably. Maybe that’s why no one came back. Are they biding their time and will attack again? Why was the dog murdered? Phillip, tell me what does a dog do that could thwart the attempts of a thief?”
He straightened his back, holstered his gun and went to switch on the lights. As bright lights gleamed around them, he saw Sherlock and no less than three more men emerge, one of them being the one he had taken down. He was holding an ice pack to the back of his head.
They stayed silent for a few seconds after which Greg said ruefully, “We have to investigate the watch shop and find out who this person
“I know son, I know about that. But it’s no one’s fault. Why should they bear the brunt of your misfortune? Isn’t there a way to contain yourselves for those days of the year when you’re dangerous for society. Believe me, if there is a way I shall help you. No one will know the truth.”
“Yeah,” Mike said, lowering his voice, “I met him. He’s great. He’s really good looking and he’s really great. Congratulations! I think you’re all set now.”
John's presence and interest in Sherlock has given Andersen an additional burst of energy and purpose to pursue the gorgeous Mr. Holmes!
“Again it’s my….” Sherlock tapped his temple with his index finger and took out a book from his shoulder bag. He placed it on the table for his friend to look at and quipped, “It’s a popular and well-written book on Lego art and guess what I found on the last page? Comments from the writer and illustrator, along with his credentials. John Hamish Watson. He’s created some really spectacular things in his studio, including a life size likeness of one football megastar and an Academy winning actor. He’s also won three awards in this category, one in the UK, one in the continent and one more online one I think. He part owns a firm that’s into modern art and design. I saw this book in his hand and went looking for it in a store one weekend, found all that I needed to know on the last page. Simple as that!”
