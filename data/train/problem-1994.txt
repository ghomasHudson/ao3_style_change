“Just try it, yeah?”
“Sorry, sir.” Wiggins jerks himself awake and sits up ramrod straight, forcing his eyes to stay open.
“You can’t watch me forever! Just like I can’t watch chemical reactions forever. Just like forever is all eternity. Eternity in a bottle. Bottles of chemicals. Where are my chemicals, John?!” He rounds on John and shouts at him.
(See the end of the chapter for

“He won’t.” John looked down at his phone, tracking the suspect phone via the GPS on his own.
“People don’t use hard drugs just because their bored, Sherlock.”
“This,” Sherlock brings his hand up to place over John’s, making him press firmer against his face.
“Perfectly,” Sherlock’s voice squeaks and he has to clear his throat, “Perfectly, perfectly.” He coughs and looks at anywhere but John, before narrowing his eyes in defiance at his own embarrassment and giving John an almost-glare. “Why wouldn’t it be?”
“Odd name. Why do you call it that?”
“But...” Sherlock looked genuinely puzzled, “You
refused to say romantic.
’.” Sherlock scoffs.
“What if I don’t want this to stop, just because I don’t need it anymore. What if I still want it.”
“Mhm,” John answered, pulling Sherlock down for another press of lips. He rubbed his stubbled cheek against Sherlock’s smooth one -- the man honestly never got a five-o-clock shadow. “Antarctica being top of the list.” he pulled away to see the glint of humour in Sherlock’s eyes.
The sun had set hours ago and the flat had gone dark with its loss. The only light available was whatever happened to filter in from the windows. Regardless, Sherlock turns his face into the carpet. Inexplicably not wanting to be seen by the man he was perfectly fine being held by.
The skin of Sherlock's hand may be soft but only in the places not marred by scars and calluses, even the odd calcium deposit from too many days spent writing with pen on paper. Looking at his hand now he can see on the back of it the little white specks where acid had come into contact with his skin during an experiment when he hadn’t had the energy to put on gloves. And there, next to his thumb, is the stab mark from when he was seventeen. He always tells people he was stabbed trying to apprehend a criminal, but instead he was just a very bored teenager trying to relieve some of that boredom by stabbing around his fingers with a knife as fast as he could.
“Sherlly.”
. To each other.” he clarifies.
“S’alright, Love. It’s me. I’m here now.”
“That new Chinese place around the corner?”
“Now, that wasn’t so bad, was it?” Seb asks, but Sherlock knows better than to answer, he just stares at Sebastian with wild eyes, mouth hanging open. Sebastian rubs the thumb of the hand not restraining Sherlock over the younger man’s bottom lip. “Want to have even more fun?”
-----
“No, Sherlock. Not good. Ruining thirty kids Christmas’ is pretty ‘not good’.” John told the pavement, refusing to look at his flatmate.
“Why are you crying?” Sherlock asks, beyond confused.
“Come on, then.”
“Right.” John had said at that, and then he’d simply grabbed a book, moved his chair over so it was right next to Sherlock, and then sat down and began to read.
Sherlock makes eye contact with John as he puts his cigarette out into the tea, letting him know it wasn’t just a mistake, and that he’d meant to do it.
They are.
“Why do I have to be the one to wear it?” Sherlock still had his arms crossed defiantly over his chest, glaring at the monstrosity in John’s hand. “Why can’t it be you?”
“I am focused.” Sherlock snaps at John quietly.
“Yer not
John awoke, sleep-slowed arm reaching for the Sherlock he thought he was sure to find. When he was met by nothing but empty, cold sheets, he groggily blinked awake, lifted his head and looked about the room.
Sherlock spares a glance at the man, sees he’s still in his rain soaked coat and scarf. Then looks back out the open window.
Sherlock has to turn so he can see John out of his periphery.
Sherlock blushes at this despite his best efforts not to ‘
And the second thing he notices is the light from the windows and how it burns his eyes. It isn’t overly bright, just the normal humdrum grey, the usual pallor of London skies, yet it strikes his pupils like a high intensity light used for interrogation.
“But why?” Sherlock draws his brow together in apprehension.
So that’s how John found himself, a week before Christmas, wrestling Santa to the ground as he tried to resist arrest, listening to the angry shouts of parents and the horrified cries of children.
“Sherlock?” The concern is palpable. It almost makes Sherlock want to respond. As it is, it only gives him enough of a boost to shrug his shoulders.
Sherlock looked back to John, and John tried to say something along the lines of ‘don’t’ but was too preoccupied with Santa to really get out more than a few huffs of exertion.
In the end they didn’t need the GPS. Sherlock picked a Santa out of the crowd and immediately ran forward and tackled him. John didn’t often question Sherlock on whether he’d gotten the right man, but couldn’t stop himself from feeling dread as Sherlock went flying through the air before colliding with Chris Kringle. How could he explain their way out of this one if Sherlock had just attacked some poor, unassuming, Santa Claus?
“J-John?” Sherlock asks, body shaking so fiercely that it rattles his chest, shakes the words as they come out of him.
“Get tha fook off me!” The Santa shouted as Sherlock wrestled with him to the ground. “I’ll fookin’ kill ya!”
“That telling kids Santa wasn’t real wasn’t an absolutely awful thing to do?”
Sherlock is far too keyed up to sit, his limbs are in riot and the confines of 221B’s living room are driving him mad! But his senses balk at the idea of subjecting himself to the world outside his little cocoon. Short of throwing himself at the mercy of the overstimulating London streets, pacing the flat is the next best thing.
“Thought you might try this,” John says, approaching Sherlock from the other side of the flat by the fireplace, where he’d just plugged his iPhone into that monstrosity Mrs.Hudson has gotten them for Christmas and has since sat abandoned on Sherlock’s desk.
“Oh,” Sherlock chuckles at the zapping sensation of the action. He suddenly feels much more inebriated. “Oh, this s’nice, isnnitt?” He smiles to himself. “I’ll just tell tha’
. Ears hypersensitive due to withdraws.
“I need some!” Sherlock yells at John as he carefully places Sherlock’s skull back on the mantle.
too much. It’s not as though he were being unsafe. Nothing that stupid. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard to measure out the correct doses when you’ve been on a drug binge for a few days. Though he knows he managed to make a list. It’s in his breast-pocket. So it can’t have been all that bad if he managed to write it down first… Right?
Suddenly, there is a scuffling sound. A screaming. Sherlock furrows his brow but doesn’t move. People need to keep it down. They’re ruining his fun!
The third thing he notices is John, sat in a chair across from him. The odd sensation of having found yourself sitting when you had no memory of stopping standing, pales in comparison to Sherlock’s mounting mortification.
John loved that photo; a confused and red-eyed Sherlock--from the camera flash, not drugs (thank God)--arms full of Chinese takeout and that hat clumsily balanced on his head. It ended up framed and on the wall above the fireplace. Even all these years later, John will be walking, or pacing, in front of the fire, and see that picture. And for a moment he’ll be filled with memories of Sherlock tackling Santa, of that stupid hat--which they still have somewhere--and the rest of that night. He'd remember how they’d zoned out together on bad telly and good Chinese food. How they’d ended up falling asleep and waking up snug as a bug, wrapped up around each other. How they’d had their first kiss, complete with morning breath and Mrs. H interrupting them as things got heated. John would remember all that, and it would bring a smile to his face. It was, to this day, his favorite picture of Sherlock. And he was pretty sure it always would be.
777 Vattier LAne
“Funny!?” Sherlock looked outraged. It made John smile, though he tried to hide it.
“Oh, God, yes.” Sherlock breathes, and before he knows it John is in his lap, kissing him breathless.
John nods to himself and then disappears into the rest of the flat.
“Hmm.” he says.
“Because believe it or not, I do actually pay attention!”
Sherlock holds up his phone, not bothering to stop. “I’ll send you a text!”
“Just, I…” Sherlock doesn’t know how to say it without saying it. Oh how he wished he had that capacity to make subtle implications and sub-textual references, the way John and so many other people seem to have. Then he could allude to this. Then it wouldn’t be so damned difficult. “You… do realize I’m a homosexual?”
“Because, there’s the kick when you first snort it, and then all you want to do afterwards is to sit down and ponder on things for a while.”
-----
John’s mouth drops open in disbelief, he shakes his head before, “Nothing,” he sits back in his chair, grabs the newspaper and fluffs it out, “Nothing. At. All.”
“Yes, Love.” The petting continues as Sherlock releases the hand. It’s brushing away tears that Sherlock wasn’t aware he’d shed.
Sherlock’s eyes did that thing where John could see the absurd amount of thoughts whirring past them, as if they were one of those old microfilm readers that used to make John seasick back in school. They let him have a glimpse into Sherlock’s mind palace. Among the flickers of emotion that John was able grasp before they passed by, wonder and shock seemed the most prevalent.
“Pardon?”
WOW! It's done! I'm finished! Phew.
They managed to push pass the throng of Christmas shoppers and through the entrance to the shopping mall. Sherlock immediately zeroed in on the Santa village they had set up.
Sherlock can’t see John’s face in the dark, but can feel something shift in the man beside him.
“Hmmm.” Sherlock routes around for his box containing individually packaged sterile needles. He finds it under a pizza box and opens it up, fishing out a needle and ripping the packaging open. “Now, where’s the cocaine.” he wraps a band around his arm as he waits for a reply. “Wiggins?”
The voice is so gentle, soft and caring. As someone might speak when trying to coax a sleepy toddler from bed. This thought makes Sherlock trill a giggle through his teeth.
“This doesn’t get you out of trouble.” John warned once they’d calmed down a bit.
The hand that had gripped Sherlock’s arm moves to his back, caressing. Touched starved as he was, it was this he craved from Seb. That and the drugs. With Seb it was a package deal. He’d fuck you, even hold you afterwards, all as long as you were willing to chase oblivion with him. Sherlock was never one to turn down a good chase.
“NEARLY an hour, unresponsive--And the thing is, Sherlock, it’s not how you usually get when you go into your mind-palace.”
“Are you using again?” Asked lowly, venomously, caring completely outshone by the steel edge, the threat contained in the doting question.
“We need to talk.” Sherlock says, but doesn’t make to elaborate.
John turns around to fully face Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock draws in a sudden breath and snaps his head forward once more. Those eyes of his are so overstimulating. It is the unmaking of Sherlock and he knows it.
He manages to type out before he drops his phone. He’s fairly certain he hit the send button. If not he knows Mycroft has ways of finding him. Actually, why would Mycroft ask for an address in the first place? ‘
“Then… good.”
John Watson could be a menace when he wanted to. And he could be oh so wrong about an astonishing amount of things... So why did Sherlock feel like crying?
“Sherlock.”
“Damn the cases.” John said, and Sherlock gave a mock gasp. “The more remote the better. I’d have you all to myself if I could.”
“Are you hurting?” Sherlock asks, clumsily stroking his hand down John’s face.
Sherlock ‘Hmm’s’ in the positive.
John just shakes his head in Sherlock’s periphery, and then rubs Sherlock’s back as he tosses up into the toilet once more.
Sherlock shuts himself inside his tiny bedroom and proceeds to collapse on top of his bed. He lays there, face flat on the duvet, for what could have been either hours or minutes, before crawling up the bed a bit and turning on his side, curling up on himself in the fetal position.
“I can’t dance to music like
Sherlock sighs dramatically and takes the straw, bending down to hover over the mirror and choose which line to take, which line is the smallest. Sherlock’s entire head had gone numb and every time he swallowed he felt as if he were going to choke. He didn’t want more, but he did want to please Sebastian.
“No.” Sherlock shakes his head darkly. “Far past that now.”
“Well, you were kinda unresponsive for about an hour there—“
-----
“This okay?” John asks, still with that blasted warm smile that had no right to be so disarming.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock. Do you have the window open?” John asked, rubbing his arms and shivering as he approached his madman, who perched on a windowsill, head stuck out said window. The living room was dark, and Sherlock was outlined by the orange-gone-pink streetlamps.
The song that inspired this chapter was 'You Know You're Right' by Nirvana
Sherlock has to laugh at that.
Sherlock’s miffed that it’s not the Beatles singing. Wiggins has the most peculiar taste in music, but you don’t mess with the classics.
“It’s in your hand, Love.” John responds, sitting in his chair with the journal.
“Merry Christmas!” John said right as Sherlock said “Happy Holidays!”
“Yes, thank you,” Sherlock’s voice sounds as wispy as his constitution. He clears his throat and gives a baritone, “Thank you, John.”
“Yes.” he nods against the carpet.
“Are you sure?”
People turned their heads to look at the mad man shouting about Santa, but did not try to stop the obviously intoxicated Father Christmas, nor did they move out of the way as Sherlock and John rapidly approached.
He’s trying to move Sherlock’s legs when a bout of panic hits Sherlock squarely in the chest, making him take in a shocked gasp and open his eyes further.
“Yessir.” Wiggins hands him a cut up straw.
“Alright.” John says, shutting off the telly. “Time for bed, I think.”
Arms wrap around Sherlock’s waist and it knocks all the air from his lungs.
“When I get better--” Sherlock tries but his throat convulsively swallows, effectively cutting him off.
Footsteps on the stairs and Sherlock thinks of putting the cigarette out, of at least attempting to hide the evidence of what he’s been up to. But he doesn’t have the heart, not today. Today was a day that could have John Watson walking in on him with a needle in his arm and Sherlock doubted he’d be able to rustle up a care.
------
“Because!” He shouts, throwing his arms up, “I’m bored!” Sherlock lifts himself up so that he is sitting on the back of his seat, feet where is arse should be, “You say you’ve been paying attention,” Sherlock has a dark, judgmental smile, “But I have told you time and time again—“
“Hmm? No.” Sherlock answers, shaking his head. He needs to get himself under control. That’s the third time in the past two hours that he’d been caught staring at John. And it was only just now turning eleven in the morning.
They kissed in front of the open window, snow drifting down outside in soft tufts, while the pink glow of the streetlamps outlined their joined frames. John forgot how cold he was. All he could feel was the warmth of Sherlock’s lips, and the warmth radiating and pulsing out from his heart.
“Tea?” John asks, already making his way to the kitchen.
With one last contented sigh, Sherlock feels himself being pulled under into the realm of dreams. Tomorrow will be a new day. Filled with tea and newspapers. Cases and John. And even
“Fine.”
That was until someone’s car alarm began blaring into the night.
“This still okay?” John tightens his grip around Sherlock momentarily.
John makes it to the door before,
“NO!” Sherlock’s breaths punch in and out of him faster and faster as he panics more and more. “Who are you!? No, stay away!” he takes a deep breath to scream, “WIGGINS!” he calls out. What was the point of coming here if Wiggins was just going to let random men come in and have their way with Sherlock while he was incapacitated? WHAT WAS THE POINT?!
“Hmm? Oh.” Sherlock side-eyed the puff-ball swinging by his face as he walked. “I thought it was very becoming.”
But then Sherlock just had to go on, didn’t he? He wouldn't be Sherlock if he didn't find a way to piss everyone off in a ten-block radius
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said, turning back to the children and their concerned parents. “That’s not really Santa.” Sherlock shammed a reassuring smile. The parents looked relieved. So did the kids.
“Yes, well...” but Sherlock finds he has nothing to really say, so he shuts his mouth with a tiny click of teeth.
Suddenly there was something soft and fluffy being placed on his head.
“Am I--Of course I’m sure!” John bit his lip at his outburst, and began grinding his teeth to try and stop himself from shouting anymore.
“Angelo’s?” Sherlock suggests.
Now that he thinks of it, perhaps... ? But, no. He didn’t have the energy for it. If he started puking out the window he’d probably just fall right out of it. Down onto the hard, unforgiving pavement. Down until he hit the end of his life...
“Little recipe of my own. I call it ‘Ponderance With A Kick’.”
The End
He hasn’t opened in eyes in hours, maybe days. Maybe just minutes. Time is relative.
When the snow came down this heavily, creating an almost foggy atmosphere, it was hard to tell just how everything would sparkle in the light. But John knew that when the snow let up a little, he would be able to see the impossible shine covering everything, like crushed diamonds, adding new beauty to a scene that would otherwise be so humdrum. Winter Wonderland indeed.
“Yes.” he croaks. Looks away and clears his throat. Looks back. “Yes. I think I would like that very much.”
Sherlock doesn’t turn around to acknowledge he’s heard John, or say anything in return, but he does tilt is head, ever so slightly to the side. He is listening, to whatever John has to say.
like all this last minute shopping, shelling out every last dime for toys your children will be tired of in a few months. And look at your children! They're just as bored and overstimulated by the garish color combinations and flashing lights as you are! None of you actually want to be here. So it doesn't matter that Santa isn't real, or that I just tackled him. You can all go home and stop wasting your time on this Christmas drivel.”
“Yes.” Sherlock croaks. Doesn’t make to clear his throat. Too much energy.
John had been mad. Of course he had. He, as well as Mrs.Hudson, Lestrade, and Molly Hooper, had all given him a good talking to. But.. that had been it. John didn’t leave. No one stopped being his friend, or coworker, landlady, or what have you. They’d all just been… concerned for Sherlock.
“We do all of this already.” Sherlock complains, rolling his eyes, though he feels a strange lightening occur inside his chest, as if his lungs are filled with helium and are attempting to leave his body.
“Nice?”
“Yes, Love. Soon. You’ll be right as rain before you--”
“Just try and stop me.”
“What do you want?” Sherlock asks more gently.
The snow continued to fall. Sherlock and John continued to kiss. Everything was soft, shining and hued in pinks. This was a moment crystallized in time, coated in the diamond dust of winter. This was a moment that John Watson would never, ever forget.
Sherlock feels himself freeze up. He grabs John’s arms where they are crossed over his stomach.
The End
John smiled, “I know, you silly git. Now c’mere.”
I am.”
-----
“I can see that.” John smiled, joining Sherlock by the window and sticking his own head out as well.
“No I’m not using again!” Sherlock does snarl this time, “I’ve wanted to! But I don’t. Not anymore. Not since—“
But his body needs movement, purpose, design of intent and motion—
“How would you know,” Sherlock all but snarls.
‘o buggeroff when’ee gets ‘ere.
“Dancing,” John says, turning around to smile at his flatmate.
Everything is so perfect. So right. And fine, Sherlock will say it.
“Yes, I know it’s fine!” Sherlock snaps. Instantly regrets it. He sighs. “What I mean to say is. Well, um. What I mean to say--or ask, rather--is that… “ Sherlock lets out a angry breath, and is beyond frustrated at the way his hands have begun to shake. “It’s one thing being fine with your flatmate being into blokes. It’s another spooning up against him every night. Hugging him from behind. That sort of thing.”
John rolled his eyes.
“But it’s such a nisssse hellholle.” the man has gotten Sherlock to sit up, though completely supported by his arms around Sherlock’s back. “Stoppit. Don’ wanna go.”
“Why not? Haven’t you ever seen
“John, I--” But what to say?
So this story had been ruminating in my head going on a year now but I've finally managed to get it down on paper...or computer. So tell me what you guys thought! I live for Kudos. Love Comments. And if you leave both I'm likely to drop dead on the spot! :D
He’s moved past Sherlock, behind him, but Sherlock cannot turn around for the life of him.
They sit, staring at each other. Sherlock in his chair, and John in his own. In front of the fire that John had felt compelled to build in the fireplace when Sherlock had first sat down but made no motion to speak. They also had a finger of whiskey each, another compulsion of John’s when Sherlock had continued his silence past the twenty minute mark.
“You don’t need drugs, Sherlock.” John says, but even he is beginning to sound unconvinced.
“Only a little.” Sherlock offers a small half smile, though it vanishes quickly.
The footsteps make it to the bedroom door and stop.
John, however, was the exact opposite.
part of their relationship, they’d slept in the same bed every night.
The foul mouth sort of put John at ease. Even if he was the wrong Santa, at least he wasn't very polite... Though he had just been tackled... Hmm.
Sherlock scoffs at that, sitting his tea down.
“‘Kay.”
“Tell me when that other stuff is ready.” Sherlock slurs.
Sherlock wakes to an empty bed. There’s an instant crushing sensation in his chest, and so he closes his eyes, tries to get himself under control.
“I love you.” He whispers into John’s hair.
John tightens his grip on Sherlock’s hand as well. Presses his body in even closer. Holds onto the man in front of him all the tighter.
“What are we?” Sherlock says suddenly, shocking even himself.
“Why must it always be what I want!” Sherlock snaps again. “Why can’t you take any responsibility for this!” Sherlock has the urge to round on John, confront him directly, face to face. But he quells that urge, knowing it would just be too overstimulating. Would cause Sherlock to flee before this conversation, or whatever it was they were having, had reached its natural end.
“I’m here, Love.” Sherlock has begun to shake again at the memories of what had awoken him. “What is it, Sherlock? What’s wrong.”
“Fine then.” Sherlock tosses a blase hand, rolling his eyes. “Just thought I’d ask, as you were the easiest option.” he heads for his phone. Billy Wiggins is always there in his time of need. Good old Billy.
“I’m not going to to go buy drugs for you.” John seethes. He’s breathing hard through his nose. His skin has turned an odd shade of red. A vein pulses angrily in his temple.
“John.”
“Sherlock,” John scoffs in disbelief, “It’s whatever you need. Always has been.”
“Want me to pick up some patches?” He asks quietly, barely heard over the rain.
Later that night, with the lights out and John once again spooning him up from behind, Sherlock feels an odd bout of bravery, and so asks,
“It means, Sherlock.” he takes a deep breath, leans forward again. “That I would like to take you out. On dates.”
“You okay?” He asks, having walked over to where Sherlock sits in the window.
“Yeah?” John asks over his shoulder, fiddling with the kettle.
“C’mon, Love. Let’s get somewhere more comfortable, yeah?” His voice is so soft, so tender.
“Yeah.”
“No,” Sherlock shakes his head.
“Bout time.” John says quietly, breath dusting over the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“What?” Sherlock narrows his eyes.
John steps in closer, pressing his front to Sherlock’s back, pressing his face into the space between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, his warm breath somehow soaking through Sherlock’s suit jacket and shirt and setting his skin on fire underneath.
“Oh dear god,” Sherlock sing-songs under his breath.
It isn’t a big thing, and it isn’t violent in the slightest. Just a casual grab on the arm to halt Sherlock’s retreat. But Sherlock feels all the anxious energy leave him in a flash. In fact, all sensation, all his senses, are immediately dampened, gone cold, and underwater, floating up, and barely holding onto his physical form, just by the bite of nails into his palm.
“What do you want?!” Sherlock shouts at the figure. Still struggling for all he can.
This frustrates Sherlock to no end. As if a cuppa would help at this point?!
John picks up the tea cup that Sherlock has been using as an ashtray for the last four hours, trying to count the butts before giving up. He sets the cup back down and gives Sherlock an even look.
“What were you going to say?” he is still petting Sherlock’s hair, the side of his face. Sherlock turns into John’s palm where it has come to rest on his cheek.
.” Sherlock says more forcefully. “Not what--what I was going to say.” he tries to control his stammering, but his body shakes so intensely it’s making his teeth chatter.
It shocked John to think that it had been just under four months now. He blearily wondered if four-month anniversaries were a thing, as he got up from the bed and trudged out the bedroom, his footsteps heavy with his tiredness.
Sherlock closes his eyes, feeling a crashing wave of vertigo, takes a deep breath, and then opens his eyes once more.
“No! Stop it! Don’t touch me!” Sherlock tries swinging his arms about, trying to hit the man. It causes the man to grab onto his arms to stop him. Sherlock is shaking, his heartbeat erratic.
This pulled another peel of giggles from her.
“C’mon. Let’s get you out of this hellhole.”
.” he laughs again. “He doessn’t know
Before John could ask if they could please shut the window so they wouldn’t freeze to death, Sherlock dropped his head down and pressed his lips to John’s in a sweet kiss.
what I want?”
Sherlock lays there on the living-room floor, not having moved so much as an inch since John had put them there and then wrapped an arm around him. It is the most comfortable Sherlock has felt in weeks, even though his body is starting to protest a bit at the hard floor beneath it.
“He’s trying to shake us off in the crowd of other Santas!” Sherlock was already running towards the brightly colored, flashing lights of ‘Christmas Town’--or so said the poorly hung up sign.
“What are we what? Doing? I thought you wanted to… ‘talk’. Or whatever.” He looks back down into his whiskey, concern creasing his brow, mouth twisted up to the side by his obvious discomfort with the situation.
“Oh?” Sherlock smiled, dipping in for a quick kiss before pulling back.
“No.” Sherlock narrows his eyes, trying to suss out as much data as possible from the absolutely impossible man who sat across from him. “
And how? How does John know this? How does John seem to know so many things? Making Sherlock look like an infant in comparison. Sure, Sherlock can see. But John
John is home; Sherlock can hear the downstairs door open and shut, the grumbled muterances of a man who’d once again forgotten to bring his umbrella to work, even though he’d had five days now to get it right.
“You feeling alright?”
They had to stand, it was
“I know how to make your bloody tea,” John grumbles.
“No, stop it, Love. It’s just me.”
Sherlock realizes his mouth has dropped open and so shuts it with a click of teeth.
“How did you—Nevermind. I
Sherlock frowns. Mycroft? But why would Wiggins run from Mycroft?
“I’d say three days, sir. Though my mind’s a bit… vague, at the moment, sir.”
“I’m not going anywhere unless you’re coming with me.” John says in a voice that is at once fierce and soft.
“That’s not… “ Sherlock trails off. Swallows again. Nods. “Yes.” he says breathlessly. “A hug is… fine. S’fine.” He shakes his head several times, trying to clear it. Was this a fever-dream? Had he taken drugs at some point today and simply forgotten?
“No problem, yeah,” John waves his thanks off, sitting back down but leaving the journal abandoned, elbows on his knees as he leans forward, hands clasped together, “You sure you’re alright?”
“Then yes, of course,” he breathes out, leans back, apparently able to see Sherlock’s face even though Sherlock can’t see his. “Of course this can stay. I can stay.
“Time is relative,” Sherlock waves a hand. “What is that?” Sherlock watches the drip as well.
Sherlock doesn’t remember the trek to his room. Nor does he remember falling asleep. But he does remember waking up, warm in his own bed. Warmer for the body pressed up behind him. And warmer still for the peace beating within his heart.
Wiggins closes his eyes to think, but as that makes him sway backwards, he snaps his eyes open again immediately.
?” John is directly in front of him now, looking him up and down and no doubt considering his options on how he can get rid of Sherlock’s ‘public school’ persona so he will dance with him.
“If I must.” he says, before leaning down to snort the line.
“Can I hug you?”
“Okay. I will then.”
and chuck the Christmas dinner all over the floor.
Sherlock always seemed to get like this when John told him he loved him. Even though he’d been saying it multiple times a day for these past four months, as if his lips couldn’t say it enough. Ever since that first day... the one where there had been too close a call on Sherlock’s part, a bullet speeding past, taking a chunk out of his Belstaff, but luckily leaving Sherlock with nothing but a graze. John had decided he couldn’t contain it anymore. Couldn’t risk Sherlock never getting the chance to hear John say those words. And so he’d just said them. Right there and then, while Sherlock sat grumbling on the back bumper of the ambulance. They hadn’t been alone, but John had said it anyways. In front of the EMT. In front of Greg. Hell, even Sally Donovan and Anderson were there. Sherlock had given him this almost quizzical look, and then smiled in a way John hadn’t before seen. And so John decided he’d just keep on saying it.
The cigarettes were the only thing lifting his spirits—the slight amount that they were—and he knew in his heart of hearts, that if he’d been given the opportunity for anything harder, he would have taken it without a second thought. Luckily or not, his lethargy has kept him from venturing out and doing so.
“I’m fairly certain ‘Right’ is not a designation that one can apply to their relationship with another. Well, not solely that, at least.”
The song that inspired the title of this fic was 'Novocaine For The Soul' by the Eels.
Sherlock takes a breath, ready to protest, but stops himself. This could be a treasure trove of useful data to add to his other spreadsheet, the one about John. It’s called ‘Is he or isn’t he?’ though he’s thinking about changing the title to ‘Are we or aren’t we?’. Of course this is all on Sherlock’s laptop, password protected and encrypted to make even Mycroft’s most prominent hackers break a sweat just looking at the firewalls.
John turns around and smiles up at him.
Sherlock can hear further footsteps, heading towards the bedroom from the hall. They are calculated, aggressive stomps of feet.
They decided against a cab, as the mall wasn’t too far off from Baker Street--and isn’t that just lovely? Seeing as they’d both received a lifetime ban from the place. The silence lasted a good ten minutes into their walk home when Sherlock couldn’t contain himself anymore.
and so he gets up and stalks away towards his room.
“I just need one hit.” Sherlock suddenly finds himself pleading. “...
Sherlock turns his head to the side, curious. “And what?”
Sherlock pursed his lips. “Alright, perhaps that part was a bit not good.”
“I’ll blow you when we get back?” John offered.
“That’s the idea, Love.” she said, shutting the door.
“I’d like to kiss you.” and this comes out breathless.
Sherlock bit his lips for a moment, and John thought they’d walk in silence until they reached their flat.
Sherlock let’s him, if only because he’s shocked at the other man’s gall. You don’t just take someone’s
Sherlock scoffs. Takes a drink.
~The End~
. And that in turn was
“Yeah. From behind, don’t worry.”
“Jesus!” John screams, reaching for Sherlock and pulling him back inside.
A yawn bursts from John. He moves so his forehead is resting on Sherlock’s shoulder instead so he can indulge in the forced intake of air. Sherlock feels the urge to yawn himself, but manages to keep it inside.
“What if this
He winces at himself for even thinking that, but finds himself smiling all the same.
“John, help me with him!” Sherlock grunted as Santa landed a solid blow to his solar plexus.
“Yes, well... “ Sherlock clears his perpetually blocked throat. “This sort of thing… I mean… Is it… okay?” Sherlock shakes his head at his own stupidity. '
The sound of fabric shifting let’s Sherlock know John has just shrugged.
“What is it you want?” Sherlock manages eventually, though his voice is tired and slow.
John worries his bottom lip in contemplation. A red flush comes to his face, that Sherlock doesn’t think has anything to do with the whiskey. And his breaths are coming faster and faster. When he looks at Sherlock his pupils are blown wide.
“No, I’m not. But I am your friend. Am I’m--”
“Goodnight.” Sherlock says distractedly. He’s trying to fill out a spreadsheet with every CAS number he could remember. So far he’s at three-hundred and twenty-six, and showing no signs of stopping anytime soon.
John and Sherlock have some things to sort out.
John is silent for a moment.
They were in Glasgow, an interesting murder-suicide gone just murder. They’d caught the killer. The local PD having thanked Sherlock profusely. He should’ve preened in the acknowledgment. He should have glowed from the praise. Beamed at the recognition of his talents. He and John should be eating take-out together now, laughing about this and that, about nothing in particular. But instead…
“Can I ask why? What’s got you so distracted lately?” he seems concerned.
“Could replace the deerstalker.”
John huffs out an amused breath through his nose.
John pretended to think it over. “That would be quite mad, wouldn’t it?” he looked up at Sherlock, smiled. “I’m actually starving. Where were you thinking?”
“John, look at me.”
“I already told you I like it. Sleeping with you.”
“Just worried ‘bout you, Love.” John gives him a watery smile. “That’s all.”
If Lestrade hadn’t shown up when he did, he was fairly certain there would have been a riot as people rushed forward to throttle the man who’d just ruined everyone’s Christmas.
There was a soliloquy that Sherlock wanted, no, needed to spout at his skull in this moment, but found the words evaporating the moment they entered his mind.
Mrs. Hudson had just finished smoking the last of her herbal soothers for that night, when there was a knock on the door.
“They’re his holiday decorations.” John smiled up at his fiance.
Sherlock looks to John and sees that the man is dead serious. And, possibly, supremely aroused, going by his labored breathing and the fact that his eyes are nearly entirely black, pupils blown so wide that the color of his iris is only a thin ring around them.
“Deal!” he snatched the antlers from John’s hands.
Come morning time, Sherlock will tell himself it was nothing but a dream. Straight men do not, as a rule, enter into relationships with gay men. Or did John think he meant… a what? Platonic relationship? Wasn’t that just called friends? Hadn't they already established that that’s what they were?! And so Sherlock will bury himself in the morning newspaper and refuse to make eye-contact with John. Even though he will be supremely aware of John’s eyes being a near constant presence on him.
Sherlock tries to unlock his phone but the screen stubbornly remains black.
Every time Sherlock finds a way of showing John that his help is both useless and unwanted—including tossing the pack of nicotine patches he’d gone and bought out the window and into the rain.
John looks back down to his glass, sucks in a deep breath.
“You sent me the address, Love.” He’s trying to get Sherlock to sit up, hands urging his body to move.
There’s a reply but Sherlock can’t read it for the life of him. He focuses very, very hard on the keyboard in front of him.
Sherlock has no answer to that. Because of course John had initiated the embrace. But Sherlock was still at such a loss as to whether this situation was one on a strictly platonic level, or if they were delving into something...deeper. More… Well, Sherlock
He pauses.
“Because it’s hardly as if I can make it across the room in this state, let alone out of the flat to--”
I get better’.
If only Sherlock were a runner, but then again, no. Running is terrible on the joints, risk of injury far too great. One case of shin splints and he’d be unable to chase after criminals for months! The idea is unfathomable.
“What did you mean that you’d stay, but only if I wanted you to?”
“What?!” Sherlock finally shouts when John doesn’t continue.
“No.” John says very seriously, pointing Sherlock’s phone at him.
Sherlock supposes he’d been through this enough times with the rest of the lot to have expected this, though he was always shocked anew each time. But... John had never seen him through a relapse before. Or a detox. And yet here he was. Still by Sherlock’s side. Still, to the supreme shock of Sherlock, sleeping in his bed with him. Sherlock had never got such powerful, deep, or frequent, sleep in his life. He was compelled to bed each night by the promise of John’s warm embrace. By his accepting presence.
“I’m going to go make breakfast.” he says, squeezing Sherlock’s shoulder as he lets go of him. “Want anything in particular?” he asks over his shoulder as he heads into the kitchen.
“It’s just I'm,” he bites his lips, gives Sherlock a searching look. “I’m kind of terrified with how you might respond.”
As John handled the still kicking and spitting Santa, Sherlock stood up, suavely dusting off his coat, and then noticed the small audience that had gathered.
Going by John’s behavior, he was prone to think that he and John were becoming… romantic partners? Was that the term? Nevertheless, John had changed they way he acted around Sherlock and reacted to him as well.
“W--Wi--” Sherlock tries to call out for Wiggins, but the music is far too loud, even if he could manage to say the man’s name.
“Endearing.”
He’s pacing the floors of the flat. Back and forth and back again. Every step one of exaggerated agony, but the thought of staying still is terrifying. He’d have an aneurysm, he’s sure, if he were to stop his movements.
“And I’d like to feed you up. Put some meat on that skinny arse of yours.” he’s smiling now, and it looks less painful.
Perhaps Sherlock had taken a
“When I get better...What---what will happen?”
“We’ll be through the thick of it soon.” John says.
It’s not as if he hadn’t been expecting this, over the last few days as his constitution improved. John was just sticking around out of some Doctorly duty. Sherlock had finally pushed him too far this time. Finally showed John his full hand. And John was disturbed, disgusted. John wanted to leave. And so he finally had.
“I told you it was fine that first night at Angelo's. It’s all fine, Sherlock.”

-----
Sherlock had been waiting for this--John and him together in this way--to become mixed and blurred with the grey sameness of everything else. But this alone had stayed his.
Sherlock swallows.
“What in
But Sherlock doesn’t want to ‘just try it’. He wants to meditatively walk this room in a circle until he’s worn a path in the rug. He turns to leave, and that’s when it happens.
“You can stay. If you want.” he looks over his shoulder to see John smiling at him.
“You’re not actually going to keep wearing that hat are you?”
“And when you say date…?” Sherlock raises his brows.
He lights up another.
. Just as evenly as they knew that Sherlock, in all probability, was rather ‘gay’.
“But why would I want that?”
She opened the door, knowing who it would be before she did. “Could have sent a text down saying that they’d be late.” she said under her breath before the door swung open.
John retracts his hand from Sherlock’s, rubs it along Sherlock’s arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
A Black Mood hits Sherlock. John tries to lift his spirits a little.
“You think?” Sherlock moves his head as if he hadn’t heard John.
He sits up on the side of the bed and then just stares at his wardrobe for a while. Feeling broken and defeated, in a way that has nothing to do with his recent drugs binge. He already feels the impulse to ring up Wiggins. He’ll give it a few weeks, at least. Knowing Lestrade won’t give him a case if he tests positive for anything. And annoying aware that John and Mycroft would’ve told him about this latest relapse.
John swirled his whiskey around anxiously, staring at the amber liquid as he did so. Sherlock just stared at him, his own drink untouched. John, however, had filled his glass twice now. If Sherlock didn’t start soon he feared John would be too inebriated to get any real answers out of. But how to begin?
“In fact.” he started up again. “Santa is not real at all. He's just a lie your parents tell you to get you to behave in the months leading up to Christmas. Which, in itself, is nothing more than a grand marketing scheme and the most successful consumerist propaganda to ever take the world by storm. Though based on more wholesome traditions--well, some of them are--the overall agenda seems to be getting people to buy things they don't need for people they don't like. And to force families who despise each other to sit around a table, staring at a Christmas pudding, saying nothing of import so someone doesn't
“Well…” Sherlock feels his own breathing pick up. Feels his flush deepen even further. He must look near crimson by now. John’s words strike a chord somewhere deep in Sherlock’s gut. They make that light feeling in his chest, and the electric feeling in his stomach, much, much worse. He swallows roughly. “That would be new, wouldn't it?”
It makes something throb painfully inside Sherlock, and so he grips John’s hand tighter to compensate.
“I—never left,” Sherlock answers dubiously.
At the door John finally releases Sherlock and goes for his bed, pulling back the blanket and sheet, as if this were some posh hotel and John was a merry maid.
“No, I know. I--” he swallows. Nods again. “I would like to date you, Sherlock Holmes.”
John was being supremely annoying. In that he was being supremely
. Because of course it should be good that Sherlock is feeling better. Of course... But Sherlock feels as though he must answer all the same. The only problem being that he doesn’t know how.
“Tea?” John is in front of him again, holding out a mug.
“Okay.” John says with a smirk, resuming his incessant typing.
------
“I took down a suspect, and yes, he was dressed as Father Christmas, but I hardly think--”
The snow continued to fall outside, completely unaware of the two men it had brought together that night to watch its slow descent, and of all the people around London who had come to stare out their windows at its beautiful flurry.
“At least pretend to focus, Love.” John coughs, eyeing the crime-scene techs who were shooting them dirty looks.
“Oh, GOD!” Sherlock shouts in frustration, slamming his skull down, perhaps a little too hard, on the desk.
And I was listening to 'Friday I'm In Love' by The Cure when I wrote the end. Def give that last song a listen if you haven't already. The lyrics are very Johnlock, and very perfect for this particular fic.
As often happens, a drastic upswing follows Sherlock’s downed spirits. One day he wakes, revitalized and energized. Almost uncomfortably so. As if he is hooked up to some machine, being shocked, sparks zinging out across his nervous system, setting him alight.
“Didnooot” Sherlock scrunches up his face in discomfort. “Stoppit.”
“Perfect.” John smiles up at him.
John is there. In his chair. Reading a newspaper.
During the case, Sherlock had barely slept. And when he had, it had always been on the couch, or in the bed when John was not there, as John had taken to sleeping in Sherlock’s bed over the past few months, due to Sherlock’s constant need for his contact. Sherlock didn’t want to kick John from his bed. But he also did not want to join him there.
John is saying something to him but he can’t hear. Music far too loud.
was that?!” John gasps harshly, still breathing heavily from adrenaline.
“Oh.” Sherlock gasps as he walks into the sitting room.
It's tedious for absolutely everyone involved. Like you parents, you don't
“But I don’t need it anymore. I’m not in an episode.” Sherlock has gone very quiet for some reason, and can’t seem to raise his voice. Suddenly every word he speaks seems amplified ten-fold in the small space of the bedroom, and he can feel them reverberating off the walls and crashing back into him.
“Don’t say things like that.” John chastises, but then his face relaxes. He looks supremely vulnerable. He looks away. “If it helps any, I don’t know what it is we’re doing either.”
“I don’t know. Maybe because it’s nice.”
“Sherlock.” John laughed.
“Not okay?” he asks, worry evident in his voice. “Something wrong?”
-----
He’s been awake for seventy-four hours. They’d solved the case five hours ago. Ever since Sherlock has been sitting on his hotel bed, staring at the blank wall across from him.
But John was not gay.
“It’s been three days. Time for bed.” John shakes his hand a little to emphasis.
“That is--wait, how did you know?” Sherlock turns his head to the side so he can see John once more. The other man is smiling softly. He shrugs his shoulders again.
John pauses.
“Who--?”
“Feeling better?” he asks quietly.
“So I can take you to bed.”
“Just exactly that.” John chuckles. Sherlock is grateful that he doesn’t make to come back into Sherlock’s field of vision. In fact, he’s fairly certain John has his back to him as well. What an odd way to carry on a conversation. Also how brilliant. This way, Sherlock can’t get overwhelmed and ruin things. “I’ll stay,” he says, “But only if you want me to.”
“It’s alright, Love. It’s alright. Shh, shhh. That’s it. You’re awake now. S’alright.” John is brushing the sweat-matted hair away from Sherlock’s forehead, petting his face and hair. Shushing him and soothing him until Sherlock finally begins to settle.
The song that inspired this chapter was 'Everything' by Alanis Morissette.
The little yelps get louder, ‘til someone is bursting through the bedroom door. They don’t go for Sherlock, but instead go straight past the mattress he’s laying on and make for the window. He can hear them struggling with it before they finally get it open.
John shakes his head and bites his lips. He looks in severe pain.
“Insufferable.” Sherlock grumbles, miffed at having to look around for the drugs himself.
Suddenly, a hand on his shoulder, not making to pull Sherlock to face him, but just resting, just testing out this new territory. When Sherlock doesn’t make to buck him off, John scoots closer, crowding in behind him and wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s side.
The door to the flat opens, John comes in, talking about how silly it was for him to forget his umbrella. That you’d think after five days he’d get the hint. Sherlock knows the exact moment he notices him because he stops his mundane rambling.
“Al-right.” Sherlock says jiltedly, snapping the laptop shut and then taking John’s hand.
Sherlock looks up at the ceiling, letting out a frustrated sigh.
The first thing he notices is that sound is back on—a fire truck races by, birds sing from somewhere, and the everyday white noise of Baker Street floats in from the open window.
He didn’t hear the violin as he walked down the hall--the usual sign that Sherlock wasn’t having such a good night--and instead was met by an increasing chill.
“I--” Sherlock starts as he follows John into the kitchen.
“Not hungry.”
Though he’s certain John is asleep, his slumbering body still grips Sherlock tighter, unconscious mind apparently happy at hearing those words.
Most of that went over the kids heads, parents too. But the part about Santa being a lie and Christmas being 'bad' seemed to stick.
There are hands on him. Sherlock grunts in protest, “No.” he manages feebly.
Wiggins has passed out next to him on the futon mattress they have pressed up against the wall as a make-shift couch.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes… “ Sherlock says in lieu of anything else.
John shrugs again, both his shoulders and his lower lip. His grip on his glass tightens. “Kind of teetering on the line, I think.”
. How dare John stump him? HIM, Sherlock Holmes! The world’s greatest Consulting Detective. No, the world’s
“Wait, hang on!” John marches over, ripping Sherlock’s phone from his fingers. “You are not getting anyone else to buy your drugs for you either.”
“Sherlock,” and John’s voice is a wreck. “I need you, Sherlock. I do.” He swallows. “I don’t know what happened today, and I won’t ask. Not now, at least. But, I--I just need you to know that--that--” and then through gritted teeth, breathed more than spoken, “
Sherlock frowned deeply, looking very put upon. John chuckled right alongside her.
“I can’t dance.”
“Don’t worry about me.” Sherlock scrunches his brow up in further confusion. “M'fine.”
“That I’d sleep here tonight. Next to you. If you wanted.” The timbre of his voice has changed from that airy, happy-go-lucky cadence it had been stuck in near all day, and into something much more serious.
John looks up, eyes wide.
have me all to yourself.”
John is frozen for a moment before turning his head to the side, a look of angry disbelief on his face. “You cannot be serious.”
“Nothing.” John bites his lips to hide his smile.
It was raining again.
“Cigarettes? You’ve got a whole pack there on the table.”
“What do you need?”
“Oh.” John’s mouth does another strange contortion, sucking on his teeth, no doubt. “I guess that has been left a little vague lately, hasn’t it?” He looks up, almost as though he’s hopeful. Though definitely still uncomfortable. And apprehensive.
It starts with John rolling his shoulder. Then lifting his head up to crack his neck. Then he attempts to roll his other shoulder, the one pressed into the floor. The man sounded like poprocks in one’s mouth. Sherlock feels the need to take pity on him.
Oh, so he’s mad now? Good! At least Sherlock won’t be alone anymore.
“Where’s my skull!” Sherlock yells into the empty flat.
“Shh, shh, Love. It’s me. It’s me. It’s John. I’m here, Love. It’s fine. It’s John.”
John sighed, closing his eyes, but looking over at Sherlock despite wanting to give him the cold shoulder ‘til Christmas come. He opened his eyes again to start in on Sherlock and how he could stop being a prick, at least for the holidays. But when he actually looked at the detective he was stopped in his tracks.
“Answer me, Sherlock.”
It could never work! Sherlock knew this, he reminded himself of it constantly. And yet…
‘Damn my brain!’ Sherlock curses, ‘Function within stated parameters or cease to function entirely!’ He threatens himself.
John had a moment where he thought of taking off the hat and stuffing it into his pocket, but decided against it. Instead he pushed the hat back a little, so he could at least see where he was going, and then kept calm and carried on.
“Sherlock,” John scoffs. “What--no! No, you cannot just ‘have one hit’! What--why would you even ask that!”
Sherlock’s skin is itching. He’s a live-wire. Everything around him is too much, every sense, every thought.
And though John had said it many times that night before he’d finally succumbed to his exertions, Sherlock hadn’t been able to respond, too caught up in the sweet rapture and newness of everything. He thinks, now that John is asleep, he may just be able to say it. Speak the words aloud. For the first time in his life. To anyone.
.” He squeezes Sherlock until it should have been painful, as if he were trying to meld their two bodies into one, “Do you know what would happen to me if I’d lost you?” he sniffs, presses his forehead to the top of Sherlock’s spine, and Sherlock can feel tears there. “I can’t lose you. You understand? I won’t.” And this last part is said as a firm promise.
John tried, he really did, but ended up giggling away at Sherlock and the red and white hat precariously balanced on top of his curls. Sherlock joined in with a low-pitched chuckle that seemed to rumble about his chest cavity rather than coming out as normal laughter. John could feel it when their arms brushed against each other as they walked.
Sherlock’s eyes widened with interest.
“How long have we been up for?”
“Yes, perfectly,” Sherlock lies.
How many times had John shouted it at others, even Sherlock himself? John was not gay. He wasn’t. Everyone
“Need something?” John asks. He’s sitting in a chair across from the couch--where Sherlock sits, pondering--and had his bare feet up on the coffee table, laptop propped up on his knees, typing away--no doubt about their latest case. He’s smiling over at Sherlock and Sherlock can barely take it. It’s all so domestic, so cheery, so...well, God, he wasn’t going to say
Sherlock does not answer, and instead buries his head further in his pillow.
“I honestly can’t tell if your saying this to me because you want me to stop you or if you’re really just that far gone.”
.” Sherlock barely manages to force out. The word issued in a gust of air as if he’d just had all the wind knocked from him.
Sherlock waits.
Like a bird leaving offerings to a potential mate, or a pagan leaving offerings to a God, John continues to bring Sherlock things, attempting to change his black mood.
“John.”
Good enough.
“Yes.” John said brightly, just as Sherlock gave a resounding “No.”
John is taken aback by that, Sherlock’s unspoken words ringing loudly in the small confines of the flat. John clears his throat, looking off to the side before his eyes settle on the floor in front of Sherlock’s chair.
Fifth day in a row that the heavens had opened up and drenched London’s streets with its wrath.
The rain had stopped at some point, and a calm silence had fallen over Baker Street.
It’s not really a question, even if it is posed as one.
After a little while he’s back, setting a fresh cup of tea down by Sherlock.
“Pfft!”
they to each other?
“You.” he says. Shakes his head. “And this.” He screws his eyes shut in frustration. “
Sherlock thinks he may have had a minor mental break.
“Sherl, c’mere.”
John looks worried, but Sherlock is about ninety-six percent sure he is about to faint, and so can’t find it in himself to care overly much at the moment.
“C’mon, that’s it.”
“That was days ago, sir.” Wiggins replies, trying to hand Sherlock a syringe. Sherlock scoffs and waves him off. “Sorry, sir. Forgot you don’t share.”
He’s also talking about something, but he’d long ago decided to ignore his mouth. It was just a floodgate, everything unable to be contained in his mind-palace spilling forth in a string of nonsense that not even he can untangle.
Fingers card through Sherlock’s curls at the back of his head as he snorts the line, and then, with a fist of Sherlock’s hair, he wrenches Sherlock’s head back violently. The feeling of cocaine being absorbed into his system and the sharp pull have Sherlock making a wretched sound as he falls to his knees, hair still firm in Seb’s fist.
“You’re still here.” is all he can manage to say, and lamely at that.
Sherlock 24:02
“No, that doesn’t help.” Sherlock blinks at John’s stupidity. “In fact that’s supremely unhelpful.”
John laughed, finding his partner’s expression quite adorable. “I love you,” he whispered into the closing distance between them.
They looked at each other, a battle of wills.
John sets his glass down on the end table next to him. Leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees, hands clasped together.
John leans down until he can put his chin on Sherlock’s shoulder, “Well that’s good, isn’t it?”
A case comes, as one always does. And then another. And another.
“You think?” John asked with heavy sarcasm.
Sherlock's Black Mood vanishes as quickly as it had come. But where does this leave the new development in John and Sherlock's relationship?
Sherlock’s vision clears a bit, and he can see him now, sitting on the edge of the dirty mattress, legs tangled up on the disgusting floor. He’s got one arm under Sherlock, supporting and raising him up off the bed, so Sherlock instead lays more in John’s lap and not that filthy, filthy mattress. And there are tears rolling down his face. Sherlock raises up an unsteady hand to touch them, see if the tears are real.
So in lieu of answer, Sherlock snatches up his pajamas that John had laid out for him, and heads towards his connected bathroom. Though he pauses at the door.
“Do you want to be? Dating, that is.”
“Would you like that?” asks in a rough voice. Husky and dark, and filled with so much promise.
“It was forty-five minutes.”
Sherlock can’t fathom the need for sex when he can’t feel the majority of his body, but he knows that tone and the look Sebastian’s giving him. He sighs internally before nodding as much as Seb’s hold on him will allow.
Sherlock stares at him for a moment, at a loss for words, before deciding he doesn’t have to deal with this
Sherlock shakes his head, to clear out his brothers interfering voice.
“But… I’m not tired?”
Even after that night in Glasgow, Sherlock had still remained uncertain of where John and he sat with each other. They were not dating, at least not to Sherlock’s knowledge. Yet John spent more time in Sherlock’s bed than he had any of his endless string of girlfriends. Only, funnily enough, that string had ended. Snapped. Ever since that night with the rain and the window. John hadn’t been seeing anyone at the time and then had simply not seen anyone afterwards. Had he been too caught up with helping keep Sherlock’s black mood under control that he hadn’t been able to seek out the next girl in line?
to be up.
“Scared.” John finishes quietly.
Thank God. Sherlock doesn’t think he’d be able to stomach John starting in on the questions just this moment--or ever, if he is being truly honest with himself. But he knows John will ask his questions at some point, for he can feel the need for answers burning in John, radiating outward from his chest and warming Sherlock’s back with it’s hateful heat from where they are pressed together.
Sherlock grabs the hand that settles on his stomach and holds it tightly, needing to hold on to something, anything really, to help ease this tempest inside that's tearing him apart. Any port in a storm. And today that port was John.
Sherlock wakes to complete darkness with a strangled gasp. He doesn’t know what he had been dreaming of, or if he’d even been dreaming at all. All he knows is that his heart now hammers painfully inside his chest, and his breaths come as harsh gasps. His body shakes from head to toe, and he is covered in a fine sheen of cold sweat.
He can hear the springs of John’s own hotel bed creak as he lifts himself off them. Then he can feel the bed dip as John joins Sherlock on his. It is not long before that now familiar warm presence is behind him once more. The only balm he’d found to comfort his soul.
Sherlock stares up at the ceiling, laid out spread eagle and feeling a lovely sluggishness pulse through his veins, enveloping him in a warm, comforting embrace. Though all he can manage to ‘ponder’ on is John. Where he’s at. If he’s worried about him. If he’s mad at him. This won’t do
“Would you say that you're too mad to go and grab takeout with me?” Sherlock asked, nudging John with his elbow.
“What have we got today?” Sherlock asks, scratching at his neck as he goes to look over Wiggins shoulder.
“Do you… like it?” he asks so, so quietly he worries John wasn’t able to hear him.
Lestrade had called after them, but they’d ignored him. They knew this song and dance. Knew they’d just come in tomorrow morning and fill out their reports. It was just a habit of Lestrade’s to insist they immediately come down to the Yard after they finished a case.
If it came right down to it, and one was forced to decide, Sherlock preferred men vastly over women. In fact, he preferred men entirely.
“I do, yeah.”
“What are you doing? Why are you holding out your hand like that?” Sherlock asks, beyond confused.
“What are you--” John cut himself off as the white puff-ball swung into view.
“What if I never want it to stop?”
The song that inspired this chapter was 'Heart-Shaped Box' by Nirvana.
“Point being?”
Consulting Detective. Yes, that was it.
“I’m fine with it, Sherlock. As I said. All of it. It’s whatever you need. Or want.” John finally replies. His voice is not reproachful, a little put upon, perhaps, but holding no ill will towards Sherlock.
A case in Glasgow brings the boys closer together.
“Are we dating?” Sherlock asks.
he thinks to himself in a voice that sounds far too much like Mycroft for his liking.
