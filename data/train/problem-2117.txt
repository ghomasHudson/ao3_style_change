“Why now?” Sherlock’s mind was whirling with plans to try and get that bottle out of the man’s hand. He needed to distract him and keep him talking for as long as possible. “You said it yourself, it’s been four years. What happened that made you take action now?” The police backup and the paramedics had arrived, standing behind the pair of them and watching the stand off. Morgan straightened his spine and met Sherlock’s eyes defiantly, a movement that reminded the detective strongly of John.
“It wouldn’t be Callahan’s rights that would be infringed, it’ll be the complainants. Leave it with me, I’ll get what I can.” Greg replied as he opened the fridge. “Beer, juice and not much else in here.”
Sherlock’s mind finished John’s sentence for him. The detective leaned forward, placing his hand over John’s, the one that wasn’t holding the gun. He squeezed it, trying to convey to him that Sherlock didn’t think feeling overwhelmed was being pathetic, that he’d never think that of him.
There came a sudden knock on the door and Jonathan looked over to his wife, who turned to go and answer it. Sherlock waited until he heard the door open and the sound of voices, leaning forward ready to press his suspect with all the flair he possessed.
“Yes, well, the only thing I regret about my impromptu press statement is it’s likely to fuel the rumours again. It doesn’t bother me any but you’re going to have to start insisting you’re straight again like you always did before.” The detective stated as the waitress came back with their plates, placing the food down in front of them before retreating.
hiding enough sleeping tablets to kill a shire horse in a box filled with clothes? I tripped and heard something rattling and last time I checked fabric doesn’t rattle! Where did you get these? When did you get these?” Sherlock was glaring at John for all he was worth, clearly not about to let this go without some sort of explanation.
“I hate journalists so much, god damn vultures!” He growled as he attempted to take his coat off and failed, Greg helped him again without a word as Mrs Hudson came out of her flat to see what all the noise was about.
“Not the best but it’s not like we’ll be spending much time in here.” John commented as they walked in, there were two single beds on either side of the small room and a tiny ensuite. John put his rucksack into a small wardrobe, not bothering to unpack properly. “Right, let’s get to work then. Text me when you’re done and I’ll do the same.”
“Thanks for the tea, I appreciate it.” John picked up his mug, blew on it before taking a small sip. Sherlock could practically see the tension in John’s face bleed away as he relaxed. “So, what did you want to talk to me about then?” The detective had picked up his own cup in the meantime, clearing his throat nervously before he spoke.
“Ravenous, actually. That smells amazing, I had no idea that you could cook.” John pulled out a chair and sat down, normally if anyone was making a meal it was John. He wasn’t a natural chef, but the army had taught him enough to make a few really filling dishes, he rotated through them and practice had perfected his execution.
“Hello…” There was a pause where the Sergeant considered adding another word but evidently decided against it. Sherlock raised a curious eyebrow, intrigued for a moment.
“Alright, don’t need to recreate the scene that thoroughly, mate!” He grabbed Sherlock by the arm and dragged him back. “Especially when you’ve just pointed out that the ground can give way at the edges.” Sherlock huffed and rolled his eyes at him but obediently stepped away. He knelt down by the tracks again and measured the second pair with a tape measure.
“Not even password protected. He clearly never lets anyone come into this flat, otherwise he’d have some sort of security in place.” Sherlock commented as Greg opened and closed the wardrobe, not finding anything interesting in there. It was mostly fatigues, formal dress uniforms and some casual clothes. “Harvey Callahan’s web bookmarks, we’ll start with the top one. He’s a member of ACAS – the Aged Cheese Appreciation Society. He logs on every day and spends a lot of time on their forums, so it seems.”
“It was no bother, lad, from what I’ve seen you obviously work hard, making an honest living so I was glad to help. I remembered you from the papers, I just hoped that you still lived here and luckily you did.” The voice was deep with an edge of a Yorkshire accent. Mrs Hudson went to her fridge and opened it, pulling out the carrier bags.
“I used to be able to do fifty reps of everything and run a good ten miles every couple of weeks. It’ll take me some time to get back to those numbers but I’ll get there.” John kept his eyes forward as he worked his abdominal muscles, not sure why Sherlock was still standing there.
Another casualty was brought in by ambulance and John moved to help the paramedics transfer the young woman from the gurney to the bed. The gas explosion must have been huge because the injured just kept on coming. He knew it had been in an apartment building and that patients were being sent to every capable A&E in the area but other than that, he had no details. John just concentrated on each emergency that rolled through the doors.
“John! What’s wrong? …You said that Falcon only winded you!” Sherlock was crouched down and hissing in his ear, the doctor could hear Greg radioing for an ambulance before the inspector got to the floor on John’s other side to help lay him down.
“Yes, Mummy is absolutely smitten with you.” They were both on the good side of buzzed, not having drunk enough to completely lose their inhibitions. “You were right, they didn’t care about what you were wearing in the slightest. I’m sorry for everything, I just wanted you all to get along so badly that I lost sight of what was important.” Sherlock pressed a gentle kiss against John’s temple and felt John give him an answering squeeze.
“But now they’ve passed away, you’re no longer getting Carer’s Allowance for looking after them. Plus any grants you’ve been getting from charities would have stopped too, I’d imagine. So instead of looking for an honest job, you’ve come up with a frankly ludicrous scheme to extort people for money by kidnapping their loved ones and storing them in the cellar of your own house, you idiotic prat!” John was watching as the man tensed up incrementally with every word he said.
When Sherlock and John arrived at the crime scene in a black cab, DI Lestrade was outside on the pavement waiting for them, holding an umbrella to protect himself from the dank mid-afternoon drizzle.
“I grazed them earlier, they are fine though. I’d actually forgot all about them until you mentioned it.” John flushed again, unwilling to explain to Sherlock’s parents that he’d climbed out of a third storey window and slid down a drainpipe rather than wear the suit Sherlock had picked out for him.
“My what?! Those are private, you wanker!” John stalked towards him, pausing in the doorway that separated the two rooms as he made a conscious effort to control his temper. Sherlock watched him mentally counting to ten, get to five, give up and snap. “WHY do you have my medical records?”
“I’ve only been looking at the screen for 2.4 seconds and I’ve already spotted fourteen ridiculous inaccuracies.” Sherlock commented dryly making John snigger into his hand. But in the next instant, he forgot all about the tv show. The reason? Sherlock had stretched to lay his arm along the back of the couch behind the doctor’s shoulders.
“What was all that about?” The doctor asked in confusion once he was back alongside the detective. He could still feel that his cheeks were a little warm. He spotted a café and grabbed hold of Sherlock’s arm with one hand and pointed with the other. “Let’s go there, I’m starving!”
“I honestly don’t think there’s a word to describe how I’m feeling right now.” John replied as he allowed Sherlock to tug on his arm to get him to stand, leading him into the kitchen, sitting him on a stool while he went to prepare some tea.
“Wow, Doc, you’re 100% spot on, well done! Does that mean we are looking for a killer who is blind?” The Detective Inspector asked as John finally stood up, having finished his examination of the body. He stepped back to let his flatmate do his own study.
“How easy do you think it would be to get our victim’s service record?” Sherlock asked as they walked in, he slowly cast his eyes around. The flat was very neat and tidy, something that was pretty typical of those in the military. The shoes by the door were all in the same size which meant that the victim lived alone.
“Hello there, I’m here to speak to Jonathan Price, it’s regarding the death of an employee of his, Holly Walters?” Ever since the failed bluff with Dr Chen, Sherlock was much more careful about possibly introducing an alias until he had some idea whether he’d been recognised or not.
“I brought it for you, to thank you for what you did while I was… away.” Sherlock was chewing on his bottom lip and his restless hands were fiddling with the hem of his suit jacket in anxiety. “Mycroft told me about your campaign and showed me a recording of the press conference you gave. I can only imagine the amount of time and effort you put in to clearing my name, case by case.”
“Fine, alright. But you are planning to move back upstairs, aren’t you?” The detective replied begrudgingly, he could cope with his assistant having another job.
Mr Holmes the younger didn’t quite fill out the suit the way he used to. Mycroft knew that home comforts like a good meal and warm bed were often missing from Sherlock’s recent life, never mind the finer things like music, relaxation and conversation. Still, the job was done very well and his little brother was finally back on British soil.
“Indeed, they haven’t. However, we’ve both recently been introduced to a new school of thought regarding the advantages of emotions. As Brecht also said
“Dr Watson is an indispensable part of what I do, so it would be rather nice if the press and the media didn’t refer to him as an afterthought all the time. My success rates would invariably be lower without him, if only for the simple reason he saves my life on a regular basis so I can keep on solving crimes.” John bit the inside of his cheek in the hopes of preventing a blush from flooding his face, he wasn’t used to being the centre of attention like this.
“Yes. I did say that… and I meant it when I said it. But things have changed since that night. I refuse to believe that you don’t know how much I care about you. You’re my best friend, I’d die for you, I’d kill for you, it’s no longer my Work, it’s
“Do you know the one thing you used to do that I hated more than anything else, hmm? It was when you asked for my views or opinions on something, only to turn around and humiliate me by showing me how stupid I am compared to you.” John raised his hand to forestall the detective interrupting him. “No, Sherlock, ‘Don’t be upset, John, practically everyone is an idiot.’ isn’t as much of a comfort as you seem to think it is.”
“2nd Lt Callahan was well liked by the recruits; he had a talent for being able to draw out the more withdrawn lads and help them reach their full potential.” Deakins shifted in his chair and looked down at his desk. “That said, I am led to believe that in the past, there have been… instances, shall we say, where he has allowed himself to become too close to individual cadets. It is my understanding that he decided to step back from teaching wrestling to help avoid any appearances of inappropriate behaviour.”
“Still say it’s the most beautiful country I’ve ever been to. Wish I had taken more time to appreciate it while I could.” John saw an understanding flick at the corner of the detective’s mouth, neither of them had been able to bask in the pleasure of the scenery on either of their campaigns abroad.
As John finally managed to get to the end of his panic induced rambling, he closed his eyes for a moment to take a calming breath.
“You know what I don’t get? It’s why some people have kids if they aren’t going to show any interest in actually raising them right or being a part of their lives. I was in university before I realised that normally parents prepare and cook meals for their kids beyond the age of ten. Don’t get me wrong, there was always plenty of food in the house, me and Harry were just expected to feed ourselves if we were hungry.” John stared into his cup so he didn’t have to look at Sherlock’s face.
“Nope, don’t actually have a clue what you are talking about there, Sherlock… I’m going to turn in early, I’m still tired. Goodnight, or good afternoon I should say.” John laughed awkwardly and turned away, intending to flee up into his room. He grabbed the handle of the kitchen door to pull it open, an arm appeared from over his head to hold it closed.
“Do we have to? I’ve only just got the splint off from the last time we spoke.” John looked at the detective expectantly, but at getting no response, he sighed heavily. “Fine. Just let me put these away and get a shower, I’ve got eight hours of hospital ick on me. Make a cup of tea if you want to be helpful.” The doctor walked into the kitchen and quickly unpacked his bags before heading into his room to grab a change of clothes before going into the bathroom.
“Lead you astray? I think that ship has long since sailed, John.” Sherlock was grinning and his eyes were filled with warmth and fondness. John made a show of tilting his head to the side and considering that statement in mock seriousness before nodding.
“Well, you know me. The ends justify the means, remember?” Sherlock answered before he felt a crash of comprehension threatening to rip his mind apart. “Oh God, John, I- I finally understand, oh God, I’m so sorry!” The DI gently pulled Sherlock back as the paramedics fitted John with a neck collar and backboard. They transferred him to a stretcher and rushed him to the waiting ambulance.
:: Sorry. I had a bad allergic reaction earlier and he got a little rattled, but I’m ok now. – JW ::
“I have to admit that you work exceptionally well under pressure, you make difficult decisions quickly and you have one of the best tactical minds that I’ve ever come across.” The civil servant tapped his umbrella against the ground twice as he offered these rare words of praise.
John shrugged at him; he could see both sides. Once the doctor had changed his clothes and done his own teeth, he put the bedside lamp on and sat cross legged on the bed with his notebook on his lap to write up the conclusion of the case.
Meanwhile John was feeling hot and trying not to panic himself. He managed to take his jumper off on his own but his hands were shaking and damp with sweat so he struggled to undo the buttons on his shirt. Suddenly Sherlock was pulling him from the chair.
Sherlock glanced up sharply at the sound of a half-strangled shriek followed by a thump, it sounded like John had had a nightmare. The bump was the ex-soldier sliding out of his bed to sit on the floor, something he tended to do after his night terrors. Then the detective heard another quiet noise.
“How very interesting…” He murmured enigmatically to himself. John moved to his side and looked up at his friend’s face.
“I was thinking of working the pancuronium angle next. As you said, it’s hard to get a hold of if you don’t have a reason to need it. It’s used on patients undergoing surgery as a muscle relaxant so hospitals mi-” As the lift stopped there was a ding from Sherlock’s phone, signifying a message. “Scratch that, Lestrade needs us. Our killer has struck again.” John’s stomach sank as blue eyes met grey and a wordless understanding passed between them.
“Alright, fine! Next time I want a shower I’ll let you help me; now will you just drop it? I’m tired and can’t be bothered arguing anymore.” He yawned as if to illustrate that point. “This constant exhaustion is actually more annoying than the pain.” John couldn’t sleep for stretches longer than an hour and a half before waking up from chest soreness, creating a need for frequent naps. Sherlock was about to answer when there was the sound of footsteps on the stairs and his face darkened.
“Service record won’t be a problem. The details of any incidents, complaints or disciplinary action could be more difficult. Due to data protection and confidentiality.” The Inspector answered as he looked over some photographs, they were mostly group shots of the recruits that enrolled in the Academy at Sandhurst. He noted there was no obvious family photos.
“There was a large connection between Moriarty’s network and the former Yugoslav states. I’m sure you noticed that theme during the bomb debacle. I got set up in Bosnia initially and started nosing around carefully. There were at least three cells in this area and we wanted to take them all down without alerting the others. The first two went smoothly. The third… did not.” Sherlock’s body language started to close off and his eyes darkened.
The car picked him up on time and Sherlock was sitting in the back seat, glaring out of the window when he realised that he still had John’s note in his hand. His eyes caught on to the word ‘inadequate’ and he froze as he finally registered what John had said and implied in that line and the next. Sherlock had made his partner and best friend feel like he wasn’t good enough for him.
“It’s not going to be as easy as that, I-I think I just need some time to process this.” John turned, and with shaking hands, he started to make the cup of tea that he had forgotten about when Sherlock had shed his persona. “Can you let yourself out? I want to be alone for now.”
hard and you weren’t moving. I’ve never been so terrified in my life. Not when I was in deep cover in Russia. Or even when I was captured in Serbia.” Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on to John’s chest, watching the steady rise and fall and trying to take comfort from it.
“What on Earth has got you in such a snit? You’ve just solved a case, you know.” John spoke over the notes Sherlock was playing as he brought in two mugs. He placed them on the coffee table, sitting in his chair and picked up his own. Sherlock ignored him, still glaring angrily out the window. Ten minutes later he heard his flatmate’s deep sigh, placing his empty cup down as he stood up.
“So, he should be alright, then?” The DI asked, a grin breaking out over his face when Dr Fennel nodded in confirmation. “Oh, that’s brilliant news! I know he’s not walking out of here anytime soon but still… everyone in the precinct will be happy to hear that.” Lestrade clapped Sherlock on the shoulder, knocking him out of the relieved fog that he’d slipped in to.
“This shop is a lot smaller than Allatel’s galas, you go speak to Alice and ask her if there’s a certain donor that does a lot for the RNIB and is passionate about the cause. I’m going to get in contact with some suppliers of pancuronium bromide, see if there’s been some unusual activity lately.”
Sherlock was still for a few moments before he pulled a chair up to the side of the bed and sat down. He hovered his hand over John’s for a beat or two before covering it and giving his fingers a gentle squeeze. Sherlock could feel the door to the ‘LATER’ cupboard opening and he supressed a shudder as the fear washed over him again.
“I’m impressed you only punched the wall, Doc, how can someone so intelligent be so thick at the same time? How’d he think you’d react? His ‘death’ nearly destroyed you. There was a time when I was afraid you were gonna follow him.” Greg shook his head as he helped John put his coat back on, the struggle with Underwood had pulled his already aching shoulder too.
“Please sit, gentlemen, I understand you are here to discuss the murder of 2nd Lieutenant Harvey Callahan? Terrible business. He’s been an instructor here for nearly fifteen years, he’ll be missed.” Though Deakins kept a straight face, Sherlock was able to detect that the Major wasn’t being entirely sincere in his statement. There was an undercurrent of personal dislike towards his fellow officer and colleague.
Sherlock sighed as he checked the last room in the unlet office building. This one was a bust too, evidence of their smugglers using it was nowhere to be found, not even for storage from the looks of it. He hoped John was having better luck in the building he was checking, they needed to find which of the structures that the gang was using as their base of operations and soon.
“Thank you for the helpful information, let’s go to his place, John. I should be able to work out where he’ll try fencing it next if I see his flat.” Sherlock turned up his collar and was about to leave when the man called to them again.
“If I was that strong then I should have reported him straight away, who knows how many lads I could have saved the same pain if I hadn’t been such a bloody coward!” The doctor shook his head angrily, he didn’t want to be told he was brave, that he’d endured. In short, he didn’t want to be thought of as a survivor of abuse.
“Let’s get one thing straight, Mr Consulting Detective. Sorry is the absolute bare minimum I should be expecting from you, but saying it doesn’t magically make everything better. It’s just a word.” John sighed at Sherlock’s lack of understanding and grabbed the plate the biscuits were on, tipping them off and getting to his feet as well.
“The killer was definitely punishing Mrs Teller for something she refused to see. The eyeballs have been left to tell us what that was. The Tellers work for the same company, she in PR and him as an accounts manager. They share this study when they work from home, so this ‘secret’ is to do with the firm. The other eyeball was in one of Mr Teller’s golfing trophies, so it’s to do with him.” Sherlock spun on his heels to turn to the Inspector, his coat billowing slightly.
“Yeah, but those are things only you and your brother would notice.” John replied, being as short as he was made it difficult to get trousers and jeans that were the right length. He’d become somewhat of an expert at adjusting the leg lengths and knew what methods worked best for different styles. “Is Mycroft coming to the dinner? Bringing someone?”
“Patrick Underwood, I presume?” Inspector Lestrade spoke with authority as he began to read him his rights. “You are under arrest for the murder of Alexa Harris. You do not have to sa-” But when Greg reached for the man, Patrick decided he wasn’t going to come along quietly and he rushed at John to escape.
“I’m so lucky that I met you, you know, I was so bitter and angry when I was discharged.” The ex-soldier drew back with an embarrassed little smile. “I was part of something in the Army. I was needed, I was useful. Then I got injured, flown back to the UK and was expected to fit a Captain John Watson: army medic shaped peg into a Doctor John Watson: civilian shaped hole.”
John turned so he was facing Sherlock’s back, taking a small breath to steady his nerves before raising the flute to his lips. He closed his eyes as he tried to imagine himself back in the music room of his old school where he played this song over and over until he had it learnt by heart. John heard Sherlock gasp but didn’t open his eyes as he lost himself in the tranquil beauty of the melody.
“Serial numbers match?” John asked as he looked over Sherlock’s shoulder as the detective examined the two that had been brought out. At hearing an annoyed grunt of frustration, the doctor turned to the pawnbroker and showed him a picture on his phone. “Recognise this guy?” The man glanced at it, his mouth ticking up in a wry smile.
“There’s too much blood to really get much information from the body. The wounds are concentrated around the chest, chances are the lungs were punctured very quickly which would have prevented Callahan from screaming for help. Molly should be able to tell us just how many of these were actually inflicted post-mortem.” The detective frowned as he carefully turned over one of the victim’s hands, checking for defensive wounds.
“How absurd! Why did you think I’d get worked up?” Sherlock retorted in the indignant tone he used whenever he felt someone was implying that he had feelings like everyone else whose surnames weren’t ‘Holmes’. Lestrade made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a snort of amusement but he covered it with a cough and hid his mouth behind his hand.
“Admittedly it wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had; I just didn’t think I could sneak down two flights of stairs and out the front door without you noticing. Though it could have been worse. I could have landed on Mrs Hudson’s bins like our American friend.” That made the pair of them laugh lightly as the space between them naturally closed and their lips met.
“Literal flames? I was going to ask but then I remembered the sugar fireball, we were damn lucky we only lost the curtains and an oven glove that time.” John gave a wry little chuckle with a shake of his head, how Mrs Hudson put up with them at times was a total mystery.
“Hmm, the skimming must be happening before the figures get recorded in the software then. A cheque can’t be cashed in just anyone’s account so that rules them out. What happens when patrons pay for tickets in cash? Is there any opportunity to put a hand in the till, so to speak?” Sherlock turned the chair around so he was facing the pair of them, steepling his fingers in thought.
jealous!” Sherlock insisted automatically, not even needing to look to know that Greg didn’t believe him. The detective ignored him as he moved on to another picture and scanned the faces carefully. He froze and leaned in closer. “Lestrade, come here! I think I’ve found our man.” The DI was beside him in a heartbeat, he compared the man that Sherlock was pointing to against the screen capture.
“I can feel everything …and everything hurts.” John’s words were slurred slightly but he was quite alert. He winced as he tried to take a deep breath. “Skull feels like it’s caving in, it’s hard to breathe, knee’s sore, skin’s on fire… I’d found the storage freezers but there was a security guard… he saw me but I hid… I was… cornered… tried to make a break for… it. We fought.” It was obvious that it was becoming increasingly painful for John to speak so Sherlock shushed him.
Mrs Hudson let go of John’s arm and Sherlock saw his friend straighten his spine and march to the microphone before giving those in front of him a long hard look.
“Looks like my stomach would overrule me even if I wanted to say no, which I don’t… and you better not be planning to make me eat on my own either.” John threatened and Sherlock feigned a reluctant acceptance, hiding a grin in his scarf as he followed John into the lift. This. This is what he’d been missing.
“Oh God, Sherlock, I’m so sorry, that must have been a horrible thing to witness.” John automatically reached over to squeeze Sherlock’s forearm in comfort, shuffling his stool to be closer to him. He tried to push his rising sense of foreboding out of his mind.
“Is this standard military training, Captain?” Sherlock found himself asking, not bothering to hide the impressed edge to his tone as John pulled his shoes back on and tied them tightly. The doctor got to his feet and scrunched in the glass once more for good measure before offering his flatmate his hand.
After he’d showered and changed into a fresh set of clothes, John realised his phone was still in his coat pocket and he quietly stole back upstairs briefly to retrieve it. He couldn’t face Mrs Hudson right now, especially if she knew about Sherlock as she probably did by then. She’d be thrilled to have him back and the ex-soldier was still feeling too overwrought to respond appropriately. As he headed back downstairs, he saw he had a message from the early hours of the morning.
Sometime later found the pair of them walking through the streets visiting places where their courier could unload the tablet he’d stolen. They were heading for a ‘CashConverters’ type place when John grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and squeezed it tightly.
“My suit isn’t cheap. It cost £450, it’s by far the most expensive thing I’ve ever bought and I’ve worn it twice. I’m not going to be fitted for something that costs more than a second hand car when I’ve already got something appropriate in my wardrobe.” John was from a working-class background, he was very conscious of the price of living and what it was like to scrape to get by, so he tended to baulk at the amounts of money Sherlock could spend without blinking at times.
“Yes, that would be lovely, thank you… Oh, and Sherlock?” John waited until he had Sherlock’s attention before continuing. “You’re a good friend, the best in fact.” The pink flush that leapt across that normally stoic face was frankly adorable. John hid his smile in his cup as Sherlock snapped out of his shock and wordlessly raised his violin to play.
“We need more blankets and bed linens, please, soon as you can.” John grabbed an orderly by the arm as he passed. The department was running out of everything due to the sheer volume of seriously injured patients flowing in. He’d already put in an urgent request for more O negative blood from the blood bank, he could only hope there was enough to go around all the hospitals dealing with this tragedy.
“She’s right here…” Sally opened the door to the living room and John’s eyes watered as a wave of stale alcohol, smoke, vomit and general filth assaulted his senses. A face mask was waved under his nose by Anderson and the doctor took it and put it on.
“We both know that matters of the heart aren’t my area – or yours… But I know what I can see in front of me.
“I must go, I’m meeting with an errant corporate heiress whose dalliances have the potential to cause global stock prices to plummet. By my calculations you have roughly 80 minutes before Dr Watson wakes up from his nap. That should be long enough for you to gather your thoughts.” The civil servant tapped his umbrella against the floor and saw himself out. Sherlock didn’t even hear him leave, already in his Mind Palace to try and make sense of what Mycroft was suggesting and why.
“Not only is that not a question that it’s appropriate to ask in public, it is also none of your business. Out of respect for you, I’ve never interrogated you about your past sexual history, I’d appreciate it if you could do the same for me.” John was using his Captain’s voice; it was so effective because it was seldom deployed. A fact not lost on Sherlock, judging by his slightly chastened expression.
“We’re drafting a statement for them that we’ll release later and then they shouldn’t have any reason to hang around after that.” Sherlock waved his phone to indicate how he was conversing with his brother. John muttered something under his breath as he rubbed at his tender shoulder.
Later and Sherlock was in a relatives’ waiting room, he wasn’t sure how he’d got to the hospital. Did he ride with John? Did Lestrade give him a lift? Had he spoken to the doctors yet? Had someone informed them of John’s medical history? Speaking of the Detective Inspector, he arrived and pushed open the door with his hip because his hands were full carrying two paper cups.
John came in from a shift at the practice, it had been a relatively easy day for once. No one had thrown up on him at least, that was always a plus point in his book. He spotted his lover sitting in his chair, plucking absently at his violin and gave him a smile.
He could hear Sherlock upstairs in his bedroom having grabbed a box of his clothes to bring up on the last trip from the basement. The former soldier sank down on the couch to go through the rest of his box, looking up at hearing a loud yell.
“They don’t count, you wouldn’t take a stabbing and call it fencing.” Sherlock stated assuredly as he moved his hand so he could squeeze John’s wrist. “Though it is possible to stab someone during a fencing match, but that’s beside the point and rather complicates my metaphor… Ow!” The detective tutted as he accidentally nipped his tongue, making the doctor huff in amusement.
“Huh, you’d think someone who loves cheese so much would have some in his flat, right?” Greg commented with a confused huff. Sherlock suddenly let go of the laptop and it was only reflex that meant that the DI grabbed it before it fell off his lap. “Woah! Careful!”
When the cab pulled up outside, he paid the driver and hopped out. The doctor nodded with a smile at a couple of familiar faces as he ducked under the police tape and headed in to the room where forensics had set up. John grabbed a pair of dark blue scrubs with ‘Medical Examiner’ printed across the front and back in white and pulled it on over his clothes.
This case had come to his attention after John heard of a spate of patients being admitted with serious complications due to unlicensed transplant surgery while working at the UCH. After the sixth case, and third death, the doctor had had enough. He’d come home from his shift, explained to Sherlock everything he knew and asked for his help.
“It was just easier to pretend it never happened, alright? I didn’t want anyone to know about it because all the warning signs were there, I was just too stupid and naive to see them.” He headbutted the door again with a hitch of his breath. “Harvey was warm, caring and supportive. After a lifetime of being starved of affection, here was someone who finally noticed me. I trusted him completely.” At another harder bang Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and pulled him away from the door to prevent him from hurting himself anymore.
“Ah, good. Dr Watson has been remarkably lucky considering the height he fell from. He has a moderate concussion but no bleeding on the brain, no spinal injuries either. He has broken eight ribs though, some more than once. His left knee was sprained not broken so we’ve strapped it for now. He has a small internal bleed from his kidney but we are monitoring that carefully in the hopes we don’t have to intervene surgically. Finally, he has numerous lacerations from the glass but only three on his back required stitches.” The doctor delivered her news with a small smile, probably pleased to be giving good news rather than bad.
“My brother would never admit it out loud but he respects John immensely, at first glance he may seem pretty ordinary but he’s anything but. He’s still one of the most interesting people I know, even after all this time.” Sherlock put the lid back on his coffee and took a sip with a noise of satisfaction. “But anyway, the case, found anything?”
“Has the fiancé been found?” John asked pertinently as he pulled on his scrubs and protective gear. When he walked into the front room, his gaze was automatically drawn to the body of the young woman, she was lying on her back in a pool of her own blood and he could see at least two wounds.
“It’s some sort of wire, there’s flecks of metal in her neck where it cut into the skin. The killer used what was to hand, shoelaces to bind her to the chair after he overpowered her and her own scarf to silence her. My money is on a coat hanger, a wire coat hanger.” Sherlock had been looking at Ms Barratt’s neck with his pocket magnifier before turning his attention to her right forearm. “There’s more Braille here, care to translate it for us, John?”
“I’ve learnt more about you in the last ten weeks than I ever knew before, you can read Braille, for God’s sake! How many people can say that? Or that they can play the clarinet
“It has nothing to do with masculinity, I’d feel the same even if I was female. I don’t want or need expensive gifts. I want to pay my share of the household bills; I want to be self-sufficient. I want to earn my own wage and contribute to society… and now that I’m pretty sure I’ve missed my appointment; I’m going to head home and prepare myself for your brother’s inevitable tantrum. Goodbye, Mycroft.” John hung up the call and stood from the bench to head back to Baker Street.
“Got something from all this?” The doctor’s blue eyes were lit up with anticipation, ready to watch the detective work his magic by bringing together all the threads that no one else could usually see.
:: Do I wanna know what tropical fruits have done to upset His Highness? I’ve just been ordered to eradicate coconuts from NSY. – GL ::
“That’s… actually a brilliant idea. Why didn’t I think of that? Good thing I pickpocketed an ID badge from one of the local officers earlier.” Sherlock muttered in begrudging surprise, striding towards the nearest one with John jogging behind him.
“Don’t cry, Sherlock.” John’s voice was low and slightly slurred. He struggled to focus his eyes, being heavily dosed up with painkillers. But he turned his hand over under Sherlock’s so he could squeeze it back. The detective dragged the sleeve of his free arm over his eyes, cheeks reddening in embarrassment as he coughed.
“Look, I’m gonna head out. I need to think. I need to work out whether the fact you don’t understand is a deal breaker for me or not. Come and find me in a couple of hours.” John grabbed his shoes and sat down briefly to pull them on.
“Right, it’s not far to the cabin from here, thankfully. We’ll ice that ankle down as soon as we get in.” John sounded a little out of breath once they got back to the path. He used his right arm to grab Sherlock’s left wrist and held it against the detective’s knee. This way he only needed one hand to keep a grip on to his charge, the other free in case of emergencies.
When Sherlock knocked on the front door of the very picturesque townhouse, it was answered by a woman who the detective knew by deduction as being Mr Price’s wife.
Sherlock got everything placed on to a tea tray and carried it back into the living room, putting it on the coffee table as he heard the shower shut off. He settled back down on the couch and a couple of minutes later, the doctor walked out of the bathroom dressed in his normal clothes and towelling off his short hair. When he was done, he tossed it into a wash basket and sat down in his chair heavily.
“That’s fine, but shouldn’t we find some place to drop off our bags rather than lug them around with us?” John asked with a nod to the small hold-all and rucksack besides him on the seat. “It’s the off season so there should be plenty of B&Bs with spare rooms, let me see what I can find.” The doctor pulled out his phone, finding and booking them a twin room that was close enough to everything before giving the driver the address.
“Ouch! Careful!” John gasped and flinched away from his lover’s touch on his left hip. That was when Sherlock remembered that John had fallen during his dramatic escape. Sherlock moved so he was standing in front of John, his hands went to the doctor’s trousers, undoing them and sliding them down a little to reveal a large black bruise on the outside of the hip bone.
“Oh, check that for me, Sherlock, I set it to let me know when Callahan’s phone was switched back on. It might be Bartley.” The detective grabbed the mobile from the phone holder and pulled up the tracking app and saw there’d been a ping to a mast near their intended destination.
“I’ve got to go, text me if you need anything while I’m out and eat that sandwich before it goes stale and I’ll be back in a bit.” John checked to make sure he had his wallet with him, he’d need enough to get to the bar that his sister was currently holed up in, then to get her back to her flat safely and then finally to get himself back to Baker Street.
Then the next steps were to isolate the target socially, making them dependant on the abuser. Some showered their victims with gifts to build up the feeling that they were owed something. Others created an environment similar to a siege mentality, fostering a feeling of Us vs. Them to turn the groomed against concerned family members and friends.
“Well in that case, that’s it. As I said before, it’s been hard for me to find a guy I’m really into.” John gave the man on his shoulders a playful little bounce that both surprised and delighted him. “What about you? Same question.”
“Your medical records.” Sherlock replied seemingly distracted, though he was keeping half an eye on his friend as he skimmed the pages.
Just as Sherlock tried to creep closer unnoticed, Lestrade started pounding on the door, making Bartley look up sharply. He spotted the intruder and scrambled backwards on the bed until he was up against the wall.
John’s jaw shut with an abrupt snap at what he was about to say and instead of finishing his sentence, he just silently walked to the door of 221c, unlocked it, and closed it behind him with a click.
“Not particularly, not sure why you’re so concerned though, sometimes it seemed you did pretty much everything in your power to sabotage my love life.” John was half-amused and half-annoyed by this conversation and if pressed, he couldn’t honestly say which feeling was stronger right now.
“So what, do you not trust me or something?” Sherlock spat out venomously, gasping when John actually flinched. “My God, I’m right, aren’t I? You don’t trust me anymore! You said that you’d forgiven me!” Sherlock put his violin away angrily so he could pace the living room like a fuming wild cat.
“…I don’t believe you.” John’s reply made Mycroft frown in affront. “Don’t be offended, we both know that you can and have lied to my face before. It makes it a little hard to take your words at face value. Thanks for the lift.” The doctor unclipped his seatbelt and opened the door.
“I’m going to have a hot shower and then put some of my lidocaine plasters on, you said you’d call work for me?” John asked his flatmate who nodded at him. “I’ll leave my phone with you, if Lestrade rings then tell him what happened with the idiot kidnapper so he can press charges.” The doctor walked into the bathroom before he realised he didn’t have any clothes to change into and he really didn’t want to go up another flight of stairs to his room.
“But that’s insanity, why would anyone put up with that? Why would you?” The detective was blinking at him, taken aback and his rage subsiding. The ex-soldier went and picked up the guide from the floor, checking to see if he’d ripped any pages, before putting it in his pocket.
“Then why are you playing with your violin?” The doctor asked, at getting a questioning look from his lover, he elaborated. “Generally, you only poke at the strings like that when you’ve got something on your mind that doesn’t have anything to do with cases or The Work.” The detective smiled at that demonstration of John paying attention to his habits.
“You know, you were right about me, Sherlock.” Sally’s voice broke through his thoughts and he glanced at her trying not to let his surprise show on his face. Donovan was speaking to him but her eyes were on John. “I am jealous of you. I’m an envious person by nature, always wanting more, always wanting what someone else has.” The detective was startled, was she declaring a romantic interest in John? And was she implying that
“Alright, I will… and if I manage it, then you are buying dinner and you’re actually going to eat it for once.” John straightened up; confident he was going to win this wager as Sherlock nodded. “Turn around.” Sherlock raised a curious eyebrow but did as he was asked.
“So it appears. He posts under the name ‘AmateurAffineur’- which is an oxymoron, by the way. Others on the forum simply refer to him as AA for short. He’s a moderator and looks to be one of their top contributors. There’s a pinned post from him going over the basics of how to age cheese properly.” Sherlock clicked on the entry to bring it up for them, reading select paragraphs out.
“Thank you for telling me, I know that was hard for you. I’m sorry something like that ever happened to you and that you felt it was something you had to keep a secret from people.” Sherlock spoke after a moment or two. “… Your strength of character continues to astonish me.” John snorted heatedly.
The lengths of time that the ‘relationship’ persisted after that varied. Some lasted a few weeks, others a few months. Eventually the groomer got bored and moved on, threatening their victim with ruin, taunting them and insisting that their participation was purely voluntary. They counted on the intense shame to keep the groomed silent… Then the cycle would start from the beginning again.
John sighed and put his phone back in his pocket, money was always a trouble spot between Sherlock and himself, even before they started dating. The doctor had a fiercely independent streak, he’d watched his parents work full time to make ends meet and bring up two kids in a socially deprived area of Edinburgh. He’d learnt the value of money at a young age, getting a part time job in his teens while he was still at school.
:: Nearly. Just got access to the body and noticed some atypical bruising that I want to look a bit closer at first, I’ll meet you there when I can. – JW ::
Sherlock felt sick, no wonder John hadn’t wanted to be anywhere near this case when he saw Callahan’s body. The doctor was so vulnerable and in need of a friend when he joined the Army, susceptible to being manipulated by someone who had been doing this for a long time. The detective gritted his teeth, it was a damned good job Callahan was already dead as Sherlock would have been quite willing to kill him himself.
“What, really? Wow! What a ridiculously nice thing to do for a stranger.” John was flabbergasted as he followed into the kitchen and saw an elderly man with wiry grey hair, solid black framed glasses, wearing a thick green trench coat. “Hello, Mr Doyle was it? I’m John Watson, it’s nice to meet you and thank you for getting my shopping for me.” Doyle stood up when John offered him a handshake, the doctor noticing he was tall but slightly stooped with age and his hand was large and warm as he gripped it firmly.
“Yeah, well then you were gone and I couldn’t help thinking about the fact you didn’t like my blog very much, not just the style but the fact I put little details of your eccentricities on it and sometimes people who read it were mean about them.” John was not comfortable with having this conversation, that was why he always insisted on the ‘no time’ excuse. Anything so he didn’t have to lay out how guilty and pathetic he felt for Sherlock to know and see.
“But how? John types with only two fingers and can’t work a self-service checkout without shouting at it. These things would require someone with computer skills, access to CCTV footage and GPS locations. He couldn’t have dug it up himself and getting someone else to do so would have cost serious money.” His drink was forgotten on the desk; Sherlock shifted so he was sitting crosslegged in the armchair as he re-read the file to see what he’d missed on the first look.
“Next time, don’t kidnap someone with military experience, moron.” John muttered to the man as he put him in the recovery position before tying his wrists and ankles together with some storage cords he found. The doctor stood up carefully, but thankfully the dizziness and nausea he’d been expecting didn’t materialise. He padded up the stairs and found himself in a kitchen.
“Now you listen to me, John Watson, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, you hear me? You are moved by the deaths of strangers because, in your eyes, everyone on this planet is worthy of your respect until they give you a reason to believe otherwise.” The detective watched as his friend lifted his head slowly as he continued to speak.
“You really should get that hand seen to, John, I’ll take you after you’re done.” Greg looked down at the doctor, who glanced back up, ready to protest. “I’m not giving you a choice, mate, I’ll arrest you if I have to. You know I will!” John grumbled with a sigh as he went back to work.
“Hey, I just found the Doc! Christ, he looks so young and fresh faced there!” Sherlock’s head snapped up and he darted over to see for himself. John Watson was standing among his peers in full dress uniform. He was a little older than the average recruit due to him enlisting after completing his medical degree. “It’s a little odd to see him looking so serious, if I’m honest.”
“Get my bag, now.” The doctor allowed Sherlock to ease him back into his chair, noticing a wheeze as his throat constricted due to the rapid swelling. “999 too.” Sherlock froze in terror for a moment so John gave him a push to get him moving. Sherlock scrambled up the stairs to John’s room and came running back down with his medical kit.
Sherlock put his phone in his pocket and checked his watch, the car would be here in ten minutes. He didn’t have enough time to go looking for his wayward lover, he stomped down the stairs as he imagined Mycroft’s smug condescension when his younger brother turned up alone. Sherlock started coming up with believable excuses for John’s absence as he grabbed his coat and left the flat to wait on the pavement.
“Sometimes the accent and slang come out if I’ve had a bit too much to drink. No one could understand me when I came down to study medicine at Barts so I worked hard to lose my accent. Speaking clearly can mean the difference between life and death sometimes as a doctor, and as a soldier too actually now that I think about it.” John was blushing a little at all the attention he was getting, he glanced to Sherlock and caught his eyes to try and assess his partner’s mood.
John was brought out of his musing by his phone ringing, he pulled it out of his pocket and frowned at seeing it was Mycroft.
“That is a sound plan for the future.” The detective smiled at his friend warmly. “You should get to bed, you’re completely fatigued.” John looked thoughtful for a moment and headed to the kitchen instead. He re-emerged with two glasses and the bottle of whiskey Sherlock had brought with him that first day when he came back.
“JOHN!” That shout was followed by the sound of someone stampeding down the stairs like a herd of demonic cows. Sherlock swept into the sitting room with his eyes flashing wildly and absolutely livid, the dramatic effect not lessened any by the lack of his signature coat. He had something in his hand and he held it up for inspection. “What on Earth is this?!”
“It took a long time to get there, if Sherlock had been here then I’m sure he’d have cleared his name in a quarter of the time and we would have been eating Chinese takeaway while he corrected the telly by now.” A tiny nostalgic smile crossed John’s face and a brief light sparked in his blue eyes before it disappeared again. “But he’s not here, so it was down to me. It had to be me because I’m the one who put him in the firing line in the first place.”
“The rapist known as Harvey Callahan is dead. I killed him with my own two hands, my only regret is that he didn’t suffer more. So remember this, everyone’s actions will catch up with them eventually. I’ve used AA’s moderator privileges to collect and send all members’ personal details to both the police and the media, along with a letter of introduction that explains the real purpose behind this website. You’ve ruined so many lives, now it’s finally your turn, I’m just sorry I won’t be around to see it first hand.”
“I’ve just realised something. You’ve not had a single date since I came back.” Sherlock had ignored the question and was standing in the middle of the living room looking at John like he was a very interesting puzzle to solve, revealing the line his thoughts had been taking since their conversation over lunch. The former soldier sighed as he walked into the kitchen to put the detective’s sandwich away.
“Oh, John! What have you done to yourself this time?” She asked him in a voice full of maternal concern when she saw the splint and how stiffly he was moving. John was about to wave her off and say he was fine when Sherlock appeared in her doorway behind her and he lost the ability to speak for a moment.
“Hello, Dr Watson, you know if you wanted to come to work today, all you had to do was ask.” A young man with short red hair knelt down on the floor, putting an oxygen mask over John’s face while his female counterpart grilled Sherlock.
“Anyway, this analogy isn’t well suited to the situation because the act of ‘protecting’ the plate has probably caused just as much destruction as any attempt to ‘kill’ it would have done.” Sherlock jumped slightly as John clapped his hands together twice with a cheer and a blinding grin.
“How dare you even suggest that I have anything to do with Holly’s death?! Get out of my house!” John watched as Mr Price dragged Sherlock from the living room by his lapels. The detective was holding a hand over his cheek and looked a little dazed. When the solicitor threw him out the door, Sherlock stumbled on the steps but John was able to catch and steady him, the front door slamming so hard that the windows rattled in their frames.
“So, there was an ulterior motive behind the dinner after all? You’re a devious man, Sherlock, I’ll need to be careful that you don’t lead me astray.” The doctor had no idea why he came out with that blatantly suggestive comment, it’s not as if there was actual alcohol in his drink that he could blame. Part of him was intrigued with his friend’s playfulness and wanted to see how far they would take this. However, the atmosphere broke when Sherlock snorted with laughter.
The security guard had been caught the day after the incident but he’d already alerted the higher ups so the expected shipment of organs didn’t come in on the ship as planned. No one had gone to the estate either, despite covert surveillance. The gang was likely to go to ground and lay low for a while before trying to set back up their trade routes, under the radar.
“Noted. I’ve been meaning to speak to Mycroft anyway.” John brushed the crumbs from his shirt while his friend gaped at him. “Don’t look at me like that, I owe him an apology. I’ve spent two years freezing him out because I thought he’d screwed you over, only to find out that leaking your life story to Moriarty was part of the plan all along.”
“Here, this might dull the pain a little.” Sherlock put the whiskey bottle on the counter by the sink, his eyes flicking everywhere as his brain scraped around for a way to salvage this situation.
When he caught back up to his flatmate, he found him having an intense discussion with Nick Manning, Allatel’s Chief Financial Officer, their point of contact who was currently staying very late to ‘assist’ them.
John was sitting on the floor, leaning with his back against the side of the bed. The light vest and bed shorts he was wearing were both drenched in sweat. He had his feet on the floor with his legs bent, his forearms resting on his knees… and in his left hand was his Browning L9A1 UK military issue handgun. Sherlock’s heart froze solid and his train of thoughts derailed again.
“Fear... When you trust someone, you aren’t scared of what they might do.” John told him quietly, blinking against the sudden tears in the corners of his blue eyes as Sherlock gasped. “When you go off on your own, I’m scared that you are going into dangerous situations without me to watch your back and make sure you get out alive. I’m also terrified that you’re planning to leave me behind again. Either way, I wouldn’t survive your death a second time, that’s a fact.” All of Sherlock’s rage melted away into a knot of guilt in the pit of his stomach.
“You’ll be seeing sensitive information; I don’t want anyone walking in.” He sat down at his desk and logged on to his computer, bringing up their bookkeeping software, before getting up and letting Sherlock take his place.
“Brace yourselves, lads, this one is even worse, if you can believe it.” Greg told them solemnly and John silently steeled his nerves as they entered the room. This appeared to be a joint storeroom/cloakroom, there were lockers down one wall and bags of donated items down the other. In the centre of the room, there was the body of an elderly woman tied to a wooden chair.
“Wow, really? That’s… um, nice… to know, I guess?” John fumbled a little, unsure about how to react to such praise.
“Actually, before you all go, there is something I’d like to say.” John felt a wave of horror go through him, his flatmate speaking in public very rarely went over well. He could see a few journalists metaphorically rubbing their hands together in glee at this development.
“It was probably manslaughter, rather than murder.” John mumbled as he sorted some nightclothes from his rucksack. It was way too late to head back to London, and they’d already paid for the room anyway. “You said Ms Walters stumbled from being hit and the ground crumbled. Aimee Price didn’t intend to kill her.”
you to stop this and you still let me suffer for two years!” John’s arms were down by his sides and his hands were clenched into tight fists.
“It’s actually a relief to see that you’re still such a terrible liar.” Sherlock was right behind him, close enough to prevent John from escaping across the kitchen and through the sliding doors into the living room. “I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising that you’ve developed such mental techniques to compensate for that fact... Talk to me, John, tell me what happened.”
“I agree with you, John, I just misread the apricot and apple tart as something completely different.” Sigur chimed in, giving the doctor a knowing smile while Mycroft rolled his eyes at his father’s immaturity. A waiter came over and took their orders, bringing over the wine that they’d selected earlier. It was then that Violet noticed.
“But don’t forget he was in on the plan too!” Sherlock found himself bristling defensively and getting irritated despite himself. “How can you have forgiven him but not me? That’s hardly fair!”
“Because honestly, I already feel ridiculously lucky that I get to call you my best mate.” The doctor put the wine glass down, being careful not to knock it over with how bad his hands were shaking. Sherlock hadn’t moved, watching him with all the intensity he possessed. “You’re this stunning, brilliant, talented and all-round exceptional person who deserves the very best life has to offer and I’m just… me. A run-of-the-mill bloke who is pretty ordinary and boring in every conceivable way.”
“Hello, John, I can’t tell you how good it is to see you again.” Sherlock had dropped the accent, speaking in that baritone that the doctor thought he’d never hear again, at least not in this life. John was frozen in shock, his mouth opening to say something but before he could get a sound out, John swayed and his eyes rolled back in his head as he passed out.
The three of them walked off the hospital grounds where a black sedan was waiting. It felt ridiculous to be taking a car for a journey that only took twenty minutes on foot but these weren’t normal circumstances. Sherlock saw his friend and brother into the car safely and John sank into the soft leather seat, closing his eyes.
“Then clearly you’ve never been suicidal before.” There was a gasp from Sherlock but John missed the look on his face because he had flopped on to his back so he could stare up at the morning sky. “You have my therapy records, Mycroft, would you like to tell the class who I put down as my next of kin when I registered with Ella after I was first discharged?”
“If this is even half of what you felt when I jumped then I’ll never be able to say sorry enough… and you were thrown out that window! You didn’t want to fall, didn’t want me to see something like that! But that’s what I put you through
“Aww, well aren’t you just full of nice things to say today?” John smiled, turning his head away slightly as he blushed. “God, my head doesn’t half hurt.” He complained as he rubbed his forehead with a frown.
“He might not have been a victim himself; Callahan could have preyed on someone he knows maybe. Also, if he has the phone, he’s not switched it on yet as the last telecoms mast ping was before TOD.” Greg drained the last of his coffee. “What do you think the killer plans to do with the phone anyway?”
“A large part of me hoped I was wrong; it couldn’t be true because I should have deduced it. But you’ve made an art of burying away the things you don’t want people to know. If there’s no evidence, no data, then no one can learn your secrets. You count on people not digging too far beneath the surface.” The legs of the stool screeched against the floor as John got to his feet shakily, he was breathing heavily but he plastered a clueless grin on his face.
The detective was a person who threw himself wholeheartedly into every aspect in his life and his relationship was no different. Now he knew what it was like to hold John in his arms while he slept, he wondered how on Earth he’d ever survived this long without it? The physical side of their new dynamics hadn’t progressed much past hugs and some pretty intense make out sessions, mostly because of John’s still mending body but also partly due to the fact there was no rush, they had the time to explore and learn each other.
Two days later and Sherlock was sitting in his chair, looking through a stack of papers with interest. He heard the stairs creaking and John yawned as he padded in to the living room in his dressing gown, heading straight for the kettle.
John’s widened eyes felt like they were boring into Sherlock’s skull, not breathing as he searched for something in Sherlock’s face. Then there was a massive exhale of relief and John smiled at him, an exhausted and almost giddy grin that was infectious.
“Most mornings I went to school having only eaten a couple of packets of crisps for breakfast. One time when I got back from rugby practice, I was so hungry I took a microwave meal out of the freezer and ate it as is… I don’t recommend that by the way.” John looked up with a small forced smile that Sherlock couldn’t return. The doctor had never spoke about his childhood, only mentioning his older sister on occasion and very rarely his parents.
His car pulled up at The Square in Mayfair, the restaurant his brother had booked them a table at two weeks ago. Speaking of the devil, Mycroft was waiting for him just outside the front entrance. Sherlock silently groaned but plastered a neutral look on his face as he climbed out of the vehicle.
John’s head wound was bandaged and his knee was in a brace. He was bare chested, showing black/purple bruising covering his entire torso. Sherlock found himself biting his lip hard at seeing the former soldier looking so broken and vulnerable.
“Harry called me as I was heading to Tesco. I ignored it, but she left me a voicemail.” John lent back against the cistern, staring up at the ceiling while Sherlock carefully dug all the remaining splinters of glass out of his palm. John pulled his phone out with his free hand, calling his voicemail and putting it on speakerphone.
“We can do that later; I’ve got a first aid kit back at the B&B so I can sort out your face.” John gave the driver the address and raised his hand to stop Sherlock from protesting. “Don’t argue, it won’t take long and it’ll give us a chance to share what we’ve learnt.”
“Believe it or not, I don’t do it for her. I worry that the one time I say to her ‘No, make your own way home.’ will be the time she’s found in some back alley, beaten within an inch of her life or worse. I wouldn’t be able to live with that guilt. I don’t mind if I never get any thanks for it, seeing as neither one of us ever acts out of pure sibling love for each other anyway, we both have our own selfish reasons for what we do.” John replied with a helpless little shrug as he turned to head for the door.
“I’m not sure, blackmail other members of the ring? Hard to say without more data.” The detective closed the file back up and sat it on his lap as his phone buzzed. “Ah, Molly’s just finalised the autopsy and has sent a summary of the report.”
On a hunch, Sherlock took his phone out and looked up the law practice that Holly worked for. The man in the picture was Jonathan Price, a specialist solicitor in divorce and family law.
“Euphemisms? Ah, well, when they want to talk about something sensitive, I guess?” The DI got up from the floor too, still holding the laptop. “Like sex, a lot of people use metaphors when they are out in public because it’s more polite and you don’t know who is listening.”
“Looks like I need to try harder then because that indeed was the intention.” Sherlock replied without missing a beat but John thought he must have misheard somehow. Still, he didn’t want to ruin their meal and the jovial mood so he played along, half-curious to see where this was going.
“Harvey Callahan was a sexual predator. He was also a member of a grooming ring and spent his time targeting young men he met while working as an instructor at the Sandhurst Academy. His killer was a former victim… as were you.” John was too scared to move, to breathe, to even blink. It was like watching an oncoming train hurtling down the tracks straight for him and being unable to jump out of the way. At receiving no response, the detective continued.
“It says ‘It’s the light that terrifies them’ - Darkness holds no fear for the blind, it’s the light that terrifies them.” John straightened up as he mused on the meaning of the messages. “If our killer is drawing attention to things the victims are pretending not to see, maybe the light is a metaphorical spotlight? Shining down on the misdeeds he’s trying to draw attention to? You looked for the eyeballs yet?” The doctor asked as he glanced at Greg.
“I faked my death, I anticipated that Moriarty’s end game was to make me kill myself after destroying my reputation. Therefore, I came up with a plan, hoping I wouldn’t have to use it. I arranged for you to be called away and met Moriarty on the roof. He told me to jump or you, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade would be killed by snipers.” Sherlock could feel the intensity of John’s stare, absorbing every word, intonation and facial expression.
“Nice of you to join me again, Mr Holmes.” Dr Chen came into Sherlock’s vision from behind, the machine floor was dimly lit with maintenance lights. Even being concussed couldn’t stop the deductions.
“I will but where will you be?” Sherlock looked down at John as he chewed on his lip in worry, he didn’t like the thought that today could be the end of everything that they had shared together… for good. He wished he could influence the decision but Lestrade’s warning stopped him, the choice had to be John’s alone.
EDIT: In celebration of 1000 hits I've reworked the story according to feedback from Finnmark regarding epithets. That's the only difference, except for a couple of minor word changes. No plot changes etc.
Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed deeply as he recalled the final steps. Once the abuser feels they have a strong enough grip on the victim in every way: physically, emotionally and mentally. They’d use their formidable manipulation skills to coerce the target to sleep with other members of the ring. Of course, they were careful to paint a situation where the victim seemed to have a choice in the matter, but thanks to the grooming, such consent was only an illusion.
“You’re right! Well done! This was taken four years ago, so if we look at the records for that year we should end up with a name. Hey, lad, could you take us back to the Major?” Greg turned to their escort who nodded politely and led the two of them away.
“Sherlock! It’s quarter past one in the morning. If you go and see Dr Watson now, he’s likely to think he’s delusional from exhaustion. Stay with me tonight, I’ll have Anthea find out his schedule so you can plan how best to approach him.” Mycroft got up from his desk, going to grab his coat from the stand while the detective grudgingly put his scarf around his neck. “He’s also very likely to punch you, you are aware of that, aren’t you?”
“We’ve lost her. Calling Time of Death at… 7:16pm. Sorry, team, and thank you.” John sighed as he checked his watch and wrote it on the deceased’s chart, his heart was heavy but another patient needed his attention as their heart monitor screamed an alarm.
When the detective regained consciousness, he hissed in pain as his head throbbed in time with his heartbeat. Once the wave of agony subsided, he silently assessed his situation without opening his eyes. He was sat on a hard concrete floor while he was tied to a vertical strut of some kind. The room he was in smelt of dust and industrial grade lubricant. He finally cracked his eyes open to confirm that yes, he’d been moved to some kind of abandoned factory.
But after ten minutes of doing nothing but replaying the conversation and reciting parts of ‘The Caucasian Chalk Circle’ and ‘Mother Courage and her Children’ the detective growled in frustration, standing up to pace the kitchen.
“You’re hurt! Come in, I’ll let you use my phone to call the police and see to those. Don’t worry, I’m a doctor.” Chen ushered Sherlock in while he did his best impression of a grateful crime victim. However, he was absorbing all the information available as Dr Chen led him through the house.
“Then I bumped into an old friend who introduced me to a madman and before I knew it, I had people I cared about again. I didn’t feel the need to talk myself into waiting one more day anymore.” The doctor saw his flatmate swallowing a sudden lump in his throat. “… And if it hadn’t been for the fact that I knew Mrs Hudson and Greg cared about me then I wouldn’t be here right now, looking up at my best friend who I thought had died right in front of me.”
When he opened them again, he found Sherlock giving him the look he usually reserved for when someone had said something absolutely moronic and illogical. The detective stood from the couch, approaching John and grabbing him firmly by the shoulders.
“You’re talking about sexual abuse. Grooming someone that they then pass around like some sort of shared toy? …I think you might be on to something, Sherlock, but I’m going to need more than coded forum posts if I’m going to openly explore that as a line of inquiry.” This case had just gone from a brutal murder into something altogether more sordid. Sherlock checked his watch; it was too late to go to Sandhurst in person today.
“No, don’t go! Don’t retreat! Talk to me, John, tell me what you’re feeling right now! Make me understand! You were always the one that I looked to for guidance whenever I hurt people accidentally because I didn’t anticipate the effect my actions would have on someone emotionally.” Sherlock gulped when John gave a hysterical little laugh at being asked to explain ‘sentiments’ to a man who always despised them.
“It’s not like you could reach everywhere anyway, you can still barely bend.” Once the former soldier had got over his initial surprise, he had then proceeded to try and shout at Sherlock while simultaneously protecting his modesty by twisting away. Unfortunately, all he ended up doing was aggravating his still healing injuries. John put his newspaper down in his lap and covered his face with his hands in frustration.
“Don’t stretch! I’ll get it!” Sherlock plucked the thermos out, unscrewing the cup at the top and setting it down on the wheeled bed table. “She knows, she just wants you back as soon as possible.” He filled the cup with tea, putting the lid back on and moving the table so John could reach.
“Right, let me put you down next to the couch and see if there’s an ice pack or something in the freezer.” The doctor got into the living room and gently knelt down to put the detective back on his feet. He made sure his partner had his balance before straightening back up.
“Nonsense. You feel inadequate because your child’s blindness is incurable, something that chafes against you as both a father and a doctor. So you throw yourself at supporting causes, to feel like you’re doing something useful for her. When you’ve noticed people taking from the charities, it’s almost like a personal attack on you and who you love.” Dr Chen took a step back, as if physically struck by the detective’s words, laying his internal struggles out before him.
“You should have waited and called me to help! If you’d fallen on the side of the bathtub then you’d have been right back in hospital again, probably needing surgery this time.” The detective snarled. He had only gone to the shops, coming back to the sight of John’s empty chair and the sound of the shower running. Sherlock had burst into the bathroom like a livid tornado, nearly giving his flatmate a heart attack in the process.
“Um, well then… I’ll just… be going then. Um, my number is still the same. Text me… if you like.” The detective fumbled, John still had his back to him and refused to turn around. “Again, I’m sorry, I hope you can forgive me… I’ve really missed you.” Then he finally turned and darted up the stairs and pretended he didn’t know that John would break into pieces as soon as he heard the door close.
“Ah, John! I’m glad you’re back! There’s someone here to see you.” The Baker Street matriarch reached out to greet her tenant and friend with a hug and he gave her a kiss on the cheek.
“Yes, because drinking right now would be a fantastic idea, you idiotic twat!” John cursed as he switched off the water and carefully dried his hand with a tea towel. “Why did you even bring that? You can’t seriously have thought I’d go ‘Welcome back, mate, here’s to not being dead. Cheers!’?”
“Don’t worry, it’s not loaded.” The doctor had spotted him and tilted the gun to show that the slot for the magazine was empty, the detective let out a breath of relief.
“How much of that did you hear?” He asked, getting a drugged up euphoric grin in reply, making Sherlock give an exaggerated groan in response. “What price for your silence? Hobnobs?”
“Come off it! We both know that if I’d spent the first few weeks of us living together telling you all the inane unimportant details about me and my life then you’d have driven me out in a month.” John answered him calmly, picking up his own drink and taking a sip. “By the time our friendship had solidified, I still felt no need to inform you about my sexuality because I knew it wouldn’t make any difference to how you felt about me.”
“Let me get you out of here then, Doc, I just need to ask you a bit more about how you know him and when you last saw him, alright?” Greg led the shell-shocked man out through the door and back down the hall. Sherlock looked after them for a moment, feeling a vague sense of disquiet for a reason that he couldn’t quite put his finger on.
“I had a lot of trouble with sleeping a while back, so I went to see someone and they prescribed me a few months’ worth of lorazepam. But I was worried about becoming dependant on them so I didn’t take them in the end and my insomnia resolved on its own.” John was still unpacking his box as he spoke, not looking up at Sherlock as he did so, praying that he’d take the hint and drop the topic.
John was sitting on the closed lid of the toilet, their first aid kit balanced on his knee as he dug around for some tweezers. The blood was already seeping through the towel in places, he unwrapped his hand to expose the lacerations on his palm and fingers, examining them for any splinters of glass.
A few days later found John sitting at the desk with his laptop, he was catching up on his emails and moderating the comments on the blog. He heard the front door close and Sherlock’s footsteps on the stairs, the detective had given him the cold shoulder after John had got back from hiding in the park before the issue was dropped again for a while.
“You’ll have to come up with a good name for the trust. I already know that you’re too modest to let it be named after you, maybe something more descriptive is needed.” Sherlock watched John’s face as it turned thoughtful. “No rush though, as there’s something else that requires your undivided attention right now.” He slipped one hand under the fabric of the half unbuttoned shirt to caress John’s chest.
“Now my client, Dr Watson, wishes to address you all.” There was a quiet muttering of those present which told Sherlock that John speaking directly to the press was a rare occurrence.
Sherlock could probably work it out, given a few more minutes but he decided to go for the direct approach.
“Patient is going into hypovolemic shock; I’m putting in an IV line, get me some O negative blood, I need it now.” John grabbed the equipment he needed and put the line in with practiced ease. Once the blood transfusion started, the doctor watched the heart monitor while taking the patient’s pulse manually with his hand. “Great, heart rate is stronger and slowing down. Keep an eye on him.”
She lived alone and probably would not have been reported missing until Monday when she failed to turn up for work. However, as it was, a man was walking his dog along the beach near the cliffs when he spotted her red coat on the rocks. This was at shortly before 8 pm, luckily the tide had yet to come in or the body would have been carried out to sea.
“That sounds like John, he did punch the Chief Superintendent, he’d have insisted on taking responsibility for his actions. I imagine it was a fine for the conviction itself considering it was his first offence?” Sherlock’s voice had a fond note to it at discussing John and his strong moral principles.
“How long have you been following me?” The detective turned in time to see John go rigid at hearing the question. Sherlock could see him internally debate whether to deny it or not before he decided against it.
Sherlock was quiet too as he absorbed this new information. Most people that he’d met in his life had needed almost constant praise and reassurance in whatever they did. John was a rare exception; he was very forthcoming with his own compliments but didn’t seem to require much back. Whenever someone did praise the doctor, he was always pleased but very modest about it. These personality traits made perfect sense now he had the appropriate context.
Sherlock managed to dart forward quickly enough to catch John before he cracked his head on the kitchen table. The detective lowered his friend to the floor gently with a worried frown.
“No, there’s not enough blood here for exsanguination. A lot of paralytic drugs can cause respiratory depression so I think hypoxia due to an imbalance of carbon dioxide is a more likely cause of death. Autopsy should confirm it.” John answered as he finally picked up Mrs Teller’s right forearm to examine the circular marks.
“Hey, Doc, good to see you. Got your bag right here.” Sally Donovan approached him as John bent down to put on some disposable protective shoe coverings.
“Oh God, John! What do I do? Please, what do I do? Tell me!” Sherlock blinked hard as his voice squeaked out past the lump in his throat.
“Obviously your scales are heavily weighted on the side of saving lives, doctor. Yes, you were on the front lines but your primary objective was to treat your comrades rather than fighting insurgents. As for the tally since you’ve been a civilian, I’d say you saved more lives just last night than you’ve taken in nearly four years… and that’s without getting into a debate on the relative value of one person’s life in comparison to another.” Sherlock replied with an assured air, as though the answer should never have been in doubt.
As Sherlock finished reviewing that particular memory he was struck with a realisation. While John may have got better at trusting people to take care of him physically when he needed it, that didn’t apply to emotional injuries. The doctor
Sherlock shuffled so he was sitting beside his friend, putting an arm around his shoulders and pulling him to lean against his chest. It seemed that John didn’t want him to say anything, he just needed his presence. That, Sherlock could do. If John Watson needed him there, there he would be.
“Not yet, feel free to have a look around. Just don’t touch them or the murder weapon if you find it.” The Detective Inspector waved a hand to indicate they should go ahead and search the room. Sherlock immediately went to the lockers, picking the locks and opening each one while John started to carefully search through the bags of donations.
“Ok, you might not trust me, but that doesn’t explain why you’ve instantly dismissed the idea that my brother could want you.” Mycroft stated as John got out of the car. John sighed and lent down to look back inside at him.
“Poor woman; must have been drugged with something then. We’ll do a full tox screen.” Greg wasn’t normally squeamish but the sight of an eyeless face was something that always disturbed him. Thankfully it was rare to come across something like this. “Do you think she bled out?” The once white pillowcases and sheets were covered in blood that had browned due to age and there was a heavy scent of iron and copper in the air.
Sherlock thought as he retrieved the half-bottle of whiskey he’d brought out of a pocket in the trench coat and gathered the ex-soldier’s upper body in his arms.
“That’s a fantastic idea! I knew so many kids growing up who would have loved to go into further education but their families just couldn’t afford it and there’s only so many scholarships to go around.” John loosened his grip a touch and pulled back to look at Sherlock, his blue eyes sparkling in excitement.
“That doesn’t taste like any ice cream I’ve ever had before, what is it?” The doctor looked at the tub to see it was a lactose-free ice cream made with coconut milk and thus suitable for vegans too. He had another small bite and shook his head. “Nope, I’m not a fan. You can keep it for yourself, thanks anyway.”
The rest of the train ride passed in a companionable silence with Sherlock dipping in and out of his Mind Palace and John writing away. The detective noted that his friend continued to take written records of their cases but he still hadn’t resumed blogging. The excuse of not having enough time had been rolled out on every occasion Sherlock had brought the subject up but he couldn’t shake the feeling that that wasn’t the whole truth of the matter.
“What makes you think I’m being anything other than entirely sincere right now?” There was confusion and a little hurt in Sherlock’s voice. It was enough to make the doctor feel instantly guilty but he resisted the urge to turn and face his flatmate, not until he knew what Sherlock’s game was; an experiment? Something for a case? A misguided attempt at pulling a prank?
“Friends don’t make friends feel stupid, humiliated or useless or used or alone. I could forgive you anything, and I often did, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t still sting.” John wrapped his arms around his torso, wincing when his hand throbbed as he hugged himself tightly.
“What have you done to it?” John asked, having learnt the hard way to distrust any food or beverage offered by consulting detectives that he hadn’t seen being opened or prepared.
Emergency medicine; John was in his element here. It would be wrong to say he ‘enjoyed’ it, these were real people who were suffering, no decent human being could be happy at seeing that. But he did feel useful and the sense of accomplishment he got whenever a patient was handed over safely to a ward reinforced a positive feedback loop that told him that he was where he needed to be.
“Kinda hard when I know this thing costs ten times my annual registration and practice fee with the GMC.” Though he did make an effort to stand up straighter to look at his reflection. He had to admit it was a very comfortable suit and it fit perfectly. He caught Sherlock’s eyes using the mirror. “It’s a very nice suit, but it’s not two and a half grand better than my one in my opinion, I’m sorry.” Sherlock gave him a look that he usually reserved for Anderson whenever the latter attempted to be clever and missed by a country mile.
Nowadays John was generally a lot better at accepting help from his flatmate (and a select couple of others too) but it wasn’t always that way. In the first year of their association, he would stubbornly insist he could take care of anything and everything himself, even when the opposite was readily apparent.
The glass in the former soldier’s hand suddenly cracked and then shattered, the shards falling noisily into the sink as blood began to drip from John’s clenched fist. Before Sherlock could even speak, the doctor wrapped his hand in a tea towel and stalked into the bathroom without making a sound. The detective stared after him in complete bewilderment before sliding off the stool, moving to stand in the threshold.
Sherlock’s first emotion was fury that John had decided to skip out on their dinner, he stalked over to the window and threw it open. His expertly attuned eye able to pick out how John had got back down to ground level. It looked like he’d shimmied down the metal drainpipe, though there was evidence that it wasn’t a completely smooth journey with a couple of slips, in fact it looked like John had lost his grip and fallen for the last six feet or so.
“I’m sorry, I must have dropped off for a second there because it sounded like the British Government just enquired into my love life.” John’s capacity for snark was undiminished, despite his exhaustion. When he realised it was a genuine question, the doctor let out an incredulous noise.
Sherlock was grateful for the darkness as he lurked near Dr Chen’s suburban house; he was trying to think of a believable cover story for knocking on the door at past ten at night. He was sure he could confirm if Chen was their serial killer if he could just get inside and speak to him. An idea finally came to him, he’d pretend he’d been mugged and ask to use his phone. No medical professional he’d ever met had been able to refuse someone who was hurt.
“John, I’m not going to leave you again, you have to believe me.” The detective stared at his blogger with an earnest gaze, wishing he knew how to erase the doubts from his friend’s mind. He watched as the doctor gave him a small watery smile, letting go of his arms.
“It almost sounds like you are offering me your blessing.” This situation was so surreal that Sherlock wasn’t certain he hadn’t accidentally ingested some sort of hallucinogen. Granted, he wasn’t performing any experiments on anything like that at the moment, but still, it seemed the only reasonable explanation for this odd conversation. Mycroft gave him a condescending smile, though it was maybe a touch warmer than normal.
Sherlock took a sharp intake of breath, mind reeling for something to say, something to make things better but he came up empty. Instead, he gathered up the remains of his disguise, settling for just pulling on the trench coat and shoving the wig and glasses in to a pocket.
“You say it’s about justice but all it’s about is that you love your daughter and feel you’ve failed her.” Sherlock shook his head with a disgusted tut. “And now, not only did she lose her mother, she’ll lose you too. Either to prison or your own conscience, all because you took your self-loathing out on two people who didn’t like acknowledging the truth. Hardly a capital offence, doctor.”
“Come on, let me wrap that up for you so you can eat it at home.” John grabbed Sherlock’s sandwich and folded a couple of serviettes around it while the detective settled the bill. The pair of them jumped in a cab back to Baker Street, heading up into their flat. “So, do you want me to look through the papers to see if there’s anything interesting or do you want the afternoon off now?”
A few hours later and John was sporting a splint on his left hand, having broken his third metacarpal bone with bruising to the second and fourth. The doctor had filled his friend in on what had happened last night, neglecting to mention the fact he’d fainted at the big reveal or that he’d cried himself dry afterwards.
:: You done at the morgue? Our victim was having an affair with her boss and I’m going to pay him a visit. – SH ::
“Moriarty slipped up, and for a moment I thought I wouldn’t have to fall back on my plan. He could call off the snipers, I would have done whatever was necessary to force him to make that order. So, he killed himself, knowing I had to do the same to save you.” The detective looked up at that point, John was trembling from head to foot, digging his fingertips into his upper arms so hard that he was going to leave bruises.
“Yes… and the good tea…” John agreed in a drowsy drawl, the detective staying quiet in the hopes the doctor would fall back to sleep. He’d almost dropped off when John jerked awake for a moment and stared as if checking he was still there; Sherlock squeezed the hand in his to reassure him.
“Nothing! Mrs Hudson bought two tubs and didn’t like them so she gave them to me. I ate the open one last night and thought I’d share.” Sherlock insisted with an encouraging smile but at seeing the distrusting look, he grabbed the spoon and scooped up some of the ice cream. “Oh, for God’s sake! I’ll have a bite first… see? It’s safe, I promise you!” John took the spoon back and used it to take a small mouthful, making a face.
“I’m not sure what I would have done if I came back to London to find you’d killed yourself in the meantime.” Sherlock’s voice was almost inaudible, but not quiet enough to hide the quiver in his tone. “I wasn’t angry with you, not really, I think I was just shocked at realising that you being safe and well when I got back was an assumption, not a certainty.”
“That was the fact-finding exercise announced roughly five months after your ‘death’, mostly thanks to the tireless efforts of one Doctor John Watson.” Mycroft swished the liquid in his glass and indicated to a file on his desk. Sherlock picked it up and started flicking through it.
Sherlock thought just as John twisted his body at the last second, slamming his clenched left hand into the wall with a noise of anguish and frustration.
“Why didn’t you tell me that you were allergic to coconuts?!” He hissed accusingly as John opened the bag and dug through it, finding an auto-injector of epinephrine. He uncapped it and pressed it into the meat of his thigh and held it there for several seconds. The ex-soldier’s breathing was becoming more laboured and Sherlock got down on his knees in front of the chair. “What do I do? Tell me what to do!”
A few hours later and John came back down the stairs into the living room, he’d just finished putting away all his clothes and was looking forward to relaxing and enjoying the remainder of his day off. He’d just sat down on his chair when Sherlock appeared and thrust an open tub of ice cream under his nose.
Two hours later and Sherlock pushed open the door that led onto the rooftop of St Barts, it was coming on to evening but there was still enough light for the detective to spot John. The doctor was hiding from the worst of the wind by hunkering down near a bank of air conditioning outlet vents.
“Honestly, John, I didn’t realise you’d taken my criticism so much to heart, mostly because it didn’t stop you when I said it originally.” Sherlock sat up a little straighter, looking a touch pink and chastened.
“Falco? Sure, I do. Shoulda shown me that to start with and saved yourselves some time. Everyone around here knows what he’s like and knows better than to buy anything from him. He’ll be trying to flog that tablet of yours farther away or he’ll still have it on him.” The broker took the gadgets back from them as Sherlock looked at a map that had Robert Falcon’s home address and nearby pubs, electronics stores and pawnshops marked on it.
“Not necessarily, Lestrade. As John has just shown us, one does not have to be blind to know Braille. The blind person referred to might be the victim considering the killer took her eyes. Paralysing her with some unknown drug before mutilating her in this way suggests a very personal vendetta. Was there something she was refusing to see, perhaps?” Sherlock was examining every inch of the body and the bed, looking for trace evidence that would slip by the average person.
The doctor in John wanted to ask his friend if he was alright but he had the presence of mind to drag Sherlock away so they were out of the view of the Prices’ house.
I’ve noted lately that the good doctor seems to have had a softening effect on you, little brother.” The civil servant watched as Sherlock flicked his gaze up and narrowed his eyes.
Sherlock wasn’t sure about what to do, as it was John seemed to be pretending that he wasn’t there. The detective chewed his lip as he tried to work out what was wrong.
“The dispatcher said to lay you down on the floor, the ambulance will be here soon. Just stay calm and try to breathe as best as you can.” Sherlock carefully lowered John towards the floor, kneeling next to his head, monitoring his respiratory rate while he held his wrist to take his pulse. “I cannot believe you never told me about your allergy!”
“When the General Medical Council suspended him from practice for six months for pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer, Henry Knight was the one who paid the legal costs and accompanying fine. John said he wouldn’t be able to look himself in the eye anymore if I made the disciplinary action ‘go away’ as he put it.” The civil servant puffed his cheeks out in a rare show of petulance at the doctor’s stubborn streak.
a crime to manipulate an adult into loving you, then poison their mind and pass them around to your friends. If you’re not underage or classed as ‘vulnerable’ then it’s your own stupid fault as far as the law is concerned!”
But the dreaded moment never came, John was relieved and could only assume that either: 1. Sherlock knew and was content to ignore it in favour of maintaining their friendship or 2. The man who abhors sentiment and avoids relationships couldn’t spot a crush the size of the London Eye even if it lived with him and made him tea on a regular basis.
“True, but I’ve already worked twelve hours out of the last twenty-four and I’m looking forward to some food and a cup of tea.” John put the bags on the counter and rooted around in them for the receipt. “Ah! Here it is, have a seat, Mr Doyle, I’ll put the kettle on and get my wallet.”
“I know that, Sherlock, but the fact remains that you did humiliate me… hurt me.” The last two words were barely audible as John closed his eyes and two traitorous tears fell and traced his cheeks before the doctor hurriedly wiped them away. “I’m actually very happy you’re not dead, truly, the world needs Sherlock Holmes… but I feel like I’m drowning. I just don’t see how we can ever go back to how we were before.”
“I have! I wouldn’t have said that I had forgiven you if I hadn’t!” John was insistent, obviously trying to keep his voice low so they wouldn’t wake up Mrs Hudson with their argument. If the violin hadn’t already done so, that is.
“I can’t trust anyone! Even four years afterwards he’s still always in my head. How can I even think of opening up to anyone again when the same lips that told me I was special then laughed and called me useless when he was tired of me?” Bartley fisted his hair tightly with his free hand in anguish. “And believe me, I tried! I tried to forget! I tried to move on!”

“Si vis amari, ama.” Sherlock eventually replied softly, “Love if you want to be loved. It’s Latin. You should find someone you are willing to do that for first, the rest will surely follow.” The detective gave Sally a small reassuring smile, which she returned for a brief second before Greg announced that the photographers were finally done.
“What do you want?” Sherlock answered in an annoyed tone. However, he listened patiently to whatever it was that the British Government wanted from him. “Ugh, how dull. But you’re lucky I don’t have anything else on. Send me the information and I’ll look at it.” Meanwhile John had finished his abdominal crunches and moved on to push ups, something so familiar to him that his pace was almost blistering.
“No, actually. Maybe the killer took it with them to destroy it?” Greg replied as an officer knocked on the door and handed over some papers to the Inspector. “Got Callahan’s address here and some background information. Looks like he was a 2nd Lieutenant now, rather than Lieutenant.” Sherlock’s head popped up instantly from the other side of the bed.
responded positively to being told they or their emotions are ‘tedious’?” John asked as he consciously loosened the death grip his fingers had on his cup. He watched the small flickering movements of his lover’s eyes that revealed he was rapidly reviewing memories in his Mind Palace.
Sherlock frowned as he finished reading, he couldn’t help noticing a distinct lack of concrete instructions for something that was supposed to be a guide to help others learn how to age cheeses. In fact, on the main page itself there were several links to much more comprehensive tutorials on other sites that gave detailed descriptions of equipment, required humidity levels and storage conditions.
“Mr- ahem! You are under arrest for…” He frowned, realising that he should have asked for more details. “…for doing something illegal to John Watson. You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence…” He continued as they led the suspect out of the house, definitely one of his less conventional arrests, that’s for sure.
“John, I know you must be very confused right now…” Sherlock got to his feet deliberately slowly, not wanting to startle or provoke his friend any. “… and you’ve likely got a number of questions that I’ll happily answer, but please try and remain calm.” John snorted incredulously at that as he folded his shaking arms over his chest and finally found his voice again.
“Christ, that is really good. I don’t think I’ve ever had a better chicken stir fry.” The former soldier commented as soon as he’d finished swallowing. Sherlock loved praise, of any kind, so he visibly preened from the compliment and beamed at him.
“Do you think if I promised to stay on the couch and not move, they’d let me out early?” The doctor asked as he blew on his tea and took a sip with a noise of satisfaction. Sherlock had pulled up his chair, sinking into it and pulling out his phone to check his emails.
“It looks like the epinephrine you took is reducing the swelling, your oxygen saturation is going up and heart rate is coming down. But let’s get you to the hospital for some tests and observation anyway.” The cheery man told John as they got their patient loaded on to a stretcher. John tried to protest that he was fine but his voice came out croaky and he gave in.
The car pulled up to an apartment block that was on a good public transport line for commuting, either into London or the other way towards Sandhurst. Greg parked up and found the building manager, showing his badge and asking to be let into Callahan’s flat.
“Dear God, John! I’m sorry! How many times can I say it? Do you want me to beg? Is that it? What more do you want from me?” Sherlock got up from the couch in agitation, running a hand through his hair as the discussion got away from him again. The former soldier fixed him with a cool look, downing the last of his tea with a gulp and putting it back on the tray.
