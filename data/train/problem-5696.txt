But this ‚Äî the failed joke ‚Äî was a reminder that Tony was simply human, a comforting glimpse of the real person beneath, the person whom Steve had met and lived with in 1939.
His emotions had settled deep into his chest, and Steve could feel the anxiety, the grief, the loss and displacement, the fear as though they were pushing down on his heart, the way the arc reactor must feel heavy in Tony‚Äôs chest.  All of his feelings were so tangled up, so tightly wound, he knew he would never find a way to untangle them.  He could remember the echos of it from when his ma had died but without any of the relief he‚Äôd felt knowing that at least she wasn‚Äôt suffering anymore, that at least she could breathe easy again and her soul was free, no longer confined to the convalescent ward.
Swallowing, Tony felt the words stick in his throat.  How long had it been since they were together?  After Thanos, Tony had spent weeks in an ICU under the supervision of Helen Cho, followed by months at a rehab where he learned to walk and use his right arm again, such as he could.  It wasn‚Äôt that anyone hadn‚Äôt come to visit ‚Äî the Avengers and Peter, even Sam and, on one memorable occasion, Bucky.  After everything, though ‚Äî well, it was hard to be together.  They could feel the empty space left by Natasha, knew how much they‚Äôd lost and given away to get everyone back.
Steve narrowed his eyes and turned Tony‚Äôs other arm over, taking in the scrapes on that arm and palm before looking back up at his face.  ‚ÄúYou look like someone kicked your ass,‚Äù he replied.

‚Äî that somehow Tony had known about all of this: his multiple attempts to join the war, Dr. Erskine and the super soldier serum, Howard Stark, the bond show, Schmidt and Zola and the war, but most importantly about Captain America.  Steve didn‚Äôt understand how Tony had known ‚Äî Steve just knew he had.
‚ÄúNatasha talks too much,‚Äù Steve said, looking back out over the desert.
‚ÄúWhatcha up to, Cap?‚Äù Tony asked, settling onto the other end of the couch.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been paying attention,‚Äù Bruce answered, while Natasha and Clint nodded their agreement.
Steve pulled away and straightened as he turned around.  Tony came to his side, wrapping his arm around Steve‚Äôs waist.  Standing near them on the sidewalk was a young man in sunglasses, jeans, and a Jets jersey with the number 88 blazed on the front and back, his arms crossed over his chest and a scowl on his face.
Steve felt his hands begin to shake at the memory, and he carefully set down the rolls next to the baking sheet, bracing his hands on the counter to keep the others from noticing.  ‚ÄúYou can just ask Jarvis.  He‚Äôll take care of it for you,‚Äù Tony continued on, unaware as the panic mounted, the tightness settling in Steve‚Äôs chest.
Steve ducked his head at the thought, settling it into his hands as he finally let himself think the unimaginable.  He wished Natasha were still there, her presence comforting, even knowing he would never tell her what he was thinking.
Trying again, he forced the words out.¬† ‚ÄúMy mother rode a mare, and she bucked at the sound of the gunshot.¬† My mother was thrown, and it broke her neck.‚Äù¬† Pausing again, Tony looked down at his hands, scrubbing his palms against his legs.¬† He hitched the blanket up a little higher on his shoulders, clutching at the fabric.¬† ‚ÄúMy father wasn‚Äôt much to speak off ‚Äî a drunk, harsh man who only really cared about three things: money, influence, and good whiskey.¬† If nothing else, he gave me my good taste,‚Äù Tony said humorlessly, waving towards the table where the whiskey was still soaking into the wood.
of it on the wood reverberating through the cabin in the silence.
Steve was standing at the drafting table, which was propped up to let him work at a comfortable angle.  There was a reference schematic pinned to the table, and Steve was working on a drawing of a pretty woman holding a cigarette dressed in what he thought was supposed to be an evening gown judging by the fur over her shoulder ‚Äî but it sure looked like a negligee to Tony.
Not with Tony.
‚ÄúOh,‚Äù was all Bucky said in response as his head popped through the neck of his shirt, scattering water droplets from his wet hair everywhere.¬† ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm not 2B any more.‚Äù He ran a hand through his hair before adding some pomade.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Steve?‚Äù she asked.  She got up from the chair, still wrapped in the blanket.  ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt like it when he laid one of your weak spots out for everyone to see.  Oh, don‚Äôt look at me like that,‚Äù she added when he glanced at her.  ‚ÄúI know what it is to be hungry.  I know what it is to not have enough, to wonder where your next meal is coming from, even when you‚Äôre surrounded by this.‚Äù  Natasha spread her arms wide, taking in the apartment and Jarvis and even the city beyond them.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt spend the first part of your life fighting to survive just to be able to put that aside because today you happen to have enough.  You don‚Äôt
‚ÄúThe appropriate response is ‚ÄòThank you, it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted!‚Äô‚Äù Bucky said, making himself a cup of coffee from the hot water on the boiler.  He turned around and leaned against the counter.  ‚ÄúOr we can go without you.  I‚Äôm going to take a nap before we go ‚Äî you can decide how much of an ass you‚Äôre going to be about this while I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù
Tony walked back towards the bedroom, and Steve looked over when he walked into the drawing room, doing a double take.  ‚ÄúBuck‚Äôs clothes fit pretty nicely,‚Äù Steve commented.
‚ÄúMaybe you should have stayed in Iowa, if life is so good you can afford to replace socks instead of mending them,‚Äù Steve said.  The offhand comment made Tony‚Äôs cheeks warm with shame, and he ducked his head a little.  Steve walked him through the steps of making the loop outside the hole then weaving a patch on top with the thread.  They worked steadily through the socks in the basket until the pile was finished.
‚ÄúJames!‚Äù The man exclaimed, clapping him on the back.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been too long.  Looking for another suit?  Need something to impress the ladies?  You know I‚Äôm running at least a few weeks behind without my overlock machine working right.  Those jerks over at the store where I bought it won‚Äôt fix their own damn machine.‚Äù
Tony opened his mouth to protest, suddenly feeling very wrong footed, but Bucky waved away any response he might have made.  ‚ÄúIf he gets TB, he‚Äôll die from it.  You‚Äôll see, if you stick around long enough for him to get pneumonia.‚Äù
When Tony landed the Iron Man suit in Stuttgart, Steve had a hard time keeping his eyes off the arc reactor.  The glass panel in the chest plate seemed to block the blue haze of the light he remembered so clearly, and Steve wanted to dismantle it to inspect the disc below.  Was it the same one?  Or was this a different version?  The picture on the front of Tony‚Äôs Shield file was indistinct with a round cutout on the chest plate, but this armor had clearly been upgraded, the cutout now triangular.  Steve forced himself to look away, to not stare, especially with Loki nearby, watching everything they did.  He flexed his hands in his gloves, feeling the leather move over his skin, as he tried to forget how Tony‚Äôs warm hand had felt over his, the metal casing warm under his fingertips, the smooth glass.  When he closed his eyes, he still saw the way the blue light came up through his fingers.
Tony found himself in the hallway alone, soap in one hand and the towel in the other.  He looked back at the door, just barely open as promised.  ‚ÄúDamn it, Loki,‚Äù he whispered to himself.  He made his way down the hallway to the common bath, where a tub sat towards the wall on the tiled floor with a chair to one side and a sink to the other.  Everything looked in need of a good scrub ‚Äî or maybe just fewer people using it every day.  There were four apartments on the floor, and Tony guessed that anywhere between eight to fourteen people or more might use it on any given day.
Silence followed, and Steve looked up to find Natasha gaping at him, shock clear on her face.  ‚ÄúIf you two ever get your act together and stop arguing about socks long enough to have a real, honest conversation, the rest of us are in big trouble,‚Äù she said after a long pause.
‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so, Stark.  I know you‚Äôre used to working alone.  Perhaps you could use a little perspective.  A little more understanding.  An opportunity to get to know your teammates a little better.‚Äù
Bucky introduced Tony briefly to his parents, but all he took away from it was the impression of a short woman with curly brown hair and her son‚Äôs gray eyes and a tall muscular man with bright blue eyes and Bucky‚Äôs build, both of whom were friendly and tearful.  Tony stayed by the gravesite, waiting for Steve to come back, when Bucky told him he was going to ride home with his parents.
The state of their kitchen made Tony profoundly uncomfortable, and he regretted rummaging through their cabinets.  He had understood, intellectually, that the Depression was hard, but it was a completely different matter to find the evidence here in front of him.  He‚Äôd seen pictures of Steve before the serum: old black and white photos of a skinny guy with no muscle, dwarfed in his Army uniform and helmet.  But it had never occurred to him that the pictures actually made Steve look
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know what I have,‚Äù Steve answered, and a bit of the challenge was back.
And maybe, if he were lucky, if he worked to wear down Tony‚Äôs sharp edges, this Tony might come to resemble his.
Natasha blew out her breath, exasperated.  ‚ÄúYou could talk to him.‚Äù
He filled the sink up with cold water and stripped out of his long-sleeved shirt and gray undershirt, both of which were dirty and sweaty.  The arc reactor glowed reassuringly from his chest, and Tony couldn‚Äôt help but tap his fingers against it.  He did his best to rinse out his shirts, making as much lather as he could with the soap in the water.  He cleaned them and hung them over the edge of the tub, hoping they would dry quickly.
"My mother, though,‚Äù he continued, his voice gentler.¬† ‚ÄúI loved her and miss her every day.¬† She loved Christmas ‚Äî we would go every Sunday during Advent to light a candle to Saint Joseph.¬† She would ask him to intercede for happiness in our family, as well as happiness for my life and my future family.‚Äù¬† Pulling the blanket even tighter, Tony grimaced, the expression made harsh by the sharp contrast between light and shadow.¬† ‚ÄúYou can see how well that worked out,‚Äù he added bitterly.
‚ÄúHelen,‚Äù Steve broke in.  ‚ÄúHer name is Helen.‚Äù
, fighting against the British Empire for her country.
Some of his thoughts must have shown on his face, because Steve‚Äôs expression shuttered a little when he sat down and handed over Tony‚Äôs drink.  ‚ÄúThinking about before?‚Äù he asked softly, his eyes meeting Tony‚Äôs, his gaze steady.
Later, Bucky and Tony had talked about the construction of the Hoover Dam and its significance.  Tony had given impassioned lectures, complete with schematics, about how the dam generated hydroelectricity using the 17 turbines churning within the concrete and steel, providing electricity to Nevada, Arizona, and California, and how, in 1939, it was the largest hydroelectric installation in the world.  Bucky had been enthralled, and they had made a pact to see it together one day, as neither one had ever been to either the Grand Canyon or the Hoover Dam.  Steve had even done a series of drawings for Bucky based on pictures depicting the canyon and the river, the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.
It was as though the song and the scent had unlocked something in Steve; the buildings rose up around them like the walls of a sanctuary, the stars above their heads the vaulted ceilings.¬† They came onto the main street between the Rand building and the provisions store.¬† Glancing to the side as they crossed, it was like Steve was looking towards the nave, where the congregation should be seated.  The feeling of Christmas mass, of the hushed expectation right before the priest started the liturgy, made Steve freeze in the middle of the street.  Looking the other direction, Steve had to blink for a moment, the image of an altar with the aspe behind superimposed over the wooden buildings and the dirt road.¬† Bowing his head, Steve felt the silence settled over him, and he had to resist the urge to genuflect there.
‚ÄúRight,‚Äù was her only answer.
Steve froze at that.  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he finally managed to answer.  His voice was low, and even he could hear the warning in it.
That led to another understanding that left Tony reeling more than Bucky‚Äôs menacing presence.
Jarvis warned him that Tony was on his way up, but Steve felt too exhausted, too overwhelmed, to even turn around when the elevator doors opened.  He heard Tony cross the room and felt him come to stand behind him.
‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Howard asked, peering down at Steve where he was lying on the gantry of Dr. Erskine‚Äôs capsule.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look so hot, pal.‚Äù
And it still wasn‚Äôt enough.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Bucky broke in.  ‚ÄúYour sewing machine.  Tony said he can fix most anything, and I‚Äôm tired of hearing you complain about it.  Why don‚Äôt you let him take a look?  He fixes it, you make him a suit and maybe an extra pair of pants.‚Äù
Steve shuddered, a chill going down his spine.¬† He grabbed Tony‚Äôs arm and hauled him close, and Tony blinked, startled, at the sudden violent movement.¬† Tony‚Äôs breath was warm on Steve‚Äôs skin, the sharp smell of the alcohol acrid in the air between them as Steve inhaled what Tony exhaled.¬† Steve could see the reflection of the moon in Tony‚Äôs irises as they darted back and forth, focusing first on his right eye and then his left.
With nowhere to be and nothing to do, he found himself at an outside cafe across the street from Grand Central Station more often than not, sketching out the lines of Stark Tower.  Part of him ‚Äî a crazy part, he readily admitted ‚Äî thought about just walking into the lobby and asking to see Tony.  But it was no less crazy than waking up to a future where everything was unrecognizable and he was a legend, a superhero ‚Äî most easily recognized in comic books and movies, TV shows and toys, biographies and footnotes in histories about World War II.
His legs gave out, and Steve collapsed onto the bed next to Tony.  He wanted nothing more than to pull him close to his chest, as if that could keep him from disappearing again.  They watched the numbers together as they rose, Tony taking calm, deep breaths next to Steve, while Steve‚Äôs breathing came sharp and ragged, short breaths he shrugged to control.
From the time Tony brought home the news until the funeral mass and burial, Steve did almost nothing of his own initiative.  Bucky and Tony took turns sitting with him, but he mostly just lay on the bed, motionless, turned towards the wall.  Occasionally, he moved to the couch, wrapping himself in the afghans thrown over the back.  The packet of Sarah‚Äôs belongings remained untouched on the kitchen table, and as far as Tony knew, Steve barely drank and ate nothing.
Steve went to the Sutro Baths at Lands End and put his feet in the Pacific beneath the Cliff House for his ma, who had always wanted to dip her feet in both oceans, although he regretted the decision as soon as he felt the cold water between his toes.
At least, he was for 73 days after the Battle of New York.  One by one, each of his systems began to fail.  He needed a ventilator to breathe.  He needed medications to keep his blood pressure up.  He needed dialysis because his kidneys didn‚Äôt work.  He needed IV nutrition because his intestines wouldn‚Äôt move things through.  He became jaundiced because his liver failed.  He needed platelets because his bone marrow wouldn‚Äôt make the factors he needed for his blood to clot, and he needed antibiotics because his body couldn‚Äôt fight infections.  He almost died multiple times, the hospital staff having to pound on his chest and give him epinephrine to restart his heart.
‚ÄúTony, you gotta stop doing this,‚Äù Steve said.  There was moisture gathering under the cheeks of   his helmet, and Steve knew he was only a few seconds from a complete breakdown.  ‚ÄúJarvis, can you open the helmet?  Or the whole suit?  Or something?‚Äù He could hear the pitch in his voice increasing with each plea, hysteria creeping in at the edges of his awareness.  Steve pulled out his comm so no one else on the team would hear and ripped off his gloves.  He put his bare hand over the glass that should have shown the arc reactor, like he had so many years ago.
‚ÄúI need to know,‚Äù he said, surprised at the hoarseness in his voice.
He unlocked the apartment, and the door opened into a small kitchen with some cabinets and a counter along the inside wall forming a corner with another partial wall that divided the kitchen from whatever was on the side.  In the corner was the sink, and across the room was a coal fired boiler.  There was a window at the end of the kitchen, overlooking the street below, and a small room with a closed door on the other side of the partial wall that Tony assumed was the toilet.  In the open space across from the counter and partial wall was a table with four mismatched chairs pushed underneath and some letters on top.
Steve took a deep breath to steady himself.  ‚ÄúNo.  Tony took a hit to the chest,‚Äù
‚ÄúI certainly got the message that you don‚Äôt, at least not any more,‚Äù Natasha answered.
Tony surprised Steve by backpedaling.  ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm wrong.‚Äù
The quinjet dropped them some distance away from the giant, and they all fell into their roles.  Hulk and Clint worked on containment, trying to drive it towards the lake, with Steve and Natasha a little farther out on the periphery in case it suddenly changed directions or behaviors.  Tony was in the air, watching from above.  Steve glanced up, his eyes following the bright red of Tony‚Äôs suit, when a burst of green light caught his eye.  He turned, the banter on the comms fading.  ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù he cut them off, ‚ÄúLoki‚Äôs near the Bethesda Fountain.  Where we sent him back with Thor.‚Äù
So he decided that he would carry them one last place, to the end of the line: the Grand Canyon.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll see how I feel after the shower,‚Äù Steve answered before disappearing into the stairwell.
Tony tipped his head to the side, obviously confused.¬† He reached for the bottle of whiskey again and took a long drink from it.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand you,‚Äù he said, his voice hoarse from the burn of the alcohol.¬† ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to arrest me?¬† Put me in the cell?¬† For being drunk and disorderly?‚Äù¬† Tony gestured angrily with the bottle towards the door leading to the front of the building, where there were two cells with the courtroom beyond.¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù he said, the irritation clear in his voice.
Pepper and Rhodey and the rest of the Avengers never came to visit, which hurt more than Tony cared to admit, and Tony was going to fire that doctor because he should have had some Zosyn by now.  Who was he kidding ‚Äî he wouldn‚Äôt fire the guy.  Just maybe hack into his account and change his Netflix password.
The doctor sat down and placed a hand on Tony‚Äôs knee.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù he started.
He knew what he needed to do.
Steve filled the tub with hot water and sat in it, soaping himself up, when Bucky burst in, pale with fear in his eyes.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Steve challenged, getting out of the tub and dripping water all over the floor.¬† He grabbed the towel and wrapped himself in it when Bucky clutched his upper arm.
Steve looked away from her, shame-faced.  He opened his palm on the glass, feeling the cold smooth surface under his hand.
A desolate sob came from Tony, and Steve could feel the wetness of his tears on his abdomen through the thin fabric of his undershirt, Tony‚Äôs hot breath made damp.¬† Steve gently scratched at Tony‚Äôs scalp as Tony cried silently, his face pressed against Steve.¬† It crossed Steve‚Äôs mind that Tony must be used to crying noiselessly to be so good at it.
Natasha tucked her hand in the crook of Steve‚Äôs arm and led him back to the couch.  She settled in the corner, still nestled in her blanket, and pulled him down, his head against her thigh.  She gently scratched at his scalp with her nails.  ‚ÄúYou loved him,‚Äù she then said, no question in her tone.
Bucky turned just before he got to the door to the apartment.¬† ‚ÄúFunny,‚Äù he said, his soft voice carrying back to Steve in the quiet hallway, ‚Äúyou never used to talk like this before your ma died and Tony disappeared.‚Äù
The capsule opened, and Steve stumbled out, almost falling.  His voice was hoarse and his throat sore, and he felt sweat all over his body, the muscles trembling and breath coming fast.   People swarmed around him, but he felt removed, completely separate from them as though his ma, Bucky, and Tony surrounded him, keeping them at arm‚Äôs length.
And finally, Steve thought of Tony.¬† He thought of the things Tony had said, when he was sick and didn‚Äôt know what he was saying.¬† Of Steve saving the world, of his watching over Tony and protecting him.¬† He‚Äôd never understood what Tony was seeing then, but he could see the conviction in Tony‚Äôs eyes, that Tony had believed it with every fiber of his being.
They sat in companionable silence, broken up by Tony‚Äôs wheezing, until the water was tepid and Tony was starting to shiver.  Tony was so weak he struggled to stand on his own, and Steve braced his arms to help him up without slipping.  He wrapped Tony in a towel and did most of the work drying off, as even that made Tony short of breath.
Tony was quiet for a long time after that, and Steve‚Äôs mind drifted away.¬† He drowsed, the echoes of chanting in Latin and Christmas hymns filling the air around him.¬† The vibration of Tony‚Äôs breathing rumbled through him, reminiscent of the huge pipe organ he‚Äôd seen at St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral in Dublin.¬† He could feel his hand clenched in his mother‚Äôs, both at the Cathedral and on the docks, before they‚Äôd boarded the ship that had brought them to America.¬† He dimly was aware of Tony‚Äôs breath on his skin, the soft question again:¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù¬† But the emotion behind the words was too hard to grasp and Steve‚Äôs mind too far afield ‚Äî in St. Patrick‚Äôs, or the cottage in the Irish countryside where he‚Äôd grown up, or on the battlefield at Gettysburg ‚Äî for him to parse the words, let alone respond.
Steve longed to turn on all the overhead lights to look at the color of Tony‚Äôs skin.  Even in the glare of the monitor and the reflected lights of Manhattan from the window, Steve could pick out the flush of red over his cheeks, the faint gleam of sweat at his hairline.  Steve forced himself to remember that this Tony was healthier ‚Äî he wasn‚Äôt malnourished from months of eating during the Depression, and he trained daily with either Happy or one of the Avengers to stay in fighting shape.  This Tony did the heavy lifting in his workshop and drank protein shakes offered by Dum-E even when he was too busy to eat.  He had fresh fruit and vegetables, the finest restaurants New York could offer, and Pepper and Jarvis kept a sharp eye on him when Tony was being neglectful of his own health.
He wanted the calm, and the cold, and the blue water as far as the eye could see.
He lay on Bucky‚Äôs bed in his boxers for a long time, watching the lights from the alley and the street play across the ceiling.  He hadn‚Äôt bothered putting a new shirt on once he‚Äôd gotten back to the bedroom, as the apartment was hot and stuffy.  He saw the lights shift when Steve soundlessly pushed open the door.  Tony expected him to go to his own bed, but instead he came to Tony‚Äôs and jostled him over so they lay on their sides, facing each other.
The wood popped again, and Steve could have sworn he smelled vanilla and saffron.¬† Just as he had outside, he felt the press of two people behind him: his ma off his right shoulder and someone else, another woman, off his left.¬† The smell of bergamot filled his nose, mingling with the vanilla, with some kind of spice Steve didn‚Äôt recognize.¬† He was close enough to Tony to feel him suddenly stiffen, and Steve watched him intentionally relax his hands, spreading them over his thighs.
Steve scrambled to his feet and rushed across the apartment, the sketchbook and pen forgotten on the floor.  He thundered down the stairs to Natasha‚Äôs apartment and banged on the door until she opened it.
‚ÄúCamel cigarette ad,‚Äù Steve answered, brushing some of the charcoal off his hands.  ‚ÄúBuck says it‚Äôs a travesty, but he only likes Luckys.  I do the people.  They usually get someone else to do packaging and lettering.‚Äù
‚ÄúI think I do.‚Äù  Steve‚Äôs hand came up to his chest, and Natasha saw him rub at his dog tags before slipping his fingers under the hem of the neckline to worry at the chain.  His shoulders hunched up, and she could see the tightness in his arms and across his back as the strain pulled the cotton of his shirt tight.
Natasha shrugged.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm simply making an observation.  Not a judgment.  And how long were you alone in this previous life you‚Äôre showing me?  You never knew your father because he died before you were born ‚Äî don‚Äôt look at me like that, we just visited his grave, and I can do the math,‚Äù she said peevishly.  ‚ÄúYou lived with your mother until you moved in with James‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúWe should probably let him sleep for a while,‚Äù Bucky ventured.  ‚ÄúI need to go to work, but I‚Äôm afraid to leave him alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust trying to get a workout in,‚Äù Steve answered noncommittally.
Steve knew he couldn‚Äôt make himself do that.
He heard the rustle of the bedding as Tony shifted position and his response of, ‚ÄúSure, if you prefer.‚Äù  Steve leaned back in his chair, looking up at the tiles of the drop ceiling.  He could hear the hesitation in Tony‚Äôs voice when he said, ‚ÄúSleep well, I guess,‚Äù and clicked off the lights.
Steve saw his shoulders shake a little, and he walked over to put a hand between Bucky‚Äôs shoulder blades, gently rubbing there.¬† ‚ÄúHe said the Navy Yard already knows ‚Äî they told them earlier today.¬† I have one more week there, and then another week to get my affairs in order,‚Äù he continued, echoing the phrase the official had used.¬† Bucky‚Äôs shoulders slumped down, and he scrubbed a hand over his face, the other still braced on the table.
Steve stood up and crossed back over to the window.  He looked back over the city as Ella‚Äôs voice swept over him, her deep rich tones soothing something within him, helping it to loosen.  As he listened to the music, he thought of those hot summer days in the tenement apartment with the radio on, after Tony had fixed it.  It wasn‚Äôt the same as the music he‚Äôd listened to on those long, glorious days, but it wasn‚Äôt all that different.
His enhanced hearing picked up her pause on the plush carpet, the sound of her bare feet against it when she turned back to face him.  ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù she said, and even though her voice was pitched low, Steve flinched, her voice filling up the apartment, surrounding him and ringing in his ears.
in the 70 years he‚Äôd been frozen?  Had all those men died in vain on the fields of Europe in the 40s?
Steve pulled off his dog tags and put the St. Monica medal in Tony‚Äôs hand, curling his own fingers around Tony‚Äôs to keep it there.  He prayed to every saint he knew, murmuring the Hail Mary and the Glory Be, the Our Father and the Final Prayer.  He prayed to his ma and to Bucky.  He prayed to Jarvis and Dr. Erskine, to Peggy and Howard, that someone would intervene.
with.‚Äù
At that piece of information, everyone would look at Tony thoughtfully, and he could already see them running through a list of appliances that weren‚Äôt working correctly that Tony might be able to help with.  Bucky would then drop into the conversation that Tony was staying with him and Steve for the foreseeable future before saying he had to head to work and it was nice to catch up.
Steve drew deep breaths in, his back still to Tony.¬† The room was warm and felt safe to him, in contrast to the cold air outside.¬† It was still the deep of night ‚Äî well after midnight with a few hours left until the sun started to rise.¬† There were thousands of questions that Steve wanted to ask ‚Äî why Tony seemed to want to be thrown into the cell; why he was so resistant to a little comfort, like life wasn‚Äôt hard enough as it was; what was so difficult to face about December 16th that he‚Äôd rather spend it with Steve, arrested and in a cell, than face it alone in the back of his shop, where he seemed to prefer to spend most of his days.¬† His heart ached for Tony, and he could feel the echoes of his loneliness in the expression on Tony‚Äôs face, his inability to settle, his need to push boundaries.
She stirred when he sat up, rubbing at his eyes and shielding them from the light pouring in the northern windows, slanting from east to west across the floor.  Her hair floated around her head like a frizzy halo, and she had a crease in one cheek from a wrinkle in the pillow she‚Äôd shoved under her head.
Warmth bloomed in Tony‚Äôs chest, and he felt something release, something that had been wound too tight for too long.  ‚ÄúShould have told me sooner,‚Äù he answered.  He wrapped his arms around Steve‚Äôs neck, pulling him down.  Their lips slotted together, and Tony felt more than heard Steve sigh, his arms tightening around Tony.
Steve looked at his three sketches, of the three people he loved most in the world.  Under the light of the moon and the stars, he dug a small hole near the water‚Äôs edge.  He folded the three sheets of paper together into a small, tight square and placed it in the hole, covering it with the red dirt.  He built a small cairn out of rocks over it.  He sat for a long time next to it, looking out over the dark water flowing past, on its way to the Gulf of California.  He cried silently, the wet tracks on his face shining silver in the moonlight.  He cried for the things he‚Äôd lost ‚Äî for his friends and family, for the loneliness that had enveloped him since he‚Äôd woken up, for the desolation of being a soldier without a war, a man without a purpose.
When Bucky woke up a little later, Steve wordlessly shoved the poster at him as he shuffled sleepily from the bedroom to the toilet.¬† He paused, suddenly more awake.¬† Bucky gestured with the poster, his tone little affronted.¬† ‚ÄúDo you think ‚Äî?‚Äù he started, shaking the piece of paper a little.
Steve jerked away, his dog tags pulling out of her grasp.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
‚ÄúSurprise,‚Äù Steve said, spreading his hands wide.  ‚ÄúGuess the history books missed a few things.  For what it‚Äôs worth, my best friend was also a Jew.‚Äù
Steve glanced back, following Tony‚Äôs gesture.  ‚ÄúSure.  I‚Äôm supposed to have this done to submit tomorrow, so I need to finish it up anyway.‚Äù
He could sense Tony‚Äôs hesitation as he tried to figure out where Steve was going with this, ever the futurist, as he tried to head off any potential disaster.  Of course, he had no way of knowing the disaster had already happened.
The trail descended 5740 feet through Roaring Creek Canyon, and he took comfort in the greenery that was sometimes present along the trail.  He hiked over wooden bridges and wondered at the water that rushed down towards the Colorado River.  He moved more slowly than he needed to with the serum, taking his time to enjoy the scenery, to reflect on the journey.
Telling Tony about how he didn‚Äôt know how to get back up after something like that.
It was a beautiful, crisp fall day in New York City ‚Äî the kind where the sky was a perfect blue, cloudless between the skyscrapers.  The trees were a riot of oranges and reds and yellows, a handful of their leaves still punctuated with green at the bases, fluttering in the gentle breeze blowing down 5th Avenue.  The afternoon itself was warm, but it held the promise of a cool night to follow, a nip in the air for the nose and fingertips of those still hoping for enough summer to have left their jackets at home.
‚ÄúThat sounds about right,‚Äù Tony answered.  ‚ÄúCome to bed and let me help you forget for a bit.‚Äù
It was Bucky who answered.  ‚ÄúIt was his ma‚Äôs,‚Äù he said quietly, making Tony look over at him.  ‚ÄúHe couldn‚Äôt bear to part with it, even if it didn‚Äôt work.  She made the afghans too.‚Äù
Tony felt his stomach drop.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre clearly a group of high-functioning, very well adjusted, very dangerous adults who happen to live in the same place.  It‚Äôs practically
The man who was with him ‚Äôtil the end of the line.
‚Äú‚Äî and you lived with him until he shipped out.  Apparently with Tony for a few months.  Then you went to Camp LeHigh.  Even after you became Captain America, you still toured with those chorus girls and the guy who played Hitler.  And then you joined the Howling Commandos, who you were with until the day you put the Valkyrie in the water,‚Äù  Natasha finished.  ‚ÄúAnd then you wake up here, in your empty apartment and go on your solitary road trip.‚Äù
Bucky was right ‚Äî he should have told Tony sooner.
Tony had one hand tangled in Steve‚Äôs hair, and he slid his phone out of his pocket with his free one, taking care not to disturb Steve, whose breathing had finally evened out.  One-handed, he typed out a quick request to Jarvis before setting his phone aside on the coffee table.  The soft sounds of reeds filtered through the speakers, the muted horns coming in behind with the drumset anchoring the orchestra.  Tony then fell asleep to the sounds of
‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be saving the world?‚Äù Tony asked him one day.  Or maybe it was night.  It was hard to tell with the gray skies dumping snow onto the city during the day and the night sky washed out into the same gray from the streetlights reflected in the fallen snow.
Steve found him behind the provisions store and the Barnes‚Äôs cabin.¬† Stark had a bottle in one hand, his arms flung open and his head tipped back as he yelled ‚ÄúRejoice!¬† Rejoice!‚Äù up into the sky, dressed only in a pair of pants and an undershirt.  Steve couldn‚Äôt help but notice his tone missed merry by a long shot and fell somewhat closer to melancholy.
Tony stood, and Steve rose with him, his eyes wide and a little wild.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù Tony said, gesturing with the socks.  ‚ÄúYou can buy as many pairs of socks as you want.  Hell, you can fill up your closet with them for all I care.‚Äù  He crossed the room towards the island that separated the kitchen from the living area, with Steve following close behind him.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain in the kitchen,‚Äù Tony said in response to Steve‚Äôs now stony expression.
Closing his eyes, he let go of his dog tags and covered his face with his hands.  All he could see was the gray pallor of Tony‚Äôs skin as he alternated between shivering and sweating through the sheets on the narrow bed, twisted up in the blankets as he tossed and turned.  He could hear the rattling of Tony‚Äôs breath echo in his ears, the fitful coughing and wheezing.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs harder to believe when I‚Äôve already watched it once,‚Äù Steve said, his voice muffled by his hands.
The laugh was quieter from Tony this time, and they lapsed into silence.  They drove on, the lights of Las Vegas shimmering in the distance even in the middle of the afternoon.  ‚ÄúIt kind of feels like he‚Äôs with us,‚Äù Tony offered, glancing back over to Steve.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so bad,‚Äù she conceded.  ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm surprised ‚Äî I thought you would have preferred to go back.‚Äù
feel uneasy in such close proximity with Tony.¬† He could smell the alcohol as Tony breathed in and out, the sound carrying in the quiet, but he could also smell the faint hint of sweat and smoke and metal that always followed the inventor, as well as the pomade he used on his mustache and hair.¬† Steve felt goosebumps ripple along his arms again, and he turned back to the stove.¬† Using a reed, he lit a kerosene lamp.¬† Tony‚Äôs eyes followed him, his gaze a palpable touch on his face and the skin at the base of his throat, where it was visible above his partially unbuttoned shirt.
That earned him a more genuine smile from Bucky, which Tony wasn‚Äôt expecting.  ‚ÄúHeard the whole thing, did you?‚Äù
Steve shook his head.  He wanted to yell at Tony, to let out the sudden rage at all of this, the entire ridiculous situation.  Steve could see it play out: he would stand up and scream at Tony, tell him how he went back in time and
His hand came up between them, and Tony nodded, his eyes tracking the movement before looking into Steve‚Äôs.  Steve traced the metal casing, warm from Tony‚Äôs skin, a little sticky from the salt of his sweat.  The air came out of him in a rush as he covered the arc reactor, relief and joy crashing over him like a wave, carrying him under.  He leaned his forehead against Tony‚Äôs and closed his eyes, glass and metal and cotton under his hands, the smell of Tony ‚Äî salt and sweat and coconut and Ivory soap ‚Äî in his nose, the ghost of Tony‚Äôs breath on his face and neck.
‚ÄúThe giant is gone,‚Äù Nat‚Äôs voice came from the speakers in Tony‚Äôs suit, ‚Äúand Jarvis is telling me that Loki is too.  Did you guys see what happened?‚Äù
He could feel the activity in the kitchen slowly come to a halt.  It was like the feeling he got when he used to pick fights before the serum, when he knew what he had to do and the other guy was still going to kick his ass for it.  Time slowed in that moment, and he could see the trajectory of it, knowing what he was going to say, knowing what the other guy was going to do, which usually involved hitting him, knocking him down until either Bucky came or the other guy was satisfied he‚Äôd made his point.  Things were moving slowly, but like every fight he‚Äôd ever gotten into, it was already beyond his control when he realized what was going on, what was going to happen.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what you mean,‚Äù Steve heard himself say.  ‚ÄúDo you not want me here?‚Äù
Something about this version of Tony didn‚Äôt seem right to Steve either.  He was more brittle, more defensive.  There was a big difference between the man Steve had found scraped up in an alley and this one.  Steve could sense the discomfort, the anxiety that seemed to run through him like a live wire, especially when they interacted.  It wound Steve up too, as much as he tried to not to react to it.  But something was clearly bothering Tony, and that always got Steve going, even that first time he‚Äôd met Tony so long ago.
But now?¬† He wouldn‚Äôt even have Bucky.
Steve shuffled around the edge of the hospital bed, taking care not to walk into the corner of it in the dark.  He stood at the foot, just watching.  The monitor was pointed towards the door, and Steve watched as the blue line of the saturations rose and fell evenly with Tony‚Äôs heartbeat like waves on a beach.  He stood there a long time, watching the light from the window shift across the room as the traffic moved through the city and lights flickered on and off.  The pitch from the pulse oximeter slowly crept up, keeping pace with the numbers as they went from 93% to 96%.  He could see Tony‚Äôs chest gently rise and fall in the dim light, the small whuff carrying across the room when Tony exhaled.  Every once in a while, Tony would shift, finding a more comfortable position for an arm or a leg.  One hand always remained over the arc reactor, the fingers splayed out with the light shining between them.
well. he‚Äôs gonna have my phone in a few seoncds so hold tighet fuckers

I hate him
idk an alternative
[10:26 pm]

ye I thought so lmao
its only because you literally do not have one
thanks. Kid was getting worried
I am past the stage of fatigue into no longer being tired.

i can't tell if that's thor throwing shade at tony or genuinely asking
fuck off pixels.
???????

if DP rats me out like that I‚Äôll kill him
Falcon Punch > Arm Yourself:
a mental image I would have preferred to live without tbh
that‚Äôs just the best.
anyway, im here to say that thor is considering asking bruce out.
he clearly dyes his hair black, right?
This is a pleasant surprise
but before that, I asked him ‚Äúnever have I ever had a crush on someone in our group‚Äù and steeb doesn‚Äôt count bc hes my boyfriend. And he was to do a shot for each crush if he did.
: im not quite sure it distracted but hey at least clint got to his room without having to see the hot dude who didn't see the boner. I have no idea who hes talking about since every male here looks quite attractive
fuck you talking bout bitch, im smooth as fuck.
like, im ok being on the sidelines if it means theyre all safe, plus with my vocal tics I‚Äôd give our positions away n stuff. Steve talked to me about it, but we both knew I couldn‚Äôt be on field

It was me.
also bc jane thought u might be gay for him, gave me said evidence and broke it off with u so that you could sort out your feelings without feeling like u need to be straight to be with her
wat the fuck is ot3? Isnt that the fic site?
1. i knew you would if i didn/t 2. you would get caught and fury would be fury-ous and 3. im highkey terrified of you and dont particularly want a falcon coming to my dorm at like half one in the morning

unfortunately, pietro looks uncannily like me. And we both hate Loki. And each other (love u babe)
u two and that fucking guardian.
All I did was ask how everyone was
u are quite literally satan spawn
I usually do, and like thor, you‚Äôre usually not looking at me when I do.
wake up motherfuckers it's time to shine
well. Im sure thor saw Pietro and bucky kiss ages ago at the party. Wanda and Nat know but I think that‚Äôs it?
I mean taht's one way to go about your first conversation with strangers and their weird gay mascot you met and he totally didn't pop a boner when he met you.
u even have stans n they don‚Äôt know what u look like or who u are or what u do
couldn‚Äôt imagine what its like to live with them on a daily basis
make clint flaunt it instead
when should I go back to my flat?
that was smooth ngl
hey man how‚Äôs the bird boy
alert the medics clit got hurt
I don‚Äôt understand how u were so dead silent wtf
nat, if u think it‚Äôll help, u can come help. But no one else. Itll overwhelm clint.

Clint accidentally let slip that you‚Äôre both dating him and I want you hopeless gays to know that if you hurt him, there will be nothing left of you to be buried.
you were so much work but it paid off
honestly did not notice the typo. Just thought clint was snorting some ccircus crack or smth
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee u are not ready for the shit I got planned for us today
Both pietro and pixels blocked me. What did I do wrong?

Brucie is tired and says weird shit when hes tired.
Did you just break through our fucking wall?
I think you‚Äôve just killed him.
ther was another but the last one was Thor and he took the biggest fucking shot for it, but before he did, he fucking sai its bc hes just so fucking gone for thor that he might as well just knock himself out from alcohol and wake up in Valhalla or something like that
u and ned)
she sounds evil I lov her
friend, just turn off ur laptop and let me and tony fix it
but anyway, im glad you‚Äôre feeling better man! If you want, we can stick magnets to bucky‚Äôs arm and draw on steve‚Äôs shield
he said that thor and bruce ought to do like a workout regime or whatever and then thor can get gayer from seeing bruce actually being surprisingly stronger than anticipated.

what would happen if we threw Quill, Parker, Lensherr and Maximoff into a room and made them fight for the ultimate peter name
