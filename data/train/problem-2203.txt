Afterwards, there came the hardest nut to crack. New Scotland Yard.
He bowed his head forward after this, rocking along sleepily. His hands hung limply between his knees.
“Well… maybe “bonhomme” is a better term? He is bonhomme?”
Instead of an answer, Sherlock rose from the floor with a shiny leather Oxford shoe in hand. He leaned against bars as I did before him and raising his long arm, he neatly took the set of keys off their hook using the shoe like some sort of a big spoon in which the keys remained safely caught. Accomplishing this feat as if it was no big deal, he pulled his shoe-holding hand back out of the trellis and handed me his catch with only the tiniest hint of smugness apparent in the corners of his mouth.
I started, my fingers clinched painfully into the folds of my coat. This has to be a joke, right?
John reciprocates and they are soon engaged in very hot activities there. Sherlock, devious and slippery as an eel, tries to gain an upper hand over John at first, but the soldier anticipates every single one of his strategies in this battle and skilfully manages to overpower him. He gently places Sherlock on his belly and secures both of his arms in a firm grip of his hands. He then mounts Sherlock from behind, eager with anticipation.
And in a state of near panic, he undid his zip and started to tear down his belt, trying to get out of his trousers as quickly as possible. He kept cursing the innocent bivalve with gusto, while John flung back his head and laughed uproariously.
The officer nodded in the bout of obeisance, still, he raised a careful objection right away: “Monsieur Holmes, I would still be forced to take this gentleman, Authié, to the station. He must be questioned on the matter as soon as possible.”
And she collapsed on the spot.
”The owner of the restaurant is local, served as a postman in the vicinity before opening the business here after retirement. The cook is an Italian, through. Came into UK through Erasmus and ended up marrying a local girl, a daughter of the owner. Saw a lucky chance in joining the business of his English in-laws, since Brighton is full of tourists and a local fare pales in comparison with Italian cuisine. Was successful, put on 20 pounds in three years and had two children with his wife – probably that woman we see in the framed picture over the counter.” Sherlock rattles off a long string of his deductions nonchalantly.
Disturbed to a high degree, I stepped into the room.
Occasional flashes of cameras and non-stop dim of whispering voices finally ceased and the crowd slowly dispersed. Only one or two individuals approached DI to ask him further questions.
“Hey! He’s telling you the truth! Let him go!” I screamed in terror from the other side of the room.
After the busy whirlwind day, after the night full of the most pleasant exertion, he believed he would sleep like a log until noon. But that harsh raucous noise is making any slumber impossible now: the sound of Sherlock snoring loudly into his ear.
Sherlock hastily handed her his batiste handkerchief. She thanked him plaintively and dabbed the corners of her eyes with it, alarming the chickens by the act.
“So that's what he is first and foremost, John. A Cathar.”
“Whoa!” John pressed his palm to his friend's chest in a swift motion. “No, don't leave! I didn't mean to insult you…”
I put Sherlock down to the soft grass and checked his pulse once again. Content with his state, I sat next to him cross-legged and leaned against the pole of the fence, grinning at the DI.
“Perhaps this will help you, monsieur.”
Two elderly ladies dressed in lacy black robes and sporting elaborate coiffures were busy nodding off inside, their gently snoring mouths being opened and closed almost in unison. Unwilling to be tricked, I checked their faces with utmost scrutiny, but they were definitely not my targets. I looked up at Sherlock again, shook my head dismissively and moved on.
We both startled at this announcement.
“Yes, John.” He replied, his whole countenance ablaze with triumph. “The case is now solved, I believe.”
“Well, what do you intent to do, then? Do you have a plan?”
“Madame Thibaut?” He addressed her deferentially. “You have told me earlier that you were a housekeeper in the house of the deceased. I couldn't help but notice that your employer was a Jesuit. Therefore, may I ask you…”
We landed by the impromptu pier made out of some cement cube rising from the river. The motor boat was anchored by the bollard there.
“No.” Sherlock admitted restlessly. “If it leaked to the public that Julian leads Cathar rites in secret, he would lose his position as professor and the scandal would most likely deprive him of both his reputation and his freedom. That's why it's so necessary to remove every damning document out of his house before the police comes snooping and turns it upside down.”
He abruptly inclines to John and kisses him, biting his lips passionately.
“You!” I gasped. “You are one of them, aren't you? That old guy at Rue de la Citadelle identified you correctly! You are of their elite! You are Perfect!”
THE END.
I frowned darkly at this insinuation. But Sherlock wasn’t offended, he merely shook his bandaged head: “No, I was completely mislead by their demand and fully believed that the crutch was the hiding-place for the stones. It was too late, only a little while before an explosion at the docks, that I realised my mistake and discerned where De Vries really placed them.”
The light-switch crackled somewhere to my right. And just like that, bright light flooded the entire area of the old hall.
It’s weird how things buried in our past resurface when we least expect it.
Our ride through Southwark was uneventful. In no time we found ourselves facing the romantic waters of Greenland Dock. We stood by the little bridge connecting two banks of the small side water-channel and thus two former rows of dock-houses which were rebuilt into apartment houses some time ago and which were now known as Finland Street.
Vernet opened his mouth in shock and threw his hands up in such a grand gesture that a waitress who carried us the food flinched and a serving tray loaded with bread and olive oil practically fell on the table between us. It didn't flip over, thank God, but it was a close call.
“So you didn't dispose of the gun after all.” He remarked, very much surprised.
„Really?” My eyebrows flew up to my hairline. “And how did you deduce that? Don't you want to enlighten me on that?”
I couldn’t agree more. The place was a site of former docks too, but long abandoned and dilapidated, full of shabby barracks and dubious cabins in various state of decay. Part of the area was cleared up for redevelopment and slightly resembled the surface of the moon with its barren landscape. Still, right next to it the dun buildings with blind windows towered over Thames – the very picture of some freaky nightmare.
I emitted a very dry, throaty cough.
Sherlock carefully positioned himself and looked at me. Very uneasy, but determined, I nodded in approval silently.
He made a sweeping gesture with his hand, preaching to me: “The Thriae, the trio of bee goddesses, gave Apollo the ability to interpret information obtained from signs in nature. Those bees in the form of nymphs were the ones who taught him the art of divination. Possessing their gifts, Apollo was able to actually predict the future and…”
Instead of a reply, she reached into the pocket of her dark green overcoat and pulled a piece of paper out of it, handing it to Sherlock.
Cargo ship explodes on Amstel! Ijsselbuurt in panic!
For a first few seconds, no response was coming. Only our own breath, so loud in the complete stillness around us, disturbed the cold night air.
“Ta.”
Basking in the intoxicating afterglow, he remains draped over Sherlock for a long while, pressing his sweaty forehead to Sherlock's elegant nape and trying to calm his breath. Still, his member is softening rapidly now and soon, he is forced to disengage, slipping out of his wet nesting place with regret.
John smiled thinly and scratched the area behind his ear absentmindedly: “All those things I said about Irene Adler… I take them back. I would not wish to have Adler around you. At all. I think… I think I'll manage the things she should be good at on my own.”
The house was on the more decorative side. It was a two storey building with the façade covered by elegant bossage, its horizontally banded rustication giving it the air of a noble abode. Quoins with long and short strips adorned both corners of the façade wall. One corbelled cornice separated the ground storey from the first floor, another, pronounced one, lined the edge of the roof. The roof was of the mansard type, with three gilded dormers glistening in the dark. Stone chambranles bordered four windows placed on the first floor, the top of each window sporting its own, neatly carved, cornice and a suprafenestra in the shape of Satyr's head. The ground floor was a bit simpler, showing us the dark door overhung with dropped keystone to our right – it probably lead to the courtyard – and the store front which monopolised the rest of the façade.
“Yes, I see them.” Sherlock nodded, sounding a bit grim all of a sudden. “It’s Silvertown then. They chose a very fitting location for their hiding place, don’t you think?”
An illustration of Hyacinthus in the bulky tome. Young boy’s body thrown into the dust, the stream of blood rolling down his skull and being thirstily sucked by the scorched earth underneath him.
“Don't move.” He growled at me again as he collected his bag and retreated to the open window. After that he turned his back on me and the moment the compartment door burst open, he jumped out on the rails running parallel to ours, recklessly disregarding his own safety.
”So what do you think, Sherlock,” inquires John who fiddles with a paper cup full of ale in his lap. “Do you hate marriage as strongly as before, now?”
“But there is a gun at the table next to him! And these people were obviously messing with the objects left in this room by the criminal! How do you explain that?”
“Marie! Marie!” The young waitress called her name and touched her face gently, full of worry and confusion.
Sensing that he has calmed down a bit, I clasped my arms around his waist and I held him tightly, burying my face into his cotton-clad chest.
The head of my companion whipped round with surprising speed... and met with the imposing sight of Sherlock Holmes who inaudibly opened the compartment door in between and was now standing in front of it with his hands crossed over his chest.
Sherlock stared at me with the annoyingly clear eyes, probably at a loss for words. Finally, he shrugged his shoulders: “Is it such a big deal for you that I was a Cathar, John? Why does that bother you so much? You know that as the members of the Established Church of England we would be considered heretics here anyway.”
“Excuse me, monsieur.” I tipped my hat in greeting and continued in a gruff tone to conceal my English accent: “Would you mind if I join you? I never expected the first class to be so full today and it seems your compartment is the only one with a bit of place left in it.”
“Guillaume!” A loud voice hollered behind our backs unexpectedly.
John found the stubborn mollusc without any big problem. It really got stuck there, behind the full, firm balls, in the most improbable nest possible. He gently extracted it and pulled it out of his friend's underwear, tittering like a teenager in the process.
I don't know how he got wind about Julian, but it's no doubt he hated him with a passion and he intended to uproot him and the Cathar heresy from the soil of Béziers once and for all.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders: “What I will say now is only a hypothesis, but I bet it won’t be far from the truth. In my opinion, De Vries refused to hand over the diamonds for some reason and was hiding from his former accomplices. He only agreed to meet one of them on a neutral ground and so they sent the oldest one, Murray, to negotiate with him and chose the private cubicle of the Eye as their meeting place. In theory, it should be the safest place possible, for it offered an absolute privacy there in the air and yet provided the clear view inside which theoretically prevented either of the men to turn violent.”
“Yes.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly but responded without hesitation. “Yes, I have.”
Calmed down by the discovery that he seemed to be safe and sound, I followed his gaze absent-mindedly.
”No.”
I squeezed the cup in my fingers tightly and bowed my head. We drunk out tea in tense silence after that and the long minutes stretched into eternity until Sherlock liberated me from the unpleasant situation by peeking into the kitchen and announcing that he is finished.
Accompanied by Inspecteur Principal Ganimard, Sherlock Holmes, the greatest detective of our age tensely awaited the arrival of the upcoming train there. He was Holmes for all of the world and Sherlock for me and me alone. Also, he became my lover as of late and kept this status for ten months and seventeen days for now.
“Well, can’t help it then. Tell Lestrade about this disaster yourself in the morning. Unfortunately, I can’t risk it to stay in London until that time. Or… can I borrow some pen and paper from you? I’ll leave Lestrade a message at least and explain the situation to him.”
No! No! No!
Vernet took a hefty gulp from the wine, cackled and started babbling something about big coincidences again, refusing to give up his secret. But he forgot in whose company he sits now.
It was too late for any festivities and we were all in the dumps a bit, so Vernet didn't even try to propose any night entertainment. He accommodated Didier in the saloon and then he led us upstairs, to the two-bed guest room. Discreet good-night, softly closed door, the subtle sound of the steps descending downwards – and soon, we were left alone.
I gulped around the big dumpling that has risen into my throat: “That's the real reason why I'm so afraid, I guess. You already knew some form of perfection, I guess. And I am an utterly imperfect man. I could never be an equivalent of that to you.”
Sherlock's lips twitched imperceptibly, but he didn't bother to grace my dig with further remark.
The body beneath my hands trembled lightly. The bastard was laughing!
Vernet didn't respond to that, he was just gnawing at the ends of his bushy moustache mutely.
The cheeky-looking youth, disturbed from reading by my shout, frowned at me in displeasure.
And so later that day, we found ourselves in the vicinity of Cathédrale Saint-Nazaire, at the gates of the town prison, accompanied by both Vernet and Didier.
DI answered the call, but having some problems with the signal here under ground, he lowered the phone onto his chest and addressed us: “I’ll go outside for a while. I hope we will be finished here when I return.”
“Tisane!” He mumbled, frowning in discontent.
And I was once again stuck with the feeling that Sherlock behaves very strangely all of a sudden. He never responded to my question, he just frowned at me, weirdly distracted.
The compartment housed the sole occupant this time. He was a fairly young man, lavishly dressed in an expensive tuxedo and an elegant pearl-grey overcoat and he was sporting a tall top-hat. His lively black eyes intensely scanned the newspaper spread out in front of him as a shield. The sensitive nostrils and neat, but underdeveloped muffs twitched in some triumphant gaiety and the full lips were stretched into a self-satisfied smile. Under his collar, a decorative pin held his bow-tie in place. Beautiful yellow chrysanthemum flower was pushed into the lapel buttonhole of his tuxedo and worn as a luxurious boutonnière, flashing at me like a small sun with every movement of its owner.
“Yes, I have a past. A past I didn't inform you about.” He said in a clipped tone. “But I can't see how I'm so different from you – John “Three Continents” Watson!”
As we entered, we found that little place to be empty. Vernet stood by the counter and rang at the service impatiently, but it took quite a while till the young waitress appeared from the adjoining room. She was that healthy, rustic type with endearingly round face, reddish cheeks and the blonde hair worn in a loose bun. She stared at us in somewhat breathless manner, her eyes dark and wide and she wiped her soot-covered hands into the towel convulsively. Sherlock's strange attire probably did that to her. You certainly don't see many people wearing a deerstalker and an Ulster coat in the vicinity of Béziers.
The Isles of Scilly put their astonishing beauty fully on display. Behind the whole-wall window, the chain of dark, rugged rocks and islets, the silver line of the beach and the stormy coloured sea bathed in the dazzling sunlight, the stunning effect resembling the painting of some classic landscape painter. It pulled him to the glass panel in an instant. He stood there for a minute, admiring the view with relish.
No reaction from Philip. Hypnotised by Sherlock’s presence, he watched him as in a trance, blind to everything around him.
“Merci, Guillaume.” He said softly. His large grey eyes flickered to me after that and crinkled at the corners in amusement: “And congratulations.”
His member stands at attention all of a sudden, glistening as if freshly oiled. His target, an enticing red orifice placed in marvellous symmetry between two luscious, milky-white buttocks, is still nicely stretched after workout that took place during the night. John doesn't hesitate. He nudges it with his tip, pressing half of his length into it at once.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows and blinked: “Pardon me?”
“So you have decided to double-cross me all the same.” He ascertained in a sing-song voice. He walked up to Sherlock and thrust the empty grip practically into his face, observing his reaction like a skulking vulture: “Was that your plan all along, Mr. Great Detective? To take what is ours then scare us off with some baloney? So that we would run away quickly without checking out first if the ware is in its place?”
Apollo.
“Is that so?” He asked, sporting a provocative grin in the corner of his mouth: “And what then?”
Vernet struggled for air like a fish, red-faced and confused. He shook his head and stammered: “No… no! That's… that's impossible!”
Yesterday, he was patient and gentle, still overwhelmed and adjusting to the idea that he will spend life with his new spouse from now on. But in this very moment, things are different. Now he is just hungry, insatiable. He gives Sherlock a few shallow thrusts to better prepare him. Then, overcome with sudden need and passion, with intensity that lets him taste blood, he slightly improves his position and pumps into Sherlock with abandon, sharp hisses discharged from his throat with every deep thrust.
Small coffee table was placed to man's right with two objects adorning its surface. One of them was a tea-cup with some liquid residue at the bottom of it. The other was a nasty looking revolver.
The man with whom Murray occupied the private cubicle was identified as Thijs De Vries, a Dutch national permanently residing in Ipswich, Suffolk. Similarly to Murray, De Vries, forty-eight years old, was an owner of the business company specialising in production and sale of the house-interior decorations, especially in antique-style plaster sculptures, busts and plaques. His enterprise had two British affiliated branches, one in Ipswich and the second one in Rotherhithe, London, with the main office residing in Amsterdam.
I hurried up and quickly climbed aboard the first-class carriage through the door placed at one end of it, being dimply aware of Sherlock and Ganimard entering the carriage through the opposite end.
“You nutter, you absolutely mad nutter.” I whispered fondly. “Didn’t I already show you how important you are to me? Just you wait… just you wait, Sherlock Holmes. One day I will teach you to hold yourself in a much higher esteem.”
Sherlock, completely immersed into the role of the paranoid detective now, sat down heavily into Anderson’s chair, propped the thyrsus against his desk and pulled the prepared envelope out from his pocket. He handed it to Anderson with a breathless request: “I need to speak with Gaston right away! This abominable thing was delivered to me with the usual correspondence today!”
“Glad to hear it.” John clasps Sherlock's wrists with some more strength and buries his cock fully into the detective, relishing the feel of his tight ass. Enjoying the moment of his triumph, he stops for a while and watches Sherlock subdued under him, excitement flowing through his veins like live current.
John bends over him, carefully maintaining his position inside. He licks Sherlock's ear playfully, forcing him to turn his head to the side that way and after that, he kisses him at the corner of the lips curled into dopey smile.
Incensed about the fact that these pleasant flirtations met such an end, I spun around at once and pierced the shouting madman with a death-glare. Not that it had any effect on him. The man – it was the same artsy type I noticed earlier – abandoned his valise on the nearby bench and surged at us like raging flood, still screeching cheerfully: “Guillaume!”
I presume that as soon as he got rid of Julian and secured that the Cathar would be found sitting in an incriminating position, Arnaud took a second gun from its hiding place, walked to the heating stove and turning the revolver against himself, he looked into the barrel and cold-bloodedly pulled the trigger. The glorious knight died a beautiful death, clearing the land of the pest that was plaguing it for so long.
During the time in which Sherlock was stuffing his short pipe with tobacco, Ganimard recovered and was now gushing with praise and compliments in a true Gallic fashion.
“That would mean… the man who did it is still up there?” Lestrade’s dark eyes grew wide and alert. “Is that why you stopped the Eye? To trap him there? Sherlock, but what about the other passengers in the cubicle! They are stranded up there with a maniac now!”
”Wrong, Sherlock.” He says smugly. “That woman over the counter is a local starlet. She made a television programme on Brighton some time ago. That's why she hangs in a frame over there.”
His words slowly faded-away. He remained standing opposite Sherlock in a stiff, challenging pose, his heart on his sleeve, his stomach cold and heavy, fighting the slight bout of anxiety.
“A crutch.” The man hissed at him. “You will bring me the crutch.”
The day verges on midday when those two finally decide to leave their nest of rumpled sheets and pillows all over the place. Thankfully, the bathroom is big enough for two so they can save time, showering together. It's a bit distracting to see Sherlock's fiery silver eyes raking through John's body possessively and John can't declare himself unaffected by the presence of wet and naked Greek demigod standing a mere step away from him, but they finally manage to wash themselves and enter their guest bedroom again to dress before leaving for dinner.
Sherlock smiled shame-facedly and he actually blushed.
Still, as more and more of Sherlock's skin became visible, a look of cunning reverie spread over his face. His tongue slipped out and lashed over his lips sensuously.
He lifted the corners of his mouth and leered maliciously at me.
We approached the house from the side of the dock. Lestrade unlocked the equipment door, artfully hidden in the façade wall at the ground floor level and from there we all descended into the basement. As we stepped off the last stair, my hand brushed against a cord of a ceiling lamp. I pulled it lightly. In the next moment, the bright light flooded the entire area in front of us.
Because, if you think about it, there’s no way I could ever explain why I tormented Sherlock for such a long time, sticking my abominable wife into his face.
“Sherlock!” I hissed and grabbed Sherlock's forearm, barely stifling the urge to shake him. “What the hell? Don't tell me you want to make us an accessory to this crime!”
“Well, the steak and kidney pie flavour was already sold out, I’m afraid.” I replied, giggling at his consternated face.
It was a man around fifty-five, sixty years old, but sleek and fit, looking very active. He possessed a darker skin typical for a Latin race together with milky white hair, which made for an interesting, striking contrast. Similar to Sherlock, he had a thin, oblong face with prominent cheekbones and the thin, nervous, elegant hands. He was clean-shaven and nicely groomed. Pearl-grey, hypnotic eyes glittered under his heavy, half-shut eyelids. His dark suit was cut in a simple style, but it was sewn from a quality material.
And in the next second, Sherlock flinched violently and all but screamed.
Then, without any further ado, he flipped open some report and tore into me. He told me that Sherlock had been observed near a notorious drug-den in Southall and accused me what a lousy job I do, taking care of him. I switched to the battle-mode immediately and replied sarcastically. And so the issue concerning this sculpture was forgotten momentarily.
“But there are some,” Sherlock's voice lowered “who became linked intimately with God although they were not yet released from the confines of the body.”
Fortunately, the gendarmes didn't allow the man to continue with the foolishness. They seized him by the arms and as the prison gates opened, they pushed him inside roughly, entering the building at his heels. And as they all went in, the white-haired, sternly dressed lithe man was released from inside and stepped out to the square, walking leisurely from the closing metal gate. He halted opposite us and shielded his eyes against the sudden sunlight, staring at Sherlock for a long while.
I wanted to apologise and to congratulate him on successfully solved case, but he was having none of it. With his eyes averted to the side, he crumpled the cigarette in his fingers and said quietly: “John, about that moment there at the dock… when they ordered me to kill you…”
His knees gave way after that and he sunk limply onto the seat next to mine. This enabled me to observe that magnificent set of engraved gems, adorned with mythological scenes from late Antique, from my vantage point. Their delicate beauty was striking and I was not the least surprised that Ganimard's hand shook feverishly when he caressed them with a careful touch of a miser.
“Where he really placed them?? You mean… you mean to tell us you know where they are?” We stared at him, incredulous.
He did not speak to me and didn't move an inch, just continued to stare at the crime-scene, stricken and bleary-eyed.
In a few minutes, after a heated argument and a short tracking of foot-prints, we finally halted in front of the large metal gate leading to the hall covered in corrugated iron.
It was a dark confession - and yet I never heard anything so touching in my life.
Sherlock looked to be taken aback by this suggestion too and he had a decency to protest: “To be honest, I'm a bit tired right now and I'm sure Doctor Watson is in a similar state. We were just going to find some hotel and to take lodgings there for a night…”
It slowly dawned on him. The relief washed over him like an outpour of the warm geyser. He felt the big grin growing on his face like the big, sunny dandelion.
It startled me because at that first moment, when I was still disoriented, I shortly believed it to be the sculpture of Sherlock.
The sound of steps snapped me out of reverie. Lestrade, looking done for today, stopped by Sherlock and discussed something with him.
In that moment a deep, rumbling voice resounded near us: “But I could gladly serve you in that regard, Monsieur Lupin.”
The bell placed high on the wall rang angrily when the door was slammed shut into Sherlock's face. Two pairs of hostile, distrustful eyes pierced Sherlock from behind the glass. The slim female hand let down the blinds after that and cut the bistro from the rest of the world in an uncompromising manner.
And now this! Bloody hell!
We passed along the Greenland Dock and soon reached the warehouse of De Vries where our plight was born some two hours ago.
Still weak in the stomach, I nodded slowly. His crystal irises, frost-coloured but filled by lively inner fire, glittered in front of me. He’s alive, I told myself. He’s alive. That thing was never real and is in the past now. I felt his hand on my shoulder, pressing gently and I yielded to it, sitting down to the wall of a river-bank. Calm down, I whispered to myself, calm down, John, calm down…
Later in the evening, the detective and his doctor are sitting in the portable chairs on the beach strewn with mead-coloured gravel and watch the dark horizon far, far behind the sea. The air is scented with a vernal aroma of an approaching rain. In the twilight, Sherlock is raising his hand again and again, observing a simple, unadorned band of gold stuck on his ring finger with morbid fascination.
I let go of him at once. Not to obey his command but to call his attention to something I noticed.
”OK with me,” quips Sherlock and takes another slow sip from the wine.
I was already firm in my knowledge of the fact. Nevertheless, it was a blow to hear it confirmed from his own mouth. I struggled to continue, my shaking fingers clawing my thighs spasmodically: “How old were you when you first started sleeping together?”
“Would someone tell me what is happening here?!” He demanded angrily. “If these men do not have anything to do with the crime, who shot this poor guy then? Was it him?”
“No, don't!” Sherlock's voice rang behind me, unusually raw and exasperated. I never heard such tone from him before. It stopped me in my tracks and I turned to him with quizzical expression on my face.
Because the old guy focused his short-sighted eyes on Sherlock carefully and hesitating for a while, he finally bowed to him and started to declaim in a raspy voice: “En aisso sabem quar en lui estam et el e nos quar del seu Esperit dec a nos. Quar esz fil de Deu, Deus trames l'esperit del seu Fil el vostre cor.”
“Thank you, monsieur.” I murmured politely and resumed a seat opposite him, placing my bag softly on the floor.
He then slowly lowered his hands and made a slight gesture in the direction of Lestrade.
He blew out a cigarette smoke markedly, in an overdone Greta Garbo style.
I flared out: “Don't bring my relationships with women into it! I did not seek them out since we ended together!”
Three men and their captive awaited us inside. Two muscular gorillas with their faces still hidden behind black balaclavas sat on a makeshift bench in the open part of this place, slightly behind the concrete wall, but very much visible. One of them demonstratively held Lestrade by his shoulder to let us know he is completely under their power. Greg, pale and bruised in the face, was forced to kneel in front of them with both hands painfully twisted behind his back and secured by his own handcuffs. He stared at us with distressed but defiant dark eyes. By his side, a small brown crate was situated.
He made a pregnant pause after this sentence, to further emphasise it.

After the torturous interval that felt like eternity the last wagon finally rumbled by, confirming my suspicion. Behind the window, only the peaceful rustic country stretched to its mountainous background. The fugitive, still at large, was nowhere in sight.
He seized the solid, warm mass he omitted earlier - Sherlock's manhood - slightly damp and still pliant in his hand.
“Sorry to interrupt you, messieurs,” he said stiffly, not able to hide the dissatisfaction resounding in his voice. “But shouldn't we give chase to the criminal? I know he is out of his element here in this place, but he is an old fox. Who knows what other felony he will perpetrate come the morning...”
The train moved slowly in between, a train crew trying to move the train from its position among fields and olive groves into the more savoury area of Gare de Béziers.
I stiffened for a second. Then I was up on the stairs and I shook the metal panel of the door furiously, but it would not open or yield to my power in any other way. Frustrated, I kicked it, but even that did not move the blasted barrier which cut off our way to freedom. We were really and truly trapped.
“Oh, hell!” I murmured.
“You will have the crutch before 9 o’clock AM tomorrow. I’ll bring it to you as it is, unchanged and undisturbed” He replied firmly, with absolute conviction.
“Do not ever,” I hissed after a sinister pause, “do not ever compare our relationship to the one you shared with this charlatan! I made love to an adult who was fully conscious of the consequences of the act. He took advantage of an inexperienced young boy!”
I felt staggered too: “Jesus! To commit murder at such a place, then to poison yourself! And in such a gruesome manner! That’s so crackers! Why would anyone wish to do that?”
The next minute passed in silence. I took my hat off and fanned myself with it, yawning in boredom and blinking sleepily against the faint light coming from outside. After that, I turned back towards my travelling companion and fixed my glance on the heavily illustrated front page of Le Figaro.
“Hey!” Lestrade interrupted us immediately, having enough of our natter. “Can you save your argument for later? Sherlock, you promised me we will only stay here for a short while! So move your ass and resume whatever you were doing before! And John, I see a huge book on Greek mythology over there on the shelf. Take it and read about Apollo if you find him interesting, just don’t slow Sherlock down in his investigations. We overstayed our stay here beyond any tolerable measure, as far as I am concerned.”
And in that second, as is the habit of these electronic appliances, Lestrade’s mobile-phone rang.
“And what about you?”
Sherlock nodded slowly: “There are numerous wounds on his head, delivered by a blunt object. A crutch that fell down a moment before him is sticky with blood, it even has some hair adhering to its surface. You do the math, Detective Inspector.”
“I'm sorry.” I whispered ruefully. “I didn't mean to make such a scene. In a way I'm glad that you are so protective of your former lover. I wouldn't like it one bit if you abandoned him to his fate. It's just… I felt so insecure when I realised you were once intimate with him. Like I should lose you to him.”
Sherlock sits up slowly, stretches his long arms to the sides and flexes his back with languid sensuality, then looks at John coolly: "Sawmill, you say?"
“Rodents, most likely.” I commented and tapped on the plaster lightly, confirming that the resulting sound rang hollow under my hand. “The building is old, it must be full of long forgotten vents and chimneys, I gather.”
When we almost crashed into the buoy, I screamed furiously: “Sherlock, these guys are maybe headed to Folkestone, for all we know! Could you try NOT to kill us before we get there?!”
Shaving my moustache off for Sherlock's case was a hard thing to do, but it worked very well, indeed. Our target dismissed me as a harmless nobody on sight and didn't even suspect who I really am.
“Don’t succumb to him, John. He’s a cruel god.”
Sherlock peeked at her from under the visor of the deerstalker inscrutably. Still, he was not bearing the name of the sleuth in vain. He flexibly adjusted himself to a new source of data and asked smoothly and politely: “You knew Monsieur Arnaud then, Madame?”
“Uh, yes… this… let me introduce you, Marcel. This is my loyal companion of many years, Doctor John Watson. And Watson, this gentleman is monsieur Marcel Vernet, my distant relative.”
“Sherlock!” I tugged at his sleeve, irritation rising high in my stomach.
“I didn't seek anyone since I first met you, John!” He burst out angrily. “I never desired another after I came to know you as you are well aware! You never witnessed me to behave as a philanderer, so you could be very sure about my fidelity! And yet you married that woman and left me alone, resigning me to cocaine!”
Still, I trusted Sherlock to reject this nuisance right away in his cold and haughty manner. I keenly observed his eyes peering intently at the man from the shadow cast by the visor of the deerstalker. I saw them widen and darken – in outrage, I supposed – and as his lips opened, my stomach shivered in joyful anticipation of a harsh, cutting speech…
After that, he entered the icy waves and waded through them carefully. His legs felt totally numb, but thankfully, his prise was quite near, it smiled at him from the base of the nearest rock. He reached for it and gently separated it from the ragged surface of the reef.
“Julian!” He whispered brokenly.
One of the huge gorillas held Sherlock by the throat, thick fingers digging into that frail, milky white column with abandon. Yet Sherlock did not fight, merely looked at our captors with contempt. The wrapped up crutch lay on the ground by the tips of his shoes.
Trembling like a leaf, I scrambled back to my feet and pulled the handcuff off the broken rail.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and steepled his fingers under his chin in thought.
The old lady nodded slowly: “Oh, he was an absolute angel, sir. A devout Jesuit and a man full of Christian virtue, as you have said. I was his acquaintance from the moment I first came into Béziers thirty years ago, because he served as an aide for the church I used to attend for many years. He was such a great support for the poor of our town while he was still active! Especially children from destitute families and the orphans have much to thank him for, because he frequently organised charities for them and helped them to find some decent work. Not only Rosalie and Marie, but also many others will miss him so…”
The gendarmerie officer swore again and eyed our small group suspiciously.
“Wait, Sherlock.” He said with a broad smile. “I'll help you with that.”
“She did, in fact. Mycroft's first name is Vivien – after La Chevalerie Vivien and Aliscans respectively.”
These things were so raw between us because of radically changed circumstances of our relationship in the last two months. It was in the middle of spring (19-th of April to be exact) that I threw all my earlier cautions, misgivings and self-recrimination to the wind and bluntly asked Sherlock if I could spend the night in his bedroom. He was somewhat taken aback but he said yes. He even managed to finish the chemical experiment he was working at in record time of ten minutes and promptly retreated into his room with me in tow. What ensued was a fairly pleasant and enjoyable activity. Seeing Sherlock’s eager response to it I believed that I healed the rift my wretched marriage left between us and I congratulated myself for my boldness with which I managed to end this Mary fiasco without a big drama or sweat and tears.
But sooner than this situation gradated into such a dramatic end, Vernet flew inside and jumped among the gendarmes with flailing hands.
“All right.” Sherlock turned on his heel and headed back to the river. “Come on, John, we have some work to do…”
“I was always attracted to you, from the moment of our first encounter at St. Bart's, Sherlock.” I confessed. “But I believed you to be unobtainable, uninterested in such things. I also genuinely loved Mary, my feelings for her weren't any shallower than those I had for you. I am aware it's unfair of me to berate you about Julian when I am like that. When I was able to give my heart to two people simultaneously. Still, it's how I am.”
His wavy black hair bobbed up and down as he nodded, once.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and nodded in the direction of the stove after that: “I would also like to put your attention to the coals that had fallen all around the deceased. Some of them are certainly not placed in positions into which they should naturally fall at the time of an impact. They are not scattered – the few blocks were probably pushed aside by some instrument and created something like a row right under the stove. Please, note down the fact, it's very important.”
Having noticed that, he was struck with a sudden idea.
He kissed John roughly, letting his teeth be felt and then he started to move his hips, trusting forth, his member bobbing in front of John's fly, every gesture signalling his impatience.
Vernet climbed three steep steps leading to a battered oak and knocked on it in vehement taps.
Massacre! Couple brutally murdered in Nieuw Sloten!
“Not far really. Just to Finland Street in Rotherhithe, right next to Greenland Dock. If we take the route through Bermondsey, we can be there in a jiff.”
”It's my turn, then,” he rumbles in a deep voice and he turns up to the door, bumping into a chair of another guest by accident.
Cat among the pigeons! Old lady assaults fellow pensioners at Diemen!
We were back in his office at Scotland Yard, absolutely wrung out after the excitement of last night and the subsequent investigations that lasted until noon. We burrowed into comfortable chairs and rested there a bit. Greg and I, we were decorated by a redoubtable set of bruises, while Sherlock sported the white bandage on his head and on his chest which was visible through his partly unbuttoned bloodied shirt.
When he felt that he has his friend's full attention again, he lowered his voice and stared earnestly at Sherlock: “I didn't know how to reach you. You were not speaking and you were reading that depressive Verlaine again. That's why I came with that Mary de France silliness. But the verses… it was no joke, Sherlock. I meant every word.”
Anderson’s face mirrored an acute embarrassment. He awkwardly shuffled his feet and confessed: “I called the boss twice during the last hour but he didn’t pick it up. Maybe he turned it to mute for some reason. I’m very sorry, Sherlock.”
The cabbie gave us a responding cry and prodded the horses into a swift ride, turning around and taking the corner into a busy nearby street leading to the old bridge across the river Orb.
Sherlock, passing by us at that very moment, overheard my comment and laughed derisively.
And then…
The blast came without warning. It was so powerful, it literally lifted me up and threw me against the counter in such a manner that I managed to break down the rusty rail running around its perimeter. Falling down to the ground unceremoniously like a rotten apple, I shrieked out in surprise and pain and abruptly opened my eyes once more.
As we left the station, we were greeted by the sight of the hansom cabs nicely lined-up next to the entrance to the building. Mumbling swearwords under my breath I headed off in their direction… then abruptly stopped in my tracks when a loud whistle rang behind my back.
Sherlock raised his hand instinctively and pressed it over his heart: “And such people, John, are called boni homines among the Cathars or Perfecti by the Catholic Church. They live the life of extreme austerity. They do not dress lavishly. They do not lie, nor swear in oaths. They willingly endure strenuous work and all different kinds of hardships. They fast frequently. They do not have a procreative sexual contact with any person, so as to not entrap more Angelic Souls into this garment of the body. They do not eat meat, eggs, fat or cheese, because these too were originally obtained through coitus. Moreover, it is forbidden to a Perfect to inflict pain upon any Soul imprisoned in this world, whether it lives in an animal or human form. And for this same reason, Perfect would never take life of any living creature, John. Never.”
“Can we stop somewhere before you take us to Baker Street?” he asked with a slightly devilish smirk on his lips, some cunning plan evident in his mind.
I have thought we’ll take Lestrade’s car and be off right away but Sherlock unexpectedly headed back to this quiet building. It surprised me, but I did not ask needless questions and just moved after him.
When I came out with the towel cavalierly worn over both shoulders, I found Sherlock engaged in a weird activity. He cut an orange in half there in the kitchen and was busy fishing pips out of it, placing it into the white envelope carefully. I raised my brows at him awaiting an explanation, but he evaded my unspoken question by pointing out that I am distracting him in my current state and that I should hurry instead, for we are busy. Remembering Greg, I complied quickly, but not without a wide smile stretched across my face.
The man looked at our drenched, dripping, pathetic figures for a while and then twitched his gun to the side, indicating Lestrade with it: “Do you know this policeman well? Well enough to enter his office if necessary? Do you have access there?”
“Sure. Where to?” nodded the unsuspecting DI.
Sherlock pressed his lips together and shook his head: “If they are cornered here, they could kill Greg in panic or anger. So this is absolutely out of the question.”
“Help! Help! Rosalie!” She moaned in the pitifully broken voice. “Give me some water, Rosalie! Monsieur Arnaud… up there… in his drawing room….”
“Keys.” I heard Sherlock say behind me, confirming my impression.
John raises his eyebrows in surprise. But he is secretly delighted: he always wished to do that one day. He takes a razor and after spreading some cream on his face, he carefully shaves Sherlock, delightedly touching his jaw and throat and caressing it in a sensual manner. Sherlock's lids are half-closed as if they were unbearably heavy and he enjoys John's attention, nuzzling his cheekbones against doctor's warm palms like a cat, humming inaudibly.
I slowly unbuttoned his shirt and prostrated myself on his naked chest, kissing him with abandon. He reciprocated passionately. Emboldened by this response, I quickly stripped him, leaving the rest of his clothes on the floor and being dressed myself, I claimed him greedily, embracing his lean, firm thighs and torso in turns.
He hurried forth and joined his friend by the gate as they hit the road towards the cottage hired for the night. Sherlock took his time in Sherrinford facility and the ferry to Penzance was an impossibility now, the weather and the late season making even the future ship transport from the island dubious. But Sherlock probably didn't mind at all, John suspected. He was not made from steel after all and needed some time for himself after each visit of Eurus.
“Secretive as always, isn't he, our dear Guillaume? He grew up here in Béziers, he never told you that?”
“You never would, John.” Sherlock assured me heatedly. “The concrete wall standing behind you would shield you from it.”
The officer, quite cowed and bewildered all of sudden, accepted the card meekly and read it with an almost comic kind of reverence. Meanwhile, Sherlock made a sweeping gesture, encompassing the room with it and continued: “Now let me describe the state of this place as we found it upon our arrival after the announcement of the crime.”
I leapt from the stairs to his side and together we raced alongside all the statues to the wall opposite us.
“John!” Sherlock's strained voice carried a note of warning this time and the rhythmical movements of his hips slowly gave way to erratic spasms.
Anderson was very surprised when we entered but his face lit like the three hundred watt light-bulb at the sight of Sherlock. His hero worship kicked in with usual force and in an instant, he was all over him, eagerly asking if he could aid him in any way.
Sherlock answered me by wordlessly handing me a smartphone. Confused, I looked at the screen and read the list of bizarre and sensational article titles:
Surprised, Sherlock hesitantly turned the tiny creature in his fingers. He hawed in a pedantic sort of way, the puzzlement evident on him: “A bivalve? A marine mollusc with a laterally compressed body, enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged parts?”
“Is this vanilla?” Sherlock, the sworn enemy of all sweets, scowled at me with brows knitted in mock disgust.
He smiled warmly then. He came quite near to Sherlock and shortly squeezed his forearm, his fingers long, delicate and frail.
“Because he was ill, John.” Sherlock ascertained grimly and frowned. “Very ill, I think. Probably on the verge of dying. But he didn't want to go like that, to fade away like an insignificant ghostly shadow. He was a Christ's warrior all his life, a devout, ardent Jesuit and he wished to decorate his demise with a deed that would give significance and glamour to all of his previous existence.
“No, it definitely wasn't.” Sherlock responded with merriment sparkling in his pale eyes and inserted his long fingers into the gap between the seat and the window-wall, carefully grasping for some elusive object. In the next second he pulled out one end of the copper wire with little noose on it, something akin to snapped up shoe-string hanging from it limply.
He climbed the staircase and sat down on the edge of the large, comfortable bed, feeling drained. The rapping of the keyboard buttons, as rapid as the volley of bullets, accompanied his musings.
Terror in Noorderpark! Arsonist on the run leaves Volewijck in fear!
My heart jumped to my throat at the sight. I half-awaited a bullet to burst through the wood of the door, doing away with Sherlock as it did with the other man, Arnaud. But Sherlock managed to get to the door unhurt. He then placed his palm to the middle of it and cautiously pushed it in, causing it to open wide.
John immediately let go of Sherlock, seized him with unexpected force and turned him around without notice, pressing him against the wall. He stuck his large prick among two lush buttocks which were bared to him that way and thrust forth firmly. Sherlock cried out in alarm, as more cum escaped out of his leaking cock. John thrust into him one last time, then released the thick shot of ejaculate, filling Sherlock's backside with his share of the sticky white cream.
“Healing properties, John? Not really. Do you see the arrows fastened onto Apollo’s waist? They are poisonous. Their touch infects you with a bubonic plague. That’s why this god was revered by the ancient healers - out of fear not out of respect!”
“Oh, what a good soul he was, really!” I laughed hysterically. “The hypocritical swine! Purity, chastity, abstaining from sex… he certainly adhered to his own principles, didn't he?”
Sherlock squeezed my hand in a vice grip. Despite his outward façade of absolute stoicism, he couldn't fool me. He was shell-shocked there, under the hard kernel of apathy.
“Semtex. Try to double-cross me and I’ll tie the officer to it and let him fly, do you understand?”
Sherlock, who lies lazily spread on the bed, props himself upon his elbows and flings his head backwards, sticking out his chin: "Shave it then, if you like."
“The DI has his phone on him. He has me listed as SH among his contacts. When I will be back with the crutch, I’ll call him. You will take him out after that – unhurt – and bind him to the railing outside, leaving him alone there, so that I can glimpse him before I hand you the crutch. If I don’t see him alive and kicking, the crutch will end at the bottom of the Thames… do you accept this deal?”
Elegant, single-story building of Gare de Montpellier was shrouded in smoky vapours emitted from lazily moving steam locomotives. It was a sleepy Saturday evening and the wan daylight of the late October tinted everything with shades of blue and grey. This probably discouraged people from travelling. For such a populous city, only a few villagers and a handful of well-dressed bourgeois loitered on the open platforms.
We seated ourselves to the grass that covered the bank as the pleasant felt carpet and discussed some metaphysical philosophies, never noticing that the giant black poplar growing nearby was uprooted by the wind and rain the previous evening. And so it toppled over and fell on us unexpectedly, its long branches and twigs hitting me so that I was knocked down in an instant. Julian escaped from the incident unscathed somehow.
Impromptu morning exercises refreshed Sherlock and he dresses into his designer suit in a flash, fit and keen, bristling with impatient energy. John, who can't keep the pace despite being a soldier, jealously knits his brows and wearily dons on shirt adorned with checkered pattern and his worn out leather jacket.
”Oh, really?” asks John dryly and critically eyes the front of the shop.
The moment he stepped up to Sherlock, the detective threw his trousers aside with an annoyed gesture. John caught his wrists into a gentle grip and slowing down his frantic movements that way, he murmured: “Easy, easy!”
John grinned from ear to ear and flew up the stairs excitedly.
“Ouch! What was that for? Cut that out or we’ll really crash!”
Short, stunned silence ensued.
“Yes, quite.” Blue flaming gaze boring into John, Sherlock bent forwards inconspicuously.
I sidled up to him and when my nose was almost touching the side of his jaw, I growled in a low voice: “I won't disclose my secrets but... oh, the things I would do to you...”
I kept my tongue sullenly and Sherlock, walking by my side, was silent too, his gaze aimed ahead of us unflinchingly, his steps noiseless, his face pallid, withdrawn and mysterious in the all-encompassing gloom. He remained like that even as we stepped into the cab. He never once looked at me during our ride.
He rubbed his face with his hands in frustration: “I was one of them while I lived here, yes. But that thing is in the past now. I am no longer a pure one. I chose my own path.”

High above our heads, the light was burning brightly behind the heavy curtains in all four heavily decorated windows. It conjured the image of the luxurious saloon illuminated by the friendly hearth-fire in our mind's eye. The store front seemed to be inviting too, hiding the amiable little bistro behind its glass and wooden panels.
“Why did you split with Julian at the end, I wonder?”
Cold wind was rising from the open, watery plains of the ocean. The white line of the coast shimmered in the distance, once near, once far, visible in the gaps in the shrubbery for a few moments and in the next moment invisible again.
“That's because no murderer exists, John. The man did it himself. It was a suicide!”
I stammered that we had a similar statue of Apollo at the university during my student days, but Mycroft didn’t listen to me at all. He leisurely went around me, moving silently as a cat and seated himself behind his writing desk.
But I didn't dare to explicitly ask this yet. So I just scratched myself behind the ear as if I was hiding embarrassment and I squinted to the side, thinking aloud: “There is one thing in the whole situation that does not make sense to me at all, Sherlock. If Authié spread Catharism around, why the deuce would he try to visit a Jesuit all of a sudden? They could have nothing in common, for sure. Also, wouldn't it be risky for him to keep such relations?
Nothing much happened to me, I was just shaken and frightened. Still, there was a lot of blood because my body was full of bleeding scrapes and I also couldn't move, being stranded under the heavy load of leafy branches.
Impulsive as usual, Vernet didn't even ask and burst right in. We exchanged glances at that moment, both of our faces mirroring the disappointment and regret about what-could-have-been… but it was not suitable to discuss these things in public, in the middle of the street. So we followed Vernet to the bistro docilely.
Adrenaline pumped through my veins with such power I was barely aware of the fact that the car has now stopped and Sherlock is calling the kidnappers. I only snapped out of it when the gate of the largest hall opened swiftly and two muscular brutes escorted Lestrade out of the building, handcuffed him to the industrial guard-rail surrounding the nearest hut and left him there while they retreated back into their hiding-place. For no particular reason, the sight made my stomach constrict painfully and I had to swallow around the big dumpling that appeared in my throat all of a sudden.
“Because William is his name, isn't it?” He replied, shrugging his shoulders.
They found their cottage relatively quickly – it was the one next to the reef and the small beach underneath. The mechanical lock opened with a subtle click. After that, they entered the warm interior with relief.
He pointed his finger at the small brown crate threateningly.
“Show-off,” I growled fondly and ruffled his dark black curls.
The pink-cheeked granny who stood nearby and who carried two live chickens in the basket thrown over her shoulder tut-tutted compassionately. She leaned to Sherlock and informed him in a hushed up voice of a well informed confidant: “Don't bear a grudge against them, sir, they didn't mean it like that. They both adored Monsieur Arnaud immensely. They must still be in shock.”
The leader of our captors loitered about the centre of the room. Noticing him, Sherlock gave him a disgusted glance and kicked the crutch to him.
“Guillaume!” He yelled with delight. “William Sherlock Scott Holmes!”
How could I be so blind?
“Greg.” I shuddered. “They have taken Greg!”
”And the food is good too,” notes John with another good bite into the bread.
Based on reaction of Mrs. Thibaut, I was already prepared for the worst… but the butchery displayed before my eyes still made me cringe. The bullet hit the old man directly into the left eye and flew out through the vertex, mangling his skull in an incredible manner. Disregarding the ghastly character of the injury, the sheer amount of blood this produced was unbelievable. Its sticky red traces lingered literally on every single object located in that quarter of the room. Moreover, one of the people involved - the victim or maybe the perpetrator himself - overturned the coal scuttle during the fatal encounter which gave a positively hellish tint to the whole scene. The dead man – who lay curled on his side near the heating stove – rested there covered in black dust, the dark blocks of coal scattered among his limbs, around his head, in the ocean of blood spilled on the floor… Nobody could produce more horrifying image even if they tried.
During their conversation, I was rambling around the office nonchalantly and surveyed the room together with Lestrade’s private cubicle next door. Glimpsing the objects from today’s investigation, including the crutch, scattered over the table there in their transparent plastic covers and overhearing Philip’s last words, I chuckled in amusement: “Maybe he sleeps at night from time to time, don’t you think? Some of us do, you know?”
“All right, you have persuaded me. I must check it out before I leave. Lead on!”
He placed a revolver on the table next to Julian, to incriminate him with a crime. I'm sure he shot one round from that gun in the fields at the outskirts the town previously, to create an illusion that it was this very gun which was used for his murder.
“No, he didn't!” Sherlock protested heatedly. “I never felt misused or exploited by him! I was active in that relationship and I sought Julian's attention eagerly. It was a flattering thought that he craves me so much. I felt wanted… I felt like a chosen one.”
The spectacle and the tone are all the prompt John needs and he bossily lays himself on top of his lover. Sherlock, however, has different plans and he enfolds John into a tight embrace, seizes him by the arms, flips him over and descends on the doctor, firmly wrapping him in a cocoon of hot young flesh and lust.
“Are you all right?” he asked, staring intently at me.
The bearded bloke gave me an ugly look and started to pace the area like a tiger kept in the cage. The gun sticking from behind his waistband glistened ominously and his hands shook as if he was at the edge of the nervous breakdown.
When I finished laughing, I wiped out the tears of merriment from my eyes and went after him.
“You know full well this is not the issue!” I retorted, barely restraining myself from screaming. “Your religious experiments do not interest me the least! But I can't stand the thought you played bottom to that creep out there!”
Thankfully, as we emerged to an almost empty street, we were able to catch an errant cab returning from its assignment immediately. Sherlock would probably sprout wings and fly at our destination, if we didn't.
Here I stopped and stiffened in surprise. I swiftly raised my right hand, giving a warning to Sherlock who slowly approached me from the other side.
As we jumped to the dry land again, I fixed my trousers back on immediately. Meanwhile, Sherlock sidled up to the permanently wet brickwork of the riverbank and carefully peeked over it.
He caressed my cheek, his touch delicate as the flutter of the butterfly-wings. His fiery lips pressed against my temple next, marking me with a kiss.
“Are you sure you should be doing that right now?” I asked, incredulous.
He snapped of his mental reverie only after few minutes. He hesitated for a while and came nearer to Marie, tipping his cap to her.
Sherlock looked at me helplessly like a deer caught in a snare of the cunning poacher and he lifted his shoulders in a gesture of resignation. He then turned to the exit from the platform, being led along by Vernet who called nonchalantly over his shoulder: “My valise is there on the bench, Doctor Watson! Merci beaucoup!”
“Well, the Dutch guy resided there, but I don’t see how it all connects with today’s events, to be honest.”
At last, the helicopter appeared. Resembling an elegant red dragonfly rather than a machine in the twilight, it buzzed over the Tresco heliport for a while, then descended slowly and alighted on the grass-plot next to the wooden hangar. The noise, the murmur of the giant bumble-bee, intensified for a moment. But the blades of the rotor stopped quite quickly after that and the resulting silence flooded the lawn like a high tide.
“Trafalgar will be avenged at last?” He chuckled. “What an idiot!”

“The name of the victim was Charles Murray. Fifty-six years old, owner of the small-sized enterprise, travel agency and accommodation bureau called “North Sea Express”. He died as a result of severe closed head injury, after being repeatedly hit to the temporal and occipital bones of the skull with a crutch which later was found near the crime-scene. The body was then tossed out of the cubicle of the Eye through the emergency exit, together with the murderous weapon.
As I glimpsed him, a sharp jolt in my chest made me gasp audibly. It could well have been a young Sherlock who loitered on the stairs above us. The young man had the rich dark curly hair and a pale complexion, piercing green eyes and a dignified presence. He was tall and lithe and very, very pretty.
Properly chastised, we returned to our previous activities. Sherlock busied himself with the close examination of collected wares while I approached the shelf placed next to the staircase, containing the book on mythology. I removed the bulky tome off its place, paged through it until I found Apollo and immersed myself into reading.
The door was positioned just a few steps from the heating stove where this cruel tragedy has occurred. It was left slightly ajar and the darkness visible in its gap only revealed to me that no lamp has been lit in the room situated behind it. This and the fact that I heard no sounds coming from its direction was the reason I originally dismissed it as unimportant.
“But, monsieur!” I protested, truly outraged by these claims.
The strangled sound escaped from Sherlock's throat and in the next second, the aggressive red flower of his cock bloomed with the burst of sticky white cum. It came out in a long, rich bursts and its translucent flow painted John's exposed belly like a hot salty varnish.
Encompassing this desert with one glance and finding it safe for the moment, I turned to Sherlock: “Come, we must notify the police about this. We have no authority to be here now.”
“Dead? Are you sure?” Lestrade blurted out and run his fingers through his spiky crew-cut in frustrated desperation.
I turned around and saw Vernet waving furiously at me. Some shabby hay-wain stood by his side, being tended to by a placid-looking peasant. Sherlock already climbed on top of it, trying to find a comfortable position among the mess loaded on the wagon. Obviously, this was our means of transportation today.
His elegant Paris evening suit was in rags now and his face was smeared with muck, but his top-hat escaped the ruin somehow and was still in quite a serviceable shape. When he glimpsed us, he tipped the hat to us and bared his teeth in a cheeky smile, addressing us as if we were meeting in front of an elegant restaurant not in front of a gaol.
And I hissed in shock, enveloped in the strong feeling of unpleasantness and disgust at once.
I instinctively shut up my eyes.
“Fetch us a cab then, we must hurry!”
We both rushed forth to him, Lestrade and me – but I was quicker.
And with that, we ceased speaking up to the moment when we reached our destination.
Sherlock straightened and caught her by an elbow with a wild gleam in his eyes. The girl whirled over, affronted by that treatment and I too flinched at this inappropriate gesture, but before we could voice any protest, he pointed his finger at the nearly unconscious woman and barked: “Is this the housekeeper here?”
“Fuck!” I roared in horrified disbelief.
At this the man's face brightened and his blank stare transformed into an impish, cheerful expression. He stretched his hand out to me in his customary merry and carefree attitude and he added in English laden with heavy French accent: “Cousin seven times removed, so to say. Nice to meet you, sir.”
“I was in a bad place then, Sherlock. Everything was still so raw. And… there was the issue of that beating at that time. I didn't trust myself around you yet and I didn't believe you would be interested after all that happened.” John whispered grimly. “But now, after Sherrinford… I mean, what's the point of this damned wavering?”
In that instant he grabbed me by the wrist, his grip strong and intense like the grip of the jaw-vice and he tacitly pointed his finger at the door to the adjacent room. The lines of his face sharpened, emphasised by the tension evident in his body.
Sherlock startled. He blanched as if every drop of blood was drained from his face. He stood straighter after that and his features hardened, the wild blue eyes flashing with a steely flame.
And his reticence dissolved into a loud, hearty laugh which was so contagious that I joined right in and guffawed until my hips were aching with cramps.
“Any comments?” he breaths into Sherlock's own erratic breath.
Rosalie pressed her lips together and turned away from him, putting her hands on top of the stone edging of the bridge. She fastened her stare on the surface of the calmly floating water and replied in a defiant, resolute manner: “Oui, monsieur. I was always very loyal to Père Arnaud. Always. But I can't send that gentleman to the guillotine knowing he is innocent. Even if he is the envoy of Satan as Père Arnaud assured me.”
We both sprung up after his last remark.
“Sherlock Holmes?” His voice was smooth and carried a distinct foreign accent. “I know the name. You are that notorious London detective, aren’t you?”
He seized his own manly pride and pressed it alongside Sherlock's, rubbing them against each other and bringing pleasure to them both. The fingers of his other hand were clenched around Sherlock's slim waist and his forehead leaned against Sherlock's heaving chest, between the open lapels of his unbuttoned shirt.
“But Holmes has an older brother… why didn't she adorn that one with such a name?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “But one thing the conspirators didn't count with was the coal that scattered all around Arnaud at the time of his death. When the weapon was being dragged through it, it pushed some of the blocks aside and it created something like a row of them which was unnatural in that setting. It was this fact that ultimately disclosed the manner in which this crime was committed to me.”
The atmosphere in the car changed subtly when we got into it again. It was riddled with uneasy feeling even through our way here but now it seemed to be much thicker, more dangerous, as if an ominous cloud descended onto us. I didn’t like it one bit.
And there it stood, in the alcove placed right at the edge of the darkness and sunshine.
“Uh, I’m with the force for twenty years now but I never ever witnessed such zoo before.” Greg resumed a seat in his private cubicle with a deep sigh. Afterwards, he lifted a steaming cuppa from the table and took a soothing sip with deep relish.
At this my dastardly travelling companion, now pale as the candle wax, darted up from his seat and wildly hit Sherlock to the chest, forcing him to let go of the door and to abandon his position for a while. He then slammed the door shut, locking it in haste and threateningly brandished a revolver out of his overcoat with the nimbleness of a viper.
Sherlock allowed the wire to fall back to its place and shook his head.
Loud rustle was audible behind my back, accompanied by curses in the foreign language. After that, Sherlock’s deep calm voice cut through the darkness: “Is this really necessary? We brought you the thing you requested, after all.”
