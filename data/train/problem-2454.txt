"Thank you, it's great to be here. We'll just, err... What do you say to the nice lady Sherlock? Sorry, he seems to have gone a bit shy. We'll be back in a moment"
Sherlock issued his caregiver a dark look for spoiling his fun, but soon resumed playing peaceably enough. The whale and dinosaur now seemed to be being taught about the scientific properties of bubbles, and also, more importantly, how to pop them. John resumed shaving to the conversational sounds of a T-Rex and a cetacean who apparently did not mind being patronised by a 6-foot baby.
"That's right. It makes you look like you've got a moustache." The pair laughed happily together at the photo.
"Come here".
"I think there's one corner over here we haven't explored yet, William Sherlock Scott of the Antarctic Holmes. I wonder what's behind these trees here?" asked the doctor, rhetorically. The Little hurried onwards.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time?" queried Sherlock, assuming the usual reason supplied by his caregiver would be correct on this occasion as on so many others.
John paused for dramatic effect, and Sherlock's eyes lit up in anticipation of the old punchline:
"Good boy, that's it, calmly now..." soothed the caregiver. "OK, sit up and have a sandwich. Slowly! Good boy."
Shining angels are near
"Will you let me undo you now?" Sherlock nodded, and John opened the boy's trousers, pulling them down a bit and tugged away the front of the already damp underwear. Sherlock immediately began peeing towards the base of a tree, and John swiftly added his own stream with a sigh of relief. When John had finished he tidied himself and then redressed Sherlock, and wiped his hands for him.
"Your heart keeps me alive?" Sherlock wrinkled his nose doubtfully.
"Chicken!" yelled Sherlock, pointing as a bird scuttered away from the vehicle.
The car came to a stop in a farmyard with barns and a large comfortable-looking house of red brick and blue window frames. John undid both men's seatbelts, got himself and his Little out of the car, and guided Sherlock up to the blue-painted front door of the farmhouse.
"Indoor voices Sherlock."
Time to say goodnight and goodbye.
Mrs Hudson began to gather up her things:
"Oh. Well, I can feed you with this sweetheart." At this the sobs become more passionate and more distressed.
- Would you like to bring the crumpets up here for tea. I've lit a fire :)
"Mmm."
"Beautiful" replied Sherlock wisely.
"Bye-bye" echoed the Little, flapping his hand back and forth in an ill-co-ordinated wave. "Bye".
"Perhaps he shrank and fell into my pocket," said the doctor, patting at his coat.
"And what noise does a monkey make, Big Lion?" he asked, tickling Sherlock's tummy.
John struggled an awkward load of bags and coats and wellies under his left arm, and held out his right hand to Sherlock, who did not take it, but instead clung to the doorframe more tightly than ever. Sensing that his Little One's behaviour was truly a reflection of anxiety rather than pure naughtiness, the caregiver put down his miscellaneous collection of things, and pulled the boy towards him for a reassuring hug.
"No!" screamed Sherlock, fighting to pull up his clothes with one hand while clutching at himself with the other. Suddenly and unexpectedly Sherlock stilled, and looking slyly at John said "Daddy go too".
The pile of leaves giggled and trembled.
Sherlock was pale and exhausted after his tantrum, and in other circumstances his caregiver would have insisted on a nap or at least a quiet rest, but as a guest was present John fixed on distraction to help his Little One recover his equanimity.

"Here?"
"Say bye-bye to the garden Sherlock"
"Bath?" queried Sherlock hopefully.
"I need a wee. NOW!" cried Sherlock. "It's coming OUT Daddy!"
"OLD MacDONald HAD a FARM... OINK OINK OINK OINK OINK OIN..."
"Good boy for telling Daddy in time Sherlock," John praised once the crisis had passed. The dressing gown had already needed a wash from breakfast, and nothing seemed to have made it through to the chair, thank goodness.
"Heart?"
A shake of the head.
"Hello there sleepy head! That was a long nap. Playing outside must have really tired out, hmm?"
"Hello dears! Did you have a lovely time playing outside Sherlock?" cooed Mrs Hudson, who had been a co-conspirator in organising the morning's outing.
A kiss to the boy's cheek and a squeeze of John's shoulder and the old lady was gone.
The Detective's mouth had fallen open in wonder merely at the sight of the glossy red tractor linked to a trailer stacked with straw bales behind it. He had been planning how he might manage to touch the shiny vehicle without Daddy noticing, and the idea he might actually be able to travel on it almost robbed him of speech. Overcome with shock and admiration, he pointed weakly and whispered "Tractor," in an awestruck tone.
Lullaby and goodnight,
"Ok. Now, take your feet out of them. Well done. One foot in here... And the other foot in here... Stand up... arms... yes, that's it, good boy."
"No, an accident is an accident: it's not naughty, and Daddy wouldn't be cross about that. Ever. So what did you do that was naughty?"
"Just a body suit then."
- tap tap
"Rah! Rah!" growled the little, snapping his jaws under his soft spiney hood.
"I played on the SWINGS and I was in the LEAVES and Daddy didn't know where I was and he looked everywhere and I was in the LEAVES and he couldn't find me."
Sherlock looked suspiciously at the proffered oatcake, before grabbing it and nibbling daintily at its edge. John returned to the kitchen, laid his head quietly against a cupboard door for a moment before decanting the milk from the cup to a baby bottle. Going back, he sat down by Sherlock, who now had biscuit round his mouth and down his shirt, and probably even in his nappy, but seemingly none in his tummy. John guided the detective's head against the front of his jumper, and Sherlock laid back quietly against him, taking the nipple as it was placed near his mouth, and began to suck. Soon his eyes were drooping closed with exhaustion, but he continued to drink hungrily, while John rocked him gently by his shoulders, making little shushing noises to keep him calm and settle him. As the bottle emptied, John stroked across Sherlock's cheek bone and exclaimed softly,
"Is that the sound you can hear in my chest?"
"Sherlock Holmes!"
The Detective was too tall for the short Doctor to carry comfortably up the stairs to their Baker Street flat, but Mycroft had wisely sent a driver who was roughly the size of a double-decker bus, and this man silently scooped up the sleeping Little as if he were no larger or heavier than the toddler he mentally became in littlespace.
"Goodness," said John weakly, "Is that all for us?"
"Come on now, sleepy, sit here." He patted the bed while lowering the infant onto its edge.
In the bedroom John had laid out two Little outfits: letting Sherlock 'choose' his clothes avoided many tantrums, and often provided his Daddy with a clue as to how old or young he was feeling. Today he seemed to be fairly young, so the outfit on the left was a short sleeved cream outsize Babygro spangled with red and navy stars. Sherlock pointed to the right.
"Ok, I think Daddy should feed you."
"Right. Stand up. Well, yeah, get up then." The tall Little half stood / half crouched while John cleaned him up with a wipe.
- tap tap
"Go outside now Daddy?" asked Sherlock, eyes widening with excitement as John realised his tactical error.
After some negotiation, the farmer showed the Little the controls of the vehicle, and with a blissful expression on his face he sat on his Daddy's lap to play driving. He was even allowed to press the horn once, but when Little hands started grabbing at the ignition keys, the two fully adult members of the trio silently and mutually agreed that it was time to get going. The Doctor safely got Sherlock and himself up onto the trailer, and Mrs Parkham turned on the ignition before setting off at a stately pace.
Sherlock looked as if he couldn't believe his luck in being allowed to sit so close to anything as dangerous as fire, and sat very still for fear of alerting his Daddy to the lapse of rules he had unaccountably permitted.
"That's my good boy. I'll remind you to think about it, and you won't be in trouble if you have an accident, ok?"
At this, the leaf pile giggled so hard it had to clutch between its legs.
"Swings!" gurgled Sherlock, laughing at the happy memory.
"Oh Daddy! A playground! Can I play Daddy? Can I play on it please?" begged Sherlock, eyes round with wonder.
"Even if I was really naughty?"
John placed them on the edge of the bath where Sherlock would not need to lose sight of them, making the whale do a little dance to make his boy laugh. He held both his hands while he stepped into the bath, and helped him to sit down without slipping. John placed the two toys into the bath, and the book on the side within reach. Sherlock submerged the whale with one hand.
"Alright, Little Frog, let's hop to the lounge and you can watch cartoons while Daddy gets dressed."
"But otherwise your clothes will get dirty."
The older man also felt in need of a rest to recover from Sherlock's long morning play in the fresh air. Shedding shoes and coat, as soon as he had made a cup of tea, he sat down in his armchair to read as many chapters of his current novel as he could before his toddler awoke and demanded his attention again. John loved looking after Little Sherlock - it took a lot less tactical manoeuvring than dealing with his adult counterpart - but a few minutes alone for a bit of self-care was still a welcome reprieve. Sherlock's headspace age might remain unaltered by the passage of time, but John's joints certainly were getting older.
Close your eyes, now and sleep;
"..."
"Do I really have to go to sleep now Daddy? I'm not tired yet."
Ignoring instructions the boy carried on playing as John chomped steadily through his toast.

The lower infant lip wobbled slightly at this word which had so recently been the cause of so much trouble, but bravely steadied itself at the sight of the plate of savoury treats.
"Oh," thought John, "This might not have been a good idea." He suffered through animal noises of varying levels of verisimilitude and noisy vowel sounds until the end of the song, and then turned off the music.
“I’m amendable to that.”
she thought, but Joan was going to tell her. Soon enough.
He turned around just in time to see his son blush crimson and turn near shy. Hamish was never
was John’s last coherent thought before Sherlock pulled back to look at him.
“John,” he confessed, his voice a pitch lower, “I must say honestly I’ve never been to a waterpark.”
“Speak for yourself, Mr. Six foot- what?” she teased and suddenly it wasn’t awkward between them at all. “Welcome to Florida.”
(See the end of the chapter for
You marvel, Sherlock thought, but didn’t say. You sunrise of a person that I have no right to and have been given anyway. And then, Joan’s voice in her mind, saying what she always said.
It’s the Holmes family motto,” Sherlock explained. “Well, not our official one, not the one of the crest-“
“If you do this,” John said slowly, painfully, “I will never forgive you.”
“They weren’t insulting you directly,” he explained. “They were just saying things about gays in general and being overall homophobic dicks- sorry,” he apologized immediately, shocked at himself for using such language in front of his father, but Sherlock waved it away.
“Jesus, warn a man,” John breathed out, careful to whisper. “And what do you mean I was right?”
John laughed, not easily deterred. “You can’t know that. You don’t even know me.”
“When is it?”
-disconnected-
All it takes is one foot in front of another. All it takes is raised hands in a classroom, notes scribbled in margins, projects handed in on glossed paper. All it takes to pass school is half a brain.
“Sherlock, oh thank god, I was going to call-“
He walked over to the couch to demonstrate. “I was near enough to the couch that after I sucker-punched Bossman, I could duck for cover if Armchair pulled one out.”
“I’m not nervous, don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock snapped.

There was silence on the other end as Hamish struggled to remember. “That’s right, we did!” he finally exclaimed. “Oh, okay. I was just really worried that maybe they died or maybe somebody had to come and take them to the zoo but maybe that person forgot and then we’d have to remind them otherwise the fishes would die-“
“How are you so patient with me?” Sherlock asked softly, never letting go of John’s hand.
“I can’t delete it John,” Sherlock confessed in a rush and John looked at him, puzzled.
As always, the support is absolutely amazing. You guys make me keep writing. <3
“Yeah, you were our very own cheerleader out there,” the smaller girl smiled and Sherlock rattled through possible snarky comebacks before realizing Marcie wasn’t being sarcastic at all. Instead she shrugged, stuffing her hands in her jean pockets.
They crashed, like waves against a rock, and pulled back to flow, side by side. They wrapped around each other like silk on cotton and John suddenly got it. Watsons and Holmes, of all generations and all centuries, all walked of life. Geniuses grounded by goodness. Patience rewarded with flashes of brilliance. And John’s heart hurt.
“And I am yours,” Sherlock promised back, promise ring hot around his finger.
John lays one, firm hand of Sherlock’s shoulder, anchoring him. “They caught the guy, the drunk driver,” Sherlock says softly. “Doesn’t change anything. I just kept thinking, is that what the families feel like when I solve a murder? Does it even matter? I can’t bring them back.”
“It’s okay, Sherlock. People are straight sometimes,” she said gently and Sherlock realized they were still holding hands. Neither moved to let go. “As long as it doesn’t bother you, I’ll work really hard to get over my feelings. But you’re not responsible for them. What’s most important is our friendship.”
“Shit,” John swore for the third time that evening. “You said you weren’t a lightweight.”
The kids cheered again and Sherlock looked positively bored. “Good,” Riley encouraged. “Let’s go over some safety rules then, shall we?”
“What I’m trying to say is I’m…well I think  fancy her. Like, properly,” Hamish finally finished. “We’ve been talking for ages but I don’t know if she’d be open to…more.”
“Jesus. Where are you?”
“He punched a boy in the nose,” the doctor informed Sherlock in a forced tone. “We are lucky his family is not pressing charges-“ here John had to pause to take a calming breath before continuing. “We’ll have to arrange with Mrs. Hudson to check on him for the next three days, unless you want to take him to work with us.” Sherlock understood sarcasm enough to recognize the offer was not a serious one.
“He’s cute,” she said, turning her grin on John.
Sherlock looked affronted. “Why ever not?” he asked, scandalized.
“Hey,” John panted, smiling at Sherlock with his hands on his thighs, breathing out. “A bunch of us are going to ASDA. You wanna come?”
There was a brief scuffle at the door and then Jordan’s voice rang over the shouts of his kids. “John, one of the lifeguards is on our porch.”
“Sherlock, we’re not taking him to the hospital. He just has a fever,” he tried calmly. “Don’t you Hamish? You’re a little warm, yeah?”
“Joan created and is now coaching our school’s first female soccer team,” Sherlock said and Shulamith clapped Joan on the back who, by this point, was more red than pale.
John sighs, sighs with the weight of a death on his shoulders that promises to be joined by more, and Sherlock lets him fall asleep against him, safe in promise that
“No, it’ll be quick,” Sherlock said; the thought of Joan standing in her moldy-ceiling, sometimes bedroom kitchen made her somewhat queasy. She let herself into the building and ran up to her apartment, stuffing a toothbrush, pajamas, and a change of clothes into her backpack before pausing in the kitchen to scribble
“That’s lovely,” Mycroft called over his shoulder, meeting up with Harry in the hallway and heading inside.
. This performance, these moments where every eye was on her and she was entirely visible and right and so
After the play ended, and everyone had taken their bows where Hamish had received a surprising standing ovation, he hopped off the stage and into the waiting, grimy arms of his fathers.
“It’s hardly your business now, is it?” Sherlock shot back, gazing at John with that same calculating gaze and John knew he was about to be ripped to shreds. “We’re just hooking up John, we’re not dating.”
“So read a book,” John said, eyes closed in the summer heat.
“Um, detective Hamish?” John called back hesitantly and Hamish paused. “Do you think you might want to get dressed first?”
“I don’t-“ he stammered, watching the lifeguard with undisguised horror and Sherlock stood.
“I still think about it sometimes,” Sherlock confessed, dropping Joan’s gaze. “The fetus. Baby. That July when it would have been born, I felt guilty for killing it for the first time.”
Blocking the door stood two men dressed sharply and they smiled down at the sixteen or so girls that had come from the Women’s center. “You all over 21?” one of them asked in a thick accent and everyone nodded. “Alright then, have a good night,” he replied, smirking and held the door open as they all piled in.
Sherlock moaned and John smiled widely, before faltering.
“We missed you terribly, that’s all,” John promised, kissing his son’s forehead. “You kept calling and calling us so Daddy and I decided we should come home early.”
“That is hands down the best thing I’ve ever heard.”
“Would you like to walk on your own?” Sherlock offered. “Or would you prefer to be carried?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Yes, before anyone asks, Hamish is singing "Waves" by Mr. Probz. Only because that bloody song has invaded my radio. I'm not sure if I like it or I'm sick of it.
they are.”
Hamish seemed elated by this new game and he untucked his own small fingers to bop his father’s stubbier nose. “Boop!” he hummed and he giggled when John ‘booped’ him right back.
It was John’s turn to snicker and Sherlock crossed his arms defensively. “That would be my brother this time,” he ground out. “He has a
“I had your voice in my head,” Hamish confessed blearily. “You told me to use my surround…sounds,” he struggled to remember as he was rocked, drifting deeper into dreamland.
“Now, yes. Took a while,” she tells him. “You have to learn what to do during a nightmare. Never touch them, you learned that the hard way. I get up and say his name softly from the corner till he wakes up. Doesn’t take too long.”
“Brilliant deduction John, excellent follow through. Well done,” Sherlock praised and John preened. “Entirely wrong, of course. It’s blue.”
Sherlock leaves, closing the door behind him and John falls apart, unseen and unheard.
“Excuse me?” Sherlock blinked.
, flooding his mouth and he had not been prepared for this part. He choked, too much at once, and tried vainly to swallow. He got most of it down, an awful flavor that he’d have to experiment with later, but some ran down his chin and neck. He wiped it off with the sleeve of his shirt and made a note to practice swallowing large amounts of liquid at once.
“Jesus Da, I haven’t taken her pulse!” Hamish cried, but his eyes were laughing. Sherlock adored prompting that reaction from him.
“No I cannot believe the secretary didn’t expect the students to go rifling through her drawers in broad daylight,” Joan deadpanned and Sherlock glared at her.
“Seventeen,” John fixed, looking down. “I never told anyone. You know how boys are, they hear you shagged a seventeen year old and it’s all whoops and catcalls.”
“Yes you do,” he repeated, unsure of himself. “You always have. I helped you fill out the application; we took the tour together. You loved it there; I saw it myself.” They had taken a tour together back in the fall, wandering between the old buildings and asking questions just to stump the tour guide. There had been a heady moment when someone had mistaken Mycroft for his father and the older man still wasn't positive why the assumption had made him feel so smug.
He comes back not knowing what to expect, but it appears Sherlock would like to proceed with not talking about it. They have sex on the couch, Sherlock pulling off John’s clothes so fast he loses track of where they land on the living room floor. And then he’s kissing every inch of John’s skin, every strangely placed tan line, every newly formed muscle and healing bruise.
Sherlock froze. His already tensed body seemed to seize up further and he turned to Hamish unnaturally slowly, looking at him with unsure eyes.
“Dull,” Sherlock clicked, all sharp tones. “Besides, that’s what I have my dear Wendy for.”
“This is Mycroft’s towel,” Sherlock murmured and Joan laughed.
“Because my older brother grew up and now he’s stupid,” Sherlock told him and John nodded again. Harry had grown up and had stopped playing with him too. She said toys were stupid. He never wanted to get so old that toys became stupid.
173 days Sherlock
Perhaps, but Sherlock’s
“Go sit in the gazebo with your counselor till the activity is over,” Sherlock instructed, getting up. “You don’t want to get that thing wet for the next six hours.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So what murder are we re-enacting today? Because I’m not a fan of one that involves me at the bottom of the lake.”
“Today is Thursday?” Sherlock checked and John nodded. “Then I’m fine for a while.”
“I’ll bring him over now,” she agreed, walking away, and Mycroft stayed long enough to watch the ambulances with his baby brother and brother-in-law pull away in a cloud of smoke and blood before following her to the car.
“We were gonna leave without you,” Marcie chided, pulling Joan into a hug and then quickly letting go. “Girl, we are washing your pits in the bathroom when we get there. What have you two been doing, running a marathon?”
“But it’s the one we all say. Even Mummy, even though she just married into the Holmes family. He taught it to her. She used to whisper it sometimes when we played Chess, as she killed my King,” Sherlock told him.
“John, I have your room all set up. Mummy was going to give you the
John blinks at him. “You mad bastard,” he grins, petting his cheek. “I adore you.”
They’d done some version of that dance a few times since, rubbing together without much of a plan until one of them came and the other would get herself there a few beats later. But thus far no clothes had come off and no ones hands had gone below the other’s waist. Since her pronouncement in April, Sherlock had been waiting for it. What
“Really,” he laughed. “I’m not, nor have ever been, attracted to any other man beside you. You’re just an exception,” he said, his fingers running lighting paths of fire on Sherlock’s skull. In a distant way, that worried Sherlock. Being an exception was hard work; it meant you were not someone’s comfort zone. It meant you might one day get chalked up to teenage experimentation and discarded. But now wasn’t the time to dwell on that.
“Sherlock, you can’t just not eat,” John sighed, an old argument.
“Your turn,” John said, jolting him out of his thoughts, as he turned to lean against a tree.
the teenager was.
“Well that’s statistically inaccurate,” Sherlock spoke up. “At least a hundred million woman are pregnant right now, many of which are in labor this very minute-“
She was going to throw up. No, she was going to scream. No, faint, pass out,
“Brilliant,” John smiled warmly. “You are absolutely brilliant.”
“My head hurts, Papa,” Hamish murmured, voice fever-pitched. “It’s like there’s a whole zoo of apes and gorillas and monkeys and the monkeys have a drum set and the gorillas have two cymbals and they keep smashing them bang bang against my squishy brain.”
“They said it’s a drug’s bust,” Hamish whispered to his father as soon as he drew near enough. “Why would there be drugs in our house? Do we need to warn Ms. Hudson?”
“Erm-“
Sherlock hated the infantile term but Hamish himself had coined it when he was three and faced with a Sherlock “black mood.” He’d stood by the couch, confused as to why his father wasn’t playing with him, before announcing, “Daddy’s dark like a thundercloud.” The name had stuck.
,” John insisted.
“How old were you?” John asked.
At the touch of skin on skin, a strange soft of jolt went through John. He couldn’t explain it, but the sight of the boy’s long, thin fingers getting lost in his own tan ones made his stomach pool with heat.
“Yes,” Sherlock said and John turned to run up the hill with Mike, oblivious to Sherlock’s gaze that followed him until he was out of sight.
John felt like his heart was breaking but it was his job to be the better out of the two of them at staying firm. “She does not belong here,” he responded simply.
John smiled, utterly besotted with his small offspring. “Being a boyfriend can be very hard,” he admitted, sitting down in the chair across the table. “It takes a lot of work and a lot of compromise. Do you know what that word means?”
“Yes, it was,” he sighs, defeated. “I’ll sleep there for now, till they… stop.”
“Goodbye Sherlock,” he said gently as the airport loomed large in the cab’s front window
“You’re beautiful,” Sherlock said honestly, one hand reaching up to stroke John’s cheek and in a second, the moment went from intense heat to slow-burning care, gentle and loving.
Sherlock stared at him and for a minute John was scared he made a mistake and went too far but then Sherlock was kissing him and babbling and it took John a minute to hear what he said.
Annie made a distinct wail and Hamish reached into the sling pocket to fetch out a bottle. He took his daughter one-handed from his father with a practiced ease and gave her the bottle that she latched onto happily.
“These are so bad for you,” she scolded, and Mary grabbed her hand as they headed down the street towards Joan’s apartment. “You expect me to kiss you when your mouth tastes like an ashtray?”
p.s. I'm always open to suggestions for what our boys should do this summer.
“Congratulate me.”
“What do you want from me, Jim?” Sherlock sighed, exhausted. He felt like he’d been here for hours.
“Sherlock, we are not having sex in a tent,” John practically giggled. “You are not having your first time in a sleeping bag with rocks digging into your back. When- if- we do it, it will be in a bed with pillows and there may or may not be candles involved.”
“So-“ John stared but Sherlock cut him off.
“I want to,” he said, sure of himself for once. “Besides, I figure it’s a skill I should invest in learning.”
The sitting room was cleared of clutter. Piles of papers were taken off chairs and hid in the bedroom, boxes were shoved under the couch and suddenly a walking path appeared for the first time in two years. Hamish came over to Sherlock as he was finishing peeling pictures from three murder sites off the wall.
she suggested gently, testing the waters
Mycroft took a moment to look, really look, at the boy in front of him. Where had he been at age seventeen? Confused and following down a path set by his parents most likely. “Hamish, what are you doing?” he asked gently and the seventeen-year-old seemed to collapse.
“Just breathe for me, love," John whispered and Sherlock did, chest shaking and soaked in sweat and John pushed and then suddenly there was heat, hot and pulsing, all around him and John let his head fall back and
“Are we there yet?”
“I’m so sorry,” she mouthed to John and he shrugged easily, unfazed.
“Hm?” Sherlock hummed, lost for a second in a section of her book.
Use of a period-typical racial slur
“No, she absolutely shouldn’t,” Mycroft threatened, “Or I’ll be forced to tell her of the Christmas nursery pageant.”
“I love you,” Sherlock said suddenly, and John looked up. “I feel like I don’t tell you that enough.
He found their old position easily and John sighed. He felt John drift off to sleep beneath him within minutes but Sherlock’s mind was positively buzzing. John often asked him why he loathed sleep and Sherlock hadn’t been able to explain it wasn’t that he loathed it; it was that he simply couldn’t turn his mind off. He had to wait until he was wretchedly exhausted and then his body would shut his mind off for him. On normal days, like this one, his mind was reeling with new information
“Mycroft-“ John stared and stopped himself. “I shouldn’t. it’s not my business. I don’t even want to know really.”
“Please fuck me, Sherlock,” he begs, eyelashes down, for a minute the same innocent teenager he once was, dirty words so wrong on his lips.
He also spotted the lifeguards. They tended to travel together, all tall, well built, and very tanned. It only took John a minute to realize pale, thin Sherlock was not among them.
“Experiment,” she answered, the
“I abhor them,” the boy replied, closing his eyes, . His lashes truly were too long for a boy’s. “Then again, I abhor most people, so that’s hardly surprising.”
“Those poor kids,” she murmured. “I never understood jumpers. Always seemed like the worst way to go. And she’s a nurse too, seems she’d know how much it would hurt-
Breakfast was a loud affair. Mycroft had taken one look at the disheveled teens and had spent the meal conspicuously knocking his cutlery into each other.
“Daddy kept winking at people,” he explained as though it was obvious and then the whole room burst out laughing, short giggles interspersed with real chuckles.
“Right,” John said softly. “I forgot, you’re younger than me.”
I have a little free time coming up (jokes. I've just given up sleep) so y'all can expect a yummy short story coming your way. And there is this massive beast of a story stuck in my head that is coming out eventually! You guys are gonna love it. It's got everything; kidlock, teen love, angst, feels, awkward sexytimes, fluff, PUPPIES, and maybe even a Blingo or two.
“You seriously have the best parents, dude,” Chloe laughed and then brightened up as the line moved. “Quick, I think they’re letting people in.”

opera- but you’d never say it out loud, afraid you’d look queer.”
“Mycroft you need to get to Sherlock now.”
“About that-“Greg started but the thirteen-year-old peered behind his uncle, utterly confused.
Sherlock felt his stomach drop out from under him as his arms crossed across his chest and he let out one (very manly) scream. And it wasn’t even for John.
sexy about safe sex practices and god, he needed to get laid.
“Marcie- as in the girlfriend Marcie?” Sherlock asked John quickly and his husband nodded. “Well then that might be appropriate,” he agreed with Hamish.
“Sherlock, are you sure-“ John tried to protest around Sherlock’s insistent mouth.
“How will we get back?” John asked as they stood in line. Was he supposed to pay for Sherlock’s ticket? Or would the posh boy want to pay for his? Was this even a date? Should they each buy their own tickets?
“Sherlock, you did not read all the books in the world,” John insisted offhandedly.
“Those aren’t your pajamas,” he said but Sherlock was too tried to do more than roll her eyes at him.
Sherlock looks down at the dead man who, until five seconds earlier, had been pummeling the living daylight out of Sherlock. “I suppose so.”
“What are we doing?” he asked instead, turning to face Sherlock. Sally’s words rang in his head but as background noise now, barely surfacing, and he pushed them down with the same heavy-handed fuzziness Sherlock’s orgasm had left him with.
Sherlock gasps, breathless. “I would let you,” he moans, breath hitched, and then John is kissing him, devouring him, open-mouthed and sloppy and Sherlock has never felt more complete, noses bumping against each other, fingers scraping against offered flesh, pushing up shirts and dipping down into the waistband of trousers, tugging and palming and Sherlock holds back a sob as he comes, muffled against John’s mouth.
“Let’s go,” John said stiffly and Sherlock smirked, swinging himself around and up with the grace of a ballet dancer. He winked at John like something out of a porno, and by the love of God did it make John sway, and then
“He’ll only be here for a month,” Sherlock tried to reassure but John felt condemned. “Do you want me to-“ he tried and John shook his head.
things to a person. “It’s as though I can actually see the starved hamster in your brain as it starts to run on its little wheel. Amazing.”
Eventually, Joan maneuvered them both to lie on their backs, Sherlock’s head laid down between the cavern of her breasts, as Joan’ left arm rubbed small, soft circles on Sherlock’s back. Sherlock could feel the day catching up to her, tugging at her edges into sleep, but with the last bits of her consciousness she muttered, into the rise of Joan beneath Sherlock’s own shirt, “You’d never manage, you know.”
“Mum,” Harry groaned and Cynthia relented.
“I gave her my number to stay in touch, and she did,” Victoria squeezed Cynthia’s hand, and the two friends grinned at each other, for a moment still young mothers in their twenties.
“Your welcome, jeez. Don’t have a fucking cow over it,” Sherlock grumbled, rubbing her arm. Joan smacked the other arm for good measure and then pulled the brunette into a hug.
“You chased down a murderer without telling anyone where you were going?” John wants to cry.
Mycroft stood. “Shall we go eat cake?” he suggested and for once Sherlock did not make fun of him but agreed with the rest of his family. And so the child consulting detective ate chocolate cake in the dining room for lunch on his eight birthday. And if he didn’t take his new scarf off, well nobody said anything.
“Fuck, Sherlock, we gotta go- it’ll take us ages to get downtown from here,” she swore, brushing waste off her jeans.
“Do you know what’s great about drunk sex?” John asked, leaving Sherlock’s mouth to trail kisses down Sherlock’s neck and the younger boy arched against John, sending more friction to their suddenly-tight jeans. “You can last
“No,” Sherlock says with all the force Jane gave him. “I’m done sleeping in separate bedrooms. Now, teach me your favorite strongholds and we’ll figure out how I can get out of them.”
John let out an almighty sigh. “Why the hell did you name the bear? Scratch that, why Cesare?”
The room felt transformed. In a fit of madness, they’d draped the duvet and bed-sheet over the higher surfaces and with the night wind blowing in, it felt like they were in a tent, soft silk and Egyptian cotton flowing around their punch-drunk heads.
Sherlock’s eyes flared dangerously. “Get out of my home,” he said suddenly, tone undeniably firm.
So now all Sherlock said was, “Good.”
“Vivi, it’s barely July,” Cynthia laughed, reminding the whole table she was the only person in quite possibly the world who could call Victoria Holmes
“Take your hand off my thigh,” John ordered, and Sherlock smiled as his breath hitched.
The very idea of sitting down and having it all out in one healthy, functional conversation between them was so repulsive to Sherlock as to not even entertain the idea. Instead they’d talked out in snippets over weeks- flashes of conversation as they waited in the hallway between class or in the back of the movie theater where Kelsey worked and could sneak them in for free through the staff entrance.
“What do I do?” Hamish slumped in the armchair. “What did you do when you figured you fancied Pa?”
Their life wasn’t normal, in any sense of the word, with them running after criminals at four in the morning and heads in the fridge and cold curry before they crashed on the sofa. But they were happy, even though John couldn’t hold a girlfriend and Sherlock sometimes forgot they needed to pay bills.
“I thought-“ John gasped,” you were bad- before. But drunk? You’re a devia
The first time John has a nightmare, Sherlock wakes up to screaming. It takes him two seconds to right himself, and four to shake John awake. John starts with a scream halfway out that turns into a gasp, that turns into strangled sobs.
“Did you go chasing that silly murder in the Bronx?” he murmured, combing through her hair and Sherlock raised her eyebrows at him in the mirror. “The mud on the bottom of your jeans that you didn’t quite scrub out, very distinct. I saw it in the paper on Friday too, not surprised you went running after it.”
upset her?
John was packing his bag. Sherlock knew he was and yet the action made no sense, John kneeling gently and placing folded clothes in his suitcase.
“John, your boyfriend’s here!” Jordan called out and everyone laughed, Sherlock included.
I had a lot of fun playing around with this one. It's a bit in Hamish's voice, if you can't tell, but still narrated. Have fun with it :)
“Did anyone come looking for you?” Joan asked.
“There were some doctors from Barts’. They were really informative.”
He had a feeling that was not proper pre-bed behavior and so he rushed with the shirt, finding a cotton t-shirt hidden amongst his rather pretentiously silk pyjamas. When he brought it in, Hamish took it gleefully, pulling himself out of his own clothes without so much as a by-your-leave.
“Right!” Joan roared back. “Okay let’s get to organizing. So we’ll need to make a petition-“
John thought they were happy.
“I’m not badly injured,” Sherlock said and John spluttered. “I’m not, John. Moriarty was careful. These just look bad, that was the point. It wouldn’t have done him any good to kill me.”
Sherlock really was Peter though, and that was what made it all so wonderful. He ran reckless around London, finding adventure in the most mediocre and John followed him devotedly, a proper Wendy. He was caustic like Peter too; a bit too bitter and honest for adults to handle, and it thrilled John that he could watch someone as wonderful and real as Sherlock.
-call disconnected-
Sherlock waits till John’s long gone before he calls, tea gone cold. He goes to the house in Norwich, a house that screams 2.5 kids. A woman answers the door, tall with long black hair swept back in a braid. She smiles at him.
“Now that is a bloody wasted opportunity.”
“Because I know you’re just as human as everyone else,” John said and Sherlock did cry, with John pausing to kiss the corners of his eyes as they overflowed. It should have been shameful, Sherlock hadn’t cried like this since he’d been small, but with John is somehow wasn’t. He hadn’t realized how much of John he’d been holding carefully, like a bomb about to go off, until John promised him he wasn’t in danger of losing it.
“We had to, the knife was down there,” Sherlock found herself giggling. Said knife sat in a ziplock bag next to them, still covered in a bit of sewer grime.
As soon as the house was out of view, John closed the window and the two men turned to face each other- twin smiles gracing their faces.
John smiled at him, reveling in the cool water. “Have to say Mike, you’re a genius.”
“No, but we all read his father’s blog,” the woman tittered and Mycroft disliked her instantly. “Is everything alright?”
“I assumed that was a given,” Sherlock murmured and Joan beamed at her.
, oh god Sherlock,” John moaned, losing all sense as Sherlock shamelessly rubbed the small bundle of nerves, using the distraction to slip in two fingers, scissoring the older boy open.
“Sure.”
“Sherlock listen, the Met can’t just go arresting people because some boy says he proved in his backyard they did it,” Lestrade explained but Sherlock wasn’t listening.
What?
“What should we do with it?” Hamish whispered, ashamed at his lack of knowledge in that department.
“My turn?” Sherlock puzzled.
They have the party at seven, and people clog their house. All these people Sherlock never remembered collecting. Sarah in the corner, holding a beer. Ms. Hudson bearing biscuits, followed by a helpful Cynthia. Greg and Mycroft, arms around each other’s shoulders, by the sofa. Mike and Molly, with Lily, now toddling along, between them. Sally and Anderson standing awkwardly in the kitchen, trying to be kind. Harry and Clara, rubbing Clara’s pregnant stomach in an armchair. Sherlock spots Jane, arm around Brendan, standing by the door and he waves. She blows him a kiss.
“Shut up. How’s London?”
and he raised one hand to graze Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock shuddered into the touch, eyes closed, and John said,
“You know I am,” Joan smiled and Sherlock ignored the thud her heart made. “But it’ll have to wait. Feminist club is having a meeting tonight to plan the action for next Monday.”
“You are Wendy,” Sherlock reminded him. “You are Wendy Darling, and you are going to grow up and marry another Wendy Darling and have a bunch of little Wendy Darlings.”
“Oh, we’ll come alright,” Sherlock murmured in John’s ear and the older boy colored.
“I want to be a pirate,” Sherlock said in all seriousness and John laughed. Sherlock loved making John laugh, it was like sunshine. He never made anyone
he reminded his heart.
“I’ll pick you up later today and if you’d like-“ he paused, unsure, “we could walk in the park afterwards. Perhaps we could feed the ducks?”
He didn’t remember falling asleep but he must have because he was awoken by the sound of his door creaking open. A small figure stood in the illuminated space, backlit by the hall light. “Uncle Mycroft?” a sleepy voice called and the elder Holmes sat up, groaning internally.
” John checked, watching the couple recede from view.
“You never make enough for leftovers,” Sherlock said with an air of finality. “If your mother was still living here, when you made dinner, you’d make enough to leave some for her when she gets home. You only ever make enough for us.”
“I’ve never-“ he tried to explain but John just smiled at him.
the damn opera.
No words had ever made him want to kill himself more than those, uttered in anger and not meant in the slightest. He had never apologized, properly anyway, for shutting John out of his life for two months. He’d suffered for it. Punished beyond the limits of the Geneva Convention. And now John was leaving, possibly for good, and he-
“Yeah, found it off base. You’d like it, it’s-“
With the kids happily swimming out to the lake toys, John settled in the gazebo with Mike and prepared to wait out the activity. They were twenty minutes in, Mike in the middle of telling John about one of the baking counselors who he was into, when a scream came from the middle of the lake.
She paused. “No,” she said honestly and he appreciated that. “But you’re family. And he’s comfortable with you.”
The bar was right by Washington Square park and Sherlock could see couples wandering off towards the darker benches, hand in hand. Women littered the sidewalk outside, smoking and laughing and, in the case of a girl in a leather jacket and a redhead in too little clothes for this weather, making out against the side of the guardrail. Sherlock felt something akin to fear curl in the base of her stomach and Joan only held her hand tighter in hers, following the crowd towards the stairs.
“Sherlock, we’ll get kicked out,” he hissed even as his body betrayed him and his legs spread wider to make room for the tall boy to reach down a hand and tug at his zipper.
“John,” Mycroft smiled, all Cheshire cat, “care to switch rooms with me?”
Not where I thought you were going with that.
“It's just the law, sitting right here,” Lestrade piped up from his chair and Sherlock shot him a withering look.
“She’s my sister Sherlock. You don’t just shove family into institutions when they’re down,” he says. He feels old. He feels so inexplicably old and sad.
“Sherlock, I just
“Hi everyone!” she called out. “Welcome to our very first Young Feminist’s meeting!”
“Yes they have,” John said and Sherlock gaped at him.
It was the sweetest kiss the boys had ever shared, filled with nothing but unshaking devotion and Sherlock set down his violin to bring both his hands to John’s waist, tilting his head to kiss the older boy properly.
The platform was busy but they made their way down to a darker end that was close to empty to wait. Sherlock stared as a mouse scuttled over the tracks and then turned when she heard a small noise.
“John-“ Sherlock tried but fuck it, he was rambling and he intended to finish.
How did she feel?
It wasn’t particularly romantic, what with the pervading smell of nature and smoke and the sweat dripping down in between them as they panted in the dark. It wasn’t even that amazing really, both of them far too young and inexperienced to manage more than a little slice of wonderful. But it was theirs and it felt like a stolen moment, undeserved and ridiculously treasured.
“It was my pleasure,” she said in answer to all of them and Joan leaned in to plant a dry kiss on her cheek.
“You’re not gonna like what I have to say, but I’m worried about your head,” Joan said once they were dressed. Sherlock’s clothes were comically big on Joan, she’d had to cuff the pants twice and hand rolled up the sleeves to her elbows. “It sounded like you hit the bathtub hard, you might have a concussion. How’s the skull?”
“Sorry, did you say Sherlock?” a woman across from them, middle-aged with gray at her temples and a clean, simple wedding ring on her left hand, asked. Sherlock nodded, uncomfortable. “I’ve never heard a name like that before; it’s really pretty.”
Two points, my lovelies. Yes, I know Sherlock's text don't have a signature. It's cause he's not sending them, not cause I'm lazy.
“Git, mostly,” John confessed and Sherlock held back a snicker. John turned to Sherlock and squeezed his hand. “I’m gonna go get drinks, wait here,” he ordered and left Sherlock with Mike.
They got dressed in pajama pants and tee shirts, Sherlock snuggling deep in John’s gray tee, before heading downstairs to the kitchen. John made tea and they ate the leftovers from last night’s dinner, stopping every so often to smile at each other and link fingers.
John thought a minute, keeping eye contact with the steaming child in front of him. He was such a mix of the two of them at that moment, black curls in a dramatic flop with a signature John scowl gracing his thin face. It made John’s heart beat just a touch faster.
“Are you okay to drive?” Sherlock squeezed out.
They found a bottle of Scotch in the kitchen cabinets and brought it upstairs, not even bothering with glasses, to Sherlock’s room- the room with a lock.
“I’ve just never-“ Sherlock gaped and John took his hand.
“Do you have Vaseline?” Sherlock asked suddenly, his eyes never leaving John’s, and John was reminded of a documentary he’d seen once about lions and how they stalked their prey.
By the time Mycroft made it to the kitchen, Hamish was already in his own apron with one laid out for Mycroft on the wooden table. “Are we gonna try the Baked Alaska today?” he asked giddily, bouncing back on the balls of his feet.
Harry stared at him, amazed. “How did you know about Kelly?” he asked, shocked.
“Daddy,” Hamish replied simply and led the march onwards as the light turned green. He suddenly lit up. “I can’t wait to show Daddy my spelling test. He helped me learn all the words and I got a hundred! Really I got one wrong but there was extra credit so Mrs. Teacher said it was all a hundred anyway so he’ll be really proud of me I bet.”
John snickered, and Sherlock smiled at him. It made John’s skin feel hot and if he didn’t figure out what it was about Sherlock that made him feel like a teenage girl soon, he was going to hit something.
“I had been wondering for weeks how a man who still wears the sneakers he had in high school managed to afford at least the down-payment of such a nice, new car, and then Joan dropped the answer right in my lap,” she began and yes
John reached out and squeezed Sherlock’s hand; it wasn’t often he got to hear his husband say “I love you.” But Hamish still looked troubled.
“For christsake, just tell us what they decided!” someone yelled at the TV and was immediately shushed by the pack as they leaned forward to better hear.
“Oh god no, those things are vile,” Sherlock said, making a face and John laughed.
“Gross, no. We are never playing private school,” Joan gagged and Sherlock felt her skin burn. “Alright you dicks, peel out. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Hamish thought as he climbed the stairs. Who else could it be? “Mrs. Hudson?” he called up as he approached the landing and pushed the door open.
John looked up. “Really?”
“I’m not opposed to recreating that,” Sherlock smiles against his ear and John shudders.
“Hey Da,” Hamish called back. “Is Pa home?” he asked, dropping his bookbag by the front door and toeing off his shoes.
And yet John could no longer imagine a life without Sherlock, a life where he didn’t have an incredibly annoying and incredibly brilliant man nattering in his ear, reminding him he was
“Shut up and keep kissing me,” Sherlock orders, breathless, back against the wall. There’s a mop digging into his thigh and he profoundly doesn’t care.
They separate and head home, running to the shower at the same time. They pause at the door, staring each other down.
He was and within minutes of picking a spot towards the top of the mountain, John had the tent set up and was rolling the sleeping bags inside.
, actually growled and John felt his stomach drop out. “Stop talking and fuck me.”
“You really don’t have to come,” Joan said to her one evening after practice, the heat from her shower curling around the locker room, restoring feeling to Sherlock’s spider-fingers. “Don’t get me wrong, I love having you here. But I was watching you today- you were wearing three scarves.”
“Can you come in five minutes?” John challenged and Sherlock nearly keened beneath him, fingers digging deep into John’s shoulders to stay up.
“Look, maybe this is none of my business,” the dark-skinned girl said quickly, “but you need to be careful with him.”
How’s your dorm?
“He’s delirious,” John explained and then spoke to Hamish softly, like he would to a baby. “Hamish love, Papa needs you to open your mouth and then put this little stick under your tongue. Can you hold it there for me?”
They packed up the car with the tent and the two sleeping bags Sherlock stuffed in the garage, complete with a cooler of food the chefs at the Holmes manor put together. John slid confidently into the driver’s seat and Sherlock settled in next to him, toeing off his shoes and placing his socked feet on the dashboard before John even started the car.
“Do you make a point to meet every staff member?” the teen asked, raising one eyebrow.
he whispered and Sherlock knew, in that whisper, how much he loved her.
"That's the end of the album. There isn't another one," lied John smoothly. "Why don't you do some deducing for Daddy? Show him what a very clever boy you are, hmm?" Predictably Sherlock swelled under the praise, and immediately forgot all about wanting to do loud singing. "Who do you think is in that van in front of us?"
"You can have one last go on the swings, but you have to try to go for a wee first" said John seriously.
Sherlock answered by running towards the slide, with arms out and hair streaming behind him. He started to scamper up the steps, but waited for his Daddy's approval before climbing to the top. John nodded his assent to the ascent, but found his heart was in his throat as his Little One stood at the top, a shadow outlined against the wide blue sky. The detective was his usual fearless self, and had whizzed down the slide and run past his caregiver and up the steps again before John had conquered his parental nerves.
"Daddy's sorry, Daddy's sorry," urged the Doctor, pulling the hysterical infant in for a soothing cuddle. "Everything's ok now, I've got you, everything's ok."
"Now, let's see how quietly we can sing, shall we?"
"It's a good job I chose your dino bowl this morning" laughed John, placing warmed mushy Weetabix laden with sugar in front of the dino-detective. "Do you want to feed yourself this morning, or should Daddy do it?"
"Because I nearly had an accident?"
"Ok. Take the boiler suit off again. No, you know how to undo poppers Little One. Just pull. No, like... Yes. Hold onto my shoulders while you step out of the legs. That's it. Now sit on my lap for a moment, and I'll undo your shirt for you. And pop your arms out? Trousers... No, you'll have to stand up for a moment. No darling, not the pull-up. No, you need that. Unless?"
"Ribbit, ribbit," croaked Sherlock, leaping along the floor, waiting for John to open the doors ahead.
"I don't
"It can be a competition between us," added the Caregiver swiftly.
"Ok sweetheart, but Daddy's going to have to move if you want another bottle."
John kept up a steady stream of quiet chatter in the car: about the joys of tea to come; the cozy fire; the story he would read at bedtime. Sherlock became steadily less responsive, and eventually dozed off, much as his caregiver had hoped.
- DEAR JOHN, THAT WOULD BE LOVELY THANK YOU, LOVE MRS. H.
"There you are dears!" exclaimed Mrs Parkham. "Now then, Sherlock dear, we could have a lovely walk over to the animals, or," and her eyes sparkled with fun, "we could drive over on a tractor, but I know lots of Little boys wouldn't enjoy a tractor ride at all! Which is it to be?"
"Not now Sweetheart. We've already been outside, remember? You played on the swings."
A bit of down time.
Does the title chapter refer to the events or the writing? Or both? Only one way for you to find out...
"OK Little One, time for bed, I think," said John, rubbing small circles on the boy's back to lessen the shock of waking. "Someone is tired out. And I think you are too, Sweetheart".
"Another one! Another one!" The child clapped his hands in entreaty.
Sensitive to any implication that he was not a real toddler, Sherlock's wails increased in volume. John was instantly stricken with guilt.
"Come here and let me change that nappy of yours. I don't think it escaped a soaking during all that hysteria earlier!"
The T-Rex nodded under the detective's guiding hand.
He held out green and white striped jersey shorts with a drawstring waist for Sherlock to step into.
"This little piggy stayed at home,
"You gave me such a fright! Silly Daddy," agreed John, pulling him in for a hug.  "Let's go and explore and see what we can find, hmm?"
The Russian version of the Little Prince always creeped John out, but Sherlock loved the serene and surreal film. John had never been clear whether Sherlock understood every word of the Russian script or not a syllable, but either way, it absorbed the curly headed boy, caught between adulthood and infancy, innocence and wisdom, time and eternity.
"Can you be a very helpful boy and give your old Dad a hand to toast the crumpets? But we need to be really careful because we're going near the fire and it's hot, ok?"
Sherlock wavered, indecision etched in every line of his face and body. He didn't want his nappy changed, but he didn't want a smacked bottom either.
"Right. Let's get you ready, Little Man. Can we...?" The Doctor gestured vaguely towards the bathroom.
"Where do you want to start?" grinned John.
"Eat your food, Sweetheart," coaxed the caregiver, as a lump of cereal splashed out and landed in Sherlock's hair. John congratulated himself for choosing breakfast before bath!
- tap tap
"I think someone is tired and hungry, hmm? But you didn't do what Daddy said." Sherlock's head sagged further into John's shoulder. "I know you're tired and upset, but I think you need to sit in the corner just for a bit while I get your bottle ready, hmm?" The head shakes, and after a moment, John feels dampness seep into his upper sleeve as tears drip from his boy's eyes.
"Beautiful," smiled John, "You look beautiful".
"Good boy", he added as Sherlock returned wrapped in his fluffy dinosaur dressing gown.
"Here you go, Poppett", said John, slipping a dummy into the Little's mouth. Sherlock grinned happily around it.
Once Sherlock had been settled down and strapped in, John fiddled with the entertainment system, skipping albums and tracks until he found a compilation of children's songs sung in an annoyingly bright fashion. It would probably drive him mad in about 15 minutes, but a restless Little on a car journey could manage to drive him mad in less than 10 minutes. Sherlock began to hum along, joining in the bits he could remember properly with gusto:
Sherlock, once again entirely deshabillé, ran to the bathroom eagerly and began pulling out toys from a basket under the sink. John, following on behind, put the plug in the bath and turned on the taps. Pouring Matey bubble bath under the running water, John declared,
"Mmmm!!!" grinned Sherlock, licking his lips and patting his tummy in appreciation of the sweet drink.
John sprang into action, quickly shoving an empty ice cream tub under the detective just in time to stave off disaster.
Daddy attempted to look stern at this further breach of manners, but instead burst into laughter. He might be setting a poor precedent, but the look of astonishment on the boy's face was just too funny. Sherlock began to laugh too, more out of sympathy than understanding, and was soon rolling around on the rug kicking his legs in the air and clutching at his nappy area. Once the Doctor had calmed himself, he stroked Sherlock's back and helped him to breathe more slowly to calm him down.
Making a quick recovery from the disappearance of his beloved Pugwash, Sherlock looked up questioningly. It wasn't often that he got to go out in Littlespace.
"Where did he go?"
Nod-nod.
"I think it would be a good idea if you had a go at using the potty Sherlock."
"It's what we're here for Sweetheart," laughed John.
"Ok, all over now. Let's pull up your trousers and get you sitting comfortably."
Before John could follow his counting with his inevitable interjection of
"No-o-o!" shrieked Sherlock, who was apparently horrified by the suggestion and began shovelling thoroughly mashed cereal into his mouth faster than he could swallow it. As much seemed to end up on the detective as in him, and John tried not to look at the state of the table and surrounding floor. Having finished his juice while playing with the solid food Sherlock began to roll the lidded cup with his right hand while trying to finish his food with his non-dominant left. This did not go well, and John was just thinking that Sherlock had perhaps eaten enough and could be let down from the table when a panicked look shot across the boy's face.
When John returned with arms filled with blankets, cushions and cuddly toys, Sherlock rushed over to him eagerly.
"You can choose three toys, Sherlock, but don't get into the bath until I'm back here."
The men's ever-indulgent landlady found a sippy-cup and filled it two-thirds full with tea, topping it up with milk and handing it to John. Sherlock clapped his hands with glee, as the cup was lifted gently to his lips and he began to suck greedily at his treat, feeling like an especially grown-up little boy. John transferred the two-handled cup to Sherlock, and stroked the boy's curls lovingly.
"Hey, that's cute!" chuckled John, and took a picture on his phone.
The next morning, John was woken by wailing, and he honestly couldn't think of a better start to the day. He pattered downstairs into Sherlock's room.
The roads became steadily smaller and twistier, and the hedges higher and closer: motorway, A-road, B-road, minor road, single track. Sherlock had eventually dozed off, and John gave him a gentle nudge as the car turned on to an unmade farm track.
"Two more handfuls, then Sherlock", he said, holding up two fingers to help the child understand.
After about half an hour, the car turned in to a residential street, and stopped outside a metal gate of a central enclosed garden. The car's driver wound down his window and silently handed John the key to what could be their own private park for the morning.
Sherlock giggled again, and John dialled their neighbour's phone, handing the receiver to Sherlock to say hello to Mrs Hudson. But the baby was suddenly overtaken by an ucharacteristic fit of shyness and refused to speak. John could hear Mrs Hudson's voice, tinny and far away:
The Little Detective slithered out from his imperfect hiding place and scrambled to his feet, head held low.
" he whispered.
"But we're going to have tea with Mrs Hudson. That will be nice, won't it?"
Sherlock placed himself on the porcelain throne and smugly tinkled out a short stream, feeling he was really proving his maturity and thus likely to win the Big Boy Pants battle. But John stood his ground, and moreover, stood holding out a pull up for his Little to step into. Rather to the surprise of both, other than supplying a venomous look and a gusty sigh, the Little lad decided to cooperate, and was soon snugly padded. All was not entirely plain sailing, as the toddler temporarily decided if he had to wear a nappy, that meant he didn't need to wear anything else, and defiantly stepped his feet into his green frog-faced wellies. John knew he should tell Sherlock off for bad behaviour, but he looked so funny and cute in his idiosyncratic outfit that he laughed out loud and wrapped him up in a big hug instead. He felt so full of pure and innocent love for the curly headed man standing in a puffy tractor-patterned pullup and rubber boots that he felt almost overwhelmed. Sherlock was so discombobulated by his caregiver's behaviour that he accidentally allowed himself to be reinstalled in his blue boiler suit without further argument. John smiled and gave a little tap to the baby's padded puffy behind to point him in the right direction, and hand in hand the pair went out into the sunshine to join the farmer and see the animals.
"Yeeaahhh…!" yelled Sherlock running towards a big pile of leaves and jumping right in, laying on his back and starfishing to make leaf angels, and for the joy of hearing and feeling the leaves rustling and crumbling beneath and around him. John laughed out loud at the happy scene, and settled down under a tree with a book and a flask of tea, but largely ignored the reading matter in favour of enjoying the sight of his boy playing. It was so rare that Sherlock had the chance to run around like a normal healthy child really needs: excited contentment was spreading from the detective in delightfully infectious waves.
"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!" they both grunted together in unison, laughing. John gently sat the Little Detective up.
"What was all that about, hey?" A comforting squeeze to Sherlock's drooping shoulders. "What was so bad about getting out of a smelly old nappy and into a nice clean one?"
"Time to go out and get a breath of fresh air, hey?" said John, turning off the TV.
John sighed, and thought for a moment. It was a warm day, and if he was complaining he was too hot now, he would be even hotter running around outside.
John continued to transfer crumpets from plate to fire to plate to while Mrs Hudson loaded them with butter, marmite or honey, according to the preferences of each. Sherlock (honey) was soon a sticky mess, but his good humour was entirely restored, and he submitted to his face, hands, arms, hair and legs being scrubbed clean with a flannel between crumpets by whichever grown-up was closest at the crucial moment. When the trio could eat no more, John returned to his armchair and held out his arms for Sherlock to come and rest on his lap.
"Now then, this bit's difficult, so I'll put the crumpet on the toasting fork for you. There you are... So, kneel right here, that's it, and hold it over the flames. Alright?"
"What are you up to, Little One?"
"Oh baby, Daddy's sorry. He was just scared you would get hurt, he wasn't thinking what he was saying."
, young man, must be Little Sherlock." The lady, who was none too tall, reached up to pat the boy on the head, but finding it beyond her reach enveloped him in a big hug instead. "I just love having Littles visit my farm. You're very welcome here. Now, you must be tired after your long journey. Why don't you go and wash your hands, and I'll get lunch ready. Bathroom's just over there."
"How? It's alright with real toddlers, but he's taller than I am!"
Sherlock leaned forward, plucked a nearby daisy, and slowly picked off the petals one by one. When he had completed his important task he crawled away, picking and gathering flowers before returning and depositing them in John's lap.
Sherlock sighed sadly, and John sat down heavily beside the prone baby.
"Shh, shh, now baby," soothed the caregiver, rocking him gently and smoothing his hair. "Shh, shh, just for a moment while Daddy gets your tea. It'll be over in the blink of a tired eye, yeah?". John stood slowly bringing a strung out and clingy Sherlock with him. "You can have Bunny to keep you company, and I'll be back in no time. Then I'll feed you your bottle, how's that?"
"SEESAW!" yelled Sherlock, and against his better judgement John helped him to climb up before seating himself at the other end. Sherlock loved the feeling of flying through the air, but the old soldier's knee soon began to bother him, and he was forced to persuade the excited Little to choose another game instead. John held the boy by the shoulders, grounding him and keeping him focused.
"Come on, let's call Mrs Hudson and show her. Do you think she'll recognise her little boy with a big grown-up moustache?" queried John in mock anxiety.
"Car is stole... Affaire... Needs a wee... Left the oven on... Needs a wee... Looking forward to something on Thursday... Bursting for a wee... Really bursting for a wee..."
Sherlock nods wearily. John leans over and picks up a floppy soft brown cuddly toy and takes Bunny and owner to the living room. He guides Sherlock to the corner, presses gently on his head, and hands him his rabbit. The detective takes it and hugs it eagerly, before slumping forwards with his head against the wall. John bends down to kiss the top of his head before heading to the kitchen.
"No!" Sherlock shouted through the door for good measure.
"Higher, Daddy, higher!" yelled the Little one, even as John pushed him almost to horizontal. Sherlock could have played on the swings all day, but after quarter of an hour the older man's joints were beginning to protest against the big child's weight.
"We'd better get you dressed first though. Can't be wearing just a nappy when we've got guests. Don't worry," he added swiftly, sensing a tantrum brewing below the surface "Nothing big. Mrs Hudson loves seeing you in your playclothes. How about a nice comfy bodysuit?"
Sherlock considered the matter thoughtfully, and nodded with great solemnity to accept the challenge.
Thanks for the kind comments, and sorry for the sporadic updates.
"Tractor," replied Sherlock more firmly, drawing himself up to his full height.
"If you find me some more, I'll make you a daisy chain" offered John.
"No, I did a wee already," replied Sherlock solemnly.
"I'm afraid you're going to have to have a smacked bottom. Why are you going to have a smacked bottom? Well?"
. That one's EASY!" And just like that, the Little Detective was off, prattling on about the drivers and passengers in the other cars on the road: the man going about his daily business as a tax inspector; the woman leaving her husband; the couple who had accidentally brought the wrong baby home from hospital in 1971 and never found out. John half-listened while scrolling through his phone to check arrangements.
"Long day," observed John mildly. The two sat in silence, revelling in the closeness, physical and emotional. After ten minutes or so John spoke up:
The meal mostly continued in a happy silence, broken only by the Caregiver reminding his Little that it was politer to eat with one's mouth closed, or that kicking chair legs would damage them, and by encouragements to eat more of the good food by the farmer. But eventually the guests could eat and drink no more, and it was time to move on to the main event.
"I think so, yes."
"OK, let's get this nappy changed then, shall we?" asked John, with a slightly weary smile. Sherlock nodded sorrowfully, the fight gone out of him. John fondled the side of Sherlock's face softly. "Good boy" he added quietly. Feeling Sherlock relax at the encouraging words and calming manner, he leant forward to smoothe his boy's curls back gently from his forehead. Turning back from a large drawer, John put supplies on the bed and gave Sherlock a little tap on the thigh. The baby bent his bony knees and rested his feet flat on the bed, while John unfolded a new nappy and untaped the old. Another pat, and the detective lifted his bottom for John to slide out the used nappy and place the fresh one under him before Sherlock tiredly lowered himself again, head away from the doctor. John smoothed Sherlock's hair again before giving his hand a quick reassuring squeeze. He cleaned him up carefully with wipes before dusting him with powder and taping him into his new nappy securely.
So saying, he lifted Sherlock's head and upper body away from himself and stood up, gently laying the little one back along the sofa.
Having snapped a soft, warm long-sleeved grey t-shirt spangled with stars over his nappy, John appraised Sherlock thoughtfully.
"Ooh, how lovely of you to phone me. Aren't you grown up, calling me on the phone?"
"Gah! It was meant to be a secret!" exclaimed John, realising he had given the game away.
However, as the Detective had deduced, the grown up was pretty keen to go himself. Sherlock began to squirm frantically but refused to let his caregiver help him out of his trousers, and John knew that the situation was reaching crisis point. Accepting the inevitable with a sigh, he moved his hand away from the other man's trousers and towards his own, and unzipped his flies.
"Really? It's completely dry, even though you were wriggling on your bottom earlier but now you seem quite comfortable? Well, that is a surprise. No I thought not: it's about to burst! Come on, lie down," coaxed John, knowing that a change would not just clean him up, but also lull him towards sleep. Sheltered from prying eyes by a large tree, the Doctor pulled off Sherlock's trousers and padding, throwing the soggy nappy in a nearby bin. Going to take fresh supplies out of the bag, however, John was dismayed to discover the nappy pocket empty except for a pair of cotton power-ranger pants.
"And this little piggy had none.
"Mmm," answered Sherlock, glowing under the praise.
Both started to sing in an exaggeratedly quiet manner, John's voice in particular becoming softer and gentler as he subtly turned down the volume of the sound system too. Sherlock was becoming a little mumbly by the end of the song, but the good Doctor's hopes that he might drift off for a morning nap were dashed at the end of the song.
"Do you need a wee Sherlock?" queried John sleepily.
Sherlock shook his head, but also looked a bit shifty. Oh no, not this routine again, thought John wearily, who had been looking forward to resting his own eyelids.
"Lean back a bit... That's it... There we go, now hold it close to the fire to do the other side. Good boy."
It was only a few steps over to the barns, so the farmer drove them out of the farmyard, over a small stream, and down to a large duck pond, before bringing the party back to the main entrance to the sheds. The tractor slowed to a halt, and John lifted his boy down from the trailer, and gave his hand a squeeze as the three happy people went on to the main event.
"Good morning little man," he exclaimed as he openned the curtains.
Keep your grey eyes closed tightly
"Have you got your coat? And your Bunny? And you did a wee?" Sherlock nodded to each of these, so John gathered up the discarded pile of things, and ushered himself and his boy out of the door and into the back of a waiting car.
Mind now filled with the idea of injury, Sherlock's shrieks found a new level of shrillness.
John frog-marched him towards some bushes discreetly screened by trees, and began to pull down his trousers for him.
Bath time!
"Wee wee wee all the way home", and John tickled the boy under the armpits as he wiggled and giggled with glee. John realised his mistake in winding up the Little as Sherlock began to splash his arms and legs in the water, drenching his Daddy in a tsunami of bathsuds. Knowing he wasn't misbehaving on purpose, John decided to calm him down with a story rather than telling him off.
On returning to the living room the doctor found the baby asleep. Loath to wake him, but knowing he would be better off in his bed, John roused him as little as possible, pulling him up under his arms and supporting him to the bedroom.
"You're the king of the castle!"
"Ok Big Boy, I don't think Mrs Hudson needs to know about that bit." blurted John, blushing furiously. "Why don't you show her some of the lovely leaves you collected, hey?"
"No, your heart keeps you alive. But in a way my heart keeps you alive too, because I love you with all of my heart, and there's nothing I wouldn't do to take care of you."
Lullaby and good night
"Swing yourself for a bit, sweetheart, hmm? I'll go and get lunch set up and call you over when it's ready." John unrolled a rug under the tree and spread out a feast designed to delight the heart of any child. Crust-free sandwiches; dino-nuggets with ketchup for dipping; sausage rolls; fizzy orange and three kinds of cake. For once, the detective did not need to be called twice for his dinner. Thirsty from his morning's play, Sherlock began to gulp down the orangeade at an alarming rate, pausing only to let out an enormous belch.
"Even if you were the naughtiest boy in the whole world!"
"Well, hello then dears! Lovely to meet you. You must be John, and
" exclaimed John, "One... Two..."
John pulled out a tin basin from under the seat, pulled down Sherlock's lower garments, and pulled the boy onto the potty just quickly enough to stave off disaster. It seemed as if the torrent would never end, but eventually it did, and John asked quietly
"I'm a grown up. I can wait til we get home".
Sherlock did as he was told and John lathered up his curls, soothing his scalp with a small massage. He felt the child relax under his hands.
"You don't have to eat it all," laughed the farmer. "My husband and the farm workers will be eating after you. Eat all you want, but don't forget to leave room for cake!" She gestured to the pine dresser, where the largest, most beautiful Victoria Sponge sat on a stand, just waiting to be eaten.
Given Sherlock's absorption in his play, John decided now would be a good moment to give himself a wash and a shave: a rare chance to get something done while keeping an eye on his little one. Moments later a squirt of whale water landed on John's freshly soaped cheek.
"Look, Sherlock! That's you!" he said, showing his phone. The toddler frowned and pointed to his dummy.
The leaves giggled again.
Settled comfortably with his back against the sofa, Sherlock sucked contentedly on a juice box, and bounced up and down excitedly as John put on his Captain Pugwash DVD. The doctor patted his head, and left him to shower and get dressed. Faint cheering and booing wafted from the living room as the crew of the Black Pig took on the evil scheming Cut-Throat Jake. John was always puzzled by the occasional gasps of surprise that accompanied scenes of mild peril: how Sherlock could possibly find anything remotely unexpected in a DVD he had seen so many times before was a persistent mystery to John's adult mind. It was adorable. And reassuring: while the detective was so engrossed in the TV he would not be getting into mischief during his Daddy's absence. John took advantage of the downtime to read a little, but when he heard the closing credits ring out for the fourth time he felt that he had left his little boy to his own devices for long enough.
"Lovely, I'll see you outside the back door in a few minutes, then."

"Are you sure?"
"At the farm. Look! No, look out of the window. Let's see who can be the first to see an animal."
Draped in roses and starlight
Humiliation narrowly averted, John began gathering tea things while the Little held forth on the subject of his latest collection to his appreciative and impressively patient audience of one. He could hear a typical Sherlockian mixture of scientific exposition and childish prattle floating through to the kitchen area:
"Why did you lie to me Sherlock?"
The Detective returned to his search, while the Doctor operated on the daisies, putting into practice long-forgotten skills to thread together the pretty flowers. Sherlock crawled back and forth, and after a few little journeys John leaned forward and placed a garland around his Little One's neck.
"Trousers?"
"That's my clever boy," praised John.
John tucked his Little One up on the sofa. Sherlock held Bunny under his arm and stroked its soft furry ear with his right thumb and inserted his left into his mouth with his fingers hooked over his nose. At times the boy leaned forward, mouthing the words along with the characters. At others, he nestled amongst the cushions or against John's shoulder. As the film progressed, the nestling became more frequent than the leaning, and John made up a bottle of warm cocoa and slipped the rubber nipple between the sleepy baby's lips. By the end of the closing credits, the sound of suckling had been replaced with slow snuffly breathing, and the good Doctor was trying to decide whether to rouse the boy to get him into bed or whether to lay him down to spend the night on the sofa, when the bottle dropped from Sherlock's grasp onto the floor with a soft thud, waking the infant.
"Well done. Let's have a little rest for a while and let our dinner go down, hmm?"
The boy ran off towards it, the sorrows of the future forgotten in the joys of the present.
John and Sherlock are still at the garden.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Socks? Your head will fall off if you shake it that hard!"
"Ok, out we get," encouraged John, holding his arms out with a fluffy towel patterned with a farm scene watched over by a benignly smiling sun. Sherlock heaved himself out of the bath and into his Daddy's arms for a warming hug.
- tap tap
"Good night, you little nutter" said John fondly, and left the room knowing Sherlock would sleep until morning.
"Well, that was lovely singing Sherlock, but we wouldn't want you to wear out your voice, would we?"
"And dungarees?"
John got out of the car to empty the pot. He returned with a solemn face.
The pair nibbled their way through the food, and John was hopeful that he might manage to persuade the Little to attempt an alfresco nap as his head began to droop after the unusually large meal.
"... xylem and phloem... probability of canine arboreal micturition... the bestest colour is RED... degree of percentage of spoliation..."
"Good boy. Lie back and I'll rinse your hair for you."
"Sherlock? There's going to be a bit of a change of plan. You're going to have to wear pants under your trousers. If you need a wee, you have to tell Daddy and he'll help you to go like a big boy. Can you be very grown-up and help Daddy by telling him when you need to go?"
The Detective nodded agreement.
John stepped firmly towards the door, face set. He opened the door to an apparently empty room. It did not, however, require the services of a consulting detective to spot a 6-foot toddler curled up under the bed.
"Thankyou." said John, "Right, up you get" he added, patting the bed. Sherlock did as he was told, still avoiding John's gaze. He lay at the end of the bed, and finally looked quietly towards his caregiver.
"Yes, Daddy's going to give you your milk darling."
"Of course dear. Do you have everything you need?"
Never one to pass up an opportunity to impart knowledge, whether to humans, balloons or plastic toys, Sherlock acquiesced. Sometimes John suspected that toys might be the detective's ideal audience in any headspace, as they presented no risk of contradiction of facts or expression of emotional opinions.
"I know what I want to watch Daddy," whined Sherlock, pulling at his caregiver's sleeve.
"DID I WIN DADDY? DID I WIN?"
John hurried to put on the album again.
"Bath." confirmed John.
"This little piggy went to market,
"I think that's ready now... Yes. I'll put it on a plate and you can carry it very carefully to Mrs Hudson."
Washed and relieved, the pair returned to the farmhouse kitchen with its traditional scrubbed wooden table, flagstone floor and large unlit inglenook fireplace. But neither noticed these charming details, distracted as they were by a feast of fresh goodies. Golden Scotch eggs, heavy pork pies, flaky sausage rolls, chilled lemon barley water, rosy apples, downy apricots, a baked ham, fresh cottage loaves, and salad leaves just picked from outside the door.
