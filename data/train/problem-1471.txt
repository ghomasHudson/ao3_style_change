“Steady on, Watson. They seem an easily offended sort. We’ll be home within the hour.” Holmes spun Watson around and pressed him into the wall.
Watson short-circuited his methodical exploration by dragging Holmes against himself and grinding their hips together. He nipped the detective’s ear.
Holmes had not seen Watson for a while. Three days, 8 hours and 46 minutes, actually. The detective was not hovering; he was not staring. He was being deliberately, obstinately normal in how he treated his friend. Or at least, he thought he was. They had been thrown so far from their normal, Holmes wasn’t entirely sure what it had been all this time.
Joining this pack was a punishment for both John and the betas. The betas had been brought in front of the
“Besides, your mate gave us permission,” the doctor cut him off mid-rant.
Rosie's chin wobbled for a moment before she stood a tiny bit straighter. “Rosamund Watson, I'm five. Who are you?”
“What did you parents call you as a child then,” John twisted a bolt on one of the sides of the basinet, before cocking head. Blast it all to hell. It was the wrong damn piece.
“Enough!” Lestrade shouted. “This is a crime scene people.”
John growled, long and low in his throat, when Donovan pushed Sherlock back on his heels. It was instinct that had him pushing between the two antagonistic pack mates, baring his teeth at the female beta.
With a guttural cry, Sherlock shot his seed into the damp grass. John’s hips shot forward, knocking the omega into his own spent seed, as his knot began to swell. The Alpha forced it past the swollen rim of the omega’s entrance. Growling in pleasure, as his knot continued to grow.
“Daddy there's a glass broken on the floor,” Rosie was at the door, a squirming Dodger in her skinny arms. John abruptly remembered the sound of glass breaking and giggling abruptly cut off. He cursed lightly under his breath before brushing past Sherlock.
Sherlock's stormy eyes gleamed in excitement. “Thank you, I will. I've never actually had a meat pasty.”
Rosie glanced away from the tree and at Sherlock. “It wasn't Krampus that took her though.”
“Does pica run in families?” John pondered for a moment, before dismissing the line of questioning. “Have you eaten a proper supper?”
Lestrade didn't let Sherlock's tone put him off his lovely mood. “You could do some leg work of your own mate. You are turning into Mycroft at this rate.”
John bit his lip, trying not to smile at the irrational omega. It hurt to hear his cub referred to as devil spawn, but it was half Sherlock after all.
“I’m not pregnant,” Sherlock repeated, frustrated with all this baby talk. “Will you please get that ridiculous notion out of your head.”
John raised his snout, scenting the air. The copper tang of blood was heavy, so familiar. It was like being back in Afghanistan. Where it always smelled of blood and sweat. He could hear the sounds of the betas’ blood lust as they gorged themselves on the stag’s intestines. The wolf found it exciting, but not as stimulating as the arousal that permeated Sherlock’s scent.
to go back to the place he still thought of as home, but it simply wasn’t possible and therefore Sherlock’s suggestion was upsetting him.  It wasn’t specifically Sherlock’s fault that John’s rage was rising and so he shouldn’t take it out on him unless it later transpired that Sherlock was deliberately provoking him.  Right now, that was unlikely.  If anything, Sherlock was simply being thoughtless.
NC-17 fic
he thought angrily as he grunted a reply.
Smiling, John took his door keys from his pocket and went home to the only life he had ever wanted.
“Sally and I have never had an affair. She came over to my house that day because she needed a friend, and because I and my wife have been friends with her ever since she and I first met at the Yard. Her sister Teresa had had psychological problems for years, and that morning the police in Croydon had phoned Sally and told her that Teresa had taken a deliberate swan dive off the top of a multi-storey car park.”
My Mum never really understood but, bless her heart, wanted me to be happy and – to my surprise – called me Callie from that day on, only occasionally and accidentally slipping into my original name. And when I started calling myself Ariane DeVere for fic-writing and macro-making purposes, she just nodded and accepted that too.
“Why am I so bad at judging women?”
John had had many terrible days since Sherlock’s death.  That Saturday seemed worse than most of them.  When he first got to 221 he felt fairly strong, especially after spending some time with Mrs Hudson; she was very weepy when talking about Sherlock’s and John’s time living in her house, and John went into doctor mode and was kind and sympathetic with her.  When he managed to get away he went straight up to the second floor and emptied his wardrobe and chest of drawers, putting everything into the same boxes he had used to move in all that time ago and which had been stored in the spare bedroom next to his ever since.
“We want to know more about him,
“And she’ll be coming too?”
“I will if you buy the pretty coat,” Emily told him.  “Imagine how you’d look with the collar popped and the wind whipping the tail out.  Buy the pretty coat!”
,” she said firmly, turning her head to include both of them, “and don’t you dare tell me that you would let a murderer go purely for the sake of ‘
dishy.’  You’re allowed to still only think that women are attractive, if that’s how you feel.”  She sighed.  “Oh, John, dear, stop being so closed-minded.  You can be in love with one man – one particular man – and it doesn’t have to change your whole outlook.  I’m not even saying that the two of you have to start going at it like rabbits from now on.”
Basically it’s nearly 3000 words of sadness and misery.  But I love this story.  It’s the one that stubbornly insisted on being written despite me not wanting to.  After the idea had popped into my head – and I had fought it back, telling it, ‘Are you
Sherlock lifted his head and stared at John’s wide grin, then scowled mock-ferociously.
at you – you left the laboratory three minutes ago and you haven’t stopped smiling since.  You’re scaring people in the corridors.”
Sherlock drew in a breath through his nose and, still mumbling but with a tiny bit more volume, said, “Saint Bartholomew.”
A party for John and Sherlock. Anderson and alcohol. What could
~~~~~~~~~
Ten minutes later, after giving Mrs Hudson one last hug and promising that he would keep in touch, John piled the last of his possessions into the back of his car and drove away from 221B Baker Street for the final time.
It is never sensible for an arctophile like me to google images of teddies, and I had to firmly stop myself from buying about forty-five of them to add to my already large hug of bears.  But the image above kept cropping up and each time I would think, “He looks about right,” and would click the weblink and then realise, “Oh, it’s him again!”  After about the fourth time, I took the hint.
“I don’t want to be a

A persistent tickly cough, and advice that over-the-counter medicine would actually be cheaper than if John wrote a prescription. The patient seemed indignant at being offered the less expensive option, believing that prescription medicine must by its very nature be more powerful. A tired explanation that ‘expensive’ didn’t mean ‘better,’ and a disgruntled departure full of mumbling that next time she would go and see Doctor Sawyer instead.
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision – he noticed the bear in a shop window because it had more than a passing resemblance to Janet Draper’s teddy.  John stopped and looked at it for a while, weighing up whether to risk buying it.  It wasn’t expensive and eventually he decided that it wouldn’t be too much of a waste of money if, as was more than likely, Sherlock was not impressed by his purchase.
“I’m fine, Emily.  As you can see, I’m definitely not dead.”
“It’ll never be all right, Mrs Hudson,” he said shakily.  “I don’t understand any of it.  Why did he do it?  Why did he lie about making up Moriarty?  I
“Don’t think for a moment that I’m starting to get sentimental, John,” he said.  “It’s just more practical ...”
His voice broke again and he pulled his hand free, standing up and walking across to grab the wardrobe door.  Tempted as he was to slam it shut, he stopped himself just in time and instead closed it gently.  He ran his hands over his face, took in a long deep breath and blew it out again, and turned back to his former landlady and gave her a brief apologetic smile.

he had to find a way to reintegrate himself into society, but since losing both his military and medical careers, what was the point?  The tremor in his left hand and the stupid psychosomatic limp meant he couldn’t even stack shelves in a supermarket.
ANDERSON: Oh, don’t pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that.
The Land Cruiser finally found a gap in the traffic and turned right and after another bout of indicator-changing, the driver finally settled on turning right as well. “It’ll be busy in the village,” he said happily over his shoulder. “But never mind; we’ll get there eventually.”
He knew that Ella was right, but some days it didn’t seem worth choosing to keep living.
“No-o-o.”
Sherlock remained motionless for a while but eventually nodded and went to sit in his chair.  John picked up a book, sat on the sofa and tried not to glance up too frequently to watch his friend as he sat with his hands steepled in front of his mouth, apparently lost in thought.  They didn’t speak for the rest of the evening.
“Like what?”
“Don’twantyouto,” Sherlock mumbled.
I looked around at the man who had been standing beside me for some time but who – until now – hadn’t spoken since we had been introduced. Like me, he had been watching Sherlock and John across the room as they stood side by side and talked with other guests. Sherlock, not surprisingly, looked utterly uncomfortable with the entire proceedings but John was grinning and happily accepting all the handshakes and hugs, chatting with everyone who approached them and flirting outrageously with some of the female guests.
--------------------
She rolled her eyes at the matching looks of confusion.  “Seriously, I’ve never seen two people who are more suited.  You’re clearly utterly in love with each other; why won’t you just admit it?”
The shrieking and hysterical laughter which followed almost got us thrown out of the bar. Up until the time that Mum died in 2012 I never dared tell her that she would always be known to my friends and readers as the “why were they kissing” lady – I’m not sure she would have understood how much joy that incident at the National brought us, nor how it inspired an instant challenge for all four of us to incorporate Mirith’s phrase into our next fics. It may be a strange way to be immortalised, but Mum, you’ll be famous forever!

Emily chuckled delightedly.  “And was I helpful to you?”
“It’s a private hospice,” he said softly.  “Jesus, Sherlock, is it one of your parents ...?”
“You’ll have to get clean first,” Emily told him.  He scowled at her but she returned his look resolutely and made her voice stern.  “You can’t go reeling into crime scenes while you’re under the influence of drugs.  They’ll just arrest
In a show of utmost respect, he addressed his fallen colleague the same way he always had.

John blinked against the prickling feeling in his eyes.  Sherlock stepped a little closer and looked at him pleadingly.

Emily looked at him sternly.  “Stop this behaviour right now, young man.”

“Tell me about the boys, if you wouldn’t mind,” Emily asked.
The following morning Sherlock was still quiet and pensive, although he frequently looked across to where John sat reading or typing responses to comments on his blog.  Occasionally he lowered his hands as if he was about to say something but then raised them and covered his mouth again.  John didn’t try to encourage him to talk, just flicked a glance across at him to acknowledge the movement.

, a 221B fic which ends with John kissing Sherlock for the first time. When I next went to see her I left the stories with her after somewhat awkwardly explaining that, in the part of the fandom that I followed, we liked the two main characters to be romantically involved. This information clearly didn’t sink in at all and when I next saw her and asked what she had thought of my stories, she frowned and said, “Well, I didn’t understand one thing: why were they kissing?”
But then John’s heart melts into a puddle of pure adoration when Sherlock turns towards the girl and drops to his knees, sinking back on his heels so that he isn’t an intimidating height over her. He smiles up at her mother so sweetly, silently reassuring her that he is no threat, that her frown begins to fade. It’s the most beautiful sight that John has ever seen and he’s not sure he will ever be able to breathe properly again.
“He kept it.”  John’s voice was barely a whisper as he stared at the teddy bear sitting on the shelf inside the wardrobe.
He had a feeling that he had actually gasped out loud because the person sitting in front of him half turned her head, apparently wondering what she’d missed onstage to provoke such a reaction. The other reason he was sure that gasping had been involved was because, while the pain in his stomach was fading, his chest now hurt. Apparently he had sucked in a large lungful of air but hadn’t yet got around to letting it out again. For some odd reason he didn’t seem to be able to remember how it was done.
“I can’t stay here,” he told her.  He picked up his toiletries with one hand and offered the other to her.  She took it and stood up and they left the room, Mrs Hudson closing the door behind them.  Leaving her to make her way back downstairs, John went back to his bedroom and packed up the last box.
“What?”

He hears the first whispers about the mysterious “Moriarty” and finally tracks him – or them? – down and is put on the path to a less boring finale to his life.

“Now I don't know what happened, but I can tell you, that woman was not the type to kill herself. Too fucking mean.” Luther took a sip of tea.
“This is a lot to take in,” John murmured. “Why don’t you tell me a bit about yourself?”
John couldn’t get the word out of his head. Pregnant. Sherlock was pregnant. With his cub. Pregnant. Expecting. Knocked up. Up the duff.
“Sherlock,” John began carefully, “we should get you to a doctor.”
Twenty minutes later, John walked onto his first civilian crime scene. His hackles were already on the rise, as he listened to Sherlock shouting at Sally Donovan and the insipid Anderson. If two betas more worthless then those two existed, John would be terribly surprised.
Sherlock leaned against the doorjamb and watched Rosie twirl around the dining room, Dodger in her arms, as she hummed a Christmas song tunelessly. He could hear a faint clapping sound, that almost seemed to be cheering the little girl on.
Mrs. Hudson had tried to talk John into disallowing Sherlock to continue his consulting work. John had realized early on that nothing was going to dissuade the man from doing what he wanted, when he wanted. And in all honesty, John wouldn’t want it any other way. Sherlock was passionate about his work. The work. In his mind, it was the only thing that mattered.
He had seen how having Rosie had affected Mary. Had watched the woman he had thought he loved slowly losing herself to madness. It had been a slow, deceptive spiral. Until one frigid night in February  he had found Rosie strapped in her car seat, bawling, her face red raw with tears and snot.
Now that Rosie was enrolled in school, Luther picked her up afterwards and entertained her at his house until John could escape the clinic. He tried to pick her up by 4 PM each and every day and for the most part he kept that promise. There were always exceptions. Emergencies happened after all, and he was a doctor. When John ran late, Luther took it in stride. He never made John feel like a horrid father for having to work to keep a roof over his kid's head. Sometimes the older man would have dinner waiting for him, and it was positively domestic. It really was too bad the man was strictly into women.
“I got proof,” Sherlock grinned. “I got audio of Red-beard talking and thermal reads of extreme temperature drops and spikes.”
It was practically a declaration of love, coming from Sherlock. John hid a smile, as he dialed the local Korean shop. The owners were becoming increasingly familiar with the occupants at 221 B Baker Street.
Sherlock sat down cross-legged in front of Rosie, making the little girl giggle. She detached from John's leg and mimicked the other man. “Will you tell me a story?” Sherlock asked the little girl.
John slipped into the exam room, drawing the ire of the hospital gown clad omega on the bed. John smiled weakly at the doctor with the clipboard, before starting towards Sherlock.
Mrs Hudson still had the angry spirit of her ex husband trapped in the basement apartment of 221 Baker St. She was perfectly content with that arrangement, thank you very much.
Sherlock turned his attention back to the drama on the telly. “Yes.”
John tightened his fingers around his cup and looked out on Rosie again. “Sherlock thinks it might have something to do with the weird things happening in the cottage.”
John laughed. “That's why your podcast is amazing.”
One year later, John and Rosie were living at 221 B Baker with Sherlock and Dodger. One of the spare bedrooms was just that, a spare bedroom filled with boxes and detritus. Sherlock had had his way, and John had not argued. Much. Luther visited often, and had become fast friends with Lestrade, much to Sherlock's chagrin.
John cleared his throat from beside him. “Meat pasties for your tasting pleasure,” he called out mock formal to his daughter. Rosie yelled in delight, inspiring Dodger to howl a little stuttering bark, that was ridiculously adorable.
John sank down into his armchair. Not for the first time, Sherlock wished he had chosen to sit closer. Close enough to touch. It was a side effect that Sherlock had not been aware of, before this little mishap.
“Nicknames are a sign of affection,” John mumbled.
“Uh huh,” John huffed tiredly. “What did you eat then?”
“From that place down the street?” Sherlock’s attention was snagged.
“Thirteen,” Sherlock answered. “In 1978, they all disappeared without a trace.”
The door to the flat opened. John walked in, heading straight for the blasted tea kettle. Not for the first time, Sherlock wished the alpha was a bit more observant. It wouldn’t take more than a casual observation to see that Sherlock was horny and in need of a bloody good shag.
“No,” John did not even hesitate. It wasn’t even a question.
“Of course,” Sherlock sniffed again. “If you had an ounce of deductive reasoning, we would have been shagging ages ago.”
Maybe that should have been the first sign that there was something off about the cottage. How careful he had become with people being left in the house alone.
John put one of the Beatles' albums on the old turn table, and he and Rosie bopped around the kitchen as they worked on supper. They were making one of Rosie's favorite meals, meat pasties. With a five year old fluting the edges of the pre-made pastry, they were not the prettiest of dinners, but they were damn tasty if John said so. John could hear giggles echoing around the dining room, that were not coming from his daughter. At this moment Rosie's tongue was peeking out from the corner of her lip, as she studiously worked on her pastry skills.
“Krampus is a story,” John started to explain. “He's the opposite of Santa Claus, he kidnaps kids who misbehave.” He was a little startled that Rosie knew who Krampus was. He didn't think teachers still talked about him. And he certainly wasn't the type of parent to try to scare his kid into good behavior. Though, if he had remembered the stories of Krampus, he might have.
“Who says this hypothetical baby is even yours?” Sherlock snarked.
His body was revolting against him. Before the bump, Sherlock could go days without food. He could function without sleep. Now, he couldn’t even walk down to the corner shop without feeling exhausted. According to the idiotic doctors John took him to every month, Sherlock had mild anemia.
“Pray tell, what is so amusing, Doctor?” Mycroft looked imperiously down his nose at John.
So was the apprehension Sherlock was feeling at the idea of stripping out of his clothing in the middle of the clearing, witnessed by two betas he didn’t trust, let alone particularly like. It made him feel vulnerable. Which in turn made Sherlock want to lash out at somebody. That lucky somebody happened to be John, who was standing next to him. Calmly stripping out of his trusty oatmeal colored sweater and dark, utilitarian trousers. Sherlock had no idea why the man hid his body under baggy clothing. He had nothing to be ashamed of. Peacetime had not made him soft or complacent.
Sherlock glanced at the snow too. He did not relish the idea of trudging along in it. “Thank you, I appreciate the hospitality, and this delicious dinner.”
Defiant to the last, Sherlock was not easily taken down. The dirt and grass around them was torn up, as they battled for dominance. The rest of the pack circled them, their howls mingling together in the dark clearing, as John finally pinned the omega in the dirt. Still, Sherlock did not bare his throat.
“Just be glad I am not outside eating dirt or rocks,” Sherlock shot back. “Mummy had pica with Mycroft, which I suppose explains a lot.”
They all sat down at a long table, that was well weathered. “Sorry,” John muttered, looking slightly embarrassed. “We do everything at this table. We eat here, do arts and crafts. First aid. This table sees it all.”
She couldn’t help but wonder if that meant she was going to have a new brother or sister to play with soon.
It had taken time for John to find a caretaker for his girl. There had been days that he had to take her to the practice with him. She had thrived under the attention of both patients and the administrative assistants who had coo'd and baby talked her. John himself was not a baby talker. He preferred to talk to Rosie like she was a tiny adult, and he thought she appreciated it more as well.
And he preferred it that way. Sherlock didn’t care what the peons of the pack thought. He just wanted to run, to not be bored.
John could feel Sherlock’s nerves strung tight. He lightly brushed his fingers over the omega’s nape, stroking softly. “It’ll be fine,” John soothed carefully. “Running will make you feel better.”
“He’s omega, but not from a pack you’d know,” Mike murmured.
“In 1978 there was quite a few disappearances,” Sherlock began.
He knew the bare bones of a story, missing children. But what happened to them and why this cottage? Sherlock was going to have to talk to somebody who knew Mumbles in the 1978 and who would be willing to talk to him. Which was going to be harder than one could imagine. People did not always like to talk about dark days, especially in once rural villages that were becoming a hub of tourism.
Being a were wasn’t black and white. It had shades of grey that were hard to describe to the human populace, not that it hadn’t been attempted, many times. Every were was born into a role that biology dictated, those roles were mirrored in the pack. Simplified, alphas led, betas followed and omegas… well omegas were special. They were to be protected and cherished. An alpha that won the affection of an omega was very lucky indeed.
“Of course,” Dr. Cass smiled at the alpha.
“Of course,” John smiled at the omega.
“Sherlock, whether or not you want to accept it, you will be bringing a life into this world in less than seven months.” Mycroft looked concerned for the first time. “You are going to have to plan ahead for once in your life.”
“It’s Mike! Mike Stamford,” the man came to a halt in front of John, huffing slightly from exertion. “I know I got fat!”
“I want to be there for our cub,” John ground out. “Apart of his life.”
“Sentimental sap,” Sherlock mocked softly, his fingers running through John’s sandy hair. John was drifting off to sleep when he heard a whispered, “love you too.”
“Fine,” Sherlock sighed dramatically. “I guess I could eat again.”
Mike, it’s good to see you.”
John wasn't sure if she was aware of what was happening around the cottage. Rosie was not scared or nervous acting in the house. Unlike John himself. She never crawled into bed with him at night, unless she was sick. He could remember crawling into his parent's bed in the middle of night for a plethora of reasons. Monsters under the bed, stairs creaking ominously or just wanting cuddles. John bent over and kissed Rosie's head affectionately. She leaned into him for a side snuggle, without removing her hands or concentration from the pastry.
John was thankful he did not have a lot of crap to move, one rather heavy box, a duffle of clothes, his computer and his gun. All in all, it was the easiest move he had ever participated in. He was in the process of hailing a cab, difficult to do when carrying all of one’s possessions, when he was shoved bodily into a car.
Pregnancy suited Sherlock.
Mycroft watched his brother’s mate pace the waiting room. Anxious as all expecting fathers were. He found himself both amused and touched. He did not spend his time idly; after all he had lives to arrange. When Sherlock and his little family arrived home at 221 B. Baker Street, it would be to a proper nursery.
“Anderson is useless. Get me John,” Sherlock demanded, before proceeding to tune the betas out.
Sherlock had never helped put a child to bed, so it was weird and sweet. As a single man with little to no interest in children, it was odd to find that he genuinely liked Rosie. She was much more interesting than many of the adults Sherlock dealt with on a daily basis. He had looked around her room, as John got her into bed. She had books and a few dolls, and an amazing amount of art on her walls. Colorful crayon and stick figures that represented John and Rosie, and often a third person that Sherlock assumed was Joey.  It was a blue squiggle, small and at times almost invisible. Newer pictures had a bluish gray dog added that must represent Dodger.
Gregory Lestrade stood in the door, watching Sherlock warily before speaking, “Sherlock are we recording today or what?”
“Whatever we decide it will be fine,” John smiled carefully. “It doesn’t have to be figured out now.”
“None of my previous flat mates were ever pregnant with my pup,” John quipped, his eyes still devouring the skin Sherlock was covering up.
John stood up from his position on the floor. Sherlock did not generally care about what people thought of his looks. However, it had become more of a sensitive subject as his due date rapidly approached. Young kids staring at his stomach put Sherlock off his food. Donovan and Anderson’s underhanded whispers could make him brood for days. One snarky comment from Mycroft however… John winced. The flat was about to go apocalyptic.
John lifted his hands away from Sherlock, stepping away from the omega. He knew, intellectually, that if he claimed Sherlock now, it would only cause discord and distrust.
“Esme if it is a girl, Abram for a boy,” Sherlock offered.
“My name is Sherlock,” the man knelt in front of John's daughter, looking her in the eye. He didn't baby talk at her, which John appreciated greatly.
Esme just hoped it didn’t mess with pack night. Papa would still let her run, hopefully. It was so boring to stay home with Grandma Hudson on the full moon. There was nothing quite as exciting as running through the woods, leaves and branches under her paws. She loved it the most. Well, after her papa and daddy anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
Martha Hudson had been baffled at first at the strange goings on, and then progressively more scared. When she had been shoved down the stairs by an invisible force after cleaning the empty flat upstairs, she had finally gotten mad. She was not going to be run out of her home by some bully. She refused to put up with it from an abusive husband and she would be damned if some other sort of diabolical bullshit was going to drive her insane.
“I don’t want to move,” Sherlock threw out suddenly. “I like living in London, I like 221 B. Baker Street.”
Now, John couldn't help but wonder if that downward spiral had been all Mary. Or if the house had something to do with it.
“Think it through next time John. We could have split the money. We do have a small cub on the way, and those, I’ve heard, are expensive.”
“Sherlock!” Three voices shouted at once.
All of three of them sat in silence for a moment, letting that settle. The giggling that had been in the dining room had moved closer to the living room doorway. Sherlock could hear a what sounded like three children making a ruckus. A glass shattered in the kitchen, and the giggling stopped abruptly.
Sherlock hissed in frustration and twisted his hand trying to find an angle that would allow him some satisfaction. Every time his wrist bumped against his belly. He thumped his head against the sofa, before lifting his hand from his hot, swollen prick. This was bloody intolerable.
“Never you mind.” Holmes pulled his revolver out of his pocket and set it on the desk between them. “Worry about what you tell me now.”
Mycroft hummed.
“I will do nothing of the sort.” Holmes could not look away from the tears still caught in Watson’s lashes.
Holmes was clinging to his side like a barnacle. Watson waited for the feel of phantom hands, waited for his own screams to start echoing in his ears...and then waited some more. He could feel Holmes's rough cheek on his skin, could hear the detective's soft snore, but the wave of agonizing sensations did not wash over him.  He was not fool enough to think himself forever beyond the grip of those terrors, but for now at least, his memories remained in the past. He was anchored to this time, to this bed in this room and this man.
“He did. I didn’t take it,” John assured the omega.
John walked into the warehouse warily. A man stood backlit in the distance, leaning on what looked to be an umbrella.
Sherlock looked at him with heavy eyes, his lush mouth poised to ask questions or give deductions. Always ready to strip John down to his bare bones with his observations. Always spot on, yet missing some key point.
John had stood there, Rosie snuggled into his coat for warmth, her cold face pressed into throat as she keened tunelessly. He hadn't been sure what to say, to think. He was a god damn doctor, he should have seen the effects of postpartum depression. He was a fucking soldier, he should have seen the effects of PTSD. He had no excuse.
“Also known as Sherlock’s long suffering older brother,” Mycroft could barely spare a glance at the doctor. “You can’t even begin to imagine the holidays.”
John walked back to where the car had been, only to find his box of belongings, his duffle and his computer bag on the pitted asphalt. He cursed under his breath as he hefted up his stuff and trudged to main road. Hopefully, he would be able to find a taxi. Especially since John had no idea where he even was.
Only to be confronted with one of the most aggressively beautiful men he had ever seen. Cheekbones sharp enough to cut, steely eyes that seemed to see and dissect everything. John froze in confusion, feeling a little like a deer caught in the glare of high beams. Then the man smiled and his face transformed into something poetically angelic.
“Of course not. How boring,” Sherlock turned his nose up at the question. “I have more important things to do. Like catching criminals.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock muttered, before struggling to stand up. “We should head back. I can’t believe we left Mycroft unattended, he probably has the whole flat bugged now.”
John hid his triumphant grin, as he helped the omega with his Belstaff coat. He had a feeling that winning an argument with Sherlock was going to be rare. He followed the consulting detective out of 221 Baker Street, two steps behind his swirling coat and addictive personality.
John stroked Sherlock’s protecting hand, not wanting to interfere, just to be part of the bonding. He rested his head against Sherlock’s leg and simply existed next to his family.
And the bell chime rang, announcing the arrival of food.
The blind veteran sat at the table, his scarred fingers tapping the edges as he sipped his tea. “What you want to know about?” Luther asked.
“I like him. He likes us, and Joey thinks he's pretty.” Rosie stated, matter of fact. “You should marry him.”
“Maybe you need to surround yourself with better people,” John muttered, angry on Sherlock's behalf.
“That is one of the perks of being an alpha mate,” Dr. Cass grinned wickedly. “Not to mention the sex.”
John walked into the flat and went straight into the kitchen. After a long day at the surgery, dealing with aches, pains and the common cold, all he wanted was a cup of tea. Even if that cup of tea was decaf. He could hear Sherlock playing the most discordant notes on his violin. The noise sounded like a cat in heat, being strangled. It had been another bad day then.
Pregnancy was bloody insufferable. The naps alone were enough to make Sherlock want to pull out John’s gun and shoot holes in all the walls.
“Here-here or here-in-town?” Rosie asked her thumb heading for the corner of her mouth. John hadn't seen her suck her thumb in months.
“No need. I fingered myself in the shower,” the omega mumbled. “I’ve been thinking about you all day.”
Just read.
I should've guessed.
“This is nice,” said John after a while, turning momentarily to his companion. The image of Sherlock – the drama of his billowing coat and his scarf streaming behind him like a banner, juxtaposed with that ridiculous bike helmet – filled him with a great warm flood of fondness. The detective glanced at him and a corner of his mouth twitched into a half-smile.
It was an accident.
John continued to stare.
"It's fine, I'll pay," I said, producing a thin wad of Euro notes and quickly handing them over to the gondolier.
or something at work. Devine intervention, like. Y'know? And God, it's a bloody good job I didn't, because you know what? Not an hour later, after I'd put that damned gun down and told myself I had to keep fighting, Stamford rang."
"You've got to admit," I said, "it's relaxing."
"No need," he said dismissively.
"The mortuary," replied the detective, flatly. "Love is a chemical defect found only in the losing side."
He rolled his eyes. "I was thinking, what... are we? What is this? This... between us?"
How could I prepare for life without Sherlock Holmes, when Sherlock Holmes was my life?
, for God’s sake! Why won’t it just disappear?! Please! I don’t…! I can’t…!
He nodded once for me to continue. I took a deep breath.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes a fraction, not convinced.
"As have you, for me!" he said.
Sherlock's eyelashes fluttered as he looked down to the floor bashfully. "I was about to say the same about you. You ought to wear blue suits more often… brings out your eyes."
resulted in a horrible sinking feeling in John’s insides.
He and I had ended up, of all places, on a cruise liner heading towards Venice.
Sherlock huffed and flopped back onto the cabin bed, dark curls spread out over the pillow. "Fine," he conceded, to my surprise. "Just one day. Then I'll call Mycroft and have us taken straight back to London, by which time we will be able to see first-hand just how badly Scotland Yard fares without our assistance."
He rolled his eyes, sliding the phone from his breast pocket and handing it to me. He watched as I unlocked it (he changed the code every day but taught me the algorithm so I could work it out) and read aloud the message, which was indeed from Mycroft.
The list continued. Paragraph after paragraph of things we’ve done together, things we’ve been through. Not all big things: some small things, things I’d filed away for safekeeping in my Mind Palace, things I thought John would’ve forgotten, but no.
“Isn’t,” he said, petulantly.
"I always enjoy our work. This is just time-wasting."
For maybe half an hour they pedalled, appreciating the scenery, and each other’s company, and speaking very little. It was on a flat stretch of path, wide enough for them to ride next to each other again, that it happened.
It was red, not white, and – writing! All over it, writing! John’s handwriting, black ink, written with the nice pen that came with that notebook I bought him for Christmas, years ago. He uses it a lot. Refilled it three times already. The notebook too, but I ensured it had a lot of pages so it would last. I’m glad he likes them.
Perfect? Me, perfect? John thinks I’m…
Sherlock gave a wry smile. “Needless to say, that was not something Mycroft would have done with me.”
Still: serviette, written all over by John Watson. First thought: shopping list. But no, it’s in sentences, no one writes a shopping list in sentences, and no one writes a shopping list on an item of sentimental value, do they? A memo, then, perhaps it was something significant. Lots of writing for a memo. Not a memo? Something else. I unfolded it. Had to open it up completely to see it all; it spanned the serviette in its entirety.
"Sally Donovan?!" he exclaimed, incredulous. "You
The omega looked over his slender shoulder, as though daring John on.
John put his arm around Rosie's shoulders and steered her away from the tree. He left her and Dodger with Luther and headed back outside with the shovel. It did took them ages. The ground was hard and frozen, but with two determined men they made the effort. They built a fire pit close to the ground, and between digging sessions warmed the earth with coals.
“That does not answer my question,” John growled. “Why did you kidnap me and what do you want?”
“It's very likely,” Sherlock leaned against the counter, slouching comfortably. “Children are well in tune with the spiritual realm. Blah blah blah. Personally, I think it's because imagination has not been drilled out of them yet.”
“Brother, when are you going to face the fact that you are pregnant?”
It had taken John about three months to find a care taker for Rosie, and it had not been the one anyone had expected. There had been an lady on the outskirts of town who had a gaggle of children attached to her on an hourly basis. She had seemed like a nice enough lady, but John didn't like the situation. He had balked about Rosie being there. Then he had met Luther Bell at the local pub one night. His administrative assistant, Sara had taken Rosie for the night, and told John to scat. The woman was scary enough that he had obeyed without a word. Luther Bell had been nursing a solitary pint by himself, staring into nothingness. He had seemed as much of an outsider as John, and it had had nothing to do with his dark ebony skin. There had been a knowingness in his eyes that seemed to scare people away.
“Anything else you two feel you must discuss before we can go?” Mycroft asked dangerously. “Perhaps your views and stances on marriage?”
John was so screwed.
Instinctively, John knew that Sherlock would not want him touching him in this moment. The omega would not stand for him scent marking him or touching their shared bump. The precious bump that was the accumulation of both of them.
“I'm sorry what?” Sherlock asked, confused.
In some cases, like that of this pack of betas, there was no alpha to lead them. The were population had exploded in the 1980s, when they had finally come out of the woods and into the 21
John shook his head, amused “a bit not good.”
Then it changed. Sherlock had begun to touch him back. Small touches. His fingers would touch John’s over a cup of tea, lingering just a moment too long. He would lean into John’s body while watching the telly. It was encouraging.
“Tea boys, decaf of course,” Mrs. Hudson sang out. “Oh babies in the house again. How wonderful, Mrs. Turner is going to be so jealous.”
“Yes, but the baby is well developed, so I don’t want you to worry,” Dr. Cass patted him on his hip. “Enjoy the pampering while you can.”
“That you are,” the alpha grinned. “Are you sure this is what you want?”
Slightly rough, yet fully competent hands rubbed his neck and cooled his forehead. Sherlock leaned back against the firm, compact body behind him.
“Nothing quite that interesting,” Sherlock answered. “I do have a landlady and a podcast producer. Lestrade is sort of like a puppy I guess. He is barely house trained though.”
Sherlock and John followed at a more sedate pace. Both men lost in their own thoughts.
Sherlock’s startling grey eyes met John’s in the mirror, as he pulled his dressing gown around his constantly changing body.
John muffled his laughter in Sherlock’s skin.
The only problem was, that teacher really did not like children all that much. They were noisy and dirty. They rarely listened and they would not sit still. She would beat the seat out of kid's pants with a stitch if they sassed her. The kids were terrified of her.
John enjoyed watching Sherlock work his magic. Except for the fine tremors that wracked his hands and the tight lines around his eyes that belied his nerves. John knew that he was the only one who noticed. Then again, he had made observing Sherlock his sole hobby since their first meeting. The one thing John had learned in the past several months, Sherlock did not like having his condition shoved in his face.
“Oh no, I really am an asshole.” Sherlock laughed. “And I have a few people who matter. Mrs Hudson and Lestrade mostly.”
“Of course, it's the least we can do.” John smiled. “You came to help after all.”
“Is there a difference in the stories?” Sherlock asked, still kneeling.
“How are they?” John demanded.
“Isabelle,” John suggested as he tried to fit together the complicated pieces of a bassinet together.
Sherlock dressed as quickly as he could, once his appointment was over. He never liked the feel of a hospital’s sterile air on his skin. He slowly made his way outside, to find a cab. It was a quiet trip home.
Sherlock did not go limp, as any other wolf would have done under an alpha. Rather those intriguing eyes bore into John’s, confusing the wolf’s senses. With a reluctant growl John stood, Sherlock prone under his legs. John howled urging the pack on to the hunt.
“Do you have a shovel,” Sherlock asked quietly.
“Oh yes,” Rosie nodded vigorously. “Joey tells me stories that I never hear about in school or in town.”
John blushed. “Oh shut up and go get one too. It's story time.” He followed the man out of the kitchen and into the festively decorated living room. It seemed his daughter was going to tell them a possibly true holiday horror story.
Which of course led to the formation of the
“Because you three are too blind to see what is laid out in front of you,” Sherlock snarked testily. “A blind four year old could solve this case before you even had a clue.”
John was rather worried with the pasty sheen gleaming from Sherlock’s already pale skin. He had seen first hand the havoc morning sickness could wreck, but Sherlock seemed to be suffering from a rather severe bout of it. His already lanky frame was not holding up under the constant barrage of nausea. John rubbed a soothing hand over Sherlock’s lower back. It felt as though the man had already dropped at least a stone’s weight.
Sherlock's dark curls bounced as he tilted his head in inquiry.
Damn bibimbap.
If Sherlock had been in his wolf form, his ears would have been pinned to the sides of his head, baring his fangs in aggression.
“That sounds like Sherlock,” John laughed tiredly. “Can I see them now?”
Mike was the type of friend to listen and not judge. Or if he did judge, he didn't do it out loud. John appreciated him more than ever. He was also the bloke who had turned him onto Sherlock Holmes, Ghost Debunker extraordinaire. After the night of the tea debacle, John had gone into research mode. Like he hadn't done since medical school. Books and websites about ghost and hauntings. And a scary as fuck foray into demons and demonic possession. He had been on a research spiral of doom. Wikipedia was only the tip of the iceberg.
“Mycroft is going to be insufferable,” Sherlock sighed loudly.
John swiftly followed after the pack, until he was in the lead. He could feel the restrained power behind him. And it made him giddy with excitement. He could feel the pack spreading out, as they pinned the stag down. Trapped, and white eyed with a primal fear.
Mrs Hudson hummed noncommittally, used to Sherlock's snits. She climbed the stairs wondering if she should decorate for the upcoming holidays. It was always lovely having a bit of festive color and greenery. She had to resist flicking through the mail in her hands. All of them held such interesting stories, and she adored when Sherlock told them and solved them.
Once he was nude, John knelt next to Sherlock, his fingers ghosting over the thin skin of his clavicle. John would not normally describe the omega as delicate. But his skin was delicate, translucent with blue veins close to the surface. It was a part of pregnancy, but never before had John found it so appealing.
Sherlock sat in a wing back chair as he watched John Watson bustle around, lighting the fireplace and doling out tea and hot chocolate. This man was nothing like Sherlock had dealt with before in his cases. There was giggling coming from the dining room. Sherlock could see John notice it, acknowledge it and then move on. There were no hysterics, just gentle acceptance. Sherlock had left a small recording device in that room, wondering if he would capture anything of interest. The giggling of ghost children was creepy, but in the long run it was not informative.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the car pulled to a stop at an abandoned warehouse on the wharf.
“That is so reassuring,” John murmured. “Now, how about a tour of the labs, I am sure it has changed since our school days.”
“Do not speak to my mate again, unless you can muzzle that temper of yours,” John hissed softly, for Sally’s ears alone. “Or else you will be facing the consequences of pack justice.”
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to picture Mumbles in 1978. Smaller, much more isolated. In 1978 an hour and a half from Cardiff, it would have been the sticks. They would not have been able to blame the crimes on the encroaching city, or the growing tourism industry. Tourism had been in decline in 1978. The train to Mumbles had closed years before. If they were crimes. Thirteen children went missing over the span of fifteen months. No bodies were ever found. No real evidence of a crime ever discovered. To the cops it looked like thirteen children decided to wake up in the middle of the night, pack a rucksack and leave. Never to be seen again. Their ages were consistent, though their gender was not. Five boys and eight girls between the ages of eleven and thirteen just gone.
“Of course I do,” John growled. “Can we please focus on one life changing event at a bloody time?”
John just wanted to touch Sherlock, without feeling like he was stealing something.
John had followed his gaze, and laughed softly. “I had better get them to bed.” He stood, and leaned backwards-groaning softly when his back popped. “She's getting too big for me to do this for much longer,” he whispered to Sherlock. “So I try to do it as much as I can now.”
“Really Sherlock?” The man John assumed was Mycroft murmured. “Grow up.”
Jimmy M. totally deserved the playground beating. He had been calling her daddy and papa names, and it was not to be tolerated. She didn’t understand all the words, but she knew they weren’t nice. Esme was pretty sure Jimmy didn’t know what they meant either, but that was not the point. Nobody got away with mucking about with her family.
“This is all your fault,” Sherlock growled. “If you would have just kept your knot to yourself, I would not currently be playing incubator to your devil spawn.”
“Shut up John,” Sherlock groaned. “It is too soon.”
“For fuck's sake,” John muttered as he shook his hand out. He grabbed the knob again and yanked it forcefully, almost falling down as it opened easily under his hand.
Sherlock did not get nervous about meeting prospective clients. In fact, the only thing he ever got nervous about was boredom. The very idea of ennui was enough to send him into a tailspin of agitation. And Sherlock knew he would not be bored with this case, if the simple action of ringing a doorbell could cause such phenomenon. While he did not have any equipment on his person, he could feel the temperature drop. He could see how the man behind the door was struggling to get it to open. He did not bounce on his toes in excitement.
John did not bother asking his flat mate if he wanted a cup of tea. Rather he simply made him one, doctored up with a splash of milk and a bit of sugar. The doctor juggled the two cups, and walked into the living room.
The alpha bit back a growl as he took in his surroundings. It was one of those fancy luxury cars that John had never had the pleasure of riding in. A beautiful beta sat in the seat across from him, typing away on her Blackberry.
John knew a con when he heard one, but Rosie just looked sweet and innocent. “Yeah alright, but only one.”
John smiled carefully at the irate man, as he whirled around to face him.
John leaned his head against the wall, as he listened to Sherlock scream and rage at the doctor who had been elected to give the consulting detective the good news. Something heavy was heaved at the door, crashing to the floor. John debated entering the exam room, before deciding that discretion was really the better part of valor.
John snorted into his water, his eyes watering from trying not to laugh. His daughter was coming out of her shell fast around Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock pushed past John, getting into Sally’s face. “What’s wrong Sally, sick of getting on your knees for married men?” He sneered disdainfully.
The force of the rage suggested that yes, they really were. Sherlock did not know why or how, but that anger was building.
John was still laughing when Rosie skidded back into the kitchen, Dodger right behind her. “Daddy can Dodger have a meat pasty too?”
“Do shut up, Mycroft,” Sherlock loomed over John, plucking his cup of tea from the alpha’s hand.
Maybe John would know somebody willing to talk to him. Sherlock really wanted to go back downstairs and sleep on the sofa with John. This cottage had suddenly become more sinister in the past few minutes. Sleeping alone in this room was terrifying. He knew he was a prideful man, but not that proud. He grabbed his pillow and a throw blanket, heading back to John and the safety of the Christmas tree.
After a lifetime of waiting and pacing, Sherlock’s harried looking doctor entered the waiting room. John was in her space within seconds.
His inky black curls were soaked with sweat, forcing him to push them out of his eyes. Sherlock had spent more time on the floor in the loo this past month, heaving his intestines out, than ever before in his life. In reality, he knew that it was statistically unlikely that one could actually puke up one’s intestines. But as he weakly flushed the toilet, it seemed the only possible explanation.
John snorted. “Well yeah, I mean local stories about a half demon half goat taking misbehaving children away, being published in the papers is outrageous. Even for Wales.”
John pushed himself to finish another lap in the cold, competition style swimming pool. The cold water was not ideal for his shoulder, and the old war wound that still acted up on occasion ached liked a bitch. However the days of warm pools and hot saunas were over. Those were fancy gyms in London. Not the YMCA, a good hour drive from his new/old home in bumfuck Wales. Okay to be fair, The Mumbles was not bumfuck. It was a lovely little township that was actually pretty bustling. Cosmopolitan even, in the right light. It was just that John had loved London, and in comparison every other place seemed to dim.
Which made his life pretty fucking funny.
“Okay love, give me a minute to clean it up.” John grabbed the dust bin and broom. “Keep Dodger out of here, so he doesn't cut his paws up.”
Lestrade arrived at the hospital without Anderson and Donovan. While pack allegiance was still a bit shaky, after nine months of seeing John lead, Lestrade couldn’t help but pledge his loyalty to the alpha. And Sherlock, while a right bastard; was one of Lestrade’s favorite people. He couldn’t help admire somebody who told it like it was, and shoved all social decorum. Sherlock was refreshing.
Mrs Hudson continued to bustle around the flat, preparing tea and eyeing the stack of mail. She really hoped Sherlock would find something interesting in that pile. She couldn't handle another day of his moping. Plus he might read some of them out loud.
The “doctor on the brain – geddit?!” line is one that Anarion, Atlin Merrick, Mirith Griffin and I each agreed to crowbar into a story by any means possible after we met up in London.
“Thank you, Doctor Anderson.” His voice was soft, almost inaudible, but Anderson picked up the words and nodded once more, then smiled slightly.
He tromped down the stairs and past Mrs Hudson's flat, before Sherlock enraged reply could come. It was rare that he landed a zinger on the cagey demon detective debunker.
Sherlock simply smirked, as he pulled the door open. “See you for tea, Mrs. Hudson.”
John could only watch in stunned silence as Mycroft gathered his coat and umbrella and left the flat. He wasn’t sure what had just happened, but he could tell Sherlock was worn out and just plain angry.
“Mate, just listen to one episode.” Mike had soothed, in that annoying way.
“So I met your arch nemesis today,” John stated the moment he was in the flat. “He’s a bit of dick.”
“I know you have read up on how the rest of your pregnancy goes,” Dr. Cass changed the subject abruptly. “But I will say this, everybody’s last two months are different.”
“You are the man who tells the stories Daddy listens to after I go to bed,” Rosie informed him softly, her arms still wrapped around John's thigh. “Are you here to tell Daddy stories?”
“Shut up John,” Sherlock snapped. “I want a moment of peace, if that is okay with you and my brother.”
“Is that so?” John laughed again, his hands going to Sherlock’s hips.
“Then I am sure the bump will verbally eviscerate the little twerps, just like his daddy does.” John held onto his elbow and tried to take the majority of his mate’s weight.
John nodded. “I never really believed in the supernatural. I mean you don't go through war without ghosts and miracles and all that.” John put his cup down. “But that's a different sort of belief I think.”
