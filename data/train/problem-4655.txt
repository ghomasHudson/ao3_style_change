So they pile in the Impala while Sam gives their usual “hunters fighting monsters” speech. Castiel takes it fairly well. Or, at least, doesn’t start screaming or anything. He seems to have recovered from the attack fairly quickly too. Dean, on the other hand, feels weird with him in the backseat. Seeing him in the rear view mirror makes him nervous and smiley at the same time. Sam must sense that his unusual quietness means that something’s not right with him because he keeps sneaking glances his way.
On one of those mornings, Dean wakes up while he is still out, and Cas’ phone rings in his pocket as he walks. On the other end Dean gruffly says,
“Precisely. That is what makes us able to go on for centuries. Sorrow, loneliness, regret, you cannot carry those with you for eternity.”
When Dean speaks again his voice is definitely softer. “You are an idiot, but alright. Yeah, we just got here,” the frown disappears and his voice goes quieter still, “Okay. Yeah, I’ll see you at home.” his eyes flicker to Sam and he clears his throat so when he speaks again his tone is back to normal. “Remind me to kick your ass for making me worry.”
Then Cas came around that evening while they were having dinner. They heard his heavy footsteps before he entered the kitchen. His hair was a little messy and his skin looked pale and worn out. He always seemed exhausted these days. Dean had stolen a glance and thought that a little break could be good for him, but that Cas would have thought that they were out of their mind for planning a vacation. It dawned on him that he was probably going to say no and that that would hurt him a little to hear. He wanted Cas to want to go with them.
“And how would you like me to register you, as Mr. Houdini or as Mr. Plant?” he says. He doesn’t look even a little bit amused.
. He likes the way she lights up at that and how - later, when he tells him - Dean snorts and brags about his charm.
Sam almost jumped out of his chair. “Did I just? Did I just hear that? Did you just say that?” he laughed.
“Well, as I said, I’m not here to endanger anybody,” he says, rolling his eyes. "Alright, look, I can answer some more question if it’ll make you feel better.”
They can stop along the way, like they sometimes do. He will get a hot bagel and Cas will down half his coffee, and they will stand right outside the store, where they can’t get wet but they can breathe and hear the rain. And Cas will say – well, Dean can never anticipate what Cas is going to say, but that’s the good part.
He catches his eyes once again and he feels unable to move and unable to say anything and he suddenly feels like the heating is set on a little too high for him, still in his jacket.
Sometimes before going back to the bunker he visits the pizza place, where Max’s mum, Caitlin, works. He opens up Sam’s latest text message and lists off their order. During the weekend, a table far back in a corner is usually crowded with young familiar faces. He stands at the entrance waiting for his order to be ready, looking down at the checkered floor and twisting the receipt in his hands and he feels their eyes on him.
So Castiel goes from bag to bag for items that need to be refrigerated looking like a bee flying from flower to flower.
Sam blinks a few times as if it’s taking some time for him to register what he’s heard. “What? But it’s late. You just drove seven hours straight. Aren’t you tired?”
Cas hesitated, “I better tag along if that’s alright with you. I’m trying to cut back from using my powers if it’s not necessary.”
Crunch. It’s different” he says affronted, as seriously as if they were talking about matters of life and death.
The sun has already set and the temperatures have dropped significantly again. Dean is not in a great mood. He can’t wait to finish this job and get out of there and forget all about this town and this cold and those stupid vetalas.
Then she sits at the table and watches as Dean appears on the door, his eyes sleepy, his hair messy, the belt of his robe loosely tied. He waves lazily in her direction then goes straight towards Castiel, holding out a hand to grab the mug that he was already offering him. No words between them, just soft smiles, as if it’s a thing they do every day. She has not been around the Winchesters that much but she is fairly sure she’s never seen a more content expression on Dean’s face.
Dean had just gotten to his last mouthful when Cas pushed his half-finished plate towards him. He did not complain and dove right in again.
The brothers never had many chances to swim so they just stayed near the shore, enjoying the cool of the water and the sensation of their bodies floating, while Cas seem to be taking the sea as his personal Olympic pool. Dean watched him getting further and further away and only really relaxed when he saw him turning around. When he made his way back to them he had short breath. Dean surveyed his sea drops covered face and found him well enough.
Castiel huffs a laugh. “I have seen nothing then,” he promises as he goes back to the last items on the table.
Sam’s nod is weak and his pale face is not at all reassuring, but Dean knows it will do no good to stay in the car. He needs to get him inside.
Steve doesn’t press further but says, “He is your little brother, right?” Dean frowns a little and Steve adds, gentle: “You seemed very caring.”
Sam dismisses every moment, finds every excuse for them. They’ve always been like that. Can’t two friends do it? Does it have to mean something? It’s just the way they are.
Sam heard something in his voice and stopped in his track towards the bedroom “Dean. We couldn’t have reached them in time even if we were in Kansas.”
He picks it up pretty easily and soon enough a rhythm has settled between them. Their hands don’t reach for the same piece of laundry anymore and Cas interrupts himself and loses his thread of thought more than once as he focuses on his task. Then he moves to fetch another basket, takes the kitchen rags pile away from the bathroom towels and keeps going.
But then the group of hunters out in the patio erupts in laughter and Cas’ gaze shifts on them and then lingers on the glass door.
Dean bit back a “Must be nice”, he bit back a “How can you choose to be here instead?”, “How can you think staying here is worth all that?”.
He dared looking up at what he could see of his face but Cas was staring ahead, partially lightened by the crappy tv. Dean closed his eyes, then he reached out and laid his left hand on his, palm against palm.
He rounds the counter and opens the box, angling it toward Castiel so that he can grab a napkin and a donut. Dean almost shouts “Ha!” as he discovers his predictions were correct. Those donuts look as delicious as they smell, and he can’t take his eyes off of them. He catches Castiel giving Gabriel an insistent look that prompts him to say, with a sight: “And does the gentlemen here have breakfast included, by any chance?”
Sam shouts “Hey!” to catch their attention and as one of them turns around he shoots her in the chest. It does nothing to her except pissing her off, but Sam gets what he wanted, she hisses and lets go of the man to go after him.
Cas presses his lips together. “I thought it was best to let you decide where you wanted to go and who you wanted to see.”
. All this time he thought that the best thing that could happen was to know that Cas loved him, but the way Dean feels now, seeing his eyes shining as he hears his words, yeah, nothing can beat that. He decides then, that he’ll tell him everything that Cas always deserved to hear and he’ll make sure he never forgets it. It may not make up for the time he spent doubting, but for sure he’ll try. Cas grabs his hand, “I feel the same way.”
Castiel feels his eyes on him. “I’ve washed a car before, you know.” He says, and there’s a playful tone hidden underneath his low voice.
His own hands grip the back of the trenchcoat, and when he moves his head a little so that his lips brush against Cas’ neck he says “Dean” in a breath. It makes him smile.
would’ve stopped Jack from trying? He’s your son, after all,” he says and Dean is filled with pride and affection. “But when he got there, turns out, Cas was fighting from the inside.” Dean huffs a laugh and Bobby follows suit. “They broke everyone free, sent the Empty back to sleep. They’re all at peace now.”
. So Castiel had walked out of there and into the kitchen, from where he could still hear them and keep an eye on them like he’d been instructed for the night.
“Hey,” Dean shifts on his chair, now frowning. His tone has changed as well, it’s sharper, “what do you want?”
But they are here now. Dean stops the car and shakes him awake one more time; he touches his face, tries to meet his eyes.
Steve nods, catching the drift. He says “I’ll be in the office,” and slips out of the room, clicking the door shut behind his back.
Dean goes over to him and stops right behind his back to look over his shoulder. Maybe he takes a step or two more than it is necessary because when Cas turns his face on the side to catch his eyes he find himself a little too close “Perhaps is best if we hide this from Sam as well,” he suggests conspiratorially and his breath brushes over Dean’s cheek.
So when they get to the bunker, Dean doesn’t follow Claire’s car to the garage and stops up front, the engine running. Sam looks at him confused, “We’ll be here in an hour,” Dean just says, grateful for the shadows around his face.
Pressed against his shoulder, Dean sees her face change expression, her body slightly relax in his arms. She pats him on the back and says: “Good to see you too, Cas.”
Castiel looks upwards in a matter than suggests annoyance, but he is pressing his lips together as if he’s keeping a smile at bay.
Dean left an unbothered Sam snoring away and went stumbling into the dimly lit kitchen to close the windows. He turned and saw the bundle of sheets that moved rhythmically with Cas’ breath. He stood there for a few minutes before shaking himself and going back to bed.
Eileen looks his way in time to see him put his arm around Castiel’s shoulders and pull him close. His lips read: “What? It was adorable. Wanna win it for me later?”
Steve nods and doesn’t offer anything else. “So,” Dean shrugs in the awkward silence, “just thought I’d come say ‘sorry’ about earlier. I’m not usually such a jerk. You really saved my ass though, so, thanks.”
It looks like he is used to it and knows that staying away from their arguments is the safest strategy to survive with the Winchesters. She taps him on his shoulder. “What do you think?” she signs, interrupting Dean and Sam who are still going at it.
Dean likes her. She spent half her life working at a bank, but after crossing path with a djinn she hanged her suit, moved out of the city and created a safe place for hunters, soon becoming a beacon in the community in Kansas. Her door is always open, as she said that one time they met her on a case. Dean likes her for no-nonsense ways, her honest looks and, not less importantly, her amazing sandwiches.
things that he wants. He wants to know, to understand. He wants to step closer, to touch. He thinks of Anna’s hand on his. The little seedlings grow an inch taller and the scorched earth inside of him smells of rain and fertile soil.
Then the dryer at his right beeps and Dean moves to take out the new load and drop it where the first one just disappeared. Castiel looks at it with a frown like it personally offended him.
Dean shook his head. “You just gotta find something that works for you, trust me. It’s not the same for everybody.”
Dean blinked at him unimpressed but moved his legs to give him more room that he promptly took possession of scooting back on his ass. Cas went back to watching the water and Dean was almost dozing off with the sun on his skin, his hands in the warm sand and Cas’ light weight on his knee.
Cas smiles ruefully and his tone drips sarcasm when he says “In the laundry room and the kitchen. Does
” he says wiggling his eyebrows in a way that has his brother close his eyes in embarrassment, “you’re always welcome.”
“Yeah, well, then let me stick around awhile. As a ghost or something,” he looks back once again at Sam, carrying his body out of the barn, “After everything I did. I'm just asking for this,” he begs. “It won’t be long. Just- just give me a day.”
She groans as if she’s heard that same speech about a thousand times, but Cas cuts off whatever she was going to retort with and says, “We weren’t planning on coming either. Sam and Jack are here too.”
It’s curious – he uses only three fingers as he types, one index of his left hand and the index and middle finger of his right hand. Dean had been about to bring it up to Sam one time, but then he thought of all the things Cas knew about him and never mentioned and decided to keep this one about Cas for himself.
He always passes by the front windows of the post office and when the place is empty and she is not busy, Marta catches his eyes through the blinds and waves at him to come inside. He doesn’t mind spending a few minutes chatting with her. She is kind and nods understandingly and never makes him feel like he’s speaking in tongues. She always asks after Dean at some point, she says
But Steve doesn’t seem in the mood to indulge his curiosity. He ignores his question and stands up to stop right in front of him. Despite the counter between them the guy is suddenly at a distance that Dean would deem a little too close for comfort for a stranger, and from where he finds himself now, he is forced to look up at him a little. But there’s a challenge in the way he confidently entered his personal space and Dean is not going to be the one who backs down.
Sam tries to take a step but his legs give out under him. “I can’t do it.” he says. “It’s too cold.”
Castiel studies his face for a long moment. It’s half turned in what seems to be embarrassment, and that also escapes Castiel’s understanding.
to share that space with him doing such a mundane task. It’s like seeing him under a different light.
“What’s your favourite song?” asked Cas out of nowhere, passing in front of empty summer house after empty summer house.
Sometimes Dean relaxes a little too much and he’s woken up by the sound of the coffee mug Cas puts down next to the book he fell asleep on. His brain register a looming presence and his insticts tell him to jerk away, but before that can happen, there’s Cas’ hand on his shoulder, heavy and familiar.
Sam notices that there’s something different with him, because he keeps calling him back to reality, snapping his fingers and looking at him all weird as they plan what to do with the vetalas.
A little soap in the water, an extra brush for Cas and soon enough they are going after the blood smeared on the roof.
A few hours later the sounds of Cas and Sam in the other room woke him up again. It was still raining.
He had missed half of the movie already and the burgers were lukewarm but it wasn’t bad. Cas laughed a few times and Sam dozed off leaning in on him like he did when he was a kid. It wasn’t bad at all.
“You know what, we shouldn’t ruin it for him now, should we? Troy, you say? Of course I remember him,” he says and throws in a wink. The guy beams at him and thanks him and gets a little chocked up because Troy might have been a liar but he swears he was one of the good ones.
On their last day, the wind didn’t relent but the white clouds running in the sky were a nice sight and at least the sun was warm.
Dean’s gaze darts towards Sam next to him. His brother shifts in his seat but doesn’t offer any lifelines.
“Dean,” he complains then and pushes his arms away, “I’m not a child,” he says. His face is red and his hair wild. Dean counters his annoyed look with a grin, “What?” he says.
He smiles fondly. “You’re a mess.” he says, and the same bold, brave, uncontrolled hand goes to pinch the wet hem of the trenchcoat collar.
“Well, then. Thank you.” He says as the car rolls to a stop in front of a little house. It’s too dark to see it properly but under the snow, the front garden seems a little unkempt and there’s still a string of unlit Christmas lights with one end dangling from the gutter. Dean thinks it’s kinda cute.
Robert turns away quickly and busies himself with the oven and that leaves Dean to fix his gaze on Castiel who keeps staring back, unwavering.
“Sh-she is here already?” Sam almost chokes up and all of the sudden he seems to have grown a few inches taller.
Cas comes standing by his side again and Dean feels a gentle touch on the small of his back. It’s intimate and unexpected so he steps away immediatly almost on instict and Cas’ drops his hand. He meets his gaze and they frown at each other for a second. Cas seems about to say something, but then goes back to sporting his usual face, “I think I saw Claire. I’m going to find her.”
Dean laughs, “You don’t,” he says and although he tries to reign it in with the bitterness, it stills seeps out. Cas’ gaze prompts him to explain himself, “Come on, the minute we’re done with a case you are out of here. I don’t blame you,” he quickly adds cutting off whatever Cas was opening his mouth to say. “I know you don’t like sitting around. Believe me, no one understands that more than I do.”
Steve blinks at him like he’s trying to understand if he is in fact out of his mind as he seems. “What?”
“Hey, Sammy, look at me,” he says and Sam seems to make an effort to focus on him, “we are here. We’re gonna get you inside now, you hear me?” he says. “You just gotta hold on for one more minute. I’m gonna check us in and you’ll be warm in no time.”
“Alright” Sam concedes “I’m gonna grab a shower and get something to eat. I’ll leave you a sandwich in the kitchen, then I’ll head straight to bed.” He yawns again. “I’m exhausted.”
He struggles to shake him off with one hand while with the other he tries to reach for the blade. The creature opens his mouth and he’s about to sink his fangs in his neck when Dean squeezing his eyes and pushing with everything he’s got, gets them to roll once again. The vetala is on his back, the blade now visible next to it. Dean quickly snatches it from the ground and buries it in his heart.
Dean insists Sam takes it easy and stays in for the rest of the morning – he complies, not without putting up a fight - while he drives back to the hiking trail. They fear the vetalas might have attacked again while they’ve been away, but there are no signs of them anywhere.
One time, on the bathroom tiles of a smelly motel, Dean is grinding his teeth, trying not to scream as Sam sews a gash on his leg.
“I don’t?” Steve says, surprised by the question. His gaze is drawn to the freckles all over his face and Dean feels his skin heat up.
He didn’t even change and tagged along still wearing his swimsuit and another one of his old shirts, a lime green one, buttoned up this time at least. The weather had turned a little humid. The short path to the little town had no shadow anywhere.
They laid their towels on the sand and went for a swim. Sam started bitching about how cold the water was so Dean splashed him to shut him up. It worked.
Sam is yawning in the passenger seat and Castiel, who Dean can see form the rear view mirror, seems lost in thought. They decided to skip the stop to the motel and go back to the bunker right after the hunt and although it’s been a long and mostly quiet journey, Dean doesn’t feel tired. He is still fuelled by the adrenaline that has washed over him when he’s found himself way too close for comfort to a set of werewolf’s teeth. It had taken him all he had to shove the werewolf away enough to swing his machete and cut her head off.
Sam shifts his gaze towards the blotches of blood on the windshield and the doors, on the windows and the headlights. They had been surprised by the pack during their stake out when they thought they were well hidden in the woods. That was also the reason why they opted out for an extra night in town. The police would have knocked at their door in the morning for sure if they’d parked that bloodied thing out in the open.
On the nights he gets pizza, he takes the boxes to the pick-up, places them on the passenger seat and drives carefully back to the bunker. He parks, kills the engine, exits, gets to the passenger seat, takes out the pizza boxes and makes his way to the map room. Dean is usually there already, waiting, with an uncorked beer in one hand. He greets him widening his arms and saying
Dean really didn’t have the energy to fire anything back, he just said that he was going to bed and as soon as he laid down, he fell asleep.
“Yeah, I know. You’re letting me take a stray dog home without bitching. Just this morning you would’ve argued with me for an hour about it.”
“Rowena’s really prepared,” he hummed as he pulled out a tube of lube and a condom. “There’s a gun in here, too.”
Cas looked pissed but he knew Dean and that they could both be stubborn if they wanted to be. And that would just waste more time.
The way Cas’ trembled just from the lightest touch on the inside of his wings had been like a revelation to Dean. Also had been getting fucked against nothing, trusting Cas to hold him in thin air. God, his husband was so
“You alright, beloved?” Cas pulled back a bit, voice concerned. When Dean took stock and it felt like every organ and limb was still in place, he nodded mutely. “Then maybe you’d like to open your eyes?”
“I’ve been working with assholes for years, Dean. I learned to get information out of people pretty quickly so I can end conversations as soon as possible. And people can actually be decent once in a while.”
“We can try,” Cas admitted, looking at Dean with concern, then he stood up, holding out his hand. “Come on, then. You should still try to get some rest. I don’t want you to meet my parents while looking like the zombie we've just got rid of.”
The outside of his house probably looked more like a big nice block of emmental cheese, all windows broken, the walls already full of holes. And they weren’t even inside. They kept shooting until there were more holes than wall and they got a big enough entrance (not the actual door, of course) for them to walk in comfortably.
“Déjà vu,” the angel muttered, pulling the knife out and letting it hit the concrete. There was a brief flash of grace and the wound disappeared in an instant, no struggle, no pain.
In the evening, he would bring the Continental home, hiding it under a tarp until Cas arrived from the hospital. She looked pretty much like a new car with the paint job, the carpeting and everything, but Dean had taken care to leave her still recognizable.
“Lift a leg for me,” he murmured between them, voice rough and deep, and Dean complied, his head tipping back on the pillow as he relaxed into the touch of the tip of Cas’ probing finger. It slid in easily, his lashes fluttering and heart hammering in his chest.
“Just don’t do that again,” he cupped Cas’ jaw in one hand. “Charlie and Dorothy are still searching. At least shoot me a text.”
“What the hell?” he whispered, straightening up from his slumping position as he rubbed at his eyes. He hadn’t slept this long in anyone’s presence in a long time. Somehow his subconscious hadn’t rated Cas’ presence as a threat – more than that, it apparently considered it safe. Which, yeah, he was soft for the guy, but that it was enough to silence his instincts was not something he’d expected.
Cas directed a questioning look at Dean as if he expected him to tell his brother every little detail he'd found out about the guy. He just shrugged in response. It wasn’t his secret to tell. The two Alphas’ eyes met again.
Charlie and Dorothy were late by three minutes. They saw Dean in seconds, and they changed course directly there.
“We have to talk,” Victor barreled in beside him, Dean never even having the opportunity to protest. But Victor seemed determined and Dean knew he could get rid of him quicker if he just heard him out.
The smile Cas gave him for that was the same one he’d gotten when he’d let him drive Baby. It made Dean want to do something stupid, like kiss him in the middle of an op.
“I can pray if we need your help, alright? You can be there in a second. I don’t want you to risk yourself if it’s not necessary, okay?”
He hadn’t chosen his house at random. No CCTV anywhere close. Every room had at least two entrances so you could walk around without stepping foot in the same one twice. It was also perfect to get behind someone’s back.
Cas was not a smirker. Dean loved making him smile or laugh, that always felt like the sun coming out after rain – in Kansas, not in California, the weather here was freakily sunny. Case in point, Cas didn’t smirk. If he was being smug or coy or even arrogant, it was mostly in his eyes or at the corner of his lips at best. So this, now, it just didn’t add up.
Dean hoped his face wasn’t telling her anything. He was glad for doing this in the car, Charlie couldn’t look at him for longer than a moment. There was an idea forming in his head that would require a lot less lying.
“It wasn’t like that,” Sam blushed. “I met her in the courthouse’s cafeteria yesterday afternoon. She’s a witness in another case.”
“Let me see,” Cas was in his space in seconds, pulling away the once white shirt and undershirt carefully to look at the wound. Dean could smell the honey-scented shampoo he used. “I think the bullet’s still in. But you’ll live.”
They made love that night. Dean didn’t know another word for what it was. There were soft touches and reverent kisses and the slow, rhythmic thrust of their bodies and Dean lost himself in Cas completely. He felt tears prickling his eyes and he didn’t even care because this, with Cas – it was everything.
“Double murder at the edge of a town not far from here,” Dean summarized out loud as they left the parking lot. “Pretty gruesome. Chests opened and hearts missing. What kind of psycho does that?” He looked up and the frown on Cas’ face was not of judgement or revulsion. No, it was thoughtful. “What’s up?” he put the paper aside.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed. The come on their bellies was already getting sticky and the sweat wasn’t helping. “Problem is, hotshot, everything’s still in the car.”
They arrived to the cars in no time, Cas’ ugly Continental parked neatly beside Baby. There was just one problem.
A couple songs later the door opened and Cas walked in, a smile on his face as his eyes met Dean’s, and the hunter couldn’t help his own grin, his stomach doing actual somersaults.
There was the telltale flutter of wings Dean hadn’t heard in years but was never able to really forget.
They met up with Sam around five near the place they’d found Eileen at. She had been really lucky someone had bumped into her, because there were mostly just blocks of warehouses all around. They hadn’t run into anybody, either.
“You know the layout,” Rowena finished her wine (the third glass) and stood up, sashaying out of the room. “Good night, boys!”
“But they’re so fundamentally different,” Cas murmured. “If he’d done something, he must have had a good reason.”
“You’re a dumbass,” the Omega interrupted him. He was a little uncoordinated but he got a hold of Cas’ hand after a couple seconds. “Of course I want you back. As soon as you can.” He swallowed thickly. “But are you sure you’ll be okay with us puny mortals?”
Cas was sitting on an uncomfortable-looking chair, hands laced together in his lap, eyes trained on the opposite wall. His scent was balanced on the surface, but there were emotions roiling underneath. There was something ozonic in it Dean couldn’t place.
“Dean, what the hell?” he grabbed his older brother’s arm. “Look, I don’t know why you’re so defensive about this, but I really think we should try him. You don’t think he could help?”
Her kid, Ben was cute and sharp and Lisa had made her interest clear from day one. Maybe ten years ago Dean would’ve jumped on the opportunity, but he’d worked for the CIA for close to fifteen years before they’d decided he wasn’t useful anymore. Now he was more paranoid than Skipper from Madagascar. He didn’t do hook-ups – or any kind of socialization, really – anymore. It was too dangerous, left him too exposed. He couldn’t afford a weak point like that, not after what had gone down with Sam.
“I’d like to see Mary,” Cas smiled. “But I’m not sure that’s a good idea right now. Adam’s at their house at the moment.”
It was almost six when Cas arrived in a whirlwind, rainbow-colored wings almost bowling over Grandma Millie’s porcelain. He now only did that when he was excited. His feathers seemed ruffled before they disappeared.
Cas freed his hand and even though his face gave away nothing, his eyes were expressing exactly how susceptible the subject made him feel.
“Jesus, Cas,” he snickered and pulled the man back to him. “Come ‘ere,” he muttered and Cas met him halfway readily. This kiss was longer, deeper, lips moving against each other, toeing the line between passion and leisure. One of Cas’ hands was glued to the nape of his neck, thumb gliding over the skin tenderly, the other sneaking under Dean’s jacket at his back. Dean himself was satisfied with their bodies pressing together, his fists grabbing onto the trench coat at Cas’ hips, the course material a familiar feeling under his fingers. Man, Dean had missed this something fierce. The feeling it invoked in him, the chanting in his mind,
“Okay, we need to walk three miles or so. Dorothy gave me her coordinates,” Charlie said as they got out. She walked over to the trunk and looked around shiftily before opening it.
Bobby looked at him with inquisitive eyes for a long moment, then turned on his heel and went back to his desk. Dean and Cas followed him.
Cas had maybe five hours of sleep in him so he took a trip to the Casey’s on the other side of the road and came back with pizza and coke. While they waited, the brothers took showers and tended to their wounds which were mostly superficial and Sam didn’t seem to have a concussion, either, which was a small miracle, really.
“You just get comfortable,” Rowena told them, then turned to Dean. “Come on, dear, let me see that.”
Dean waited until the unit disappeared inside before easing Baby out of the parking spot and rolling down the street. He only turned on the headlights when they’d reached the first intersection.
“It sounds stupid,” Claire added bluntly. “We don’t know anything about these guys. I don’t know about you, but immortal god-like things are not fond of humans in movies.” She shrugged. “But I’m in if we’re doing it.”
“Shut up,” Dean grumbled as heat crept up his cheeks, and took it from Cas grudgingly. “Aren’t you supposed to be on my side?” he asked his angel.
When he got rid of the wipes, Dean inched closer until he maneuvered them into a comfortable position with Cas’ head on his uninjured shoulder, their legs tangled together under the covers. He hadn’t been that content in a really long time and sleep was pulling at him. He felt Cas’ lips ghosting over his collarbone with a whispered, “Good night, Dean,” before exhaustion finally claimed him.
“We need to talk. Or I need to talk to someone. Cas is right, I have to at least do some talking or I’m just gonna lose my mind. So I need you to listen and let me rant.”
“I knew I needed it, I didn’t know exactly why,” Cas admitted and pulled the shirt back down. “It’s in Enochian. Hides me from them. I cross it over with a marker and I have maybe until morning for them to find me. It should be enough time to set up some protection.”
They burned the bodies. They debated on the house as well, but decided the ground was too dry and the trees too close and they didn’t want the whole park to go up in flames.
“They’re names,” Dean muttered mostly to himself. He’d seen enough hit list in his life to recognize one.
“Claire and Jack will be at the shelter all day, right?” he propped himself up on an elbow. He watched as Cas’ back muscles shifted under his skin, missing the wings as much as appreciating them not obscuring the view.
After dropping Jack and Claire at school like usual – and he and Cas needed to speak about what to tell them – he turned towards Burbank. Sam lived not an hour away in good traffic, a lovely apartment a couple minutes from the courthouse and he was usually at home on Thursday.
Cas looked at Dean briefly, as if he would know more about how to handle this. Naomi followed his gaze and hummed thoughtfully, her head tilting in a familiar way.
“C’mere,” he turned onto his back lazily and pulled Cas with him, the angel following until his forearms perched on Dean’s chest, their bare legs tangled under the covers. Dean’s palm glided up and down on the expanse of his boyfriend’s back before settling softly between his shoulder blades.
Cas was still perching over him when he answered, “He’s an angel. We were friends. My best friend, and not just how angels see that.”
“Upstairs.” Cas answered him. His new range of hearing was still a bit creepy. “Can you get her down, please?”
“Yes, I am,” came the sure answer as Cas went to the desk under the window where the ingredients were arranged around a bowl.
It didn’t take long for him to tense up and come down Dean’s throat, back arching and legs trembling.
There was one right next to the door, thank God, and his good hand was shaking when he pulled it, then used the badge again. Fuck!
Cas hummed, a hand resting comfortably on Dean’s waist. He was completely dry like he hadn’t just come from a downpour.
The work was monotonous and Dean welcomed it. He loved tinkering under the hood of a car, dissecting and putting back together the heart of a difficult machine. He’d always liked fidgeting with something, learning how it worked, knowing every little nuance of its structure.
Cas stood there for a moment longer with a face that screamed aggravated. Then his shoulders loosened a bit.
“You’re an idiot,” Sam sighed and followed Cas. Fair. Dean shouldn’t joke about this until Gabriel was safe and sound. He cursed himself before joining them.
“Shit, Cas,” he groaned when their groins pressed together again, Cas taking over and wrapping one of his hands around both of them, the other glued to Dean’s waist and helping him move. He was taking long, gulping breaths, inhaling the smell of Omega arousal.
Cas had later returned the favor with eagerness and intense focus, observing every one of Dean’s reactions and damn, the blue balls had been worth every damn second for the experience of coming apart under Cas’ touch.
“How’d you make the transition?” Rowena had retired around the same time as Dean and Sam, but after serving double the years the Winchesters had. Dean had hated it, every aspect except one who was in the living room with Bobby and Sam right now. Rowena, on the other hand… “Here you seem so calm. At ease.” The house was full of flowers, the kitchen seemed stocked and Rowena herself was just as elegant as ever in her long dress, perfect make-up and curled red hair.
“But nothing went missing,” Mrs. Tran said it like accusation and yeah, she was right. It was a B&E, the apartment completely torn apart, but ultimately everything was there. They hadn’t found what they were looking for. They’d left Kevin dead on the living room floor.
“I don’t like it either but that’s the protocol. Sorry, Dean,” she grimaced but then brightened up again. “But hey, now we can get a coffee and ask you openly about that thing.”
Jimmy Novak looked like Cas’ clone. Same height and built, even the light stubble was there, but at the same time he couldn’t differ more from his brother. His dark hair was neatly combed and he was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and dark jeans. And his movements were somewhat looser, like he was more comfortable in his body. He looked exactly like the suburban dad Cas had said he was.
“I read Bobby’s books all night. There were many mentions about angels healing and I thought I would give it a try.” The sudden alarm must’ve been obvious on Dean’s face because he continued. “I tested it already outside on a plant and a stray cat. Both were successful. And I was very careful, Dean, believe me.”
“Already talked to her. It’s fine. I think she just wanted to bitch about something.” He smiled a bit. “Keep the usual boundaries, don’t let anyone see you and we’ll be okay.” His husband still seemed unsure, biting at his lower lip. “Those wings are a part of you now. No need to hide them from us. Besides,” he smirked, and trailed his hand over Cas’ waist, “I really enjoy 'em, too.”
They were hiding something, but Dean couldn’t guess what. And they were teenagers, for fuck’s sake, that was what they did. Didn’t mean Dean had to like it.
Convincing Sam to let Charlie hack the system to modify Cas’ file so it seemed like he was still in the Force had been the hardest part and it probably raised red flags in the CIA, but it was worth it for the easy access to the base. The Winchesters were confident enough to know they could get away if they were quick before the nearest unit was on them.
She was surprisingly quiet for the rest of the ride and only spoke up when Dean stopped the car in the warehouse the team had decided on days ago, in the industrial section of the city. They had to wait for the others before Dean would call Henriksen.
The woman snarling at him was middle-aged with messy brown hair and a feral expression, her clothes dirty and tattered. The room was a mess, the sun lighting up everything through the enormous hole in the roof. There was dust and filth, a swarm of flies buzzing in the air.
The massive complex that was the CIA base in Langley was looming over Dean ominously as he drove the car towards the garage under the building.
“Half an hour,” Cas said and put his phone away as they got out of the car. “Should I get us something for lunch? I saw a pizza place just down the corner.”
Cas came first, his body shuddering over Dean’s, his face hidden in the hunter’s collarbone. Dean followed soon after, hips stuttering and eyes rolling into the back of his head as he let go.
Roman was quite heavy for such a skinny guy. His burned-out eyes were creepy, his mouth still open from his last scream. They put him on the couch because where else could they put him?
Dean pulled back from his lips and decided to take charge – Cas seemed to be in the mood for it and who was he to argue. So he took a steadying breath and pushed Cas back onto the mattress. He quickly got rid of his own top and slid down a little to start working on Cas’ jeans. Cas lifted his hips just enough to help him get them off of him, looking on with blown pupils and a flush spreading all the way down his neck. While Dean was standing, he pulled off his own pants and boxers then rummaged through the duffel and fished out the lube stashed in one of the pockets.
It was already dark when they finally arrived at the quaint town and bothering a grieving mother probably wasn’t the best idea, so Cas pointed out a motel near Neighbor Lake. They rented a room with twin beds.
Charlie waited until they were alone, not very subtly following Victor with her gaze until he was out of sight, then turned to Dean. She was surprisingly pale and she looked worried.
“Wait till she presents, that’s when the real problems start,” Dean laughed as walked towards the exit. “Be glad she was invited in the first place. Don’t let her be an outcast, that leaves its mark. She deserves way better than that.”
“Man, it’s so good to see you. Nothing’s the same since you and Sam fucked off,” Ash looked positively giddy. “What are you looking for?” He also knew that Dean was not here to catch up and that they were on a time limit.
“They were humans,” he said completely seriously. “Every one of them. When a soul goes down there, it goes through a completely agonizing process. There’s a reason why there are so many sources that depict Hell as an extremely sadistic torturer chamber. The Greeks, Dante, you saw
“I love that,” Cas nodded. He opened the back door with a wave of his hand to let Miracle in. She trotted up to Jack, the one who was most likely to give her belly rubs. “And you can help him with other things, too. He really needs a break.”
“So get this,” Sam opened the file, pulling out a bunch of papers. “I’ve been consulting with Lily and when I told her what I was looking into, she gave me some data about the angels she knows – birth date and place, mostly.”
“And what about Castiel?” Rowena changed topic. She was biting her lip worriedly. She’d told them Cas had twisted his ankle while pushing her out of the way of the bullets, the idiot. The gesture had clearly touched her.
“Hi, Dean,” Single-Mom Lisa greeted him as she was out watering her plants, like she did most mornings in late spring.
“Never understood what you saw in me then,” Cas said quietly and his hand squeezed around Dean’s. “I was an awkward nerd.”
It should’ve been terrifying and it had been, that feeling. But Dean wouldn’t have changed it for the world. He cast a glance at his husband’s face and Cas was looking at him with those soft eyes full of adoration he still wasn’t sure he deserved but basked in it nonetheless.
“I, uh –” he started intelligently. “You want to, I dunno, go out somewhere if we survive this? Grab some dinner?” He was sure he was looking like a teenager asking out his crush but he already knew he had lost all his game when it came to Cas.
Dean took a step to the left to get a better look at him and his blood ran cold when he’d seen the gun pointing straight at Sam’s nape.
Dean tried to describe the way they were invincible under his skin like some kind of metal and how they were the softest, fluffiest thing he’d ever touched, the silky feeling bewitching. He had to pull away before he was getting more into it than appropriate, and Cas welcomed the reprieve with a relieved sigh – the way his pupils were blown let Dean know he wasn’t the only one affected.
“That’ll cost you a gun,” he put his hands in his pockets. “A life for a life. I love poetic things like that.”
“We’ll get there,” Cas panted and he stepped away to start the shower, checking the temperature with the back of his hand. Dean finished stripping off his clothes, eyes mostly on the firm ass and thighs just in front of him. Fuck.
Dean was okay, for the most part, utterly and completely drained, mostly emotionally, but alright. He felt a little bit of life returning to him when they turned into their street and then Charlie stopped the engine in front of her and Dorothy’s garage.
“Hello, Dean,” he smiled warmly and Dean went in for a chaste kiss to feel it against his lips. “That’s a terrible line in a graveyard, by the way.”
“Dean, that’s utter nonsense,” Cas said incredulously. “You’re the most amazing, selfless, caring person I’ve ever met. Why would I want to be anywhere else than by your side?” He leaned up for a tender kiss. “You’re anything but ordinary. And I may have wings now but this doesn’t mean I’m going to fly away from you. You have to trust me on that.”
Sam and Cas were sitting at one of the tables, talking quietly, Cas briefing Sam in on the last few days.
“You want to go first?” Dean nodded towards the open bathroom door after an exasperated shake of his head and decided to take off the comforter.
“Looks good on you,” Cas nodded at the glasses and Dean felt blood rushing to his face. He pulled the glasses off and handed it back to Cas who took it with the barest hint of a smirk.
“You said the Men of Letters would take him in! Of course I didn’t tell you! Who knows what ya’ll would do to him!” How could Charlie even think that Dean would ever do that to Cas?
That was when he saw it. Hanging at Dorothy’s hip there was an old-looking leather shoulder bag, the kind Dean had last seen in Indiana Jones. That was not the problem, it looked cool. No, what made his blood run cold was the symbol edged into it over the clasp, not enormous but clearly visible: the Aquarian Star.
“You wanna, what, break into the hospital?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “We back to doing illegal things now?”
“We’re on a time limit now,” Sam shouted over the sound of the engine and the wind. “You know where we have to go?”
“Yeah,” he answered carefully. Roman had been declared missing two weeks ago. Dean was almost hoping that was it for them, that they missed Roman’s trips to the garage, but now here Victor was, talking about it.
“We have an hour before I’m meeting up with Charlie and Dorothy at Donnie’s. She says they don’t wanna hurt you. If that’s true, then I pray to you,” he turned to Cas.
“Of course not,” Cas crossed his arms beside Dean. “What would be the point of that? You feel guilty enough over this as it is.”
So execution of the mission itself was left to the brothers and Bobby, who had put up a viable protest, but was outvoted into being their ominous general. Sam and Dean had to play his bodyguards.
“Thanks, Cas,” he smoothed a couple wayward strands of Cas’ hair down. “How are you, though? Not tired, I guess, but – how are you?”
He’s got a point. But all signs point to yes. Cas won’t even look him in the eye right now and it’s freaking hilarious now that the tables have turned. But, now that he’s thinking about it, time is a fickle thing.
“Dean, I know.” And fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck his life. Cas continues, “When I possess a vessel, I get all their memories. I know about your time with Mr. Ness.”
, Cas is coming to him completely naked, closing the door behind him and hovering over Dean’s sweaty form. “You’re very patient, Dean. Such a good little slut for me,” he murmurs over Dean’s cheek, placing a small kiss there before trailing downwards. Over his jaw, down his neck, his collarbones.
And the silence is back. Dean steals a glance to find that Cas went back to his previous position; hands folded over his lap and staring straight ahead.
And Cas is… he’s smiling. He’s fucking smirking, the bastard. Like the cat that caught the fucking canary.
Cas seems to want to get closer, wrapping his arms around Dean, tucking him close as he fucks the living daylights out of his boyfriend. Without words, Cas seems to know exactly what to do. And soon, Dean’s orgasm is approaching.
Dean hisses at the stretch. It’s been too damn long. God, they needed a vacation. But right now, this moment was it. Cas inside him, fitting like puzzle pieces. God, it felt good. So good.
, that did something to Dean. Cas didn’t swear often, and it was sexy. He forgets sometimes that Cas was also Castiel, Angel of the Lord: devout angel to an absent God. To him, he’s just… Cas. Badass, amazing… sexy Cas. His boyfriend. His partner. His lover.
Dean comes with a silent cry as Cas fucks him through it. He’s boneless, letting Cas chase his own orgasm and spill deep into his lover.
It's quiet again. and Dean lets his foot off the brake to pull over into a patch of gravel. He turns off the engine and turns to his… partner? Boyfriend? Lifelong companion? Cas. His Cas.
Cas presses a small kiss to his neck like it’s a reward. Whatever. Dean’s happy. But he can’t resist being a little shit, still.
Dean won’t say much about his time in the 40s. It wasn’t that it was traumatizing. It wasn’t! He had the time of his fucking life! He got to dress up, be all suave, live in the lawless town of Chicago, Illinois with Elliot Ness. and… Elliot freakin’ Ness!
And just as quickly, Cas resumes his trail of possessive kisses down his sternum and over his happy trail, stopping just above the edge of his boxers. He tugs at the elastic band before snapping it against Dean’s hipbones and he yelps.
“Ahem, yeah, okay, um,” he mutters, trying to gather his thoughts. “So, uh, I was thinking. besides Lily Sunder, you ever do any more missions on earth?”
Just right then, Cas decides to look at him, piercing and annoyed blue eyes staring right at him. He still won’t say anything but Dean knows the answer.
Dean eagerly returns the kiss, letting Cas take the reins because it is so satisfying to annoy Cas to the point of sex. Annoyed Cas means Dean getting fucked into next week.
Dean’s never run and shucked off his pants so fast in his life, eager to please. His back hits the leather chair and he inches backwards to make room for Cas. And of course his boyfriend takes his sweet fucking time getting there, grabbing their clothes and
. He feels Cas deep in his bones and before he knows it, Cas snaps his hips forward and a shrill sound escapes Dean’s lips. “Shit!”
The tires groan from abruptly stopping and Dean winces at the state of his baby. She’s due for a tune-up in the Bunker’s garage. But Dean’s mind is elsewhere.
Cas’ sentences are clipped. “Yes. I did. Several times. I believe the last time before I took Jimmy's vessel as my own was in the 1940’s.”
And oh, he knows what Cas is trying to pull out of him. But Dean’s too dizzy with need to care. “Please,” he murmurs.
“Who are they?” Cas asked instead of answering, putting sugar into his mug and stirring it around. “
He concluded his experiment shortly after that, ushering them inside. The sun was already setting so while Bobby put a stack of books on his desk, Dean went to the kitchen to put together some dinner, Cas joining him to keep him company.
“Where are we?” Dean looked around in awe. They were pretty high up on a mountaintop, one of the many of what he could see. He spotted a big lake some distance away, surface glittering in the last rays of the sun. The only sign of humanity was a lonely hiking path way beneath them.
No, instead both Jack and Claire spent more and more time out of the house, whole afternoons disappearing who knew where. Dean couldn’t even stop that, because their homework was always done, their grades hadn’t dropped and they were always home for dinner or would text an hour beforehand that they were gonna be home by ten for curfew.
Henriksen shook off his dizziness enough to grab Dean’s collar and using his slight advantage in strength pushed Dean into the wall made of glass that looked into the hallway (kind of flashy, but okay), tearing off the curtains in the meantime. It took Dean a couple seconds to get a grip on his opponent while slipping out of his clutch. They both landed on the floor, Henriksen rolling a couple feet away from him. The stunt made Dean a little disoriented, just enough that when he stood up, he missed Henriksen’s face with his fist. It cost him a steel drawer from the shelf behind the agent, smacking him in his forehead. He sprawled out on the desk behind him and he really hoped he hadn’t gotten a concussion. He wanted to get laid after this, damn it!
“Well, your garage. Not that I understand it, they didn’t tell me that much. They mostly finished investigating the biggest rivals so they’re going onto less probable suspects. They should turn up in your yard at some point this week, after they wrapped it up with that Crowley guy.”
Cas hummed into his mouth when he leaned down to kiss him again and Dean simply took his time. Cas’ skin was salty under his tongue as he went lower on his body. He remembered it clearly, every little dip and angle, everything that made Cas twitch, and it was still like discovering something new.
Dean had told Cas all this with a lot less cohesively and with way more stuttering and blushing in the middle of a make-out session, already hard and wanting but not daring to take it further. Cas had been more than okay with waiting, his smile so radiant at the news Dean had been a bit affronted. Up until Cas had said he was happy because it meant he was special. Damn, Dean had almost cried then.
“What the –” Dean looked towards the door where a brunette stood in a canvas jacket and jeans, hand steady on a Colt. She looked familiar.
They left Sam alone in the library, walking down the corridor, Dean leading them back to the garage.
“Great,” Jack beamed. “I need help with my Spanish homework. Oh, you’re doing Physics! Wait for me.” He dashed up the stairs and in a minute returned with his backpack, sitting down next to Claire and pulling out his textbook and a pen. “Okay, so what’s the difference between vectors and scalars?”
They met a drift of bullets half a floor in, Dean could hear the shots through Rowena’s earpiece. There was also a crashing sound, probably the driver losing control and propelling into another car. Rowena kept the machine gun going, not letting them take a breath.
“And here comes the idiot who got shot,” she said with her strong Scottish accent, her perceptive eyes landing on Dean’s arm even though the wound wasn’t visible.
The Impala’s black hood was gleaming in the low light of the streetlamps. She was as beautiful as he’d left her just three weeks ago on her monthly upkeep. He’d made sure the family car would be unknown except by people he trusted completely. The list was extremely short.
“Yes, yes, thanks to you. It was my ex, he’s kind of a jerk. I don’t know what would’ve happened if you haven’t stepped in.”
“Yep?” he asked as he waited by the car. The others had already taken up position, and Bela was standing next to him, chained to the concrete floor by Sam.
Cas’ face softened into a smile, crinkles appearing in the corner of his eyes. His free hand cradled Dean’s jaw, his thumb smoothing over the stubble on his cheek and Dean leaned into the gentle touch readily which made Cas’ smile wider.
It took a while but Dean got all the buttons undone, the shirt opening for him and he tugged on the collar impatiently. Cas let him go for the time it took him to shrug it off then probably decided Dean needed to be naked as soon as possible, because he started on his plaid with a single-minded focus.
Castiel popped off, a thin string of saliva still linking them momentarily before Dean was leaning forward and pulling him back in to lick into his mouth.
"Would you like something else, Dean?" Cas smirked down at him. "All you have to do is ask." Dean screwed his eyes shut and swallowed his pride.
was that?" Dean asked airily, moments later when he remembered how to breathe again. Cas, who had buried his face in Dean's neck and practically deflated, took a moment to respond.
"Yeah?" He hummed into Cas's pulse point before sucking on it gently, drawing another keen from him.
Yeah, no. Way too long. Dean's half-convinced Cas is fucking with him, too. His suspicion stemmed from Cas's sudden love of eating every meal with them and requesting things like wings or fries.
Castiel nodded and plopped himself into the passenger seat. Dean shut the trunk and got in beside him. He turned the key in the ignition, and the Impala roared to life as Dean maneuvered out of their underground garage and into the daylight. Castiel rolled down his window as Dean pulled out onto 36 to head west and opened up on Baby's throttle, feeling the ever-present knot of tension in his chest loosen as her V8 sang through the chassis beneath them. He pulled the first tape from his pocket and presented it to the former angel, who took it and inspected it.
"Oh, that's right," he purred, twisting his palm around Dean's leaking head and grinding his hips deep into him. "
"Anything, Angel, seriously." He pressed his lips to the heated flesh under Cas's jaw, sucking hard and nipping gently.
The aforementioned guitar solo currently happened to be giving Dean a crisis, the notes long associated with seduction. He had lied down to 'test' his tape the previous night and embarrassingly enough, hardly made it past the drumbeat before Jimmy Page launched into a masterfully curated solo.
"Hey buddy, need some help there?" He chuckled and showed him how to start a new pot of coffee. Castiel thanked him sheepishly as Dean handed him a steaming mug.
"You been reading up, Cas?" Dean gasped as Castiel straddled his thighs and leaned down to suck on his collarbone.
"Okay, back seat, now, please." he gasped and gently pushed at Cas's chest, sitting up to haul the cooler into the front seat as they tumbled into the back, a tangle of limbs. Dean attempted to regain some control by leaning Cas down onto the seat and wedging himself between his legs.
"Good work, buddy," Dean panted as Cas piled up the bodies at his feet, and wiped blood away on his jeans. "Guess you hardly need us."
It's stopped raining." He grunted, and man, if that didn't ruin the mood. Dean lifted his head to peer into the darkness beyond the windows. Dean's blood stopped rushing in his ears and silence fell into the car except for
"You're so beautiful like this, Dean... Like you were built for taking my cock... " he drew back and drove a particularly hard thrust into Dean's prostate, leaning in to suck marks into Dean's chest, now flushing red with embarrassment from the praise.
"Aren't you sharing it with me? Am I not 'special'?" Castiel pressed, and Dean was beginning to panic internally. Were Cas's lips always this pink? There's no way his eyes were that blue until, like, just now.
"These lyrics are very... provocative." Castiel mused, sipping from his half-empty bottle. Dean was pulled out of his reverie by his coughing fit.
"Dean." He ground out as the hunter ducked down to mouth at his neck, rocking steadily into Castiel. Dean pushed Cas's shirt up, appreciating the firm muscular abdomen beneath his hands.
"Yeah I'll have a beer, I guess we'll be here a while." Dean held out his hand as Cas plopped a cold bottle into it and settled back into his seat with one of his own. Dean unhooked the bottle opener from the keys still in the ignition and opened their bottles. They gave a sardonic toast and took a sip, watching the rain assail the windshield, the cadence complimenting the beginning of John Bonham's drumbeat.
"I uh, blew a tire," Dean mumbled. "The spare's in the trunk, I just don't think I can fix the wheel unless the rain lets up a bit." He dropped his head against the steering wheel. The second side of the tape popped out of the stereo once again.
"Whatever, Stoney baloney... Don't you usually smoke out on the roof, anyway?" Dean asked, filling up the first bucket with hot water and suds, the second with only cold water.
." Dean whimpered, writhing under the sensation of Cas's hot breath and slick tongue. Cas finally gave in and sat up, reclaiming the bottle of lube to squeeze a sizeable portion directly onto Dean's entrance. Dean shivered from the sudden cold, only to cry out again when Cas's strong index finger slid in with very little resistance.
Castiel reached a hand down to palm Dean's erection. Dean almost protested. He wasn't ready for this to be over, except that Cas's brow was knit together with a rapt expression and he was gasping out little grunts in contrast to Dean's lewd moaning.
Castiel's free hand wove into his hair and gave a sharp tug. Dean practically purred at the sting as the column of his throat was exposed. Castiel continued his assault upwards and circled a slick finger around Dean's rim, agonizingly slow, little, torturous rotations that turned into broad linear strokes with two fingers. He grinned against his neck when Dean moaned and bucked forward.
"Did you need him for anything else?" Dean bit down on his tongue in a failed attempt to reintroduce moisture to his mouth.
"I don't think the kitchen is the best place for this." He rumbled into their shared space. Dean perked back up when he realized the proposition.
Dean watched as he strode out of the kitchen before sitting down at the table to enjoy his breakfast.
He lifted the back end and wrenched off the wheel with the flat, with mild difficulty due to the rain-slick, well, everything. He placed the temp onto the wheel hub, muttering apologies to Baby while he did it, claiming she'd have a fresh set of tires tomorrow, and no later. He shed his flannel, now soaked from leaning against the car while he worked.
Standard bottoms mostly, some jeans, a pair of slacks, some plaid pajamas, and sweat pants. Tops were interesting, in the endearing kind of weird so very on-brand for Cas; a wolf shirt the very staple of thrift establishments, some random high school event tees, button-up shirts in an array of colors, a few overshirts similar to the ones he owns, one black, navy, red, green, but no plaid. What caught Dean's eye was the three in the top of the cart where a kid might sit; a Green Day t-shirt, a Queen tour shirt cropped off halfway, and a soft grey wool cardigan that looked like something either a grandmother or a librarian would wear. His train of thought was cut short by the leather jacket falling into the cart as well. Dean blinked a few times before meeting his best friend's eyes.
"Would you like some?" He asked, looking over at Dean with a twist of his slender fingers as his tongue darted out to wet the rolling paper's adhesive. Dean swallowed.
"No, but I don't want to influence him, he's very impressionable, you know." Cas flicked the collecting ash into a labelless beer bottle that sat discarded in his chair's cupholder.
"Another mix? There's uh, this one... but- it's kinda personal-" Dean bumbled, trying to put the tape back in his pocket but missing it. Cas grabbed it from him gently.
Cas caressed the contours of Dean's back reverently, before gingerly parting Dean's cheeks and licking a broad stripe across his hole. Dean felt his whole body twitch.
That is... until she popped a tire on him. On a pitch-black country road. In the middle of a torrential rainstorm. Okay, maybe it was a little his fault. He should have known that she was a little overdue for a new set of tires.
"When I raised you, it left an imprint of my grace on your soul. I didn't think I'd still be able to feel it, but I suppose it remains. We should shower." The fallen angel panted, slowly pushing himself up to roll off Dean and sit up.
He followed Cas inside and tossed the keys onto the dining table. Castiel ditched the assortment of bags and rounded on Dean, crowding him up against the wall and kissing him hard. Dean couldn't prevent the moan it prompted from his chest. His hands slid the flannel from Cas's shoulders and he began to pull at the shirt he vaguely remembered was his own. Castiel pulled back and shed his top layers, pulling Dean's damp shirt off immediately afterward and attacking his mouth again.
Dean was a little concerned that he noticed Cas's hands before he noticed the toned and tanned chest underneath the shirt. He ran a hand down his face and moved to pour more coffee. Cas passed over the pot and turned to the stack of pancakes, tossing two onto a plate and proceeding to destroy them with fruit and whipped cream.
Cas's pupils grew wide, and he curiously pushed his thumb deeper. Dean closed his lips over it and sucked gently, noting the faint taste of the strawberries Cas had put on his pancakes. Dean pulled back before he embarrassed himself any further.
"I'm going to go find Jack. Let me know when Sam's back with dinner." He passed Dean with a  warm squeeze to his shoulder. Dean watched him go, then realized just how long it's been since he's been laid. Too fucking long, apparently.
thorough cleaning and wrapped his towel around his waist, hurrying back down the hallway to his room. Cas was sitting on the bed patiently.
I'm so close," Dean gasped, jerking his hips up into Cas's grip, then back down onto his cock. "You gonna make me come, baby?"
Dean was loading the cooler into the backseat and his emergency duffel into the trunk and froze when Cas wandered into the garage, now in a blue flannel and what appeared to be one of Dean's AC/DC shirts. Cas must have caught him looking because he spoke, apologetic.
"Very much so. For a man who claims to be sexually proficient, you seem very nervous, Dean," Castiel taunted lightheartedly, running his hands down Dean's torso to unbutton the hunter's jeans, pulling them down and backing off the bed to remove his own. "I brought your body and soul back together, atom by atom. There's nothing I didn't already know about you."
"It's wonderful, Dean," Cas cut him off and gave him a smile in between sips of beer. "However I may take Sam up on his offer of a digital listening device, in the interest of having more than 13 songs to listen to." He mused, nodding along to the aimless shouting Robert Plant often compared to faking an orgasm in the middle of the song ramping up to the guitar solo.
"It's raining," Cas replied, voice husky from the strain of holding in a hit. "Frankly, the Bunker is well ventilated enough that I could smoke in the library... where we still keep ashtrays on the table, but I figured I'd come in here to keep it away from Jack." He mused, blowing his lungful of smoke out the door.
"What time would you like to leave?" Castiel asked, picking at the bowl of sliced fruit that Sam must have left. Dean disregarded it and made for the fridge, sure of leftover bacon.
"C-Cas, please..." Dean tilted Cas's face up to kiss him again. Dean keened into his mouth and pushed back, desperately trying to get Cas inside.
Now, however, he was absently tracing its outline after a shower, staring more through the mirror than at it while recalling the events of breakfast. Jack had playfully started the comparing hand sizes game that seems to entertain kids so much.
Cas just chuckled and beckoned him closer. Dean stood between his legs and his heart dropped out of his ass when Cas took his hands and pulled gently, signaling for Dean to kneel. He lowered himself slowly to his knees and looked up at Cas, expectant, and not at all freaking out on the inside. Cas leaned in to kiss him again. That, he could work with.
resonated through the speakers as Dean sat back, rigid in his seat. Cas leaned into the backseat and popped the cooler.
Cas continued to pepper Dean's shaking shoulders with wet kisses as he thrust his finger in, curling it hard against Dean's prostate and savoring the faint sound of Dean nearly wailing into his pillow. He slid in a second finger and scissored them back and forth to make way for a third. At this point, Dean had lifted his head and turned towards Cas with pleading eyes. Cas leaned forward and kissed him deeply.
"That's very thoughtful of you, Dean," Cas smiled. "I'd love to. While I do I think you probably want to go get ready." Cas wiped the look off Dean's face when he reeled him back in for another kiss.
"Relax, my love." Cas moaned, rolling his hips into Dean, captivated by the catch of skin around him. "Do you want to move?" He asked, and released his iron hold on Dean's waist with a chuckle when Dean nodded eagerly. Dean thrust back against Cas with abandon. A surprised gasp was drawn from both of them as Cas sped up his thrusts to match. Dean was going to come if Cas didn't slow down, so he gathered his thoughts enough to speak up.
