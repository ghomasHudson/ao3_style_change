“Well, I wouldn’t say
Fortunately, he’s interrupted before he can think of a polite way to say
“Thank you,” Castiel says, although it’s more automatic courtesy than genuine gratitude.  He’s not hungry.  Maybe he’s still nauseated from spitting up seawater; maybe he’s simply in shock.
“Donna,” Sam says hoarsely, fighting a wave of nausea.  “I thought you said he was shot.”
Dean’s eyes are closed, like he’s avoiding his own reflection in the mirror.  He doesn’t open them.  “Just a bad dream, Cas.  Humans have bad dreams.”
Castiel stands there for a minute, shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot with questions piling up in his head.  But Frank’s still on edge, and he hasn’t holstered his pistol, and Castiel doesn’t want to risk being shot through the head.
Cas realizes abruptly that his hands have curled into fists, his jaw clenched tight, and he can feel a flush creeping over his face.  He draws a deep breath and tries to relax.  He really has to practice not reacting to things outwardly; it might blow their cover.
Sam makes a face.  “Do you really want her to?”
Her parents rush outside a moment later, mother tearful, father scooping her easily from Castiel’s sore arms.
house?”
“That’s perfect,” Cas agrees.
“So I knew you and Dean would be here before I came in.”
Sam mistakes his silence for anger or disappointment, and tries to explain.  “I… I want to give Dean a normal life,” he says.  “As normal as possible.  And if anything happens to me or Eileen…”  Sam shakes his head.  “I’m not willing to risk that.”
He shuts the fridge, turns, and stops short.
“You—”  Castiel pauses.  “You’re having me on.”
“Wait,” he says, once again confused.  “If you can sense monsters, then why would you worry about testing me?”
Cas is gazing thoughtfully up at the dead eyes of the taxidermied deer.  “I’m still confused as to why a vampire—”  He stops abruptly, clearing his throat as Lilah returns with their drinks.
“So,” Dean says, stepping into Cas’s space and hooking an arm around Cas’s lower back.  “What now?”
Dean laughs, a sound that could only be charitably described as authentic.  “Freaky little thing, ain’t it?” he says, and follows Frank.
Dean’s just quietly frowning at Cas from the seat to his right, like he’s trying to decipher some kind of code.
Sam has braced his elbows on the back of the sofa to keep from losing his balance.  “I’ve never heard you swear before, Cas!”
Dean swears loudly and abruptly, dread clouding his face.  “I think I know what we’re dealing with here.”
The day has warmed considerably, but it’s still only a couple degrees above freezing.  Eileen finishes her lunch quickly in order to shove her hands into her pockets and protect them from the frigid air.  Sam surveys the square, watching people go about their day.  Eileen imagines the square is busier during the work week, but even on a Sunday there are dozens walking in all directions with thick scarves and hats and their coat collars turned up against the cold.  A handful of the public benches are occupied by even more homeless people, huddled under coats and sleeping bags to keep warm.
Dean nods, fingertips prickling as though Cas just shot him through with grace.
Great.  A side helping of guilt, too.
It’s kind of cute, except for the part where they keep leaving the cleanup to Sam.
It’s a peanut butter and jelly cheesecake.
“Whatcha doing?” Dean asks, leaning over to peer at the page beneath Cas’s thumb.  He nestles into his right side and slings his long arm around Cas’s neck, hand coming down to rest on Cas’s left shoulder.
She screams like an angry puma, retreating and clutching her flank where he’s split her open.  The retreat only lasts a minute, however, and she lunges at him again.  Cas is knocked off his feet and slams into the concrete roof with her on top of him, huge jagged teeth gnashing mere inches from his nose.  He scrambles to keep her from literally biting his face off, and sees out of the corner of his eye that his machete has clattered several feet away, toward the edge of the roof.
“Cas, what are— Whoa, whoa,” Dean cuts his own question off and quickly crosses the floor to the sink.  “Hey.”
Sam blinks and rises from the table.  “It is?”
It’s all Sam can do not to scream, and he pulls the tarp back over Cas’s face before going to help with the pyre.
Dean leaves the alleyway, and Castiel makes a face at his back before returning with him to the busy street.  If Dean expects him to play nanny to some stranger’s child, he’s got another thing coming.  Frankly, Castiel would rather face down another mermaid.
Frank flips his machete in hand.  “Simpler to cut through.”
Paradis pauses the video, and leans back with a huff.  “I’m guessing he threw them in the ocean when they didn’t get collected.”
He pushes any thoughts of Lisa out of his head.  As important as she was (and still is), she has no place here in Cas’s bedroom.
So Cas is pissed off.  He’s pissed at Sam.  He’s pissed at Jack.  He’s pissed at himself for acting like this and not being able to keep his anger to himself, where the only person it hurts is him.  And he’s pissed at Dean for being dead.
Before Dean can open his mouth to answer, there’s a sound of heavy boots approaching from behind him.  A tall man, dark-haired and hard-faced and wearing a long black coat, descends from the quarterdeck.  From the way the entire crew stiffens and straightens when he approaches, parting like the Red Sea, Castiel deduces he must be their captain.  Dean squares his shoulders in an almost defiant gesture, an odd reaction to a superior officer.
Cas grins up at him, seeming to congratulate himself for discovering one of Dean’s sensitive spots, and reaches up to tug the other one.
“Heart missing?” asks Claire, glancing at Cas.  She’s unbothered by the gore, but instead is confused as to why a vampire victim would be missing their heart.
Castiel searches the deck for Dean.  He’s by the stairs to the quarterdeck, helping Bobby to his feet, blatant worry etched across his face.  “I’m fine, kid,” Bobby says, though he sways just a little.
Eileen slaps his upper arm with the back of her hand.  “I
Cas leans into frame on Sam’s phone suddenly, only one eye and his nose visible, much too close to the camera.  “There’s a place on Commercial Street,” he says, and Eileen yelps as he accidentally elbows her in the ribs.  “It’s got burgers; I looked it up.”
At the implication that his confession might have been merely a means to an end, nothing more than a calculated strategic battle move, Cas is offended.  His eyebrows snap into a frown, his eyes flashing a deeper shade of blue.  “That doesn’t mean it isn’t true,” he replies lowly.
Cas swallows, then gently pushes the door open.  Dean is hunched over the sink, elbows on the porcelain and forehead resting in his hand.  He’s splashed water on his face; his chin is dripping.
Jack leans on the Impala’s hood, and Cas does the same beside him.  It’s a clear night, and this far from any big city lights, the sky is awash with stars.  There’s no moon, but the heavens are anything but dark.  The breeze whistles softly through the cornfields, the stalks shaking in their regiments.
“She’s all right,” Dean says as Castiel takes the girl from him.
, until Cas is human, to let death keep him?
The thing lands in a flurry of limbs and animalistic shrieking, arms and legs much too long for its short potbellied torso.  Frank hollers and flails, unable to fling the douen off him.  Dean swears loudly and tries his best to get close, to get a clear chance to stab the creature with his knife, but both it and Frank are moving too quickly and Dean has an equal chance of accidentally stabbing Frank in the gut.
“Not too far,” Garth says, peering at the children.  “It was a douen?”
, and
Jack shakes his head.  “I’ve reached into the Empty myself before.  I’m sure I can do it.”
Dean pulls the car onto the road.  “Does it matter?”
see Dean again, I promise.  But your life isn’t pointless without him.  And destroying Dean’s things won’t bring him back.”
he really should have worn proper clothes
Castiel exhales slowly, looking up toward the
He nods and waves her off, sipping his coffee while the rest of them eat.
“Yeah, actually, we got lucky there.”
Sam falls in step behind Dean, who leads him through the back door.  Here there’s no porch and the steps are stone, dropping straight into grass.  A well-worn path meanders across the ground and leads up the slope to a spacious garden.  A tilled patch of earth gives rise to cornstalks and vines of squash, and raised wooden beds are bursting with peas and carrots and peppers.  The garden is abuzz with honeybees, life thrumming in the soil.
Sam shakes his head.  “No, I think we’re good.  Just the check, please.”
Cas doesn’t stop, his breath growing more ragged by the second.  He sighs Dean’s name into his mouth and Dean clenches around him, making Cas’s eyes slip closed at the sensation.  Sweat beads across Cas’s forehead and his grip on Dean’s wrists tightens.  Dean can’t move, and doesn’t want to.
At that, Cas does laugh — a heavy, belly-aching kind of laugh that has Dean wondering what’s so damn funny until he says, “Well, that about sums us up, doesn’t it?”
“You are a creature of habit, Dean.”  Cas opens the newspaper and flips through it looking for anything about Fred Sargent’s murder, or anything else strange.
“The universe is big, Castiel,” Jack says, gazing upward.  “Bigger than any human can understand, or any angel for that matter.  And it’s getting bigger every day.  There’s so
“Well, I’m not fitting in there,” Frank says, gesturing pointedly to his more-than-ample figure and broad shoulders.
Dean thuds back down the steps and bumps against Eileen’s hip to get her attention.  “Mom, can I have a juice box?” he asks, deftly switching to ASL.
Castiel nods, staring up at the cliffs that wall in the cove.  Seagulls scream and swoop through the air overhead.
Castiel shakes his head and holds up the douen’s arms, neither one deformed.  “This isn’t the same one that attacked us in the woods.  I thought you said they were solitary.”
Rufus dispatches the last mermaid with a scowl, then spits on its corpse.
hits him with a force like a tidal wave, and he goes weak at the knees.  He grabs the railing of the steps up to the foredeck and braces himself against the sudden urge to vomit.
of favors.
Dean grips Jack’s upper arm.  “Still with us?”  His voice is clipped and shaking, betraying how scared he really is.
a world and Dean can’t quite let go of the idea that the spell won’t be able to reach that far.
“I meant,” Eileen says through a yawn, “why are you doing it so early?  Sun’s barely up.”
Sam is already reaching for his coat where it’s hung on the back of his chair.  “I’ll start the car while you get dressed.”
“I’m not positive, but it sure looks like it,” Gagnon replies, peering closely at the wounds like he’s looking for something else he might have missed.  “It doesn’t make any sense.”
Dean winks at him and doesn’t argue the point.
Dean and Castiel exchange a look, then burst into laughter.  “I swear, I never know what to say to kids,” Dean chuckles as they turn toward the harbor.
After a quick pit stop to change into their suits before returning to the Portland police station, Sam and Dean are greeted at the reception desk by a uniformed officer who immediately recognizes Sam.  Behind them, Eileen and Cas follow, still in the same clothes from that morning.
Cas draws back from the kiss a minute later, palm on Dean’s cheek.  “Dean, you are
Sam grins and turns back to his wife.  “Problem solved,” he signs.  “He’ll tire himself out by dinner.”
the aspidochelone.  He had questions!”  Dean is seething, his fury pouring through the cracks in the door.
Castiel shifts restlessly, staring up at the back of the man who’s sleeping above him — Garth, as he’d introduced himself earlier.  Garth seems to be all limbs and very little muscle, and his arms hang down on either side like they’re made of nothing but rope.  His long legs hang, too, nearly giving Castiel the impression that he’s in a four-poster bed rather than a hammock with another man taking up more than his fair share of space.
“Dean—” Sam starts, about to try and comfort his brother, but he’s cut off.
Dean nods, running his fingers up the side of Cas’s ribs, over the Enochian tattoo he’d nearly forgotten Cas had.  “I trust you,” he says.
Paradis isn’t oblivious, and sees Cas’s reaction.  “Hey, I’m not saying it’s right,” he says, raising his hands in a placating gesture.  “I’m just saying, y’know, statistically—”
That forces another laugh out of Cas.  “I’m glad you’re having fun.”
The upper edge of the hull that comes above the deck, forming essentially a rail around the deck and keeps water from washing onto the ship.
“I was only gone for one minute.”
“Cas.”  Dean puts a firm hand on Castiel’s uninjured shoulder and forces him to meet his eye.  “You’re fine.  You made it.  Actually, you did amazing.”
He sinks into the desk chair, flipping a book closed to see what Cas had last been reading.
Dean grimly wipes blood from his hands onto his waistcoat.  “Dead.”
Two posts away, Dean’s hammock is empty.
“Oh, thanks.”  Dean isn’t hungry yet.  He leans against the counter, watching Cas as he takes a long sip from his mug.
As Dean’s body is finally tugged free, he’s suddenly
The plaid flannel tent is gone.  Cas is standing in front of him, an arm’s length away, in his own clothes.  A soft dark blue henley, with the sleeves a shade lighter, and straight-leg jeans that actually fit.  He seems taller, somehow, and broader.  He’s standing straighter — or maybe the suit and trenchcoat and oversized clothes had just made him look hunched-over and without them the optical illusion is gone.
Dodging fishermen loaded with empty nets, dock workers, and horse-drawn carts, as well as a few wandering goats and chickens, Dean and Castiel meander along the harborside.  They pass fish and fruit vendors, taverns overflowing with customers despite the early hour, and yellow-toothed prostitutes that twitch their skirts and flutter their fans as Dean and Castiel walk by.  The streets are muddied by cart wheels and scattered piles of horse shit, and Castiel decides this is exactly why he prefers living on the ocean.
Now that it’s not moving too fast to be studied, Castiel can see the douen in full horrible detail.  It’s short-bodied and long-limbed and padded with fat like a well-fed child.  Its skin is green and mottled, perfectly camouflaged with the surrounding woods.  There is no face, its head featureless apart from a small mouth ringed in sawteeth.
As Sam steps outside, Eileen only shrugs and paws through her bag for a set of clothes.  She wouldn’t want to go running in these temperatures either.
In the back of his head, Sam thinks that if the roles were reversed here, and he’d walked in on Cas lying with his head in Dean’s lap, Dean would cough and push Cas away, or make some gruff comment about not having the heart to move him.  He’d brush it off, somehow, whatever way he could.  And Sam is grateful, abruptly, that Dean’s not awake to throw up those quick defenses.
Dean looks at him like it’s the stupidest thing he’s ever heard.  “No such thing as
While it may be true that Dean finds the douen more frightening than any other creature, Castiel doesn’t believe it’s the sole reason he froze when the douen spoke.  “Dean,” he presses.
“We should be in Tortuga by the day after tomorrow,” Dean says.  “Then you can be on your way.”
“No offense taken,” Frank sneers.
The hand pulls away and Dean gulps sour air.  Immediately he shudders, aching with the lack of touch.  The burning, ripping, searing pain sweeps back in, and he grieves the loss as profoundly as any death.
cool,” he snaps, spitting out a blueberry.
The palms quake overhead as they run, feet slipping on the volcanic stone polished by years of erosion.  Castiel drops the water skins and leaves them, Inias running ahead and Ishim bringing up the rear.  The
Nothing happens.
“Seems appropriate,” Castiel remarks.  “The captain used to be in the British Army, then?  Why did he leave?”
And suddenly, Castiel can smell it too.  An awful stench of sickly sweet decay wafting out of the den and settling over the forest floor like mist.
Cas nearly snorts at that.
Cas rises from the steps to hug Sam as well, and tells Sam to bring Eileen back with him as soon as she gets here.
poster and tries to picture Claire’s face when she opens it.  It makes him laugh, even if his body’s still crackling with too much energy in every cell, and it’s enough to steady him for the moment.
Sam holds the mug in his hands for a moment before deciding to take it back home for Dean.
Cas drags the fingers gently, slowly tracing a path from Dean’s hairline down to the bridge of his nose.  He lifts his fingers and does it again, and again.
“Row!” screams Ishim, and they're rowing faster than they’ve ever done.
She nods as she places fresh ginger root on the table.
“It’s my job to see the larger picture,” is all Jack says, which explains absolutely nothing.
plenty of counter space, a baker’s bench, pots and pans hanging from a rack overhead.  On one end of the counter, a 90’s-era stereo sits beside several small potted herbs; the aroma of thyme and rosemary and basil fills the kitchen.
“You killed that one, not me,” Castiel disagrees.
“What—” Dean starts.
“You’re not dreaming,” says Jack.  “I’m here to take you home.”
Garth squints at him from a few feet away, canvas flapping loudly below them.  His earrings
Considering for a beat, Dean nods.  “You’ll tell me, though, right?  If you don’t?”
“Tell me what you want, Dean,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s lips.
Dean downs the remaining scotch.  The plastic cup hangs loosely from his fingers.
Cas very nearly jumps right out of his skin.  “Dean!” he says quickly, sitting bolt upright.  “It’s me!”
, a schooner.  A ship this size doesn’t need a crew of more than fifteen and can be managed by many fewer, and it seems most of the men aboard are here crowded around Dean and Castiel.  Around them is nothing but open water.  All signs of both the
bother him — after all, Sam and Eileen aren’t exactly subtle themselves (and Eileen has no idea how loud she is) — but he can’t help it.
Dean clears his throat, looking very intently at the knot he’s tying.  “I was born to it.”
Somehow, she’d grabbed the gun from where he dropped it, and he hadn’t noticed.  Stupid, stupid, rookie mistake.
Dean finally stops laughing for long enough to eat his pie, which he does heartily and quickly, wolfing it down like a mutt that’s not seen a proper meal in months.  Castiel eats his more slowly, savoring the richly spiced pork filling, and Dean takes a bite of a red apple, again producing food from seemingly nowhere.
There’s a large black trash bag, waterlogged and sagging, caught in the rocks.  It bobs slightly in the lapping waves but is otherwise lodged in place.  Tallie grimaces and rolls her eyes.  There are few things she hates more than a litterbug, and something about throwing garbage into the ocean seems to her to be particularly evil.
“Let’s go,” Frank urges.  “I don’t want to be stuck out here ‘til sunrise.  Douens or not, there’s plenty dangerous creatures out here, and I’m not wanting to meet them.”
this is where Cas has been all these years, this is where his soul has always belonged, and Sam can’t believe he was ever unsure of Cas’s fate.  He can’t believe he was ever unsure of Dean’s.
Sam is too busy cackling to be sorry.
Sam scrambles for a solution.  “Look, um.  Maybe if you write down what songs were on the tape and in what order, I can download the same playlist to a flash drive for you.  You can put it on your laptop.”
been following it?” Castiel demands, exasperation hooking in his throat, his words coming out sharper than he intends.  “Dean said they’d been hunting it for months."
The sound that wrenches out of Cas’s chest is holy agony, somewhere between a sob and a scream.
Rufus nudges his toe against the decapitated corpse of a human.  The head is gone, eaten already and irretrievable.  “I think this one’s Martin.”
The secretary is a young person of indeterminate gender, androgynous clothes and chipped painted nails and a wispy coat of hair on their chin.  They look up at Sam and Dean with a suspicious squint and release a sigh as they pause the
“What the hell were you thinking?” demands the captain, looming even larger against the dark, face etched in fury.  The question is aimed directly at Dean.  “You should know better than to go traipsing off into the jungle after a monster with no one to back you up!”
Dean is standing by the window, plastic tumbler of scotch in hand, peering through the curtain and across the parking lot.
“How many of these do we think are real cases and not just people wandering off?” Dean asks, scratching behind his ear.  “I mean, they might’ve moved on to somewhere else, or even just another neighborhood.”
Jody studies him, scrutinizing him like a mother.  She knows he’s not telling her everything.  He meets her gaze evenly; he doesn’t care that she knows he’s lying.
Cas rubs a clammy palm over his face, fingers digging into the edge of the mattress.  His heart thuds away in his chest.  “What the hell?” he mutters under his breath.
Eileen pinches his arm suddenly, her eyes on the bartender.  Her voice drops to a low tone, barely audible even from two feet away.  “She keeps looking at us funny.  I think she’s listening.”
Castiel opens his mouth to insist on being dropped in Havana, and then swiftly closes it again as the captain’s words fully register.  Tortuga.
Cas hums around him, and Dean nearly loses it then and there.
“They found a shed skin, Dean,” Sam counters.  “DNA testing said it was an anaconda, which can’t survive temperatures below fifty degrees.  The snake is dead; it was probably just some illegal black market pet that escaped.  And even if Wessie
” shouts a man’s voice, and Castiel’s never heard anything so welcome.
So, Sam does the only logical thing, and offers to help Dean with his resume.
There’s a strange sort of fond smile that spreads over Cas’s face, and Dean doesn’t understand it.  Cas sits there, waiting.
But Dean only turns and strides away.
Cas’s eyes widen.  “So… Dean must be thirty-two now.”
"Well," Sam says, shining his light toward the trees as if the stranger might be coming back already.  "That wasn't a vampire."
Rather than face that dilemma immediately, Castiel changes the subject.  “You said you’d been hunting the aspi— aspido—”
The fingers flex in Cas’s grip, resting on Cas’s shoulder.
.  He’s ready to go back to sleep.
Dean bumps his arm.  “You’ll like it,” he says.  “Welcome to Tortuga.”
Sam can’t help but stand in awe of Dean’s tone, but it’s not until Cas comes inside from the garden that Sam understands it.
Castiel doesn’t quite know what to do with the compliment, so he says nothing, shifting awkwardly.  Pain spikes from his bandaged shoulder at the movement and he prods at it gently with his other hand.  He’s certain he’ll end up with an unusual scar.
Dean hangs his head momentarily, raising his hands in a placating gesture.  “I’m sorry, I felt like I had to ask,” he backs down.  “I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it is all.”
A strong post that anchors the bowsprit to the skeleton of the ship.
They meet up with Cas and Dean at the diner, sliding into the booth and leaving very little elbow room.  It takes only a minute or two for Eileen to notice the tension, the hard set to Dean’s jaw as he drinks what’s likely at least his fourth cup of coffee.  Every few seconds, Cas glances at Dean from the corner of his eye, worrying as obviously as the sunlight shining through the diner window.
“Oh, sure, trust the Deaf chick to judge your Austrian accent,” Dean deadpans.
Instantly, Cas’s mouth is gone.  “Are you all right?”
the time.  Dean is right, though.  Beggars cannot be choosers.  And the more Castiel learns about sea monsters, the better dry land sounds.
In the blackness of the water, there is a creature he has never seen before.  It’s dark, barely visible against the void, except for little bioluminescent flecks along a dorsal fin.  It slithers through the water like a serpent.  As it rounds the bow, silent as a ghost, it turns and looks up, and a pair of hollow eyes flash in the light of the moon.  It has a human face.
Eileen swallows and blinks her tears away, squaring her shoulders.  “Cas, help me,” she orders.
Cas feels no pain when he hits the ground.  He doesn’t feel his bones snap into unfixable angles, or his insides as they’re destroyed by sheer gravity.  He doesn’t feel anything.
Sam is deep,
The previous time he’d been turned human, back when the condition was temporary, he’d had nowhere to live.  He’d slept on bus stop benches and wherever he could find that seemed remotely safe and out of the cold.  He’d seen the hardships faced by these people and experienced the same things firsthand.  He’d made friends, and found support in places where one might have thought people had no more to give.  And the police don’t care.
Cas can’t take his eyes off the baby’s face, but tears blur his vision.  “Really?” he asks, smiling as a tidal wave of joy surges up inside him.  The baby wraps his tiny,
Dean shakes his head.  “Nah, I’m more of a Vonnegut guy.”
He stands and goes to the door, stepping out into the corridor in nothing but his t-shirt and boxers.  His bare feet are freezing against the concrete floor.  He shuts the door behind him as quietly as possible, instinctively trying to be discreet but not knowing why.  It’s a performance for no one other than himself.  He glances over his shoulder to make sure Sam isn’t nearby (even though there’s no reason to think he would be) and walks toward Cas’s room.
Sam doesn’t argue, giving Dean the leeway he needs, and says, “I’ll stay with you, then.”
Cas turns back to watch the water rushing below their feet.  “It’s nice here.”
“None of your damn business.”
“Got it,” Cas signs back.
Cas closes the cake box.  “Are you or Eileen going to want any of this?” he asks.
Castiel scrambles forward, knocking bones out of the way as he goes, takes his knife and plunges it into the douen’s spine between the shoulder blades.  It howls, releasing Dean and arching back as blood spills over Castiel’s hand.
“I am
.  The size of his old self, his old life, never seemed quite like it could fit inside the bunker, or inside any human home, no matter how much he wanted it.
Eileen helps most of the time, but like Dean she’s less inclined toward books than action, and she finds new cases for them nearly every week.  On the one hand, it’s not much of a retirement.  On the other, once a case is done, it’s
Every question feels like a stab in Dean’s stomach, and his jaw clenches.  He looks away from Sam, down the road into the darkness.  He can feel his body wanting to cry – the ache in the back of his throat and the burning in his eyes – but he’s tapped out.
Castiel nods briefly but doesn’t speak, still attempting to wrap his mind around the idea that he’s not only fought through a monster attack, but that he’s lived to tell the tale.

“Dean,” Castiel says gently.  “You still with us?”
“I see fire and bones.”

“Jack,” Cas says, and his voice breaks.
“Nothing, you just—” Dean chuckles, lifting his gaze to meet Cas’s again.  “You only got to wear your new stuff for like ten minutes.”
Frank nods, picking up his machete from the ground and strapping it back to his belt.  The den is still burning, but not enough to spread to the rest of the forest given the level of humidity.  The screams have petered away; if there’s anything inside the den that’s still alive, it won’t be for long.  And the longer they stay here, the longer it’ll take to get the children home.
Still no response, or any indication if she’s been frightened into silence or if she simply doesn’t understand what Dean is saying.
for the night.  They douse the torches in a horse trough and leave them behind, unneeded.
simply has less area to cover, and the knots and sails are the same.
A smile creeps back onto Cas’s face like a sunrise, gradual and brilliant.  “Slow,” he echoes.  “I can do that.”
“Crew’s quarters are down there.”  Dean gestures toward the bow, where a dozen or so empty hammocks swing gently with the rocking of the ship.  “There’s more on the next level down.  You can—  You all right?”
His ears now roaring, all Dean can focus on is the sensation of Cas’s body pressing up against him, the feeling of stubble scraping his chin and Cas’s strong hands gripping him.  Through the white noise, he hears a low, almost-growling moan and it takes Dean a moment to realize that it’s coming from him.  His hands find their way down to Cas’s lower back, drawing him even closer than Dean previously thought possible.
“Yeah, I don’t think any of that’ll ever wash out.”  Dean takes another dragging gulp, feeling the coffee burn on the way down.  He tries very, very hard not to think about Cas bleeding out on the floor with his neck ripped open almost to the bone, about how close they came to losing him for good.  “We can get you a new trench coat.  If you want.”
Sam turns slowly in place, marveling at the setting
Sam snorts.  “That’s accurate.”
“How are you feeling, by the way?” Dean asks, resting his elbows on the tabletop.  “Y’know, since losing your grace.”
A shiver courses up Dean’s spine as he meets Cas’s mouth; he can feel a humming — subaudible, subatomic — radiating from Cas’s body like an oncoming earthquake.  Cas’s hand comes up to find the corner of Dean’s jaw, the shell of his ear.  His thumb on Dean’s pulse as it quickens.
The corpse has a massive cavity in its chest, a hole torn straight through skin and muscle and ribs, leaving what little is left of the internal organs exposed.  There are more wounds covering the body – gashes all over the limbs and lower abdomen, and a deep laceration all the way through the left cheek, exposing the molars.
“Don’t worry about it, Cas,” Sam replies, not looking up from his work.  He blinks a few times and rubs at his eyes with a knuckle.
someone, some hunter, will move in eventually, however far down the line.  The legacy won’t end.
A soft, blissed-out smile takes over Cas’s features, erasing any traces of worry.  The backs of his fingers lightly brush Dean’s cheek.  “Thank you for telling me,” is all he says.
Cas huffs, wiping blood from his collarbone  He feels a little dizzy and his neck is stinging, but it’s nothing that would land him in the hospital.  Dean yanks a bandana from his pocket and presses it to the wound, his other hand gripping Cas’s shoulder.
Finally, Dean slaps his hand lightly on the tabletop and announces he’s getting a drink from the kitchen.  He stands and asks if Sam wants one too.
She huffs to herself and carefully makes her way down the rocks, crouching low to keep from slipping and falling into the water.  There’s a dumpster at the edge of the park; she’ll toss the bag there.  It’ll head to a landfill but at least it won’t be poisoning the bay.  Hooking one gloved hand over a rock to stabilize herself, she reaches down and pulls the bag up out of the water with no small amount of effort.
When Cas opens his eyes again, he’s standing on the side of a road surrounded by towering coniferous forests.  It’s the middle of the night and he’s beneath a solitary lamp post, the only one in sight.  Overhead, the blackness glitters with the light of a million stars, the entire Milky Way splashed across the skies above.  To the east, the full moon is just rising from behind a distant mountain.  The air here is crisp and sweet, heavy with pine.
One is a brunette girl no older than five.  The other is a boy — dark-skinned, wide-eyed, and about seven years old.  And they’re
The night sky overhead is breathtaking, the moon shimmering against the surface of the water off the port bow.  The
As soon as the door to Cas’s bedroom closes behind them, Dean is pressed up against the door and Cas’s mouth finds his lips again.  Cas drags the kiss out of him with a moan, hands ghosting down to the small of Dean’s back and winding their way under his shirt.  Dean flinches at the caress, only because he’s not used to being touched there, caught off-balance and entirely focused on the way Cas is kissing him.  It seems now that Dean has put the key in the ignition, Cas is the one driving.
With his knee, Cas nudges Dean’s leg under the table.  “Of course.”
Cas, about to stand and collect the empty bottles for the trash, sits still again.  “Oh?  What’s that?”
“His name is Dean,” Eileen says.  Sam places his free hand on Cas’s shoulder.
Missouri purses her lips at him and crosses her arms over her chest.  “What, stealing food in the market wasn’t enough for you, boy?  Get your filthy hands off that bird!”
The three of them sit like that for hours, exchanging stories they’ve missed from both Heaven and Earth
“Dean, the last time you encountered one of these douens,” Castiel starts, panting as he hikes up the slope after them.  “How did it turn out?”
that morning.
“Do you know if he had any enemies?  Anyone who might have had beef with him?”
Holding Cas’s grace glowing in its hand, a lantern against the blackness, the Empty crushes it into nothingness.  The angelic glow disappears and dust pours from the Empty’s palm.

Dean looks at him askance.  “The what?”
“Then
“It’s one of the ways they fund the service.  People have to buy the purple bags in order to have their garbage collected.”
Garth doesn’t speak further.  Across the deck from him, Ash taps the base of his empty cup against the planks.

“Cas, you’ve been spun out for
Jack doesn’t contest the point, and somehow that hurts worse than anything else he might have said.  “Bringing people back, messing with the natural order, making exceptions just because we love someone
Dean is the one to come up for air first, pressing his forehead to Cas’s.  “Took you long enough,” he whispers with Cas’s palm on his cheek.
Sam only dismissively shakes his head and pulls out his phone to recheck the address of the resource center.
Nothing happens.
“Sounds like a plan,” Cas says, pulling Dean’s hand close to kiss his knuckles.
“You are an excellent father,” Cas says.  “I can’t say that I won’t miss hunting with you, and with Eileen.  But you’re doing the right thing for your family.  And I am proud of you.”
The girl only shrugs.  “Stupid or not, it’s the law.  If you have an issue with it, you’re welcome to take it up with the governor.”  Without leaving room for Dean to protest any further, she whisks off to another table.
“You’ve changed your mind.”
“Make good choices!” Sam calls as Dean reaches the landing.
“I think you’re forgetting that I volunteered,” Castiel retorts, raising an eyebrow at him.
Dean’s head turns suddenly and he touches Eileen’s shoulder in warning, pressing a finger to his lips.  Sam, alarmed, jumps down from the truck and takes his blade back from Eileen.  Cas sweeps the beam of his flashlight across the lot, searching for anything amiss.
Dean wakes up sometime in the early afternoon with his head full of static and an intense craving for coffee.  He rubs the gunk out of his eyes and shrugs on his robe, but once he sees the time on his alarm clock he thinks better of it and changes into real clothes.  He doesn’t bother with shoes, though – why should he?  There will be no cases today, no reasons to rush out of the bunker with no warning.  He leaves his room barefoot.
Cas lets out a breath, then uses his fork to push the rest of the slice back into the box.  “It doesn’t taste like anything at all.”
“Yeah, well, neither are you.”
break into pieces.
His heart is pounding so loudly in his ears that he almost doesn’t hear Dean come in.  The door opens and Dean leans in and Cas flinches, embarrassment shooting up his spine.
A huff of relief leaves Sam’s chest, the corners of his mouth twitching.  “You did, huh?”
On the deck below, he can see Dean.  Dean does not seem to have any particular specialty and instead alternates between jobs, sometimes vanishing into the hold for long stretches of time, sometimes climbing up the masts to work alongside him.  Dean is the same as Castiel — obviously a man raised on the water and in tune with the ship under his feet.  Castiel has a feeling that if the
He’s only a few steps away when he stops, feeling like his feet are glued to the floor.  He stares at the solid oak door.  His head is swimming.
“Jean-Luc?” asks Dean, already crawling forward over the bones.
Frank scoots his chair closer.  “What was it like?”
Castiel lets go of the bell rope and takes one sword from Dean.  “Hit them with the sharp end,” he says.
“Ugh,” says Dean.
Armed men pour up from the hold, swords glinting against the moonlight.  A dozen and a half men, Castiel included, and he has no idea if it will be enough.  Dean said there were more mermaids.  He did not say how
Eileen shrugs.  “Maybe if you put more effort into learning to sign, you wouldn’t miss things like that.”
“Whoa.”  Dean blinks, his brow furrowing as he tries to do the math.  “So that’s…”
“Are you still seeing Mia Vallens?” Sam asks abruptly, though he tries to keep his voice gentle.
Cas reluctantly agrees, and as soon as he does it feels right.  He tells himself that he’s not keeping the Impala for selfish reasons, that it’s only because it’s not a good car for a new family with a baby.
Breathless, Dean tries, but the words catch low in his throat.  Instead, he reaches out with one hand and fumbles for the pocket of the bathrobe until he manages to grab the small bottle of lube.  When he presses it into Cas’s palm, Cas’s eyes blow wide, darkening even in the dim lighting of the bedside lamp.
practically dances.  Castiel is able to feel the moves she’ll make before she makes them, allowing him to balance almost entirely hands-free.
He's too fast, gaining distance quickly despite their efforts, and they manage to just spot him as he leaps up onto the top of the fence at the edge of the lot, flipping easily over it and landing unharmed on the other side.  Without waiting to see if they'll follow him further, he darts into the woods beyond, and disappears from view.
“Then shouldn’t we have gone for help?  Maybe your father?”
Dean does insist on finishing his eggs and coffee, but once he’s done and Cas has changed into some more appropriate clothing, they head for the door.  Sam is unsurprisingly sitting at the library table with a book, searching for anything that might help defend them against Chuck.  He looks up when Dean and Cas walk through.
A blinding flash of light erupts from the rift, and suddenly Jack and Cas burst out of nothingness, falling hard onto the bunker floor.  The rift fizzles and dies behind them.
“So what’s up?” she says by way of greeting, reaching for another piece of fruit from Sam’s plate.
The girl screams, thrashing against the vines.
“Coroner was right,” he says, shoving Dean’s empty plate out of the way to lay the file open.  “This Fred Sargent guy has a long history of drug offenses.”
Only a moment later, Jack lets out an agonized yell and his body convulses, blinding golden light bursting from his eyes and nose and mouth.
He’s not sure how long he sits there in the quiet.  Dean doesn’t appear.
, releasing its hold on Frank at last.
“I’m going to go put these away.”  Cas smiles at Dean, like he knows exactly what he just did, and takes the bags of clothes from the table.
To distract himself, Dean unfurls the
“All right,” Sam nods.  “Eileen and I can take West Virginia, and you and Cas take Ohio.”
Sam stops short at that, rooted to the tiles under his shoes.  Donna only ever calls him ‘honey’ when something is wrong.  “Uh.  No?  He’s upstairs.”
Sam lets out a long breath, then comes over and sits beside him.  “Dean, what happened?”
“I’m Dean,” the man replies as he sets to untying the rope from around his own waist.  “Can you stand?”
“We have to burn them,” Garth says and then, when Castiel blinks in confusion, elaborates.  “If you don’t salt and burn a body, it runs the risk of turning into a vengeful spirit.”
“All right, what’s got your panties in a twist?” Dean eventually asks through a mouthful of chocolate cream pie.
They crash at a motel for the night and get started asking questions around town first thing the following morning.  Eileen has an impressive array of disguises on hand, even more so than Sam and Dean, and Cas is stunned when she steps out of the motel bathroom in a full police officer’s uniform.
“He just said Missouri was a friend.”
“Cas, no—” Jack tries to protest.
Dean shifts, averting, and wonders at how infuriatingly at ease Cas is with all of this.  “Well, mac and cheese is in the oven; it’ll be ready in a bit,” he says, for lack of a better line.  When he looks back up, Cas is still staring at him.  “What’re you looking at?”
Somehow.  Somehow.  He knows what she’s going to say before she says it.
it, Sam,” Dean spits, cursing Sam’s ability to move silently despite his ridiculous stature.  “Don’t scare a man before breakfast.  The hell’s wrong with you?”
Castiel grits his teeth, swings his knees round to brace his feet against the den on either side of Dean, and pulls as hard as he can.  Branches snap and break under his boots.  Dean growls, grits his teeth, uses Castiel as an anchor and kicks back with as much force as he can muster.
Cas doesn’t say it like a question, but Dean knows it is.  He’s quick to counter.  “No,” he insists.  “No.  No, it’s just… Fifteen minutes ago,
And then he’s gone, and Cas is holding nothing but air.
—” Dean chokes out, clinging to the door jamb.  “Oh my
They stand there for a little while, both to enjoy the last of their stolen lunch and to make sure the baker isn’t still chasing them.
“Hey,” says a soft voice to his left, and Sam turns to see Eileen leaning against the doorframe.  She holds up the Impala’s keys and jingles them with a twitch of her wrist.  “The car’s in the garage.  I guess Cas didn’t bring her to Colorado.”
Today is Thursday.  Reading.  Cas has spent a truly immeasurable percentage of his life reading, but never has he read anything for pleasure.  Reading means memorizing Bible verses.  Reading means the Word of God.  Reading means lore.  Reading means research.  Reading does not mean
“I’m sorry,” Cas repeats, turning to go.  “I’ll come back.  Tomorrow or something.”
“Nope,” he cuts Dean’s protest off.  “Bed.  Now.”
“Castiel,” he answers.  His throat is still hoarse; his name comes out a rasp.
“Sam, there are plenty of cars for me to use in the garage—”
“Sammy.”
She smiles.  “Mr. Winchester said you’d be coming in.  I can’t let you into the room right now, but you can have a seat.”  She points to a sitting area in the corner, with old magazines arranged neatly in a rack between a water cooler and a coin-operated Keurig machine.
Dean gets out of the car, shutting the door behind him.  He takes two steps, crossing the distance between them, and pulls Cas into a kiss.  Cas clings to Dean’s shirt, his hands digging into his shoulder blades as Dean’s fingers wind through his hair.
“Tell me what you want,” Cas repeats, teeth grazing Dean’s earlobe.
“So.”  Frank leans back, bracing his meaty hands on his hips.  “You’re the
Dean feels empty, but not unpleasantly so.  “Well, I’m gonna be sore tomorrow,” he remarks.
“Well, I think this calls for a beer,” Dean says.
Dean holds up a hand before Castiel can continue.  He just needs to speak uninterrupted, without Cas’s assumptions or protections.  “All I mean,” he says slowly, carefully, “is that I’ve never done this before.”  He meets Cas’s eyes again, and strangely feels safer.  “It’s going to take me a minute to think it through.”
“Which way now?” Dean prompts Frank, who’s scowling at the trees as he rotates in place like a mill wheel, sniffing every few seconds and trying to pin down the odor’s source.
Climbing up to the foredeck, he finds Dean sitting on the bowsprit, one leg hanging into the open air and the other propped up on the timber.  He’s leaning with his spine against the samson post, head tilted back, watching the stars.
The coral is
“I think that’s it,” Bobby says, surveying the damage.  “We got lucky.”
“...It’s 2:30am, Cas,” Sam states flatly.
It’s a stressful, violent,
Despite the early hour, it’s already a beautiful day, and the world is bursting – a riot of every color in Creation.  Cas almost misses his grace, only because as an angel he could see the vibrations of every atom in every tree, every bird and insect, every stone, and he was constantly witness to the divine energy that held this world together.  Now, though, he’s able to see the colors as a whole, the sweeping sum of every building block put together without the complex burden of seeing exactly how they fit.  It’s the way a human sees the world.  The way Dean sees it.
“We’re just going for a drive, okay?” Dean retorts flatly, annoyed.
“I found the place where it was dumped,” says Paradis, and presses
Sam is still here, Cas tries to remind himself.  And Eileen.  And Jody, Donna, Bobby… All the people that matter to Cas are still here, and Dean is the sole exception.
Castiel can’t help resenting the
talking about it is usually worse than the alternative.”
Dean flashes him a lopsided grin, hoping it’s enough to put Cas at ease.  “Little late for that now, don’t you think?”
Dean shakes his head, but only slightly, and makes a noncommittal noise in his throat.  “He just wants to make sure nothing happens to me is all.  He wasn’t wrong; running off into the woods without getting help was stupid.”
It’s even later in the night, so late that the hospital cafeteria has started serving breakfast, when Cas and Sam find themselves sitting on a bench outside underneath the stars.  Eileen is getting some well-earned sleep with Dean in the bassinet beside her, and the sky over the horizon is just beginning to lighten.
“Mom I saw once, at the Roadhouse,” Dean says, scratching idly behind his ear.  “Haven’t seen Dad since… since the Baozhu.”
– and realization clears his face.  He’s doing this for Cas.  Sam doubts the idea would have even occurred to Dean otherwise.
Cas grits his teeth, knuckles white around the steering wheel.  This isn’t enough.
Donna stops short, her victorious grin fading.  Claire is staring at him, eyes wide, her expression melting from ferocity to terror.
Dean doesn’t stir.
In the kitchen, there are still dishes in the sink.  The trash is a few days old and halfway full of empty Chinese takeout boxes.  A few empty beer bottles sit on the counter.  It’s a small mess, left behind with a clear intention to clean it up soon.
Sam wonders if Cas ever wants to take him up on it now.
Cas doesn’t respond directly, nor does he look away.  He shrugs one shoulder and asks, “Does it make you uncomfortable?”
“He almost died,” Dean protests.  “Surely that means—”
“I don’t want to hear some trite speech about how there’s beauty everywhere,” Cas interrupts him, crossing his arms over his chest.
eating people, she wouldn’t have gone to the trouble to dispose of her victims in trash bags.  This is still a vamp case.”
Still nothing.
His heart drops straight into his stomach.
Cas presses his palms over his face, unable to take in the sight of Dean lying dead at his feet.  His lungs are fighting to breathe, gasping unevenly as he cries into his hands.
Castiel blinks, confusion finally outweighing his sense of propriety as he blurts out, “How does everybody here know me?”
Dean has fully lost it, sinking onto the step down into the TV room, tears streaming down his reddened face as he laughs too hard to talk.  “Shit, my
isn’t going to fit in Castiel’s bedroom.
“Two more here,” Dean adds, tapping his finger on the front of his notepad.
Frank drops himself into a chair opposite, placing his pistol on the table with its nose pointing at Castiel.  Still, his hand is no longer on the gun, so Castiel supposes it’s an improvement.
The island is not sinking, Castiel realizes as they whirl helplessly in the dinghy.  It is diving.
Sam frowns at him.  “You know?”
Cas scrapes a hand over his face, more exhausted now than when he went to bed the evening before.  “What are you doing?”
Patience crosses her arms with a smile that might be described as smug.  “How did it go?”
Dean’s eyebrows shoot toward his hairline.  “...Is that a lead?  Do we think these people were killed by an actual snake?”
“Is that everything?” Dean prompts.  “Everything that’s bothering you.”
With a pointed look at Frank, Missouri ushers Dean through a doorway into the back of the house, leaving Castiel standing awkwardly in the kitchen under Frank’s scrutiny.
“Castiel.  You
“You good?” comes Dean’s voice from behind him, and he feels Dean’s hand tap the ankle of his boot.
Cas lets out a short, muffled noise of surprise.  He freezes for only the briefest of seconds.  Sudsy water splatters onto the floor, soaking into Dean’s shirt as Cas’s hands find his hips.
Inside, he can hear a cacophony of shrieks and yelps as the douens burn.
In the chaos of the mermaid attack, Dean dove headfirst into the action with no hesitation and a willingness to shed blood.  After the aspidochelone had left nothing but death and destruction in its wake, Dean was steadfast, a calming voice while Castiel reeled from the loss of everything he’d known.
“We figured you’d earned it after surviving your first mermaid attack,” Dean says with a smirk.  “Come on, let’s go.”
Cas’s body is a smashed, broken thing, limbs at all the wrong angles and the back of his head caved in.  Blood has dried in rivulets from his nose and ears.  A fractured bone protrudes from his arm.  It takes Sam a moment to spot the bullet wound in his chest
, jerking back so violently that he falls straight off the edge of the bed.
“Three,” Garth interjects from where he’s dragging a dead mermaid past them.  “The sword-throwing was impressive.”
Dean doesn’t answer immediately.  He meets Castiel’s eye over his shoulder briefly, then returns his gaze to the sky.  “Fine,” he says.
There’s only a moment of hesitation before Jack tilts his head back and swallows the mug’s contents in one swig.  He makes a face, gritting his teeth as it works its way down his esophagus.
ago, he still wasn’t sure if he wanted this.
“You bet,” Sam agrees, and descends to the driveway.  He doesn’t say goodbye.  He doesn’t need to.
As the town vanishes completely behind them, Castiel keeps his eyes trained on Dean’s back.  It would have a certain poetic irony, he thinks, if he survived an enormous sea monster and a vicious pack of mermaids and then died from simply getting lost in the woods only a few days later.
He thinks her gas pedal might have cut the bare sole of his foot, but it doesn’t bother him enough to stop.
Cas blinks slowly, not quite shaken out of his trance.  He’s got deep circles under his eyes and he hasn’t shaved.  Sam is sure he doesn’t look much better himself, but seeing Cas in this state is profoundly disturbing.  Cas looks down at the plate in his hand with an expression like he’s getting ready to jump off a cliff.
,” Feliciana whispers, shaking, her fingers digging into Castiel’s shoulders.
’s bow, a lush green island rises up out of the sea, steep cliffs and dense forest.  They’re coming up on an inlet, where the sharp drops of mountains give way to gentler foothills and, nestled as far into the cove as possible, a sprawling town and bustling harbor.  Ships of every kind and every size come and go, sailing past the
“Is there anything you’d like to do before you go?” Jack offers.
The journey home is dark and silent.  Sam doesn’t speak, his hands white-knuckled around the steering wheel.  Cas stares out the window and watches the sun rise as they navigate the highway back to Kansas, the sky rolling from black to pink.  Somewhere behind them, Eileen is following in the Valiant, a pair of headlights over their shoulders.
“Too soon?” Sam asks.
“Mom and Dad?”
Dean blinks, his jaw closing.
Lilah crosses her arms, making a show of being patient.  “What kind?”
Moonlight is thrown across the hallway, slatted through the window blinds.  Sam’s bare feet cross the carpeted floor to Dean’s room.  He pokes his head through the door and finds Dean starfished in his bed, illuminated by the Spongebob-shaped night light plugged into the wall, pajamas bottoms pushed halfway up his legs.  Sam lets out a small breath of relief
“No, that’s not—” Dean shakes his head.  “I didn’t mean to… This isn’t your fault.”  He swallows, chastising himself for making it sound like there’s any blame to be had.  “I’m glad you told me.”
They both end up dozing, however, slouching with their heads resting on their arms on the library table.  It’s not deep or restful, but it does help.
They meet Donna in Denver and visit the coroner’s office to find that there have been six bodies discovered over the course of a few months.  The Denver police think it’s the work of a serial killer, or maybe a local cult.  When the coroner yanks the sheet back from one of the corpses, Donna winces.
In the gleam of their flashlights, the stranger's eyes glow a menacing yellow, huge teeth bared.
“In the woods.  Gotta be.  Douens are forest dwellers; they only come into towns and villages to hunt.”  Dean runs his fingers through his hair, sweat beading on his temples.  “I guarantee there’s more kids missing than just Jean-Luc.  He’s seven years old, right?”
“The federal government isn’t required to protect the privacy of dead men,” Dean snaps, far too tired to be patient.  “Did he get treated here or not?”
“So it’s just you and me, then,” Cas says, propping an elbow on the tabletop to rest his chin in his palm.  He gazes at Dean from where he sits, unwavering.
“Yeah.”
“Okay, then,” says Eileen with a tilt of her head.  “Sharpen the machetes.”
“Uh… no?  Your menu says you serve beer, and I’d like one.  What’s the big deal?”
Dean clears his throat, and inelegantly stammers, “Be good, kid.”
Cas smiles.  “Thank you, Sam.  I’m sure it will.”
Sam leans over and kisses her forehead, then gently lifts the bundle from her arms.  “Cas,” he says, his chest swelling with pride.  “Meet your godson.”
and shakes her head.  “Marie Helene says someone keeps doing that.  Without the garden they don’t have enough to feed all five of them.”
And as for their time between cases, spent at home in the bunker, Dean seems to think Sam doesn’t notice the changes.
“It’s been good to see you, dear,” Missouri tells him, patting his shoulder.  When he stands back, she squeezes his arm in a comforting gesture, and he smiles tightly in return.
This is another tradition, Castiel realizes.  Another routine, well-practiced and frequently performed.
Lilah nods, gazing down at the card in her palm for a moment before tucking it into her back pocket.  “Sorry, were you going to order anything else?”
Instead, the den is
” Dean shouts as he leaps out of his hiding place further down the alley.
“Yeah.  I mean, if you want.  It’s not like Cas has any experience with writing a CV.”
Cas is quiet for a moment, his thumb rubbing over Dean’s forefinger.  “Do you think Sam and Eileen deserve to be happy?” he asks, and it’s enough of a change in subject matter to make Dean blink and frown, shaken momentarily from his inward-facing criticisms.
At that, Sam laughs too, his breath fogging in the chill.  “No.”
This is a Dean unburdened.
“Castiel is not a part of our crew, and you should have been smart enough to not subject him to this,” the captain retorts, seething.  “And as for Frank, he is well past his prime.  To consider him an appropriate substitute is irresponsible at best.”
It’s not long before the forest gives way at last and the lights of the town reach them, and Castiel finds himself marching through the orchard between Dean and Bobby, Feliciana still clutched in his arms.  Jean-Luc, who had been dozing off on Dean’s shoulder for the majority of the trek, is now alert and squirming.
see they’re no longer there.  There’s something different in the way Cas’s body stands now, like his center of gravity has changed.
It doesn’t help, not really, but at least Cas doesn’t have to deal as often with their looks of concern, silently exchanged when they think he can’t see them.  And he doesn’t have angel hearing any longer, but his hearing is still better than most people’s.  So when Sam says
“What is
Cas is still standing at the sink, hands submerged in the dishwater, apparently completely ignorant of the fact that Dean is now flat-out staring at his back.  Dean had never been able to see Cas’s wings before, but mystifyingly, he
“I had an appointment with Mia last week,” Cas finally says softly, his gaze staring somewhere over Sam’s shoulder.  “I drove up to meet with her in person.”
“Dean, relax,” Jack says, in an oddly parental tone.
With one last horrible smile, Dean’s face finally disappears and Meg takes his place.  The Empty laughs in Meg’s voice now, musically, somehow melodic and screeching at the same time.  “Finally,” it squeaks, practically dancing from foot to foot.  “Peace!  I will have peace.”
resupplying and the like
The pain only seems to last a few moments, however.  The light fades and leaves Jack breathing hard with his eyes still glowing amber.  The cut on his hand is already gone.
Cas sighs, looking up at the high ceilings, and a smile drifts over his face.  “This is my home.  I could never leave, even if I wanted to.”
“Almost ten.  Cas… have you been sleeping out here?”
the time, I don’t know when is,” he snaps.
“Be cheaper to get one room,” Sam remarks as he pulls out his phone, already searching for lodging options.
Castiel is lightheaded suddenly, and he sits on the lowest step descending from the deck.  “I… I saw an eye,” he says, breathless.  “A huge eye.  It was the biggest thing I’ve ever seen.  Some kind of – of creature, some monster—  Oh
Jack nods once, and suddenly they’re in Sam and Eileen’s back yard outside of Kansas City.  Sam, Eileen, and Dean are playing soccer together, laughing and running.  They don’t know that Cas is dead; they haven’t gotten that call yet.  Miracle, old and riddled with arthritis, lays contentedly on the porch as they play.
Castiel tenses immediately, taking a step back.  “She’s a monster?”
The fourteen-hour drive home to Lebanon is quiet, this time uncomfortably so.  Dean doesn’t turn on his music and Cas sulks, knowing his bad attitude is poisoning the air, infecting Dean, and decides he’ll probably sleep in his own room when they get home.  It’ll be a good idea to sequester himself away where he can’t snap at anybody for a little while.
“It’s just healing is all,” Castiel brushes him off.  He stands at last, stretching the kinks from his neck.  "Feels worse than it is."
“Wow, he conked out fast,” is all Sam can say.  “He usually makes it at least to the castle storming.”
Ishim huffs in annoyance, much more focused on the task of finding water than anything Inias might have been distracted by.  But he stops along with Castiel, the both of them following Inias away from the ocean to see what he’s found.
“I’m just saying,” Sam continues as he watches an unkempt woman walk past, talking nonstop to herself.  “There are more than I’d expect for a city this size.  If something is really targeting the homeless population, that’s a big pool to fish from, and it’d be hard to spot.  It’s not like anybody’s keeping track.”
“Jesus,” says Dean, and Eileen can’t say she disagrees.
“I’ve got Bucky over here,” says Garth, fighting tears as he rolls over the body of a redheaded man with half his innards spilled in ropes across the planks.  Garth sniffs and wipes his eyes on his sleeve.
It takes the rest of the day to track the wolf pack to a junkyard just outside the town perimeter, where scrapped cars sit in rusty stacks behind a chain link fence.  Just after sunset, Cas and Eileen break in armed to the teeth – silver bullets in their guns and silver knives strapped to their ankles and tucked into their sleeves.  Eileen uses a small pair of wire cutters to cut through the fence, letting Cas wriggle through ahead of her.  Methodically, they comb through the junkyard with their guns at the ready.
“You’re lucky you can’t hear yourself,” he mutters grumpily as he lets his head fall back onto the pillow.
He’s said those exact words to Cas at least a dozen times since his return from the Empty.  Cas is waiting, because Dean told him to.
The message is immediately followed by the address of a diner on the Peninsula.
“How’s it going on your end?”
Gagnon shakes his head, bracing his hands on his pudgy hips.  “I heard the Coast Guard’s on alert just in case, but there’s really not much they can do otherwise,” he explains.  “Given the currents, the depth, the temperature… Not to mention the wildlife — practically everything that lives in the Gulf is a scavenger in one way or another.  I’m amazed even one bag was found.”
By contrast, Cas is unwilling to push Dean away just in the interest of maintaining whatever secret they think they’re keeping.  His palm stays on Dean’s head and he rests his chin in his other hand, propped on the arm of the couch, and easily meets Sam’s eye.  There’s no defiance in his expression, no

One would have to be insane, really, to want to go running in November in Maine.
,” she sobs.  “
They take two cars, and Cas is grateful.  Sam and Eileen take the Valiant and lead the way, letting Dean and Cas follow in the Impala.  Dean doesn’t mind a drive lacking in conversation, provided there’s music, but he does look at Cas a bit strangely when he turns the volume up on the Bob Seger tape before Dean has a chance to do the same.
Tortuga is crowded and chaotic.  It’s loud.  And it’s smelly.
He thinks, as he drops the dishes in the kitchen, that he can’t quite picture Dean in anything like a real job.  Punching a clock, paying taxes, filing for health insurance… none of that lines up with who Dean is, who Dean’s always been.  And Dean didn’t even
With his heart thudding so loudly that Dean is sure it’s audible several rooms away, Dean realizes that the only thing he really wants at this exact moment is to talk to Cas.  Or maybe not even to talk.  Just to see him.  He’s sure that once he sees Cas, all of this will make sense.
Castiel’s heart is thudding away in his ribcage, confusion clawing at his brain, when Dean’s eyes flicker toward the water.  He takes his hand away from Castiel’s mouth and points to where the bow is cutting through the waves.
Cas is the one who speaks first.  “Dean, I want you to know that I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable,” he says, watching the river.  “I know that you don’t feel the same way I do, and I’m okay with that.  I have no interest in pressuring you for anything.”
“I figure we head to the sanitation department lot tomorrow morning when it opens,” Paradis suggests.  “We can track down which crew uses that truck every week.  I’m willing to bet there’s more people missing than just Fred.”
“Come on,” Dean says again, reaching for Cas’s hand.  “Let’s go home.”
Jack purses his mouth for a moment, then turns and opens his door, stepping out of the car.  “Come here,” he says.
The King’s Head is halfway down the pier, hidden in the flank of a brick office building.  Inside is a huge U-shaped bar staffed by a pretty redhead and a handful of smaller tables, the only other patrons a couple of retirees at the far end of the bar.  A massive stag’s head is mounted on the wall, antlers adorned with a short string of lights.
Castiel sputters, dripping anew.  “Damn you, I’ve already drowned today!”
“Castiel!” comes a shout from the port gunwale.
Dean peers more closely at Cas’s still-bleeding neck.  “Cas, you might need stitches.  We should get you to a hospital.”
The exchange is silent, but Dean notices from his spot next to Eileen and spits, “Will you two quit talking about me right in front of me?  Jesus.”
a name he recognizes from the early 20th-century Men of Letters roster.  Sam sets the book back on the desk, wondering if Cas had been reading it for a case or just out of curiosity.
It’s only then that Dean sees that Cas is bleeding –
Castiel can’t hold his tongue, and cuts in sharply.  “Are you forgetting that we managed to rescue these kids
Sam is sprawled out on the couch in the TV room, deep in a rewatch of the entire Tarantino canon with Eileen’s feet propped on his lap, and that’s where Dean leaves them as he pushes Cas out the door.
Somehow, Castiel understands what Dean’s trying to do, and in unison they seize Frank from the front and slam him down onto the ground, crunching the douen underneath.  There’s a loud
“No.”
Patience straightens her shoulders, focusing intently on the sweet potatoes she’s skinning.  “Anyways.  Now, we help the
Castiel’s blood runs cold, realizing for the first time that they hadn’t seen the douen with the broken arm anywhere in the den.
Castiel doesn’t hesitate to ask, “How do we find him?”
“Yeah,” he grunts, pulling himself through and into the heart of the den.
“I just…” Dean clamps his lips shut, his thoughts bottlenecking.  “Did you only say that stuff because we were about to die?”  For the first time since leaving the bunker, Dean actually meets Castiel’s gaze.
Dean immediately yanks his hands away from Cas, and Cas clears his throat and straightens his shirt.
And as for giving Jack his own Sword, there’s no precedent.  Jack is not an archangel.  There is no rulebook for nephilims, or for turning the body a nephilim already has into a Sword.  The ritual could go smoothly and this time tomorrow Cas might be back like nothing had happened, sipping beer at the table in the library.  Or it could have unforeseen consequences, and Jack could explode from the sheer amount of power he’ll be taking in, combining archangel grace with a true vessel, Dreamwalking,
’s crew where it is?”
“Why are we visiting her home if the boy was taken from the market?” asks Castiel, not entirely sure he wants to set foot in Marie Helene’s house for fear the roof collapses on them.
“Cas can handle it!” Dean argues, and Castiel’s stomach clenches.  “He
Dean feels cold suddenly – not on his skin but inside, all the way down to his core.  “You know there’s no way to get him back,” he says.  “Billie’s gone too.  Chuck’s the only one left and even if he wanted to help, he doesn’t have sway with the Empty.”
“Yeah, douens feed on kids,” Dean explains.  “Sometimes a dozen at a time.  They stalk them, raid the nearby gardens, and lure the kids to their den."
Gagnon pulls a pair of latex gloves onto his hands and picks up the severed forearm, turning it over so the wrist is facing up toward the ceiling.  A tattoo is inked into the skin there.  It’s nothing particularly unusual, just a pair of rifles crossed over an American flag.  Further up the arm, closer to where the elbow would have been, are several scarred-over pinpricks of varying ages, left over from a needle routinely jabbing the vein.
“I can do it, Dean,” Cas says snippily.  He takes the bandana from Dean and leaves no room for protest.
“Remember, shooting them will slow them down,” Cas says as they sneak into the building.
Sam rolls down his window, letting the pine-scented air fill his chest.  It’s a minute or two before the
from his shoulder to his flank.  “Cas.”
Castiel gapes at him.  “Did you steal that while we were running?”
and the isle, gone.
easy.
himself to fall asleep.
“There was no point in talking about it unless I got the job,” Dean says defensively, tossing the now-empty paper plate back into the sample box.
The body changes then, turning black and amorphous for a moment before taking Duma’s face.  “Two days and forever are hardly the same thing,” it snarls, its voice now high-pitched and tinkling.
“I could go with Sam instead,” Cas suggests.
Above them, limbs are unfolding from every hidden crevice.
There are no paths cutting through the trees, and it’s slow going.  Frank also picked up a large machete from his house and now he leads the way, slicing and chopping through vines and shrubs and branches, turning this way and that as he follows the creature’s course.
“That is not your call to make!”
“You say that like we didn’t just spend the
She casts an odd look in Cas’s direction, but doesn’t confirm whether she heard him or not as she sets the glasses on the table.  “Let me know how you like that,” she tells Dean and leaves again just as swiftly.
“Oh, yeah?”  Frank’s tone is unsympathetically light, as though he thinks Castiel isn’t telling the truth.  “What sank your ship?”
His car keys are already in hand, but Cas brightens at the invite.  Color finds him again in the sunrise filling the kitchen.
minute? hour? Castiel has no idea
Eileen agrees, crossing her arms over her chest to preserve her body heat.  “That’s probably true.”
“This is my partner, Agent Byrne,” Sam introduces Dean, then gestures to Cas and Eileen.  “And this is Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison.  They’re civilian consultants with our branch.”
Castiel stares at him for a moment, then snorts.
Dean gives Castiel a measured look, then shakes his head.  “Cas, I know you have to go,” he says.  “I’m sorry, I know I said I’d help you find a ship.  You don’t need to be a part of this.  If you could just find someone from the crew and tell them what’s happening, send them back here—”
The kiss is deep, like Cas has been wanting to do this all fucking day, and Dean can relate.  He lets his grip migrate down, tugging Cas closer by his hips.
is coursing steadily west-southwest, sails full, and the island comes arching out of the horizon right in their path where the captain’s chart says there should be only open water.  A shout of “
“Stop it.  Would you just come back over here?  You’re making me nervous.”
“You are?”
Castiel knows how a well-run ship should feel beneath him when he’s up in the air, with only the ropes and yardarms separating him from a long drop into the water.  In the hands of an inexperienced helmsman, even the most well-built vessel will buck and slap ungracefully against the waves, coming dangerously close to throwing anybody in the masts overboard.  But with Mr. Singer at the wheel, the
The full realization of the last
that’s all gone, left behind at the mark of Dean’s death.  The fear, the self-loathing, the loud male bravado Dean buried himself under his entire life has melted away.  All the terrible things they went through on Earth are still there, they still happened, but the memories are confined to just that: memories.  And Heaven isn’t built out of memories any longer.
for as long as he has or longer — and their cries are the loudest thing Castiel has ever heard.
“Ooh, fun,” she coos through a mouthful of cantaloupe.  She skims the headline and hands the tablet back to him.  “I’m game.”
is it helping?”  Sam isn’t sure if he should be asking Cas about therapy, or if Cas is comfortable discussing it with him, but showing up at 2:30am in a panic because of an unspooled mixtape isn’t exactly a picture of perfect mental health.  He hasn’t seen Cas have a bad day like this in a long time.
“Well, the police did say it was used as a shelter more often than not,” Sam replies before approaching the front desk.
When she enters, she greets Castiel with only a “Hello” and heaves the basket onto the end of the table.  She doesn’t look surprised in the slightest to find a stranger sitting at the table, and instead drops a bunch of carrots in front of Frank.  “Go on, peel those, make yourself useful,” she tells him.
sweltering, humid, cicada-filled and breezy.  He’s seventy-three and he’s already lived twice as long as he expected.  His son is holding his hand.
He clears his throat, staring down at the nondescript label on the bottle.  “Wow.”
Cas nods, almost to himself.  “They deserve every happiness,” he says in agreement, squeezing Dean’s fingers.  “Which begs the question, why don’t you think
Really, Dean should be urging Cas back into the car so they can return home and get back to work.  He knows that Sam and Jack are going through every book and artefact in the bunker, and that just the two of them isn’t enough.  Time is not on their side, and there’s nobody left to help, so it’s all hands on deck.  After all, Chuck will not wait for them to be ready.
Patience giggles airily.
that he has to introduce his son to death so soon.
Dean clears his throat, chewing his eggs for a little too long.  He forces a shrug.  “Chuck’s still after us, but other than that, I’m good,” he says, falsely light.  “Just glad to have you back, man.”
“This is Heaven,” Sam says. “Aren’t they all good?”
Castiel shudders at the thought of what an attack on an unprepared vessel would look like.  He clears his throat and holds the cutlass out toward Dean.  “I imagine you want this back.”
Castiel makes a face.  “So ghosts are real too?”
Mr. Singer crosses his arms, having tucked his knife back into his belt.  “Well, you’re a scrawny thing, but we can always use another hand.”  He turns to Dean.  “Get him some food, show him his quarters.”
Two days later, Sam walks into the bunker kitchen, hoping for a beer.  He can’t remember the last time he was hungry for anything that wasn’t a numbing agent.  He has no idea what time of day it is, but checking the clock is low on his list of priorities.  Honestly, at this point it’s a miracle he’s even showered and dressed.  The smell of the burning pyre still lingers in his nose, even thirty-six hours after the fact.
They do eventually find something – or rather, more than one thing.  It takes a day and a half with no sleep, no showers, and very little food.  Dean feels more than a little useless, barely able to concentrate on the books.  His mind keeps wandering back to the dungeon, back to Cas strong-arming him out of the way and back to Cas’s face as the Empty pulled him into the black.  So unsurprisingly, Sam and Jack are the ones who find the solution.
He can’t talk.  He can’t talk, he can’t breathe, he can’t even look Dean in the fucking eye.
As Jack slices the palm of his hand and lets his blood drip into the boiling vat, Dean paces.
He’s used to this — to partners using him to get off however they want.  He’s okay with it, really; he even prefers it.  The burden of choice, of ordering around another person, is squarely in the other’s lap and it lets Dean just go along for the ride.  His highest highs have invariably been at another’s direction.  He’s always taken pleasure in making others happy, in doing whatever they want, and it’s always better when he knows they won’t leave in the morning.  Cas won’t leave in the morning.
They find the Nachzehrer nest two days later in a condemned ten-story factory building in an industrial area of Denver – the closest thing to an isolated cave or abandoned farm to be found in the city.  They’ve stopped at a bank for some change and are now armed with pennies and machetes.  They have no way of knowing which Nachzehrer is the alpha, so they’re going to take a trial-and-error approach.
Eileen glances at Dean for a second and then suggests that she and Cas pair up instead.  “Cas and I can handle Parkersburg.”
And so, nearly two weeks after Chuck’s demotion, Dean can’t take it anymore.
“Meaning?” Sam prompts.
” they sing, the words vibrating out across the deck and over the water into the dark.  “
He cracks a tiny, lopsided smile.  “You know, Billie called me ‘human disorder incarnate’.”
This particular morning is promising to be no different, the southeastern sun just beginning to spill pink and golden over the Portland skyline across the harbor from where Tallie stands.  Her cheeks are flushed and her breath crystallizes in front of her nose, her chest still heaving from her two-mile route.  She crooks her arm to check the weather app on her phone — twenty degrees with the windchill.  Clear skies and a high of thirty-one predicted for today.  Maybe she can take the kids to the park after she gets home from work.
And comprehension shocks deep into Sam’s core.  He knows what’s different about Dean here.
But none of those things happen, and Dean forces his eyes shut again.
.  Bags under his eyes, hair barely combed, posture terrible.
he’s an idiot.  Dean’s body was burned.  So the only way he could stay is by attaching himself to an object.  And the only object to which Dean would attach himself
He doesn’t reply honestly.  He doesn’t say that he’s overjoyed that Claire is making a good life for herself, or that seeing her is always hard because he knows what he took from her.  He doesn’t say that he doesn’t want to intrude on her time exploring independence and adulthood, or her time with Kaia.  He doesn’t say that he misses her.  Instead, he just nods and says, “Maybe.”
Cas blinks back tears.  He’s not sad, not at all.  He’s blissfully overwhelmed.  And he’s missed Jack so, so much.
now that he’s not an angel anymore.  Or maybe Dean’s imagining that.
Cas studies his face, blue eyes evaluating but not probing.  “Is it because this is your first time with a man?”
And then Sam’s piss-poor Austrian accent is back.  “That’s a
“Yes,” Jack says with a wince and steam coming out of his mouth.  “It doesn’t hurt.”
“No!” Dean says, quickly putting out an arm to stop him.  “If the kid’s still alive in there, we can’t risk collapsing the whole thing.”
She shudders underneath him, her engine roaring like she’s shouting for joy.  Cas’s bare feet work the pedals
When they finish loading up the car, the cache of weapons in the Impala’s trunk is completely buried under a rustling layer of plastic bags.  Cas shuts the trunk and, in a moment of sudden swooping courage, Dean glances around the parking lot and kisses Cas on the mouth.
Back in the clinic lobby, Robin is no longer sitting at the desk.  Instead, they’re over in the corner on one of the big squashy chairs, talking quietly with a twitchy man whose skin is pockmarked with sores.  The man is upset about something, beginning to cry, and Robin leans forward and gives him a solid hug.
Eileen helps Sam tie the shroud.
After barely half an hour, they’re forced to stop and rest, partly to give Dean’s arms a break from carrying Jean-Luc and partly to give Frank time to make a torch with his firestarter.
He huffs, turning over and gazing at the crack of light under his door from the hallway.  With nothing else pressing, nothing else breathing down his neck, his mind wanders unchecked back to the bridge.  Back to Cas’s face, smiling in the sun.
She shrugs noncommittally.  “Nobody ever said telling the future was straightforward,” she says, bracing her hands on her hips.  “Could mean anything.”
Something in Castiel’s gut tightens at the way Dean says it, hurt.  It’s what he wants, to leave and find passage to Havana, to find some other honest work aboard another merchant ship, to return to his life.  But everything feels different, as though some compass inside Castiel’s chest has been knocked out of place.  He shakes his head, ridding himself of the notion that he’s heading in the wrong direction.
Lilah heads back to the bar to get their bill from the register, and Dean turns to Sam.  “What, not even a
Cas is familiar with Dean’s sleep patterns, has watched over him more than enough times to know what Dean’s bad dreams look like, and he has no intention of letting Dean’s nightmare continue.  “Dean,” he says, more firmly, rubbing a palm up and down Dean’s bicep.  When that doesn’t work, Cas resorts to giving Dean a solid shake.  “Dean!  Wake up.”
” Dean sings.  His eyes close briefly, like he’s forgetting the rest of the men are even present.  “
Suddenly Dean is hyperventilating, gasping for air until his hands tingle with oxygen.  Cas is gone.  And Dean cannot reconcile that – or anything Cas said in the moments before – with the life he was living up until a few minutes ago.
It’s then that Cas reaches down between them, lines himself up and slides inside slowly.  Dean arches up against him, pressing his face into Cas’s neck and locking his arms around Cas’s shoulders.  Dean’s mouth falls open, breath hot against Cas’s chest, reveling in the stretch and slow burn as Cas drives into him.
“He’s not here, Cas,” Jack says, as gently as is possible for a thing like him.  He pulls his knees up, looking incongruously like a child again.  “He’s in Heaven.”
“Easy there, sailor,” says a voice above him.
Dean returns from below, two blades in hand, and rushes back up to the foredeck.  “I hope you know how to use a sword.”
“We don’t want you to be alone,” Eileen adds, her index finger turned upward and pressed to her heart.  But Cas won’t hear it.
,” it hisses.  “There is only one way to ensure I never have to hear from you again.  I’ll force you to go somewhere else.”
Missouri braces a hand against the door jamb, closing her eyes and bowing her head.  She breathes slowly and deeply.  “The creature hasn’t been in the house,” she says, her eyes still closed.  “But it’s been outside many times, feeding from the garden.  Spying on the children.”  She shudders.
“Something like that,” is all Sam will say.  “We’re just helping out the local authorities.”
Cas turns, and joy bursts forth from his chest so intensely that he’s sure he’s glowing.  Jack is standing beside him, as youthful as the day he left.  “Jack!” Cas cries, and engulfs him in a hug.
Dean lifts Jean-Luc back up off the ground and, together, he and Castiel fall in step behind Frank.
And then, as easily as he’d inflicted any variety of torture, Alastair pulls Dean close, into a firm embrace.  And it’s been thirty years.  It’s been thirty
Only a moment later, there’s a shout from outside.  “
“I’ll be right there,” Cas turns back toward the garden, speaking over his shoulder.  “I’m just going to put my tools away.”
for the two of them, but Jack immediately throws up his hand and yells for Dean to stop.  Sam grabs Dean’s arm.
Somewhere behind him, the juvenile douens are clawing at Dean’s legs, dragging him, screaming an overlapping chorus of “
A breath shudders out of Dean’s body like a ghost escaping him, and for a second Castiel thinks he might collapse.  Castiel stands back up from where the douen sent him into the dirt, brushing woody debris from his knees and elbows.  Frank leans on a tree for support as he tries to catch his breath.
“We didn’t have enough time,” Cas whispers.  He winds a hand into Dean’s hair, pulling him closer, trying to keep the warmth from leaving his body.  He doesn’t – can’t – look at Dean’s face.  Not like this.
It’s above the line of his collar, too, so he can’t even really hide it.  Every time he looks in the mirror, the scar will be there.  Nothing he can do will get rid of it.
Dean watches with his heart in his throat and nausea tugging at his gut.
The girl blinks and, after a moment, answers.  “Feliciana.”
Instantly, Dean’s posture changes.  Still tense, still rigid, but now on guard with his eyes scanning the trees.  Castiel draws the knife from his belt as they climb over a ridge and the ground evens out, the vegetation growing just sparsely enough here to almost be a clearing.  He can’t smell anything, but that’s what Frank is here for, he supposes.
For a moment, Castiel turns this over in his head, lets it sink in.  “When it said your name.  That was your mother’s voice.”
Cas wants to vomit.  Eileen is right; whatever object has impaled Dean is literally hooked into him, and they can’t just pull him forward.  At her direction, Cas nudges his shoulder underneath Dean’s left arm while Eileen does the same on the right, and together they push upward.
A second later, Dean is yanked backward.  He nearly loses his grip on Castiel’s hands.
There’s no time to argue.  From above, more than a dozen douens are scuttling down, skittering, hissing, branches cracking as they head for the invaders of their nest.
, sleek, the fastest ship he’s ever been on.  The wood of her hull is a dark-colored elm, stained black by years of soaking, and she cuts through waves like a hot knife through butter.
Castiel watches the sun glimmer, its light fractured across the ocean like a shattered church window.  “Why not tell people?”
“Maybe they left.”
glad that Cas seems to have done away with the suit and trench coat.  Under only a white t-shirt and a layer of flannel (in true hunter fashion), Cas feels abundantly more accessible.
few days.
men are buried at sea all the time, so there’s no reason Castiel can think of to have kept the corpses for an actual, literal burial.
Castiel leans against the mainmast, arms crossed against the coolness of the night.  “What if I were to stay?”
, he beckons.  A palm on Dean’s neck.
He closes his bedroom door and swings by the TV room, where Sam and Eileen are still on the couch.  Now, though, Eileen is snoring on Sam’s shoulder with his long arm draped around her like the safety bar on a roller coaster.  Sam is awake, feet on the coffee table, fully enthralled by the movie.  On the floor in front of the TV is Miracle, sleeping with his tongue out and his paws twitching in a dream.
Dean sits on a nearby crate and removes his boot, then rolls up his trouser leg to expose the bite on his calf.  He squints at the wound as he takes the damp cloth from Castiel’s hand and begins to clean it.
“Well, don’t keep us all in suspense,” Frank snaps.
Castiel nods.  “It was a nest of them.”
Here and now, aboard the
As they squeeze back out of the tiny office into the larger main room of the station, Sam asks another question.  “What happens if someone reports a homeless person as missing?”
Cas picks up the box and drops it into the trash can.  He doesn’t say anything else.
Frank holds his torch as high as he can, waving it back and forth.  “Over here!” he bellows.
Sorrow clouds Jack’s features, his Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat.  “Nothing,” he says.  “I won’t stop you, if that’s your decision.  But I don’t think it’s the right one.”
obvious hard-on, it’s too much.  Something akin to panic surges up from his gut.
The nest is small – only four Nachzehrers.  While the others run deeper into the building, one attacks, going for Claire with razor teeth and claws.  She shoots it in the forehead, and once it hits the floor Cas quickly shoves a penny into its mouth and chops its head off before it can wake back up.  Donna is already running for the stairs at the back of the building with her machete in hand, so Cas and Claire follow suit.
Abruptly, the scream is choked off.  Castiel flinches.
His lips part and Cas follows, deepening the kiss and sending shockwaves through Dean’s chest.  His shirt is pulled taut against his lower back as Cas bunches the fabric in his fists.  Heat surges up from Dean’s core, pulsing through his body like an earthquake.
Claire takes on the smallest, a wiry short-statured female who moves quicker than the other two.  Donna goes for the giant of the three, a male at least two heads higher than her.  The last is another female who’s tall and muscled like a blacksmith, and she’s looking at Cas like she’s picking out which body part she wants to eat first.  The three Nachzehrers attack in unison.
Waiting.  For what?
“Any idea who he is?” Sam asks, pointedly ignoring the odor wafting up at them from the steel drawer.
“Not until you’re tested.”
“Yeah, your other ones were a little bloody,” Dean remarks as Cas sits across from him at the breakfast table.
He worries about Cas sometimes.  It’s been a few years, and most of the time Cas seems okay.  He seems happy, even.  He shows up for all the family events
“Dean, its arm isn’t broken.”
Jack lets out a sigh, his hands resting in his lap.  “Cas, I…  I don’t plan anyone’s fate.  Really, I don’t.  But once they reach it, there’s nothing I can do.”
He half expects Dean to admonish him for wishing his wife was dead, but Dean only smiles knowingly.  “You know, I felt the same way.  Until Cas showed up, I mean.”
Dean’s jaw twitches, an argument hanging in the back of his throat.
The crew laughs — including Dean.
Dean hands him a bottle.  “Not just mine.  Ours.  Everyone’s.”
Jack looks past him to where Claire is sobbing into Donna’s arms.  “They will be fine, just as you were.”
, it was the kraken.  Wasn’t it?  It took down the island, and my ship with it.”
The man laughs, water dripping from the tip of his nose.  “No,” he says.  “We found you floating, fished you out.”
Sam’s eyebrows shoot up again in surprise.  Dean’s never been willing to even
Dean’s eyes dart back and forth, searching for anything amiss.  “I guess not.”
Dean drops to his knees next to Cas and pulls him back up to sit braced against the wall.  “Cas.  Cas!  You still with me?”
” Castiel yelps, jerking back.
Sam is standing frozen with his eyes wide and jaw dropped, Eileen’s duffle bag hanging from his shoulder.  Eileen has her hands clamped over her mouth, desperately trying not to laugh but failing as she starts to snort through her fingers.
Somehow, the answer is more startling than anything else Castiel was expecting Dean to say, and he wants to press for more information.  But the way Dean has stiffened, the square set of his shoulders and sharp corner of his jaw, stops Castiel’s questions in his throat.  He leaves the conversation to dangle in the air.
Sam sighs in relief and pulls Jack to his feet, giving him a quick, clapping hug around the shoulders.  “Do you need some time before we do the other spell?”
“Frank, I am
A hollow cough of a laugh comes up from Dean’s chest, bitterness seeping into his words.  “You know, for a guy who hates my father as much as he does, Sam sure is following in his footsteps.”
