"I want you, inside me." Tony grits out between heavy pants, and that does cause Steve to still instantly.
Wanda stops mid-air, her eyes slowly circling around her as she takes in her teammates. Her fingers are swirled with red, discolored air, and her eyes are gleaming. Tony, on the other hand, just floats back and settles onto the ground like he's waiting to see how everything pans out before he gets involved.
"Yeah. Pepper wasn't answering the phone and after the last alien invasion, I was worried about her." It's a lie and while he's good at lying, he's not comfortable with lying to someone as earnest as Steve is, "Fell over something in my way there but I'm alright."
"Tony!" Steve calls, and without even having to voice what he's planning, he holds his shield up. Although they had a lot of personal disagreements and couldn't get along too well off the field, they've always been able to fight well together.
The blond's voice cracks as he asks the last question, and Tony is horrified as he takes in Steve's expression. Of course that's what Steve thinks. That as soon as Tony gets spooked out over something they don't have control over, that he'd equate Steve to the things he was running from. Tony didn't know better back then; but after everything they'd gone through
A second later, after shaking his head like he feels as though he made a mistake, Steve turns around and whirls back in the direction of the garage. Maybe it's to get some air, but maybe it's just because he's also tired of Tony's shit. The brunet isn't sure, but he watches the alpha walk away and is silently grateful that Bucky and Sam follow him out. At least they'll keep him company until he simmers down.
"Trust me, with this kid in your life -" he nudges Tony with his shoulder, ignoring the incredulous look he's being given, "- it'll be like you never left the circus."
"I know we're already married so this is more of a formality than anything, but when we got married we'd decided on keeping us a secret and I -- I want the world to know that Tony Stark is mine."
Steve's erection continues to swell from beneath his own crotch, and they're painfully rubbing against one another at this point, and Tony watches the way Steve's Adam's apple bobs. He drags his eyes upward and sees the adoration clearly in Steve's blue eyes.
Tony's not used to having someone like Steve take care of him. The last to have genuinely cared for Tony was the butler, Jarvis, who had been sent away shortly after his mom had passed. It's foreign, and he feels guilty for wanting more of it. He's reluctant to move, though, because he knows getting up now and taking a break is only going to hinder his ability to create.
with him. He knows Tony goes out whenever Steve does, because Tony just had to make sure his tower and his company are fine (at least, that's what Tony says every time).
And then he kind of convinces himself to save Tony because he wants to make it happen. One glance in Natasha's direction tells him she thinks the same.
James's eyes flicker over to Bucky again, this time more deliberate and thoughtful. Bucky lifts his head just enough to look at him in return, his eyebrows twitching and his lips curled into the slightest of frowns. They've never met before, as far as Steve's concerned, but there's something there.
"Stark," Clint calls from behind them; and though Steve releases his hold of Tony and shifts just one step to the side, he refuses to move too far for Tony to reach again.
Everyone knew it was too good to be true. With everything that happened, the idea of the Rogues (including Bucky) being welcomed into their old team compound was surreal at best. They were just waiting for the shoe to drop.
The rest of the occupants still, glancing between each other and then turning back to Tony. Steve should say something. He knows he should. After all, he was just as guilty about the whole incident as Tony was.
Steve wants to say how unfair that is. He wants to defend Bucky, his best friend from childhood who he'd lost once before and regretted every day; but he also regretted letting go of Tony Stark once, too. Did he really have to make a choice between teammates and friends again?
"What does that mean?" Steve questions, crouching down to get a closer look at Wanda's expression, "What did you
"That's a multi-million dollar prosthesis and I'd appreciate it if you put it down." Tony snarks back and he holds his hand out.
After Afghanistan and the torture he'd gone through there, showering had been a problem. For months, he couldn't even go into the bathroom without having a panic attack. It still hits him occasionally when the shower spray turns on, but he's learning to handle it better.
"Every few days, or maybe once a week -- I don't know." Tony admits, then quickly shakes his head, "We should meet up. Get to know each other. That kind of stuff. I usually hate the fate crap and I don't like feeling like all of this is just the universe's way of telling me who I am but you're a good guy, Rogers. If you've spent years being content with watching me from a distance, I should at least meet you halfway."
"How about you?" Tony asks, and he notices a few frayed edges on Steve's polo shirt that hadn't been there earlier in the day, "Have anything for me to look over?"
He knows that from the start, he's always expected so much from Tony. The only thing to him, though, was that Tony was always so much harder on himself than anyone else was. Maybe it was the guilt of what he'd gone through or maybe it was something else, but Tony was never able to just give himself a break.
"It was in Afghanistan, actually. I got hit by a stray bullet, thought I'd lose a foot." How Sam manages to sound amused despite the story is beyond him, but still, Tony finds himself drawn in, "I spent some time with vets, like I told you, and then one day, Steve and Bucky walk in."
Tony stares at his disappearing back, feeling like he's really missed something important. The bumping against his shoulder wasn't rough enough to be considered aggressive, but part of him couldn't help but wonder if there was some animosity directed towards him in that exchange. When he drags his eyes from the metal-armed man to Steve with his eyebrows drawn, Steve isn't even looking in his direction. Steve's looking in the direction of the front door, where the other man had gone through, and he looks
The lights are off when he steps inside, and for a moment he wonders if Steve is still out there and possibly hurt, but when he shuts the door behind him, the lights turn on; and there's Steve, arms crossed over his chest and eyes twitching in a barely concealed fury.
His words register as soon as they're uttered, and everyone turns to Steve as they expect an answer -being Tony's mate, and all-, but it's Natasha who answers, ever so carefully, "He said you were having a mental crisis and questioning your responsibilities to Stark Industries."
That causes Tony to pause mid-step. He turns around, his face set as he stares at Clint. Then, he tears his eyes away from the blond to look at the bot. Two seconds later, he bursts into laughter with a hand on his stomach as he folds over. All he can think of is Dum-E following guests around with a fire extinguisher. He'd be as bad at being bad as he is at being good.
When he steps into Tony's room, the brunet is shirtless and sitting on the edge of the bed. One hand is pressed firmly against his chest, and his face is twisted into a pained grimace. All of Steve's former frustration melts away as he hurries over, kneeling before Tony to look up into the brunet's eyes.
, and all he wants right now is to be closer. He wraps his legs around Steve's waist, and he's surprised to find that Steve just allows himself to be rolled aside.
Except, it's not necessary, because when the helicopter gets close enough for whoever's in it to drop down, Tony breaks out into a wide grin at who sees through the window. A man as flambouyant as Tony Stark would only ever have friends as equally flamboyant -- and that's a fact.
And then Steve bends down, pressing his lips against the glass of the arc reactor. Tony can't feel it, of course; but the very image of it has Tony feeling all sorts of vulnerable. The last time someone went near his chest, they'd tried to kill him. And now here was his husband, kissing his chest and wordlessly promising to keep it safe.
Steve looks the most beautiful when he's asleep; with his eyebrows relaxed and a peaceful smile decorating his handsome face. Tony knows there are a million and one things he has to get done. Okay, no, just the one; but it's daunting enough to have the same effect as a million things. He knows he has to get it done, though; but when he compares his responsibility to wanting to be selfishly wrapped in Steve's love for just a little longer, Steve's love wins out in a landslide.
Tony blinks, forcing the smile to widen; but he's sure Steve doesn't buy it. The blond doesn't say anything about it, though, just continues watching Tony like he's trying to solve a puzzle.
With his anxiety bubbling in his chest, and adrenaline coursing through him, Tony spins on his heels and runs to the garage. He's not sure if they're planning to go back out or not, but it really would suck if his plans to get out unnoticed were to be thwarted.
"Welcome home, honey." Tony says instead, and he strides over to take some of the bags from Steve, leaning up on his toes to press a kiss to the corner of Steve's mouth.
"You don't like popcorn?" Steve asks, and Tony's baffled by the blond's obliviousness, "I'm sure we've got M&Ms here if you'd pre-"
As soon as she's back on the ground, Wanda turns back to Steve. For a moment, he's looking at that sweet naïve brunette that lost her brother after a series of bad choices. When the illusion fades, however, he's looking at a bitter, hollow young woman that can't seem to let her own past go and move forward.
His command is cut off when Tony shifts just slightly and rockets off into the air. It might have been just a second, but the entire suit covers his body as he propels himself forward and catches the falling machinery.
Steve does, in fact, manage to get to the door before Tony can shut it behind him, and using just his elbow, he barges into the room and slams it shut. He's panting from the exertion, and his entire frame shakes as he leans against the door, but Tony pays no heed to it. He just fumbles in the dark for a light switch. He's not entirely sure why they need light, but there's something he wants to confirm on Steve's expression that he needs the light for.
Steve stares at him, his mouth feeling dry. They've never really spoke about that time, because it was so long ago and heroes aren't expected to have weaknesses anyway; but to hear Tony explain what it was he saw with such a soft and weak voice? Why hadn't Tony just told him back then? Why hadn't they trusted each other back then? They trusted each other on the field so why couldn't they trust each other off of it, as well?
He pulls, and Tony willingly moves up so that their lips meet in another filthy kiss. Steve doesn't seem to mind that Tony tastes of his cum, and his tongue swirls against the brunet's in a much more languid way than their last kiss. Moments later, when he's finally calmed down and his breathing has returned to normal, he reaches for Tony's erection.
Steve shoots him a look, and it's speculative and disbelieving, but it's the way Tony's been for years, so he must come to the conclusion it's not something he can change on his own.
Tony turns to stare at Sam, his expression crossed between confusion, amusement, and something else that can't entirely be read. It causes a little flicker of hope to rise in Steve's chest, though; because while Steve and Tony had gotten off to a rough start, there was no denying that Tony was indeed one of the best men to have ever existed.
Steve looks off in their direction, and his smile is amused despite the situation as he turns to Tony, "Are you jealous? Did you marry the wrong person?"
“And if I refuse to help that monster?” Wanda asks now, her eyes narrowed and her lips curled back into a snarl.
"That's not yours!" Tony hollers, and Steve hadn't actually realized he'd picked it up until that moment. A gauntlet wraps around Tony's wrist and he fires a shot immediately, the anger blazing in his eyes.
The Winter Soldier and Captain America are the only other two, aside from himself, that hide their faces behind their masks. They seem to be using modulators for their voices just like himself, too. It's suspicious but at the same time, the three of them have secrets and that's all there is to it.
"Long time no see," the armored man quips, the very same voice that had come from the Iron Man suit they've all been in contact with once or more in the past. The suit breaks away, seemingly into Tony's skin, leaving the lean physique of Tony Stark for them to gape upon for the first time in a year.
"What do you know of alternate realities?" Stephen asks instead, and the change in subject is so extreme that everyone just stares at him and waits.
Like before with Steve, it seems like a silent agreement has been made, and everyone just nods. There are lips twitching in amusement, but they're all trying so hard to keep straight faces that Tony thinks he'll just let this one slide. Just this one, though, and just this one time. From there, brunch seems to wind down. Everyone gets absorbed into their private conversations, and once in a while, someone would start a conversation with another group; but for the most part, it was just another day for the pack.
And that causes Steve's heart to break. Sure, he's known about the tight friendship between Tony and Rhodey. They all did. But for someone as confident and self assured as Tony to feel like he's got no place in the world without his best friend? Suddenly, he's brought back in time to when he thought he'd lost Bucky. If anyone knew how Tony would feel in such a moment, it was him.
“More tea, Captain Rogers?” Stephen asks, more out of obligation than an actual interest in the leader of the Avengers.
Tony Stark, after all. But I figured you'd get bored and tell him to fuck off and I'd finally have my shot."
"Jesus Christ." Bucky breathes out, and aside from Sam's gasp, earlier, he's the first with a verbal response.
, but Steve doesn't let him. His own hands pin Tony's down, the pressure a little too firm for him to pull away; and yet, if he really wanted to be released, he knew Steve would let him go.
The entire time he's pulled along, Tony is protesting. His words fall onto deaf ears and he usually hates being ignored, but Steve still looks at him when he talks and squeezes his hand when he feels that Tony is getting more anxious. This is the first time Tony's stepped into the house since before his mother passed away, too, and that seems to make the entire situation much more difficult to bear. Especially when he walks into the dining room, and all the memories he's had of it are being replaced with new faces and new voices.
In a way, Steve should be glad not to see Tony again after a year of radio silence. There was so much hurt on both sides of the field; and if the roles were reversed, if Tony had actually managed to kill Bucky when he had tried, Steve would probably be in the same boat.
"I don't think this is something we need to debate." Steve says, deliberate and thoughtful as he sweeps his gaze over his sullen teammates, "Wanda's betrayed us. Sure, she's younger and needs more guidance than us; but it's time we trust Tony and try to earn back his trust in us."
"Didn't take you for the sentimental type, Iron Man." The Winter Soldier grins, and Tony can never understand why that mask just doesn't sit right on his face.
The blond's pulse is slowing down, but Tony can't help the way concern floods him. What could Steve have possibly seen that terrified him so much? And then he reminds himself that they were strangers when they met and got married. There was still so much they barely knew about each other; and Tony had no right to pry into his history or bad dreams.
"No chatter on the comms." Captain America calls into the comm link, and Tony's glad no one can see his face because he's rolling his eyes as soon as he hears it.
"What happened that day is on all of us, Tony." Natasha eases in, and she's on the other side of Tony and holding onto his shoulder even though she can't feel him through the armor.
to touch. Steve groans into his mouth, appreciative of Tony's touch, his own hands dropping to Tony's waist and tugging at the hem of the brunet's shirt.
"Where the hell are we?" Clint asks, and the archer is rubbing his shoulder. Tony had done a number on him after all, and that was just from a blast of his repulsor. They've all been blasted at in the past, whether by accident or on purpose, but back then being blasted at didn't accompany the scent of charred flesh.
"Hold on, I need a drink." Tony answers, holding a single finger up as he pours the scotch in his glass. He hasn't had alcohol in years, and scotch tastes better on the rocks, but he needs it at moments like this when the world is crumbling around him.
He's stepping closer without even really being aware of it until he's just beside Tony, on his knees with his arms wrapped tightly around the metal armor. Sure, they had a falling out and sure, there's a lot to be said before any of them can heal properly; but as it turns out, Tony had spent the past year wallowing in his grief and Steve just
i'm as bad at writing about emotional vulnerability as Tony is at feeling it. i hope this one doesn't make you cringe like it made me cringe. i love angst but -- wow, it's a lot. on another note, i was supposed to bring rhodey into the story as an actual character rather than an implied one, but i kept forgetting about him. hopefully, i can rectify this with the next chapter.
As if he had forgotten he was in the presence of company, Tony makes a noise of surprise and forces a smile onto his face, "Yeah. I think so. I -- hold on. I'm reading my texts."
sound that vibrates in Tony's spine. His head falls onto Tony's shoulder, his arms dropping to Tony's waist and his fingers curling in hard enough to bruise the skin. For whatever reason, Tony doesn't mind.
"Tony." Steve calls out, and everyone's attention turns to him now. They've had so many explosive conversations in the past and even without the Accords. There's no telling what Steve will say or how Tony will react.
"When we hit the surface, you looked at me, Tony." Steve recalls, plowing through the cut off attempt with the slightest smile on his lips, "You asked me not to leave you alone again."
"In the entertainment room, there's a small closet behind the flat screen," Tony says instead, because a change of subject is in order if he doesn't want to break down at the thoughts of his mother and childhood, "You should go and check it out when you've got a chance."
Behind him, Rogers seems to sigh and walk around the bed. Then suddenly he’s right behind Tony and reaching for something in the wardrobe.
Behind Steve was the billboard of that puppy. And somewhere along these streets was the lamp-post Tony has become so fond of.
“Do you?” He replied quietly, knowing that if he said the word, Steve would probably never speak to him again. At least...not in any way as to bring him anywhere as a plus one or take him out and buy him clothes and compliment him-
“Alpha...will you...knot me? Please? I can...you can use me...you could b-breed me...” Tony begged and exposed his throat and Steve’s eyes closed tightly.
“We talked about that.” Rogers implores and clenches his fists right by his sides like he’s itching for a fight. “You don’t remember but we sat down and talked. I apologized because I was
There’s someone across the road. A man with blond hair, in a long beige coat who seems to be carrying a suitcase and looking around. All of a sudden, Tony’s hit with a wave of longing.
Steve's expression turned to steel. "My feelings for you are real Tony. You don't know just how much they mean to me. Just how much I care about you. Sometimes-" Steve shook his head tiredly and looked away. "Sometimes it scares me, just how far you can make me go."
Yesterday, he’d given his last cents to the clerk in the twenty-four hour corner store. Today he’s sat outside that same store, probably waiting for the guy to send him away again.
“What does he want from me?” Tony asked quietly, feeling detached from his own words. Did it matter?
line of thinking down. Jesus, there was only so much Tony could take. “Just...what did you want to try?”
“I’m not sure yet. But something has to change. Keep working on those forged documents. I’ll have Tony starting on these by the end of the day.” Steve promised, holding up the bag of pills. Four months. He’d make it count.
Tony said nothing. He didn’t really have an argument to that. Plus he couldn’t believe Steve was actually angry about this.
“W-what?” Steve says hoarsely and begins to sit up. It’s hard but his hands hold him up enough that he can settle on his knees. He’s really not in bad shape, all things considered.
The trip back to the mansion was bleak and long. It felt infinite, like the possibilities Steve had dreamed of with Iron man.
“Wh't...ext’remis?” He whispered and when he rolled his head to look up at Steve directly, his pupils were blown wide and bright blue, with faint lines running across.
Steve launches forward and kisses him then, firm and fierce and happy and grateful all at once. And when he pulls away, he's beaming giddily and can't stop.
“If you need blood, you know I’m here. I can give you everything you need, my dear.” She repeated, and as always, tilted her neck to expose the pale, smooth expanse of skin. It was unmarked as Zeke had never had to mark her-she was a born vampire, a pure-blood. She had never needed the bite of another.
“Well I haven’t been Captain America for a long time. I think this job suits me better.” Steve sighed and rubbed at his forehead tiredly. “Even if I don’t leave this room half the time.”
His name appeared on the glass panel. The door revealed Steve’s gear and various Shield weapons. Guns, hoods, uniforms and all sorts of wonders were there.
“Heads up Thor!” Steve growled, slashing his claws through yet another of Ty’s men. They were going down like flies.
“Yeah, like I said. I don’t have a mark.” Tony said softly and with trembling lips, bent down to pick up his pants, feeling like he was going to break. Only then-
“I don’t trust them with you Tony. I’ll be honest, you don’t have the best track record of looking after yourself and Steve is being so stubborn it’s unbelievable. But if something happens, who will look out for you? You’re alone there.”
“I brought it like a said I would.” He said and the bed dipped as he leaned over and draped something else over Tony’s body. It felt like another blanket but it smelled so good. Earthy scents of a forest, and the sweet dampness of spring time, the slight sharpness of lavender and pine.
“He is. But that’s his mother’s eyes right there. Tell me boy, what’s your thoughts on this whole shebang?”
“Hmm?” Steve tried his best to keep his voice light. They seemed to have mutually agreed that nothing should be said about earlier and Steve was prepared to stay quiet until Tony was ready.
Tony cleared his throat and looked away. What was there to say? What could he say? If Steve knew what he was thinking, he’d probably laugh and correct him. And Tony really didn’t want to hear that because like this, he could pretend he was important to the team. Still, the questions circled his mind over and over.
“I think you know in your heart which one it is.” Pepper says smugly and he can hear her typing away in the background. “You obviously have a preference.”
"You shouldn't forgive me for assuming you were cruel. You're not a monster Tony. You could never be." Steve blew out a breath and shook his head.
The worst thing was that Tyler sounded so reasonable. Like Tony was the one who didn’t understand why this was for the best. And why this was good for him.
“Yeah. Vices.” Steve sighed and blew out a breath. Then he turned and started to walk back out onto the main road.
As Tony skulked through the corridors, he continued to play back the conversation in his mind. For all that Zeke claimed he did, not once was he willing to let Tony prove himself, even though Tony was certain he’d been playing his part well. Though maybe he had Whitney to blame for this. His life would be absolutely miserable when he bonded with her.
Grant had never seen such a thing before. This strange, unique ship painted in blue with stars. In the distance, it almost seemed like a fallen star, so bright in contrast to the sandy dunes of this barren place.
Tony couldn’t disappoint them. He described his adventure as a feeling of flying. Of being free to roam. It wasn’t his intention but he knew he was glorifying it.
“Thanks Ty. So should I start with the first one or just pick one and go from there? I guess it doesn’t matter but that fourth design by Ryan looks pretty-“
“Oh my god.” Tony breathed, staring at the ceiling in awe. He thought he heard the doctor sigh in relief.
The watch was a Breitling; a silver chain strap that hugged the wrist while the clock face was set against a sapphire blue reflective surface. The dial was fairly big but overall it matched the blue and silver theme Tony was going with. It looked really nice and as Tony took off his Rolex and slid this one on, he wondered just how much thought Steve had put into this. It must've cost a fortune.
“Twice.” Tony mumbled, knowing without a doubt that this doctor would tell Steve. And that the thought made him feel sick to his stomach.
He performed his final scouting and finally returned to the first block, scanning the streets below. He thought he’d done quite well for his first night. And no creature interactions either. What an excellent result!
Pierce guided him through the crowd, occasionally bumping shoulders and saying quick hellos. Though he greeted a large number of politicians, he still managed to steer clear from the area Steve had last been in, and while it was completely unintentional, Tony was immensely grateful.
“Tony, I’d like you to meet my close friends, Dugan and Gabe. Dugan and Gabe are former members of-"
Guilt sunk low in his stomach as he spoke. He owed Sharon so many apologies but he couldn’t lie any more. It was doomed from the start.
The questions he wants to ask are simple. What’s changed, where is he now? What’s happened to the company, why is he now fighting Hydra agents with a team of superheroes when he’d been declared a consultant?
“How what is?” He murmured tiredly, feeling his energy evaporate as he let Steve pull him into a tight hug. The huge arms held him tightly.
But she doesn’t know that. When he looks up from his desk and meets her eye, he sees a shadow there that wasn’t there before.
“Hmm. Fair. So tell me-“ Dugan jerked his head up at Steve. “How’d you get on Captain America’s radar? It’s not every day someone catches his eye.”
Steve flashed him a smile and leaned back against the bench, stretching his arms out to take up space. “I don’t have one. But I know mates are another thing entirely. Someone does something to your mate-“ Steve made a slow cut over his neck with his finger. “-they’re dead. No questions asked.”
Letting out a sigh of relief, he turned and prepared to search for a private corridor to make some calls when Fury grabbed his shoulder. When Tony looked back at him, Fury’s expression was pinched and the one hand he had on his glass had tightened.
“Take your time. He is a sight isn’t he?” Zeke encouraged, snaking a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony glanced at him with wide eyes, hoping for Zeke to explain but Zeke merely smiled and tightened his grip to almost painful levels.
"The commander sent you a notification." Ben said quietly, and started to tap at the tablet, bringing it closer to read. "Says-"
“So what about you? I hear you’re a journalist.” Tony asked politely, and the minute he did, he knew he’d won the kid’s approval, especially when his mandible hung open for a few seconds.
Feeling almost stunned for a moment, Steve kept quiet and waited. He didn’t dare stop Tony from speaking now.
He’d only experience it with the pureblood he was bonded to now. But he knew, with a sick feeling in his stomach, he’d not enjoy it one bit. And after, it wouldn’t matter how he felt; he’d be Whitney’s puppet and she’d force his hand in everything. Even sex.
Heart racing, Tony swore and turned to the agent on his left, who’d been carefully watching the flashing dot with him. Andrew. His name was
“Oh, but of course Stark.” Pierce said, and something softened in his gaze. “Or maybe I should say Tony. I thought about our conversation earlier.”
“What feelings?” Iron man finally said, but he sounded hushed and almost afraid. Like he couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing.
“Oh, he wants me to dress up for him?” Tony laughed and was pleased when the air-hostess smiled beside him.
“Don’t get yourself killed helping Steve. Because while you won’t remember it, he’ll always remember it. Just like he still remembers the SHRA and almost killing you. Don’t give him more to relive.”
Nodding, Tony stepped in. His dark eyes scanned the walls, glancing at the ornate portrait of Zeke and his father Obadiah. The selected pose was that of father and son, stood side by side, their eyes staring straight ahead with a look of solemnity.
Maybe he gives himself away but as he looks at Bucky, he knows instantly that Bucky knows too. After all, there’d been no fight.
In the main body of the huge quinjet, he was greeted with the sight of the Avengers. Thor and Carol were discussing something with the Shield earth and space teams, while Natasha was helping Hank settle things into a silver briefcase. He decided to join Natasha and Hank.
“Agent Hill! What brings you here?” He tried, feeling a thin smile spread across his face. These days, he didn’t really have many people to talk to. Other than Jenny, of course.
Amused, Fury picked up a new pen from his infinite draw and smiled. “You’d be surprised at what goes on in his head. I think you’ll enjoy yourself Stark.”
He blinks and turns. Pepper is there. Somewhere in the crowd among the sea of familiar faces is the remnants of the Avengers and the legacy Steve once built. An empire that’s slowly falling to pieces.
“You won’t. You can’t.” Steve murmured back in an equally quiet voice but something about the words sent a shiver down Tony’s spine. They almost sounded reverent and settled somewhere low in his body until Steve was all he could think of. The evening would end eventually but this wouldn’t leave Tony’s mind anytime soon.
“You’re pregnant. God, you’re-“ Rogers is pressing kisses into his hair just the way he likes and holding him close to his chest like nothing can hurt him and- “We did it. I can’t believe you’re-“
“How quickly will this work Hank?” He asked, feeling something relight in him as Tony’s eyes fluttered.
"Oh, you think you're special Stark? You don't get brownie points for knowing the Commander, you're not any more important to him than the lowest of the low. You're a risk to everyone you meet and I know it, they know it and
“Oh, right.” Steve frowned and shook his head a little before stepping in. For some reason Tony decided not to get out. Maybe he was morbidly curious or maybe he was just lonely. Who knew but he didn’t feel inclined to leave.
They were in the Commanders deck. His own private office. Probably the only place with any privacy on this plane. The clearance level for this had to be through the roof.
Zipping up his hoodie (Steve’s dark blue hoodie), he pulled on his boots and slipped out of Steve’s room.
“Of course. Like I said, I’m always looking for potential.” Steve said brightly, tossing a baseball in the air and catching it. His claws dug into the material with each catch. They looked sharper tonight.
“Nothing yet. We found a few doctors who had a few unregistered supplies. They've started the tagging process on all bottles from other countries already so these weren’t easy to come by. If you can’t read what they say, that’s because they’re either in Russian or Portuguese but the side effects should be the same.” Natasha gestured to the bag and at Steve's laser stare, sighed and explained.
A quiet groan pulled him out of his thoughts and when he turned, he was met with a soft, sleepy grin on Steve’s face. Steve was looking at him like he’d just woken up from a dream.
"I'm fine Shellhead, better now that you're here." Tony could just picture Steve smiling as he said it. It sounded like he was smiling. "I take it you finally went up to the office?"
Even as Steve spoke, he could see Tony was already starting to understand. Areas where the armor had been damaged started to heal with a gold mesh under-suit that escaped from Tony’s skin. As his eyes glowed in the faint light, the gold began to climb up his neck too, and stop just short of where Steve’s hand lay. Then it retracted a little and Steve could finally relax.
“My lord. Say it.” Zeke interrupted. His expression was carefully smooth but something flashed in his eyes.
His memory still hasn’t come back. The doctors keep insisting it needs time but he’s starting to really worry. It’s been four months. Nothings changed, only that he’s gotten to know both Ty and Steve.
Only Tony would believe he’s not good enough. And it’s ironic because Steve has only ever pictured Tony as the perfect key to his puzzle.
“You need to stop believing you don’t deserve good things Tony.” Tony heard from above him as he gently rubbed his cheek into Steve’s abdomen. The hands around him tightened and he thought he felt Steve stiffen slightly.
The day merges into night out here. Tony wonders sometimes how he ever had the ability to make and pilot a suit of armor while simultaneously running a company, all while sober. Its like looking through glass and seeing a different reality.
Taking a deep breath, Tony loosened his shoulders and plastered on a winning smile. He followed the clearly disgruntled assistant through the long glass corridor and waited for her to step into the elevator first, before following her in. Once the doors slid closed, he felt the familiar pull in his stomach as the elevator began to move up.
“You’re perfect for him. And he’s perfect for you. You told me he made you happy whenever he was with you.” Pepper urges and then her voice softens. “Surely that can’t be a bad thing, right?”
“What’re the odds.” Steve said calmly with a closed off expression, only when he looked over at Jeremy he frowned just a tad.
“What’s happened to you all?” Steve whispers, watching the man come apart. “You don’t even sound human anymore.”
“Tony?” He tried, even though his voice shook and his heart raced. Tears welled in his eyes. There was no response.
Tony knew there was still so much more to come. Steve would no doubt have so much more to discuss. They still had so many issues to resolve and so many things to work out. But at this moment, Tony was sure of one thing.
his cheeks were burning. His palms felt sweaty all of a sudden and he clasped then together over his lap, looking at them with a frown. How could Steve think all these things about him? And where on earth was this coming from?
The lift kept going until he reached the quarters. Luckily no one was around and so he walked straight through the living area, and set his eyes on his bunk bed.
Or maybe he just liked the human contact. It had been months after all since anyone had even spoken to him properly. Steve holding him was like being able to sink into a mattress and relax.
“Sure. Just let me suit up.” He says with an empty stare, and doesn’t bother to say anything else when Maria turns back and frowns a little and parts her mouth to say something.
He once again chose a spot, took position and waited. It took a little longer, but this time a male human appeared and thankfully, Tony was able to strike fast enough for the human to pass out before doing anything. It was strange how some humans reacted to his bite. More often than not, they’d almost look like they were falling asleep but occasionally some would scream. It was impossible to predict which but maybe blood type had something to do with it.
“Sure Winghead, whatever you say.” Iron man laughed, and with a tight grip, he swooped down, making Steve soar.
“I like to keep an eye. On the things that are important to me.” Steve said firmly, nostrils flaring as he calmed down. Tony warmed at the words though, even if he knew Steve didn’t mean it the way Tony wanted.
Tony is gobsmacked. His head spins as he stares at the mess and the hallucination standing over it. Maybe he's finally lost it. But hallucinations are never that real-
“No. Not yet.” Tony says lightly, tilting his head in that fond way he does. Steve’s heart eases a little at the sight and relaxes even more when Tony carries on.
The baby's blue eyes are warm and familiar, and he scents of apples and vanilla and just a hint of warm coffee. The perfect mix that Tony can’t help but love. He’s perfect.
Tony didn’t care if he felt the door hit him on the way out. The glass could break for all he cared.
“Everything will be taken care of. Rogers will come and collect you an hour before with a driver and you’ll both arrive as a pair. For the first twenty minutes, let Rogers greet all the other guests and let him introduce you formally. After that, you can talk to some of the other guests, mingle and eat, dance for a while and then if you feel tired, head home. Rogers has agreed to take you back if you want to leave early. He’ll keep an eye on you.”
“Steve, please.” Tony presses a hand to his temples and massages them tiredly. Steve keeps bringing this point up. This is the third time this week.
“I know.” Steve grit his teeth and pulled his legs out onto the ball pit steps, but not without difficulty. The medium size Cap-tsum was pulling on his boot and was somehow using telekinesis to try and bash his little shield against Steve’s leg and the baby ones seemed to be getting ready to do the same.
“He hasn’t told me.” Reed says quietly and glances back at the photo behind him. “You believe we destroyed a planet.”
“Once he lost all vital signs, the armor would register and take over. The protocol would be activated and serve one purpose.”
Gritting his teeth in frustration, Tony slid of the bed and knelt in front of Zeke, knowing he needed to do more.
“We had no chance of that. Going back to how we were, I mean.” Tony explained quietly and Steve knew what he meant.
"I'm so glad you're alright." She said quietly and squeezed him tighter before letting go to face him. "Pepper told us what happened. We were all so worried."
“He’s being seen just over there with the other team. He’s fine, doing well.” The medic hummed and called out a number to his colleague. “Ninety-seven. Starting to stabilize.”
“No, I mean-“ Steve shook his head and sucked in a sharp breath. “I didn’t want this, you have to know that.”
. Steve knows fully well that Tony is swimming in guilt-hell, he’s probably scared too meet Steve’s eyes. It shouldn’t surprise him.
To his surprise, fingers tucked under his chin and lifted his head up gently, with the slow ease of someone handling something delicate. Tony blinked and suddenly found himself looking straight into Steve’s eyes. Their breath brushed against each other.
“Sharon, how’re we looking?” Steve said quietly, approaching her from behind the pilot seat, to watch the radar in front. This quinjet was fully adapted for spacial flight, but Steve had never been comfortable with the idea of reaching the stars unless he absolutely had to.
Tony felt his stomach twist at that. It was like one blow after another. First Pierce, then Sharon, and now Stern!? It was mortifying.
There was a time where he had once been one of the most respected men in all of society. Where he’d stood among some of the greatest men and women of all time. A group of heroes who would risk their lives, day in, day out, just to keep people safe.
“You shouldn’t.” Reed says bluntly, and that catches Steve off guard. “But you don’t need to worry. I won’t use it. I never could.” He says, suddenly turning to the ground as if he hoped it would swallow him whole.
That evening, Tony is alone in his bedroom. Ty hasn’t joined him yet and Tony’s not ready for him to.
After a moment, Norman, Whitney Tiberius and Zeke were the only ones left. At their signal, Tony willed his legs to step forward.
The words send a shiver down Steve’s spine and he feels something lurking. That sinking feeling returns.
When they’d first heard the news, Steve had tried to argue through the diplomatic route. He’s been naive though, thinking that there was no way they would refuse him-
Tony groaned but shifted from his curled up position, his newly claimed dressing gown tucked around him. Something eased in Steve’s heart.
Tony wasn’t thinking straight. But this was good-so much better than seeing him so small and submissive. He was Ironman and Ironman could get angry. The Tony Stark he knew,
Tony’s back throbbed as he pushed himself up to his feet again. Against his will, he hissed at the pain and felt his eyes shut.
Tony looked into those eyes and didn’t turn away. “I just worry they’ll always come back. And finish the job.”
Reed hums and begins to pace a little. “The king is the most important piece. It’s a simple rule, do not let the king fall or you lose. It doesn’t matter how many pieces there are on the board left, if the king dies, there is nothing left. I used to play with Tony.”
“I DON’T HAVE A TEAM! I HAVE NO ONE, ALRIGHT!? NOT A SINGLE PERSON AND DO YOU KNOW WHY!?” Tony could feel it coming out now. Weeks of pent up anger spilling out at the seams. Months of being separated from the only family he knew. He was done.
He cries quietly for hours. It’s dark when he finally looks up. He can’t take it anymore. He doesn’t want to do this anymore.
Still, this evening had had enough surprises. Tony would've been grateful to have missed out on another one.
“Oh, Tony. Look, I know you’re upset.” Tyler dodged, and Tony tried not to feel too surprised when Tyler chose not to talk about his talents. “I tell you what, if you get enough of these done, I’ll have a word with Ben about splitting some of the assignments. How does that sound?”
Tony smiles when the pup yawns and looks up when he notices scurrying foot steps. Steve enters and leaves the room with various blankets in tow. Finally he dumps several on the floor and takes the softest one.
Steve closes his eyes and recites a prayer in his head. He marvels at just how wrong he'd been. At just how different he was after all.
Zeke grumbled under his breath and raked a hand through his brown hair. It looked like a complete mess.
“I don’t want to stop you.” He heard himself say almost as if in an echo and part of him wondered if he was imagining the way Steve’s fists clenched. He didn’t take his eyes of the cuffs though. He couldn’t. Not when they were his only lifeline.
“ZEKE! ZEKE, COME QUICK!” She continued to scream, crying out every time she so much as looked in Tony’s direction.
It had come as no great shock when several weeks previously the Captain had announced over dinner one evening that he and Tony were dating. There had been some good natured teasing, a few off-color jokes from Clint, but then the team had simply accepted it and moved on. So it makes sense that Tony would want to check on Steve, and it gives the team hope that some of their adult memories might still remain, if dormant. That hope is short lived.
Once both bows are fixed, Clint offers the video game as an option for what to do next, and Tony readily, and ecstatically, agrees. When the team walks back through the door, they find Clint and Tony, sitting on the floor of the living room, a digital tally board showing them tied five and five for first place. They are neck and neck on the last lap of Rainbow Road, and so engrossed in their game, they don’t notice that everyone is back until Steve clears his throat loudly.
"Steve, honey, why are you sleeping here? Did you have a nightmare? You know you can wake me up if something is wrong," she says, placing a hand on his shoulder and mentally cursing herself for not noticing that he'd slipped into the room at some point.
Bruce chuckles under his breath and lays a hand on Tony’s shoulder, taking the seat on the other side of his friend.
"If you two don't stop bugging me, I'm going to start practicing on you," Clint informs them calmly, but with steel in his voice.
“How can you abandon me like this? Sending me alone into that den of wolves? You’re a traitor. I feel so betrayed right now.” Tony retorts without rancor, heading for the door.
"It's alright. You didn't know any better," he responds, taking Steve's other hand and smiling at them as best as he can under the circumstances.
Steve allows himself a second to wish Howard Stark was still alive so he could punch the man through a wall before going to the bed and lifting Tony into his arms and pulling him close.
"If they felt so useless that just being allowed to do dishes made them that grateful, then maybe we should let them help with chores. Let them take the garbage out, or help fold the laundry. Real kids in a real family are expected to help with things like that," Clint suggests after a deep breath, "We need to do things with them, play with them. So far all we've done is set them in front of the TV."
Fury is out of the command center before the agent can even finish talking, heading for the lower levels of the hellicarrier as fast as he can.
Tony reaches out a tentative hand to touch it, looking to Steve for permission. When Steve nods, he lays his little hand on the metal. He pets it lovingly, tracing his fingers around the star in the center.
The four remaining members of the team nod solemnly. The fight to get Steve and Tony back had been brutal, and when they'd finally found them, they'd had to leave in such a hurry they hadn't had time to analyze any of the tech that had... changed their friends.
The flight is short, but quiet. No one knows what to say or do about what's happened. When they arrive home less than a half hour later, Thor is the first one to speak.
“That’s true, and it does sound very cool, but it’s very late, Tony, and your body needs sleep. We can ask Clint to show you the apple trick in the morning, alright?” When Tony nods, Steve goes over to stand by Clint, “Now, Tony, you need to apologize to Clint. He was asleep when you ran in, and he could have accidentally hurt you when you jumped on him like that. You scared him. Can you tell him you’re sorry?”
They don’t. As Clint starts their approach, they all set their shoulders, readying themselves for a fight.
"They didn't recognize us when they saw us, so we're assuming their adult memories are gone," Bruce explains, pulling the group's attention to him, "But they also didn't fight us either. And they clung to each other the entire trip here. They wouldn't talk, and fell asleep rather quickly once the jet was in the air, so we didn't get much information out of them. Didn't get
“Glad to hear it. I’m going to go sit with him, make sure there aren’t any immediate side effects. Go ahead and do what you need to whenever Strange gets back and you’re ready,” says Steve, turning and heading back to his room before anyone can say anything.
"For going to talk to Clint, even though it was probably the hardest thing you've ever done, but you did it because you care about me, about us, and I wanted to show you my appreciation," Tony explains, planting one last chaste kiss on the Captain's lips before continuing, "I actually went to talk to him too. But he told me to talk to you, that we needed to work on our communication, and that he isn't our sex therapist."
"...ony. Tony!" Bruce practically yells at his friend, whose attention he's been trying to get for the last several minutes.
Tony looks at Steve with worry and a little fear in his eyes, before turning to the archer and reaching out his hands for a hug. Clint pulls the boy into his arms and holds him close.
“I have some. I brought them. One shot and I can take out weapons and navigation systems. She’ll stay airborne, but they’ll be flying dead stick till the engineers can sort them out. Two shots and she falls out of the sky,” Clint answers before Steve can finish asking the question. He doesn’t like talking about what he did under Loki’s control, has in fact threatened to shoot anyone who brings it up, but having a back-up plan incase SHIELD ever turns on them seemed like a good idea.
Tony immediately shuts his mouth and his body trembles a bit in anticipation of punishment. They both stand ramrod straight and look at the floor.
She knows it isn't cowardice that's made him leave. He's stared down the barrel of a gun more times than anyone can count, and she's personally witnessed him being tortured for days on end without the slightest sign of breaking. But this is different. This is Steve and Tony who were taken and made small and innocent again... then had that innocence ripped away from them with such brutality it makes her want to either break down in tears or find the people responsible and slice off their skin piece by piece.
“Pretty close. Milliseconds probably. He pulled out his knife and dropped it like a hot cake right after you left. Scared him half to death.”
“Oh god…” Tony turns and buries his face in Steve’s shirt, “How close did Clint come to killing me that night?”
Tony curls in on himself, pulling his knees to his chest and clutching his screwdriver tightly. Clint feels like the worst human being in existence, and he desperately hopes Howard Stark is rotting in hell. He reaches out a hand and sets it on Tony’s knee.
Over their dinner of homemade macaroni and cheese, Tony insists that the team tell him all about the different bad guys they’ve fought. They acquiesce, though they leave out all the gory bits and anything that directly involves Iron Man. Once the meal is over, Natasha shoos Steve out of the kitchen and does the dishes, (which surprises the hell out of Steve, but he doesn’t question it,) and he settles on the couch while Tony picks out a movie to watch before bedtime. He chooses Lilo and Stitch, (so he can show Thor what aliens are
"Mister Barton. Miss Romanoff. You must wake up," JARVIS's voice comes through the speaker in their room sometime around four in the morning, waking them both from a sound sleep.
“Hey. I’m not mad, okay? I promise. And you can stay here as long as you like. We’ll just tell your dad it’s not safe to come home, and you can live here for the rest of ever, kay? And I’m sure your idea is going to work. So why don’t we go get the bow I used on the apples, and you can show me how you were thinking of fixing the string?”
Steve drizzles a large amount of lube onto his cock, coating himself thoroughly, and positions the tip of his dick at Tony's entrance. Slowly, pausing at any sign of discomfort, he presses himself inside his lover, the blissful pleasure of Tony's velvety walls around him nearly causing him to lose control of himself.
"We rested as ordered until our allotted sleep time was over. We're waiting for our next order," Tony explains, eyes barely flicking up to meet hers worriedly, "We weren't sure where you wanted us to wait, so we chose Master Thor's chair. We apologize for making the decision on our own. It was incredibly ungrateful of us," both boys stand and place their feet shoulder width apart and clasp their hands behind their backs, "We are ready for our punishment now."
“I do have the shield. But I left it right outside the door with one of my teammates. Would you like to see it?”
"Thank you JARVIS. Clint, you're in charge of getting all the weapons out of the house and down to your range. And by all, I mean
return his feelings, that now that he has… he doesn’t know what to say. Or do for that matter. Gently, cautiously, as though Tony will bolt and run screaming from his room if he moves too fast, Steve raises a hand and runs his fingers along Tony’s cheek.
“Clint! Clint! Clint! It’s morning! You said you’d do the apple trick! It’s morning! Time to get up!”
"Steve, do you remember when we said we are your family?" Clint asks suddenly, voice muffled with emotion.
“That’s a… that’s a lot of apples. Just how many of these am I shooting?” Clint asks, looking at the boxes.
"I understand that, but if I tear you, even just a little bit, I'd never forgive myself," Steve remarks, sadness in his eyes, "We've only been... doing this for a few months. I think we should wait until you're a lot more used to it at least. What do you think?" he turns to the man they've come to see.
feel. I talk about what I think all the time, but feelings… I epically suck at those. Plus, I… was trying to pretend to myself that what I was feeling wasn’t real, you know? You’re from the forties for godsake! Having feelings… like this… for another guy… wasn’t really kosher back then. Still isn’t as kosher as it should be. So I tried to deny it. Told myself it was just friendship, and hero worship, and seriously, you’d have to be a blind person not to appreciate how perfect and beautiful your body is. And I made excuses. Went on missions with you when you could have handled it fine on your own. Touched you when I didn’t need to. Hell, I faked being asleep a few minutes ago, just so I’d have an excuse to keep snuggling up against you. Figured you’d be fine with it, since I was four ten minutes ago, and then we’d brush it off in the morning, and forget about it. But then you started talking…”
Breakfast consists of lukewarm tea that really doesn’t taste like tea and toast with superficially tasting strawberry jam. Compared to the pancakes they would’ve had the day before, it was sorely lacking. Steve now realizes just how much he’d taken advantage of Stark’s kindness over the years. Back then, the pantry was always stocked and the coffee was always piping hot and fresh.
Steve offers a weak smile, and the emotions dancing in his eyes are too much for him to discern right now. He brings his hands up to Steve's face, watching with a shiver of delight when Steve leans forward into his touch. Tony's initiated a few touches since their first meeting, but this feels so intimate that he's stunned at the thought of being able to do it at all.
Steve shoots Bucky a dirty look, but the metal-armed man looks unrepentant as his eyes focus on Rhodey. His gaze flickers ever so slightly, like he's found something strange, but he seems to fade into the back like the rest of the pack. Rhodey, too, falters for just a moment as his eyes find Bucky's; but he's a lot better put together than Bucky and manages to flash a smile in his direction.
But the words are swallowed up by Steve's mouth, hot and inviting and unrelenting. There's the slightest tremble of Steve's lips where they're pressing against Tony, but the blond is aware of what he wants and he'll take it
"Don't think that's a good idea." He gets out, and he sees the blatant amusement on Steve's face. How in the world is any of this amusing?
Bucky turns just his head to look at him, and he's raising an eyebrow in a manner that makes Tony feel absolutely stupid. There is no verbal answer at first, until Bucky deposits the mug in front of Tony once more and gently claps his metal hand against Tony's shoulder, "I know your story from what you shared last night and what you shared with me today, so I get that this is different for you than what it is to guys like me and Steve; but if my rejection did as much to hurt him when we
"It's not a problem." Tony answers, putting his clothes back onto the top of the dresser, unable to meet those beautiful blue puppy dog eyes, "It's just..."
They hold each other for a little while longer, and then they go to the couch and turn on a random movie. Tony sees the title, knows the movie well enough that he can tune it out, then turns his head to glance at Steve. The blond is perfectly still, almost forced, as they sit side by side. They're not touching, and there's a bowl of popcorn on the table in front of them that they've been ignoring.
That seems to annoy the alien; but before it can turn its ray onto the Captain, Iron Man swoops down and locks his arms under the Captain's shooting up in the air and aiming a gauntlet in its direction.
Steve is looking at him with so much love in his eyes that it almost physically hurts. There's understanding mixed in, and fear, and loneliness. Tony finds that he wouldn't mind getting lost in those eyes.
"I've been sitting back and waiting because I'm still new to this team," Bucky grits out, "and she's been nothing but hostile towards Stark. There ain't no honor in how she's treating the dead."
That seems to startle a laugh out of Steve, although it's a wet sound and lingers with disbelief. The blond pulls back slowly, and Tony ignores the unshed tears gleaming in his eyes and instead focuses on the pointed raise of one of those beautiful brows.
"The Accords, for one." Sam answers easily, and his disposition is calm as he continues, "There was a lot going on back then. A lot of what happened could have ended differently if we'd just done this; sat and talked it out without picking up our weapons."
Tony can't help the twitch of his lips as he hears it; because there are a lot of things he could say about the story, but calling for Jesus isn't the first thing that comes to mind.
"How do we stop him from doing that?" Steve asks, and this time, his voice is firm and unwavering. It didn't matter how much Tony wanted him dead. He would gladly give up his own life if it meant Tony wouldn't go down the path where he couldn't return from.
The ceiling of the sanctum crumbles overhead, and they're only moments away from being crushed by it.
Steve scoffs in amusement and doesn't bother holding back the roll of his eyes, but he does what is requested of him and jogs back to where he'd flung it off to earlier. Tony's still waiting for him, one foot into the portal with his head turned back to watch with silent intent.
Steve seems to snap out of his anger instantaneously, and he steps away as soon as Tony finishes his sentence. His head is dropped now, out of view, and Tony feels like he's done so much to hurt a man that deserved better than he could give.
Steve had come back with a sandwich and Bucky following him after their last stop. Truthfully, he didn't want to stop; but while he was used to driving for days with no end in sight, he couldn't find it in him to force them to do the same. Tony couldn't eat; he couldn't even raise the cup of coffee he would usually inhale to his lips. Steve tried that look again, of course, but Tony was a bundle of nerves. Bucky strong-armed him into sitting in the back. He frowned and glared, but the metal-armed man was just as stubborn as Steve on a normal day. Tony just sighed, stretched out in the back seat, and tried to ignore the many glimpses Steve threw at him over the rear-view.
"Just like old times, am I right?" Tony chuckles, but there's no amusement in his tone and his jaw is set, "Come at me, both of you. Let's finish what we started in Siberia. And don't hold back because, this time, I won't."
"Do you still have feelings for him?" He asks, and Bucky doesn't answer immediately. Tony's a little relieved by this, but can't help but feel the sorrow that gnaws at the back of his mind. Fate really wasn't fair to the pair of them, was it?
"You're home early." Steve notes, his voice soft and a hint of affection that curls around his tone and sends Tony's heart thrumming.
"Better than you." Tony says, and for the briefest moment, it feels like such a Tony answer. Confident, self assured, full of mischief. It nearly makes Steve's breath hitch.
Steve shoots him a look, full of amusement and reproach as he stands up and holds Tony's pants out to him, "I'm not you, Tony. I've already taken care of it."
"Right! That brings me to the next topic." Tony claps his hands together in a false act of bravado, and he really doesn't know how they're going to react to what he says next, "I'm not entirely mad about this, by the way; because you didn't know the consequences that would come along with it, but uh -- you've been keeping in contact with Howard, haven't you?"
Steve pulls back enough so they're looking at each other, and he's licking at his swollen lips. While his eyes are still blown wide with desire, he looks cautious and unsure of what Tony's proposing. He's searching Tony's face, looking for a sign of hesitation or confusion, but finds nothing there.
Natasha turns and walks back out of the room, and both Steve and Bucky realize it means they're supposed to follow. They do, walking side by side the same way they always had, having each other's backs in a world they felt out of place in.
Pepper's soft voice calls out from over the phone, and he can just imagine her face crinkled in worry, "
, of all people. Despite the very little care or respect they had for each other, Howard thought it was necessary to tell him it's his turn. He thinks about it for a second. Okay, yeah, it's his turn to run Stark Industries. It's what he was raised to do; but that's common knowledge. That's why he spent so much time studying engineering.
Sure, Steve didn't know about all of that before; but he had an inkling. Tony still refered to the pack as Steve's, even though they've all been trying to include him more. Tony's afraid of being vulnerable, and spends more time lost in his thoughts than engaging in conversation; but does it make Steve a bad guy for wanting to make Tony part of
, but he's also so desperate to feel him already. By the time the fourth finger is in there, he's already sore from the stretching and tempted to just fuck himself to completion on Steve's hand.
When they pull back again, Steve looks in the direction of the couch with his lips pressed into a firm line. He looks like he doesn't want to spend the rest of the night alone. Tony can't blame him for that. He, too, hates sleeping alone after a nightmare.
She turns to leave, even though there's no real way of leaving the sanctum without Stephen's assistance; and though Vision flashes Steve an apologetic grimace, he rises to leave with her.
." And his voice is as cold as ice as he brings his hands together; but just before his hands meet and his plan is executed, orange light fills the room.
"He's part of our pack, James." Steve tells him, partly to reassure him, but partly to drive the idea into the man's head, "We look out for our own."
No, He really doesn't mean it, but he wants to. He's only just met Steve and he knows it, and yet, he doesn't want to lose his mate. But he doesn't want to be selfish, either, and he hates that Steve and his
He assesses them calmly, his eyes flitting over them and his lips curled back into a frown like there's something out of place he just can't put his finger on.
The stool topples over from the level of exertion, but Steve doesn't pay that any mind. Steve's lips are demanding as they press against his own, teeth clashing against his own in an act of desperation. Steve's arms are tight as they grip onto his waist, and Tony's only barely aware of Steve lifting him up. Steve's lips don't pull back even a hairline of a distance away as Tony's deposited onto the top of the worktable, and Tony ignores the way the toolkit is digging into his back. He can't really really focus on anything but the feel of Steve's tongue rubbing across his own. Steve bites at his lower lip, sucking on it roughly as he uses his knee to nudge Tony's feet apart. He tucks himself between Tony's parted legs, and Tony shudders as he feels Steve's erection pressed against his own growing one.
that he's not saying. Sometimes, even knowing with all their heart, the little reassurances make unbearable situations like this easier to deal with.
The team spaces itself out, everyone grabbing for whatever weapon they had on hand. Steve doesn't have any weapons; and while normally he didn't need his shield to fight a foe, Tony Stark had always been a cunning rival.
"What did that wall do to you?" Sam asks, full of amusement as he lowers a mug of coffee onto the workbench.
Just as Tony manages to draw his thumb against those astonishingly gorgeous lips, however, Steve's hand shoots up and latches tightly around his wrist. It's not to push him away like he thinks at first; but to keep it steady so Steve can pepper his knuckles with little kisses. They're silent at first, and Tony basks in the warmth and gentle affection that Steve is bathing him in.
"Don't remind me." Tony grunts as he turns to pour himself yet another mug of coffee, "I haven't been building in years. I'm getting sloppy in my older years."
He goes into the closet in the bedroom he shares with Steve, crouching down to move boxes that are carefully concealing the Iron Man armor that was carefully designed into a briefcase. It doesn't have the same firepower as some of his other suits, but it'll do in a pinch and he refuses to go anywhere without at least one armor on hand.
Yeah, what happened in Siberia was rough and could've gone a lot better. In hindsight, if he'd known that they'd end up fighting to the death on the side of a mountain, he'd have told Tony the truth ahead of time.
Steve shoots him a glance that's full of bemusement, but his features soften as he lifts a hand and brings it to Tony's face. The brunet feels his heart skip a beat as he angles into the touch, and Steve carefully wipes a smudge of what's probably motor oil from his forehead. Tony finds he's baffled by Steve's penchance to take care of him.
That's horrible, Tony decides. Steve is a masochist and needs some sort of psychiatric help. That's really all there is to it. Diving into the water to save someone you don't even know? Learning that you're fated to be with him so you follow him for two years even though he's made it clear he wants nothing to do with you?
Halfway there, Tony tells himself; and he gives Steve's wrist another tug. Steve abandons his self-imposed duty and turns fully in his direction, though his hands remain pressed against the counter.
Confusion hits him hard. Is Steve angry because he doesn't want to go to the funeral? Is he angry because Tony can't bring himself to mourn over a father who was barely present in his life?
He gets up and leaves before Tony can get a word in edgewise. That night, Tony eats dinner alone in a house that doesn't feel like home with a husband that is so close yet so far away.
Now it's Steve's turn to blink, and then an eyebrow raises in skepticism as he leans back on the bench, "Is this you kicking me out?"
"So what of it? Why have this conversation at all?" Wanda retorts, and her fingertips are twitching as red wisps of power escape them, "He's an enemy, so we take him down. Correct?"
"Wanda tried to remove the stone from my skull but couldn't keep her powers stabilized." Vision explains, pressing the tips of his fingers to his forehead as a thoughtful frown forces its way onto his face, "I managed to get away and went to Wakanda to ask for Princess Shuri to remove the stone safely."
"I'm being manipulated? Shocker." Tony strides forward in a much calmer walk, his eyebrow raised and his hands tucked into his pockets as he squares off in front of Wanda.
"Why protect us and bring us home if you're so hell bent on killing us?" Scott demands, his voice going up an octave in an almost hysterical tone.
That choice of wording seems to do the trick, and Steve nods to himself in determination. Instead of taking his hand and just walking together into the bedroom, he uses the offered hand as leverage and hooks his other arm under Tony's legs.
hi so it’s come to my attention that the story is heavily not cap-team friendly, and I just wanted to apologize about that. I’m not intentionally making it as such because I will always love the original MCU-verse Avengers team. they’re all dumb fucks but we love them despite it.
Steve seems to be having an internal war of his own, "You won't even see me again. It won't be like today. I'll just watch from the distance to make sure you're okay."
Tony doesn't even go in for a while. He stares around him at the area for a long while, then takes a seat on the front porch with a defeated sigh. It wasn't their most popular vacation spot, really, but even as a kid, Tony had felt strangely compelled by this beautiful, bif house. As he overlooks the expanse of the front yard, he can't help the melancholy that fills him. He remembers when he was young, running joyfully across the yard with his butler, Jarvis, and his wife, Ana, playing with him. Maria, his mom, would watch from the porch where Tony had been sitting.
"How do I help a man who does his best to shut me out?" Steve asks, frustrated as he runs a shaky hand through his hair. He's good at reading people, usually; and for the most part, he's good at reading Tony. But for something like this? Tony chose to shut him out. Tony chose to brave this on his own. How was Steve supposed to be able to protect someone who didn't want his protection?
"You can stay, too." Tony tells the group, and he pretends not to have seen the sheer surprise on their faces, "There are plenty of rooms. Some of you look like you could really use a shower."
In the morning, Tony wakes up feeling sweaty and warm in the best of ways. It's not even morning, the sun isn't peeking through the blinds and the gentle snores coming from behind him tell him it's too early to be awake; and yet, his brain is buzzing with activity. His back is pressed against Steve's chest still, the blond's arm draped carefully over his waist and holding him like a stuffed animal. He grins at the thought and shifts as carefully as he's able so that he can see Steve's face.
"I'll attack even before you manage to let go of that arrow, Barton," Tony warns, and it's incredible that he can feel Clint readying his bow without even looking in the archer's direction. Instead, he's looking at Bucky like the man's a puzzle he can't seem to figure out, "Its my understanding that I misjudged you back in Siberia. As such, I have no qualms with you. Get out of here now before it gets messy."
Steve frowns like it should be obvious, then raises his shoulder in a shrug, "You're home earlier than you usually are."
"Are you really going to just sit back and let them blackmail you?" Steve asks, and Tony finds himself hating, once more, that Steve's anger is directed towards him.
That catches Tony's attention. It's blackmail, plain and simple. If Howard finds him, there's no telling what he'll do. He's not entirely sure why Howard hasn't come looking for him personally, yet, but he's sure it has something to do with how Tony hasn't been designing weapons.
Just like that, Tony snaps out of it. At least, he's able to pretend he has. He would be leaving in the morning as it is, there's no reason to get himself anxious about old memories.
The first thing he does when he gets to his private floor is grab a bottle of whiskey. His favorite kind, he thinks; a present from Howard when he graduated high school as a teenager. He never actually went to the graduation for his son. and while the rest of Tony's older classmates had proud family members cheering for him, Tony was alone. And yeah, maybe it was just that Howard was incapable of showing him love; but was he really at fault for not
Except he regrets his seating choice when he finds himself at eye level with Steve focusing on him with a heightened interest. Natasha reappears, and Steve stands momentarily so she can slide into the booth. At full height, Tony really feels like fate is playing one giant prank on him. Really? Does the guy
kill Tony, but at least they can keep an eye on her in the meantime. Scott follows them through without a second glance, rubbing at the back of his neck out of what was possibly shame.
Steve pulls out and Tony winces as he allows his sore legs to hit the bed again. The blond disappears in all his naked glory, coming back with a wet towel and lovingly cleaning Tony off like he's a priceless work of art.
Tony's on top of him, now, and he looks down to see Steve's eyes full of love and want. Steve has so much self control that it's baffling to him. He ducks his head, capturing Steve's lips in another searing kiss. Steve responds immediately, their tongues brushing against one another, the push and pull between them urging him forward. When he pulls back this time, it's so that he can shimmy down Steve's torso, and Steve watches silently, questions dancing in his gaze until Tony is tucked firmly between his parted legs.
And that time, he could hear it -- well, most of it. It cut out here and there, but he could get the gist of it even without the complete connection of the words. Steve counts as he breathes in, holds his breath, and releases; and Tony forces himself to follow along. It's hard going at first, but after so many labored breath cycles, he's managed to calm himself down a little. Beyond Steve, Rhodey is watching them with a fond gaze on his face. Tony makes a note to ask about it later, but doesn't dwell on it too much.
It's meant to be a joke, but he sees the way all four of them tense like they're not sure of his intentions. He bites back the roll of his eyes, as difficult as that is for him, and turns his attention to Steve. The blond is staring right back at him, eyes narrowed ever so slightly as if he's trying to assess him. Tony tries to keep his shoulders squared, really, but can tell his face is flushing from the attention. Curse that mate dynamic, really.
He settles himself onto the bed beside the brunet, reaching a hand out to gently cradle the side of Tony's head, and leans forward to brush their lips together. The kiss is salty due to Tony's tears, and Steve won't pretend he hasn't shed a few of his own. Tony doesn't seem to mind that he's crying, though, so there's no need to dwell onit. Tony responds into the kiss, pressing forward and allowing all of his anguish to flow through their entangled lips. There's a lot being said in the kiss that Tony can never seem to get out in person; the apologies for shutting him out, the fear of watching him get hurt, the love that makes him want to stay in Steve's arms forever.
"I am the head sorcerer of the sanctum, and because of such, I am the protector of the spiritual world that is now being threatened by Tony Stark," he explains, sitting back in his chair and crossing his arms in a way that screams intimidation.
It's not the fancy kind of coffee maker, and yet, Tony stares in awe as the coffee drips into the carafe. Just a few more minutes, now, and he'll have all the caffeine he could need to get through the day. He mulls over the previous day's events in his head as he waits, feeling nervous and giddy all at once. Steve's pack was welcoming towards him, of course, with the exception of Bucky, but he couldn't help but wonder what their thoughts of him were. After all, even though he was fated to be their alpha's mate, he could still be considered as an outsider in their midst.
"Before any of that," Natasha cuts in, her tone patient but her fingers clenched on the hard surface of the dining table, "What do you know about the situation?"
Tony leans his head just enough to take a look at the blond, counting the long, beautiful lashes that caress his pale cheeks. His eyes are at half mass, lips quirked ever so slightly into a smile. They've been married for weeks, but moments like these are rare and they've yet to even have their first kiss. He knows it's not the norm for a married couple, and yet, he likes knowing they're not rushed into anything with each other.
"Pass." Tony answers, holding a palm out to reject the offer. He's about to turn and blast off, because now that the threat is neutralized he can go looking for Steve to make sure he's okay; but he's halted by a strong hand pressing down onto his shoulder.
"Enjoy this with me now, instead." Steve responds, and even though he's straining for relief and his body is convulsing from holding back his orgasm, he sounds so composed that Tony's thoroughly impressed.
"Wanda." Sam barks out, and there's a warning somewhere in his tone that everyone seems to still at after hearing.
"I'm like a cold, you'll never see me coming until I hit." Tony quips back; and despite not knowing Hawkeye very well, they've always been able to banter easily.
Of course he was. Tony laughs, and it's a hollow, bitter sound. So, Howard had sent Steve and his pack after him under the guise of a lapse of judgement. Or maybe it was Obadiah that had convinced him of that. Either way, Tony feels appalled at the information shared.
Suddenly, it's not a villain he's looking at, or a bitter rival or a man who forces himself to act nonchalant at the worst times. Instead, he sees someone who thinks he's failed the most important person to him and threw himself into his grief.
"Tony we're here as friends," Natasha tells him, as calm as the genius himself had been and still gripping onto her batons in case he were to attack. She wanted to trust him, they all did; and yet, after the last time they'd seen each other, was it possible to be unguarded.
"Oh, wow," Bruce says with a low whistle, from where he's frozen at the end of the group, "This is such a great set up."
There's a shuffling sound being heard from over the line and Tony waits, because it really is 3 AM and maybe Pepper really had been in bed. She waited two years to hear from him, really, he could wait a few minutes.
The mug in his hand tumbles to the floor and shatters; and that's the sound that startles Tony out of his thoughts.
His hand slips down towards their crotches, and he's not sure if Steve knows what he's attempting or not, but Tony manages to slip his hand under the waistband of Steve's sweatpants. He's not wearing underwear, and Tony bites back the smirk for until later. This is prime teasing material, after all. Steve only seems to snap himself out of his daze when Tony's slim, calloused fingers curl around the base of his cock, and the blond growls against Tony's skin, bucking into the touch. Tony sees that as a growl of approval, and he's pleased to know Steve wants him as much as Tony wants Steve.
hi so yes this is my second chapter update today so if you haven't read in a while, please read the chapter before this first. thank you for your time and attention.
They catch up on everything they've missed about each other. Tony tells her about his travels; about the new places and people he's seen and all the odd jobs he's taken up to afford his current lifestyle. She offers to send him some money, but he just pretends not to have heard it at all.
"Come! Join us for dinner!" The burly blond man calls out, and Tony's taken aback by the childlike joy in his tone, "Steven! Anthony! Samuel has been regaling us with tales from his previous battles!"
She doesn't say anything, but her posture screams rage and a beam of metal gets shot out of her hand. It's in the shape of a dagger; and of course it wouldn't be that easy to get Tony back onto their side.
"Steve. Tony. Knock it off." Bucky growls, and he reaches forward to grab onto Steve's shoulder and yank him backward. Everyone else just stares between them with expressions varying from horror to disblief.
The rest of the team had turned off comms after ten straight minutes of Iron Man and Captain America arguing about the best way to take care of the bots. Which, really, shouldn't be an issue because Iron Man is the most technologically savvy person on the team. Unfortunately, Captain America has control issues and Iron Man isn't much of a follower.
"No, this is necessary. Just give me a second." Tony says with a palm out, like he's begging for a second to breathe. No one moves, and the silence is so
The only two left standing are Bucky and Steve, and Steve's suddenly brought back to that bunker where everything had changed.
"Steve?" He rasps out, and he winces at the dryness of his throat. That won't be pretty come morning, but that's a thought for the morning, not for right now.
"So what do we do?" Clint demands, his eyes alight as he jumps up from the sofa in a bout of pure rage-fueled adrenaline.
"You don't look like you want us here so why did you bring us here?" Bucky asks, because he doesn't have any reason to fear anyone. His brainwashing days are over, and he's already done so much to prove himself ever since.
Tony wants to say no. That they don't need to talk, because what would they talk about? Captain America and Iron Man get along like water and oil.
"In another reality, you didn't tell him the truth; and much like this reality, you would've fought in Berlin and the team would divided, but James Rhodes would have fractured his spine instead of dying outright. Stark would then use pieces of the Extremis formula to promote and encourage healing, and they would both move on from what happened.
"I want my hands on you all the time." Steve conceded his point, and he straddles Tony's hips easily, his head tipping down to press teasing kisses along the side of Tony's neck.
A sharp inhale is heard over the line, and Tony's head drops even though no one's around to see it. It feels awful just to know he's doing this to someone else, especially someone like Steve. The blond breathes deeply, then releases a shallow, empty chuckle, "
"Which one do I shoot?" Clint asks, running his tongue over his upper lip as his gaze darts between Tony and Wanda.
Steve stares after his fading back, and then he gathers his courage and stands up to go to Tony's room. Bucky's right, of course. No matter what Tony's thinking about the whole thing, he would just have to be patient and willing to listen. He had once told Tony he would break his heart a million times over to stay close; and that hasn't changed.
It doesn't take too long from there, and Steve thrusts into his face with desperation. Tony can feel it when Steve's about to release, and Steve tugs at his hair to try and pry him off. Determined and greedy enough to want the taste of Steve to coat his tongue, Tony brings his hand down to fondle at Steve's balls. Just a brush of his knuckles or two later, and Steve grunts as he releases into Tony's mouth.
"Now I'm going to pretend you're being a good host, Tones, and take that coffee off your hands." Rhodey really is such a little shit, and Tony's admittedly a little too distracted to be able to stop the man from taking his coffee mug out of his hands.
"Sorry for cutting into your hang out time with Bucky." Tony responds; and he knows he sounds like a petulant child.
When he gets to the fight, Hawkeye is falling from the side of a building. Iron Man swoops down, catching him by the back of his suit easily.
"Dude, if you didn't look like you were going to kill us with that glass, that would've been so impressive." Clint snorts, but it's void of amusement, and Tony can't bother to fake a laugh.
He reached out and gripped Tony’s chin, bringing Tony’s whole body a little closer. Suddenly there was no wall between them, and Tony’s careful efforts to separate them were being demolished. They were so close, Tony could feel Steve’s breath on his lips. His eyes widened when Steve tipped his head to the side but he couldn’t stop him from doing it. He was too shocked to be anything more than putty in Steve’s grip.
He wouldn’t survive for much longer, he knew. He had lost what little weight he had since he’d woken up, and found his body gasping for breath more with each day. He couldn’t really explore much outside of his bunker anymore and he’d started to notice a strange rash on his left hand and a mild cough in his lungs.
The grey dusty smog is gone. It’s bluer and more fresh than ever. And sounds come back to him in slow waves but it doesn’t sound like there’s danger.
“I know you know what I’m talking about.” Steve carried on and pushed himself up on his elbows to look Tony in the eye. “This thing? This thing we have between us? It’s more. We have something more.”
“I...I don’t know.” Tony said quietly, sitting back up slowly and suddenly feeling his eyes begin to burn. His head was spinning and he felt really sick suddenly. The world felt like it was going underwater.
The sound was music to Steve’s ears and determined, he tightened his grip on Tony’s chin, holding the needle in place. It wasn’t done yet.
“I’ll buy this area. We’ll use it to make it their home. They’re all pretty small so they need regular food and drink, especially this one here.” Tony pointed out and when he turned to look at the snuggling collection of tsums, he thought he saw the beginnings of hope in their eyes. Tony could understand. It must’ve been so hard to see strangers wondering around the closest thing to home.
There was a pause where Tony could feel the stares on him and then Steve sucked in a deep breath. He exhaled and then-
“Okay, great.” Tony said eagerly, leaning forward. “So you’re interested in the company. We can definitely work with-“
“I’m sorry. I should’ve tried harder, I guess.” Tony choked, barely managing to contain his sobs. He lifted his arms and latched onto Steve too. He felt he’d break if he let go now.
“It’s also your favorite color.” He smiles and then straightens it out and wraps it around Tony’s shoulders, allowing the scent to flood Tony’s senses and make him feel so warm.
"I know. I know how they all feel about me. I guess this is his way of setting me straight." He said, feeling empty. Anyone could take a shot at him right now, he wouldn't care. Anything was better than feeling like this.
He took a few moments to gather his things. Methodically, he put his clothes on one side of his suitcase, and his shoes on the other. But as he swept his hand under the bed, his hand scraped against something sharp.
-is standing in that same long trench-coat that hides almost everything. But now Tony can see the hint of the star from his uniform peeking under the coat, and the red boots that Tony is all too familiar with on his feet.
He’d stayed true to himself. He did well in boarding school, graduated from MIT with flying colors and later went on to take some projects on for SI.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief. Behind them, the airlock doors hissed open and Thor walked in, looking wary.
"Steve?" Tony called out when Steve reached out for his phone and began to tap a number into the screen. Maria Hill appeared on the screen.
. That my alpha and I have been trying for months. That must mean I have an alpha that loves me right?” Tony begs and he doesn’t know why but he needs to know, he needs to hear it. He’s so afraid of the idea that he’s become one of those omegas that doesn’t have an alpha-that was just used and left behind to become another statistic.
It was more than enough to make Tony pause. Carefully, he set the torch back down, giving himself something to do while he compiled his thoughts.
“You’re that one! The vampire I saw. You’re a leach!” He snapped, tightening his grip and making the armor creak a little. Still, Tony couldn’t help the smirk that reached his lips.
If he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend it was his building and this was just another day in his life as head of Stark Industries. No financial burdens and no news to catch up on. Just him and his life’s work and the team and Ironman.
The sight of the blue-eyed brunette irritated Steve. Because of Mr.Stark’s lack of consideration, Iron man had barely any time to rest and relax. Recuperation was important, regardless of superhuman strength, Steve knew. Fights could take it out of you.
Ensuring his boots and chest plate was secure, he dusted the torn parts of the gold mesh on his arms and legs and stood tall. He had to get ready first.
But who would he call? Rhodey who was out of town? Pepper who was busy running a company and on a business trip?
“Please be careful. Think about it. Captain America, your teammate is a lot less likely to hurt you. And Ty was an asshole. Seriously, you’re lucky Rhodey’s out of the country otherwise he’d destroy Ty and get you out of this mess. The only reason I’m not interfering is because I know Steve’s keeping an eye on you.”
Tony really couldn’t be bothered with Zeke right now. He was more than happy to spend his time thinking about Steve and Manhattan. Honestly Zeke could go-
“You’re gonna go for it. Because it’ll help you. And I’m gonna say you should because you know me. You know I won’t go back on my word. I know how important your employees are to you.”
Heat began to pool in Tony’s stomach. Like molten lava churning and boiling him from the inside. Steve just made him so
Shivers and tremors start to course through his body. His hands shake and his throat begins to close.
That was simply another way of saying Whitney would cause trouble at home. Exhibit A was this cavern fight. Tomorrow it would be some taunts in his direction. Tony couldn’t
l, they say. And the whole world knows it, but more than that, Dugan and I know it too. And do you wanna know what I turned to Dugan and said?”
“Stark? What did you say?” Fury asked, swirling his drink a little. Tony watched the bubbles rise up in the glass and sucked in a breath.
The Avengers began living with him shortly after that. And had seemed to make themselves pretty comfortable.
“I’m sorry I yelled at you. I know it doesn’t help you feel more comfortable around me but I just-“ Steve rubbed his neck and blew out a frustrated breath. For once he looked pretty helpless. “I want you to be...to feel...safe around me.”
He kept his eyes closed, just relaxing and allowing himself to sink into the soft warmth, wondering why he was struggling to open his eyes so much.
" Tony felt something begin to build up in his chest. Like molten lava threatening to spill. He was dangerously close to losing it all.
“GET OUT!” Steve screamed and Tony had never seen a fully grown man scramble so quickly in his life. The door swung shut behind him, granting them silence again.
. Dust in the wind.” Tony says and smiles, eyeing a certain book collecting dust in the corner of the room. “My sun is back.”
Tony watched the Adonis leave and shook his head. What was the world coming to if Captain America had time to take Ironman for waist measurements?
“I was just trying to help. Ugh, what the hell was that?” The same khaki-wearing blond wheezed, rubbing at his chest gently. After a moment, he sucked in a breath and stood straight, searching Tony with those golden eyes of his.
, nods tensely and steps forward like a man treading through snow. He walks slowly and carefully but reveals himself in the light completely for Tony to see.
“I don’t even know where I’m going.” He mumbled, slumping ever so slightly. Was this a ploy against him? Some elaborate plan to mock him and his feelings?
“I have a choice.” Tony said mildly, lifting his chin up to look down at the man. “I just figured this might be worth a shot. But if you’re not interested then neither am I.”
”Despite what you think of me, I don’t actually have it in me to fight anymore. You’re better off talking to an Avenger. I’m just a lab assistant. Just like you said.”
“This is Anthony Stane. My loyal and trusted pet. He’s done everything he can to support the faction.” Zeke praised making Tony’s hair stand on end. He sounded like he was making a sales pitch like the ones his father used to make.
“Steve!” Tony screeched and once again began to fidget but didn’t get far because of the cuff-like grip on his hands. Without wasting any time, Steve forced Tony back down until his was flat on his back and let go to shove the blanket edges into Tony’s sweaty palms. Reflexively, Tony held on and scrunched up the fabric tight, fingers so forced they would’ve dug marks into Tony’s palm if there was no cushioning.
For a moment, Fury said nothing. He just stared at Tony with a blank look. Then, his frowned deepened and harsh shadows clouded his expression. His gaze darted to the stain on Tony's shirt.
When he returned that night, something was different. The air felt bleak and full of misery, like the afterglow of a horrid fight. The scent of sweat and blood filled Tony’s nose and this was just in the main hall, and without anyone around.
“Gave me a scare there Tony.” Steve says glancing once at the monitor before looking back down at him. “But you’re okay now. You're doing great, we’ve got you.”
The view of their wedding rings next to Steve’s tags appeared before him. The tears began to well up once again.
The only thing that made it different from prison was the large window at the end. It was transparent and revealed the orange hue of the evening sky. Probably a reminder of the outside world.
“No. But this isn’t a good thing. And Ty...” Zeke turned away, hiding his face in the shadows. “He’s been delayed.”
Back when he was younger and blue-eyed and his father was still alive. Back when he wasn’t reliant on another to keep him alive.
"It's going great." Tony said with a tight-lipped smile, and shrugged despite Steve's scrutinizing stare. "Just like old times."
There was a vague clenching sensation in his stomach. Like something was curling around him and pulling him. What was he supposed to say? Did he say anything?
“Well-“ Tony rocked on the balls of his feet a little. Behind him, he clasped his hands together tightly. “You could send someone you trust to take blood from those areas. Or at least someone to feed so that the area remains claimed.”
“That kind of sounds like a mating bite. If you’re compatible with another wolf or human and bite them, you become bonded to them and vice-versa. Is it like that for vampires?”
Sometimes his palms itched for the the tools he found in the cavern. Sometimes he’d grab a pencil and scribble his thoughts down on paper, staring oddly at his creation when he finished because he couldn’t understand where the idea would come from. Perhaps it was a calling from his previous life.
A wave of pride coursed through Tony's body. Pleased, he lowered his eyes to give himself a moment  to catch his breath when-
As his hand grazed over tiny shards, he realized with a sinking feeling that he knew what it was, and he discovered he was right when his hand brushed against a familiar frame.
“Yep.” Tony breathed, glancing at everything other than his soon to be divorced husband. The lack of decor only made it harder to fake interest, but still, Tony had always been a good actor. A great one, in fact.
, he thought. It was ironic that Steve was sat before him today as they finalised the papers. That they were here on the same day as back then.
“Sorry, I’ll move.” He opened his eyes just a fraction and tried to lift up his head and pull away but Steve didn’t let go. Surprised, Tony looked up.
"Sorry, I was just-caught in the moment." Tony said and heaved a sigh of relief when Steve relaxed and smiled back. Then, Steve guided Tony's left hand to his shoulder and took the other in his own.
“Are you really gonna be like that?” Tony finally said, feeling his anger start to spill at the seams. He’d dealt with a lot of people like this before but-
They live in Steve's apartment, but that's only because that's where they started. Tony would more than prefer to live in his private penthouse overlooking the city; but Steve's had no interest in moving in and Tony figured it would be a change of scenery.
Everything was good. The team, broken as it may be and mourning over the loss of cherished teammates they thought and hoped to fight alongside forever, was still fighting against all odds in any capacity they could.
Tony shuts the door behind him before even turning in Steve's direction, and his expression is both resigned and bemused, "Trust me. I do want to punch your perfect, white teeth; but I don't think your friends would appreciate that."
"It's not about you using me, Steve." Tony insists, raising his hands to cup Steve's perfectly chiseled face in his hands and stroke at the pale cheeks using his thumbs, "We're married now, and I want to take care of you like you take care of me. I know you've got this whole idea in your head of being the sole provider, but honey, I'm a multi-billionaire. If we don't use my money, no one will."
"I was there for that." Sam says, and his voice is quiet but rushed. Tony turns to him in surprise, but the former army's head is bowed forward with his hands gripping firmly on his knees, "I was in the Pararescue team. I didn't know it was you until now, but we got the intel that a convoy was attacked and the only bodies there weren't moving. I've seen what those missles do, I know how dangerous they are."
Tony Stark. You should've seen the look on that guy's face when he talked about you. Dude lit up like the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Centre."
Feeling admonished, Tony just manages to stare at the blond's back in shock as he sets about to do what he'd suggested. The second plate of food placed in front of him looks about as appetizing as the first had, but Steve gives him a daring look over his shoulder as a jerky Bucky follows after him. Rhodey is silent for a second longer than Tony would have expected from the man, his eyes doing another sweep of the room before it lands on Steve across from them.
Stepping into the sanctum with Tony in tow is another feeling all together. It might be the experiences that are added together for Steve, but when the person you're facing decides to step back (Loki), it just feels too good to be true.
?" James spits out, and his whole face lights up in fury. He's about to shoot up from his chair, his gaze darting back to Steve, "What type of threat?"
Tony waits a beat, like he's trying to see if he's being made fun of for it. When he doesn't see anything in the group that would cause for him to scurry away, he turns around and waves a hand behind him, "Come on. The elevator's on the other side of the workshop."
"What does that even mean?" Scott asks, running a hand through his hair in an anxious movement that Steve finds himself mirroring, "What do we do about that? He wants us all dead and if he was willing to blow up his own compound there's no saying where he'll stop."
Steve has one of those dimmer light switches, and Tony slowly raises the light. It's just enough to see what's going on; but when the light is on, Tony finds that no one had broken into the apartment. Instead, Steve is curled into a ball on the long couch and he's too far into his nightmare to realize it's not reality.
. He mills every last drop out of Steve, swirling his tongue around the head just one more time to clean him up fully, and releases Steve's now flaccid dick. He's going to bring the back of his hand up to wipe his mouth, but Steve still has his hands pressed against Tony's head.
It's as he's thinking it that the phone buzzes, and he switches applications to get to the message inbox.
They knew this already, but it still hurt to hear. Tony had only come to Berlin to try and get them to come back; to find a solution to their problem without having any unnecessary blood shed. Unfortunately, Steve had a lot to lose during that fight and couldn’t be dissuaded from it; and in the end, it was Rhodey who paid the price with his life.
All of a sudden, he can't breathe. It's like he just managed to forget how, because his brain is too busy thinking about
"Can I be a part of the planning for my own wedding?" Steve asks the group, and everyone looks at him for a moment and shake their heads. It's like a silent agreement had passed through them. Tony laughs harder than he should, and ends up with a hand pressed onto his stomach as he folds forward. Steve looks beyond betrayed, but seems to give up on defending himself.
"I'm up next," he sounds out; and when he hears it out loud, he knows the truth, "Obadiah is going to kill me."
"What are you saying, Tony?" Steve dares in a quiet tone, eyebrows furrowed and eyes gleaming with unshed tears.
Tony closes his eyes like he's trying to snap a picture, ingraining this image of Steve into his memories and finding himself immensely grateful at finally knowing what words to say to make himself feel like he's not bringing disappointment to the alpha.
Tony ignores him, moving to the dresser and opening one of the drawers of his side of it. He doesn't have many clothes here, seeing as he does still have the penthouse, but his body is aching for a hot shower and some painkillers.
“Even so!” Wanda shouts, raising a shaky finger in Natasha’s direction like she can’t understand why the spy would defend Tony, “We were sent to prison! It’s only because Steve came back for us that we even have our freedom!”
"Talk to me, sweetheart." The words are gentle and Steve's tone is soft, but there's still that stern quality that Tony finds hard to resist.
"Just lift your hips and enjoy this." Tony responds, and after a heartbeat, Steve lifts his hips. Tony makes quick work of tugging the sweatpants down, and he swallows heavily at the size of Steve's dick. Feeling it in his hand was one thing, but imagining it in his mouth is another.
Natasha looks at him increduously, and Tony really hates it when people look at him like he's stupid, "We follow you. Did you forget?"
Rhodey is silent for a long moment, which is good, because it allows Tony to pull into his head. Everyone else is quiet, too, trying so hard to act like they're not fully invested in the conversation, but Tony's not able to think about them. Obadiah knew of the damage that the Jericho had done; even more than Howard himself did. Sure, he didn't love Obadiah, and sure, he was threatening people that had nothing to do with them so that Tony would build him more weaponry -- but ... is Obadiah really the type of man that would steal his blueprints and sell them anyway when he knows the engineer's strong feelings opposing of it?
Tony straightens his back, and he bends down in order to pick a knife off the floor. Steve and Bucky look at each other in concern because they're not sure what Tony's planning to do -
"I dreamt about you." Steve admits as he pulls away from their kiss. His eyes are still blown wide in pleasure, his face red and his lips swollen from the intensity of their kiss. His hips have stilled, but he refuses to move away, "I dreamt that you went out in an alien invasion and I couldn't get to you in time."
"I did." Steve agrees, and he leans over Tony's shoulder to look the brunet in the eye, "I said that I love you."
"Everyone sit, please." Is all Tony responds with, and his voice is a little harder than it probably should be. Everyone seems to freeze, and he's not sure what's racing through their minds, but he lowers himself onto the edge of the tv stand in an attempt to appease them, "We need to have a little heart to heart, as much as it pains me."
"Tony, you stole my heart the moment I found you trapped in a car, drowning." Steve tells him, and all of his anger is gone as he leans forward and brushes his lips against Tony's temple, "I never thought I would see you open your eyes again. I'll take every bit of me you give. It's got nothing to do with fate, or settling. It's knowing I could've lost the most important person in my world and then being given another chance with him."
Fury calls Natasha as soon as they arrive back at the mansion and chews her ear off for not only leaving without authorization from air control, but for almost unleashing the Hulk on his ship again, but she knows it's just for show. She can hear in his voice that Bruce has told him what they'd found out, and that he's just as upset as they are.
Steve smiles a decidedly evil smile and puts his hands back on Tony’s shoulders, pinning him to the bed with a salacious grin that could melt steel. He doesn’t respond, just leans down and kisses Tony, hard and dirty. It’s everything Tony has ever wanted or dreamed of kissing Steve to be. It’s full of passion and heat, with just the barest undertone of warmth and caring. Steve licks along the seal of his lips, as though asking for permission. Tony opens his mouth just a sliver, and Steve takes it the rest of the way, forcing his way in, twirling their tongues together, sucking Tony’s bottom lip into his mouth, and nipping at it ever so slightly.
“I have to finish these calculations, Tony.” Bruce responds easily, sliding his chair to the side and looking around Tony. “Besides, integrating alien tech into new weaponry is way more your department than it is mine.”
"Good idea. And if there's an emergency, Mjolnir can just rip through the vault anyway," Tasha reassures Thor with a smile, "JARVIS..."
Clint and Natasha both jump out of bed and race down the hall to the boys' bedroom, flinging the door open. Both beds are empty, and there are several sets of clothes missing from the pile on the dresser. Thor comes up behind them, breathing heavily, having obviously received the same message from JARVIS.
The jet lands at the mansion in record time, and she jumps out before they've even finished landing, trusting JARVIS to stow the plane safely. She rushes into the living room to find Steve and Tony standing in their 'punishment' position, feet shoulder width apart and hands clasped tightly behind their backs, staring at the floor. It takes her another second to find Clint. When she does, her heart nearly breaks.
“The ambulance. The sky. The...people behind you. My hands.” Which were shaking badly in his lap. Slowly he closed them and opened them, trying to get them to warm up a little. “Your pen-light.”
“He shouldn’t have done that!” Tony snarled and yanked his hand away from Clint. “He has a mate to think about!”
"I love you." Tony says quietly and Steve stills before letting out a gasp and squeezing him tighter.
Steve jerks sharply at that. His blue eyes narrow and meet Tony's head on. He looks in control but Tony can see how much his lips are trembling. The tears are still falling.
Strange looks at him and swallows and Steve resists the urge to close his eyes and never wake up. It’s like being in the ice all over again.
“No, that’s okay. You’ve been a great host Steve, really.” Tony held up a hand and tentatively rested it on the table beside Steve’s joint ones.
The research and development department had separate living quarters to other departments. This group of twenty had a large living area equipped with couches, a TV, pool table and a couple of chairs and tables.
“I have an idea.” Ty says brightly and gesture between himself and Captain America who’s eyeing him like he's mud under his shoe. “Why don’t we take turns? I sleep with you on one night, he sleeps with you the next? We can do it that way. I don’t mind.”
“Well, it’s pretty obvious it was a group effort.” Tony laughs softly, blinking tiredly at the baby. “You can have twelve percent.”
“I’m fine. But I think I might’ve found something.” He said, inching closer with his shield out. His eyes were glued to the mystery spot where his foot had connected with something. He prayed it was good news.
“Hop on.” He repeated and this time, Tony didn’t hesitate. He quickly jumped on and instantly grabbed Steve’s waist when they went shooting down the tarmac.
“I-I don’t want you to feel obliged.” He explained, though even he could tell that had been a pretty pathetic attempt.
"Forget the SHRA. Forget everything for a minute." Steve says quietly and hugs him again gently. "You didn't even grieve, did you?"
Tony couldn’t stop smiling. He could feel his fangs expand with excitement. Today had been the best day of his life!
Releasing a sigh, Tony took a step forward and decided not to interfere. It wasn’t for him to know anyway. It wasn’t his place.
It was still Steve's room, and while he usually had no issues gate-crashing someone's space, being in Steve's bedroom, alone at night with everything he felt for him-
“Well it was fine I guess.” No need to bring Ben up. Not when this was the first time in months Steve had made small talk with him. “How was your day?”
The door swings open quickly and before he knows it, hands spin him around and pull him close against a firm chest. Rogers wraps his arms around him and holds him tightly, gently nuzzling his hair.
“You’re bossy.” Tony blurted and then he clapped a hand over his mouth in awe of his own audacity. Had he really just said that?
The speech stretched on for some time, with every second drawing something new. Steve’s skin tone, the length of his fingers-even the exact pressure of his palm. It was firm enough but didn’t even come close to the maximum strength Steve could use. And Tony knew because he’d done the calculations. Steve’s strength could break bones.
Tony couldn’t handle it. His body shook from the sheer amount of contact. Tears leaked from his eyes as he clutched on with iron grip.
“Steve, what is wrong with you?” She asks and he shakes his head. His eyes search the room once again.
Just then, Tony spotted something just behind Steve. It was poking its little head out of the ball pit and staring up at Steve with a huge wide-eyed stare and Tony couldn’t help but laugh at that.
Tony’s eyes brightened with joy. His lips beamed and his cheeks started to go red. “I actually can’t believe it but at the same time...”
“Let me see.” Tony said excitedly, feeling his heart start to race and Steve handed him the phone with a clear picture. When Tony saw it, he nearly gaped.
“You haven’t seen the set.” Happy cut in, completely nonplussed. “It’s not your usual style. In fact, none of it is.”
”But you owe Shield! You owe everyone your goddamn life!” Ben spat out and leaned over the desk like a man about to pounce. “You get in that damn suit, or you admit fault when everyone gets killed up there because of you. Including your precious Captain.”
Carol sucks in a breath. T’Challa remains silent like an impenetrable wall but he doesn’t seem the same. The Black Panther’s shoulders are sloped. His eyes seem dimmed even through the mask.
A hollow pit formed in his stomach. How he'd thought he could try and hurt Steve like that and not feel a thing afterwards was ridiculous.
Tony thought to himself as he twisted the arm of his latest victim and sunk his teeth in. If the human had been any faster, he may well have dented one of the shins.
“Of course, Captain.” Strange says with a nod and looks him in the eye. Steve immediately notices how tired the man looks. There are deep circles under his eyes, and his facial hair has grown out. So has Reed’s, he notices.
He would go towards it. Perhaps there was a being he could be allies with. Someone to maybe keep him company.
“Oh not at all Mr.Stark! You seem to be doing such a good job, all by yourself.” Stern said, looking smug as the laughs behind him grew. Tony’s hands curled and he let his lips curve up.
Steve sucked in a deep breath and let go. “Losing you because of Ultron, wasn’t worth it. At least not to me.”
When Rhodey had found him, he'd apparently started crying. He didn’t remember it but Rhodey had seen it.
“Look, I’m not asking for much.” Tony explains, or at least tries to and has to stop to suck in a breath and clamp his lips together. His teeth are chattering and the jacket is barely covering his hands.
Carol’s lips tremble. But her eyes are steady and she sucks in a breath. A soldier preparing for war.
“You better stop now before I tear you to pieces.” Rogers says and smiles dangerously when Ty jerks back.
Steve leaned back and looked at him. He didn’t deny it but he didn’t agree either, which made Tony’s heart sink but the Steve reached out and ruffled Tony’s hair gently.
The soup got stuck in his throat and he began to choke much to Steve’s horror. Through the coughs, he dropped the spoon and nearly spilled the soup.
“It’s your smell.” He explained, feeling Tony pause his squirming and freeze like a deer in the headlights.” You and him. You both smell ...”
“What do you do? Are you an officer?” Tony pondered, feeling a smile spread as he watched the spider-kid storm off when Natasha said something.
“What’s the matter!? What’s happen-“ His eyes landed on Tony. His face went slack and he walked towards Tony with his hands outstretched.
They stayed locked in a stare for what felt like eternity. Steve could see it though. The hesitation, the pain, the unbearable
“He’s right though.” Steve said quietly and finally Tony mustered up the courage to look straight at him.
They came to a door at the end of the corridor, and Tony felt his shoulders loosen at the thought of not being with this young woman any longer. Silence always set him on edge, and even more so when there was no one to turn to. It was almost isolating.
"But you don't work with Shield like that." Tony insisted firmly, feeling his fingers curl. "I know him, he's-"
The stand feels cool to touch. Someone has kindly left him some sheets of thin paper with words on them. The plan for this event and a few things to say in case he cant' think of anything. And tissues. There’s a small collection of tissues neatly pinned to the board.
“He’s...beautiful.” Steve whispers too, curling around them and seeming equally mystified by the tiny being in Tony’s arms.
“I don’t think they’re coming in hot, but tell the men not to resist them. I’d like my hellicarrier to stay in the sky,” he answers ruefully, knowing first hand just how easy it would be for the superhero team to destroy his airship. “We’ll keep Stark in interrogation for now.”
"Tell me this isn't real. Tell me it's a bad dream. That I'll wake up. Please," his voice is broken and hopeless as he begs her for a reprieve from what ever horror has shaken him.
The boy in her lap quickly shakes his head, a small look of fear flashing behind his eyes. He glances over to the still sleeping Steve who is resting in Clint’s lap. Hawkeye smiles gently at him, and shifts Steve a little so Tony can see his face.
"Our trainers said my name was one zero four nine six, and my brother's name is one zero four nine five. But you call us Steve and Tony. Why?"
“Tasha called me this morning and told me what happened. I stopped by one of Tony’s storage lockers and brought over some of the toys and books he had as a child. They should keep him entertained, at least for a few days,” she explains, “Any luck on turning him back?”
Fury is caught off guard for a moment. The Captain is the most level headed member of the team, and rarely snaps at anyone. And Fury had honestly thought Rogers would be more thrown by the ‘turned into a child’ part of his explanation, than the ‘cornered’ part. But with everything they’ve seen in the last year or so, he supposes none of them are really surprised by strange things happening anymore.
"By the time we figure out a way to neutralize it, it should have already worked its way out of their systems, but until it does, it might be harder to convince them their training is wrong. Once the effects wear off, they should start having independent thoughts again, and understanding what happened. Though that might be a whole new problem in and of itself."
Tony climbs up on the table and crawls across it, jumping into Clint's arms and sobbing into his neck.
"Whoever those aliens were, they were some kind of galactic slave traders. Call Quill. Have his team start working on finding these bastards and hunting them down. They must have some kind of tech that de-ages the people they capture."
!” Tony exclaims, running from room to room in awe at the mansion’s size, “It’s even bigger than my house!”
Steve and Tony share another look, then Steve nods once. Clint stands and goes to the couch where Natasha is sitting, and places Steve on the seat next to her. Immediately, a hand snakes out of Tony’s blanket and grips Steve’s tightly.
The next morning, Natasha rises early and finds Clint missing from their bed. It doesn't surprise her. She'd had a restless night herself, her sleep filled with nightmares. She can hear the dull thunk of someone hitting Steve's punching bag, and quickly slips into her workout clothes to go and join him. As she heads for the door, she notices Steve sleeping on the floor at the foot of her bed. He wakes when she touches his shoulder and quickly kneels in front of her.
The two boys are heartbreakingly obedient as Bruce takes them down to his lab to look them over. They quietly take off their clothes and sit on the table, sitting close, but no longer holding hands. They are covered in bruises, some old and faded, others that seem to be only hours old. An x-ray shows that Steve's arm is fractured, but thankfully not broken, so Bruce puts it in a small brace to keep it stable while it heals.
"Tony. Steve. I've told you before. You aren't slaves. I'm not your Mistress, and the others aren't your Masters. We're your family. And you don't have to play with the toys if you don't want to, but they're yours to play with if you do. Would you rather watch another movie? Maybe go outside and play in the yard? It's a nice day out."
He gently brushes Tony’s hair out of his face, reveling in the look of peace on the so often stressed features. He remembers the first time they’d met, how they’d done almost nothing but fight for the first month they’d known each other. Then he remembers coming downstairs for breakfast one morning and seeing Tony sitting at the bar in his boxers eating cereal and drinking his morning coffee. His heart had skipped several beats, and for a moment, Steve had thought he was going crazy, that he was just touched deprived, so seeing that much skin had brought his distinctive lack of human comfort to the forefront of his mind. Then it had happened again when Tony had started rambling about some new feature he was adding to his next suit. And they’d both been fully clothed then. It had taken the regression incident for him to finally admit to himself how he felt about the other man, and now… he doesn’t know what to do with those feelings. He wraps his arms a little tighter around Tony.
Natasha looks up from her paper with a look that clearly wants to know if he has suddenly developed a death wish. He sighs and doesn’t let the look get to him. He’s almost completely certain she’d never
“Of course I complained!” Tony defends himself, puffing out air and cuddling closer, hoping Steve doesn't decide to pull away, “I didn’t want you to suspect how I felt. I was denying I was feeling it myself. If you had confronted me then, I would have backed so far into the closet, I would have been in Narnia.”
“You never… why didn’t you say anything?” Steve asks, still trying to wrap his mind around what Tony’s just told him.
Years and years ago, when they first became partners, Clint and Natasha had decided that the best code word for them would be 'honey.' Since neither of them would ever say it to the other under normal circumstances, it was perfect. Over the many missions they've run together, it's been used to mean anything from, 'I've been compromised' to 'request immediate evac.'
you. I’m simply taking advantage of the fact that your… outgoing personality tends to rub a lot of people the wrong way.” Steve says, laying a calming hand on Tony’s arm.
Tony drops his head back onto Steve’s chest and immediately falls back to sleep. Steve lets out a breath he hadn’t been aware he’d been holding. He knows it’s selfish of him, that he should wake Tony up and help him back to his own room, but he’s dreamed of feeling Tony’s body pressed up against his for so long… he just wants to make the moment last as long as possible. And in the morning, he can claim that neither of them woke up when he returned to normal, and they can both put the fact that they cuddled behind them. Well… Tony can put it behind him. Steve knows he’s going to cherish this moment for as long as he lives.
Steve’s heart twinges guiltily. He hadn’t even thought about how Tony would react if he wasn’t there. He gently pries Tony’s arms from his legs and kneels down to apologize to the boy, but Tony has apparently already forgiven him and has much more exciting things he wants to talk about.
“Good,” Steve responds before dropping the subject and returning to the explanation of the plan, “Banner. Thor. Once we land, you two stay with the jet. It won’t do us any good to get Stark and then end up grounded. Hawkeye. Widow. You’re with me. You know the carrier better than any of the rest of us. If things do go south…” He takes a deep breath. He knows they can’t go in without a contingency plan, but he’ll never stop hating the need to have one. “Tasha. Stark is the priority. Find him and get him to the jet. If the rest of us aren’t there, leave us and take him to the mansion. We’ll meet up with you later. Anyone have any questions?”
"Are you sure you're ready?" Steve asks one more time, "I'm okay with waiting until you're ready if you need a little more time."
"Hmmm?" responds Hawk, his head tilting slightly in Tony's direction, but his eyes never leaving the page he's reading.
"Run them by Steve. And have JARVIS record it. I want to see his face contort when you tell him your ideas for naming his weapon. Disc of Death. That's cute, Tony."
“Tony, listen,” Clint starts, voice muffled, “That’s not the bow I was using this morning. I was using a practice bow. And while I appreciate the sentiment, you should have asked before you took my entire bow apart. It’ll take several days to recalibrate it so that it doesn’t snap on me during a mission,” he sits up and looks at Tony, feeling slightly guilty at the scared look on the boy’s face.
Clint is at the archery range the next morning, when Steve comes in and sits on one of the benches. Expecting a conversation, Clint turns to the Captain, but when he doesn't say anything, Hawk shrugs and goes back to his practice. After several minutes of silence, Clint lowers his bow.
Steve nods at Tony, and the boy runs into the room, pouncing on the bed and jumping up and down on it, carefully avoiding feet and legs.
Steve nods in agreement and understanding. He'd been just as shocked as Tony the first time he'd taken off his clothes and really looked at himself. He reaches to pull the covers up over them, but a hand on his wrist stops him.
“I heard you. Every word. And you know…” Tony sits up and flips on the light next to the bed, looking down at Steve, his face unreadable, “I’m not really sure what to say. I
Tony's heart leaps into his throat at the mention of husbands beating their wives, and his traitorous dick takes notice of his excitement. He tamps down firmly on the feeling, because getting aroused at the idea of domestic abuse, culturally acceptable or not, is
Natasha feels her blood run cold at the question. Ice fills her veins, and fear and pain break her heart. She quickly glances around the room and sees the same reaction from all the others. With as much calm as she can muster, which isn’t as much as she normally has, she turns Tony to face her.
"You're not going to be punished. We don't punish people in this house. You didn't do anything wrong. You can both sit where ever you like. JARVIS is the computer that runs this house, and has a huge collection of movies to watch, all you need to do is ask him to turn one on for you. We're having some toys sent over for you to play with," she tucks a hand under each chin and lifts until they are looking her in the eyes, "You aren't our slaves. Do you understand? You're a part of our family now. And we will never let those monsters hurt you ever again."
"Yes. It helps. Thank you," Steve manages to smile credibly at the archer, "Can we just pretend this conversation never happened?"
With a brief word of farewell to everyone, Bruce leaves and heads for the jet. Once he's gone, Thor takes a seat on the floor, setting Mjolnir to the side and looking at his remaining two teammates.
"His heart rate is also elevated, and he has missed twelve of his intended shots due to tears clouding his vision. I have sealed the drawer with the explosive arrowheads, just to be safe."
Unable to come up with any excuse or another reason not to follow the man, and knowing they won't make it very far if they try to run, Tony and Steve get in the back of the man's car. They hold each other's hands tightly, afraid of where they're going, and what will happened to them when they get there.
"Right. Cause the two trained fighters need me around mucking them up. I'll just watch, thank you," Tony responds, with more heat than he had anticipated, or meant.
Once his heart rate returns to something resembling normal, Tony returns the favor, and Steve pulls him close as he nears his own completion, whispering words of love into Tony's ear as he paints the sheets white between them.
"Hey! I like the name. And just to prove how awesome it is, I'm gonna go find Steve right now and tell him the new name." Tony gathers up his tablet and heads for the door, his walk heavy with his usual swagger. Bruce's laugh follows him out the door.
“Tony,” Steve takes the boy’s hand in his, and leans forward in his seat so he can meet his eyes, “You’re coming home with us.”
Clint nods and pulls back on the stick, lifting the quinjet effortlessly into the air. It is ominously quiet while Hawkeye heads them in the right direction before turning the controls over to JARVIS and swiveling the pilot’s chair to face the rest of the group.
Steve holds out his hand towards the boy. He’s still dressed in the adult sized AC/DC shirt he’d been wearing when they’d gone to get him. Steve is almost entirely certain they don’t have any clothes that will actual fit the boy, considering how small he is, but at the very least he needs to change into something that isn’t covered in white powder. Tony runs over to him, leaving a trail of flour behind him.
“Did you actually sleep, Tony?” Steve looks at the clock next to his bed, flopping back down heavily when he sees it’s barely five in the morning.
“I… you…” Tony starts, sitting up slightly and staring at the Captain incredulously for a moment, before sinking back down, “That’s it. You are taking a month long vacation, and you are going to read and watch everything you need to know to get caught up on at least twentieth century references. We can work on the twenty first century a different month.”
“Are you a superhero too, or just a doctor? Do you have powers? Why does the big guy have a hammer? Is this plane really yours? My dad has a plane, but he hasn’t let me ride in it yet. Do you have a secret base? Can I see it?”
"Sshhh. The important thing is that you're safe now," she says, petting his hair and continuing to whisper small comforting nothings to him.
"We must do something, but I agree with Clint that now is not the time to involve a stranger," Thor interrupts before the argument turns into a shouting match, "We are their family and they are ours, we must handle this ourselves."
“Yeah, it is kind of big. But we all live here and having the space is nice sometimes,” Steve admits, following along behind the boy. He points to a door just down the hallway, “That’s going to be your room up there. Although, the bed is kind of big because it’s usually used by an adult.”
"We know our place Mistress Natasha," Tony responds, taking the sketchbook and pencils and setting them on top of the unopened boxes of legos, "We know slaves aren't allowed to play. Thank you for testing us and reminding us of our position in the household. We are ready to work now if you'll show us what needs done."
Natasha's blood runs cold at the code word and the tone in Clint's voice, and she immediately knows that something is terribly, horribly wrong.
"Tony, you need to talk to Steve. Watching him from the shadows like this is borderline stalking behavior."
"Training with Clint," Steve informs him, "We're working on new dodge techniques to keep him from getting hurt if he ends up being in close combat with someone stronger than him."
“Steve, we were just telling Tony that we’re your family. We saved you and brought you home. Do you understand?” Natasha asks quietly of the blond haired boy.
“Thor’s right,” Steve agrees, shifting Tony in his arms slightly and heading for the jet, “Let’s get Tony back to the mansion for now. We can figure everything else out later.”
On the way home the boys both yawn hugely and Thor makes an executive decision that everyone is going back to bed as soon as they get home. Steve and Tony balk at having to sleep alone, so when they get back home, Clint and Thor move all the furniture out of the living room and pull in two king size mattresses and every blanket and pillow in the house and make a giant sleeping fort. Thor settles in the middle with one boy on each side and Clint and Natasha take the outside positions. JARVIS puts on 'Fantasia' and they all settle down and are asleep in no time, happy to be back together as a family.
“But what if… what if he changes back? Then he’ll have an arrow in his chest, and I’m pretty sure that’s bad for his health,” Clint counters.
I know. It's been over a year since I updated this story. And I'm afraid this chapter is woefully short. But I have finally felt like writing again, after so much writer's block and life getting in the way. So, I know it's short, but I hope you still like it. I just wanted to let you all know that I haven't abandoned this story. I still fully intend on finishing it. And there is still darkness yet to come.
“I believe the Hawk has almost completed his checks. We should leave now, before the Director changes his mind,” he states solemnly, eyes continuing to scan the deck for any agents who might decide to challenge them.
hurt me, but it’s kind of thrilling to feel powerless underneath you,” Tony can feel his face turning a million different shades of red as he speaks, hoping his admission won’t ruin the mood, or Steve’s desire to have sex with him. Which he fervently hopes is going to happen. Soon.
know you two have the hots for each other was the two of you. Everyone else's known probably since the beginning. Couple of us even wanted to intervene a few times, but you both looked like you'd run the moment someone said anything, so we opted to leave you alone and make bets instead."
Natasha finds that she very suddenly has to sit. She drops to the floor and feels her calm resolve crumple, her heart shattering. Clint's words echo in her head.
“I think I can still manage to call you out when you make a crappy call, or complain about everything in sight,” Tony quips back, “Though, I’m fairly certain that keeping it a secret is out of the question. Our master assassin teammates are also master spy teammates. And I know for a fact they’d bring it up. Probably over a family dinner.”
"It's bad. Really bad. And I don't think we know the half of it yet. We've got to find a way to turn them back, and soon. And then pray they don't remember any of this," she answers, repressed tears threatening to spill.
"You're making me self-conscious, staring like that," Tony mutters, looking away from the Captain's penetrating gaze, "Not fair that I'm the only one naked here."
With a sigh, Natasha stands and heads for the parking garage. Dealing with a naked, four year old Tony Stark is definitely
Thor stands and goes behind them, pulling all four of them into a hug. They sit there for several minutes just holding each other tightly, then Tony lifts his head from Clint's neck.
Clint’s argument is valid, and they all know it. So they don’t try and fight it. If Clint says everything’s fine, then it is. Steve nods once and goes to get his uniform, while Thor and Natasha head for the jet. Before they leave, Steve goes back to the kitchen and picks Tony up, pulling him into an enormous hug.
The question catches Steve off guard, much as the shield naming question had, and Steve's eyebrows shoot up and a slight blush tinges his cheeks.
"Not yet," Natasha answers a bit forlornly, "But he'll call as soon as he knows anything. Why don't we go watch the movie with them, try and bond with them a little."
"Of course, Steve. What would you like to know?" Natasha sets down her fork and gives the small boy her full attention.
It isn’t so much the words that make the entire team feel suddenly angry and heartbroken at the same time. It’s the tone of resignation. As though Tony is used to coming second to everything. It makes all of them want to either put their fist through a wall, or pull the boy close and never let him go.
Putting Tony to bed is surprisingly much easier than giving him a bath. Tony quickly changes into his Captain America pajamas and crawls into bed, letting Steve tuck the covers up around him.
“Didn’t… hnngh… didn’t hurt me,” Tony stutters out, his erection very suddenly and painfully making its presence known. “Besides. I kind of… um… get off on… the whole idea.”
Once he’s certain his face has returned to a normal color, and his heart has slowed back down, he joins the rest of the team in the living room. They go over a strategy for how to handle their child teammate, (most of which involves Steve taking care of Tony while the others deal with any problems that arise,) and what to do if they get called to assemble. Steve knows they still have to do their job, but with Tony in his current state, and Bruce busy figuring out how to fix it, the team is down two members. Plus whoever ends up staying to watch over Tony. Clint suggests calling Phil to watch the boy, but the idea is quickly rejected as Coulson lives in San Francisco, and it wouldn’t be fair to call the agent away from his work on the off chance they’d need him to play babysitter for a few hours. Natasha proposes simply leaving Tony and locking down the mansion since Bruce is still there, but Steve worries it will make Tony think he’s being abandoned. And the team immediately vetoes Steve’s plan to let the other three handle whatever fight they get called to while he stays with Tony, and he relents because they’re right. The team can’t very well go into a battle without their leader.
