John didn't knew why he called Sherlock. He remembers taking his phone and then suddenly, he is calling Sherlock. Probably John himself didn't realize that, but his body knew. He needed Sherlock as the only thing to keep him right in this though moment.
"Are you really letting him go alone?" Greg asked, standing next to Mycroft. Mycroft turned to Greg a little, sly smile playing on his lips.
The words echoed through the whole England. Greg was in a bar, watching soccer, while the image changed. It was unclear in the start, but then the words rang. Greg's face dropped when he saw who was on the TV.
One night, Mrs. Hudson baked an apple pie. She knew Sherlock and John loved her cooking, so she decided to surprise the boys with her pie. Mrs. Hudson made tea to go with the pie and walked up the stairs to find John on his laptop and Sherlock lying on couch, his eyes closed and hands under his head. It was obvious he was thinking.
He was keeping a hold of that. He won't lose it this time. But the darkness around him started to consume again, trying to silence the voice. But he had to hold on. All of this was getting boring.
John made his way to the kitchen and started preparing simple breakfast. He turned the kettle on, getting ready two cups for tea. John quickly makes pancakes and hears shower turn off. John was finished with the breakfast and he prepared the table which was surprisingly clean and empty.
What Sherlock wanted the most in this moment was to silence everything. To silence his thoughts, his feeling. There were only two things that could do that. One thing he promised to not touch no matter what and other one not being available anymore. No one could help him.
“Make it all stop.” that was all he said. Deep sigh escaped Mycroft as they continued to walk towards his car.
. John's heart was filling up with hatred, but also love and hurt. He was hurting himself by just looking at Sherlock.
After all of this, Sherlock looked at John from a different angle. He saw him differently. He saw John as a different person. He wanted to know him. Sherlock felt something, but he was scared. Scared that Moriarty will come back and ruin everything.
"Why wouldn't you?" She suddenly asked. Sherlock was caught off guard and this time, she smirked. "Don't you want John to be happy?" Sherlock thought back to all those weeks spent with John. How he finally looked happy, how his mood changed whenever Mary was mentioned. Sherlock knew very well that John wasn't happy before he came to live in 221B again.
Suddenly, the phone rang. Sherlock's eyes quickly shot to the phone. He was debating if he should take it not. Finally, he slowly reached for it. Sherlock looked at caller's ID and his heart started beating faster. Mycroft saw change in his little brother's face and he already knew who was calling. Sherlock slowly answered:
“Stop talking. You already deduced everything. Why wait?” John was right. Sherlock saw everything written on John’s face. He smiled a little and settled himself between John’s legs.
"John, tell me what happened." Sherlock stayed calm for John's sake. The doctor slowly took a step back, breaking from Sherlock's embrace. John was still shaking and crying, so Sherlock held his hand on John's to keep him calm.
John rushed into the flat as quickly as possible. He was met by Mycroft, Greg and others walking around the flat. His stomach dropped, he could feel that something bad happened, because Sherlock was not here.
John woke up to see an empty bed. He heard water running in the bathroom, indicating that Sherlock was there. John slowly sat up and yawned. He stretched a bit and got out of bed, quickly changing from pyjamas into his normal clothes. Today he had a day off and could do anything he wanted, which was a relief.
“Oh, for god’s sake John. Stop lying!” Sherlock raised his voice a little, grabbing John’s attention. John’s desire just grew and he could feel himself getting hard again. “You forget who I am and I know when you’re lying.” John sighed and looked up.
Sherlock looks up at John, who has his eyes closed. His hair are a mess, sweat on his head and body shining in this dim light and he just looks gorgeous in any way only John could. And Sherlock loved it.
"Sherlock? You all right?" John slowly ask. Sherlock doesn't look at John and starts walking to the car that is supposed to take him home. They all follow and Sherlock slowly answers:
And he always felt something warm. On his hand. It was always there. Sometimes it would disappeared and it would be cold all over again. He could feel himself slipping away. But then the warmth always came back, and he was holding on it.
The bell rang. Sherlock's head shoot up. It wasn't John nor Mycroft, they both would walk in. It couldn't be Gra-Greg either, he told him to not bring any new cases long time ago. Sherlock slowly walked downstairs, carefully. The bell rang again. The person who was standing outside was getting impatient. Sherlock smirked and opened the door to see Mary. Even if Sherlock was left speechless, he won't show this to her.
“Faster!” moaned John. He tried moving, but Sherlock kept him still by his hip which was driving John insane. Sherlock kept his hand on John’s hip while other took John’s balls and he started massaging them. “Oh, oh god.” John moans as Sherlock sucks him deep and swallowing around him. John gasps, arching up. “Again!” Sherlock obeys John as he sinks down, swallowing again and making John cry out in pleasure.
Mycroft was here too. He came to visit at least once a week, sometimes visiting two days in a row. The image of Sherlock all beaten up and in coma was unbearable. One time, Mycroft walked out to sit in the waiting room. Sentiments never got better  him, but this time knowing that his little brother might never wake up... Well, it broke him into pieces. He kept cool and collected, but he was breaking apart, even if nobody saw it. But Sherlock would have been able to see it.
"I'll be there." he answered and hung up. Then the detective jumped to go change into other clothes, but Mycroft grabbed his hand.
John slowly walked to Sherlock, took a chair and sat next to him. He could feel tears rolling down his cheeks. John slowly took Sherlock's hand and closed his. He looked down and whispered:
But colors. Colors? When he touched Sherlock? John knows all those stories about soulmates. Maybe when he was little, he believed in them. But when he grew? Of course not, because it were just child stories. But now? He doesn't know what to think. He saw them. He saw blood clearly, it stood out with it's vivid color. He saw Sherlock's coat in color, everything had color, even if it was just for a little glimpse. He really did saw them when he touched Sherlock. Does that mean?.. That would be funny, because he is not Sherlock's soulmate. But why Sherlock took his hand that day? Why he looked around so mesmerized? Why he asked John if he saw it too? Yes, John did saw colors when their hands collided, but he didn't knew what he was supposed to see.
"You let me grieve." John whispered. "I thought you were dead." he whispered again and again, letting all the pain go. Sherlock felt tears running down, because he knew John forgave him and he was grateful, but he couldn't believe that John forgave him this easily. He felt warmth in his heart, feeling happy that he was holding John in his hands after two years of pain.
John slowly walked to Sherlock and crouched down. The detective slowly put his head on the ground and closed his eyes, taking deep breaths. John's heart was racing, it felt like his heart wanted to leave his body and John felt adrenaline all over himself. Seeing Sherlock all bloody and hurt was so...
“The things I want to do to you.” John hummed his voice as low as it could get. Sherlock let out a groan, trying to move again, but John suddenly stopped moving, making Sherlock whine.
John slowly reached Sherlock’s neck. He really loves this sweet and smooth skin of Sherlock’s. John kissed his way down, nibbling Sherlock’s sweet spot, licking his collarbone. Going back up a bit, John bit on his neck more violently, sure to leave a mark. Sherlock was panting, his arousal now as big as it can be, painfully trying to escape his pants. He arched up to get more friction, but John had him strangled and he could barely move.
Greg also came to visit. He tried making small talk with John, but it was as if talking to a wall. John reminded him of Sherlock again. Greg stopped trying. It was hurting him too. After all, Sherlock was his friend and right now he was in a coma that could end no matter when. And John's resemblance to Sherlock was like a reminder that the one Greg was reminded of was actually in coma.
"It smells amazing, what is it?" John asked her, his voice low, not to disturb Sherlock. She smiled, because she noticed why John was keeping his voice down. She leaned and whispered:
Only the bell shook Sherlock out of his thoughts. Someone was at the door and it was obviously not Mycroft, he never rings a bell. Could be John, but it's just a little possibility, what would he need here? Maybe Graham... Greg was at the door. Sherlock slowly walked downstairs and opened the door to be met with... John. His face fell a little, when he saw how the doctor looked. Haven't eaten properly in days, no calm night sleep, nightmares, lost weight, problems with Mary, little signs of depression, anxiety... He could go on and on, but Sherlock was interrupted by John:
"Sweety, you loved apple pie, what happened now?" Mrs. Hudson asked. Sherlock tried to avoid this but it was no use. John took a sip of his tea, showing no interest when actually, he was listening carefully. Sherlock sighed in defeat. Then said:
“Ah! Oh god… Sherl…” He can feel himself being close, but still not enough. John can’t stop himself but put his hands on Sherlock’s head and pressing a little bit down. He feels Sherlock hum, driving John to the edge. “Oh fuck. Oh, Sherlock… More!” John starts chanting Sherlock’s name, the detective’s grip on John’s hip loosening. John was in control. He knew it. The submissiveness of Sherlock made John’s cock throb. He listened to every word John told him, every command.
"Yes, what if. We don't know anything yet." Greg answered. He had to admit, he was now getting anxious too. Last time, it wasn't that long. How long are they here? 3 hours? 4 hours? "Just take a deep breath. We will wait just a bit longer." John scoffed in answer.
"John." Greg tried again. He didn't remember how many times he said this. He lost count. "Sit down and relax. Your pacing around won't help the doctors." He said and looked up at John who stopped and was now looking at Greg. John finally gave up and sat down, but from just a look at him you could say that he wasn't relaxed at all.
He couldn't stop his mind. It was racing. Just like his heart out of fear. He tried to keep his mind away from Sherlock, but it was impossible. John slowly remembered that time, when Mary shot Sherlock. The first time. John was pissed. Angry. He couldn't believe that Sherlock came back into his life and now got himself shot. John was angry. On Sherlock, on himself, on the person who shot him. He was full of rage. And that drive to hospital. He was calm. He tried to keep Sherlock conscious.
“Asked me to come to talk about the recent case.” Sherlock quickly finished his tea and walked out of the kitchen to get ready. John was finishing his breakfast. Sherlock walked to John, giving him a quick kiss to his forehead and ran down the stairs, out of the flat. John waited to hear the door close and then let out a big sigh. He then left his cold food and rushed up to his room.
“Only yours.” whispered John, out of breath, panting and moaning again. Sherlock started moving faster, picking up a pace. “Sherlock, oh god.” Sherlock sinks in deep, which feels magical.
John could feel himself die inside, when he saw Sherlock jump. His heart dropped, heart racing and breathing quickening. When he finally reached Sherlock, he saw something dark on the ground near Sherlock's head. John knew it was blood. He knew it all too well. But he just had to check for the pulse. He had to touch Sherlock. He had to see if it worked.
John's wife walked out of shadows, the corner John and Sherlock have looked at and saw something. She was holding a gun that was pointed directly at Sherlock, slight grin on her face. John froze, not knowing what to do, his hand started to slightly shake. He knew she was an assassin, but he didn't know that Mary also worked for Moriarty.
He heard the voice even louder, but still couldn't figure out what John was saying. But that didn't stop him from trying. He decided to focus on something simple, like moving a finger.
The doctor entered the kitchen, while Sherlock was sitting in his chair and he closed his eyes. It was lovely to finally be back home. And what Sherlock actually needed was something he never expected. Right now, he needed some silence, which wasn't new, but he also needed the calmness, he didn't need any new case, but he did need the warmth of the flat, John.
"Play the tape." Some guy walked to the TV and played what was on it. At first, it was dark but then a face appeared. A very familiar face.
"Why did you do that?" John looked and whispered more to himself. Even if Sherlock heard him, he probably ignored the question and said nothing. John looked back at Sherlock to see his face a bit twisted and it was obvious that Sherlock was thinking and looking into nothing. "What are you doing?" John asked instead. The detective blinked few times and looked back at the doctor. He cleared his throat.
This place was all too familiar. The field was the same, never changing. He hated this place. He hated this day. This was the most horrible day in the year and Sherlock always came here, every year. Of course, he visited this place more than once in a year, but only one time with a violin.
"How are you going to do it?" Sherlock spoke for this first time since John came here. His voice was breaking, it was more like a hoarse. John flinched a little. It just reminded him how broken Sherlock was at the moment. "How are you going to kill us?" Sherlock asked again as if Moriarty didn't understand the first question. Sherlock got up from the floor a bit and turned to Moriarty, chains ringing in the silence as he balanced himself on his own hands, even if they were burning a bit.
Sherlock looked up, then down at John to see him burying his face into Sherlock's chest and listening to Sherlock's heartbeat. Just from this sight, Sherlock's heart leaped and started to beat faster. John smiled at this and looked up at Sherlock. This time, Sherlock took John's face in his hands, while John's hands stayed on Sherlock's waist. He looked lovingly at those bright eyes. Sherlock was happy that he was finally able to hold John in his hands, to have him so close and to know that John felt the same way. Then, Sherlock's eyes slowly travelled down to look at John's lips. They looked so soft, so gentle. It was like an invite. Apart from that, he
Sherlock suddenly fails one note. He was shaking, his hand was shaking and it was even harder to play. The fact that he failed to play one note the right way, broke him inside and he could feel tears, which were streaming down his face and making everything around him blurry. Sherlock couldn’t see anything properly anymore. But he had to finish the song no matter what. So, Sherlock didn’t stop. He just simply finished the song, with sad and slow notes. The song flowed beautifully as it hit the end. Sherlock didn’t even finish the last note properly, when he broke down completely.
“Let’s go home.” Mycroft spoke to Sherlock and didn’t receive an answer. He didn’t expect one, but he at least expected for Sherlock to move. But there was nothing. “It’s late.” He stated even if it was obvious. But it wasn’t obvious to Sherlock. “I know it hurts, but please, for your own sake, help me get you back home.” Mycroft could feel himself fill with emotions and he didn’t like the it. He was getting desperate. Sherlock was never so unresponsive. He wasn’t even in his mind palace, because even then there would be something that would have indicated that Sherlock was listening. But today, it was nothing.
John saw Sherlock's eyes look a bit down. He knew where Sherlock was looking. And he felt a spark in his chest. He could feel his heart beating faster. He didn't rush it, but he couldn't wait anymore. His own eyes lowered down to see Sherlock's lips. They were so close to him, it was incredible. John couldn't think about anything else than wondering how Sherlock's lips would feel against his own.
"Hello, little brother. How is the exile going?" Sherlock tries to stay cool and answers without expressing an emotions:
"Oh, I'm in no need of them." Moriarty answered. He was so sure, it was confusing Sherlock. John's hand tightened on his gun.
John knew he couldn't risk his own life nor Sherlock's by bringing police together. He had to go alone or he feared that Moriarty will do something. But no matter if John came alone or with police, knowing Moriarty, he will do something to both of them.
Suddenly, a doctor walked out and John quickly stood up, but Sherlock didn't. He instead looked at the doctor's face and knew. He knew what he was going to say. So Sherlock stood up and gave John a hesitant pat.
This time, he will only come back in the morning. John has nothing to worry about. Mycroft is there, Sherlock is safe. It's his brother after all.
John lost it. He couldn't believe that it all had to end like this. All he wanted was all those endless cases with Sherlock. The adrenaline. He wanted it. He didn't really want to die because of Sherlock. And he certainly did not want Sherlock to apologise for whatever he was even apologising. But the look on Sherlock's eyes... John knew it was all over. Their stories were over.
Slowly, Sherlock leaned back to look up at John. John opened his eyes to see Sherlock like a big mess, breathing heavily, his eyes full of hunger. As quickly as Sherlock pulled back, he attacked John's lips again, with more passion than before, John instantly answering him back with as much passion. Sherlock gently bit John's upper lip, then tongue slowly swept across John's bottom lip and his mouth opened instantly. They both fought for dominance, this time John winning. He started exploring Sherlock's mouth, Sherlock giving John access. Without John expecting, Sherlock attacked John's tongue, eager to get his turn to explore John's mouth. John didn't fought back and he gladly let Sherlock do whatever he wanted. Sherlock's tongue swept over John's teeth and anywhere he could reach.
"First, everything went successful. We got rid of the bullet and took care of the wound." John let out a breath. He quickly looked up at the doctor, hope rising. Everything is ok. Sherlock is ok.
"Don't say a word." He said silently, his voice barely audible. Mary smirked, because she knew she was right.
Sherlock and John felt safe in each other's embrace and they wished for this moment to never stop. John had a small smile hidden behind his hand, but he was still crying, still shaking. Sherlock was holding John like he was the only thing keeping him alive, like John was his life.
"So Moriarty is alive?" Mary asks oblivious. Sherlock shakes his head and turns back to look at them.
"I was there for you before. I’ll be there for you again." Mycroft held shaking Sherlock closer to him. He knew that this won't help his brother with the pain, but Mycroft wanted to show that he is here for him, no matter what. "I’ll
"So what is he going to do now?" John asked. He really wanted all this to end, he wanted a simple break. But also didn't. Sherlock stopped in front of the car and slowly turned to Mary and John, as Mycroft walked to the other side of the car and sat in it.
Sherlock Holmes, the freak and psychopath to everybody, fell in love with John Watson, the light in his life.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock whispered, his voice without any hope. He didn't even know what he was apologising for. Did he apologise for how he couldn't save him? Not today, not two years back? For all those body parts? Calling him idiot? Making John think he was dead? For those two years of pain? For not telling how he felt? For not saying things he always wanted to say? Or maybe because all of this had to end like this? Maybe because Sherlock gave John meaning of life again, but is the one who will also take it away? What was he apologising for?
"I promise, Sherlock." John slowly let go of Sherlock so he could look at him, still holding him close. Sherlock didn't dare to look at John, his eyes darted to the ground. John slowly took Sherlock face in his hands and made him look up, look at him. The world around them changed and John could see colours dancing in Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock could see John's bright eyes. It was now his favourite colour in the world. They both smiled at each other, knowing that each of them saw colours. "I loved you for so long and now I finally have you. I am never leaving you." Sherlock's heart jumped at the words. Then a lazy smirk appeared on his lips.
But there was a terrorist attack. And Sherlock needed John's help. John decided to help which made Sherlock really happy. He didn't feel this happy in a long time ago.
"The baby." John quickly walked closer to her for support. She groaned in pain again, breathing heavily. Mary was squeezed John's hand, everytime she felt pain.
He was somewhere in between. Never getting tired. Oh, he would give so much away to at least open his eyes or move. Not moving was boring. Dull.
"Moriarty is dead." he started. Mycroft swore he saw a little hint of smile on John's face but it was gone really quickly. "We found his twin brother's body too. They won't be a headache anymore. Unless somebody takes their place which I don't believe will happen." John nodded and sat down next to Mycroft.
Mary didn't answer. Instead, she smirked. She looked frightening, Sherlock could see the assassin now.
"Miss me?" then walks down the little stairs. They all walk to him. For sure, Mycroft and John are examining his face and Sherlock knows there are little signs of crying, but conceals everything. John seems to catch up.
"Sherlock Holmes." he said panting. The nurse quickly found the right information. John thanked her and he ran to the right floor, but when up, he was stopped by a few nurses. They told him that Sherlock was in the middle of surgery and John had to wait.
Small smile appeared on his lips as Sherlock played the first part. Then the song became a bit slower as Sherlock’s fingers slowly glided across the fingerboard. The bow started moving slower across the strings. Lower notes were heard. It was just a little stop, when Sherlock started playing more emotional, higher notes. He slowly lost his smile. Sherlock was more focused than before, he closed his eyes and saw exact memory he put into this song. An anxious feeling crept into him.
"No, look, seriously... Could you just..." John finally looks up. His face drops, looking at Sherlock with disbelief. John couldn't believe, that the man who jumped two years ago, his best friend who didn't have a pulse, was standing in front of him and was very alive.
"Well, if I'm about to die, I would like to know anyways." Sherlock answered, looking back at Moriarty.
That's how many days Sherlock was in coma. And with every day the number grew. That was the part John hated. The growing number.
"And here I am!" Moriarty's hands flew up as he smiled. His hands slowly lowered down and he said: "Stayin' Alive." Sherlock looked up at Moriarty again, trying to read him. The last time Sherlock heard those words and that song was when they were on the rooftop. John's hand on the gun tightened. "Wonder how I did it, am I right, Sherlock?" The detective's eyes drifted slightly to left to see something, even if for a split second.
There was door opening behind John. Somebody entered the room but the doctor didn't care that much to turn around and see who came.
It was too silent. Too silent for such a long time. He hated this room, he hated the silence and the only sound in the room. He hated it all.
"John. Can you hear me? John!" the doctor's eyes slowly travelled to see Greg holding him. It was obvious John was in heavy shock. He was having a breakdown, possibly panic attack.
"Yes, but please, Sherlock... Come to the hospital." John's voice sounded so vulnerable, in the end it broke. Sherlock knew he had to go.
"What do you mean?" and that's when Sherlock's world came crushing down. That's when Sherlock's smile dropped. That was the moment Sherlock knew that John was his soulmate, but Sherlock isn't John's.  Because John is happy with another woman he chose to spend his life with.
"Well, I had lots of fun playing with you, did you?" Moriarty asked and looked at Mary. She didn't tear her gaze from Sherlock, but she gave a little nod. "I think it's time, my dear." Moriarty turned back to look at Sherlock and asked him a question: "Any last words? Something you want to say? This is your last chance." Moriarty turned to Mary and they both laughed.
“What do you want me to say?” he tried to ask as calmly as possible, but his voice was shaking a bit. He took quicker breaths.
Sherlock took time to undress John too, taking his sweater off, breaking their kiss. He took off whole of John's top, his eyes lingering on John’s wound that was located on his shoulder. Sherlock leaned in to kiss it, John looking up, breathing in with his eyes closed. Sherlock leaned back up to look at John, his eyes wild, small smile on his. It was like a signal which John ignored and was taken by surprise when he felt a hand on his throbbing bulge. John instantly started moving, closing his eyes. He moaned and the sound made Sherlock even harder. John was panting, his knees getting weak. Sherlock smirked at this reaction while trying to ignore his own erection as much as possible for as long as he can, to give everything for the doctor. He wanted to show how much he loved John, how much he meant for Sherlock, he wanted to make the doctor feel good. John whimpered as his eyes shot open, when Sherlock pulled his hand away.
The song was filled with words he couldn’t ever say. With things, he was scared to say. With thoughts, he was too stubborn to act on. Feelings, his mind didn’t let to express. This part was full of it. Sherlock could feel tears in his eyes again. This hurt him. He didn’t get a chance, he couldn’t do it. He was scared to ruin their friendship. It was the best and the most beautiful thing he had and Sherlock didn’t want to lose it. But he wasn’t the only one stopping himself. Because Moriarty couldn’t know about his feelings too.
"John." he stated simply. He could hear heavy breathing on the other side. Sherlock quickly stood up and turned away from his brother. "John?" he waited for John to start talking.
“I’ve never been so sure in my life.” John smiled. He knew Sherlock was lying. The detective was always sure about everything. But he still stood there not doing anything, even if his erection was throbbing and getting painful. Sherlock smiled as if knowing why John was waiting. “It’s not my first time, you know.” He added smugness in his voice. This calmed John down and he started slowly unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt.
Sherlock sat in his chair, staring into nothing and thinking about everything. He knew nothing about what Moriarty wanted to do. He couldn't find out anything. This angered him the most.
"I just..." John sighed. He didn't know how to say it. He wanted to tell Greg how he felt, but how does he put it all into words? "You should have seen him, Greg. He was bleeding. A lot of blood. I-I couldn't stop it... I couldn't do anything at all!" John's breathing quickened, his heart started to race again. "What if he's dead? What if he won't make it? What if..." John bit his lip, trying to stop all those thoughts. Greg just slowly put a hand on his shoulder.
Sherlock slips in another finger, stretching John. The doctor starts moving with Sherlock’s fingers, trying to get as much friction as he can. He was close, he could feel it. After fingering John long enough, Sherlock slips another finger in, making John cry out in pleasure. It was so much, much more than John dreamed off.
Nobody really noticed, but I changed the last chapter name's. Now 4th one is 'Turn' and 5th is 'Twist'. I just felt that Survive and Escape fits this one and the next one better :)
"Of course I do." he answered a bit annoyed. But he noticed something. Something changed in Sherlock. He was more vulnerable, his eyes were running around the place and it was obvious he was thinking, trying to figure out something. Sherlock looked like a lost child. And he felt like that.
Everything was alright, until people around Sherlock started to see difference in his behaviour. At first, nothing suspicious happened. But with time, they noticed one and only one change.
Everyday he woke up and went to work, to solve murders, mysteries. He just went off with his life, but Sherlock always fell asleep scared, that maybe he will be the little part of people who never meet their soulmates. He was scared he will never see colors. But he had to conceal his feelings, so Sherlock never really gave a bigger thought to all of this.
Finally, after what looked like an eternity, they reached the hospital. John didn't even wait for Greg and jumped out of the car, running into the hospital. He found a nurse behind a desk and quickly walked to her.
"Sherlock-" The doctor was loss for words. He had a lot to say, but couldn't find the right words to express what he actually felt. "I'm sorry." was what he first said, or rather whispered, after some time of silence. "I'm sorry, that we had to end up here. I just wish... Right now, I just wish to go back. I-I want to have never met Mary. Maybe if I didn't met her, you wouldn't be here, lying unconscious." John's voice was getting weak. "I just wish to change some things. I still don't understand why you didn't tell me. I-I lost you, Sherlock. For two whole years. I thought you were actually dead." his voice broke in the end a bit. "I'm sorry I was angry at you. I regret that." The doctor looked away.
"Can I come in?" Sherlock slowly nodded and let him in. He couldn't say anything. He didn't know what to say. They both walked up and John sat in his chair. The doctor let out a heavy sigh, while Sherlock was waiting for John to speak, even if he already knew why John was here. "It's Mary and I... We had an argument." John looked up at the detective and Sherlock's heart started to beat faster, when their eyes met. "Can I stay for a while? At least until we figure this out."
Sherlock blinked few times. He tried to move his hand and felt something warm on his left. He looked down to see someone, with his eyes closed and head down, holding his hand, shaking slightly. He didn't say anything. Sherlock didn't know what to say. Did he have to say something?
Sherlock walked back to lab to work again. When he was almost finished, he heard somebody walk in. No, two people. Slowly looking up, he saw Mike and some unfamiliar face. Sherlock could feel his heart skip a beat because of this stranger. Turns out, Mike found Sherlock a roommate.
"Maybe you didn't die that day, but I can make sure that you die right now." John said and pointed his gun towards Moriarty. Moriarty smiled with closed mouth as his eyes laughed. Sherlock looking at Moriarty now knew that he was hiding something, he was sure.
The name suddenly ringed in Sherlock's head. He opened his eyes and looked up. He saw a short man with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. He came closer and looked straight into Sherlock's eyes. Pain written all over his face.
After some time, Mycroft walked out and looked at John. He gave him a small nod and left. John walked back to Sherlock, taking his usual place.
“If there’s something, just tell me.” Sherlock tried again, but John kept quiet. Sherlock just sighed, not knowing what else to say.
"Oh, for God's sake. Make up your mind. Who needs me this time?" On the next side, Sherlock hears his brother sigh. Mycroft looks to the front of the car to see a small TV screen that was set into the dashboard. On the screen there could be seen a picture of Jim Moriarty facing the camera, two words written on the screen:
"Hello sweetie." Mary said smiling at John, that unrealistic smile John saw even from the first day they met. And just now he found out that it wasn't a real smile. It never was.
John blinked few times, coming back to reality. What he just saw was beautiful and mesmerizing. He couldn’t get the image out of his head. It wasn’t the first time John saw Sherlock’s bare chest. But it was the first time he saw him almost naked after they were together. The image was stuck and he couldn’t eat anymore. John squirmed in his seat and felt something hard against his jeans. Did he just really got hard? Apparently, yes. John tried to calm himself down. It’s nothing, he will ignore it.
Few weeks passed and there was still no sign of Moriarty. Sherlock was getting frustrated, he couldn't sleep anymore, he became less approachable, everything irritated him. Everybody walking in made him think it was Moriarty. The only person that could take him in this situation was John. Sherlock always insulted everybody, except John.
"Stop thinking." Sherlock said. John only sighed and proceeded to eat his piece of pie. That was the night when the change started.
It was a fact that John loved apples. He knew Sherlock liked them too. There were times when he bought them and apples lasted only for a week. Yes, John ate the bigger part of it, but Sherlock joined and ate them too.
"Am I supposed to?" Sherlock answered a question with a question. John looked away, his eyes closed, his breathing becoming quick as he tried to calm down.
When the clock passed ten p.m., John finally decided to sleep. Without even noticing, he already stood in Sherlock's bedroom. He couldn't help himself, but John slowly lay down. He felt as if Sherlock was sleeping next to him. The whole bed, the whole room was filled with him. John closed his eyes, with peace in his chest and had a peaceful sleep without any nightmares. It was only a little bit more than four hours, but at least John felt rested.
"No!" Sherlock suddenly sat up, even if his whole body shook with pain and started burning. Moriarty grinned even more. Of course, this was getting a bit boring and he wanted it all to be finally over. John turned to see Mary looking at him. He swore he saw her apologetic look, but he probably imagined it.
“There’s not.” John answered, trying to ignore his feelings. It’s not like he didn’t want it, maybe Sherlock wasn’t ready or simply didn’t want to have sex.
Without John expecting, Sherlock slips one finger into John’s arsehole. “Ah! Oh god, oh fuck!” John gasps as he feels Sherlock pick up a pace with his finger. John grips Sherlock’s hair and yanks them up, the detective letting out a moan. Sherlock felt just little bit of pain, but it made him crave John more. He could feel his own cock pressing into his pants and Sherlock wondered how long will he go without touching himself.
He tried. Hard. To move his hand, head, feet, anything. He wanted to scream: “I'm here!“ But it was as if his body was refusing to do anything. And so he had to fight.
Sherlock came back after few hours, with take out which he put on the kitchen table. He spent at least three hours with Greg that were really dull. All Sherlock wanted to do was get back to the flat, to John since he had a day off. But here he was, stuck with Greg. What had to be only a half an hour trip, turned to be another case.
Sherlock started using drugs. He just couldn't cope with all of these emotions. He needed to stop them. He needed an escape. And he found one.
The song was getting a bit quicker, you could only hear sadness in it and know instantly, that something was about to happen. You could just feel it.
And it went like this for half of the year. Sherlock never touched apples, never ate anything related to them and it was weird. It was like not him.
“Lestrade turned a simple thing into a case which I had to solve of course.” John smiled and continued eating. For this short amount of time, he forgot about his morning. But his frustration didn’t go unnoticed. Sherlock saw it instantly. He probably figured out why John felt like that. Of course, Sherlock decided to keep a close eye on John for the rest of the day.
"I need to." Sherlock said calmly, even if he was boiling inside. John needed him. John needed Sherlock. And he is going to be there. He is going to ignore his feeling and be there for his best friend. Mycroft didn't seem pleased nor convinced. Sherlock sighed. "It's Mary. Something happened and she is in hospital. I need to go." he looked at Mycroft pleading. "Mycroft, I can't do this to him!" Sherlock was losing his patience. "I can't leave him alone.
And why didn't Sherlock listen to his guts when he felt that something was wrong? Did he really thought John would wait for him? At least Sherlock had hopes.
"Please..." Sherlock looked at Mycroft. His brother slowly shook his head. Sherlock turned from him again and wanted to speak, but John interrupted him:
"Thank you." the doctor nodded and walked away. John slowly sat down. Sherlock just looked back at John. It was hard for Sherlock to see John so hurt, so vulnerable. John had his face in his hands and was breathing heavily. "John, you should go and see Mary." Sherlock slowly said. John slowly nodded and stood up.
"John, I know he told you to come alone, but we need a plan. We can't let you go there alone and risk your life, Sherlock would..." Mycroft stopped and didn't finish his sentence.
Sherlock slowly made his way towards one particular place, with his eyes closed, his head lowered down again. He didn’t need to see where he was going. Everything was calculated long time ago, he knew this path too well. He calculated his steps, all the turns, he knew how many minutes it will take for him to walk and when he will need to stop. But he really did not want to stop and look at the evidence. He did not want to look reality in the eyes all over again. It pained him to remember why he was here. Every year. On the same day, same place, with violin. For the past 5 years.
"Colours, Sherlock. Colours!" he said. His eyes were shining. He was happy. After all this time. Sherlock was still suspicious, scared to hope for too much.
"No." he simply said and let her in. Mary rushed in, while Sherlock slowly closed the door. They both walked upstairs and she sat in John's chair. Sherlock didn't like anybody sitting in John's chair, but Mary sitting made the detective sick. "So what do you need?" Mary sighed and put her hand back down.
"Yes, of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be?" John knows Sherlock too well to know when he is lying and he actually was.
Every day, every hour, every minute John was expecting for something to happen. He was expecting for Sherlock to wake up. Holding Sherlock's hand, sitting next to him and waiting.
"John, you should know that I was the first to fall in love with you." They both silently giggled. John's hands slowly slid down to Sherlock's chest as he put his hand on Sherlock's chest and laughed. Sherlock held John close to him. When laughter slowly died, John could hear heartbeat. It was fast, faster than usual. John's hand slowly made their way to Sherlock's waist, while Sherlock put his head on top of John's and he breathed in to smell John's shampoo, even if it had just a faint smell. Sherlock started to slowly swing to right and left, while holding John close to him.
He saw colours. The flowers, they were different from each other. Sherlock blinked few times. He tried to move his hand and felt something warm on his left. He looked down to see John, with his eyes closed and head down, holding his hand, shaking slightly.
Sherlock fell down to the ground. He put the violin away from him and looked up at the name written on the gravestone, his eyes filled with tears. Sherlock slowly closed them, his head lowered down and he leaned into the gravestone. Finally, he let his walls break and first sob escaped his lips. Then another and another and he couldn’t stop anymore.
A nurse walked in and told Greg and John to follow her. She brought them to Sherlock. When John opened the door, he stopped dead in his track. Looking at broken body. John couldn't tear his gaze away from him. He was afraid that if he closed his eyes, even if just for a second, Sherlock will be gone and he will be dead. But he is not.
." John said, a smile playing on his lips. He opened his eyes to see Sherlock's multicoloured eyes and was glad that he was the only one able to see these different colours play in his soulmate's eyes and for the rest of his life.
"Sherlock." John's voice was now soft. Mary gasped. John could feel hot tears on his face, he was shaking and he was scared, that everything that is happening right now is just a dream. He was scared that he will wake up and Sherlock will be gone. But when Sherlock's eyes locked with John's, John knew it wasn't a dream. It was all real and Sherlock was alive.
It was time to leave. Sherlock turned to Mycroft and gave him a little glance. Mycroft knew what Sherlock was asking for and walked away with Mary and his security guards. Sherlock turned back to look at John, while John looked around.
"No, Sherlock, don't you dare die." John whispered silently. He was not losing Sherlock. "Not again." John whispered as he closed his eyes. He could feel his wet face and he was obviously shaking which wasn't helping. A lot of people suddenly burst into the room. Some of them ran towards Moriarty's dead body and Mary. Doctors ran towards Sherlock and John. John felt hands that were taking him away from Sherlock, but he was trying to get rid of them. He didn't want to leave Sherlock. "No, no please. Let me go!" he was screaming, but there was no use. The doctors quickly ran out of the room with Sherlock.
But no words come out. Sherlock just slowly walks closer to John and slightly bends down to reach for John's hand. When their hands collide, their heart races quicken. Sherlock looks around and everything is so clear now. He sees every colors so bright and he knows why. He finally knows. He smiles and looks down at John who is staring at him, his pupils dilated.
"It's a pie." Sherlock took the plate and sat down opposite John. He also took another cup of tea and took a sip.
But all of his hopes were crushed when he walked into a dark restaurant. When he saw John sitting with another woman and John was obviously nervous. He saw the ring on the table and Sherlock knew what was about to happen. So Sherlock felt the need to ruin it. And he did. But he didn't really expect the reaction he got.
"Yeah, you're right. I should." John looked at Sherlock, secretly admiring the detective and then slowly walked the way the doctor came. Sherlock was left alone. He awkwardly stood in the hallway, until he slowly turned around and walked away.
John noticed Mrs. Hudson walk in. He quickly put his laptop away and walked to her, quickly taking the tray from her hands and walking to the table to put it down.
"I need your help." she said and looked up the flat. "Is John here?" she asked and looked behind her as if someone was watching her. Sherlock looked coldly at her, because he saw her act pretty clearly.
"Sir, I think you'll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking." Mary giggles while Sherlock continues to talk: "It 'as all the qualities of the old, with some of the colour of the new." John looks at Mary sitting opposite him. Sherlock doesn't stop talking, when John says:
Sherlock’s head flooded with memories, happy ones, not so happy ones. Their cases. Any memory, that had John in it.
After some time, John finally left Sherlock's side to go and talk to Mycroft. He knew that Mycroft wasn't here just to see his brother. But John was wrong, Mycroft actually came here to see his brother, also having some news, but his intentions were to visit Sherlock. He didn't come here to tell him all of that, but since John thought so, he told what he knew.
Everything that happened after that was really quick. John used the little opportunity. He didn't hesitate and he shot Moriarty straight into the head, wiping away the grin on his face. Mary was caught off guard, but she quickly turned to shoot John. Mary wasn't fast enough as she was shot too. The bullet reached her hand and her gun fell out of her hands. Another bullet hit her leg and she fell down. John stood there, trying to process what just happened. Mary was now lying on the ground, tears rolling out of her eyes and she was silently crying. John's eyes slowly found Sherlock on the ground. John quickly threw his gun away and reached for Sherlock. He was bleeding badly and was losing blood really quickly. The wound was closer to his heart this time. John tried to stop the blood, but there was more and more every second. He didn't know what to do. His hands now covered in Sherlock's blood made it even more scarier.
"Is Mary o-" Sherlock was cut when John hugged him. Sherlock wasn't used to it, but neither was John so it was new to both of them. Sherlock slowly hugged John back, while the doctor silently cried. They didn't need words. All they needed now was each other.
Thank you so much for reading this! I hope you enjoyed this work and will be reading more of my work. Don't forget, there is one chapter to go until finishing and if you stay with me 'till the end, there will be a surprise ;)
"I love you." John heard Sherlock's deep voice and it made his stomach tingle with happiness these three simple words brought.
They slowly made their way up to a room, that was specifically made for Sherlock. In fact, he decorated the room himself long time ago. Mycroft left him there to change and get ready for bed. When he came back, Sherlock was already in bed and looking out of the window. Mycroft walked to the bed and sat down. Sherlock instantly turned to face his brother. He closed his eyes while Mycroft put a hand into his hair and slowly ran through it, until Sherlock fell asleep. Mycroft sat there for a bit longer. Just making sure.
The song was faster than before, with more high notes. Sherlock expressed all of the words, all emotions he regrets not expressing earlier. He just wishes he was brave enough to be open to everything. But now it’s all too late.
"I'm so sorry, but Sherlock is in coma." John's heart sank. "And he may not make it." Greg's eye widened, while John slowly sat down. He took his head in his hands. Greg turned to the doctor and said a quick thank you. "You will be able to see him very soon." Said the doctor and finally left. Greg looked down at John. The poor doctor was shaking again. Greg just sat down next to John and put a hand over his shoulder, but John didn't feel him. He was lost in his mind.
"Sherlock... Please, I need your help." John's voice was shaking, as if he was crying. Sherlock slowly breathed in and turned to Mycroft.
Their first meeting. Sherlock didn’t dare to admit, at least, not until now, that it was the best day of his is life. It was ages ago, but Sherlock always remembered it as if everything happened just yesterday.
One day, Sherlock got caught in Serbia. All the torture, pain, memories. Everything mixed and he didn't know what was real and what was only his memories. The only real thing was pain in his back. Every pain he has ever felt. That was real. That was it for him. He was on a verge of giving up. He couldn't think anymore, his mind shut down. It just didn't work. All hopes were lost for Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock put his head in his hands, trying to shut out the voice. If anything, the voice in his head, the memory, was making it all harder.
And then the Christmas came. They all had quite nice dinner. Molly and Greg joined them, Mrs. Hudson brought her baked pies and other dishes. The dinner was delicious and quite fun. Sherlock was most silent, but he still responded to some questions. After the dinner, desserts. Molly brought a chocolate cake which looked delicious. Mrs. Hudson baked a pie. Sherlock wanted to try Mrs. Hudson's one, but before doing it, he asked:
One time, Mycroft came to check on Sherlock, as he always did and found out that John was living with him too. Mycroft didn't like the idea, he started disliking John either. The doctor, on the other hand, didn't know why Mycroft was so cold towards him. Poor John was clueless.
Suddenly, Sherlock pulled away. Both of them looked into each other's eyes, out of breath and panting. They both were still entwined, but far enough so their lips didn't touch. After John could finally breathe, he broke out into a grin, Sherlock answering him. John put his hand on Sherlock's neck and leaned in so he could touch Sherlock's forehead with his own. John closed his eyes, breathing in, still smelling disinfection of off Sherlock.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock whispered over and over again, burying his face into John's neck and smelling his scent. Oh how he missed it. He missed everything about his blogger.
“Men.” Sherlock answered, as John undid last button and threw his shirt away, looking at the exposed chest right in front of him. His hands started to slowly travel around Sherlock’s chest, sending goosebumps through his body. Sherlock felt warm hands running through his chest, everywhere it was exposed. Every touch felt like fire, the place burning when it was touched. It felt warm, safe.
He failed today which left him frustrated and full of need. John tried watching telly, clicking through channels, but nothing worked. His leg was moving up and down quickly, what he never did. John was growing impatient for no reason. He also tried writing his blog, but it didn’t work too. John tried to ignore his frustration as much as possible, but he just couldn’t do it. After a failed orgasm, he needed more, wanted more.
"Of course not. Take your best men and follow him. Don't interrupt unless necessary. Nobody needs to know you are there." Greg nodded and and they all left the flat, leaving Mycroft standing alone in the middle of the room.
John could feel Sherlock’s hot breath on his neck. The detective leaned in, to bite hard on John’s neck, making sure to leave a mark, to show everybody who he belongs to. He leaned back up to meet his eyes with John, the doctor seeing colours dance in the detective’s eyes. His eyes were magic. Sherlock leaned in to kiss John, his thrust becoming slower. Without John expecting, Sherlock thrusted hard into John, finding his prostate and making John let out a sound, which didn’t sound like a moan or a groan. It was more like an animal howl.
One casual day, particularly January 29th, Sherlock woke up as usual and decided to spend his day at St. Bart's. That day, Molly brought in a new body. Of course she tried to flirt with him and ask him out, but he didn't have any interest in her. Sherlock didn't have any interest in woman to be particular. It was no secret he had no interest in woman, Molly just didn't see it.
John suddenly remembered times before the fall. He remembered how he started looking differently at Sherlock. How he saw real Sherlock behind that mask. Maybe he was even falling in love. He didn't know that. It was too long ago. But he remembers the fall really clearly. He remembers what Sherlock said to him, how he jumped. The thing that John couldn't stop thinking about, before he met Mary, was when he searched for pulse, he saw colors. Bright colors. But there was no pulse. That was the clue for John, that Sherlock was in fact alive. He was just blind to see.
It was too silent. Too silent for such a long time. He hated this room; he hated the silence and the only sound in the room. He hated it all.
"Well, I certainly hope you've learned your lesson. As it turns out, you're needed." Sherlock's heart stops for a little second and he instantly thinks that something happened to John, but he has to calm down. He keeps it cool and answers sharply:
A teenager behind Sherlock was getting impatient so he just walked around him. Or was it she? Or both? Who knew? Sherlock would have, but he didn’t look up he didn’t deduce them. He just ignored it all, minding his own business.
"I've only been gone four minutes." Mycroft chuckles a little bit, but he knows it's no time for fun. Sherlock begins to wonder what Mycroft wants, he just sent him out of the country. Tears are still rolling down his cheek, as he desperately tries to wipe them.
There was one exception and only one. People have said, that when they met the love of their life, and when they touched, the world changed, black and white disappearing. If they kept touching, the colors stayed, but if they stopped touching and being together, the colors faded and everything became black and white again. That's how you knew that you met your soulmate. You started seeing colors.
Thank you for reading this story! This is the final chapter and there will be no more surprises. I might write little one shot, I guess they will always take place after this chapter, so basically John and Sherlock will always be together. That's IF I was to write any more additional chapter. This was to pay for the pain the last one might have caused and I'm not sorry for that. But I hope you liked this story. Thank you again for reading, commenting and leaving kudos! <3
"Twins indeed!" Moriarty laughed again. "Remember Richard Brook? You thought it was all just an act. Well that's where you're wrong, Sherlock. I had a twin brother. The day you met Richard Brook, it wasn't me. On the rooftop, where Moriarty killed himself,
John's legs started to shake and he could feel himself falling down. His hand found it's way on his mouth, his eyes staring at Sherlock in disbelief. John just couldn't believe it. It was just a magic trick. But then he found himself in Sherlock's arms. He felt the warmth from Sherlock and he knew that Sherlock actually came back. Sherlock buried his face in John's neck, as he could feel relief and tears that were threatening to fall. John was shaking and sobbing, hugging Sherlock and never wanting to let go. Sherlock was holding John as tightly as possible.
It all happened slowly. Sherlock had a lot of scenarios in his mind, but he never imagined the one that actually happened. The real one was so much better then all of the others he had imagined, even if it was simple, but it was real.
A painful reminder to all. To Sherlock. He closed his eyes and looked down. He could feel panic and his heart rate rising. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He could feel himself shaking, hearing his pounding heart. Sherlock knew what was happening and he tried to control his breathing. Breathing in and out and doing it again, slowly. It was harder than ever. Sherlock slowly sat down on the soaked grass. He hugged his knees and put his head on them.
The only sound John heard was a faint beeping in the background, which only showed that Sherlock was still alive.
"Do your parents know?" John asked, his voice barely audible, almost like a whisper, but enough for Mycroft to hear. Mycroft didn't look at him, but John knew that they didn't. John only nodded and stood up to walk back to Sherlock.
"Interesting thing, a tuxedo. Lends distinction to friends, and anonymity to waiters." Sherlock's voice rang when John looked down, his eyes slowly brewing up with tears. Here he was, his best friend, who died two years ago, standing in front of John. It was understandable that John was loss for words. A lot of emotions rose in John's chest and he didn't know which one to express first.
John's heart skipped a beat. There was Sherlock, lying on the ground, his hands tied with chains, his head was tilted and the detective was looking at the doctor. Sherlock's eyes were filled with horror but also relief. He didn't think that John will come looking after him. He was happy that it was John that came here, but also scared. He can't save him. Not this time. Maybe never.
He heard the voice even louder, but still couldn't figure out what it was saying. But that didn't stop him from trying. He decided to focus on something simple, like moving a finger.
"England." says Mycroft to answer his brother. Sherlock doesn't know what that means, but he is relieved it's nothing to do with John. From Mycroft's answer it was obvious he is coming back. Suddenly he hears Mycroft silently say, three words only: "He is back." which makes Sherlock's heart stop. He lets out a shaky breath and slowly nods, even if Mycroft can't see him. He ended the conversation and looked through the window.  Sherlock just now realized that he will have to face John again. Sherlock's heart jumps at the thought of him. Now he really needs to take a hold of himself. He quickly jumps out of his seat and runs to the bathroom to look at himself. His eyes are sure a bit red, so he quickly washed his face even if it will have no use. He controls his breathing, breathing in and out, calming himself down and slowly concealing his feeling. After all, Sherlock comes back to his seat, because they will be landing soon.
He could breathe in. He felt everything. He was back. Everything was back. He could feel the pain but it didn't matter.
"Let's make the game even more interesting!" Moriarty said, clapping his hands together. Both Sherlock and John slowly turned to look at Moriarty while he turned a bit to look at Mary and she suddenly caught what he meant. Sherlock looked up at Mary to see her turning her gun towards John.
That's how many days Sherlock was in coma. And with every day the number grew. That was the part John hated. The growing number.
"I'm sorry to say this, but the baby didn't survive." John breathed out, his heart dropping. He didn't realize he was holding his breath. John closed his eyes and lowered his eyes. Sherlock saw that John won't answer, so he answered the doctor himself.
It was hard to leave him, but Mycroft was right. John needed a little bit of rest. Since that night, John always slept in hospital, besides Sherlock. He woke up for any movement, expecting it to be Sherlock but to only find out it was a nurse. John did leave hospital to go and change clothes, take a bath, sometimes eat, but he never spent over five hours out of hospital.
Sherlock looked down, his panic rising. Sherlock knew that John will do something to him. He will hit him at least. Scream at him. Shout at him. But John felt whole love come back to him. He couldn't be angry at Sherlock. He is alive, standing right here. That's what John wanted, right? That's what John asked for. He asked for one more miracle.
"What if I shoot you now? Nobody would stop me." Moriarty giggled in answer. John's words reminded him of Sherlock, just before he walked out of the pool. And it sounded amusing! John and Sherlock were so in sync and they both didn't even realize that. Moriarty said nothing after all, but all of them knew that John won't shoot Moriarty. Not now anyways.
John and Sherlock started to solve cases together. Sherlock couldn't help himself, but he could feel connection between them. And looking at John, Sherlock knew, that he felt the same way. They connected very quickly and in just a little amount of time.
In that one year, Sherlock travelled around killing people. He never really killed people, but every time he heard the gunshot, and Sherlock knew it was himself who shot, his inside shook and he felt sick. But he had to protect John.
Sherlock stopped to look up. He knew he was close, there was no need in stopping now. But he looked up anyway. Indeed, he was very close to his destination. A shaky breath escaped his lips, as he started walking again, this time his eyes following the entrance to the field. He finally reached the gate. It was closed, rusty metal gate that seemed to not hold any purpose anymore. Slowly, he reached with his hand to open it, but saw it shaking. He looked at it for a few seconds, his mind racing with unwanted memories he would rather not remember right now, but today was that day. He quickly clenched his hand into a fist and lowered it down, opening the gate with the help of his shoulder.
“Bad morning?” Sherlock said, smirking. He deduced that earlier, but he had to ask. He had to hear that from John even if everything was just screaming a plain yes. John groaned in return and looked at Sherlock.
"You see them?" Sherlock slowly asked, his voice sounding careful and vulnerable. John's smile just grew bigger, if that was even physically possible. John gave a small nod. He could see how Sherlock's eyes light up, full of hope. A small smile appeared on his face and he was happy too. It was finally happening. John's chest made a little thing and it was tickling.
When the clock passed ten p.m., John finally decided to sleep. Without even noticing, he already stood in Sherlock's bedroom. He couldn't help himself, but John slowly lay down. He felt as if Sherlock was sleeping next to him. The whole bed, the whole room was filled with him. John closed his eyes, with peace in his chest and had a peaceful sleep without any nightmares. It was only a little bit more than four hours, but at least John felt rested.
