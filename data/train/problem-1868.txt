“Where?”  He couldn’t say more.
“You know how he hates boredom. Sometimes, in the past, he would get into a bit of a scuffle.” She fixed the towel that was covering the sandwiches, tracing the vine design on the cloth to avoid looking at John as she spoke.
Each time John looked at Sherlock through the lens of his camera, he became too lost in the fine lines and symmetry. The hard angles and planes knotted with tension. His whole body was poised and ready to strike. He used his hits to the best advantage, never wasting energy. The whole match took less than 2 minutes.
“Those are mine, and obviously not drugs.” He made his voice into steel and ducked around Mrs Hudson to stomp upstairs.
John was in a daze. He hadn’t sent any more texts to Sherlock, but he compulsively checked his phone in case he had missed any responses. He ambled into the bathroom and started the tub. He dumped some of Sherlock’s shower gel into the steamy water. The smell immediately made John long for Sherlock to come home.
“Not at all, Mrs Hudson. Is he inside?” Sherlock carefully avoided looking at her and instead studied the detritus in her dustpan.
He took a picture of the sliding panel that had been forced open and moved around the cluster of people, further into the room.
John took his picture. Tried to see him through his lens. The way the streetlamp caused the unusual blue-green of his eyes to glow. He caught the smile on Sherlock’s face a moment before he felt the hand on his shirt pulling him closer. John lowered his camera just in time, as Sherlock swooped in and kissed him. Sherlock’s lips pressed against his firmly, as if he worried John would pull back. Instead, John pressed forward harder, opening his mouth so he could capture that perfect bottom lip. John could taste London as his tongue gently skimmed over that lip. A mixture of sweet rain and bitter blood filled his senses and summed up his flatmate perfectly.
Behind the staircase, two people stood in conversation. John recognised Lestrade, who looked up as John approached.
“Dear, that is going to be a horrible black eye. What a rude man.”
“Your faces! I’m printing this out and having it hung up on a wall next to John’s stuff.” He flashed the screen of his phone towards Sherlock. The look on his face did match Mycroft's fairly well. He would have to reflect on this at a later time and determine a way to stop that from ever happening again.
Was he embarrassed, or was it something else?  Looking at the equations on the board, and knowing about the note waiting for the doctor in his coat made him feel very vulnerable. It was a scary feeling. It was sentiment. After everything they had been through together, the fall and John’s divorce — was this the right time for this?
Fingers carded through John’s hair as he blinked open his eyes. He was laying on the small leather chaise that sat on the opposite wall from his work bench. Sherlock knelt next to him.
When he came home several hours later, his eyes went immediately to the blackboard. John had answered every question, on both sides. The chalk and marker lay side by side on the kitchen table. Nothing else was out of place. All of the answers were correct.
Seriously I love yarn. Oh and tombstones. Also I am easily distracted.. oooo Tea!
Anthea stood and picked up the file from the table. She tucked it under her arm and tugged her blackberry from her front pocket.
To calm himself, he cleaned the board. He didn’t like the sight of it anymore. It wasn’t perfect like it had been last night. He knew that Sherlock had seen his solutions, anyway.
“Except for you. I can spot at least three tells that speak of how jealous you are that John is no longer interested in an amorous relationship with you.” Sherlock’s voice matched Sebastian’s in tone, but it held a hint of amusement. John recognised it as the tone he used when verbally sparing with Anderson.
There were black and white prints of Sherlock fighting. His face blank, his fists smeared with dark streaks and at the ready. A close up of one of his bruises, the colours mixing like spilt paint, the sheen of sweat making them look wet to the touch.
“No. No problem.” John stood, put his curry leftovers into the fridge and grabbed his well-worn leather jacket and digital camera. “Let’s go.” He smiled at the taller man.
John barely registered Greg talking loudly, and suddenly they were pulled apart. Sherlock held John, checking him over for any and all signs of trauma. Greg’s hands under Moran’s armpits held him in back.
“You got it?”  John smiled.
John might also admit, if only to himself, that he felt an attraction to the enigmatic git.
“I’ve wanted to do this since I moved in.”
He took the pills and water and was quiet for a moment.
“John. Wake up.”
Sherlock opened his mouth just as Anthea’s voice came on over the intercom.
John squeezed his eyes closed, the pain in his shoulder just barely surpassed by the embarrassment he felt. He wanted to escape home to Baker Street and forget this whole night. He nodded to Sherlock, not trusting the quality of his voice.
“I did solve it. We’re going to see a suspect to be sure. Come, John, do keep up.” Sherlock jogged down the front steps to John’s car.
Sherlock looked up from his phone and spotted a cab. John often accused him of using witchcraft to get the attention of passing taxis, but really it was the suit. He raised his hand and waved it, nonchalantly. The car stopped at the kerb and Sherlock climbed in.
Now, the subject of her drinking problem always felt like an unspoken fight between them. She assumed he was checking her for signs of drunkenness and he was usually just thankful to see her.  He recognised the ebb and flow of her behaviours by now and the silence that met his text message meant that she was likely drinking again. She would not be returning his text today, or anytime soon. He sighed.
“It’s lovely that you think you’ll be leaving here today, Mr Moran, or any day.”
“We’ve arrived, Sir.”
To everyone who commented. Thank you! Some of you that commented weekly, I adore you! When I saw that you commented again, it made me giddy!
John stopped. He cocked his head in confusion.
“Fuck. Your ribs.” He stood and pulled off Sherlock’s hoodie. It seemed strange to see him dressed this way, without his usual suits. John flashed to his dream for a moment.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John. He shifted and crossed his long legs. John followed the movement and felt a tingling heat that made him forget for a moment he was soaking wet and wearing leather.
(See the end of the chapter for
The game was on. The rain be damned.
“She said you left, wearing your ugly oatmeal jumper. The one you wore when you were dating that obnoxious cocktail waitress.”
John woke up a few hours later, still groggy. Sherlock was asleep next to him, his fingertip still in the palm of John’s hand. He had fallen asleep mid-trace. John shifted and took the other man’s hand into his. He pulled it to him to place a kiss on it. Sherlock shifted and laid his head on John’s left shoulder, muttering something that sounded like ‘convex body K in n-dimensional Euclidean space…’ and then he sighed peacefully.
Sherlock gets Greg's name right, and Sherlock has a gift for his photographer.
“Oh, I didn’t have a date. I met with someone about showing some of my pictures. Don’t tell Sherlock, though; I want to surprise him.” He smiled at her. “Is he home? It was dark up there when I got in.”
“What about this interview?” Sherlock’s breath changed as John’s fingers traced around his waist.
John stood in the back where a small bar was located, waiting for people to show up. It gave him a perfect view of the whole room. He tried to double check his reflection in the nearest window glass, but the setting sun made him squint.  He had run some of Sherlock’s gel through his hair and now he wasn’t sure if he looked good or like a prat.
Getting into an underground fight club was considerably easier than John thought it would be. He just handed the stack of pounds over, and in he went.
Greg smiled at the sight of his husband and brother-in-law stunned into silence. He pulled out his iPhone and took a picture. Sherlock scowled and shifted in his seat. Greg laughed and took another picture.
“Handled. Should be here in about 10 minutes.” He sat down on John’s small couch to wait.
Sherlock’s stomach twisted in an odd way that he wasn’t familiar with. “A date? John?” He accessed information from his mind palace. His flatmate's habits had their own box; he began to sort through them.
“Don’t be absurd. Of course, you’re staying in here.”  Sherlock pulled the little plastic bag from his pocket. The bloody note had begun to darken from scarlet to brown.
“That’s not John! Listen to me, Bee, that’s not John.”  Bee?  Mycroft hadn’t used that name in over thirty years. And then the rest of his brother’s words penetrated. Mycroft was usually hard to read, but through his tears, Sherlock saw his brother’s open expression and knew he spoke the truth. His heart rejoiced cautiously. Mycroft’s words echoed through his mind palace, calming the riot of thoughts.
“They look worse than they feel.” He stepped into the tub behind John and folded himself down. Sherlock’s skin felt like cool silk as it slid against John’s. He stayed leaning forward as Sherlock positioned himself as best he could. His long legs were a bit of problem. John let out more water so it wouldn’t overflow.
John picked up the book he had started last week, but his mind was all over the place. He set his book down across the arm of his chair. He checked his phone and sent a text to his sister Harry.
John waited a beat, then another. Sherlock shifted his weight from one foot to the other and back again. Amusement bubbled in John’s chest, and he smiled at Sherlock. He could feel confusion and excitement humming across his skin, prickling the little hairs on his arms.
“Leave it Sally. Just leave it.”  Lestrade raised an eyebrow at Sherlock. Sherlock shrugged.
The doctor came out then and notified them that John was fine. He was already in a room. The bullet pierced through his right bicep, but there was very little damage. Mycroft followed his brother and watched as Sherlock lowered the bed rail and laid his head on the unconscious man's good arm. He held his hand and whispered something that sounded a lot like theorems. Mycroft decided he didn’t want to know. He left the two together, stepping outside and nearly running into Gregory in the waiting room.
Mild violence from consensual bare knuckle fighting.
“Sally, I can suggest some product for your hair if you’re going to insist on staying the night at Anderson’s house when his wife is away.” Sherlock turned his back on her to focus on John. “How long will it take for you to print those pictures? May I get them tonight?”
The ache in his shoulder and knees pulled him from his debate and he stood, ignoring the cracking of his knees. He pulled up Sherlock’s pants as he went, letting the other man fix his gi himself. John rested his head on Sherlock’s sternum.
“It will always add up to this John, know that you are meant to be mine. I’ve been yours for so long. I just didn’t know how to say it. Of course, you surprised me by changing the language from one that I had no words for to one that I did.”
“No,” he said, “He isn’t.”
John just nodded to her as he pulled out his phone and sent Sherlock a text.
“You used the Le Miel des Merveilles?” Sherlock blinked at John and then at his cup. He removed the headphones and laid them on his lap.
“John, dear, is that you?” Mrs Hudson’s voice traveled down the short hallway.
John licked his lips to taste the bitter flavor of Sherlock’s pre-come. Then he glossed his mouth along Sherlock's shaft. The taste of Sherlock on the tip of his tongue made him moan, a hint of soap and the hot sweetness of Sherlock’s skin. He brought his right hand up to cup Sherlock’s bollocks, tugging them gently. Sherlock whined. His fingers fisted a handful of John’s hair. John wrapped his left hand around the base of Sherlock’s cock. His thumb traced the vein that ran the length of the shaft.
John walked over to the small bookshelf in the corner of the room. Each volume was lined up perfectly, as they had been that day. The dust even looked the same.
John patted Mrs Hudson on the arm and allowed her to lead him through the crowd. He held the ice pack to his face and ignored the comments and the clicking sound of someone taking a picture. Even in the midst of his public humiliation, the idea of Moran selling guns made his skin crawl and set his teeth on edge.
Sherlock attempted to put on his shoes and flinched. John huffed at the stubborn man and knelt to help him.
“Sherlock has nothing to do with it.” John crossed his arms over his chest. He scanned the room looking for his lover. He wanted Sebastian to leave before the other man showed up.
Sherlock sauntered out of the bedroom dressed, as usual, in a bespoke suit. He stood at the door, pulling on his Belstaff and watching John carefully.
The experiment continued for weeks. Sherlock never saw him completing the problems. He would fill the boards with equations and leave. John would answer them when he was alone. There were a few times when they had a case and came home to the board filled with problems, but John would never solve them like he did the first night with Sherlock in the room.
Mycroft gave him a small smile. He nodded to Anthea, leaving her to watch over his brother and John.
It was at his sixth crime scene that he met Sherlock Holmes.
John took a deep breath and exhaled through his mouth. What was he going to wear? He dashed upstairs to his room, taking the steps two at a time, opened his dresser, and began to pull out his favourite t-shirts.
He peeled his clothes off and kicked them into the corner of the loo. His whole body felt like a roadmap of pain. The bruising around his eye was bad and he knew it would worsen as he slept. He couldn’t believe that wanker sucker punched him.
As John and DI Lestrade chatted idly about sports scores, another man joined them. He wore head to toe coveralls. The blue paper made the grisly scene seem comical. No one else had donned the paper coveralls. John hadn’t even seen where they were, so he suspected that this man brought them with him.
“Um, sorry Sherlock, I couldn’t help it. I didn’t mess up evidence, I hope.”  He shrugged his shoulders and refused to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “I’ll be right back.”  The blond man dashed up to his room and slammed the door.
John paced closer to the board, holding a fresh piece of chalk.
Sherlock won't work with Anderson.
“I thought you were married to your work, you git.” John gently bit Sherlock’s lip, sucked on it. He tasted a fresh hint of blood and stopped. He tried to see it in the dim light. .
“Yes. I liked that shade of blue. It made me think of your eyes. At first, I kept it for that reason, but then I thought of this.” Sherlock touched the surface of the glass with his fingertip and then kissed John’s neck.
“Sherlock, we need to get out of this rain. I need to look at your ribs. We both need hot showers.” John peppered kisses along Sherlock’s jaw as he spoke.
“I’m not very good with relationships, John. Nor am I good at sentiment. But I want you to know I want this. I’m sorry I left you behind. I won’t promise never to do it again, because I will. Always remember I do not forget you, I’m just…”
John’s anxiety slowly dimmed, and he started to wonder if he
He smirked. John directed his attention back to the rutted track that led out of the hills, though he did steal an occasional peek at the man sitting beside him.
“That feels lovely, Lock.”  John was slipping into sleep. He wanted to remember this forever. He opened his eyes to watch for another moment, but he was fading fast.
The rain trickled down the back of his neck, under the collar of his jacket. John wondered if Sherlock could see steam from where the icy water touched his heated skin. Sherlock pulled the zip of his jacket down, and thrust his hands under John’s shirt to touch skin. John could feel the calloused pads of violinist fingertips cataloguing and memorizing his flesh, leaving warm trails in their wake.
“Get your camera. I’m not shy. I would rather these pictures not go up on a wall in a gallery, but I’d like to see them on paper.” Sherlock dropped a reassuring kiss against John’s hair.
“If we must.” He didn’t move. He slouched down a little, angling his hips so he could slot John’s against his. Their hard cocks met and they both moaned. The pain and pleasure mingled together as John worried briefly that the zipper of his jeans would leave an imprint on his prick.
The crescendo of noise around him amped up as the big one fell and didn’t get back up. John fought every urge he had not to rush to check on him. He let out his breath when he saw the man’s friends come collect him from the ring. His body was slick with sweat and blood; his head lolled as they dragged him out. The other man was wobbly but left on his own, one of his buddies guiding him through the crowd with a hand on his shoulder.
The voice that rumbled out did not match the body in John’s opinion. This man was long and lean, almost lanky, and the voice was a rich baritone, deep and molten.
When he found a spot close enough to see the ring, he sucked in a breath. The two men fighting looked like they had each been in a head-on collision. Both of them were around the same height, but one had considerable bulk on the other. The muscular one was lisping, his steps uneven, and his face was so swollen as to be barely human any longer. His opponent had more energy in his step, but he was almost equally bad off.
John pulled off his jacket and let it drop to the floor. John never did that; Sherlock made a note of it. His breath was steady but louder than usual. Sherlock sidled closer to him. John swayed slightly back and forth on the balls of his feet. Keeping a cadence all in his hips and Sherlock found himself watching the way John’s arse looked as he did it. Utterly forgotten were the honey sticks – more so the dead maths teacher.
The final chapter of the first story! John has his gallery showing, with an unpleasant guest.
The sight of Sherlock’s microscope brought him again to mind. He debated calling and leaving a voicemail. He worried his bottom lip, wondering if he should text Greg and see if he had any better luck reaching them.
“A relationship? John Watson doesn’t do relationships. He just gets on his knees and opens his mouth for the next available prick.” Sebastian shoved his finger into Sherlock’s chest and that made John snap.
“I’ll walk barefoot, then. I. Don’t. Need. Your. Help.” He limped away, holding his ribs.
“I don’t know where he goes off to; I’ve just seen him when he gets home.” She tsked.
“No, Gregory, we’re going to the office. We need something more secure.”
“Tell me about it.” Sherlock gingerly stood, his hand holding his ribs. Even while in pain, John could see his feline grace as the other man started to investigate the pictures hanging to dry.
Deciding his bladder needed some attention, he staggered into the loo. Whenever his shoulder acted up, he felt all the other joints in his body more acutely. He listened to the creaks as he walked. After his usual daily ablutions were completed, he felt more awake and ventured into the kitchen for a cuppa. He was pleased to see the kitchen table clear of its usual mess of experiments, ready for a morning spread. John filled the kettle with water and turned it on. He opened the designated “clean” cupboard and picked the two mugs closest to him.
“Yes, well, of course, John. Sentiment. Please hand me my towel. The grey one, your towels are scratchy.” Sherlock pulled away and stood up gracefully.
“Just come to C, when you get home. I’ll be working down there.” John laid his hand over Sherlock’s and flattened it so he could slide his fingers between the other man's.
A sleek black sedan sat at the kerb. John wondered briefly if Mycroft had his cars made so they looked as nondescript as possible.
Sherlock wore low-slung black gi pants with drawstrings tied tightly. They displayed the contours of his hips and perfectly defined abs, which glistened with sweat. He had clearly already been in a fight. John could make out the beginning of several bruises decorating his body. The sweat made them appear like watercolour tattoos, hints of purples and dark reds. His nose had bled at some point but wasn’t any longer. Dried blood crusted around one of his nostrils. His hair was a riot of dark, shiny, wet curls.
“You can’t afford London, not on a salary from the Met and I could use a flatmate and assistant. I’ve spoken with the landlady and you can use the downstairs flat as a darkroom until she rents it out. That will never happen, the room gets practically no natural light, but there you are.” Sherlock drew back as he finished blurting out his deductions. His eyes had been quick as lightning as he spoke; they now narrowed down to the mess on the floor.
“It’s from that case I went on yesterday with Lestrade. The murdered secondary maths teacher.”  Sherlock broke away from his contemplation of the equations to check out what John had brought him from the shop.
“Don’t touch that board again, Donovan.”  Captain John Watson’s voice came from the kitchen. He hadn’t yelled, but he wasn’t quiet either. He was commanding. Sherlock glanced at Sally. She had been idly running her finger along the board, purposely messing up the equation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I had something made for you.”
The misunderstanding over the drugs bust is cleared up. However, a mystery man from John's past shows up at Baker Street.
“I never foresaw this when I returned to London, you know.”
John was exhausted. His shift at the clinic had gone horribly. He, in fact, would rather go back to Afghanistan than ever return to the clinic during flu season.
“Why are you so keen for John to take this job, Colonel?” A familiar deep baritone rumbled behind John. Sebastian looked up as Sherlock stepped up to stand beside John.
“You’re married to his brother?” John tried to imagine what a sibling to the man in front of him would resemble.
He wanted to climb next to John’s body. He wanted to hold him until the warmth of his skin was cool, and then he would follow him. They would be buried together. Sherlock was sure his tombstone was still standing in that little cemetery, the one where John Watson had begged him not to be dead. John had wanted a miracle then, and now Sherlock would give anything he possessed for the same.
“I consider what you’re doing as foreplay. Just warning you.”  John yawned and settled into the bed more.
“John is one of the bravest men I’ve ever met.” Greg shook his right fist out, wincing. Moran held his nose, moaning as blood spurted between his fingers.
A cold hand touched his cheek and he could smell fresh baked biscuits and lavender sachet.
The main ring was surrounded by at least 60 men, all screaming and waving money at different bet takers. There was a giant green chalkboard covered in names and figures. John didn’t have time for that. Instead, he kept scanning the crowd.
“Days?! Lestrade I need those pictures immediately. The rain and Anderson have ruined this scene.”
Sherlock took in the entire scene before him. The two-way mirror framed it, in a way.
A black car pulled over to the kerb next to them a few minutes later.
“How long?” Sherlock didn’t move, his eyes highlighted by the artificial light of the microscope.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why maths, John?”  Sherlock gave him two pills and the glass of water.
Sherlock hummed against John’s mouth. Then he pulled back and wrapped his scarf around his neck. With a boyish grin that made the blue in his eyes stand out, Sherlock was out the door and stomping down the stairs.
“I didn’t fucking say anything about Moriarty. I don’t know who the fuck that is.” Sebastian finally spoke up. His face a bloody mess.
He pulled back, letting his lips tease the underside of the tip, and then took him deeper, finding a rhythm. When he felt the head of Sherlock's cock against the back of his throat, he relaxed his muscles and swallowed. Sherlock trembled, his cock swelling. John sucked harder and bobbed faster. Each time that John pulled back, he felt the tension humming through Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock traced the length of his neck, from collar bone to jaw line, with his fingertips.
He wasn’t sure if Sherlock was standing on his own or if he was holding the other man up. John didn’t care, he savored the way Sherlock’s body sagged against his in post orgasmic bliss. He palmed his neglected erection and hissed. John debated unzipping and taking himself in hand. He knew it would only take a few tugs and he would come hard enough to alert Mrs Hudson that more than film was developing. That is, if they hadn’t already.
“Ah, there you are. Good morning. Tea and toast?” He gave the teaspoon a single tap on the rim of the mug.
“Be careful, John. He’s more sensitive than he lets on, you know.” She smiled as she watched him climb the stairs.
John had decided to forego stopping by his flat to change and now regretted it. He looked down at his scruffy trainers, jeans, and vintage Clash T-shirt. He rearranged his gear bag and hurried up the steps, waving his ID at the copper who stood in front of one of the stately columns. John learned early on just to follow the ebb and flow of people at crime scenes.
That was it. Sherlock looked up at his brother and smiled.
“I shouldn’t be long. What will you do today?”
“Wait, did you just ask me to move in with you?” John frowned and glanced down at his shoes. They were both standing on the remains of books and glittering shards of glass. John shuffled his foot to knock a piece of bluish green glass off the book.
“I won’t go unless he’s the forensic photographer.” Sherlock stood up and dropped his blue dressing gown off his shoulders into a heap of satin on the floor.
“I am married to my work. You’ll just have to be my mistress. Problem?” Sherlock popped his P and rubbed his nose along John's jaw. John was enjoying the oddity of Sherlock slumped down enough that they were almost face to face. He was surprised by the ease with which Sherlock was holding this position.
“Oh dear, don’t be silly. That man started it.” Her hand moved to the back of John’s neck and he hung his head in shame nonetheless.
“Be careful, Watson,”
“I love that you made me a gift from a murder weapon. That is so strange and yet so us.” John splashed Sherlock playfully, but his shoulder was still sore.
“It’s a dangerous game, brother mine. But the web is large and I will crush the spider who makes its nest in the middle.” Mycroft paused and looked at him. Sherlock felt the conviction of his brother's words when their eyes met. Mycroft opened his mouth to speak again, but was interrupted by a boisterous laugh.
With his new purchase in tow, he made his way out of the store to the narrow two lane road. The skies were filled with grey clouds and a chill of impending rain was in the air. His brother texted him again.
“We’ll go to the flat straightaway." Sherlock glanced around the car, then looked back to his phone. His thumbs flew across the keyboard.
“You can’t leave the building.” Sally’s voice carried after him. John noticed her poking around in the old tea canister he used to hold USB drives.
“What? Why would I leave?” Lestrade looked away from the man at the table to his husband.
No longer having to conceal his recent purchase, Sherlock bounded up the stairs to the flat. He didn’t bother to step over the stupid squeaky 14th step because John wasn’t home. The detective decided that dates were stupid, John was an idiot, and sentiment was the most ridiculous thing ever.

Once safely inside, he looked at the record again. Sherlock could almost see his reflection in the inky blackness of the freshly pressed vinyl.
The blackboard went back to NSY. Sherlock purchased a new slightly larger one that flipped over. One side was for chalk, and the other was a white board that used markers. It was on wheels for ease of movement. He filled both sides with problems that were marginally more difficult than the ones that had been on the maths teacher’s board. Then he left the package of chalk and dry erase markers out for John to find when he came downstairs to get ready to go to work.
“This is tedious. Please tell me you obtained photographs of the scene before it began to rain.”
“John, wait here.” Sherlock pressed his hand to John’s chest, his voice low and soothing.“I’m going to help Greg escort the Colonel outside.”
“Did you get to see any of them?”
The scene was something out of a horror movie. Two bodies, both without heads, laying on their backs, holding hands. However, Sherlock quickly deduced the window had been forced open, something that Anderson had missed. He found the pair of shoe prints confirming that two people had dragged the bodies in and set them up.
“You’re upset?” Sherlock took the bottle and sipped. John fought the urge to laugh to laugh at his resulting grimace. He tilted his head. “I don’t understand why you’re upset.”
“Who are you interested in?” Sherlock’s voice was low. John could feel the other man’s intense gaze roaming over him, cataloging any tells that John might have.
“Count on it.” Sherlock picked up his toast and took a large bite. By the time he finished the first slice he could not hide his pleased smile. As soon as the last bite passed his lips he stood and rushed into the bedroom to change so he could go to the Met.
The board sat cleaned. That had become part of their ritual.
“You don’t happen to have any blood-red velvet waistcoats do you?” John traced the bruising along Sherlock’s ribs.
Mrs Hudson filled in the quiet with idle chit chat ranging from his show, to Mrs Turner cheating during mahjong. The ride home went by quickly.
One whole wall was nothing but shelves filled with vinyl records, in alphabetical order by  band and then further indexed by type of music and year. Each album was held in plastic. As a man with a complicated sock index, Sherlock was greatly impressed.

“So, is it me, or is John Watson a bloody hedgehog of doom?  That guy is scary. I thought you and your brother were scary, but I saw the two guys who lived. They aren’t going to be breaking into clinics to steal drugs or hurt anyone anytime soon.”  Lestrade toasted the notion with his cup of weak coffee.
The next morning, Sherlock woke early and sat on the couch staring at the ‘Continuum Hypothesis’ that was on the board. He remembered the professor talking about how ‘one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation in all cases.’  To Sherlock, this was more romantic than any love poem, the one-to-one correspondence between elements of the two sets. He realized he was writing John love poems, and John was finishing them for him, and giving them back to him. The realization made his chest tighten. He pulled out a sheet of his best writing paper and tore it in half. With his favorite writing pen, he wrote: {banana, pear, apple} and beneath that {yellow, green, red}. He thought about it a moment, then folded the note and wrote {John} and beside that {Sherlock}.
The rolling hills of wild grass John drove past were overgrown, but lush and green. A grand manor came into view just as he crested the hill. He followed the small road and beheld what was clearly the crime scene. The line of police cars and emergency vehicles seemed foreign in the grand circular driveway in front of the manor. He parked behind the last car and grabbed his gear from the boot. He peered up at the facade of the building, still striking even with the damage of neglect. He slung his gear bag over his right shoulder.
He hadn’t spoken to John since he’d left that morning. He’d been eagerly waiting for John to get his note and text him.
Sherlock slid his left hand down John's wet arm until he came to his wrist. He pulled it up and slipped a braided leather bracelet onto it. “It’s been waterproofed. I know we get into all kinds of things with The Work.” He spoke the last matter of factly. Sherlock let go of John’s wrist and wrapped his arms around him. John snuggled back into him further.
“Maybe you can pose for me, so I don’t have to sneak up on you.” John’s cheeks heated as he imagined taking pictures of Sherlock right now. “You know, like when you look like this.”
“Oh, god yes, Sherlock. Yes.”
“My brother felt it prudent to escort Moran to his office for questioning. I accompanied them.” Sherlock peeled his black shirt off and tossed it towards John’s pile of clothes.
“Why this book?”  Sherlock took the note and put the book back where it belonged.
Alexandre Stern honey on Sherlock’s toast was a guaranteed way to pull the genius out of his mind palace. Sherlock considered it playing dirty, but to John, a man had to do what a man had to do.
“I’m curious as to what evidence one would find on the ceiling, Doctor Watson.”
“Mmmphh. Not thinking about it, I need curry and sleep. Like our first night together, only I can do what I wanted back then.” John pushed away from Sherlock to climb out of the tub.
“I can do this all night, John. I have the numbers in my mind palace.”  His tracing was exact and gently rhythmic.
John arrived at Baker Street, feeling both exhausted and recharged. His meeting with Sarah had gone much better than he had anticipated and he couldn’t wait to surprise Sherlock. He stood on the stairs, listening for him, but heard nothing. If he’d gotten a case, Sherlock would have texted. He checked his phone, in case he had missed any messages.
“Why didn’t you?” Sherlock leaned his head back and exhaled a deep sigh, melting against the wall.
“What is it, Lestrade? I’m busy.” Sherlock raised his head and peered at his brother-in-law. Greg stood at the mantel. He lifted Sherlock’s skull and looked inside. Then he carefully put it back and turned to address the prone man on the couch.
John had showered.
“You’re going to have to start taking new pictures for your next show.”
“I had hoped you’d be amenable.” Sherlock undid the button to his trousers and pushed them down until he could kick them to the side. He smirked at John and bent over to retrieve something from his pocket. Sherlock held it in his fist.
“Oh, I'm all right.” John slid forward in the tub, the water sloshing against the sides. “Are you getting in?”
Moran sat at a metal table. Its gleaming surface was covered in small scratches. The kind that often happens after repeated cleanings. Even with his nose broken, his wrists handcuffed to the table, with a bright hot light over his head, Moran appeared cool and calm. His spine was ramrod straight. The posture reminded Sherlock of John for a moment and he dismissed it.
“Chymico-Physical Doubts & Paradoxes.’  It felt fitting at the time.”  He had half his shirt off when Sherlock put the note down and helped him draw it the rest of the way down. Between the two of them, he managed to get on a clean t-shirt. John wanted a shower, but he was in pain and wanted sleep more.
“It looks pretty impressive from here.”
“We?” John’s eyes widened, and he licked his lips. “You got all of that from my pictures?”
He grabbed his phone and wallet and left to find a record player. He was a genius, after all, how hard could it be?
He slipped underwater and stayed there for a moment. The stillness helped sooth his nerves.
“Mine’s not quite as impressive as yours.” John huffed a laugh as Sherlock sucked harder on his throat. John moaned and pressed his aching cock against Sherlock’s hip.
“I think a marker would be better. One of those washable ones. Unless you wanted to leave it longer, so others could see.”  Sherlock pulled the covers up over John and picked up his letter. “Do you want me to read this?”  His voice sounded slightly sad.
This time, the words were Mycroft’s as he grabbed Sherlock’s shoulder and pulled him away.
John had announced that morning that he had hidden Sherlock’s cigarettes, and Sherlock wanted them back. He debated whether sneaking up the second set of stairs into John’s room was worth the trouble. Really, if John found him in his room, it would be his own fault.
John stood in the middle of an empty stage, illuminated by flickering gaslight. A sea of faded red seats spanned the space in front of him.
“Soon, John.” Sherlock went back to his microscope and John left. He was unsure if Sherlock meant he’d be home soon, or if soon meant... other things. Either way, it sent a warm tingle throughout his body.
“You left and didn’t answer my texts. I had no idea where you were.” John let some water out and restarted the hot.
Sherlock didn't respond. John considered sending a text to Greg, but in the end he just wanted to get home and take a long hot bath. Mycroft would surely be the voice of reason. Right? John shook his head, which made his face hurt and that made him angrier.
We love it when people send us messages! Especially if they want to share fics!
John’s anger rushed back to life and he trembled as the import of Mycroft’s words sunk in. “You absolute cock. I can’t believe you. I would never buy or sell guns. Those fuckers are the reason we lose men. Probably the reason I can’t be a surgeon. You unbelievable arsehole.”
“Sure. Who is Gavin?” John fished it out of his pocket, stood, and handed it to him.
John felt heated drops on his skin. A red rain from a fathomless sky poured down on him. The drops left smears of red across his skin. He looked up expecting to see clouds, but instead it was nothing but a black sea of stars. When he looked down, the stage was gone and he wore his combat fatigues.
Oh and that mysterious record is explained!
“Here, you’re still soaking. I can give you a jumper or something if you want to change. I’m pretty sure none of my trousers will fit you.” John chuckled.
An hour later Sherlock could hear John moving around upstairs in his room. The bell rang, and Sherlock knew it was Lestrade, the detective always pressed the bell twice in quick succession. He held a groan back when he saw that Lestrade had Sally Donovan in tow. Seeing her, this early was enough to sour his stomach for the rest of the day.
“Mathematical love note?  Ohhh…. I get it now. Yes, let’s go home, Myc, and have a bath. I’ll even turn my phone off.”
John could smell Sherlock's body, the sweat of the fight, the blood. It was a concentration of their life together. Running through London, the thrill of the chase. It drove John crazy with desire. Sherlock’s mouth tasted faintly of copper and something under that, a creamy hint of tea. John pushed his tongue into Sherlock's mouth for more of it. He wanted to know how Sherlock’s whole body tasted.
John leant back against Sherlock’s chest. He fit perfectly. He tried to be careful of Sherlock’s ribs, but his body melted into the chiselled chest. He was enveloped by the scent and feel of Sherlock. For the first time all night, John felt at ease. This is not how he pictured the end of the evening, but it was exactly what he needed.
John shook his head fondly, feeling a small smile tug at the corners of his mouth. He puttered around the flat for a bit, trying to focus on tidying up. John gave up and ventured into the kitchen to wash up their morning dishes. The sink filled up quickly with hot soapy suds. He reached in, grabbed a mug, and began scrubbing. The repetitive motion was soothing, and soon all the dishes were washed and drying on the rack.
John inserted more bread into the toaster for himself. Once it was done, he smeared some blackcurrant jam on it without a fraction of the care he showed Sherlock’s. He licked at a bit of jam that ended up on his finger, the tart fruit awakening his taste buds and making his stomach growl. Then he hefted the tray and carried it all into the living room.
“May I borrow your phone to text Gavin?” Sherlock asked, his eyes still trained on the scene before him.
He slammed the boot shut and walked towards the crowd of people, the police tape bright against the mouldering mason work of the old apartment buildings. John took a few pictures of the mouth of the alleyway. A few close ups of the rusted fire escapes. The lights on the police cars made his flash useless. He checked the pictures on the camera’s small screen and with a little huff of annoyance, ducked under the white and blue tape.
“No, go solve your present. It’s about time someone did. I’ll see you when you get home and then maybe we can be lazy together on the couch.” John turned and kissed Sherlock chastely on the lips.
Once outside John looked down both sides of the street. No police car, no black sedan. No Sherlock. The cross streets in front of the gallery were empty and quiet.
He slowly sat up and laid a wet flannel across his eyes. His hand searched for his beer, almost knocking it over as he grazed over it. He took a long pull on it and rested his arms along the rim of the tub, softly clinking his bottle against the porcelain in time with the music.
“Yes,” Mycroft spoke evenly.
“He doesn’t have to follow me; we’re taking my car. I’ll have the card in your office in the morning, Detective Lestrade.” John called back as he walked faster to catch up with Sherlock. The man had stopped walking and looked at John with an expression that he couldn’t make out.
He muttered a curse under his breath as he waved down a cab and climbed in. If he was lucky, Anderson had managed pictures of the crime scene before the torrential rain ruined it.The likelihood of Anderson being competent was, in Sherlock’s opinion, plus or minus 32.7%
Join me on Tumblr! I love to post Johnlock stuff, Drarry and knitting patterns.
Sherlock sat on the couch, popped a honey stick into his mouth, and let the honey ooze onto his tongue. He waited for John to come back downstairs. Sherlock made a new room in his mind palace for all the data he would be collecting.  He would have to buy a blackboard for the flat, he decided. Yes, he would need one that he could fill with all kinds of wonderful equations for his blogger.
“Buggery fuck.” His face was frozen agony, and he was worried that Sherlock was committing murder in the alleyway next to the gallery. Thank God Mycroft was there to hide the body.
“Oh, Sherlock...”
Occasionally, someone would venture up and ask him a question about a particular piece. He answered as best he could. A lot of times he didn’t know what to expect when he looked through the lense finder. It was all depended on his shutter release and luck.
following you home, Watson. He’s a psychopath. He gets off on this. He’ll probably keep the pictures you took to use later while he’s alone.” Sally tipped her head towards Sherlock.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
It had been a long night. Just when he thought he knew what was happening, the rug had been jerked out from under him again. He couldn’t get the imagine of Sherlock’s face out of his head. That guilty little boy look. He had seen it often enough on his own sister's face, his father’s face.
John staggered back, his face throbbing. He heard an indignant squawk from Mrs Hudson and a few shocked gasps from people in the crowd. John didn’t care; he was never one to back down from a fight. He charged for Moran, grabbing the white dress shirt he wore with his suit and jerked him closer.
“Scuffle? Like fighting?” John tried to make sense of what he was hearing.
Mycroft stood even straighter.
“I believe yes, but there is more. There is another man involved, his name is Jim Moriarty. He’s built himself quite a criminal empire and I know Mycroft wishes to dismantle it. We’ll look at it together. Mycroft is up to something, and I’ll know more when I see the data.”
Anthea sat down as the door slammed shut, the automatic locks clicking into place. She flipped through the file slowly. Sherlock watched as her eyes scanned it quickly.
The ride to John’s flat was short. He tried to control his shuddering while he glanced at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. Sherlock looked out the window, then pulled out his phone and began texting. He sat incredibly still, but John still felt as if the other man was fidgeting. Impatience seemed to radiate from him, and the longer he sat still, the worse it became. John sighed with relief when he spotted his building.
“I’ll handle it.” Sherlock’s voice sounded deeper than usual. John resisted the urge to kiss the throat that sex-laden voice came from and wondered if he’d done it on purpose.
Moran stretched his neck from side to side, carefully regarding the woman in front of him. “I’m not going to tell you anything, and you know that.”
Mycroft walked his brother into the hospital and deposited him in an austere waiting room. When Mycroft returned, his face was pale. Sherlock’s stomach dropped.
“Well, at least my brother is good for something.” Sherlock sighed, opened the door, and climbed in.
“Coming brother?” Mycroft paused at the door to the limo. He stood straight, his head slightly back and his eyes flicked to the open door and back to him. Sherlock nodded and followed.
“I’ll tell you everything tomorrow, when I know more. Mycroft is sending over some information. Are you ok?”
The loud click of the key in the lock alerted them that Anthea was entering the room with Moran. Everyone fell silent.
John had no new alerts.
“I thought you had to get back.” John didn’t hide the annoyance that sharpened the edges of his words. He didn’t school his face either. He wanted Moran to see that he wasn’t welcome here tonight, after all.
As he walked from Tesco to Baker Street, his mood shifted from Doctor Watson to regular old John Watson. His mind drifted. They could get Indian take-away for dinner. A nice curry sounded lovely, and perhaps he could get Sherlock to eat some. He unlocked the front door and climbed the steps to their flat. Sherlock was home; he could hear the man muttering to himself. He pushed open the unlocked door and walked inside.
Sebastian’s face, which was once so special to John, no longer held that place. When he peered into Moran’s crystal blue eyes all John saw was vast nothingness. The spark of the man he had been while John served with him was gone from those cornflower orbs.
Sherlock brought his hands to cup either side of John’s jaw. John knew that he was memorizing every detail as John placed a kiss on the head of his cock. He slowly rubbed his lips along the velvety skin. Sherlock groaned low in his throat and slid his hands into John’s hair, tugging slightly.
“Geez, Harry, have a crush?” John folded it and stuffed it back into the open drawer.
Sherlock looked feral, a dark and wild thing. John wanted to touch him. To see if he could feel the chaotic energy that he radiated.
“But this picture explains what happened.” Sherlock clicked the remote, and a pile of light grey concrete appeared.
Sherlock Holmes had asked for him. He wasn’t as annoyed to be called in on his day off, anymore. John’s small smile hid behind the camera he used as a shield.
He waited there, listening. A few minutes later, John came down his stairs, Sherlock knew he came to check the board. He didn’t turn on a light, but Sherlock could see him clearly, silhouetted by the outside light as he stood in front of the chalkboard. There his flatmate stood, wearing a faded Fraser's Chorus band t-shirt and dark pants. Sherlock could not make out the color in the dim light; he exhaled quietly, he built a room in his mind palace for how those pants accentuated John’s muscular thighs. John swayed, holding the chalk in his hand. How extraordinary he looked. His hair was almost silver in the light coming in from the windows, the chalk in his hand so white.
Greg jumped as the door opened. Another woman walked in and handed Anthea a red folder. Her blonde hair tucked behind her ears and her professional yet feminine attire screamed underling. Sherlock watched her look over the room. She had obviously heard Moran’s statement. She kept her eyes downcast, but she watched the scene as she hurried from the room.
“Where is he?” He watched her shift her weight from her good hip to her bad hip and back again. She nibbled her bottom lip. “Mrs Hudson?”
“Well, yeah.” John fought the urge to submerge himself. He licked his lips and turned his head to look up at Sherlock. He wanted to see if Sherlock liked the idea or if he was teasing him.
“What else do you see?”
John pulled his keys out and clicked the remote to unlock the car. He dumped his gear in the backseat haphazardly. He climbed behind the wheel as Sherlock made himself comfortable next to him.
Finding a record player in central London proved to be much more challenging than Sherlock had anticipated. Three hours into his adventure in music, he received a text from his meddlesome brother.
Mycroft had figured out the solution before he handed the paper to his little brother but couldn’t figure out why i < 3u had dried up Sherlock’s tears. Was it a clue to a case they were working? Leaving his sibling to his illogical responses, he wrote the whole thing out on another piece of paper and asked Anthea to look it up. When she saw it, she just smiled. Her fingers moved swiftly over her phone.
John pondered the last time he had felt so alive and came up with vague memories of uni before he went into the army. Following his instincts, as he had most of his life, he agreed to share a flat with the lanky detective.
The crowd surged towards the two fighters, some to help the fallen and others to get a better look at the carnage. John fought his way to Sherlock’s side, pushing and shoving, using his elbows as needed.
The sleeve was black and completely blank, front and back. Sherlock let the album slide out onto his palm.
“It’s a blackboard, John.”  Sherlock walked around it. He watched John out of the corner of his eyes.
John licked the tip of his finger and started to write the solutions to the equations in the chalk dust on the board. He worked fast, doing the calculations in his head and filled in the answers.  Sherlock controlled his face to hide his delight at each correctly completed equation. His John was always an intriguing puzzle.
“Fine. Come in then. Don’t touch the pans or the prints. Some of them are wet. I’m going upstairs and taking a shower.” He shook his head as Sherlock reached for him.
“Did you figure out my answer to your note?”  John smiled, but he felt a small twinge of fear that Sherlock would explain to him again that he was married to his work and that sentiment had no place in their relationship.
“Goodnight, Mrs Hudson.” He leant in and gave her a little hug and a peck on her cheek. He took another breath of her lavender sachet for strength.
“Drugs bust,” Sally smirked.
The dust was suspended in the sunlight that filtered through the window at Baker Street. Sherlock watched it with a critical eye. Five days without a case. Three days since he last froze a set of phalanges. He had tried to remove just the fingerprint to test if it was possible to leave someone else's prints at the scene of a crime. It was. However, not easy and unlikely a common criminal would go to such extreme measures. Sherlock filed it away, along with ideas for doing the same thing without the hassle. Next time his brother came for an unwelcome “visit” he'd steal the git’s fingerprints off his tea cup and test his theories.
“Tea?” John asked, stifling the odd feeling of exposure as he watched Sherlock study his work.
John couldn’t explain why he was the way he was. It was just something he’d always enjoyed.
A wounded man lay screaming in the sand. John threw himself down beside him, intent on saving him. But his pack held nothing but rolls and rolls of negatives. The screaming grew louder and deeper, a rich baritone that rumbled from the injured man’s chest.
“I think you broke my brain, John.” Sherlock sucked on John’s neck, biting and licking. Each nip made John’s cock throb. “Let’s go upstairs and I’ll see if I can break yours.”
“Oi! I’m heading back to Baker Street to start this film for you. I’ll see you in a bit?” John grabbed his gear bag and shouldered it.
It would be an interesting experiment;  prove his flatmate had a maths kink, and to what extent of a kink it was.
“I usually drop the memory card off at the lab at the Met, and they do the prints. It takes a few days, depending on the backlog.”
John tucked his Sig into the back of his jeans, pulled his favourite leather jacket over it, and jogged downstairs. He stopped just long enough to grab his bag.
John felt his stomach drop and he downed his entire glass of champagne.
“Good luck with him. We didn’t call him ‘Three Continents’ Watson because he was into monogamy. Everyone fucked him.” Moran’s voice was low, meant only for Sherlock.
“I don’t need your assistance, John. I can put on my own shoes.” Sherlock hissed and bent to grab his shoe.
The door opened, and Mycroft Holmes nodded to him. John got into the car.
“Looks like we’re alone, dear. Shall we go home? Sarah said it was ok.” Mrs Hudson appeared next to him.
“Oh Sherlock, what have you done?” The landlady fidgeted with a hanky, looking both worried and curious. She peeked around Sally to see what exactly her tenants had been up to.
For a moment, it looked like Sebastian might turn and leave, but instead, he threw a sucker punch and caught John perfectly between his eye and cheek.
“Yes, I’ll come in and pick up the paperwork.” John hung up and hoped he wouldn’t have to work with Anderson. He couldn’t stand that guy.
Sherlock carefully hid the album in his closet. He ripped the plastic dry cleaning bag off a crisply pressed white shirt and selected a Tom Ford suit, in black. Straightening his cuffs, he checked his reflection in the mirror over the mantel.
“What is it, John?”  Sherlock’s voice was soft. He held a pair of John’s pajama pants and a t-shirt.
“Sentiment.” Sherlock brushed John’s wet hair back off his forehead.
. Who’s working the scene?” Sherlock brought up the image of John, sitting on his couch eating curry while he combed over his photographs. He felt heat in his cheeks recalling how John had praised him.
Before John jumped into his car, he heard Sally call after him once again.
Melting John’s vinyl collection would certainly result in at least an eleven curse word string.
John pulled his towel off and dried himself, listening to Sherlock move around the loo. He knew that something big was coming, he could feel in the pit of his stomach. The nervous feeling he recognised from quiet moments waiting for the wounded to come while he was in Afghanistan.
Sherlock nodded and climbed the stairs as quietly as possible.
“You think you’re so fucking smart. Oh man. He is going to burn you all. You think you know what the score is, but you have no clue. It’s going to be wonderful watching him rip your hearts out.” Moran choked out another laugh. “Do me a favour Red and just shoot me. Be so much faster than what Jim will have planned, if he believes I’ve turned on him.”
ended and
“Yes.” He shook his head briskly and strode toward the car without looking back. When he reached the kerb, he waited for John to unlock the door.
“Lost my nerve huh?” John punched Moran as hard as he could. He could feel the agony from his shoulder springing back into full glory. The left hook didn’t phase Seb, who wrestled John to the floor.
One album stuck out farther than the others. The lack of a plastic cover indicated a new purchase. Sherlock pulled it from the shelf.
“I play the violin at odd hours and sometimes I don’t speak for days,” Sherlock graced John with a small smile.
Sally shook her head and walked out of the flat.
Everything finally comes together. Look for a very slight nod to Shawn of the Dead. Like barely a nod.
One of the bookies came into the ring and the cheering quieted, though there was still the dull roar of scores of people talking at once. He announced another set of fighters, but John couldn’t make out what he said from where he stood.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anderson watched a woman who was conferring with Lestrade. He puffed up his chest and strolled off to chat with her. She dressed like a woman who was trying to dress like a man. Everything about her was all business except the look on her face when Anderson approached her. The two stood near the front of the alley, both leant in a little when they spoke to each other. He snapped a few photos of them. Their body language, the way they stood, how she tilted her head up and gave him a sly secret smile made John look away.
“You knew who he was before he landed, didn’t you?” Sherlock folded his arms across his chest.
“Please.” Sherlock took in each picture in turn. His eyes roamed over them as if he was reading them instead of looking at them.
“He died of blunt force trauma. At least two hits with that lamp base to the occiput.” He pointed to the spots, then took several pictures of the lamp and the dead man’s body where he lay.
He had accepted the gift with a quick kiss on her cheek and forgot about it.
It didn’t take a doctor to point out the cause of death on one of the bodies. The other was infinitely more odd. It had been embalmed. Both were male, about the same age. The fresh body’s only wound was his missing head. The other had all the signs of having been autopsied and buried. One pass around the bodies and Sherlock was climbing out of the window to get soil samples. John’s eyes kept creeping back to their hands tangled together. They left for Bart’s as soon as Sherlock had his dirt.
Darkroom Shenanigans! Finally earning that E rating!
The small, broken sound of John’s orgasm, stopped Sherlock mid stroke. He watched as John turned sharply and looked in the direction of Sherlock’s bedroom door. Sherlock’s instinct kicked in, and he left his spot by the door, went to his bed, and laid down, his back to the door. He made no sound. He pretended to sleep, his cock throbbing. He could feel the stickiness from his pre-ejaculate on his stomach, and his pajamas felt tight and uncomfortable.
John came downstairs and found the flat empty. He was dressed and ready to go, but he didn’t want to leave. He wanted the morning back, only without Lestrade and that hateful bitch Donovan. He hated to lose his temper. It made him feel more like his father than he cared for.
“Shut up, you cheeky bastard. Now watch.” John loaded his camera and Sherlock watched, his smirk small and mischievous.
Sherlock asleep on the couch, his violin cradled in his arms, his hair glinting with drops of rain. He had finished a long and exhausting case and had just passed out tuning his violin.
“Yeah, I’ll get dressed and meet you there. I’ll probably be alone.”  His eyes drifted up to where John was no doubt changing for work.
He would get a thrill when he finished his maths homework. He excelled at it and had loved the praise it earned him. When he’d decided to be a doctor, one of his advanced maths professors tried to get him to change his mind. He had stopped taking those classes in favor of the ones he needed. He had missed it, but he set that aside. Now, the obsession was back.
They arrived on the scene to utter chaos. Donovan was nowhere to be found, Anderson, in his blue paper coveralls, walked about muttering orders that everyone ignored.
John turned the radio on. He liked music when he did most things. Sherlock changed the channel, stopping when he found classical music. John hid his brief annoyance by gripping the steering wheel and staring forward.
Sherlock sat on the middle cushion of the couch. His hair seemed more wild than usual when held down by the band of his headphones. The record player sat in front of him. Sherlock had his hands steepled under his nose in his usual mind palace pose.
