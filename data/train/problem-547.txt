"I won't see you around, Mr. Holmes. It was good to never see you again." The man stated with a wider grin.
The feeling of his duvet felt completely alien and sensuous on his naked back, arse and legs and his hand closed with purpose around the base of his penis for the first time in ages. He started with two slow strokes and grabbed the pillow next to his head to bury his face in it. This time he didn’t want to be aware of his voice.
John wanted to say something but he failed. After Sherlock's words, all of his doubts were thrown out of the window. Of course; he could never leave Baker Street, he could never leave Sherlock.
"I was about to go for a coffee..." John answered, his face the clear resemblance of blank. "Sherlock?"
"No, I'm a under a different department. It's not even in the same facility so I never saw anything, to be honest. I only heard about it yesterday." The young man sighed tiredly, "I came here all the way from the other side of London, just to find you and Mr. Holmes as soon as I heard."
"You just follow my orders so we can promise your only son is going to live. It's not that difficult, is it?" There was silence at the other side of the line and James smiled widely, "I suppose you have my four play boys?"
“Everything in its due time, Detective Inspector.” Sherlock’s eyes searched John’s who was wearing a lopsided smile and sparkling eyes. Sherlock had to fight the urge to look somewhere else.
"I know you noticed in the alley..." At Sherlock's words, John released a gulp of air restrained in his lungs "...how hard I was back then."
“Mrs Hudson!” That was Sherlock’s scream, again. “We need ginger!” A pause only filled by Rosie’s continued laughter. “Powder or root!”
“We have options.” Sherlock’s thumbs moved over John’s knuckles with so much affection John wanted to scream and have the courage to kiss this bloody man forever. “Because… you know already, don’t you. We can blame it on the aphrodisiacs because we both know what triggered th-”
“No, with Greg taking the scars-removal we should be… almost done,” John said, purposely avoiding the thing about the muscles relaxant. He placed his oily hand over Sherlock's calf when Sherlock moved his leg away.
"Thank you very much, John." Sherlock got up quickly and walked to his room. John had just started to prepare tea and when he saw Sherlock disappearing, he let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding. His heart was racing and he knew his cheeks were hot, maybe even flushed.
His eyes travelled further down, he noticed the height difference as Sherlock's ankles were much further away than his own, his knees were bending a bit, which probably caused John's left leg to fall from the sofa and his smile just widened. Then he followed the detective's hand under his own jumper and the soft grip in his shirt.
“Yeah. Alright.” He set to work, then. He cleaned Sherlock’s arms with a warm damp white towel; all the way from shoulders to the tips of the fingers.
"I don't have much of an option, Mycroft" he younger man said as he took his coat and scarf and walked out of the flat.
It was all it took for John to lose it. He had heard that word so many times directed at Sherlock... but since they were from the Yard, he never had the opportunity before and he certainly wouldn't let this one pass. He turned around and glared at the guy, faking calm.
He was walking to the stretcher when John entered the room, he had a tray in his hands and was about to place it on top of the small table when he turned and saw Sherlock.
John moved to the other bicep and Sherlock felt as if John’s fingers burned his skin. John massaged dangerously close to his shoulder below the vest, his hands passing casually under the shirt with the circular movement he was using. Sherlock was completely tensed up and because of this, his arm looked muscular, masculine. He wondered if that did something for John. In his mind, Sholto immediately appeared, his defined and masculine body, the line of Sholto’s mouth right in front of John’s forehead as they spoke. The soft smile he had for John Watson. Were they ever close like this? Did John ever massage Sholto after a hard day of war? Just because he wanted, not under the pressure of a case?
“Shut up. Twenty minutes is more than enough,” Sherlock whispered back. “Remember to call me William.”
“No, I mean it.” Martin pointed a finger to Sherlock’s body. “What’s happening to you right now is quite normal, if my suspicions are correct.”
The detective looked up and their gazes locked. John's pressure on his jaw softened and he backed up, leaving Sherlock with an appreciative grin.
“Sorry. Hello, yes. Call me Martin.” He presented his hand for a handshake. "It’s an honour to meet you, sir."
"John..." Mycroft said quietly and John's expression deepened. The man in front sighed and placed both arms in the armrests of the chair. He threw his head back and sighed again.
“It’s fine.” John saw Sherlock taking the shirt from the table and putting it back on quickly. John thought about stopping him, but it was way too much now, so he let him. John was rooted to the spot, he couldn’t get up if his life depended on it. The scars weren’t extremely dreadful but it was the story John could see in there the first time all those years ago; a story of torture, infection, neglect.
He grabbed the edge of the towel and covered what he could, but he was completely sure that his erection was in full-view for a couple of seconds. He could not see John’s face at the moment, instead, he focused on turning around with as much dignity as possible for an almost-mortified man.
"Is that the way you people always do your job? Well! I'm not surprised then, to see we have such high suicide rates in London." Sherlock walked down the stairs of the flat as he spoke, dramatically gesturing with his arms. "Not enough data!" he mimicked in a high pitched voice, clearly imitating Donovan, "and then you state it's a suicide! No wonder you are the criminals' favourite."
“We knew that, but they… our parents wanted grandchildren to take care of the business, organised crime needs an heir, they said!”
Sherlock knew that once Moriarty appeared it would be so he would fulfil his promise. That's why John's words
"Come on, Sherlock." Mycroft stood up and walked to the coffee machine, turning it up "I am your brother! You hadn't been so defensive since Victor, even though I know nothing ever happened between you two... and you weren't that closer with him as you are now with John... he was still your
The doctor startled at his own voice, his breath got trapped inside his lungs, almost with a sensation of fear. The whisper was extremely soft but it sounded incredibly loud in his ears.
Rapidly shaking his head, Sherlock threw himself over the sofa, his torso bent further over the back of the furniture, as if looking for something there. John took the hint quickly and said, loudly enough for anyone there to listen, probably was Mrs. Hudson anyway.
John stopped moving completely and there was a long pause. Neither he nor Sherlock moved, but John could feel the firm grip, the breathing at the top of the back of his head for all the agitation Sherlock had done. Then he felt how Sherlock stepped a bit closer and lowered his forehead, making it fall softly over his shoulder.
"I am sure, whoever did this, has to have some connection with the victims both here and there. Come on, John! Think! How do you think two men get killed almost at the same time, under the same circumstances, right here in London and then in Netherlands, without any sort of connection?"
kind of expression. The detective continued, turning to Lestrade now, "… of course, that wouldn't have been much for the old man's heart, but the little amount of heroin helped to build the scenario we all already know."
It had been a long day between the lab and the Yard. His body was exhausted. His mind, on the other hand, was working frantically over some digital documents that had helped him to solve the case.
Just when he had pressed enter, the door opened and Mrs. Hudson entered the flat with a couple of trays in her hands. John quickly reached out to help her. He turned on the kettle in the kitchen, arranging the mess on the table and muttering something like
"Of course you didn't..." Mycroft said with a little malicious smile and a short head shake. John rolled his eyes
Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, a smile crossing his lips. "People tend to lose their composure over such trivial matters, John. They asked for it in the first place, and if their friendship is strong enough, this should be no more than nothing."
"Move faster John, we're getting closer now." Sherlock kept on walking. By the direction they were heading to, they weren't going downtown, they were going somewhere near the bridge.
Dinner was usually about Rosie, there were very few times when John and Sherlock had dinner without fussing over her. Sherlock was talking about the products and the findings of the thermal cameras by Craig. A small shadow had passed across Sherlock’s face when he remembered how sick the old Toby was. After that, he was all about the big mafia that this could lead to, and how NSY didn’t want anything leaked to the press for it could jeopardise the whole operation.
The main entrance was a white door made of wood, surrounded by little windows and no security cameras in plain sight.
There, the older Holmes' brother told John how the gang had been his idea, that he couldn't let him get closer than he already was to Sherlock... all in all, Mycroft was trying to protect his
"Now the case is personal, Sherlock..." Lestrade rubbed his temples and this time he fully looked up. "I believe the government might be involved in this one, so I cannot tell my people to track it down."
At first, he used to get a hard-on when listening to some of his companions making out in the field, moaning sweet nothings to each other or simply touching themselves. He was a boy back then. After a couple of months, he could sleep peacefully next to a bloke who had the tendency to wake up at four in the morning, pull all of his porn out and wank for hours.
Sherlock took the violin again, turned to the window, and resumed the gipsy melody he was playing before. After a couple of seconds trying to put some order in his mind, John finally asked: "Sherlock...the bloody hell was that about...?"
"Urgh!" Sherlock let out a loud groan and withdrew his hand from John. He was breathing a bit heavier than normal, looking at the floor, almost dramatically. Slowly, he lifted his gaze to John, who had his cheek red from friction.
Sherlock's texts, he read them over and over. They were a good distraction after all he had seen at the hospital today. He had to calm a mother whose daughter had died in the accident. They had lost a very old man in surgery, also caused by the accident, and he had been the one to inform the family. He had seen men die before, lots of them. But that didn't mean he was made of wood; a part of him still mourned, a part of him still wanted to cry with the families for their loss. A part of him wanted to shout at the injustice of the drunken imbecile who had survived and, just because he was careless and drank a few more glasses, had killed people.
By the time John gotten outside and caught up with them, Gerard had the detective in a headlock with a gun against Sherlock's temple.
"Yes, Well, this event was inevitable." Mycroft stated as he finished entering the small office and closed the door behind him. He chose to stay standing, rather than take a seat. So, the detective swaggered over to the front of his desk and leaned his weight back onto in, not quite sitting or standing. Ever the flirtatious rebel. Mycroft briefly imagined how Greg might look splayed out on top of that desk. He cleared his throat. Perhaps another time. "I am quite grateful, however, for the way you handled my little brother both at the crime scene and here at the Yard. With a firm yet understanding disposition."
He nodded solemnly at the receptionist who gave him a pitying look in return. Greg didn't like it, but he supposed he'd have to get used to seeing it on everyone's faces soon enough.
Dean looked to Sam in confusion before rushing over to help Cas to his feet. The angel could barely stand upright.
Dean flashed a fake smile that immediately fell. "No." He deadpanned. Then he waved a flat hand in front of him as he followed it up with, "Not even
“Cas.” Dean tried again, but he couldn’t seem to say anything more. Fortunately, there was enough emotion behind the way he said the name, that Cas seemed to understand the gist of what he was trying to convey. A smirk lifted at the corner of the angel’s mouth. “Dean.” He replied, and the hunter chuckled before returning the smile.
“Crowley.” Cas seethed before stumbling. Dean caught him and held onto him tighter. As he helped Cas into the backseat next to Kevin, the angel told him something that made his blood run cold. “Crowley, he…Dean, he has the angel tablet.”
This was impossible, Dean thought. And yet, here he was. His angel, solid and sturdy against him. Tasting of earth and lightning. So raw and so powerful. How could he possibly hold back any longer?
After a beat of awkward silence the older brother added, "Maybe you should, uh, take a break." He absentmindedly rubbed the back of his neck. "Ya know, get some fresh air?"
The receptionist sat there staring dumbfounded at the detective with her jaw slack. It caused his anger to surge. He hammered his fist down onto the desk top and she jumped about a foot in response. "...she...she doesn't work on Wednesdays, Mr. Lestrade." The woman finally stammered.
Mycroft directed his angry stare at John for a moment before he steeled his outward emotions. “John, how is it, living with my brother? Hellish, I imagine.”
“That makes two of us.” Cas assured. “I…I still have very little grasp on human social norms and all the details that accompany your rituals. Perhaps, we should stray from them, anyway. Our situation is extremely atypical. An angel engaged in a romantic relationship with a human is practically unheard of and is in fact frowned upon by heaven.”
"These people." The angel stated, leaning forward as Dean had done, and placing his elbows on his knees in the same gesture. "They're all my Father's creations. They're works of art."
Castiel raised the weapon slightly and nodded towards it. "No. Hephaestas is dead." He stated coldly.
"Because they are." Sherlock deadpanned. Mycroft shot him a murderous glare. His little brother just shrugged. "He was bound to find out eventually."
Realizing that he was standing stiffly under Dean's embrace, he forced himself to relax. He even snaked his arms around the hunter's waist and pulled him in closer. Dean sighed, and his tears began to slow.
Sam dropped the files he was holding onto the war room table and clutched his head just as Dean sat down.
"Not in my experience." The phrase was hard, but the tone was softer. It caused the angel to recede.
“I have a hard time getting away sometimes, with such a consistently massive workload. Seems like people are always killing each other and want me to work myself to death too.” Greg huffed but then his face lit up in a smile at the other man. “Speaking of people killing each other, how are you and Sherlock getting on?”
John spent his morning at the surgery, ran some errands in the afternoon, and then returned home to 221B Baker Street in the evening.
Castiel peered down at the ground and then turned his head to the side before looking back up at the Winchester. Then he sundered over, closer still to Dean. "I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be...overwhelming...to humans." He intoned. "So can my real voice, but you already knew that."
"London it is." Dean announced loudly. "At least they speak English there, even if it is old and weird."
"What are you on about Lestrade? I'm fine. Better than fine, actually. Now let me go." Sherlock growled.
”You knew what this was from the start, Gregory." The politician accused, his cold demeanor now settling in. "Don’t get agitated with me because I haven’t been swooned by your charms like you may have hoped. While I admit that I've enjoyed our time together, I am unable to become emotionally involved." He took another, more generous sip of his liquor. "That would be a risk of national security. My work is of the utmost importance, and therefore, will always come first before anything, or anyone, else.”
“I see,” Sherlock took a deep breath as if to say something else, but then noticed the time. Twenty-four minutes left, “Take the slides.” Sherlock’s voice was softer now, even if he knew the walls were soundproofed. “Take them all and place them at my left, behind me. Make sure you clean your hands when you place a new product in a new one, we can’t have them contaminated.”
Lestrade took his phone from his pocket and dialled a number. He could see Sherlock trying to tell John something about the laptops' passwords. Even in the state he was, the detective's mind was still working trying to solve any mystery presented. The DI smiled amused, shaking his head. It was the same with the case of the hiker and the boomerang; Sherlock had been talking about the case even drugged, and he was almost certain Sherlock had solved out the case whilst he was sleeping. Sherlock really was worthy of praise. Lestrade admired him... but that doesn't mean it was still hilarious to watch the detective behaving like this. He stopped his thoughts when he heard the feminine voice at the other side of the phone.
"Oh John..." Sherlock threw his head back again with a nearly dramatic sigh, his eyes closed in an evident state of relaxation, "... this brain massage is marvellous..."
"I can't see any concussion." John muttered, too conscious of Sherlock's state to listen to Lestrade, he examined the scalp under the curls carefully and noted that his forehead had a layer of sweat, but there was no injury.
!" Sherlock said cheerfully, passing his arm around John's shoulder slowly, "I told you, John. We're not going to be seen here, so no need to fake it or to be shy..." Sherlock brushed his nose against John's cheek and then watched intently at the cabbie at the other side of the window who observed the scene with a knowingly smile and added "Right? You know what I mean." Sherlock winked at the old man.
For some reason, he wanted to tell Sherlock that, Mycroft knew there was something between them, a friendship perhaps? A mutual understanding? Simple attraction? He was certain that it was not near as deep as with Dr. Watson but, knowing about his little brother had always been a mystery to him. Even though he claimed it wasn't. It was too easy to just check Sherlock's history of the last months, phone conversations, for example, but he knew there had to be something deeper there. Sherlock would never leave everything exposed to simple view.
… Mr Scott, is it?” She walked around the desk and placed her elbow next to Sherlock’s hand on the mouse. Her white blouse opened up a little at the gesture and Sherlock had to remind himself to look at her breasts’ area and to look distracted.
Lestrade sat at his desk, Donovan was leaning against the door of the DI's office, Sherlock talked and gestured dramatically as he paced around and John was leaning against a wall, arms crossed over his chest. It was a typical scene at Lestrade's office after a case was solved.
He eased the grip on the detective's shirt, hoping to get a reaction from him, but Sherlock was lost in thoughts. John smiled up at the ceiling and shook his head. He lifted his hand to the back of Sherlock's neck and, for the first time ever, John dared to bring him back from his palace. There was a little hesitation at first, but the pained expression on the detective's face convinced him it was a necessary thing to do.
"Well, that was before, last year... I was just beginning to understand you, Sherlock. I wanted to know what you knew..." John smiled, "You know... I even made a list of the fields you have knowledge in."
Sherlock's lips were parted to take in more air, his skin was pale; even though he should be flushed for the little wrestle. Louis felt fear, not for the man in front, but the situation; Sherlock's strong expression was distorted, just for a few seconds, by fear. Like the proud vampire being hunted, he knows he is more powerful than humans, but still feels fear for he doesn't know the weapons that might be used to attack right to his few weaknesses.
Sherlock reached to lower the hem of the jean but in doing so, he lost his balance a bit and tried to support himself with his calves against the back of John’s knees. John's legs were about to give up, so he braced himself on the edge of the stretcher with his slippery hand which caused him to fall completely over Sherlock. When Sherlock tried to get them upright, they lost their balance again.
made its way inside his skull somehow, but he discarded it quickly. The problem was, as soon as he hardly got rid of that thought, he heard the first word Sherlock's lips pronounced once he was awake. And the problem? Yes; he was delighted by it:
"I said: could you please find me a book. Since you took so long I just had to come here and search for it." He eyed the mess he had over John's bed. "I am going to put everything back in place, don't worry." He said with a little smile, he looked at John quickly and his gaze came back to the book in his hands.
, actually. It was almost unbelievable, but at the same time it seemed almost logical, the only possible way out. The romanticism, longing and holding with previous partners didn't exist between him and Sherlock. What did he expect? A kiss? Taking it slow? Was it even possible with a man craving for data like Sherlock? Possibly, yes. John shook his head. The course of events and the precedents said otherwise. They met the first day and they agreed sharing a flat, second day he killed a man for Sherlock's safety. Third day it was almost as if they knew each other all of their lives.
For a moment, John thought about going to sleep in his bed, but soon he decided against it. He was used to sleep anywhere and still manage a good night's sleep... he wanted to be near Sherlock, even if it was just for sharing the space like two kids, like this. Sherlock was right, it
Sherlock's shoulders were shaking due to a controlled laughter. A light deep chuckle could be heard in the flat. There was no response on his phone anymore, so John maybe had finally succumbed to sleep. He started to play with the device in his hand: it fled in the air, gave a few laps and then came down to his waiting hand. He repeated the process uncountable times.
Nodding and squaring his shoulders to give self assurance, he walked to Sherlock's room. On his way, he took Mrs. Hudson's lotion and passed through the open door.
The doctor toyed with his glass of beer; moving it from one hand to the other, clearly uncomfortable. Sherlock was expressionless still. His eyes scanned everywhere but he was not really paying attention to anything. For the first time, it was an awkward silence.
Two men of Louis' gang came quickly to each side of the attacker, taking his hands, pinning him against the wall harder, one of them even knocked him out against the wall, leaving him almost unconscious and groaning in pain.
"You said fuck, John... see? Fuck is sex." Sherlock said, trying to grab something from his nightstand. He passed his hand there, finding only his lamp, it almost went to the floor if it wasn't for John's quick hand. "But fuck is a verb... I can say fuck me, I can say sex me, now can I... Ah! And fuck is an insult. I can say fuck you, but I can't say sex you... and I can say..."
He left the violin on his chair and fled to his room, closed the door as silent as he could and stripped himself, sighing in relief when his penis was no longer trapped in his clothes.
He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to will the excess of energy away, but when that didn’t work, he walked over to cut and fry some bread, only to realise he had already made croutons for Rosie’s broth earlier. He groaned out loud, exasperated.
"Okay." Armand made his way to the door. His walking pace was secure and his movements smooth. He moved a bit like Sherlock, but not as gracious, as John noticed. "And... Dr. Watson?"
John's eyes clenched tightly as he pulled out. Sherlock sighed heavily, his cheeks ballooning a bit as he did.
She looked around with a frown, breathing fast, her eyes frantically searching Sherlock’s frame. “Who? You’re not one of her staff, then?”
, you can go back. I’ll finish here and you can wait for me with the Yarder at the door. I’ll let you do anything you want to me, then.” He shut his mouth abruptly, not trusting himself any longer.
John snorted and Sherlock couldn’t stop looking at him, even if the position of his neck was a bit odd. It was easy, talking about this with John, even if he was not asking what Sherlock wanted to be asked about. He thought about the years they knew each other and was secretly thankful for the deep understanding they already had of one another.
"Sherlock?" there was no answer in the flat but the lights from his own room sneaked down the stairs.
"What is this code... the number doesn't make much sense." Sherlock stared at the card for a moment and sighed. John lifted himself from his chair giving a tired groan in the process.
Mycroft hung up and sighed once again today. "Armand took Xavier to the police station to present his proofs." He said absently rubbing his temples and closing his eyes. The phone was still in his hand.
Armand tried to calm down. The man in front seemed almighty. He was at lost, his knees were still trembling but his position was firm.
Sherlock laughed genuinely at this. He had asked John to erase those photographs from the blog, but the blogger had insisted:
After a while, he had the dummy hanging from the ceiling and he was back at the microscope. He knew the next case, and he also had an idea of what was going on with John. They needed to get used to this new relationship and, for that, John needed a bit of assurance. It wasn't just about the physical pleasure, about the chemistry between them, it was deeper. And John needed to know something Sherlock couldn't confess, not yet.
"Mycroft. Seems fitting. An unusual name for an unusual gent...with an unusual brother." Greg smiled widely.
“He said…” Dean took a moment to remember. “They didn’t survive on their character alone and that they all had a weak spot."
Dean watched in horror as their hands were forcefully pulled from one another by the force of the portal, and in an instant, he was gone.
“Flattered?” Sherlock lashed out, dropping the magazine to his midsection and looking pointedly at John. “Sherlock sees through everyone and everything in seconds. What’s incredible though is how spectacularly ignorant he is about some things.” Sherlock quoted before rolling his eyes.
“It’s your choice. I mean, that’s what this has all been about. The choices your kind make.” Metatron explained. He grabbed a legal pad and pen from the kitchen counter and began to scribble something down as he spoke. “But you’re gonna have to weigh that choice. Ask yourself, what is it going to take to do this? And what will the world be like after it’s done?”
Dean and Bobby were immediately up and ready, on high alert. "Wishful thinking, but maybe it's just the wind." The younger man voiced as the noise continued. Bobby just shrugged his shoulders in response.
Sherlock locked eyes with a man dressed in all black at the corner of the club. John knew instantly that this was the guy they were after.
Greg released a harsh dry laugh. They were obviously making fun of him. "Yeah, alright. 'Let's make fun of the dim witted cop.' See how stupid he really is. Hilarious."
Sam searches for a demon cure while Dean and Cas search for two of the three heroes spell ingredients.
"Being passed out in a drug den is already dangerous enough without the added danger of the vampire uprise we're currently fighting. Do you not value your life? Do you wish it drained away by fangs ripped into the flesh of your throat?"
“Did Metatron tell you how you’re supposed to ‘cure a demon’? I didn’t realize that was even possible.”
The last vampire unhinged from the detective and yelled with rage. Then she retaliated by grabbing Sherlock’s throat and squeezing. “No!!!” John shouted.
John was immediately alert and at attention. It made Sherlock smirk, because he knew that John could take him down with a single blow.
Cas raised his eyebrows and drew his lips tight as he read the list of ingredients. “The spell itself isn’t too complicated. However, some of the ingredients may be a bit hard to procure. Particularly: A weapon forged in hell fire, the skull of a dragon, and a vial of blood that’s descended from an extraterrestrial being.”
“Yeah?” The detective questioned as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He knew full well what Sherlock used those for.
How was Cas such an oxymoron? And how was Dean supposed to build (let alone keep) walls up around him, when he contradicted everything he thought angels were? Maybe Cas wasn't a total dick, like the rest of his command. Maybe.
The man in question sent a few guys from his group after them, and then he made his way to escape into a back alleyway.
“Metatron. You found Metatron? I was under the impression that he died a long time ago.” Cas informed.
They stood in thoughtful silence for a few moments before Dean asked, "What now? Can you take a trip to hell and make a...I don't know, knife, or sword, or something?"
Her eyes were wide and they kept darting to the phone on her desk. Greg took a steadying breath and ran a hand through his hair, trying to reign his rage into a deadly calm. "No. She always works on Wednesdays." He countered, his voice rough. The receptionist stared at Greg and slowly shook her head. "She hasn't worked a Wednesday in months, Greg. I'm sorry."
A horrific scream filled the small room. When the politician receded from the attack, his weapon dripped thick deep red blood onto the floor.
Maybe he was crazy for confronting his wife at her work place, but it wasn't like she was gonna be home anytime soon.
The bliss of kissing John was very much short lived as a bar patron nearby exploded in rage and disgust at the display.
"Your a wise man, Gregory. A solid head upon your shoulders, indeed." Mycroft praised. The D.I. blushed adorably. He dipped his head and peered up at Mycroft through his lashes. The Holmes brother would never admit to the fluttering he felt in his both his stomach and his heart at that gesture.
"Luck has nothing to do with it, Gerald. I specifically measured the dosage of each component." The taller man snipped.
Greg looked deeply into Mycroft's eyes for some time, searching for something. Seemingly having found what he was looking for, he nodded. "Yeah. Alright."
The detective was aware of an intense pain in his head, the feeling of warm sticky blood running down his face, a burning in his lungs.
“For Sam.” Cas stated. “Here.” He ordered, reaching his hand out to retrieve the note. Sam handed it over. On the top it read: The Trials of God require either a sacrifice or a hero. It’s your choice. Underneath that was a list of ingredients and instructions for the spell. “If a mortal were to complete the trials, it would kill them…” The angel began.
A week later, Greg had filed for a separation. He just couldn't bring himself to file for a divorce. Sure, his wife had drug him through the mud, but Greg wasn't exactly innocent himself. So after a serious discussion with her about taking time away to mend what was broken, he moved into a small flat closer to the Yard.
For a moment, Sidney got free and tried to hit Martin’s head with her fist but Sherlock quickly grabbed both of her hands at the same time Martin handcuffed the old man who didn’t resist to the arrest.
“I never thought you’d actually sign up for the full-body massage,” John stated as soon as Sherlock was inside the white room. He was putting on his white coat and holding a white towel. “Take off your clothes behind that screen,” he continued loudly as he passed Sherlock the towel, he meant to be heard from the hallway, “You can keep your pants on if you’d rather. Put this towel around your middle and lay on the stretcher, face down, I’m going to grab the oils. I’ll be back in a tick.”
John opened his eyes, realising he was acting much like Sherlock now. His mind was in overdrive and again he wondered if Sherlock always felt this way, the data was flowing from his every pore and he needed something, anything.
John laughed softly, then placed both of his hands on each of Sherlock’s calves. He moved them up to the back of his knee, kneading the flesh on the way. He repeated the notion four times, each of them pressing into different spots and each time going a bit up to Sherlock’s thighs.
"...so, after all the facts I told you before, if you take Armand's number you can say the department and the options he belongs to; every two numbers a different option on the phone, zero stands for false..."
us to come in a cab. Don't try to hide it, I saw you saving the key in your pocket and it was clearly from a car leasing company. And you have sugar on your shoe, you never eat inside a car, so I assume a previous user."
“I want you to show them to me.” The words were out before John could control them. He saw how Sherlock’s eyes immediately focused on him – really
"That explains the drug's dealing rumours around here..." Sherlock eyed the canal in front and then he popped his head to see outside the barriers of the alley walls. He saw the abandoned factory and the possible route they had to take to get there. "But for now that information is irrelevant. I'm saving it for later use."
"I bought cheese snacks." John sipped from his cup after he spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.
He had spent his day in peace. Sarah talked to him as soon as he got there; they both apologized for their behaviour yesterday. Sarah was predictable. A word he had learned to hate with Sherlock. Maybe he would have liked it before, but John Watson was a man of adventure, he loved the adrenaline that came with the unknown. He liked to be thrilled, he loved to come home and not knowing what was going to happen today... and that was Sherlock. Last night he had predicted part of his own feelings but not Sherlock's. He never imagined the man was going to act like that, he never thought Sherlock would ask to be touched –
"Nnno." Sherlock's eyes went down again and continued his scrutiny to one of the books on his lap. A frown formed quickly on his features as he was absorbed by it once more.
He also remembered that was the first time he had an erotic dream concerning John. He knew all along John knew about the dream and had tried to be oblivious about it. It was almost impossible John hadn't notice, he was getting better at observing after all.
“I should have known…” Sidney said as she got closer to Sherlock, still on his knees, the strong man behind him keeping him down. “Private Detective Sherlock Holmes, I’ve heard your name but never saw your face... you got me completely fooled.”
"I live with him." Both gazed locked. The coffee and the tea arrived but none of them seemed to mind.
"Now now, excellent." James Moriarty took off his headphones, he unplugged them from the computer and connected them to a little wireless device as he dialled a number. "Phillip, you know what to do, Johnny boy is sleeping, Sherlock is out, you know where is he heading to?"
"John, I need you to tell me everything Mycroft told you two days ago." At that, John frowned and tried to remember.
He sat next to Sherlock on the bed, eyed the ceiling and gave a sigh, his parted lips smiling in disbelief at the current situation.
John had to use all of his mind power to prevent from chocking on his food and die right there... if he wasn't dying of chocking, he would surely do due a heart attack.
When he peered up again, Sherlock was looking right through him; his eyes were focused on John but not really seeing him. His expression was lost. John had seen this before and he had always assumed the man just got lost in his head; sometimes when Sherlock finished playing the violin, or when Mrs Hudson teased him about sentiment, or when Rosie was talking to John. But the only thing John could remember clearly was, ages ago, when he had said in this same living room, “
"Black, two sugars, please... sir." With a smile, Armand opened the door, the man entered and the door was closed behind him.
"Alright." Sherlock complied. He placed the cup on the coffee table and unwrapped himself from the sheet. He sat completely naked on the couch. Remembering last night, he quickly eyed the door making sure it was locked. If this worked, he didn't want Mrs. Hudson walk on him and have a heart attack.
"I believe you, John. So what's the point? You already made me watch those little... creepy clips- You were really fond of those last year... remember the cat you made me watch twelve times?" Sherlock asked with a snort.
But, for being such an unpredictable man, he could also tell what Sherlock liked or hated. And he was very aware that the relationship he – now, maybe always – had with Sherlock wasn't a normal one. He could clearly see himself living, perhaps forever, with him... but holding hands whilst walking in the park... was something certainly not destined to happen. Going home and receive a warm kiss and a hug welcoming him wasn't happening either. Taking off early in the morning, with Sherlock in an apron making waffles and wishing him good luck, wasn't happening either. The sole image of that could make John
"No. I was far away, so I had enough time to press my sleeve over my nose as soon as I heard Molly's laughter."
"Yeah. The alley's stuff." John never lifted his eyes off his food, moving it with his fork. He heard Sherlock clearing his throat. Obviously, it was the first time for Sherlock being in this situation:
Sherlock scanned impatiently John's face. John held a very apathetic demeanour, seemingly he didn't want to talk, his lips were still placed at the border of the glass. The detective rushed himself to ask "Well?"
He focused his eyes on a couple a few meters ahead of him; she was carrying a medium sized pink bag and there was a white little dog in her hand bag which looked more like a living stuffed animal. The man next to her was young; he had a camera hanging around his neck and a bag on his back. He was holding a couple of papers in one hand. Journalists. They're having an affair. She's married and he's far younger than her. He deduced by the way he placed a hand on the small of her back as he guided her to walk in front of him.
John massaged his temples and sighed. The cheerful nature of the young man in front seemed completely gone as he spoke of the market and the girls. He was like a totally different person now; his intense gaze directed to the doctor didn't fade, but his voice had lowered quite a bit, and there was a light tremor in it.
Last night had been the only night he hadn't dreamt about the fall, but he dreamed of Sherlock anyway. He dreamed about the deductions and the things the detective's eyes observed. In the dream, Sherlock was drugged, laughing at him from above and Greg Lestrade was filming them. Sherlock had hugged him, screamed to Greg, and then he had whispered in his ear
, the tone was rude and loud, almost a scream, frustrated. The detective took a big gulp of air and blinked slowly, "I need to speak with the man who visited you this morning." He added, returning his voice to his dangerous lower tone and pointing his index finger to the floor.
, but enough to notice the movement of Sherlock’s hips. He moved his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and neck, rubbing his fingers behind Sherlock’s ears and following the path back to his shoulders and then to his arms.
John was wearing his bathrobe and he was moving a towel over his short hair, he lifted an eyebrow at Sherlock's lower half "Good morning" he tried not to pay attention to that.
"What did he tell to you?" Sherlock asked with a frown, lightly tilting his head to his left, to John.
When John thrusted again he had to bite his lower lip not to groan so he could just hear Sherlock. The sound coming from his lips was amazing on a whole new level, John had to clench his eyes not to come just from hearing that. He did it again and was rewarded with another sound, Sherlock's hand moved to John's buttocks, demanding speed and soon John noticed that Sherlock needed more pressure on his cock trapped between them, but he couldn’t do anything but press, utterly concentrated on just not to come, concentrated on hearing, observing.
So here he was now, trapped by his own words. Yes, sexual arousal could be controlled. He took a deep breath and looked down at John again. He stood up and took off his trousers and freed his arousal from his pants as well.
The actual voice of the man in front of him brought him back from his thoughts. He noticed how his face had changed his usual cold mask to a worried expression; he returned his features to his usual semi frown slowly. Phillip wore a little smile, his eyes scrutinizing his face, his phone still over his ear and his elbow up in the air, body language said he was in a hurry; he wanted to hang up soon. The older Holmes frowned and returned the little smile.
in understanding, impressed because he never imagined Sherlock was observing him. Sherlock smirked, put another envelope in Martin’s hands and continued, “Now about the cameras. The cameras were the key, thanks to Wilson’s nephew; I did a quick research on PIEDRA and I have the components used in the formula
"He isn't very clever after all... nobody sent him to check on your sister's doing! Now, talk to Sebastian, let him know what we agreed and you're out."
"Oh, Irene Adler. She's uhm..." John cleared his throat and hissed, "She is in America... in a witness' protection program." As long as he finished saying that, he took a big gulp of tea, eyeing, once again, in the direction of Sherlock's bedroom. Mrs. Hudson just nodded.
“Thank you.” John was already in the kitchen reheating the food and closing the windows. “Oh, I’m starving. How was your day?”
And there was the other part; the routine. He didn't feel obligated to do things with Sherlock, he didn't feel obligated to cuddle, to kiss him, to hold him... it was almost like a silent pact, they would do all that, but when they wanted to, not obliged by some sort of social accepted rule.
“I was just using my resources,” Sherlock said. He was so pleased with John’s remark he felt the need to cough or scream. He wanted to squeeze something with his hands. He was nearly mortified when he felt his heartbeat going faster as John’s eyes were still following his every move.
Once outside and out of ear range, John started to chuckle, soon he and Sherlock were laughing so hard that John had to support himself on a wall. "Oh God..." he gasped.
The battle that was forming inside Sherlock's mind was alarming. It was the first time he allowed his mind palace to fall into chaos... it was the first time he authorized his body to posses his mind. He didn't like it at first, but soon he found himself enjoying the feeling like a drug; it was nearly as addictive as nicotine. Endorphins, hormones. He had said once that love made a very simple chemical reaction – actually, love
Sherlock frowned. He never thought Mycroft would remember that; great minds playing the game of deduction of one another, hiding and showing. He liked the challenge.
After the conversation last night with John, he had been… tempted. To use a needle. He had wanted to stop feeling the hollow in the middle of his chest. He’d wanted the caress of something warm inside his veins, he wanted the tender sensation of his blood cells singing with something stronger. Of
Sherlock hung up and placed the phone back into John's pocket. His head felt heavy and his stomach grumbled. He moved the blanket from his shoulders and threw it over both of them, feeling how cold John's hand was against his scalp. John moved unconsciously, placing his left hand over his own chest and finding Sherlock's hand in the process. The detective, feeling how cold it was, placed his hand over it, his headache making him go faster than usual into a slumber state.
"Of course." Was the immediate answer. "Though, it's highly unlikely that the Men of Letters would possess such an weapon. Even with their knack for procuring rare supernatural items."
Mycroft didn't bother trying to conceal the frustrated groan that emanated from him upon this revelation. "He chased them off, then." He supplied, from simple deductions of his little brother's boringly predictable habits. Mycroft ran a hand over his facial features before posing a follow-up question. "Did he manage to capture or kill any of them at least?"
They stalked through the corridor of the condemned house, stopping at the entryway to the next room. John peered inside to scope out the number of vamps inside. He held up four fingers to Sherlock. Two each. He didn’t like those numbers. Not when they weren’t supposed to resolve to killing them.
"Oh, Gregory." Holmes despaired. Greg's eyes shot up to hold his gaze at the sound of his name on Mycroft's lips. "My brother has a brilliant mind, as you've witnessed, but unfortunately he does not handle 'feelings' or 'emotions' very well. I'm sure you'll come to learn this."
In an instant, the old metal shingles on the roof of the barn started clanging and knocking heavily.
"Cas wanted me to stay behind to find the dragon skull." Dean pulled a folded piece of paper out of his pocket and waved it at Sam. "He gave me an incantation for a location spell before he left though."
Mycroft was standing with one foot crossed over the other ankle, leaning into his umbrella for balance. A bright overhead light lit him nicely from above in the abandoned warehouse. It was all quite theatric, which Mycroft throughly enjoyed. A genuinely pleased smile presented itself before he opened his mouth to speak.
“Ah, fuck.” He cursed before turning to lay the machete on the table with a clank. “Shirt’s ruined. Ah well, I’m sure the rest of my clothes will be too before we’re done. We have seven more vampires to interrogate.”
Mycroft now stood impossibly close. Greg could feel his heart racing like a wild stallion. He licked his lips and shamelessly parted his legs to invite Mycroft even closer yet. To his surprise, the other man took it. Mycroft stood flush with the desk, lightly pressed into the other man and he placed his hands on either side of him. Greg almost forgot to breathe. Just a minuscule shift forward would have their lips connected.
"Worth a shot." Dean shrugged. "Now if Cas would get his feathery ass back here, we could be on our way."
By the time they pulled back from each other, they were both a bit breathless. Lips swollen and tingling.
Fire pulsed through Greg's veins as Mycroft's hands gripped his hips firmly. His tongue traced and his teeth scrapped at the skin where neck met shoulder. Greg closed his eyes, sighed, and tilted his head to allow Mycroft better access.
He slid his hands up the exposed flesh from hips, to stomach, to chest. Then leaned in to nibble on Sherlock's ear while his fingertips ghosted over the detective's sensitive nipples.
"Hey, so uh, none of the weapons we have in the bunker are what we need for the heroes spell." Dean informed him as he approached the table.
"Ugh, fine." Dean complained. "I'll do some research to see if I can find something that will help."
"You used him for your own pleasure and then pushed him away. Now he doesn't want to call me in because of you! I get bored Mycroft!"
"I had asked you if you trusted me, because I had deduced that a kiss between us, two gentlemen, would provide the perfect distraction to get to the killer. I saw an opportunity that night, and I took it. Also, bravo on your part, you really sold it...why are you looking at me like that?"
Greg sat up slowly. “Wow, I must’ve been pretty tired. Hope you still slept okay. Breakfast?” He stood up and quietly padded over to the kitchen.
The second time around a world map was used and six small patches were left unburned. Sam grabbed a notebook and jotted down the locations. London, Egypt, Kabul, Osaka, Xi'an, and Papua New Guinea. "Only six dragon skulls in the entire world." He whispered in amazement to himself.
“Did you like it?” John probed, dropping his hand from his chin to his lap. He gazed intently at the other man's face, trying to gage his reaction.
“What? I mean it. You help him stay grounded and in touch with reality. I was starting to worry that he may never get off that high horse of his. It’s not easy dealing with a high and mighty Holmes.”
Sam stopped approaching the angel but continued to berate him. “All the time you’ve been hiding here, how much suffering have you read over?
The innuendo was lost on the detective. That is, until John dipped his head down to kiss along Sherlock's jaw and then ever so gently on his still tender throat.
John was halfway through the entertainment pages when Sherlock emerged from his room, looking very well put together, as always.
"You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking?" The angel nodded. "Buddy, next time, lower the volume."
"ON THE GROUND! NOW!" The mad man demanded, the arm around Sherlock squeezing tighter with every word.
Standing in the cold silence, his heart continued to sink as thoughts of what-if plagued his mind. It wasn't fair to blame himself. Even Dean knew that. He did everything in his power to get Cas out. That's what hurt the most, though. That he did everything in his power, and yet he still failed to save him.
Cas smiled sadly as Dean pulled away. “I knew you were going to kiss me.” He revealed in a deep somber tone.
"Come on, John. Let's go catch a killer." With that, Sherlock was off in a flash. John at his heels.
"I won't deny it, but my previous statement is true. There are things that you are unaware of out there, Gregory. Things that, if exposed, could destroy our entire world. I'm simply asking that you play a part in not allowing that to happen."
“Eight vamps and not one of them knew why their Alpha sent them here.” Greg recapped as he aggressively wiped the blood off of his latest blade. The last vampire sat headless in the steel chair. Mycroft eyed the D.I. as he rolled his tense shoulders.
This revelation startled Dean a bit. He leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees. "Your orders were to follow my orders?" The hunter reiterated.
"Yeah, I'm doing alright. Thanks for asking." He snipped as he regathered all the stray papers. "Long enough." He answered before standing and all but throwing the folder into Sherlock's hands. "Why in the bloody hell are you two in here discussing vampires and monsters like they're real?"
Dean became dumbstruck with awe for a split second, but that instantly melted into rage. "Some angel you are." He spat viciously. "You burned out that poor woman's eyes."
The angel didn’t sleep, but that was alright with him. He would lay and rest while watching over his…boyfriend? Yeah. His Boyfriend.
Greg stood next to the desk in Mycroft's study, his coat and suit jacket tossed over an armchair. He stared inquisitively at the amber liquid in his glass before setting it down gently.  "I shouldn't be here, Myc." The words sounded like a thought voiced, more than an actual protest.
The angel squinted his eyes and tilted his head as he tried to read the reasoning behind Dean's response on his face. He wasn't very good at reading people, However. Human emotions and feelings were still so complicated to him. He found his gaze settling onto the hunter's lips, and he subconsciously licked his own.
Cas drew in a long breath and glanced back at the playground. "Our orders-" The angel began. "-Yeah, I've had about enough of these orders of yours-." Dean interrupted, but Cas cut back in. "Our orders," He said louder this time, "Were not to stop the summoning of Sam Hane. They were to do whatever you told us to do."
Dean inhaled slowly as Cas continued, "But, in the coming months you will have more decisions to make. I...don't envy the weight that's on your shoulders, Dean." The pity in Cas' eyes churned Dean's insides. "I truly don't."
“You know, I asked him the other day what was in one particular specimen jar, because it gave off a certain glow, and he told me that it was
"It's pronounced 'Hih-feast-us." Sam corrected and Dean rolled his eyes at him. "The blacksmith of the gods. That's very smart. He could forge the weapon we need."
"Yeah, well they weren't happy when Harry came out, I was supposed to be the perfect son. Of course going into the Army didn't exactly make them happy, but we still spoke occasionally. After hearing what they had to say about Sherlock, well I'm happy to never speak with them again. I still have Harry, she rings me once a week to chat, make sure that I'm ok. She doesn't know about any of this though."
"I know. I really can't wait to go back. Most of the stuff from the house is packed up in the moving van, the furniture is staying so just my clothes, the twins stuff and a few bits and pieces. With all that gone I'm hoping that Sherlock won't guess too much before I tell him."
Greg stood at the window of Sherlock's hospital room, sipping on the fresh coffee that one of Mycrofts men had brought him. He glanced over at Sherlock, lying still in the hospital bed, the heart monitor beeping steadily. It was...wrong. Sherlock should never be as still as he was, he was always energetic, running around deducing crime scenes, running after suspects.
"I don't know for how long, although I suspect not long before he moved. I don't know if you read his last blog, but I think he definitely knew something."
Sherlock chuckled, before gasping out in pain. The pain in his chest that he had been ignoring was making itself known. Sherlock watched as John let go of his hand to press the call button. Seconds later a nurse appeared, giving John a gentle smile  before starting to question Sherlock.
Then there were the people around Sherlock, they crowded around him, stopped John from getting too close, and then he was gone, on a stretcher. It was quick. Too quick.
'She's actually on her way here now. Once she's here we get to drop the curtain so to speak. We've arranged for her to go to a different room, nowhere near Sherlock, I won't have her anywhere near him again. I'm going down there too, I...I need to finish this, which is why I asked Mycroft to call you here. I need you to stay with him whilst I'm gone, I didn't want to leave him alone.'
"Moran was the reason I left Baker Street. I recognised him in the crime scene photos in Sherlock's file. I knew that he'd be after me, so I made the decision to leave."
'I'm glad he's alive John. Wouldn't want our baby to be without their uncle Sherlock.' She said comfortingly, giving him a loving smile. John gave an unconscious grimace while outwardly giving her a lovesick grin.
"Very good friends, and you did start the movement. It was the last thing you wrote on your blog, a lot of people were very moved by that, it touched the hearts of so many. It was that blog which started everything, started to make people realise that maybe not everything they read in the paper is true. You did a good thing John."
“I don’t know.” The vamp answered. Mycroft grabbed his arm and yanked it forward, splaying his hand across the tabletop.
Greg's head tipped back and he swallowed down a moan. "If I can't stay faithful to her, then I won't be able to be faithful to you either." Greg panted. Mycroft dropped his hand and lifted an eyebrow at him. "I don't require you to be faithful, Gregory. We aren't in a relationship."
Castiel furrowed his brows slightly, and tilted his head to the side. "I told you." He declared firmly.
Ah. Yes. He had come straight from the drug den, clad in sweats and a hoodie. A far cry from his usual attire of dress wear topped with his Belstaff.
Lestrade simply nodded. That was enough information for now. They needed to get Sherlock to the hospital right away.
Greg wondered exactly how he knew what had transpired, and to what depth. CCTV and Witnesses, he figured (rather accurately). Eyes and ears everywhere.
Shit. Outnumbered. Not by much, but when the enemy had supernatural strength and agility, it up’ed the chances for injury.
It intrigued Dean, so he shrugged slightly and tried to keep the inflection out of his voice when he replied,  "Okay."
The smug bastard, thought Greg as Mycroft retreated cooly back to the office door. What a tease. "Perhaps you'll be hearing from me again rather soon, Detective Lestrade."
A cabbie dropped Greg off at Sherlock's apartment building. He walked inside and up three flights of stairs to the door that read 307. He prepared to knock, but he caught two voices from behind the wooden barrier. Sherlock and Mycroft.
Mycroft sighed. (He was doing that a lot today too.) The lanky man then raised his left hand above his head, signaling his assistant. "Gregory, please." He practically whispered. "The sake of the world aside, I know you're fond of Sherlock and I suspect that you would like to see him reach his full potential as well."
‘I never thought we'd get here Sherlock. There was always something stopping us. I...I want this, I want us. I’ve never wanted something so much in all my life.’ Sherlock smiled at him, his mask fully down, showing John everything he had hidden from him.
The one thing that Sherlock couldn’t have predicted, the one thing that he would never have even expected Moriarty to do. If Moriarty was still alive then the attacks could still be called off, Sherlock would know this, but dead. There had been a choice he’d had to make, the life of his friends and husband or his life. Moriarty had killed himself, knowing that Sherlock wouldn’t make any other choice than the one he did. He killed himself knowing he had won.
'I deserve a bloody medal for dealing with the two of you, but life's certainly not boring with you guys around.'
"I will solve your murder, but it takes John Watson to save your life. " Sherlock Holmes The Sign of Three
‘Because he didn’t want you to see him hit the ground’ his mind supplied. John shook his head, it could be, but that wasn’t it.
"How is it possible that you were an MI6 agent? I have looked over the files repeatedly. It's not in your dossier and there are no records anywhere of your involvement." John chuckled darkly.
His shoulder tingled in remembrance. If he was in London, if he found out about Sherlock, he wouldn’t hesitate, and John would not allow that. He needed help, but not Mycroft. He couldn’t know about this, about any of this. He couldn’t do this on his own though.  A plan began to formulate in his mind and the next moment he strode back to their bedroom, not even realising that he no longer needed his cane. He grabbed his phone, unlocking it and scrolling down the contact list, finding the number and pressing the dial button. He heard the phone ring and then a deep and familiar voice answered.
'So that's it your just going to let big brother lock me up. I'm pregnant with your child, does that even mean anything to you?'
He made to get out of his chair and the file on his lap slid onto the floor, the photos falling face up. He bent down to pick them up and froze. His heart stopped cold.
So this is my first posting on here and its a Sherlock fic. I really love this series and the characters are really amazing to work with.
It had been so long since he'd seen his husband, he looked thinner, obviously not eating right. He ran his eyes over his husbands form, taking in the same high cheekbones, bow shaped lips, same Belstaff coat with the collar up just the way he liked it. His Sherlock, his consulting detective. He felt himself drinking in the sight that he had been deprived of for so long. He re-familiarised himself with his husband.
'You shot Sherlock, how...how could you do that? After knowing what I was like when he died last time, how could you think to put me through it again?' He demanded.
Sherlock's mouth broke from John's, moving his lips down to his neck as his hands massaged the cheeks of John's arse. John groaned, tightening the hold that his hands had in Sherlock's hair.
Already starting to feel the morphine work, Sherlock reached out to grab John's hand again, entwining their fingers together. John looked down at their entwined hands and smiled before looking back up at Sherlock fondly. With his other hand he brushed and errant curl from Sherlock's face, and then cupped Sherlock's face with his hand, his thumb brushing over his cheekbone.
Sherlock moaned at Johns words, and quickly removed his fingers, causing John to feel empty. Sherlock quickly squeezed out some more lube and slicked his cock up, before positioning himself before John's entrance. He slowly pushed in, both of them groaning at the feeling. John's muscles pulled him in further, until finally Sherlock was fully sheaved in John. Their foreheads met and hands grasped. They started to move against each other, losing themselves in the rhythm of their lovemaking. John reached up and pulled Sherlock in for a crushing kiss, tongues plundering each other's mouths as their coupling became more frantic.
'Didn't do too good of a job with that did you. He's obviously been back on drugs again, not to mention the fact that he was shot last night whilst you were just down the hall. It must get tiring of being such a failure mustn't it. A failed soldier, a crappy friend and a shit husband. I should have realised sooner, it was never me you loved, it's always been him. And look what you did. By trying to protect him, you hurt him the most.' Her eyes lit up in delight at the confused look on John's face. She laughed. 'Oh you didn't know, oh John. You always miss the bigger picture. You ruined any chance you had with Sherlock when you married me, you know he left the reception early to go get high. You must know that he doesn't do feelings, he can't because Sherlock Holmes is a broken man, and you just keep on breaking him. He'll never want you John.' She spat, a crazy look in her eyes.
‘We were always heading towards this John, we would have got there eventually. I want this too, I want you back at Baker Street, solving crimes with me, making tea. I want us to be who we are together.’ John nodded in agreement. It was all he wanted. He slowly leant his head down to do something he had wanted for what seemed like forever. He closed his eyes and gently pressed their lips together, in a brief soft kiss. He pulled back a bit to see Sherlock  with his eyes closed, a look of pure bliss on his face. He felt Sherlock's other hand on the back of his head pull his down for another kiss, this time longer but no less gentle.
"I will admit to not knowing how he will react. He'll be shocked for certain, but they are a part of you John, how could he not love them. Things will work out John, I promise."
"You know, I've dreamt of this moment for the entire two years I was away," Sherlock said, breaking the comfortable silence that had enveloped them. "It was, at times the only thing that made me carry on. I thought that all the pain would be worth it if you were safe, that I had you to come back to."
"I should have known you would have figured it out. When you do that it really reminds me of him, though you usually have a more tactful way of telling people." Greg sighed and smiled. "Well we've been together over a year, I wanted to ask before but I want Sherlock back first. I know that he's been worrying about him so wanted to wait until a more stable time." John nodded, before looking around the room. Most of his belongings had already been packed up and placed in the moving van, there were just a few bits and pieces and the bedrooms to sort out. He looked at the baby monitor next to his chair, listening for any disturbances. Seemed the kids were still asleep. Hopefully they would sleep until Molly came and picked them up.
"Yeah I was about two years in the army when they approached me. How could I turn down an offer like that? So I accepted and went into the training programme. Met a few good guys there, James being one of them. When the position came up me, James and another candidate where chosen for a mission to retrieve information, an UC agent had already been captured. However when we got there it turned into a FUBAR situation. The UC had been badly injured and as a Doctor I couldn't leave him to die. I told the others to carry on and complete the mission. Luckily the mission was a success and the UC lived, although he never fully recovered from his injury. I think it's called dereliction of duty, but because I saved the life of the UC agent they released me back to the army, wiped all my records. It was like I was never there. James of course felt that it was unjustified, but I was happy, and he got the 00 position, told me if I ever needed help, all I had to do was ring."
'I found him. I popped in to check on him, and christ...I thought he was dead. He overdosed Sherlock. He bloody overdosed. I thought nothing could have been worse than when I found you that one time, but this. Christ Sherlock, this was far worse. He was in your bedroom, on your bed, wrapped up in your dressing gown. He just gave up. He lost everything when you jumped and he just...couldn't handle it anymore, because he missed you so much. Because he loved you, and he blamed himself for not stopping you. We managed to get him to hospital on time and he recovered. He moved out after that, it wasn't good for him to be there alone anymore  and he begged me and Mycroft not to say anything to anyone about it. We agreed as long as he started to see Ella again, which he did. It helped a bit.'
'Not much, just that John was working with Mycroft to bring Mary down and that the baby wasn't his. I assume that John found out stuff about Mary after the wedding since he seemed perfectly happy before then.' Greg sighed.
'And instead you had to pretend to be happy with the new wife and baby on the way. Christ John, that's shit. I mean what the hell are you going to do?'
"You're the best thing for him as well John, I've seen it. He's a changed person since meeting you. Before Greg I would have said that love was your greatest weakness, but now I see that it is also your greatest strength. Without your love, neither of you would be where we are today." John smiled taking everything Mycroft had said in. He was glad that his brother in law appreciated how much he loved Sherlock.
"So your saying that Sherlock is your mind palace, hmmm. Well it may be Sherlock in your head, but he's not actually here. So technically you do actually see it all but your brain uses Sherlock to work through it."
John bolted upright, Sherlock's name on his lips as he awoke from another re-enactment of the worst day of his life, just two weeks previous. Sweat clung to him and his breath came out in painful gasps. Tears began to fall down his cheeks as he sobbed into his hands. Two weeks of hell. Every night he would revisit that day, and every time he would wake up screaming. He could hardly bare staying at the flat, but leaving was something that he couldn’t, wouldn’t do. He saw Sherlock everywhere and it broke his heart every time. The man he loved, his Sherlock was dead.
This time he leant in for a kiss, arms still wrapped around each other. It started soft before pushing John forward, lips still connected, closing the door behind him with his foot. The tables turned and he found himself thrust up against the door as John kissed him, their tongues battling for dominance. He could feel John's arousal through his jeans, and more of his blood disappeared down south, causing further stains on his own erection. Oh God, he needed more, more friction. He growled against John's mouth thrusting upwards causing both men to cry out.
John shook his head, his eyes once again moist with unshed tears. He couldn't leave, what if something happened, what if Mary came to finish the job, he couldn't lose this man, not again.
"Dean. You're going to stab one of us with that blade." Cas chided. "Besides, that was forged in Heaven, not hell."
“You’re pretty far along too. You get that far along you start resonating with the word. Or with it’s source on a material plain…with me.” Metatron smirked, smug with the fact.
The vamp contemplated this as he reeled from the pain of shattered kneecaps. “He…our father…can send messages…to all vampires, telepathically.”
"Sherlock, what in God's name are you doing, showing up to a crime scene high as a fucking kite?" He whispered sternly as his eyes searched to make sure no one else was in hearing distance.
“I don’t know if I should be telling you this, but when I got home today I opened up the fridge to grab something, and there was a bloody
The D.I. huffed out a bitter scoff and shoved his shirt back on. He felt over-exposed. Mycroft's words hurt, because Greg actually had hoped that he could sway the man. That he could be an exception to the rule. He thought that he was getting somewhere with the elder Holmes brother. Turns out he was wrong.
Sherlock braced John's hips and rolled his up, craving more friction. He was growing hard from all of this new attention, and by the feel of this latest action, so was his doctor.
Greg blushed deeply. “Thank you? I, uh, yeah. Yeah, you can come home with me tonight. No! Not in that way. I’m not trying to get a leg over with anyone. I just…I mean, you’re a nice bloke and, and you’re easy on the eyes, but you’re not my type…”
“A Study in Pink. Nice.” Sherlock’s deep voice proclaimed in monotone from his laying position on the sofa.
The creature chuckled half heartedly. “Show’s how much you imbeciles know.” A roll of the eyes echoed his distain for the humans in front of him. “Oh?” Mycroft questioned. He picked up a small blade, eyed it thoughtfully, then replaced it on the tray. He returned his gaze to his victim, then preceded to pick up a simple hammer.
something useful in this bunker! I knew it!" Dean lifted up the file he'd been reading and pointed at it. "It's an enchanted object that indicates when supernatural artifacts are nearby."
There was one feeling, however, that the D.I. still struggled with: Loneliness. Greg couldn't stand to be alone in his flat. The silence was deafening. He spent longer hours at the office and more nights out at the pub. His flat only seemed to serve a purpose when he needed to sleep.
Bobby raised an eyebrow at Dean, then he raised the crowbar he had in his hand. As he prepared to strike, however, the being turned around and grabbed the weapon. Fingers were then laid upon his forehead and the old man instantly crumpled to the ground.
Dean slowly nodded and he reached a hand up to cup his angel's face and leaned in to kiss him gently.
"It was my mistake." Castiel admitted. "Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them." He explained. "I was wrong."
“No, no, no. You know I can’t possibly be away from the office for any length of time, not with the career and re-elections, well, you don’t need to know about that, do you? Besides, a case like this, it requires…legwork.” He said, the last word making him grimace.
The soldier abandoned the kettle on the stove and strode over to the kitchen door frame to glare at the taller man taking up the couch.
Sherlock quickly returned with the severed head from the fridge, and tossed it at John. The solider instinctively caught it, then immediately dropped it on the coffee table with a loud thud. “Christ Sherlock! What the hell?”
"This?" Castiel grabbed at the trench coat covering him and looked down at it thoughtfully. "This is...a vessel." He peered back up at Dean through his lashes.
"Is...Is he..?" Lestrade tried to swallow the lump back down, but the sting of tears kept it firmly in place.
The mysterious man swayed with the force of the blow. Then he grabbed the handle, pulled it back out, and dropped it to the floor, completely unaffected.
“If you’d let me finish…” The angel snapped back. Dean glared at him through the rearview mirror. “I was saying, a mortal can complete the trials but they would die from it. A hero, however, would be a much better choice, because the weight of the trials wouldn’t crush them.” It was silent for a few seconds while Cas let them absorb the news. “The spell Metatron gave you, it’s a Heroes Spell. It would give Sam the ability to take on the last trial without succumbing to the raw holy power of it.”
"Ay, but I could have you arrested for kidnapping. And a detective inspector, no less." But his voice quickly dropped it's anger as he took in his surroundings.
“Uh, yeah. I mean, again, it didn’t make much sense. He said something about Hercules and, uh…what’s the other dude’s name? Achilles? Yeah. I don’t know, maybe those were his favorite stories or something.”
"It was a test," Cas confirmed. "to see how you would preform under...battlefield conditions, you might say."
The young hunter scrambled to grab the demon knife off of the table behind him, and held it behind his back. "Who are you?" He demanded sternly.
John gave him a death glare that could have melted impermeable ice. Sherlock could feel it before he even stole a glance at John.
And now John is thankful that at least his muscle's have memories, because his brain has short circuited. Alas, his free arm automatically rises up to pull Sherlock in by the waist and keep him impossibly close.
“Hey, can you turn that down?” Sam yelled over the ringing in his head. Holding his hands over his ears wasn’t helping.
John huffed in response and then retreated into the kitchen to make tea. It seemed as though things were going to go right back to normal.
He shifted his gaze to John’s now inquisitive face. “That being said, Great Britain has the finest reputation for having the lowest numbers of monster induced crime, all thanks to a government run secret society called the Men of Letters.”
Dean attempted a false smile and then readjusted his focus to the road, only to see something laying in the middle of it. He stomped on the brakes, bringing Baby to a skidding halt.
Cas' brows scrunched slightly as he quickly scanned over the objects. "None of these are what we require for the spell." He scowled.
"It's Greg. And you're playing with fire, Sherlock. One of these days, if you don't stop, you're going to get burned."
Mycroft tried not to smirk, though he was amused at the sarcasm. "I prefer to meet with persons-of-interest face to face." He explained.
He shrugged to himself. "Sherlock needs a firm hand and he needs to understand that his actions have consequences. But, he's also brilliant and I'd prefer not to charge him for his offenses today. Don't want him to be deemed unfit to work along side my police force."
"Right." Dean stated dumbly. "That's why I s...you know what? Nevermind." He waved his hands in front of him as if to erase his words.
That shut Greg up spectacularly. Enough so, that Mycroft raised an eyebrow in question at the older man. "Surely, you knew about Sherlock's condition?"
They stood like this for quite some time. Long enough to draw concern from the other Winchester in the next room over. "Everything okay in there, Dean? D'ja Fall in?" Sam called.
“No.” He responded simply to his lap. Then he lifted his head to look at Dean while putting on a fake smile that resembled a grimace more than anything. “But I will be.”
John had been sitting at the bar, nursing a pint, for about forty five minutes before Greg finally showed up. The D.I. sat on the stool next to him and began apologizing profusely.
"If you don't want your boyfriend to die, then I suggest you stay exactly where you are. Don't move."
Ugh, my poor Destiel heart! I hope those two work it out. I'm not pleased with the way Dean has been treating Cas.
"We need to talk Dean." The creature announced. "Alone." He added, while looking curiously down at the collapsed hunter.
"Thank you Gregory. How kind of you to say." Mycroft found himself being pulled steadily toward the other man, like a magnetic force. Another man of power, but wrapped in a nonchalant and charismatic shell. How unorthodox. And lovely.
Mycroft found himself a bit stunned by this. Perhaps it was because the Inspector's attention was so obviously on him and not on the consulting detective they were meant to be discussing. After a moment of recovery, he replied. "Oh my. Do excuse my manners. The name is Mycroft Holmes."
The vampire’s eyes flickered from the weapon, now at Mycroft’s side, to his face. He noticed the muscles in the tall man’s forearm flex as he gripped the handle tighter. Saw the calm yet malevolent intent behind his eyes. This man was dangerous, the vamp decided. Darker than he first assessed. Mycroft stepped closer and raised to strike. The vampire’s whole body tensed, his head snapped to the side, and he squeezed his eyes shut. “Wait! Wait!” He shouted, voice laced with fear and anger.
Sherlock released the tension in the make shift tourniquet around his arm, the chemical compound now mingling with the red blood cells in his veins. A sigh of relief escaped him and he slumped against the dingy wall of the slum house he was in. Sherlock closed his eyes and began assessing the changes in his body as the cocaine solution took hold. Increased heart rate, an added alertness to his mind, and yet a pleasant buzz from dopamines flooding his brain.
“I see you’ve written up the taxi driver case.” Sherlock mentioned to John later, in order to deflect from a dispute about body parts in the fridge. John stood with one hand on his hip and the other pressed against his forehead.
"Hold on!" But the hunter's grip was slipping. "Dean!" The name sounded like a panicked plea from the angel.
Dean let out the breath he didn't know he was holding and sat back into the bench. A whoosh signaled Castiel's departure.
“Aliens? You can’t be serious.” Dean added. “They’re not real! The only time we even encountered a story of E.T., it was just Gabriel playing tricks.”
The scribe looked around the room and tilted his head, as if listening for something. Then he was gone.
"Should I even ask how they know you?" John inquired on their way to the bar. "Did you ensure a death or save a life?" He laughed, but quickly dismissed it. "No. Never mind. I don't actually want to know."
"Ah, bloody Christ!" Lestrade threw his whole body into the statement. His body tensed, he dipped his head, and his hands shot up. "I should have known. What with all the drama and the craziness that this," Greg gestured around the room and back towards the car, "whole meeting puts off. Geez, Is everything with Sherlock this obnoxious?"
"No. I want this. I want you, John." He replied with enough certainty in his voice to warrant another hot kiss from his doctor.
"All this energy has to go somewhere, Lestrade. Since I am unable to expend it physically or mentally, verbally is the only option left."
John chuckled and looked to Greg, then Sherlock. “Very funny. You honestly expect me to…” John paused as Sherlock shot up out of his chair and rocketed into the kitchen. “…believe that?” He finished incredulously.
Both of the detective's hands came up weakly to the arm wrapped so tightly around his neck, trying to fight but failing miserably.
The hand stayed on the angel’s shoulder for a few lingering moments, and the seraph knew why. Dean was contemplating wether he was going to make his next move. It took several more moments before the tattooed blond hesitantly leaned down to press his lips against Cas’. The kiss was light, gentle.
"I need you to go along with everything I say tonight." Sherlock instructed as he buttoned his wrist cuffs.
"Sherl...?" John began to question when the detective's other hand reached up to rest at the crook of the soldiers neck.
“MOTHERFUCKER!!!” The monster screamed at the men of letters. His fangs extended and he tried admirably to surge forward out of his restraints, but to no avail. Another string of profanities spewed from his mouth. “I’m going to kill you! I’m going to rip your throats out!”
Sam huffed in annoyance. "Look, just because you're uncultured doesn't give you the right to be ignorant." "Hey-" Dean began to protest. "However, I do agree that London is the first place you and Cas should check out."
"...and yet, even though you stopped Sam Hane, the seal was broken. And we are one step closer to hell on Earth for all creation." The hunter cringed at the implication. "Now, that's not an expression, Dean. It's literal." They shared yet another glance. They seemed to do that a lot. "You of all people should appreciate what that means."
"Oh, please." Sherlock rolled his blood shot eyes. Lestrade shoved him ungracefully into the back seat, slammed the door, and then locked it. "I'll deal with you after I wrap up here."
Sherlock pushed his sleeves up to his elbows, smirked at John, and then went straight in towards the pack. “Sherlock!” John shouted, alarmed by the recklessness. The detective got a needle into the first vamps arm and she dropped. But then the other two monsters attacked. They quickly rid the detective of his toxic syringes.
Lestrade strode over next to John, turned his back to the brothers, and leaned in to whisper in John’s ear. “You’re going to want to sit down for this one, mate. It’s a bit of shock.” He clasped John’s good shoulder in camaraderie and gave it a squeeze, before tossing himself on the sofa.
"Dr. Coleman," The eldest Holmes brother greeted with a false tone of light cheer. "I do hope that things are being handled rather discreetly regarding this infestation."
Then an idea came to him. He signaled Sherlock to stay where he was and then quickly darted over to the other side of the door frame. Next he bent down to retrieve a small knife he kept strapped to his ankle, and then threw it down the hall. It clanked and clattered.
"This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith." Castiel told him condescendingly, his icy blue eyes boring into Dean's.
"Oh." Dean deflated. "Well, what about the rest of these?" He asked, gesturing to a vast expanse of weapons laid out on a table in front of them.
Dean looked down at the angel's hand on his torso, then back up at Cas. Was he trying to protect him from re-experiencing hell?
“Hmm?” That seemed to wake him up a bit more. “Oh. Sorry.” He withdrew his hand and used it to rub his prickly face.
"With all due respect, it may very well be an intriguing endeavor on your part. I certainly might get a thrill out of you putting me in handcuffs, however." Mycroft speculated boldly. The D.I.'s eyes went wide at that statement, but then his whole demeanor shifted to one of flirtation. The older man was so expressive and his devilishly handsome good looks had Mycroft's thoughts in an unusual place. Not that he never...well, anyway...He cleared his throat to ground himself back to reality. "We need to talk about Sherlock."
Dean ventured into the war room, where Sam was nose deep into research. He cleared his throat noisily to catch his brother's attention.
Metatron laughed in amusement. “It was something to watch.” He told them. “What you brought to his Earth, all the mayhem, the murder. Just the raw, wild, invention of God’s naked apes…it was mind blowing! But really. Really, it was your story telling. That is the true flower of free will. At least, as you mastered it so far. When you create stories, you become gods of tiny, intricate dimensions themselves. So many worlds! I have read as much as is possible for an angel to read and I haven’t caught up.” The angel mused.
The taller man leaned in to whisper in Greg's ear, breath hot and tickling the sensitive skin. "I get very few precious hours to do with what I please, Gregory. I assure you that I make the most of that time." Greg gasped and shuddered at the implications, and a smirk tugged at Mycroft's lips. He abruptly pulled away from the D.I and stood up straight. A coy smile now plastered on his face.
Things finally started settling down for him several weeks later. The distance from his relationship problems made his emotions much easier to manage.
John obeyed, sinking to his knees in the dark alleyway, his hands still up and his fingertips coming to rest behind his ears.
“That’s eloquent speak for torture.” Greg supplied. “See, Mycroft, here, is well practiced in that field. An expert, actually. So, if I were you, I’d start talking.” He supplied in a dangerous voice.
John and Greg easily pushed through the crowd gathered on the street. Lestrade flashed his badge at the officers manning the police tape, and he and John ducked under the flimsy plastic barrier.
Mycroft swiftly returned the phone to it's receiver and then stared at it with scrutiny for a few moments, before turning to his assistant. "Anthea, I need you to do a pick up and then meet me at the old warehouse in precisely ninety minutes." He ordered.
“My Father loved to create. He made billions of galaxies. You honestly think yours was the only planet with life on it?” Cas questioned condescendingly.
Dean sat hunched atop an old wooden table in the abandoned barn, twirling his knife into the structure beneath him. An exasperated sigh left him and he rolled his eyes in annoyance.
Gerard, knowing that the life would leave Sherlock's eyes soon, turned his head to look down. And in doing so, the grip on his pistol loosened.
useful in the archives." Sam commented, sitting more upright in his chair and preparing to give Dean more of his attention.
He quickly wondered just how many suits the man owned. It seemed that the one he was in was worn rather frequently. Then there's the matter of that dastardly ring on his finger. Unhappily married though, as indicated by the tan line not standing out as much as it should if he never took it off, and the indentation not as prominent. No, it seemed this man was married more to his work than his spouse, and was not always faithful to either. The one thing he couldn't quite figure out is why the other man seemed to have an interest in him.
“Cure a demon?” He pondered out loud. “Okay, knowing the fact that I don’t actually know what that means, if we do this, you get better, right?” He asked Sam. “And then you stop tryna cough up a lung and bumping into furniture?”
Dean took a minute to process this. He shook his head and licked his lips as he gathered his thoughts. He tossed his hands up without them leaving the safety of his knees. "It was a witch." He explained to the angel. "Not a tad offensive." He added sarcastically, and that managed to coax a huff of laughter from the etherial being.
“Look, why don’t we call it a night and pick this back up in the morning? I’’m exhausted.” Sam said.
Lestrade eyed the tall man suspiciously. He clasped a firm hand around one of Sherlock's forearms, preventing him from getting any closer to the body lying in the alleyway. It was still swarmed by half of the forensic team anyway. Greg's gaze intensified as he soaked in the sight before him. The raggedy appearance, the dilated pupils, and the buzzing energy overflowing and causing Sherlock to bounce on his heels.
John grabbed Sherlock by the back of the neck with one hand, and braced his other against the couch to keep himself from falling onto the detective, and kissed him. Hard. (As possible, with the head injury.)
Dean reached up and grabbed a hand towel to dry his face on. As he was patting his skin, however, he heard it. The unmistakable sound of angel wings fluttering. A light breeze of disturbed air prickled at the hunter's neck. He dropped the towel (and his jaw) and stared wide eyed at the reflection of his angel in the mirror.
The vamps face paled. “You guys are fucking sick.” He snapped. “What do you guys get off on trying to hurt people or something?” He rocked back and forth in his chair, pulling at the chains, making a loud racket.
Mycroft smiled lightly and dipped his head to try to hide his amusement. "Yes. I'm afraid that you've only just begun to uncover the eccentric nature of all that encompasses my little brother."
The crisp night air felt nice against John's skin as he emerged from the taxi to follow Sherlock to the front of the line.
Mycroft sighed in displeasure and the grip on his glass tightened slightly. He should just cut it off here. Gregory was right about their jobs being connected. If things were allowed to continue, there could be some detrimental consequences.
The door to the room opened and Greg rolled in a cart filled with all sorts of menacing looking weapons and tools. The D.I. glared at the vampire, taking in it’s greasy appearance, skinny frame, and dread locked hair. “You sure you’re going to be able to extract any information from this one, Mycroft? He looks like the nest’s lackey, at best.”
John smiled and shrugged. “Guess he’s stuck with me then, whether he likes it or not, the insufferable git.”
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't." He voiced sternly. "You can't honestly expect to be allowed to do your 'consulting detective' thing, if you continue to put drugs in your system. I don't care how good you are, there are RULES, Sherlock. Rules that even YOU have to follow."
Though he had befriended and moved in with Sherlock within record time, John was sure he would be unraveling the mystery that was Sherlock Holmes for the rest of his life. And he certainly hoped that would be the case. Sherlock was as intriguing and brilliant as he was irritating and emotionally inept. John marveled at the contrast.
John walked out into the cool London air and headed for a pub on the other side of town. On the way he pulled out his phone and sent a text.
“Unless you tell me what I need to know, I will alight the nerves in the areas you’re most sensitive to pain, with such force that you will be brought to the very brink of your threshold, and then,” Mycroft rested the blunt head of the hammer on the vampire’s sternum and pressed into it to emphasize his point, “then I will keep you there indefinitely.”
“Oh, we’ve barely just begun.” Mycroft assured him. He removed his jet black suit jacket and draped it over the steel chair opposite the vampire as he asked, “Why are your kind flooding into our harbors and streets?”
"I can monitor my little brother quite well on my own," Mycroft assured. "However, it would be immensely helpful, were you to relay information and perhaps even steer him away from certain cases or situations."
Cas' mind went blissfully blank at the contact. His body on the other hand, responded. His hands splayed out across Dean's lower back, wanting to have more of him in his grasp. Cas' lips meet the pressure of Dean's and he even began to deepen the kiss. A moan rose from his throat and it came out in a growl that Dean swallowed up greedily as he slipped his tongue into the slick heat of Cas' mouth.
As soon as the aforementioned creatures entered the hall, Sherlock and John ambushed them. Then they rushed in on the other two.
Lestrade piped up. “You may as well, Sherlock has hardly been trying to keep a wrap on things. John’s just about figured it out himself.”
Mycroft looked down at Greg's shoes as one corner of his mouth turned up in smirk (He seemed to be doing a lot of that in Gregory's presence.) before redirecting his gaze back to Greg's dark chocolate eyes. "I suppose if you really must put a word to it, then yes."
Cas let him. The angel's heart broke as he listened to the quiet sobs and felt the tears seep through his coat. He was the cause of this pain. Why did it feel like he was always a source of pain for Dean, when all he wanted was to bring him peace and comfort?
There was still shouting and the sounds of a scuffle from the bar area, and everyone seemed to be drawn to it.
"Yeah?" Dean's lip curled up in a sneer. "Thanks for that." He said flatly before shoving the knife straight into the man's heart.
The kiss isn't wild. It's quite chaste in fact. Yet, John's heart is racing wildly. He's never kissed a man before, but this doesn't feel wrong, because it's Sherlock.
"I see. Do put Ketch and his team on it, then. It will take longer and require more resources, but we will still be able to exterminate them all."
Dean noted the huge, what was that? A spear? In Cas' hand. It had a gold tip but the handle looked to be made out of carved wood.
Mycroft entered the cold, bare, interrogation room and closed the door behind him. His gaze pierced the unfortunate vampire that was chained to the steel table by reinforced restraints, specifically designed to accommodate supernatural strength.
Alas, it was nice to write about season 8 Destiel, it's one of my favorite seasons for them and it would have been an excellent place for canon Destiel. <3
Sam went off to his room and Dean quickly showed Kevin to a spare one. On his way back to Cas, Dean stopped in the kitchen to grab a couple beers. He walked into the war room cautiously, observing the angels slumped posture. He placed a long neck bottle down on the table in front of the other man with a light thunk. Cas didn’t react. He kept his head down and seemed to be focused inward.
The taller man trailed his fingers slowly up over Gregory's well defined torso. His fingertips teased lightly over a nipple, and he rolled his hips forward.
“Because you’re an idiot.” John sighed fondly. “Okay, just remember the plan. Inject them with dead mans blood, then tie them up and leave them until we come back around to collect them all.”
Mycroft blushed slightly under the D.I.'s gaze. He paused for a moment to fully read the man in front of him; The way he held himself, leaning in towards him slightly. The smile radiating confidence, but there was also the way he grasped one hand loosely in the other across his body, as though still guarded. The smile didn't completely reach his eyes: Nervousness. Speaking of his eyes, they were a beautiful shade of dark brown. Bagged underneath from sleepless nights, at the office, no doubt. He must spend most nights there, what with the state of his suit. Being a detective inspector doesn't pay as well as one might think.
Upon hearing his name and title the other man's body relaxed ever so slightly. "I'm sure you're aware that I do, in fact, possess a mobile phone." Greg snarked.
"DON"T. WANT. TO. KNOW!" Sam bellowed, throwing the papers in his hands at his brother to get him to shut the hell up. They flew around in a flurry of white, none of them hitting their target.
“Nothing ever happens to me.” That is what John had told his therapist so recently. Now here he was, swept up in a whirlwind named Sherlock Holmes. Every day after they met proved more interesting than the last.
"He..." Cas looked over, directly at Dean. "He's the the blacksmith of the gods, and most likely the only being capable of forging weapons in hell fire. That is, if he's even still alive. Most of the gods he worked for were killed during the apocalypse."
Maybe Greg heard wrong. Perhaps there were mafia members that call themselves vampires or something. He clasped the door handle to steady himself, still not sure if he should even really knock, or if he should try to come back later. Monsters, Sherlock had said. gods. vampires. supernatural. That's not possible. But why would these two, with their overly clever brains, even entertain the idea?
“Yeah, well, he probably wanted everyone to think that he was. The cowardly bastard. Anyway, it doesn’t matter. We know what the third trail is now. Sam can get back to normal. And every evil thing lurking in hell will be locked up tight in the pit. Forever.” Dean stated.
The words came across his lips before his brain had fully processed the question. It was an automatic answer because it was the truth.
“Well, for starters, I am not a hunter. I am a man of letters.” Mycroft explained as he carefully rolled up his sleeves and re-buttoned them at the elbow. “I’m also a man of impeccable taste and I would prefer not to get blood stains on my Westwood attire.”
John looked over at Sherlock, laid out on the couch with a bandage around his head and a neck brace on, and thanked God that he was still alive.
“The bastard kidnapped me right after I had met Sherlock, trying to vet me. Made it to seem like he was all powerful and all knowing. He…” John giggled, the drink loosening his inhibitions slightly. “He offered me money to spy on Sherlock even. Course, I turned him down. He didn’t like that I saw right through his theatrics.”
“Vampire.” Mycroft answered. “We’ve been having a bit of a problem with those nasty creatures as of late.”
"...Can't stand your kind!...I oughta sock ya right in the jaw...doing something like that, and in a public place!..."
“Oh, you meant spectacularly ignorant in a nice way? Look, it doesn’t matter to me who’s prime minister, or who’s sleeping with whom…” Sherlock explained, waving his hands about as he talked.
"No. Absolutely not. I'm not letting you fuck up my entire crime scene in your altered state." Greg pulled the young man onto his feet and managed to walk him over to the squad car, despite Sherlock's protests. "You're so-called 'Consulting Detective' job is a privilege, Sherlock. You're lucky I don't have you tried for contempt, among other things."
"I'm a married man." Greg contended when Mycroft's hands moved up to unbutton his crisp white dress shirt. "Doesn't that bother you?" Mycroft's deft fingers made quick work of the buttons and soon the shirt hung open. "No." He answered clearly as he pulled the fiber barrier off. It fell to floor, leaving bare skin in it's absence.
“Yep.” Greg nodded, popping the ‘p’ as he tossed the weapon onto the table with a loud clang. He sighed. “I’m not as young as I used to be.”
"What the hell do you think you're doing? Let me go!" Sherlock shouted. "I need to examine the body! You need me! You need my help!-"
Bobby and Dean shared a glance with each other, perplexed. As the thing came forward, it was obvious that it resembled a man. He was shorter than Dean, with dangerously dark spiky hair and unnaturally piercing blue eyes.
There was more silence. Then the door swung open without any warning and the Detective Inspector fell through the portal. "Shit!" He cursed when he landed, the folder knocked from his grasp and papers flying from it.
"Alas, the work that he's begun recently is good for him, as well as your police force. I don't wish to discourage it, only to monitor it." He finished.
Castiel ventured closer still. It made Dean uneasy. "Good things do happen, Dean." He assured, stopping only when he was within inches of the man.
"I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition." The man answered in an impossibly deep baritone.
The vamp’s eyes flashed with anger, which caused Greg to smirk in response. Mycroft took less than a second to read into his counterpart’s interrogation technique. He sighed dramatically as his hands roamed over the supply of torture devices at his disposal. “I suppose you are correct, Gregory. He’s not likely to know anything at all. Perhaps it would be prudent to just kill him quickly and move onto the next vampire.”
"We are. But we may as well settle in a bit. Wouldn't want to draw too much attention to ourselves, and besides it may be a while before our guy shows his face." Sherlock explained over the loud music.
Now it was Sherlock's turn for a brain malfunction. The addition of tongue felt so...erotic. And in public! He could have scolded John for his boldness.
He thought he'd had this mess of a case sorted, but there it was mocking him. He had forgotten to have Sherlock fill out the one thing he needed to wrap up the case and it was going to court in two days. It couldn't wait. He sighed miserably as he stuffed the papers into a spare folder and stood up to grab his coat and keys.
“Oh Hell! What does that matter?!?” Sherlock argued. “So the Earth goes round the sun. If we went ‘round the moon, or ‘round and ‘round the garden like a teddy bear’, it wouldn’t make any difference! All that matters to me is the work. Without that my brain rots.” Sherlock violently tousled his dark curls, then abruptly stopped and glared at John. “Why don’t you put that in your blog? Or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world.” With that Sherlock threw the magazine back onto the coffee table, and then flipped onto his side to lie down facing the couch cushions like a sulking child.
“Yes!” John insisted. “It’s not just the fridge full of body parts, Greg. The bookshelves are lined with odd books, some of the jars of substances he keeps look really strange to me, and yesterday I found an old shoebox full of small animal bones.”
He buried himself deep into his work, and tried to resist calling on Sherlock unless absolutely necessary. Greg found that the mad genius was acting differently towards him since the blow out with his brother. It was a headache he'd rather do without.
Greg's heart sank. They were arguing about something. They were always arguing, those two. Greg pushed his ear lightly to the door to hear better. Sherlock was loud, as per usual, but he only caught parts and pieces of Mycroft's sentences.
"Hey, ya heard him. Piss off." The bartender shouted, now that he had been alerted to the situation by the commotion of it all.
The angel slumped Kevin into one of the leather armchairs and laid his hand over the boy’s chest. His grace permeated through the prophet and healed him, but Kevin didn’t wake.
Sherlock rolled his his eyes and Greg gritted his teeth in agitation. "Jesus, you're lucky you aren't dead right now with what you were on!"
