He extended his hand out to the still silent boy, standing awkwardly for a few seconds before dropping it to his side.
With the breath knocked from his lungs, Crowley groans and rolls into his back, coughing harshly from the inability to catch his breath. Lucifer walks to where Crowley landed, standing over him and looking down at him. You could hear a low growl escape the vessel of Lucifer as he crouched down over Crowley, cocking his head to the side. "This is where you really belong, little doggie." Lucifer reaches his hands down patting the top of Crowley's head the grips his fingers into his hair pulling him from the ground.
When Cas woke up in the morning, he nearly rolled off his bed but he caught himself by putting his hand against the side table. Slowly he shifted so that he was back on the bed, rolling over onto his back into the middle of the bed. He sat up quickly, once he realized he was alone in bed, sighing softly as he rubbed his eyes,
Cas released his grasp on Dean, reached his hand up, patting his cheek a couple times before he stepped around Dean and walked up to his house. Dean stood there in shock for a few minutes before he snapped out of it and turned on his heel to follow Cas into the house. Upon entering the house, Dean removed his shoes at the door as he had previously that night, then walked toward the kitchen. Before he had the chance to get to the kitchen, however, Cas was there, he grabbed Dean by the shirt and pushed him against the wall, "I need you to make me forget, Dean. Make me forget the pain." Cas pulled Dean forward, throwing his arms around Dean's neck until their faces were inches apart, forcing Dean to wrap his arms around Cas' lower back, "Cas...I...I'd be honored."
Sometime during the night Cas fell asleep leaning against the door because when he woke up it was morning and the birds were singing. Cas was thankful that it was spring time otherwise he would have frozen to death had it been winter. It wasn't his intention to have his dad find out he liked boys it just happened.
After leaving Cas' house, Dean made his way back to the motel room, he couldn't stop thinking about what an ass he made of himself. Then again, he'd never encountered anyone that lost someone, not in death anyway. Once he got back into the motel room, he walked to his laptop and pulled up his live. He  needed to distract himself, this whole night had been full of a whole lot of awkward that he wanted to forget. Admittedly Dean couldn't wait to get out of this town, to move on so he wouldn't have to see any of these assholes; but he couldn't seem to get his mind off of Cas.
Slowly, Cas brought his hand up to caress Dean on his cheek, "I understand now, I'm terrified of whatever this is. I just lost my husband honestly I don't even know if I'm ready to move on from that and now I find myself drawn to a sex worker, how does that happen?" Dean shrugs as he sat back on the couch looking down at the floor shaking his head a few times, "I don't know but perhaps we can figure that out together?" At this point Dean looked at Cas, pulling his lip up into a slight smirk, and Cas laughed softly as he nodded his head, "yeah sure I'd like that."
Once Dean was certain she was back in her office, he turned back to the door, pushed it open, and went inside throwing everything on the floor. He desperately needed a shower, he hadn't had one since the first night that he met Cas and frankly it made him feel disgusting. Dean had to be clean, especially in his line of work, being so filthy all the time wasn't sanitary. Sure some of his clients had that problem of not bathing, which he made a request that they do and posted it on his page for them all to see, but some never listened.
Dean shoved the list into Cas' hands, watching as confusion spread on his face, "this is a list of everything we've done, I want my money."
Dean nodded a few times, falling silent, he had an instant draw to that boy and he felt it. Anna laughed softly, rising from her seat, "let's get you some new clothes, would you like that?" Again he only nodded at her, hopping down off the bed and she led him away. Dean knew he had found something good here, and he was hoping he could stay for a while
Dean reluctantly glances up, his own green eyes meeting icy blue, and he swallows the lump in his throat. Shifting slightly, attempting to close the gap between them, Dean inhales softly with the words still stuck in his throat. He had planned out what he would say on the drive over, but now here in front of this  man that he cared so much for, he was at a loss.
Lucifer rises from the ground then turns on his heel, the demons that were in the room are stood in a corner, eyeing the Prince, fear very prominent on their faces. "Come now, friends, let us celebrate the return of your true king, no?" He reaches his hand out gesturing to one of the female demons, who eyes him cautiously before stepping forward and kneels before him her head lowered. The other demons follow her example shortly after Lucifer chuckles the steps forward until he reaches his throne, the demons following faithfully behind him.
Being inside the vessel he was in now, it felt strange. The emotions that Castiel had were far stronger than he thought. His body's reaction to certain things had Lucifer very confused and admittedly he kind of liked it, but you wouldn't hear him say anything about it. He was out of that wretched cage and that was all that mattered. Sure he may have played on the weaknesses of his new angel roommate but at least he was free.
"You shut your mouth and just give me my money." Cas looked down at the list once more, turning away from Dean as he looked it over. Admittedly Cas was a little hurt by this, yeah sure there was nothing romantic going on between them, but he didn't want to go back to being alone again either.
After she left the room, closing the door gently as she went, Dean curled up on the bed, and allowed himself to cry. He cried for the boy that loved secretly, until his mother walked in on him kissing his best friend in their underwear. He cried for his loss of family, although he was certain he could learn to love it here. But mostly, Dean cried for himself, the bravery he had in running from his own home, the strength he had not to give up completely.
"Would you like to come in?"
A/N: one more thing I'm sorry if this chapter was terrible. I love you guys tho xx
Dean hurried up the stairs, running into his bedroom and closing the door, locking it behind him.
Cas sat on the porch for about 15 minutes before his brother Gabriel showed up, parking in front of the house and quickly walking up the walk to where Cas was sitting.
Lucifer listened quietly for a few minutes, but nothing came through. He sighed softly rubbing his hand against his chin then the deep voice came through,
Cas sighed softly as he pulled things from his fridge so he could make himself breakfast Everything felt so different now, now that Ash was gone. The thing that happened between him and Dean had been a temporary fix, in fact he was fairly certain that he wouldn't be seeing Dean again, he hadn't even bothered to spend the night with Cas. He couldn't really hold it against Dean though, being that Dean was essentially a man of the night, one that pays for sex, and that's just not Cas. Admittedly, Cas wanted Dean to be here, so he could make breakfast for him.
"Yes" ....and that's when everything changed.
Hello frens, this is my first attempt at a kid!fic be gentle with me.
Dean turned to see Cas standing a few inches from him, with a slight smile on his face, he didn't respond right away but when he did all he said was, "see you tomorrow?" Cas nodded his head at him, the smile still on his face then Dean turned to open the door, "oh and Dean?" Dean paused before leaving then looked at Cas, his expression was soft, his eyes gentle, "yes, Cas?" Stepping forward, Cas reached out and placed his hand on Dean's cheek, "make sure that you come hungry?"
"So what is it then?" Cas' tone was softer now, although his face still held a stern expression.
Cas pulled back from Dean caressing his cheek with the back of his hand, the man still panting as he looked into Cas' eyes, "no, Cas, thank you. I...I've never had that happen before." Cas slipped himself out of Dean, and he heard a slight gasp escape Dean, making him chuckle softly; he moved to the side of Dean laying flat on his back, Dean was still staring at the ceiling, his mind was completely blank, the only thing he could really think about was everything that just went down. "That....was.....amazing." Dean laughed out loud, turning his head to look at Cas, then shifted so that he was laying on his side his head propped up against his hand and elbow resting against the pillow.
Cas hadn't really put much hope in Dean staying the whole night, but for some reason it still stung a bit, and he sighed heavily, as he pushed the blanket back. He climbed out of his bed, walking to grab some clothing to slip on from his closet, but once he opened the door memories flooded back from months ago.
"DEAN YOU OPEN THIS DOOR NOW!"
? Taking a deep breath Dean began typing out his response.
Dean raised his eyebrow in amusement, thinking to himself that this could be entertaining for him. Hitting the reply button, Dean began typing
Dean stared at the screen for a solid two minutes before he thought of a response, mostly because he was annoyed that he had a long night and now someone wanted him for another. People need their rest for fuck sake. Dean rolled his eyes but typed back a quick reply.
Word spread of Lucifer being temporarily allowed out of the cage, which also led to word being spread he was set free. Many of the demons of hell were grateful and overjoyed, others scattered across the earth hiding in fear, they knew their betrayal wouldn't be taken lightly. One of Lucifer's most trusted demons faithfully remained at the throne for his return.
Okay so I have been gone for a while now, I kind of had a bad year at the end of 2019, and have been trying to get better from that. I apologize to anyone that has been waiting for an update, I had it mostly written out and very recently wanted to get this out for you at least. This chapter is small, but I have already planned out the next chapter after writing the remainder of what I had written. Thank you all for understanding, enjoy!
Dean sighed heavily, leaning his head against the door,
Once he finished eating he left everything on the table, then made his way back to the living room plopping down onto the couch. Suddenly there was a ding on his laptop and he looked at it curiously,
Dean Winchester was the most sought after, the most efficient, and certainly the most attractive in his trade. He worked his butt off to make sure each client was satisfied no matter the request, which left his reputation one to be remembered. It was a typical Saturday night, Dean had just gave a client the most mind blowing night of his life and to say he was satisfied was making a vast understatement, as the man insisted on repaying any way he could. It had irritated Dean to the point that he accepted the request and allowed the client another night.
He hadn't moved an inch as he read the message, sitting completely still, shocked at how easy it seemed that Cas completely forgot what happened.
"Can I go outside and play with my friends now?"
Cas glanced at Dean from the corner of his eye while he continued to prepare the food, "you know it isn't polite to put your elbows on the table right?" Dean lifted his gaze toward Cas, sighed softly, then put his hands into his lap. Cas chuckled then went back to his task, humming softly as he worked. Dean shifted in the chair so that his legs were stretched in front of him, he sunk down in the chair slightly with his arms folded across his chest. "So, Dean, why did you choose to do what you do?" Again Cas didn't turn around when asking, so Dean narrowed his eyes at him but still he answered the question.
Stepping back on his left foot at those words, Dean's face falls. Sure he hadn't come with extremely high expectations -- hell he hadn't even wanted Cas to accept his apology -- yet somehow those 5 simple words were enough to stab him right in the chest. Maybe he deserved that, he
"Where am I?" His voice cracked slightly and he felt the dryness in his throat.
The sound made Dean jump slightly as he looked down at the small red dot at the bottom of his screen, indicating that he had a new message. He clicked on the message
The lights were switched off all throughout the house, Cas probably tucked comfortably in his bed. Dean sighed heavily leaning his forehead against his steering wheel,
He sat up turning the key, then looked ahead. There on the corner, head cocked to the side in confusion, stood Cas. Slowly Cas approached, Dean watching him intently as he stopped next to the car, and Dean rolled down his window, "Dean....what are you doing here?" At a loss for words, Dean looked away from Cas, wiping his hand across his mouth, "I...I just wanted to be sure you were alright."
"So why did you?" Cas' reply was instant, harsh, and Dean was certain they would burn if they could.
He'd spend countless amounts of time watching tv and humming to himself, all the while Lucifer strutted about in his vessel creating mayhem and destruction. If Castiel was completely honest, he actually thoroughly enjoyed not being in control. It meant no pain, no suffering at his own hands, he could be at peace in his mind.
. Cas dropped his hands, the shirt now resting in his lap, he slowly pulled the shirt onto his body buttoning it up, it was a little tight, and now he remembered why he gave it to Ash in the first place. Carefully, he unbuttoned his shirt slipping it off, settling to just put on some pajamas, then he went downstairs into the kitchen.
"Sorry about the restraints, you had a bit of fight in you when you got here, couldn't have you harming yourself."
Cas got up from the couch, going to the cabinet, and he pulled the hardest liquor he had from it then made his way back to the couch. Twisting the cap from the bottle, Cas brought it to his lips, drinking straight from the bottle,
Dean hesitated as he looked at Cas, he should say something, anything that could make this situation less awkward but what could he say? '
Staring at his screen, Dean leaned forward with his hands rested against his chin. He could see the words that Cas typed and he could also see his face. The look in his eyes, the way he spoke, he wasn't lying. Of course, no one else would know, they hadn't been around Cas like Dean had, they hadn't see the unraveling man in front of them, the broken soul who had just lost the love of his life. Dean felt sick. He dropped his hands from his face, letting his head fall.
Cas sat with his back against the frame of the front door playing with his fingers in his lap when the front door opened. Chuck walked out holding luggage bags in his hands and Cas watched him with confusion as Chuck threw the bags off of the porch and turned to walk back into the house, but not before looking down at Cas and shaking his head. Cas stood up and began to follow Chuck inside, "Daddy please....I'm sorry." Chuck turned around then gripped Cas by his shirt and shoved him backwards then closed the door again. Cas stared at the door for a few minutes before he dropped his head down, turning away from the door and slowly moving to sit on the steps.
"Are you a registered nurse, Michael? No I didn't think so, I know what I'm doing."
Dean chuckled softly at Cas' comment, if he only knew what that comment meant, especially to someone like Dean. "Alright let me back up," Cas backed up more onto the sidewalk, then Dean started up his car, shifting it into reverse, as he placed his arm behind the back of the passenger seat, looking behind him so he could get in properly. Once he was in the driveway he turned off the car, took a deep breath, sneaking a glance at the man that was walking up the drive, before dropping his gaze.
Lucifer lets out a long breath, rolling his eyes and shudders, the chill running swiftly down his spine. "You alright Cas?" Dean placed his hand gently on his shoulder and Lucifer looks at him cocking his head to the side. Again, his heartbeat picked up and he could feel the sweat forming on the back of his neck. Without thinking, Lucifer reaches his hand up and gently caresses Dean's cheek. He could hear the low growl in his mind and he knew that Castiel was angry with him. Lucifer grinned and it slowly turned into a smirk as he moved his fingertips along Dean's lower lip.
"Anna it's not helping, he's clearly in distress."
He would be ready when the time came however, for when he needed to expel Lucifer, in fact he was saving his strength for that very moment; but until then Castiel would remain in his solitude awaiting his time. He could feel the vessel moving but had become so used to what was happening that he paid no mind anymore. So when Lucifer finally made contact with Dean, Castiel was completely oblivious, just sulking about inside the vessel like a small child
Cas rested his hands against his chin then shook his head, standing up and walking back into the kitchen. Cas made himself eggs and some toast then sat at the table, alone. The alone part hurt him to his core, he was a desperate idiot, calling a sex worker to fulfill his stupid fantasy.
Cas let the tears fall down his cheeks as he sniffles softly,
He chose a place that was familiar to him, one that could be accessed easily without complication, so he settled on the kitchen of the bunker.
"Gabriel!" Cas jumped up, running into his brother's embrace in which Gabriel lifted him into his arms. He held the sobbing boy in his arms rubbing his back gently.
Again Dean felt the flush rush to his cheeks, and he turned his head away.
He slipped off his shoes leaving them at the entrance then followed the client to the couch, where he sat down looking up at Dean. "Please sit..." Dean moved to sit on the chair that was closest to the client, "uh sorry, I didn't catch your name when you messaged me...." The client gasped softly, lightly smacking himself in the head, "oh silly me, I'm....I'm Castiel."
Castiel looked deep into the eyes of Lucifer, fear starting deep in his chest threatening to rip through his throat, as he tries to remain calm. He keeps his eyes locked to the Prince, knowing full well that he's either going to live or die. He knew what he needed to do, the fate of the world depended upon his sacrifice. Suddenly Lucifer begins to emit a blinding white light as Rowena prepared to send him back to the cage from whence he came. Castiel must choose quickly before he disappears, so he said the one word that changed his life forever.
As Dean was preparing food, a sound came from the other room, indicating a caster has gone live and Dean stopped what he was doing, and turned away from the kitchen, making his way back toward his laptop. Slowly, while holding food in his hands, Dean walked back into the bedroom where he stepped in front of the laptop. His mouth fell open as he stared at the screen.
Once the words left her mouth, Michael left to retrieve the water, returning minutes later cup in hand. Smiling softly she took the cup from her brother, and finally -after what seemed like a lifetime to Dean- she removed the straps from his hands, handing him the cup.
"You know," he steps forward toward Crowley, placing his hand roughly on his shoulder and pulling forward until his mouth is against the demon's ear "you caused this, I hope you realize that. Her death, it's on you, puppy." Lucifer grabs Crowley throwing him effortlessly across the room, the echo of his body hitting the wall fills the room.
"I'm here little brother, I'm here."
Dean never saw the same client more than twice, which he clarified once the client asked for another night, much to the clients dismay. Once the night was through Dean left as quickly as he possibly could, not bothering to collect the money left on the night table. Dean sluggishly made his way back to the motel room that he had rented out, pushing the door open once he got it unlocked and throwing his bag to the floor. He has his personal laptop set up on the small night table that was conveniently placed at the foot end of the bed.
Cas slumped his shoulders slightly as he realized what was happening, "you're ending this, aren't you?"
The rest of the evening was spent talking about likes and dislikes, them both discovering their mutual enjoyment of classic rock, how both of their parents aren't involved in their lives, and how they both enjoy a good meal. "How crazy that we have so many things in common, Cas." Dean had his head resting in Cas' lap as he looked up at him, "yeah, it is." Cas was running his fingers through Dean's hair as they sat together on the couch, Dean had yawned a few times before he decided to lay in Cas' lap. "Are you tired yet?" Dean asked as he reached his hand up placing it on Cas' soft cheek, "a little yes." Sitting up slowly, Dean pulled himself into Cas' lap so that he was straddling him, "let's go to bed then."
The next morning, after Dean had gotten breakfast, he pretty much stayed in his motel room for a majority of the day. He got dressed and had decided that he would check out the profile of the client he would be servicing tonight, as he knew not a thing about the person. Once he pulled up his chats, along with his website, Dean clicked the name of his chat buddy from last night. The client was male, in his 30's, was born in this god forsaken town, and he was actually fairly attractive.

But it wasn't anything he couldn't handle, he's dealt with plenty of grief stricken clients and has not had one complaint. After a few minutes, Cas stood from his spot grabbing up his glasses, "thanks for coming over, even if it was possibly the strangest session you've had." Dean chuckled softly as he stood up as well, "honestly, if you can believe it, I've had stranger." Dean walked toward the door so he could get his shoes on, when he felt Cas behind him, "Dean thank you, really this meant a lot to me."
"Calm down, you're not in any danger."
Dean watched as Cas leaned forward probably so that he could read the chat, then he began typing on his keyboard.
"Why did you do that? You don't realize what you've done." Quickly Mary turned to her son, a sadness in her eyes, "go up to your room Dean, now."
"I'm Dean. Where am I?" Shifting so he was sitting up better, Dean reached up to scratch his head.
Crowley sat on the throne glancing around the room at the demons that stayed. He needed to find some way to silence the rumors before anyone got any bright ideas to overthrow him. He stood quickly slowly making his way to a table at the other end of the room. Suddenly the doors burst open and in the doorway stood Castiel. He had a look in his eye that sent shivers down The King's back but he tried hard to suppress the movement.
"Sorry I....I was just waiting until...." Dean trailed off, slumping his shoulders, a married man, how could he not notice that. Dean never ever services married people until they make a contract as a couple. "Look Cas, I don't want to tell you your business, but I'm not a replacement for whatever you may be lacking in your marriage man....." Hurt flashed across Cas' face as he set the glasses and bottle on the table, sitting down on the couch, "you're right, you aren't, he actually passed away a couple of weeks ago. I....I'm sorry....you don't have to stay if you don't want to." Dean shook his head at Cas,
"Mary, I'm not getting into it with you, this boy, he's a sinner. He's not even my son anymore. You hear that boy? You can get your diseased ass out of my house."
Dean took a quick sharp breath, releasing his hold on Cas' wrists, taking a step back, then his expression turned into one of pure desire, "then do it." Cas smirked as he pushed off the wall, stripping out of his own pants as he stepped forward, shoving Dean against the wall by his shoulders, once against putting his lips against Dean's ear, "you asked for it." Cas stepped back from Dean, then gripped his wrist pulling him toward the end of the hallway and up the stairs. Dean glanced around the dark rooms as they passed them until Cas stopped in front of a door, pushing it open and pulling Dean inside, flipping the light on and turning to face Dean. Cas released his hold on Dean's wrists but quickly threw his arms around his neck pulling his body against Dean's, "so, $40 an hour? Extra for oral, for kinks you'll try anything?"
It was a late Friday afternoon, during one of this live broadcasts, one of his viewers had made a comment regarding another broadcaster, one Dean had never heard of. They spoke highly of this caster, calling him a "god of the cam life." This had bothered Dean slightly, he wanted all of the glory, his reputation depended on it, and if other people got wind of this, then Dean could lose his following. Without a seconds hesitation, Dean banned the user from ever viewing his lives and continued on with his life.
"Cas I'm so sorry, I had no idea....." Cas shrugged his shoulders as he shook his head, "please Dean, there isn't any way you could have known." Dean dropped his gaze away from Cas, how could he be so damn insensitive, "still it was wrong of me-" Cas held up his hand then he reached down to pop open the wine bottle, and Dean walked over to take his spot next to Cas on the couch. "I used to cook for him, he loved it, always a meal ready for him when he got home. He was a serviceman, in the Navy, and..." Cas' voice grew shaky as he poured them both a glass, picking Dean's up handing to him, "he didn't come home, not alive anyway." A tear fell down Cas' cheek and instinctively, Dean reached up to wipe it away, which he froze the second he touched Cas' skin, "I asked you here so that I could have that one last dinner, ya know?"
Dean took the cup from her, hands shaking slightly as he brought it to his parched lips, and he drank it fast, god was he thirsty. Chuckling softly, Anna reached out for the cup and Dean handed it to her a smile forming on his small lips, "thank you miss."
It was the best, for the first three years, in which the boys remained at their closest, but eventually hormomes came into play, and everything suddenly became different, but not for the worst.
Lucifer holds out his arms a grim smirk spread across his lips, "I'm back boys." You could almost hear the breath get caught in Rowena's throat as she also stepped back from Lucifer. "Rowena." He walks slowly forward until his face is inches from hers.
"No he'll hurt me."
Cas walked up to the car as Dean was getting out, a sweet smile on his almost angelic face, if it were possible, Dean could swear that Cas was an actual angel.
Dean stripped his clothing off as he approached the bathroom leaving them trailed to the door then he entered the bathroom. Glancing at himself in the mirror he was able to finally see all of the marks that Cas had left on his chest, specifically the one that stood out on his left collarbone.
"Dean, I'm really glad that you're here, it means a lot to me. I know it's probably not typical for someone in... your line of work...." Dean shifted so that he was laying on his stomach, wrapping his arm around Cas pulling his body close, "I thought cuddling wasn't your thing." Dean leaned in resting his forehead against Cas' and he took a deep breath, "I did say that, didn't I?"Dean kissed along Cas' jawline , making his way slowly toward Cas' lips, where he paused for a few seconds, the gently nudged his lips against them. Cas reached his hand up, slowly running his hand from Dean's forearm all the way to his shoulder, as he returned the kiss.
Dean sat back slightly, a little offended by this man's tone, no one spoke to him like that: ever and it kind of excited him, "well it's as I said I've been known to help heal a broken heart. How about this? How about, I come back tomorrow and we can discuss terms."
It was the boy he had seen earlier, Castiel, this time his hair was away from his eyes, but he still had that trench coat on. But the hair nor the clothing is what threw Dean's heart in the air, no it was the boy's eyes. The soft color held the sky, with a dark ring of blue around the iris.
Dean turned the water on in the shower stepping into it, letting the water run down the front of his body, as he let his head fall back. He turned so the water was hitting his back leaning his head against the wall he couldn't stop the thoughts of Cas that invaded his mind,
Cas sighed softly, running his fingers through his hair, honestly this was not helping him at all. Every feeling that Dean helped him get rid of last night was back, only it hit him harder now. He had to find something to make himself feel better, something that will last, so he decided to get drunk. Yeah sure it was almost noon but Cas couldn't handle it, he didn't have a job, living off Ash's death benefits just as Ash wanted him to kept him living comfortably, but he had nothing else to occupy his time with.
From user: wingedangel67
Cas didn't waste any time as he crashed his lips against Dean's, the kiss full of desire, "Cas......Cas slow down." Dean whispered breathlessly against his lips, but truthfully he didn't want him to slow down, no Dean wanted this, he wanted the sex, he wanted to be ravished, and every inch of him fought that desire; because he didn't care about it, he cared about Cas, it was concern for the being that had his lips all over him, "I can't Dean..." Cas pulled back slightly, tears were flowing from his eyes, but there was still a lustful look in his eye, "I need this, I need the pain to go away. It hurts....it hurts so much." Cas dropped to his knees as he clutched his chest in his hands, "okay...okay Cas, I'll make it stop."
Again Dean shifted in the chair, leaning forward with elbows resting against his knees, "of course, my rates are $40 an hour. I charge extra for oral, cuddling isn't my thing so if you want that, it'll be and extra $200, I'll try anything at least once per client. We will be using protection, I don't know what kind of stuff you may be carrying...."
"But first, tell me, who else knows the spell for the cage." She grins at him, gently biting her bottom lip between her teeth, "just me."
for this one." Cas snorted turning his gaze to Dean, who was looking down into his eyes, "yeah sure, if you say so. You can repay me by having dinner with me tomorrow night. I'm going to make a pot roast." Dean had to laugh at that one, he shook his head covering his face with his hand, "what am I going to do with you Cas, hm?" He reached his hand down, running his thumb across Cas' cheek, "you have done something to me, I don't know how to describe it." Cas reached his hand up nibbling gently on his forefinger,
Dean took a deep breath, shaking his head as he stood up from the bed. "I'm gonna go..."
Cas enjoyed Dean's company just as much as Dean enjoyed his, so when more boys joined the campus after Gabriel had helped them escape, it was recommended that Cas and Dean share a room. They didn't hesitate, sharing a room with your best friend was the going to be best thing in the world for both of them.
Dean could hear them clear as day now, his vision slowly coming into focus as he looked at the woman in front of him. Her hair was a mix of brown and red, her facial features were gentle, youthful, and Dean felt he could trust her.
"Hello...." The voice was soft but deep and Dean stood there for a good minute in complete surprise at the sound of the voice he just heard, surely a voice that deep couldn't come from a man that looked almost like a teenager.
The instant he joined the chat his heart was practically jumping from his chest, as he watched Dean pleasure himself on screen, the comments that people were leaving made Cas nauseous and he couldn't watch it any longer. He reached out pulling his laptop shut, leaning forward covering his face with his hands,
When he looked back to Cas, a smile was on the blue eyed beauty's face, "oh? Well....I'm fine, thank you." Dean chuckled softly, pulling his lip up into a slight smile as he looked at his steering wheel gripping it in his hands. It was quiet for a few minutes, Cas standing there next to the car, and Dean tapping his hands on the wheel, "do you....do you wanna come inside?" Dean snapped his head toward Cas, angling his chin down slightly, the desire he felt to actually say yes to Cas surprised him, "uh..." Dean bit down on his bottom lip as he looked away from Cas, "what the hell, sure." Cas' face brightened up as he stepped away from the car, "you can pull into my driveway if you'd like."
The other man stares at Cas with damn near perfect puppy dog eyes -- their wetness showing through as a tear beaded at the side of his left eye. Sure it might be a little cliche -- a single man tear and all that -- but the heaviness Dean felt from those words alone, left an even heavier feeling within his chest.
"Well....no I don't do dates." Cas sat up, moving so that his back was rested against the headboard of his bed then looked down at his hands taking a deep breath and Dean shifted as he moved, "look I don't know what you are expecting from me Cas, but I can't be
Again the ding came, causing Dean to sigh heavily as he sat up, rolling over onto his stomach, "alright you horny son of a bitch, calm yourself." Dean pulled up the notification from his website, another request from another desperate person that he could satisfy with his delicious body and seductive ways. Glancing at the request, Dean furrowed his brow slightly as he read it. Such a strange request
Dean pulled his lip up into a smirk as he read the message,
Dean had been tracing his fingers along Cas' chest as soon as he woke in the morning, which had in turn woke Cas up as well. Now they lay with their legs tangled together and Dean resting his head against Cas' chest, listening to sound of his heartbeat. "Did you sleep okay?" Dean chuckled softly as he stretched his arm across Cas' chest, turning his head slightly as he placed gentle kisses along his chest. Sitting up slowly, Dean looked into Cas' eyes, then reached up to caress his cheek.
"So uh, Castiel... would it be alright if I just called you Cas?"
"Hey Dean, do you think you can help Sammy with his hands, he's made a mess all over." Mary said softly as she watched her 3 year old son throw his cake everywhere. The older child groaned as he sat across from his baby brother but reluctantly stood up to grab a paper towel.
"Louise, is everything alright?"
"John, he's just a boy." Mary's soft but stern voice came from outside of the room.
A/N: hello guys, first off I wanna say thank you so much for reading it means a lot to me. Second I would like to say that I will be writing this fic mainly from Dean's prospective but there will be times that I switch to Cas' just because it'll keep the emotion alive and we will get to see the things Cas is feeling as well. This chapter is going to be in the prospective of Cas. Thanks for reading xx
Dean could sense the hesitation, he could feel the fear radiating off Cas, the look in his eyes giving away most of it. Cas takes a step to the side, the doorway now giving room for Dean to walk through, and the man's expression softer than before.
Lucifer had practiced saying the line so many times so that when, and he knew it would be soon, Dean called he could put on his best Castiel impression. The moment finally presented itself when Dean called, requesting the presence of his favorite angel.
"Yeah sure if you think that will help you remember. A lot of people have a hard time remembering my name." Dean laughed softly to himself. Hard for him to believe that anyone could forget someone with a face like Cas. Dean had his thoughts interrupted by Cas clearing his throat, "so did you want to discuss pricing."
Castiel's silence is broken as he wipes his hand across his mouth and a long winded sigh escapes his lips. He had spent so much time drinking Dean away that first week, seeing him here now just made him want to tip the bottle and forget him all over again.
Dean stared off in a different direction, he couldn't let what he was feeling change anything, he was a sex worker not a fucking house husband. "Look I have guys lining up, for days, days Cas do you really think I give a tiny fuck about you, in any way?" The words came out like acid and he had to take a deep breath to catch himself. This was not normal for him, to feel the things he felt, to care for a client the way he cared for Cas. Maybe it was that Cas lost his husband that Dean felt sorry for him, that's all this was. But even knew that wasn't the truth, not really.
Cas nodded a few times before he entered the room, sitting directly in front of Dean's bed. Admittedly Dean was intrigued by this boy, he was different, awkward even, but something about the way he carried himself seemed almost angelic.
"I think just Dean is great."
Dean spoke as softly as he could, which even for him was a feat in itself. Keeping his eye on Cas he takes a few steps toward him, his heart was beating erratically within his chest. He felt like he was going to throw up, and he knew it was because of what happened between them. But Cas hadn't made the effort to move from where he was standing, instead he stares at Dean in silence.
"I'm starting breakfast soon, I hope you came hungry."
Dean washed himself quickly, then got out, wrapping the towel around his waist, and walked back into the room where he laid down on the bed. Dean stared up at the ceiling, all while notifications came pouring in on his laptop, and he sat up slowly staring down at the laptop that he still hadn't moved from the floor.
"My brother found you on the side of the road, you had fallen, you were dehydrated so he brought you here. What were you doing out there all alone like that?"
Cas had turned away slightly, in an attempt to hide the flush in his cheeks, "Cas is everything alright?" Turning back to face Dean, Cas gently bit his nail on his thumb then slowly dropped his hand to his side, "I'm perfectly fine Dean. I agree let's order something."
"I can't help you Dean."
The front door opened and Chuck walked out standing at the top of the steps, "you take that filthy thing away from my house, both of you are never show your faces here." Gabriel glared at Chuck, still holding tight to a tearful Castiel as he stepped forward to grab the luggage that laid in the yard.
Dean shut off his car then got out, making his way to the front door and he knocked lightly standing back slightly from the door. After about a minute, someone answered the door, it was the client, which Dean had to admit was so much more attractive in person. The client remained behind the door, only peeking around slightly as he stared at Dean.
Minutes turned into hours, with Dean waiting as patiently as he possibly could,
Cas clenched his fist under the blanket then he looked up at Dean, gently biting his lower lip, "yeah okay."
Mary smiled softly at Dean but gestured toward the door, "be back no later than 6pm." Dean had already left the kitchen and went out the back door by then.
Cas stood next to the car until Dean got out and was standing in front of him, then he arched his left eyebrow slightly, "so is this a business visit?" Dean shut the door of his car, leaning against it with his arms folded across his chest, "well...." Pushing off of his car, Dean stepped forward until he was standing inches from Cas, "it can be, if that's what you want." Cas took a deep breath, closing the gap between them, as he reached up to grip Dean's shirt in his hands, pulling their chests together, "meet me inside, 5 minutes, don't keep me waiting." Dean looked into Cas' eyes, they were dark, a little dominant, and he felt a spark in his chest that caused his breath to get caught in his throat.
"Shh it's okay, I got you." Gently she rubbed the sobbing boy's back, her breathing calm as she released him, "tell me what happened. If you want to." Sitting back against the bed, Dean played with his fingers in his lap, and he looked up at her, the tears still in his eyes.
Dean rubbed his hand across his eyes, sighing heavily as he positioned his camera above his laptop, before hitting the 'go live' button. He set up the tags accordingly, then quickly pressed the button, watching as the view count went from 0 to 100 in a matter of seconds, and kept increasing with each second that passed.
Cas pulled Dean from out of his mouth but not completely, no he left the tip between his lips as he sucked around the edges, "fucking hell." Cas pulled off of Dean, rising to his feet and pushing Dean so that his back was against the wall, "I'm gonna fuck you now." The next three hours was spent with heavy breathing, soft gasps, loud moans, back scratching, and Dean spread out all over Cas' bed. Cas was panting heavily as he pushed himself inside of Dean's primed hole, causing Dean to whine, truly he felt like a bottom whore, which typically he wasn't. This entire experience was all new terrain for Dean, who prided himself in being a solid dominant top. But Cas' switched it up, using his hole like he was a filthy slut, and Dean loved every second of it.
Dean had spent the past 4 months high on life, enjoying the simple pleasures of giving every man and woman in every bar the best time of their lives. He had men in his hotel room, women in his bed, and alcohol in his system, all day everyday a party. Dean hadn't had a single thought of Cas, his feelings gone almost completely.
Hello Dean"
"look I don't know what you want from me Dean but I really don't have it in me to have my time wasted." Dean stepped back slightly as he bit back his sudden urge to smack the man sitting in front of him. "You think that's what I'm here to do?" Cas went to say something but he paused, looking away from Dean, then he shook his head at him, "honestly Dean I don't know what to think." Dean took a long deep breath before he sat down next to Cas. " You know what I think? I think you have this idea in your head, that I'm going to just be this fling for you and that this will end bad." Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean, then he scoffed, "what does that mean, hm?' Sighing heavily, Dean set the bottle back on the table, angling his body toward Cas, "I think you know, Cas"
Cas glared at Dean, taking a deep breath,
Over the months that Lucifer spent torturing and giving orders never once was there any mention of the Winchesters and it sent Castiel into a depression. He would spend hours upon hours creating scenarios in his mind of his rescue from the grasps of Satan. Castiel even thought it to be quite ironic that an angel allow the devil to enter his vessel, given that he was a servant of heaven and well Lucifer was the Prince of hell.
"Hey, it's okay, shhh you're safe."
"Just... Cas please, say something.."
He turned, smiling slightly and arching his eyebrow, "Bianca, how are you love?"
Dean didn't pay attention to the rest of the broadcast, he just kept popping beer after beer until he couldn't feel his own skin. He didn't deserve Cas, but somehow he still felt that he was responsible for making things right. He couldn't leave him like this, after all there was a connection between them and no matter how much Dean tried to deny it, he felt it.
"Dean...."
might have to pay
, "so I'm just a stop on the way?" Dean took a deep breath, shrugging his shoulders, "Look I'm sorry Cas have a job I need to do...and I don't even know why I'm explaining myself to you." Normally Cas would have been angry by the way that Dean was speaking to him, but by this point the alcohol began taking its effect on him so he slapped his hand through the air as if he was shooing Dean, "well...then go on and do your job."
Once Lucifer arrived at the bunker Dean began explaining things to him, things he didn't understand. Castiel was really the one who knew anything but there was no way Lucifer was going to risk letting him out from where he was buried in the depths of the vessel mind. No Lucifer would deal with this on his own. With stealthy vigilance and careful planning he could keep up the Castiel facade.
"I know you guys have been asking for me to come see you all, and I will. It'll just take time, I've got a busy schedule, what with trying to balance work and keeping you entertained."
Glancing down at the plate of food sitting in front of him, Dean took the fork into his hand and scooped some food onto it, puts it into his mouth, and his eyes go wide in surprise. "Wow this is actually very delicious." Cas was gently biting his bottom lip as he watched Dean, then he began eating his own food. Not much conversation went on between them as they ate, mostly Dean making satisfied grunts as he finished his food. "Would you like something to drink?" Cas was looking at Dean curiously when Dean lifted his head to look at him, "I've got this wine that I really favor, if you don't mind....." Raising his eyebrow at Cas, Dean shrugged his shoulders; if he was being completely honest with himself, he actually just preferred beer but he wasn't going to complain. "Yeah sure, I'll have some." Cas grabbed a napkin from the holder, wiped his mouth and pushed away from the table, "I'll be right back."
Cas cocked his head to the side as he looked at Dean, shrugging his shoulders, "I don't see why not, it is a shortened version of my name. My brother Gabriel calls me Cassie."
"No, Mary, it isn't. I caught that son of yours," her hand was shaking as she pointed her bony finger at the boy behind Mary, "with his hands all over my boy, they were kissing."
want to meet the snake that had laid eggs this big.
Sam insisted Dean mark himself with some generalised anti-enchantment sigils, which… Dean admitted wasn’t the worst idea in the world. He had to duck into Baby to collect the egg from where it was still stored in the glovebox, anyway, so he took an extra second to pull out a penknife and carve what Sam instructed into the flesh of his arms.

A quick surveillance with his flashlight showed the space was at least twenty feet deep, maybe ten high. Dean was some six feet tall, and he could reach a hand up and still not touch the ceiling – a startling difference after the tunnel he had just forced himself through.
It wasn’t disappointing, he decided adamantly. He’d tried it, and it wasn’t really for him – there was no shame in that. All he had to do was withdraw his finger, finish his shower, and pretend none of this had ever –
-cited, amirite?”
“It’s the truth, Dean,” Cas shook his head, knocking a couple of tears loose in the process. “And you still refuse to see it.”
That immediately seemed to peak Cas’s attention. “You found something?”
“No!” Cas shook his head quickly, defensively, but then his shoulders slumped. “… Grindr.”
about banging him.”
“The house,” he replied immediately. “It has to be, right? It’s close, and it – I would have seen some giant freaking bird carrying him away.”
, brave angel.
– as he’d stared into the furious eyes of his father, and he still believed that was true; he was attracted to women, and he always would be. But when he really thought about it – when he allowed himself to think back to just how much his heart had fluttered when Drew’s mouth had been on his, and now, how Cas’s smile made him weak in the knees – he realised he couldn’t really deny it any longer.
Dean had done nothing. He’d readjusted the popcorn so it balanced on Drew’s legs, taken another (cautious) sip of the beer, and had passed it back. The movie started to play, but he hadn’t really been paying attention – too caught up in the weight of Drew’s legs across his own, and how unusually good it felt. Two hours passed in a blur, the two of them exchanging the occasional quip as they passed the beer back and forth between them, and Dean had found himself somewhat bereft when the doorbell finally rang and Drew disappeared to let the girls in.
on my plate.”
“Huh.”
Before getting up, Dean dared to drop a kiss on Castiel’s forehead. The angel hummed in content, and Dean smiled against his skin. Then, with no small regret, he pulled away and got back to work.
“Dean?”
And then one of the guys on the video moaned, pitched low in his chest, and Dean’s eyes flicked, unbidden, to the screen. They were both very tanned, he noticed first. Mostly hairless, too.
“Well, we initially thought it might be a vampire or djinn, right?” Sam continued, and Dean hummed his agreement. “Didn’t sound like the traditional descriptions, but then I went hunting for any off-shoots that might be a better fit. Didn’t find anything all day, but then an hour ago this book surfaced in the
Cas nodded again, ear brushing Dean’s cheek, and Dean studiously ignored how good it felt. Instead, he focused on helping Cas draw the cue back, and only reluctantly let go to take a step back when he was completely ready. Cas stayed down, pressed against the table, and made his shot; the cue ball hit its intended target dead on, and it shot directly into the pocket with a satisfying crack.
“And?” Dean asked, attention piqued.
Dean could just imagine the contented smile on Cas’s face as he’d petted the dog, and it made his heart ache in his chest. Speaking to them with the expectation of receiving a coherent answer aside (which… Dean had actually never thought about – could angels speak dog?), Cas was always gentle with animals. Kids, too. Hell, he was just gentle, full stop, and it sometimes awed Dean how much restraint it must take him on a daily basis as a
“I don’t think it would be appropriate to exchange pictures of our genitalia in such a public setting –“
Dean and Cas are forced into another conversation about feelings, and Dean finds himself falling further into confusion while taking a (rather steamy) shower.
“Well, maybe if you didn’t sleep ‘til noon every day you might start to notice a little more of what goes on around here,” Sam rolled his eyes.
“I’m not going to apologise for wanting you to go back to being friends again,” Sam cut him off firmly, and Dean sighed.
The room was exactly as gaudy as he had expected. The green and purple wallpaper auto-triggered his gag reflex, and he had to take a deep breath of stale air to sooth himself. There was no kitchenette, no extra chairs or a table, and barely even a wardrobe, which stood without doors in one corner. The bed itself didn’t seem horrendous, until Cas perched on the end of it and grimaced at the pushback from the mattress.
He stepped away from them with another quick nod, already pressing the phone to his ear. Cas picked up on the third ring.
“Unexpected?” the girl finished for him, and all he could do was nod and stare up at the ceiling. “Well, I’m sure you’ll find a way to repay me.”
“You’re coming, right?” he’d asked, voice quiet as the girls continued to bicker beside them. “I was actually thinking, if you show up a little early, we could watch Raiders of the Lost Ark before the girls arrive?”
“Because I know you wouldn’t make up a fake case just to force me and Cas into spending more time together,” he continued, and was met with a very telling silence on the other end of the phone.
Sure enough, Dean had only just closed the door behind them when the first crackle of thunder echoed in the distance. There was no rain – not yet – but that didn’t mean it wasn’t coming, and he breathed a sigh of relief, knowing they had at least missed the worst of it.
Dean took a deep breath and let it out again. He was still a little shaky, and his exhaustion was beginning to make itself known again, but it didn’t feel like his chest was about to catch on fire anymore. He took another breath, just to be sure, and that settled him even further.
And so, suddenly very alone, Dean slunk back to their miraculously still empty booth and bedded down by the window, consciously not glancing across the bar to see how it was going. He heard Cas laugh, distinct against the other raised voices, and that was all he needed to know.
think about what they could have been doing to warrant an angel of the lord passing out afterwards, and instead focused on banishing the hard lump that was settling in the pit of his stomach.
He made himself move after that, and forced his hand away from where it had been plain
“You…” Dean’s heart was still doing funny things in his chest. “You ordered it without tomato?”
. Watch what I do.”
Dean glanced around them, at the scorched ground and felled trees, the cracked rocks and residual smell of ozone drifting past on the breeze, and realised he had absolutely no idea what the hell they were dealing with.
as bad once the worst of the blood had been washed away. Sure, housekeeping was going to have a fit when they came to find the towels in the morning, but Dean had already planned for them to be checked out by first light anyway. The wound at Castiel’s side was no longer bleeding, but hot to the touch - a sign that infection was already beginning to set in. His back was better, but the wounds – where smaller – were deeper, and still weeping. He thought momentarily of going back to his bag, fishing out the half bottle of whiskey he knew was stashed in there. It’d be a quick way to disinfect the wounds for sure, but… looking up at Castiel’s face, he decided against it. Dark bags had painted themselves under Cas’s eyes, and a sheen of sweat covered his knitted, pallid brow. He hid his pain as well as it seemed he was able, but Dean could still see it in his eyes, threatening to spill out at any moment.
,” he continued, voice a little higher than he would have liked. “I potted a ball, so I get another turn.”
“Yeah.”
, dammit.
He was met with silence for a moment, and was already beginning to form some kind of excuse when Cas replied, “Talk? About what?”
They stood in silence for a moment, breathing in the brisk evening air. Dean knew Cas was just as troubled by what they had found as he was – could see it clear as day on his handsome face. They needed to figure this out, and
The others cheered, voices echoing in the chilly air, and Dean had grinned like a fool.
“Okay,” he sighed, and flicked through a few of the papers in front of them. “What else? Anything interesting?”
, was not on hook-up apps, and he didn’t bring strangers back to their bunker to hit and quit. It just couldn’t be true.
They were only a couple of hours out by the time Baby started to splutter, so Dean pulled into the next Gas-N-Sip he could find for a refuel. Cas went inside to stretch his legs with strict instructions to pick up a couple of their least anaemic-looking hotdogs and whatever soda had the most sugar in it; meanwhile, Dean swiped his card to fill the tank.
, and Dean hadn’t realised until right that second how much the thought of Sam finding out had been weighing on him. He’d known, logically, that Sam had no reason to care who Dean was attracted to, but to actually hear it felt entirely different.
Again, sorry. Hope this one makes up for it!
But Sam, ever the pragmatist, barely paused for breath before replying, annoyed, “Well,
. All at once, Dean realised the air around them was beginning to shimmer, the creature in front of them a mangled amalgamation of beast and human, bird and man.
And so, he had to step back.

Dean, having been about to try and jimmy himself through the hole, paused. “Are you telling me there might be a bear in there?”
“I’m not very charming,” was, of all things, what Cas decided to say.
, and a craving for more, for
No small talk it was, then.
Hope you enjoyed the cliffhanger :D
“Okay, stay there,” he instructed, clambering to his feet.
Dean, in the midst of his meltdown, had accidentally prayed to Cas. He closed his eyes for a moment and squeezed them so tightly together that he saw spots behind his eyelids, and had to take another couple of deep breaths before he could speak again – before he could even begin to form a cohesive thought.
The waitress excused herself with a squeak, quickly disappearing through an employee door that Dean assumed led to the kitchen. He imagined the whole staff would be aware of what had just happened within a couple of minutes, and had to rub a hand over his aching eyes to try and stave off the start of a stress headache.
“You… suggested he go over and talk to him,” Sam echoed quietly, then, “
Dean paused for a moment, touched by Cas’s concern. It was unwarranted, of course – Dean could definitely handle himself – but it still felt nice to know someone cared about his wellbeing. Not a lot of people did.
“You were a long time,” Cas murmured, eyes not leaving whatever he was looking at on his phone.
of this situation. “Must have been the morning after –“
“Right.”
“Dominic queried my willingness to be filmed during our initial conversation,” Cas continued, oblivious as ever. “I had no qualms, about that, or him publishing it.”
“You… texted him?” Sam asked, barely able to hide his smirk now. “You text?”
Cas deserved better than that.
It was barely mid-afternoon by the time they settled back into the motel room, but Dean already felt like he’d gone a couple rounds against a sledgehammer. While Cas dragged one of the bedside tables to the bottom of the bed in order to act as a research station, Dean dropped onto the mattress and found himself drooping back against the lumpy pillows. God, he was exhausted. His brain was pounding an agonising heartbeat against his skull, and after a moment he had to shut his eyes to try and stave off the migraine he knew was coming for just a little while longer.
The video that he definitely hadn’t gone back and watched the entirety of. The video he hadn’t paused right as Cas had climaxed just to jerk off all over himself. He wouldn’t do that, because Cas was his best friend, and he’d already decided he wasn’t going to think about any of it. Besides, he didn’t come over gay porn because he wasn’t gay.
“About an hour ago,” Davis replied, eyes wide.
Dean’s brain short-circuited. He was aware, dimly, that he was kissing back, and it was
No, he would do this the proper way.

He couldn’t help but think, as concrete fell away and he dropped into the brush beyond, that he was walking directly into a trap. It was actually the only thing stopping him from breaking into an immediate sprint; instead, he forced himself to take even strides, forced his breath to match them, and set his gaze on the slowly approaching house.
His hand curled around the cold metal of the lighter, and he didn’t even think before flicking it open and jerking the flamethrower up, right into the waiting path of the beautiful, monstrous man – only to feel all the air leave him at once as he was thrown bodily across the room by an invisible wall of force, immediately knocking the lighter far away from his hand. His head connected first, sending him into a moment of complete, dizzying silence, immediately followed by a sick crunching noise as the rest of his body smacked into the wall. He grunted, momentarily confused by the warm, wet trickle he felt at his side, only to gasp aloud when his eyes focused and he realised what had happened.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do.”
“Dean?” Cas called suddenly, and when Dean looked up, he realised he had disappeared back through the door.
once I know you don’t have extra holes in you.”
“Good,” he managed, and had to swallow a couple of times before he moved closer again. “Now, your eyes want to be on where the ball is going, not on the cue. You line it up right, it’ll hit the ball no matter what.”
“Yes, sir,” he’d managed to reply, voice high and panicked. “I’m not – Dad, I’m not –“
“No, it’s not,” Dean replied firmly, more than ready to be done with this whole situation. He snagged Cas by the back of the trench coat when it looked like he was going to lean back towards the counter, and used his other hand to slap his card down in front of them. “Just run my card.”
“Well,” Paxton hummed. “Maybe? There aren’t tonnes of bears around here, but we’ve had a few sightings. Judging by the size, it’s more likely you’re gonna find a pissed off mama raccoon and a bunch of hungry babies attempting to hibernate.”
“You don’t – you have
“You’ll get cold,” Cas insisted, even as he was already moving the covers out from under Dean.
OH BOY imagine reading nearly 40k words of a fic that you've been told updates regularly, getting to the first big cliff-hanger of the thing, and then watching in horror as the author takes an unannounced, month long hiatus hahaha imagine how fucking angry you'd be...
“Yes,” Cas agreed, oblivious to what was going on in Dean’s head, “and I just got off the phone with the Coroner’s office – they’ve confirmed there’s no evidence to suggest the bodies were ever fully submerged in water.”
“I took photos,” he hummed instead, sipping at his beer. “Could send them to Rowena, see if she has any ideas how to clear it all out.”

thing Dean wanted; Cas must have realised the same thing, because he glanced down with a deep frown when he caught whatever emotions must have been playing out across Dean’s face.
“What do you mean?”
Drew was taller than him by at least three inches, and not nearly as stocky. He’d opted, that day, to wear a thick green sweater that brought out the flecks of hazel in his brown eyes, and he hadn’t bothered to style his hair; it hung in loose, golden curls across his forehead, and had reminded Dean, for just a moment, of a halo. He had a way about him, a quiet confidence that Dean wasn’t used to seeing in kids his own age, as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Dean had supposed he didn’t – at least, not in comparison with himself – but it was still strange to witness first-hand.
Each day, after school, he’d pick Sammy up and they’d walk back to Bobby’s house. A couple days a week, they’d stop in at the local market, and Dean would let Sammy pick out some candy with the money Bobby had insisted on paying him for helping out at the ‘shop on weekends. Sometimes, they’d pick up pizza, or pie for dessert, to save Bobby from having to cook. It was nice.
“For most of the night!” Dean defended, and had to run a hand over his eyes; his headache was coming back, too. “We got dinner, played some pool while I waited on some intel from Rowena, and then this guy started making eyes at Cas from across the bar. It wasn’t like we could do any more for the case tonight, so I suggested he go over and talk to him. How was I supposed to know that was our guy?”
And that… he wasn’t a
? Sam had been under the impression that he had been… bringing people home for a while. Had Dean really been so blind the entire time? A pang of guilt shot through his gut – had he really paid so little attention to Cas that he had missed this whole facet of his existence?
“No, I’m –“
“Flirting is much easier on the phone,” Cas frowned, and Dean hated the way it pulled his whole face down.
“Of course,” Drew had huffed, faux-affronted. “What do you take me for?”
, Sam. He always had to point out the glaringly obvious things that Dean seemed to still somehow miss. He was too smart for his own good, that kid.
“Good to know,” Dean nodded his head, body bristling with adrenaline. “Okay, I’ll call if none of that works.”
Cas was allowed to blow off a little steam – it wasn’t exactly like Sam and Dean were saints when it came to casual relationships, after all – but Dean was having a whole lot of trouble wrapping his head around the fact that Cas blew off steam
“There you go!” Dean called, grinning proudly. “That was great!”
“Holy shit,” Dean murmured, before daring to ask, “And… the fourth victim? They connected to the house, too?”
“Don’t want to start too strong,” he’d shrugged, collapsing onto the couch beside Dean. “The girls will probably want to play drinking games.”
“Did you at least pet him?” Dean asked, smile gentler now. “Or just question his qualifications?”
“And why would I do that?”
They were no closer to figuring out just what the hell was going on – that much was clear. They had four dead bodies, freak weather, electric-shock eggs, and now a dead witch that may or may not be harbouring a grudge from beyond the grave. Some of the stuff he had seen in the cellar suggested
“No, I’m – it’s fine,” Dean lied quickly, and forced himself to take another deep breath. “You got a reason for calling, or just checking in –?“
Cas levelled him with a distinctly unimpressed look, and then pulled the laptop towards himself again. He brought up a local map in a new browser tab, and quickly pointed to an area of open land on the outskirts of town.
“Cas,” Dean replied, trying to hide the relief in his voice. “Where the hell are you, man? Sam’s found us a case –“
Dean didn’t even try to hide his sigh of relief. “Doesn’t matter, just… I’m all in my head right now, man, and I just need you to –“
A soft moan immediately drew his attention, drifting through the stale air from the bedroom up ahead, and Dean found himself moving before he’d even made the conscious decision to do so. The flamethrower had come to hang against his chest as he’d stumbled, and he snatched it back up as he prowled towards the door, his heart in his throat as he adjusted the strap across his back. He toyed with the lighter in his other hand, every muscle in his body coiled and ready; he edged the door open with his elbow.
“Alright,” he agreed, and ended the call before anything else could be said.
Dean hated how his voice sounded, all tight and raw. He tried to swallow, but it felt sharp in his throat, and he almost choked before he could force another breath into his lungs. Distantly, he was aware that his cheeks were wet, but he made no effort to wipe the tears from his face.
Dean pulled his gun out of his belt, and rolled his eyes when Paxton opened her mouth in a horrified gasp.
“This might hurt,” he apologised in advance, moving the towel closer to the deepest part of the wound. “I’m sorry, okay? I have to clean it out.”
, with bright blue eyes and a kind smile. Ten years ago, he would have noticed immediately, turned the charm on, and got her back to his motel room faster than a dog with a bone. Hell, if she’d been game, he probably would have railed her against a tree – he’d had sex in weirder places.

“You’re better at this than you’re letting on,” he huffed, failing spectacularly at sounding annoyed. “Making me pull out all my best moves.”
“Don’t you
swore like that – not even when all seemed lost, or he was in agony. It was something to behold, Dean realised as his pants began to tighten a little, to hear him blaspheme so viscerally.
“Actually, do you think I have time for a shower?” Cas asked, a blush creeping back up his neck. “I’m a little –“
“You sure about that?” Sam asked softly. “Feels nice to have a verbal confirmation every once in a while.”
“I won’t be long,” he called over his shoulder.
Something in his tone seemed off. Dean knew his little brother well enough to know when he was being lied to, and Sammy was definitely hiding something from him.
That feeling had soon disappeared, however, under the crushing excitement the girls dragged into the house with them. They’d both dressed up, putting Drew and Dean to shame, and were toting enough snacks to feed a small army as they bounced through the door.
That earned him a particularly delicious squeeze of her hand and a filthy kiss that he felt right down to his toes.
“That was, truly, a fantastic attempt,” Dean grinned as he shuffled back, and laughed again when Cas shot him a glare. “No, I’m serious! That went, what? Three, four feet?”
That piqued Dean’s interest, and he felt the tension in his body starting to dissipate a little bit as he asked, “Yeah? What kind of something?”
?” he couldn’t help but hiss into the dark, clutching the coat close to him for just a second before letting it drop back to the floor.
His eyes were shining in the light of the laptop screen, crinkling at the corners like they did only when he was genuinely happy. His smile, which Dean had always thought was pretty goofy, pulled his whole face up, made him seem younger than usual.
Dean Winchester wasn’t gay – he wanted that fact to be very explicitly known. The thought would never have even crossed his mind if that chick – Sandra, or Sarah, or something like that – hadn’t suggested it while she’d had her hands down his pants (and, surely, there was actually nothing
“What are we looking for?”
seen it bent like in the thumbnail before), but it had to be a freak coincidence. There was no way it could actually be Cas.
Sam didn’t press, though whether it was because he just didn’t have the strength to think about it too hard, or simply that he pitied Dean, he didn’t know. Instead, he peered cautiously back down at the screen and scrolled for a moment, seemingly checking for something.
He was
“What… what do you mean?” he managed, breath still a little claggy in his throat.
Sam hummed non-committedly, but didn’t argue with him.
“It took Cas,” Dean managed to get out, voice like sandpaper in his mouth.
“You’re a lucky guy,” he murmured, glancing up at Cas with a tight smile. “You’re getting the five-star treatment, here, buddy.”
“Cas,” he started immediately. “I know you’re busy, I’m sorry, but Sam figured it out and I need you to –“
“And the murders started after that,” Sam hummed, almost to himself.
“Shit,” he gasped, barely enough air making it into his suddenly heaving lungs. “
was obviously a local favourite; there was no way such a dive could have survived without being. Dean left Cas at the bar to place their order, grimacing at how his shoes stuck to the floor when he moved, and quickly found them a booth by the window. He’d always judged the quality of a bar by the seating – probably stupidly, he was aware – and as he sat down, he couldn’t help but frown.
. “Are you… on
was interesting.
“Yeah,” Dean hummed, not really sure what else to say. “So, we… my immediate thought is vengeful spirit, right? Dead old lady going after all the people who wronged her when she was alive? And then the girl who desecrated her grave?”
But, of course, he wasn’t thinking about it.
The creature’s face soured, but even burning with a vicious fury, he was still impossibly, unfairly beautiful.
put shit in your mouth, got it?”
All at once, his skin felt too tight around his bones, and the car was entirely too small, and he had to get out, get away, find somewhere he could
Lilah had been first, sidling up to him during second period science after the teacher had called for everybody to find a lab partner. She’d dumped her books on the bench beside him, flicked her dark, messy hair out of her face, and flashed him a dazzling smile that he couldn’t help, in his shock, but return.
Cas, when he risked a peek, was staring blankly at him, cue hanging loose in one hand.
. What a fucking loser, taping himself banging someone. Banging
, or anything. Sure, the guy had the kind of dark, flawless skin you’d usually only see on airbrushed models, and his hair was pulled back into delicate, intricate cornrows ending in a top knot that, on anyone else (Sammy), Dean would have made fun of. On this guy, it only served to show off his chiselled cheekbones and dark, piercing eyes.
Without another word, he hung up, leaving Dean alone in the empty parking lot.
He didn’t do that now.
“Hold still,” he murmured apologetically as Cas continued to gasp pitifully on the mattress. “I know it hurts, buddy, I know, but your grace leaks out faster when you’re moving.“
“Oh, dude…” Dean flashed his best shit-eating grin as he reached into his pocket and fished out a handful of sticky membrane and blood-red shell. “Guess you got a little too
“That’s not even the worst part,” Sam sighed. “You said Gloria was dead, right?”
Cas whimpered again, wrist trembling against Dean’s fingers as he fiddled with the lock, but didn’t say anything else as he forced his breath to even out and his body to still.
So much for having settled things between them.
Cas paused for a moment. “Even though it’s just been found?”
Well,
He got back to his feet and went back to the bathroom, filling a glass he found in the medicine cabinet with cold water. Castiel was exactly where he had left him as he walked back to the bedroom, so he placed the water on the bedside table and crouched at his feet again, hands going back to the first aid kit.
Reaching into his pocket, Dean pulled his phone out and quickly sent the photos, along with a quick explanatory message, to the number he had saved under Rowena’s name. It was getting late, and she kept strange hours, so he wasn’t expecting an immediate response; he dropped his phone onto the surface of the table between him and Cas, and then glanced out of the window. The light was fading fast now, but he could still just about make out the silhouette of Gloria’s house in the distance, imposing even so far away.
, as the people say –“
, Dean could admit that Cas was a good-looking dude, but he didn’t have to be gay to see that. Was it really so wrong of him to want to protect his best friend, new to the ways of the world (though not, apparently, as new as Dean had originally thought), from getting hurt?
“You know,” Dean sighed, laying the hurt in his voice on real thick. “If you didn’t want to do this hunt with me, you could have just told me –“
“Hear that, Dean?” Sam asked, voice innocent, though his eyes gave away his mirth. “He’s been picking up tricks from his lovers.”
“Honestly?” he murmured once he was sure they were all occupied with something else. “Damned if I have the slightest clue.”
"You said your name is Dean, I like that name."
Cas smiled slightly letting his head fall to the left slightly so that he could glance at the clock on the bedside table, "well, it's 8:30 in the morning, which means that I slept for about 6 hours, which is more than I've had in a while now." Turning his attention back to Dean, Cas reached his hand up slowly, gently running his thumb over Dean's lip, "thank you so much for staying the night Dean, it's feels like it's been forever since I have had someone here in bed with me." Dean pushed himself up slightly so that he was sitting and he placed his hand on Cas' chest.
Dean looked so beautiful beneath Cas, even being a whining pile of moans, Cas enjoyed the sight, "you look a wreck Dean." The words escaped Cas' mouth as a growl as he finally reached his climax, releasing inside of Dean, the sudden release forcing  the cum to gush from Dean's hole. Dean allowed himself to relax after his own release, relaxing his arms from their previous state of gripping the bedding in his fists. Dean propped himself up on his elbows, Cas hadn't moved from being inside of him, but he leaned down cupping Dean's face in his hands as he looked into his eyes, "thank you for this Dean." he gently brushed his lips against Dean's, the skin of his lips tender from when Dean sucked his lips so hard as Cas pounded into him.
He closed out of the live screen seconds after he ended it but his chat was still going nuts, so many hungry potentials. He could respond to them, he could shoot any one of them a message and have someone in his bed in a matter of seconds, but they were not what he wanted, and it confused him. Pulling up the profile, he looked into those blue eyes, the sadness in them, the purity.
Cas sat up slowly reaching out for his laptop, lifting the screen up. The live had ended but there was a message for him in his private chat, so he pulled up the chat looking at it.
Debating whether or not he wanted to do a live cam show or not, Dean pulled his shirt up over his head discarding it to the floor. He sat down on the bed, laying back with his arms extended to the sides as he exhaled a large sigh. Suddenly he heard a ding on his laptop, a sound he had grown used to now since he became a sex worker. It was a last resort really, his choice, because he had exhausted all other forms of work due to his shit attitude and constant narcissistic personality. But Dean didn't care, he had the luxury of sex whenever he wanted. All he had to do was post an ad and people would be lining up to do him, for a price of course.
***3 weeks later***
"Money, Cas.....now."
Cas didn't respond with words he just stepped back, standing behind the door as he held it open. Dean walked into the house, slipping his shoes off at the front door, then he turned to face Cas, who closed the door but didn't move from where he was standing. "You're upset," still Cas didn't speak as he folded his arms across his chest, a hard expression on his face. "Look Cas, I don't know what I'm doing right now okay, this...." he gestured to Cas and everything else, "it's new to me, these new feelings, it...it's just strange okay, I haven't had time to adjust." Cas could sense a slight desperation in Dean's words, which kind of made him feel a little guilty, Dean didn't technically owe him anything.
The client gave Dean the time of 7:00 pm and also sent the address a few seconds after the message was received, which caught him completely off guard. Usually clients chose to meet up somewhere like a restaurant or somewhere public, none ever gave him a direct address; still Dean made a note of the address in his phone and one more message came through before the client signed off.
"You're wrong," Cas replied, staring into Dean's eyes, the sudden rush he felt slowly creeping up on him, "this won't end badly because it's not going to end Dean, I won't let it." Closing the space between them, as he moved closer to Dean on the couch, Cas reached his hand out touching Dean's. "Cas, honestly I don't want it to end badly either. I have lived a life where I was free to do whomever I wanted, however I saw fit but now..." Dean trailed off, taking Cas' hand into his, "now, what?" Cas swallowed harshly as Dean looked away from him, biting his lip gently between his teeth, "now I don't know Cas, I have all of these new emotions when before all that I really wanted to do was fuck until I was numb. Now when I'm here all of it goes away, that desire disappears almost completely."
Once he made it back to the motel, after he parked his car, he walked to the door,  grabbed the keys from his pocket and started to unlock the door.
Castiel inhales softly, turning his head away from Dean, he didn't want everything to come back -- wanting life to remain as it was. Besides, it wasn't as if Dean showing up changed a thing, he was still broken and damaged -- knowing the only reason he was able to function was a false sense of security within his clients. Drown yourself in sex, drugs, and booze, never feel anything.
He couldn't tell you why but Dean Winchester was back on the road, never having gone back to the same town more than once. But it was different this time, he was different this time, his purpose being something other than a good hookup. He cut 5 hours down to 3 and made it to town just before the sun came up.
Dean shrugged his shoulders as he glanced around the room, his eyes stopping as they reached the open door. There, standing in the doorway, was a young boy about his age, he was staring at Dean curiously. His hair was touseled, falling in front of his eyes, he wore a small trench coat that was a little big for him. Dean smiled softly as he waved at the boy and the boy laughed in response.
*3 months later*
"I can not believe that you are my son Castiel. After all that I've given to you, this is how you repay me? By sleeping in the same bed with a boy?" Chuck lifted his hand and swung it forward until it made contact with Castiel's cheek causing the 8 year old to whimper and look down at the floor. "I....I'm sorry fathe-"
Cas stared innocently at Dean, still unmoving, still not speaking, and Dean looked away for a brief moment.
"May I come in?" Cas hesitated briefly as he looked at Dean,
"Well technically, we live here, but this is a sanctuary Dean....for children abandoned by their families...." she trailed off her words as Dean's expression changed and he began crying. She felt the pain deeply of the child in front of her. She leaned forward, extending her arms toward him, and without hesitation Dean jumped into her arms, his body shaking as he sobbed into her embrace.
"You're Castiel right? I'm Dean."
But it wasn't.
Cas gripped the top of Dean's boxers, tugging them down his thighs and toward his ankles, Dean's length springing from confinement. Dropping to his knees, and sitting back on his heels, Cas skillfully takes Dean's length into his hand, stroking lightly at first, then picking up speed, glancing up as he does. Dean allowed his eyes to flutter shut at this point, as Cas worked his finger magic, "I want you to moan for me Dean." As soon as the words left his mouth, Cas moved his hand, replacing his touch with his mouth, sucking Dean down his throat, "oh
2 hours later a knock came at the Winchesters door. It was their neighbour from across the street and she looked angry as Mary answered the door, with Dean rushing in past her.
Cas would be waking up right about now and Dean had parked in front of his house like some creep, waiting for him to come out. Maybe if he could explain himself in person Cas would understand, or maybe not and he came all this way for nothing. But he had to try, he needed to see that angel face one last time, even if Cas forgave him Dean wasn't sure that he would be down to have him around anymore. After all, he did just disappear for months without a word to Cas, not that the strapping young man gave him a second thought after the first two weeks anyway but it still meant something to him.
He felt regret in his decision and realistically he didn't see himself doing this for the long haul, just something to pass the time and temporarily fill the void. That was his plan, his intention, and nothing would change his mind; until that fateful morning, Dean Winchester on his porch step looking rather rugged, but just as sexy as he remembered.
Dean looked at Lucifer his eyes a deep green with little specks of yellow in them, "Cas?" Lucifer dropped his hand looking at Dean and shrugs his shoulders. "I'm fine." Dean's expression was deeply concerned but at the same time you could detect a slight enjoyment when Lucifer touched his cheek. Dean continued on and Lucifer was content with listening to him speak. As soon as Dean was finished talking, he stepped toward Lucifer with a seductive expression.
Eventually it had gotten to a point where Castiel created a safe haven inside the vessel, so that whenever Lucifer relentlessly wrought havoc on whomever was closest, Castiel could retreat into the solitude of his mind's personal heaven.
Lucifer disappeared, along with Castiel. Everyone assumed that Cas was sent away when Luci was sent back to the cage, the light whisking him away into nothing. Everyone accepted it, Dean allowed himself to feel the pain, Sam tried to comfort his brother whenever he could whilst also dealing with his own memories of his previous cage encounter with Lucifer. Rowena of course vanished once the warding holding Lucifer failed completely and her spell was complete. Crowley remained in hell to maintain the demons and keep things under control.
Dean stared lustfully at Cas' lips, his mouth open slightly as he listened to the raspy words escape this beautiful man's lips, "yes.....but..."
Smiling wickedly, Lucifer leans in,  as if he were going to kiss her but instead he reaches up he grabbing her chin. Peering into her eyes, which are full of desire, and one swift movement of his wrist he twists her head to the side breaking her neck. Her body falls limp to the floor and Lucifer looks up at Crowley.
. Dean carefully moved off of the bed standing up to stretch then turned back to look at Cas. "Where is the bathroom?" Cas lifted his arm toward the a door by the closet with a small smile on his lips, and Dean couldn't help but smile back at him, "yeah thanks for the help." Dean grabbed the pillow next to Cas, then gently threw it into Cas' face, and he turned to walk out of the room.
"Speak for yourself."
. He didn't realize it but Castiel had extended his hand out toward him, which he only noticed because he needed to shift in the chair. Glancing down at his hand, Dean placed his own hand into Castiel's, "nice to meet you....would it be alright if I just called you Cas?" Dean watched Castiel's face as he asked the question, and Castiel actually smiled, then nodded his head.
By this point everyone had discovered "Castiel" to be alive and thus Lucifer began imitating the angel. No one knew the truth, except he and Castiel so it wasn't difficult to fool them all.
The voice was female, gentle, almost motherly and Dean was drawn to it instantly. He tried to move his arms but they had been tied down, which wouldn't have been such an issue if he could see. Panic set in almost instantly as Dean struggled against the restraints, but being only about 60 lbs it didn't really have much of an effect.
forget.
But that didn't change anything the competition was still there and, though Dean had never seen his face, there was always that reminder that he existed. They were always on at different times so the chance of Dean ever catching him streaming was very low. Not to mention the guy had a basic profile, leaving nothing for him to go off of so Dean sat in front of his laptop, and leaned back, completely stumped.
"Dean....please" he spoke softly, then slowly turned around to look at Dean, letting his hand fall to his side, "I realize that you have these feelings but.....we can figure something out can't we?"
Call it a moment of weakness, or the alcohol but once the cast had ended Dean was in Cas' chat.
. Starting up the car, Dean glanced at the front door and Cas was standing there, watching as he pulled away from the house. It was time for Dean to move on to the next town, this was too much, Dean Winchester doesn't date, he doesn't feel romantic feelings or any feelings, except maybe desire, but most definitely he doesn't care about anyone. Yes it was definitely time to move on to the next town, a place where Cas was not, so he went back to the motel, packed up his clothing and everything else he brought with him. He went and paid Bianca one last time and Dean Winchester was off on the road, to the next city where he would start completely over.
Bianca snorted at Dean, folding her arms across her chest, "I'll be better when you pay, eh?"
feel good, he wanted to make
. Cas gently bit his lip and turned to walk into his kitchen, Dean watching as he goes, then he follows behind him, stopping in the entry. He leans against the frame watching as Cas prepares all of the food. "You don't have to stand there, there is a kitchen table right there." Cas doesn't turn around as he says this and Dean glared at him, he didn't like to be told what to do. Reluctantly Dean moved to sit in a chair resting his arms on the table.
Dean, of course, did not stay the night with Cas. Despite everything he felt during their little adventure in the bedroom, Dean honestly believed it was just his desire to fuck Cas, that was it. So once Cas fell asleep, Dean slipped out of his bed grabbing up his clothing as he went downstairs putting them on as he went. At the front door Dean quickly slipped his shoes on and walked out the front door closing it behind him. Then Dean went on back to the motel room, entering the room and shutting the door behind him. He had not a care in the world as he threw himself on the bed, not bothering to get undressed and he was out within minutes.
If it were not for the fact they had been called for dinner, it is quite possible that Dean and Cas would have spent the entire night talking about their likes and dislikes. Dean discoveing Cas also has an affinity for being unknowingly hilarious, with his basic lack of knowledge for sarcasm, jokes going over his head, and the outright adorable nature of the boy.
After he left, Dean stood up from the table, grabbing up his plate and walks to the sink. He decided that he was going to wash it off, then he set it off to the side and walked out of the kitchen back into the living room. As he walked into the room he looked at the interior, there were pictures everywhere, Dean walked up to the table that was sitting next to the front door. Reaching down, he picked up the frame, holding it in his hands, it was of Cas and another man. He looked so happy in it, he smiled softly as he was looking at it, "that's me and my husband when we went on a trip to Peru." Dean jumped slightly then turned still clutching the picture in his hands, Cas stood in the doorway with two glasses in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other, "I...uh...." he glances down at the picture then carefully sets it back up on the table, then turns back to Cas.
At this point, Dean had been able to get closer to the doorway -- the tip of his boots inches away from Cas' front door step. He truly hadn't known what to expect, he wasn't even sure that Cas would see him, lest he slam the door in his face at the mere sight of him. But when he didn't, when the blue eyed beauty stood there in that doorway stricken with shock at the sight of Dean -- well,  maybe there was a chance, right?
The former king of hell screams out in pain as Lucifer drags him across the floor. He is dragged toward the iron cage that was placed so conveniently against the wall. Lucifer pushes the button, which allows the door to be opened and he tosses the demon into it closing the heavy door then latching it. Once more, Lucifer crouched down with his arm resting atop the cage. He looks into the eyes of his new pet and a large grin spreads across his face. "This is going to be so much fun."
That's when it hit him.
Moments later there was shouting downstairs, and the sound of shattering glass. Instant fear gripped Dean as he hid under his bed, and suddenly loud banging came at his door.
"Cas I wanna take you out."
"What would you like me to say? That I've missed you, that I've spent the last 4 months aching for your return like some damaged housewife?"
"I shouldn't have come here. " Dean speaks softly as he drops his gaze anywhere else but in Cas' direction.
"Hey everyone just wanted to pop on and say hello..." comments flooded the chat, every one basically saying how gorgeous he was, how much they wished he was theirs, and a few commented that he should strip for them. Dean leaned forward as he read the comments, deep inside he secretly hoped that he would see just one from that one user, but it never came. Slight disappointment flooded his chest the longer he stayed on, mostly in himself for even desiring to talk to one of his clients. He didn't do a long broadcast, solely on the fact that he was completely drained, and nothing else.
Lucifer knew it was hurting Castiel but he didn't care because he was the Prince of Hell, as far as he is concerned it's just another day for him and he actually kind of liked it. Almost immediately after he made his move, Dean jumped back so suddenly that it startled Lucifer. He didn't fully realize what had happened until he saw the blood on Dean's lips.
Dean didn't do well around new kids, his main concern being he wouldn't fit in. So rather then force anything on Dean too soon, Anna told him he could hang out in his room and come out to socialize when he felt he was ready.
"I just enjoy the sight of you Dean,"
"I will have a talk with him."
"Yes, and for that I apologize, words could never fix that and I know that, but I am here now asking you to forgive me, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to prove to you."
"Dean, I don't know what is going on, but this, what we are doing it is only for fun, we made that clear. There are no feelings involved I can assure you." Dean scoffed, turning his attention to Cas, then stepping towards him.
Cas leaned forward to set the bottle on the table when there was a knock at his door. Closing his eyes then sighing heavily, Cas stood from the couch, slowly walking to the front door, then pulled the door open. He was looking down when he opened the door so when he lifted his head, he took a step back, surprise on his face, "Dean..." The name slipped off his tongue with a soft tone, as he stared at Dean standing there.
. Lucifer closed his eyes trying to focus on his freedom rather than making conversation with the angel. He shook his head and looked forward breathing deeply until he could no longer sense the angel's presence. This was going to be the greatest thing that's ever happened in Lucifer's life.
And Gabriel did just that, taking his younger brother far from the reaches of their father, never to show himself or Cas anywhere near the house.
. Pushing off of the dresser he went back to the side of the bed where his laptop lay, picking it up from the floor, then he set in on the end table. Within minutes he had set up two meetings and a video chat and for Dean that meant that everything was right in the world.
"Not much of a talker I see."
"I know that I owe you an explanation Cas..."
Turning back to face the angry woman in front of her, Mary sighed heavily, "thank you for bringing him home. I have to go now." Mary closed the door and leaned her forehead against it taking a deep breath before she turned, with her son still standing at the foot of the stairs, "I thought I told you to go upstairs, go now, I can try to calm your father before he gets to you, go on."
There was a point, when Dean first arrived in town, that he had made an offer to make payments in the form of sexual favors to Bianca, she wasn't bad to look at with her nice curves and huge bosom, but she was a total bitch; she had shot him down however, which wasn't such a big deal to Dean, he could literally have any person he desired, and he would much rather use his body as payment than give money that he earned himself.
you know? Like, it fits in with those big words and nice grammar you’re always using.”
There was a pregnant pause, followed by a muffled, “
With a jolting start and no warning, Dean came
“Yes, he’s been watching for a while now,” Cas replied casually, and had Dean… he’d said that out loud.
Dean was sure something was supposed to have happened, because the creature was staring at him with a lecherous smile, but all he felt was a gentle tingling along the lengths of his arms, right over where he had carved the anti-enchantment spells, and everything suddenly clicked into place in his head.
“Hardly,” Cas muttered behind him, and Dean… well.
They’d had to follow the creek a couple of miles before there was a place thin and shallow enough to cross safely. It had then been a trek back the way they’d come on the other side of the embankment, and Dean was starting to think it would have been worth getting wet and cold just to wade through a deeper part of the creek and cut their hike time in half.
house?“ – and he’d jumped a little as Drew slid across their shared bench to bump him gently on the shoulder.
Cas pinned him with a hard expression, and for a moment Dean thought he might snap at him, or scream at him, or simply turn tail and walk away. It made him feel nauseous to think about; this was why he didn’t talk about feelings, dammit.
Cas straightened and turned in the ring Dean had unconsciously made with his arms. His smile, just inches from Dean’s own, was brighter than the sun and infinitely more beautiful. Dean caught himself staring, knew he should probably pull away, but he found he couldn’t quite manage it. Cas glanced down at Dean’s smile, eyelashes fluttering a little, and he’d only have to move a couple of inches to lose the remaining distance between them, to bring their lips together –
Guilt, dark and searing, caught in Dean’s throat and clung there, making it hard to breathe. He hadn’t realised – hadn’t
“Why?” Cas asked, and Dean… well, Dean didn’t actually know why.
“The aim of the game is to pot all your balls – to get them into the holes,” he corrected when Cas opened his mouth as though he was about to ask what
this is, but you’re gonna bleed out if you don’t let me sew those wounds up.”
“Hey,” Sam replied, voice a little more harried than Dean had expected. “Where are you? I’ve been calling.”
Dean could hear his heart roaring in his ears, and thought that maybe he was going to pass out. Instead, he forced a deep breath, and then another one, and the world swam around him as tears prickled the corners of his eyes.
“Don’t make this worse than it has to be,” Dean told him, voice gentler than he had anticipated.
. “Dude obviously likes what he sees. And he’s, y’know… handsome?”
Cas cleared his throat, and sounded half-asleep when he answered, “Dean?”
“There are caves like this all over the park,” she told him once she realised what he’d found. “They don’t go very deep – usually animals make their nests in them.”
Then, in a bid for stupidest thing that had ever left his mouth, he replied, “Hey, bros help bros get laid, right?”
“Smart.”
“They didn’t have any twins,” Dean apologised, dropping his bag by the door so he could take a closer look around the room – there really wasn’t a lot to take in.
, and Dean found himself staring at the handwriting for a second, struck dumb by just what he was seeing.
video –
He’d inserted the tape and settled himself on the plush couch, fast-forwarding through the ads, by the time Drew appeared again. He’d had a bowl of popcorn under one arm, and was juggling an assortment of alcohol bottles in the other. The popcorn had been handed directly to Dean, who instantly crammed a handful into his mouth, and he watched as Drew seemed to ponder over the drinks for a moment, before selecting a beer and twisting the cap off. He took a long pull, head tilted back to show the long line of his neck, before he’d passed it over to Dean.
His hands were still shaking when he forced himself into a sitting position, back resting against the side of the car, but he didn’t quite feel like his gut was going to revolt at any second any longer. After a deep breath, and then another, he dragged himself back into the car, stooping only to fish the miraculously still-intact egg out of the footwell before slamming the door behind him. His shaking hands fought with the glove compartment, and he managed to get it open long enough to cram the egg inside beside the Colt and a half-eaten cheeseburger that he couldn’t remember having put there.
And Cas, for all his initial hesitance, was looking back. Dean wasn’t jealous – he
“Well… no?” the sheriff glanced at the ranger as though he thought Dean was stupid. “Seems pretty clear they were already dead by the time they washed up, Agent.”
“You have something that belongs to me.”
“Yeah,” Dean muttered.
Dean and Cas have a moment, Dean freaks out, and everything goes to shit.
It was time to go.
Dean was through the parking lot and halfway into the field beyond, sight locked on the house in the distance, before he realised that he was panicking. With a great, shuddering breath, he forced himself to stop, to
“Anything that might be linked. Old ruins, archaic writing, crop circles… I don’t know – monoliths?”
“Sam, we’re good – I don’t need to talk to him –“
“Your turn.”
he have seen it? The sun had already set, and anything out of the glare of the streetlamps was near impossible to make out. The moon was bright, but low in the autumnal sky; he could barely make out the house from where he stood anymore, never mind anything in the surrounding area.

Cas’s voice from the video. That was what he was thinking about as he clenched hard around his fingers and shot his load onto the tiled wall. Cas’s voice, and his hands, and his tongue, and his eyes – so
fun,” Sam laughed a moment later, and slapped Dean on the shoulder as he got to his feet. “You want a beer? I need a beer.”
“Just… please don’t die in there.”
“I have a copy of all the reports they could give me. I’ll wait for you in the parking lot.”
“Sure,” Dean had agreed, watching as Drew disappeared through the house before he’d gone to find the VHS.
, right? He had to know that Dean cared about him – cared about him so much he was pretty much on a par with
That was the very
“But… what about the eggs?” Dean asked, still confused.
“You're angry,” he murmured, which took Dean completely by surprise.
And then he spotted the nest.
“Cas, hey, no,” Dean tried, aware of his own voice cracking, too. “You can’t really believe that –?“
have been a new species, but probably not a simple bird or snake like Paxton thought.
“My Mom’s out of town for a conference this weekend,” Drew had mentioned one day while they’d been lounging on the bleachers, basking in the remnants of the weak, wintery sun. “The house will be empty; you guys wanna raid the liquor cabinet and hang out? You can sleep over if you want.”
squeak, tugging the laptop back towards himself so he could get another look at the guy Cas was…
“M’sleeping,” he mumbled into the pillow, and was proud of the fact that he only flinched a little when a warm hand reached out to press against the small of his back.

things inside him.
,” Sam finished with force, completely ignoring Dean’s attempts to derail the conversation. “For all our sakes.”
“Strange
Sam just sighed, watching Dean with an unreadable expression as he got to his feet. He snagged the bacon off his plate, but pushed the rest towards Sam – a habit from when they were kids that had stuck ever since. Sam stared at him for a moment more, but eventually picked up Dean’s fork and went to town on his eggs. Counting that as a win, Dean crammed a rasher of bacon into his mouth to hide his fond smile, and headed for the door.
“Is something wrong?”
“Wait, so what you’re saying…” Dean had to take a second to process everything. “Gloria Brown dies of natural causes and leaves no heir, so her pet vampire bird goes crazy with grief and starts killing anyone who ever wronged her while she was alive?”
“Dean,” Sam started, only to sigh. “Fine, whatever. Just… call me if you need help?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Missouri.”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, taking a deep breath of his own to steady his racing heart. He could talk about the case – he could talk about damn near anything as long as it wasn’t the strange expression on Cas’s face. “Yeah, um, so Sam found a couple news articles about hikers turning up drained of blood over in Missouri. Apparently, they’ve been washing up in a creek just off some campground – how do you feel about camping?”
His anguished voice immediately spurred Dean into action. He kept a paperclip attached to his shirt sleeve at all times for matters just as this – knew Sam did, too – and he quickly pulled it out to begin picking the lock of Cas’s bonds.
“Dude, what’s the big deal?” Sam laughed, apparently completely oblivious to
Dean had withdrawn further at school, too; his grades were slipping, his homework barely done. He’d made an effort to at least be polite, if not friendly, with the other kids, but even that went down the drain as he’d closed himself off, hunched at the back of his classes in a manner he knew looked standoffish. It was necessary, he’d told himself, to stop any of them from getting too close. It was pointless, trying to make friends, when he was just going to have to leave again.
Not strictly true, but Cas didn’t need to know that. In fact, in light of his recent revelation, Dean realised he might have actually been flirting with a lot of guys over the years without even realising it, which was… well, it was a panic attack for another day, he decided faintly.
, and now –“
“I guess,” Dean sighed. “But that doesn’t mean –“
Dean’s brain was still only working with backup power, it seemed, because all he could focus on was how
“Yes, I imagine that it won’t be pleasant. But,” Cas pauses and gives Dean a hopeful look. “This is worth the risk, Dean.”
It's a bittersweet ending. Honestly, I wasn't sure how to end it. I was considering making this even longer, but I don't want to promise that then never finish the fic (which I've done several times before)... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE leave kudos and comments!! I absolutely love hearing what you all think!
No. Not love. Who could ever love such a fuck up. Not an angel... not Cas, that’s for damn sure.
They stopped checking on him after the first few months.
Dean takes a few steps forward as the memory fades away. He grabs a glass and the unopened bottle of his favorite whiskey, thankful that Heaven got that part right. He pours himself a full glass then makes his way out of the kitchen and towards his bedroom. Dean isn’t sure if he wants to see the flashback he knows Heaven will show him in there.
out loud to Cas before their lips finally meet. He remembers how his heart was racing in his chest and how Cas’s lips cleared Dean’s mind of everything and anything that wasn’t
“That you have,” Cas responds with a sad smile on his lips. “I never thought it’d happen. I’ve wanted it for so long. I should be nothing but thrilled right now. I should be spending my seconds kissing you, not using every last bit of my strength to stay away from you. But I know I can’t allow myself to be happy. I know the right thing to do right now would be to leave, to at least deal with Chuck before allowing myself to feel that level of happiness. I’m devastated, Dean. I had accepted that’d I’d never get to be with you, but now… I have to push away the one and only thing left in the universe that’d make me truly happy. I can’t let The Empty take me until I know that Jack, Sam, and You are okay and safe from Chuck. That’s why I can’t stay, Dean. That‘s why I can’t allow myself to have this with you.”
Suddenly there was a firm grasp on his shoulder, pulling Dean’s mind into focus. Dean quickly got to his feet and jolted his body around, reaching for the gun that he didn’t have before getting into his defensive position.
what his brother was doing.
“I know, you don’t have to say anything.” Cas says as he moves his hand to cup the back of Dean’s head, his fingers tangling in Dean’s hair.
Of course, Dean doesn’t want to talk about it. How could he? What could he possibly say? He fucked up. He should’ve figured it out sooner. He should’ve went for the matches instead of the lighter. He should’ve... he should’ve... he should’ve—
So much fight, so much sacrifice.
Cas is grinning back at him, but only for a moment before the smile wiped off his face and replaced with a look of fear.
Dean’s brows furrow again as he gives Cas a perplexed look. “But… you’re still here, Cas. How…”
But the memory still flashes through his mind and tears escape the hunter’s sullen eyes.
Dean stares at the vial and nods slowly, preparing himself. He pulls out his knife and looks at Cas, who only nods at him and takes a step closer. The hunter holds his knife up against Cas’s neck, about to make the cut, but then pulls away and turns around, throwing his arms down at his sides. “I don’t know if I can do this, Cas. What if it doesn’t work? What if I lose you?”
“What do you mean, Dean? Of course I’m an angel.”
Their bottles clinked together above the map table before they took a celebratory sip. The brothers decided to fill the other two in on their little trip to Alaska, but had to back-peddle because Jack just had to hear more about their days in normality. They all laughed as Sam told them about Bess’s cold remedy that was so spicy it had him falling to the floor in tears. Then Dean butted in, explaining how he found out he was lactose intolerant after throwing up in one of the nastiest toilets he’d ever seen because he ate seven grilled cheeses. More laughter filled the room as the stories grew from recent events to family memories.
“Shut up,” he’d snapped, and the venom in his voice had been terrifying. “Just shut up, you –“
“Okay,” Sam replied, voice quiet and cautious, as though he was dealing with a spooked animal. “Well… I think I might have something for you.”
“Without a witch to guide them, they become something different entirely,” Sam continued. “Untethered, there’s really no end to the damage they could do. You said Gloria died six months ago?”
“Dean…” Castiel started, but promptly closed his mouth when Dean crossed his arms over his chest. “I –“
“No, dude, of course not,” Dean reassured him quickly, though he was honestly not entirely thrilled by the revelation either. “You like what you like – doesn’t matter as long as it’s fun and safe.”
An hour, maybe two, had definitely passed when Cas’s voice next drew him out of sleep; through the window, the sun had moved across the sky, bringing them closer and closer to evening. Dean sat up, his back protesting the movement, and pulled Cas’s coat up with him, if only to soak up its warmth for just a little while longer. His head didn’t feel like it was seconds away from splitting open anymore, and he breathed a quiet sigh of relief as Cas’s soft words continued to wash over him.
Cas smelled. How had he never noticed before? Earthy, and warm, and masculine, with just a hint of something otherworldly that Dean couldn’t quite place; the scent made his gut clench with want. How had he managed to hide what Cas really meant to him from himself for so long? He
Dean was trying to tell him. “Cas is a pretty good judge of character, and even if he brought someone here with bad intentions, you think he couldn’t handle himself? Look, I’m not particularly thrilled I’ve seen the evidence, and I’m definitely never offering to wash his sheets for him again, but the warding keeps us safe from anything dangerous, and the guy’s allowed to blow off a little steam every once in a while. S’not like it’s the first time.”
“Not eaten for a while.”
They crouched beside the body, Davis and Paxton watching on with concerned eyes, and Dean held his hand out for the paramedic’s gloves. He produced a second pair from another pocket, along with a small pair of scissors.
He thought that Sam might call him on his shit, but he just sighed and didn’t push the matter any further. Kid was smart in more ways than one, it seemed.
Yet more discussions about feelings, and then some headway is (finally) made with the case.
“I just mean… I didn’t know this is something you were interested in,” he replied, almost completely honest. “I didn’t think angels needed sex.”
“Could you not just…” Dean had to clear his throat again –
Thank God he didn’t run into anyone on the way there.
“It’s on the house,” the girl –
, and therefore you’re perfect for each other. Now, how’re we gonna play this?”
… you’re better than that, man. You deserve better than that.”
“Cas, down!” he found himself yelling, pausing only until he heard him roll off the bed and onto the floor before lunging for his lighter once again.
Dean didn’t even want to
“And that’s what you’re doing?” Dean asked. “Hooking up with strangers?”
“Not to worry,” Dean replied, and pulled his phone out of his pocket. “This is exactly why the FBI is dispatched – we can get a fresh perspective. My colleague is at the mortuary right now; I’ll give him a call, see if we can’t run any tests that would determine whether or not the bodies were ever fully submerged.”
“Sammy,” he greeted, resting his phone on his thigh as he continued to drive.
Cas wasn’t in the library, nor was he in the war room. He had no reason to be in any of the storerooms, or the basement, so Dean headed towards his bedroom instead.
“The first victim is named in an article from the 90s,” Cas explained. “Michael Turner, then thirteen, was charged with property damage after being dared to graffiti a local house by his friends.”
“What the
Emmie and Lilah had immediately squealed their agreement, and launched into a debate about what to tell their parents. Dean had listened quietly as their plans became more and more elaborate – “What if I tell
“Let’s get inside,” he suggested, glancing down at their room number. “There’s a storm coming.”
“I pulled Gloria’s record; she wasn’t married, and had no children or family to speak of. It’s been almost six months since her death, and the house just seems to have been… left to rot.”
Dean nodded, taking point, and raised his gun once again as he ducked through the doorway and descended to the basement below. He didn’t know what he had expected to find, exactly, but… it certainly wasn’t what he was met with at the foot of the stairs. He skidded to a stop, felt Cas smack against his back before he could stop himself, and they both just stared in silence for a couple of seconds at the scene in front of them.
“Yeah, me neither, but there’s a motel around forty minutes from the site, and a town full of people that might know something, so you in?”
Once he was done, he passed the glass back to Dean, who put it back onto the bedside table. He simply peered at Castiel for a moment, watching for any signs of him worsening, but after a moment it was Castiel who looked away, eyes cast down to where his hands now rested on his knees.
“What’s up?” he asked, and immediately got his answer as he sidled up to stand beside him.
worse.
“That was my initial thought, too,” Cas agreed, “but that doesn’t account for the natural phenomena, or explain why the bodies are found in the forest, drained of blood.”
“Thanks, darlin’,” he grunted, and ignored her when she rolled her eyes at him, instead turning back to Cas. “Let’s go, buddy.”
“Did you tell him that?”
He didn’t.
wandering around a town you don’t know, in the middle of a storm, at
Cas had longer fingers than him, he thought out of nowhere. He’d be able to reach a little deeper, open Dean up a little further. Would he use his tongue, too? Dean had only ever seen it dart out to lick plump, chapped lips in person, but he let his mind drift to what else it might be able to reach.
Cas’s eyes were closed, his breath shallow, and Dean felt bile rising quickly in his throat when he didn’t respond. Dean’s hands were shaking, his body thrumming with adrenaline that he didn’t know what to do with; all he knew was that they had to get out of there as fast as humanly possible.
The woman’s sweatpants, where dirty, were intact, and the paramedic leaned down to expertly cut along the seam. As her paper-thin skin was exposed, it became very apparent that she was sporting what Dean assumed were the same marks as the other victims. They were deep, down to brittle bones, but clean, and placed in a triangular-shaped pattern. There was no blood left, but Dean could easily imagine how much the wounds must have poured.
“Well,” Dean started, reaching to take a sip of his coffee instead. “I spoke a little bit to the kid in the motel office last night – said he had a friend whose mom works in the local morgue. According to her, the bodies were drained near dust by the time the authorities found them.”
“But we don’t know how some of the magical ingredients will react to fire,” Cas finished for him, and Dean nodded.
But that just seemed to confuse Cas even more. “But they allow me to penetrate them –“
“Noted, thank you,” Castiel nodded his head with a gentle sigh, and then turned back to Dean. “Are there any other probing questions you have about my sex life, or am I free to go?”
an errant spring. Something hot that he refused to name had rumbled low in his gut at that realisation, but he hadn’t said anything as Cas had quickly excused himself to the bathroom to “freshen up”. He’d been twenty minutes – Dean wasn’t quite stupid enough not to recognise what he was probably doing in there. The poor bathroom had seen more action in less than twelve hours than Dean had in six months.
“You should know by now that I
“A shame,” Castiel murmured, shit-eating grin brighter than the sun. “This is quite enjoyable.”
Sam was holding his open laptop, a small stack of papers resting on the keyboard. For a moment Dean thought he was going to push the beer issue, but instead he shook his head and held the laptop out, waiting for Dean to shove his barely eaten breakfast to the side so he could place it down in front of him.
Dean swallowed heavily, not really sure how to respond to such a blatant show of strength (and what that did to him), and had to clear his voice before he could reply.
“You remember what happened?” Dean asked, already cataloguing the meagre first aid supplies he knew they had for infection and stitches in his head, and whether or not he should call Sammy to pick some more up on his food run.
Dean span on the spot, already waving to catch the attention of the nearest paramedic. He came trotting over, brow furrowed, and Dean gestured to the gloves that were sticking out of his breast pocket.
Dean’s brain short-circuited.
“The drive is not the same as for humans, I admit,” Cas tilted his head to the side again, lips slightly pursed. “But… it’s hard to explain. At the time, I enjoyed sleeping with April immeasurably. The act itself was… miraculous isn’t the word, but it’s close, I suppose. But she used me, at my most vulnerable, and it soiled the whole experience. I simply… wanted to experience the pleasure without the betrayal.”
At the far edge of the clearing, Dean spotted a ranger’s truck tucked away, along with a couple of ambulances, cop cars, and the county sheriff’s jeep, and he headed in that direction, ignoring the signs pointing towards the pitch site opposite. The gentle babble of the nearby river followed him through the trees, and it was only ten minutes or so before he found another clearing and the source of the water.
he had learned from Dean and Sam, so Dean guessed it was something to do with the case.
He was inches from it, scrabbling against the wooden floor, when the next wave of energy hit him and he went sprawling backwards, crying out in pain as he landed heavily on top of the flamethrower. He couldn’t stop, though – couldn’t pause for breath – because he could see the creature begin to beat its wings, begin to move forwards towards where Cas was trying desperately to drag himself under the bed to safety. Terror, tight and hot, gripped Dean’s throat.
“Okay!” Dean yelped, a little louder than was strictly necessary. “Yeah, you – go take a shower, man.
He just had to wait him out.
Jesus, Sam had really made him open the floodgates on everything, hadn’t he? This was why Dean
And Dean paused, because… he hadn’t told Cas that. He actually couldn’t remember the last time he had physically told Cas that he was his friend. But… Cas
Instead, he stumbled through the thicket into a clearing of sorts, and was met with a felled tree so huge he had to stop for a moment to simply take it in. The ground underfoot was indeed charred, and he stepped cautiously towards the trunk, glancing around all the time. The air was ripe with the smell of ozone and burnt wood, and it clung to the insides of his nostrils.
Cas’s voice had always had a hypnotic quality. Each intonation held magnitudes – smoke, and life, and the universe itself. If Dean were being honest with himself – which he seemed to be doing now, apparently – he could admit that Cas’s voice sounded just as much like home than the thought of Sammy or the Impala did. When he heard Cas’s voice, even if it was marred with anger, he knew he was safe.
“You both take your pleasures where you can,” Cas continued, eyes flicking from Dean to Sam and then back again. “I am simply doing the same.”
– and it was all Dean could do to turn back to the road and keep his eyes on it.
“Ah,” Cas murmured, and Dean could just imagine his embarrassed frown. “That makes a lot more sense.”
“Any guess at how long she’d already been here?”
Dean schooled his expression, even as something clicked into place. “You’re sure they washed up?”
John had said a
“Hey,” he greeted. “Another body’s just turned up – how’s
It was empty, that much was clear, and Dean pocketed his gun again at the realisation. Light spilled in from the tunnel entrance set into the wall, and that, along with his flashlight, gave him a fairly good impression of the place. Animal bones scattered the floor, but that wasn’t entirely unexpected. He wandered around in a loose circle, keeping to the nearest wall at all times, but the most interesting thing he found was the beginning of a stalagmite forming in the back corner.
“So, he just… brings people here?” Dean shook his head, still not completely believing. “And then he, what? Let’s them tape him? While he’s…?”
The campsite was nothing spectacular. He almost missed the turn entirely, and had to slam the brakes on to pull onto the winding dirt path in time. A sign told him he was in the right place, and he followed the track down through the trees, brain rattling around in his skull on the uneven road, until the dirt flattened out and a shabby parking lot came into view. It was busier than he had anticipated, so close to the end of the season; hikers stood by their cars, chatting as they readied their boots and bags, and harried-looking parents chased after kids with pop-up tents gripped in their overloaded arms.
Cas was looking at him like he’d grown a second head – which… was probably fair. Even Dean was struggling with his flip-flopping emotions, so he could only imagine what Cas must think; hell, only last night he’d snapped at him for messaging some guy, and now he was actively pushing Cas towards one?
“Wow,
He didn’t go straight for his hole – chickened out at the last second – and instead brushed his fingers along his crack, getting used to the sensation. It wasn’t bad. Didn’t really feel like much of anything, if he was being honest with himself, but definitely not bad. Spurred on by that realisation, on the next swipe of his fingers he let one catch and press gently against his hole.
“Dean? What’s a Cleveland Steamer?”
Hidden from the beam of his flashlight by another jagged corner, he hadn’t spotted it at first glance. A nest in a cave in the forest wasn’t a particularly strange thing to find, he reasoned, but as he stepped closer, as his flashlight caught more in the darkness, he realised just how
Cas nodded his head, as though something was decided. “Well, none of this is going anywhere. We should find dinner and pick this back up tomorrow.”
“I’ll do my best,” Dean grinned, and then ducked into the hole.
He told himself he wasn’t showing off when he tucked the cue behind his back and knocked the white ball into another striped one without looking. He didn’t pot anything else, but if Cas looked impressed regardless, that was really on him. It certainly didn’t make Dean’s gut curl, hot and tight.
And then the tip of his finger slid in.
, but that’s about all he had the capacity for understanding. Castiel, however, seemed to know exactly what he was doing, if his grin was anything to go by.
. Stuffy, in an endlessly endearing way, and a little preachy when he really got on a roll, but not…
The next morning, clad in his new clothes and with his new supplies, Dean had almost felt like a new man as he’d herded Sammy into Bobby’s rusty truck. He wasn’t, of course – would always be the same old Dean – but sometimes it was nice to pretend, even if only for a moment. While he had discreetly checked himself out in the rear-view mirror, Sammy was prattling on about books, or geography, or whatever it was the kid rambled on about when he was excitedly nervous; Bobby, to his credit, had listened to every word with an indulgent smile on his face.
“Well, yeah,” Sam replied carefully. “I’ve seen him with a couple people around here.”
“Cas?” he called, banging on the closed door. “Rise and shine, buddy – we’ve got a case to work!”
He didn’t pull away.
“Yeah, well,” he croaked, unable to keep his voice from shaking this time. “I’m not the one that needs taking care of right now.”
“So not long enough to have just… dried out naturally,” Dean nodded. “Okay.”
It didn’t make him gay, was the point. If he had just been watching dudes going at it without Stella giving him what was probably one of the top ten blowjobs of his life, nothing would have happened. He’d only watched it for a second, anyway, and he’d been close beforehand. It was the shock, was all – sex thoughts weren’t
Which was boring. It did mean the old broad had died in the house, though, which was definitely more interesting.
“Dad,” he’d croaked, heart beating wildly in his chest, as he’d straightened up. “How did you –?“
That was when he spotted the tunnel.
room, all drab and sad looking and devoid of any personal touches, but his, nonetheless. “He brought this guy
. Whatever’s happened between you two since you found that stupid video –“
“You sure it’s something for us? Hikers wind up dead all the time – doesn’t mean there’s anything spooky going on,” Dean reasoned, taking another sip of his beer as he rifled through Sam’s research. “Hell, follow the wrong trail, misstep too close to a ledge – it’s easy to get yourself killed someplace like that.”
so close, but risked a hand at Cas’s waist for just a second to balance himself. He moved it quickly, afraid if he didn’t he’d want to leave it there forever, and instead moved his hands so they brushed against Cas’s on the cue.
“Because you’re at home, because you tricked me into doing this case with Cas –“
Dean let him, of course. He stood there for a moment, hand in Castiel’s, weighing up how stupid he’d look if he simply turned tail and ran out of the door. Cas seemed to be weighing something in his mind, too, because his brows had knitted together again, and he appeared to be searching for something on Dean’s face. Then, seemingly satisfied with whatever he saw, he silently drew Dean down to the bed and brought their faces together for a passionate, if somewhat chaste, kiss.
Dean hummed, tossing the supplies back. “Huh. Kinky.”
Emmie rolled her eyes, even as she replied, “Truth.”
, do you understand me?”
,” he choked, breath leaving him in a desperately relieved huff as he immediately spotted an all too familiar lump amongst the covers of the bed. “Cas!”
No-one, was the answer.
“’Red Bluff Campground’,” he read aloud, feigning ignorance. “Hey, isn’t that where those hikers have been washing up?”
“You were rude to that woman,” Cas was the first to break, and Dean childishly found himself thinking of it as a win.
– how had he missed how
“Anything else worth reporting?”
– and his smile, and the way he laughed –
“Sam?” he called back towards the kitchen. “You know where Cas is?”
It immediately became apparent that something was wrong.
outside of this bunker, and I… it’s just taking me a second to switch gears, man, I’m sorry.”
was, “before your opponent, okay? But, again, the black ball is separate. You don’t pot that until the end.”
Every once in a while a small grimace plastered Castiel’s face, or a grunt of pain passed his lips, and Dean paused each time, gave him a moment to steady his breathing with a soothing hand on his thigh, and then went back to work. It was slow going, and the room would have been deathly quiet if not for their unsteady breathing and the occasional whimper from Cas, but Dean found a rhythm in the familiarity of the scene. He had done this countless times – for Sam, for himself, for his Dad, back in the day – and he knew how this all worked. He knew exactly what needed to be done.
The basement was empty.
But John hadn’t let him finish. He’d pushed Dean backwards hard enough that his head smacked against the door’s window; the glass hadn’t smashed, but pain, hot and sharp, had erupted behind Dean’s eyes. It had taken him a moment to gather himself, to catch his breath, and while he did so John had started the car and pulled away.
“I am not getting involved in this,” Sam told him, bitch-facing his way through picking up the rest of his books. “It isn’t our business what he does in his spare time, or who he does it with.”
Dean had needed to hear it.
Cas drew the laptop towards him, and clumsily snapped four separate articles into place side by side. The copies varied widely in condition, but even Dean could make out that they were at least different issues of the same local newspaper.
It was as they’d suspected, but still interesting to have confirmed. Dean nodded thoughtfully, eyes raking over the information in front of them.
Two could play at that game.
Cas hummed in agreement, and looked as perturbed as Dean felt. “We should leave.”
“Alright! Well, I’m pretty much packed – just need to get the FBI jackets out of storage – and then we’re good to go. You might wanna grab anything you think you’ll need and –“
Dean rubbed his hand over his eyes, not completely sure that they weren’t about to bug out of his stupid head. “When has all this been
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted, appearing at Dean’s door, and he looked…
house, and you tell
Because he’d grown accustomed to his little habit over the years, and had genuinely stopped worrying about what it might mean. It meant exactly what he wanted it to, which was nothing…
“Do you want AIDS?” John had screamed, spittle flying from his mouth in his rage, and Dean hadn’t really known, past whispered insults kids threw at each other in the hallway, what that had meant, either.
“Can you move a little?” he asked, groaning as he pushed to his feet.
” Dean snapped, only for the words to crinkle up and die in his throat.
“Why don’t you come up with some full sentences and ask him yourself?” Sam sighed, reaching down to pick one of his books up off the floor. “I’m busy.”
“There are differing reports,” Sam hummed, voice pinched. “Some say poisoned milk, but others say it has to be burned alive. Can’t imagine it’d survive getting its head chopped off, either.”
he wasn’t good with words, for Christ’s sake.
Cas rolled his eyes, just like he always did when Dean said something that he didn’t entirely understand, and slid into the car without a word. He then, with a single-minded focus Dean had only seen in him a couple of times before, unceremoniously reached across the space between them and pulled him into a crushing hug.
He would hate doing it – and he could see from his expression that Cas wasn’t thrilled by the idea, either – but while he didn’t exactly trust Rowena, she sure had her uses, and recognising magical shit was definitely up there at the top. If they could figure out how powerful Gloria Brown had been, or what sort of shit she had been getting herself into, maybe they could link some more of the clues together and finally start figuring this whole mess out.
“Mmm,” Dean hummed, breathless against Castiel’s lips. “Not that I don’t appreciate whatever the
into Shirley’s mouth. She made a noise of surprise, followed by a choking cough, and then swallowed a couple of times.
They made one more sweep of the house just to make sure they weren’t missing anything, and ultimately met back out on the porch. Cas closed the front door behind them and pressed his palm against the surface; there was a quiet
He wasn’t gay, he’d said – he’d
A voice came, unbidden, to his thoughts.
Sam shot him a strange look, and another smirk crept onto his lips.
It was almost 10pm by the time they pulled off the main road and into a motel parking lot. It didn’t exactly look like the most luxurious of places, but Dean was exhausted after a very trying day of driving and talking about feelings with a celestial being, and had definitely spent nights in worse places.
“What do you mean?”
They hadn’t talked about it, afterwards. There was no need to – morning wood was natural, and certainly nothing to be alarmed about. Dean knew from experience that just about anything could set it off, and with Cas being so new to the whole experience there was really no wonder he was a little extra sensitive. Instead, to help mitigate the awkward silence that had filled the room, Dean had suggested they find a diner for some much-needed coffee and a chance to plan the hunt.
Cas must have seen something in Dean’s expression – what, he wasn’t entirely sure himself – because he shushed him gently and ran his hand back through his hair. It should have made him panic, he thought distantly, such an intimate touch, but it just felt so good, and Dean was so tired, and he could barely keep his eyes open. It was selfish, taking advantage of Cas’s kind nature like this, but he couldn’t help himself.
His hand paused over the spacebar for just a second, eyes catching something on the screen that sent a jolt of unmitigated shock spiking across his brain all over again. That smile was Cas’s; he knew it anywhere. The guy on the video didn’t just
“Your grace,” he whispered, watching in sick fascination as whisps of white-blue escaped through the wounds and disappeared into nothingness. “Cas,
Cas smiled, a small thing, and gestured to the stairs leading down. “After you.”
Cas hummed, bobbing his head in a nod of understanding, while his eyes flicked back to his phone as it pinged with another message. Dean, sensing what was about to happen, leaned over and covered the phone with his hand before Cas could reach for it.
,” Lilah had cackled, and then, wiping her eyes in a practised motion that meant her makeup wouldn’t smudge, she’d rounded on Dean. “Okay, Dean-o, your turn. Truth or dare?”
“I can’t say it’s something that has ever crossed my mind,” Cas replied with just the hint of a smile. “But good to know.”

“Well, we can try,” Dean cut him off, tipping two pills straight into Castiel’s palm. He reached for the glass and placed it in the other. “Drink.”
“And intimacy… it can be platonic, too,” he continued quickly, feeling just a little too exposed. “Wanting to be close to someone, to share lives with them… it doesn’t have to include sex. Me and Sam, we’re probably as connected as two people can get, but I’d rather cut my own nuts off than even
when he spotted Dean. All traces of heat evaporated from his expression immediately, and that… Dean wasn’t stung by that realisation.
. He could only imagine how sensitive Cas must have been to every touch, every new sensation –
It was awkward, to say the least. Drew’s lips were chapped, and neither of them had been even remotely experienced enough to realise they were supposed to tilt their heads if they wanted to avoid bumping noses, but… it had been perfect. It was Dean’s first kiss, and it’d been warm, and exciting, and hilariously inept, and it was

aside, and it was because barely a hair was out of place. Even if she had just fallen into the river and drowned, the current would have smacked the body against rocks, debris, and soaked it through, but there was nothing to even hint that that had occurred. Hell, put the blood back, and she'd be in better shape than any of them.
Sure,
Fat lot of good it had done, Cas locking it behind them.
“I’m deleting all the dating apps off your phone as soon as we get out of here,” he mumbled without really thinking as he shoved the covers away from Cas’s sticky legs and prepared to help him into his pants. “Either that, or we have to work on your game so the people you sleep with don’t want to kill you afterwards.”
“And Tinder,” Cas replied matter-of-factly. “I’ve found that Grindr attracts more adventurous lovers, though I enjoy the flirtations of many on Tinder. I’ve learned a great deal.”
Just a head's up - there’s some underage drinking in this chapter.
Another thing to add to the list of times Castiel had lied to him. Dean bit his lip to keep himself from saying something he’d regret later, and instead peeled himself away from Cas’s body to lean back on his haunches. Colour was draining from Cas’s face by the minute, and he realised he was going to have to put away whatever feeling was bubbling hot and painful in his chest for later, because it was beginning to look like this was a lot worse than even he had thought.
“I’m gonna take a shower,” he informed Cas, already moving towards the suspiciously clean bathroom. “We’ll start in on the case tomorrow; even if you’re not tired, I sure as hell am.”
“C’mon, boy,” he’d murmured, and placed an arm around Dean’s shoulders. “How ‘bout you go find that brother of yours while I call Sal’s? I think we all deserve pizza tonight.”
– let that happen with Cas, too. Just being his friend was risky enough, and Dean knew he couldn’t survive losing him altogether, so he had to stow this crap and pretend it wasn’t happening. He could do that.
“And there isn’t always rain, either,” Paxton continued earnestly. “I know the two aren’t mutually exclusive, but you kinda expect a downpour at some point during a thunderstorm, right? The air gets all electric and damp, but sometimes the rain just… doesn’t come.”
Dean hummed in agreement and peered down at where the log had split. The wood was cracked, fissures of singed wood etched deep into its body. A quick glance at the stump it had fallen from offered the same results.
control what happened after they fought them.
“Agent Morello, FBI,” he stated, and the officer immediately stopped in her tracks. “Here to speak with the sheriff.”
“Yeah, Cas, we’re connected,” he nodded, voice cracking a little at the end. With a deep breath, and throwing caution to the wind, he reached out to cup the back of Cas’s neck. He didn’t miss the way his eyelids fluttered as he leaned back into the contact, but that was probably just because he was so obviously touch-starved, right? “And we’re gonna figure this out, okay? Whatever this is – whatever you need… we’ll figure it out.”
The cashier had her hand on Cas’s bicep. Dean couldn’t make out what they were talking about – could only see that whatever Cas had just said had made the girl throw her head back in laughter. He watched, a little dumbfounded, as Cas’s eyes drifted to the long line of her neck – not unlike how Dean himself might have checked a hot girl out – and when he smiled back at her it was with a heat Dean was still completely unused to seeing on his face.
In his focus, it took him a few moments to realise his phone was ringing, and then another few seconds of fishing around in Baby’s nooks and crannies to find where it had disappeared. It was under his thigh, of all places, and, assuming it was Sammy again, he hit
“No,” Cas confirmed, expression flat.

come like that before.
– because they’d already talked about this; Cas was allowed to fuck all the beautiful strangers he wanted, because he didn’t belong to Dean and deserved to be taken care of. He didn’t want Cas to wake up on that lumpy mattress beside him again with a boner that Dean couldn’t let himself do anything about, didn’t want Cas to feel like he was stuck with Dean and Sam just because they were the best of a bad situation.
“Yep,” Dean nodded. “Girl’s legs are in the creek, but there’s not a drop of water anywhere else.”
“You should have said,” he murmured, voice pinched around the lump in his throat. “Why didn’t you tell us?”
“How was the hunt?” he’d tried, stupidly, once his Dad had slipped into the driver’s seat.
“No, that’s…” Dean had to clear his throat, and then, because he was apparently a sucker for punishment, asked, “You, uh, have a nice time?”
“It’s better than nothing,” Dean replied, and rolled his sleeves down to hide the cuts he had made. “Anything is better than nothing.”
And Dean, because he knew none of this was really Sammy’s fault, forced himself to calm down. His brother was an ass, but he was a well-meaning one, at least.

Cas nodded, and quickly typed said address into the map browser. As soon as he hit enter, a pin appeared… right on top of a lone house that sat within the perimeters of the proposed development land.
lips wrapped around him, and the noises the girl was making between his legs. If he concentrated, the porn just disappeared into the background, as though it wasn’t on at all. It was for his partner, after all, and Dean wasn't anything if not giving in bed.
“Jesus, Sammy,” he whispered, because he couldn’t quite figure out how to thank him instead. But then Sam’s words registered further, and he found himself asking, “Wait… how’re
“Kinda?” Sam replied, the distaste in his voice clear. “They have the ability to shapeshift into, and I quote,
“That’s… yeah, that works,” he croaked, and nodded his head. “Yeah, that’s – thanks.”
Plastering a grin on his face, he reached over and wound the passenger window down as Cas approached. “Carpool for Miss Daisy?”
, Dean.”
As quickly as he had started, his hand slowed on his dick. Breath coming in short gasps, mind addled with lust, he stared through the water to the half-bottle of moisturiser and realised he could very easily find out. But as soon as the thought had entered his head, a deep rumble in his gut tried to shut it down. Thinking about it was bad enough, but to actually put it into practise? Dean was torn, very aware that this was a precipice – a potential point of no return.
“S-sorry,” he managed, still out of breath, and rubbed a shaky hand over his sweaty face. “That was…”
“You got it,” Sam replied, and then he was gone.

“Like it’s giving you constant static shocks,” Dean added. “It’s… it’s not normal, that’s for sure.”
As he waited for the pump to do its thing, he let his mind go blank, revelling in the gentle breeze that washed across his face as he idly glanced through the store window. He felt more relaxed than he had done for a while, a long drive usually all it took to make him feel focused, and that was why he didn’t immediately spot Cas. He’d expected to find him wrestling with the hotdog machine, or maybe staring blankly at a soda label, but instead…
A wave of dizziness swept over him again, only this time he craved the release of unconsciousness, if only to halt his scrambled thoughts and shaking hands. The static was still there, low in his ears, but he realised after a moment that it was coming from his laptop, from the video that had apparently buffered and was continuing to play.

When he was buttoned up and sure he wasn’t going to bleed through his shirt, Dean took a deep breath and glanced off through Baby’s window to the house in the distance. There was an eerie sort of stillness to it that made something cold and dark settle behind his ribs, a quiet horror that felt like a living thing clawing at his chest.
He took a deep breath, feeling simultaneously calmer and a little like his head was about to explode all at once, and then grabbed his laptop and bolted from the room. Sam was the first person he found, researching something-or-other in the library, and Dean swept his books clean off the table to clear way for his laptop with still-shaking hands.

. The walls were lined with shelves, each one bowing under the weight of mountains of spell books and jars, plants and bones. Dean took a tentative step forwards and peered into the closest jar; he swore something blinked back at him from the murky liquid within, and he supressed a shudder as he stepped away again.
“Beer with breakfast?” Sam asked with a hint of apprehension, pulling Dean from his thoughts as he wandered into the kitchen that morning. “You wanna talk about it?”
The house loomed, creaky and imposing, ahead of them, and it only took ten minutes of wading through long grass and brush to reach it. They circled the whole property once, taking in the chipped paint and cracked windows, but found nothing especially interesting on the outside.
“Fire it is,” Dean grunted, taking just a second to glance around him before he yanked their flamethrower from the bottom of the trunk. “God, I love this thing.”
Cas didn’t seem convinced; his expression was pinched as he looked at Dean, seemingly trying to find something in his expression that would either confirm or dispel his worry. Dean did his best to appear relaxed, pulling away from Cas’s hold just enough so he could settle back into his seat and ready himself for the drive back to the motel, but he could feel Cas’s eyes burning a hole into the side of his head all the same.
“Well, you could have
Dean waited approximately five seconds after Cas had disappeared before he threw himself bodily back onto the bed, covering his face with his hands as he did so.

“Yes, I just have to pay,” Cas nodded, but when he turned back to the counter, he was met with fluttering eyelashes and a waving hand.
The entrance was small, facing away from the path, and would have been easy to miss if he hadn’t been looking. It was big enough to just about fit a person if they were prepared to crouch and suck in their gut, and as he peered into the darkness, he realised it went down further than he could see.
“You scared me,” Cas murmured, his hands shifting from the back of Dean’s neck to his shoulders, where they stayed as he pulled back just far enough to catch Dean’s eye. “Are you alright?”
“Right?” Dean nodded, gesturing wildly to the scene.
“I thought that’s just how you spent most of your free time,” Sam replied without missing a beat, but something in Dean’s crazed expression must have made him pause, because he actually glanced down at the screen instead of jibing further. “
“Oh.”
“You get that, Cas?” Dean asked into the phone, only to be met with the sound of rustling paper.
“Well, wasn’t like we were planning on this happening,” Dean replied, momentarily distracted by a couple of drunk kids stumbling by. They didn’t bother him, minds obviously anywhere other than in their own heads, but he covered the trunk with his body regardless. “Shit, I’m gonna get made if I don’t haul ass. What did you say could kill these things?”
not gay that he felt entirely comfortable scrolling through the gay section of his favourite porn site a couple of weeks later when he had some time to kill. He learned some new terms, sure, and his dick was hard and aching between his legs after a couple of minutes, but he didn’t come until he’d flipped back to good, old fashioned lesbian action, which proved his hypothesis – not gay.
“Because

“Okay, Emmie, truth or dare?” Drew had crowed, appearing from the house with a boombox in his arms.
But Lilah, who he would come to realise was smarter than anyone gave her credit for, had just nodded her head thoughtfully and hummed. “You better come to the bleachers at lunch so I can introduce you to everyone, then.”

Uniforms bustled around, wrapping tape around the trees to cordon off the bank of the creek. A forensic tent was being erected, and a gaggle of people stood in a half circle by the water’s edge. Dean straightened his tie and then ducked under the nearest tape, flashing his FBI badge at an officer who immediately came trotting over with a startled expression on her face.
allowed to say no. You’ll figure out what you like, what you’re comfortable with, not so comfortable with, and what’s a hard pass the more you… y’know.”
Sam called him around twenty minutes into his drive back towards town, and Dean picked up quickly, eager to hear about how the Wendigo case was going.
“Yes, sir,” Dean had replied, and had to stop himself from bounding down the path with his backpack and sleeping bag in tow, lest Drew peek out of a window and see what a dork he was being.
Cas frowned. “So, it
“You’re welcome.”
A small sob erupted from Cas’s lips, stopping Dean in his tracks. He glanced up, heart leaping into his throat when he realised there were tears spilling down Cas’s agonised face, cutting through the lines of grime and blood. He was shaking again, his body a sparkling constellation of escaping grace, and Dean realised all too late just how traumatised he truly was.
