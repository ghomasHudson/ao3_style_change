You're the best! Much love, Jane
Turns out this part isn't divided into chapters either. Just like Part 2. You'll notice I specified 10 chapters, but that is a guess. It could be more. Maybe less. We'll see together.
A flat explodes.
“Looks like you won’t be attending the show after all. What a shame,” clicking his tongue. “I’ll still make sure John puts on the performance of his life. Just for you.”
Will John speak with the previous doc to find out?
“Look, Sherlock, you’re good at hiding things from people,” John pauses, pursing his lips while Sherlock gives him a smile of smug satisfaction, “but not from me.”
Sherlock’s expression changed in a heartbeat and his relaxed posture tightened into stiff muscles. His smile vanished, becoming a clenched jaw with muscles working beneath the skin. John felt the open door between them slam shut. Sherlock released his hold on John’s arms and began to step away. Shit, John was not entirely sure what he did wrong, but he had to make it right.
“All right then,” John wets his lips and slips his fingers into the waistband of his boxers. Sherlock’s brain stops as he watches John pull the waistband down to reveal a hipbone, the wound and skin much lighter than the rest of John’s body. Sherlock’s mouth goes dry.
“Since he graduated,” Mrs. Hudson agrees, clearly enjoying the conversation. “Charles resigned shortly thereafter and relocated to the United States for the derby. They kept making jokes about John driving him out of the university with his shenanigans.”
They grin at one another and laugh quietly. Sherlock cocks a brow and raises the fork to his mouth.
“You are a coward and a hypocrite. You hold others fast to the rules while you break them as it suits you. You are pathetic, Mr. Holmes, and I’m going to put a stop to it.”
John wants him?
Hello, everyone! I’m coming off the shittiest week since this whole shelter in place thing started. Just seems like everything is getting me, the little things, ya know? Then I did so much work tearing down an exhibit that my back wanted to end me for a good two days. I watched the National Theater streaming Frankenstein with Benedict as the monster. He made me feel the monster's plight like I have never felt before, just as he did with The Grinch. My good friend, Superwholocklmt tells me I'm an empath who really tunes into other people's feelings and pain. I think she's right because I was crying and could not reign it in for the longest time. I think i'm finally to the point where I can think about it without it bothering me.
Licking his lips, John finally knocks lightly on the door and hears his flatmate’s voice grant him entrance. He walks in to see Sherlock dressed in silk pajamas and sitting on his bed. The royal blue silk looks stunning against his dark hair and brings out the blue flecks in his eyes. A stray curl hangs down onto his forehead. John suddenly feels embarrassed in his own plaid pj bottoms and white tee. He balls his hands into fists and swallows hard, captivated by the vision before him.
“Of course.”
“They just stood there and let you slam into them on roller skates?” John’s mouth hangs open in disbelief.
Then he blinks and shakes his head a little.
“Yes,” Jim met John’s eyes. “I’m sorry.”
“Have I ever given indication to the contrary during our association?” he asks, but it is not really a question.
Jam - or round. Each jam lasts a maximum of two minutes, if the lead jammer does not call it off. Blockers and jammers may be swapped out in between each jam.
“Don’t be an idiot, John,” he shouted, feet set and shoulders squared. “Get over here.”
John’s face goes all soft and he tilts his head. Though he says nothing at first, he places a gentle hand on Sherlock’s. It is warm and feels like home.
* Now that they're engaged, can they make it to the wedding?
Dr. Watson takes over his thought processes as John grabs a towel, drops to his knees, and presses it hard to Sherlock’s chest. The detective gasps and then groans in response.
“Stop,” Sherlock repeats. “I can
“It is,” Sherlock rolls his eyes and takes a drink.
“Indeed.”
“Any. Thing,” Sherlock pins John with cold grey eyes. “He has no scruples. His moral compass is skewed. Classic personality trait.”
They wake up.
Moriarty
Much love (and silliness), Jane
So, the story continues. Now we can all see if our intrepid duo is interrupted or if Cakey Jane, evil though she is, surprises you with very exciting and much anticipated intimacy. Only one way to find out!
Tune in (hopefully tomorrow) to read THE FINAL CHAPTER!!!!!!
Of course John hears none of Greg’s side of the conversation and can only guess at what he said to elicit Sherlock’s expression of shock. He is about to whisper an inquiry when the coach lays his mobile on the table.
Sherlock gives his head a quick shake to dispel the images forming in the John wing of his mind palace and slams the door shut before his cheeks are so pink John will think he has a fever. Shifting backwards a step and worrying his lips, he meets John ‘s eyes again. He suddenly feels ridiculous, like he is tucking John in for the night. Not trusting himself to speak, Sherlock turns and walks to the door. When he looks back at John, the man wears yet another unreadable expression. Sherlock shrugs toward the hall and smiles somewhat awkwardly.
(read in DP's Bob Ross voice)
Sherlock sighs and looks at him. Greg studies him and he’ll be goddamned if Sherlock doesn’t believe him. The man who would have scoffed any other time in his life and accused Greg of enacting the role of older brother in an after school special is actually listening. He is actually accepting support when he needs it instead of turning away and shutting everyone out but Molly. The man is actually growing up.
Sherlock sighs. His resolution to steer clear of romantic entanglements is in tatters. It faded before his eyes the moment he met John Watson and his heart did it whole-heartedly without even consulting him. Sherlock knows he should be furious with himself, but instead he feels delighted and almost refreshed. Happier than he has felt in some time, if he is honest. He is just as mystified by that and he is by John himself.
“I’ve already told you. We’ve discussed it. It’s done.”
“Problem?” he furrows his brow until that little wrinkle appears between his eyes. John wants to lick it. “You look troubled.”
Sherlock stopped a moment to insert a turn in their dance, in spite of the fact that he was not leading. John followed along with a quiet chuckle. Sherlock added a series of steps that ended with them closer to the edge of the dance floor, but still far enough away from the bar and the couple they were watching. Dozens of people talking and laughing at tables separated them. Even if the woman or her lover looked out to the dance floor and saw Sherlock and John, neither would think anything of it.
“Sherlock, don’t do anything foolish,” Greg cautions. “Where are you?”
He studied John with more than a little hesitation, but did not try to pull away again.
We finally get a chance to see what Greg's been up to and to see a bit more of his character. Whether you're touched by the goodness in his heart in his inability to kill Morris, or you think he has no guts and was a coward when he didn't end the killer, I hope you still love him. My Greg is truly an extraordinary man. I love him to bits.
“Hey, no, I want that. I want to date,” John says, his brows knitted in concern now. He nearly misses the tiny nod Sherlock gives him. John hesitates for a second before covering Sherlock’s hand with his again. An electric shock shoots up Sherlock’s arm at the touch, though he keeps himself from jumping this time. John is smiling now. A glorious, brilliant smile. “I’d absolutely love it.”
“His flashlight,” John amends with a laugh. “It was so dark and my lungs were on fire and I saw this light. For a second, I thought it was light from ‘the door to heaven’. That’s what my grandmother always said.”
6) Will John see that the weird feelings he's experiencing are love? For Sherlock???
ONWARD!!
John purses his lips and shifts his weight. His hands rest on his hips and he looks at his colleague skeptically.
Thank you and I love you all. If you feel moved to comment, please do. They are very welcome and give me great joy indeed. Much love, Jane
“Can you prove that?”
I love this chapter. It warms my heart. Sherlock finally realizing being human is okay and that John brings him strength. John finally saying yes when Sherlock asks, feeling that he has worked through everything that has happened and coming out better on the other side. Beautiful. And then the sex. OH YEAH! Steamy, sultry, John carrying Sherlock around the flat for a change. Need I say more.
Holy shit, Jane!! What the hell were you thinking?! And you goddamn sneaky bitch. That chapter summary was so cute and I never suspected for a minute that it would end like this. Oh. My. God. (Yes, that's right. It's so intense we're spelling out the words.)
“Stop it,” the words hit him like a freight train.
I also wanted to say that whatever happens in my story, you have to do just what the title says - Persist. It's pretty long. There are good and bad times. Jim is a dick, and John and Sherlock have to put up with a lot of shit. Please stick around for everything. It has a great ending (whether happy or sad) I promise.
John gives him a small nod as Sherlock gestures to a nearby cafe simply called ‘A Taste of India’. What the name lacks, the air drifting from inside makes up for with warm spices and the scent of freshly baked naan. They are soon seated and indulging in some of the best Indian food John has ever tasted.
It is a foolish, romantic notion and Sherlock would normally berate anyone for such nonsense, but John is smiling that beautiful smile that shines in his eyes and Sherlock wants him never to stop.
“Have you seen…”
“I’m sorry. I wish I could be of more help,” he says finally.
Hello, my friends! I hope you are all having/had a lovely Sunday. I apologize for being late with this chapter. I decided to try out a beta and it is definitely a learning process. I hadn’t anticipated the extra time editing would take, or wanting so many “final” read-throughs. Mind you, I truly believe the chapter is better for it and thank her from the bottom of my heart. However....for whatever reason, I’m more freaked out about putting this chapter out there than any other so far. Haha. Whatever the case with me, I hope you all enjoy it.
“Yeah,” Jim put on an apologetic face, “I’m sorry I was late.”
I want to be honest before I turn to question time. The next couple weeks could be hard and I may not get the next two chapters out on Sundays, but I’ll do my best. Please be with me in spirit. I will definitely be with you.
“I’m sorry, what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock looks around the boat quickly and sees a length of rope hanging from a nearby hook. He lifts off Moriarty just enough to grab it and sets to work tying the man where he lies. He rises as Moriarty turns his head to look at him in a daze.
“No,” he grumbles, low and dark, “I am not riding in an ambulance.”
“Do him!” John exclaimed, jerking his head to his left. Sherlock’s amused gaze followed and picked out the man instantly. He looked back at John with narrowed eyes and a knowing smirk.
“You’re the one who called?” Budreau focuses on Sherlock, taking a step closer to where he and John are still resting on their knees.
I wish you all love and happiness (and damn good Johnlock). ;)
What's in store for us now? What's in store for John? Or Sherlock?
If John’s brain was functioning properly, he would point out that
Scowling, John dodges the burning rope and pushes hard on the thick metal platform Sherlock is tied to. It doesn’t budge, but it does lurch upward a foot or two when another strand of the rope snaps.
“Shit,” John’s voice draws Sherlock’s eye and pulls him from his thoughts. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that the way it sounded.”
Brushing the thoughts from his mind, he looks at John again and hopes he did not notice the hungry look in his eyes, but knows he must have. He watches for any trace of reaction on the doctor’s face, but there is none. John opens his mouth to speak and his words are not at all what Sherlock expects.
Sherlock studies John closely. He doesn’t know why he hesitates, but still does. He can trust John with his concerns. He trusts him with his life, for god sake, but this is different. This is a feeling not backed by logic. Ordinarily, he would tell no one and dismiss it as an absurd lack of concentration. Sentiment. But John. He will understand and still Sherlock watches him, unsure. He soon finds himself looking intently at every aspect of John’s expression, getting lost in his eyes. The crinkles around them, the way his brows punctuate every expression, and his mouth… God, his mouth.
John comes home.
“The two of us,” Sherlock repeats. His chest and cheeks feel warm as his feelings, so soundly stifled, bubble to the surface again. “Against the world.”
The dark curls that frame his face flutter artfully in the cool breeze created by the fast-moving skaters not twenty feet in front of him. He watches yet not seeing at all, his mind visualizing strategies and scoring tactics playing out on the track before him.
Now, I know the BJ scene could be pretty controversial to some of you. I acknowledge that it has been a very short time since John's rape and realistically, not many people in his situation would find themselves in another sexual situation so quickly. What I'm trying to show here is how safe he feels with Sherlock and how much they love each other and how that love helps them both. They truly are two halves of the same whole and that means complete security and trust. In this specific case, those feelings are so strong for John that his hurt is taken away and he is free to be with Sherlock the way he wants to be again, even if only for a moment. I hope that makes sense, even if it's an old romantic notion. If not, please remember this is a work of fiction and as real as I want it to be, sometimes it may fall short. (But hopefully it's still good! ;D )
“Hey,” John’s hand is suddenly on his. He looks at him from under long lashes. “You okay?”
“Surprised, dear? I do listen to your rants, you know. ‘You see, but do not observe’. I’m excited to see if you meet your match in him.”
Darling, you gotta let me know. Should I stay or should I go?
They watched as the man leaned in for a gentle kiss that she reciprocated. The couple appeared to be very taken with one another, very much in love, not desperate to get out of the club and into bed like new lovers. As if reading his mind, Sherlock leaned in to whisper in John’s ear.
“M’fine,” he nods, straightening up. “Fine. Just tired.”
“You could use the exercise equipment at the stadium then. The ladies are usually out of the building by 8-8:30.”
That said, I give you chapter 4...
Mary takes another step closer and pulls open the jacket she had held tightly closed up until this point. Not a stitch lies beneath. John does step back, what little he can, startled and trying desperately not to show it. Judging from the small smile on Mary’s blood red lips and the amused gleam in her eyes, he is failing.
Sherlock raises his arms slowly, fingers splayed wide, arms bent at the elbow. He lifts his eyes to meet Moriarty’s and curls his lips into a self-satisfied smirk. That seemingly innocuous splash of water, not at all the same as the natural movement of the lake against the boat, is all he needs to hear. Moriarty grins up at Sherlock with cruel amusement, but falters as Sherlock’s expression grows more smug.
Sherlock and John have a heart-to-heart.
“John,” Greg begins, his voice filled with sincerity, “there are so many things you don’t know yet. A lot has changed.”
“Steady,” Moran warned, taking a step closer and puffing up his chest.
The showdown on The Crown continues.
“If you say so,” John replies warily. “What do you do in there? Your mind palace?”
But instead, damn you, Mary Morstan!!!! I wanted to include her shooting Sherlock, complete with "If you take another step, I swear I will kill you. No you won't, Mary." 0_0,  but wanted the twist of shooting John too. AHH!
Sherlock chuckles with him and opens the passenger door when they reach the car.
“Maybe,” Billy replies thoughtfully. He gives John a look and narrows his eyes. “You have met Sherlock?”
2. Sherlock knows the place and the boat, but now WHICH boat? We've already seen that he doesn't have much time. How is he going to figure it out?!?!? Gaaaarrrrghhh!
The two men continue to switch the mask back and forth all the way up until they burst out of the water. John coughs and gasps and covers his face with his hands immediately, trying to rub the irritants from his eyes. A spike of pain has him arching his back and gasping. Fortunately, Greg still has a hold of him so he does not sink into the water. When it subsides, John continues rubbing until he can open his red eyes, squinting against even the soft light of dusk. John’s first sight is his own wrists, bruised and bleeding, the rope-burned skin broken.
An important clue is found.
(infamous brow waggle)
“I believe you, Sherlock.”
“Look, John, I think we should talk about something else. This isn’t the place for that.”
* Will Giles get his hands on Ben too?
4. Can Sherlock get past Moriarty AND Moran to get in the water after John in time? If he does, will they jump in after him?
1) Now that the two have joined once again, what are their plans for foiling Moriarty?
“Read people?” John’s brow rose to his hairline. “What? You mean you can tell what a person is thinking?”
“Nothing happened, John.”
They are home again.
An old nemesis appears.
“I couldn’t sleep anyway. And besides…” he rises and steps around the desk, wrapping his long arms around John’s body, hands resting on his hips. “I like you in my bed.”
And now, back to playful and lovable Jane as I proudly present....wait for it....QUESTION TIME!
“I already know everything about you,” Sherlock says haughtily.
John’s throat was dry and his body covered with a sheen of sweat, but he was not about to move an inch from where they stood together. He was truly glad and even excited for the time to touch and study this man. The music swells and ebbs away with them swaying to it. A soft fade set the stage for the signature voice of Spandau Ballet to begin.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hi, Everyone! It's here and all I can say is, Enter John Watson.
**John talks about his time on the island, but nothing too graphic.**
I hope no one minds another chapter coming out so quickly. This is a shorter one and, sorry, no spoilers.
Love to you all and thanks for helping me feel so much better. Jane
With jaws dropped, all three sets of eyes sweep over to look at John and see him asleep on the bed. The covers are pulled up to his waist, his unharmed left arm laying over the blankets, his face peaceful in slumber. All in all, he also looks exactly the way he did before. All eyes return to Mycroft in question.
“Uh, we should,” he clears his throat and shifts in his seat. “We should talk.”
Instead of being angry at the slight, John eased up and huffed a laugh in spite of himself. He could feel the muscles in his body relaxing just as quickly as they had tightened and marveled for a moment at his reaction. He began to study Sherlock more intentionally.
“Has she always been so hostile toward me?”
“You’re okay?” John asks distractedly, still glancing around. “He’s not here?”
He pauses and looks at John with a wisdom John has not seen since his mother closed her eyes for the final time. He sighs deeply and his expression softens.
Hello, my friends! It is a beautiful Sunday and I am back on schedule. Let’s hope it stays that way. Lol. I just want to give a shout out to my wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. She, and all of you, challenge me to be better and keep going. Thanks and I love you all.
“Sentiment,” Sherlock’s tone is dismissive and John gives him a look. “After Victor, I determined that sentiment is a defect on the losing side.”
“I’d like to see you try to stop me,” his lips curl upward into a smirk as he watches John with a gleam in his eye.
Sherlock stands in his own spare bedroom, surveying everything to make sure he has not forgotten something. John is looking back at him and holding a dark blue t-shirt in his hands. Sherlock hopes it fits well enough. There is a pair of sweatpants in one of his drawers that is far too short for him, but he is quite certain it will fit John well enough. He just has to find them before they talk with the police in the morning. John does not know it yet, but Sherlock intends upon going with him to his apartment. He has already composed the all-team email stating he will not be in the stadium for morning workouts. He has also resolved to look over every inch of the apartment. Sherlock Holmes is no detective, but he will damn well solve this mystery so he can look the man who tried to murder John in the eye when he breaks his nose.
Did I mention last time I intend to post every Friday night? Did I also mention that if I don't make that, it'll be sometime during the weekend? Haha. Just made it this weekend.
John leaned forward to rest his forehead against Sherlock’s chest. He felt Sherlock’s breath falter and straightened again in a shot. He stared at Sherlock while internally berating himself for spoiling the moment. He swallowed hard, his mind searching for words and coming up empty. To his relief, their stilted movements grew more easy and relaxed as they listened to the lyrics drifting around them.
John finishes the last of his notes when there is a knock on his door. He grants entrance as he types the last few words and closes the file. He stands as Bloody Mary Morsten walks in, closing the door behind.
“Another time,” John breathes.
“Yes. I’m fine,” Sherlock replies, looking John in the eye and wishing he didn’t have to lie.
“Quite,” the coach replies curtly.
of his past relationships have been exactly the same for him. However, his brain has seized because Sherlock used the word relationship. He said it like it is something he wants, like it is already a thing, a real thing. He says it like last night was not a one-off as John had feared. Still with his track record, Sherlock cannot possibly mean that. Maybe he actually hasn’t put everything together yet, in which case it is John’s duty to tell him.
I wanted to post it at noon and it is now 2. So much for being on time. Haha.
3) What's Moriarty up to at this point? He must know John went home with Sherlock and that smacks of no resignation.
No. John dismissed that as soon as he thought it. That was not why he wanted to leave the club with Sherlock. John had no interest in making Jim jealous. He just wanted to spend more time with the fascinating consulting detective. My god, John wanted to learn all he could: his work, how he had conceived of it, how he met Greg, everything. John had never been so drawn to a person in his life and was more than a little pissed off to have met him tonight when he was here waiting for fucking Jim Moriarty to show up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Onward to the final chapter! There's so much to do, so much for John to remember. What, Jane, what will happen? I can already hear your questions, but... Instead of me asking them in true Deadpool fashion, why don't you ask them in your comments and propose answers? If you come up with something REALLY good maybe I'll tell you if you're right or not. Haha! And to think I didn't think I was in my usual playful mood tonight. Guess I was wrong.
“Don’t give me that look. Something is bothering you. It’s obvious. Now what is it?”
(And so many more for both of them too.)
We have emerged on the other side. How ya feelin'? Did you think I was going to end it? Oh, no no, my friends, not yet. There are still so many questions to answer. So many lose ends to tie up. So much sex to be had and, apparently, there is a following among you that wants John to do more ass worshipping.
Love, Jane
“Hey, no, no,” John grabbed Sherlock’s wrists so he could not disappear in the mass of people on the floor. John knew that Sherlock would make sure John never saw him again unless he wanted him to. Panic creeped into his voice as he continued. “It’s okay. I didn’t mean to… I just… Don’t go. Please.”
“Great. See you around,” John muttered, turning his back on them. He set off in an instant, a spring in his step and a grin on his face.
Greg laughs and John just cringes as they approach the boat.
“No man should ever make a lady wait,” The Woman lifts a seductive brow and clicks her teeth. “Even I am ravenous.”
Sherlock had meant to respond, but the words stuck in his throat. Home, John had said.
“Harry, if you’ve flooded your room again, I will not be responsible for my ac...tions,” Sherlock loses the vehemence in his last word as soon as he sees the figure at his door.
They stare at one another in cold, dark hate. A trail of blood slowly trickles downward from just above Sherlock’s eye. Moriarty leans down and licks it away from his ear, and then whispers.
John’s shoulders curl in a bit with the force of his feet landing on something hard and another jolt of pain vibrates through his body. He silently curses to himself, knowing it is only a flesh wound and not worth all the trouble it is causing. It is only the water and his wet clothes and the struggling that make it so painful.
I love you all! Stay safe.
arousal. John pins him to the wall with deadly serious eyes.
The elevator doors finally open at the lobby and all of its occupants exit. Sherlock follows the crowd without much thought until he catches the eye of a tall blonde looking his way. It is only a glance and Sherlock thinks nothing of it for a few steps. Then the feeling of cold realization hits him and he stops. It’s a threat, danger. Sherlock’s sharp eyes shoot back to the man, but he is gone. He looks around and sees nothing. Slowly, he makes his way to the hotel’s revolving doors, wishing for the first time that Greg had been able to come with them. Sherlock and John must keep an eye on the proceedings alone and Sherlock definitely has an uneasy feeling now.
**This chapter contains graphic depictions of violence.**
The case is solved, the villains captured, but what of our dynamic duo?
John’s brows raise and he looks at Sherlock with a hint of surprise on his face.
“...but do you have to tell everyone?”
John decides to go sightseeing and meets someone unexpected.
A wide grin instantly spreads across the coach’s face. Given the fact that John said he had never loved anyone he dated in the past, using the word so freely now and in this context makes Sherlock’s heart swell. He should not dare to hope; John truly cannot promise their relationship will be any different. Even so, Sherlock cannot help himself because maybe, just maybe it means John will realize his true feelings for him.
“John, I wasn’t expecting…” Sherlock begins while opening the door. John pushes in, effectively shoving him out of the way and shuts the door quickly. He looks Sherlock over as though he is looking for...what? Then he scans as much of the condo as he can see from where they stand, going so far as to take a few swift steps in to peer down the hall suspiciously. Befuddled, Sherlock watches his movements closely and takes a quick step back when John suddenly advances on him.
“Yes, sir,” the one with plugs in his stretched earlobes answers.
Sherlock was in the emergency room by the time John had entered the picture, stubbornly refusing to let anyone touch him. God, John had wanted to say something that day. He remembers how difficult it was to concentrate with miles of lean muscle, pale skin stretched over it elegantly. Sherlock was far too thin in those days.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock!” is all John gets out before his words are cut off by the water that swallows him whole.
And for this, the second to last chapter, BONUS LYRICS!
John watches Sherlock for a moment with the same scrutiny that Sherlock studies him. John seems to consider something and then looks resigned, sighing heavily. He sits up and raises a hand to cup the back of his own neck.
Much love (I hope you all don't mind the posting frequency) and thank you for reading. You are, as ever, fully loved and appreciated.
* Where is Greg? What is he doing? The poor man needs some time to himself, but will he get it or will someone interrupt it?
Let my love open the door to your heart
Love, Jane
John’s frown deepens. Hoover walks to his bedside as she speaks.
Not a term here, but when I refer to a triangle formation it is made of of three blockers. One faces the jammer and is the head, or top, of the triangle. The two remaining blockers stand side by side, facing the head of the triangle and facing away from the jammer. The head has a hand one of of each of their shoulders and they each have a hand on her shoulders. This keep the triangle tight and steady. The head shouts commands to the other two blockers because she can best see the jammer.
“Good.”
Poor, poor Greg. He's such a good man and doesn't deserve to be pulled into the life of a murderous bitch like Mary. Tears.
John’s eyes widened and he wondered how Sherlock could know which hospital. He did not ask, unwilling to interrupt the brilliant man before him.
“And you like to dance,” the corners of Sherlock’s mouth crooked up slyly.
“Until now,” Greg says, filling the silence after the other man has grown quiet. He takes a step closer and meets the coach’s sad gaze. “If there’s one thing I know it’s that life is about taking risks and it’s okay to be scared, but not to let it control us.”
Sherlock stares at her cooly. He runs a few scenarios in his mind palace as she continues to curse in a steady stream, becoming more and more creative as she goes. A second later and his eyes are focused again.
Please pay special attention to the tags when it comes out. Some of them will be changing and I'll be adding notes with the chapter summary. Also, there will definitely be more chapters to this part than what I have already indicated. I'm still not sure how many though.
Goddamn, he is so fucked.
John stares at him pointedly while he tapes the bandage down. Once he is finished, he packs up the first-aid kit and closes its latch. Sherlock considers returning it to the en suite, but knows it is the coward’s way out. He has never shrunk back from anything in his life. He is not going to start now. Instead, he meets John’s eyes and sees a fierce determination there that matches his own.
Sherlock stares back at him with a grim expression. However, a grin he cannot hide lurks beneath. The corners of his mouth begin turning up and he bites his lip to hold it in. John raises a brow in confusion as Sherlock’s head tilts up and laughter bursts from his mouth. His head falls back on the couch as he laughs and laughs, a sound from deep in his belly and he clutches at his stomach.
“Sherlock…” John’s face goes from anger to dismay in seconds. “Sherlock, wait.”
The fate of Greg Lestrade is revealed.
“The blonde fellow is gone on her,” he looks at his detective. Sherlock remains silent, so John leans in close and continues in a sly tone. “Just like you are on me.“
“You’ll stay here,” Sherlock states as if the decision has already been made and then immediately flinches. Did he learn nothing from his previous misstep? John Watson does not like to be told what to do. He tries for a lighter tone that suggests more than it commands. “I have a spare room.”
“Piss off,” he replied and John could not help but burst into laughter. Fortunately, a smile bloomed on Sherlock’s face as well, a glint of mischief and genuine amusement flickering through his eyes.
“Well, I hope that fits you,” he tells John. “I’m not exactly your size and your shoulders are a bit broader than mine.”
“It was no accident, Greg. That woman was on Harry’s case from the moment it started,” he says with certainty. “She was the target. If she had impacted the track with that force, she would have broken more than two bones. Janine was in both the right and wrong place.”
“Sherlock, are you all right?”
When he opens his eyes, John no longer sits on the bed before him. In fact, John is not even in the room. Sherlock’s eyes look from side to side sharply, his brow furrowing with worry. Is John even in the condo? Sherlock jumps to his feet just as the en suite door opens and the man in question appears in its frame. He still wears only boxer shorts and Sherlock feels his knees weaken a fraction. Flip.
Happy reading.
“Oh, god. That’s fantastic,” he covers his mouth and leans back in his chair. He is back to the table again in seconds and seems like he is leaning even further over his plate. “Did you ever get in trouble?”
“Surgery?!” Smacks queries in a hushed voice that sounds like a gasp.
I will only answer the last. I'm thinking through my many ideas for the next story, but am writing a oneshot in the meantime. It is my first and I hope it actually turns out to be fairly short, and still makes sense. As you all know, I can be pretty wordy. Lol. What, me? Plain Jane?? Surely not. Bahahaha!
John shakes his head, trying to clear it. Lunch was meant to be a pleasant respite with a friend when he had originally suggested it. There would be plenty of time later, after the bout when John is trying to sleep in his own hotel room to think about his stunted emotions. John huffs. Not emotions plural, just one. John has absolutely no problem getting angry or feeling jovial, sarcasm, friendship - all within easy reach, but love. He loved his parents, of course. Everyone does. He had loved Bill, but not that way.
“Not if I kill you first,” he cackles loudly in the detective’s face. “I should’ve done it already. You’re on borrowed time, Sherrrrrlock.”
Will John be okay?
“Why not?”
Later that night, Sherlock wakes to find John missing. He rubs his eyes and runs a hand through his curls, looking around the room.
“I should be the one apologizing, John. I am seldom able to deduce you so fully and when I finally could, I got carried away. It was stupid and an obviously very painful part of your past. I’m sorry,” Sherlock says in a rush, his voice flustered. He bites his lower lip and looks at John with nervous eyes.
“Fine,” the coach clears his throat. “I’m fine. Just doing the same.”
With that, both men were silent. John’s eyes were still wide with shock, his lips parted. He searched for something to say, but did not think he could speak if he tried. There was no way Sherlock could know all that, especially about Jim. He could not possibly...and yet, John believed him. He let it wash over him as he and Sherlock continued to shuffle their feet. They moved slowly, nothing like their energetic dancing earlier in the night. John considered Jim, thinking about things he had avoided for months. Staying in the relationship, such as it was, made no sense and was not fair to either of them. It was not what John wanted and yet, whenever John thought about the time Jim spent with Moran it angered him, but why? Jim deserved to be happy as much as John did and if that was with Moran, then so be it.
And I promise I'll answer all of the questions you still have as the story goes on.
“Right. Sherlock’s cases. You’re right,” his lips are a thin line and he bites his upper lip. His eyes dart away from John’s and he grabs his pint, hurriedly taking a pull.
Right.
John pays a little visit to the doctor.
My god, yes, woman! The sex holiday continues!
Who is in the flat?? (As if we didn't know.)
Ahhhhh.... I'm sitting back on my sunchair with a margarita on the rocks, no salt. Idk about you, friends, but I feel very refreshed after that case. Just like John said, no danger, no risks, no hospital. Just a good, honest case...of murder. Well, you know... That's not what I mean. Murder isn't honest, but Sylvia Piper was when she confessed. That woman has balls. I like her. It's too bad she's a killer. Anyway, I wanted to say that this one time - case wise - it was not entirely original. I borrowed a couple ideas from two of my favorite old episodes of Murder, She Wrote and adapted them. I was very excited about ice cream the evening I wrote this chapter and just HAD to include it in some way. The result is a giant walk-in freezer in the opulent office of a mafia king. LOL
Quiz Time!!
The warning was meant to help, but only succeeds in startling HardOn and increasing the effect of the hit. Her eyes wide in terror, HardOn flies right off her skates. It happens in a split-second, but the scene plays out in slow-motion for everyone in the stadium. HardOn hovers in mid-air with a curse on her lips before slamming right into Smacks, normal speed returning as 32 spirals into the mix. They skid out of bounds in a tangle of limbs and loud grunts, Smacks on the bottom and taking the full force of the other two skaters. Her scream echoes through the stadium at impact and she clutches at her calf as soon as they come to a stop.
Meanwhile, HardOn and company have formed an unbreakable wall for #32. She shifts this way and that, snapping her teeth as she bites at the air in an intimidating effort. Hella barks orders at HardOn, Smacks and Groot so they stay in her way.
But I digress. I know I spent a lot of time and chapters establishing Mary's character, even though we all knew she was going to be a villain. Why have I not done the same for Janine? Meh. There are more important things in this Part, so I wanted to jump right to the climax with her. I like Janine in the show, but could never get over the idea that she might actually be Moriarty's sister. After all, what did Magnussen have on her? He made reference to it, but didn't state anything specific. Entonces, I HAD to make her the evil avenging sister. Ha! And since nobody can get close to Sherlock, what better way to worm her way than to take a job at the surgery? Nyeh nyeh nyeh.
John presses his lips into a thin line and for a moment, Sherlock thinks he might tell him what a stubborn asshole he is. But the anger and frustration quickly fade from his face, making way for a broad grin and bright eyes. Sherlock could look at those blue eyes for a hundred years and it still wouldn’t be enough.
Greg’s eyes widen as he takes a step back, nearly running afoul of the desk again. Sherlock is unrecognizable. Gone is the confident and calculating derby coach. He looks pale and vulnerable and much younger than Greg has ever seen. The GM knows in an instant he was never meant to see this side of the coach. This side he shows only to Molly.
She can only nod a pained grimace and then let her mouth fall open in a silent scream as pain racks her body. At John’s advice, she tries to keep her body limp as he and the two men lift her onto the stretcher and strap her in. She still bites off moans with every movement and looks more than a little grateful once secure. John turns to Sherlock while she is being wheeled away.
I know what you’re thinking. “Awwwwww, Jane, thank you. Thank you. We finally got the happy ending we’ve craved for so long.”
(See the end of the chapter for
3. And, btw, how is THAT going to work? Sherlock is right to have a mild freak out over that one.
“What? Like on Scooby Doo?” John snorts. “ ‘Looks like we have ourselves another mystery’.”
“If you’ll pardon me, sir,” Riley observes as he heads for John and Sherlock, producing another set of handcuffs as he goes. He nods back at Greg. “This is Greg Lestrade, General Manager of the Rock City Rollers.”
“My height, blonde, brown eyes and fair skin. He was wearing a black turtleneck and sport coat. I couldn’t see anything else through all the people. He had this look in his eye, like he knew something about me or someone I hold dear. And smirking, but more of a sneer. He’s dangerous, John. I don’t know how, but he is involved in all of this.”
“Good night, Watson.”
“Shh. Shh. Don’t, Sherlock. It’s okay. I’m right here,” John whispers. “It’s going to be all right.”
“We’re done here.”
“There are two teams in Detroit?”
“Indeed,” Sherlock admits after a beat. “Mary is one of our more aggressive players and not exclusively on the track. I’ve been expecting it.”
John’s brows rise to his hairline and his lips stretch into a beautiful grin. God, those lips. Sherlock wants to nibble and lick them until John is boneless, completely undone, taken apart piece by gorgeous piece. He wants to feel them move against his own mouth and his neck and his shoulder. He wants to see them wrapped around his rock hard cock.
Upon their arrival at the hotel, the ladies head up to their rooms to stow their gear and meet back in the bar for a drink or two.
“Yeah, me too,” John smiles. “We should do it again.”
As Greg complies, Sherlock turns to face the police boat fully.
Well, I'm working on chapter 3. I'll get it out as soon as I can.
Sherlock raps his fingers on the desk one by one in a distinct pattern. He glances at his notes. At the clock. Back to his notes.
It has been a long time since John Watson has considered his flatmate simply a friend.
“Since I was five,” Sherlock replies. “And Molly plays the cello. Our parents had us take lessons together.”
“Okay. So...dinner?”
* What about this Templeton Morris fellow? Will he come back into play?
Good luck and good night.
But guess who didn't drown...
“Yes,” John grinned up at him, pulling back a bit as the song came to an end, “of course. That was extraordinary.”
They gaze at one another wordlessly, but a thousand words pass between them silently. John’s heart beats faster, thrumming in his ears, which the monitor reveals cheerfully. Damn machine. He resists the urge to roll his eyes and keeps his attention on Sherlock. He doesn’t remember this man, but knows his voice. He hears it in his mind and in his sleep. It helps him, comforts him, shows him the way. Now, as John sits face to face with the man it belongs to, he feels comfortable and safe. Everything he doesn’t know, all the black panes of glass, none of it seems to matter when he is with this man.
“No one is meant to see him, John,” Sherlock taps the end of his nose with a single finger.
“Sherlock Holmes, their coach,” Riley gestures to Sherlock and John, standing over them now. “The new Dr. Watson and I believe that is James Moriarty, the coach for the Demons.”
John has night terrors.
“What?” John looks to his shoulder to see Sherlock’s long fingers, probing around gently to get an idea where the wound is. “Ah, shit.”
* Where the bloody hell is Greg??  What or who is delaying him? Is it Sally? HAS she left the side of the angels as Purrfect suggested?
Hello, Everyone! I'm so sorry for the delay in releasing this chapter. It wasn't originally in the manuscript, but I felt it had to be added. Between being stupid busy and ending up in the ER again (eye roll), it took a while to write and edit AND the first section nearly killed me. God! I love this chapter though and hope all of you agree that it was worth the wait. I'm hoping to get back to my usual posting frequency now. Oh, and no spoilers. Heh heh.
“Oh,” John repeated playfully with a quick raise of his brows. “Is that restaurant still open? I’d love to hear about your cases.”
John is completely breathless, his body boneless, save his fingers gripping the detective’s soft curls. Sherlock looks back at John with those dark, sly eyes and smiles again before he begins bobbing and licking and sucking. His lips start to make the most obscene noises as they move over John’s cock and, once again, the doctor nearly loses it. So overcome by desire and pleasure and emotion, John pulls on the curls clutched in his fingers. It isn’t a hard tug, but Sherlock’s body goes entirely rigid and his mouth stills instantly - all things drawing to an immediate halt.
Blocker - a skater who tries to prevent the jammer from skating around the track and scoring points.
“John, please.”
“You don’t have to stay alone,” Sherlock replies in a quiet tone, not to disturb the couple. John lifts his head to look at him fully. They can both feel exhaustion ebbing and flowing from the other like the tide.
“No one should ever keep you waiting, John,” Sherlock said with conviction. John tucked his chin, turning his head slightly, but kept his eyes on Sherlock. A crease formed on his forehead and his brow furrowed as he tried to wrap his head around this man. He clearly knew far more about John than John did of him, either from Greg or his own deductions. It was also clear that he was very keen on spending more time with John. The doctor was both dumbfounded and thrilled by this knowledge.
Join me again, hopefully sooner rather than later, for the next chapter. Will there be any answers? Hmmm.
“I wish you could come back with us,” he mutters.
As he stares at Sherlock, a tinge of anger sneaks onto his face and his voice has an edge when he speaks.
Molly’s strategy and intellect closely match that of their coach, making them a perfect force to lead the team to its place as number one in the nation. It is a title the Detroit Rock City Rollers once held for ten years from the late 1970s into the 1980s. One the team’s owner never thought they would see again after The Fall. One they regained when they were revolutionized by a budding young coach called Sherlock Holmes.
“Sherlock, I’ve known you for ten years, it’s hard not to pick up on...wait. Why can’t he know?”
Sherlock jerks back as though he has been slapped in the face. He instantly recalls a conversation they had about the Demons and their coach, James Moriarty. His ‘arch enemy’ Sherlock had called him and John had laughed.
Moriarty suddenly scrambles in Sherlock’s arms, kicking at him and hitting any place he can reach. Sherlock holds fast, but the man lurches forward when he cannot break free and the momentum slides them both closer to the steering column. Moriarty reaches as far as he can, straining against Sherlock’s arms and closes his fingers around the flare gun.
“Everything looks good and she’ll be released tomorrow morning,” he rushes to say. “I thought you’d want to know.”
Btw, I can't remember just now who brought this up and I apologize for that. My mind fails me, but I want to say it was Purrfect. Anyway, "These questions and many others will be answered on the next episode of...SOAP"!!!! It finally came to me! That show was hilarious! I only saw it in reruns long after Katherine Helmond had been Mona on Who's the Boss. I couldn't believe how many celebs were on Soap back before they were famous. I thank you for this trip down memory lane, and if that isn't what you were talking about, I'm afraid I have no hope of figuring it out. I can't think of anything but Soap now.
“He is very opinionated,” Billy laughs, “and has one hell of a stubborn streak. He can be a handful.”
“It’s still sentiment.”
On a housekeeping note, you'll note that the number of chapters has changed. There's just too much in the next chapter and I had to split it in two. That said, only two chapters left. AH! Thank you all for riding out Part 3 with me. I have treasured all the love and support, comments and kudos, and couldn't do this without them. You all are my life blood. (So are Sherlock and John, of course.)
“How did you… You see people, right. How do I keep forgetting that?” John smiles and then winces when he moves his arm.
“Not even a little,” John laughs quietly and watches his flatmate closely as he moves his hands over John’s feet carefully.
“What?” he asks incredulously.
“No, Sherlock, I’ve already imposed enough.”
Hello, friends! I hope that was as exciting to read as it was to write. This chapter was a fun one.
John’s breathing normalizes within a minute and Sherlock should really get off of him. He knows he should. He absolutely cannot take advantage of their close proximity and position, but a war rages in his mind, each side battling for control.
Under the slight delay of paying for the cab ride, John walks into the flat in question and finds the detective at a table with his back to the door.
Sherlock finds himself smiling back. Neither one says a word. The two men simply face one another, smiles inexplicably growing into grins. Sherlock could stay this way all night and all day tomorrow too. He would love nothing more than to have John as a house guest for any length of time, sharing stories and jokes.
Thank you again, all of you for all your support and love. Knowing you all are out there and loving my idiots makes me heart sing!
“I want to finish the film,” Sherlock replied decisively and then with a wicked smile, the tip of his tongue sliding along his lips. “I want to rub your feet.”
God, it was amazing. Caught up in the excitement, John’s mind flew forward to more nights with this man dancing and talking about his cases. So distracted by his own thoughts and simultaneously focused on their movements was John that he did not notice how close they had come to the edge of the dance floor until the crowd surged and pushed them against the wall.
“Dinner?”
Moriarty is pissed.
“Doesn’t he?”
Those two words catch Sherlock completely off guard and his gaze locks in on John. They share the most sincere of looks across the table. John’s deep blue eyes sparkle, even in the low light of the restaurant. A scheme by hotel managers to appeal to couples who want a romantic evening away from prying eyes. Even those who do not seek out the experience find themselves caught up in the atmosphere. As he continues to gaze into those amazingly expressive, gorgeous blue eyes, Sherlock decides he rather likes it himself.
“He got shot,” John says flatly. “In the shoulder. The medics couldn’t get to him for the gunfire and he bled out. Didn’t have a chance. His parents told me. Came to my flat to give me a few of Bill’s things. He’d wanted me to have them.”
What John's thinking about after the row.
You’ll probably move right through me on my way to you
As the river flows gently to the sea
I know I usually talk about the chapter I just posted, but WOW there are so many visceral reactions to the previous chapter. I have definitely felt that way about some of the stories I've read over the last couple years, but I never thought anyone would feel that way about something I wrote.  Thank you always for your support and honesty (especially to Sherly for laying your feelings bare). You all may not believe me, but every one of you makes all the difference to me. I can't help but delight in it every time I see the kudos and hits, or read the comments, and it all makes me want to post more. RIGHT NOW. THIS MINUTE. Sometimes it's really hard to hold off a couple of days.
“You’re very lucky to have each other,” John says and Sherlock realizes he must have answered yes. He zooms out a bit to see a somewhat distant and sad expression on John’s face. “It’s a precious thing.”
Halfway into the meal, John wets his lips and leans forward in his chair. He glances down at his plate and then meets Sherlock’s eyes.
“Steady on.”
“What?” John starts. “No, you don’t have to do that.”
“Come on,” John laughs and pulls him to the sofa.
Yeah!
“John, would you do me the great honor of joining me in my bedroom for the evening?”
“Why do you insist he be miserable? That he be alone?” John takes an aggressive step forward. “Because you are? Maybe he wants something else.”
“Fine,” he says finally. “How can I help?”
“You okay to climb up?” Greg asks him, glancing from John to the ladder and sizing him up.
“Already done,” John tells him. “I’m bunking at Sherlock’s.”
“It’s fine. Just leave it. I need to get this bandage on and then you will tell me everything that happened.”
“Absolutely.”
“So?”
Sherlock lifted John’s hand high to draw him in and used his other hand to guide John into a quick turn so his back ended up flush against the front of Sherlock’s body. John pulled Sherlock’s hand down and caught hold of the other one too. As the music swelled, John rested their hands on his hips and they ground together, bending their knees a bit and inching down lower. John tilted his head back to rest on Sherlock’s shoulder, closed his eyes and nearly moaned.
“Why, John?” Sherlock is suddenly on his knees before the bed at eye level with John. His voice is tense as he tries to find anything at all in the wing he has marked for John that would warrant such an attack. “Is there someone from Anaheim who would want to hurt you? Do you have any enemies?”
“Yes, of course she can,” Sherlock scowls impatiently, “but I expected to be consulted first.”
2) What if Sherlock tries to talk John out of it? Will John hold firm or give in?
“Not at all,” John’s lips curve into a fond smile. “It’s just fine.”
“Yes, alone,” he confirmed with a good-natured nod. “I don’t do romantic liaisons or spend meaningful moments with people.”
“You can tell all that by just looking at someone?” John’s lips parted in a smile of disbelief.
“Yes. Let me show you,” Sherlock turned his chin and looked out at the people around them. “Look at that woman at the bar.”
Sherlock leans forward a little to look at John straight on. He nudges John’s thigh where it is still nestled under the blanket and the doctor raises his eyes to look at Sherlock from beneath long lashes. Sherlock wets his lips and inhales a silent breath, his pulse quickening slightly.
1a. Will Sherlock talk himself out of it?
So I decided to go with the end of the chapter, the conversation between Sherlock and Greg. When I first typed it up, I thought it was really clunky and wasn’t sure I liked it, but when I read through it again and again, it fell into place. I hope you all think so too and get my choice of song.
“I know,” she answers with a small smile. She spoons up some ice cream and brings it to her mouth. “So what about Uncle Greg? Does Daddy ‘member him?”
Who beat up Sherlock?? (As if we didn't know.)
John discovers what Sherlock's favorite movie is and is quite surprised.
Until then, keep your stick on the ice.    -- and yes, I'm sad the NHL suspended the season, but I get it :(
“Oh, longer than that, dear,” she laughs. “How do they say it over there? He’s ‘bloody brilliant’?”
Billy leans close and stares into John’s eyes. John follows suit, anxious to hear Billy’s next words. Knowing the risks, how could this man keep such a secret?
Hello, hello. I'm in a bit of a mood tonight and feel like asking Deadpool 2 style questions again. My apologies for not giving you any notes of substance. Instead, I'll say...
“Please, allow me,” Sherlock whispers in a rough tone. John looks at him without blinking. The very tip of his tongue darts out to lick his lips. It lasts only a millisecond, but the sight of it sends Sherlock’s stomach to flipping and makes him weak in the knees.
“Burn you?”
“Sir,” Officer Riley joins them briskly.
“It’s all right,” John tells him, eyes half-lidded with weariness. “The bullet just grazed me. It’s only a flesh wound.”
“No, it’s not about the bathtub,” John answers as he thinks What about the bathtub?, but doesn’t ask because he does not want to be sidetracked. He squares his shoulders and clears his throat. “There’s something much more important and we have to talk about it.”
John’s eyes widened slightly, intrigued with both the mystery and the man himself. John’s tongue darted over his bottom lip and he noticed Sherlock’s eyes flick to them momentarily before explaining his deductions.
“Yeah, okay,” he says as though convincing himself. “Right. You’re right.”
As a friend said, "John cuddled him! John fucking...[cuddled him]!" He loves him so much and Sherlock knows it. Sherlock heard him say it, but just can't believe John would still love him if he knew everything about their past. And yet, every time John learns something new, something big, he has not turned away from Sherlock. I mean, remembering your best friend destroyed you by faking his own death is huge! Add his sister being your shooter, nearly killing you. WTF, Watson. Why aren't you running away?
“My cases?” John questioned. He had not expected that. His profession did not seem nearly as interesting as the detective’s.
“John…”
“No.”
“So Molly started living her dream. What did you do?”
“I’m only protecting him, Dr. Watson.“
“Oh my god,” he rolls his eyes before fixing Greg with a glare and pointing an accusatory finger. “We must find out all we can. If he touches anyone on the team…”
“Looks good,” John nods. They discuss the logistics a bit more and then both sip their forgotten drinks, satisfied with the plan. That is until John gives Sherlock that look. It’s the look John wears when he knows there is something else on Sherlock’s mind. His ability to know Sherlock so well is infuriating, especially when John himself remains a mystery so much of the time.
“I was taking a look at her knee. It was a follow-up visit weeks after to make sure it had healed well. She went very quiet when I asked her how it felt. I knew there was something on her mind, but I didn’t say anything,” he shrugs. ”I knew she would tell me when she was ready.”
In the meantime, happy reading and have fun thinking about what the future holds for these two lovebirds.
“What the hell is wrong with you?” his deep baritone booms while not actually raising beyond normal volume.
Sherlock and company pay Mycroft a visit.
Looking at the newspaper on the counter, John reads a quick article. He glances at the kettle and then stills, noticing for the first time how quiet the flat is. He flips off the stove and steps out into the hall, looking toward the sitting room. Sherlock is most likely there, pouting after John’s abrupt departure, but he would expect to hear violin music rather than silence. Of course, Sherlock could just as easily be in his mind palace, but something doesn’t feel right as John starts down the hall cautiously.
At last, he reaches the top and throws a hand over the side of the boat, grabbing its top with an iron grip. He is
Terms:
“Oh?” John switches to doctor mode, immediately forgetting his unease. “What happened?”
John furrows his brow in determination and continues to work his hands within the ropes. He’ll be damned if he goes down without a fight. After a few seconds, John shakes his head and lets out a few bubbles to combat the burning sensation in his chest. Soon his lungs will feel like they are exploding and taking a breath will be the only way to combat it, whether John wants to or not.
John trails off and bites his lip. Sherlock knows what he was going to say. John lets his lips part as he searches Sherlock’s eyes.
Welcome back! I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. This was one of the bigger cliffhangers in the series and I know if I'd been reading it I would've shit a brick when Part 6 ended the way it did. I may like to torture you, but I don't like to keep you waiting. If that makes any sense. That doesn't make any sense. :D I'm surprised I feel this silly and jokey, since my college team lost today by two points. Two effing points. But let's not dwell on that. Our boys are far more important and I have a promise for you.
“He can’t be too happy about the delay your kicking his ass has caused.”
“Shit,” John repeats. “It’s after midnight. We should get out of here.”
Sherlock’s mind snaps to attention at that, but his expression shows nothing. John knows! He has noticed! Does he know it happens every night or believe it's once of twice a week? In any case, the detective decides to ignore the comment for now in favor of thinking it through later.
Back in the living room of his suite, Sherlock hangs his long coat and scarf in the closet by the door. He pulls off his suit coat as he goes to the kitchen, tossing it on the bar that separates the kitchenette from the rest of the room. He removes a small bottle of wine from the fridge and takes a glass from the cabinet. Sherlock likes a good white wine and only if it is colder than what most think is appropriate. This wine is acceptable, he concludes after a sip.
John looks back at him and then shakes his head.
Hey, oh, I go so-oh-oh so-oh-oh-lo
“I’m sure she did,” Sherlock snickers.
“What?” John shakes himself back to the here and now, only to see both Sherlock and the guide looking at him curiously. He blinks once or twice, trying to devise from Sherlock’s face what might have been said.
“I’d love to.”
“I couldn’t save the one that mattered most,” John whispers. He turns his head away, casting his eyes at the floor below the flat screen as though he cannot face Sherlock. He can still see the shine of tears in John’s eyes in spite of it. “I’m sorry. That’s a terrible thing to say.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Since it’s just the two of us, I think you should watch the bout from here. It’s close enough to our box if needed and you will be able to see anything I can’t,” Sherlock tells him while pointing at different locations on the map.
He steps forward only to stop dead when he feels a knife blade at his back. He rolls his eyes and turns his head slowly to see Moriarty standing behind him with a smile on his face.
“The pain. Is it bad? Does one wound hurt more than the other?”
“What?” she steps back to give him more room, completely thrown off by his remark. Mary peers down to see what he is referring to. “Oh, that’s nothing. Happened a few days ago in practice. What
Oh, jeez. I have been a little vicious with those questions, now haven't I? Must be feelin' a little edgy. But...I do not apologize. 😈 Really I'm just in an odd mood this evening. Odd? Now? Go figure. Given that, I believe I'll leave you all with some my favorite DP words:
How will Sherlock survive?
Anyway, I'm going to start us out with some key terms mentioned in this chapter. I'll continue to add more in coming chapters as needed.
“You’re welcome,” John clears his throat, speaking quietly.
“No. I mean,” he clears his throat with a little cough. “It’s certainly not what I expected.”
All I can say is... Bonus lyrics!
“He will not succeed.”
That said, cue dramatic music. DA DAAAAAA!!!!
“Good work, Riley,” Budreau replies, nearly sounding sincere. “Everyone’s wrapping up here. Get ready to move out.”
“Careful, Watson,” Billy says in a quiet, warning tone. “There are some things one should stay away from. Leave it be.”
John snapped his mouth closed quickly, unsure of how long his lips had been parted in wonder and awe. Too long judging by the smirk the man gave him with that sidelong glance as he continued to sway his hips. God, he did it with such skill it was obscene and John could not stop himself staring. He swallowed hard, his mouth suddenly dry, and took a sip of scotch. John had seen this man here before quite a few times and he had seen him go into the back offices with Greg almost every time. He had even seen them leave together and yet, John had never asked Greg about it and Greg had not volunteered. John had simply not thought it any of his business. Now John wondered why he had never stopped to consider this one exception to Greg’s rule.
Sherlock meets his eyes. Truthfully, he has not. But he has come close. Sherlock readies a new piece of gauze and wets it with peroxide. When he is ready, he moves the towel aside and leans in closer. John’s body twitches at Sherlock’s first touch and again periodically as he cleans the wound. It is much deeper than the other one and very similar with that odd shape. Sherlock furrows his brow, trying to place it.
Mycroft is an ass.
“He will not be allowed in again.”
And love!
“Jason Bourne?” John quips with a delectable smile on his face. “Will you criticize it?”
Suddenly John lunges at him and Sherlock yelps. They topple over on the couch in a mess of limbs and giggles.
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
“It’s me again,” he smiles widely and says in his sing-songy voice. “Hi.”
“I did, yeah. There weren’t a lot of kids in my neighborhood, so I spent most of my time on my own. That’s how my parents discovered my aptitude for knowledge,” John dabs at the corners of his mouth with a napkin. Sherlock licks his own lips and his eyes fall to John’s for just a moment. The barest hint of a moment is all he allows himself and his damn stomach flips again. He sighs quietly.
5) And, mostly importantly, did HardOn beat John to the chocolate frosteds? Lol.
John’s eyes snap open again when a third lubricated finger joins the other two. He grits his teeth and swallows the pained groan in his throat. He will not give Jim the satisfaction of making a sound. Instead, he glares daggers at the man and growls a command.
“She always takes turns tightly and comes in on the left,” Sherlock tells her. “Visibly brace yourself for the hit she wants you to expect and then make her miss. Hella and Smacks will pick her up. Groot, work on their blockers so The Woman can get through.” He looks around the circle at the face of each skater, the calm that only a plan can bring in his eyes. Each of their expressions changes in turn to reflect steady certainty where there had been chaos.
“No, you are definitely not an experiment,” John
John stared at him, eyes shining with unanswered questions. The smirk he got and the tilt of the man’s head, curls bouncing in the direction down the bar. Greg. Of course, Greg. He must have told this mysterious man John’s name. The doctor tilted his head as well, unable to look away from that angular face now framed by soft, dark curls as their owner tilted his head upright again. Suddenly John’s heart skipped a beat as his mind caught up with the conversation. Did that mean this dazzling beauty had asked Greg about him?
I look forward to seeing you all again. What? What's that, Jane? You have another story in the works? Hmmmm?? And what IS this story? When can we expect it? As Michael Palin's Mr. Heinrich Bimler put it, "Soon, baby."
I really hope you all loved this chapter! I'll try to get the others out as soon as I can, but I'm heading into a busy weekend.
“Yeah, right, I know. You read people, but it’ll be my voice and my perspective. There’s value in that that your method ignores.”
Sherlock and John fans: When will they finally talk about what happened to John?
Love, Jane
“My name is Sherlock,” that voice continued and John fought with himself not to melt on the spot.
“Christ, I need to put more energy into finding a permanent flat,” John declares with humor in his voice. “This is a bloody palace.”
“He cut it damn close though,” John continues, his voice barely above a whisper. “I thought I was imagining things when I saw the torch.”
Sherlock walks into the bathroom and flicks on the light. He turns on the water and splashes some on his face. Once, twice. He buries his face in a soft, plush towel and holds it for a moment. Sherlock is exhausted. He always is after a flight. He does not like flying and every muscle in his body tenses to remind him of it. He can never rest his mind either, scenario after scenario rushing from room to room of his mind palace, giving him not a moment’s peace. John tried to sit next to him the first flight of the season, but Sherlock did not want him to witness his quiet panic so he convinced him to sit elsewhere. He told John he liked having time to himself when, in truth, Sherlock wanted nothing more than to have John by his side forever. After that, John did not try sitting by Sherlock again.
Love, Jane
Finally, #32 breaks free from her own wall of blockers and skates away furiously. Suddenly unoccupied, Smacks throws a skillful shot at the trio of Ravens readying to block out The Woman and creating enough of a scuffle that The Woman weaves between them all a second time. Groot forms up with Hella and HardOn readying for another attack by 32, who started building speed as soon as she broke away from the pack.
2. Is John right about the risk to Sherlock now that he's living with him?
going back in the water. He heaves himself up so his head pops up over the side and he can see in the boat. The sight that greets him is a rather disheveled Sherlock, with hands in the air, standing over a prostrate and tightly bound James Moriarty. John’s eyes widen at the blood spattered across Sherlock’s shirt, but he quickly determines that it is not his.
A loud voice echoes through the stadium and pulls him from his thoughts. Sherlock’s eyes fly open to see the skaters loitering around the track and drinking from their water bottles. The music was turned off after the last workout rotation and no longer blares across the track, marking the beginning of drills. Sherlock typically leads the drills and scrimmages, but the ladies are more than capable of regulating themselves when he is pulled away. Or delves too far into his mind palace, as the case may be.

So I got up and followed her to the floor
“What now? A movie?” he asks, truly baffled about what to do next.
I'm almost finished with the next chapter already, so it'll be up soon. Thank you all. You are shafts of gold when all around is dark.
The cry set John’s body alight with an unexpected energy. He stepped right into Sherlock’s personal space and they popped together, their bodies skirting the line of what was appropriate in public. They turned and leaned and undulated in unison, turning up the heat as they did so. Sherlock dropped in front of John with his back to the doctor and rose again thrusting his perfect ass against John’s groin. John moaned out loud. The sound disappeared into the noise of the club and the music, but Sherlock heard. His head was cocked to the side so he could watch John with a saucy smirk as he continued to grind against him. John placed his hands on Sherlock’s hips and pulled him tight. They swayed in tandem as they worked their way across the floor. Sherlock’s back was hot against John’s chest, his hands aflame where they rested on John’s.
The whole incident makes him sick to his stomach, but the kitchen is the worst. The thought of a murderer holding John close to his own body from behind, a most vulnerable position indeed. The image stirs within Sherlock an emotion he isn’t sure how to process. Fear and protectiveness, like he was wronged somehow right along with John. It does not make sense. John is not his to protect and yet, there it is, front and center. Sherlock cannot ignore it or his feelings for John. He has tried, of course, since the moment he walked into Greg’s office to meet the doctor. Even though there are no organizational rules preventing them from exploring an attraction, there is still an obstacle and it is the most important. Sherlock’s own heart. He allowed himself to be vulnerable with Victor and paid the price. Recovering from it would have been impossible had he not thrown himself into coaching and derby. He had vowed never to be in that situation again. Since then, Sherlock has never felt the desire to open that door in his mind palace, not even a crack.
Fear flashes across Sherlock’s features and a chill runs down his neck, spreading into his veins until he can feel it in his fingertips. Did he just profess love for John? No. He tries to deny it, but the proof of it appears around every corner he turns within his mind palace.
“Go on,” John prompted casually, trying only a little to hide his excitement at what Sherlock might say next. His words seemed to settle something inside of Sherlock and he continued.
The team goes to Baltimore for an away.
“Oh my god,” he murmurs.
“This is
“So, the stadium,” John begins, “you’ve been there before.”
What's going to happen next??  0_0
“Space,” he says as they enter a large bedroom with a vaulted ceiling. John stops about ten steps in and looks around the room in apprehension. Meanwhile, Sherlock drops his hand and continues walking to a door on the far wall.
Sherlock visits John's room to explain his feelings.

“I punched him.”
Also, BLOODY MYCROFT!!! And isn't Dr. Hoover the coolest badass ever? EVAH! Even though she doesn't have a huge part in this story, she's one of the favorite female characters I've written to date. What did you all think of John's final words? Isn't it just the icing on the cake and yet, totally leaves you wondering what will happen next?
Da Da Daaaaaaa!
Section three deals largely with a frightened post-rape John, in case that interaction is also too much. Know that you will miss character development.**
“Sorry to have kicked you out of bed.”
Striding up to the house, he takes in its white siding and dark green shutters. Many of the windows have boxes containing bright red poppies and small daisies. It’s like it was pulled right from Wizard of Oz and deposited in a Detroit suburb. John steps onto the porch where there is a single wicker chair sitting just to the left of the door and suddenly visions of the stereotypical old man perched on his porch with a shotgun, yelling at children to get the fuck off his lawn pop into his mind. A small smile teases at the corners of his mouth as he directs his attention to the door again and hesitates before knocking. He has no idea what to expect from this man. John glances at the chair again and then knocks firmly. The door opens almost immediately to reveal a man with greying hair and a smile that lights up his whole face. He looks almost joyful. And the epitome of Mr. Rogers, tan cardigan and all.
“She you were his weakness and I was yours.”
Aahhhhh. I'm shivering now, are you? Yikes! Needless to say, the next chapter is going to be rough. I'll try not to be late with it, but I can't promise to go easy on you. I have a reputation to uphold. Heh heh heh.
Sherlock licks his lips and begins to imagine what it would feel like to touch John’s lips. What must they taste like and how would they feel against his own? Or on his collarbone, his shoulder. Sherlock stutters back, staring at John with wide eyes. He absolutely was
(See the end of the chapter for
“Me too,” John replies quietly. A feeling of deep contentment slowly, steadily fills every inch of Sherlock’s body and his lips turn up. He feels lighter, tranquil, and like he was never meant to be anywhere or with anyone other than this man.
The remainder of lunch is spent talking through everything they spoke of the night before in the hotel bar. Their former conversation pushed aside in favor of discussing the bout plan with Greg, much to John’s chagrin. As much as he likes the GM and knows hashing out the plan with him is the right thing to do, John wants to know what Sherlock was going to say. Hen cannot get it off his mind.
“I understand,” John finally says in a quiet voice. “It’s never felt right to me either.”
Sherlock squats and opens the cabinet beneath the sink. He pulls out a mid-sized sand pail. It bears the image of the Grinch from the 2018 remake. Molly had begged Sherlock to go with her and they gave him the bucket as soon as he entered the theater. It was some promotional thing and he was the umpteenth person. Dull. He would have refused had they not filled it with popcorn. Sherlock could eat his weight in popcorn.
He pulls on his jacket and closes the office door after they are both through. The two men walk side by side down the hall. Having regained his typical ease and confidence, Sherlock looks sideways at John with a smirk on his lips.
“The ravioli al forno is very good,” Sherlock offers. John’s eyes rise from the menu to gaze at him. “The alfredo sauce is legendary.”
“I’m fine, Sherlock. All superficial.”
Completely taken aback by the joke, John just stares for a full ten seconds while Sherlock opens the med kit. He watches as the tall man sifts through its contents in search of peroxide, gauze dressings and bandages. Sherlock observes him from the corner of his eye, wondering if John is actually going to sit down and let him tend to his wounds or needs to be prompted again. One thing, he sure as hell is going to explain how he was hurt and why he is running around Detroit in a t-shirt and underpants. Not that Sherlock is complaining, of course, but he is hardly going to tell John that.

Mycroft pays his brother a visit.
* Has Sherlock drowned? Will they be pulling him out of the water or dragging it for his body? HOLY SHITBALLS!
“Hey. Sorry,” he says quickly, noticing Sherlock’s distress. “I needed the loo and I didn’t want to interrupt.”
“His memory loss is substantial?” Sherlock phrases it in a question to make her feel more comfortable telling him. It seems to work as a bit of the tension visibly drains from her body.
Thank you all for reading and loving. You all mean so much to me. I love writing. I'd write no matter what, but knowing that I'm bringing joy to others is the greatest reward. Thank you all.
“Nonsense. My calculations and strategies for upcoming bouts are coming along perfectly,” he told her around a mouthful of chocolate chip cookie dough. “Besides, there is nothing in this world that is more important to me.”

“You really cut to the quick, don’t you?”
Omg, I just learned how to put emojis in this! 😂 I won't overuse it, I promise. 😈
“Oh god, yes. I’d love to,” John blurted, lifting his hands from his hips and holding them out slightly, not sure how to contain the ecstatic energy within his body. John watched as Sherlock did the impossible: His smile grew and warmed into true fondness. John’s heart gave a squeeze as they began to walk down the pavement together, the sound of music fading away as they went.
* So now that Janine has come out of the woodwork, what if there's another Moriarty sibling? Hmmm? Wouldn't that just be a kick in the pants?
As always, these questions only touch the surface of all you could be asking. Feel free to put voice to more. I'm all ears. In the meantime, please be patient with me for the next chapter. I promise I’ll get things back on schedule. Thank you all so much for your love and support. I love each one of you and you all being joy to my heart. I'm so glad to have the opportunity to continue sharing this with you.
She returned her gaze to him and smiled broadly. It was his turn to look away, cheeks pink.
A wave of panic descends throughout Sherlock’s mind palace when John disappears over the side of The Crown with a loud splash.
Sherlock’s brows furrow over narrowed eyes. His mind instantly begins testing and weighing every possible scenario.
And there you have it, friends. How can two blokes be so lucky and so unlucky at the same time? One of these days, they'll stop being kidnapped, nearly drowned, shot, strangled, stabbed, and all the rest of it. BUT not until they retire. At least, not in my book. Heh heh heh.
“Make sure they’re all in their rooms by midnight. We have to be at the airport at nine tomorrow morning.”
Just where is this prickly island anyway?
“Typical,” John continues, frowning and feeling grumpy. “You haven’t heard a thing I’ve said. And you’re looking at me like…”
She said, baby let’s go
“HardOn, look out!” Smacks shouts just before 32 slams into her as hard as she can.

Enjoy, friends!
John’s moves intensified as the verse came to an end and he began to mouth the words in anticipation of the chorus, giving Sherlock a cheeky grin as he did it. The man matched his expression and movements beat for beat.
But Sherlock has no words. He has no idea what to say or do. He knows John is nothing like Victor, but the risk...the pain seems inevitable. Sentiment. He should ignore it, douse out the flame.
“Cheese and spinach ravioli. Can’t do without it.”
In the meantime, stay safe, everyone. I love you all.
As if on cue, Angelo reappears and insists they owe him nothing when they try to pay. The three men debate it all the way to the door, which Angelo unlocks to let them out. John and Sherlock finally concede and say goodnight as they step out onto the sidewalk. Soon they are walking to John’s car in a comfortable silence.
‘Have you seen this one?’ asked John, though clearly he was eager to watch it. ‘I don’t think we got this far when we were doing our marathon.’
I'm sure some, maybe many, are disappointed that John did not kick the shit out of Jim before his demise, and that neither John nor Sherlock actually killed him. I just couldn't figure how Sherlock would have a gun and be able to use it without getting in trouble. Sure, he could have grabbed John's before he left the flat. Hell, he probably did, but it is an illegal firearm after all. It's not like Greg could just say he shot him, having never fired his weapon. I mean, they could've fired his gun too, but that would've ended with a massive cover-up I just didn't want to get into and we've seen already that Greg is one who wants to follow the rules of the law. Granted, he is to the point where he would do just about anything for John and Sherlock out of friendship and brotherly love, but they wouldn't want to compromise him by asking.
“Get out,” Sherlock growls. His voice is so low John can scarcely hear him and when he does, those two words tip the scale. John bends forward slightly cupping his ear.
2. Will he ever get to tell Sherlock he loves him now that he knows? And godammit, Jane, how could you do this? Just because we were all afraid John would figure it out at a critical moment doesn't mean you had to do this!
JAWN!
“Someone wanted me out, Dr. Watson. I was the clear target and there was no sense worrying the team. Yes, there were accidents, but only with minor injuries. I had no reason to believe anyone was in mortal danger.”
“What did you say?” Greg growls slowly. Neither one answers, only staring at Greg after his sudden change in demeanor from confounded to absolute anger. “Someone threatened John in

Pack - the largest group of blockers from both teams skating within ten feet of each other.
They stare at one another. Sherlock sees both fear and desire in John’s eyes? It is only then that he begins to notice other tells that he should have seen long ago. An elevated heart rate, flush blooming up John’s neck and onto his cheeks, and his pupils have grown tenfold. Sherlock is shocked to the core and his breath hitches again when he sees those gorgeous, perfect eyes with only a sliver of blue left flick down to his own lips. In fact, his whole brain screeches to a halt in stunning realization.
Sherlock turns his hands under John’s and twines their fingers together as he lifts them to his lips, pressing a kiss to John’s knuckles. The doctor lets out a breath and bites his lower lip. Sherlock’s eyes track every movement. He mirrors the action and then slowly, deliberately glides his tongue across his own upper lip, knowing his teasing has John’s full attention. He raises his eyes only after John’s breathless gasp reaches his ears. They stare at one another for a full minute before John clears his throat and breaks the spell. Sherlock lowers their hands, but does not let go.
“I would do anything for you, John,” Sherlock almost lifts his hand and kisses it. “Let me tell you a story, a mystery.”
* Is Greg okay and will he be back soon?
Love, Jane
Before the argument has a chance to become more heated, two police officers march over to get statements from the duo. Sherlock’s is not nearly as long as John’s so he ends up listening more than talking. He cringes several times as the doctor speaks and wants to take John in his arms and hold on so he can make sure this is real and John is truly safe. Budreau is also there, interjecting questions whenever it suits him. A part of Sherlock wants to punch him just to shut him up so John can talk. The insufferable man asks a handful of questions once John is finished and then starts checking that everyone is wrapping up.
Feel free to send more. They really help keep this story alive. Thank you all for reading.
John saves Sherlock not once, but twice.
*nudge nudge wink wink*
“Nine? Seems rather arbitrary.”
Sherlock sees the Rock City bus as soon as he steps away from the hotel, right where he left it. As he walks toward it, he once again considers how he and John can best watch everything they need to throughout the bout. He has been to the stadium many times before, but John has never seen its track and Sherlock plans to discuss it with him at dinner. Ironically, the doctor is the very person he meets as he climbs up the bus’ three steps.
Will Mrs. Hudson be planning wedding things on her own while her boys are away? And what will John, and especially Sherlock, think of those plans?
“I said you’re one to talk with the way you and Molly carry on,” John remarks in a loud voice, temper flaring.
His mouth watering and cock twitching with interest, John leapt into the perfect accompaniment to Sherlock’s sultry moves as another voice began to sound.
“Christ, Sherlock, it’s not important,” John grumbles. He is weary and frustrated, his face scrunched up and lips pursed. “It’s just grazed. Just...stay here. With me. Please.”

Let my love open the door
Well, I’m not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
* What cases or villains will come out of the woodwork now?
Oops, I fell into a Monty Python sketch for a minute there. Now that I'm back, I'll dive right into those questions I so love to pose at the end of my chapters.
“Yes,” he answers without stopping to consider it. He has no need. He trusts John implicitly and he knows the feeling is mutual. There is no reason to delay any longer. There never was. “I have no real evidence of my suspicions.”
I haven't changed the chapter count yet, but I'm certain it will be at least 11 now. I'll obviously let you all know if that changes.
“No,” Sherlock replies quietly. He rests his hands on John’s waist and pulls him up so their bodies are touching from chest to knee, their hips more or less together. John cradles his face in one hand while placing the other on his shoulder. Their lips meet hesitantly, softly. Both exhale slowly through open mouths, close enough to feel the warmth of the other’s breath.
When the kiss ends, Sherlock’s hands have migrated from the small of John’s back to cupping his perfect buttocks. He lets out a long sigh and touches his forehead to John’s. His voice hovers in the air like a contented whisper floating through a breeze.
Is Sherlock right about John being angry and leaving?
To his surprise, his eyes spring open again to the blurred image of a worried face framed with mussed blonde hair. He blinks rapidly to clear his vision and the unknown face quickly becomes John’s.
“Couldn’t help it, could I?” John says, puffing out a breathy chuckle. Sherlock hesitates a moment and then presses on. He might as well finish the story.
“THAT’S what you wanted to tell me? What does that have to do with anything?”
“Fuck the policy,” she growls, closing the gap and grabbing his waist to hold him steady as she crashes her body against his.
“I will,” he assures. He nods at each of them in turn and hastens out of the bar.
“He is very boisterous, yes,” Sherlock replies mildly, wondering how to defuse the situation, but John surprises him and not for the first time.
Sherlock and John step down the small staircase at the front of the house and head for a row of shops and restaurants a few blocks away. They walk in a comfortable silence, each left to his own thoughts. John’s mind wanders to the night before, this morning, the tour, the guide. He had been such a fool to leave Sherlock’s room the way he had. Hurrying from the bedroom and refusing coffee like he was ashamed or angry. Well, truth be told, he was angry about Sherlock’s deductions. He had not wanted him to know about Claire or the supposed baby. But why? John had done nothing wrong. Claire had lied, made up the baby and tried to trap him. He has nothing to be ashamed of, right?
