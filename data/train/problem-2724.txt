3) “...I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again...” SCAN
“And this is a special delivery from the Hamleys management for your granddaughter and grandson,” Holmes continued, ringing the bell.

As for Wilde/Bosie and Raffles/Bunny, Wilde is actually Bunny in everything but the looks and the age. Wilde is brilliant, of course, which is more Raffles-like. On the other hand, Wilde adored Bosie beyond measure in spite of (or maybe because of?) Bosie’s character, forgave much, and indulged Bosie’s whims while he could. Wilde eagerly submitted himself to Bosie’s will, not the other way around. Like Bunny, Wilde went to prison. (Well, Bosie did too, but that was another story altogether, and long after Wilde).
“I suppose I’ll follow your advice and take some time off, since my consulting-room is a mess anyway,” John said with a dry chuckle.
John said it as one utters marriage vows. I drew him to myself and claimed his lips—something I would never dare to do outside in the city.
I don’t claim to be the shrewdest of people, but as I looked in his eyes, I saw no lie in them.
“Yes, John took excellent care of me,” I said.
“Henry was caught and later executed. I read about it.”
Enjoying the ingenuity with which John hid the identities of our former clients, I repented of the harshness of my former criticism of his literary endeavours. While his renditions of our past cases often took blatantly fantastic forms (snakes summoned by whistling!), they never failed to entertain and cheer. What were supposed to be grim narratives of humanity’s vilest ways emerged from under his pen as messages of hope.
We turned away from the window, and our gazes fell on the Christmas tree Mrs. Hudson had decorated in that homely, heartwarming way so dear to us both.
Sherlock was absorbed in the case the whole day and solved it by the evening. Surprisingly, it hadn’t exhausted him. On the contrary, his system had been completely re-energised. He was so much better that he declared our country vacation a distinct success and that he wished to return home the very next morning.
“Martha was good enough to lend me her old clothes. They were too short, and I had to crouch.”
John put his arms around me and pulled me close to himself. I had no energy to object that I deserved contempt, not compassion. He held me for a long while, stroking my back. I craved his touch and his scent, even though I had no moral right to be comforted.
“Would you like me to leave?” he asked at last.
For a long while we enjoyed the utter languor which seized our still connected bodies. We were loath to become separate, not just yet. I felt blessedly serene snuggled up to Sherlock even as my prick was softening within him. His heartbeat comforted me, sounding steady and healthy, a far cry from the way it had been when he had collapsed. During the three years we had been apart, even though he had let me know he was alive, being unable to help had been the worst for me. Now, by his side again, at least I could take care of him. I could ease his pain if he was suffering, physically or mentally. I had his back and could protect him, either from rogues or from himself.
“Do you regret having served in the army?” Holmes asked me when we shared supper in the evening.
“It’s him, that mastermind you’re after, isn’t it,” John said grimly; it was not a question.
“Could a light supper be arranged afterwards?” Watson asked.
“It seems that we’ve been overzealous,” Holmes said apologetically as I dropped into my armchair, chuckling.
There’s also one of the instances of Holmes mentioning Watson’s natural charm when it comes to dealing with people:
He’s practically having a panic attack while the poor Lady Frances is being taken out of the coffin and revived. So much for a cold logician.
I complied, and in a few minutes the three of us had extinguished the fire. The consulting-room which John had furnished with such care was a sorry sight: the area around the desk was damaged most—documents, books, the curtains, the chair, the carpet—all burnt and dripping wet. From the wall hung the mangled remains of the chandelier which would have been on the level exactly above John’s head had he sat behind his desk at the moment of the explosion.
” which no one thought to suspect as his base. So why “a retired beekeeper” couldn’t be Holmes’s cover? (Until he really retired and continued to keep bees).
1) It is generally considered that Milverton’s case was well after Reichenbach, but I tend to agree with the Lenfilm version because there are some hints in the Canon which support
However, in the evening, when John came down dressed in his uniform, all thoughts of the case vanished from my head. Indeed, his uniform was a bit too tight. The scarlet tunic accented his broad shoulders and hugged his waist snugly, showing off his trim, sturdy figure, while the dark blue trousers made his legs seem even longer. The air of raw virility Watson had about him was irresistible. My mouth went dry as I stared.
I sat up, adjusting my clothes. Of course Sherlock’s brother would wish to know all the circumstances. One could expect that, and I owed it to him.
“For God’s sake, you must rest,” I exclaimed. “You’ve lost a great deal of blood; you have a broken collarbone and cracked ribs. You can’t go anywhere right now.”
I think I found the ultimate answer as to why Mary calls Watson James in TWIS. It’s the most trivial version of all that exist: ACD did forget Watson’s name.
When they apprehend Amberley,
“An electric generator could be installed in the cellar,” I obliged. “Safe and clean in comparison with the gas lighting this place doesn’t even possess. Then, a new stove would be handy. I’m sure the cook would be pleased.”
We descended to the sitting-room by late afternoon, exactly in time for the grandiose dinner Mrs. Hudson had prepared. John and I insisted that she, Jenny, and Billy join us at the table. The first course had just been finished when our festivities were interrupted by a delegation from the press requesting an interview. Their network of informants must have been rather effective. We sent a polite decline through Mrs. Hudson, but the less reputable pressmen continued to clamour under our windows.
? Isn’t that a weird choice of words? Has Watson been married at all in his life? Each time it doesn’t compute, I take it that the two good gentlemen are mystifying us.
The truth was excruciating; it left me gasping for air like a fish thrown ashore. Being involved with me had brought so much suffering into John’s life. I had only wished to protect him—and I had—but at what cost? I had hurt the one closest and dearest to me, hurt him almost to the point of his breaking. And, despite all of this, he had forgiven me.
“They prepare young fellows for various technical professions—engineers, mechanics, and so on.”
I won’t dwell on the near-misses I had whilst climbing down. It was a messy and rather unpleasant affair. It will suffice to say that I made it, more or less uninjured. In the forest I found a brook, brought my appearance into order as much as was possible, and carefully proceeded to the station. In the shop by the station I purchased a cloak and a hat which helped me to disguise myself a bit. After that, I boarded the train to Bern where I knew one of Mycroft’s agents resided on a permanent basis.
. It’s also a curious point whether Holmes and Watson still live at Baker Street at the time of this story or whether it was one of those rare cases Holmes took on in the retirement. There is
“Yes. On Boxing Day Lord Roxton and his wife will give presents to the children of the poor, and their son, the famous traveller, will read a lecture about his adventures.”
(1893) and
He interprets so much from just a squeeze on his wrist. Here we see Doctor’s humanity too—his first instinct is to help the one who is being hurt, even if it’s the worst man in London. When their night adventure is safely over, and Lestrade visits them the next morning, we have a rare instance of Watson’s physical description in the text of the Canon:
This story is a fine example how true Holmes’s statement from BLAN is: even when Holmes is not at his best, Watson presents it as if he is, often at Watson’s own expense. And surely it’s not because of some hero-worshiping. It’s just that in Watson’s loving eyes Holmes is always
But wait, what of this famous quote?
“Who is it, Clara?” I called the maid.
“John is the best part of my life.” I breathed in and out, calming myself. “But you’re the one who considers feelings a weakness. You saw how broken

to Watson. Holmes of the canon wasn’t rude and in most cases he readily admitted being wrong:
“We could still buy a country house someday as we planned, if you wish it.”
My train of thought was rudely interrupted by a shove from behind. Someone had almost knocked me down while making his way through the crowd, and I had dropped my stack of books.
Poirot decides to burgle the house of the blackmailer with the help of Hastings. Here the
We supped, took a relaxing bath with lavender oil, and he went straight to bed.
Leastrade threw the pantry door open and recoiled in surprise. In the light of a small candle a bedraggled old woman was bustling about the pantry. She was dressed in a tattered misshapen dress and had a dirty shawl wrapped around her head, her face so grimy that with her crooked nose and a scowl she looked like a witch.
“The way you obfuscate the dates is ineffective,” Mycroft remarked when he was done. “Anyone slightly observant will realise that the case took place not in 1888 but definitely before the Marriages Act of 1886 came into force. Then your supposed marriage: if memory serves, in your previous novel you state that you met your future wife in September of 1888 whereas in this story you are already married by March. Certainly that will raise some questions. There are also other details in the need of correction, but it might result in a complete rewrite and could ruin the story. At any rate, this entertaining piece of fiction shouldn’t do any harm.”
I continued the massage, moving to his collarbone, where there was another scar: the entry point of the bullet. As my fingertips slid over its rough surface, a thought crossed my mind. Half an inch down, and the subclavian artery would have been ruptured, not grazed. He would have bled out before he was brought to the British lines. We would have never met.
“This house could be more than that,” Sherlock said at last. “Have you ever thought of what we are going to do in retirement?”
Still, he did seem to be especially keen on my opinion about the house. His motive surely lay on the surface. Either way, it was simplicity itself, so I decided to observe and analyse as per his directions.
And lastly, a theme of guilt suggested by Bert Coules’s adaptation: there Holmes is heartbroken at the news that Nathan Garrideb went mad after the fruitless journey and bitter disappointment. Indirectly, Holmes encouraged the old Garrideb to go there by backing up Killer Evans’s words. Holmes did it for the sake of the safety of the old man because it was better to get him out of the scene. There was no way Holmes could have predicted the effect of the ordeal on the old man’s sanity. And yet, in the radio drama Holmes blames himself just as he does in FIVE: he always assumes personal responsibility for the well-being of his clients and is anguished if something bad happens to them. Perhaps it’s one of the things that drives Holmes to excel: on those rare occasions he doesn’t people may get hurt. And of course, Watson is there to console Holmes as he can.
Note the season, it’s winter. We’ll return to it later. Holmes demonstrates an immense repulsion to Milverton, calling him
“Dinner at Simpson’s?”
“Mycroft is a sensualist, and that is not restricted to his gastronomic proclivities.”
The man turned sharply.
So there’s a picture which becomes quite clear:
I got a present for him from my valise. Sherlock smiled fondly as he unwrapped a mahogany briar pipe. Then he raised an eyebrow, having noticed that the mouthpiece was detachable and that the stem concealed a stiletto blade.
“Thank you, Watson,” Holmes said, turning from his bench of chemicals. “I was too busy to do it, and the atmosphere has become somewhat stale.”
“Couldn’t get any sleep either?”
“One has to be very cautious, even among friends,” I replied with a sigh. “Were you convicted?”
I took out my notebook and started to write, considering my options. There weren’t many: I had a chance only by engaging Moriarty in hand-to-hand combat, so that Moran couldn’t shoot. Then perhaps I would manage to use my weapons.
Holmes shook his head, smiling, and pressed my hand. I smiled back at him. My world had just turned upside down—I, who hadn’t considered myself capable of the same-sex attraction, discovered that I was in love with another man. And that man was my best friend. There were two things I was sure of, though. First, I would never break Holmes’s heart. And second, he would take no stimulants that day.

Also, Watson obviously knew that Holmes pretended that his ankle was sprained when they were fishing out information from Reuben Hayes.

“You need medical attention,” I replied. “That’s my main concern for the time being.”
I had always taught Sherlock not to get attached, but to no avail. His first major attachment ended in a disaster. A college friend seduced him, spent a few months with him, and then left, both the university and Sherlock. If only Sherlock was able just to amuse himself casually, not letting a person he shared bed with into his heart. No, for Sherlock a mere dalliance was impossible. It had to turn into a full-fledged
My sources reported that Watson was a decent if somewhat disorganised individual, an offspring of impoverished Edinburgh gentlefolk, an impecunious doctor who had been driven to seek his fortune in the army. After being invalided out, he gambled and often lived beyond his means, but otherwise was quite harmless.
Poirot tells about his early case as he and Hastings sit by the fire on a “
Next, Holmes asks Watson to act as a decoy which Watson did many times too. I don’t buy for a second that Watson wasn’t aware of this role. He makes it appear so to enhance the effect in the story, but I think it’s pretty clear that Holmes shared the plan with him or Watson saw right through it:
So basically, Holmes receives all the necessary data from Watson, forms a theory, and then goes to France because the time is ripe—there the paths of Watson and Green would intersect, and Holmes just has to wait a little, which he does. If Holmes indeed said that Watson did nothing, it would be teasing, not scolding in earnest. Whenever Watson was
I returned home, resolved that countermeasures had to be taken urgently. John was in the sitting-room, ensconced in his armchair and wrapped in his maroon dressing-gown, a yellow-backed novel in his hands—a sight for sore eyes after a long day. The moment I entered, he started fussing over me, saying that I looked exhausted. I didn’t have much appetite but humoured him by taking a cup of tea and a sandwich.
Indeed, Watson had already made sure that Holmes was a household name.
One morning I woke up to loud voices somewhere near me. There was also furious rustling of papers mingled with stomping around the room.
Holmes’s reasoning was sound, and I admired his resolve which showed the strength of his character.
“It’s both or none then?” I asked with a grin.
Having settled myself by his side, I circled my arms around him and kissed him behind the ear. Sherlock murmured something unintelligible, stroking my thigh. Slowly, I pulled out of him and entered him again. Next time I rubbed the sensitive, stretched rim of his hole with the head of my prick before plunging in. The moment I was out of him yet again, Sherlock whined. I trailed my hand to his entrance and felt the swollen rim between my thumb and fingers. Sherlock’s blunt nails dug into my thigh. I didn’t make him wait. I pushed in, all the way up to the hilt, and rocked into him, alternating quick, shallow thrusts with deep ones. Sherlock couldn’t contain his moans anymore which only spurred me on. Even if any sounds reached the ground floor, our household were trustworthy people. Palming Sherlock’s bollocks and fondling them, I could feel them tighten. His stiff cock was throbbing and leaking, untouched. I took Sherlock in hand and frigged him, having him at a relaxed pace. My hand, still slick with vaseline, slid along Sherlock’s prick with obscene squelching noises; soon the first droplets of his seed coated my fingers. More and more followed as we both shuddered and I burst inside him. He blabbered in incoherent French whilst I filled him up with my essence and stroked him to completion.

—We hardly exchanged a word on our way to Kent. As soon as the train began to move, Mrs. Hudson busied herself with knitting. She looked haggard, her complexion devoid of colour, dark circles under her eyes and a deep crease between her eyebrows that hadn’t been there before. My behaviour had aggravated her own distress. With a pang of remorse I averted my gaze from her and peered out the window. The monotonous sound of the wheels lulled me to a sleep which thankfully brought no lasting dreams.
The moment we arrived, I ran upstairs like lightning. The door to his room was locked. It didn’t deter me in the least, for I had my own duplicate key. He had let me have it, knowing that I was much unsettled by his penchant of locking himself in while under the influence of drugs.
“All questions later.” He changed from his black frock-coat into a grey tweed jacket and replaced his top-hat with a travelling cloth cap.

The first one is another example of Holmes’s empathy, and the second is that Holmes came to Watson’s room late at night, and then Watson
The thought of the anguish John was being subjected to was gnawing at me, but approaching him in any way other than through Mycroft would be disastrous. At least upon his return to England John would be informed that I was alive—and that was a consolation of sorts.
“Well, then I shall retire,” Watson gave me another smouldering gaze. “Care to join me?”
“I am telling the truth,” I said.
to Watson for his sudden compulsion. Contrary to the popularised image, Holmes of the canon is actually a nice and polite person (despite being curt sometimes). First and foremost, he respects his Watson.
“You seem to be as keen on geology as before,” I said. “The display of minerals in the hall is astounding.”
”. These two are ridiculously in love as ever. War or no war, Holmes will find a moment to treat his Watson to delicious wine.
“It will blow over,” I said soothingly. “He’ll get off his high horse, and meanwhile we shall live by our own wits as we always did.”
“First you shall wash yourself and change,” Mrs. Hudson said sternly. “Then visit the barber’s down the street. Then have breakfast. And then you are going with me, to Kent, to my sister’s.”
On better days we did venture outside, predictably followed by the most impertinent journalists. Solitary walks around the city were moot, so we had to postpone my reacquaintance with London for an indefinite period. We could still enjoy theatres and restaurants, although the attention from the public was wearisome. Thus we mostly stayed home, engaging ourselves in quiet domestic pastimes such as updating my indexes. It was a gargantuan task due to the quantity of information that had accumulated in my absence. I was infinitely touched that John had kept all his old newspapers for the purpose and had them delivered from his Kensington house. My favorite black clay pipe arrived with the countless newspaper bundles. Its appearance indicated that it had been used recently but handled with care and regularly cleaned.
I did as I was told. He gazed at me admiringly, as if I were a marble statue at an exhibition. My cheeks burned, but it was strangely exciting and titillating to be watched by my John in this fashion. At last, he undid his trousers and drawers and divested himself of them. His cock was standing rigidly, its flushed head glistening with moisture. The next moment John was on top of me, positioning himself between my legs. I was out of my mind with lust, for he had kept his scarlet tunic on.
“When I followed your directions, you were my commanding officer. Now that the task is completed, you are merely a civilian.”
“Sherlock,” I whispered, trembling.
Another trait of the established relationship—Watson knows exactly when it’s better to step in or leave Holmes to his own devices:
There was a strain in his shoulders, and he didn’t try to hide his anxiety behind an impassive mask. The whole meaning of his words struck me as I realised it. He had imagined us growing old together and was offering me his vision, unsure of my reaction.
“Why don’t you sell it, John? We have means enough. I want you all to myself.”
I gave a start. He was quite right: watching proved to be so titillating I could come just from it, untouched, but I would much prefer to have those deft hands and lips upon my body, and that gorgeous cock to ravish me. My cheeks burning, I obeyed and walked in.
Sherlock went to the window and pulled up the blind with a theatrical flourish. I gasped quietly. The vista of the Channel was stunning—the great expanse of the sea framed by the sharp ridges of the cliffs and the boundless sky which is forever hidden in the city behind walls and roofs.
When the service was over and the priest departed, we stood in silence for a while. Wiggins sniffed quietly, looking very young without his cheeriness and confidence—a bereft child once again. Lestrade’s brow was furrowed and his jaw set; the captured members of Moriarty’s organisation would surely get what they deserved. Mrs. Hudson was wiping her eyes with her handkerchief, her lips trembling. The mourning crape made her seem small and frail, but she strove to keep her posture straight. Wiggins accompanied her towards the exit, and Lestrade led the way to shield her from the pestilent reporters.
“Come back before he arrives. I’ll need your help to tackle him.”
“There was no one, Doctor. I found this clock in front of the door.”
Each story had a special line for Sherlock, and I hoped it would cheer him up a little.
“You know life in the army inside out while I obviously don’t. Success of the whole case depends on you. After all, you yourself brought it to my attention. Do you want it to be solved or not?”
“I hope you don’t mind that I appropriated it,” John said, his voice tight, as if he wished to elaborate but couldn’t.
“The clock was owned by a neat and diligent person until some unfortunate incident. It takes considerable violence to damage so badly such a sturdy specimen. Is this incident connected to the presence of gunpowder inside the clock? What about yesterday’s walnut episode? What is relevant and what is not? There’s much to think about.”

“We must split, John,” I said as we sat in our suite in Strasbourg. “You go to Baden or Karlsruhe, and I shall proceed on to Geneva.”
“Damn,” he hissed, trembling and wiping beads of sweat from his forehead as he settled down again. “One more day, not longer. I can’t go on imposing on you like this, Doctor. You need a quiet life after the horrors of Afghanistan.”
As always, Watson can read Holmes without words, by touch. He produces a powerful effect on readers when he describes Holmes reading him, but he himself does it to Holmes all the time:
“Got a penny, guv’nor?”
On the evening of May 3d we arrived at Meiringen, a picturesque village where I’d hoped we could spend a few days in peace. We had barely been ushered to our hotel rooms, however, when the landlord came and said that there was a telephone call for me. It was an ominous sign, for I didn’t regularly keep Mycroft appraised of our whereabouts. Careful not to show my anxiety, I asked if I could take the call in a private place. The landlord graciously offered his study.
My interview with the lavatory finished, I was too exhausted to walk. I crawled back to the sitting-room on all fours, hoping that Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t see me. It took the remains of my energy to climb onto the sofa, and then I remembered no more.
After a short while I regained command of my faculties and made for the cab stand which was some hundred yards from the Adair residence. Cabbies were reluctant to drive such an odd-looking character until I showed them money and promised a generous payment.
The work which lay ahead of me seemed hideous in its magnitude. At times I had dark episodes of despair, thinking that I would never reunite with John and have my life back. But even at the distance of miles and miles John managed to warm me with his light. His first short story was an amazing surprise, and I cherished each new one that followed. He spoke to me in a language only the two of us could understand. He was thinking of me. He loved me and waited for me. That gave me strength to fight on.
’s passing, and you vowed never to be so vulnerable, didn’t you? You’ve never been intimate with anyone.”

“John. John,” he said and touched my face reverently. “How I wish we had met under different circumstances. I don’t want you to ruin your life.”
“Everything important is in my bank vaults.”
“Is a bit exaggerated.”
“He loves you and cares for you, why do you not see it? Mend your fences while you still can. It is much better than estrangement, believe me.”
“Thank you for inviting us,” Holmes said as they shook hands.
“Have you unpacked your bags already, Holmes?” asked the voice I had expected to hear at the other end of the line. “You should run. Save yourself and your lover… for at least a short while.”
“By Jove, you were right. It was worth the wait,” John said a few minutes later, his relaxed features all aglow.
I strode to him and pulled him into an embrace, pressing him close to myself.
“Admit it, you enjoyed this adventure,” Sherlock remarked slyly.
“If you will. On one condition.”
At Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson welcomed us excitedly, proud of Holmes’s success, yet worrying about his still-emaciated state. There was warmth in Holmes’s eyes as he greeted her. His expression brightened the moment he stepped over the threshold of our flat, and his bearing became visibly less strained, as though a considerable weight were lifted off his chest.
Thankfully, the good inspector found a four-wheeler. Rattling back to Baker Street, I was trying to calm down, my fingers wrapped around Holmes’s wrist. His pulse was fluttering and somewhat arrhythmic. He was seated beside me, still unconscious, with his head laid on my shoulder and his nose buried into my frock-coat. I was angry with myself for not having insisted more firmly that he eat. I was angry with him for his stubbornness. He was not yet fully recovered from his three-year absence when he had often pushed himself to the limits of endurance, tracking down the remaining part of Moriarty’s syndicate.
In fact, everything in the house bespoke Mycroft’s hand: the house was spacious and comfortable to the point of decadence, yet its opulence never descended into bad taste. It was a bigger and richer version of his London club, with its ornate furnishings and soft lights. A drawing-room styled as an Eastern boudoir was adjacent to a large billiard-room and an enormous library whither one could escape unnoticed from one’s guests, alone or in the company of another. The purpose of this establishment was obvious.
. For the first time I was looking into his eyes from a distance of mere inches. His irises were of deeper gray around the pupils which dilated slightly when I put my right hand on his waist and we assumed the position.
“We’ll order a delivery then. And stay for the night, John. I can’t stand the idea of letting you return to the front lines just yet.”

In a couple of days we found ourselves on the train again. As before, Sherlock spent most of the journey asleep, curled up into my side. Upon our arrival the Colonel met us with the trap at the station. Dressed as a typical country squire, he still had the air of a military man. Civilian life hadn’t affected his immaculate posture. I had noted that even during our meeting at the club. Indeed, he hadn’t changed much over the past six years. Now the Colonel must have been in his early forties; his auburn hair had become slightly grizzled, and there were a few more crow’s feet at the corners of his shrewd hazel eyes, but his moustache and side-whiskers were as ever regulation trim, and his stocky figure fit.
I decided to avoid any undue attention I might attract by appearing there in my own person. A seedy pawnbroker’s shop in a backstreet near Hyde Park Corner turned out to hold a treasure trove: I exchanged my frock-coat and top-hat for some rags, a wig, a set of false side-whiskers, and a pile of tattered books. With hunched back and shuffling gait I emerged from the Park as a nondescript crackpot, the kind polite society prefers not to notice.
Sheathed in me completely, Sherlock paused so that I could adjust. I always enjoy beyond words being full of him. It doesn’t make me any less of a man, for loving without prejudice is by no means a weakness. Sherlock must have felt when I was ready—he started to move at a gentle pace, the languid, delicious drag of his member stretching me more. The hand with which he had guided his cock inside me slid forward and closed around my prick. He fucked and stroked me at the same rhythm, and I relinquished the last vestiges of composure, carried away by the flood of sensations. His pace quickened, becoming rougher and rougher; God, how I loved it. I was moaning at the top of my voice. His hips slapped my arse, his bollocks slamming against my hole, and he couldn’t focus on stroking me any longer. He just held me by the hips as he was fucking me sore. Jolts of white pleasure coursed through my entire body, almost making me sob. My stiff prick dangled, neglected, but I didn’t really need it to be touched, with Sherlock’s cock up my arse, hitting my sweet spot.
“My dear Holmes, you may be an excellent actor, but I have no such talent.”
Mentioning Holmes’s retirement on South Downs, Watson acts as a stand-in for the audience. “
“Oh please,” Mycroft snorted. “I’ve had enough of it—women, men—bah.”
Note that in 1899 Holmes is 45, and in BOSC, which took place in 1889, Holmes refers to Watson and himself as “middle-aged”, so it again proves that Milverton’s case was before Reichenbach (Howell’s date of death is also suggestive of the exact year). Several days later,

I believed my calculations to be exact: Moran was the kind of a man who acted swiftly. My arrival in broad daylight should have prompted him to do so. There was nothing he desired more than to have his revenge on me. But hours ticked away, passers-by were fewer and fewer in the street, making the policemen conspicuous, yet there was no sign of the Colonel. What if he had seen through my plan? What if he had realised that such a blatant display in the window was a set-up? How would he strike then? Had I placed John in grave danger again?

Wiggins was delivered fast asleep to a small, nondescript house in the dock district of Calais. A potent soporific had been slipped into his beer, but its effects were to be wearing off by that time. I regarded the sturdy young man for a few moments, reminiscing on the days when he had been a gangly, always hungry imp, the first Irregular who later helped to build that formidable street squad. His leadership skills and shrewdness had stayed with him—now, at twenty-three, he worked as a shipyard foreman, had made a good name for himself, and was already happily married and raising two children.
“That’s Knowlton Court, the place where Mycroft let me know that you were alive. The owner of the estate was his chum by the looks of it,” John said.
every month. Newspapers requested interviews with me more insistently than ever, and I didn’t turn them down, for I knew they might reach Sherlock. It was an opportunity to have at least some sort of communication with him, albeit one-sided and censored.
“Did you know of it?”
“You didn’t doubt your acting skills before.”
1) I tried to reconcile the discrepancy between FINA and EMPT. In FINA Watson writes of the “event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill” whereas Holmes mentions in EMPT that, having escaped, he read Watson’s statement “some months later”.
The rogue didn’t listen; he shoved Openshaw in the chest, and Openshaw tumbled down into the river. Violent gusts of wind carried away his desperate cries as he splashed, struggling to stay afloat. Numb, I just stood there while Openshaw gasped and coughed, the waves choking him and his wet clothes dragging him down. His head was barely above the surface. He was fighting for his life, but his strength was running out quickly amidst the storm. His hoarse voice was growing weaker. Some invisible force held me in place, and there was nothing, nothing I could do—
Our steps resounded in the dark, abandoned structure as we ascended the creaking stairs. I grabbed John by the wrist—his presence and steadfast support were reassuring—and we prowled like two night creatures on the hunt. The window in the drawing-room commanded an excellent view of the street and the window of our own sitting-room. We settled ourselves in a dusty corner and admired the bait set for Moran.
“Thanks, Holmes,” I said skeptically. “What are you driving at, though?”
A naughty child who got carried away could say that. And then it struck me. He had mentioned once having lost his mother at a very young age and her death having been sudden. Mrs. Hudson, who always cared for us, was a kind of a motherly figure to us both. He must have had a nasty flashback, and in his weakened state couldn’t cope.
A quiet creaking of the door interrupted my reverie. Watson entered my bedroom, clad in his nightshirt and dressing-gown, a candle in his hand. It was well past midnight, but it was obvious he couldn’t sleep either. His beslippered feet stepped almost noiselessly. It cost him a tremendous effort, no doubt, considering the leg pain foul weather brought him. John cast a careful glance into my direction. Seeing that I, too, was awake, he put the candle on the bedside table and seated himself on the edge of my bed.
“I’ve just come to England,” I replied, accosted by the saccharine rosewood smell of his perfume. “Back from Afghanistan recently. My tastes are rather extravagant, and I’ve lived a bit beyond my means upon returning. Now I’m open to new opportunities if you know what I mean.”
Yesterday, whilst sorting through old documents, I came across a photograph of Holmes in one of his funniest disguises. Upon consulting my journal of the corresponding period, I found that the entries were too concise and didn’t cover all the circumstances of the case, so I decided to write out a proper account.
. The main character of the story is Hugh Lawrence (who resides in Baker Street like the future Sherlock Holmes). He is invited to the house of his friend John H. Thurston (Watson is also John H.). Hugh is a doctor (like Watson) and Thurston is a chemist (like Holmes). The story tells how Hugh act as an amateur detective to solve the strange behaviours of two guests of the house.
“I’m very sorry, John. You put so much effort into arranging it and I was looking forward to visiting the city of your birth on a vacation for once, not on business.”
”—just precious. As always, I have a lot of questions.
John and I exchanged glances; with a soft smile John brought a chair next to my armchair, and we seated ourselves.
“You are human, and to err is human.”
Wiggins nodded earnestly, pinched himself hard on the back of his hand, and hissed in pain.
Suddenly I was grabbed from behind and forcefully dragged into a narrow dead-end between the houses.
This story, for instance, involves a cross-dressing American young man who together with his partner in crime was getting money out of Britons by cheating at cards. Spoiler ahead: this young man was found dead in a train compartment which he had earlier boarded disguised as a woman, accompanied by his partner (who went as far as following him to England from America). The young man’s older brother had tried to get him an honest job and to separate him from the influence of the said criminal partner.
“List the deceased as Mr. Stark Munro,” Sherlock Holmes added.
We had very little time to spend in John’s house: he took his pistol and instructed the maid to keep the lights on in his study until midnight. By half-past nine we were in the appointed spot near Kensington Gardens from whence our cabby drove us to the corner of Cavendish square. Thankfully, that part of the city hadn’t changed much, and I led John on foot to our destination. It was convoluted but the safest way to the empty house which faced our Baker Street flat and which, probability suggested, Moran would choose as his firing position.
Nevertheless, it tickles me that ACD’s unintentional inconsistencies can be read as very much intentional clues on Watson’s part. It’s such a fertile ground for many headcanons and fic ideas.
The slashiest story of them all is published in 1924. By that time Holmes is 70, and Watson several years older. As the mods suggested with PRIOR, perhaps Watson is a little less careful in hiding the extent of affection between Holmes and himself. Perhaps he even allows the reader to see it plainly on purpose since it can’t possibly do any harm anymore to the two gentlemen of the honoured old age, long in retirement. In many subtle ways Watson already told us how much Holmes cares about him (“
Holmes opened the camera and took out the glass plate. But as he was passing it, he let it slip between his fingers. It smashed to smithereens against the marble floor.
“Wonderful,” he muttered, opening his eyes and yawning.
A side note: I saw some tumblr posts implying that Watson doesn’t know French. In this story we have a direct evidence that he is quite fluent when he spoke to the maid’s lover:
“I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.” REDH
And when Holmes identifies the noble lady who killed Milverton, he communicates with Watson silently, which only proves again how exceptionally close they are.
By noon my surgery was as busy as ever. Those of my patients who had witnessed Holmes’s dramatic arrival the previous day were curious about him and full of questions. I told them only that he was gone, avoiding further elaborations.
The snake was gone before it could bite.
Mr. and Mrs. Turner were most considerate hosts. They didn’t force their company on me, and I kept to myself as much as I wished, occasionally lending my hand as a doctor to treat Mr. Turner’s rheumatism. Mrs. Hudson’s plan worked: visiting the nearest public-house was out of the question. For the sake of propriety, I had to stay sober until returning to London.
No reply followed, and the connection was terminated. In a sense I was glad: the Professor was the kind of a man whose word wasn’t to be doubted. If he said he would leave John alone, so it would be. Although I wouldn’t hesitate to give my life for John’s safety, I wasn’t keen on dying—it would break John’s heart. Being proud of his ancient lineage, Moriarty was fond of old-fashioned ways. Most likely, he would arrange a rendezvous indeed quite similar to a duel, but away from onlookers. I would have to improvise on the spot. Alas, the odds would be not in my favour.
“I say a lot of rubbish,” I muttered.
“It’s me he is after and he won’t spend additional energy on the run. You have always deferred to my good judgement,” I insisted.
“My mistake,” I said with a polite nod and departed.
One thing occurred to me in the moment. I had rarely, if ever, told John I loved him. For some irrational reason I had been afraid that if I did so, we would part. And there I was, standing on the edge of an abyss, resigned that I had probably seen him for the last time in this life. How foolish I had been.
Here’s a gentleman’s honour which Holmes values so much. Surely, he wouldn’t have taken advantage of one woman to protect another. Watson, of course, wouldn’t hear of Holmes risking alone. Just as Holmes, Watson has his own personal code of honour:
At last Swinsby gave us a bundle of letters. Holmes checked the contents, counted every piece of paper, and nodded.
“Sherlock,” John said in a low, warning voice.
Even though I paid him little heed, I did observe that he was tense after a day in his surgery and making his rounds in the foul weather. He had cast a few wistful glances at me over the pages of the novel in his hands. There was a pent-up restlessness within him which he was suppressing, forcing himself to sit still and make no noise. Once his hand strayed towards the area of his groin, but he checked the movement abruptly and gripped the armrest instead. At last he laid his novel aside, rose from his armchair, and bid me good-night.
“Shut up or you’ll be sorry right now,” Lestrade barked.
“Dr. Watson,” he said. “There is one more thing to be finalised. If you would come with me to the solicitor’s office to hear out Sherlock’s will?”
Here’s one of the instances when Holmes reads Watson’s thoughts by his features and startles him by the “
The pounding rhythm of our hearts abated a little. I trailed kisses along Sherlock’s neck and nuzzled his armpit, making him giggle, for he was ticklish there. His heady scent sent shivers down my spine, my prick becoming even harder inside him. I resumed the thrusts, and at this new angle I was hitting Sherlock’s sweet spot with precision. He threw back his head, panting and stifling his moans. His channel clenched around me, its pressure so exquisite that an oath tumbled from my lips before I knew it. We kissed again, drunk on each other, both close to the crisis. Sherlock carded his fingers through my hair, whispering my name. His face was glowing. I caught his hand and pressed my lips to his thin wrist, then to his sharp knuckles and long, nervous fingers. I wished to fulfill my promise and bring him to a most decadent climax which would make his toes curl. He read the intent in my eyes. When I sat up, he turned fully onto his side so that I could lie behind him.
“The fee is half the price the blackmailer demands. It’s more than enough to cover our rent and provide for a living without a care in the world for a couple of months.”
”, etc) and then Baron Gruner most vividly (“
- These two friends are on first-name terms, calling each other Hugh and John, respectively, though they are by far not as close as Holmes and Watson. Which returns me to Sir Ian McKellen’s point that surely Holmes and Watson would address each other by given names;
“Oh, you can and you shall,” I said as I proceeded with undressing myself.
They were staring at each other, Saville’s attention focused fully on Holmes. Knowing Holmes so well, I realised that he was distracting Saville, relying upon me to act. I glanced around frantically.
“I still haven’t given you my present,” Sherlock said in a soft tone.
Back at Baker Street, condolences began to arrive in heaps. The sight of black-edged envelopes piled on my desk made me sick at heart. I asked Mrs. Hudson to keep them in her parlour for the time being. She tried to cajole me into having dinner, or at least tea. From a medical point of view I understood the importance of sustenance, yet the very mention of food was repulsive.
“Well, good luck then.”
Other patrons of the pub shot curious looks in our direction from time to time, but I remembered what Holmes had said once about the scattered country houses: much could happen under their roofs with none around being the wiser. While he had been referring to various terrible crimes, in our case the crime was merely being different.
“Naturally,” I replied, waving a hand. “Because you like to be intrigued.”
Holmes examined the larder and approved it as a passable hideout. We removed all signs of his presence from the bedroom—bandages, cigarettes, dirty dishes—made the bed, and had Martha’s solemn promise to keep quiet.
My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition.
“Yes, sir. Your brother checked its contents personally, and as per his instruction, it was placed in your room.”
In the morning Sherlock’s mood was good, and to secure this precarious improvement I suggested we had a walk after breakfast. But suddenly those plans were thwarted. As we were in the middle of our meal and the Colonel was recommending to us the most picturesque places in the vicinity, the butler burst into the dining-room quite out of breath. The story from the evening before about the local burglary had received a gruesome development: the neighbours’ coachman had been murdered. No sooner had the butler related to us the details and we started pondering the matter, a young police inspector arrived. He explained that he had heard of Holmes’s being on a visit here and requested the celebrated detective’s help. Circumstances were clearly working against my efforts to keep my partner away from physical and mental exertions. Of course Sherlock agreed to join the investigation, and all I could do was to tag along, hoping that he wouldn’t fall ill again. It turned out to be a peculiar case which deserves a write-up of its own, separately from this journal.
“I’m sorry,” I murmured, unable to look him in the eye.
Reichenbach he could attempt to trick me that way.
“Is anything amiss?” she asked warily from the threshold.
Saville approached the clock castle, put the lantern on the drawbridge, and opened the gates of the castle. He had barely reached into the innards of the clock when there was a click of a pistol being cocked and Lestrade sprang forward.
Holmes chuckled at my sceptical remark. It was already past noon, so I rang for lunch. Our modest meal was brightened by a conversation we had about travelling—sea-faring, mountaineering, and even aeronautics. Holmes hadn’t been to the Continent, yet his experience was impressive: in his student days he had sailed to the Arctic on a whaler, climbed the mountains of my dear Scotland, and constructed a balloon himself as an experiment. I had ventured abroad only when I had been in the army, but he listened to my accounts avidly.
“Let’s not talk about it,” I said soothingly. “Better tell me about that peculiar method of yours—how you figured out I’d been to Afghanistan.”
We decided to leave in the dead of night, at half past three, and first visit one of his boltholes, where forged passports were hidden. It was surprisingly easy to get ready for the departure: my scarce belongings barely filled my Gladstone bag, and I settled my debts to tradesmen. My rent had been paid until the end of the month. Having put Martha’s earnings into an envelope, I thrust it under her door.
“I am glad that the extended vacation in the country proved so refreshing for you both,” he remarked after the dessert. “Now that you are back in the city, are you ready to resume your service, Sherlock?”
The next day he rummaged in the wardrobe in his room for about two hours, and when he emerged, I dropped my newspaper and burst out laughing. Holmes was unrecognisable in his attire of Father Christmas, wearing red coat and hood, bushy white beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. His his cheeks were ruddy, and his figure was completely transformed, having attained almost Mycroftian corpulence.
“Sherlock!” I gasped and rushed to him.
“Cleanin’, ye twit. I’m a charwoman,” the creature grumbled in a hoarse, croaky voice.
One thing that Wilde, Holmes, and Raffles definitely have in common is art for art’s sake. All three are Bohemian artists, each with his own trade of art.
The parallels: a wrong path in life/a wrong relationship. They’re criminals both by trade and by being a couple (since homosexual relationships were outlawed at the time). The symbolism aside, the rest is not even subtext. It’s text, and it damn looks exactly what it is. There’s no need to make interpretations like in other Holmes stories. It’s right on the surface, in your face. The more I think about it, the more I become convinced that ACD was not only sympathetic with the queer community, but that he probably was a flaming bisexual just as Watson, but whether he acted on it or sublimated it into his writing is another matter.
“Resuming our discussion of the neighbours, Harold Stackhurst is the owner of the house where we are staying,” Holmes said as we were consuming our hearty meal. “He inherited it from his father together with the estate and another residence, Southerton, about a mile from Fulworth. Stackhurst the elder had been a retired courtier, and his wife, Dame Elizabeth, used to be Her Majesty’s lady-in-waiting. After the father’s passing it became clear that the estate was too expensive to keep up. Stackhurst transformed it into a school, having relocated with his mother to Southerton, which is humbler albeit still quite grand. The smallest house, however, posed a more difficult problem to solve. They had no extra means to maintain it, yet the mother didn’t wish to rent or sell it because of the pleasant memories associated with it. The situation became so dire that Stackhurst auctioned practically all of the furnishings from the house to provide the repairs it required.”
We were met at the door by the butler, a bleak fellow of indefinite age who resembled the doorman at the Diogenes Club. The butler introduced himself as Rogers and said that the main bedroom at the end of the gallery up on the first floor was ready for us. He also explained that the servants lived in a separate wing and customarily did not enter the master's part of the house unless rung for. It was very much like Mycroft. All his domestic staff were trained in that fashion. The butler carried our belongings upstairs and disappeared.
). Those scholars argued that it was too cold in winter to go out on dates, so they were meeting in Agatha’s room. How about pubs and cafes? How about Holmes’s personal code of honour? Holmes plainly states that they went out and just talked, and even that made him uncomfortable:
He was silent, his eyes downcast. His actions belied his words, for he was all but clinging to me. Why would he if my sympathy was repugnant to him? Gently, I put my hand under his chin and urged him to look up. What I saw in his eyes astonished me to the core. There was such raw, hopeless longing in them that my heart clenched. Suddenly the pieces fell into place. That talk I had heard behind my back that I was Holmes’s “glass of tea”—so it wasn’t merely a ploy to dismiss some unwanted advances.
“For your collection,” I explained. “Thought it would amuse you.”
Bloody hell, he’s wearing his hubby’s nightshirt. Could you two be more cute? Also, these Victorian nightshirts are so damn sexy, especially considering that nothing was worn underneath.
”, and “
When Holmes asked about the shape of Shlessinger’s ear, he must have been in London still. He either had known who Green was from the very beginning or quickly got an answer from his client:
“I accept your apologies, Mr. Holmes,” she replied with a twinkling eye. “And you shall certainly keep your promises

This ordeal produced a dismal effect on Sherlock. While we were driving to the station, his hands shook; a pulsing vein bulged on his forehead.
. It was noted many times that Watson is quite observant himself, and having lived with Holmes for years he learned and continued to cultivate his faculties. So he easily deduces that Holmes has a case when he finds Holmes in good spirits at breakfast in spite of the gloomy weather. However, further on Holmes admits that he in turn is influenced by Watson’s ways:
I caressed his thigh in silent agreement. He started to descend, taking me in very slowly, inch by inch. His lips parted as I entered him; he was as maddeningly tight as he had been the first time he gave himself to me. I watched his face for any sign of pain, and all my senses were on the alert lest there be tension in his body as my prick pressed deeper into him. It was agonisingly slow, yet John’s features were enraptured. That was the only thing I cared about.
“Well, perhaps it’s his coping method. He’ll come around.” Mycroft shrugged his shoulders, helping himself to fresh coffee and croissants.
He stepped closer to me, until there were mere inches between us, and reached for my cheek with the gentlest of touches. My eyes closed of their own accord. That warm, strong palm slid slowly down my neck and stroked my shoulder tenderly. Then it moved on to my chest and was joined by the other palm to tease my nipples. I quivered, my skin tingling with goosebumps, as John’s hands travelled further down to my belly. My heart hammered wildly and my breath was coming in ragged gasps; I looked at John with heavy-lidded eyes. His face was intense, his whole and undivided attention fixed upon me, just the way I craved. It made me feel drunk. I had to suppress a moan when John cupped my bollocks, squeezing them lightly, and then gave my prick a tentative stroke.
, has had a good reception from the public so far, albeit the title seems to have unnerved many readers, having brought up memories of another December story,
“Very drastic condition indeed,” he murmured.
“There’s a place I’ve heard about from a friend,” I said in hushed tones, with a slight nod towards the side street which led to the brothel. “Getting into the trade there would be more comfortable for me. It’s the first time I try doing it.”
The Old Ones wage wars between themselves, but it is us they send to fight for their ambitions. So it was for centuries, ever since they came from the fathomless depths and invaded the lands of men. Men lost the Great War, and now they are doomed to kill each other whenever the Old Ones order it. The war in Afghanistan was no exception. Amidst the savagery of the Maiwand battlefield, I gazed into the abyss of primordial darkness living deep in the caves of Tora Bora our troops were to conquer. Damaged irretrievably, I was invalided out with two unwelcome mementoes: a crippled leg and a pervasive sense of terror which could be kept at bay during daytime but was inescapable at night. My surgeon’s hand was still steady, though, and the wound compensation was enough to establish a practice in London upon my return.
“Dearest Mrs. Hudson, please, please forgive me,” he said earnestly. “I’ll clean up my room first thing in the morning. There will be no chemical experiments, no indoor shooting, and no violin playing in the middle of the night, for a week—for two weeks—for a month! And double pay for the rent, how about that?”
“Watson,” he said rigidly. “What is the meaning of this?”
It was not. The next morning I accompanied the police to the falls, and there we examined the place together, bit by every bit. The verdict of the official forces offered no comfort, confirming that which I had feared most. There had been a struggle, and it had been fatal for both opponents. Recovery of the bodies would not be feasible.
No one dared disobey. They all scurried away as quickly as they could, leaving me and the gargantuan man alone face to face.
“Until then you are welcome to stay,” I replied, regret burning in my chest.
I embraced him. He breathed out and leaned into me.
“Please forgive my brother, Doctor,” Holmes said at last. “He was upset, thinking I was dead.”
Lestrade descended the stairs and hid under the counter closest to the Christmas tree while Holmes and I remained in the shadows of the gallery, from which we could observe everything below. Our waiting stretched ahead for hours, but I was only happy to be at Holmes’s side, for there had been a time when I had had no hope of ever sharing it with him again.
Holmes announces his engagement to Agatha, Milverton’s maid. I take Watson’s congratulations as humorous, since any engagement in Holmes’s case must be a ruse, especially if he is in a relationship with Watson:
Holmes’s rhythm grew erratic, his breath ragged, as we both were getting close to the edge again. He went slower, and I straightened myself up so that my back touched his chest. We kissed tenderly while he caressed my chest and teased my nipples, and then he slid out of me. We laid ourselves down on the bed, and he spread his legs for me, his prick standing at attention. I too knew the kind of foreplay he wanted. I applied a copious amount of vaseline on my two fingers and slathered his entrance, tapping at the rim lightly. Holmes threw back his head and closed his eyes with a sigh. Circling my thumb along his perineum, I pushed my forefinger in and stroked him inside. When I prodded a small, round mound, Holmes let out a luxurious moan. As I kept fondling it, Holmes was grunting quietly, slack-mouthed, his gaze heavy-lidded and unseeing. I added my middle finger and gradually increased the intensity, now thrusting deeper, now brushing against the sensitive spot until he was trembling and clenching his arse. My stiff member was leaking for him, but I wasn’t done with titillating him yet.
“Certainly, certainly. Oh, Mr. Holmes, always takes matters to heart a bit too much.” Lestrade sighed sympathetically and hurried off to hail a cab.
“Careful,” Sherlock’s laughing voice admonished.
.” Holmes chuckled at my widened eyes and lengthened face. “The sender is your ardent reader who obviously took to heart the lesson about typewriters and handwriting.”
I loosened my tie, suddenly feeling hot. What on earth was happening to me? I had never found men in uniform particularly attractive. Soldiers, sailors, or telegraph boys were often on par with common streetwalkers, offering themselves to anyone willing to pay. But John was a different matter. His honour, his bravery, his loyalty, all his finest qualities seemed to shine as he was standing at attention, devastatingly handsome in military attire. It was a lethal combination. I was slain outright.
I was numb all over. In his state Holmes wouldn’t get far, and there was nothing, nothing I could do. The screams from the market returned me to the battlefield, making me smell the rancid stench of gunpowder and rotting flesh. I kept repeating to myself that it wasn’t real, none of it was real.
As if struck by lightning, I stood gaping like a fish.
“Whatever do you mean?” I whispered.
“Let’s begin with counting. One—”
Moriarty laughed, gave me a contemptuous look, and waved his hand.
There are cases I chronicle not for the sake of publishing but to preserve fond memories associated with them. Then the painstaking editing is unnecessary, and everything can be told as it was.
”. But ultimately he fails to see the true nature of a family he befriends. As one of the reviewers at goodreads put it, his help makes surrounding people “lazy and entitled rather than grateful”. It is an interesting parallel with Doyle himself who soon after that became quite rich thanks to Holmes stories. Did his family, who had had to struggle, become lazy and entitled when ACD helped them out? He spared his sisters from the necessity of working abroad as governesses (which might have been unsafe for a woman alone in a different country, entirely at the mercy of her employers. Perhaps such Holmes stories as “The Solitary Cyclist” or “The Copper Beeches” were in some ways inspired by ACD’s sisters’ work). Thanks to financial security ACD was able to provide the best treatment for his first wife, who had contracted tuberculosis, and thus extend her lifespan for much longer than doctors had predicted. ACD provided stability and prosperity for his mother who had raised him and his siblings practically alone. However, ACD’s sons by his second marriage did lead a playboy lifestyle, so there’s no definite answer.
I couldn’t hold back any longer and embraced him—it had been an extremely narrow escape.
When our lips parted, I kissed John’s neck and then shoulder, lavishing with attention the rugged bullet scar. I longed to feel his skin against mine, yet there was something peculiarly erotic in his being stark naked while I remained fully dressed. John steadied himself, clutching the mantelpiece with both hands again. He was ready for more rough fucking. I obliged and proceeded to slam into him relentlessly so that he sobbed in bliss. He would be sore the next day. Sitting and walking would remind him of our tryst, and he would smile to himself in his consulting-room or on his way to a patient.
“Mr. Holmes,” he said in a very level tone. “Your concern on Sherlock’s behalf is understandable. Let me assure you that it is groundless. I would marry him if it were possible. Does it make my intentions clear? Good evening.”
I cursed under my breath. No, the toy was a poor substitute. Imagination could never replace the real thing. I removed the toy and glanced at it scornfully. What was John doing now? Probably talking to a tipsy young officer, trying to weasel out the information I had requested. Was the young officer flirting with him? Was some other man’s gaze raking shamelessly along my John’s body? My erection flagged. Gritting my teeth, I brought myself in order and washed the toy. Back in the bedroom, I tossed the toy into the drawer where it belonged and slammed the drawer shut.
“What have you deduced so far?” Holmes asked, smiling, as we put down our luggage.
“Capital!” John said, beaming. “This mad race will come to an end at last?”
Later, we shared the afterglow, our bodies pressed together. We were clean and sated, snuggling in our own small world, for we had drawn the curtains of the bedposts. Sherlock nuzzled my neck and breathed in with relish. His lips brushed over my skin as if he wished to say something, but then he sighed.
In the 3GAR discussion it was noted that Watson lets us see Holmes’s humanity very frequently. This story is no exception; here we go, cracks in the marble, as Jeremy Brett called them:
5) In EMPT and NORW Watson explained that he didn’t publish new stories for a long time due to Holmes’s explicit request. Taking into account that pressmen chased Doyle himself, it’s rather suggestive why Holmes didn’t want any more attention at that point of his life (in contrast with STUD where he lamented the lack of opportunities to make his name famous).
Peeking over my newspaper, I could see that Holmes was in an equally dazed state. He was browsing through his clippings absent-mindedly, his black clay pipe dangling unlit from between his lips. The lips which were a little chapped and an absolute delight to kiss.
“Come in, will you,” John said suddenly, without turning his head towards the door. “Or would you prefer to come where you are, just from watching?”
Whatever Holmes was doing, it took him until tea-time. His face betrayed nothing regarding the results of his outing, and all evening he spoke only of unrelated matters. As usual in such situations, I didn’t try to force his confidence. If he chose not to share, then he wasn’t ready yet.
For the rest of the time he chatted about opera, recent inventions, and electricity, his eyes twinkling, perfectly aware of my attempts to read him and failing to do so. It clearly pleased him that after all these years he hadn’t lost his ability to mystify me.
I had never had any resentment towards Mycroft, but at that moment I did. I loathed his business-like tone and his cold aloofness which didn’t differ from his usual bearing in the slightest. If he was hiding his grief, he was doing very well indeed, for there was no sign of it. His younger brother was dead, and the man was left alone in the whole world, for God’s sake! His conduct convinced me that whatever nonsense I had written about Sherlock’s being an emotionless machine, it was actually true about Mycroft Holmes. While Sherlock had merely taken on that mantle to protect himself, Mycroft seemed truly heartless.
The Irregulars departed at about eight o’clock in the evening, with full stomachs and happy with their new outfits.
More and more glimpses follow as the story nears its culmination: Holmes is irritable, Holmes can’t sleep, and when the solution dawns upon him, Holmes cries out,
“John,” he called sleepily after a while.
“Stamford,” Holmes said thoughtfully. “Yes, I know the chap. Perhaps I’ll have an opportunity to thank him properly. And, for that matter, you, Doctor. You really must let me go. If I stay, it could mean trouble for you.”
“Tut, tut,” Mycroft replied in that infuriatingly dispassionate tone of his, so familiar to me since my childhood. “The doctor’s grief is safer for you both and most convincing for others. He burned your will in the presence of the solicitor, by the way. Said he didn’t want anything in benefit from it and that he would rather your possessions went to me.”
I agreed eagerly. He must have contemplated every possibility and arrived at the conclusion that there was no better course of action than to step away from the problem for a while.
Then the events unfold roughly in the same way as in
“Yes, he sent a note all of a sudden, asking me to take over for a few days,” I replied. “Considering how many times he helped out when I had to leave on a short notice, it’s only fair to return the favour. What about you? Any progress with your case?”
I functioned as if an automaton, participating in the necessary proceedings, answering questions and so on. A local newspaper requested an interview from me, but I declined, of course. There was nothing else to be done in Meiringen. It was time to return to London.
“Be quiet,” I interrupted him. “There are reasons for this. Just answer when I ask you.”
(1908), although here similarities end: these two stories have completely different plots.
“Good night, Mr. Holmes. Sleep well,” the Colonel said as Sherlock left the room.
“Who visited you? Not a regular patient?”
When we reached a narrow alley with linen drying on washlines stretched from wall to wall, our dogcart came to a skidding halt, and the next moment we were tearing through discoloured sheets and clothes. We were dashing from one winding passage to another, the black carriage always looming behind us on a wider street. The throbbing in my bad ankle grew into a raging cold fire spreading from the once-torn
The following passage is curious for two reasons:
(See the end of the chapter for
Seeing off the police-van which was driving the malignant Jonas Oldacre away, I drew a sigh of relief. The past few days had been harrowing for Holmes, who had refused to eat, saying that it would slow him down. The diet of cigarettes and coffee was now taking its toll, for Holmes’s face was pallid as he peered after the van, his bloodless lips curved up in a triumphant smile. When the carriage disappeared around the corner, I touched Holmes’s elbow. It was time to go home and rest. Holmes nodded, but suddenly he swayed and staggered, grasping for me. The next instant he collapsed senseless into my arms. My heart racing, I held him and cursed inwardly that I hadn’t taken my medical bag with me.
“Yes, quite. Just sleepy.”
“Exactly. Nevertheless, the message contained all the necessary information: the figurine had a label from Hamleys which answered the question of the place.”
“You’ll thank me later,” I assured him.
Holmes shook his head.
“I can explain,” Holmes blurted out.
Mrs. Hudson met me in the hall, her face drawn in anxiety and her red-rimmed eyes imploring.
I turned around. There was such remorse in his eyes that my heart clenched. At that moment he was not a triumphant detective, a grown and formidable man, but a scared boy.
I chuckled. The outlook wasn’t too bad. I tested the fellow, and he rang true so far. He was devoted to my brother. He was hot-headed, but didn’t always allow his emotions to reign. There was some hope in that.
I averted my eyes and didn’t reply. As always, he worried about me, he wished to help and offered his comfort. I wasn’t worth any of it.
He threw his napkin on the table and stalked off past the butler who was bringing in the dessert.
There was no sign of fatigue or melancholy in his mischievous eyes. It pleased me to no end.
“What do you feel when your patient dies on the operating table?” I murmured.
My own howl woke me. At first I was disoriented and couldn’t understand where I was, but gradually I realised that I was sitting on the floor in Sherlock’s room, propped against the wardrobe. Hurried steps approached, accompanied by the rustle of a dress.
“Whatever is the matter?” I croaked, rubbing my eyes.
“No, that will be the first place they’ll look.”
“It was a worthy match, but you’re dying in vain,” Moriarty sneered. “You think you destroyed my organisation? Why, it was just the tip of the ice—”
“Are you serious?” I stared at him. “Good Heavens, you are.”
As soon as the case started to look like a commonplace burglary with a murder, Holmes is disappointed. Note the simile Watson uses as a medical man:
“Yes, the work is only half-done.”
Plain-clothes men rushed in, and soon they were walking Saville out to a four-wheeler. I longed to hug Holmes but had to refrain from it. He gave me a gentle look, aware of my feelings.
I agreed, intending to hand over the patient to the family physician afterwards, as professional etiquette required. Mrs. Hudson was already trotting up with my medical bag. I nodded my thanks, and off we were in an instant, rattling towards a magnificent estate which was looming in the distance.
Now that we are together at last, I don’t want to look back anymore. Sherlock is here beside me. Tomorrow is the 4th of May, and I shall meet the new day with my mind and soul at peace.
Watson immediately has a sense of affinity with Mr. Cubitt. It is clear from Watson’s description of the man:
There I sat in a stupor and didn’t hear at first that someone was talking to me. A pat on my shoulder snapped me out of my reverie. It was a street urchin of about ten years old, grubby and barefoot.
“And were you?” Sherlock asked, very tense.
(1951) deals with stolen submarine designs the loss of which is a matter of national security. So does
In the Granada adaptation “my friend and colleague” is something of a standard introduction of Watson made by Holmes to anyone. Here it is in the Canon:
I declined an offer to be brought back in the carriage, for I needed to process the news in solitude. I walked to the village slowly. It is impossible to describe how profound my joy and relief were. Sherlock was alive. He was out there, somewhere.
” about him, and he can’t resist MacCoy’s influence, even though Edward’s family try hard to separate them.
Judging by Sherlock’s complacent expression, my amazement was exactly what he had counted on.
I suppressed an urge to jump to my feet and pace about the room. We smoked in silence for a while, minutes dragging by agonisingly, and then, at last, the sound of brisk steps came from the hall. I quietly drew a relieved breath, for I would recognise that gait any time, anywhere.
“What about the case, Holmes?” I reminded him.
. I had had the gall to deem myself more proficient than the police when in fact I was just a self-important fool.
hurt by Holmes’s words during the years of their companionship, Holmes always, always apologised. Et voilà, Watson downplaying his own merits and glorifying Holmes. Also, judging by 3GAR, I bet Holmes defended Watson from Green’s assault much more fiercely than Watson described.
“Dr. Watson, we heard that you were here,” he said. “Sir Philip D’Aeth of Knowlton Court suddenly fell ill, and Dr. Millbank is out, making the rounds. Could you please come at once, sir?”
(1891) caught my eye because of the likeness of the name with E. W. Hornung’s A. J. Raffles (1899) who made his appearance a few years later. This is a short novel ACD wrote while studying ophthalmology in Vienna, and apparently the Holmes vibe was strong in him at the time because the protagonist, Raffles Haw:
is well-known: its sales plummeted. I hadn’t been interested in money in the first place and frankly was relieved to have stopped there. I missed Sherlock. God, how I missed him. Turning to our past cases had made me feel his absence all the more keenly. My self-control was precarious, and I had to preserve my reason to be reunited with him one day.
instead of the expected Christmas-themed story, hit me like a bolt out of the blue. John was severing the ties. There would be no further instalments. He presented to the world his version of my demise, having expanded and fictionalised the newspaper article he had written in ‘91 while he was still believing me to be dead.
—Arthur Conan Doyle,
Our sanctum sheltered him like a cocoon from the outside world, which kept talking about the arrest of Baron Maupertuis.
It was Sunday, so my surgery was empty, and no one could see Holmes descend the stairs and sneak into the kitchen. I took a fresh issue of
“The padded suit is so cumbersome,” he said.
By this point Watson has known Holmes for years, but his admiration of the man never wanes:
, the whole blackmailing ordeal happens due to the foolishness of the European Secretary’s wife: “
Quite remarkable continuity, isn’t it? ACD might forget that Mary Morstan was an orphan (or add this inconsistency on purpose), but it seems that he had a pretty clear view of Holmes as a man with a heart of gold right from the start. In the only video interview (1927) he calls Watson ‘stupid’ (which sounds as if it’s in jest rather than in earnest), while in BLAN (1926) he writes:
“What did they look like?” I asked, pouring John some brandy.
We arrived at an imposing solicitor practice in the City. Numerous clerks were bustling about in a large, crowded office. The choice of place was strange for such an intimate matter, especially considering how particular the Holmes brothers were in terms of privacy. I could feel sidelong stares and hear hushed whispers as we headed to one of the meeting-rooms. It turned my stomach, but I marched on, trying to preserve my composure. Mycroft was so much better at that.
He captured my mouth and kissed me roughly, demandingly until I was breathless and so hard it was maddening.
“Beeswax?!”
He kissed me fiercely, his joy taking my breath away. I put my hands on his hips and brought our groins together. John rubbed against me, the heat of his hardness seeping through the fabric. My trousers and drawers felt more and more confining as my prick swelled with each thrust of John’s hips. When the rhythm faltered, I knelt and dove under the skirt of his nightshirt. I nuzzled his hardening prick, inhaling the heady scent of his arousal. His coarse pubic hair grazed my cheek, making me shiver and tingle. I trailed kisses along his prick until I reached the crown. John gasped quietly when I teased the slit with the tip of my tongue. Then I took him into my mouth as deeply as I could and started to suck in earnest, caressing his bollocks with my hand at the same time. My ministrations quickly coaxed John to full stand. He moaned and rocked his hips, his rigid prick pushing into my throat. I suppressed my gag reflex, opened up wider and swallowed him deeper. He was as careful as ever. While he knew that my arse could take a decent pounding, he was always gentle with my throat, too gentle even. He wouldn’t risk a more vigorous pace, for the very possibility it might hurt me was unacceptable to him.
Slowly, teasingly, we began to undress each other, stealing furtive kisses. When we were down to our shirts and trousers, with a cheeky grin Holmes pulled at one of my braces, and it smacked me across the nipple. I retaliated by slapping his arse. He laughed, his cheeks flushed and his eyes sparkling. He was gorgeous. His foot tripped mine quite deliberately, and we fell onto the bed, giggling. I pinned him underneath me and kissed him hard. We frotted through the clothes, struggling with buttons and devouring each other’s mouths. Somehow we managed to undo our flies and finally pressed our pricks together. There was no need to restrain the blissful groans which escaped our lips; no one would hear us here. Sherlock stroked us both with his long, deft fingers, and we leaked, sliding faster. At one point we had to pause, for we were getting too close to the crisis.
Blood rushing in my ears, I rose, snatched the will from the desk, and strode to the fireplace. The solicitor watched me startled and confused while Mycroft was… intrigued.
“The plate,” Swinsby said through his teeth, extending his hand.
“Could you send a word to your brother? Perhaps he can do something to spare her interrogations and such,” I whispered to Holmes.
“Yes, and it clarified matters a great deal. Note that it was delivered not to Baker Street, but to the gymnasium we frequent. The proprietor would surely notify me of its discovery the very day, had we not been there. Or, likelier still, the sender saw us. Why not just speak to me then?”
The police departed with their prize. I had promised Lestrade to provide the soft-nosed bullet, a twin of that which had killed the hapless Ronald Adair. John and I stood in the centre of the empty room in the circle of dim light from the street lamps outside. It was difficult to believe that we were finally free. John ran his fingers along my neck where the skin was tender to the touch.
”—which implies that Watson lives there too. So this whole “
And he did describe it to me in detail. It was more than a method—it was a science, an art which seemed so fanciful that I wouldn’t have believed it was possible, yet Holmes read my late brother’s life story from the watch I had inherited from him. It was fascinating. We talked and talked until we fell asleep. That night for the first time in a long while no nightmares bothered me.
where
Which, as many pointed out before, can be interpreted in more ways than one. If we look between the lines, the truth is right there, concealed, but not that much.
“John,” Sherlock warned in a husky voice when it became too much for him.
My back ached from the crooked posture I had been maintaining for hours. When I sat down, our eyes met again. I should have dropped the pretence at once but couldn’t bring myself to do it. John gave his utmost attention to the nonsense I was inventing on the spot about my being a bookseller, etc., etc. While I went on and on with my histrionics, he continued to regard me as a stranger. There seemed to be a sparkle of recognition in his tired gaze, but I waited in vain for him to acknowledge it.
When he deciphered Slaney’s threat:
“Yes, finally, ‘A Study in Scarlet’ is to make an appearance,” I replied, delighted by his enthusiasm.
“Not at all,” I replied.
I raised myself and embraced him. He kissed me forcefully, desperately, as if fearing a foolish step from me, the kind which had already crossed my mind.
“Our names won’t tell you anything,” Holmes said. “But you have something we’re after. I know where it is, and you’ll come with us at once. If you’re considering running away, remember, I have a lovely picture of you.”
John had been justified in his apprehension and reluctance. His writings re-opened the wounds which had just started to skin over. And yet revisiting the past cleaned them, providing for a proper healing. At last the suppressed tension between us began to melt away.
The twilight had already closed in, and the still busy street was lit by the yellow glow of lamps. I drew down my hat and turned up my collar to avoid being recognised, but apparently an especially pertinacious reporter had been watching the house. He called after me as I walked. When I quickened my pace, he followed me and caught me by the sleeve.
“Take a seat, Mrs. Langley, and make yourself comfortable,” Holmes greeted her with an easy courtesy, motioning her to the sofa. “Watson, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Ellen Langley, who works as a charwoman at Hamleys and at the gymnasium you and I attend.”
With that, he left as abruptly as he had arrived. His departure was a relief. What a strange family, one sibling an outlaw, and the other the Queen’s hound. I was caught up in the middle of some sort of devilish plot, and my head was bursting with questions.
“It made me feel nostalgic, not sad,” I assured him hastily. “I haven’t been to a ball for ages.”
“I saw your article in the
, etc., etc. pleaded with Sherlock for an interview or a commentary. He turned them all down, so instead reporters switched to me and then Mrs. Hudson, waiting whenever either of us showed at the door. It was one of the reasons I started contemplating a holiday in the country. The main reason was Sherlock’s well-being, however. Fresh air and some exercise would surely facilitate his convalescence if only a suitable place could be found. And soon an opportunity presented itself.
The next day John was glowing, and some colour had returned to his countenance. It warmed my heart endlessly that he was showing signs of recovery which, I hoped, would be steady with the passage of time.
The proprietor himself, as spry and dandyish as ever, greeted us from behind the counter when we entered the reception room. He was a good acquaintance of ours and a former client. A few years ago we had helped him to untangle a delicate matter which otherwise would have produced a grievous effect upon his thriving business.
“God, no more gambling, ever,” I muttered as Holmes and I were rattling in a cab to Baker Street. “I shall be damned if I’m in your debt again.”
“Pray do so tonight,” I said, grinning in anticipation. Soon the solution would be in our hands. It was a sheer pleasure to untangle that little conundrum.
He gave a start upon hearing his Christian name and slowly turned to face me, somewhat perplexed. His dejected look was heartbreaking. Before I knew what I was doing, I dashed to him and embraced him. He froze, and there was a gentle clink as he dropped the syringe in surprise.
As I write this entry before retiring to bed, I cannot but wonder at the way our friendship is blossoming. Yet again Holmes made me believe in my own abilities and showed me that my life isn’t over at twenty-nine which I am turning in a couple of weeks. My health may be still frail and my prospects aren’t very promising, but it won’t do to give up. I shall work on a novel about the Hope case, and someday I will be able to buy a practice. Holmes inspires me. I don’t think I’ve ever admired anyone more, his quirks and all.
London had changed over the three years of my absence. I noted numerous differences during my drive to Baker Street. Emotions threatened to break through my crumbling composure as I rattled past the familiar places. My city. I would need to reacquaint myself with it.
John fell silent, upset by my churlishness but hardly surprised. I hated myself for hurting him, yet I would only hurt him more if we kept on. He seemed to have arrived at the same conclusion because he sighed and got to his feet. A terrifying thought crossed my mind as I watched him leave. What if he left me alone indeed? For good? One day he was bound to become disappointed and realise that the hero he glorified was in fact a mediocre bungler.
“How soon will he recover enough to travel, Doctor?”
Watson describes his excitement which is quite close to sexual arousal: doing something that is punishable by law, but for a good cause; risking reputation and even freedom to be with someone dear—the parallels are quite obvious, aren’t they?
“And there’s no chance to make him get what he deserves?”
So, both the Sleuth and the Doctor read each other easily, and there are always mutual respect and admiration, no matter how many years pass. Relationship goals™, really.
, where a vice-like tentacle had grabbed me. My limp was getting worse and worse. Holmes was out of breath too, pale and gasping for air like a fish thrown ashore. Something—a discarded bottle or a brick—got under my feet, and I tumbled down in a heap. I knew I wouldn’t be able to get up.
“Oh, John, do you realise what you’re saying? A stranger’s house, having to act properly, tolerate his family, and being unable to touch you or even look at you in a way that’s not appropriate for a friend!”
The man’s face was bruised, and there was blood all across his left shoulder, seeping through a makeshift bandage. The blood was scarlet, arterial; it was dripping rapidly down his arm as he was carried. There was no time to be lost. I told Stamford and Rance to lay the man gently onto the operating table which stood by the window, shielded by a screen from the rest of the consulting-room.
Amusement passed over Saville’s expressive face.
Later Watson mentions Holmes’s eyes again. It seems like Watson indeed pays more attention to Holmes than to anything else in the room:
He gave me a rather cheeky grin, turned, and went slowly towards the fireplace where it was warmer. Fair enough. If I wished to have him naked, he shouldn’t be chilled. The fire flickered merrily behind the screen, making John’s skin glow. John placed his hands on the mantelpiece, bent his back, widened his stance, and stuck out his bum a little. Those taut, round mounds were a work of art, a masterpiece for me alone to admire in private. How could I resist this siren call?
He shook his head.
“Good Heavens, Clara, I warned you against picking up anything left by unidentified persons. It’s a matter of your own safety first and foremost,” I chided her.
“No, no. Stay,” I said, clinging to him.
This development was indeed vexing, but it seemed even more so for Sherlock. After his return his priorities had shifted, and he tried very hard to keep a balance between work and our personal life.
“Constable Rance reported that he delivered to your surgery an injured man whose description matches that of the missing Mr. Munro. It was on Wednesday, at about quarter to two in the afternoon.”
We discovered a tin hip bath in the aforementioned lumber-room but agreed that filling it wasn’t worth the effort. It was much easier to share a kettle of hot water and employ the jug and the wash-basin in the bedroom.
Mine had a gaping hole. I needed to do something which would distract me from the emptiness, at least during the daytime. Outside, the journalists had cleared off, so I decided to take advantage of that to visit Jackson, who was kindly treating my patients in my absence.
It was not out of carelessness that Watson didn’t comply with Holmes’s request about the ear, but it’s because by that time he
“You as good as threw him out when he was only concerned on your behalf.”
“Who indeed,” I muttered.
Please, John, I thought in despair. You must have recognised me. Are you giving me the taste of my own medicine? Is this a way of telling me that you wish to have nothing to do with me? If that were the case, you would have said so in a straightforward fashion. It is not like you at all to be cruel.
John had a true talent. At last I realised it, as did the rest of the world. His stories gained a tremendous following, and John became a celebrity. Reading his interviews in the press uplifted my spirits. It amused me how John repeatedly declined to answer questions about his personal life and wife, referring to his wish for privacy. Instead, he discussed at length his experiences abroad and combining his medical practice with writing. He always managed to sneak in a casual reference, a seemingly nonsensical play on words or a joke that would fall on the deaf ears of the public but held special meaning for me. Whenever I was on the verge of a nervous collapse, I thumbed through the newspaper cuttings or grabbed a volume of
He sat up abruptly, and his face grew ashen at once.
I begged Holmes to explain to me the particulars. When he did, I had a strong urge to curse in the foulest language.
At last, the police departed, and all was quiet again. The final act of the play was typical for 221b, Baker Street: Holmes and I were sitting in our armchairs on either side of the fire.
At the same instant Holmes and I dashed down the stairs. Saville ignored Lestrade ostentatiously, and just as Lestrade was about to grab him, Saville attacked the Inspector. We ran up to them in mere seconds, but the fight was already over—Saville had got hold of Lestrade’s weapon, hooked an arm around Lestrade’s neck from behind, and pressed the barrel to Lestrade’s head.
“Perfect,” I assured him. “Just wait a minute before you go.”
In the hot room we lounged side by side, our hearts pounding. John’s wet hair stuck to his forehead, sweat trickling down his eyebrows and moustache. Being more accustomed to high temperatures, he bore the heat better than me, though, for I felt like I was about to melt. Yet it was necessary to expel the remains of our ailments. We kissed and frigged each other lazily, too languid for anything more. After a while, giving my pulsing cock an affectionate squeeze, John declared that the maximum therapeutic effect was achieved. I was only glad to defer to his professional opinion.
“It must take a lot of effort and time to maintain everything,” I mused.
“What would you say to soaking in a fragrant bath?” Sherlock asked after we had lazed about some more.
“Remove your clothes,” John ordered. “Let me examine you.”
“Well, Mr. Holmes, whatever you did, it didn’t seem that the policeman was aware of it. He had no interest in you, and there are no bobbies waiting for you at the door.”
For safety reasons we couldn’t address each other by names or discuss details.
“Ah, the one who’s been pestering you with his invitations.” Sherlock snorted.
“Leave me, Sherlock. Save yourself,” I wheezed.
Holmes’s plan worked like a charm. With his unequalled acting he managed to wheedle a confession from Smith and even trick the villain into sending a signal to the police ambush waiting outside. It took an athletic private detective, a former army doctor, and a police inspector to apprehend the giant of a zoologist, and the assistance of two more constables to put him into the police van. Needless to say, it was quite an exciting diversion from my everyday medical routine.
8. For a person who claims to have never loved, Holmes knows and understands what love is really well. Would he be able to, if it were a completely alien notion to him?
Fun facts for history nerds:
The next day Holmes is busy with the case, but leaves Watson a note asking to be there for him:
I stroked his hair lazily, my brain and my body sluggish.
When he finally reunites with his missing friend, Godfrey:
When I showed the telegram to Holmes just in case, his expression darkened.
In the story called
“Have you a warrant?”
“Come, you should lie down. This whole business must have been very taxing for you.”
Yet physical qualities alone would not have been enough to capture Sherlock. Watson might not possess a particularly sharp mind, but he was quite bright, brighter than an average person. He was delighted, even awed, to meet me because I was Sherlock’s brother. It was amusing to see his astonishment at the differences between Sherlock and myself. He hung on Sherlock’s every word, taking copious notes, and during the investigation itself proved to be a good helpmate to Sherlock. No wonder Sherlock had become so emotionally invested in him.
Not five minutes later I had reason to bless John’s foresight, for we heard a door open and close far off, on the ground floor. As furtive, careful steps approached, echoing in the corridor, my limbs quivered with a nervous tension I couldn’t subdue.
