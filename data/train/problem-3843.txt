Dean wasn’t sure what he expected to see when he opened the bathroom door, but the sight that greeted him was beyond his wildest fantasies.
Cas feels anxiety speed up his heart rate as Dean wordlessly pulls over into an empty parking lot, parks the Impala, and turns off the engine.
“Well, I think the moans and everything really did the telling for us, but yeah. He knows about us now. And he actually seems pretty cool about the whole thing. Kinda smug, actually.”
“I, ohhhhh, Dean, yes.”  Fuck.  Why did he have to keep using his name?  At this rate he won’t last much longer.
Castiel cuts Dean off with a moan as he pulls him into another deep kiss. “Yes! Yes, I want that, Dean,” he breaths out against Dean’s lips.
Sometimes, though, when you’ve all had a long day and need some R&R, having the option for more than one person to use the bathroom at a time is nice.
Dean is leaning back with his shoulders and head resting against the shower wall, his hips thrust forward, helping to push his cock through his tight fist.  Cas leans towards him, placing his unoccupied hand against the tiles just over Dean’s shoulder.  There is no constant contact between them, just the briefest of touches that happens as they chase their respective climaxes.
Castiel must have dozed off because when he opens his eyes he is alone in Dean’s bed, covered in a soft blanket and still completely naked.  He gets himself up and finds some of Dean’s pajama pants and a t-shirt.  He then ventures out into the bunker and finds Dean in the kitchen, making sandwiches and completely oblivious to Cas entering the room.  Cas knows that Dean is oblivious to his presence, because if Dean knew Cas was there, he probably would stop whistling and swishing his hips back and forth.
Once Dean is well prepped, Cas begins to feel the pressure of the situation. He so desperately wants to feel all of Dean, but he wants to make sure it is just as good for Dean as it is for him. Dean seems to sense his hesitation, or maybe he is just getting impatient himself, because he sits up to take Cas’ face in his hands to guide him into a soft and passionate kiss.
Back on the road Dean’s mind was still buzzing with the images from a few moments ago.  And Cas’s inquisitive mind was no help.
“No! Well, probably if you were in a motel shower and trying to keep it a secret from me and Sam, then, yeah, too loud for that.  But right now, it was fine.”
Dean expects resistance from Sam. He has always been more concerned about privacy. But to his surprise Sam just sighs and says, “Yeah. I guess that works. But I call toilet.”
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  The first spurt of cum is hitting Dean’s stomach before quickly being washed away just a moment after he hears the strangled moan in the stall next door.  Cas is continuing to moan and Dean’s cock is continuing to spasm in tandem as his orgasm crests and subsides, leaving him panting with the water still falling over him.  Dean can hear Cas breathing a few feet over and decides to give him a moment to collect himself.
“I mean, yeah.  If that is okay with you.”  Dean can’t be certain what sparked it, but a small whine comes from the other side of the wall.
Dean is more than okay with not talking with his brother about what they all had to do in a desperate moment, but he knows that he will be try to relive it with Cas as soon as possible.
Just hearing the word “cock” come from Cas was almost enough to push Dean over the edge. He was so close to something. He still couldn’t quite tell if it was an orgasm, a release of piss, or maybe both, all he knew was that he was right on the edge and he wanted it.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean smiles back and lets his hand drop so he can scoot back over behind the wheel and start the engine.
“Yes, Dean.  I would like that,” Cas replies in a hurry as he makes his way over to one of the three urinals on the wall.  He chooses the one in the middle (despite his previous advice from the Winchester brothers about proper men’s room etiquette) and quickly undoes the button and fly of his jeans.  Dean is standing just behind him looking over his right shoulder as he pulls down the front of his boxer briefs to take out his pink, swollen, wet cock.
“Unfortunately, I got back about twenty minutes ago,” Sam states, an amused smile on his face despite the obvious uneasiness in his stance as he sits with his arms crossed tightly over his chest. “I think you might have something you need to tell me.”
After a few more minutes, they find the wherewithal to disentangle their bodies and make their way to the lake to rinse off the evidence of their secluded fun.
“No, dude. You’re basing that off when you were so desperate you were about to piss yourself.  Of course it seemed like a lot. But you’ve never seen me get to that point. You don’t even know how much I can hold.”
Dean thrust up into Cas as he settles back onto his lap, their still hard cocks brushing against each other. “Fuck, Cas, come here,” Dean sighs as he runs his fingers through Cas’ unruly hair and pulls him into another kiss.
Dean is glad he can be of help to Cas and his exploration of all things human, but it was getting harder and harder (no pun intended) to stay calm, cool, and collected while answering his multitude of questions about the sex life of humans.  The conversation had started off with a simple check-in with Cas about how he had been adjusting and had veered into a discussion on sexual interests due to a recent viewing of some old “Sex and the City” episodes by Cas on one of his many random binges.
Dean steps into the bathtub, careful not to slip on the wet floor. Cas’ eyebrows jump to his hairline when he sees a completely naked Dean Winchester appear right in front of him. Dean takes advantage of his surprise and pulls Cas’ shirt up over his head and tosses it onto the pile of his own clothes. Dean puts one hand on the back of Cas’ neck and the other on his hip and pulls him into a delicious kiss.
“Okay, ahhhh, right, okay.  Umm, have you tried cupping your balls and rolling them a little with your hand?”
“Yeah, baby, of course.  Give me your hand,” Dean replies as he takes his hand from his cock and reaches towards him.
“Well, jerking off is usually done in private, and you are in the stall next to me, so this isn’t exactly private.  It would be rude and not just a little creepy to masturbate with someone else in the room when they don’t know it is happening.”
“I can definitely attest to the muscles part.  When I really had to urinate back at the motel that time, it felt so amazing when I finally got to go.  Almost as good as when I had an orgasm.”
Castiel lets out a wanton moan. He lets his head fall back and closes his eyes, trying to relax his body so he can let go.
“Just another minute, babe. When we get in there you can take the shower and I’ll use the sink. Okay?”
Cas finds just the right angle and Dean’s eyes shoot open when he gasps. They lock eyes and Dean snakes his hand down between them to begin stroking his straining cock. Cas feels his muscles tighten and the pressure builds inside him. He watches as Dean’s face contorts with pleasure, and Cas lets out a surprised gasp as he feels Dean’s body tense and clamp down around him. Dean throws his head back as hot cum splashes between them.
Sam’s stream starts first, the loud splash of it into the toilet bowl makes Castiel’s bladder give a sudden lurch and he feels a few drops escape before his cock is fully out of his underwear. As soon as his cock tip feels the cool air of the motel room his stream takes off straight across the shower hitting the wall just above the faucet. He can’t hold back the groan that escapes his throat as the dam finally breaks.
Dean was concerned at first, but that quickly turned to excitement and arousal as he grabbed his own bowl and followed after Cas.
The hunt had gone well.  Cas was understandably frustrated with the limitations of his human body, but like the loveable dork that he always was, he treated most of it like a research assignment.  Taking each new setback or awkward misstep as new data to add to is ever growing encyclopedic knowledge about being a human.
Cas really must have been desperate.  His stream was pale and thick and just kept coming.  Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away.  Luckily Cas was too blissed out with relieving himself that he didn’t look over to Dean and notice him staring.  Dean eventually turned his attention back to his own urgent business just as his stream was weakening.  As he pushed the last dregs out and shook the drops from the tip of his dick he felt a little blush reach his cheeks as he noticed his dick was getting a little firm.  He shook his head a bit to clear it, but it didn’t help that after he zipped up and looked back over to Cas, he was still pissing away.
“Trust me Sammy, I’m not being picky. I gotta piss just as bad as you. I’ll stop as soon as I find a motel.”
“Oh god, Cas.  You sound amazing,” Dean says with a smile as his pulls slowly and firmly up and down Cas’s shaft.  “You make me so hard.  Can I… can I try something?  Let me know if it’s too much.”
Cas’s eyes go wide and his breath quickens as he steps closer to Dean.  “Yes, that would be very okay.”
Dean ends the call and turns to Cas as he turns over the engine, “Well, turns out he’s not our guy.  Sam found some information in the lore that definitely means he couldn’t have been the thing that killed the victim.  We can head back and get some sleep.”
Cas expects Dean to say something, talk him through it like most of the other new experiences they have shared together.  But now, Dean is oddly silent.  His stare is entrancing and Cas finds his breath quickening just from the look in his eyes.
The three of them had just finished up a vampire hunt and were back at the bunker taking some time to rest up and recuperate.  They were sitting in the library, each with a book and their large water bottles.  Sam was wrapped up in some lore, Dean was absorbed in an old Julia Child cookbook, and Cas was passing the time with a little Tolkien.
“Yeah, shampoo is a great assistant in getting off.  A little of that in your palm to get the friction right and your golden.”  Dean could feel his cheeks pink a bit as he realized this conversation was veering into a discussion of technique and his dick was starting to get very interested.
Cas knows that it was definitely not a normal interaction between two friends to “jerk off”, as Dean calls it, while in the same room and while talking to each other.  But they didn’t see each other, or talk about each other, they just talked about what they were individually doing and Dean gave him some suggestions.  What makes it more complicated, though, is that Cas knows he was more effected by Dean being there and hearing him than he would have been with someone else coaching him through masturbation.  Since the “shower event”, as he has come to call it, Cas has tried masturbating a few more times.  Each time he starts out as Dean suggested, with picturing something that turns him on.  Cas has tried a lot of different images, but none are as instantly successful as picturing Dean.  Especially when Cas pictures Dean urinating into the Jack Daniels bottle at the motel room from a month ago.  Cas was surprised by how mesmerizing and erotic that looked.  At the time, he couldn’t pull his eyes away and he realized afterwards that his penis was firmer and his breath was labored.  Replaying that scene in his head later, when he was able to be alone and touch himself, brought on some of the best orgasms he has experienced in his short life as a human.
He tried to just fantasize about what he would want, what would feel good.  It gave him a few ideas, but there was still just too much pressure.  Cas wanted to be with Dean, that much he knew.  And he was fairly certain that Dean wanted to be with him.  Now all Cas needed to do was tell Dean what he wanted to do.  It was nice that Dean was so patient with Cas, letting him take the lead, but maybe this was the time for more guidance.
Dean spots Sam walking briskly along the side of the motel, holding a set of keys above his head to catch their attention.
Cas stares down at Dean’s cock in front of him.  It is already thicker than a few moments ago, reassuring Cas that his partner is looking forward to their plan.  However, watching Dean’s cock thicken is not helping with his issue of releasing his pent up piss.  Cas sighs and lets his head fall back and closes his eyes.  He takes slow breaths to calm himself and he can feel his muscles start to relax.
"OH MY GOD" they scream whispered to each other at the same time, sort of jumping up and down like twelve year old girls at a slumber party.  Dean smiled with his mouth wide open and pushed his hair back from his face in shock as Cas tried his hardeset to keep his snickering quiet.
That’s when all of a sudden, it hit him.  The song that his Mom used to sing to him and Sam every night before bed.  The song that he kept hidden in the back of his mind ever since she died.
Dean looked up urgently and kicked Gabe in the shin, making him fall over too, "Are you crazy?!" Dean scream whispered.  "What the hell are you doing?"
Ruby spoke up, "Actually, I was just thinking about how true that is, dude."  She walked over to him and grabbed the shirt, "I never thought about it before but, so often I just throw whatever I would throw away into the donation bin at home.  I'm glad you said something."
Cas was now looking at Dean with a questioning expression.  I guess it made sense that he found it strange.  Most people weren't completely enamored with their brother's girlfriend like Dean was.  Cas didn't really get a chance to know Jess since she was one more likely to sit and observe him amongst others than to engage him on her own.  Kind of like Cas, actually.
Oh.  Of course.  Those two snakes slithered out of it to make sure that Dean and Cas went alone.  Those dicks.  Dean just rolled his eyes and chuckled a little bit.  "Cas, if you don't want to go anymore, I completely understand."
The whole group burst into a sea of whoops and whistles and a few people yelling “GOD CAMP” at the top of their lungs.  Chuck paused as he clapped for a moment and waited for the reaction to subside.  “Before I let you all relax and dig into your smores completely, I have one more task for the night.  We will do this both tonight and tomorrow night, but before I get any eyerolls, only one person has to do it each night.”
Dean blinked a few times in order to come to terms with all that was happening in front of him, and then he suddenly realized that the two girls that were food fighting with Gabe were Bela and Ruby.  Dean just stood there staring for a minute when Balthazar finally noticed he had walked in and stopped himself from ballroom dancing to greet him.  "Deano!  I'm so glad you could make it!"
“Having a little trouble there, Cas?” Dean asks with a smirk. “You know there isn’t any time limit or anything. You can go ahead and get your measurement now. I’m sure it would be quite the relief.”
So, when Castiel discovered any new way to enjoy the human experience, he was all about taking advantage of it when he could.  One of his first discoveries for enjoyment was long, hot showers in the bunker.  Castiel sometimes felt like he could stand there for hours, just letting the strong spray work over his body.  So, when they all weren’t busy with a case or research or anything else, Cas was quick to indulge in his new favorite pass time.
“Of course, yeah, me too,” Dean says, adding one last kiss before letting his hands slide from Cas’s face.  “You go first.  I want to watch, if that’s okay.”
Cas stands, places his novel on the table, and gives Dean a steady look before making his way quickly up the stairs and into the bunker’s bathroom.
“Oh hell yeah,” Dean replies with a chuckle.  “There are plenty of humans out there who find a shower very enjoyable indeed, buddy.”
“Oh, probably too many to list, really.  There are some more common ones, but really, if you can think it, there is porn out there of it somewhere.  Rule 34, ya know?”
“Yes, keep going,” Cas says, too blissed out to be concerned with what Dean wants to do.  Then he lets out a little cry when he feels Dean bring their cocks together and grips them both in his large, slick hand.  “Yes, Dean, yes, yes…,” he pants, feeling his pleasure quickly build.
“Yes, Dean.  This is very okay.”  Dean smiled brightly back at his best friend and brought them back together for another sweet kiss.  Cas held on to Dean’s bicep, feeling if flex under his fingers.  His mind was whirling with more questions and feelings, but he tried to ignore them all to let himself just experience what Dean was offering.
“Okay.  Just let me know,” Dean says with a smirk and a wink and he turns his face down toward his cock where he tugs it gently a few times before Cas can see a small trickle quickly turn into a full stream.
Finally Cas reached the end of his piss and turned his head down to shake off his cock and tuck it back in his jeans.  He turned to face him and Dean felt a bit like a deer in headlights.  Luckily any awkwardness that was almost guaranteed to follow was disrupted by Sam returning from his secure location and suggesting they all get back in the car.
Dean is able to start religious education through his college.  There some interesting people in his class.
At that, Chuck cleared his throat and turned on the projector.  The PowerPoint slide was entitled, "Your Journey to the Sacrament" with a picture of the crucifix underneath.
Dean turned his head to see a tall redhead make eye contact with Castiel and watched her eyes light up in excitement.  She detached from the group of people she was with, and ran over to the two of them with her arms wide, "Castiel!  What are you doing here?"  She hugged him tight and Cas seemed to stutter step in her arms.
Once it started to get late, Dean could tell that Cas was exhausted.  He knew Cas would be too polite to say he was going to bed when everyone else was still up, but Dean knew he needed to go to bed.  He stood up and walked over to Cas, putting his hand out in front of him and said, "Alright, champ, let's go get you set up upstairs."
Cas finally looked back into Dean's eyes, and Dean could see the tears starting to pool up again.  "Well, you're safe here, Cas.  I hope you know that.  You can stay as long as you want."  Cas lifted the corner of his mouth into a small acknowledgement.  Dean continued, "Do you want to tell me what happened or do you need a minute?"
Cas stood up after taking his coat off in the seat, and reached up above their heads to put his backpack up in the cupboard for luggage.  Dean's eyes just happened to glance over at that moment, and caught the sliver of Castiel's torso peaking out from his shirt pulling up with the high reach of his arms.  Dean could see the line of dark fuzz trailing from his belly button to the waist of his dark blue jeans.  Dean could feel all of the saliva leave his mouth and his mouth parted slightly.  For a second he forgot to breath as he watched Castiel struggle to shove his backpack into the small space.  He was standing on the highest possible point of his tiptoes and the backpack was still trying to fall down on top of him.
"Thank you," he muttered, so softly that it made Dean want to cry, "Not everybody would've known what to do in that situation, and you didn't even bat an eye."
The Philadelphia Story was an old one.  So old in fact, that it was in black and white, and came out before the end of WWII.  Cas said it was a classic, but Dean hadn't seen this one either.  It was about a rich woman who had been divorced but was marrying a new man, that no one in her family seemed to like.  She assumed it was because he was poor, but it was actually because he could tell he didn't really love her for her.  The movie completely moved Dean.  He'd never seen a movie like it before.  It was a beautiful commentary about what it means to really love someone instead of just idolizing them, what it meant to be vulnerable and allow yourself and others to be just that.
Gabriel coughed a few times in an attempt to recover from the blow and Baz had tried to hide his smile and laughter by folding his lips into his own mouth and looking out the window.  Dean carefully looked over at Cas, who was looking at the ceiling now, with a look on his face that said,
That is, until he saw Dean, standing there, breathing heavily, his eyes seemingly sparking green in the moonlight.  His lips were glistening and they moved as Cas heard the muffled sound of the beautiful man’s voice.  Cas blinked hard and refocused when he felt a warm calloused hand on his cheek.
Dean looked into Castiel's eyes and Castiel stared right back into his.  The moment seemed to last forever until all of a sudden, Cas's face flashed with a tint of green.  Cas blinked a few times and stumbled a little before clasping his hand to his mouth.  Dean knew what was coming.
He stepped to the side and Dean's eyes widened as he saw the strobe lights dancing behind him, bathing what seemed to be a million people dancing and talking.  He couldn't believe how many people were here already.  Bela and Ruby leaned in to hug the guy.  "Adam!  You're already cross-faded.  I love that for you.", Ruby rubbed his hair into a mess before stepping in.  The rest of them followed.
Had that really just happened?  Did Dean just tell him that he loved him?  Cas felt his hands get slippery with sweat and worry as he felt his vision start to blur.
"Is that so?" Castiel replied, glaring over at Dean, who's asshole grin was directed toward Castiel directly now.
Gabriel took a big sigh and then placed his hand on Castiel's.  "You're my little brother.  I've known you your whole life, so I know what you're thinking."
Cas smiled sadly and let Dean help him up.  Cas stumbled once again, but managed to stay on his feet.  He was swaying as he patted down his pockets when he sighed, frustrated.  Dean looked at him in confusion before Cas explained, "I don't have my ID."  The realization hit Dean about why that was a problem.  He looked down at his watch, which read, 2:15am.
Cas's expression softened and he took a deep breath.  He moved his hand from Dean's chest, to his left hand, which was laying on his side against the driveway underneath them.  Dean's breath surged and he held it.  Cas grabbed his lower lip in his mouth and looked down at Dean's hand before saying, "I wish I could take your pain away."
Dean continued to eat his food in silence, as he remembered the way Castiel managed to look so good in a battered old ACDC shirt and some ripped jeans.
Dean was instantly filled with fury.  Why was Cas black and blue?  What the hell happened?  Instead of answering, Dean just leaned forward and cupped Cas's face in his hand gently, careful not to hurt Cas further since he had gone for the side with the bruise.  He traced his thumb lightly on Cas's cheek bone before he uttered, "Who did this to you?", his tone hushed.
They arrived at Patrick's Diner and ended up sitting somewhere different than normal, in order to have enough room for everyone that had come that day.  Dean walked Cas through the menu, telling him what was good and what wasn't worth trying.  Charlie came walking up to their table with the normal drinks for everyone when she realized that Cas was sitting there too.
As promised, Balthazar had left the door opened for Dean to just walk in.  Other than the door being open, the blaring music and laughter he heard coming from the suite helped Dean figured out which one was theirs.  He even thought he heard a girl shriek.  He walked in to find Balthazar dancing like he was at a ball in Cinderella to ACDC, and by himself no less, and Gabriel getting in a food fight with two other girls who were running around and jumping over furniture like they were in a hurdle race.  Castiel was no where to be seen.
That's when Dean's door was shoved open and Cas and Dean flew apart.  Cas blinked multiple times in surprise of where they had been and then looked at the floor and back at Dean.  Dean almost fell over.  Ellen stood at the doorway, her mouth parted slightly in her own shock before she shook her head quickly, trying to remind herself of why she had walked in in the first place.  She cleared her throat and put down the laundry basket filled with folded clothes down on the floor.  "I brought these up from the basement and washed them.  They're Dean's old clothes.  I noticed you were a little smaller than him so, I decided to bring you stuff from a few years ago so you weren't swimming." She smiled an awkward smile.  She looked at Dean apologetically before pivoting on her foot and exiting, leaving Dean's door open.
.  Dean covered his own face from no one in a moment of embarrassment.  How had he let that happen?  Sure he was a pretty drunk last night, but he wasn't the blasted one.  He had no excuse to tear up like he had.  He suddenly had to get out of there.  It was time to meet Charlie for coffee anyway.  He quickly grabbed his keys off of the hook and threw on his leather jacket and bookbag before going out the door, hoping that Benny would wake up and go to his own class before Cas did.
"You said it, brother." Gabriel called over from his chair, staring out into the space ahead of him with a glazed over expression.
He could hear Bobby laughing from behind the paper that he had picked up again.  Ellen responded, "Honey, it's important that you complete all the sacraments.  If for no other reason than to make me sleep better at night, baby."
Charlie looked at him, the confusion returning to her expression, "Why do you not sound excited?  This is a good thing isn't it?"
Cas was stomping around in between the trees violently.  He couldn’t even hear the snapping of branches or the crunching of leaves underneath his shoes.  All he could hear was the sound of his pulse roaring in his ears, and is second guessing thoughts bouncing off the walls in his brain.
Cas just blinked in surprise as his jaw dropped open and he spun his head to glare at his brother, who was just chuckling as he made eye contact with Cas.  There were about a million questions on Castiel's mind, and they were all flashing through his mind a mile a minute.  Overwhelmed by all of his thoughts, the only thing he could think to say is, "Why does everyone expect that I'll be the one giving the blow jobs?"
"Dude, I just saw your face go through about 15 different emotions in the 30 seconds you've been sitting there.", Gabe pointed out.
Dean snorted and walked over to Sam to help, "You would think after all these Sundays you would have learned how to tie a tie by now."
"Laugh it up, dick." Dean responded, "I'm just letting you know so you know where to find me if your dumb ass gets into any trouble."
“What the hell was that noise you just made, you weirdo?” Dean asked watching as Castiel’s face got pinker and pinker in front of him.
Chuck started.  “Alright everyone.  First of all, I would like to congratulate you all on completing your first day of your confirmation retreat!”
Shit.  Dean was so surprised by Cas being alone that he had forgotten.  He couldn't leave.  "Yeah", he muttered.
They were quiet for a little bit, when finally Balthazar saved him.  "Wait, are we talking about Benny Lafayette?"
"Don't judge me, Sam!  I love Mrs. Butterfield!  She makes the best chocolate chip cookies in Kansas, but I can only handle so much of the world's loudest instrument."  Dean squinted his eyes as the sun glared directly into them.  He hadn't even turned on the radio during the whole drive out of fear that his headache would worsen.
"Sam is your brother.  He's the one who is getting confirmed and why you have to get confirmed now.  Jo is your adoptive sister, who is 17 and will be 18 in a few months.  I remember you saying she was mildly aggressive.  Ellen is your adoptive mother, and Bobby is your adoptive father.  Ellen is affectionate and maternal by nature, Bobby is quiet but stern.  Ellen runs everything, but gracefully and with love." Cas seemed to roll off the information as if it was his own.  Dean was impressed.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.  The family stopped talking and looked at one another, looks of confusion spread across their faces.  Bobby spoke up, "Anyone invite someone over?"
It was time for their first community service run out of the four they had to do before the big day.  It had been written in the class calendar since the first day of religious ed, but it seemed to sneak up on Dean.  There were a lot of different choices to pick from.  There was working as a food organizer at a local food pantry, another choice was being a babysitter for the people at the local church who were in prayer group, and there was also a choice to organize the clothing that was donated to the homeless shelter into sizes, styles, and getting rid of the ruined clothes.  Dean knew there was no way he would want to work for the prayer group parents.  Nothing against them, he was sure they were great, but being locked in room with 15-20 kids with only other college kids to help?  Fuck that.  He would pull all of his hair out one hour into the job.  The other two options seemed okay though, and they were similar enough choices that Dean didn't really care which of the two he had to do.  He figured he'd just ask the gang what they preferred and doing whatever they picked.
"Oh definitely.", Dean agreed.  "I was about one beer away from passing out and Sam would have been terrified.  He let me have it when we got home.  I didn't know it then, but he was protecting me."
"Uh, thanks mama." Dean called out to her, eyes still frozen at the doorway.  He finally turned his head and blinked himself back from his swimming thoughts when he heard Cas pull his tooth brush out from the sandwich bag of toiletries he had brought with him.
Cas moved his hands from Dean’s face down to his shoulders, grabbing furiously at the back of Dean’s Patagonia to pull him even closer.  There was a fire under Castiel’s feet and he couldn’t get everything he wanted from Dean fast enough.  Cas finally parted his lips and Dean almost immediate dove his tongue in to explore Cas’s mouth.
This was the first time since then that he and Cas had actually talked to each other this close to normal since it had happened.  Dean felt warmth start to crawl across his chest.  He'd forgotten about how nice it was to talk to Cas, even though it was just one sentence.  Of course, it was still a little weird but, ya know, baby steps.
"And you didn't even bother to check who it was before you were ready to swing a bat at my head?!" Jess had a point, but Dean didn't think any of them would be here at this time.  Jess was still in high school after all.
"I was gonna say, 'that's what she said', but I think that reaction just about covers it." Balthazar commented, a huge shit eating grin on his face.
Castiel cleared his throat and the three of them looked over at him.  His dad, of course, gave him a cold look, but Hannah smiled from ear to ear and skipped over to him.
Slow burns are kind of my thing, folks.  91 Whiskey is a favorite of mine, if that's any indication of how long you're gonna have to wait.
Dean squeezed Cas's hand, "C'mon, Cas.  Let's get you inside.  We can go to the back porch and talk about this, so you don't have an audience."
Castiel leaned his head back from Dean's and looked at him fondly, brushing Dean's hair away from his face and petting it backwards.  Cas spoke after a few seconds just looking at Dean, "It's okay, Dean.  If I'm being perfectly honest, I was tired of it too."
Kelly smushed her face into his shoulder and snuggled in close.  Castiel could smell her sandalwood and honey perfume.
Charlie finally returned, sugar still on her face, but energy majorly shifted.  She smiled and took a breath before taking their orders.  Ellen ordered an omelet and so did Sam.  Bobby and Dean order the All American Breakfast and Jo order a bagel with cream cheese and bacon on the side.  "They are running me rampant this morning", she complained.
Cas leaned forward and grabbed his face with both hands, crushing his lips onto Dean’s before Dean could finish his sentence.  Cas felt as though his lungs were going to burst and that he could soar into space and never return.
The two of them spent the rest of the night alternating between each other's favorite movies.  Castiel insisted that Dean pick first since he was a guest, so they started with Tombstone.  After that, Castiel picked The Perks of Being a Wallflower, which Dean hadn't seen before, and cried while watching.  Then Dean picked Roadhouse, and Cas followed up with The Philadelphia Story.
Dean just laughed, and laid a hand on Castiel's shoulder, "See ya next Sunday, Cas.", and dropped his hand back to his side as he began to walk in the opposite direction.
Cas continued to stare into Dean's eyes.  "I drove.  I didn't know where else to go."  Castiel lived 4 hours away.  His eyes were filled with desperation and emotion, and Dean fought the urge to wrap his arms around him and hold on for dear life.  Dean looked behind him at what seemed to be Cas's family car, or at least the car that he leaves at home during the semester because Dean had never seen it before.  It was a beat up red truck that seemed to be built in the 80's.
Because I don't feel like saving this to my computer and AO3 doesn't save automatically there may be moments when the chapter isn't finished but is posted.  If I waited to write during times when I had time to write the whole thing I would never find time to write, lmao.  I am sorry in advance if you are left at an awkward stop or a cliff hanger or whatever.  Like, for real I'm sorry.  I will try and get things finished as soon as I can.
Dean opened his mouth to respond when Blondie chirped up, "Although that can be arranged, I mean, if you're into that kind of thing, sweetheart."
"I don't even know what that means, so I'm gonna go ahead and say no." Dean replied, getting irritated by his lack of understanding.
Dean's mouth slanted into an acknowledging half smirk before turning his head away from Castiel and looking over to Balthazar, who was sitting on the other side of his chair.  Dean normally loved it when they sandwiched Dean between them so he could feel more included, but in this moment, he wished that he was sitting on the end next to Balthazar.  Thankfully, Gabe was all the way on the other side of Cas so he didn't have to look over and see his mischievous glances between Dean and Cas if he didn't want to.  "How is studying going for you buddy?"
It was Saturday night, and they were out at Adam's again with Bela and Ruby.  Angry Orchard ciders were the drink that Gabriel had charmed out of the hands of Kahli, the woman who ran the local liquor store, tonight, and Dean and Cas were about 6 drinks in at this point.  Each of them had their arms around each other in a huddle type circle, and they were swaying and singing to Piano Man.  Dean and Castiel were standing next to each other, so Dean's finger tips were latched around Cas's neck and Cas's finger tips latched around Dean's.  They were facing each other now as they sang,
Cas was still reading as intently as he had been the first time Dean had walked in, except there was a significant difference in how far he had gotten into the book.  Cas had gotten a lot in during those few minutes.  Dean was impressed.  He adjusted his shirt nervously and made his way up to the row and tried to think of something cool to say.  When he got up there, though, all he did was look at him.
"In all honesty," Baz chimed in, "It's probably because he doesn't think Cas likes him.  I mean damn, Cas.  You're really making the poor boy work his ass off."
"Jealousy, cher.  Jealousy." Benny explained.  "Find someone else there to hit on, and do it in front of him.  If Castiel really likes you, he'll get all bent out of shape and weird about it.  If he doesn't like you like that, he will probably just ignore it, or even worse, he'll try and be a wing man for you.  Not to mention the added bonus of reminding him that you're not just gonna dote on him forever, and that there are plenty of other fish in the sea for you to catch if he doesn't get a move on."
Dean exhaled long and loud and squeezed Jess.  He was glad he was home too, but he was a little bit put out about it too.  His mind raced back to the text he had received a few minutes ago before he was seconds away from knocking out his brother's girl friend, his mood changing from hyperaware and ready to fight, back to the mopey and disheartened feeling he had before this whole misunderstanding.
Suddenly the two girls had vanished and it was just Dean and Castiel, standing and staring at each other.
Their Christmas was hectic as usual.  Everyone on the block stopped by the house to get a slice of Ellen's homemade pies and the house seemed more and more like an inn for about a week and a half.  It was nice, though.  The house was always more alive when there were more people there, and he hadn't seen a lot of the usual suspects since he had left for school in August.  He finally got a chance to catch up with his friend, Ash, from high school, and had his promise to come visit him on campus sometime.  By the time the holiday had ended, Dean was about two crescent rolls away from turning into one himself, and he was prepared for the new semester with lots of new clothes, movies, and books to bring back with him.
Castiel was quiet for a while.  When he finally spoke, he sounded distant.  "We were all just coming home from seeing my great aunt, and he was just sitting in our living room.  He has a beard now.  It looked nice on him.  He never really had a strong jaw line so, the beard was a good choice."
Dean sighed and leaned the bat up against the kitchen wall, "I'm sorry, dude.  If I knew it was you, I would have been much less alarming about my presence."
That's why panic ensued inside Dean's brain when he turned the corner of the classroom to find Castiel sitting in their row, alone.
He looked Dean in the eyes, remembering what Balthazar told him as he let his tongue peek out and glide along the prominent vein from tip, to base, back up to the tip.  He saw Dean’s breath catch in his chest as Dean’s head fell back.  Good sign.
With some spit rolling down Castiel, he was able to jack him more steadily, fisting him earnestly and sucking what he was sure would turn into bruises against Castiel’s neck.  Castiel was moaning and hissing like porn star and it was only making Dean impossibly harder.
It was the first snow fall of the season.  He thought about his family back home, knowing that they were all curled up in the family room watching Rudolph and drinking hot chocolate, like they do every year on the first snow fall.  It made him a little sad that he wasn't there, but the memories of following through with that tradition were enough to make him feel warm and fuzzy.  He looked over at Castiel, who was letting the snowflakes fall and collect on his hand as they fell into his hair.  The contrast of something so white and pure against his dark and smooth hair was stunning.
Gabe groaned unnecessarily loud and rolled his eyes to the ceiling, "Are you really gonna act like I haven't noticed all of this eye fucking and awkwardly romantic silences, when I'm around you two almost
Sorry guys.  I planned on writing a new chapter last night, but as some of you may know, 15x09 aired last night.  I was so shook and emotionally compromised after watching it to think about anything but that episode for at least 24 hours lmao.  I loved it so much and I cried the whole time.  If you watched it, I hope you enjoyed it, I sure as hell did!
Finally, Dean grunted and bit out one last obscenity before his cum started flooding Castiel’s mouth.  He swallowed around his dick in a frenzy, determined to get as much of it down his throat as he could, loving the salty stickiness.  He unfortunately felt some of it dribble down his chin, but he decided it was pretty good for a first time.
Meanwhile, he looks over to see Cas sitting rather stiffly and with a permanent furrowed brow, and Dean is pretty sure it has nothing to do with the book he is attempting to read. Dean would feel bad for him if the idea of watching Cas squirm in desperation wasn’t such a huge turn on. Dean can’t stop the smirk that reaches his face. Not only is he going to win this competition, but he is going to end up with some serious spank bank material for life.
“I just… I want to make sure I don’t do something that is ‘rude’ or ‘creepy’, but I’ve been feeling, well… the urge to masturbate or something of the sort, but I’m never sure when I should do that.  And we all are always around each other.  I don’t want to mess up and make you or Sam uncomfortable,” Castiel’s explanation was getting more rushed as he continued.  It was clear to Dean that this issue was causing him a lot of anxiety.
It’s like a lazy concept for a summer teen sex movie.  The horny kid gets left by his parents for a long weekend with the house to himself and finally gets some alone time with the girl he’s been crushing on for years.  Except in Dean’s case, the parents are his younger brother, the house is a bunker, and the girl is his newly-human best friend.  And, also this isn’t a movie; it’s his real life.
“Just give me one second,” Dean says as he quickly moves to the counter and takes a bottle of lotion and puts a dollop of it into his palm.  He rushes back over to Cas and meets his eyes and waits from him to give a little nod before stepping into his space and taking hold of Cas’s throbbing dick.
Sam had opted to wrap up some lingering questions he had with a little research while Dean and Cas made their way to the bathroom with towels in hand.  They both undressed down to their underwear in the large changing area, not so much as glancing at each other when they were so intent on enjoying a hot shower.  Stepping behind the curtains of neighboring shower stalls they lost their last article of clothing and started the water.
No more than five seconds later, he lets out another moan as his pent up piss finally releases in a gushing torrent out the tip of his dick to the waiting bowl below.
Now this? This was the start of something.  And Dean didn’t know whether to be excited or terrified.  Probably a bit of both.
Dean looks almost overwhelmed.  Cas’s stream is hitting him just below his navel and the piss is cascading down over his ever hardening cock.  Dean has a grip on the base of his dick and he is slowly stroking his hand up the shaft and through the waterfall of piss flowing down.  His mouth is open, taking deep breaths in and out, and his eyes are glued to the sight.
“Well, it’s not exactly legal, but desperate times call of desperate measures.  And there’s no one around anyway,” Sam explained.
As Dean’s stream finally weakens and comes to an end, he pushes Castiel back up right and takes hold of Cas’ cock to stroke it as piss continues to flow over Dean’s torso. Castiel moans and thrusts his hips to push his pissing cock through Dean’s firm hold.
Dean noticed a marked improvement in his alertness and mood fairly early on.  When they all stopped for lunch he even decided to eat the vegetables that came along with his meal, making Sam’s eyebrows rise up to his hairline.  In fact, everyone seemed to be in a decent mood.  They were singing along to his tunes and riding with the windows down.  Dean got a nice warm feeling in his chest about the new dynamics in their little band of hunters.  Team Free Will, back at it again, now with more stability and less drama.
“Thank you for being patient with me.  This was very enjoyable.  I think, uhh, I think I would like to do some research.  Find out what else I may like.  Could you, well, would you help me with that?”
Cas gasps with each pulse and Dean watches on in awe.  He’s never seen Cas as free and loose as he is now.  Cum splashing onto his stomach and panting with pleasure.
“Oh yeah!  People pretend that it is gross or immature, but everyone does it.  It just makes sense.”
“God, baby! You’re making me so hard right now. I’m not gonna be able to piss through this hardon,” Dean let out with a whine as he stroked his cock a little faster, precum dripping from the tip.
Dean takes the end of the towel still under Cas’s butt and uses it to clean off Cas’s stomach as best he can.  Then he lets himself collapse next to him on the bed.  Cas cuddles into his side and they both close their eyes as they let their breathing come back to normal.
It isn’t until the bottles have been refilled by Dean and returned to their place on the table that Cas feels the first bangs in his bladder.
Cas knew it was going to be hot and he knew it was going to be tight, but the reality of being inside of Dean Winchester is almost too much for him to comprehend. Dean’s groan pulls him from his revelry and reminds him to move.
Cas mimics Dean’s movements, stroking at the same pace over his hard dick.  Massaging over the head every few pulls.  Feeling the slippery precum coat his hand and aide in the slide back down over the shaft.
“Oh!  Oh, Dean,” he exclaims as he quickly lets his limbs rest back on the mattress.  Dean opens his eyes to see Cas’s hands flexing on the sheets, trying to find purchase as Dean works his mouth up and down his shaft, making it slick.  Dean takes one of Cas’s hands and places it on the back of his head.  Cas immediately runs his fingertips through the short hairs at the nape of his neck, being careful not to push down.  Dean moans and it sends a shockwave through Cas that has him throwing his head back, stretching his neck taught.
Dean moves his hands up to tug the towel free and let it drape one either side of Cas lying on the bed.  He lets his hands fall away to either side of Cas’s hips and leans down on his palms.  He brings his mouth down to the base of Cas’s cock and lays his tongue flat against the firm flesh.  His tongue runs from root to tip, which earns him an immense groan from the man below him.
“Well, not ALL of them, but some, yeah.  And it doesn’t always have to be with another person.  Plenty of dudes jerk off in the shower.  I’m not sure about women, though.  But they probably do too.”
Dean pants against his cheek, eventually bringing his arms around him and planting gentle kisses along his sensitive skin.
“Great, okay then.  Umm, just let me know when your, ya know, dick starts to get hard.”  Dean sighed to himself and pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes tightly.  He knew things were only going to get worse from here and now he couldn’t help but imagine Cas’s cock starting to harden a few feet away from him.
“Thanks for your concern, Dean,” Cas answers, dripping with sarcasm. “I’m not that desperate yet.” He punctuates his statement by taking an exaggerated chug from his water bottle.
Dean is just finishing his piss as he hears the door slam and he looks over his shoulder to see Cas still gripping his spraying cock. Dean looks on as he strokes the last spurts of his piss into the sink. He wastes no time in stripping his clothes, starting with kicking his boots off and getting his pants the rest of the way off. He manages to whip his shirt off over his head as he sees the final drips leave the tip of Cas’ dick. A dick which is clearly growing harder by the second.
Cas had gotten his stream under a little more control, it was now splashing nicely into the large open drain of the bathtub. He can feel his cock begin to harden as all of the pent up piss leaves his body. He wants so badly to start stroking his cock, but with Sam in the room it seems too inappropriate. He hopes that Dean will figure out a way to get them some alone time together so he can get release of another sort.
“I’m going to go grab us some food,” he calls out as he deposits some hand sanitizer into one of his palms. “Make sure to run plenty of water down the sink and shower. We don’t want the whole bathroom to smell like piss.” He grabs the keys off the dresser and shuts the door behind himself.
“I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t mean it. I think about it all the time,” Cas moves his arms around to Dean’s chest, washing down his pecs and leaning closer to his ear. “I watch how you touch yourself, how you give yourself pleasure, and all I want to do is be the one to make you come.” Cas whispers slowly into Dean’s ear as he moves the washcloth lower overs his taught stomach. “I’m going to clean you up so that I can taste you, taste all of you.”
“Well, there are plenty of things that humans do but never talk about.  Most have to do with either sex or bodily functions.  Both of which, as you have partly learned today, can be done in the shower.”
Dean rubs his hands up and down Cas’s thighs, letting the soft hair tickle his palms.  He runs his hands so his fingertips move up under the towel and come close together between Cas’s thighs.  He slowly applies more pressure and brings them closer and closer to Cas’s erect member.  He can hear Cas’s breath getting shallower and quicker with anticipation.  Dean moves his knees between Cas’s legs to spread them further and get himself in a better position for the next part of his plan.
Sam is coming back tomorrow, and all Cas can think about are the things he said to Dean while he was talking him off in the bathroom yesterday. It has only been a few short months, but Cas finds it so much easier to understand his own desires and tell them to Dean. And from the way Dean reacted, Cas is pretty sure that there will be no issue in getting to experience those desires first-hand.
“You are.  You’re doing so good.  Oh, Cas.  Keep going, just like that.”  Dean lets his hand fall away to help brace himself on his knees on the bed.
Sure, he was more than a little interested in it, especially with Dean.  But there was just so much to navigate.  How would he touch Dean?  How does Dean like to be touched?  Should he use his mouth?  Where should he put his… everything?
“Oh, Dean, yes!” Castiel exclaims as he lets his head fall back again, getting lost in the feel of his shaft stroking against Dean’s cock.
Dean can barely move, just holding himself up seems like an accomplishment as he lets his tired cock drain out under him. He wants to give more attention back to Cas, but he is content enough to watch his gorgeous boyfriend lose himself while he watches Dean take the longest piss of his life.
Dean turns back, now with two plates in hand.  “Oh yeah, babe,” he says with a wink and puts the plates on the table alongside their full water bottles.
“Great,” Dean quickly replies as he grabs a small dollop of shampoo and moans when he finally makes contact with his erection.
“I’ve been… looking at some things on-line,” he spoke, tentatively.  He cranes his neck to look over at Dean’s face.
Once disrobed and in the shower stall together again, Cas can feel his cock start to swell with anticipation.  He never imagined that he would try something like this with Dean, but now that they are both naked and desperate to piss and standing right in front of each other, Cas is almost too excited to let go.
Showering together has been an especially indulgent treat while they have the bunker to themselves. Cas is almost solemn about not having this time with Dean anymore for who knows how long. Dean takes his time washing Cas’ body slowly and thoroughly. Cas lets himself enjoy the attention while mentally preparing himself for the next step towards his goal. Cas knows that Dean enjoys his voice and hearing him talk. That was made abundantly clear when Cas was telling him about his fantasies.  When it is Cas’ turn to wash Dean, he takes the opportunity to tell him exactly what he wants to happen tonight.
Dean wraps his towel around his waist and heads down the hall to his room.  Cas follows closely behind and when he enters the room, he quickly sets himself down in the middle of the bed.  Cas still has towel wrapped around his hips and Dean can see that he is already slightly aroused by the anticipation.  Dean clicks off one of the side lamps so that there is only light coming from one side, casting a soft glow over Cas’s fresh and clean skin.
“It might sound weird, but that’s one of my favorite memories of us,” Dean said as he slowly but firmly stroked his aching cock.
Castiel leans back next to Dean on the blanket as they sip their beers and look out across the water. Dean has so many ideas about what he wants to do to the gorgeous man lounging next to him, but he makes no moves yet. They have time, and Dean is going to enjoy that luxury while he can.
“It’s settled then.  Hey, Cas.  We’re going to pull over here by the trees and stop our back teeth from floating.”
“No,” Cas breathes, hand moving more firmly over his own member.  “I… I want to… see what happens next.”
“Well, I have been wondering if… if that counted as a sexual act?  I mean, a sexual act between… you and me?”
“Sammy, when – when the hell did you get home?” Dean asks, his voice getting high and squeaky, making him clear his throat.
“Ohhh, Dean.”  There’s a jolt straight to Dean’s cock he wasn’t expecting.  “It feels sooo good.  I can feel it building already.  Please, tell me more.”
“Absolutely!  We better stay hydrated.  I got a feeling this weekend is going to be exhausting. Ya know… in a good way.”
Oh, God. “Right.  Now take a little of the shampoo from the bottle and put it in the palm of your right hand.  Then you want to, uh, grip your dick and slowly spread the shampoo over the whole, uh, shaft.”
Sam went on to inform Dean and Cas that one of the best ways to help your body from feeling run down was to drink plenty of water.  Sam gave them the highlights from the article he had found online.  They guys could all easily admit that they were definitely not staying hydrated.  Sam said he would stock them up with big bottles of water for the ride home tomorrow and see if they felt any better.
“Is it because you like watching me piss so much, or do you like to hear me talk about what turns me on?” Cas asks, his stream just starting to weaken a little.
“Yes, that would be very helpful,” Cas was sounding down right giddy about the proposed activities and Dean still couldn’t decide whether to run right out of the bathroom, or join in.  Running was a perfectly sane option.  Many other people would run when faced with talking their friend through a jerk off session while standing naked in a shower stall next to them. But Dean was not like other people.  His whole life was not like other people’s.  And poor Cas was just trying to figure out this whole human thing.  Because, really, the guy had pulled Dean out of Hell and put him back together.  The least Dean could do was explain how to get himself off.
Dean moves back up to suck the tip of Cas’s cock while his hand is beginning to pick up speed.  He watches as the muscles in Cas’s stomach twitch with each stroke and he listens as his panting turns into sighs and then groans as the pressure builds up within him.
Cas had been worried that his fascination with Dean urinating was a strange and undesirable reaction.  But hearing Dean say that there is a kink that involves urine is the first sign that he might just be normal, or at least not a complete creep.
“I really appreciate you helping me with this.  I know it makes you uncomfortable, even though you say you aren’t.”
“Okay, umm.  It sounds like you aren’t using enough, uh, lubricant.  We can get you some for your room next time we are at the store.”
Dean pulls up in front of the lobby to let Sam jump out. He swings the impala around to a spot and throws it into park. He can hear Cas let out a small whimper in the back seat as they step out and walk back to the trunk.
“Umm, I guess someone could just like watching someone else pee.  Or two people could pee on each other.  Or sometimes people drink it.  People can try to hold it for a long time before letting it go, sometimes in their clothes.  There is a lot of different ways it can get involved, probably.”
“Dude!  Gonna need to put a bell on you, seriously,” Dean shakes his head and after giving Cas a once over, turns back to the counter.  “Here, I made us a snack.  We’re going to need the fuel.”
“Oh god, Cas! Seriously? That is so fucking hot,” Dean moans out as he lets his eyes slip closed for a moment. His body is so confused, he can feel the piss just waiting to be released, but he is so turned on, he doesn’t know if he will be able to let go until he comes first.
“Mmmhmm, watching you take the bottle after me and pissing into it right in front of me was the sexiest thing I had ever seen. I had to resist reaching out to you the whole time. I wanted to touch you so much. I’m so glad I finally get to.”
Dean was not prepared for this.  Sure, he had been thinking about Cas none stop for the last two weeks.  Sure, pretty much all of his sexual fantasies now starred a beautiful and dorky ex-angle.  Sure, Dean has known that he was bisexual since middle school.  But Dean was definitely not expecting for Cas, sweet, powerful, vulnerable, wonderful Cas to find him sexually attractive.  Had Dean saved someone particularly important lately?  Was he getting some kind of reward from the Universe?  Because this kind of good shit did not happen to Dean.  He would figure out which powerful being to thank later.  For now, Dean just knew that he couldn’t stand to see Cas feel so anxious.  And he definitely couldn’t let him think for a second that the feelings he was trying to express to Dean were not mutual.  There was only one thing  Dean wanted to do at that moment.
Cas suddenly feels a sharp ache and has to thrust his hand down to his pants to pinch the tip of his dick through the material.  He closes his eyes tightly and breaths steadily through his nose until he is certain that he is no longer in danger of wetting himself.  He opens his eyes to witness one of the best things he’s seen as a human so far.  Dean Winchester is squirming in his seat, hand in his crotch palming himself against his own straining bladder.
Cas’s eyes close tight as his orgasm rips though him.  He can feel each jet of cum push though Dean’s strong hold on his cock and then fall over his swollen manhood.  Dean continues for a few more seconds before he lets out his own cry, and Cas forces his eyes open to watch him erupt over his hand and Cas’s spent and sensitive dick.  Cas can feel the tremors and it pushes a few more moans out of his mouth, his own warm breath mixes with Dean’s as they pant against each other’s lips.
Dean drives back to the motel where Sam is probably still researching on his laptop back in the room they are all sharing.  Castiel feels a little disappointment sink in his stomach as he realizes he will have to wait to play with Dean until they are probably back at the bunker.  When Dean parks and Cas gets out and starts heading to their room, Dean grabs his hand and leads him around to the back of the motel and off into the dark woods that go on for about 50 yards before the highway passes through.  They end up about 20 yards into the woods, making it very difficult to see the back of the motel.  Dean pulls Cas close to him and their sides line up from shoulder to hip, giving off heat and making Cas ache for even more contact.  Cas is about to pull Dean to himself, but then he hesitates.
“I want to see you when you climax,” Cas responds, trying to keep his eyes open as his pleasure spikes.
“Just stroke it like you would your own, I’ll help you,” Dean encourages as Cas makes a few tentative movements over his hard, velvet cock.
“Well, there are three of us and there will be three drains in that bathroom. We got toilet, sink, and shower,” Dean holds up his fingers as he counts them off. “We could all just go in together and each take one to get some instant relief.” Dean states simply, feeling his bladder full to bursting.
Now Cas is fairly sure this is some kind of game or challenge.  And with a little deductive reasoning, he feels he is more than willing to participate.
“This is going to be so good, baby. Just take your time. I trust you,” Dean whispers as he leans their foreheads together. Cas takes a deep breath and nods before they separate as Dean lies back down.
“Yeah, that’s one of the best parts of sex.  Watching your partner feel good and knowing that you are doing it to them.”
They drive along in silence for a moment, getting ever closer to the motel and the loss of privacy.  Castiel decides that he can’t leave his last questions unanswered and musters up the courage.
Dean moves over to the other side of his lover’s chest and lavishes his left nipple with equal fervor, making Cas squirm against the memory foam.  Once Dean is satisfied with the attention he has paid to this part of Cas’s anatomy, he moves back to the center of his chest and kisses down this sternum until he reaches his adorable navel.  Dean kisses along Cas’s stomach and when he reaches those sinful hipbones, Cas’s legs tremble as he licks over them.  Dean can feel Cas’s arousal against his shoulder through the towel as he attends to his hips.  Dean wants to hold off as long as possible before he finally gives it the attention it deserves.  However, it is getting harder and harder to wait (pun very much intended).  It probably isn’t helping that Dean has completely ignored his own growing needs as he has slowly worked his way over Cas’s body.  But his plan had always been to just focus on Cas, and he is going to stick to that plan dammit.
Dean sees the tell-tale sign just another block down the street and sighs with relief. “Okay, Sammy. You run in and get us a room, and I’ll park and Cas and I can grab the bags.”
The two men take their time catching their breath before Dean sighs and leans over to plant a firm and satisfied kiss on Cas’ lips.
“Well, not always.  I mean, orgasms can be different.  Some not as powerful.  It helps when there is extra input.”
“I’m not sure.  I don’t know how long it is supposed to take, or… how I’m supposed to do it.  It seems like I am just… fumbling through until I either give up or I just happen to ejaculate.  And is it supposed to feel sore afterwards?”
Stakeouts can have their ups and downs.  If you are stuck with one person in the car for hours with nothing to do but keep watch, it can get very boring very quickly.  If you have the right partner, though, it can be tolerable, even fun.  Dean had experienced many a stakeout with his brother over the years.  They could always chat about lots of stuff, but their disagreements on food and Sam’s toxic flatulence made for a more stressful experience.  Dean had never been on a stakeout with Castiel, but it was proving to be one of the most interesting; and not because of their target.
Cas had gotten most of his clothes off, just his t-shirt was left on and rucked up under his arms, exposing his tight stomach and lower back. He was on his knees, protected from the cold, hard tiles by a folded towel hastily thrown on the floor, and he was hunching over the bowl. One hand was in front of him on the floor, holding him up, while the other was grasping his hard cock as it pulsed shot after shot of gushing piss. Cas was panting with his eyes closed and neck strained as he tossed his head back. His bladder seemed to be having spasms from the effort of holding back so much piss; the stream would shoot violently for a few seconds and then stop a moment before shooting out again. Dean’s dick was hard almost instantly as he stared at the scene, and when his brain finally came back on line, he grabbed another towel from the shelf and removed his pants and boxers before setting himself up on the floor across from Cas.
There was a boy in the kitchen!  One that he had never seen before in his life, going through their cabinets!
Gabriel let go of Dean without warning and Dean fell straight on the ground and groaned as Gabe bellowed to the other two ahead of them, "HEY GUYS!  DEAN JUST INVITED US OVER TO HIS PLACE TOMORROW MORNING FOR CHURCH AND BREAKFAST WITH HIS FAMILY!"
Finally, after about 30 seconds of watching and trying not to drool, Dean felt a sharp kick to his shin from the other side of the table in front of him.  Dean jerked back in surprise, both from the pain of the kick, and the sudden shove back into reality.  He looked up to see Gabriel looking at him with his eyebrows raised and mouthing,
Blondie answered for him by turning around to face Dean again, "We do but who cares?  Hangover's always make things more interesting."
"Dean, would you stop slurping your spaghetti?", Jo complained.  "You're literally spraying tomato sauce on me when you do that."
Charlie had been in the middle of a sip from her coffee when he finally uttered those words, and the sip quickly turned into a surprised spit.  Once Charlie had wiped up her splatters from the counter she looked at Dean with a grin dancing in her eyes, "WHAT?"  She grabbed his arm and started to yank at his sleeve.  "You dog, why didn't you tell me sooner?!  What happened?  How did it go?!  Was it just you two, or was it everyone?  WHY DIDN'T YOU INVITE ME?!"
It was another few hours before anyone would be home, so Dean took this opportunity for alone time by face planting on his bed.  He buried his nose deep in his pillow case, reacquainting himself with the feel and smell of his home, letting all of the exhaustion and stress from the semester dissipate from being wrapped in the comfort of his own space after so long.  He was a few moments from letting himself slip into a nap when he heard his phone vibrate on his bedside table.  He debated just ignoring it, but just in case it was something important he decided to reach his hand up and see what it was.
Dean approached his door with apprehension, not sure whether or not he was hoping that Castiel was still there, or if he was hoping that he wasn't.  He decided to finally bite the bullet after about 5 minutes just standing there and threw the door open and poked his head in, like a little kid who was seeing if his stuffed animals moved while he wasn't there.  Castiel was gone, but there was a note on Dean's desk, written in incredibly beautiful script writing.
Dean stabbed his food with frustration, "No, I'm the one who attempted a kiss last time, and he's the one that pulled away.  The ball's in his court now.  I think he's just choosing to stay on the bench."
Ellen reached over and swatted him, "Hey! Don't laugh too hard you're gonna get started on it too mister."
Castiel looked back up at his mom and gave a closed lipped smile.  She walked over to him and ruffled his hair a little bit before stating that she should, "probably go in with 'im" and leaving for the bedroom too.
"I appreciate your enthusiasm Mr. Winchester, but please get back in your seat so you don't hurt yourself."
Dean was cut off by his realization that Castiel had fallen asleep some time ago.  His head was pressed against Dean's side and his hair was all mushed to his forehead.  Dean just smiled and looked at Cas with adoration while he breathed against Dean's ribs.  Dean was so into the movie that he hadn't even felt Cas lay against him.  Quietly, as not to disturb him, Dean leaned back and pushed Cas slightly forward so that Cas's head moved around to lean against his arm instead of his ribs so Dean could press himself against the back of the couch and not squish Cas.  Cas squirmed a little bit at the movement but settled against his new spot against Dean's body after rubbing his face quickly and sighing against Dean's sleeve.  Dean slung his arm around Cas and allowed himself to relax into the position as Cas slid a little bit so his head was now on Dean's chest.  Dean looked at his watch and saw that it was 3 am.  Gabe and Baz would be back soon.
The two of them spent the ride jamming out to music and Dean felt more contented than he ever had before.  He watched Cas as he got completely lost in the music and looked out the window as he sang at the top of his lungs, and in that moment, he wished his Mom was here to see this.
Suddenly, as if the big man himself was watching down on this shit show of a conversation, the bus's speakers started to rumble with incredibly loud Christian rock songs.  The entire bus groaned in complaint before Chuck stood at the front of the bus, looking pissed.
Before Cas even adjusted to the new spot, feeling his hair getting pulled into Dean’s fists, Dean moved down from Castiel’s lips down to his chin, then his jaw, and down to his neck.  Cas gasped as he felt Dean’s hot slick tongue peak out to lave at his skin.
“Of course, I did, Cas.”  It came out almost like a whisper.  “Did it come out the way that I had planned? No.”  Dean started to fidget with his fingers and kick around a stone by his feet.
Balthazar just sighed for what seemed like 2 minutes straight and then looked up at the ceiling, "Being a junior in college can eat its own ass, that's how it's going.  I can't wait for us all to drink our own weight tonight."
"Alright, now that we have everybody, I'm going to pass out the itinerary for today.", Chuck started.  Dean watched as he passed a pile of packets to one of the guys right in from of him and followed the pile with his eyes as it got passed around to everybody.  "We're all gonna hop on this bus here.  It'll take about 2 hours to get to the campground.  When we get there, you guys are gonna go right for your cabins and drop of your stuff.  After that we will be meeting under the pavilion for team building exercises and bonding.  We won't be doing anything too crazy today.  I don't want to overwhelm all of you."
Dean cleared his throat, not sure if he Cas wanted to know everything, and decided to just provide a little bit of insight to see if he seemed interested enough for Dean to continue to the rest of it.  "She just seemed to get all of us without even knowing us a full year.  Her and Sam started dating about 5 months before my parents died and she was there for us from beginning to end.  All of us."
Dean looked at her and her warm smile and pulled her into a side hug and kissed the top of her head and walked out to the car, liking arms with her like Cas and Ellen.  He leaned in and whispered in her ear before they disconnected to get in their own spots in the car, "Unfortunately, we're just friends."
Castiel’s chest started to warm up and a small smile spread across his face.  Dean was so beautiful no matter what.  He was beautiful when he was flustered, he was beautiful when he was confident.  He was beautiful when he was drunk, he was beautiful when he was focused.  He was beautiful when he was emotional and he was beautiful when he laughed.  He was just breath takingly,
Dean rolled his eyes at himself, knowing full well what answer he should give.  He should say no.  He should say he needs to go home and study.  But who was he kidding, of course he was going to go watch movies with Cas.  "Okay, Cas."
"Well..." Gabe started, "We more called him out on his obvious drooling over you and just didn't deny it.  Then we had a few drunken conversations about it when I told him to get a fucking move on, but he still hasn't and I can't figure out why."
Cas finally returned to his spot on the couch across from Dean and he took a deep breath.  "There isn't much to tell in all honesty," Cas began, "my mother's strict and conservative, and my father is gone."
"You have no idea.  How do you manage to still look great this close to finals?"  Dean froze.  That had just slipped out of him.  He hadn't even thought about it when he said it.
Balthazar got up and kissed Castiel on the cheek before he was quickly shoved off.  He looked at Dean and corrected, "You can call me Baz, kitten."
Please comment and let me know, any interest in a Cas POV chapter?  I know this is third person, but it's mainly third person in what Dean sees and feels, not so much Cas.  I realized that it might be interesting to see things from his point of view at this point in the story, but let me know what you think in the comments if you want!  If you have an opinion on it, try and let me know soon because I would do it on the next one.
Cas smiled at her and then went back to folding.  After a few seconds, Bela spoke up.  "Hey, we're actually going to a house party that my friend is throwing after this.  You guys should come."
Dean leaned over to Jo and slurped his spaghetti again, this time even closer to her and she slapped his shoulder in protest, "You're disgusting!"
Cas cleared his throat and rushed out of the room after muttering, "I'm just gonna go brush my teeth-"
Charlie and Dean walked to their chemistry class and managed to slip it right at 8 o'clock.  They had stayed at the coffee shop a little bit longer than usual talking about what had happened with Cas the night before.  Charlie had assured Dean that him crying a little bit at the mention of his dead parents was not the end of the world, in fact is was completely normal.  Although, she understood why he wished he hadn't.  She told him that Cas probably didn't even remember it, considering how drunk he ended up being.  Dean hoped she was right.
Dean stood back and let go of Cas, and Cas dropped his arm from Dean's shoulder and stumbled a little.  "She's pretty", Dean stated, forcing a smile, "How long have you too been together?"  Cas looked at Dean and cocked his head to the side in confusion before laughing so hard that his whole body reacted.  Dean panicked internally.  Was his jealousy that transparent?
Finally, Dean lifted his head and looked up into the risen stand for the person handling the music.  This was a elevated spot in the floor that was surrounded by speakers in the living room across from where Dean and the rest of the group were standing.  There was always someone in charge of the music, almost always a person who lived there, and some times people would go up and give requests. Behind the lights and speakers, there was Gabriel, making direct eye contact with Dean as he slid the kid in charge of the music a twenty and grinned wickedly.  Gabriel winked and Dean shook his head.
Castiel felt his glare soften.  He knew that.  He could tell that his nerves were beginning to fan his temper, as they often did.  He took a deep breath before throwing one last pair of jeans into his duffle and pulling his friend in for a hug.
Dean smiled at Cas and wiped his face before leaning up on his elbows and grabbing the hand that Cas had left on Dean's.  "You are incredibly drunk, man."  Dean let himself chuckle, "Why don't we get you home?"  Dean stood up and leaned his arm down to lift Cas up.
Ellen looked down at her plate.  She didn't move for a second.  Dean knew she was trying to keep it together.  Finally, after what seemed like hours of silence, she gave up, and looked at him with love and tears streaming down her face and nodded intensely.  Bobby draped an arm around her and kissed her shoulder, rubbing her arm reassuringly.
Dean and Cas looked at each other and shrugged.  Cas answered, "It's going good so far, I suppose.  We still have a lot to go but, we've done two different community service days and a month of courses.  We only have a few months left, two more community service days, and the retreat."
Cas sunk a little in his spot so that his eyes were the only part of his face outside of his jacket, "Am I that obvious?"
Dean's face melted into an expression of compassion and he slung his arm around Cas's shoulders in an attempt to block him from the wind as he brought him inside.
”, Castiel cut off as Dean pressed his thumb against Cas’s slit and slathered his precum down his pulsing dick.
Dean took a deep breath and smiled before pulling Cas into him and whispering back, "Welcome to God Camp", and kissing him passionately.
Dean followed her as he stumbled trying to put on his dress shoes at the same time, "HEY!  Can you use your own stuff for once?"
Jo clasped her hand on her mouth in surprise and the rest of the table looked at Dean with worried eyes.  Bobby spoke.  "Make sure that boy knows he can stay here as long as he wants."
Dean leaned in and kissed him a few more times.  His breath tasted like peppermint and chocolate and Dean just wanted to pull Cas in tight and hold him.  "I'm sorry I just ran in here.  I hope you don't think I was mad at you.  I was just so tired of watching that male model flirt with you shamelessly."  Castiel looked up at him with sympathetic eyes, "It was babyish and stupid, and I'm sorry."
"Wow", he whispered.  He continued to look at Dean with astonishment, "Have you ever felt that sure about anything?"
"Well yes, but Bobby and Ellen were heart broken too.  They had all been friends and college, you see, and they were very dear friends." Dean explained.  "And on top of it, they then had to take me and Sam in, who were in pretty rough shape."
Benny just looked between Dean in the panties, horror creeping across his face as he came the embarrassing realization of what was happening.  "Hey, I'm sorry, cher, I totally didn't realize that they had flown over there.  I was so focused on keeping it quiet since you were going to be leaving so early today-"
"Hey, Dean?" Sam started, "When are you going to be done for the year?  Like do you think you'll be home on May 15th?"
Castiel sighed and figured he should probably try to get along with the guy, seeing as he was pretty sure he might be taking his sister out in the foreseeable future.  After he was done eating, he poured his father a cup of coffee, black of course, and made his way out to the barn.
"Shh," Cas pressed a kiss against the shaking skin of Dean's shoulder, "breathe. It's alright. You're alright."
Dean looked ready to say no, then bit his lip before speaking. Cas could practically see the thoughts flitting across his face: confusion, doubt, realisation. He swallowed, blinking back tears.
"Do you want me to take my vengeance for what you did to me? Do you want to suffer for your crimes? Is that why you are here?"
“We thought you knew. You really thought I’d have gone to that carnival if it hadn’t been a date? There were clowns there!”
This got a genuine laugh from the other man. Dean grinned triumphantly, he was certain that such a moment was rare.
Dammit, but there was no other choice. This was happening, it was happening now and it was happening here and Cas had to know.
Dean broke himself out of the daze he’d been caught in and tried to pull Cas away, to no avail, the other boy was a hell of a lot stronger than he looked.
Dean’s muddled mind tripped on the words, taking what could have been seconds, could have been minutes, to register what they meant. The sound was coming from him. He was screaming. He clamped his mouth shut, letting out a whimper between clenched teeth as Alastair drove the burning metal a bit deeper into his chest.
Dean's head shot up, attention now caught by the phone sitting on the one blood free table in the room. Sam had called Bobby, and not him?
He rolled his hips to make his point absolutely clear, Dean moaned and tried to pull him closer, but Cas didn't allow him to. He kept a careful distance between them now. Close enough that he could feel the heat from his body without getting any pressure where he needed it most. He continued to practically growl in his ear.
He did as he was told. Not caring if Sam saw him like this. Not bothering to move his head. Screwing his eyes shut as the truth of it all crashed down on him.
“Bit late now don’t you think?” His anger was slowly dissipating, but his voice was no calmer, the shame of his drunken mistake clouding everything.
“Damn right I did Deana. You and big bro over there been making googly eyes at each other since the dawn of existence.”
“You make a good point,” he rolled to the edge of the bed, groaning as he rose to a sitting position, “do you have any clothes I can borrow? Mine are kinda fucked.”
Dean did as he was told, taking several unsteady breaths before his heart stopped feeling like it was beating in his throat.
“Hey, Cas, so I’ve been thinking. We’re probably gonna wind up killin’ each other anyway with the way things been goin’, how’s about we just agree to keep fucking until we get told different?”
"No, Dean, hold your horses, I'm fine," he sighed that I'm-holding-something-back sigh that he knew so well. Dean clenched his teeth.
Dean winked at him and Cas realised he'd been staring. He shook his head, as if that would rid him of his sinful thoughts, and gratefully took the bottle when it was returned to him.
Cas rubbed the back of his neck, in a gesture Dean knew he’d picked up from him, the thought caused a warmth in his chest that he really, really wasn’t okay with.
"I was adopted into a very large family. My brother, Gabriel, is the closest in age and perhaps feels the most like a true sibling, but none of us are related in the literal sense."
Dean rushed to obey. Cas felt himself getting hard against his will at the pure subservience that Dean seemed so eager to give in to. It seemed like an eternity before Dean finally got the last shirt off (why he insisted on covering that body with such an unnecessarily large amount of clothing Cas would never know) all though in reality it had to have been under a minute, a minute of terrified suspense, Cas’ heart hammering painfully, the adrenaline feeling similar to the moments before an anticipated drop from a great height. Then his stomach plummeted as all of his fears were realised. The tattoo was dark and real and all too absolute. He was a hunter.
Of course there was no chance of redemption for someone like him. Of course it had only been an extra morning. He couldn’t say he was surprised.
Cas had never backed down from a challenge in his life. He shoved two fingers between Dean's lips, grinning cattishly when Dean choked, immensely thankful for the length of his fingers. He stared him down while he regained control of his gag reflex, adjusting to the unexpected intrusion, before pushing slightly deeper. With his other hand he undid his belt, keeping a firm grip on Dean's jaw so he couldn't pull away, watching Deans eyes dilate while he pulled the leather from the loops in which it rested.
Dean had no idea how he still had the brain cells left to think of cleanup as Cas proceeded to wipe them both down with a t-shirt.
He hung up before the heartache could force him to do any differently. It had been the right decision, he knew that, and yet it still felt like it was breaking him apart.
He started searching through the boxes, Cas doing the same beside him. Icy hands clamped down on his shoulders, and threw Dean into the heap. He didn’t land particularly gracefully, but he was ninety percent sure he was unharmed. Before he could check for injuries his attention was caught by a dark wooden box lying beneath him. He grabbed it and slid back down to the floor.
“It’s like nothing else Cas, it’s better than ecstasy, or sex, like I steal their energy or something. I don’t know, maybe I’m just fucked in the head, got my wires crossed a ways back. Killin’ shouldn’t be like that, should it?”
Jack had understood instantly, when he absorbed Chuck’s power, the nature of a god. One didn’t have to rule everything, or even control anything. A god was just a writer. Jack didn’t have to tell every story, most of the pieces would fall into place without interference, he just had to choose one. It wasn’t hard. He knew what mattered to this world. Their family, all of them, all those who loved the Winchesters, and the brothers themselves. If he was a god, he decided, he would make it his life’s purpose to heal the Winchesters, to give his family what they had fought so hard to give him. He could do that now. He just had to be patient.
Dean shook his head, a fury burning behind his eyes as he snarled, “I don’t need your mercy. I’m not a fucking coward.”
Dean slowly breathed out, watching tendrils of smoke dance and disperse. He looked up at the overcast sky, wondered if that was what the clouds looked like up close, not that he ever intended to get high enough to find out, not in that sense at least.
He kicked the nearest body, picked up his bone saw, and began dividing the corpses into neat little segments.
“Step out of your trousers and turn around.” Cas commanded, releasing Dean’s cock and walking over to the bedside table.
He didn’t expect Castiel to get the reference, it was a personal indulgence, one that made him smile like the Cheshire Cat, before he realised his teeth might be visible in the gloom.
He passed the bottle back, knowing that was the polite thing to do, if not the responsible one. Dean was a grown man and Castiel would not baby him, not tonight. He quickly decided it had been the correct choice to make, when he watched the way Dean's lips curled around the bottle, flicking out his tongue to pull the liquor into his mouth a millisecond faster, his neck muscles tightening and then releasing as he swallowed. It was practically pornographic, which was not helped by Cas' memory of those same lips stretching around his cock.
Dean managed to make it all the way to his bedroom. He managed to lock the door. He started crying the second he was alone. Tears like he hadn’t cried since that first night.
"No, I do not think that I shall. As of yet I am under no such orders, and I certainly don't take commands from you. You, on the other hand, would do best to obey me."
Soft lips were pressed to his shoulder blades, his neck, the side of his face. Dean forced himself to calm down, stop thinking of anything that had gone before, those memories didn’t belong here.
Dean hurried to comply, almost bouncing back up with the weight of his landing. Cas advanced slowly. For all his previous eagerness, the bastard seemed determined to tease. Dean watched with rapt attention as he pulled off the lopsided tie, the trench coat abandoned somewhere in the hallway, and folded each item of clothing before carefully placing them on a chest of drawers. It was too slow, far too slow.
He hadn’t been looking where he was going, that was the mistake he had made. How the hell had he ended up somewhere so isolated? The buildings around him were abandoned, the streets silent, waiting. It was far too easy.
Dean shook his head, not even understanding why the question was being asked. Why on earth would he attack Cas when he was the only thing right in this world?
Dean woke up to a pounding head and an empty bed. He slowly separated his face from the pillow it seemed to have fused with overnight and looked around the room. There was no sign that Cas had been there. He sighed, wondering if he’d imagined the whole thing, fuck knows he’d been drunk enough.
Cas leaned forward and slowly licked a trail up a stubbled cheek, grinning when Dean trembled beneath him. He bit an ear lobe and whispered.
"Well what are you waiting for? Remember what I did to you, how I tied you up and fucked you, how I took what wasn't mine. Take it back. Fucking take it back."
Dean woke up with more than a little surprise. He had been almost entirely certain he would die in his sleep. He certainly hadn’t expected to wake up alone.
His body started to contract with deep sobs and he lowered himself further, hid as much of his face as possible as the tears flowed down his cheeks. Castiel trepidatiously sat down beside him, putting an arm around his shaking back, and slowly pulling him into the warmth of the angel’s embrace. Cas made soft comforting noises as Dean cried, combing a hand through his hair, but not trying to force words until the hunter was ready. Dean kept trying to speak, to explain, to somehow laugh it off, hide the truth behind another lie, but he couldn’t. When the tears started to slow and Dean finally managed to dry his face on a sleeve, and raise his eyes to meet the look the angel was giving him, he knew the truth was the only option.
He made his way to the bathroom, splashing his face with water then cupping his hands below the tap and taking several long gulps. It did nothing for the hangover, but at least his tongue had stopped sticking to the roof of his mouth. What the fuck was that taste anyway? He hadn’t gone out for cigarettes, he didn’t think so at least, so why did he feel like he’d smoked a whole pack? Freaking shitty whiskey. He probably ought to clean his teeth but he was ninety percent sure that if he did he would hurl. He drank a bit more water for good measure, glared at his reflection as if he could communicate with his past self and stop him drinking so freaking much, and stumbled back towards the bed. Lying back down felt like a herculean effort, but no chance in hell he was facing the day without at least another hour spent in bed, even if the chances of him sleeping were minuscule. He glared at the clock for a moment, as if that would ensure that no one called him out of hibernation until he was good and ready, then noticed something.
Sam’s eyes lit up, that ‘hah got you’ expression on his face that clearly meant Dean had just stumbled into a carefully placed trap, in other words; he was doomed.
The alcohol worked its magic as it always did and in that blissful haze he leaned forward, invading the angel’s personal space far more than Castiel had ever done, their lips meeting, soft and beautiful. So long overdue. Cas froze for a moment, the angelic system far less prone to alcohol than the human one, before melting into the kiss. It was electric with passion, the feeling so strong that Dean thought he might cry. He pulled away quickly when he saw Sam returning from the bathroom, taking an unnatural interest in the contents of his glass, and ignoring the questions he could see forming on Castiel’s lips.
Castiel wasn’t surprised when, upon entering the hotel suite he was now staying in, he found Uriel waiting for him. He was merely exhausted. Uriel’s face contorted in disgust when he saw him.
“We would have to be in a relationship for this to qualify as a breakup. As it is we are just two people who had some great sex and a few ill advised conversations, then parted ways.”
Dean walked past Castiel and sat down heavily on the edge of his bed, grabbing the bottle of whiskey he kept beside it and swallowing a large gulp of the fiery liquid, before lowering his head into his hands. He could feel the angel move towards him, he tried to keep himself together as a strong hand settled on his shoulder.
Cas only loosened his grip slightly, but it was enough. Dean broke free of the garrotte and quickly backed away, not lowering the gun an inch, not breaking focus even as he reached for his clothes and put them on.
Perhaps it was Dean's expression that did it, perhaps it was just her words, but Sam lunged forwards, knife held firm in his hands. She didn't look so smug while the life was bleeding out of her, Dean noted with a tinge of satisfaction. Sam though, his expression was shattered, a broken mirror that would condemn Dean to more years of bad luck than he could bear. Ruby was just spluttering, choking on blood while Sam held her, tears running down his face, seemingly frozen. Dean sprang into action, this he could help with, if nothing else. He gently pried Sam's hand from the knife, taking it in his own and twisting it.
“Nah,” Dean forced a grin, but it wavered far too quickly to have the desired effect, “fair’s fair, you didn’t kill me last night. Sorry to love ya and leave ya, but I’ve gotta bounce. I just don’t think this relationship or whatever the fuck we’ve had is gonna work out. So, uh, adios. Let’s never see each other again.”
“Wrote something on a piece of paper, left it at the bar, then strode toward the exit like a man on a mission.”
If Dean thought he had been a writhing mess before he had clearly not understood the true meaning of the phrase. Once he started fucking him he didn't let up for a second, somehow punching into him harder with every thrust. Dean was seeing stars even before he found his prostate, afterwards everything just sort of whited out. He was reduced to nothing but sensation, as pure as it was obscene. He was distantly aware that he was babbling nonsense, begging for it harder even though it couldn't get any harder, then just making animalistic noises of pleasure. Some lingering rational part of his brain wondered if it was possible for the inside of his ass to bruise, before it was swept away on the tide of an orgasm so intense that he was surprised he didn't pass out.
