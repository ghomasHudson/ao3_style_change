Cas tilts his head in fascination as they kiss. Dean gets up from his bed and pushes past a guffawing Sam.
"Yeah, I did."
Cas nods his tilted head and
"He- he's kidding." Dean stops Cas before he can hand back the beer. "Thanks."
"I'm onto you."
“Don’t give me space, Cas. I don’t want it.” He manages to say though his voice sounds foreign and weird to his own ears, like it’s formed by someone else. There’s that smile on Cas’ lips again and he feels a desperation to say something,
"I'm just asking, that's all. Or maybe I'm telling you that it's.." Oh god, Sam's about to tell him it's OK to like men, isn't he?
"Something Claire suggested I research."
Because.. he hasn’t been imagining it, right? He can’t excuse it anymore. Not now that fact is out in the open. And maybe there
Jack is nodding along with his typical studious frown as Cas talks but Dean is barely paying attention, the words rolling over him.
"Dean's right, Jack. You shouldn't ask people in case they're uncomfortable talking about it. It's not polite."
Although, the more he thinks about it, the more he realises a lot of the times he could be filling with dates, he's with Cas. Going for drinks. Watching old movies. Those are pretty date-y activities.
There's a sudden sick feeling in the pit of his stomach even if he'd seen it coming. He picks up his beer bottle to delay an answer but Cas' voice cuts through the thrumming in his head.
"Maybe you should, one day. Initiate them, I mean. I’d be cool with it if you did."
at him. “I don’t know, man. Is it weird we’ve never talked about that?”
"Maybe. Yeah, could be."
"I've often felt that a lot of human conflict wouldn't come to pass if people simply said plainly what they were thinking."
"Probably just the one night."
"Your gun."
"That doesn't mean you have to lie."
He thinks it sounded convincing. A little fast to respond, maybe, and Sam is giving him a side-eye. But no obvious jealousy or barely-contained lust.
Too much like the thing he's trying desperately not to think about.
There’s stubble scratching his face and he tries fleetingly to explain away the flushing burn on his skin as a by-product of it, but then there’s a hand riding up his shirt onto on the bare skin at the small of his back and it’s on
"What do you think, Dean?"
Cas to ask him. Maybe if he’s forced to confront it the words might come out a little easier.
"He was asking if I was interested in sex."
"How is that so different to Dr Sexy?"
"I'll watch Dean's movie with him tonight and then I can compare the two."
Where the hell did Cas learn to kiss like this? His head is spinning before he can ponder the question and fingers on his back are steady and grounding even as Cas’ tongue and lips and breath have him practically able to feel the earth spinning beneath him.
"Dude, I don't care how you dress it up I'm not watching one of your Bravo shows.”
"Dr Sexy is a guilty pleasure, it's supposed to be like that."
“I’m sorry, Cas. I know I’m not-”
"I don't understand why he doesn't ask Jake why he's upset." Dean can hear the frown in Jack's voice as he muses out loud.
"So are you into guys? Because it's OK if you are, you know."
"What?"
"No, it's alright. We can't all be cute." He gives him a smile of reassurance, worried about appearing standoff-ish, before ducking away at the speed of light.
Dean must fall asleep in the end, because next thing he knows his eyelids are opening heavily and the arm he’d had tucked under his head is heavy.
This motel room, incredibly, didn’t have functioning air-con but
Cas trails off and thank
"Jake said he's gay, I win."
There’s something growing on green leaves around him and he stretches to pull a branch towards him. It’s blackberries, he thinks, then wonders how ashamed Sam would be if he knew he wasn’t sure.
Through the trees is a clearing, and in the distance a meadow runs down a small hill. He pauses in front of it, looking down, and thinks this is the spot.
"Because you're
He doesn't look at anyone else like that - anyone would notice that. But the thought of confronting that – of actually stopping to think about what it means, is terrifying.
"You seem to watch it fairly often. More than I do, actually."
Dean thinks.
“Lucky I bought reinforcements.”
“Hey.” The man’s voice is slow and a little awkward and he accentuates the word with a look back at his friends at their table. “I’m sorry, my friends were bugging me to come over.”
Considering how long Cas has been around, Dean isn’t sure what that says about him. “Not sure if that’s a compliment or not.”
"Or both. Yeah."
"Oh yeah? How was it, Cas?"
"I was genuinely thinking about using it to scout potential witnesses. I was curious as to your expertise. I know you aren't a prude so I wondered if you'd got any knowledge of using them."
"Did you tell Sam? You owe him money."
but now he's looking at him like he's trying to gauge his reaction and Dean doesn't know what to do with his hands.
"What's that supposed to mean?" He feels embarrassed by Cas' frown as Sam speaks.
"Right. The one where the wolf was hiding."
"Dean. DEAN."
“What? No, you don’t-”
“Yes. I don’t have much by way of reference but I think that’s important to me. I’d like to know them down to their soul.”
“I should get going before someone reports Baby.” He says it to himself rather than to the invisible Cas-entity, but doesn’t make any efforts to stand up again. “Maybe I’ll come back another time.”
In a heartbeat, Dean sets off towards him.
“She came very often to visit. After a while, I realized why- she loved lighting the candles. We had dozens inside. It saved me quite a lot of time. To reward her good work, I started giving her a few cents every time she came by. Of course I felt responsible for what happened. I still do.” Dean’s heart drops at the crack in his voice. “I would have felt responsible even if I hadn’t been encouraging her to visit. The church... the church was my home, but I would have rebuilt it. My parish would have helped me rebuild it. She was the one I wanted to do right by.”
Cas’s frown deepens. The subject had been safely buried since first brought up, after it had led their talk to take a sour turn. Dean had happily let it rest and focused on what mattered the most instead. Guiding their groups to safety. Keeping them alive. He hadn’t forgotten, just shoved it at the back of his mind until now.
He’s arched forward, smoothing his palm from the spot behind her ears down her nape until his hand meets the saddle. His long beige coat, recovered by the creek where he’d left the rest of his clothes in a neat pile, hangs down loosely on both sides of the horse. Dean bites down on his lip. He’s not going to pretend it doesn’t do something to him.
“Been trapped with Bobby all night.” He rolls his eyes as hard as can. “Only managed to escape now after he threatened to tell us all about Jody again.”
Out of nowhere, he feels a force grip him tightly and haul his ass up.
“I can hear you, you know,” said a deadpan voice off to Dean’s side.
“I don’t get it- what about those bastards who went after your church?”
gotta know if you feel like you’re just getting dragged along for the ride or if you actually want this.”
Cas isn’t doing anything special, not really. That’s the thing. He just belongs. And Dean likes that, as simple as it sounds. He goes along with the plan, even when the plan is to partner up with Dean on a fishing adventure when he has no idea how to tie a hook to a line himself.
Sam turned towards Dean, his eyes crinkled in amusement. “When’d you become such a fashinonista? First, the swimsuit. And now, this.”
Cas nods solemnly. “I’m ready.”
“To watch out for you.”
“And how many bottles are you getting for
Dean barks out a laugh as he pushes himself up. He’s starting to get a sense of Cas’s offbeat humour.
Dean shook his head emphatically at this. He knew where every kid in America, hell, every kid around the world, wanted to go. And that was Disneyland. Who didn’t want to go on the cowboy or pirate rides and eat churros and hot dogs all day?
Dean hums in response, his hand already reaching to cup Cas’s face to pull him in for another lingering kiss.
Sam decides to take over. “Is it safe enough to cross? We need to get across and we can’t really afford to take a detour.”
Cas doesn’t buy it for one second.
“You’re good.” At Dean’s dismissive scoff, Cas rises from his spot and advances towards him. “You don’t believe me?"
Cas’s eyes widen in surprise- because he’s finally acknowledging him or because of what he just said, Dean’s not sure. He’s busy noticing the crinkles at his eyes. Which he likes. A lot.
Moving past Cas, he mutters a quick “Whatever you say,” and crouches by the fishing equipment they’d carried here, hoping to subtly mark the end of this conversation.
His name sounds different on his tongue. He doesn’t say it as a warning. Dean... He doesn’t say it as a cry for help. Dean! It’s just Dean, plain and simple.
Something warm and happy bloomed inside Castiel; no matter how many times he heard Dean call him ‘angel’, or ‘my angel’, or ‘sweetheart’, the words never ceased to fill him with delight.
In this still clearing, merely occupied by a rider, his loyal horse and wiry threads of dry grass, Dean feels like he can finally breathe freely again.
He releases the breath he’s been holding. Within his palm is the small rock, now warm to his touch, which he squeezes one last time before letting it drop in a light
He claps his hands once, clearing the air for good. “Alright, now that that’s done, let’s go. No need to shake on it and all that. Better hurry or Sam is gonna chew off my head when we get back. And by chew off, I mean nag at me ‘til I regret it to the core of my soul."
Cas is weird.
“Yeah, already told you, Cas. You’re family. And family always has a place with us.”
“Hello.”
His eyes took a few seconds to scour the surrounding field and spot a still figure standing among the tall grass. For a long moment, Castiel’s feet stayed rooted on the fir porch. Solitude was rare for them these days, almost unheard of. They woke up, warm skin touching and sticking in places; they ate, shared jokes and cutlery over the kitchen table; they slept, fingers laced, the same sheet stretched over their shoulders. Perhaps Dean needed this. Needed to be alone for some time.
The Devil’s name was not uttered once. Nor was any other archangel’s.
Just two nights ago, he’d found Dean in the kitchen downstairs, fully absorbed in the process of spreading peanut butter on a piece of grilled toast. Caught in the act, Dean had explained somewhat defensively that night-time cravings were a normal thing and that he “wouldn’t get it”. Not that it mattered here; Dean could eat a million peanut butter sandwiches and never face any of the consequences.
Bobby turns to him, a mixture of amazement and exasperation on his face. “And make us loose our best mark?”
At his words, he felt Dean detach from his shoulders and draw away from him, though their hands remained linked. Patiently, he watched Dean’s eyes scour the surrounding field, searching for the right words to express himself.
The fort was theirs to claim. Or at least what was left of it.
He exhaled. “It’s not about what I want. It’s about what the kid wants.”
Dean’s not sure how to answer so he stays quiet.
Despite how long they’d been here, the loudness of the night still surprised Castiel sometimes. The continuous buzzing and chirping, courtesy of the crickets and other tiny creatures living on their farm, made him feel as if he were lying outside in the long grass rather than beneath the bed’s covers.
They should get moving soon.
Unlike Sam and himself, the rest of their group weren’t seasoned riders. Hell, even if they had been, there weren’t enough horses around to even put up a proper circus show. They’d gone in a hurry, only grabbing what their eyes could see and their hands could reach. That’s just how it was, and they’d have to make it work somehow. If they had to share seven horses among twenty people or so, then so be it. Dean had grown up being taught you couldn’t change the cards you got dealt with and he’d resigned himself to it a long time ago.
“Why do you-”
“Because I didn’t want my decision to influence yours in any way. I wanted the choice to be your own, so I waited. But now I see that that might take longer than I had suspected.”
“It’s been a long night,” Dean says, as if his words say it all.
Cas smiles warmly at him and says, “I’m glad. I would have hated to carry that weight for the rest of my life.” Dean offers him a smile back. “And it was nothing,” Castiel assures him, shaking his head, “I enjoyed helping you.”
“All right. Step one. The three pillars of fishing.” He raises his free hand and one finger lifts on command at each of the following words. “Location. Bait. Gear.”
Although they’ll come back empty-handed and raise a few eyebrows, it doesn’t feel like it was a waste of time, at least not to Dean. Part of him hopes he’s not alone in this.
“Sure,” says Dean.
He pulled Cas closer to him, close enough to feel his tender warmth envelop him. He rested his chin onto Cas’ shoulder. Cas followed.
“I’ll have two!”
Leaning on his elbow by the carefully hand-picked items, Dean returns in the same vein, “Something tells me I’m gonna need more than just one.”
Before Dean or Sam had any time to come up with a Plan B, they’d become aware of another presence in the building. More than one, judging by the barely audible scuffle of approaching footsteps. Underequipped and unprepared for a fight they hadn’t expected, the small pack of vampires which had sneaked into the room easily overtook them. Among the group, the brothers easily recognized the young waitress Dean had chatted up less than an hour ago. Smirking, she explained pleasantly that hunters were not welcome here. This town was theirs. On the other hand, tourists were tolerated, and even lured here by the Americana quality of the classic motel by the side of the road, or the unremarkable but endearing rock landmark. Usually, once they’d outlived their dual purpose of distraction and food, they were disposed of swiftly and efficiently, before anyone caught a whiff of something unusual. Unfortunately, someone had clearly messed up this time, or the waitress would not have heard two fake FBI agents discussing vampire activities in her diner. Dean would have felt bad for the poor sucker who’d botched his job if Sam and him weren’t currently so occupied with being surrounded by a horde of aggravated vampires.
Cas rotates the can slowly to gradually reveal the label. “Better.”
So the church is... well it’s Dean’s meagre attempt to say thank you without having his lips do the work. Even though neither of them will get a lot of use out of it- they both have big plans after all, don’t they- Dean hopes Cas will like the gesture.
I screw this up, there’s no going back.”
“Got it, chief,” Dean replies as he turns on the ignition. He feels the car come to life and purr beneath him.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. What the hell is he thinking? Inside a church of all places. Not that he cares but still. They built it for Cas, not for Dean to have a hideout to daydream about him.
“I was washing myself. But then it felt so nice and I... I must have gotten distracted,” he says, looking bashful.
Dean lets Sam reply.
“What?” Dean asks, conveying as much irritation as one possibly can solely through one word. His jaw clenched, he watches his brother hover and hesitate, like a giant vertical seesaw.
Dean rubs at his eyes with the back of his hand, drawing out a yawn at the same time. The light coming from outside has dimmed,  basking the walls inside in an orangey-gold aura.
“Look, man. You didn’t let me down, because I’d just met you that day, okay?” Dean drops the rod and the lure sachet defeatedly and gets up again. He looks at Cas, his lowered shoulders and his cheerless expression. Resisting the urge to reach out, he falls back on words instead. “You wanna ride gung-ho halfway across the country looking for a bunch of sons of bitches, hoping it’s gonna change anything, then go for it. Like I said, I ain’t the one to judge.”
“I thought we were done with preachers.”
Dean considers it for a moment before he’s reminded of what had meant to follow the chant. A few minutes late and they would have walked into a house of corpses. A charged shudder runs through him.
“I guess we’ll have to follow it downstream until we find a safer place to cross,” Sam says to his right. As usual, the voice of reason.
“Just give it.” Dean holds out his arm impatiently.
Sam’s vest in hand, he turns to Cas. “Here, take this.” The other’s eyes widen in surprise. “You look like you’re about to turn blue any second now.”
He takes a step forward and stops himself.
How did he even get up there, anyway? The rampart’s too tall to climb up in one go.
Failing to contain the profound affection seeping into him at this tenderness, Castiel’s voice broke slightly as he uttered back, “Of course, Dean. Always.”
of his hammer emits a spark of satisfaction at doing something so manual. He’d forgotten how good it felt to work with his hands.
“What about you. What’re you doing in the middle of nowhere?” Dean’s hands gesture vaguely at their surroundings. “Looking for a hot piece of land to hoist up your new house of the Lord?”
“We both seem to be migratory birds. That’s why I thought it’d be good to give you a way for you to contact me. I... I printed it on your receipt.” He then adds quickly, “If you ever need my help again.” He pauses. He looks like he’s considering something. “If you want to. I won’t mind.”
Cas doesn’t give him a chance to apologize.
Sensing they’re not getting anywhere, Dean recovers and speaks up, “Who are you?”
Something twists painfully inside Dean. He bites his lips.
“Look, I don’t know Cas,” Dean continues, “He seems like a nice guy. Maybe a bit weird, but nice. But we can’t go and trust every stranger we meet.”
“What do you think happens, Dean.”
“Thirty? That’s it?” Dean’s brows scrunch together. “With all that extra stuff you made me get?”
Cas opens his mouth and hesitates, his eyes glancing down then back up to Dean. “Then, does this mean we’re... good? You and I?”
-----------
Turning around, Dean’s unruffled to find a rugged-looking Bobby, his worn flat cap a spot-on reflection of the man himself. Life on the road had never suited him. He’d always been more comfortable in his cabin up north, helping the bounty hunters and outlaws he could tolerate, and where he was able to lie in a real bed at night instead of a thin bedroll. A bedroll which would drive him towards an early lumbago-related death, he liked to remind them daily.
Dean snapped out of his contemplation.
Sam stifles a laugh. “What? Didn’t trust Bobby?”
“Who cares? When have you ever done easy, anyway?” He grinned at Dean as he squeezed his shoulder.
Dean shakes his head, the corners of his mouth curling up. “Just focus on your grip.” He ushers Cas with a guiding palm on his arm. “Raise your right hand a bit more there.”
“Alright... are you there, God? Are you, hmm, listening?”
, Dean.”
There’s no reluctant protest from Cas, who comes to hover at his side when Dean beckons him closer.
He let his thumbs brush the glass rim before he answered.
While some of the tension had drained away by the time they reached the car, Dean was still unable to completely let go of the knot in the pit of his stomach. Even as he sped away from that godforsaken town, with his crashed-out brother dozing off in the backseat, his grip stayed taut on the wheel.
He blinks rapidly and swerves his attention back to Sam.
“— I know, Cas.” Dean drew out a sigh, frustration etched in the tautness of his shoulders. “I know, okay? He’ll come when it’s time for him to come. And it’s not like I don’t want him to take his time down there. He — he deserves to enjoy it. No one knows that better than I do. But knowing that doesn’t make it easier to...”
Part 3 coming tomorrow!
Cas fiddles with his fingers, and folds his palms together before tucking them between his knees. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.”
“What?” Dean repeats idiotically. “Then why didn’t you tell me?”
Dean felt an overwhelming urge to grab his brother in his arms. Or to tackle him to the ground.
Castiel forms a remarkably dissimilar picture with his buttoned up, white dress shirt, its sleeves affectionately rolled up, revealing a pair of tan forearms and strong hands. Over it, a blue vest which bears his employee tag, both appearing to be in perfect condition. And despite fine lines adorning his face, at the corner of his lips and eyes, his expression says awake.
Castiel nods thoughtfully. “I thought that might be the case.”
Castiel hums slowly in agreement. Products begin to be picked up one after the other by meticulous hands and scanned efficiently under a faint red light. They are then placed with a rustle into a brown canvas bang.  The process is only slowed when Castiel plucks a green and chunky-looking kind of drink.
“More like didn’t trust Texas weather to leave it standing for that long.”
Unperturbed, Bobby asks, “You a preacher?”
Before Cas has a chance to reply, Dean grabs Sam’s shoulder brusquely.  “Uh, Sam? A word?”
Cas takes a second to reply. “Oh. I was just trying it out, like you asked.”
In a rare and precious instance, Dean didn't wake up with a start. There was no cold sweat drenching the fall between his nape and the dip of his back. No halted breaths of apprehension. No blood pounding in his ears, overpowering all other sounds around him.
Breathing harshly, Dean looks down at the fabric of his shirt clenched between Cas’s fist. Another hand is hot below his shoulder, keeping him solidly balanced while he finishes catching his breath. There’s sweat pearling at his brows and behind his ears. Getting old sucks.
“Oh. I though I’d heard someone,” speaks the stranger.
(See the end of the chapter for
The trunk open, he leaned down and pressed his face down on the cooler’s lid. Some relief spread through him as he felt coolness seep from the smooth plastic surface.
The house’s silence confirmed its emptiness. After letting out a drowsy sigh, Castiel untangled his legs from the thin sheets and pushed himself out of bed. He didn’t bother with slipping on anything above his pyjama pants before heading for the door.
“Their song. They were right in the middle of it when Sam and I...” He lets his voice trail off.
Dean tenses instinctively at the incredible closeness of it all, Cas’s nose suddenly pressed next to his, the tingling sensation caused by his light stubble, the warm lips caressing his. Involuntarily, he emits a soft sound, non-interpretable even to himself. He buries the hand not enclosed in Cas’s into the layer between Cas’s waist and the folds of his shirt. Together, they sway back towards the wall until Cas’s back collides softly with it.
They’re all speechless for a few seconds, before the soaked, half-naked stranger speaks up.
“I’m not."
“Remember how long you made me wait?” Castiel asked, eyes boring into Dean’s.
“It can be both, can’t it?”
“I know, dude.” He rolled his eyes half-heartedly, trying to brush off the incoming chick-flick moment. “We can come back here, we’re still young, we’ll bring Jack next time, blah blah blah...”
Soft neon lights paint Dean’s cheeks, concealing traces of fatigue and worry. Dean starts towards the gas station entrance. Apart from the drag of boots on gravel, all is quiet. It’s too early for office-goers and too late for the chirp of crickets.
His frown was gone and a smile was tugging at his lips.
Cas comes closer to him and lays a warm hand on his arm. Water is still dripping from his hair, pearling at the tips and landing softly on his cheeks before rolling down. “You did a good thing saving these people. I’m sure they must all be very thankful for your actions.” His hand slides off as he turns to Sam. “And yours too, Sam.”
Cas doesn’t reply. His sky-blue eyes are fixed wide open on Dean’s hands.
Castiel makes his way to the counter, gracefully sliding behind it and setting down the packed basket by the cash register. With a small frown, he proceeds to smooth down his vest with the flat of his palms, eliminating wrinkles invisible to anyone else but him. Once finished, he glances up with a smile.
He refrains himself from placing a hand on Sam’s shoulder. Unlike Impala, it might set him off more than anything else.
They finished off their meal unhurriedly, their bodies and mind grateful for this rare moment of respite in their lives. Dean chatted amiably with their waitress as he paid the bill, while Sam leisurely browsed through some brochures on display by the entrance.
“I’m fine.” Her mouth quirks up at Dean’s hands shooing her away. “Go, go.”
Dean huffed out a laugh and he turned sideways to take a look at Cas and the swimsuit he’d helped him pick at Target earlier in the morning. His eyes climbed the whole length of his body, his bare feet covered in specks of sand, his sturdy bronzed legs leading to crossed arms above his hips, and a slight pinch at his lips as he stared Sam and Dean down.
He waves his free hand at Cas. “Pshh, it was nothing. No biggie, honestly. Barely took me any time. So no need to thank me, really.”
“Thanks for that. Gotta remember I’m not twenty anymore.”
“Of course we do,” replies Castiel, sounding almost offended. “Follow me,” he instructs, turning his back to him and starting off for another aisle.
“Shh.... it’s okay, baby, it’s okay,” Dean murmurs soothingly.
There’s no hello from Cas’ side but Dean feels him steal a glance his way.
Cas complies wordlessly but it still doesn’t look right to Dean. He
“I miss him,” Dean finally said.
At least Sam had woken up and been conscious enough to call him to ask where he’d gone. They had been through a lot worse. Sam’s been through a lot worse, he tells himself.
Sam looks down at him, the corners of his mouth lifted in a hopeful smile. “I guess we got lucky for once.”
"It suits you," he said, his eyes fixed on the view before him, where timid waves softly caressed the beach. "I told you."
“Lucy’s my guitar.”
Dean and Castiel watch the cars pass by, their drivers yawning at the wheel, while they head for the Impala. They keep their pace slow, dragging their feet and displacing dust. Neither of them have somewhere to be immediately. Castiel is already where he needs to be, and Dean knows that Sam was well enough to give him a call and complain about him being gone.
“C’mon, let’s get started,” he says, his eyes sliding away from Cas.
His legs felt shaky standing up after so long. He fidgeted in place, trying to alleviate the ache of stiff muscles in his back and neck.
because Castiel did not reside in this house alone, nor was he normally the sole occupant of this bed.
He watches Cas smile humbly, seemingly touched by Sam’s gesture.
“All around, that will be 25 dollars,” Castiel announces.
“Whoa. Slow down, Sammy,” he said, grinning. “Drinking ain’t gonna make you forget your defeat against Mr. Sun Tzu here.”
Dean found himself heating up unexpectedly and took a large gulp of his beer. He planted his bottle in the sand.
Years of knowing Dean have taught Bobby how to deal with his sass.
Following his gaze, the stranger’s expression shifts into something resembling concern, his brows slightly furrowing, his weight shifting uncomfortably from one foot to the other. “I deeply apologize. We usually never get customers this early, and it just slipped my mind,” his words rush out. Then a pause. “Are you alright?” he asks, his stare settling back onto Dean.
But tonight, Castiel couldn’t blame his inability to return to blissful darkness on the crickets, as much as he would have liked to. No, tonight, the problem had to do with the
The belief alone had cascaded and transformed into innumerable new possibilities, and Dean spent hours at night imagining and planning for them in anticipation. Certain daydreams were modest and mundane. He saw them putting their books and weapons down, driving down to Las Vegas for a week-end of strip and fun. He’d done it a few times before, but only with Sam. Maybe this time, they could bring their angel along and teach him a thing or two about poker. He reckoned they’d be unstoppable once they’d convinced Cas that ethically-questionable dealings could transform casinos into a substantially more enjoyable, and profitable, experience.
Dean’s almost too giddy to grasp the meaning of Cas’s words, but his expression says enough.
“Oh yeah? Did you find some fancy gut warmer under those bricks?”
He laces his fingers together, and makes his thumbs rub at the joints. The sensation is welcome, but the distraction it offers is momentary. In a few seconds, his mind careens back to Claire’s finger twirling in her hair. The finger expands and tans, as the light lock of hair being played with caramelizes into a rich brown color. Cas pushes the annoying stray back behind his ear. His blue eyes widen and he leans towards-
Sam watched Dean’s reaction closely, probably making sure his words didn’t fall on deaf ears. And they didn’t, not completely.
“It’s not about what I want.” Dean snaps back. He regrets it instantly and tries to continue more coolly. “It’s about... it’s about me spending my whole life drifting from town to town. It’s about me not knowing any other way to live.”
A firm hand landed on his shoulder.
With Castiel, he just mutters a quick “Thanks”, as he opens the car door and slides into the Impala. He doesn’t shut the door after himself.
Dean shoots up from the pew. He eyes the golden sliver of light escaping from the door, barely left ajar by Cas. He turns back to him. “That was different. I always knew it was gonna be temporary."
"How's the water? No sharks?"
“On the ground?” Dean scoffs in disbelief as he straightens up. “You trying to catch death or something?”
“And what was the first?” Sam shoots back.
slide Cas’s hands up himself. Hand on hand action. Not exactly the most scandalous thing. He doubts even the most disgruntled Puritan would raise an eyebrow. He’s only trying to teach a man how to fish, for god’s sake. Why is he overthinking this so damn much?
His mind couldn’t wrap itself around a future without a reason for all of them to spend a majority of their days, and their nights, together, crammed between glossy leather seats and blaring Zeppelin classics. Crappy diner food, late night research, temporary home sweet homes. It was all Dean knew.
Cas nods. “Gladly.”
But Castiel had never been good at leaving Dean alone, so his feet began taking him in Dean’s direction, his mind having little say in it. Below, the long grass brushed gently at his knees. It felt like he’d mowed it yesterday, but clearly, he was somewhat losing track of time here.
if it isn't the most endearing thing Dean's ever seen. He stalls for a moment, licking his lips and waiting to see if Cas will call his bluff.
"Just, y'know. With friends. Or say if.. I don't know, man, remember when we met that dude in that bar who bought you a drink and he made that comment about giving you a bed to sleep in?"
The conversation dies but there's a strange desperation in Dean's stomach to find a way to circle back into it. The weight of Cas' eyes on him as Jack spoke still burning. "Hey. Sorry I... uh. I mean, I guess I assumed stuff. Sorry about that."
Sam chokes on a cough.
"I see. I'm not sure I would be in a position to make age requests. What about you, Dean?"
"You know he like.. looks up to you for this stuff. Don't be a dick."
His mouth is dry and he coughs, wondering if he swallowed a bug.
When in the hell did he get so sappy?
Sam."
“C’mon, he’s a pretty innocent guy. He doesn’t realise humans make everything sexual. You’re the one who always makes this stuff out to be worse than it is.”
When he re-enters the bar Cas is sitting silently looking around the room at the other patrons and Dean feels a pang, remembering how when they first met he'd have sat staring straight ahead in the same scenario. He's interested now. He cares now. He even smiles, just a touch, when he sees Dean coming back towards him.
"Uh-huh."
“I see.” Cas thinks about that for a moment. “Can I ask what in particular?”
, that’ll keep it frozen in time. “Just stay.”
He doesn’t say goodbye. He doesn’t make another sound at all actually, until he’s back amongst the trees and a sob escapes his throat.
The question is inquisitive but utterly blunt and for a blood-curdling second Dean thinks it was directed at him, until he realises Cas’ eyes are burning a hole into the side of his face for a different reason. He turns to meet them briefly, and Cas’ gaze is shifty. Dean looks away first, turning back to Jack.
-----------
“This is it man! This is what we needed!”
Dean freezes. “Well, I was doing it for everyone here. But yeah I guess you’re the one who might end up using it the most,” he ends with a shrug.
Dean stands his ground, jaw locked. “If you’re lookin’ for a saint, Cas, it ain’t me.”
Dean let the silence sit for a while. He tried to discern what Cas was observing in the distance by following his gaze. All he could see were melting shades of pink and orange dyeing the sky.
With that luscious hair to protect himself from the summer’s end sun, wearing a hat like Dean’s would just be redundant. But like his brother, he sports a weathered pair of jeans, frayed at the ends and torn at the knees. They’re a bit too loose-fitting to Dean’s liking and same goes for his blue cotton shirt hanging limply on his collarbones.
The body of the final nail sunk into the top, Dean blows away the stray wood shavings and gets up to contemplate his work. The cap rail he just fixed looks right at home, blending seamlessly with the back of the pew. With a smile he can’t contain, he smooths his hand over the rail, feeling an urge to pull his knife out and carve his initials into it.
The flash of hesitation in Sam’s eyes comes as a surprise blow to him. He gets the hollow feeling they might not saddle up and ride towards the distant sunset just yet.
“So, this is where you’ve been hiding the whole day,” a voice breaks through Dean’s stupor.
Smooth, Winchester. Very smooth.
Getting Cas to agree had been just as easy. Perhaps because he’d discovered him in their TV room, unreservedly unfurled across the recliner, like a cat contentedly stretched out on soft blankets. There’d been some show about two attractive guys remaking homes playing on low volume in the background. Dean had hovered for a minute, taking in the scene, before he’d squeezed gently at Cas’ shoulder. In a voice half between a breath and a murmur, he had asked him about a day off at the beach. A drowsy hum had been the angel’s only response, while Dean had watched him deepen the curve of his back and readjust the position of his legs, bringing them tighter to his chest. Unwilling to disturb Cas’s peace any longer, Dean had smiled softly at the sofa and made a movement to turn off the drowsing sound coming from the screen, before soundlessly closing the door behind him.
“Take care of yourself, Dean,” Cas says with another smile, this one softer. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder once and lets his hand slide off back to his side. “I might not be here to help the next time you come.”
“And her sorry dog who got buried with a gold nugget inside? Yeah, go ahead.” He waves a hand at Bobby. “Only heard that one a couple hundred times.”
“You gonna pass out on me or can I go?”
“I’m letting them go.”
He contemplates how to break the silence. Thankfully, Cas speaks up before he can make some trivial comment about the nights getting longer.
In the natural light, Dean can better appreciate Castiel’s sun-kissed complexion and his bright eyes matching the deep blue of his vest, stealing glances at him as they amble side by side, their shoulders close, almost touching. Seen from the outside, they don't look like a pair of strangers who just found each other. Instead, they’re old friends, walking each other home the morning after a party, not one where the walls pulse in beat with the music and lamps end up broken on the floor, but the kind where secrets are whispered into yearning ears and new friendships are formed under the glow of low lighting.
“Yeah, I’ll come wake you when it’s your turn.” He won’t.
“I think he likes being outdoors.” He looked at Sam and continued. “And as Sam said, he doesn’t know anything of the world around him. He’s never seen the million-year-old cliffs of the Grand Canyon. Of course, he won’t get the chance to observe its birth from the carving of the rushing waters, as I had the chance to, but I think he may still find it beautiful.” He paused. “But we could go to Disney as well if if that’s where you’d like to go,” he added more slowly, his eyes setting on Dean.
With a smile, Cas rolls his shoulders back lazily while stretching his neck. He’s as relaxed as Dean’s ever seen him. Cas has always seemed relaxed on the surface, exuding some kind of ‘cool and collected’ aura around himself, like there’s a plan out there and he’s following it without having to try. But there was usually a reserved edge to it, reminding him of what Cas had lost and what he still has to lose. That edge looks like it’s rubbed off somehow.
“I am.” He pauses. “Or I used to be. Is a preacher still a preacher without a church?” he muses aloud, avoiding their eyes.
“I’m Dean,” he says, before Castiel has to ask again.
If possible, the stranger’s half-confused squint intensifies. “I’m not sure I understand,” he says in a gruff voice.
“It’s beautiful. I can see, no, I can feel the craftsmanship that went into it.
He takes in a breath before he tells Cas, “I hope you’ve still got some of that good Samaritan spirit within you because we’re gonna need you for a while longer. Sam says we gotta fix this place up a little before we can stick a fork in it.”
“Well, I told you I’m a preacher,” Cas starts helpfully. “So was my father. He taught me how to read with the Bible. Taught me how to ride too.” His brows furrow. “Although not very well.”
Dean reaches for Cas’s shoulder and rubs at the junction above his collarbone. He’s comforting himself as much he’s comforting Cas.
“Not bad, old man,” Claire chimes in over his shoulder right before he gives in to the urge to whistle at an inanimate object. Thank god. She never would have let him live that one down.
-----------
Dean replied with a soft hum and he let his head drop onto Castiel’s bare shoulder.
When Dean deemed they’d put enough distance between themselves and the oversized vampire nest, he cruised the Impala down a well lit parking entrance, leading to the Neo Soleil motel. With some effort, he managed to drag his giant of a brother to the room he’d just booked for them. After laying Sam down on one of the room’s double beds and getting the first aid kit they always kept in the trunk, he unceremoniously poured out a bottle of disinfectant onto Sam’s wound and dressed it with gauze and bandages. Once done, he sighed as he watched blood swiftly sweep through the first layer of dressing. He was going to have to make a supply run.
Dean blinks at him.
“I know,” she groans, rolling her eyes for good measure while shoving a roguish blonde curl behind her ear. “That’s not all I meant anyway.”
The second week, wooden structures supported by repurposed bricks emerge out of the ground, like trees sprouting out of paved roads. Pretty soon, they’re joined by boarded floors and planked walls, just waiting for the sturdy beams that’ll keep them dry when the rain comes.
“Yeah?”
"Remind me to see if I can find a cassette of his music."
Sam stands up from his chair, long limbs brushing against Dean’s legs in a way that snaps him out of it. "I wanna get some sleep, so if you're gonna watch
then book another room." There's an innuendo over the words that makes Dean want to slap him. He smirks at Dean's reaction.
"Can I get you a refill? You can watch it be poured." Cas twinkles.
He sits down and adjusts his chair a little so they’re not awkwardly crammed into one side of the table. Just a little, though – not enough to take them out of each other’s space. "Look, the uh.. the stuff before. That was a joke. I was just messing with you."
The episode continues in much the same vein until Jake gets home from school. Dean looks up at the sound of crying to see Jake stood inside his front door with his bag dumped at his feet, tears courtesy of an over-enthusiastic makeup artist already staining his face. Something in Dean’s chest constricts watching him sob, the desperation and fear evident in his face.
The moment clings between them. Cas tilts his head a fraction. "Is that why you make those jokes?"
“Sweet.” Dean nods and tips his head away, running a hand through his hair to try to gain some composure as Cas smiles at him as though nothing’s happened.
"Yeah, I know what Tinder is. But no, I don't."
"I find a beauty in all forms of media, in their own way."
"Woah, what happened?"
“That whole Tinder thing? C’mon, dude. Transparent.”
Cas thinks about that for a couple of seconds, eyes boring into Dean so deeply he half-wonders if he can’t still see his soul. He walks further into the room but doesn’t approach Dean – not really. Just takes a couple of steps between the distance.
He knows he won’t. If he comes back, he won’t be able to leave.
"Nothing. Freakin’.. Jake and Freddy."
"Sure."
They’re two hours into a seven hour car-ride, and suddenly Dean wishes for nothing more than for Cas to do one of his sudden disappearing acts.
"Are those kind of jokes common? I'm afraid they pass me by sometimes."
said something. He places his fingertips inside and runs the fine dust through them, wondering if its morbid.
Jack nods thoughtfully. "I hope so. I'd like for them to be happy."
“There’s really no need. You can still make the jokes.”
"A phallic symbol. When an item-"
“You think you don’t
“I had no intention of sending anyone nudes, I understand the limitations of undercover work. But I suppose you’re the experts, so I’ll defer to you on this.”
"That girl is a bad influence on you." It makes him happy to hear they talk, though, and he can't help the smile on his face.
“Really? I’m not so sure.”
about it but there's always a hundred excuses prepared in his head about
"I'm not straight."
"Cas likes them, don't you, Cas?" Cas looks shifty. "What?"
"Yeah, sure you don't. Nobody's that obtuse, not even you."
"I surprised you."
But Cas has said it now and it - god, it's not like Dean's never
why is there a lump in his throat? “It means something. To me. It means a whole lot, actually. Maybe if it didn’t it’d be easier to talk about. There’s stuff that I wanna.. stuff I need for you to hear. That you deserve to hear, when I get my head out of my ass. Because I don’t feel like I deserve any of that crap you said to me, but you deserve to hear things back.”
“No?”
“Not you yourself. Just.. there are things about you, sometimes, that put me a little on edge.”
"So, are you new in town?" Cas offers with so much sudden sincerity that Dean chokes on his drink.
"Sure. Yeah. You protect people you care about. You never think.." Sam goes to continue and then thinks better of it.
about Cas. An affinity with nature and animals, the sense of calm he exudes even when he himself is running on chaos. Was, he corrects himself.
"Honestly, Jack, I don't know. 's a good point."
"Light in there's good for reading. Kid follows me around." It's an easy excuse, pathetic and transparent and a little mean actually but it makes Cas duck his head with a smile all the same.
"Had it never crossed your mind? I'm an angel."
"Right. Is it upsetting to be gay? Or was Jake still upset about what happened at the prom?"
"So yeah, Jack's here. I guess you know that, though. He's.. well, he's probably a little bigger than you were imagining. And he - he looks like you, actually. Which is-" hard. confusing. gut-wrenching. "-weird. You'd probably get a kick out of it if you could see him."
"Yeah. Yeah, it is. Or maybe he just.. I don't know, maybe Jake didn't know for sure himself. Sometimes it takes a while to figure it out."
?" Dean splutters at the new information, refusing to look up at Sam's reaction.
"I'll bet." It should be another chance at innuendo but it isn't - Dean finds himself smiling fondly at Cas as he does the same back.
"I told you I don't know him well enough."
"So sometimes people make those jokes because they're sexually or romantically interested in you."
he does, conversation getting a little too heavy for what Dean intended. Not that he's sure what that was anymore.
“I don’t know, I’m not into that touchy feely crap.”
“It was. I’ve watched more than you realise, Dean. I think I’m capable of making comparisons.”
? It was making Dean feel…
Because if Cas feels the same (the
“Yeah. I’ll bet.” Dean smiles in what he hopes seems supportive and not at all pathetic or guarded. It seems to satisfy Jack either way.
"OK." Cas responds, and though he's clearly trying to hide it he sounds confused at the sudden conversation.
He cups his hands in the water and brings it to his face – it’s cold in spite of the sun, and fresh, and he does it a few more times.
He closes them now and sees him. Shadows of wings behind him in a disused barn. Smiling at him on the side of a highway at night. Blood pooling from his mouth as he begs him for his life.
Sam, who is currently presumably stood now on the other side of the door with a shit-eating grin on his face.
Cas looks genuinely embarrassed. "It genuinely didn't cross my mind. I know I can be obtuse.."
"Right.." There's learned uncertainty in Jack's voice as though he's trying not to ask more questions even if he's still unsure. Dean squirms a little further.
"Like the whole.. being attracted to guys thing." He hates how formal it sounds, foreign on his mouth. Like it's clear he's been thinking about it.
"Thanks." Dean eventually settles on.
He raps his fingers on the bar while he waits to be served, delaying for as long as possible before he looks back at the table. Sam is still talking to Cas with a smile, though Cas looks equal parts baffled and awkward.
"Not all humans are male or female, either." Castiel's surprise is masked again now, his voice a little soft in the way he reserves for Jack (and Dean, he barely thinks to himself). "There's no binary for gender identity in the same way as there isn't for sexuality."
It feels like a monumental admission but it’s clearly not the thing on Cas’ mind as he frowns.
"I'm enjoying it. Justin Timberlake is very talented. Did you know he's a singer?"
There's a strange pause before the word and Dean isn't sure if it's the end of a sentence or not, but it doesn't matter because at that moment the door opens and Dean drags his eyes away from Cas to look at the looming figure of his brother in the doorway.
“I’m sorry for the breach of privacy.”
"Why is it such a big deal? It's rare, right? Is it like special?"
"Believe me, Cas, I can see that."
“Do you have an example?”
“I’m not gonna make some big speech. Not now.” Not when you’re not here to hear it, Dean thinks, though that’s a pointless exercise because he knows he can’t say it face-to-face now either way. Still a coward, even now. “I just hope you’re alright wherever you are. I hope you’re at peace. And if not then.. well, you’ve got this place.”
“Yeah, I think Dean’s right.” For once, Dean is glad of Sam’s eyes on him. “There’s some weird people on those apps, Cas, the last thing you want to be doing is sending nudes.”
"And what's happening with Zach's dad?"
"That makes sense. I downloaded it to investigate and a lot of the men seem to post pictures of their torsos."
He begs that Jack's gone to talk more about Jake and Freddy. Serves Sam right, he's the one who brings it up. Dean chuckles to himself.
"She made a joke I didn't understand and suggested I Google it. This film was the first result. From what I gather, a 'friends with benefits' relationship is when two platonic companions begin a sexual relationship that gradually develops into romantic interest."
".. Yes?"
, Dean thinks. ‘
“Even me?”
“Better than being in the ground, huh? You’d like this better.”
"No."
“I know exactly what you are, Dean.” The words are clear and sincere and Dean wonders if there’s anyone else in the universe capable of arresting him so simply. “I’ll leave you to it.” Cas eventually nods at Dean’s breakfast and smiles, dipping his head as he starts to leave.
As he’s about to tell him to just spit out, Sam finally fesses up. “It’s just...” he casts his eyes downwards before looking up hopefully at Dean, “maybe we could stay here for a bit? I mean, Bobby’s kinda right, we’re not done watching out for them yet. Just look around us, they don’t even have roofs over their head!”
Dean stops him with a hand. “Just sit down. I’ll be right back,” he tells him. “Man probably don’t even know what a bedroll looks like,” he mutters as he turns away, loud enough for Cas to hear.
With the number of stories Bobby is spinning, Dean swears he could give a conman a good run for his money.
That would also mean extra days to their journey. Days Dean doesn’t have the patience for.
“You’re sure?” Dean pants.
He’s standing with one hand on his hip, the other shielding his eyes from the midday sun as he watches Dean walk up to him.
Suddenly, the tension dissipates and they both let out a breath. With a small shock, Dean takes sight of their fading shadows, the sun now mostly blotted out by the distant hills. Feeling a twilight chill brush at his neck, he remembers they’re supposed to be at least halfway back to camp by now.
Their epic battle had drawn in the attention of a few bystanders on the beach. A tall silver-haired woman had her hands suspended in mid-air, an uncapped bottle of sunscreen in one of them. A father and his little girl, or so Dean assumed, had both stopped adding more sand to a mound most likely hiding a pair of adult-sized feet.
“So, uh, tell me something about yourself, Cas.”
Cas smiles fondly. “He sounds like a good father.”
“Alright, good night.” Sam bumps his shoulder playfully with Dean’s as he brushes past him.
Castiel thankfully distracts him and says, “I’ve forgotten to even ask for your name.”
As they draw closer, Sam tells Cas warmly, “We’d really appreciate the help, Cas.”
“Actually, shouldn’t we shake hands? To make it, umm, official?” Cas asks hesitantly.
“I think you forgot to mow the grass,” Castiel said simply, in the guise of a hello.
Pretty soon, the darkness becomes too thick a layer for them to see where they’re stepping, and Bobby calls it a day. They set up camp, prop up the tents and start a few fires, and it’s not long before a light-hearted chatter starts floating above slowly-heating pots. It’s become an effortless routine for them.
“Guess You don’t know either, huh?”
They barely talk as they make their way around the shelves. Dean doesn’t explain why he needs enough first-aid supplies to refurnish a small infirmary and Castiel doesn’t ask. Instead, he satisfies himself with making a few comments about whatever item he’s busy getting for Dean. This one he chose because he’s used it personally when a bee had stung him just outside. That one, a customer has praised, and said it’d made him feel more energized. And Dean just listens. He lets Castiel’s words course through him, lap at his edges and pool gently in empty spaces. It’s easy to do. His voice is the only one to resonate inside, and his presence the only one to be observed.
A long fucking time turns out to be a measly four weeks. That’s it.
“Dean, I understand how wrong my intentions might appear to you. Especially now, now that I know what kind of men you and your brother are-"
Dean knows this deadly blend of puppy-eyes and passionate plea. He’s seen it a thousand times, both as a witness and the receiving end. It’s the one that means Sam has something close to his heart and doesn’t want to let go. It tells him Sam’s gotten more attached to their runaway group than he should have.
Bobby huffs out a laugh. “Which star did you crash from, son?”
Dean’s under no illusion that he’ll be back anytime soon. It’s usually not how this works. But he asks the question anyway, “Then where will you be?”
“Okay. Thanks, Cas. What I meant is that I didn’t mind doing it.”
Lucky for Cas, he doesn’t have to play horse anymore, and he’s happily sitting on top of Impala whereas Dean is stuck walking beside them.
Dean doesn’t break the newfound silence and just looks at the store around him, maybe waiting for Castiel to leave and get back to work. But Castiel doesn’t. Instead, he keeps watching him calmly. But before the quiet can overstay its welcome, Castiel opens his mouth again.
Outside, the sun is just beginning to make itself known to the sky, and streetlights fade into the rural landscape once again. It’s going to be a warm day, the air hot and dry around them.
At second glance, it doesn’t look much better. Heaps of stony rubble, remnants of structured defences, and lonely bricks that catch at Dean’s feet, getting a curse out of him before he catches his balance again. His eyes linger on stray cigarettes littered here and there, probably by some guys who thought they’d save a few bucks skipping the town supply store and heading here instead.
No surprise there.
------------------------
Dean is tempted to order Garth and Bobby to slow down the third week when he notices them fix a door to one of the cabins, a sense of quiet anguish brewing inside him.
It was a short walk back to the Impala, more tiring in the sandy stairs Dean had to climb to reach it than in its actual distance to the beach.
Dean grinned, recalling the night Cas had made his dramatic entrance into the barn, only this time, he was half-naked and his eternal trench coat was nowhere to be seen. Maybe Sam had a point.
Cas had easily blended in with the rest of their merry little band. People liked that helping out was a second nature to him, it made him approachable. They’d come to him about injuries, to ask if this herb or that berry was edible, and once Dean thought he’d passively overhead someone wonder if Cas would listen to their confession. As far as Dean could tell, Cas genuinely wanted to lend a hand.
Apparently reassured that Dean isn’t going to keel over, Cas lets go of him gently. A pair of denim inches apart, they’re sitting close enough anyway that either one could keep the other from falling.
Like Bobby, he also had an innate gift for storytelling, though his stories never tended to be as crude as Bobby’s, preferring heartfelt fables over deadly shootouts in the pit of the night. Though Dean was aware his stories of youthful naivety were not meant for him, he couldn’t help but listen in, enraptured as if he’d lived the tale himself. He was indistinguishable from any other kid around him, eagerly watching Cas with his head bowed, distractedly rubbing his palms together, about to lift his gaze and launch steadily into another tale.
He should have left it at a simple
“Nah, I’m good,” he says, shaking his head. “We’ll be stopping soon anyway.”
“Did I ever tell you about the time with little Miss Jody back in ol’ Silverton?” Bobby half-slurs, following another swing of whiskey which ends with the jug getting slammed back onto the ground. The flush on his cheeks is hard to miss, made more crimson by the glowing fire, and he’s shouting instead of talking, plastering an amused smile on Dean’s face.
They were words Dean had told himself in the past in hopeful fits. They didn’t stick.
Out of the jumble of plans and fantasies sprouting inside Dean’s mind, getting buried in booze and money in Las Vegas was easily among the tamest of them. Countless others were far more daring, unrestrained, impossible. Quitting the life, settling down. Retiring.  He knew Sam saw an end for them which didn’t end bloody or worse. As for Cas, he’d given up Heaven for them, turned his back on his brothers and sisters. All he had left for a family now was two weary hunters and Lucifer’s kid. Dean couldn’t blame him for wanting something better. He tried to ignore the antsy feeling he got every time he imagined Cas sliding into his crappy car and speeding away once he realized there was no more urgent life-ending crisis to be dealt with. An irrational part of him wanted to rush down the bunker corridor, creak open a door, and check for the presence of a tan trench coat carefully folded by a curled-up sleeping form.
“Hello. Would you like a bag?” Castiel asks, in an amusing mix of professionalism and playfulness.
“Okay, we’re good.” He cast one last glance around him. “Just your towel and-”
He closed his eyes.
Dean sighs painfully, cringing at his own words before they even come out. “You know we can’t, Sam. That’s not how we do things.”
“Well technically you still haven’t.”
She’s only the first person ever to beat Bobby at holding his liquor. Pretty impressive, really. You had to be there. By the time she was downing her fifteenth shot of moonshine, five guys were already passed out on the floor. Bobby included.” He smirks before he adds sneakily, “Oh, and Dean too.”
Dean throws him his proudest smile. “Damn straight."
Like the brave man he is, Dean keeps a precautionary distance from Cas throughout most of the night. He hangs around Bobby and a few others instead, half-listening to old cowboy legends and exaggerated tales of damsels in distress.
“All right, let’s set her down here gently,” Dean instructs. He refuses to get a scratch or a dent in this thing before Cas has even gotten a chance to see it.
“Dean, you might screw it up. Hell, Cas might screw up too, you know.” He gave Dean a small smile. “But then you’ll work it out. You always do. You forgive him and he forgives you and you get past it. That’s just how it goes,” he finished softly.
He blinks rapidly when the handle is jammed into his hands.
“I decided the first week after our arrival here,” Cas says evenly.
Dean opens his mouths, hesitates, and shuts it. He shakes his head uselessly and starts walking again.
“Maybe Cas can keep you company. Make sure you don’t nod off.”
“You don’t seem fine,” he says, his head slightly tilting to one side.
“We’ll stop at the next exit!” Dean shouted over the sound of guitars.
When they reached Dean, they looked brighter and lighter than they had in months. In years. Dean couldn’t hide the matching emotion on his face.
Sam shuts his mouth in a stunned, narrow line while Bobby uses this brief respite to retreat tactfully.
------------------------
Dean scratches at his throat. “Help me carry this thing inside.”
“It took me a few tries as well,” Cas admits.
Thankfully, Cas senses Dean’s awkwardness and lets it slide, gracefully moving on to an easier topic of discussion, such as the beautiful sunset occurring outside or the fact that they’re running low on lamp oil.
The strangers’ eyes squint as his head cocks slightly to the side. “I’m sorry. Perhaps English isn’t your native tongue?”
“Ready?” Dean prompts when they’re both in position.
Dean blinks in surprise at the strange request. But why not. If a handshake is what it takes to appease Cas, then he’ll gladly do it.
“What?” It’s the only word he knows at this point. “After what you said about not letting bad people get away with doing bad things? And you needing to do this?”
Squeezing Cas’ shoulder unnecessarily, he tells him, “We sleep and shit in the dirt, but we’re not savages, Cas.”
“Truth be told, it’s not as bad as I thought it’d be.”
“I couldn’t let you boys handle all this on your own,” Bobby huffs out. “A big job like this, you needed all the help you could get.”
Arriving late into town, they took a few minutes to book a room at the only motel they could find, a surprisingly fresh looking sort of building called The Eclipse, changed into their FBI suits and set off on the road again towards the murder scene, this time by foot. Reaching their destination, a small park containing the ‘Squarest Rock in All of Kansas’, their suspicions were soon confirmed by a police officer guarding two chalk outlines. Despite his clear suspicion at two federal agents in a small town like this, followed by some reluctance to provide them with more details on the case, he’d finally confirmed that the two corpses had in fact been found drained of their blood. But apart from that, nothing else had jumped out at the scene and both brothers saw no point in wasting any more time there.
This was how Dean had ended up at the nearest Gas-n-Snip well before the sun was due to rise. He figured they’d have what he needed the most urgently. A shit-ton of disinfectant. New bandages, for this time and the next ones. Whatever healthy snack he could get his hands onto, he knew Sam would appreciate it when he got back. And beer for himself. Normally he’d go for some pie too, but cleaning up that wound had left him with an irony taste in his mouth.
-----------
Dean sighs. Playing it cool really didn’t work out for him.
The thought of Cas getting a boost from someone makes him grin for some reason.
Whatever. They didn’t have to decide right away. Dean was good where he was now.
“My job makes it so I don’t really stay in the same location for too long,” Cas says, taking a quick look back at the store they just came from. “I oversee the well-functioning of Gas-n-Sips around the country and evaluate them. I’ve only been here for a week, but I don’t expect to stay at this one for more than a month.”
“Trust me, you don’t.” Dean tries to pull away by retrieving his hand but Cas doesn’t let him.
“You planning to sleep here?” he asks Cas, the corner of his eye watching him shimmy closer to the grass.
Sam takes a second too long to reply. “About half-a-thousand miles, maybe.”
The lyrics he heard back in the barn aren’t coming to him. The dizzy afternoon heat and the scent of dying candles are all he remembers. And the bewitched, vacant expressions of those chanting. Yet his fingers don’t pause.
Cas lets go of his grip on the door to step away from the car and lets Dean give it a satisfying slam. Dean gives Cas one last look through the side window, one which hopefully doesn’t reveal too much of what he’s feeling right now. Gratitude, contentment or whatever it is. Cas returns the stare with a tranquil smile.
They still were when he approached Cas, but at least walking made him feel like he could breathe easier.
“Screw it. I’m just gonna jump in.”
There is the sound of an Impala 67 door slamming. The crunch of boots on gravel. A rising voice on a phone.
.” Sam snorted. “Like you don’t drink on the job.”
“All right, let the girl have what she wants”. Dean raises his hands in surrender and makes an effort to get up, feeling his knees crack in protest. “Have fun you two,” he adds and turns away, eyes already scouring the camp for Sam.
They were reaching the end of the rope and they could all feel it. Even Sam’s non-stop optimism was beginning to falter under all they’d been through.
And then there’s Cas. Although technically not rescued like the others, Dean has taken him under his wing anyway.
It isn’t much of an apology, but Castiel nods slightly. He shifts again, looking like he has something more to say.
Sam cleared his throat.
Casting one last wistful look towards the lake, he hardens himself, getting ready to tell Cas the fun’s over.
-----------------
It takes them two whole weeks to reach the vestiges of the forgotten Civil War fort Bobby had told them about. At first sight, its decrepit state, from patchy masonry to rotting timber structures, both fighting a losing battle with wild weeds and weirdly-textured moss, raises several questions. How much combat has this thing withstood? And how is any part of it still standing?
I want what you want.”
Dean swallows. There’s some truth to it but everything stills feel raw. Turning his attention away from Sam, he studies Cas standing a dozen meters away, listening intently to whatever Bobby is saying and nodding his head politely every few words or so. He looks harmless to Dean too. Especially in Sam’s oversized vest.
Any reservation he’d had about Cas had vanished when he’d watched him hoist a kid up on his shoulders and whinny like a horse while he carried her across.
“Is it just me, or did I hear you talking to your horse?”
“Hey, guess who won’t be young forever.”
When he spots him, he freezes in his steps. His shoulders tense with some nervous feeling he can’t pinpoint at seeing his brother, leaned back comfortably against an oak tree, deep in conversation with Cas.
“What is he? A stripper? Why does he have to wear so many layers?”
“I think she likes you too, buddy.”
Cas moves as if to get up as well. “There’s no need to. I can find-”
“You know, Dean... just because we’re going home now doesn’t mean it has to end here."
Dean can’t speak.
“Christ, I need a drink,” he says, to either Cas or himself.
Cas hummed contently, as he scoured Dean’s flushed expression. Dean licked his tingling lips.
Dean frowns. “What is it?”
Dean swallowed. He steeled himself up for what he was about to say. “But it’s Cas, man. He’s our best friend. He’s family. Maybe... maybe even more than that.” His breath caught in his throat. “If I screw this up...
The stranger’s eyes shift to him. “My name is Castiel. Though people sometimes like to call me Cas or Father.”
“Whoa. Are those...?”
“It went something like this.”
------------------------
He turns to Cas. “What? Since when?”
As a faint smile forms at the thought, he feels his right foot skid forward and dangerously drag the rest of his body along with it. By some miracle, his left hand instinctively grabs a nearby shelf before he can complete his fall. He’s lucky he has hunter reflexes, or he might have ended up sprawled on the floor, by the yellow cleaning bucket he’d admittedly failed to notice before. So sue him, he was exhausted.
Sam rolls his eyes. Sometimes, Dean swears he never grew up. “
With a serene smile, Cas says, “That’s good.”
His head drops in his hands.
“It’s alright,” Cas responds softly, his eyes holding Dean’s. “There’s no need to explain. Bobby told me what happened.”
Confusion spreads inside Dean. Even as he racks his brain over memories of the past few days, he can’t think of a moment when he’s stringed the words Cas and disappointment together.
Night hunting meant time to kill, and bars were always good for that. Sam and Dean are one beer down, but Cas in true Cas-style had taken a long enthusiastic swig of his when given it and has entirely forgotten about its existence since then.
Cas is standing in the middle of the room in an ill-fitting sweater and his hair is dishevelled as though he’s been tossing and turning. He looks so unremarkable, so human, so it makes Dean’s breath catch in his throat at the reminder.
, Dean thinks to himself.
"I've been a little busy saving the world a hundred times."
“When has that ever stopped you?”
“Honestly? I’ve never believed it. I don’t know why you give me the time of day half the time, man. And you don’t have to.. argue about it, or anything. I know you want to. It’s just how I see it.”
"Why would someone do that?"
Dean just about managed to avoid choking on his burger, patting the centre of his chest all the same as he looks across the table at Jack. He doesn't look at Cas' face, sat next to him, but he feels his leg shift.
At first Cas’ are stunned frozen against his and Dean starts to panic that he’s made some kind of earth-shattering error in judgement before the hand on his wrist relaxes and he feels a pressure against his mouth. Cas’ lips are a little chapped, like always, and Dean feels his eyelashes flutter.
"I've been thinking about what to do with you. Sam wanted to bury you but I... y'know what kept getting to me? You bought me back from Hell and you made me dig myself out of my own frigging grave. You son of a bitch." Dean chuckles to himself and shakes his head. "So I didn't wanna put you underground. I guess I thought if... well, I don't know. But Sam said it's my call and so here we are."
How would that even work? An angel and a human dating?
"Yes. It's a dating app where you can upload a profile."
a reason Cas treats him differently, just as he knows deep down there’s a reason he treats Cas differently too.
"I don't want another drink."
"Hey, Cas."
"Castiel?"
"That was pretty forward."
"You told me once that humans do that."
Dean thinks about all of the times he’d woken up, in the early days, to find Cas stood over him staring at him intently. Rifling through his bags. Asking invasive questions, with no concept of what humans do and don’t share. It did bother him a little, sure. But he’s used to it by now. That isn’t what’s bugging him.
Screw Sam for bringing it up anyway. It’s hardly relevant. Just because he has this...
Dean brings his hands up to cup Cas’ face around his ears on his neck and jaw, in a way he has before and convinced himself wasn’t ever possible when they weren’t battling life or death. Cas’ stubble is a little longer than usual and he strokes the line of it with his thumb, watching as Cas’ mouth falls open just a touch in the echoing silence.
A glance at the scorched ground from the sun concerned him. Could he start a fire like that? No. Right? No, that’s dumb. Only he hasn’t really slept properly in weeks and he didn’t exactly finish high school, and so Dean finds himself jumping to his feet and heading back to the stream.
Still stretched on a towel, Dean watched Sam pick up half-buried bottles from the sand and stuff them in their bag while he played with a stray thread.
Dean fidgets in place. Having Cas peer down at him like that makes him feel like he’s been cornered by the local sheriff.
He felt Cas’s eyes on him as he slipped on his t-shirt, but didn’t meet his stare.
“I’m looking for the men who burned down my church,” he says impassively, staring ahead.
“Canned apricots, yes.”
Dean’s stomach drops at the slight accusation in his tone, but he plasters on a smile and says, “That’s okay. Like I said, I didn’t do it for me.”
Cas’s face lights up. “You think so?”
Dean is taken aback by the instant apology and its sincerity. Normally, when he’s being a dick, people have no problem with acting like one too. Fair is fair. But this is different, and he doesn’t really know how to deal with that. He also doesn’t feel like being unnecessarily rude or snarky, and part of him already feels guilty for snapping at the guy like that.
Dean tenses at the words. Sam seems to sense his wariness, as he shoots him a sidelong glance.
Cas made no acknowledgement of Dean’s presence.
Dean drops into a crouch and takes hold of the polished-looking rock that caught his eye. Rubbing his thumb over the smooth black surface, he lets a dusty breeze sweep by, pulling slightly at the frayed rim of his hat.
Sam throws him a defiant glare. “Why not?”
Dean follows Sam, taking a few step forwards and squinting at the figure. From here, he can just about make out the silhouette of dark-haired man and a pair of arms cutting through the waters.
Their pace was slowing down but Dean wasn’t too worried. Despite the river hassle, they’d dealt with it surprisingly quick once Cas had given the go ahead. Everybody had rolled up their sleeves, grabbed the closest bag, horse or kid, and wet their feet without hesitation.
“Howdy, partner,” Dean greets in his best nonchalant voice, tipping his hat towards  Cas.
“You know, looking for someone in these backwoods is like plunging into a giant haystack, right?” Dean says lightly, trying to break the tension.
Dean’s skin felt burning hot. He wiped a hand at his forehead as he walked the last few steps to the back of the car.
“Uh-huh.”
After the unexpected success of their expedition to Apocalypse World, which had not only brought back their mother, but Charlie and Bobby as well, something had set aflame in Dean. He yearned for a break; something he’d never deemed possible before. Some kind of vacation. Him, Sam and Cas, laying on a beach, sipping cold beers and watching the sun take its lazy dive into the sea. With Jack on their side and Lucifer marooned in another universe, the world had never had a better chance of keeping afloat on its own. At least for a while.
The tune comes to an abrupt end, as if the rest hasn’t been written yet.
“It’s goddam cold is what it is,” Dean replies, his hands gesturing accusingly towards the ground. “That’s what bedrolls are for, you dumbass,” he adds, but there’s no heat to it.
“Wanna tell Cas we’re going?” Sam asked, his head nodding towards the shore, where a lone, shirtless angel stood motionless, facing the sea.
Dean frowns when Cas doesn’t move. Maybe they’re not good after all.
Dean’s grin drops when he notices Cas’s blank expression. His dad should have also taught him how to keep his mouth shut sometimes.
With that done, Dean can think a little clearer now.
His shining eyes caught Dean’s in the mirror.
Cas went on. “It’s almost physically impossible for me to forget anything. And yet, I’m so afraid that I’ll forget any of this.”
“Hey. Where’ve you been?"
Castiel’s mouth twitches. Dean decides annoyed Castiel could probably rival smiling Castiel.
Dean lets the silence sit.
Dean straightens slightly and looks at his foot play around with the small rocks underneath. As he contemplates his reply, he feels a hand land softly on his shoulder and rest there. When he looks up, Cas is close enough for him to breathe in the fruity smell of lime and honey. It does something strange to Dean, makes him want to lean into the touch of someone he barely knows.
Dean sighs and throws him a hopeless look. “Alright, wait here, preacher. I’ll fix you a cot from the horses.”
kingdom,” Castiel corrected. “And it’s fine, I don’t mind them.” He paused, then added, “I was mostly missing you.”
When Cas finally speaks up, it drowns out all other sounds. The floor doesn’t creak anymore. The muffled commotion from outside dies off. Dean can only perceive Cas’s voice. “There was a little girl, a girl from my congregation, who was inside the church when it collapsed due to the fire.” He takes in a breath. “But there was so much smoke- she might have already been gone by then.”
Despite the small sigh she lets out, Claire goes to kneel at the other end of the pew.
powers, as Dean had so eloquently put it years ago, amplifying every decibel to both the joy and dismay of Castiel’s ears. But Castiel doubted it; he felt practically
After a minute, Dean’s cooled down enough for him to grin in thanks to Cas.
Well, crap. What are they supposed to do now?
Cas frowned at him. “You asked me what I wanted and I told you honestly that-”
“How...” he starts, but his mind goes off-track, lost in awe at the tinned treasure within his palms. Mouth dry, he tears his eyes away and looks up to the other object of his devotion. “Where’d you even get this? I thought all we had was peaches and peaches and peaches.”
“Dad’s been dead for years, Dean,” Sam breathes, words stripped of any previous combativeness. “We don’t have to follow his orders anymore.”
Sam didn’t let Dean get away with it. “Dean, don’t. You know I’m talking about Cas. And whatever’s going on between you two.” He took a step towards Dean. “I’m your brother. I can tell when something’s up with you.”
It’s nice but it’s weird.
The air grows thicker and something swells in his throat, as his voice carries onto the next verse.
“Dean, it’s clear this must have taken hours and hours of work,” Cas admonishes. “A
Deans grins. “Our dad taught me and Sam too. Taught us everything we know and then some.”
Tonight, the fires feel a little warmer and the tents a little more welcoming after their prolonged journey. Spirits are up thanks to the fish being cooked on improvised skewers; one of the good things that had come out that river.
Castiel looked down at their hands and squeezed Dean’s fingers, before glancing back up at him. “It all worked out in the end, didn’t it?”
Sam leaned forward in his seat to press at a button and the music stopped. The car sunk into a partial silence, as guitar riffs and repetitive drums were replaced with the steady thrum of the car and the intermittent wailing of seagulls.
As expected, Dean’s first instinct is to tell Cas to fuck off. Harsh and pissed comes a lot easier than anything else. But he reigns it in, not willing to spoil everything he’s built with Cas so far. Cas means no harm, no matter how blunt he can be, and Dean doesn’t want to be a dick.
“I understand,” says Castiel, as if he truly does. “Some nights feel longer than others.”
here. There was no reason to use his powers here, in this farm. This little morsel of heaven was safe — it was theirs.
“I have something that might cheer you up,” Cas says.
“Hey. We don’t have to go right now, right now.”
-----------
His emotions were a mess.
Once the stranger reaches the bank, Sam bends forward and stretches out a hand to help him up on the ridge. The man reaches for it in a strong grip and swiftly climbs up to stand on solid ground with them.
He casts a look behind him and releases a breath when he’s greeted by nothing but empty, yellowing grassland. His eyes settle back on Cas.
Cas huffed out a laugh and leaned towards him.
Outside of their bedroom, the hallway was steeped in darkness. Castiel smiled to himself as his bare feet made the oak floorboards creak discordantly. Dean had said it gave the house charm, back when Castiel had first showed it to him, heart pulsing nervously in his throat, quietly hoping for a sign that he had done this right. Dean had told him that his childhood home, the one back in Lawrence, was like that too. This had settled it for Castiel. Anything evoking the feeling of home in Dean was worth keeping. The next day, Castiel had made the floorboards creak just a little louder.
Cas’s gaze lifted up from where Dean’s fingers were loosely circled around his arm to meet his eyes.
“Judging by your earlier disgust, I’m guessing this isn’t for you?” he says, his eyes flicking up to Dean with a knowing gleam.
To be honest, Dean would have been content listening to Cas name birds and other creatures all night long. Once night truly fell, he’d continue pointing out stars and constellations to Cas, an endeavour started during their last night watch, and insist that every good cowboy knew how to use them for guidance, relaying what his dad had taught him decades ago to the best of his memory. But Dean knew they had to return to camp eventually, before their absence became a source of worry.
Cas stares down at his hands in thought before looking back at Dean.
Dean stops dead in his tracks.
Castiel shook his head imperceptibly, not wishing to disturb Dean’s position. “It’s okay. I’m putting the blame on
“I’m fine, Cas,” he brushes away with a wave of his hand. “Tell me, you got some wings hidden under that trench coat?”
------------------------
Dean puffs out an amused breath. “Am I doing it wrong, is that it? Am I supposed to get down on my knees and say Amen? I’m sorta new to this so I’m gonna need You to be kind of lenient this time if that’s okay. I, uhm...” He rakes his throat. It sounds incredibly loud to his own ears. “I’m at a crossroads here. Either I follow the plan or I don’t. If I do... if I do, it’s great. It’s just Sam and me again, toughing it out together no matter what.” He pauses and smiles. “Like it’s supposed to be. But... if I don’t it’s a different story. I’m tied down. Goodbye untraveled roads, goodbye camping under the stars... goodbye adventure. I guess it’ll straighten me out. I bet Cas would like that. Then maybe-“ He stops himself from continuing further down that line. “If You could help me out, that’d be great. Point me in the right direction somehow.”
Dean leaned his cheek into Cas’s palm, then lifted his hand to take a hold of Cas’s before bringing his palm to his lips. “Yeah, I know. Deep inside me, there’s a part of me that knows it. But I think I needed to hear it.” He pressed a gentle kiss onto Cas’s skin. “Thank you.”
“Can’t go a few hours without me?” Dean whispered into Castiel’s neck, hot breath tingling against his skin.
“Cas-”
“It’s not what I would call it.”
Feeling his cheeks warm, Dean pulls down on the brim of his hat.
“Take care, Dean,” repeats Cas gently. He grips the side of the open door. “Don’t fall asleep at the wheel,” he adds seriously.
“No, Dean,” he said, his voice firmer. “I want to be with
“Yeah?”
Dean senses Cas’s question before it comes.
------------------------
Any hesitance Dean had about helping Cas leaves right out the door as he recognizes a not-so-subtle tinge of annoyance laced in his tone. With a coarse hand, probably much coarser than the hands of a preacher, he reaches for his wrist and circles it loosely with his fingers.
His smile drops comically and he pushes her shoulder lightly. “I don’t have one foot in the grave just yet.”
Sam pushes his hair back impatiently and sighs deeply. “Dean, he came up to us, unarmed and undressed. He looked about ready to cry when you gave him my coat. Sure, we don’t know him. But he looks pretty harmless to me.”
Cas’ smile widens and he looks at Dean with an expression that resembles fondness, but probably isn’t that. “So did I. But Claire expressed to me that she was feeling lightheaded yesterday after coming back from hunting. I was looking for something with some sugar for her to eat when I stumbled onto this.”
Dean runs a grimy hand through his hair, his nails scratching painfully against his scalp. He turns to Sam with a sigh. “Great. That’s what? At least three more weeks of grubbing. Three more weeks of these goddam canned peaches.” He paces feverishly as he goes on, “They’re way too freaking sweet, man. They were okay the first five days, but I swear, if I ever have to eat one them again, I’m gonna have to shoot a man, Sam.”
Cas looks up at the low sound of Dean’s voice. There’s something different in his gaze, something sorrowful, that Dean can’t get a hold of, leading him to turn his attention back to the instrument below.
“Thanks, Cas,” he says, then looks away for a second. He’s not sure what to make of Cas’ patient stare. “You know,” he continues, “for helping me out and everything. And uh, all is forgiven with you almost killing me with that damn floor. Just so you know.”
Dean felt his shoulders loosen with relief. He smiled easily at Cas.
Dean shifted slightly. “Uh... we’re good to go. We’re all packed up.”
------------------------
Dean didn’t know how to start.
Part of him thinks he better, as he continues admiring his handiwork, clammy hands resting on his hips. He hasn’t put that much sweat into anything in a long time.
Dean smooths a hand over his stubble. He hopes he’s not going to regret this.
Dean softens when he looks at her glistening eyes. She’s the reason they’re all here, all safe. If she hadn’t warned Sam and him about Nick’s ‘ritual’... well, better not think about it too much. So who is he to ruin her fun?
Dean looks away brusquely. “Like you ever did.”
A few pebbles rattle softly as Dean pulls out the sunk-in pole handle.
Castiel tried not to linger on the sensation.
Cas’s brows shoot upwards. “Where?”
“Next is step two; tying the hook and the bait to the line. Lucky for you, I’ve already done the hard part. Now, your job is just to hold it just like that,” he shows off his hands on the reel and the rod, letting Cas get a good look at it. “All good?"
When he turns back to Cas, he realizes that whatever moment transpired between them is over. Cas’s crease between his brows is back and he looks ready for battle again.
“You know what they say about fellas who hear voices, Sammy.” Dean swings his head briefly to see his brother emerge from the brittle shrubbery, long strands of hair falling in front of his eyes and a small smirk playing on his lips.
He combs her coat gently, sweeping off patches of dried mud as his fingers come across them.
But it hadn’t been recently. No boot or horse tracks in his immediate sight, and none that had led up to here.
“Give me my hat back, Sam,” he says a little brusquely. “And gimme your vest too.”
Dean sighed. “Do we have to?”
Thank youuu for reading through this fic!! Here's hoping you enjoyed it (and that Destiel becomes canon in S15! :p ) You're more than welcome to leave a kudos/comment! <3
An awkward silence ensues. Thanks, Sam.
After a beat, Dean hears him let out a disappointed sigh and walk away.
Dean leans away from the Impala and turns towards Cas. His hands wipe automatically at his jeans.
Dean brushes his fingers through Impala’s mane softly. “Don’t listen to him, baby. He doesn’t know what he’s saying.”
Cas gets up on his feet. He takes a step towards Dean then stops.
Shaking his head disapprovingly, Dean turns to Claire and props his arms lazily on the bench behind him.
Bobby huffs at his side. “You better watch what you say about that grandpa, Dean, or you might find yourself without a guide pretty soon.”
Cas looks down at the hand on his shoulder then back up to Dean again. “There’s nothing I can change now. Nothing that will bring her back to her family again, at least. But here, I’ve found other ways to redeem myself. And new things,” without pausing, he lifts his arm to rest his hand on Dean’s, still rubbing soothing circles into his skin, “new

, not you.”
It seemed to be enough to break Dean out of whatever trance he was in, as he let out a quiet chuckle. “I’m pretty sure it’s your turn, angel.”
Cas doesn’t insist and they march in silence for a few minutes. They’re trailing behind the others but not by much. Dean gazes down below, where a colony of footsteps and hoof prints mark the soil.
“Wait. When did Dean become our best mark?”
Dean stares at Cas. “So what made you change your mind?”
Grinning, Dean pats him on the back and herds him to his side.
“You’re right. I’m not. And no one should be if they have the choice. But there are some people in this world who made the wrong choice willingly, because they find pleasure in it, or because they think they can gain something from it. And unless we do something to stop them, they’ll keep hurting good people, people who don’t deserve to be hurt. So yes, I’m not that type of man. But when I find them, I’ll be whatever I need to be to put an end to the suffering they cause.”
He plops down at Dean’s side. Dean watches him shift for a full minute before settling on a final position.
Dean already knows. There’s a reason he never lets Sam or his Baby stray more than a mile away from him.
“Yeah, sure Cas.” Dean lets out a grin and steps towards him. “Let’s shake on it.”
“The man didn’t have a single swimsuit, Sam.”
Remembering why they’re out here in the first place, Dean rolls his shoulders back and slaps his hands exaggeratedly on his worn-out jeans.
“I- I still believe in the things I said that day. They need to be caught and punished.” He hesitates. “But not by me.”
Speak of the devil.
Right. Him. Leaving.
He felt a small tinge of disappointment as he found the kitchen lights off; he wouldn’t have said no at another opportunity to tease Dean gently. The faint smell of cherries still perfumed the air, a sweet reminder of the beautifully latticed cherry-pie Dean had baked them for dessert. For the first harvest of the season, those cherries had given more than they had needed to. Castiel slowly ran a finger over the dinner table, where flour dust still lied stubbornly encrusted in the grain of the wood.
“Yeah, that’s what it means, Cas,” Dean replies with a nod.
Now, the Cas sitting in the back of the Impala was a sharp contrast with the sleepy angel Dean had witnessed a week before. Although his chin rested on his forearms occupying the empty space of the front seat between the two brothers’ shoulders, his back was leaned towards the front windshield and his eyes fixed on the fluid landscape of nemophila flowers lapping at the edges of the sea-side road. His hair danced wildly with salty winds swishing in from the open windows.
Even by the time they finish their indoors excursion, and Dean has snapped out of his daze, the roadside Gas-n-Sip remains deserted, save for a benevolent shopkeeper and a heavy-eyed hunter trailing beside him.
Losing some of his previous bravado, Dean slides back towards his side of the pew, but lets his arm stay where it is.
Sam snickers behind him, bringing a brief smile to his lips.
At once, Castiel twisted his head slightly to bury a kiss into his hair. Did it also smell of cherries or was he imagining things?
“What the hell is that?” he asks, nodding towards the shape getting closer to them.
After wiping his hands on his jeans, he reaches out for Cas’s extended one. They shake once, and before Dean is fully aware of what’s happening, he feels Cas pull him closer, both hands clasping his back, until they’re pressed together, ear to ear and toe to toe. Cas’s chin burrows softly into his shoulder. His warm weight settles over Dean. Still half-stunned, he wraps his arms around Cas, keeping him pressed closed.
“He’s an angel, Dean,” Sam reasoned. “Don’t you think God’s soldiers would have been taken a bit less seriously if they’d gone around smiting people in speedos?”
But these past few weeks... They’d trudged through swamps, endured mosquito bites, snakebites and a close call with the jaws of a gator, and gone nights without a fire because of the goddam humidity. All that on a few hours’ worth of sleep and disgusting tinned fruits.
Cas’s eyes squint and he repeats slower, “Location. Bait. Gear. Got it.”
Their lips brushed together. Their embrace deepened. A hand slid around his nape. One at his side. Their foreheads touched briefly before they pulled away.
“I don’t like it either.”
Inside, it’s just Dean and the quiet.
The past few weeks had been a sludge covered nightmare. Ever since leaving the barn, they’d ridden relentlessly, only stopping at nightfall to set up camp and setting off at the first light. Every mile they put between that place and themselves made them breathe out a sigh of relief, but their rhythm was a punishing one bound to give out eventually.
“What’s ‘not too far away’?”
“What kind of men? What does that mean, Cas?”
He hears Cas shuffle while he shakes his leg, attempting to get rid of the knot in his knee. He bends down to grab the guitar neck.
Feeling slightly grateful, Dean puffs out and addresses Cas, “Trust me, the next day was even more fun. Had to dig up her dumb dog from the backyard. With the worst hangover I’ve ever had to this day.”
Now, he’s sweating buckets despite the chillier fall weather, as he hammers nails into a curved and polished length of wood on top of an otherwise finished pew, trying his damndest not to strike his fingers. Each clear
Dean answers with a grin of his own. “Can do.” He whips around and grabs for Impala’s reins. “Come on, girl. Let’s get you some rest.”
Turning his back to Cas, Dean paces to the unhung cross. There are delicate flowers etched on each end, with their interlaced roots, or maybe vines, meeting in the middle to form a diamond-shaped blossom. No engraving is needed to disclose the author behind the piece.
A newfound silence settles between them. Dean keeps his eyes cast downwards, where his worn-out boots reveal their tears in the firelight. It probably wouldn’t hurt to invest in some new ones next time they cross civilization. Make Sam get some too. And Cas. He can’t tell whether the leather on his feet was once black, or if it’s always been this tawny shade of maroon.
“What did?” Cas asks quietly.
"It feels very different," said Cas, as his hands tugged gently at the seams of his boxers.
A week in, even the smaller kids begin pitching in where they can, pulling out weeds and making two-way trips around camp getting people the stuff they need, one brick or one log at a time.
Though Dean must have heard his approach, he didn’t turn. Castiel was struck with the temptation to lace his arms around him from behind, but bravely resisted it, instead planting himself at Dean’s side, shoulders not quite touching.
Dean blinked. When his eyes opened again, Cas was gone. For a few seconds, he stared dumbly at the spot where Cas should have been standing, until he saw him violently emerge from beneath the surface, like some human-sized sea monster, and lunge swiftly at Sam from behind.
“It’s okay.” Dean sighed and smiled back at Cas. “I’m just a dumbass.”
His shoulders sag as soon as the last word leaves him, but his jaw remains set, his knuckles tightly locked on the reins.
Cas’s expression doesn’t change. “Admit it. You don’t want to leave.”
Dean cleared his throat and his gaze slid away from Cas.
“I know, Dean. And that’s fine, because you’re here now. And eventually, Sam will be here too.” Gently, he slid his palm across Dean’s neck to come cradle the curve of his jaw. “What I mean is, there’s no rush. I know you miss him, and I can’t fix that for you, even though — even though I wish I could. But believe me when I say that this, what you’re feeling now, it won’t matter once he’s here.”
Dean’s hands ducked in his pockets, where they felt less revealing.
“On three. One. Two. Three!”
“Tsk. He can wait up for a few more minutes, can’t he?” His hand let go of Cas and dropped back to his side. “You can finish doing, uh... whatever it is you were doing.”
Dean offered him an apologetic smile. “To be fair, I didn't know that you were.”
Like some kind of psychic, or like the little brother who grew up beside him, Sam says with a grin, “Finders keepers?”
“I want to be with you,” came the hushed answer.
Castiel’s hand brushed against the back of Dean’s, before reaching for his fingers and intertwining them with his. His thumb smoothed over familiar veins and skin, feeling out curves that no longer held any secrets from him.
“Isn’t Sam waiting for us?”
Dean’s pacing comes to a stop, and his hands bury themselves in his pockets.
“It ain’t over and done yet, son.”
Dean lets out a curse when his foot almost misses a step as they make their way up the short flight of stairs marking the entrance to the miniature church. Really, the church is more of an elongated bare room right now, with two carved out windows in the back and a finely carved cross resting against one of the walls, waiting patiently to be hung up. The floor’s creaking follows them until they stop halfway into the room.
Cas pulls on the reins and the horse stops treading as well. He waits for Dean to say something.
A headache presses its way up at the back of Dean’s neck. Fighting with Sam has always felt like running headfirst into a brick wall and attempting to take it down bare-handed.
He hands his gambler hat to Sam, refusing to let it gather dust on the ground, and prepares to unbutton his shirt when he notices a weird blob floating in the distance.
He braces himself for Cas to react in some way, to brush it off with a joke or scoot away from him, but nothing breaks. Cas acknowledges the hand on his knee with a flicking glance, his expression not betraying anything and Dean can’t tell if what courses through him is disappointment or relief.
“I hear you, Sammy. I just... This shit’s not easy.”
Dean cracks a smile while Sam extends a friendly hand to Cas. “It’s nice to meet you, Cas.”
Castiel slides up effortlessly in his saddle, making the soft curve of his back disappear. “What would you like to know?”
Dean’s face broke into a grin. “Tsk, come here, you moron.”
Cas doesn’t reply, his thumb absently rubbing the horse’ rising and falling shoulder blade, but Dean knows he’s listening.
------------------------
“Yes, this position is comfortable enough for me.”
“Here you go, chief.” Dean was up and brushing sand off his shorts.
And how right he was. Seeing Cas look so human and petite, although nothing about him remotely approached the mundane or fragile, made Dean's chest tighten impulsively. He felt overwhelmed and undeserving of witnessing such light and tenderness. Cas’s green-leafed humanity had only made him more radiant, fiercer, stronger. Dean was only grateful they had been given the honor to serve a part in the nurturing of his soul.
Sam shot him a wry look.
“I’m afraid I’ve disappointed you,” he says, lowering his head.
It’s clear he’s not saying everything, but something in his tone keeps Dean from pushing.
Dean claps his hand on Bobby’s back again. “And it’s all thanks to you.”
“Sorry for waking you up,” Dean said, as Castiel felt his jaw shift against his shoulder.
“Good thing you won’t be around I’m not,” she quips back with a smirk.
Cas cocked his head to the side. “I’m sorry?”
He tried to steady his breathing. Sam took another step to stand up before him.
Trudging behind his brother, Dean rubs at the back of his neck. “Yeah, sorry, Cas. Just needed to sort something out.”
He shook his head. “It’s just, I come here, finally goddam ready to tell you that I want you to stay with us.” His head shook again. “No, with
Dean blinks. He hasn’t thought that far ahead yet.
They carried their weapons bag, now filled with towels and sunscreen, down to a quiet stretch of the beach. After a short battle against strong gusts of wind, Dean laid down three towels on the fine, white sand. He wasted no time in stripping down to a pair of basic black swim shorts while Sam did the same.
He felt the sun beat down on his neck, sweat pearling and rolling down his back.
He chuckles inwardly. Sam is gonna freak out when Dean tells him. And he’ll do it once more when he finds out they’re staying.
“I’m sorry. I had no idea,” he says quietly.
“What do you need?” he asks.
Dean flushes and sends him a betrayed look. Maybe he can save the piss-drunk Dean stories for when Cas isn’t around.
“Alright, you win.” Sam grins broadly. “But I’m warning you, one wrong move from him and I’m not firing any warning shots.
He takes in the distressed leather covering his feet. They’d never gotten around to grabbing a new pair after all. Guess it would have to wait a little bit longer.
Sam steps closer to the river bank. “Pretty sure that’s a who, Dean.”
He figures he might as well test it. Judge how deep this thing really is for himself and hopefully give the a-okay to the others.
Unaware of Dean’s train of thought, Castiel smoothly gets back to his task. After less than five minutes, he types a few numbers into the machine in front of him and looks up to Dean. He must be about an inch shorter than him, Dean muses.
Cas responds abruptly. “Then how have you been living this past month?”
Dean grins. “Relax, padre. I’m not teaching you how to shoot today. We’re just fishing.”
He gets to his feet and rubs his palms roughly on his jeans.
The second it takes for Cas to answer stretches like eternity. “Of course.”
"It's supposed to, genius," he retorted, but without any bite to it.
If you’d asked him a week ago if building a church for a community who’d almost gulped down lethal ale to find ‘the greater truth’ or whatever bullshit Nick had fed them, his answer would have been some vehement variant of “hell no”. If you barely make it out of a whirlpool, you don’t jump back into it the next day. That was just pure common sense.
He breathed out deeply.
Sam lets himself be pushed away by his brother, while Dean shouts a “We’ll be right back!” over his shoulder.
“Yeah, he was. In his own way, you know,” Dean says, a small smile tugging at his lips. “He’s the only reason Sam and me are able to make it out here.”
Dean huffs out at what he’s about to do, rubbing his palms together before he immobilises them, holding them pressed together from wrist to fingertips.
They’re still on the road when night begins to fall. Wanting to make up for lost time, they’d decided to push on for a bit longer, even if travelling at sundown made them all feel a little uneasy.
Cas twists away from Dean to fish something out of his trench’s long pockets. When he turns back to Dean again, he presents the can in his hands like a gold digger showing off his findings.
His free hand climbed up the length of Dean’s arm, stopping to settle itself on the slant of his shoulder, partly skin and partly the fabric of a stretched and faded henley.
Dean interrupts himself mid-nod with a loud yawn.
Behind his back, he hears Cas spur on the horse and set after him, but he doesn’t catch up.
I can occupy my mind and my heart with. This place has become my home now.”
He rubbed the bridge of his nose.
“Hey, we’re here to cool off,” Dean said, raising his palms in defense with a shrug. “It’s not like we’re on a job or something.”
“Cas, you cheeky rebel,” teases Dean, a wide grin stretching on his lips. His hand fishes into his back pocket for a few stray dollar bills which he hands to Castiel’s own outstretched one. Their fingers connect fleetingly, soft meeting harsh.
“Sure we did,” Dean agrees amiably as he lets go of Bobby before the other starts grumbling. “And it is pretty much done and over with. We got them here. We didn’t get  any of Nick’s psychos tracking them down and tryin’ something. Which means they either gave up or their bubble finally burst and they realized the type of cockroach they’d been following. Personally, I’d put my money on the first one.” He adds, with an approving nod, “We made some good time.” He pauses and catches Sam’s eyes conspiratorially. “Anyway, Sam and me have got some beaches to get to, don’t we Sammy?”
Their short goodbye over, Dean shifts the gear and smoothly backs out of the station’s parking. His head turns towards the country road stretching before him. He rolls down the window and lets the sunlight stream inside and nestle on his skin. Dean basks in the warmth for a second before he steps on the gas, eager to get back to Sam. At the next red light, he takes out his phone and he searches the bag sitting next to him for a certain paper.
“Are you happy, Dean?” Cas murmured, hot breath on his neck.
Dean complies wordlessly. He lets Castiel lead him around the store, first to the medical supplies section then through the maze of parallel shelves. He lets Castiel add random things to the small basket which has magically materialized in his hand. He watches him reach up to grab an ointment from a shelf, muttering something about preventing infection. He waits idly by Castiel’s side when he stops to examine two different types of smoothies in one fridge. He doesn’t protest as he notices Castiel slipping a bottle of vitamins into the basket. When Dean slows his pace to take in the smell of the pies on display, Castiel does the same and lays a hand on a peach pie to tuck it in safely with the rest of the groceries.
Sam nods to himself. “Okay, we can do that.” He pauses and asks, “You think you could give us a hand?”
“In any case, I’m sorry if I let you down.”
He kept his eyes closed, only letting them open when the sounds of laughter had quieted down, almost drowned out by the tide.
“Trust me, I know,” Dean says, tossing his head back and lifting his eyes upward until the stars comes into view.
“I like this horse,” Cas states out of the blue.
Castiel flusters at Dean’s questions. He lowers his eyes and a faint tint appears on his cheeks. “I’m not supposed to give customers discounts according to the Gas-n Sip-regulations, but I decided to make an exception,” he admits bashfully.
As Dean looks into the clear blue of Cas’s eyes, all he wonders is what will happen when Cas leaves. How can he feel the loss already when the warm denim beneath his fingers is a solid reminder of his presence?
Dean joins Cas’ side, shoulder to shoulder, but careful not to let them touch. The height difference is subtle but it’s there, the slant of Dean’s shoulder cascading naturally into Cas’s. It can’t be more than a few inches, Dean estimates, before forcing his mind back on the task at hand.
“He says there’s an old abandoned fort not too far away.”
His hands seize the can from Cas before he knows what they’re doing.
Dean doesn’t pretend to know anything about paradise, pearly gates and the whole shebang, but if he had to go out on a limb, he figures it’d come pretty close to this. Wide, open countryside as far as the eye can see. Cool weather, a few foam-white clouds rolling over the mountains in the horizon and softening the harsher rays of sunlight, joined by the occasional fresh breeze. And crowning it all off, a tea-tinted lake where healthy bass leave delicate ripples on the otherwise calm surface. No matter how it ends for him, he’ll always have this.
When the sun starts descending behind round peaks, they’re still out there, by the water, with its liquid glaze now oscillating between a warm brown and orangey red. Despite their seemingly still surroundings, they’re sharing the lake with a discrete company, which gradually joined them as the hours passed by. Dark birds, their bill a small shield of white, drift idly on the surface, occasionally ducking underwater to peck at something. American coots, Cas had said, noticing Dean eyeing the birds. Turns out, Cas had a secret talent for recognizing birds, even when they remained cautiously out of sight. At a low-rumbling call, Cas had murmured “King rail” to Dean, as if afraid of being overhead by the bird in question.
He can see that Cas is actually considering it and it makes him feel like he’s burning up. He’s not homophobic – he feels a little weird when he thinks about Cas with women too, even when he’d been the one initially encouraging it. Maybe he’s angel-phobic, he tries to convince himself. Except no, he had sex with Anna.
“I’m looking for an insight into how the interface works.”
"Cas.."
"I will let her know that Dean and I's friendship does have some benefits, but not of the type she's referring." Cas points to the laptop, where Mila and Justin are in bed.
"Perhaps there's other material that will shed some light." He nods in decision and fuck, it's endearing. Always has been - watching him learn. He's so.. sincere, with the way he talks about the most ridiculous topics. Dean has seen fancy kitchen appliances fascinate him.
"Alright, well. Rule 1 of online dating. Never use a blank profile. That's what people do when they wanna invite you to their houses to eat you."
Dean fiddles with the edge of the book before closing it on his lap. "Shoot."
For reasons Dean refuses to speculate on, Cas’ eyes flicker to him. He stands up.
“There’s nothing else. We just haven’t talked about it, alright? Maybe I assumed when I shouldn’t have done, that’s on me.” Dean interjects quickly and covers what he hopes will be the end of the discussion. Sam raises his eyebrows and exhales, but doesn’t push further.
He feels heavy all of a sudden, his breathing increased from standing up, and he takes a couple of deep breaths to try and settle himself. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
"C'mon, Freddy, man.." Dean finds himself saying under his breath as he watches the boy stare at Jake through a windowpane, new girl hanging on his arm.
"Thank you, James. I'll keep that in mind."
"Oh. Why not?"
“I’m sure.” Dean winces, half-amused half-nervous, as he takes a swig of his beer.
“Oh yeah, I’m the one being weird.”
that? You really believe that?”
Jack is silent at this for a moment, and when he does speak again his voice is quieter. A little sad. "Castiel told me that the human God is loving and cares about people. That it's OK to let them believe that. Why would humans want to believe in a God that says things like that?"
His mom’s voice calls out to him and Jake picks up his bag and disappears up the stairs before she can reach him but soon she’s knocking on the door and Dean can feel a panic rise in his throat as he watches Jake pace around his room.
"No, like I said I was just investigating. I left my profile blank."
"So Cas is
"You're an Angel, aren't you guys supposed to appreciate pure things?"
"Yeah, I got cornered before he called Eileen."
Sam hums in assessment. "Yeah, maybe. Strength in numbers - he's here with his friends. Plus Cas was giving him the eye."
"To make me have to explain what I mean. To make me.." flustered is the word Dean thinks but refuses to say.
"Do you think Freddy's figuring it out?"
"Who did- whatever. Can we switch over?"
“For.. anything.”
Guys have hit on Sam in front of Dean before. He's always polite, and cracks a joke, and wishes them a good night with a smile on his face. He doesn't get weird or nervous or start stuttering.
He knows the real reason, of course. He ignores it and downs the first third of his beer in one go.
"Then why'd you say you enjoy them?"
“For me, it depends on the overall experience. Just because it’s longer doesn’t necessarily indicate the quality is better.”
"Do you like men too?"
"C'mon. What's the worst that can happen?" His voice is a little coaxing almost and how the fuck did Dean end up in a situation where innuendo laden filled three-way conversation led to this brother telling him to make moves on an Angel? “See you.”
"You told me not to trust drinks from strangers in bars."
A loud sigh emanates from Sam but Dean doesn't look, too distracted by the look of utter confusion on Cas' face.
"You think?"
"This seems a simple enough case. I thought I would take the opportunity to practice some of my practical hunting skills. In case there's ever a time I'm without my grace, or.."
"What?"
"Yes, we're just passing through."
They're doing research tonight, somewhere in the annals of the bunker. So is Dean, he reminds himself as he opens his book to the opening credits.
It’s the first thing Dean’s said since he sat down. The first noise he’s made full-stop, barely able to breathe. His voice sounds strange and sharp against the sound of the stream and the birds and he shuts his mouth again.
He fumbles in his back pocket and hands over a note.
"Sam thinks Jake's in love with him."
Busying his hands before he can think of anything else, Dean pulls the wooden box with its metal fastening from his rucksack. He places it down on his lap, running his hands over the carvings on the top. He doesn’t even remember where it came from – a relic from someone else’s life that found its way into his hands. Cas would’ve liked that too, he thinks: he always did get a kick out of the finer details of humanity.
"Claire told me to research Friends with Benefits to see if Dean was mine."
"Sure. Thanks, kid."
“Hey, I think we can manage on our own for one night for the sake of some fun.”
Sam guffaws. “Oh come on, Dean. You’re seriously reading too much into it.”
"I’m sorry, Dean. I can see I’ve crossed a line you aren’t happy with. You're very attached to it, I wanted to experience how it feels holding it.”
“I can see sometimes that you.. cringe a little, when I bring up these topics. It’s never my intention to do that. When I ask about human customs or when I ask about you, it’s curiosity but that doesn’t mean it’s my place to know the answers. If you want me to stop talking about something or asking questions, please let me know.”
"Sorry, Dean."
"Yeah, no shit I care about him. He's family."
"I only intended to hold it, Dean." Sam snorts out a laugh. "What?"
"I'm gonna stay for a while if that's alright with you. I'll be quiet."
He rises back to his feet with the box in his hand and begins to spread the ashes, allowing several feet between each turn through his hands. When he’s finished he sits back down and it hits him in a wave, grief and shock and something else washing over him and filling him from the inside out.
“I can give you space to think about things if that’s what you want. I know I’ve put you in a difficult position.”
He fills the glass with water and returns to his space, doing the same pouring motion onto the grass.
"Oh yeah, and it was prom last week. Freddy took the new girl Sophie and they kissed and Jake saw them and then he left upset."
Cas has been gone for a while and fuck if Dean hasn't missed him.
There’s a frown of confusion on his face and in his voice that makes Dean feel a little guilty and he just about manages to push aside a little of his fuckery to respond. "No. Y'know - hey, kid, there's nothing wrong with it. Alright? Nobody should feel bad about it. It's just.. it's a big deal when you tell someone something like that. Jake probably was thinking a lot about how he'd tell his mom and what she'd say, so he was feeling a little emotional. People sometimes get upset when they come out."
He pulls the second glass from between his legs and tips it up diagonally, watching drops of the liquid land across the grass.
“Then what’s the problem? Is this about what happened last week?”
"Someone should tell him."
Dean can’t remember how many times he’s seen a windmill in real life, but he has to imagine it’s less than a handful. This one is dilapidated and old, wood splintering but bricks fair and sun-bleached. He stares up at the blades, illuminated by some far-off floodlights, wondering how it would look if they were turning.
"You're welcome."
No. Stop. Concentrate on the road. What are they talking about now?
“I mean, you know that I.” Dean stops again abruptly and jesus
? Jesus) then he could.. what? Do something about it? God, he feels nauseous again.
“Oh yeah, like that’s gonna happen.”
"I was saying to Sam, before. I think sometimes you play dumb on purpose."
“What?” Cas frowns. “That was a kind offer, if a little odd. Do you think it was suspicious? He’s human, but..”
“Ask him.”
Dean looks away from the man to Cas when he says this, and Cas looks more bashful than Dean can remember him. He doesn’t seem sure what to say, and so the man continues.
He knows Jack doesn't really care about the answer. It's just what Jack does - testing out new information he's learned. And he knows that Cas- well. He knows Cas.
Well. It’s making the things Dean tries to convince himself aren’t possible with an angel less possible to deny.
“I like them.” Cas says simply, a smile at once transparent and unreadable taking over his features.
"That important to you?"
“Right. That’s… right, sure. I get it. You could probably do with some more practice at some point, but I’d rather you didn’t do that on your own when we don’t know what we’re up against. Let’s just stick to what we know.”
“No. Just..” Dean hesitates and Cas’ eyes are burning on him again. “I don’t know. Nervous.”
Dean looks down the hill in front of him and listens to the stream behind him as it passes towards the brook. He forgot nature could be so loud.
"He told Mrs Pine what was happening and they kissed."
“Do you think that’s important? Length?” Sam is drunker than Dean realised as he chokes out the words to a stoic Cas.
Besides, Cas is his friend. His best friend. And it isn't like either of them are in a position to start risking those. They basically have each other and Sam.
Dean hates that he can feel his skin prickle with heat almost instantly. Of all the people for Jack to end up watching this episode with, it really had to be him.
Desperate tears are stinging his eyes and it’s a wonder he has any left, to be honest. He told himself he wasn’t going to when he did this. He manages to swallow these ones back inside as he listens to the birds again. The rustle of the trees in the distance.
"Maybe you should get it, Dean. You haven't exactly been drowning in dates lately."
"What're you looking for?"
in Cas’ voice that makes Dean smirk.
"I like watching movies with Sam. We watched one last week, in fact."
“Thanks.”
"And what would be the reasons someone might want to make you explain?"
"Look, I'm not saying give him a demonstration, I'm just saying you should be, y'know.. supportive. Give him basic advice when he asks for it. It's not like he's got anyone else he's interested in, is it?"
"But you've wanted to have them?"
"Can I ask you a question?"
male. He’s been around for thousands of years, and he’s doing ‘research’ about friends with benefits because when someone makes those references to him he sincerely has no idea what they mean. It makes Dean feel guilty, to see him the way he does sometimes knowing that. Cas doesn’t always know better.
