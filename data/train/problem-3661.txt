Dean sighs and covers his face with his hands briefly. “Why is this so hard?”
Dean hummed. “I like it.” He paused when Castiel started to reach under his shirt, damn near flinching when Castiel touched his stomach.
“And Zachariah and Naomi are the two douchebags who did this to you in the first place?”
Castiel finally sets down the last box against the wall. He looks around the apartment and lets out a long sigh. It’s going to take forever to unpack. The furnishings are bare and the kitchen is empty save for the appliances. The large windows look out on the city skyline and let in heaps of sunlight that spills across the floor.
Castiel raises a brow. “You’re going to call me buddy after that?”
Castiel stands up and sighs. “We’re going to have a lot of cleanup to do tomorrow.”
Dean carried the omelette upstairs along with a mug of coffee he made with the french press that Cas showed him how to use. He found Michael sitting on the edge of the bed in his work suit, blowing his nose and tossing the tissue into a little trash can. He took the food and coffee gratefully and started eating. He looked miserable, and his scent gave off that feeling too.
“Yeah, I’m okay. See you tonight.”
“Night, Cas.”
“Oh, it’s just the lingo for the restaurant. It’s on the menu.” Castiel picks the menu back up and points out the part about the hashbrowns to Dean.
“Our parents didn’t want to deal with us. That’s another story. I don’t want you to change who you are. I just think maybe you’d be happier. Look, I’m not too far away from you. In a car, Alton is about four hours away from Chicago. I could-”
Dean swallowed, debating on whether or not he should press further. It was pretty obvious that Castiel was unhappy, and Dean hated that for him. “Well, you have a right to be happy. I hope that happens for you.”
Dean smiled softly and nodded. “Of course.” He took his daughter’s hand and led her to the bathroom. She still didn’t really like the bath, but she didn’t put up a big fight anymore.
Gabriel sat on the edge of the bed. “You miss your brother?”
Michael kissed Dean’s forehead before leaving the room to grab his things. The tension between Castiel and Dean hovered in the air as they sat and picked at their food. Once the front door closed and locked, Castiel spoke.
Dean took his time cleaning up. He didn’t really feel like moving quickly when he was worried like this. By the time he had washed all of the dishes and cleaned the counters, nearly twenty minutes had passed and a strong scent punched Dean in the face. It was obviously Castiel, but it reeked of sadness and rejection. When Dean turned around, he saw the omega sulking over to the table. He was limping slightly, presumably from his activities with Luke. His usual confident stance was reduced to sagging shoulders and a dropped head.
“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” He shouts, gripping his own hair in his hands. Tears slip from his eyes and roll down his cheeks, wetting the blankets still covering his lower half. “Leave me alone! Please, please just shut up! Shut up!”
Castiel brings in a few more armfuls of things from his car. He puts his sheets and comforter on the bed, curtains on the curtain rod, and spreads out his toiletries in the bathroom. He sets out a few of his trinkets on his desk and plugs in his laptop.
Dean nodded. “Of course, yeah. Go get some rest. I’ll rest up too. Should I call your regular phone or the burner?”
Gabriel got home from work at his usual time, and Castiel wanted so badly to tell him what happened, to explain everything. Gabriel was probably the only one who could fix this now, but it was too risky. If Luke found out that Gabriel knew, surely the deal would be off, and Dean would get sent home. Instead, Castiel lied. He hated how good he was getting at it.
“Right, we should do that.” Castiel led the way back inside and up the stairs to Dean’s room. “Luke told me about what the plan is.”
Dr. Adler stands up, pushing the chair back in. “Not bad, per say, just not where it was before. Has something been going on?”
Dean chuckles. “I know you offered to pay, but I’ll get my own food. Consider it thanks for bringing me here.”
Cas smiles at Dean. “I should have known that you worked with cars by the way you spoke about your own car. Is that how you maintain such an old car? I imagine it’s not cheap.”
Dean nods nervously. “Maybe? The definition sounded right. I’m kind of new at this.”
“How come?”
After a few minutes, he decided to just try finding the family. He had a last name and a location. He found some names and addresses, but he was really after emails or phone numbers. Over and over, he came up with a news article from more than ten years ago. He skipped over it every time he saw it, until he saw Castiel’s name in a brief description. He clicked the article.
Dean nodded. “Okay.” He stared at the floor, brows furrowed slightly in confusion. Michael didn’t propose. Castiel said he was going to, and here they were, about to go home after several hours here and nothing happened.
Castiel gently takes the book and smiles. “Thank you. I actually thought about buying this book recently but I didn’t, so I’m glad you got it for me. I’ll let you know how I like it once I finish.”
Dean’s hand moved faster and faster as he chased the slowly building orgasm. His toes curled and he panted into Castiel’s neck, his teeth scraping the skin. He swore he heard the omega moan when he did that, but he was too distracted to acknowledge it. Dean gasped a few times, teetering right on the edge of orgasm. He wasn’t as frantic as yesterday with Castiel’s calming scent here, but he still couldn’t get off. He felt Cas’s hand leave his hair and move to his hip.
Dean yawns and checks his own phone. “I have a quiz in my 11:00 class today, so I have to get up. I didn’t study last night for this quiz, so I’m gonna have to cram for it on the bus.”
Dean sets Castiel down and smiles tiredly. “As much as I’d like to stay up and chat, I’m exhausted from the drive. You want to come sleep in my room?”
“Good, I’m glad to hear it.” Dean starts up the car and pulls out of the parking lot.
Castiel nodded in sympathy. “I’m sorry. I hope it passes quickly. Do you think you could handle some water? Maybe some crackers?”
Dean runs one hand through the feathers in front of him, eliciting a gasp from Castiel. “You seem more sensitive here.”
“Oh, getting cocky, are we?” Castiel put a soft hand on Dean’s shoulder, looking almost innocent. Suddenly, he pushed Dean onto his back and swung a leg over him, straddling his hips. “What made you think I wouldn’t still want to be on top?”
“Do you like it here?”
Dean nods. “Yeah, really close. Dad worked a lot, so it was just the two of us most of the time. Hell, I practically raised the kid until I went off to college. Half of the reason I went to college was so I could get a good job and provide more for him. He wants to go to Stanford of all places. He’s probably going to get heaps of scholarships, but he’ll still have loans. I want to help him pay for them.”
“Hey, um...I’m sorry about earlier. I’m just really stressed out, and this is a lot all at once so-”
“Good, now try to relax your thighs and let your body sink into the bed. Try to clear your head. I know that sounds hard, but just focus on the thought, ‘I am clearing my head’ and let everything else fade away. I’ll be right here.” The fingers in Dean’s ass gained a little bit of speed, ruthlessly going for his prostate.
Dean opened the car door and waved goodbye to his little brother. He took his small duffel of belongings out of the trunk before walking slowly into the airport. God, he hated flying. He had only ever done it once, and it was one of his worst memories.
Dean smiled brightly. “That’s awesome. I’m really happy for you.”
“Ooh, nice place.” Gabriel walked into the living room and saw Dean sitting on the couch, both kids playing on the living room floor. “Dean!”
“How was your pregnancy with Claire?”
“Proud of you, Dean.” Bobby chimed in.
Dean nodded and wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck. He felt like he might actually need to be carried right now because of his sore ass and thighs.
They stepped into the shower and scrubbed themselves clean of the sweat and grime. It was refreshing, and exactly what they needed to calm down. Dean shoved away every nagging thought about what just happened and replaced them with how happy he was to be with Castiel. There was no point in freaking out or moping. It was done and there was nothing they could do.
“Hm, we need to find a good hobby for you. You knit? Crochet? Cross Stitch?”
The cuddling lasted for about half an hour. Castiel spent the time either resting with his eyes closed or playing with Dean’s hair. Dean tried to rest and relax, but eventually, the discomfort started getting to him. He couldn’t stay still and the room felt stuffy. His head still felt pretty clear, so he was thinking coherently.
Castiel grins. “Awww, are you worried ‘bout me? That’s real sweet, Dean.” The drunker Castiel gets, the more southern he sounds. Despite being raised by parents from the Midwest with no southern accents, being raised in Georgia means he’s surrounded by the accent. He doesn’t have much of one himself, but parts of the sweet drawl start to peek through now that he’s drunk.
Castiel thinks about it briefly. His room is pretty messy at the moment, and he’s not sure he washed his sheets this week. “Maybe I should stay in your room. You’ve seen mine. I don’t think you’d want to stay in there.”
Castiel starts to walk to the bedroom door but he stops. He doesn’t want to bother Dean if he’s doing something by himself. He could be napping for all Castiel knows. He sighs and sits down on the couch, resigning himself to waiting for Dean to emerge from his bedroom.
Meg looks over at Castiel and her expression finally softens. She smiles at him fondly. “I know you do, Clarence.”
Dean was still processing when Luke came home. He looked over at the alpha and searched him for any faults, scrutinizing every detail. Jealousy changed a man.
“I told you to wait for me.”
As soon as Dean relaxed and tried to clear his mind like Cas said, everything got more intense. He closed his eyes and chewed his lower lip, biting back what would have been cries of Castiel’s name. Two minutes passed, and then Dean felt his orgasm building quickly in his stomach. “Shit, I’m close…”
“Is Castiel upstairs?” Gabriel asked, gesturing to the staircase.
He could go home, but the parade isn’t the only part of Pride. There’s an entire market to explore. Dean wants to walk around and check out what people have. He knows there’s art, apparel, and food.
“No, I don’t remember what her card said or anything.”
“Asshole.”
Dean sighed. “You’re right. I should do that.” He smiles. “Thanks, Cas.”
Dean holds a hand out. “Then let me help you. We’ll fight those douchebag angels together. They can’t make you into their perfect little soldier again.”
Cas hums his pleasure as he moves gracefully. “Is it because I’m a man, or is it because you’re not the one in charge?”
“My lips are sealed. Goodnight, Cassie.”
“You’re an ass.”
Castiel left, then came back with a cool, wet rag. He cleaned up the mess on Dean’s stomach and on the bed. He sat down and pulled Dean into his lap. “You did so good today, Dean, my good boy.”
A week after Gabriel left, it was nearly time for Castiel to start his heat. Dean knew it was coming, and he had a proposition.
Dean sighed and tried to relax for the car ride back to the house. He was happy to see Castiel waiting for them at the front door again. When he got out of the car, Castiel was immediately walking over to him.
Castiel shrugs. “Tough.”
Castiel closes the door and lets out a heavy sigh. He hears movement and turns around to see Dean poking his head out of the door, a concerned look on his face.
Castiel’s head tilts. “For what?”
The University of Georgia was Castiel’s number one school. It was where everyone in Georgia wanted to go, but it was extremely difficult to get in. Castiel had a hard time even with his 4.0 GPA and extremely high test scores. A large percentage of the students were actually transfer students from other colleges, since it was so much easier to transfer in. The school was located in Athens, a distinctly college town with a rich history surrounding the university. The town was small other than the college, but the downtown area was full of life every weekend. Sanford Stadium was packed almost every Saturday in the fall for football season.
Dean stuffs a handful of cheese crackers into his mouth. “Mmhm.”
Castiel laughs softly and closes his eyes briefly. “I don’t think things are ever going to be the same.”
Castiel looked shocked. His eyes were sparkling with tears as he listened to Dean. “You really don’t care about that?”
Castiel beams as he climbs into bed. He hugs Dean and kisses his forehead. “You’re so needy.”
“Hey. How was class and work?” Castiel pops another chip into his mouth.
Castiel wasn’t extremely vocal, but he had other ways of showing Dean how much he liked what was happening. He panted softly and shuddered when something felt especially good. Little moans were always muffled by a hand over his mouth or his teeth digging into his lower lip.
The break ends and Castiel and Dean are reunited in Athens. Now it’s crunch time. Finals are in two weeks and both of them need to study. Dates get put on hold and they spend more time in the library to focus on their schoolwork. Castiel has four papers to work on and Dean has exams to study for. One of Castiel’s classes has a long exam, which he’s a little scared of. Exams were never his forte like essays were.
“What’s that?”
“You okay?”
“There was a noise in the kitchen.” Dean looks back at Castiel.
Dean smiled up at Castiel the whole time, his brain still short-circuited. He couldn’t really think about much except for the other man curling up around him and spooning him from the back. About ten minutes passed before he really came back.
“I never formed any kind of bond with them. It was just sex when you weren’t enough for me. You went off and fell in love with my brother’s fiance.”
Dean tilts his head and approaches the bed. “Can I help? Seems like you wouldn’t be able to reach most of that,” Dean offers, his mouth moving faster than he’s thinking.
Castiel growled, and Luke chuckled.
“Cassie! You’re home!” Her long, grey hair flies behind her as she runs to hug her son.
“You had every right to. You felt rejected, and the feeling was amplified by your heat.”
Gabriel walks up, holding his arms out. “Guys and gals, watch the pro.” He stares down the cup, and tosses the ball. It hits the edge of the cup and falls off the side, hitting the table.
Castiel shrugged. “It’s been more than five years. I’m sure things have changed with both of us. We could start over. It would be weird to jump right back in. We could go on dates and take it slow. However you want to.”
Dean nods. “Very illegal in Kansas too. You can still find it, though.”
“Usually omegas scenting their alphas. The alpha I dated, when she went into rut, she smelled amazing.”
Castiel pouts. “Say it back.”
The silence that fell over them spoke volumes. They watched each other, the spark between them bursting into a small flame.
Dean held the back of Castiel’s neck to pull him closer. This didn’t feel like kissing an old lover, it felt like a first kiss. Everything felt new and exciting. There wasn’t an element of fear. He no longer had to think about someone else finding out about them. Instead, he was just excited to be with Castiel and to feel that spark burst into flames.
“Oh, you’re right. Well, where should we go?”
Luke tormented Castiel while they were alone for the next two months. Luke was never physical or extremely aggressive with Castiel, who knew it was probably because he had a couple inches on the alpha. He was all lean muscle and could probably take the alpha down if necessary. Still, every day Luke would have some new comment about how Castiel was desperate for Dean. It got worse when Castiel accidentally blurted out the other omega’s name during sex one evening.
“Do you want to stay over here for a few minutes? Everyone here knows you’re with me, they won’t bother you. I’m somewhat obligated to socialize with the top players here, so I have to mingle around some more. I know it’s a big space but it’s all open, so hopefully, you can find me if you need anything.”
Dean glanced back at Michael. Damn, he was more ripped than Dean thought. He was attractive, there was no doubt about it.
Dean holds out a hand and claps it together with Castiel’s, grinning from ear to ear.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel and held him against his chest. “Okay. Just relax and try to rest.”
“And I love you, Castiel Novak, the former angel. My angel.” Dean kisses Castiel sweetly and wraps an arm around him, pulling him against his chest and holding him like a precious treasure.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I got it for a great price, and it works just fine.” He walked out of the garage and got into his car.
The next day was harder than Dean thought it would be. He started to worry that he had caught the bug that Michael had, because he felt tired and achy. Despite this, he still wanted to go with Sam to the airport. His flight was after lunch, so they planned to leave late in the morning and pick up food on the way. Michael had approved this outing for Dean, which was a relief for everyone involved.
Dean craned his neck to try and look up. He finally saw the face of the man and knew exactly who he was. He was Castiel’s long-time friend and from what Dean knew, BDSM mentor, Victor. He waved a bit with one of his cuffed hands.
Dean sat up and stretched. “You’re not coming with me?”
Dean’s eyes widened. “Sorry, but how are you going to afford all of this?”
“It’s okay, the bedspread isn’t going to rip from you sitting on it.” He wrapped an arm around Dean and leaned in to scent him. “Your suppressants are definitely wearing off. Your scent is much more prominent today.”
“That’s a little creepy.”
Castiel’s eyes were wide when Dean finally touched him. He reached down to hold one of Dean’s thighs, eyes locked on the omega. “Holy shit, Dean…”
“Fuck…” Castiel breathed out, his head falling back.
“No, I get it. You were protecting yourselves. I’m glad both of you are out of there.”
“Is that why your roommate looks like a tomato?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah.”
“I know for a fact that you like to be manhandled and teased. Am I wrong?”
“My parents couldn’t even look at me or Jimmy after what happened.” Castiel saw some confusion on Dean’s face. “Jimmy is my identical twin. He’s five minutes younger than me, hence why I’ve referred to him as my younger brother.”
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “Yeah, whoops.”
Dean chuckles. “Close. It’s Sammy.”
Dean nods. “Yeah, I do. It’s a pretty nifty service. I’ve noticed that you ride a bike every day. Is that easier?”
Dean leaves to get in the driver’s seat, a little more swagger in his step. He seems happy.
Gabriel opens his pantry and starts pulling out food item after food item. He fills a bowl with chips, sets out Chex Mix, crackers and cheese. “Get some food in your system, Cas. I bought you alcohol.”
Castiel listens and looks away. “I don’t want to give up my life.”
“Oh good, it’s you. I thought you were Jack for a second there.”
Castiel slowly packed the things he wanted to keep as the wedding approached. He packed keepsakes and little trinkets he had collected. He kept trying to find a way to access his personal funds, at least enough to get an apartment, but it was impossible. The account was in Luke’s name, and Castiel couldn’t even get to an ATM to take cash withdrawals. Luke had promised him enough money to get by, but Castiel had no idea how much that would be. It would be either way too much or way too little. All he could do was hope Luke was feeling generous.
Dean nodded. “You’re right. We can plan something after we’ve had our break.”
As soon as the little ding signaled that it was okay to stand up, Dean rose to his feet and grabbed his small duffel from under the seat in front of him. When the alpha didn’t stand up, Dean slid in front of him, their legs bumping together somewhat painfully. Dean was the first off the plane, much to his relief. He walked quickly through the airport and out to where there were people standing with signs. There were some ‘welcome home’ signs and some with names. One had Dean’s name on it. It was being held by a shorter man with a lollipop stick hanging out of his mouth. When they made eye contact, the man grinned.
Dean nods. “Yup. It’ll be a good trip. I’ll probably take Sammy on a short road trip around the area before Christmas. I’m coming back the day before New Years Eve for Gabriel’s party.”
Dean grins. “Only if I can pick.”
“You can’t tell Dean that I know. I’ll know if you do. He’s finally somewhat comfortable around me. I’ll be able to tell if he suddenly isn’t anymore. For a guy with a tough exterior, he wears his heart on his sleeve. I already know you’re good at keeping secrets. One more won’t hurt.”
Meg raises her brows in question. “And...?”
“Did Cas get in trouble yesterday? After he came here?”
Castiel nods and continues driving. “Were you two close growing up?”
The moment the door opened, Dean was flying around the corner to see if it was Sam. He beamed when he saw his lanky younger brother carrying a duffel bag into the house, wide-eyed and staring at everything but Dean.
Castiel stares with wide eyes. “So every scary monster you read about is real?”
“I’ll just start with the big one, you’re out of here after the wedding. We’ll frame it as if you’re the one who left. I’ll give you enough so you don’t starve, but don’t expect any favors. You betrayed me, Castiel.”
“I’m Dean, I’m one of the detectives here.”
Castiel hugged Dean close. “I know. Thank you.”
Cas took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. “Still, there’s a chance.” He sighed and shook his head. “You know what? No, we’re not going to worry about this right now. There’s nothing we can do. We did what we wanted to. We shouldn’t repeat this particular arrangement, but we can do anything else. This is supposed to be our last hurrah, so let’s try not to worry about anything else right now.”
“What do you mean by that?”
Dean frowned. “No, we’re not. Not unless that’s what you want.”
The door cracked open and Castiel’s head poked in. “Hey, I saw Michael dump you in here. I just wanted to check on you. I’ll be bringing you food and water during your heat. Is there anything I can get you now?”
“Jesus fucking Christ! What time did you get here?!”
Castiel shudders and feels his body growing weaker. When Michael steps back, Castiel nearly falls to the ground. He’s caught by Dean.
Castiel looks out at the buildings in front of them and closes his eyes to feel the breeze on his face. “You have too. That internship is going to be great.”
Dean thought for a moment. “I’d give a lot to just lay in bed with you and enjoy your company.”
Once the door was closed, Michael immediately turned to Dean. “Are you okay?”
Castiel’s eyes widen. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Have you gone out to explore the city yet?”
Dean hums. “You’re a funny guy. I was a little nervous before we met that I’d get stuck with someone I didn’t like, but I really like you.”
Castiel huffed and took it upon himself to make sure Dean was alright. When he did, he realized this heat would be trickier than he thought. He had heard of PCOS before, but didn’t know enough about it or how severe Dean’s case was.
Castiel smiles. “I had to. It’s part of the culture here.” The waitress returns to ask them how the check is split, and Castiel answers that it’s separate. She writes down a few things on her notepad and leaves two yellow slips of paper on the table.
Dean looked at Castiel. “Can’t angels do that memory thing? Where you look through someone’s thoughts? Have you tried that on him?”
They went slow, despite how desperate they were. Everything felt bigger and more intense the longer Castiel slowly rolled against Dean’s hips. Dean’s world felt smaller and smaller, reduced down to only to himself and Cas.
Dean moves his arm around Castiel’s chest and stands him up. “I think I need to get Cas to bed. Is everyone else ready to go?”
Castiel looked at Jack, and his face softened. “You should finish eating. We can talk more after dinner.”
Dean laughs. “No offense, but I can so picture teenage-you doing that.”
Claire huffed and crawled back under the bed. “Please don’t let Mikey yell at me.”
Castiel feels a pit in his stomach form. “No, he didn’t do anything! Please, just leave him out of this!”
Dean blinked in surprise, but in all honesty, he was relieved. After Castiel dropped that bomb on him, he didn’t really want to spend his heats with him. He nodded and smiled softly.
Castiel felt for Kelly and promised to help her in any way he could. She had a hard pregnancy, and she lived alone. Castiel went to her house after class and work just to keep her company. They became good friends, and Castiel grew attached to her unborn son. Kelly even asked Castiel to be his godfather.
“I know. You can call it off at any point. You’re doing great so far.”
“Not much. Our scent profiles are supposed to match, he lives in Chicago with his two brothers, he’s got dark hair, blue eyes, about my height, I think.”
The next day passed the same way as the first. Dean spent a little more time to himself to read or draw. He had picked up sketching a few years ago when he ran out of hobbies.
Dean retreated into the kitchen to start cooking. What had his life become? It used to be so simple. As he was working, his phone rang. Sure enough, it was Sam.
Castiel frowns. “No, I think my choice is obvious. I’m not going back to the life I had before I rebelled.” He looks at Michael. “Take my grace. I don’t want it.”
Castiel led them back to one of the couches and sat down with Dean curled up in his lap. “How do you feel?”
Castiel nodded with a soft smile. He looked at Dean for a moment and back at his papers, then back at Dean. “I have a question. If it’s too personal, you don’t have to answer.”
Castiel and Dean leave at midnight. Dean only had a few drinks and is already sobering up, but they had come in Castiel’s car, and there’s no way he’s getting behind the wheel of that car.
Dean nodded. “Okay, that’s fair.”
“We considered staying together, even after that. I wanted to be there for Ben. To me, he was still my kid. Eventually, she decided that she wanted to be with Ben’s biological dad, who stepped into the picture and wanted to be a dad. It tore me apart, man. I lost my girlfriend, who I planned on marrying, and my kid at the same time. I was going to still be in his life, but I screwed it all up.” Dean leans forward and buries his face in his hands.
Castiel was quiet for a minute, staring at his papers. “Do you feel it too?”
Castiel nods and hangs on to Dean. “I’m not crazy! Please, please don’t let go.” Castiel’s grip on Dean’s hands tightens even more. “I feel like I’m drowning. I’m going under and nothing is going to be able to pull me out.”
“No problem. Hopefully, I don’t see you in here for the same reason next month. Take care of yourself.”
Castiel raised a brow. “Who?”
“What? Why? What’s wrong?”
“Sweet.” Dean walks over to the couch and plops himself down, taking a large bite out of his sandwich.
“What?”
He found some peace with his cooking. It was quiet now, and he could hear the birds at the bird feeder outside. As much as seeing Castiel with Luke hurt, he had to stick to their agreement from yesterday: completely platonic.
“Hunters usually have nothing to lose. They’re old men and women with hardened lives that make them leave peace behind. They’re good at what they do. I had a chance at a different life, one that makes me happy, and I took it. I only hunted for two years of my life, from the age of fifteen to seventeen, but those two years changed me. I’ve seen more than anyone should ever see. I couldn’t save everyone, no matter how hard I tried. If you take on a life like that, you won’t be able to save everyone. People are going to die in your hands, and it’ll stick with you forever. You’re such a happy person, Castiel. You’re throwing that away when you take that responsibility. I won’t be around to watch that happen. My heart can’t take it.” Dean wipes at his eyes. “You mean too much to me for me to watch you harden into someone else.”
Dean’s jaw dropped. “Is it Kali? Please tell me it’s her.”
“You said that you would have known about a Nephilim being born, since they’re so powerful. Why do you think you didn’t sense it?”
Dean sips his coffee, and in the silence of the bunker, there’s a noise. It’s a knock on the door. Dean closes the book in front of him and walks up the stairs to the door. He looks through the peephole and spots a very tired looking Castiel. He opens the door for him and tilts his head in confusion.
“Yeah, I’m good. Just tired.”
Dean started working on some eggs and bacon. “I’m well aware of that.” He hummed. “Is he up yet?”
His heats were just like any other omega’s heats, only with the addition of a knot. It wasn’t easy to manage, but it was doable. His heats only lasted about three days, which was such a relief, given how uncomfortable they were. Sometimes Luke would come in and ask if they could have heat sex, but Castiel always turned him down. He spent five years on the streets terrified of people taking advantage of him during his heat. He only felt safe if he was alone. He still needed people to check on him, and he trusted Gabriel to keep from touching him, so he was allowed in if needed.
Castiel washed himself with a little help from Dean, who turned around to face him. It was times like this when they were grateful for the large tub.
“I am.”
“You okay, Sammy?”
Meg’s lips curl up into a cheshire grin. “Atta boy, Clarence.” She slaps her hands against her thighs and stands up. “Now let’s go get my car.”
Dean drew in a short breath. He could still get some air in, but it was restricted. His body did it’s best to let out small noises as he waited for Castiel to let go again. He gasped in a breath once he did. “Fucking hell…” He knew he was dripping precome, and that he was going to come again if this continued.
Castiel was called to the hospital early one morning, and he had a bad feeling about why. When he arrived, he was informed that Kelly had died in childbirth. With the hard pregnancy, she had already made her will, just in case. In it, she stated that Castiel would be awarded custody of her son, Jack, if she were to pass away. In one day, Castiel lost a good friend and became a dad.
“Thanks, Gabe.” Dean hugged him back and patted him on the back.
Dean drums his fingers on the counter and sighs. “You’re right. You’re one hundred percent right.” He sighs and drags a hand over his face. “I just can’t shake the fear.”
“Well, you did just stop suppressants and have your first heat in years. Your hormones are probably all over the place. It’s okay, I get pretty hormonal during my heats, hence why I was so grumpy when you saw me yesterday.” Castiel ate the last of his bacon. “Let’s just put it behind us. I’ll introduce you to my houseplants.”
Dean was dropped on his bed and left alone in the room with nothing but a paper bag full of fake knots and lube to satisfy him. Dean clutched his stomach from the pain of the cramps. He groaned and peeled his clothes off for some kind of relief, only to find none. His head was spinning, sweat was pouring down his body, and everything hurt. When there was a knock at the door, Dean quickly pulled a sheet over himself. “H-hello?”
“Because you need me to be. Truthfully, I’m as scared as you are. I don’t want this to mean what you think it means. But, I have hope. Our bond is too strong to just wither and fade. I think it would take a lot more than getting bored to bring us apart, don’t you think?”
“Dean, it’s just me. Nothing’s happening.” Castiel keeps his voice low and calm, watching Dean carefully.
“I would be. If he’s as bright as Michael describes him as, then one day I could help him land a position with the legal team for Milton Consulting.”
Castiel shifts. “Well, I’m not sure I’m going anywhere. I don’t want to leave my life behind.”
The voices start to quiet down, making it easier for Castiel to speak. “It starts with ringing in my ears, and then I hear voices. They’re demanding that I come home, or that I come to them. They shout my name over and over. It comes and goes. It gets loud sometimes, and sometimes they just whisper.”
“That’s alright, buddy. You like hanging out with your dad?”
“First aid kit. I know it’s in here…”
Dean loved his relationship with Castiel. Things were moving at a good pace and they were happy. Lately, they had been doing kink related activities almost every day. They were growing in their practice of it, and it was fun.
Dean meets Cas’s gaze, and that’s it for him. He cries out as his orgasm rolls over him like a tidal wave, making every muscle in his body tense and then release.
Dean got into Baby, double checking that the garage was closed as he drove away. Part of him was nervous about leaving Jack alone in his house all day, but the kid seemed nervous and relatively harmless.
Castiel huffs. “Why don’t you just kill me? Why am I worth all of this trouble?”
Castiel was curled up in their bed, facing away from Dean, and crying into a pillow. Dean had seen Castiel get sniffly a few times during a movie, and he cried that one time when reliving his trauma, but this was on a new level. Castiel was choking and coughing as he cried. It was heartbreaking to see.
Castiel shrugs. “I don’t know if it’s necessarily easier, but I need the exercise, so I do it.”
Castiel stares at Dean, wishing they weren’t in a public place so that he could pounce on Dean and kiss him to his heart’s desire. Instead, he reaches across the table and takes Dean’s hand, squeezing it. Dean squeezes back and they exchange a knowing look.
“Both?”
“How do you feel about going home?”
Castiel frowned and gestured for Dean to come closer. “It’s going to be alright. Everything is already packed, we’re going to leave straight from here. We’ll nearly be out of the state by the time Michael gets home.”
“He could have died, Michael. I was trying to protect him.”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, sure.” He stood up and followed Michael upstairs. Dean glanced back at the other side of the hall and saw Luke’s door open with the light’s off, and Castiel’s door closed, the lights shining through the bottom of the door. He forced himself to turn away and walked into Michael’s bedroom. He sat on the bed and yawned softly. It was only 8pm, but he was tired. Snuggling up to someone sounded nice. Michael was a good cuddler.
Dean starts to feel a little awkward as he stands there stationary. He starts to listen to the music and finds himself enjoying it. Slowly, parts of his body start to move to it. His head bobs, then his shoulders move back and forth.
Michael nodded, sighing heavily as he took his suit coat off. “Very. One of our new middle management men is a pain to deal with, and his new office is now just across the hall from mine. I can hear him shouting about nothing even with the door closed. He complains about everything and everyone. Any time an employee makes a minor slip up, he’s in my office ranting about them. If it were up to me, he’d be out the door.”
“I am so sorry, Dean. I should have just waited until the end of your heat at the very least-”
Castiel sat down in one of the other chairs. “You eat?”
Castiel raises his brows. “Kind of, yeah.”
Four months after Dean left Chicago, nearly to the day, it was over. He was divorced and free.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, guess so. Oh, um...I just wanted to let you know that if I stop my suppressants I’ll start a heat within a week.”
“I’m what?”
Dean put the first-aid-kit back into the cabinet. “Alright. If you’re okay with it, I’ll stay with you.”
“Was everything okay outside? Is Cas still here?”
Dean hummed. “Sore and horny.”
Castiel nodded and took Jack out of the swing, following him to the sandbox.
“Huh.” Dean thinks for a moment. “If you had to solve me, what would you say?”
Dean helped Michael into bed and noticed he had brought a bag of takeout food from a local deli, so he had his dinner all set. Once Michael was relaxed in bed, he told Dean to go spend time with Sam.
“Uh, I don’t know. Just check in on her, see how she’s doing. Tell her that you’re okay.”
Castiel eats lunch with Charlie at a barbeque restaurant that they both adore. He bikes home afterwards and crashes on his bed for an afternoon nap.
When they arrived at the house, Jimmy was in the living room with Jack, helping him build with blocks. Dean took Claire upstairs to take a short nap, tucking her into bed. He walked back downstairs and went to sit on the porch. He needed fresh air and time to calm down and think.
“Only every other day!”
I worked for Bobby, fixing up cars. It was a good job. I barely graduated high school, but I finished. I worked as many hours as I could to try to save up for Sam’s college. When I realized that fixing cars wasn’t nearly enough, I started looking for other options. Another job wasn’t enough. I couldn’t afford to send myself to school. This was a last ditch effort. So yeah. That’s my life.”
Dean shakes his head. “I’ll stay up with you. Do you want it to be quiet or do you want me to turn on Netflix?”
Dean doesn’t speak. His face is a mixture of terrified and heartbroken. He looks away and wraps his arms around himself.
Castiel didn’t speak for a few seconds, but he looked like he was seeing something horrific. He let go of the wall. “We...we don’t need to look for a Nephilim. It was Jack.”
He called Michael to ask if he could get Dean to a doctor.
“I can’t help but disagree. Have you talked to him about last night?”
“No, I always hid it under the bed when I knew you were coming in here. I didn’t want you to find it and freak out.”
Once they’re clean, Castiel lays back down on the bed, staring up at the ceiling with a pleased look on his face. He crosses his arms behind his head and his knuckles brush against something hard underneath the pillow. He furrows his brows and sits up, lifting the pillow to investigate. Underneath the pillow lies a handgun with an ivory handle. Castiel gasps and backs up from it.
Dean looks away. “You know, that’s what I thought I was doing when I was hunting. I did save a lot of people. There are people that are alive now because of me. But it’s a power trip. I was killing things left and right because I deemed it just. No one should have that kind of power, not even for good. Also, I would have died an early death. I risked my life every day I hunted. Every time I went out there, that could have been the end. I had some close calls too. I know there was good in what I was doing, but I had enough of the self-sacrificial bullshit. Even at seventeen, I knew I needed to stop. You’re about to sacrifice your own happiness for a job that isn’t yours.”
Dean wasn’t able to sleep for the entirety of the flight. His heart was pounding and his breathing was shallow the whole time. He shoved his anxiety down and kept himself from spiraling into full-blown panic. His breathing finally slowed down when the plane touched down. He anxiously waited for his chance to get off the plane and away from the alpha next to him.
Castiel gently pulled Dean off the wall and started taking him to the bed. “I can’t believe I finally get to have you.”
“Really?” Dean tilts his head. “Not that that’s a bad thing. I just assumed you had at least hooked up with someone before. You told me that you had kissed people before and only told me one story about how you kissed a girl and ran away.”
“You can touch me if you want.” Castiel offered, seemingly reading Dean’s mind.
“Morning, Dean. You ready?”
Castiel smiles. “That will be nice. My room is pretty private at my house. When I’m at my grandparent’s house with my cousins I’ll probably have to share a room, but it’s a big house. I can find somewhere private.”
Dean nearly ran to the bathroom and closed the door. He felt choked, trapped, maybe even suffocated. Dean had his fair share of hookups in his time, but this was different, and so much more volatile. That didn’t feel like a hookup. It felt like something more, and it scared Dean more than anything had in years.
Dean looked at the bed and saw that his bedspread was gone, and all that was left was white sheets and a simple grey blanket. “Oh, thanks. That’s really nice of you.” Dean paused. “Before we even talk about this, you had a choice about this, right? No one is making you help me?”
Castiel lets out a resigned sigh, tears rolling down his cheeks. “Fine. Make me an angel again.”
Dean picked his head up to look. Sure enough, there was a long line down Castiel’s right wing. “Damn. That sucks.”
“Is that why your name is Castiel? I googled it, out of curiosity, and saw that it was biblical.”
“Knock it off, you two! Mikey, he’s here.”
“I don’t need your permission for shit, Mikey.”
Dean took several deep breaths and tried to keep his body relaxed. He started to feel some mild cramping, but a deep inhale of Castiel’s scent seemed to quell them. As the minutes passed, the room grew hotter and Dean felt slick leaking. He squirmed and whimpered, finding one of Castiel’s hands and holding it tightly. “C-Cas…”
Castiel lets go of one of Dean’s hands and follows him out of his own room. He rubs his eyes and sighs. A big weight is off of his shoulders now. He knows it’ll feel even better tomorrow when he talks to Meg about all of this. She’s his best friend and always has good advice.
Dinner was eaten while everyone chatted quietly. Sam was the first to finish, as per usual. That kid was a bottomless pit. Castiel went upstairs to bed first, wishing everyone a good night. Gabriel decided to turn in early as well, mentioning something about a show he wanted to binge for a while tonight.
“Nice.” Dean followed Castiel as he started walking back inside. As he walked up the back steps, he suddenly felt a little woozy and started to sway. “I think I’m gonna go lay back down.”
Dean nodded. “Let’s get out of here, then. I don’t want to spend another second in Chicago.”
His classes are pretty close together, so he doesn’t have to go back and forth from the house to campus. He takes his bike out of the trunk of his car and rides it to his first class at 8am. It’s in one of the massive lecture halls, which aren’t his favorite, but he’s willing to tolerate them.
“Damn, you beat me to it.”
“Alright,” Castiel chuckles as he walks back to his room. His phone buzzes in his pocket, so he pulls it out to check it.
Castiel smiles softly and nods. “He’s dead.”
“We talked some. He was really calm about it. He was actually really sweet last night. I woke up and he had tucked me into bed, taken my shoes off, and closed my curtains. He woke me up at eleven thirty and made breakfast for me.” Castiel stares at the floor while he talks, his lips crooking up into a smile.
Hours pass as Castiel ponders what to do. As much as he wants to keep his current life, something is pulling him to ditch everything and become an angel. He even has a thought. What if he does become an angel and he keeps his current life? He could still be with Dean and live out his career dreams while doing angel stuff with Gabriel.
“My little brother, Sammy, he misses me a lot. We’ve never been apart before. He called me this morning, and asked if he could come to visit sometime soon. Is that something he could do?”
“It’s Sam. Bye, Dean.”
Castiel nodded. “Yes. I didn’t want to, but I didn’t have a choice. I felt so horrible about how I handled that. I put you at risk and upset you.”
Dean pulls out of the driveway. “Alright, wise guy. Which way?”
When Dean got back, he completely ignored Castiel, which only made him feel worse. Castiel knew deep down it might be easier to keep this deal if Dean hated him. It would make his departure much easier, that’s for sure. But, a selfish part of Castiel desperately wanted to keep his friend.
Dean blushes a bit and looks away. “You ol’ sap.” He smiles and meets Castiel’s eyes. “I’m proud of us. I’m proud of you. You’ve come a long way.”
“I can walk to my apartment from here.”
Castiel thinks for a moment. “I guess I never really considered it before now. I’ve never been interested in hook-ups or anything like that, and I’ve never been in a serious relationship, so I guess I wouldn’t have known until now. Huh. I learned something new about myself.”
Dean sighs. “God, I can’t even think about a hot shower right now. I’m taking a cold one.”
Cas grabs his other hand and turns Dean to face him so that they’re dancing together. Both of them have smiles plastered onto their faces as they laugh and jump around.
At about one am, the voices come back with a vengeance. They sound angry this time, screaming at Castiel to come back to them or he’ll pay the price. Castiel shoots up and holds his head, eyes wide and body tense. He rocks back and forth, willing the voices to go away. Tears well up in his eyes and he can’t take it anymore.
Dean looked around the room, trying to spot Castiel. He hadn’t spoken to him all day, and he wanted to see his best friend. He stayed near Michael, who was talking to several members of his family, but kept an eye out for Castiel.
Castiel stepped out of the shower as well. “What do you think it would have been like if we met under different circumstances? Like...I worked at Gabriel’s bakery and you came in every Tuesday for coffee and a croissant. I’d stare at you for too long, you’d notice and stare back. One day I write my number on your napkin. We go out for dinner every Saturday. We move into a little townhouse and make a massive garden in the backyard. Bliss.”
Castiel shook his head vehemently. “No, not at all. I don’t think they ever forgave me, but it was four years after that happened that I ended up on the streets.”
Castiel tilts his head. “Did your dad have a traveling job?”
“What about Gabriel?”
“Right, you don’t know exactly who we are. My father is the CEO Milton Consulting. I didn’t disclose my name when we matched to avoid a bias based on my family. We can certainly afford to fund your brother’s education, and I’d be happy to. I do want to make you happy, Dean. If I can remove that stressor from your life, I will.”
“You didn't know about the collar kink, or the choking, did you?”
“I’m fine. I think I just need some fresh air.”
Dean nodded quickly. “Definitely keep that idea on the back burner, because I’m going to lose my mind just wearing this one.”
Dean stretches and looks away. “Well, you weren’t ‘you’ anymore. It wasn’t the sweet Castiel I knew, it was someone else. You seemed so old. You didn’t talk like you used to, you weren’t moving the same way, and you killed an angel. The Cas I know carries bugs outside because he doesn’t want to hurt them.”
“I’m craving WaHo, I’ll be back in a bit.” Castiel grabs his wallet.
Castiel stares at Dean with wide eyes. “You’re being serious?”
I’m throwing another party this weekend. The usuals are coming. You game?
Castiel tries to pull Dean back down. “It’s an older house. It makes noises sometimes. It’s nothing. Go back to sleep.” He glances at the clock. “It’s three am.”
Dean shook his head. “No, nothing’s wrong…Here, let me just explain how I found this. Can I come in?”
Dean blushed at that comment and hid a smile. The cold water was starting to actually feel good against his burning skin. “It’s been a long time since I’ve had a heat. This sucks.”
Castiel blushed and smiled softly. “Thank you. I appreciate that.”
Claire brought down several stuffed animals and sat on the floor of the sunroom, acting out a scene between her teddy bear and stuffed giraffe. Dean opened up a new mystery novel and started reading on the couch. He loved quiet moments like this with Claire. He could watch her play for hours.
“Hey, Jody.”
“How so?”
Dean shook his head again. “No.”
Castiel nodded, his solemn face turning into a soft smile.
“Good morning. Did you sleep alright?”
The parade was being held in downtown St. Louis. Castiel and Dean met Jimmy in a parking deck. Jimmy went all out for Pride every year. He had on a rainbow crop top and was covered in glitter.
“You’d let me drive your car?”
Zachariah grins. “We will, for a price.”
“I’m buying sunscreen tomorrow.” Dean walks over to the couch and plops down next to Castiel, leaning back against the cushions.
“Better?”
Dean nodded quickly. “Uh huh! Ah! C-come on, fuck me harder.”
“Uh, eight years? Since I was fifteen.”
Dean nodded quickly. “Anything, I’ll do anything.”
Castiel looked at Jack. “We keep Jack hidden. Nephilims are extremely dangerous. And, we find it. We have to kill it, wherever it is. We should also try to find out if there are more humans, so we can keep them safe. If there’s enough of them, we could end up bringing them back.”
Castiel holds out the bag of chips to Dean, smiling a bit when he takes one. “I’m glad everything worked out. Did you get a text from Gabriel about Friday?”
“I’ll try.”
“I’ll be honest, you guys were pretty good at keeping that secret. I knew there was chemistry there, but I didn’t know that you were acting on it. I probably should have paid more attention.”
“Do you know anything about him?” Sam finally pulled his head out of his book.
Gabriel flipped Michael off and stayed in the chair with his arms crossed. “I protected your future husband and mate. Get your head out of your ass.”
Dean drew in a deep breath through his nose. He still remembered Castiel’s scent like he smelled it just yesterday. “Hey, there’s no need to be jealous. I don’t like Jimmy that way.”
“Oh. Thanks.”
Dean nodded. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about this part of my health.”
“He’s going to get himself killed.”
Castiel wrapped an arm around Dean. “As for our relationship, we’re just letting it progress naturally. Between school and the kids, we’re pretty busy, so we take any time we can get together.”
Michael nodded and yawned. “Alright. I’m going to get ready for bed.”
“Succulents can actually be pretty tricky. How much did you water it?”
Late that night, his door opens without a knock. He opens his eyes and sees Dean walking in. He has a bag in one hand, a mug in the other, and his quilt draped over his shoulder.
He finally finds a clearing in the crowd at the top of the street. He stands at the guard rails and looks at the empty road, which will soon be filled with floats and people.
“I thought that’s what you wanted.” Castiel teased, kissing Dean’s nose.
“I won’t. We’ll come back by then and go over what we found. Hopefully we can at least get a few leads.”
“I’m not saying you should force him.” Meg smiles warmly. It’s a smile that Castiel rarely sees from her and it usually means that she’s being incredibly sincere. “I’m just saying that you need to talk more about your feelings for him. If he’s truly not ready, then that’s the end of the conversation. You can try again later. But, maybe he is ready and he’s just scared. You have to be the strong one and talk to him about it.”
“It’s Sam, and I know, but you did this to get money for Stanford. I didn’t expect you to actually...like the person you were stuck with.” Sam paused for a little bit, letting the information sink in. “So what do you do during the day except lay around?”
Dean slumped and sighed. “She’s sweet, but it just didn’t work. We fought a lot. Also, we need the money. Sammy, the amount I’ll be getting paid yearly is double what you need for Stanford. We can build a big savings pool for you, and you’ll be set for life.”
“Any siblings?”
Around 10:30, Dean was happy to see Castiel walking into the sunroom with a mug of tea. He looked much more well-rested than he had in the past few days. Sam asked Castiel about the plants, which lead to a very long conversation about all of their names and care. Cas was especially happy that his dramatic fittonia, Fernanda, was flowering. There were four long stems with dainty white flowers on the end poking through the leaves.
“No more.” Dean’s heart always melted when Claire smiled like that. It didn’t happen at all when Michael was in the house. Truthfully, Claire was scared of him. Whenever she got too loud or rowdy, Michael would shout at her until she was quiet. Dean hated it when he did that and tried to stand up for Claire, but he got shut down every time.
Dean nodded and leaned against the wall, letting his eyes move around the room as Michael walked away. He thought about taking out his phone to text Sam, but that seemed rude right now. He stared at his shoes and tapped the sole of one against the chestnut-colored hardwood floors. These shoes probably cost more than everything he brought to Chicago.
Somehow, Dean’s face gets redder. “Uh, I don’t know?”
Castiel takes the burger and gives a tiny smile. “You know me too well.” He unwraps the paper and takes a large bite from the burger. He hasn’t realized how hungry he is until now. He eats in silence and looks at Dean. His expression is nervous, as is his body language. He’s shifting and picking at his own fingernails. Castiel realizes how this must feel to Dean. “I should probably say that this has nothing to do with you, nor do I want it to affect our relationship. I’m just having a hard time right now.”
Bobby nodded. “Take a deep breath. It’ll be easy once you’re there. C’mon now.”
It’s strange seeing everyone like this. They all seem so happy to be surrounded by their peers. It makes Dean nervous. In fact, he’s still in the closet. He doesn’t even know where he falls under the queer umbrella. It’s all so confusing. Part of him wondered if coming to Pride would help him to understand more, but seeing all of the different flags and colors just makes him wonder what it all means.
With that freedom, Dean grabs Cas’s hips and thrusts his hips up as he pulls Cas down. The added force makes both of them gasp. Cas grabs Dean’s arm with one hand while he strokes himself with the other.
Dean nodded and kissed Castiel’s cheek. “I’m ready if you are.” He gasped softly as Cas lowered himself, tight heat surrounding his cock. “Shit, you feel good.”
The man seems to notice him lingering on that page and unclips a bisexual flag from his bag. He attaches it to a little stick and holds it out to Dean. “Is this the one you want?”
Dean stood up off the wall. “I’ll come with you.”
“That’s okay. We’ll be there before you know it.”
“Yes, it was that bad. I wouldn’t have done this if it wasn’t bad.” Castiel wished he could stay in the room with Dean, but the hospital insisted on only one person at a time.
Dean did the same to Castiel, unbuttoning his pants and pulling them down and off. He ran his hands along Castiel’s thighs, squeezing the hard muscles underneath the skin. He let his fingers dance along Castiel’s stomach until they reached the hem of his boxers. He pulled them down, humming in satisfaction when Castiel moved his legs around to help Dean get them off. He took off his own boxers and tossed them aside.
Dean holds him close. “I know. I’ve got you.”
Dean uses one hand to stroke the feathers of Castiel’s wing and uses the other to cup the back of his neck. Their foreheads touch and their eyes are closed. The world is small again, reducing down to just the pair of them.
Dean gently strokes Castiel’s hair and closes his eyes. “We’re safe.”
Castiel walks up to Dean and throws his arms around him. “I’m sorry this is happening.”
Dean shakes his head. “No.” He rubs his hand over his face. “You deserve the truth. The whole truth. You already know part of my motivation to leave Kansas, to get away from my past with Lisa. There’s another part: my dad. He lives in Lawrence right now, at least I think he’s still there. What I’m doing now, going to school, this isn’t the life he wants for me, or for Sammy. He wants us to work for him, with the family business. That’s why Sam lives with Bobby.”
Meg walks straight up to Castiel and drops a colorful bag into his lap. “Open it.”
Dean gave a small nod. “Okay.” He watched as Michael left the room and looked around, taking in his new abode. The room felt like it should be cozy and warm, but it felt alien to Dean. He sat on the bed and opened his bag, pulling out his old, clunky laptop. He set it on the bedside table and plugged his charger in.
Castiel returned to the dinner when it was time to eat and sat next to his husband. He was able to communicate with Dean through eye contact and nods. He confirmed what Castiel had suspected. Michael was such a control freak, and it drove him insane.
His eyes snap open when he hears a moan from the end of the bed. His gaze locks on Cas, and suddenly he’s one thousand times more turned on than he was before. He can’t see what Cas’s hand is doing behind him but imagining it is almost just as good. He strokes himself a little faster, but not too fast as to get too close.
Castiel smiled a bit. “Thanks.” He started reaching back over his shoulder to reach the center of his wings. He strained and did the best he could. “Damn it, I should have brought my brush or something.”
The group moves away from the topic of Castiel’s “weird dream” and the focus turns to Dean’s absolute annihilation of Ash at beer pong.
“Only if you’re naughty, then.” Castiel spread Dean’s legs and knelt between them. “Are you going to be good for me tonight?”
“Huh.” Sam listened intently.
Dean sighed. “It is. We patched things up.”
“That’s a long-ass time!”
“You’re not supposed to leave?” When Dean looked at Sam, he remembered why this kid was going to be a damn good lawyer. He could grill someone for answers without blinking and he was obsessed with finding the truth.
Michael growled at his brother. “You need to remember your place. Have some respect.”
Dean frowned and took a step closer to Cas, wrapping his arms around him. “I’m sorry.”
“Alright.” Dean walked to the table and sat down to eat.
Dean chuckles. “Alright, sorry. You two just seemed really close.”
“Long shower?”
“Told you. You hate me now.”
Dean woke up to the sound of a gentle knock on his door. He hadn’t even realized that he had fallen asleep. With a yawn, he rubbed his eyes and sat up. “Come in.”
“And that is?”
Dean gave a quick nod, eager to go up to his room. “Okay. Thanks.” He waited for Michael to start to walk away before quickly walking up to his room. Reality was setting in now, and it was hitting Dean hard. He closed his bedroom door and started pulling his suit off, carefully laying the individual pieces out to put away later. He pulled on his one pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt before curling up in bed.
Dean nodded, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back onto Castiel’s shoulder. “You help a lot.”
Dean grins. “I’m peachy. Nothing beats the feeling of being done with exams. I feel good about all of them, so I’m excited to see my grades.”
Dean’s hands rested on Castiel’s hips. He couldn’t help but stare in amazement at the man above him. He was so beautiful it made Dean’s eyes want to melt into his skull. His eyes, his jaw, his hair, his neck, his chest, his hips, his legs, and his ass were all individual works of art that came together at the gallery of Castiel. Dean felt honored to even be able to touch him, let alone be this intimate with him.
Dean pats Castiel on the back. “How much have you had?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah. We should probably head back to the station.”
Luke didn’t acknowledge Castiel in the morning, as per usual. Castiel’s husband wasn’t a morning person. The morning and afternoon were lonely while he waited for the omega to arrive with Gabriel.
“Me too.” Dean hummed. “I haven’t slept in here since Michael’s rut last month. I spent a week in here, because my mini-heat came right after.”
“No problem.” Castiel didn’t look back at Dean. The tension was growing and it made Dean’s skin itch. He wanted to claw out of the hole he was digging himself into and fall into Castiel’s arms, but the last thing he wanted was to feel like some damsel in distress.
Dean runs a hand through his hair. “Oh my god.”
“Because if you do, you’ll have a bounty on your head and all of Heaven will be on your ass. Trust me, that’s a position you don’t want to be in. Once we find you, we’ll torture you until you learn the meaning of obedience again.”
Dean’s eyes flick from Castiel’s eyes to his lips a few times. They inch closer together, hands still holding each other tightly. Dean closes the gap and kisses Castiel, his eyes flickering shut. The moment is made that much sweeter by Castiel’s arms wrapping around him. Something tickles the back of Dean’s neck, and with a small peek, Dean sees Castiel’s wings wrapping around both of them.
“I know, and you can say no. I just wanted to ask because you took care of me for so long, and I think it’s about time I take care of you. I won’t even touch you if you don’t want me to. I’ll just sit with you and give you any comfort you need.”
“Cas! Get in the circle!”
“Thanks, man. I appreciate you being so chill about it. I don’t like when people make it a big deal.”
“It’s going to be hard when we’re both drunk. Maybe we should try to keep apart.”
This was it. This was all the time they were going to get to be together, and then it was going to end. They’d spend the rest of their lives just pretending to be friends and trying to ignore the fact that they felt this way about each other. It was tearing Dean’s heart in half. He needed to do this for Sammy, but at the same time, he couldn’t help but wish for a better future for himself.
Dean frowned. “Dude, how hard did he bite you?”
Castiel nods with a smile. “He could do that with an English degree. There’s several different majors he can choose from and all of them will get him into law school.”
Dean stared back into Castiel’s eyes, searching for any sign of a lie, but all he saw was sincerity. “W-why?”
Dean listens and nods. “Okay, I can see that. I’m still not good at essays.”
“Gabriel works in food service. It’s a liability for him to be sick. I’m in charge of three floors worth of employees in that building. It’s a liability if I’m not there. I can quarantine myself in my office and still get my work done, and be there if I’m needed.” Michael sipped his coffee. “I’ll be fine, I promise. I already planned to come home early, so I’ll only be there for about five hours.”
“Bigfoot isn’t real.”
Dean thought for a moment. “Probably. I could still get a little air in the whole time, so I felt safe. I think I was different with the collar too. I might be more aversive to hands. I’d like to find out though. It was really intense.”
“So why did you expect it? You were nervous before we started, like you knew this would happen.” Dean ducks under Castiel’s wing and moves to sit beside him.
When Dean pulls back from the kiss, they’re enveloped in a feathery cocoon. Dean brushes his fingers over the feathers and smiles softly. “This...This is easier than I thought it would be.”
“I don’t know, but he said he knew where you lived.”
“I know. But, we’ll make it. We were fine over Thanksgiving.”
During scenes, Dean felt tired. He didn’t put in as much effort as before, and Castiel was picking up on it. He kept asking what was wrong, and Dean would just say he was tired, and they would stop. It made Dean upset to have to stop, mostly because he didn’t know why he wasn’t feeling it. His biggest fear was that he was getting bored. He loved Castiel dearly, but things didn’t feel alive like they used to.
Castiel listens closely to every word and nods along. Given that he has no experience with relationships, it feels important that he listens to someone with way more experience. “I think we can do it too. We seem to be a good match so far.”
Dean pats Castiel on the shoulder. “Let’s sit and watch a few more rounds of beer pong. You’re cut off for the rest of the night.” He sits down next to Castiel and turns his attention to the table where Meg and Jo have formed a team to take down Gabriel and Ash.
Dean stands up. “Hey, I won’t argue against free food.”
“So you’re just going to kill me? Good luck with that.” Castiel starts throwing punches, the blade Gabriel gave him in hand. He dodges the first few swings from Zachariah, then he takes a few hits. He wipes the blood from his lip and charges forward.
“I’m fine.”
Castiel shrugged. “We could head home. My wings are very well groomed now, so I can fly.”
Dean made a soft ‘hmph’ sound. “Yeah, I did stuff before. I didn’t just lay around doing nothing.”
“It was good.”
“I couldn’t live without driving. I love my car.”
“Oh, of course. If I were you, I’d shower first. Both of us reek of your heat. I’m about to go back to my room to shower.”
Castiel smiles fondly at Dean. “I could say the same for myself.” He slowly moves off of Dean and lays down beside him. One wing stays straight out behind him, and the other gently covers him and Dean.
Luke had a wide grin on his face. It was obvious, at least to Dean, that this fed Luke’s ego. “We are, aren’t we?” He wrapped an arm around Castiel. “Michael and Dean are alright too, I guess.”
Dean walked out to the lobby when it was time for the meeting, his hands in his coat pockets.
Dean nods. “I’ll come to your room. I’ll meet you there.”
“Okay. I promise I won’t hurt you, buddy.” With that reassurance given, Dean begins. He plunges his finger into the feathers and slowly drags his hands down. He starts on the left wing, since it looks a little more beat up than the right.
Dean gave a soft smile, relieved, to say the least. “Thanks, Cas.”
Dean walks in a minute later wearing an old t-shirt and boxers. He looks a little embarrassed. “I’m sorry about all of this. I didn’t think you’d have to see it so soon.”
“You ever think about trying to contact your siblings? How much younger are your brothers? Would they be old enough to be on their own?” Dean paused. “Sorry, I shouldn’t-”
“Oh, fuck, please. I’d want that too.”
“Wow. That’s insane, but I’m glad you’re his dad now. I’m sorry you lost your friend.”
“Yeah, very ready.”
Meg pats Castiel on the shoulder. “You’ve got this. I believe in you. Good luck.” She steps out of the car, leaving Castiel alone with his music.
“They’d figure it out. The smell of heat will get weaker and be gone in a day.”
Castiel chuckled. “You aren’t just trying to see me shirtless, are you?”
After a few minutes of being together like that, Dean already felt like this was the solution. The pressure to do something kinky or sexual was gone, and it was liberating. Dean got to simply enjoy Castiel’s company and feel his affection.
Castiel retreats to his own room and starts getting ready for bed. He takes a shower, puts on a t-shirt and some sweatpants, and gets into bed. After about an hour of scrolling through his phone, he falls asleep.
Dean leans over and kisses Castiel’s forehead. “I don’t know where I’d be without you. I’d be lonely. Hell, I might have gone back to hunting. I was considering it briefly when I first came here. Then you happened. You are my reason to stay away from hunting. I could never expose you to that life. You’ve seen enough, been through enough. Both of us have.”
“Just let me know if you need any help. I won’t be far.” Castiel got out of bed and stretched, his shirt riding up to expose sharp hip bones and toned abs. If Dean was still in heat, he’d be drooling over the sight. Hell, he was almost drooling now.
“You never called me after you supposedly talked to Dean and it worried me. Is your back door unlocked? I guess I’m about to find out.”
“N-no, I never wanted to lead you on. I just realized that we needed to stop. It was getting too big and too hard to hide. Last time, you presented your neck to me at least three times. It took a lot of restraint to keep from claiming you. I’m not trying to say that it was too hard to hold back, I would never do anything against your will, it just hurt too much. We only get to have each other for a week out of the month. What are we supposed to do with that? It’ll end soon. Your wedding is in two months. Wouldn’t it be easier to learn to just be friends now before we’re forced to?”
Dean looked around. “He usually parks at the back of that lot.”
Dean smiled. “Then let’s do it. We never got a chance to reverse the roles. We were always too tired, and during heat anything involving my dick is just background noise.”
“No, it’s okay. That’s a fairly logical conclusion to reach.” Castiel stood up and looked at the time. “You want to go downstairs and get some lunch? It’s getting pretty late for lunch, so I’m pretty hungry.”
Dean chuckled heartily. “I am. I’ll get more sun if it makes you happy.”
“I think this will work perfectly. You can stop the suppressants after the wedding, and then I’ll be the one to take care of your heats.” Michael took Dean’s hand and kissed the back of it. “I’m sorry you ended up in here again.”
Jody walked out and smiled at everyone. “Thank you all for coming. I’m sure you know why you’re all here. We need someone to take in Jack until we find a permanent spot for him.”
Dean didn’t really like this side of Michael, but he felt way too weak and vulnerable to say anything about it right now. “It’s okay.” He looked to the door when a woman walked in.
“It’s okay. I understand completely. You just wanted room to breathe. You left someone who was extremely controlling and I was immediately all over you. I’m sorry about that.” Castiel set his pencil down and sat up. “You’re welcome to stay down here. I’d be happy to have the company.”
Dean rubbed his face. “Shit...okay. Can you tell Michael?”
Dean nodded and looked down at his own hands, messing with a thread coming off from the sheets. The door opened and Michael stepped through, the frustrated look on his face shifting to worry when he saw Dean. “Hey, you’re awake.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Screw that. We get at least five days out of the month to ourselves to fuck around. I’ll even give you a hand if you want. You could even fuck me and we’d kill two birds with one stone.”
Dr. Barnes shook her head. “I’m afraid there isn’t.” She paused. “If you’re that opposed to sex before marriage between you two, how opposed would you be to someone else, like a beta or another omega, helping him? No suppressants, no premarital sex between you two.”
“I was thinking that Dean could fly out to California, so he could see my dorm and stuff.”
“The wounds don’t look too bad. You’re healing, right?”
Michael didn’t seem to mind, though he was surprised by Sam’s height. “It’s nice to meet you, Sam. Michael Milton.” He shook Sam’s hand firmly. “Dean speaks very highly of you. I know he’s very proud.”
Dean’s alarm blared through the room early the next morning. He got up and rubbed his face before rolling out of bed. He opted to get dressed before going downstairs today, since Jack was here. He still felt weird, knowing that he wasn’t alone in his house.
Dean laughed softly. “Alright, alright.” He backed off, lips red and puffy. He got out of the car and locked it once Castiel was out too. They looked all ruffled up, cheeks red and clothes a little wrinkled.
Once they arrived at the motel, Castiel asked for a room.
“Thanks, Cas.” The nickname slipped off Dean’s tongue like he had been saying it for years. He slid his phone into his pocket before walking out of the room and down the stairs. He spotted Michael near the front door, adjusting the cuff of his sleeve while he talked quietly on the phone with someone. His eyes flicked up to the stairs, landing on Dean.
Dean took out his phone to text Sam.
Dean smiled softly. “Sounds good.”
Despite his doubts, Dean sends the text anyway. He says who he is and gives a general location so that Cas can find him.
Castiel stands up, taking another deep breath through his nose. “Hi. Can we talk?”
Castiel nodded and started typing. He wrote out a new email to Anna, and instead of angling the laptop away, he sat a little closer to Dean so he could see the screen.
Humiliation set in quickly, and Castiel had to spend another ten minutes composing himself. He already heard Luke leaving the house, so at least he was gone and Castiel wouldn’t have to face him.
The other bedroom door opens with a soft creak and out comes Dean. He rubs a hand over his face and looks at the coffee maker on the counter. Before he can even say anything, Castiel speaks.
Claire looked up and sat up taller in her chair to see out the back window. She grinned when she saw the playground and sat back down to finish eating.
Dean turned his attention to the bathroom to attempt to work the shower. It took him a few minutes to figure out all of the fancy knobs, but once he had it down, the shower was heavenly. The water beat down on his back and neck, forcing his body into a state of relaxation. It was only now that he realized how exhausted he was. Collapsing on the bed was the best feeling in the world after that amazing shower. Dean fell asleep within the span of three minutes, curled around one of the fluffy, downy pillows.
Hours pass and the day ticks by. Castiel knows that Dean won’t be back until after five, so he has the run of the place. He spends that time laying in bed, watching youtube. It’s just what he needs to unwind from yesterday’s events.
Cas runs his hands down his own body until he reaches his thighs. He finds one of Dean’s hands and laces their fingers together. “Tell me how it feels.”
On the third day with Jimmy, Dean was home alone while Jimmy went to go pick up Jack. He wondered if Castiel was doing alright. If his heat was the same as it was back in Chicago, it would be done by today.
Dean frowned. “We can’t go by ourselves?”
Sunday was rough. Michael was in a bad mood and it put a sour taste in Dean’s mouth. The alpha didn’t even speak to Dean until they were alone after Claire was in bed.
Dean left the house and locked the door behind both of them. As he walked out into the garage, one of his neighbors stopped in front of his house, on a morning jog.
Dean is sitting in the living room when Castiel walks out. He stands up from the couch and grins. “You look good. Let’s go.”
“Mmm, not too bad yet. I’m just happy you’re here.”
“You are extremely sunburnt.”
Castiel smiles and walks to the kitchen. He knows Dean doesn’t have time to wait for Castiel to cook breakfast, so instead he makes himself a bowl of cereal. He didn’t really feel like cooking anyway.
“Just...make sure Luke doesn’t find out I’m in Chicago.”
Dean shook his head. “I slept all night, in my car. I woke up when the sun started rising and getting in my eyes. I saw all of those calls and texts from you, and I realized how bad I had fucked up. I came back as soon as I woke up. What I did yesterday was completely uncalled for. I know you would have understood if I said I needed space for a day, and I had gone out. Instead, I just ignored you for a day without thinking at all about how you would feel about it. I’m so sorry, Cas. I should have at least answered your call or texted you. I’m an asshole for that.”
The bedroom looks sparse, but Castiel is excited by the big windows that span across the back wall. He has a few plants, but he plans on expanding his collection. He can already picture shelves in front of the windows filled with dozens of plants.
“Funny timing, I just put Jack down for his nap. Is Claire asleep too?”
“They won’t let that happen.”
Dean shook his head. “I was just about to go wake mine up.”
Castiel thought for a moment. He had to really think if he’d be okay keeping their relationship a secret for some time. He’d do it in a heartbeat if Dean was in the closet, so this didn’t have to be any different. He could do it now just to keep Dean comfortable. He nods. “That’s okay with me. Just as long as we do eventually tell them. I can’t keep the secret forever.”
Dean nodded and rubbed his eyes before threading his fingers through his hair with a yawn. “Okay. See you then.” He blinked and pulled back a bit when Michael tried to kiss him. “Haven’t brushed my teeth yet.”
Dean shook his head. “I can’t. He tracks me on my phone, I don’t have any of my things or Claire’s things, he’d find me...I just can’t. I’m sorry.”
Castiel looked at Dean and silently shook his head, a small frown on his face. He already knew Michael’s answer.
“See ya, Cas.”
Meg was already a little scary at times, but Ruby was on another level. She had the kind of attitude that told you that she wasn’t afraid to cut you down if you got in her way. She never seemed to like Castiel very much, so whenever he came over Ruby would either disappear or stare at him until he left the room. It was creepy.
Dean parades around the living room, bouncing Castiel on his shoulder. “Nope! I gotcha now!” He keeps one arm wrapped around Castiel’s middle and uses the other to hold Castiel’s legs to his chest. He swings him back and forth, cackling and grinning from ear-to-ear.
Dean looks down at the floor. “I guess what I’m trying to say is, I do like you. I think there’s something between us, but if we tried a relationship now, I’d screw it up. It’s too soon, and I’m not ready. I’d do something dumb and get both of us hurt, and that’s the last thing I want.”
The tricky part came when Castiel realized he had to face Dean. He wanted the details of his marriage and sex life to stay private, so he needed to come up with a reason for why he was upset to avoid questions. Maybe he could say they had a fight? Or Luke got called into work?
Castiel took his sweet time with Dean. He kissed all over his body and really took the time to learn how he ticked. He never got the chance before this to discover how sensitive Dean’s nipples were.
“Yeah.” Dean closed his eyes for a few minutes, just relaxing in the calm energy of the room. Their scents were mixed together nicely, more so than they had ever been back in Chicago.
“He had to run through the airport after security, but yeah, he made it.”
Dean walked over to the couch and sat down next to Castiel, curling up against his side. He pulled the other half of the blanket around himself and rested his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder. He took out his phone and ordered the pizza online while Castiel scrolled through Netflix to find a movie for them to watch.
Castiel pours his focus back into his work and ignores Dean’s presence. He manages to stay focused until it’s time for him to go to his next class. He starts packing up.
Dean’s heart dropped into his stomach when he realized he was talking to Michael’s father. He gulped and nodded. “Of course, sir.” His voice was deeper and tighter than usual, like it would be when John was barking orders at him.
Dean laid his bed all the way down and closed his eyes. He was still pretty drowsy and hoped sleep would come easily. A nurse came in soon after Michael left and checked his vitals. Dean drifted off to sleep shortly after she was done, happy to sleep the night away.
Dean sighed and set his fork down, running his hands over his face. “I’m really sorry, Cas. I don’t know how you could forgive me for this.”
Dean wondered if they would be the only ones in the kitchen this morning, but it wasn’t likely. Luke and Castiel were probably there, or at least in the living room. Gabriel would be at the bakery by now.
Cas gently lays a hand on Dean’s face. “I’m not sure there’s a reason. I saw you, and I was drawn to you. You looked like you needed guidance, and to be honest, I’m very attracted to you. That doesn’t often happen for me, given my grey asexuality. Finding someone that I’m truly drawn to like you is rare. In saying this, I don’t want to pressure you into anything. If you want to move on and never see me again, that will be okay. You can be a spectacular day for me, and I will be happy.”
Dean knew there were plenty of relationships with two alphas or two omegas. It was becoming more commonplace now and more widely accepted. That being said, Dean had never had feelings for an omega before. He was attracted to alphas and betas, dudes and women. It didn’t matter as long as the person fit into those categories.
Gabriel shakes his head. “Nah, we can ditch that one.”
“Thank you. That means a lot to hear.”
Dean swallowed. “Yeah.”
Sam pulls a major bitchface. “You know what I meant.”
Dean flushed crimson, not realizing he had stunk up the halls with his sorrows. “It was good.”
Now, they didn’t have everything anymore. Things got hard between Castiel working long hours and Dean spending hours at the computer working on his classes, but it didn’t matter. They had each other and two beautiful children. The world was theirs for the taking, and nothing was going to stop them.
Castiel stared at the picture of Alfie on the screen, his eyes slowly filling with tears. “He was so young, and I was an idiot. I wasn’t watching him. I knew he wasn’t a strong swimmer, and I didn’t watch him close enough. I was just doing my own thing, and when I turned around, he was gone. I looked for hours, and when my mother came to find us, she found me crying on the shore. The rescue team found his body at the bottom of the lake.”
“At least you admit it.”
“You’re not drinking?”
Michael shook his head. “I guess not. Let’s just go to bed.” He waited for Dean to leave before putting his own pajamas on.
“Homework. I didn’t do any all weekend, so I’m pretty behind. I have an exam on Thursday, so I need to study too. I don’t have time during the day, so I do this when Jack is asleep.”
Dean breathed a sigh of relief when they were finally off the subject of being stuck in the house. “Well, on a usual day, it’s just me and Cas here. Gabriel has a bakery in town, and he’s really present there. He says it runs by itself with his staff, but he wants to be there to work with them, which is cool, I guess. Luke and Michael go to work at the same time, but take different cars because they can’t stand each other.”
“Thanks, buddy.” Dean retreats back to his room, leaving Castiel alone again.
Dean followed him and brushed his own teeth, staying quiet until he had rinsed his mouth out. “Anything I can do to help?”
