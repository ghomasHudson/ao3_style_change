It felt so mundane and normal. He knew it was what couples did. They talked about their days, went on dates, and did other things. Things he wished he was doing with Cas. Goddammit. There his brain went again.
The last time I saw him was ten years ago
“Dean it’s okay. You don’t have to figure out everything at once,” Sam said gently “However if he is to you what Eileen is to me you have to let Lisa go. It’s not fair to her.”
"You knew he wrote a book and didn't tell me?" Dean asked his brother looking at him

Cas blinks at him.
Dean clears his throat. He doesn’t know when it got thick and sticky and hot. His eyes are burning again; goddamned ash, Dean hates this landscape. He hates everything about Purgatory. But it’s going to have him. That’s just how it’s gonna be.

Yeah, a keeper for sure.
They get most of the mud and dirt off Cas’s bag with the hand-brush that Dean uses to clean mud and blood off Dad’s leather jackets—it works pretty well, it gets into the little cracks in the canvas. The canvas is waxed, too, and most of the gunk is gravel, so it’s not as bad as it looked when Dean first saw it. Cas tries to insist on them starting their homework, but Dean answers, “No way, Magnificent Seven is showing at five. We can do homework after that.”
They both have to turn sideways to get past Dean’s dad to get to the door—as if John Winchester is standing there to try and keep someone from bolting.
“We’ve had enough bad luck in our lives. I was only trying to avoid more,” Cas mutters, digging his chin back into Dean’s sternum with all the haughty, grumbly annoyance that Dean just

“I’m sorry,” Castiel told Sam, that evening at dinner. “I didn’t realize.”
to a bookshelf, not just taking from one, is still novel. Still a joy.
If it’s not comments about him being a suit or a nerd—Cas doesn’t bat an eyelash about those—it’s jabs about how Cas couldn’t possibly know what it’s like to actually be out there, fighting ghouls or ghosts or vampires. Much less
But he doesn’t.
No one had been in that hot, uncomfortable little space for years, he was sure—not even the most adventurous Weyr children would have come into Novak’s cavern. The little steps that Novak had carved for him, back in the day, had long since crumbled into sandy divots on the wall, and the opening had half collapsed. He wondered how many sand-spiders lived there these days.
The food is simple enough—in this part of the world, Dean doesn’t expect meat unless it’s caught wild, so he’s surprised to find bits of dried pork in the vegetable stew and a thick meatiness to it that says there was bone in the broth.
“There really should be better regulations about these things!” Cas insists, in his deep, sexy, gravelly voice.
“I don’t think you have the least fucking idea what justice means anymore, do you?” Dean tells him, bluntly, harshly. “’Cause here you are, drinkin’ and sittin’ with me, angel. I’m never gonna give you jackshit. You know it and I know it. So why are you even
Dean and Sam had lived their entire lives at Eden in the dragonrider wing of corridors, because of their father. Even though John and Winchester had not been able to fight demons, John
But his Dad would’ve also been kind of proud of the way Cas took care of himself today, ‘cause there’s definitely taking a blow so that he can deliver the one that’ll take someone down. So that’s probably not it?
Dean doesn’t take a step back, but his shoulders up shoot high and hard, and he feels his face set. There’s no reason he should be disappointed—he doesn’t know this jackass from Adam—but he recognizes that that’s sort of what’s going through his belly right now.
He knows that Dean drinks too much, but retains his balance and his smile when he does.

“Exactly,” Cas agrees. “You might
, son,” his Dad says. Dean can already see the ward lights flickering sadly behind him as Liliths and hellhounds push and shove against the edges of the lines, rolling over each other like waves. There’s an angel hovering in the distance on the corpse of the one that Henricksen took down, like a crawling cloud of midnight. There’s that thick gunshot
(M) - after Chuck takes Castiel’s grace, they discover he doesn’t like music anymore.
Dean waits all of that out, ‘cause watching Cas’s mind work through its loop-de-loops when it comes to hunters is sort of adorable and a little hilarious sometimes. He chuckles. “I mean, kinda.”
“Not a backrub, no.” Cas ran a ticklish, light hand down Dean’s side, the muscles jumping to his touch. “Though I think you might find that soothing, too. I know your penis is painful in rut, but we can do other things. You of all people know that. Can’t we?”
not a sperm donor. (Do angels have sperm? They’ve gotta, right? Jesus, Dean’s life has gotten weird.)
To his credit, Cas actually does flinch a little, dropping his gaze. “That wasn’t…” But he trails off. They won’t pretend that that wasn’t what Cas meant. “I’m sorry I said that. I’m…” he looks up; Dean can feel the piercing stare of his gaze at the line of his jaw, the curve of his cheek. “I
?’ in his voice. “These old boots aren’t made for walking. What, you think we got all year to make it to the Rift?”
Dean doesn’t know whether he wants to close his eyes or stare. Holy shit, there’s just so much skin. He’s trying to remember if he’s ever really gotten a look at Cas shirtless. He doesn’t think he has, not without someone bleeding, and God, look at him: strong shoulders, long, lean, delicate muscle—a hint of a treasure trail into soft-looking, curly fluff, cock hanging unthreatening against a thick thigh before Dean wrenches his gaze away and fixes it above Cas’s collarbones again. Dean doesn’t know if that body is Jimmy, if that’s all Cas, or all of the above, and Dean’s mouth should not be fucking
So Dean doesn’t know why he left

Dean was discussing adventure ballads with his dragon. Aloud.

By the fifth day, Castiel’s uncertainty has bloomed and the smell of it seems to permeate his whole little house. The words that ran out of him so easily the other day seem to have found the dam in their river. He jogs on his basement treadmill first, and then runs until he’s breathless and burning, his air heaving out of him.
That was nice, wasn’t it? That Benny would stay, at least for the five or so years it took for a bronze to mature?
The thing is, Dean can fake it most of the time. He’s really, really good at that. Lunchtime, though: kids
“My aunt,” she says. “I grew up less than a mile from here.” And just like that, the fact that there’s an unmarked Sentinel without a mage here at the ass-end of the world starts to make a lot more sense. “So you’re Dean Winchester.” She comes towards him, her hand held out, smiling.

Dean was still so close, still grinning at him—the grin widened a little further, gorgeous and lush and delicious. He didn’t respond aloud. Then one eye—the color of Castiel’s Christmas cactus in the late afternoon light peeking through the window, winked shut.
Sam, on the way to the same seat, goggles at the back of Cas’s head from across the mess hall before turning away and beelining towards Rufus and John’s table a little ways away, so quickly it’s a miracle his orange juice doesn’t topple over.
Castiel hadn’t been lying about the lemons, either: there were three, heavy and sweet-smelling, at the bottom of the basket. Dean was already puckering just thinking about it, but they didn’t have any sugar to dip them into, just salt. It was Stormdark, and people had to make do during Stormdark.
Cas frowns at him, looking up from his textbook and turning sideways from where he’s belly-down and shoulder-to-shoulder with Dean on Dean’s bed. “Fishing? Like… for…” Cas wrinkles his nose again, and tilts his head. “I realize it’s probably stating the obvious, but do you mean for… actual fish?”

Dean’s head is starting to bob in a hypnic twitch by the time the motel lights start to gleam in the distance. Baby’s wheel is heavy enough that the car around them doesn’t jerk as the cortical slowing takes Dean for a moment, but Castiel reaches out to brush his fingertip against the side of Dean’s thigh, sending a tiny little spark of his fading grace into him. Just a little. Not enough that Dean would notice. It won’t last long, but it will last him long enough.
“Riiight.” She shook her head and gave him a pitying look.
Dean grumbled, looking disappointed. Impala’s eyes darkened to a swirl of brown, and he lowered his chin down again from where he’d turned over his shoulder to watch Castiel converse with his rider. “See?” Dean told Impala, rubbing down the ridges of his smaller neck spines. “Told you.” Impala’s tail tips flicked once, almost hard enough to whip, but he tucked them underneath himself and half-closed his eyes instead.
That gets a soft bark of a laugh out of Castiel. It even has some real humor to it. “Charlie, you’d have to poke me with a cattle prod to get me to sign up for
But it doesn’t stop Dean from smirking and saying, “I think I’m adorable.”

Castiel’s body tried, quite vigorously and quite uselessly, to tell him that he was twenty years younger than he was.
All three of them laugh. “Oh boy,” Sam chuckles. “You don’t even want to know, Cas.”

Alfie came as a Candidate when Castiel was fifteen. Alfie was the same age, but small and slight, so he looked younger. He had the biggest, bluest eyes that Castiel had ever seen, like tilting up his chin into the summer sky. Castiel was so used to being just a little shorter than other boys his age—and now he was shorter than Dean, Benny
Sam shouldn’t be scared. Dean knew how to go without so Sam could eat. There would always be enough for Sam. Besides, what was he supposed to say—the mark he’d been trailing the whole damned day got scooped up by a kid with fast hands, blue eyes, and the rosy, full cheeks of a scavenger who was really damned good at what he did? Yeah, awesome.
“Cassie, smile, this is gonna be
. In the motels, Dean always had the TV on, and in the car, the radio was always going. It wasn’t that Sam couldn’t ignore those things—he got very good at ignoring them, very quickly. And it wasn’t that he couldn’t read and reread his books. But he was only allowed to bring four books wherever they went; if he wanted a new one, he had to get rid of one.

Yes, that would work.

what he’s saying?” Dean answers with a little snort, starting on his locker combination. The asshole can’t even admit he got into a rumble?  Cas split off from Dean at the door, heading straight for the chem lab—some sort of teacher’s assistant stuff—but not without a shaky, nervous little smile. “Hell no.
Shame wallops Dean hard over the cheekbones.
Cas nodded. “A new book.” His hand came up to cradle along Dean’s cheekbone, thumb stropping back and forth against the rough line of Dean’s beard stubble. “It has a line that made me think of you. ’Every time you get the world by its tail, she thought, you gotta remember there’s teeth on the other end,’” he quoted.
Dean didn’t know about any of that until after.
Castiel feels the small smile wilt quietly off his lips. He turns around and leans back against the rail of his treadmill, switching the phone to his other shoulder since his bad arm is starting to ache. She invites him every year, because Charlie knows where he’s not welcome. Is it that time already? Anna will invite him too, but he’ll refuse, as he always does: if he were ever to agree, she and Balthazar and Alfie would have to stay home again rather than venturing to Illinois to joining the rest of the Novaks for the larger celebration, and he wouldn’t do that to them.
to do so didn’t mean that everyone else wasn’t doing it. Castiel could hear the clink of coins around them and see jars of luxury items like honey and refined sugar exchanging hands in the background, behind the rim of the Hatching Grounds’ rough oval.
“I'm sorry,” he said, finally. Achingly. He’d regret this choice, he knew.

“Benny,” Castiel asked, looking up from the harness he was fixing with an awl and thread, “is it possible to make yourself fall for someone?”
“Gross,” Dean blurts.
Maybe it’s always like this, when something goes wrong. Maybe this is a punishment for when someone’s stupid enough to let their soulmate go into the beyond without reaching out and grabbing back—without confirming the words appearing on their skin, too, braiding their souls and branding their bodies. Dean doesn’t know anyone who he could possibly fucking ask about it. He already knows he’s a freak; he doesn’t want to find out what strangers on the Interwebs theorize about his freakishness.
Dean sighed. There really was something wrong with this guy—he was storm-sick, or maybe just touched in the head. This was a bad idea, he just knew it. But he couldn’t just

“Yes!” Dean answers, still gagging on both laughter and his own imagination.
It's only when they stop, Dean panting wetly into the heavy black fabric of the protective face mask, his goggles spattered with pollen, that he realizes that his legs are trembling from someone else’s weight on him. He doesn’t know how long they were moving, or, hell, where—with how fucking hard it is to balance someone’s dead weight on his shoulder while making his way through the trampled path of everyone in front of him, Dean had to take drag. Hell, it took all he had to keep putting one foot in front of the other, and when they stop, he almost runs headfirst into Benny.
And Dean doesn’t know why something that feels ugly and scary curls in the base of his throat when his dad’s eyes leave Cas, and come to rest on where Dean’s sort of propping up the wall now.
“You’d probably tell me something really pointless about windmills, wouldn’t you,” he says, before the words get drowned, and Dean folds in over his knees, his wet face in his hands. He can’t make his shoulders stop shaking. He can’t breathe. But it doesn’t matter, because here, he doesn’t have to be angry. He doesn’t have to fight. He doesn’t have to be
It doesn’t waft away. It
—but that thought feels sour and bitter and hypocritical in his mouth. After a long second of not letting out that poison, Dean realizes why.
(The fact that Dean feels something in his chest release brightly at the sight of that familiar little flash of teeth, the way Cas’s eyes squint even before his lips move and his cheeks arch, full of amused tension and just a bit of gum line—well, that’s no one’s goddamned business but Dean’s.)
But Cas has the finest prickle of stubble just underneath his lower lip, abrading just that tiny spark against Dean’s. He has that little dip in the upper one just made for tasting, for a tongue. He doesn’t have his mouth closed, and the breath of it makes the world around them waver like it just gasped for air.
Aiyah. So... how many people thought Castiel would Impress at his last Hatching Ceremony? I'm sorry! *runs away from potential rotten fruit*
“How?”
It was true that Castiel loved him—that he might be getting more out of any intimate contact between them than Dean ever would. But was that a bad thing? Castiel’s love was painful at times, it was true, but it was still precious to him—
Their fingers interlock. Cas’s palm is a little sweaty, because as a human, he sweats, now (and he hates it, which is sort of cute). The tattoo of a handprint on Dean’s left shoulder and bicep itches a little every time they touch like this.
going to do to me?”
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles, again. “Water too cold?”
The snarl in Dean’s voice was so loud that it rumbled when he whirled over, his arms already ready to pin Cas down and grab him by the throat and fuck him into the mattress. The pure
What?
It was such a bizarre statement that Castiel didn’t even know how to process it. His mouth hung open and stayed that way.
He doesn’t look at Dean. He doesn’t look at Dean at all.
(Well, okay, normally Dean ended up taking him if Sam wasn’t allowed to go by himself, and
three faraway gunshots all one after another. The high thin screech of interference from their little walkie-talkies screams, once, like in pain, and then goes out.

Goddammit. Dean was

Dean blinks, very slowly.
Whatever Dean said as he turned back to him, grinning fit to split his cheeks, was lost in the sharp sound of another egg pipping open.
“Easy, Angel,” Castiel said out loud, for Dean’s benefit. Even after all these years, Dean talked aloud to Impala. Castiel had always found it so unexpectedly adorable; he loved watching Dean have conversations with his dragon. But right now, he was just… tired. “Let him go.”
It was such an uncharacteristically colorful expression coming from

She wanders off sometimes, but she never runs away; travelers put their kids on her back and she trots them around, her head bobbing up and down, peaceful and snuffly as always. If she’s noticed anything missing, Dean can’t tell.
After that, it’s almost too easy. They don’t even

—still steaming, buttery and rich.
He doesn’t have those dreams every day. But he doesn’t know if they’re better or worse than the screaming nightmares.
Cas frowns at him. “I don’t know why you’d say that, Dean,” he says, in that too-serious way he’s got, all eyeballs and lips. “You’re as smart as Sam, and I know you expect
weirdo, not his, so,” Dean answered firmly. “Say it however you want, sweetheart.”
But Castiel thought that if he turned around and Dean said, “Well, this is good, right? This way we can stand together in the next Hatching!” he would punch his best friend in the face. Thumb out.
But in a library, he had silence, punctuated only by the soft whisper of pages turning,
“Just sayin'. You're gonna have to fight me on it,” Dean grumbled, but his arm wrapped over Castiel's shoulders and the kiss he dropped on Castiel's temple felt like a blessing. Like benediction; like the first time he'd taken to the sky on Angel's back.

the number of times I’ve turned on that oven.”
“Cas?” Dean says, behind him. The soft foil of his voice crackles across Castiel’s nerves, hot and bright as a shower after having been cold for so long. When Dean puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder, Castiel folds his arms around his own midsection and curls around them, ducking down and trying not to hyperventilate as he holds himself in. Dean’s fingers on his shoulder feel so
“Okay, I like the sound effects, but easy on the squirming, buddy,” Dean laughed as Castiel's hips reached up for him again.

“How do you know? You’ve never met one!” Dean shot back. Dad hadn’t ever had anything good to say about the Magisterium—he’d hated them more than anything, and he’d blamed mages and stuff for Mom’s death, though Dean wasn’t all the way sure why that was. Storms happened. They happened to

“Actually, testicles are an area of the body that are mostly protected from the effects of internal magic,” Cas said helpfully. “It’s why book- and craft-mages can father children. Presumably storm-mages can as well if they abstain from missions for long enough. So my testicles likely have no power at all.”

“The grape is round and plush on your tongue, isn’t it?” Cas’s voice rolls over and around him, rough and gritty. He’s nowhere nearby, and no one’s watching; Dean lets himself shiver. “Maybe it’s a little cool, but maybe a little warm from being in the sun. Whichever is your preference. It’s a large one. It fits between your tongue and your palate, making space for itself.  When it catches on your teeth, the skin has just the perfect amount of give. It doesn’t split, though. Not at first.

After the first time, Dean had never told Castiel, “
“Of course,” Castiel answers, closing the door behind him. Dean doesn’t have a coat hanger in his entryway, he notices—there’s a chair near the door that has three coats and a jacket slung haphazardly over it, and Castiel carefully lays his on top of the pile. “But… we should exchange phone numbers. Just in case. For the future.”
Dean’s mouth drops open, and for a second, he forgets about the fact that they’re standing in angel afterlife and Cas is naked. He forgets that he’s the fucking moron who somehow has an
“It’s true!” Cas insisted. “I don’t understand what you find so funny about that. They are a privileged location in the human body!” he continued, all fluffy dark-haired indignance.
And why the heck anyone would think about lending Dean Winchester anything, when Dean’s just as likely to be gone tomorrow as he is to be here by exams is beyond him. But he guesses people who live in houses and go to the same school every day don’t think like that.
That almost gets a smile out of Castiel. “No.” Charlie’s such a

You think there might really be four at a time coming at us, huh?”

“New sim today, right?” Garth says, like nothing unusual happened. But he hands Cas’s suit jacket back to him with a few hearty pats on the shoulder. He’s grinning. “Joshua promised us a new sim.”
Cas smiled down at him. “You see? You trust yourself so little.” He moved his hips down in a slow grind on top of Dean, and this time, Dean gripped harder to make him stop, because he was already so damned close. That kind of quick, sharp punch of an orgasm wasn’t satisfying when he was in rut, and tended to just make him chafe.
, the asshole.
He didn’t realize he’d stepped back until he felt something warm on the small of his back—Cas’s hand, wide and solid. Cas was looking at him with those big, blue eyes—as serious and confused as he ever was, both of his eyebrows knitting together in the middle of his forehead. He wasn’t paying any attention to the archmagus lady at all. He was just staring like Dean was the only thing he could see.
“Seeing as how all evidence suggests he’s married to one, that would be a logical conclusion, yes,” Cas answers, with a tip of a very serious eyebrow. Asshole doesn’t even crack a smile.
” he starts, drawing the protective circle in chalk with sweeps of his arm, big enough for Cas to work inside and spread his wings (ha, ha). He follows it up with a hasty layer of salt, that familiar golden-yellow glow starting up in the crystals as he keeps going. Cas’s mage-glow is the purest white that Dean’s ever seen, but privately, he’s always liked the warmer colors of the Sentinel incantations. “
“But you know, he calls me whenever he hears on the news somethin’ ‘bout Minnesota, just to let me know he’s thinking of me? Spends an hour telling me ‘bout a documentary ‘bout Andy Warhol. And I barely knew the guy, before.” She laughed. “And who doesn’t love a man who volunteers at an animal shelter, right? That one, he’s just a gentle soul, I guess. Someone who won’t lie,” she told them, both her eyebrows up as if she thought this was something they should not need to be told. “So maybe he’s not ready to try again, yet, but when he is? Not many of those out there, sweet men like that with steel on the inside. Someone’d be damned lucky to have him love them.”
(And if he felt bad about Sam having to leave a school where people really liked him—‘cause Dean’s little brother is kind of a nerd, but that doesn’t mean he can’t kick ass—that’s no one’s damned business.)
There are only a handful of people who have any authority to override him in this, and certainly no one who’d do it on my behalf.”

he found the sight of Dean looking down at him, his face and lips still splattered with Castiel’s come.
Dean doesn’t get to go to the movie theater much, but Sam wants to take Lindsey tomorrow, and it’s the last week of school before Christmas break. How the hell can Dean say no to that? But it means he’s got to tell Patty and them that he can’t go with them tonight. (Sure as hell he’s not telling them it’s ‘cause there’s not enough money set by that both he and Sam can go to the movies.)
effigy, I am sure that I could get you fixed right up—”
“Hah!” Sam crows, jamming his fist up towards the sky in triumph—as tall as he is, it looks like he’s trying to punch the remnants of the roof.
“Come here,” Cas said, again, and this time Dean understood what he meant. It sounded like a command, but it was a request.
But here? Here, there’s the shush of the rain mingled with something crooning, like a song, before it trails off into a scream. There are cries in the darkness that sound like children in pain, trying to get them to head in that direction and into a trap. Cas flinches at the first one;

I think you’re…” What was the expression? “…paying on credit you don’t have coins for,” he finished triumphantly.
But he didn’t leave, either, though he was shifting on his feet as if he was contemplating bolting. And behind them, Castiel heard the sound of wings rustling, heavy muscles unfolding. It wasn’t Angel—so Impala must be getting his legs underneath him. And no,
(Castiel had been right about Sam, too: between sixteen and seventeen, Sam had shot up so quickly that he’d spent most of the year with his bones hurting, and now he was as tall as Castiel—nearly as tall as Dean already.)
Gordon’s smile goes tight and flat, though—like he really wasn’t expecting that.
Dean rolled his eyes so far back that Castiel thought he should have been seeing the sky right through the ceiling. “Whatever, yeah. But that was last year.”
“Well, now, ain’t that obvious?” Jody drawls. There’s something about her smile as she slings her arm through his elbow that Castiel thinks he should be wary of.
Seraph, they’ve called Cas, all this time. Wings and magic. Nightmares in the dark.
He’d watched and cheered in two other Hatchings that he remembered (and one that he didn’t, where people told him he’d been sitting on his mother’s shoulders and trying to pet Novak’s face). He knew that the most important thing for a Candidate to do was to stand tall and not be afraid; baby dragons

of Metropolis. “Krypton,” he offers.
Castiel didn’t know whose idea it was—whether it was the dragon’s, or his rider’s—for Winchester and John to launch themselves at the mouth of the Hellgate just as a burst of demons roared through it with a sound like the explosions that were used to knock down firestone shale.
Max, scoffs, rolling her eyes. “
But Dean’s not lucky.
Dean looks up from pulling his own notebook of math homework out of his backpack. This math module is all stuff he knows: he can plot lines and functions, sure. Dean’s always been pretty good at that. And next up is gonna be trigonometry.
But rather than picking himself up or changing position, Dean reached

“General Novak riding your ass, too?” Unlike Adler, General Novak’s never bothered to come watch them. Maybe she just watches the tapes or reads the reports. Dean never did ask how exactly Cas, the poor sap, got roped into being the point person between a big-ass set of tug-of-war over them. But he
“Heya, sleepyhead,” Dean says, and he feels himself smiling despite himself as he lifts the headset and microphone. “Got caught after a rager, huh?”
“It’s your turn to cook, and I’m
Castiel sighs. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he says firmly.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Cas, I…” Dean twists back towards him, ready to apologize again, but Cas has already closed his eyes again, turning over. He grumbles into his forearm like the sound of gravel crunching under an approaching car.
that, right now.
“Okay,” Castiel agreed, but he looked like he wasn’t really sure what that meant.
“I don’t know,” Cas answered. “Maybe I was. I don’t remember.”
“Good thing you didn’t,” Dean notes, and lowers the towel. “Little further back, that would’ve gotten you in the kidney, and if you started pissing blood I really would’ve made you go to the hospital. There, I think you’re done.”
do the whole accidental meet-cute for real, it wasn’t like you met at an event or through a metamour or something.”
Dean snorts and the rest of Cas’s question sputters out as Dean reaches his target and peels the blankets off Cas. Cas wants a blowjob, Dean is oh-so-happy to provide, but he is
“Boys,” John Winchester says.
“Who’s after you? Who did this?” Dean barks. His bet is on a ghost. The school’s not old, but Kankakee almost certainly has a burial ground on it somewhere, with a name like that. Why didn’t Dean look that up? Stupid, stupid,
Maybe he was seeing something there that Dean didn’t know he was showing, because Cas’s smile at him was soft and easy and gentle, and a whole fucking lot better than he deserved.

Hannah, though, seems more annoyed than normal with them, snapping when Martin fumbles in his recitation some of the codes after an intense fight scene when they’re all wheezing. Dean’s angel blade is heavy in his hand by the end of practice, his fingers cramping from their grip on the heavy thing. Joshua takes it from him and wipes it down, but when Dean thanks him, he doesn’t smile back.

The skin showing didn’t make Cas’s scent any stronger, almost nothing did that. But the glimpse of the deep roll of his Adam’s apple, Dean’s mating mark on the right side of Cas’s neck, the little reddish crescent that had scarred up so pretty and hadn’t yet faded to the white streaks of an old mating…
“How come you’re up here?”
Castiel closes his eyes—he probably doesn’t have eyes anymore—in the dark-of-nothingness, and is content in the decision he’s made. He would not have made any other. Given a thousand choices, he would have said “I love you” every single time. He would have said it over and over and over until the disbelief left Dean’s eyes.
Castiel closes his eyes and smiles back. “No. Just you.”
Castiel reunites with his body in pieces.
If he and Dean never spoke again, there would be no trace in the world that they ever met at all. He thinks there’s something that’s tragic about that.
But the pin of his father’s glare silences the words in his throat. Which is probably good, because Dean’s got no idea what the hell to say.
. Cas wasn’t even aiming for Dean’s sweet spot—from the way Dean felt swollen and ripe and about ready to pop all over again even though he’d just come, Dean wasn’t sure that’d feel good—but his fingers were moving so nice and easy. The stretch and burn almost wiped out the awareness of how Dean’s cock had started pulsing again, the fucking stupid thing. Cas wasn’t using just spit, it couldn’t be… right?
The Tentacle Husbands (3 stories)
Dean pushes himself back into the couch cushions and grumbles.
Dean finishes helping Benny and Victor set up the warding lanterns around the perimeter—there’s only twelve of them left, and shit, Dean doesn’t even know when they lost two more. But the light lines still cross cleanly. Not for the first time, Dean’s
Castiel narrowed his eyes at her warily. “I guess I don’t understand. What do you get out of any of this?”
Dean blinks. “I, uh.” He scratches the back of his head. “I mean, you already know what we do, man. It’s not
. That’s what it is, Dean, and you know it!” Castiel spat back, flushed with fury until he thought that his ears would ache from it. Blood pounded in his temples. “Don’t make excuses for him, not for that. If Naomi had known that your father thought that way, it wouldn’t have mattered that he was a hero once. It wouldn’t have mattered that your mother died to demonfall. It wouldn’t have mattered if Winchester had been
“Yeah, well, protecting you is
what impresses you?”
Dean grumbles and puts his hand on the little whirlpool to stop it from swirling. The sand clings and plucks at his fingers for a few seconds, but when he looks back down, it's a normal handprint. D. Winchester Was Here, he writes, with his fingertip.  “Uh, we're... not sure about that?” he says. “Every so often there's this popping noise that comes up from under the sand near one of the, uh, tree-things... well, I mean, we weren't exactly gonna hang around to figure out what was coming out of them, but it could be a flame spurt. I guess. Maybe that's what causes the lace things to form. Sam's gonna send you the readings.”
. Dean felt his spine bow into it, pressing down, and opening him back and out. His inner alpha… shit, Dean wasn’t even sure what noise it was his alpha was making inside him, but it was flickering at the back of his throat in sharp little shocked tremors. “And I enjoy it very much. Now
It's not new; there are little cracks in the corners, and some of the gold leaf on the edges has flaked. The binding has split. Someone has read it. It’s well-loved. It’s

fired the first time.”
“I’ll just… I’m going to start cleaning the kitchen,” Cas says stiffly, shoving to his feet with a harsh scrape of chair that makes Grace launch herself off his shoulder, flapping off with an annoyed little yelp. “I’m sure you can see yourself out.”
There’s a loud thump, though Dean doesn’t know it’s from Cas hitting the ground or from
Castiel blinks—then, again.
But Dean’s had a hard life, too. If he wants to spend what might be the last night of his life with his arms around the guy he’s pretty much admitted to himself he’s always wanted to spend his life with… well, there’s probably
Dean blinks twice. Then one more time. “Shit!” he exclaims as blood—blood?—well,
He feels Sam tense beside him. They both know what that gesture means: something’s gone sideways.
Cas smells like the beer he’s been nursing, a hint of toothpaste. His jawline is sweetly rough under Dean’s fingers. He gasps wide-eyed into Dean’s mouth, an
to be an FBI agent—though Cas has clearly stuck his fingers into it, because it’s flipped back-to-front again, and the knot is hanging somewhere at the level of the divot of his collarbone. Which Dean can see, because he unbuttoned the first couple of buttons. His throat is long and bare, and there’s a delicate shadow of strap muscle down the side of it. He doesn’t need a shave yet, but by tomorrow, he definitely will.
“You promise?”
Cas finally manages to get Dean wriggled out of his jacket and flannel, then sets about peeling the blood-soaked t-shirt away from his skin. The wound underneath is just under his ribs, long but clean and not too deep, and Cas offers up an internal thanks for small mercies.
Bobby’s proud of you.”
Dean rolls his head to look up at Cas, blinks at him a little blearily.
Dean chokes a little on the words, then the tears do spill. His vision blurs and he clenches his jaw to keep a sob behind his teeth. He feels Cas touching his cheek, the whisper of a concerned
“I’ve been wearing suits since before you met me Cas, what’s the deal with this one?” He tucks the bags into the back footwell and shuts the door. Close behind him, he hears Cas shuffle his feet on the concrete. He can picture the embarrassed pink flush staining Cas’ cheeks without having to turn around.
when everything is so clearly far from fine digs straight into the fresh cracks across his heart. Based on what happened last night, he’s certain that they’re only trying to protect him. That they don’t want to hurt him with their pain.
He’s whispering into Dean’s skin as he goes,
“Sometimes still feel like I’m…” Dean looks down at their hands, feels the imprint of decades old touches on his fingertips, in his palm. “Dirty. I guess. Like I shouldn’t be touchin’ you ‘cause I’ll just… I’ll. I dunno. Contaminate you or something.”
“Just a headache,” he mumbles. “Didn’t sleep so well.”
“Seems like he’d kind of like to be,” she teases, poking Cas in the ribs.
seeps into him on a low tide of shame and regret so bitter it burns on the back of Castiel’s tongue.
Dean chokes a tiny, wild laugh and Sam’s smile wavers at the edges. Still, he ploughs on.
He goes down hard, back first onto solid concrete. His breath punches out of him like he’s taken a shotgun to the heart.
Cas had handed him the coffee and snuggled into Dean’s side while he drank. The caffeine had just about woken him up enough to wonder why Cas was out of bed before Dean, because getting Cas out of bed early usually required a crowbar, when Cas had taken the coffee mug, planted it on the bedside table, slung his leg over Dean’s waist, shoved his hands down Deans sweats, and kissed him until the only thought in Dean’s head was
Dean rolls off the bed holds his hand out. Cas takes it, smiling, and lets Dean haul him up too. Dean lets go to pull on enough clothes to not give Sam a heart attack if he’s come back and they run into him in the corridor, but Cas twines their fingers back together before they head out the bedroom door. So Dean bumps their arms together as they walk, glances at Cas every couple of seconds, can’t hold in the grin when he catches Cas watching him too.
“He’s still not my boyfriend,” Cas says wearily. He flops down onto his back and drops a hand onto the blanketed rise of Dean’s shoulder. “You’d better fix the lock on your way out, Meg, I’m not getting up to deal with your overenthusiastic foray into breaking and entering.”
Dean laughs softly into the pillow, then he’s asleep.
There’s a silence. Dean lifts his head to look at the stars. Breathes as slowly as he can. Inhales phantom fire and blood.
Besides, there’s nothing
“Don’t you need it?” He eventually says. Somehow his voice comes out level.
Dean chokes on a sob. He grabs Cas by the head, pulls him round and kisses him, hard and desperate. He’s not like Cas, he hasn’t got the words for any of this, but he hopes fiercely that Cas understands what he wishes he knew how to tell him.
Dean flounders in the face of the question. What answer can he possibly give that isn’t just
He shoves his hands deeper into his coat pockets, bows his head into the godawful, knifing wind, and trudges grimly through the deepening snow after Dean.
“You sure this is going to help you rebuild the cosmic warding? Cause this book looks like a fuckin’ slog, man.”
The girls dissolve into giggles again. They’re so loud this time that the librarian stands and comes over, berating them in hushed tones. Though they’re chastened, the girls still exchange glances and one of them jerks her thumb towards Castiel before pulling a mocking, exaggeratedly serious expression.
He can tell himself that with all the bravado he wants. There’s a small, shameful part of him whose pulse beats rabbit-fast with the conviction that Naomi will still somehow find him out.
“You… can’t you just take a picture of the lake?”
“Hey, so Cas, I’ve always wondered.” Dean’s cranes to look over his shoulder at Castiel. The cold grey afternoon light filtering through the dingy curtains is painting the motel room in drab shades of beige and brown, but his eyes are somehow still so bright and green that Cas has to remind himself to breathe. “I could never figure out why it’s wings, and even now I’ve met you I ain’t got a clue.”
“Sure, Cas is cute,” she says, and he nods gravely.
Two days, three exorcised wardrobes and one very pissed off necromancer with a talent for binding ghosts into inanimate objects later, they’re finally back in the bunker. Sam’s got bruises up his entire back where he got thrown into a wall (again), so he heads for a shower and bed immediately, muttering something about calling Eileen who’s down in Texas on a hunt of her own.
“Let’s go home, Dean.”
Cas gasps sharply, breaks the kiss. He presses his face into Dean’s neck, pants into the hollow of his collarbone. Cas’ fingers grip hard, possessive on Dean’s thighs.
Leather and brown hair and freckles, Castiel thinks, dazed. So his daydreams weren’t daydreams after all.
“Why are you on the roof at 3am?” Cas pauses and Dean can
“Sam made me tell him.” Dean has to whisper it. No matter what he tries, his voice won’t come out louder than the quietest breath. “Tell him what I- what I did. When we were kids. For money. So he- fuck. Fuck, Cas, I can’t say it again, don’t ask me to-“
The fourth time Dean’s had enough of his own idiot brain.
Outside is fresh, crisp with the first snap of autumn hanging faintly in the air. Castiel takes a deep breath. The air is cool this early and it feels cleansing in his lungs. It can’t quite sweep out the pall that’s hung over him since he was pulled from sleep, but it lifts his mood enough that his step is light as he sets off down the street. He takes the more scenic route to school this time, through a small park thick with trees and wildflowers. That helps too, listening to the birds twittering up in the canopy of rustling leaves. By the time he’s stepping back out onto the road he’s almost smiling.
Dean watches the boys’ retreating backs for a long time, until he’s pulled back to himself by Cas hugging him again fiercely.
Cas’ gaze tracks slowly down to look at himself. He’s shivering now, fine tremors rippling over the water.
does it always manage to find every gap in clothing, worm inside to stab into his skin? Of all the things humanity has granted him, the ability to suffer from temperature is one that really wishes he could give back.
Dean tangles his fingers in Cas’ t-shirt, hides his head under Cas’ chin. His nose presses into the line of Cas’ collarbone and he breathes deep on the soft, clean scent of him, on shower gel and laundry detergent and warm skin.
Dean has no fucking clue what to do with it.
“Mm.”
He swallows his
Cas is up off the bed and across the room before Dean can do more than draw in a shaky breath.
“Fine, Jesus, okay.” He toes his shoes off, shuffles out of his jeans and shirt, slides under the duvet in his t-shirt and boxers. As soon as his body touches the mattress, Cas literally feels him sag with relief at lying down, curling into the giving softness. Cas would grab his hand and hug him in close if he had the energy, but Dean reads his mind without him having to move. He snuggles up to Cas’ back and tucks an arm around him, nose pressing into the back of his neck.
His chest hurts like someone’s cracked his ribs open, throat burns all too much like the fire of Metatron draining his grace from his neck, but he’s alive.
He hasn’t even told Cas about that. Cas must know, he’s been inside Dean’s head often enough to have seen every miserable millimetre of his history in close-up detail, but the idea of giving it voice makes Dean want to crawl out of his skin.
Cas opens the tube of antiseptic, squeezes some out and daubs it over the stitches.
“Constantly. But especially when you’re dressed like that.”
The air punches out of Dean’s lungs. His eyelids flutter and Cas grins, the edges of it turning self-satisfied, so Dean grabs handfuls of Cas’ hair and kisses him filthy and hot until Cas is gasping and shuddering, all traces of
Cas’s fingers clench into Dean’s shirt. He makes another noise, longer and lower, jerks minutely up into Dean’s body. Heat unfurls low in Dean’s stomach.
blocking his throat. His voice comes out weak and wavering. “It’s like you’re praying, I… I can’t, I don’t deserve…”
So yeah. Dean spends a lot of his time having internal crises before his idiot head works itself out.
This year, though, the mundanity of it feels less unbearably tedious; the isolation of it less a wasteland of loneliness. When the hockey captain shoulder checks him into a locker, when the cattier girls smirk and whisper behind their hands as he passes, he can reach out inside like reaching out with his hand, and his soulmate always answers. And it’s not just a one-way street. More and more his soulmate will reach out first, offering and asking for contact as freely as Castiel himself.
So it’s been nearly three weeks. Three weeks of being so disgustingly affectionate that Sam’s threatened to hose them with cold water more than once. Three weeks since Dean tried to give Cas space, let him sleep in his own room at least at first till they can figure out exactly where this is taking them. But then Dean couldn’t sleep for fear he’d dreamt the rescue, and when he went to stick his head round Cas’ door and check he was really there he’d bumped into Cas in the corridor instead, eyes red and hands shaking with
dropped onto his body with every kiss. He sounds so fucking
Dean’s breath stutters raggedly out. Cas rocks them together and Dean keens a little, breath catching on every slip of skin on skin, tension coiling in his spine with every touch of Cas’ fingertips.
. And sometimes when you touched me, I could hear it inside you, like it was singing to me. I do miss that.”
“Not much of a gun guy, huh?” Dean ribs gently. He bumps Castiel softly with his elbow and Castiel swallows hard as a tingle from the brief contact runs through him.
“Okay? Cas? Okay?”
It’s only when Dean casually glances at his watch about six in the evening, debating whether it’s time to make a start on dinner, that he finally clocks the date.
“Double up on breakfast, Dean, Eileen likes waffles too.”
in Dean and Cas. Some things are easy as breathing. Learning to touch rather than hold back. Curling into each other on the sofa on movie night. Dragging each other into random corners of the bunker where Sam won’t walk in and kissing like giddy teenagers hiding out from their parents. Holding hands on the seat while Dean drives. Sam has started threatening to travel in his own car so he doesn’t have to
It happens on a perfectly ordinary August day. Castiel spent most of it in the library, getting ahead on the reading for the new term. He’s going into junior year and he needs to do well. Only two years left of high school, then a good college far from here will be his ticket out from under Naomi’s thumb. He can finally choose what he wants to do with his life. Study something interesting, not meekly follow Naomi’s shoving towards a career in law. Maybe even reach out to the few brothers who weren’t utter bastards his whole childhood, try to rebuild some sort of family.
Then walks straight into Dean.
with women. Men, for so long it was always. Not. I had to. I didn’t get to.” He stops. Gulps down the nausea.
Snapping the lamp on, Castiel holds his arm out to the light and examines his wrist. Despite the deep ache in his bones, it looks completely normal, the skin unblemished. Unnerved, he flexes his arm cautiously. His arm moves freely and the pain stays the same. Even when he presses his fingertips into the sorest spot just under his thumb it remains nothing but a dull echo under his skin.
When they arrive Meg heads for the counter, but before she’s two steps in someone pops up at a table to her left and waves manically.
Not dead, but turns out moving house is exhausting. Who'd have thought. So Cas and Dean just spent their time packed in a moving box finding even more ways to be soft with each other.
And. He’s always heard that having a soulmate near makes a person feel warm. Safe. Complete.
“Cas still isn’t my boyfriend!” Dean yells and Meg rolls her eyes for what feels like the hundredth time this trip.
For all that they’ve wavered on the edge of this, things move quickly then. Dean pops Cas’ buttons, pushes his shirt off his shoulders, skims his hands up the rising blush painting Cas’ skin rosy, while Cas fumbles at Dean’s clothes, clumsy with impatience, tugging him towards the bed by the collar. Dean has to let go of Cas for a moment to yank his boots off. The second he’s done Cas is hauling him upright and tumbling them back onto the mattress with eleven years of intent burning in his eyes.
Cas squints at him, a little confused and uncertain.
Dean stops over Cas’ hipbone. He hovers there, looking up at Cas through lowered eyes, slips his hand under Cas’ shirt to glide softly up his stomach. Cas groans and shoves himself upright, reaching for Dean.
This year Castiel is drawn to the window earlier than usual. There’s a good ten minutes until midnight and the sky outside is black and empty. Still, Castiel is jittery, excited. His soulmate is sparkling tonight, all boundless energy and impatient anticipation. Something must be about to happen, and even though he has no idea what Castiel loves sharing their delight, loves how unashamed they are of their joy.
understands.
Castiel blinks. He wasn’t expecting that. All the way home he was bracing himself for an evening under Naomi’s eye, another awkward dinner opposite her icy gaze, his usual discomfort ratcheted up by the secret lurking under his sweater sleeve. But if Naomi’s out…
None of that stops him listening to the pull wherever he goes for any sign that he’s getting closer, but it’s more for the love of feeling that bond than with any expectation of it leading him anywhere.
Dean doesn’t notice his hesitation. Now that he’s started talking, it’s as if he can’t bring himself to stop. Behind the ache of Dean’s words sinking into him, Castiel wonders distantly how much of that is their bond tugging at Dean, letting him know that he
And from what this article is telling him, it was the strength of them both longing, reaching for each other at the same time, that woke their bond. The thought twitches a tiny smile at the corner of his mouth. However frightening it had been, whatever else it might bring, this means his soulmate wants Castiel just as much as Castiel wants
His absolute horror at the suggestion must show in his eyes because Sam interrupts his train of thought.
“Dean,” he says, deadpan. “Personal space? We’ve talked about this.”
Dean’s voice cracks. His head drops down to rest on Cas’ hair. Cas feels Dean’s whole body shudder against him.
The sudden desire to touch Cas blooms in Dean’s stomach. He curls his fingers in, cradles the fragile seedling of need in his palm as Cas helps him into a clean t-shirt and eases his jeans down. Cas’ touch is so gentle on his bare legs that Dean nearly collapses into him then and there, but he digs his fingernails into his palms until the cut of pain is sharp enough to keep him upright.
What if they don’t like him? What if he says something stupid and embarrassing and they laugh at him? All this time they’ve felt nothing but kind, but they don’t really know Castiel yet. What if they only see the awkward weirdo that everyone else does?
“This is something that
Then Castiel rolls his eyes. “You heard me. We might not be that into public displays of affection, but it’s still quite common for couples to kiss in public. And since we’re married…”
Still mad then. He shouldn’t have hoped for anything else, considering.
Cas presses all of himself up against Dean’s side during the film. He turns into Dean’s side, tucks his leg in between Dean’s and slips his hand up Dean’s shirt to rest on his stomach. Dean knows Sam’s noticed from the tiny eyeroll he catches out of the corner of his eye, but Sam doesn’t even wrinkle his nose at them. He just rests his head on Eileen’s shoulder and smiles, warm and content.
“Let’s get those bloody clothes off, and then you’re going to bed, Dean. No arguments.”
Dean can’t argue with that. He drops one more kiss onto Cas’ nose before slipping off Cas’ lap and swinging his legs round to grapple with his laces. Cas follows him as if he’s drawn by an invisible tether between them. Cas yanks off his own boots in seconds – for a moment Dean’s brain is sidetracked by
Distantly, he lifts his other hand, presses a fingertip to the familiar-unfamiliar line of colour around his wrist. It doesn’t feel any different. Even to his numbed senses it still feels barely raised from the rest of his skin, a slender line like a healed scar. How is it that it can be so fundamentally altered but still feel the same as it always has? Even looking at it shakes something loose inside Castiel, makes him feel raw and new and unknown to himself inside his own skin, and yet it’s still there under his touch, the same as it’s been every day for nearly seventeen years.
And he fixes Dean with the look that will make Dean do literally anything he asks. So Dean takes it.
but Dean does keep rubbing his hands over Cas’ shoulders and kissing his forehead, his temple, his cheek, and he really doesn’t want Dean to stop.
A hand appears in his vision, takes him gently by the chin to pull his head around. Dean is leaning towards him over the side of the bath.
He feels like he was just made whole, without ever realising he’d spent his entire life cut in half.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel hovers by the door, awkwardly uncertain of what to do with himself. The space is poky, barely room enough for two double beds, a rickety table and two chairs, tv on a sideboard and an excuse for a kitchenette behind a lattice screen. A door beside the fridge is ajar, showing a glimpse of an even more cramped bathroom. There’s no sofa, or anywhere comfortable to sit that isn’t one of the beds. As he’d thought, there’s a worn old blanket over the window to keep out the worst of the chill.
To his surprise there’s no response. Dean glances round. Cas is staring at him, eyes round, pupils eating most of the blue.
“Here.” Cas touches his wrist softly, then slips off the bed. “Let me.”
The smile breaks irresistibly over Cas’ face.
, the guy had throttled him until he’d nearly blacked out. How he’d got Dean’s jeans and underwear around his ankles before Dean had been able to get at his knife. How he’d thrown up in an alley after he got away, hidden in baby’s footwell and cried into his hands, shivering and alone and sucking harsh breaths through the bruises on his throat. How he hadn’t been able to bear
me, I can’t take, I can’t, not when we’re, I’m not
“Of course you didn’t know!” Dean shoves at Sam’s hands, swallows around the thick sickness in his throat, “I made
As the minutes tick by their excitement amps up even further. By the time there’s two minutes left Castiel feels almost drunk himself, heady on second-hand delight. Pulse fluttering, he keeps an eye on his watch and counts down the last seconds.
It could be five seconds or five lifetimes before Dean pulls away. He plants one more brief kiss on Cas’ cheekbone then he’s gone, back at the counter sorting groceries like he didn’t just pull all the air out of Cas’ lungs and send him reeling.
Then the guy shoves Cas so hard Cas stumbles and Dean snaps into motion.
“What’s the matter with you?” Naomi snaps over breakfast, and Castiel jumps. His coffee slops over the back of his hand. It’s barely hot enough to hurt, but he seizes the excuse to turn his back to her and run his hand under the cold tap.
Dean’s eyes widen. “Marks!” He exclaims, so loudly Castiel jumps. “Holy fuck, the first thing soulmates are meant to show each other and we haven’t even talked about them.”
Yeah, that’s about what Meg expected. Still, she can feel a headache coming on in her temple just hearing it.
“So how was
Oh. Interesting. Despite that slight unsettled hint in its tone, Meg can’t help but feel a little pleased at his answer. But still. She wouldn’t be her if she didn’t push.
Dean fists Cas’ shirt, yanks him in. He loses himself for a second in the scrape of Cas’ stubble on his cheek, the solid strength of his muscles under Dean’s palms. Then Cas’ hands are on his jeans, popping the button, wrenching down the zip and all of Dean’s awareness focuses down into the brush of Cas’ knuckles over his dick.
Castiel glances down at his aching foot and a bubble of disbelieving astonishment rises and bursts in his chest. Did they… did they feel that he was hurting?
Turning back towards Dean, Cas rises up on his knees until they’re face to face. He rests his palms lightly on Dean’s chest, fingertips brushing the buttons of his open flannel. One of his hands slides up to catch onto Dean’s collar and tug the tiniest bit to the side. Cas tips his head fractionally. The movement is so small it could be inconsequential, but Dean recognises the question in it. The careful
“Dean, if you put your back out I will have
He’s twisting his ring round his finger with his thumb, and Castiel’s briefly distracted wondering if that’s a nervous habit. It’s actually rather sweet. From his first look at Dean’s appearance, his beaten-up old boots and battered leather jacket and the way he holds himself to look bigger than he is, Castiel wouldn’t have placed him as at all anxious or shy. It had startled him at first, how at odds his bearing was with the way his emotions have always felt inside Castiel’s heart, but this, this nervous softness peeking through the façade, feels infinitely closer to the truth.
Balthazar chokes on his bite of waffle. Meg drops her fork. Charlie makes a small, delighted noise and claps her hand over her mouth.
“The lavender’s nice?” He says cautiously, not quite sure how to move the conversation forward now without just coming out with
The guy pushes Cas again and Cas falls properly this time, landing with a surprised
He drops his forehead onto Cas’ hair. In response Cas takes his hand and twines their fingers together. He rests their joined hands on his thigh and closes his eyes.
the way they act with each other?”
“Yeah I know,” Dean replies and Cas grabs him by the collar and kisses him, hard and fast in the middle of the sidewalk. A passerby huffs at them, but Dean could not give less of a fuck. He just catches onto Cas’ elbow, his hair, leans in.
“Cas?”
Halfway down the corridor Cas squeezes his fingers. He fixes Dean with a knowing stare and presses his fingertips into the pulse point of Dean’s wrist. “Were you trying to seduce me with bacon and honey ice cream?”
Dean rolls his eyes. “I’m not suggesting any Michelin star bullshit, they wouldn’t let us in dressed like this anyway. Just something with table service where the floors aren’t greasy.”
evening, Cassie?” He asks with a calculated leer. “From what I saw, you and loverboy there had the most
Cas is still not enlightened as to why this warrants extended staring. “Okay?” He agrees, perplexed.
So Dean lifts a shoulder in acknowledgement, not saying no but clearly not saying yes either. He can see Sam’s disappointment in the slight droop of Sam’s back, but he’s too weary to care. All he wants to do is flee to his room, flee to where Cas is and just curl up beside him until the icy pain memory has frozen into his ribcage melts under warmth of Cas’ glow.
“It wasn’t-“ Cas shakes his head abortively. “It’s hard to put words to it, translate it to human sensations. The pain was in my true form, in my wings. It was nothing like the pain of a human body.” He looks down at the glow of grace escaping from their clasped hands. “There’s a disease humans can get. A bacteria. It releases toxins that make a person feel like their flesh is being eaten alive. It’s the closest analogy I can find. Just slower. It was a constant thing, for a long time.”
It’s not pale and plain any more. It’s the faintest shifting rainbow of colour.
which Dean
Cas presses his hand onto Dean’s shoulder and Dean cuts off mid-flail. Breathes in once. Twice.
Fortunately for her, Balthazar takes just as much delight as she does in winding up the happy couple and the definitely-not-a-couple both.
“Fuck, Cas,
tucks Cas into bed. The mattress is so soft and welcoming that Cas is asleep before Dean’s even turned out the lamp.
Then they head to the nearest café for lunch.
Turning, Castiel finds Naomi standing in the archway between the kitchen and dining room, immaculate as always in a crisp grey suit. He proffers a small smile and quickly takes a sip of his water to cover how strained his face feels trying to fake the expression. Naomi smiles fractionally in return. Her eyes stay cool.
This man, this person who used to be a celestial being beyond mortal comprehension, who was crafted by god himself, however much of an arsehole
Castiel nods and heads for the stairs. He can sense her eyes fixed on his back as he crosses the hall, so he keeps his steps deliberately casual despite the fluttering of his pulse. He half expects her to call him back, demand an explanation for his behaviour, but she doesn’t. He makes it up the stairs and into his room, and the thin barrier of the door between him and the rest of the house is enough for him to truly exhale for the first time since the coffee mishap.
As soon as they’re through the bedroom door Cas turns and shoves Dean against it, pins Dean’s hands above his head and kisses him open-mouthed and hungry. Dean pushes his hips up into Cas’ and the groan he gets in answer lights liquid fire in his veins.
Then something stirs under his ribs and Castiel’s meandering thoughts stutter to an abrupt halt. It’s a foreign touch, a brush of someone else across his heart. Strange and entirely familiar all at once. The same as back in the library.
Meg isn’t one for crushes – ridiculous high school behaviour – but this one,
For a few long minutes Dean just basks in that heat, kissing across Cas’ cheekbones, smoothing his hand down Cas’ chest, into the dip of his waist, luxuriates in the warmth spreading slow and heady through his limbs. Cas keeps making involuntary, breathy noises, sighing into Dean’s skin, and Dean drinks them in, feeds them to the growing fire in his chest.
always here for you to talk to. Not just about this, about anything.” Sam squeezes Dean’s elbow one last time and drops his hand. “Anything at all.”
How Cas will card his fingers through Dean’s hair when Dean’s got his mouth on him, but he never grabs hold, never pulls, never pushes himself in.
Meg throws her hands up. “There is nothing,
Meg, Benny and Balthazar pick up the occasional date each, nothing serious – Bal has someone on his arm more often than not, but it’s rarely the same person twice. Charlie gets together with a girl called Stevie around Christmas and falls hard and fast. Between them and Dean and Cas, Meg feels a little as if she’s living in a romcom.
“My…what?” Dean frowns. He always figured his soul must be a painful thing to behold, tarnished with a lifetime of wrong choices and wrongdoing, of mistakes and selfishness and death. But the way Cas talks about it, anyone would think he’s made of starlight.
“Sorry Meg,” he says with a gentle smile, “but I’m already spoken for.”
The recognition wraps a frail tether around his wrist, grounds him enough to realise he’s not dead, he’s not in the empty.
is haunted. Pulling her absurd story out of her is more for fun than because it’s a lead, but it’s making Dean happy so Cas leaves him to it.
His fingers touch lightly to Castiel’s elbow and Cas turns in response, slows his step so he can watch Dean without losing his footing on the slippery ground. Dean’s still not quite looking at him, but his touch hangs on Castiel’s arm and he leans slightly towards him, close enough Castiel can feel the warmth of Dean’s breath faint on his cheek. When Dean speaks his voice is low, confiding.
The curly-haired girl two tables over barely bothers to lower her voice. In the still of the library her derisive words carry as easily as if she’d spoken them aloud. The other girls huddled around her table giggle and shove at her shoulders, casting unsubtle glances sideways at Castiel through their eyelashes.
Next to him he hears Cas inhale sharply, then Cas’ hand lands on his thigh, squeezes. He flicks his eyes across to meet Cas’ blazing gaze. Seals the promise with a smile and an answering press of his hand.
His voice cracks on the curves of the words. He smiles at Cas but it’s brittle, the edges splintering.
Sam’s grip finally looses from Dean’s arm. There’s another pause as Sam runs both his hands through his hair and Dean tries to piece himself back together enough to let go of Sam and push himself upright without crumbling apart again.
Cas doesn’t seem to have these hangups. Every time he touches Dean it’s with this ravenous reverence, like he can’t get enough, like he could touch Dean forever and it would still be new.
Still, everything is organised and clean. Both the beds are made, there’s no clothes strewn around. Even the washing up is done and stacked neatly on the draining board. Castiel can’t help a frisson of surprise at that in a space inhabited by two teenage boys. But then, he reflects wretchedly, if Dean’s been keeping house for an absent father since he had to stand on a chair to reach the sink, it really
“I know I shouldn’t freak out,” Dean says. “But… I just. I don’t wanna-“ He sniffs and rubs his face. “Don’t want him to be disappointed.”
Sam looks down at him with an expression somewhere between exasperated and devastated.
“I knew.” He mutters.
“You,” he accuses to Cas’ mouth, close enough their lips touch. Cas twitches a little, mouth opening and eyes flicking down to Dean’s lips. Dean ghosts their mouths together, the lightest brush. Feels Cas’ chest rise against his own in expectation. “You,” Dean repeats, “are still wearing too many clothes.”
“Of course, bread is bad for ducks.”
Dean shrinks against the wall. The cold of the stone is all too similar to other walls from lifetimes ago and his body shudders viscerally. He pulls in a breath. It catches in his throat like a sob.
But it’s also
this is something beyond the love Dean’s used to from the few times in his life he’s had anything to compare. This isn’t like Lisa, this isn’t like his mother. This isn’t anything like Sam. This is absolute. This is unfaltering. This is devotion on a scale that burns like a blasphemy because Dean is not, has never been, never will be worth anything
When they break apart Cas tightens his hold on Dean’s collar, keeps him close enough to brush their noses together.
“Distracting, huh?”
“Why this?” Castiel whispers, turning his hand to compare the shifting green of his mark to the real amulet’s dull bronze sheen.
might relate to his person, but it’s warming to know that their connection was always strong enough for Castiel to know it’s a part of them.
“He has to be, right?” The girl leans forward, conspiratorial. “Can you imagine anyone wanting that weirdo?”
catches Castiel’s eye in the article and he slows his scroll. He doesn’t remember mark colours coming up in any of his classes, other than the obvious fact that colour comes with activation. He’d never considered that it might mean something deeper.
Dean doesn’t look round. Just watches his feet hanging in the air over the edge of the bunker roof. Swings his legs a little.
It’s been a couple of weeks since they brought Cas back from the empty. Since Cas answered Dean’s clumsy
Cas scoffs and elbows Dean, who fake winces and leans away, opening his eyes wide and plastering his face in a comically overdone expression of betrayal. And Cas laughs. Serious, grave Castiel who didn’t even twitch a smile when Meg told her best joke back in the lecture, honest to God
Sophomore year rolls around and Dean and Cas get an apartment together. It’s a two bed, so for the first few weeks the ribbing dies down. Maybe they really are just friends. Super close friends who share drinks with two straws and are incapable of standing further than a couple of inches apart even in an empty room. But if they don’t share a bedroom there can’t be anything there, right?
Cas chuckles quietly. His breath tickles and Dean has to shove him off to focus before his dick hijacks his higher brain functions and he ends up trying to get back to what they were doing with his jeans still tying his ankles together.
Cas fixes his gaze on Dean’s boots instead and keeps pushing onwards. His thighs are burning with the uphill effort, the heat of the pain an uncomfortable counterpoint to the frigid air biting into his lungs. Surely it can’t be that much further?
“How much did it hurt?” Dean asks cautiously, half wanting to understand Cas pain, half horrified to even think about it.
“Dean, what-”
“It was September eighteenth twelve years ago. In that barn in Illinois.”
He blinks himself more alert, feels the concern rise inside.
Breathe in. Breathe out.
Dean shoves at him, twists against the press of Sam’s hands, grabs Sam’s shirt and tries to throw him off. Panic makes him clumsy, clawing uselessly to get away.
“And if the Gate has already closed when it hits?”
“Nothing,” Cas answers, after a thoughtful moment. “Dune’s an ecologically interesting series. Though for science fiction, I prefer space opera…”
Dean) wiggles closer eagerly. Dean sighs and lets the damned thing grab his foot. "Some people believe that there are other worlds, other places. Where things are the same, but different. For example, a world where I was born like you, with just two legs.”
“You know,” Cas tells him, and Dean's pet sea-arm (Cas named it that,

with all the weight and wonder of millennia of unswerving faith.
Dean turns and finally sets off across the carpark, aiming for the door at the far end of the block. Castiel follows him, noting as they draw close that the curtains are drawn over the windows of the room Dean’s aiming for, and it looks like a blanket’s been pinned up over them too. Probably to try and insulate a room that’s too cold, Castiel thinks, and swallows down his heartache at the thought.
idea.
“What do you think Cas, do I look intimidatingly professional?”
Castiel’s mouth is dry. His hands are shaking too hard to control. His legs feel like water. Somehow he still manages to make himself turn.
“Dean.” Cas interrupts, and this time his name comes short and exasperated, but underpinned with a current of unmistakable adoration. “How many times do I have to tell and show you that you’re the
“I’m Dean,” green eyes says as he leans his head to rest on Cas’ hair. “Me and Cas know each other from back home in Kansas.”
And here, blanketed in Cas’ body, with Cas’ hands on his skin, in the bed they’ve chosen to share, for the first time in a long time, he actually thinks he might be.
Cas mouths at the air, grabs at it. It slips away.
to having nothing. So why on this birthday does he feel so deeply alone?
Sure enough, the sales assistant is curt and unhelpful at checkout. Dean just swipes his card, gives her his best devastating smile as he takes the bag and receipt.
Cas can barely feel his fingers. His face feels almost raw. How can wind be so cold that it cuts like a blade? And
, on the other hand, is a dick.”
Dean glances up at him and grins, eyes shining.
So Cas just rests his head against Dean’s chest. Breathes.
Dean never knows how Cas can always tell he’s awake.
“Morning sweetheart,” Dean says.
Dean’s heart softens and he has to plant another kiss on Cas’ cheek. “I will, I promise.”
Dean tips his head back a little to look up at Cas. The light creeping under the door from the hall grants the barest illumination that catches on the contours of Cas’ face, outlines the shape of him in tones of deepest midnight. Cas' breath is soft and even across Dean’s cheek. His arm lies lax over Dean’s side, fingers loosely looped into the hem of Dean’s t-shirt.
Dean doesn’t have time for pretending.
And it’s not that he doesn’t return the feeling. He
“I mean it,” Cas breathes against Dean’s mouth. “Even when it’s clumsy and awkward it’s perfect, because it’s you.” His hand slips down to grab Dean’s ass and pull him flush against Cas’ body. “But if you don’t get those goddamn boots off right now, I might have to revise that opinion.”
Dean’s stomach clenches. Fuck, he’d hoped Sam had forgotten that part.
No matter what state of angry rejection they get into, no matter how on the outs they are, Dean never wants to hear that particular inflection of his name ever again.
said anything positive about his appearance before, let alone come close to calling him
Naomi already has her phone in hand and all her focus on the screen. She doesn’t even nod in answer as she strides for the front door.
He wants to apologise, to tell Dean he didn’t mean to. But his lungs ache, and his hands are shaking and every breath feels like it’s scraping the inside of his chest raw.
“Well, I know you’re not from here or it wouldn’t have taken us so long to find each other.” Castiel tries to make it come out light despite how little he likes the brief brush of directionless longing he gets from Dean. He doesn’t know where that hurt’s coming from, but he already wants to soothe it away. “What’s your story, Dean?”
Then it makes him crushingly sad. How can this be their life? No matter how happy they are sometimes, how brimming over with humour and affection, it feels utterly wretched and Castiel’s not even the one living it.
Cas looks up from his pile of research, back down at where his bandaged knee is propped on a pillow surrounded by ice packs.
“Hey there sweetheart.” He runs his fingers through Cas’ sopping hair, combing it off his face. “How are you feeling?”
“You kids all right?” Dean makes himself tear his eyes away from Cas to look at the two boys. Check on them. They’re still leaning on the wall, but they’re not clinging so hard to each other and they’re staring up at him and Cas with a kind of astonished wonder.
“Dean!”
“I’ve always wondered what it’d be.” Dean steps even closer, so near their arms brush, his eyes fixated on Castiel’s hands. “I thought maybe a bullet, or a rifle. That’d make sense.”
Cas hooks his leg over Dean’s knee, tucks his bare foot into the back of Dean’s calf and pulls them tight together. He rests one of his hands on Dean’s side, thumb smoothing over jut of Dean’s hip. His other arm is trapped under Dean’s head, so he just curls his hand up to comb idle fingers through the downy hair behind Dean’s ear.
, he’s not letting Sam go there. It’s bad enough that Sam had to discover this whole clusterfuck at all without him thinking
“What the
One morning Dean unlocks his main phone to check a text from Sam and finds his own background picture has changed. Now it’s him sitting on baby’s bonnet, beer in hand and face turned to the side, laughing as he talks to Sam perching beside him. Eileen is tucked under Sam’s arm, smiling up at his face, and Cas is leaning against Dean, head resting on his shoulder and their hands entwined between them.
“What’s yours?” He asks. Dean’s hand comes up to touch the amulet again and Castiel’s eyes track the motion. Unconsciously he brushes his fingers over his own mark in a mirror of Dean’s movement.
From the way Cas is looking at Dean through half-closed lids, dilated pupils tracking his own hand as is trails lightly up Dean’s arm, across his chest, down his ribs to his stomach, he seems to be feeling something similar.
like he had to, because the goodest celestial pillar of light wanted to help. Because he believed humans deserved saving from Hell and from damnation on Earth (even when they didn’t). Because the fucking little optimist kept believing in a world that, over and over, had shown that it didn’t believe in him.
Angel growled inside his head. Behind him, Castiel heard her snarl aloud again—much louder, this time, deeply enough to rattle all the way through Castiel’s bones. The brown fire lizard darted back into the caves, squeaking with alarm.
“In times when older riders were needed because Hellgates were opening faster than the Candidates were maturing, Dean,” Castiel answered through clenched teeth. “You know this just as well as I do. Yes, there are gates opening rapidly, but they’ve been at a predictable rate lately.”
,” Dean said, and squeezed his eyes shut. “I can’t. I…

, they’re doing this.
There was a speckle or two of frost in the dark hair at Cas’s temples that Dean didn’t remember. He had eyebags under his blue eyes and lines at the corners of them. The jeans were flattering as hell, and the way he was wearing that shirt really wasn’t.
That’s sitting on Cas’s shoulder.
. He almost pulled away, but he held himself there by tension and gumption alone. The edge of the tub wasn’t cold against his hand anymore.
“Please
“I couldn’t either,” Cas says. It’s just barely louder than a whisper. Dean leans closer to hear him rather than turning up the volume. He wonders what time it is, but he can’t be bothered to do the math right now. “I heard what… I’m so sorry. Is everyone else safe?”
There was

“I… would… should I send flowers? To her mother? Would that be… that would be weird? I know I’m not a hunter, but… but I’d like to do something.” Cas’s quiet earnestness is like warm water on those swollen hands. Hunters aren’t invisible to him, interchangeable, the way they are to so many of the people they meet. Cas had talks with Jo about her
Roughly two minutes later Sam replied Be down soon dude
When work ended, he grabbed his keys putting his jacket back on. He always took it off during work.
After a few more minutes of thinking about things, he started the drive back home. He hummed along to the music. It was a peaceful drive once he got out of the city and into the less busy area of where he lived with Lisa. Soon enough he was home when it was just about 7.
"Dean I'm home!" Lisa called walking into the bedroom and she saw all of Dean's thing in boxes. "What's going on?"
When he walked back into the house, he felt incredibly guilty. He was going to be a father and his response to his pregnant girlfriend was to run. His heart was pounding in his chest but he was calmer now.
Instead of crying or getting angry she pulled him into his arms "It's okay Dean. I understand. It's not fair to either of us for you to stay."
Dean nodded holding up the boxset "I think Charlotte will be happy with me."
"Give me five more minutes," Sam replied
Dean went into the back room and waited for his first customer to arrive. He looked down at the photographs that were taken over the weekend. Ellen always made the pictures look amazing but she praised his work more.
The rest of the afternoon was one of the best ones Dean had in a while. He started making dinner around 5:45 knowing Lisa would be home around 6. Turning on the radio he decided to make pasta with meat sauce. It was good comfort food that he could definitely use.
“Really?” Dean smiled widely “That’s huge man. I’m happy for you.”
The day we kissed for the last time I had no idea it would be our last kiss
It didn’t take long for him to finish. He sat down on the bed grabbing his laptop he decided to watch a movie just something to prevent his brain from racing. It was helping then he heard Lisa’s car. He quickly paused the movie standing up. Time to face the music.
He deiced on a cloud background before setting up the green screen. Taking pictures of her was rather fun. She was able to do plenty of different poses with different facial expressions. Then they were finished and he showed her the pictures on the computer.
Dean felt his heart skip a beat. Cas wanted to see him. At their place, they used to go all the time after classes or just to have dates together. It was the first coffee place he ever took Cas to. The both of them always considered it their place and Tessa always adored them coming in. He wondered if she still worked there.
Sam shook his head "Well it's different. These aren't too big to carry."
Sam nodded walking with Dean to the subway station near his apartment talking about his latest work he was doing at the natural history museum. Dean didn't understand most of the stuff Sam talked about but he knew he was proud of his little brother. Dean had gone to school for photography and was lucky enough to get a job at the New York Times but once he met Lisa and moved in with her, he started working at a family portrait studio. It wasn't where his passion was but it paid the bills along with Lisa's job as a nurse at the local clinic in their town.
Dean gulped looking at her “Shit. I’m sorry.”
She kissed his cheek but didn't say anything else as he let her hold him. In all honesty, Lisa was better than he deserved. She was far too kind to him. Everything he told her she did her best to understand and not pass judgment.
It was clear to Dean what Lisa was doing now. She was memorizing him. He took a deep breath. It was nice. His eyes closed and he touched the tattoo for Sam which was two children holding each other in a simple heart. That one was definitely a favorite of his. There were others he felt her touching and he let her. When she finished, he took a deep breath letting it sink in. Letting her sink in one last time. Slowly he stood up getting dressed then he went to the kitchen getting coffee started.
Memories he tried desperately to shove deep down. They were kept locked away for a reason. Never becoming a part of his life again.
I saw him for the first time in Central Park while he was taking photographs
When he arrived at Sam's apartment his brother was waiting for him. He got out of the car going to hug Sam.
With that he went into his car and started driving, he gripped the stirring wheel staying calm as best he could. It was over. He didn't have to pretend anymore. Without realizing it he started laughing. He felt so relieved. Even if he was seeing Cas tomorrow, he was okay. Leaving Lisa didn't hurt as much as he thought it would. Things were going to be better now. Even if Cas didn't take him back, he could move on more easily. At least that was what he hoped.
Dean felt his face grow hot looking down at his shoes "I'm flattered really but I have a girlfriend with a baby on the way. Thank you though."
Once he had his keys in his hands, he closed the door and went to his car. His baby. She was a beautiful 1967 black Chevy Impala 327 and he loved her. He considered her his pride and joy. Grabbing his box of mixed he started flipping through them when he saw one, he thought he had gotten rid of. It was titled Cas and Dean's epic mixtape 2010. God. That was ten years ago. It had been ten years since he saw Cas face to face. Often, he wondered what became of the person who had meant the world to him. Sure, he could always track him down through social media or something like that but he had a feeling Cas probably blocked him on everything or wouldn't want to hear from him.
When he got into his car, he put his face in his hands sighing quietly. Everything felt too much. Heavy. It felt as though the world was resting on his shoulders. His eyes closed tightly and he tried to relax. There was no way he could go into work like this especially when his friend Jo would ask him more questions than he could answer.
"Why? I know we haven't spent that much time together but that can change-" She started but Dean cut it off despite knowing it was rude
Dean felt tears fill his eyes but he kept reading. Each poem was more amazing than the last but each made him feel full of regret. God. He missed Cas so much. The final poem was titled "The last time I saw him." Dean wanted to stop reading but like a fool, he did read it
even though he was scared out of his mind he forced himself to stop crying. He wasn’t going to leave his kid. That was the last thing he was going to do. Of course, he might not end up with Lisa but he wanted to be there for the both of them as best he could.
Dean sighed heavily looking down at his hands. It was Friday now, and he was currently at work. He hadn't slept properly in days. His brain kept doing mental gymnastics. Tonight, he would be breaking up with Lisa. He knew it would be hard, but he had to do this. It was a lot harder than leaving Cas in some ways. He had left Cas on an impulse, but this was something he had planned out for weeks.
when crossed, especially where Sam was concerned. He’d never thrown a punch at Castiel, but Castiel wouldn’t put it past his best friend—not when it came to this. Dean’s whole body shook once, and his hands were in tight fists in his lap.
“Maybe we should keep going?” Sam says softly, his voice coming out strangely muffled and heavy. “We could maybe get more range on the protection circle if you’re closer…”
This time, Dean laughs. “Cas, I don’t think that’s gonna be a problem.” He grins shakily up at the ceiling and skates a hand down his belly, feeling those muscles tighten up as he skims along the waistband of his boxers. “You up to try?”
They all stepped back as Riot spread his wings, mantling them in two flaps before settling them into takeoff position, half-open by his sides as he prepared to start running. Castiel had to reach out and drag Dean back by the arm as Riot’s hindquarters bunched and he leapt forward, kicking up a thick spray of dirt behind him as he charged into his run. The rest of the Weyr residents who’d come to watch despite the summer heat cheered loudly.

by days and days of surprise home-cooked meals, and he shakes his head at his own selfishness.
“Yeah, of course, buddy,” Dean agrees, and lets himself be rearranged onto his back. If Cas wants to lie on top while they’re making out, Dean is A-okay with that, for sure.
had already begun flying scouting missions. And no matter how small Lollipop was—and he really was a very small blue dragon, smaller even than some greens—he and Gabriel had already been sent out with a Wing to burn demons before they could destroy the Bakerhold crops. The Gate had opened so near Eden Weyr that Castiel had been able to see the scarlet split of it in the sky. It had been far away, so far it had looked just like a ribbon blowing away in the breeze, but… still too close.
that’s on them—and starts weaving his way through the corridors.
“Provided I manage to stay out of federal prison for sharing classified information with a person under investigation, ask me that again in three to five years,” Castiel answers, his voice tart right through the pulse of desire. “And we’ll see.”
he folds his clothes. “Dean, I got into a physical altercation with a member of the away team,” he says, still very calmly. “And I did it very obviously, in front of multiple witnesses. I didn’t even

knows Cas can’t stop smiling.
For the first time, the woman glanced at Dean, sitting beside the Magistrate’s desk on a hard chair. “Talk some sense into your friend, please,” she said. Dean didn’t mistake that for a request. There was nothing polite about it, even with the ‘please.’ She didn’t even bother to keep looking at him all the way through the sentence.

“Because I suspect you have answers,” he answered plainly. “The kind that people might not approve of.”
“Hey, now,” Jody objected, frowning. “Novak’s a good queen. Runs a tight bunch of hatchlings. Yeah, she does things her own way, but Mills hasn’t

He didn’t remember the little golden dragonet, smaller than Impala, all limbs and neck and long whipcord tail, shaking herself free and jumping on top of Ruby, snarling, her head dipping and dipping and dipping as she tore viciously at Ruby’s throat—one wing flapping for leverage, one held close to her back, hurt and crumpled.
“Is this because he’s sort of a guy?” Dean demands, finally, fed up with it.
“Why’s the door so big?” Garth asks. “Like… seems like you’d want something that could be slammed closed fast just in case something icky tried to come the other direction.”
Cas patted the back of Dean’s hand, then stood—pulling himself back to his feet and climbing out of the tub with that surprisingly grace he had sometimes, like even his human muscles knew he’d been something more for a while, screw the cat comparison anyway. His legs had little scatterings of dark hair on them, and he had bony, weird-looking knees.

Everyone who sees her thinks she’s Cas’s. She is, obviously, but damn, she really does look it.
Dean’s had a thing for blue eyes and dark hair for years. He knows exactly why, too.
“I’m not sure about Stephanie—they didn’t last long, I don’t think she and Treyvon were together anymore by the time we graduated, and she went to college out of state.

Castiel raised both his eyebrows at his best friend. If Impala hadn’t already realized that Fitzgerald was very literally ten times his size, there was no ‘complex’ that could possibly bother him.
Cas’s mental clock is still better than anyone’s. He knows just what time it is, no matter when or where they are. The little random leftover bits of angel are pretty weird.
“We’ll look for a clearing,” he says, shortly, before turning on a heel and marching back up to the front of the column.

But Dean was a realist. This shit happened.

This time, it’s not just a narrowing, it’s definitely a squint. “Threats were much more effective when you didn’t enjoy them,” Cas rumbles. That rasp of his is deeper than normal, darker. He’s probably
John crosses his arms. “Check in with Bobby,” he commands, sternly, like it’s a done deal. “There’s some bad shit in the forests up there, no telling what the angel dust’ll do to them. And if—”
Because unicorns were mythical? Hm. Castiel wasn’t entirely sure if he’d been insulted or not. “Thank you?” he said uncertainly.
The rest of the day is a dream, or maybe one of those nightmares where Dean keeps plowing through vampires, over and over. Their plan’s about as sound as hunter plans ever are—which means there’s about a fifty-fifty that they’re all going to end up dead anyhow, but fifty-fifty’s still better than zero. The Rift’s taller than a skyscraper now, stabbing the glittering needle of itself into the sky, and they’re close enough that even inching closer they have to stab a few dozen demons. There are even a few of the weird dumbbell-shaped ones that Benny’s taken to calling Leviathans.
Dean’s never really been good at that. But Cas meets his eyes for just a flicker. There’s a tiny little shake of his head.
Eileen’s struggling to get the words out by the end of the familiar incantation—pressing forward, doubled in, leaning in over the book she and Sam
Huh, it's possible to roll his eyes with them already closed. “Neither was I,” Dean grumbles, and buries his nose in Cas's hair. “Shut up, firefly, I'm sleeping.”
This chapter contains the scene that started this entire 'fic: Dean and Cas on the cliffside, watching fire lizards flying around, and Cas talking Dean into standing for one last Hatching rather than going to Bakerhold. It was supposed to be a one-shot. And here we are...
“I wish I’d gone with you,” Cas says softly, instead, and Dean’s gut twists. “Maybe… maybe there’s something—I could have done, maybe there’s a way—I wish… I wish I were there.”
That shuts Gordon up for a second. Dean sits up in his chair, frowning. What do physics have to do with anything?

It’s Jo who gets it. She gapes. “Wait, are you telling me…”

if they got touched by a storm-net that was live. Castiel had come in through theirs and touched it, just like Dean had, but Dean had taken it down to get it unstuck from the cave mouth, so it hadn’t been live then…
“I thought of that before I put it on your reader,” Cas agrees, solemnly. “But isn’t it beautiful? ‘
He has his mouth open—he doesn’t even know to say what—when John Winchester steps in and swats the zapper out of Dean’s hand.
“Never wanted to get out there?” Dean asks the back of Cas’s head. His hair’s all sweetly ruffled-up at the back, like he was scratching at it during his meeting. “Y’know, get around, see the world?”
She’s still beautiful. Still all dark hair and dark eyes, with that little sideways shot to her right hip that once upon a time, he couldn’t look away from.

They both got a laugh out of that.
but… nothing hurts. And it should, Dean’s not a goddamned teenager anymore. Adrenaline or not, he’s been hauling another man’s unconscious weight for what looks, from the snaking track of trodden-down and chopped-off plants that they left through Eden’s landscape, like miles.
Dean nods, smirking. “Yeah… turns out the reason he can’t do Quiz Bowl is ‘cause it doesn’t match up with his martial arts practices. He’s, like, a black belt in aikido? I guess?” Dean realizes that he doesn’t actually know what ‘second dan’ means, but what the hell, it’s gotta be something like that, right?
Honestly, Castiel
His stomach hits the floor.
Alright, Dean was right. The sleeveless, woven Candidate tunic that Castiel was wearing was so white that Castiel was afraid to touch anything, lest it get on his fingers and then on his tunic. He’d already had to scrub a little piece of yellow yolk out of the hem when Ellen had snuck both him and Dean a hardboiled chicken egg each, with a little sprinkle of salt.
“It occurred to me to say that,” Castiel admitted. “It

Castiel cocked his head, frowning. “I’m… exactly the same size as I was yesterday.”
Of all the things that Dean expected his dad to say, though, that wasn’t one of them.
” She smirked, and Castiel did bark out a real laugh at that. But when he finished, Meg was giving him one of those dark-eyed, knowing looks that made him want to squirm away. “You really think you’re never going to get to mess around with someone you’re really into, huh.”
Cas frowns and his head starts to lean to the side, but he lets that go. “All of that maintains mental homeostasis, and in Purgatory, that’s even more important than the condition of your bodies.” He pauses, and continues, matter-of-factly, “You won’t have to defecate or urinate, either, for what it’s worth.”
It was annoying. He’d been heartsick when she’d finally left Eden for a post at Purgatory Weyr, though being the leader of the messenger dragons there suited her impressively. But now, Castiel was remembering that it wasn’t always enjoyable being around someone who seemed to read him so
“Gordon fucking
(He’ll tolerate that because Grumpy Cat still lives by her bedside lamp.)
Castiel scowled up at him and noted, “’Virgin’ is an antiquated term, originating from when they believed that only those who could withstand dragonfever could ride dragons, and frankly, that’s absurd,” he pointed out. “Having been through it once, I can honestly say that self-control in that setting is not a virtue, it is
“I don’t think either of us knows enough about anyone’s biology to be able to make that kind of blanket statement, and alpha rut is not exactly something I’ve researched extensively.” Cas considered, his finger tapping lightly on Dean’s thigh. He yawned, mouth wide and eyes squinching shut, and curled up against Dean’s side, his knee hooking over Dean’s thighs. “Though there was that one very embarrassed young man who I had to direct to the reproductive biology section of the library, because he couldn’t find what he was looking in the gender studies section…”
Forty-eight months after Castiel sat shaking in Robert Singer’s office, Dean Winchester turns to face him again. He’s a little older, now—they both are—but Dean doesn’t have the tired, worn look around his mouth anymore, or the sharp bruised set to his back. He’s wearing a well-fitted suit with a flashy, emerald-green tie over a pair of intensely sensible shoes.
It doesn’t make it any easier.
“Lemme just tell Sam and get my equipment requisitioned from Bobby.” Dean scrubs his fingers through his hair with exasperation. He was looking forward to some downtime, but screw it. “Hell, maybe
“What?”
and let me finish,” Castiel snapped. If he didn’t get this out now, after so many years of holding it in, he didn’t know that he ever would.
Eileen sighs and shakes her head. “That’s… true,” she agrees reluctantly. “It’s why people still live in the Fading Lands even though we have worse weather than most of the rest of… everywhere, really.”
There aren’t any more hunters’ pyres. There can’t be. Too much of the country around them is burning already. But just this one time, they burn the whole house.
in it, long drapes of it falling over his back and arms and shoulders like curtains.
“I'm… well aware of what I am,” Castiel answered dryly. He frowned, and gestured very pointedly downwards. “But I do happen to be a queen rider who is in possession of a penis.”
“I don’t give a fuck about that,” Dean says. It’s a lie, and Dean knows it, but in a small way, right now, it’s true, too. “You sure you’re fine?”
Maybe he can find himself another honey to keep company and watch movies and fool around with for the little while that they’re here. Simple pleasures, and then they’re gone.
They unload their packs, pulling out their supplies—chalk, salt; pen and ink. Sam’s journeyman book and Eileen’s book of Sentinel incantations; Dean doesn’t carry one with him anymore, and hasn’t in years, but all things considered he’d glad for the fact that she’s a traditionalist now.
Castiel arcs an eyebrow at him and pushes the notebook he was using to desultorily sketch out some lines of dialogue in to the side. He settles his elbow on the table and rests his chin in his palm, studying the fireman from two houses down who came over to ask for cumin and, who, Castiel thinks, has become his best friend.
Too lovely; with that kind of beauty came temper and caprice.
Cas blinked at him. His warm rosy mouth fluttered open and shut. “I… what?” he asked blankly.
—and that,
“I’m a Bible-believing Christian. That’s why my conscience prohibits me from doing same-sex weddings,” the lady with the white smile and the red lips says, sure of herself, her chin up. “I’m entitled to a religious exemption. This entire matter disrespects me as a God-fearing woman.”
Even though Cas was—at least theoretically; Dean had his own thoughts about it—an omega with a quiet, neutral scent, he was also tall and broad-shouldered and strong as hell, and he didn’t take Dean’s bullshit. (He didn’t take anyone’s bullshit, really.) Most of the time, Dean’s alpha just wanted to snuggle right up to him and purr and sniff against his neck rather than alpha voice him down to his knees, but… not always.

Michael blinked at her. “Why are you here?” he asked. “Aren’t you just the Weyr seneschal? This has nothing to do with the household. This is rider business.”
“Will you ever put it back?” Dean whispers when they break apart. Cas’ face is a wonder in the dark, blue reflections of his grace across his eyes bringing back a ghost of the warrior for god that led armies, fought the devil, pulled Dean out of hell. “Be an angel again?”
The group of them quickly fall into a routine. Study sessions in the library, game sessions in their halls, late night diner trips and movie nights. Though Meg and Benny are around a lot, Cas and Dean seem to be welded at the hip. They study different subjects – Dean wants to major in engineering and Cas is heading for med school and a career in surgery – but outside of the lectures they don’t share, Meg rarely sees them apart. It’s so unusual it throws her off every time. Seeing one without the other feels like seeing them without a head.
It’s not always the same. The dominant emotion slips from anger to fear, back again. Sometimes there’s pain, sometimes not. The one constant is a foundation of gnawing worry that rises and falls in intensity but never fades away.
“Naomi is…” he pauses, considers how best to phrase it. “Somewhat unbending when it comes to my choice of activities,” he finally says diplomatically. “It’s best she remains in the dark about this.”
Cas lets go of Dean’s jacket and he takes Dean’s hand instead. Both the boys look down at the movement in unison.
“Okay. Okay.” Sam soothes. “I just mean why did you decide to… let that part of yourself out again, after such a long time?”
“Did you have a good day Dean?”
Meg chews her lip at that. Cas

Dean unpicks the double knots as quickly as he’s able, but with Cas rucking Dean’s sleeve up to kiss the handprint scar and trailing fire over Dean’s back wherever his touch falls, Dean’s fingers fumble frustratingly and his mind keeps wandering off task.
“You can’t say my name like that.” He pushes the words out past the solid lump of
Cas glances down at the blanket burrito Dean has made of himself. All that’s visible are a couple of tips of his hair and the hand that’s got a death grip on Cas’ shirt.
Castiel wakes one freezing February morning to thick fog pressing against his window, squalls of fresh snow gusting across the already thickly white garden, and the strongest tug on his heart that he’s ever felt.
And alongside that there’s green. There’s always green.
“Here,” Cas says, grabbing his angel blade off the bed beside him and proffering it. “Take this with you.”
still can’t believe you literally caught us in bed together and you still didn’t catch on.” He wipes his eyes. “Second bedroom’s Sammy’s. Got sick of him whinin’ ‘bout sharing a room with us last year.”
Except it is. He can’t deny that. Because this time they’re inside, alone, and this time he’ll get to touch Dean’s mark. That’s always the final step; touch each other’s marks and bonded marks will glow. If he were any kind of logical it would be that making him anxious, the final hurdle to knowing that they’re meant for each other, but in all honesty it’s really not. Cas doesn’t need to see that glow under his skin to know. But the thought of getting to touch Dean’s skin at all, just touching
For a moment, Meg just watches Dean and Cas. Meg has always teased at least partly because she genuinely thinks they’d be sweet together, that they’d make each other happy. And the way they’re pressed close on their side of the diner booth, even while they’re eating unwilling to slide apart, eyes turning starry whenever they catch each other’s gaze, startled and delighted by each other’s affection still after apparently two whole years of marriage, all that lets her know she’d been entirely right.
He can’t mind that. Not when they’re this vividly happy.
He’s filling the glass at the sink when the back of his neck prickles. He squeezes his eyes shut for a brief second, clenches his hand around the glass to repress the tremors threatening to shudder across the surface of the water.
“Yeah, I know.” Dean leans down to kiss the top of Cas’ head. “You stay here. I’ll just drive by, make sure we got all the ghosts and come straight back. No solo hunting, scout’s honour.”
that means Cas was married the first time she met him, seriously,
“And then you just- fuck, you just did what? Put it all in a box and let it fester in the back of your mind screwing you up for a couple of decades?”

Dean pushes himself up, fumbles down between them to take Cas in hand, strokes once, twice. Cas’ gasps out a soft
They’ll be looking for Castiel.
Cas bundles him into the back seat, cranks the heat to max. He swathes them in blankets, pulls their clothes off, wraps the whole of himself around Dean. His body heat is a furnace and Dean clings onto him in desperation, pushing his face into Cas’ neck and shivering helplessly.
Cas pushes himself up so he’s kneeling on the mattress next to Dean. He leans forward, takes Dean’s face in his hands and pulls Dean inexorably round to look him in the eye.
doesn’t cover it, Castiel thinks with a wry smile, but he keeps the thought to himself. Instead, he runs his fingers back over the curve of Dean’s shoulder blade, revelling in the feel of Dean’s skin against his own, noticing for the first time how Dean’s freckles dust his shoulders too. Dean seems to melt into the contact, leaning back into Cas’ touch with a soft sigh, so Cas carries on, following the shape of each feather and marvelling at how the colours light up in welcome. Neither of them speaks, but all the awkwardness of earlier is washed away, leaving only a comfortable quiet.
Cas talks, pointing out the ones he’s visited, his favourite constellations, watches Dean out of the side of his eye. Dean isn’t really looking where he’s pointing. He looks up when Cas talks about something specific, but mostly he’s just watching Cas with this soft expression, like he couldn’t imagine looking at anything more beautiful.
John hadn’t asked what was wrong.
He’s sliding deeper into Cas’ lap before he knows what he’s doing. He pushes down against Cas, curls his fingers into Cas’ hair, groans in the back of his throat.
Cas isn’t used to Dean being so openly physically affectionate in public. He’s never distant, but he’s never been hugely comfortable with putting them on display either. Generally Cas doesn’t mind, but he would like to be able to hold Dean’s hand whenever he wants without considering who might be looking, so this makes his heart beat hard and happy in his chest. He’s particularly pleased when the barista calls them cute together and Dean blushes a bit, grinning down at his feet.
“Make ‘em go away Cas,” Dean mumbles, mostly muffled by duvet and the curve of Cas’ hip.
“I know.” Dean repeats. Tightens his grip on the concrete edge.
“You told me a guy tried to mug you.”
Dean has wanted Cas for longer than he can really remember any more. Years. But that doesn’t mean falling into bed with him is easy from the first try.
“Okay.”
He's in the tub in the bunker bathroom. Covered in freezing water that sinks pinpricks of needling cold into his skin where the floating ice shards brush against him.
Or more accurately, Castiel is the mirror and this is the original.
“Did good,” he mumbles.
Dean pulls a leather cord out from under his layers, tugs it over his head, holds the pendant out on the flat of his hand. Castiel looks down and there it is. There’s his mark made real. The amulet with its curving horns, the fine lines of the tiny face, the coils of the cord laid over Dean’s skin in a mirror of the lines on Castiel’s.
He doesn’t stop thinking about it, though.
“Dean?” Cas asks, curious. Dean’s emotions are still muffled and his short minutes of experience reading Dean’s feelings off his expressions aren’t enough for him to be able to parse this particular turn of face.
“Hey!” Dean yells.
He jerks up onto his elbows, breathing hard. He doesn’t remember having a nightmare. His bed’s not tumbled, even the book he’d been reading last night is still safely on top of the duvet. But his heart’s racing and his skin’s damp with cold sweat and a sick clash of fear and anger is warring under his ribs.
One of the kids mutters. Dean hears Cas say something in response, but the guy’s already scrambling to his feet and Dean doesn’t catch it.
It’s the most beautiful thing Castiel has ever seen.
Cas hesitates doing up his buttons, watches Dean bend down to tie his boots. Dean hates shopping for gardening things. Usually it takes Cas at least a week of pestering until he’ll grudgingly drive him somewhere for seeds and topsoil.
“Dinner?” Dean interrupts his train of thought. “We should get something nicer than fast food for a change, go to a proper restaurant.”
The softness of Cas’ smile cracks Dean’s heart with a love so fierce it’s pain. He slumps forward, hands clenching in Cas’ t-shirt. Cas catches him, cradles the back of Dean’s head with one hand, and Dean exhales long and shaky. For a long moment Dean just feels Cas’ heart beating against his ear, breathes out the fumes of poisonous memory, breathes Cas back in.
He doesn’t even know their name, but the soft whisper of their soul against his feels like something he’s known since before he was born.
He goes to push up, spring to his feet, dive back into the fight, but-
Hurriedly he bundles his school things into his satchel, tossing in a couple of books to give credence to his story. He’s downstairs again in less than five minutes, lacing his shoes in the hallway and watching Naomi out of the corner of his eye. She doesn’t look up, focused in on the financial pages of the paper, but there’s a harsh set to her mouth that he doesn’t like, so he slips out as swiftly and silently as he can manage.
No, it’s the pervasive rumour that true romantic soulmates can feel each other’s emotions, their soulmarks linking them so deeply they can sense each other from opposite sides of the world. It’s a standard trope in every B grade romcom ever made. No one’s ever actually met anyone it’s happened to. It’s all
Cas gives him a classic
Dean has enough of his own nightmares to feel a mirror of the absolute, devastating weight that Cas carries inside. He dreams of the dead weight of Cas’ head in his hands before Ezekiel - Gadreel – resurrected him. The fire burning Cas’ body to ash after Lucifer killed him. The empty enveloping Cas before Dean can find the words to reply to an
“I’m not gonna let ‘em walk around like that, stickin’ how sick they are in other people’s faces, disgusting fucks-“
But Dean just shakes his head quickly, eyes widening in something like horror. “
He doesn’t quite know where this nerve has come from, to skate so close to interrupting her. It’s a heady rush that he quickly clamps down on. He lifts his eyes and meets Naomi’s gaze, schooling his face to a careful transparency that shows nothing but blankness underneath.
His first instinct is to flatly disbelieve it, but Dean’s looking at him with something close to awe in his eyes, and Castiel feels the truth of it echoing through their bond to snuff out his doubt, set something new and shy fluttering in his ribs.
“I never let myself imagine back then. I thought you didn’t… I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable. So I wouldn’t let myself imagine. But now I…” Cas drops his head to the dashboard, wraps his arms around himself. “Now I’m
When Dean comes back to himself, he’s slumped bonelessly over Cas like a human blanket. If it were anyone else Dean would worry about crushing them, but Cas just blinks slowly, eyes hooded and dark and blissed out, and wraps all his limbs around Dean in a whole-body hug. The heat inside Dean settles now, turning sweet and hazy, blending with the warmth of Cas’ body against his own. Dean snuffles contentedly and slides his hands under Cas’ back to pull them even closer together.
Despite Cas’ contentment, Dean can’t shake the feeling he hasn’t said the right thing. He chews his lip, fingers tapping against the mattress, twitchy with nervous energy. Cas just watches him, face soft and open and undemanding. There’s no expectation there, but it’s that gentle serenity that finally pulls an explanation from where it was trying to hide itself behind Dean’s infinite capacity for denial.
So he keeps to the tall rows of shelves, flitting from row to row, floor to floor, scanning the faces of the browsing patrons with increasing confusion. People are searching the collection, bending over books on the tables, reading curled up in the comfortable chairs. None of them pays him any mind. Not one of them so much as glances up at him as he passes.
“I would call Bobby your dad,” Cas says, contemplative even as his eyes are fixated on his textbook. “He actually cares for you. Your
Glancing one more time around the silent array of desks, Castiel slips his hand into his pocket and runs his thumb up the side of his phone. A couple of quick taps and he’ll have any knowledge he wants in his hands. But even as his thumb skates over the power button, Naomi’s disapproving face looms out of his subconscious.
Dean nods thoughtfully. “She sounds like a real peach.”
He pries his eyes open. For a second the light spears into his head and he flinches, whines against the flare of pain across his forehead. Then it dims to a bearable throb and he blinks, the world wavering into focus.
Dean watches him for a minute and feels the irritation drain out through the soles of his feet.
They leave the shop quickly, Dean literally having to lead Cas along by the hand to get him to walk. When they reach the car, Dean glances over at Cas, who promptly turns to stare pointedly off into the distance. His fingers fidget at the edge of his jacket. Dean’s smile widens as he unlocks baby’s doors.
Sam’s face is so earnest, sincere in that wet-eyed, set jaw way he’s had since he was a kid. Dean knows he means what he says, knows he should nod and accept it. But how is he supposed to take that offer when it took him eleven years to open his heart even to let love out? It’s not like he can just sit down in the library with Sam and pour out his pain and grief, all his fear and anger and regret out onto the floor like so much spilled whiskey for Sam to mop up with an understanding smile.
The suspect invites them in, asks them to sit down at the dining table while he fetches coffee. They settle themselves in, deliberately clustering themselves at one of the table so the suspect will have to face the united front of the three of them at once.
how did you so many times- I- fuck, Dean, I don’t…”
Cas pulls the thread tight, ties it off neatly. Dean’s hand clenches on Cas’ shirt, then Cas is snipping the thread and sitting up. Dean relaxes marginally. He looks down at his side.
Cas can feel it. Dean’s chest rising and falling. The beat of his heart, fast and frightened against Cas’ ear.
“Can I touch it?” It’s the only thing he can think to say. The only thing he can think at all.
Cas snaps, incredulous. “And… is that Balthazar? What… why are you…” He gapes for a second, blinking against the light. “Meg, it’s three in the goddamn morning.”
Towards the end of the row, Cas catches a whiff of something frying and his stomach grumbles. It’s been a long time since breakfast, and even that was grabbed hurriedly in the impala while Dean was driving. Maybe he can pick them something up for lunch. Whatever’s cooking smells like it should be greasy and unhealthy enough to keep Dean cheerful. He pictures Dean’s smile of thanks, the way his eyes will crinkle at the edges, and his feet are turning towards the food stands before he’s even finished making up his mind.
Castiel would almost believe that the pain of last night is gone and forgotten, that everything’s fine again.
, he thinks to the world at large,
Dean wakes Cas up with breakfast in bed, later than he normally lets Cas sleep. Coffee, homemade waffles with maple syrup. Dean puts a record on, lies on the bed with his head on Cas’ thighs and talks about nothing while Cas eats. He’s not wearing a shirt, and the rise of his breath in his ribs catches Cas’ gaze and won’t let him look away. Cas only makes it through half his food before he has to put it aside, grab hold of Dean and yank him up to kiss his stupid, beautiful, distracting face.
“Dean, I-
He still looks at Dean like he’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
His turn of phrase shocks a snort from Castiel and Dean grins again, a glimmer of satisfaction at making Castiel laugh sparkling between them.
“No you’re not.” Cas rips open a bandage, smooths it down over Dean’s ribs.
“She’s not
Castiel swallows convulsively.
They’ve passed half a dozen motels since he started driving. They could have stopped at any of them.
“What if it’s
Dean chokes a little on his beer, swipes his hand over his mouth.
Dean quickly loses himself to the slide of their bodies together, the way Cas moves underneath him, the breathless words Cas whispers into the hollow of Dean’s neck. The sounds are a soft tumble, barely audible, but Dean catches a needy sigh of
They’ll have felt the awakening too. They’ll know.
Then there’s the end of year dance.
Dean slips his hands under Cas’ t-shirt, up his back to press his palms onto Cas’ shoulder blades. Cas snuffles a contented noise into Dean’s ear that drops a pearl of hazy warmth straight into the centre of Dean’s chest. It glows there, slowly thawing the icy tremor from his bones with every easy rise and fall of Cas’ ribs against his own.
The two kids are huddled together against the wall now, hands clutched between them. They can’t be more than seventeen. One of them has a bi flag pin on his lapel and something in Dean’s heart twists.
Cas leans on him for a while, feeling the rhythm of Dean’s breath, the warmth of him through their clothes. Dean watches the sky, hums a little under his breath.
“And I fucking
With a monumental effort he rolls over and latches his hand onto Dean’s elbow. He’s so exhausted Dean could break out of his grip with no effort, but he doesn’t. He sits down on the edge of the bed again and leans in instead. “What’s up Cas?”
They choose some shirts and jeans for Cas, a couple of plain white shirts for Sam. Size: moose. Cas pulls them into a sports store to get some new sweatpants, then while they’re there Dean puts some more hiking socks for those long hunting expeditions in their basket and, thinking of Cas’ propensity for shuffling around the bunker wrapped in multiple blankets, a couple of soft, fleece lined hoodies. Cas only likes wearing hoodies if Dean’s worn them before him – something about
“Yeah.” One of them says weakly. “Thank you – both of you.”
Cas sighs again, leans back. Dean’s hand slips from his face, but Cas catches it and holds it in his lap while he shoves the first aid supplies back in the bag one-handed.
be. When he’s young his daydreams are mostly softness, warmth. An idea of a smile and a hand holding his tight. As he ages images, sensations, define themselves more clearly. He thinks of strong hands, a deep voice whispering devotion in his ear, stubble under his fingertips, against his cheek. Desires that thrum anxiously through his nerves when he wonders what Naomi would say if she knew.
Dean blinks. What’s different? What kind of dumb fuck question is
Castiel can feel Dean’s nervousness masked under the confident sweep of his movement, so he swallows his sudden shock and smiles as honestly as he can.
Sam doesn’t respond for a second. Then his brow creases in his own frown as he blinks at the ceiling.
TW: this chapter contains brief mentions of child abuse.
When they’d finally stumbled into the kitchen a couple of hours later, Dean’s pupils still a little blown and Cas still mostly holding onto to Dean to stay upright, Sam had just rolled his eyes and passed Dean a plate of apple pie without making any kind of crass comment.
sounds from Dean, so much softer and more familiar than
It’s a long time before Dean warms up, but it’s about when the vicious pins and needles subside and he starts being able to feel his fingers again that he also realises that Cas is mostly naked and
Cas can see Dean smiling from the corner of his eye, so he doesn’t rise to the barb.
Then there’s the barest shiver at the base of his spine as the bond cracks back open. The faintest hesitant touch brushes through him, and Castiel could choke on the relief of it.
, but then Cas will get his hands under Dean’s shirt, down Dean’s jeans, and the bit of Dean’s brain that spent ten years shoving this want into a box on a shelf in the back of his mind wakes up and screams bloody murder.
“Dean?”
want pie Dean.” He straightens, turns to pick up the potatoes.
Cas puts all the warning he can into the syllable. Musters all the strength he can find and pushes it into one clear, dangerous sentence. “Get in here and sleep right now or I swear I will smite you.”
He smiles, the barest lift of the corner of his mouth, and something warm and interested stirs in Meg’s stomach.
, his traitorous brain never fails to append, and his heart throbs with the despairing want of it.
“I had to cool you down Cas, you were a furnace.” Dean rubs comforting circles on the inside of Cas’ wrist. “I know it’s uncomfortable, I’m sorry. I was starting to think the fever was going to give you brain damage.”
Castiel spares one quick flick of his eyes around the congregation. He knows with absolute certainty that none of the people he’s shared this church with for years can possibly be the person he feels against his soul – he’s known them all too long and too well to have any illusions about that – but perhaps there’s someone new. Someone he hadn’t noticed before.
that he’d always longed for and could barely believe. He dreams of the mark ruling him so completely he doesn’t hold back, sees himself plunge the angel blade into Cas’ eye from inside his own body, powerless to stop it.
“Emotional confluence,” Cas mutters, glancing down at his covered wrist again. What was it he’d felt, in that sudden, overwhelming moment? He can’t really remember what
Cas flushes but his jaw sets, defiant. “Judging by what everyone else was doing last night, that’s perfectly normal behaviour for married couples.”
“Dean.” Sam says slowly. “What else are you not telling me?”

“Lngkh.” He makes a small noise in the back of his throat, tips his head back to rest on the tiles and stares up at the ceiling.
Some mornings aren’t so bad.
, is enough to make him shiver.
Cas doesn’t respond. His breathing stays steady, ghosting over Dean’s face in unbroken rhythm. Dean slides his hand up to brush his fingers along Cas’ jaw.
To Castiel’s own surprise, Dean hugs himself, shoulders hunching in. A flutter of Dean’s embarrassment flickers in Castiel’s stomach.
“Sam and Eileen are ten miles down the road, I’d call them.” Dean drops to crouch by the bed. “Do you not want me to?”
“Come on.” Cas shoves the first aid kit to the side and clambers to his feet. He hauls Dean up with him, lifting him carefully by the elbows, but Dean still hisses and closes his eyes as the movement stretches the stitches.
“You bought me pie.”
“Meg, this way.” Cas turns to the waving guy, glancing over his shoulder and gesturing her to follow. So she does, eyebrow quirking up in startled surprise.
in a way that Dean could never have given justice to in all his years of longing imagination.

“Go stand over there, Dean.”
Before he can really process Naomi is back, leather laptop bag in hand and heels clacking on the kitchen tile. She lays the bag on the counter and slips a bundle of documents into the side pocket. She doesn’t spare Castiel a glance.
The wendigo catches Cas right in the centre of his chest.
Dean looks down at Cas leaning against him, the tangles of his hair tickling his cheek. He breathes in again and this time all he gets is shampoo, fabric conditioner, a whisper of the whiskey from dinner.
Castiel slumps over to rest on the bookshelves. He feels lightheaded, numb. His rainbow soulmark swims before his blurring vision, as removed from him as if his hand belongs another person.
And Castiel will start guiltily and jerk his sleeve back over his hand, mutter a
Dean evades Cas’ questioning gaze by fetching some more meds and dosing him up. The drugs hit quickly and he’s sinking into sedated clouds before he can really process what’s going on. He drifts for a soft moment, carried on waves of relief as the headache recedes and his aching joints quiet. Then Dean gets up to move to the chair by the bed and Cas jolts back to a semblance of wakefulness.
that.”
Fuck, it’s not fair how they look together. They could be straight out of a goddamn Hollywood movie.
Cas’ frown softens. He slides a hand up Dean’s back under his t-shirt, runs his fingers through the fine hair at Dean’s temple. “Dean,” he says insistently. “It’s always perfect if it’s with you.”
“It’s September eighteenth.”
A hand appears, snags the lettuce and whips it away. Leaves Dean’s burger unsullied, as it should be. A second later the hand is back sliding a rejected pickle onto the edge of the plate.
“That’s all right,” he says, hating the triteness of the words on his tongue even as he speaks them. “I understand that. I understand not… not always being able to talk about things like these with everyone.”
Touching his fingertips to his lips and blinking back tears, he looks up into the firelit sky and smiles.
“There you are,” she snaps. “I told you to hurry up.”
And Dean is
, Cas trailing behind him wearing the fondly exasperated expression he so often does around Dean. Bal leans away, face morphing from excitement to ease as he reaches for the food. Meg follows suit, filing the new information into her internal evidence folder on Dean and Cas’ baffling relationship, but as she snags the cheesiest pizza slice she can reach, she catches Balthazar’s eye over the plate and understanding flashes between them.
Castiel flushes, startled but pleased despite himself. He’s fairly – no, entirely - sure Dean’s compliments are slipping over into deliberate flirting now, and nothing good has ever come of anyone paying him any kind of flirtatious attention. It’s never been real before, has always come from the crueller of his school peers, has always been calculated to mock and hurt him. From Dean, though, Cas can feel the half-shy honesty of Dean’s words on his own tongue, can see the genuine amazement in Dean’s eyes when they look at each other. He could so easily get used to all of it.
so they’d ended up sleeping tangled together in Dean’s bed every night anyway. But they’re still dancing around each other like blushing virgins. Which is ridiculous, Dean hasn’t been wrong-footed by sex in his entire life.
He’d talked about god like that back at the beginning. Daddy’s faithful little soldier, he’s talked of his father in that tone that rang with faith as unshakable as the mountains. Dean hasn’t heard anything like that utter devotion from Cas’ mouth in years, not since he rebelled, since he
“Cas, stop, you gotta stop.”
Dean shrugs one shoulder, fastens an extra coat button to hold the scarf in. His fingers linger for a beat longer than he needs, then his hands drop to pick up the gun and he starts walking again.
Castiel feels winded. Dean’s words might as well have been an iron bar to the ribs. He’d known, he couldn’t avoid guessing, not with the undercurrent of quiet suffering he’s felt from Dean over the past months, he’d known something had to be wrong in his life. But hearing it out loud is another beast entirely.
He wakes early the next morning to the sound of Naomi rapping on his door and calling him to get up. He showers quickly, runs through his morning routine on automatic. His eyes keep straying to his wrist as he brushes his teeth and pulls out one of his smart Sunday shirts. The greens are a little muted this morning, which makes the gold stand out bolder. It shimmers under the bathroom lights, arresting Castiel’s gaze and derailing his train of thought every time he catches sight of it.
When Castiel gets home that evening he hovers outside the front door, turning his keys in fingers that twitch and thrum with an anxiety he can’t contain. What if Naomi sees? What if Naomi
Cas sags into Deans side as they stagger along. Trembling reverberates through his chest and for a long, groggy moment he thinks it’s him, until he blinks his eyes back open and sees the hand Dean has pressed into his ribs is shaking.
He doesn’t lower his voice, and it catches Dean’s attention even on the other side of the store.
“It’s never been like this with anyone before,” he grumbles, half complaining and half confessing. “Having sex with you is like you’re pulling my heart out of me and putting it back different.”
“Cold?” He asks without lifting his head from where it’s leant onto the sofa back.
Heart in his throat, Castiel reaches out and brushes a trembling fingertip over the amulet’s smooth surface. It’s warm from Dean’s hand, from being tucked against his chest. Still, Castiel can’t quite make himself believe it’s here, solid under his touch.
“Nothing to hide,” Dean mumbles. “Not like I’ve been sneaking around dating men behind your back.”
“Nothing.” Dean just steps forward, falling back into step alongside Castiel as they turn and head down the main road, but out of the corner of his eye Castiel can see the corner of Dean’s mouth pull up in a proper smile. Cas doesn’t know what it is he’s doing to keep making Dean smile and laugh, but whatever blessing it is, he fervently hopes it never leaves him.
and a tiny cartoon bee on the pocket from a little independent store, just for the beaming smile Cas gives him when he sees it.
Cas can only watch him for a long, hanging moment, throat tight and heart beating hard against his ribs.
“Cas,” he mumbles into Cas’ jaw. Fumbles at Cas’ chest, mouths sloppily at his neck. “Cas, I want-“
for Cas to strip him even further, pull his soul out while he takes off Dean’s clothes and bare every last millimetre of him to the scorching heat of that love.
“What’s different now?” Sam asks eventually. “With Cas?”
There’s a man – a boy - standing not two metres away. He’s tall, tumbling brown hair, light skin, muscled but still skinny in the teenage way Castiel himself is. He’s dressed in jeans, boots, a leather jacket that can’t be warm enough in this cold. He’s got a scattering of freckles over his nose and cheekbones that’s visible even from this distance.
Sam snorts and pulls a face. “Oh yeah,” he nods with a vaguely disgusted expression that’s every inch his fourteen years. “They’ve been this gross since, like, forever.”
It’s only later, when Dean’s in the car, that he really looks at the blade. Dean’s wielded a lot of angel blades in the past, but this one belongs to Cas. It’s the one he carried into hell to save him. It’s the one he’s been defending Dean with for over a decade. It doesn’t look much different to the other blades at first glance, but when Dean looks closer there’s something about the way the car lights on the metal play bluer than they should that makes Dean think of Cas’ grace. When he holds the hilt it’s already warm against his palm, and it feels familiar, as if he’s holding Cas’ hand. He tries a few moves and the blade flows with him easily, like it’s a part of his body.
Dean turns his head. Notes that Cas’ arm is close enough to brush his own. Carefully shifts his chair away to a professional distance.
slightly off-angled, like Cas propped his phone on a rock.
Then Cas looks up at Dean, eyes scrunched up in annoyance. “Dean,” he says in his most deadpan voice. “Your laces are problematic.”
But he does anyway.
The sight of that makes Dean smile even through the twist of nausea starting in his gut. Fuck, it’s a lot. That’s a

“So someone like you, huh!” Garth says, sympathetically. “That’s tough!”
“You should be,” Meg told him cheerfully. “Anyway, Masters likes you. So you must be
“Yes,” Castiel agreed shakily, nodding. He pulled off his shirt and tossed it away, because that seemed to be the right thing to do. “Yes, yes. So very much.”
And that’s that.
“You sure as hell better, Sammy,” he answers, “’Cause I’m nothing but trouble, and all I’m ever gonna do is drag you down.”
But when Dean rinses out his coffee cup the next morning and goes to scoop up his bookbag, their dad looks up from the table, frowning. “Where’re you going?”
The next time Dean swipes, blindly, his blade meets absolutely no resistance, to the point where Dean finds himself spinning around with his own momentum and almost ending up on his knees. He clambers himself up, panting—
“Don’t.” It’s
. But right now? Cas—yep,
What would it sound like if he said “I love you,” aloud, again? The Empty cannot have him twice. The only one who can be hurt by it is Castiel himself, and he has already said it before.
“You said that,” Sam pointed out, the sassy little nine-year-old that he was. “Dean, you can’t go out in the storm again—you remember what happened last time!”
And it’s not like they’re gonna be around to make friends for real: they’re outta here soon. So all Dean’s got to do is make sure none of his teachers get a grudge, and no one hates him enough to try to take him out back. It’s not that Dean doesn’t think he’d win that fight, but assholes like that come with friends.
“Here, see? You gotta put your thumb on the outside, like this. Or else you’ll break it.” Dean wrapped his fingers around Castiel’s and poked his thumb until it was curled down and under rather than poking up over the rest of his fingers, because Castiel had long thumbs. “There you go. That’s how you make a fist.”
It’s selfish. Dean knows it the moment it’s out.
Yeah, that doesn’t even hurt. Dean being in love with his freakin’ best friend has got absolutely diddly squat to do with how good Dean is at being a Sentinel—and he’s very
. “You’ve got a nice one.”
“Yeah,” Dean muses, chewing loudly. He can hear Cas frowning on the other side. “I know, I know, man. We can re-cross the terminals once we get out of here, don’t want to burn the battery out too early or something from overcharging. Maybe leave the other one without the mod, though, just in case someone forgets to switch it back. Or we get attacked by demons and have to haul ass. You never know.”

It's like an assurance of the fact that yeah—they’re meant to be here. It’s like fate. Or some shit like that.
A broad stripe and a deep, relentless little
The tremor of Dean laughing with his lips pressed, parted, against the placket of Castiel’s underwear was almost as glorious as Dean peeling the plain white briefs down his thighs with just his teeth. “Oh,” Castiel heard himself gasp as Dean nosed into the dark nest of his pubic hair. He shifted, the cloth catching at his thighs.
wanted to be a dragonrider!”
“I told myself I would allow myself that when Heaven ended,” he said, softly, as if to himself. Dean’s heart kicked so hard against the inside of his ribs that he thought something hard and cold might have broken.
He doesn’t fight it: it’s not his first rodeo, Dean knows how strong these sons of bitches are, and there’s no arm-wrestling competition that he’s gonna win with something that’s made mostly of muscle, rage and magic. He

. But it felt good to breathe in and put his arms out and stretch, wide.
“Nah, uh… nah,” Dean answered, shaking his head like he was shaking sand out of his ears. He shifted back and forth on his feet, then straightened, hands scraping noisily at the sides of his pants—still that denim that only he wore, now that Sam was in dragonrider leathers. “Nah, lookin’ good, buddy.” He thumped Castiel on the shoulder and back—maybe a little too hard; Castiel rocked forward on his toes. “You do this, Garth? Huh.”
It does. Sammy’s not wrong about that, not at all.

He didn’t need to ask, not really. Dean hated Weyr bureaucracy and politics just as much as Castiel had always thought he would. Castiel, fortunately, didn’t: he’d taken over a portion of the Weyrwoman paperwork this year, since there had been no new hatchlings for him to wrangle.
” Dean groaned, bending back forward into a sprawl, the weight of his torso on one bent forearm. He pushed his other back underneath him.
And the darkness shifts around him, behind him—
And Dean didn’t flinch—not at all—as the head of Castiel’s cock finally breached him open. After
Dean kisses him once, shaky small brushes back and forth, their lips catching and scraping because Castiel forgot, once again, about lip balm, and he has a small coarse patch under his bottom lip where he never gets his shave quite right. Twice, teasing, a small dancing peck at the very corner of Castiel’s mouth that Castiel has to chase after with a discontented grunt, Dean’s lips curving as he teases.
It's kind of adorable, actually.
Cas smells like peppermints, like the color yellow, soft and musky and sleepy. He smells like perseverance, like courage.
Garth shrugs. “I dunno, thought it would be a nice souvenir.”
“Dean, brother,” Benny’s still kneeling by him, a hand on Dean’s shoulder and a shaky grin on his face. Garth is standing over his shoulder, and there’s nothing shaky about his smile. It’s a little scary. Dean sees the flash of fangs and slit eyes, then Garth is just Garth again. “Shoulda known. Shoulda known.” He shakes his head, slowly. “Damn.”
Hell, if he were one of them, he wouldn’t have liked him, either. It’s not like any of ‘em know that Dean’s got things to do outside of school, and that there’s a whole fucked-up underworld of monsters out there that he’s gonna handle as soon as he’s out of here. Sometimes he sort of pities them.
For a moment, he thinks Sam’s gonna argue with him, since it’s technically his night on the lights today—Sam turns towards him, his eyebrows coming together furrowed. But in the end, Sam nods, too. But Dean also doesn’t argue when Sam helps him with setting up the warding lamps. The broken one—the one that got Jo killed—got tossed in with all the rest when they hauled ass into the darkness. Dean pulls back and chucks the dark lantern out into the landscape as far as it’ll go.
enjoy reading—the acquisition of knowledge is pleasurable of itself. He once spends three days reading greedily across an entire reference shelf in the library. He reads the volumes from right to left, Kevin from left to right. Sam grins at them both. Dean mutters something about nerd multiplication and continues to play something on his phone. But he’s also the one who leaves cups of coffee at their elbows.
Then he stops. And stares, mouth hanging open. Then pulls the shower door the rest of the way open because, wait. There’s a shadow in there of… what in the…
Kevin makes a small chuffing noise like angels have disappointed him once again. Well, Castiel’s rather used to being that kind of a disappointment.

He knows what that means. “Rafael was a Special Forces medic. He was deployed to help out in Texas, after the Astrodome. He was one of those who was struck by the Rapture, and he died ten days later—but not before he turned upon his own squadmates,” Castiel tells him, his voice low and dark and so steady that it’s as vicious as the edge of a knife. “He killed four of them before they finally shot him.”
Cas studies him. “Well. You’re still an asshole, I see,” he observes. But one corner of his mouth turns up, like a tiny, shaky kiss. Jesus Christ, look at that. Turns out, he’s still got that soft little smile that still does that
Sometimes, when Castiel turned to look at Angel, he still expected to see a newly hatched dragonet. She had always sounded the same inside his head, from the day of her hatching, but the rest of her had certainly changed since then.

dragon was waiting for him in their shell, just ready to come into the light and stumble towards Castiel on the warm sands.
And it did hurt.
“Oh, I’d… I think I’d like that,” Castiel breathed, and patted the sofa beside him in invitation. What an enticing thought. Maybe he understood a little better how Dean had felt when Castiel had told him that getting through his list of fantasies would take a while. “Can we start here?”
It's anyone’s guess whether it’s because he thinks there’s the chance of a blow or a blade coming in the middle of the night, and he doesn’t want his family caught up in it if it happens.

Cas did, looking down at the piece of string moving all on its own around his arm with calm curiosity. “I don’t think Sam would have been happy as a storm-mage.”
Then he pauses, his tongue stuttering halfway through where he was planning to tell Cas to not let the cold air draft in and to douse the candle when he comes to bed. ‘Cause with where they are—well outside the confines of the Magisterium—he’s pretty sure he knows where Cas

For a moment, he thought that his best friend wasn’t going to answer. Dean was staring straight ahead at the little rough oval of eggs, each in their carefully-dug little bowl of sand so that none of them tipped over—Novak’s clutch mixed comfortably together with Barnes’s so that they could enjoy each other’s warmth before they started to pip. The only one that was off by itself was the gold egg, and she was cradled carefully between Novak’s paws at the edge of the sands.
Sighing, he shoulders his bag and starts scuffing towards the back entrance to the main school building. Maybe if he takes the back corridor, he can make it to his locker without someone hassling him. That seems like the best he can hope for today.

“No, of course not,” he says quietly instead. “The walk in the fresh air will do me good anyway.”
and can still be calmly browsing the shelves or reading at a desk.
He fumbles the keys twice before his fingers cooperate and he manages to get the lock open. Inside, he slips his shoes onto the rack and drops his keys into the bowl on the side table. He itches to escape to his room immediately, but he forces himself to do as he usually does and go to the kitchen first for a glass of water. Routine. Stick to the routine.
He blinks, eyes and brain coming back into focus. He’s standing under a thick grove of trees right down by the river’s edge where the narrow path widens out into a space large enough for a bench. The ground slopes sharply up away from the river so the bench is tucked into a nook, sheltered by the grass bank and the trees, invisible to the rest of the park. It doesn’t look like people come here much. The grass is overgrown and the bench weather beaten. It feels like a secret place. A hideaway from the world.
“You and Sam made my birthday actually not suck for once this year, and I just… wanted you to have a day. Like that.” Dean ducks his head. “Don’t laugh.”
“I’m going to have to stitch this.”
Since Dean got his fucking shit together and made his mouth say the words his heart has been screaming for close enough on a goddamn decade, the iterations of Cas’ take on Dean have gotten softer. There’s so much more gentleness now, the empathetic

“Ain’t overstepping, this feels awesome.”
and he freezes mid-step.
Cas glances up at him from under his lashes and the answering smile is a little wicked.
“Dude, we’ve been married since freshman year.” He swigs his coffee and holds out his left hand. A slim silver band glints on his ring finger. Beside him Cas lifts his own left hand and wiggles his fingers. There’s matching silver, shining and obvious under the diner lights.
Then Castiel realises the other man’s hands are trembling too. He’s staring down at his feet, breathing shaking enough that Castiel can hear it.
“What.” Dean growls without lifting his head from where his face is pressed into Cas’ collarbone. “The fuck. Are you doing. In my house.”
Only when they’re done eating and they’ve split off to head back to their respective afternoon classes does the thought pop back into Meg’s head. Partly due to the long, tight hug that Dean and Cas shared on the pavement outside the café before peeling off in different directions. Partly because Cas’ phone dings with a text not thirty seconds later, and an oh-so-casual glance sideways that absolutely was not aimed intentionally at Cas’ mobile rewards her with a glimpse of Dean’s name on the screen and the quiet satisfaction of being right in her stomach.
Dean meets his eyes and for an instant something surfaces in Dean’s gaze that turns Castiel’s mouth dry because in that second he knows with absolute certainty that Dean understands. Castiel doesn’t have to offer any kind of explanation or even say a single word, Dean already knows what it is to be in Castiel’s position.
My best friend and I share an anniversary with Cas and Dean - September 18th 2001 vs September 18th 2008. It's an auspicious date for meeting the people you love most.
And Dean does come too – how can he not with Cas making noises like
“We should introduce ourselves, right?” He steps closer to Castiel. “I’ll go first. I’m Dean.”
“Dean,” Castiel repeats softly, “take a breath.”
Some things are harder. Cas still isn’t all that great at subtlety, so things will either fly straight over his head or he’ll be so astonishingly blunt that Dean’s blindsided. One evening Dean says he’s going for a shower, winks at Cas. Cas just nods without looking up from his book, and Dean hovers in the doorway for a long minute without Cas catching on, so he ends up going by himself despite not really wanting to shower in the first place. And then Cas has a habit of calling Dean
Cas comes with his eyes screwed shut. His fingers grip convulsively on Dean’s shoulder, nails digging in just hard enough to send tiny shocks of pain down into Dean’s ribs, and that’s all it takes to tip Dean over the edge too. He follows Cas down with his face pushed into Cas’ hair and his own hand gripping Cas’ hip tight enough to bruise, the world whiting out around him.
