As expected, Steve was waiting in the lobby by the time Tony arrived. Steve was always perfectly punctual and often was where he needed to be ahead of time. Tony couldn’t have been any more different.
When they get there, Tony orders them a couple of drinks and they sip on them as Steve tells Tony about himself. He was born and raised in New York but they moved to Malibu when Steve was a teenager so his mom could get a nursing job at the local hospital because she had connections there. He started singing when he was a kid but he’s never had lessons. He’s so good despite that, however, that his friends beg him to perform at their drag shows on Friday nights even though Steve’s really not into any of that. Tony discovers that Steve’s smile makes his heart beat faster and that Steve’s the sweetest man he’s ever met. It’s all going great, until it’s not.
That’s when Tony started to cry in earnest. Gulping sobs wracked his tiny body and pinkish tears dripped from his face.
“Oh, jazz music, Jarvis. It was born here. Have you ever heard something as astonishing as this before?” Tony asks his butler - or, as he calls him secretly, keen protector - as Jarvis nears. “Dance with me, J!”
“And how do you plan on doing that?” Jarvis questions him suspiciously. “With the magic money that you pull from thin air, or from your nonexistent job?” He points to a man scooping horse poop from the streets. Tony grimaces.
Steve turns with a bright smile on his face, though it quickly turns to shock when he sees Tony standing beside Bucky.
There’s a cop bar that Tony frequents often when he comes to Malibu because the guys there barely even take a double look at him anymore and he can go get sloshed without any problems. It’s a perfect place to bring Steve since there won’t be any shenanigans for being famous. He knows that’s always overwhelming for people who haven’t encountered it much yet.
“Yeah, well, vacation’s over,” he said dismissively before heading toward the standardized black car parked a few yards away.
“And no holding hands or kissing,” another friend, Bruce, shouts. They’re all laughing and joking around and it helps mask Tony’s nervousness at the fact that Steve hasn’t even said yes yet.
Tony squirmed his way toward his mom and reached a swollen hand to touch her shoulder that settled just above his head.
He croons breathily, his voice just barely ghosting over the microphone. It doesn’t matter, though, because the crowd is silent and still. Each inhale and exhale crackles and rumbles over the sold-out stadium, each word desperately hung onto by adoring fans. Seemingly, the only thing to be heard within a one-mile radius is the smooth voice of Tony Stark and nothing else.
It’s moments like these that make Tony feel invincible. He holds the undivided attention of just under a hundred thousand people, and any mistake he makes is scrutinized. Every perfectly-pitched note worshipped. He holds these people in the palm of his hand and he can sculpt them however he pleases. He loves this feeling, but he hates it, too.
Tony concluded that his entire body was in pain and he started crying for lack of any better ideas. He was trapped in his car and he hurt and he couldn’t see his mom.
“You just want to be free, but you’re unable to do anything without any money. I see a whole lot of green in your future.”
Tony tries not to take offense to that because Steve’s expression says that he’s just genuinely curious about why an incredibly famous rockstar is occupying a dive bar. Tony can’t blame him for wondering.
“Oh, are you kidding me with this?” Tony groaned, shooing the thing away with his good arm. “Get it out of here.”
While Steve is in the bathroom, Tony is out on the stage, surrounded by a now empty bar, with a couple of Steve’s friends. They’re all kind of drunk and dancing around and Tony’s never had this much fun. Never really had any friends, actually. But it’s a nice feeling and he revels in it.
“Steve, Steve, Stevie, Stevie!” she cries when she enters. “You won’t believe it!” She plops down beside her father. “Tell him, daddy, tell him.”
Steve’s mother, Sarah, reads Natasha’s favorite story out loud while tailoring the new pink bow that will go on Natasha’s dress. It’s the story of the Princess and the Frog and Steve can’t say that he loves it as much as Natasha because, really, the thought of kissing a frog grosses him out. Natasha leans forward in anticipation when the ‘best part’ comes up; the one where the princess kisses the frog and the frog turns into a handsome prince. Natasha giggles happily and cheers for it to be read again, but Steve just shakes his head in disgust.
Besides, he still couldn’t believe that this was happening and there was a fairly good chance that Steve was just messing with him. Tony hoped that wasn’t the case.
That earns a grin from Tony. Money really is an issue with him. He wants to pay Jarvis more for all he has to put up with, but he can’t afford to. He wants to do many things, but the money holds him back very effectively.
“Don’t you worry, dad,” Steve says, “we’ll be there soon.” He brushes a finger over a picture of his father. He promised his father when he was younger that they’d have a restaurant, and that’s a promise he plans on keeping whether his father is here or not. He knows that’s what he would want and it will most definitely make him happy. He grins down at the picture, tears filling his eyes, before collapsing on his bed and falling straight to sleep.
A calloused hand is placed on Steve’s head, stroking his blond hair lovingly. “You can achieve anything you set your mind to, my boy. You never, ever lose sight of what’s important to you. Never forget that.”
“You’re still moping around about that restaurant?” his boss, Phil Coulson, asks him. He laughs at Steve’s weary nod. “How close are you?”
Steve rushes around the diner as quickly as possible, serving the plates that are stacked up on his tray and handing the checks out to finished customers. Around noon-ish, Steve spots a familiar group gathered around a table.
“Why do you have to make everything so difficult? I’m trying to do one nice thing for you and you have to go and throw it back in my face just because you refuse to let me drive! It’s not even that big of a deal. Maybe you are just a spoiled brat like everyone claims you are. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, but obviously this was a bad idea,” he ranted, sighing angrily with pure disgust evident in his eyes. He turned on his heel and started to stalk back to the tower.
He doesn’t remember being any more tired than he was at that moment but he refused to be rolled down the ramp in a wheelchair. Rhodey reached out a hand and helped Tony to his feet, supporting him as he made his way toward Pepper and Happy.
Steve laughs good-naturedly and sets down some freshly baked pastries in front of him. It’s his usual. Mr. Romanoff tells him to keep them coming until he passes out when Natasha comes bursting through the door.
“Something called an arc reactor has taken the last bit of money from you? I do quite wonder what that is…”
Tony tells him, explaining the dynamics of the bar. He tells him about the time he almost drowned in a dunk tank at a Malibu fair on his last tour and one of the cops saved his life and brought him out for a drink afterward. He leaves out the part where he was too high to tell which side was up when he was stuck in the tank.
Steve always loves the nights on the trolley with his mother. After a hard day - or fun and playful for him, at least - at work, he and his mom board it. He bounces at his mother's heels as they travel from Natasha’s house to the main street that the trolleys always scale. He watches meticulously - never tiring of the view - as the city lights transform into country skies and smells of home. He’s always fascinated in that childish way that everyone once was and he enjoys every single second of it. He presses his face up against the shimmering glass window that reflects the warm lights that come in contact with it. He smiles in amazement up until the final stop that brings him to his run-down house. They may not be the richest family money-wise, but they are most definitely the richest family where it counts.
A pair of green snakes with blazing red eyes wrap themselves around his body, productively keeping him glued to the chair.
“You want to take me on a date?” Tony muttered, still trying to wrap his head around this situation.
“Look, there’s a wishing star! If we make a wish, all our dreams will come true!” Steve informs his parents.
“Hap, just drop me here. I’ll call when I’m ready,” Tony says and he slips from the car as soon as it comes to a stop. He stumbles over the curb a little when his shoe’s sole catches on… well, something. He can’t tell.
The next time Tony woke up, he was lying in a bed that had scratchy blankets and a lumpy mattress. It definitely wasn’t his own bed.
And wasn’t that one of the greatest ideas he’d ever had? Really, what he wanted to do was curl up with a thousand cheeseburgers and go to sleep in an authentic bed. And maybe drink some water that didn’t have sand floating around in it.
He proceeds to tell Jarvis about his past, present, and future. About how Jarvis was always pushed around for his whole life; how, if he was married, he’d be pushed around by his wife, too; and about how, in his future, he’d be able to be the man he’d always wanted to be.
Just then, Natasha’s father walks in. Natasha rushes up to him to show him her new dress that Sarah had just sewed up for her. She chants ‘daddy, daddy’, and asks him how he likes the new dress.
At first, Tony didn’t react. He just kept scrolling through his blueprints on the tablet, assuming Steve was talking to someone on the phone and feeling a sudden pang of jealousy.
Steve feels a blush creep up his neck. Bucky knows how helpless Steve is when it comes to girls. Or - not that he’d ever tell the manly Bucky - guys, in his case. He was always somewhat small and scrawny when he was little but he grew a lot since then. He’s filled out enough so that he’s no longer lanky, but he’s still  not used to the way that girls look at him. It never happened when he was smaller, but it sure does happen a lot now. He can’t say that he minds it much, it just makes him feel like he’s not in his own skin sometimes.
“Wait, please,” Tony called out weakly. “I really like you, Steve, and I don’t want to ruin this. You can drive. Just forget I said anything.”
Steve steps into the small kitchen where his dad sits at the table, reading the newspaper. He stands as soon as he sees Steve and greets him with a genuine smile. There’s some boiling water on the stove and Steve knows immediately what that means. He throws ingredients in the pot with practiced ease, making some of his famous gumbo. Or, at least, somewhat famous gumbo. The only thing that matters is that his mom and dad like it.
“I swear that I will never, ever, ever kiss a frog,” he says. “I mean never, ever, ever, never will kiss a frog in this whole wide world. It’s just gross.”
Loki Odinson laughs maniacally as the guy that had asked for some more hair on the top of his head to grow back. The man had immediately been ecstatic, which is to be expected when dealing with Loki’s magic, but it completely backfires on the man. As he approaches a pretty woman, hair sprouts from every pore on his body, making him look more like a wolf than a man. The woman shrieks and scurries away, causing the man to look at himself in the reflective glass window beside him. He screams at it, very similar to the woman’s, and sprints away, presumably to keep everyone around him from looking at him.
The last card that Loki hands Jarvis isn’t facing Tony, so he can’t see it. He does notice the way that Jarvis’s eyes widen comically at the sight of it, but he doesn’t flash Tony the card’s face for even just a split second.
Steve catches onto his tone and makes an inquiring noise. It’s something that Tony could easily dodge, but for some reason, he feels compelled to tell Steve. He shoots him a sidelong glance to make sure he’s really listening, really cares. And Steve’s just looking him earnestly, his brows slightly drawn and lips taking a small downward turn. He’s concerned.
“Take three cards and I’ll look into your future,” he tells them. His eyes contain a crazed look and Tony’s sure that if he doesn’t oblige, something bad will happen to him. He smiles at the man, the most authentic smile he can muster, and takes three cards. He’s learned from an early age that angering the crazy people isn’t a good decision (Howard’s fist’s against his small body). He shakes the thought away and takes three cards, gesturing for Jarvis to do the same. Jarvis is his top priority as of right now, he needs to make sure that he’ll be all right.
Loki forcefully pushes the pair into a set of chairs stationed around a table. A heaviness settles on them - not exactly painful, but nearly there - and keeps them stationed in their seats. Tony’s eyes flash for a moment, thinking of the pain and the dampness of the cave, before he compresses the sight away and forces himself to concentrate on his breathing.
Tony Stark stands on the bow of the boat, smiling at the crowd with dazzling white teeth. Cameras lights flash as Tony steps down the ramp that connects the boat to the dock. He takes long strides to reach the dock, grinning the whole way. There’s an air of arrogance that follows him around that makes the guys jealous and the girls swoon. His devilish good looks may help a little bit, too.
“It caught me completely by surprise,” he informs him. Except, really, it hadn’t. He’s been crowned king for the past five years.
Steve stumbles into his room, his exhaust evident. His hair is matted and tangled and his clothes are crumpled and stained. He kicks off his worn Adidas shoes and proceeds to his dresser. He pulls out a few cents of spare change from the apron that he wears and drops the coins into a tin can that lays in the front of the top drawer. The front of it reads “Restaurant Fund” in his neatest handwriting. He sighs down at it, knowing that the meager change won’t do much to help him achieve his - and his father’s - dream. But his father is gone now.
There was no way that Steve was talking to him, right? There was no way that Captain America, the symbol of all things good and holy, would want to date him, Tony Stark.
“It’s because my father crashed our car when he was drunk. I was five and I watched my mother die. I just don’t trust people to drive me anywhere. I know it’s an irrational fear, but I can’t get over it.”
“Drinks are on me, everyone!” Tony suddenly announces. The crowd that had formed cheers and claps their hands.
He starts to take a phone from his back pocket to snap a picture, but Tony’s not having it. He’s drunk himself and this guy is riling him up and he’s about to say some vicious things that he knows he wouldn’t want Steve to hear right after meeting him, but he’s saved by a fist connecting with the guy’s face. Tony jerks in shock and turns to the right to find the owner of said fist to be none other than Steve. Sweet, polite Steve. Tony laughs up at him, delightfully surprised by the turn of events and entirely forgetting the scathing remarks that hung on the tip of his tongue. Steve just looks angry, though, and he’s shaking his hand like it hurts.
They make their way to the bar and Tony’s only spilled one person’s drink so far, and they didn’t even care because of who he is. It’s a blessing and a curse. When they finally reach the counter, Tony sprawls against it and finally takes a good look around. There’s something off about the crowd but he can’t quite put his finger on it, probably because he’s having trouble seeing straight.
Bucky leads Tony toward Steve, weaving through tons of colorful people. Tony’s no longer as drunk, though, and he can make out the costumes more than the blurs from before. It’s fascinating, really.
He drove the rest of the way to the burger place, gripping the wheel hard to stop his hands from shaking.
“Your restaurant,” Bucky cuts him off exasperatedly, rolling his eyes. “Working is all you ever do nowadays. Come on out and have fun for once. Maybe we could even meet some nice girls…” he trails off, wiggling an eyebrow.
Tony flinches away and hunches in on himself as if prepared for a physical blow. When Jarvis tells him not to trust a man, Tony listens. He doesn’t want the whole ‘captured’ situation to ever happen to him again, let alone get Jarvis involved.
Steve’s dad makes sure that his mother knows just how good the gumbo is, and that a gift like Steve’s cooking deserves to be shared. His dad tells Steve to invite everyone over for dinner. That’s how everyone in his small neighborhood gathers at his house, gobbling down some hot gumbo.
“They usually are. I didn’t know that guy and he was younger; probably fresh out of the academy. It’s really not a big deal, though. Things way worse than that happen pretty often.”
It ends with Jarvis managing to get his bulbous head stuck in a tuba and them toppling to the ground after trying to extricate him. Then, a mysterious man with bright green eyes behind a long black mop of hair’s shadow casts over them.
“Stevie!” Bucky cries when they find Steve sitting at his vanity. “Someone here wanted to meet you.”
Steve gazes at his dad, wondering how he’d gotten all that knowledge in his big head of his. He smiles and nods confidently at him, knowing exactly what he means.
Suddenly, a puff of green smoke settles across the whole room like fog rolling over a lake. A glowing skull mask appears on Loki’s face, making his eyes reflect a putrid purple color. He laughs menacingly, pulling a palm-sized mask with fangs from mid air. Loki holds it to Tony’s finger and the mask bites him, making it well up with blood. His blood fills the clear lines of the mask and turns it a crimson red color.
He scoops out a spoonful of the soup and lifts it to his mouth. It’s missing a little something. He picks up some hot sauce and drips in a few drops. He tastes it again. Perfect. He deals out one more spoonful and lifts it to his dad’s mouth, where he contemplates the taste with a furrowed brow. Steve stares up at him in anticipation.
“Where are my flapjacks?” Steve asks, avoiding the question completely. Phil chuckles and stacks the flapjacks on a plate and sets them on Steve’s tray.
When there was once again no reply, Tony reached for his seatbelt and clicked the button to release him. He fell about a foot to the ground, landing on splintered pieces of glass. It was enough to snap him fully back into reality, the world becoming clear once again.
The thought that Tony may have ruined the one good thing in his life because of his stupid need to drive made his knees feel weak. Steve was going to walk out on him, just like all the others, and it was no one’s fault but his own.
The lights in the bar dim and the ones on stage brighten. Then, the man on the stage starts singing. It’s like the world falls away and the only people left are Tony and the man. His words are clear and bright, lilting and melodic like an autumn breeze. Tony downs his gin in one go because he knows he’s not fucked up enough if he’s so quickly turning this guy into a poem.
Tony took a few more painful steps to get to Pepper. He studied her face, realizing suddenly how beautiful she really was.
‘You have to work to make your dreams come true, and that star there will just help give you a step in the right direction,’ his father’s words ring in his head. He sure as hell hoped that he was working hard enough to make his dreams come true.
Happy did as ordered, driving to the nearest burger joint as Tony drifted off to sleep, head pillowed on the window.
Steve looks shocked and incredibly angry all at once and he looks like he’s gearing up to give a furious, long rant, so Tony stops him before he can get too worked up.
“I know that I would. Why, I would kiss a whole hundred frogs if it meant I could marry a prince and be a princess,” she tells him dreamily. She squeezes Clint tightly, making his hair puff up irritatedly. He flies to the ceiling, allowing Steve’s mom to grab onto him.
He feels his body shrinking and the snakes loosening around him, and the next thing he knows, he’s lying on the cold cement ground. The last thing Tony remembers before the darkness engulfs him is that Loki’s spell must have come undone because he can finally move on his own again.
“Well now, why don’t you open the door?” his mother asks. He nods and pushes open the blue doors to reveal a dank and destroyed building. It’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
“Tony—” he calls, head on Tony’s shoulder, arm reaching behind to find his neck. “Tony, I think I’m—”
Howard feels as if he can see the anticipation growing in the room, almost as a cloud forming over them. The guards don’t bother hiding the shock in their expressions, and even Jarvis can’t fully disguise the curiosity, his eyebrows quirked.
Tony smiles in his response – Steve can feel it against his skin, but he can barely focus on chastising him for his teasing, because Stark’s hands follow the path above Tony’s, stopping at Steve’s pectorals. He cups them, eyeing Steve’s nipples predatorily.
“He likes the lilies,” Steve said, gesturing to the (obviously) fake copy of the painting he had hanging on one wall. By “likes,” he was referring to the fact that Monet had stared at it rather thoughtfully for
“Yeah,” Steve breathes. Tony presses a chaste kiss on the corner of his mouth, and Steve has to smile a little at their immediate protectiveness. “I—I just think we should maybe… take this to bed,” he says, panting.
Steve nodded, blinking slowly. His heart was pounding heavily, and his head hurt, a steady ache beginning to climb over his neck, as it had been beaten by a hammer.
“I want you to—uh,” Steve cuts himself short, moistening his lips. He catches Tony’s eyes watching them hungrily and his face heats, pleased. He knows he’s not the seductive type. To be able to hold their attention like this, then, it’s—well, Steve is finding it a little hard to speak. “To, to fuck me.” He knows his delivery isn’t perfect, but he’s certain it doesn’t matter as he hears Stark’s sharp inhale of breath. The sound fills him with confidence, and he wants to keep going. He flips himself in the middle of Stark’s legs, and leans forward, propping himself up on his elbows and lifting his hips.
His face flushes as he talks, as if he can’t believe he’s saying this, and Tony knows an opening when he sees one.
Steve, who, for all his abilities, was still not a mind reader, just stared, and Tony’s eyes – involuntarily, stupidly – snapped to his lips. To his pretty mouth that always seemed so soft (and in fact managed to be even
Steve wishes they could have kissed. Or hugged. Or touched in any way at all. Maybe it isn’t part of their arrangement, but still. He wishes.
“We need to do better,” Steve repeated as if Tony was questioning him on their attack formation. “Be more convincing.”
“And in the meantime, what will you do? Sleep in the hallway?” Stark asked. Sobriety made his voice sound warmer, Steve noticed. There was no trace of the sharp sarcasm he could have sometimes, when he was slurring out words. “You should rest. I… I have a quite comfortable couch, you know.”
. A friend of mine managed to save my ass at the last minute, when they attacked the van we were in.”
“The CIA guy – Everett Ross - thinks we should try moving him to Wakanda,” Rhodey says. “It’s still just an idea. It won’t be easy to negotiate, all the bureaucracy…”
“No,” he whispers when he feels Steve moving, because this is one of those mornings where they’re tangled up together. Having fallen asleep with his head on Steve’s chest, now Tony’s face is kind of on Steve’s shoulder, which, really, he’s not complaining. It’s still Steve. “Stop that.”
, he wasn’t insane in his first immediate impression – the man in front of their door is really Tony.
The thing is: Steve doesn’t even plan very far ahead. It’s quite a change, going from the man out of time to the man with all the time in the world, and the weight of it makes him dizzy. He knows what he wishes, but he also knows it’s not that simple – it’s not up just to him.
“That,” Steve says, and—his crinkled eyes seem especially bright and blue, but maybe it’s the angle, “sounds like a great idea.”
The man squinted his eyes at him in response. “Oh, you little…” He cut himself short, drawing in a breath, and looked at Steve, a bright smile plastering his face. “Yup, he is. We’re very sorry to bother you, sir, so now, if you could just…”
Steve moved awkwardly to place the pillow on the couch and pick up a blanket without knocking Tony off his lap. Dummy quickly appeared by their side, jumping on the couch and settling on the corner of Steve’s left thigh that wasn’t taken by Tony’s fur. He nested there as if it had always meant to be his spot.
,” Steve called, and this time Tony clearly didn’t have the advantage of catching a super soldier in an emotionally distraught state, because Steve caught up to him in no time, hand holding Tony’s arm. “We need to talk.”
“You,” he stutters, and Tony raises his head. Steve is staring at him as if he said something unfathomable. “You—did?”
“I regret it, you know. The way I reacted. I should never have attacked Barnes. He wasn’t any more responsible than a gun would be.” Tony doesn’t look at Steve as he speaks. Instead, he looks at his lap, where his and Steve’s hand are interlaced. “But just, seeing that… And then you… I just, I couldn’t think.”
innocent, and if Tony didn’t know better he’d think—“When I tried it on, I found the string very uncomfortable.”
Steve hurried to get up from the exam table, but sitting up made his spine ache in protest. He did his best to keep his expression under control. Back then, before the serum, he used to have those pains all the time, a result of his oddly twisted skeleton. He had tried to correct his posture, because God knew he didn’t need to look even shorter than he already was, but all those efforts had been useless.
Seven years, he thinks. He has five seconds and all the time in world, but he’d change everything in a heartbeat for those seven years.
Right now, he’s come to terms with it, he thinks, even as his stomach clutches pathetically just at the prospect of speaking to Tony alone. Regardless, he knows he’s not in a position to demand anything. That is just the reality of Steve’s choices, of the path that lead him here.
“I’m not upset,” Tony says, not wanting to create another glitching incident. “I’m just curious. Just asking.”
Steve is lying on a table, eyes closed, with the exact same expression Tony saw two days ago. He’s still in his uniform, though the upper part is open, where Tony had to place electrodes on his chest to check his heart rate. His arms are lying on his sides, an IV in the vein of his wrist.
“That sounds incredibly difficult,” he replied in a solemn voice, and Tony laughed, because, fuck yeah, someone with a sense of humor. Those were apparently hard to find anywhere in the universe, it seemed.
Tony lets out a pleased little noise that Steve enjoys probably more than he should, his cheeks heating and fodness curling low in his belly. He lets go of Tony’s feet to pick up the towel over Tony’s shoulders and take it over his head, his movements a little clumsy over Tony’s hair. He’s making a mess of it, but at least it isn’t dripping water anymore.
(Sam is acting strange, later that evening, when he and Steve share a cab back to the compound. He pointedly avoid Steve’s questions about Bucky, and when Steve finishes talking, he asks, “What about Tony?” As Steve frowns, he adds: “Did anything… happen?”
He was so distraught, he took a wrong turn when he found his street, going in the opposite direction of his apartment. He realized the mistake quickly, though, turning on his feet in a swift movement that quickly turned clumsy as he bumped into someone who was walking right behind him.
“She mostly rests these days, I hear,” Howard says, even though he doesn’t really remember if Gingerbread is the brown horse or the one with the white spot on its forehead.
Tony does not stick around to talk afterwards – there’s other things to worry about, and he has long learned that it does no good to interrogate sheer dumb luck when it comes across your path like that.
His men are neutralized now, though. Tony leaves the task of watching over them to Vision and Rhodey, flying out of the main chamber and into a hallway.
Steve smiled, and then, with a shock, realized he actually did believe Stark’s story. It made sense, in its own bizarre fashion, and it explained the disappearance of the other Pomeranian, as well as Stark’s dismissive behavior towards him. But he hadn’t gotten everything yet.
Tony takes a deep breath. His eyes close on their own, suddenly so heavy Tony can barely believe he’s been keeping them open for so long without a break. His stomach still clenches, the tension easy to read in his neck and shoulders.
The result is that they end up standing next to each other awkwardly in a crowded quinjet, and, every time Steve tries to say something, Tony makes sure to be very interested in literally anything else in the opposite direction.
He sits up and, a few steps from him, Tony gives him a smile. His hands are in his pockets – his hair has tinges of grey, but he’s younger than he was the last time Steve saw him. Steve stands up and walks towards him, noticing he’s younger himself – younger as he was the first time Tony died.
), so it’s a shock when it happens, the moment right after a rarely peaceful banter, in the living room, where Tony lets his eyes wander to Steve’s pink mouth and he thinks
“Hey.” Steve grins, but his expression is a little reflexive in a way that makes Tony worried. “Hard work,” he comments as they start walking towards the car.
“I’m,” Tony forces himself to spit out, even as Steve’s thumbs stroke his cheeks and he shakes. Steve’s hands are so big, so warm and he can feel they’re calloused but the way they’re holding his face, the way Steve is
“Just… give me a moment, okay?” He draws in a deep breath before lowering his hand and continuing, “I know you don’t wanna listen to this. Hell, I don’t even want to say it. Ok, that’s a lie, I do. Well, I do and I don’t, it’s complicated, my therapist is really gonna have a field day with this, but—look, hear me out, okay? I just… I just want to understand.”
what you’re blowing me off for?” Tony is shocked with indignation, but he doesn’t stop the kisses or the caresses on Steve’s hair. By now, he has enough experience with battle strategies that he knows you don’t cease your attack just because your opponent resorted to a low blow. “Come on, you can fill them later.”
But he couldn’t say any of that to Bruce. He’d sound whiney and unfair—it was, after all, ridiculous to resent the fact that the Avengers seemed to be doing very well without his leadership. He knew he should be glad things were working smoothly, instead of sitting there and complaining about how his back was aching.
“From what I’ve heard, the servants are quite used to cleaning your vomit,” Howard shakes even as he struggles to properly enunciate every word. “So I suppose they’ve got enough practice.”
The idea that this is Steve’s dream, though, is still too impossible for Tony to wrap his mind around. His last memory of Steve is of the weight of his body trapping Tony to the floor, furious eyes pining him down as he lifted the shield above his head.
At this, Tony stands up, taking a few steps towards him. His clothing is rumpled, as though he moved often in his sleep. “You… What?”
Steve looks at him, baby blues growing from frustration to confusion. Tony might be wrong, but he thinks he also sees a glimmer of a hopeful expression cross his face for a moment.
The elevator door opened to the main floor, and Tony lowered Steve to the ground, letting him run around to do whatever, as Tony walked towards the first chair he saw and dropped his body on it.
“You. Uh.” Tony stands there as his brain melts, leaking out of his ears and flooding the sand with genius I.Q. “You… own one of those?”
“Indeed it does,” Howard agrees. He’s astonished by the lack of an irreverent reply; Tony has never lost one opportunity to be snippy with him.
Tony turns toward the stage and watches as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty steps into the spotlight. He’s dressed in a colorful, gaudy outfit and he’s wearing makeup that would be astoundingly corny on anyone else. The way he’s moving shows that he’s confident in himself, though, which makes him even sexier. Tony’s instantly drawn to him.
Tony knows that if he was able to move, he would have recoiled from those harsh words. Mum and dad never really cared enough to give him the time of day, let alone money.
Happy’s been waiting outside for them so they get into the car again and Tony directs him to the nearest 24-hour grocery store. They go in and Tony picks a pack of frozen peas from one of the freezers and two rolls of gauze from the first aid aisle. He opens the gauze and wraps the pack of peas around Steve’s hand before they even get to the checkout. They’re both giggly, running on leftover adrenaline and some booze, and it’s the best first date Tony’s ever been on. Dysfunctional and all.
“It’s a shame that you’re working so hard. I just want you to be happy and meet your beautiful princess one day; I want you to find love.”
“Come in,” he calls, wiping the white residue from his nose as he does. The door swings open wide and, sure enough, Happy Hogan is standing in the frame.
“Now, won’t you boys shake a poor sinner’s hands?” Loki questions the two. Jarvis takes one of his hands easily and Tony thinks that - if Jarvis trusts this man all of a sudden - maybe he can too? But then the remembers the unsettling feeling that he got when Jarvis was looking at that card. Maybe it isn’t such a good idea. But, before he knows it, his hand is reaching up to shake Loki’s hand without his permission.
“Okay. If you’re willing to wait, I’ll come.” He smiles brightly again. Tony thinks he could get used to that smile.
There’s a sudden, quick knock on the door that Tony easily recognizes as Happy’s, even in his intoxicated state.
“You guys know I have two left feet,” he tells them, “Besides, I’m taking an extra shift tonight to try to get some extra money for-”
“Let’s get the hell out of here,” Tony whispers in Steve’s ear, eager to, well, get the hell out of there. He grabs Steve’s hand and drags him out the door before the angered rookie could recover from the brutal punch directed his way.
“I’d be better if I had some more booze,” Tony says with a lopsided grin. “I’m sure we can find something around here somewhere.”
“Thank you, mama,” he stutters out. He can’t tear his eyes away from the pot full of memories to meet her eyes. He wraps her in his arms and hugs her tightly, sniffling quietly.
He manages to break through the swarm of people and get to the front of the crowd where Tony sings and strums his guitar, cackling with a boy who dances around like he has ants in his pants. His perfected carefree and charming mask is most definitely slipped on. Jarvis still notices the way that Tony’s eyes widen a fraction when he gets bumped unexpectedly by a fan or the way that his eyes reflect something similar to a cornered animal. The last kidnapping had taken a toll on him and he doesn’t think that he’ll ever see those bright chocolate eyes the same ever again. At least, not as innocent as they were before. There’s something cold lurking beneath the surface, but Jarvis doesn’t ask. He knows that he needs time and time is something that Jarvis has.
“Steve, you genius. I’m going to need about a hundred of your delicious baked goods for the ball tonight. Will this cover it?” she questions, handing him a few hundred dollars.
“You’ve got about as much chance of getting that restaurant as I do of winning the Kentucky Derby!” he chortles.
None too soon, the concert comes to an end and Tony sidles away to find a drink. He’d managed to sober up during his time on stage and he’s ready for a few more shots or maybe a joint. He comes across a few beer bottles in his dressing room’s mini-fridge, and he scours up a dime bag of coke from last week in the back of a drawer that he forgot about. He cracks open the beers and snorts a few lines on his vanity in between sips. His heart flutters too weakly and too fast in his chest.
Tony nodded his head wearily at her. Sure enough, he felt a pinch in the crook of his elbow and his eyes started to droop.
“Hey, any place with drinks is my scene, don’t ya worry,” he tells the guy. His words are a little slow leaving his mouth but he thinks they make sense. The little smile the guy gives him encourages him.
After a few seconds of waiting for a response and receiving none, Tony started to wriggle from the awkward position he was in. It took him a few moments to realize that he was hanging upside down and another minute to realize that it was because he was buckled into the back seat of his father’s Mercedes. And it was upside down.
“No, there’s nothing I have to do. I was just in captivity for three months. There are things that I want to do, such as getting an American cheeseburger. And the other-”
Loki slings an arm over Tony’s shoulders, guiding him down the street and through an inky alleyway. Jarvis trails closely behind them.
“I have a present for you, my boy,” his mother calls from behind him. Steve turns around excitedly, spotting the wooden brown pot in his mother’s hands. There’s a silky red bow wrapped around it. Steve smiles, tears gathering in his eyes, remembering those special nights when they’d all gather around the pot and make the best darn gumbo soup ever known to man. He misses those nights.
“What are you sorry about? That guy was way out of line back there. I thought you said they were all nice there.”
Tony frowns. Has he been one of those people that pushed Jarvis around. He assumes that he is and that makes him more than a little upset. Everyone leaves him, including his mother and father, and he knows that it’s his fault. Maybe he pushes Jarvis too hard and Jarvis will end up leaving him too? He can’t handle the thought of another one he loves leaving him.
“This should be just fine, Tasha. This’ll cover it!” He hugs the money to his chest. He can put the down payment on the restaurant he’s been looking at with all these bills!
Edwin Jarvis charges down the street with Tony Stark’s luggage tucked under his arm like footballs. He spots a crowd forming a little way’s further and assumes that that’s where Tony is. As he gets closer, he can hear the faint sound of music. Tony, for sure.
After they buy their things, they go sit on a parking barrier in the empty lot. Tony’s on the verge of sobering up but, for the first time in a long time, he doesn’t feel the need to go remedy that immediately. Steve’s enough to fill that void.
And, shit, Tony could feel his heart flutter, finally realizing that Steve was talking to him. He knew his eyes widened in surprise, so he forced himself to relax.
Tony somehow makes it backstage with who he now knows is Bucky Barnes. He’s in search of Steve Rogers and maybe a joint because someone’s bound to have one. Bucky explained that the bar they’re occupying has a drag night every Friday and that’s why there were so many drag queens performing and in the crowd. He knows someone will have a joint.
Sarah wraps the bow around Natasha’s waist and waves Steve along, telling Natasha that they’d better get going home. Before he’s shooed from the room, though, Steve speaks up.
The slow song fades out and the band begins to play a more upbeat, exhilarating tune. It’s a sign that his show’s drawing to an end and he’s just gotta give one more push to finish off strong. The crowd is roaring now and they’re dancing and rocking with the music. Tony’s voice has taken on a more gravelly sound that falls and rises with expertise.
“Is that so,” she smirks smoothly. She throws a frog hat over her cat, Clint’s, head. “Well, here’s your prince.”
“I-. I know who you are,” Steve replies, taking his hand in a surprisingly warm grasp. “What are you doing here?”
“Now, that’s not quite right,” his dad corrects him. “It only helps you a little bit. You have to work to make your dreams come true, and that star there will just help give you a step in the right direction.”
Tony rolls his eyes and slumps against the door. His arm is awkwardly caught between the door handle and his body, but he’s too focused on the way his tongue flops numbly in his mouth to care too much. After what feels like an eternity but is probably only minutes, Tony looks up to see a pink neon light that says “Bar.” Tony’s instantly drawn.
Steve can’t help but feel a slight pang of jealousy. Prince Tony Stark is a pretty handsome man, and he wouldn’t mind getting to see him up close. The problem about guys like him is that they’re usually snooty, spoiled brats that don’t know how to handle themselves when they’re denied something that they want. Steve’s about the opposite of that and he doesn’t think he can handle someone of that caliber.
“You’re Stark, ain’tcha,” he says, garbled. Tony nods and smiles and tries to play it off placatingly, but the guy keeps going. “Ya know, my ex-girl fuckin’ loved ya, for whatever fuckin’ reason,” he hiccups. “Mind if I send her a picture so I can show her how much of a fuckin’ loser you are in person?”
He rolled over from his position on his back and lifted his head up to look past the front seats where his mom and dad should’ve been. Howard was no where to be seen but Maria was still hanging from her seat belt. Her eyes were closed and her chest was shaking with hitched movements.
His first reaction was panic. His chest heaved up and down and his breath wheezed inside of his lungs. His eyes shot around the car in panicked bursts, seeing nothing but sprinkling glass and leather.
“Daddy, I want that dress!” she informs him, pointing to a book that stands on a pedestal. It’s Sarah’s book full of designs that Natasha likes to sort through sometimes just for fun. “It would make me look pretty, doncha’ think?”
Loki snaps his fingers, making a series of candles burn bright with flames. A purple door seemingly appears from nowhere and Loki drags Tony and Jarvis inside. Tony smiles uneasily at the man and tells himself to keep control of his emotions. A panic attack right now won’t help him or Jarvis right now.
The girls rush to greet him as he approaches the dock, each hoping desperately for a chance with the notorious Prince Tony Stark of Maldonia. He laughs with them - a deep, throaty sound - that makes them all sigh dreamily. He struts away from them, waving goodbye to them as he goes.
“Hey, Tony,” one of the guys, Clint, says, slinging an arm over Tony’s shoulder. “Will you sing for us?” He’s slurring his words and supporting himself mostly on Tony, but he’s smiling and his eyes are sparkling with hope when he says it. Who is he to say no?
“Do not trust this man,” Jarvis mutters just loud enough for Loki to hear him. Loki hisses and steps closer to the pair.
“This was important, Tony. R&D said they’d be willing to wait for another half hour for you, but no longer. Can you please do this for me, just this one time?”
“Mornin’, Mr. Romanoff,” Steve greets as Natasha’s father strides in the door. “Congrats on being crowned king of the Mardi Gras parade.”
“You’re… You’re Tony Stark,” a voice says, incredulous. Tony’s used to it, though. The sky’s blue and grass is green and Tony Stark is a rock star, known to everyone in the nation.
“You look very pretty, my girl. I wouldn’t expect much less from the greatest seamstress in all of New Orleans,” he tells her happily. He scoops her up in his arms and carries her toward Sarah.
Hey guys! Here's the second chapter. I know that it's kind of long, but I only fit in about ten minutes of the movie, so this seems like it'll be a long fic. Hopefully no one minds. Drop me a comment if you have the time because they make my day when I see them. Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!
His dad’s frown deepens, and Steve knows that the gumbo isn’t as good as it usually is if his dad doesn’t like it. Before he gets too down on himself for his less-than-superior cooking skills, his dad smiles down at him.
When they got to the bottom of the ramp of the plane, two soldiers strode over with a stretcher between them.
Tony nodded before his eyes slipped closed. The next thing he knew, his father was pulling a chair up next to his bed.
“All in the past now, but I still like to check up on him when I get a chance. Like to make sure he’s still buried deep in the ground.”
He arrives at work a little later than he usually does, which makes his boss more than a little unhappy. He serves the food with all the smile and charm he can muster, keeping the picture of the restaurant in his mind. The more tips he gets, the faster he can get out of there and get his own restaurant.
When he looks back up from his drink, the performer is dismounting the stage and walking toward the bar, stopping every so often to sing seductively to different patrons. Tony’s eyes are glued to him unwaveringly. Eventually, he makes it over to the bar and his eyes make contact with Tony’s, piercing him to the core. He’s never seen a lovelier shade of blue in his life.
Right now, though – yeah, he’s not angry. Mostly he’s just… confused, still feeling the lingering touches of Steve on his skin.
Steve squirms again, because Tony is in love with the most stubborn human being on the planet. “I have to go,” he says, visibly trying to sound firm even though his voice is all slurred.
They keep going, each setting their own pace, a cascade of noises and praise flooding the room. The sounds echo in Steve’s ears, and it’s impossible for him to focus, but he can vaguely grasp Tony’s usual rambling, filled with wonder and admiration, and Stark’s breathy endearments, sometimes whispered as if they aren’t meant for anyone else to hear, not even Steve.
Steve nods, encouraging. There’s a frantic energy coming from him. Tony bets he himself doesn’t fully understand it.
Steve’s body shudders, and there’s a clear glitch on the room around them. Tony’s hand tenses on the back of his neck.
The thought hits him like lightning, and it’s as if an electric current takes over him. Since when did Tony Stark ever care about what was easy?
And Tony knows this. He really, really does, which is what makes everything so damn hard, right now. He imagines young Steve becoming friends with James Barnes, watching him die, and then later trying to protect him. Finding out about the Winter Soldier, about his crimes, and still trying to fight, to solve it, to save him somehow. Stubborn, self-righteous Steve Rogers, who would never leave a friend behind. Who would keep secrets to protect those he cared, those he—
When Tony finishes opening his shirt, his hands climb back to Steve’s shoulders to pull it down his arms, and the darkness of his eyes is almost too much to bear. Steve longs for his mouth, for Tony's kisses to devour his lips, to mark his face with beard burn.
While he dresses, Tony watches him, in silence. When Steve finishes, he turns towards him, unsure of what to say. To his surprise, Tony smiles.
“Of course,” Tony replied, a little unsettled. “Okay, great talk, always nice to catch up, but, uh, honey?” He gave a little squeeze on Steve’s arm, nodding towards the elevator with what he hoped wasn’t too transparently desperate. “We should go—don’t want to be late for breakfast!”
So Steve turned towards the other one – that one had especially fluffy fur, and was staring at him with something that seemed more like curiosity than anything else. Steve smiled at him, and, for a strange moment, something was oddly familiar about the dog’s gaze.
“We fought. Badly,” he says, every word painful to come out, because he can see the realization starting to flood Steve’s face, and he’s never seen Steve look that lost, that hurt. “It started out stupid, but then it got—it got ugly.” He draws a sharp breath. “I lost it. I attacked Barnes, and you stopped me.”
They stay in their subtle sway, even when the song changes. After a while, Tony helps him take a few simple steps. He takes his hand to Steve’s chest and helps him to move within the rhythm; then he holds Steve’s hand, takes it over his head and helps Steve spin him and pull him back in. And he grins brightly the entire time.
Steve’s chuckle is muffled against the collar of Tony’s shirt. “No, we didn’t,” he says, and something about that, about the knowledge that Steve’s mind didn’t rewrite this part of their story (the first of their many, many messes), floods Tony’s chest with warmth. He wants to turn around and hug him. He focuses on staring at the side table next to the bed instead. “I couldn’t stand you.”
“Yeah?” Stark asked, and Steve was almost angry at him for doing so, because he didn’t want to have to agree one more time. He just wanted Stark to take his answer, hold his wrist, and—
Steve raised his eyebrows. Neither of the dogs seemed to mind, though, both looking at him with huge, expectant brown eyes, as if Steve had a hidden treat only they knew about.
I'm super excited to post this! It's the first time I've ever finished a non-oneshot fic of any kind.
All reason vanished. Steve used his superior weight and pushed past Howard. He couldn’t even stop to enjoy the older man’s stumble and landing with a loud thud. He could barely manage a coherent thought. Tony’s room was a place he could never forget, even though this place was a labyrinth.
Their lips met slowly but passionately. Yearning, loss, and regret poured into the kiss. It was everything they had missed and desired and more. Steve nipped at Tony’s bottom lip and Tony immediately gave in. Steve licked into Tony’s mouth and the world fell apart, leaving only their earth-shattering kiss.
Tony thinks as he sobs on the bedroom floor or the bathroom floor clutching a ring of metal in his trembling hands.
He was a sobbing, remorseful mess afterward. There was nothing to be forgiven. He explained that even though their relationship ended, his history with her would always remain. It didn’t change the fact that she was one of the first people to support him on his heroic journey (even though her feelings toward that did change), and he was still Iron Man.
He really didn’t mean to show up unannounced. But earlier a gallery owner had approached him about one of the paintings, thanks fo his dedicated lecturer, and Steve could barely stop himself from doing cartwheels all the way to Tony’s house. He was beyond elated. All he wanted was to share the moment with Tony.
A week passed and nothing happened. Steve kept using the mug and there was the occasional ogling of a shirtless chest, but Tony had managed to keep his reactions in check. Other than Clint, nobody mentioned it. Natasha would raise her eyebrows in a way that told you that she knew exactly what was going on and she was just waiting for you to tell her..
The worst part was that Tony knew he could never have him. Steve was too good for him. He wanted to maintain a friendship. So if that meant letting his crush use his mug once, so be it.
Once again, Tony did not feel an ounce of anger. He felt possessive, but his jealousy was directed towards the mug for being able to held in Steve’s hand like that. He filled the mug up with water and drank, leaning his head back leaving his Adam’s apple ripe for viewing. And now Tony was thinking about licking that.
Tony tasted freedom, something completely foreign to him. The shackles that he had worn ever since he could remember were finally gone. He wondered what it would feel like to never feel that aching pain in his body again. What it would feel like to fall asleep and wake up in peace and security, feeling loved. A future he had forbidden himself from wanting was finally within his reach. He felt as though he was walking on air. Or perhaps walking into the sunset with his knight in shining armor?
Rhodey was not that kind. He was an inquisitive little shit, always had been. As soon as he arrived he noticed Steve drinking from the infamous mug on the couch next to Tony. They were a friendly distance apart, but Rhodey knew his best friend well enough to notice the slight shuffling of his feet and furtive glances to the other man. Rhodey could barely contain his laughter. It was like seeing him as a giddy teenager all over again.
Tony couldn’t help but be entranced by the way Steve moved without a care in the world. He still felt guilty for Steve, yet here Steve was. He began moving towards him and Steve grinned when he saw him.
“Just fixing my bike, hope you don’t mind me in your space,” Steve says walking closer to Tony. Tony barely manages to croak out his answer, which was probably best because if he could speak coherently, he would probably start begging Steve to take him on the workshop table.
he thinks as he tips back another glass and drowns himself on his sorrows until his vision is hazy and he can no longer feel his limbs (or his heart, especially that).
It wouldn’t even take long for him to fly to Germany. Maybe Rhodey was right? What harm could this do that hadn’t already been done? There weren’t big enough pieces of his heart left for him to break.
Of course, there was also the whole figuring out if Tony even liked him back thing. But he tried not to think about that too much.
Any other day she may have stopped and picked up somebody. Everybody looked absolutely tantalising in their finest, but she had a mission.
The elevator finally dinged and Steve pressed further into the corner. Tony slowly made his way to the kitchen, his exhaustion evident in the slow drag of his steps. Steve took a deep breath and mussed up his hair a bit. He prayed this would work.
Sometimes Tony hated him because he chose Bucky. Tony always feared Bucky, even before they knew that he was back. Tony knew how special their relationship was and Tony hated him for allowing Tony to fall in love in such a manner he knew he would reciprocate. Tony knew he was the second choice, and he was horrified that it was now a proven fact.
They were unsure of the future. Everything was uncertain as they entered unprecedented circumstances in their relationship. But they loved each other. Utterly and entirely. They were consumed by it. The two years had done nothing but intensified it. The potential of a future together was all the incentive they needed to at least try. Starting with a kiss under the stars.
He knew now that he could never let himself love or care for anybody ever again. He should never put anybody through the pain of loving him. Nobody could handle it. It wasn’t there fault. Tony Stark was unloveable. High mantainence.
“I’m not going to let you hurt him again. Let me take him and nobody gets hurt.” Steve could hardly believe the words coming out of his mouth. He’d never threatened anybody before. He didn’t want to be violent. He didn’t want to actually make his words a reality and see what his hands could do.
Put him in the same tower as Tony Stark and he becomes a fumbling, bumbling mess. He didn’t what it was about Tony, but he seemed to bring out the best and worst in him and it was fascinating, thrilling even. Tony was an enigma but Steve was willing to spend the rest of his life trying to figure him out.
To be honest, he just did a fair amount of punching, taking down a bunch of goons in this base that could easily be in a picture right next to a dictionary’s definition of
“No, sweetheart,” Stark says, with a sad smile. He strokes Steve’s bangs off his forehead. “He’s not as receptive as you, I’m afraid.” At Steve’s frown, he adds, “Oh, don’t get me wrong – he’s absolutely wonderful, and”—his fingers trail down over Steve’s face, finding his mouth, and his thumb strokes Steve’s bottom lip—“I think he might be even sweeter than you, when he allows himself to be.” His voice grows wistful, gaze distant for a moment, as if he’s imagining touching the other Steve instead. “I just don’t think I’m the person he’d want to see that.”
“Oh my God. I knew it – evil. Manipulative.” Tony raised his finger accusingly. “I cannot believe I fell for your treacherous ways. You are supposed to be a model of virtue. A paragon. What do you have to say for yourself?”
So he nods. “I’m okay.” From the corner of his eye, he can see Rhodey and Bruce watching them in stunned silence, but he barely registers it, too focused on Tony to think of anything else. He takes his own hand to rest over his, touching it hesitantly, unsure if Tony will flinch or pull away.
“Steve,” Tony heard himself saying. He had stood up at some point and his hand climbed from Steve’s forearm to his shoulder. He wasn’t sure of what he was going to say – he wanted Steve to focus on leaving, on planning an escape if it was necessary. He didn’t want Ayesha to keep reminding him of how deluded he was.
“You have got to be kidding me,” Tony said, as Steve just stared at him expectantly, tongue hanging out from the corner of his mouth. “Weren’t you tired?”
But then Steve didn’t kill him, jamming the shield into the reactor instead, and, see, the thing was—sometimes, at night, when he couldn’t sleep thinking of Steve in a distant country, Steve on the run, Steve lying to him, Tony almost wished he had.
“You,” Steve replies immediately, because, isn’t it obvious? “Want you, Tony, want…” He trails off, unable to speak, focusing instead on pressing more kisses along the line of Tony’s neck, feeling his muscles pulsing, the smell of his skin.
He’s not really confused anymore. He is, after all, a genius, and as blindsided as he was by the world in Steve’s mind, he’s clever enough to have taken all the information in, by now.
humans to do anything,” Stark continued. “But they can give some of you the means to do what they want. So some humans are chosen to be… like, the manifestation of specific things that are supposed to be important. You’re blessed with special abilities to help guide humanity in a better direction. Uh, do you know Greek mythology? Like… Percy Jackson and stuff?” Steve stared at him, shocked at the abrupt change of direction, but he nodded. "Okay, so, uh, you must know—they had legendary heroes in the Greek myths, right?”
“I guess I was wondering if you ever… You know, if you ever regret it. Or—or if you think, I don’t know, that it could’ve been different. Somehow.”
He explains what his plan is - where the kitchen is going to go, where he’s going to place the tables, and points to the ceiling where a giant chandelier will go - while he strides around confidently.
His vision swam, making the broken glass raining down around him look beautiful, the shards glimmering in the sunlight. He could hear horns blaring, but he couldn’t identify exactly what was making so much noise or why. The sudden scent of burning rubber assaulted him and he crinkled his nose in distaste.
“Well, that’s just swell, Natasha. My mama always used to say that the quickest way to earn a man’s heart is through his stomach,” he says with humor laced in his tone. He pats the big belly of Natasha’s father and he laughs along with Steve.
