If Natasha makes anything of it, it doesn’t show. She rubs the back of Steve’s knuckles. “We all want to find him, Steve. It wouldn’t hurt to trust us a little,” she murmurs.
Steve wakes up to the smell of cake. That is, cloyingly sweet, with a hint of vanilla and milk. He opens his eyes slowly, and the blinds are rolled up and the windows flung open. The sun is shining in, and Tony is sitting beside him, naked and unashamed and holding a slice of cake.
It’s a command from Steve with a privacy protocol. Search, identify, and surveil Sergeant James “Bucky” Barnes, also known as The Winter Soldier. Missing, found, and missing again as of six months ago. Tony frowns at the monitor. He knows he hasn’t read it wrong, but can’t believe it; he reads it again.
He never expected to have become friends with such a wild, raucous bunch of people who share his penchant for violence and self-sacrifice, but he’d never fathomed the millennium, either, and yet here he is, a decade and a half into it.
Somehow, in the span of time of Steve coming back from Washington, of them settling in together, he’d done this. He’d asked JARVIS to do this for him, and keep it from Tony.
It’s only now that the adrenaline truly wears off, and that look Tony’s giving him, that Tony’s here,
“Shut up,” Steve says, equal parts angry and relieved. He tucks his arm under Tony’s shoulder and lifts him up.
Besides, Steve reasons, Tony has a habit of grabbing Bruce’s hand when they’re swept up in conversation, and Tony will laugh and reach over and bop Bruce’s nose when Bruce gets too serious or morose. Tony absently massages Natasha when they’re seated beside each other, either during a debrief or while lazing around and watching a movie; he’ll just reach over and pinch at the muscle between Natasha’s neck and shoulder, and Natasha always lets out a hiss of satisfaction. Tony shoves Clint or squeezes his arms when they get competitive over any sort of game. And Tony always make a point to ruffle Thor’s hair, whenever he enters a room with Thor in it.
Steve feels light. For the first time in a long time, warmth has spread over his chest, and he feels loose. Nothing matters. The flask, small as it is, refills as it empties, and
Tony turns, eyebrows furrowed at first at being shouted at, then his face brightens when his gaze lands on Steve, who is already making his way to him; the smile on his face makes Steve’s traitorous heart swell.
Steve sits in silence with his sketchbook open in front of him. His mind humming with the thoughtless motion of twirling a pencil between his fingers. In front of him was a grand view of Central Park.
Rhodey levels him with a look. “I don’t care who you’re with, Tony. I don’t think anyone’s ever going to be good enough for you. But you were happy, so I was happy. Simple as that.”
“Okay,” Sam says, leaning against the kitchen counter and scrolling through his phone. Steve frowns, noting Sam’s feigned indifference.
“No,” Steve says, and he’s shocked by how immediate his response is. “No we can’t,” he amends, because they really can’t—they have about a month and a half left. It’d be suspicious if they weren’t kissing in public.
Steve expects a lot of things. It’s in his nature to be prepared. There’s nothing he can do in Washington, what with Natasha spilling everything on the internet and journalists requesting interviews at every turn. So he packs up his things, pre-terminates his apartment lease, and tells Sam that he plans on looking for Bucky.
“You know I can access my messages from my laptop,” Tony says, taking a step back and reestablishing acceptable space between them.
Tony sighs. A few days ago, when they’d bumped into Steve, he’d felt a shame so deep that he couldn’t even face him. But Steve had looked so earnest and sincere, like there was no bad blood between them. If Tony’s being honest, it’s not like there ever was any, anyway—it was just easier to paint Steve as the bad guy rather than ever admit that maybe Tony was wrong. After all, he’d never met anyone quite like him, never met anyone who understood him the way Steve did.
Steve collects himself quickly, schooling confusion off his face. “Right,” he says, mimicking Tony’s smile. “Right,” he says again, mostly to himself.
Pepper takes a sip of her coffee as Steve tries to engage Tony in conversation. Tony had used words like
“Tony please.” Steve’s voice is barely above a whisper. He touches Tony’s thigh, and Tony jerks at the movement. Steve winces. A moment passes, then: “I need you,” Steve admits, finally.
, he loves magic and would love to see the way Tony’s eyebrows would knit trying to figure that one out.
They only have three months to get their cover established, so they go on dates almost weekly. On their second date—a leisurely stroll in Central Park, Tony had leaned over and wiped some ice cream off Steve’s chin.
“No, you don’t,” Steve says, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist. “C’mere.” He leads them to the couch and sits Tony back down. He doesn’t need to say anything—Tony immediately buries his face in Steve’s shoulder and lets out another soft whimper, like he’s holding it back.
“When you’re not Iron Man,” Steve finishes for him. He feels unpleasantly lightheaded. “All this time?”
“Now let’s go back to where we left off,” he says, “before we were so rudely interrupted by our feelings.”
He stays in bed for a bit longer, thinking about Tony’s hands. He jolts out of his bed when he feels the first flush of arousal, not sure if it was decent to think that way, after Tony had so soundly rejected him.
!” Tony continues, snatching his hand away from Steve’s and throwing his hands in the air. “Jesus Christ, Steve. They were just HYDRA agents.”
“I’m not laughing,” Steve says soothingly, rubbing a hand up and down Tony’s back. He’s never seen Tony cry before, and it makes a lump form in his throat, but he pushes past it.
“I’m just really tired,” Tony says, laughing despite the tears running down his cheeks. “But I’m okay.”
—it was more up Bucky’s alley. It really wouldn’t be believable for Steve to suddenly up and walk around with Tony, who
Steve laughs a little to himself, embarrassed by how giddy he feels—it’s been a while, since he’s felt this, like he has a
Steve sighs in frustration then looks around the almost empty street—it’s lunchtime, and there aren’t many people milling about, having settled on a restaurant or gone home. Steve’s gaze lands on a man ostensibly doing just that. Steve walks toward the man as he pulls off his glove and punches in the code to his building.
“Come on,” he says, clambering off Steve then holding a hand out to help him up. “Let’s go for a swim.”
“There. I’ve set up a tracker and I’m having JARVIS filter through everything Natasha sent out to the world,” Tony says. “That should be a start.”
When they’re done, they step outside of the bar and Tony lights a cigarette. “Where to next?” He asks.
“Okay, okay,” and before Tony can move, Steve wrenches away, crossing the distance from the couch to the door in the largest steps he can muster.
“Go get some rest,” he hears Tony say to Natasha. There’s a beat, and Steve can tell Natasha’s rolling her eyes.
It sends a thrill through Steve, this sudden openness, but he’s quick to tamp it down. It’s all practice, anyway. Still, it’s nice to have Tony this close, a constant warm body, kissing and holding hands. Steve tries to live in the moment instead of worrying about what this could all mean. He’s good at that.
“It’s about justice. About taking a stand.” Tony’s voice softens. “The difficulty of it all.” A beat, then Tony turns to Steve: “Anyway, that's why I thought you’d like it.”
“If it’s in my closet then it’s mine,” Tony sniffs, pulling down on the sleeves to hide his hands as he wraps his arms around himself. Steve chuckles softly, shakes his head. Tony sidles up to him, and they stand beside each other, arms barely touching.
“What?” Steve wants to laugh at how nervous he feels, but he can’t, his heart hammering too hard against his chest.
Thor sits up a little straighter. “Indeed, Anthony,” he says. Tony stops in his tracks. “Even I, for all I’ve seen, am amazed at your abilities.”
It happens more than once, which is what tips Steve off. Tony’s acting as if nothing has changed, and that’s a good thing, it’s what Steve
They arrive in the Tower soon enough, and it’s still early in the day that Tony can still make it to meetings. Steve and Thor are eating their second breakfast in front of the TV when Tony steps out of the elevator, looking immaculate despite the frown on his face.
“Yup,” Tony says, and okay. Maybe he needs to spend a day or two really figuring out who the problem is, here. (It’s him. He knows this. He’s always the problem.)
Steve wanders around the city a bit more, following crowds until he ends back at the Plaza Mayor. The Old City looks beautiful, lit up by bright lights strategically placed to highlight building facades, the crowds bustling with university students and tourists.
Steve’s about to pack up, make a dash down the building to catch Stark before he makes his exit, but Stark’s gaze locks on his. He smirks at Steve, then winks.
“Yes. Thank you,” Steve says, and they’ve backed away enough from each other that by now Steve’s by the door. “See you,” Steve says, and flees.
There’s already a pot of coffee waiting for them in the kitchen. Tony lets go of Steve’s hand immediately upon seeing the coffee and pours himself a cup, moaning softly after his first sip. He takes a seat on one of the bar stools by the counter and drinks quietly, and Steve’s used to this version of Tony, too, decaffeinated and inattentive.
Tony isn’t home when Steve arrives, so Steve feels free to gape at how the space has changed from the last time he was there. Gone is the dark wood, now replaced by steel and glass. It’s like nothing happened. That’s the nature of the world nowadays, Steve has noticed.
Tony huffs, mock-shocked. “No ‘happy anniversary, Tony’? No declarations of love?” He shifts as if to leave the bed, but Steve is awake enough to grab his hip and haul him close.
Tony turns Steve to face him. “Good,” he says, and tugs on Steve’s hand, leading them out of the plaza.
Steve wakes up with a jolt. He sits up slowly, listening for what could’ve woken him up, but he already has a feeling—someone’s in his apartment. He’s immediately alert and sets aside the irritation of being woken up from a pleasant dream. He’s been having more of those, recently, and while they were mostly pleasurable, Steve still felt a little confused by the dreams--and the man who featured most prominently in them.
It takes Steve a moment to reorient himself, realize what Tony means by that. Steve bites his lip, but doesn’t say that he’s never wanted to rely on anyone, that he can get by on his own. Even that truth, however glaring it seems to Tony, is something Steve isn’t ready to say out loud.
“You can just go and do things. Or, well, that’s how it seems, to me. To everyone else, too. You can just do things and not care about what people think, what people expect. I can’t
Nick is sitting in front of the camera, reviewing the boards. Tony shucks off his robe and drapes himself over the bed, clad only in his briefs.
“I didn’t say you were.” Steve sits up beside him, rests his hand on Tony’s shoulder, and turns Tony to look at him. “Who said you were being difficult?”
The team is silent on the quinjet. Clint and Natasha are piloting up front, Thor and Bruce standing by them and watching the clouds fly by. No one was hurt—they had stormed in so quickly and the agents were all mostly still just waking up, or winding down from the night shift.
Tony settles his hands on Steve’s hips, then hooks his foot around Steve’s pushing it forward. “Okay, so you kinda just—” Tony pushes against Steve’s left hip, and pulls at the right. Steve follows the pressure, and feels a bit hot around his collar, his body alight with the casual intimacy.
Steve remembers furrowing his brow, hugging one of the oversized pillows to his chest in an act of defiance and saying, “You are the most opulent man I have ever met.”
Steve pauses again, notices his hands are shaking. “But I wish I didn’t have to find out after all these years that it wasn’t worth anything, after all. The wars never stopped, HYDRA never stopped, and what nearly broke me turns out to have been a farce.” Steve sighs, rubs the back of his neck. “He’s alive, somewhere, without me. He didn’t even remember me. And I can’t even find him to help him.”
“Oh? Too good for that?” Tony says sharply. “Too good to lie or be a fuck up like the rest of us mere mortals?”
“Do you want anything to happen?” Tony asks, because even in his subconscious, he knows Tony won’t make it an easy conversation.
Tony shakes his head, a small smile on his lips. “How about we reserve story time for when you’ve fully recovered, huh?”
Steve’s train of thought is interrupted by Tony moving to stand in front of him, sleeveless shirt in hand. “Something tells me this won’t fit you,” Tony says, holding it up against Steve’s chest.
“It’s mine too, I just don’t know how to use a microwave!” Steve teases, raising his voice so Tony can hear him.
“Better for me to choke you with, for making me worry like that,” Steve says darkly as he continues to grope around the cavity in Tony’s chest. He tries not to dwell on that too much.
Steve reaches over Tony to pick up his tablet, and flicks it on to scan through the report. He turns to kiss Tony’s shoulder.
Steve sits down and sighs. He drinks from his own glass before answering. “You can just tell me if you don’t like me, I can take it,” he says. For a brief moment, he goes back to what was happening barely an hour ago—minutes ago, even. Strange, how life is.
He resolves that he’ll try and smooth things over with Tony tomorrow (once the buzz of confusion and stress in his brain has stopped), and it’ll all just go back to normal and Steve—Steve will just have no romantic feelings ever again.
“Way to set the mood, Cap,” Tony cuts him off easily, a grin on his lips that doesn’t meet his eyes.
This is a mantra he’s learned to chant to himself when the bile begins to rise up his throat, when he thinks of what Bucky would have done for him, has done for him. When he thinks of how he still hasn’t found him.
“Well, anything, really,” Tony says, and for the first time, he looks a little confused. It’s a new look, and Steve’s oddly charmed by it. “It’s not like we’re being recorded or anything.”
The move proves to be his undoing. In a flash, Stark pulls out a knife from behind him and pushes it against Steve’s neck, just beneath his Adam's apple. Steve’s hands fly up to his sides, his gun clattering to the floor.
Maria Hill organizes the interview. It’s almost three months since they’ve started this charade, and the last push for credibility is an interview—a tell-all, of sorts.
“What are you so worried about?” Tony asks, pushing himself up to look down at Steve. “I didn’t bring you here to like, kill you or something.”
Again: an infinite multiverse of answers to answer a question that simple. With this, Tony does struggle for a moment, and the next words are much harder to say—they almost feel caught in his throat, like a lump of meat. “I don’t know.”
“20 bucks says Tony breaks first,” Clint laughs, hands tucked behind his head as he leans back in his chair.
In his claw is an arc reactor, similar to the one Steve’s seen up close before, and looking much cleaner than what Steve had seen earlier.
Steve wakes up to Tony’s warm body still curled around him and Steve smiles so widely, his cheeks ache. He shifts a bit, noticing a crick beginning to form on his shoulder, and the movement wakes Tony up.
Once a few moments have passed and Clint is sure Tony’s out of earshot, he turns to Steve with a raised brow.
“Don’t touch me,” Steve grinds out, his whole body feels both on fire and trapped in ice all at once.
Tony closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, as if offended. Steve, at this point, is used to the reaction.
Steve wakes up from a dream and shivers at the cold; his shirt clings to his back, wet with his sweat. The dream is already fading quickly from his mind, but it’s become familiar now. Him and Tony on the balcony, New York sparkling around them, his lips against Tony’s. In his dreams, it always goes better. They kiss, and then they smile, and then sometimes (and Steve likes these dreams best) they tell each other how it’s been a long time coming, and that they love each other.
“I—I read your note,” Steve adds, hesitant even if he’s the one who wanted to come here, wanted to talk in the first place.
He thought that he’d reigned it in, that the attraction to Steve was a passing fancy in something new, as it almost always inevitably was. But a week ago, Steve had shouted his name across the soundstage and kissed his cheek and Tony felt weak—still feels weak as he remembers it, the soft press of lips against his skin and he wants nothing more than to trawl through the company directory and find Steve’s phone number, call him up, make Steve blush again.
“What?” Steve asks, setting the towel down and sitting beside Tony. He takes Tony’s hand in his and kisses his knuckles.
“Let’s just talk in the morning,” Tony says, almost at the door of the lab now. He hasn’t turned to look at Steve at all.
Tony blinks, and only then does Steve realize that while he’d been looking—Tony had been looking, too.
. Steve remembers Clint saying the same, but Steve knows his body is in desperate need for electrolytes, so he downs it in one go. It tastes sweet-ish, with an undertone of acidity, but he drinks it too quickly for him to really care about it.
Steve had slipped it off and given it to Tony, and after a token protest, Tony had put it on. He’ll never forget how brightly Steve smiled at him then—not that he ever wanted to.
But that would have been too easy. Instead, he’s here, sitting in an ornate chair in a well-stocked library, miles above the rest of the city, and he’s thinking about the one friend he had in the world who he’d let down so severely.
So Steve takes Tony’s hand and pulls himself up. Around them, the rest of the team is shimmying their hips. Steve notices that Thor seems to have taken to the movement quickly, and he feels a flash of jealousy; but Thor was a god, after all, of course he’d quickly learn how to dance.
Steve obliges, pushing against the wall, meaning to walk to the bedroom and resume there, but Tony isn’t having it. He kisses Steve, his hands firmly on Steve’s waist, holding him against him.
“I just didn’t tell you,” Tony leans in to whisper conspiratorially, as if it isn’t just the two of them in the room. “Didn’t want to embarrass you,” he adds.
Steve blinks. He can’t look away, can’t draw attention to himself. But he can’t do anything else, either. No one’s said that to him before, and the full force hits Steve like a punch to the gut. He wants to say it back, because he means it. The realization makes him want to bolt out of the room.
“There’s a theory that locking eyes for this long makes you fall in love—this time, we hope you’ll fall in love again with one another,” Janet says, walking around the room as everyone shifts in their seats. It’s comforting, seeing that all the other couples aren’t too keen on this activity.
There are two bags attached to his IV, and wires coming out from under his chest that are attached to a big machine that beeps periodically. The rest of the room is sparse and the TV is an old one, the muted newscast coming out grainy. Outside, through the blinds, doctors and nurses putter about in the hallway. So: a civilian hospital.
Somewhere near him, Tony was reading a book and smoking. He could smell the cigarette smoke, mixed with the salt in the air.
Tony tries harder, now: smiles more, eats with gusto. He knocks Steve’s thigh with his knee, looks up at him from under his lashes. This is what life is like for Tony Stark: it’s acting. He knows the approximations to get his point across. As their evening goes on, the small wrinkle on Steve’s forehead smooths out, and maybe Tony wishes he wasn’t so good at pretending.
Tony lets out a string of curses in Spanish, and Steve groans against Tony’s neck, feeling himself getting hard.
It’s been years since Steve has felt this aware of his body, the size of it and the way he takes up space, and the way Tony, somehow, always finds space beside him.
“Okay, okay,” Tony says, sounding annoyed. But Steve’s looking directly at Tony, and that’s the only reason he sees the small upwards curl of Tony’s lips, so Steve smiles back at him before he begins chopping.
Steve’s head heats up just thinking about the conversation, of how clinical it was. But maybe that’s the best way to approach this current step.
Only Tony’s awake (of course it’s Tony, Steve thinks, shaking his head at Tony’s sheer disregard for his health, and at that, Steve realizes the irony of the sentiment), so Steve takes the elevator down to the workshop and spends around a minute staring through the glass walls.
Of course, these thoughts are all isolated to the moments before Steve descended upon the captain of the base.
“Of course,” JARVIS intones graciously, and Steve towels himself off, pressing his fingers to his sore eyes.
Tony ducks into his room and comes out with a bag, and Steve follows him outside. From the door, it’s only a few steps to the beach, and already under the shade of a botong tree is a cooler. Steve figures Jojo would have put it out. He thinks that Jojo already knows what Tony wants by now.
Steve follows and pours each of them a glass of water. “Okay,” he says, drinking it down in one go. He hands the full glass to Tony, who takes a sip as he undoes his tie; Steve tries not to stare.
“Yeah,” Steve nods. He almost asks the man to sit, but remembers that he works here. “Thanks for the directions.”
Tony’s helmet is on the ground, right beside Steve’s. She picks them up as she walks toward them, watching the way Tony
begins. Tony leaves for a moment to get the pizza, and settles own on the floor in front of Steve, leaning against Steve’s shins. Natasha takes a slice and snuggles closer to Steve, sandwiched between him and Bruce.
Tony sits down on the bed, still holding the hoodie. He was wearing it that day that Steve had upended everything.
There’s a photo of the exact moment, and the ones that follow. Steve tries not to feel too mortified when he sees it in the tabloids: Steve had ducked his chin down, mumbled thanks, and tried to fight down a blush. Evidently, he’d failed. A stray thought floated into his mind as he studied the photos.
Tony nods, touches a finger to Steve’s jaw, and leans up to press a kiss to his lips. Steve startles, but doesn’t move away.
, has awoken the desperate need he thought he’d quenched. He wants to touch Tony, would settle with just touching his wrist, really, which is absurd; he’s touched more of Tony before, and has a video to prove it.
There are some days when Steve remembers Punta Fuego. He imagines lying down on a beach towel, half-asleep as the waves lap against the sand. The afternoon sun is warm against his skin, and his fingers are still sticky from when he’d unpeeled a mango and eaten it with his hands. Tony had laughed, reached over and wiped the juice off his chin. The palm leaves sway and shift with the wind.
“Okay,” Steve says, turning away from Tony to check the time on the clock. He sees the movement of Tony’s hands in his periphery, and feels inexplicably irritated by it. He reaches over to still the motion. “Don’t,” he says. So Tony doesn’t.
“Bed,” Tony’s lips brush against his as he speaks, and it keeps sending sparks straight down to Steve’s belly.
Sure, they’d all been working together and living together, but there was only so much anyone could do to address all the trust issues that had calcified through the years. At least, that’s what Sam had observed and told Steve; Steve was inclined to agree, but wouldn’t ever say it out loud.
“Steve,” I whispered, struggling slightly against his hold. I wanted to touch him the way he was touching me.
Sometimes, Steve plays back everything that happened, the truth of it. How he never got to say what he wanted to out loud. But in those dreams Steve doesn’t lose sight of Tony. Then, in those dreams, he lifts up the face plate and says, “I got you,” and Tony smiles and says, “that you do, soldier.”
Tony looks down at the book, taking it gingerly in his hands before looking back up at Steve. “You remembered,” he says, sounding shocked. “I mean, thanks. Wow. You remembered?”
The interview goes well; they’d reviewed their notes prior, and Maria had sent them a packet with all the key phrases they needed to say to ensure maximum believability. All in all, it’s a cakewalk. Tony would be loath to admit it, Steve knows, but Fury was right to have them start on this early, to really build it up.
Steve laughs, raises Tony's hands to his lips. He turns Tony's hand over and presses a soft kiss to the inside of his wrist. He keeps his lips there for a second, and can't tell if the heartbeat he feels is Tony's or his own.
Steve feels pliant and loose, doesn’t really give a shit about anything so small as a cuddle, if that’s what Tony needs then, okay, okay.
I don’t know how it happened, I mean, I do—we were on his couch watching a stand up comedian or something then we just sat closer together until I was leaning against his chest.
“I’m glad you’re alive, Tony,” Steve whispers, looking back at the reactor in Tony’s chest. He reaches up and brushes his fingers against it, because he’s probably allowed to, since he helped put it in and everything—
Tony scrunches up his face and walks back to the kitchen, dragging his feet. Steve follows, smiling all the while.
“Yes,” Steve says, fondness creeping into his tone as he presses another kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Yes.”
Clint, who hadn’t moved at all from where he was napping, simply settles back in, fluffs up a jacket he was using as a pillow, and drops off.
Tony looks up from his phone, doing his best impression to look disinterested. “Pepper didn’t leave me much choice,” he says, which isn’t actually a lie. Pepper had pulled the best friend card and offered to pay for lunch, and Tony had only agreed when she had promised to stand up and protect him from his ex, whose art was being displayed.
Steve tries not to stare at Tony as he emerges from the bathroom, freshly bathed and wearing pajamas that sling low on his hips.
It was a few dates later—a science fair that Stark Industries had sponsored—when Steve had taken a deep breath and clasped Tony’s hand in his. Previously, he’d never understood the appeal, but the smile Tony had on his face made it all make sense. Steve smiled back, tucked Tony’s hand into the crook of his elbow, and felt something funny, like this would be the perfect time to lean down and kiss Tony—but that wasn’t in the plan. There’s a photo of them, grainy from a phone camera, smiling at each other like they weren’t surrounded by sweaty teenagers. “I think we broke the internet,” Tony said gleefully, showing Steve the photo on his phone. Steve smiled at Tony, and felt that funny feeling again, and they were totally alone, so he didn’t pay it any mind.
Now it’s Steve’s turn to roll his eyes. Steve sets down his tablet and walks up to the two of them, surprising Tony has he claps him on the back. “Come on,” Steve says.
He hands Steve a piece of paper, and when Steve glances down at it, he sees a printed ticket and an itinerary.
At one point during the interview, Tony rests his hand on Steve’s knee. Steve immediately responds by taking Tony’s hand in his, and Tony turns to him, a small smile on his face.
Tony smiles, scoots closer. “Impossibly,” he whispers, just as he rests his hand on Steve’s jaw and pulls him in for another kiss.
you,” Steve says, hugging Tony closer to him. He looks up at Tony, resting his chin right on Tony’s sternum. “Was that our first fight?”
Steve remembers when he’d been so easily awed, when the reality of life had seemed far away, and then there were aliens and
Of course, it makes sense; what else was all the foreplay for if not for them to finally feel comfortable touching each other like this? Really, they’re selling it so well that during one movie night, two months in, Clint looks annoyed when Steve drapes his arm over Tony’s shoulders.
Pepper blinks, still reeling from the introduction. “I told Tony that there was a new artist displaying his work,” she says. “And I guess… you’re him?”
Steve finds Tony later in the afternoon in his workshop. He knocks on the glass panel and holds up a cup of coffee. Tony grins at him and waves him in, and Steve hands over the coffee before taking the opportunity to once again appreciate Tony’s workshop.
“Yes,” the man says, straightening up in his seat. “Thank you for making the time, Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers. We know it’s very precious.”
I followed without comment, encircling Steve’s waist with my arm and resting my hand just shy of Steve’s stomach. We’d stood like this before, triumphant and rejoicing over a battle well-fought and won. Or other times, in private, too, fulfilling some base desire for human contact and trusting the other to provide it. But that was simplifying the issue; I wanted to be close to him. I wanted to get closer, always, and I’d take any chance I could get.
I took a second to fully come back to myself; I’d almost kissed him. I’d moved to kiss him and he’d moved away.
Steve wants to object to that—how could Tony know? But then again, it proves that it really is quite obvious then, so. “Fine,” he says, as he takes the papers that Tony brought along with him.
Who was I to say no? Kindness was always few and far between. Then again, I knew I was fooling myself; I wanted to be alone with him. It thrilled me that he’d wanted the same.
Under the starlight, everything looks subdued and light, except for Tony’s eyes. The wind picks up and ruffles his hair. The waves crash against the shore, bearing witness as Steve kisses Tony.
Tony pushes himself up to sit properly on the chair. “Shit. Steve,” he reaches over the table to wrap a hand around Steve’s wrist.
Two days later, Tony settles on having to review related literature. In this case, this means sitting alone in the workshop as he relives every moment when Steve was distracted. Was that a sign? In a brief moment of clarity, Tony asks: “Fri, am I crazy?”
He knows that standing outside on the balcony, even if at this point the team left him alone when he was out here, meant the possibility of seeing Tony, of having Tony come up to him, of having Tony start the conversation.
So like always, I silently savored how nice it felt, the solid warmth of Steve lined up against my side. I could smell his cologne, and I knew that if I looked up I’d see the faint shadow of stubble on his jaw.
This is despite the fear that I was making it all up in my head, inventing intention where there was none. After all the romantic failures in my life, it seemed safer to accept that I couldn’t read Steve, even if it was
The next shot has Steve lying on the bed, only wearing his briefs. He rolls onto his stomach and looks at the camera from under his lashes. “I’m really excited to work with him again, I’ve always found his style really… sexy.”
“Okay boys, all bets are in,” Natasha says, finishing up her scribbling on a piece of paper with a flourish.
What is new is the body draped over him. Steve tries not to stiffen or shift, instead looking down a little to see Tony’s head tucked under his chin, arm across Steve’s chest. He’s snoring lightly.
At least he has a nice memory to tie to this place, on top of everything else. It’s as good a souvenir as any.
Tony shrugs in response, and goes back to eating his food. Steve has lost his appetite. Natasha, as if noticing this, leans over and uses Steve’s half-eaten toast to sop up the runny yolks on his plate.
I looked at him, then looked away. I couldn’t stomach it. With one look at him my fears were confirmed. Something was wrong, and I was on the losing end.
Steve laughs and slides his hands up Tony’s back, hitching his shirt up. “You earned that right a long while back,” he says, lifting Tony’s shirt off him.
Steve flinches at the hurt in Tony’s voice, and he turns to look at Tony as a series of responses form on his lips:
“He has literally kept himself in the shadows for decades, man,” Sam says, from the kitchen. “If It were easy then I don’t think he’d be such a good assassin, you know?”
“Tell me what you want, Steve,” Tony says, and his hand goes up to his chest, a familiar motion, except he’s rubbing at what isn’t there.
Tony lies back down on the bed, and Steve rearranges himself, props his knee on the bed, turns to Tony half-way, so that his body is still on full display for the camera.
“I know,” Tony says, and this is him lying through his teeth, and this is what he’s good at, and maybe this is why he’ll never know how relationships are. It’s a trust issue, probably. He doesn’t know if the issue is with Steve, or with himself. “Don’t worry about it.”
Steve had thought, months ago, when Tony had looked at Steve confusedly as Steve piled the large pillows onto the couch and said, “What are you doing? Those are for the floor.”
Rhodey tips his head back and stares at the ceiling, and he’s about to fall asleep when he hears Tony whisper, “I don’t trust myself around him.”
His fingers catch on something, and he pulls it out with a sigh of relief—only to yelp and drop the shirt when he sees it.
Steve leans down and kisses him, tightening his grip around Tony’s waist as if to prove a point. “Of course,” he says as he pulls away. “Aren’t you?”
After the first HYDRA cell he and Tony had broken into, Steve had, in Tony’s words, “Gone fucking HAM.” So they’d decided to call in the rest of the team for the next one. And now, they’re not just looking for Bucky, but for the tesseract, too.
“But I don’t think it would be good for us to, you know.” Tony makes a movement with his hands, as if not knowing what words to use. “Not like this.”
Tony kicks off his shoes when they get to Steve’s apartment—he’s used to house rules by now, and plops down on Steve’s sofa as Steve bends down to unlace his shoes. Steve is setting them aside properly in their assigned space on the rack when Tony makes a small, pleased sound. Steve looks up to see him holding up a small ziplock bag.
I felt very brave, moving my hand from his waist to rest against his chest. I could feel his heart beating under my palm.
“What—wait. What is happening,” Steve says, realization dawning on him. Fear drops like a stone in his belly. “I—Tony, wait.”
Tony’s hand flies to his chest as he gets vertical, and Steve remembers with a jolt that he’d nearly crushed the reactor in his hands three days ago. He looks down and sees a faint, circular outline through Tony’s shirt. “Tony—” he says, leaning Tony against his chest as he lifts up Tony’s shirt to check.
Steve distinctly hates this feeling. The need to remember, pick up the small fragments of lucidity from the night before. He was drinking alone in his apartment, and he remembers stumbling into the elevator, laughing at the absurdity that he was talking to a robot in the ceiling, and that robot was going to bring him down to Tony.
Steve makes his way to his small kitchenette, sets out a pan, some eggs, and pulls meatloaf out of the cupboard. His brain continues to throb as he waits for the pan to heat up and for the oil to sizzle, and when he cracks open the egg to fry, he runs to the toilet, dry heaving from the smell.
“Yup,” he says. He doesn’t turn to face Tony. He’s not even doing anything, just holding his bag over the dresser drawers, and Tony is silent.
Tony had balked at his taste, laughed and made him a playlist. Steve had tried to listen, but it was too loud. “You really are an old man,” Tony said, laughing as Steve tried to explain his distaste.
“They started hedging bets,” Natasha supplies, eyes on the screen. “You were getting along too well.”
“Ah, Steve,” Tony says, lifting goggles up and off his face before turning to smile at him. “C’mere.”
From up there, you could see the sunrise peeking through the buildings. We stood beside each other, almost a foot apart. I hated that I wanted to get closer, despite it all.
After lunch, Tony shows them his room, which is right across Tony’s. Steve wants to ask why they don’t just share, but feels that it might be improper. Still, Steve ends up in Tony’s room after lunch, and watches as Tony grinds up some weed.
Steve nods back, and finds himself incapable of saying anything else. Tony’s beautiful in the afternoon light, lips pink from whatever activities they’d gotten him to do earlier, eyes bright from release. Steve drinks it all in, feels suddenly like a man in a desert who has found oasis.
“Okay,” Steve says. It doesn’t make sense, why is Natasha acting like he’s more worried than her? They’re all worried. He’s fine, actually,
Steve gives him a small wave as he leaves, a tiny part of him reveling in the pain that registers at the movement.
“It is four in the morning.” As if sensing Steve’s next question, JARVIS adds, “Sir is currently in the workshop.”
“Don’t do that again,” Tony says, cutting in to Steve’s thoughts as he leans back into his seat. Tony’s hand rises to his chest to rub at it.
“How could I think otherwise?” Steve asks, burying his face into the crook between Tony’s neck and shoulder, afraid that the moment will end, afraid that this is all a dream.
Suddenly, everything snaps back into place. Steve clenches his hands into fists, then takes a deep breath to recenter. “Come in,” he says.
I didn’t want to break first, except we’d still catch each other at odd hours in the mansion, but neither of us would stay, already deviating from our standard patterns and signaling that something had changed.
“Yeah,” Steve says, coloring slightly. Clint only notices because he’s watching them closely. “I remembered you had a big meeting today and figured you’d need a pick me up.”
Once Jan is done with him, Steve takes off his own robe. He folds it up, hangs it over his chair, and moves to stand beside Tony.
“I never want to lose you,” Steve admits, finally. He takes another steadying breath, then cups Tony’s jaw with his other hand.
“Thank you, Thor,” Steve says self-consciously, noticing how no one’s actually verbally expressed their gratitude. “This is a great gift.”
Steve bites his lip, turns back to look at Peter. “What can I say,” he says, honest for the first time in months. “He’s right.”
Steve shakes his head softly, and pulls Tony back, worried that at any moment Tony would scamper away and take his laptop with him. “You need to say no to people, Tony.”
“I don’t know,” Steve starts. Takes another deep breath, laughs at how nervous he feels as he continues to search within himself, to find the latch he’d hidden away so expertly.
at Steve, but Jan tugs on his hair and makes him straighten back up. “Good. Excited about today,” he says, knowing he sounds nonchalant in spite of how he feels.
Tony’s frown shifts to a small smile of understanding. It’s heartening. Steve thinks it’s a good start.
“Did you seriously think I didn’t—?” Tony asks, drawing back. Steve reaches out for him instinctively, pulls him close into a hug.
Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist once more. “You’re here. I’m here. I love you.” He leans up, brushes their lips together. “Is that enough?”
“Oh, are you? I thought everyone did everything you wanted around here,” Steve says, annoyed by how calm Tony looks.
On Steve’s right, Thor had moved around and eventually found (and eaten) most of the spilled popcorn. Now, his toes were tucked snugly under Steve’s legs, seeking warmth.
I’m not exaggerating when I say this was the most intimate I’d been with someone, despite us being fully clothed.
As if hearing this realization, Tony sighs and stands up. “Well. This has been unpleasant,” he says, his voice light, as if he were joking.
“I know, I know,” Tony says harshly. He pushes himself off Steve’s chest and looks up at him. “But I know that I can, too.”
“Currently Dr. Banner is in India, Agent Romanoff in Washington, Thor remains off-world, and Agent Barton has requested that his location not be disclosed unless completely necessary. Sir should be arriving shortly.”
Today he feels a little kinder than usual, so he adjusts Tony’s head on the pillow, and leaves a glass of water beside him.
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “Good one,” he says, leaning back onto the chair. He drums his fingers on the table, and Steve inexplicably misses the warmth of Tony’s hand.
Tony’s unpacking the take out in the kitchen when Steve gets there. Steve wordlessly joins him, removing covers off the tupperwares full of dim sum and setting them down on the counter.
“Anyway that’s not the point. Obviously it’s not about truth.” Tony stops himself, and Steve cocks it head at how self-conscious Tony looks.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says, and there’s a little tremor to his voice now, but Steve hopes he’s gotten far enough from Tony for him not to have heard it.
“I—” he starts, wishing he had more time, that he’d thought about this sooner. “I wanted to talk to you.”
” Tony moans, holding a hand to his chest. “This is. This is, this is,” he says, eyes closed in pleasure. “This is
He meant to go see the Casa de las Conchas—a large, Gothic building with seashells dotting along its facade. It also housed a public library.
“Okay,” Steve says. His brain has woken up fully from his stupor, but he doesn’t know what else to say. Only now does he realize he’d been following after Tony, and he notices how close they are. Tony’s eyes are red-rimmed from a lack of sleep, his hair a bit flatter on the side he’d been on, leaning against Steve’s shoulder.
“Stay awake, I got you,” Tony says, and Steve is looking up at him, probably too exhausted to speak, but his eyes are open. There’s a bit of blood on the side of Steve’s mouth, and Natasha only notices it because she was wondering why Steve was
“Nothing,” Steve says, and then, feeling like he has to make up for his silence, he lifts Tony’s hand to his lips and kisses Tony’s knuckles.
They don’t talk anymore about Steve after that, instead recount the shenanigans they’d gotten into the night before. Rhodey leaves after helping clean after lunch, and before Tony realizes it, he’s alone again.
“Hey man, if you really don’t want to go we won’t force you,” Rhodey says, gently pulling Tony back up. He gives Pepper a warning look over Tony’s head.
“I want you to know,” Steve says, pulling away just enough to get the words out. “That I mean it when I say I love you.”
“Do you want me to tell you what I want?” Tony asks, and he sounds shy, and Steve furrows his brow at Tony:
The interview with the counselors of the couples retreat goes the same; thankfully all their planning was worth it, and Steve answers the questions without second thought. Tony must have done the same, because now they’re standing outside a large wooden cabin along Lake Placid.
, in his hungover search for hydration. Second, that he and Tony were friends, now. They’d been friends for a while, really, stopped snapping at each other somewhere between HYDRA bases and cups of coffee on the balcony. Steve had stopped thinking of Tony as a flippant jerk who goaded him into arguments just for laughs, and instead saw Tony’s sarcasm as his own form of protection. They’d never agreed to stop fighting, never said anything about how they’d actually gotten along when they weren’t thinking about it.
Steve flips through the consolidated reports on Winter Soldier sightings again, checking to see if he’d missed anything. For two months now, all Steve had done was read and wait for updates. Slowly, the rest of the Avengers had found their way into the tower; still, only Steve and Tony remained permanent fixtures while everyone else filtered in and out.
“All those times, I kept thinking I was running to find Bucky. Turns out, I was running away, too.” Steve swallows, blanching at the words tumbling out of his mouth. “I was—I was running away from my own pain, running away from being vulnerable. And all those times, Tony, I kept running into you.”
Steve’s throat feels tight, and he chalks it up to the strange feeling of being caught. He slings the gun over his shoulder and runs down the stairs. His phone buzzes in his pocket, and by the time he gets to the ground floor, Stark’s car is zooming out of the compound. Steve swears and slams his fist into the doorframe in frustration.
Tony stares at him, confusion plain on his face. Steve realizes this for the victory that it is, to see Tony. Just Tony.
Tony nods again. “Well, you came to that much faster than I did,” he smirks, nudging Steve as he motions at the egg, the whites browning and crisp at the edges now. Steve moves to the dining table, and Tony brings along the toast, sitting across Steve.
They arrive just before noon, and Steve begins to sweat as soon as Tony kills the engine. Tony’s parents’ beach house is an expansive Spanish-style bungalow, all bleached white walls and wood. Before Tony, Steve had only ever seen things like this in magazines and Pinterest. The caretaker, Jojo, comes out to greet them and take their bags. From the front door, the house opens up with a view of the sea. It takes Steve’s breath away, the sight of the bright blue water glittering in the sunlight. Then he wonders how safe it is, to just have all the doors thrown open like this, but then realizes that this is a private beach.
Natasha sips her drink and pops another olive into her mouth. Yes, she was curious, but she knew better than to push; Tony was more hyper-verbal than usual tonight, and she always liked being people’s sounding board.
“Sounds like a shaky hypothesis,” Tony says, but his voice quivers a little as he says it. He can’t explain how he feels, other than warm in Steve’s embrace.
“I meant,” Steve says quickly, all his words bumping into each other in the air. “We’re okay, right?” Steve asks, then adds: “I mean, I shouldn’t have, you know. That. But I also just want us to be okay.”
Steve sits in his shower and cries quietly. He knows that he doesn’t have to be quiet—no one’s going to hear him from here. But still.
Steve tuts. “Step four, experimentation. Small gestures, date nights.” Steve rubs Tony’s back as he speaks, and stops to tilt Tony’s head up to face him. “Am I getting this right?”
“That’s not the point!” He pushes Steve’s hand off him and stands. “Why would you keep that a secret?”
Sam can always tell when something’s off. Not to discredit the rest of the team; they know too, after everything, it’s impossible not to know. But Sam, Sam’s just about as stubborn as Steve, and he won’t stop until Steve’s acknowledged that thinking and feeling about something for an hour isn’t enough to fully deal with the issue.
There’s something different about the new guy. Tony has said as much as soon as he’d laid eyes on him, blonde and blue eyed and impossibly shy, even as they made him strip so they could shave him and oil him up. Tony has told them all before, that he didn’t like working with inexperienced boys, boys who would freeze at his touch, worry clear in their eyes and even clearer on camera. But there’s no fear in the new guy’s eyes—quite the opposite. Something about him makes Tony jumpy, but he can’t explain why. So instead, he pesters everyone else until they can give them a satisfying answer.
Steve turned back to me sharply. There was a look in his eyes that I couldn’t decipher. But above it all I still couldn’t believe I’d almost kissed him, out here, the only witness to what had happened being the bright lights from the condominiums in the building across us.
“I don’t understand where you’re going with this,” Steve admits, and realizes that he’s instinctively taken a more guarded stance, arms crossed over his chest. He puts them down and rests his hands against the workbench.
Tony rolls his eyes and groans before burying his face in his hands. “Exist,” he says, voice muffled by his palms.
“Anyway,” Steve says, and begins relaxing and tightening his grip around his sketchbook as he grapples with this newfound knowledge, about how deeply he feels after all, and still—he came down to check in with Tony, to make sure they’re really okay, that Tony isn’t pretending.
“It used to happen before,” Steve says, and there’s enough truth in that statement to do the trick. No one needs to know how often, or why, or who taught him how to deal with these attacks.
The air felt thick. I didn’t move, and Steve didn’t either. For a few moments, all we did was breathe, knowing full well how close we were, close enough for one of us to finally make a move.
Steve wakes up very, very slowly. His legs are splayed out in front of him. His eyelids are heavy. Beside him, a weight. Dark hair, scuffed loafers.
“Fine.” Bruce tries not to eavesdrop, but can’t seem to focus—he’s read the same sentence thrice now.
The line goes dead, and Steve slumps against the wall, the adrenaline seeping out of him. He sighs and types out a message.
“Don’t fucking use your de-escalation tactics on me.” Tony hisses, turns on his heel, and walks out the door. He gives himself the satisfaction of slamming it shut.
“Do you know how much self control it took me not to take a video of you singing ‘Oklahoma’? Let me tell you, Steve. I should get an award for my self control.”
Steve decides not to respond--he doesn’t want Stark to think he can just banter with him. After all, Steve still has to fulfill the contract.
“Come on, Steve,” Tony says, curling his fingers towards his palm, inviting. “Since when have I taken no for an answer?”
“See! God, if anyone could see this right now.” Tony sighs dramatically, but it’s undercut by the gasp Steve elicits by sliding a hand under Tony’s shirt. “Captain America plays dirty!” he crows.
“Steve?” Tony rests his palm on top of Steve’s. Very faintly, he can feel Tony’s heartbeat under his palm.
The man turns to look at him and Steve is almost bowled over by how gorgeous he is; he tries his best not to stare, but it’s nearly impossible. His face is framed by a well-trimmed moustache and goatee, and his gaze is somehow arresting—he’d never thought that description made sense until this moment.
The kiss starts off chaste, and then Steve finally remembers his hands, which he moves to rest on Tony’s hips, unsure whether to push or pull.
“But it is,” Steve adds, quietly, wrenched open and completely unravelled. He couldn’t stop himself from talking even if he wanted to, and he doesn’t want to, admissions continuing to tumble from his lips. “I didn’t try hard enough to find him, after he fell, and even now—I just, I didn’t do enough, Tony. I could’ve done more,” Steve closes his eyes and breathes deeply through his nose, trying to calm himself.
“Is there anyone else in the tower?” Steve asks. “Or, uh, would you know when Tony’ll be here?” He adds.
Steve scrambles, takes the new reactor from Dum-E. “Now very carefully, just—reach in with that wire and click it into place.”
“New York,” Tony says, tilting his head a little as he regards Steve. “How’d you get out of the water?”
We’d ordered Chinese and watched a rerun of Golden Girls, and now they were just passing time. (As always been a waiting game.)
“All good?” Natasha asks, turning to check on all of them. Tony cracks his neck, then his knuckles. “Let’s rock and roll,” he says, and fires up the engine. “J, spell it out for us.”
Thankfully, the man comes back, easy smile on his lips as he sets down plates of food. “Did you like the beer?” He asks, and Steve nods, and doesn’t look at the man any longer. He tries to subdue the desire stirring in his gut. He doesn’t want to be so weird about it, but
“Getting ordered about in my own home!” Tony says mock-indignantly as he snatches the bowl from the table and strides toward the kitchen.
“Tony, you—you have to know how I feel about you,” Steve says, and he didn’t plan on ever saying these words out loud, but he feels like he has to, now. “I—I really like you. And not just. Not just like I’d die for you,” Steve’s mouth continues to push out words, nonsense words, spurred by the fear of what Tony will say.
“Continue,” Steve says placidly, rubbing circles on Tony’s back. It feels so new, to be able to touch him like this.
Clint is dozing against one of the walls of the quinjet when they arrive. Natasha and Tony soon follow, and make their way wordlessly towards the cockpit, Tony maneuvering around equipment while drinking from a metal tumbler.
“Absolutely not. If it were up to me that would happen even more,” Tony laughs, slinging an arm around Steve’s shoulders and pulling him close. “Seriously, feel free to bother me any time.”
Steve nods, then startles a little when Tony reaches down and rubs his fingers over Steve’s knuckles. “Just, you know. Talk. To me, or to Sam, or whoever. JARVIS, even. He’s great, kinda used to all the—” Tony makes a vague, fluttery motion with his other hand.
“Hey, come on.” Someone is tugging his sleeve so Steve opens his eyes a bit, if only to inspect. “Wha?” he mumbles.
.” There’s a bit of panic now in Tony’s voice, a different panic from the one that has curled around Steve’s throat.
Steve sighs. By all accounts, this isn’t the worst thing he’s had to do for an op. Pretending to be in a relationship isn’t exactly rocket science, but the idea of having to pretend with
“So we’re really doing this, huh,” he says as he dribbles ketchup onto his egg. Steve watches him and makes a face, which Tony catches and rolls his eyes in response.
But Tony knows him now, and knows he’s won. He laughs and presses a kiss against Steve’s cheek, and it’s in moments like this that Steve wonders how someone who has been through so much can still be so easy with his affection.
Like a flash of lightning, his gaze locks on the man’s. He looks just as gorgeous as Steve remembers (and he has been remembering a
“Don’t do this to yourself.” Tony looks serious. Steve can count how many times he’s seen that look on Tony’s face, and it makes him uneasy to see it turned on him.
Steve wakes up with a jolt, surprised at himself for having fallen asleep. The last thing he remembers is staring at his ceiling, mulling over Tony’s letter. Was it all a dream? The library, the panic attack, the knock on his door. He finds his sketchbook on the bed beside him and flips it open, carding through the pages, wincing as he catches glances of his rough sketches of Tony, until he finds Tony’s letter.
“I hate being alive,” he says, slumping over the coffee machine and mournfully pressing buttons to make himself a drink.
Tony huffs as he sits on one of the cots. “I really don’t—” Steve shushes him and gently pushes him down onto the cot, hand firm against Tony’s chest.
Tony stares at Steve, looking small as he rests on the balls of his feet, hands on his lap and still kneeling in front of Steve.
Clint’s halfway through his cereal when Tony walks in, suit jacket in hand. His sleeves are rolled up and his tie loose around his neck. He takes one look at Clint and sighs dramatically.
Fully committed to giving up on the rest of the day, Steve picks up his things and drops them haphazardly on the bed. He goes back to staring at the ceiling, continuing from where he’d stopped counting.
Steve rests his hands on his hips as he stands in front of his closet, looking at his options. Something casual? Something… not casual?
Pepper sets her cup aside and wedges herself beside Tony. “I’m sorry,” she says, hugging Tony and kissing his cheek. “I was just curious.”
Tony laughs, and Steve joins him. After that, settling into bed beside each other doesn’t seem so daunting.
“I guess after almost a year of looking, of me just—you know. I know now that it won’t fix everything. I’m not even sure it will fix
“If I have the time,” Tony repeats to himself, sounding disbelieving. “Steve.” He steps in front of Steve, forcing him to meet Tony’s gaze. “I have all the time in the world for you.”
Through the static noise of his thoughts, Steve notices that he’s never heard Tony speak so haltingly. He reaches over and takes Tony’s hand, caring for him coming as second nature at this point. “You don’t have to be sorry. I don’t know if I would have told you, either, if I was in your place.”
Clearly, I’m a simpleton, easily wiled. But then again, it’s not as if Steve meant for this, I cannot imagine him to be the type to have
HYDRA base after HYDRA base, and nothing about Bucky. Steve has a map in his bedside drawer, defeated cells marked in red. There’s no pattern, no path. All this technology, facial recognition, tracking, police report monitoring, and somehow: still nothing.
Steve grins. “Yeah, I know.” As he continues cooking, he can hear the tell-tale signs of Tony resuming work—whichever aspect of work that may be. Steve knows he’s helping with Stark Industries already, developing designs for his dad. But he knows too that Tony’s helping out with more than a few school organizations; from what he remembers, he’d offered to help automate student council elections, set up the website of the Herald, and was helping some mechanical engineering freshmen with their projects as a favor to one of their professors. On top of that, he managed to volunteer time for the advocacy groups, too—donating money and setting up partnerships.
Steve runs around Central Park an indeterminate amount of times, comes back to the tower and bumps into Tony, who’s sipping a cup of coffee, scrolling through his phone, and waiting for the elevator.
, so normal after all the kisses they’d shared in the tower, that Steve doesn’t even register the noise from the reporters.
Natasha takes a sip of her drink. “Okay.” Of course, Pepper had already filled her in over what had happened, but Natasha respected Tony’s boundaries and didn’t want to pry—it was unbecoming.
Steve falls into the strange focus afforded by creativity, so he doesn’t register JARVIS’ low cough. Instead, Steve’s hand stills over the page when he hears the doorknob turn, the door open.
It’s as if no time has passed between them. Steve touches him confidently, his hand gripping Tony’s waist hard enough to make Tony gasp. His lips against Tony are sure, and soft, and just as pliant as when Tony had kissed him, all those months ago. It feels infinitely better than Tony had imagined, in all those months in between, and he doesn’t bother hiding how pleased it makes him, moans into Steve’s mouth even if there was no direction to do so.
“Do you want to give it a shot?” Steve asks, barely able to believe that he’s said those words out loud by the time they’re out of his mouth.
“Anyway,” Steve says again. “I just wanted to check up on, on…” Steve falters, realizes how strange it will sound if he says “you,” so instead, he opts to say: “Us.”
It’s an odd angle, and eventually Steve shifts to lift Tony up onto his lap. “Ass,” Tony says. “You know what I meant.”
We kissed again, messy and desperate, almost knocking into each other in our haste to get undressed properly. In the back of my mind, hysteria was simmering—I kept thinking, this is happening, he’s kissing me, his tongue is in my mouth—
“Oh, Cap, no. We can get take out. Where did you even find these—” he holds up a mushroom and looks at it dubiously.
, his mind is going strange places—he imagines touching the man’s wrist, asking his name, laughing and chatting with him until the attraction boils over and drives them to act. He imagines kissing him against the wall in one of the side streets leading out of the plaza. He imagines the sounds the man would make, how Steve would ruck up his shirt. He feels his cheeks heat, and feels a little like a deviant.
He doesn’t expect Tony to offer him a place in Stark Tower, but he recalibrates and accepts pretty quickly; besides, New York was always home, anyway. Steve didn’t think Tony took their conversation at the hospital too seriously, but Tony’s text reads:
After a few listens to the playlist, Steve decides he likes 70s music. Steve closes his eyes and listens to Simon & Garfukel, knowing full well that if anyone from the team walked in on him right now, they’d say he was the perfect caricature of an old man.
“You can go put on some sunblock if you’re so intent on activity,” Tony says, laughing as he rolls his eyes. “Honestly, chill.”
Stark tilts his head and assesses Steve. “Of all the goons Obidiah’s sent after me, you’re certainly the stupidest.”
They kiss languidly for a while, hands sliding up each other’s sides, each other’s arms, exploring. Steve takes his cues from Tony—despite the heady rush of want, he’s somehow still afraid that if he moves too quickly, Tony’ll run away again.
He assessed me, for a moment. “Sure,” he said blandly, as if he hadn’t held me down and fucked me ‘til I screamed his name.
Steve hides a smile by taking a sip of his coffee, but presses his leg against Tony’s, enjoying the warmth. Their fight earlier seems far away, now, and Steve doesn’t want to bring it up, content to just let those words stay in the workshop, where they can get sorted and filed away, like all other data down there.
“Tower first,” Tony croaks out, when they finally get into the quinjet. “Reactor,” he explains, before passing out.
“What happened?” Steve asks. Part of him just wants to ask JARVIS for the footage, to stew in the shame while alone in his room, but he also doesn’t want to leave while Tony’s visibly upset.
“Anyway—it was nice, seeing you opening up to everyone, settling in. I felt, well—I feel like I deserve some credit in that,” Tony says, raising a hand to card through Steve’s hair.
It’s been two days since I’d snuck out of Steve’s apartment, gathering my clothes and getting dressed in the living room before tiptoeing out. We didn’t speak, after, didn’t text or anything.
When they finally get to the door of Tony’s apartment, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist as Tony punches in his code. He smiles to himself as he peppers Tony’s nape with kisses, still in a mild state of disbelief that only a few days ago he’d chanced upon meeting Tony.
Again, Tony’s hand is on his jaw, turning Steve’s head to face his. “Steve,” Tony says, and ducks his head a little so he’s in Steve’s line of sight. Steve’s eyes meet his, and Tony offers up the smallest of smiles. “Hi,” Tony says, his voice soft.
There are two quick knocks on his door, and then Steve hears footsteps leading away. Steve opens the door and finds his pencils and sketchbook placed neatly on the floor. It registers somewhere in the back of his mind that Tony had picked all of these things up and brought it over, but he doesn’t care, doesn’t want to.
“Steve?” Tony says, sharper now, but Steve can barely hear Tony’s voice. The sides of his vision are beginning to darken. Tony grips Steve’s shoulder. “Hey.
“You always knew where to find me,” he says. His gaze stays on their hands, their fingers only loosely interlocked.
Tony turned to him and smiled. “Yeah, definitely.” He pushed himself up a little and kissed Steve, his heart feeling so full it could burst.
“If I do sleep then I’ll just feel even more tired when I wake up three hours from now,” Tony says, seriously making a case for sleeplessness.
“Any time. Really. Like you said, I… I know what it’s about.” Tony laughs a little again. “I mean, at least in some approximations.”
“Maybe next time,” I said, giving Steve a small smile and a wave before I turned away and walked to the door.
Nothing about that night was different. Another battle, another debrief, another blasé invitation to unwind. Always, against my better judgment, I’d agreed: what about tonight could be different? Nothing, nothing at all.
“All those times you said you’d be here—Tony, let me be here, too. With you.” Steve tips his forehead forward and rests it against Tony’s. Tony breathes out and closes his eyes.
Going to sleep that night is an awkward affair. For all their touching and pretend sweetness, they’ve never had to sleep beside each other.
Everything in Steve’s field of vision is bright: Tony’s hair, Tony’s eyes, Tony’s mouth. Tony’s looking at Steve with such intensity that Steve feels his cheeks flush, and with a sudden swell of courage Steve only usually feels during a fight, he leans in closer and seals the space between their lips. He twists his wrist away from Tony’s grip, sliding his hand up the expanse of Tony’s bare arm, squeezing at the muscles there.
Steve laughs, stopping his attack and resting his forehead against Tony’s chest. They’re quiet for a moment, and Tony strokes the back of Steve’s hair.
“I just don’t understand how we haven’t found him,” Steve says. Sam is puttering around the communal floor somewhere, and Steve feels… he feels tired. Impatient. Put out.
Tony slides into the booth with their drinks and says, “Please do not ask me about what happened with Pepper yesterday.”
Not that anyone’s asked, but I do have a supercut of moments that play in my head. Scene one: seated beside each other, our knees touching, then our thighs pressing against each other all throughout trips to wherever we need to jet off to to save the world. Scene two: hugs of relief that lasted a fraction of a second too long, punctuated by a squeeze, or the one time Steve had been bold and cupped the back of my head and held me even closer. Scene three: Steve inviting me to his apartment, the one safe space in his world, and with a gesture so simple showed me that his trust was complete.
Steve bites his bottom lip, a poor attempt at stopping himself from laughing. Tony flicks his forehead. “Say it again,” Tony says, and his smile still feels a little wobbly, but it’s a step.
So, scene seven: standing on Steve’s balcony, standing closer than we need to, like always. After our debrief Steve had seen me slumped over my desk, exhausted, aching for a drink. He touched the back of my wrist.
“One hundred percent,” Tony says, settling back into the chair and sighing, cheeks pink with a pleasant buzz.
Of course, this Steve guy had to go and be great at this, which is both charming and annoying in equal measure. Tony isn’t ashamed to admit that he’d expected Steve to be a ball of nerves, expected him to fumble around, maybe elbow Tony’s solar plexus by accident, or something.
Steve showers, and while towelling off thinks that it would be nice to try and draw again, or at least stay somewhere in the tower with a different view of the city. Steve double checks with JARVIS about the emptiness of the library (“You’re sure.” “Perfectly.”) and heads down. It’s only seven in the morning, none of the other Avengers would be up at this time, anyway.
Another night, another safehouse, except Steve’s fears are confirmed and Stane’s sent someone else. After his first failure, he knew better than to hope that Stane would leave him to it.
He walks them back slowly toward the bedroom, their knees knocking against each other, hips bumping into tables and chairs.
He and Tony are only a few inches apart, and Steve feels stiff and uncoordinated compared to Tony’s easy, graceful movements.
It’s thing like this that’re incomparable to anything else: to have Tony leaning against his chest, the both of them stoned enough to be happy but not too stoned to be stupid, licking a popsicle as the sun sets over the water, is one of the greatest moments in Steve’s life.
From here, Steve can see all the way to Brooklyn, and he feels a bit funny, to be standing in a high rise with all this expensive furniture, when a few years ago, his apartment could’ve fit inside his current bedroom. Steve scrunches up his face and looks around the room again.
They greet each other with an embrace, and it’s so ingrained in Steve to kiss people on the cheek in greeting that he only realizes he’s done it when Tony raises his eyebrows at Steve, surprised.
Steve is drying his hair when Tony comes back with two cups of coffee. He murmurs his thanks before taking a sip, and Tony sits down on the bed, watching Steve.
Steve doesn’t want to waste any more time than he already has. Every minute, Bucky slips deeper and deeper into obscurity, and Steve has had enough time to prepare himself to ask for Tony’s help (not that he didn’t want it, or think he needed it, it’s just—).
“You’re welcome.” Tony turns away to look for something on the workbench. So, it’s not just Steve buying time.
Tony pushes him against the doors just as the slide shut, kissing him soundly, his hands tugging up Steve’s shirt. The doors to the elevator open just as Tony undoes Steve’s belt.
“I want you to know that effective immediately, I am turning you all out of house and home,” Tony says, standing up and looking down at all of them imperiously.
Steve smiles to himself, settling into the couch and tightening his embrace around Tony. If this is what it takes to get Tony to sleep, then he doesn’t mind at all.
Steve takes a deep breath, adjusts the settings to just far enough to span the Old City, and what he figures to be close enough to where the man lives. He can’t explain why he’s doing this, or what he hopes to achieve. He hopes he finds the man on the app, and if he does, by some miracle, then maybe it’ll be a blessing enough that they match. Besides, he’s leaving two days from now, has a plane ticket to Barcelona, and this feels like a last ditch effort of pleading with the universe.
Steve turns to Tony to say thank you, but Tony’s already back by the window, adjusting measurements.
“Steve,” Tony says, “I don’t know if anyone has told you this already, but—it’s not your fault. You have to know that.” Tony touches Steve’s arm, as if asking Steve to look at him.
Steve marvels for a bit more at all the technology around him, then remembers why he came. “About last night,” he starts, and Tony holds up a hand.
Instead, he watches, cock twitching in his pajamas as he watches himself manhandle Steve. He clicks to the start of the video, pushes his pants down and takes his cock in his hand, stroking slowly as he watches the way Steve moves under him, remembering the way Steve felt under his hands, breathing hard, eyes trained on Tony’s as he came. Tony has proof, sees it in the video, and at that moment, he lets out a strangled cry.
Tony’s pacing around the room, looking close to tearing out his hair, and Pepper is perched on the armrest beside Rhodey, sipping on a cup of tea.
Steve reflects on this, runs a hand through his hair as if it’ll help tame the thoughts running amok in his brain. “Maybe Bucky would know,” he says, and it’s a strange thing to say, to even consider:
Later that night, after tossing and turning and thinking, still, of the man’s smile, he sits up and turns on his phone. He’s never really sincerely used this dating app, even after Bucky had helped set up his account and hovered over his shoulder as Steve swiped through.
Steve’s smile drops, and he sighs. “Not really. I don’t know.” Steve feels raw, split open. It’s an uncomfortable feeling, and Steve hasn’t decided if he’s going to regret this.
This shocks a laugh out of him. “Okay, fine.” Tony takes another moment to gather his thoughts, scattered as they are. “I just kept saying he was awful because it was easier that way. I never wanted you to know why because well, it’s dumb and I know you liked us together.”
Instead, Steve looks down, picks imaginary lint off his blanket, and shuts his eyes when Tony sighs loudly and leaves.
Steve pulls out his notebook and starts sketching, the activity handily keeping his mind focused on reality.
Under the carrying tray of the coffee Rhodey had bought is a slip of paper, and Tony picks it up. It’s Steve’s card.
Tony lets out a growl of frustration and crosses the room towards Steve. Steve doesn’t mean to, but only realizes he’s been backing away until his back hits the wall. Tony makes a move to touch Steve, to reach out, but stops, balling his hand into a fist and biting into it.
“Sir seems done for the morning and will be going to the penthouse soon,” JARVIS says, just as Steve hurriedly slides into a pair of jeans.
Funny, that. Tony hadn’t cared about the blood on the quinjet, when he’d turned Steve’s hands over to check for wounds because they were so caked in blood. But when they were clean? It plays in his mind’s eye over and over again, the way Tony had jerked away from him, from his hands.
“No more mead for you.” Tony holds out his hand, motioning for Steve to hand over the flask. Steve feels his jaw tighten with the renewed flush of irritation, but fights it down. This time, Tony’s right, he reminds himself. He hands over the flask and reaches behind Tony to press the exit button to the workshop.
“Do you want to watch a movie?” Tony asks. Steve lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding; he’s thankful Tony isn’t asking about what had happened at the gym and is giving him a way out.
Fury raises an eyebrow and stares Tony down. “I don’t recall having to explain things to you, Stark,” he says.
At the first touch of tongue, Steve shivers, all his nerve-endings alight with tension, waiting to see where Tony will touch him next. Tony’s hand moves from Steve’s jaw to rest on his nape, scratching his scalp with his fingernails, and Steve is shocked by the sound he makes: a soft, small moan, right into Tony’s mouth.
The memory leaves a sour taste in Tony’s mouth. Even now, after all these years, he can’t fathom why he reacted the way he did. They’d talked about the future often enough, daydreamed about living together, about moving back to New York and starting a life.
. He can’t help but hope that the man continues to serve his table, even if he knows it won’t go anywhere. It’s not like he knows if the man is gay or bisexual, or that he himself can communicate that without being so overt; how do people just
Somewhere within the workshop something whizzes. Steve helps Tony lie down on the couch, and then Dum-E rolls over and beeps.
JARVIS answer is undercut by Thor waltzing into the kitchen, Natasha in tow. Natasha’s gaze immediately zeroes in on Tony’s hand on Steve’s wrist, and Steve pulls away, as if electrocuted.
Tony bites his lip, but Steve can still see him smiling. He looks like he’s about to say something and Steve finds himself holding his breath, and then Tony shakes his head and bends down to press a quick kiss on Steve’s lips.
“I think I’m going to cry,” he says, and it’s a strange thing be so acutely aware of and at the same time so powerless to stop.
He downs a glass of water and attempts to fall back asleep, spending an hour tossing and turning instead before he decides to make himself something warm to drink.
, Steve thinks. There’s a part of him that just wants to hear the words from Tony’s mouth. After all this time, he’s never said no, never said he
It gives Steve a sorely needed boost in confidence. “I was thinking we could go on vacation together.”
“He tried to kill you!” Tony slams his hands against the workbench, sending a loud, resounding clang around the room. “You almost died,” he says, and he’s standing now, breathing hard, almost chest to chest against Steve.
“Hope so,” Steve says blandly, and walks up to the front door. He’s not doing it on purpose, this distancing. But beyond that, Steve can’t say—or maybe won’t. He doesn’t want to look at the emotions roiling inside him; hasn’t wanted to since they had their interview. He’s pretty sure Tony hasn’t noticed, but if he has, he hasn’t said anything about it. Which makes sense, there’s no reason for them to be closer; this weekend is the last stretch, and they’ll be focusing more on identifying potential threats, anyway.
After a while—probably, a long while—JARVIS pipes up: “Captain Rogers, Sir is inquiring about your status.”
Tony’s mouth parts in surprise from the contact, and Steve tilts his head for better access, their lips slotting back together. Steve feels hot, his pulse jittery and zinging around his body.
Steve feels crazy for even thinking that, but it’s true: Tony does manage to wriggle his way to Steve’s side, and Steve isn’t sure if it’s on purpose or if Steve is only cataloguing those moments and disregarding the rest. Surely, Tony isn’t seeking him out; he’s the one who said no, after all.
This one hits like a ton of bricks—literally, because Tony does know what that feels like, and the suit is shock proof, sure, but that shit still fucking hurts, and even in moments of epiphany, somehow he still manages to go off on a tangent. The point remains: Steve’s hand is on his hip, and they’re in bed, and epiphanies usually equate clarity, peace.
“Hello to you too, you overgrown labrador,” Tony laughs, pushing Steve away a little lest he be crushed under all combined weight of supersoldier and three bowls of pasta that Clint prepared for dinner.
Steve considers this. “But. Remember what I told you? When Natasha and I were in that bunker. Zola was saying that accidents happened. ‘When history didn’t cooperate, history was changed.’ Then he showed us newsreels of the car crash—”
Steve furrows his brow, expecting more of an answer, and chiding himself for not noticing the entirety of the man seated beside him. Gone is the bright light that emanated from his chest, and Steve wants to know why, and how, and when? But he doesn’t know if he can ask those questions, or if he did, if Tony would answer them. It’s a strange thing that Tony is here at all, really.
Steve smiles again, right before pressing a kiss to Tony’s shoulder. “Step one,” he says. “The problem is you’re afraid I don’t love you. Step two: find out how to show you that I do.” He pauses, and Tony feels breathless as he presses another kiss to Tony’s bare skin. “Step three. Hypothesis? If I show Tony I love him all the time, then eventually he’ll believe me.”
Steve smiles against Tony’s neck, his mind a pleasant hum of contentment, and they watch as the sun dips under the horizon to the sound of the waves lapping against the shore.
Then Tony shows up in the communal kitchen, two hours later, and dumps a sheaf of papers in front of Steve, right beside his oatmeal.
“I’d rather not hear what the general public thinks, thanks,” Tony says, sighing. He rests his face in his hands. It’s not like he meant to think of this—what is wrong with his brain, that the intrusive thoughts come in the form of the few moments he’d asked Steve what was on his mind, only to be brushed off?
“I’m—maybe we shouldn’t be in this position if we’re going to talk like this,” Tony says, suddenly cautious.
The words punch the air out of Steve. “What?” He recovers then adds, “I mean, me too, but.” He looks away, then looks back at Tony, feeling out of his depth.
Tony grunts and pushes Steve off him, muttering to himself in Spanish and half-dragging Steve the rest of the way.
“I didn’t realize that was on the table,” Steve breathes out, trying to get his bearings and trying to stop himself from reacting to having Tony so close.
No one knows how in his head Steve can get about things; most people just assume Steve’s the type to just do, and then deal with happens after the doing. Which is true most of the time. When the stakes are all Steve, recklessness is the status quo.
He took my hands and pressed them against the bed, pinned my hips down with his. I would’ve been embarrassed by how hard I was, except he was, too, and I didn’t know what to do, but I knew, too, that I didn’t want it to stop. I didn’t want us to pretend, like all the other times, that this didn’t happen. It was happening. Something was happening and one of us was going to break.
Steve wakes up and immediately, with no preamble or forethought, wishes he didn’t. His breath comes out in short bursts as images from his dream surface and fade just as quickly: snow, a train, a hand in his, a scream.
“Just trust me, Steve, you’ll love it. I’ll even pay attention,” he smirks at Steve, “Which is more than what I was going to do for Gene Kelly.”
So Steve was surprised to find that for their next date, Tony had bought tickets to a concert. Ella Fitzgerald Appreciation Night. Steve wore a suit, held Tony’s hand throughout the two hours they sat beside each other, and on the steps of the concert hall, murmured, “thanks, Tony,” and kissed him on the cheek. It was worth it just to learn how pink Tony‘s cheeks could get.
We didn’t say anything, once we were lying down. First both facing up, then he touched my arm and I curled against him because I know that’s what he wanted. He slid his arm under my neck, closed his eyes and wrapped his other arm around my waist and pulled me closer.
“Only because it was you that was looking,” Tony admits, looking down at Steve’s lips then back up at him.
“I—” Steve starts, stops. “That’s a good question,” he finishes, smiling sheepishly. He remembers the fight, the explosion, but that’s it. He didn’t even know about the water.
Beside him, Tony shifts, trying to get comfortable as they lie down on the large lounge chair on the deck. It’s quiet, save for the sound of the surf and the occasional chirp of a cricket.
“Don’t what?” Steve snaps reflexively. For all the ground they’d covered in their new friendship, it’s almost too easy to fall back into this old pattern of pushing each other’s buttons.
“Getting there,” Steve agrees, and risks slipping another hand under Tony’s shirt. Tony huffs appreciatively and leans in to kiss him.
“I’d be pretty pissed if you knew any other opulent assholes,” Tony said with a smirk, pulled the pillow out of Steve’s arms, and plopped it down on the floor.)
“Oh, Steve.” Tony sounds tired, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I—do you remember what you told me before, about Zola and the car accident?” Tony lifts himself to sit on the workbench, kicking his feet against the metal.
Steve feels annoyance flare in his stomach, but stays silent. He doesn’t know why the conversation has taken this turn. Tony was just talking to him kindly, which was admittedly strange but certainly not unwelcome, given that Steve is pretty sure there’s still a bullet hole healing somewhere near his stomach.
thing—about going on dates with Tony is how surprisingly pleasant their conversations were. After the initial awkwardness of their first, Steve had made an effort to open up, too. He talked about drawing, art, and music.
Steve stops, runs a shaky hand through his hair. “It sounds awfully pigheaded of me to say these things out loud,” he says.
“God, Steve,” Tony says, and he sounds sad, but that can’t be right, Tony has no reason to be sad, he doesn’t have a horse in this race.
Well. If there’s one thing he’s grateful for, it’s that Tony didn’t mention the drawings: Tony’s hands, Tony’s mouth, Tony’s back.
, exhausted from his back-to-back shoots, and usually he’d just jack himself off to get to sleep but he’s too tired to even get hard.
Steve huffs, tears out the page. “Fuck,” he hisses. He crumples up the paper and throws it towards the growing pile by the bin.
Steve bites his lip. This shouldn’t be a difficult question to answer, but everything he can think of sounds boring. “Well, what do you like to do?” Steve asks, instead.
They sink back into quiet for a while, but the air is thick around them. Steve feels uncomfortable, but doesn’t know what to do about it, anxiety tying knots in his stomach. He doesn’t know why he feels the need to do anything about it.
Tony's spent the past few days in bed, reluctantly catching up on sleep. His complexion is better, no longer as pallid as he was when they found him. Still, there's a wound above his eyebrow that's still healing, and his knuckles are still bruised.
The movement, evidently, is enough to jostle Tony awake. He lets out a pitiful groan. “Why the fuck did we sleep on the beach,” he grumbles, and Steve watches as Tony rolls away from him and out of his cocoon.
“I need a drink,” Tony said over their laptops.The sun was beginning to set outside the cafe they frequented when they needed to get work done.
Steve wakes up because the sun is bright against his face and he feels like he’s overheating. Beside him, Tony’s face is pressed against his arm, the rest of him rolled inside the beach towel. Steve throws an arm over his eyes in an attempt to shield himself.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, breath hot against Steve’s mouth. “It’s my fault that you’re feeling this way.”
Steve reduces the heat on the stove and walks up to Tony. After a few seconds of being disregarded, Steve pokes him in the shoulder. “I’m making spaghetti.”
Bruce nudges Clint awake as JARVIS begins updating the team with the information on a new HYDRA cell; this one is tucked deep in Spain, somewhere called Salamanca.
“I think you’re right,” Steve murmurs, smiling a little. He can tell everyone’s watching, so he leans close and presses a quick kiss to Tony’s lips.
Steve doesn’t want to look at him, so he doesn’t. Truthfully, he’s afraid of seeing the look on Tony’s face, the hurt that’s probably there. It’s too naked an emotion, after their fight. Their first one as actual friends, Steve thinks.
The part only to suck in a few breaths before diving back in, and Steve isn’t thinking of anything other than the desperate, primal need for closeness; he rests his hands on Tony’s hips then slides them down to his ass, then to just behind his thighs, lifting him up to sit on his lap and Tony makes a broken sound at being lifted, but Steve swallows it down, and this, this,
Bruce is leaning against Clint, tablet still glowing bright in his hands, as his head lolls to the side and lands against Clint’s shoulder.
Steve makes a sound of protest, feeling his cheeks heat. “Oh,” he says. He bites his lip for a moment, then says, “you are too.”
She finds them first; surrounded by rubble and quiet. The tenderness of the scene almost takes her breath away. “Is he—” she starts. Tony looks up, startled, his hand stopping mid-motion from stroking Steve’s hair away from his face.
“Man,” Sam looks up from his phone to give Steve a once over, “I don’t want to hear anything, if you don’t wanna talk about it,” he says, looking back at his phone.
“We really did go through. A whole thing,” Tony says, and quiets again as he thinks. “A surprise bonus was that I got to discover exactly how great an artist you are.”
The bar has just opened for its afternoon shift, and Steve takes a deep breath before opening the door and stepping inside.
“But that’s all it was,” Tony says, and Steve notices the edge to Tony’s voice. “It was an accident. Besides, I’m pretty sure Howard would have more notes about it if he succeeded. He’d be too proud not to have that plastered everywhere.”
“Was an alert sent out that I wasn’t aware of?” Steve’s voice is sharp with sarcasm, but he didn’t mean it; again, he feels far away from himself. All he can see are his hands.
Thor shows up from Asgard with little fanfare, and it’s as the team is filtering into the kitchen mid-afternoon that he pulls carefully placed six flasks on the counter. They’re wrought steel, with ornate swirls and alien artwork.
Suffice to say, they haven’t had much time to talk, least of all get to know each other. Still, it strikes Steve as a calculated move on Tony’s end; Tony, who insists on flash and pizazz. It makes Steve wonder if anyone has really ever gotten to know Tony.
Steve drinks in the sight of him—Tony's eyes closed and face turned towards the sun, a small smile on his lips. It's still so new to Steve, being allowed to do this, to appreciate Tony without having to pretend that he doesn't mean it. It's so new, how when Tony reaches over blindly to tangle his fingers with Steve's, there's a strange flutter that winds its way through Steve's chest.
“I hear you,” Sam says, a laugh in his voice. “But you are, though. You’re looking. You’re reading up about everything that we know about him, what HYDRA knows. I think that’s something,” Sam says, his voice shifting to a more soothing tone. Steve clicks his tongue in response, doesn’t correct Sam, and keeps reading.
Tony thumbs a tear away, then places a kiss on its path. “Sorry,” he mumbles again, and does the same for the other cheek.
“Oh, you know, sure,” Steve says sardonically. He doesn’t shrug off Tony’s hand, but Tony moves away anyway. “Everyone keeps saying that.”
Tony nods, as if Steve had said those thoughts out loud. “I won’t tell if you don’t,” he says, touching a finger to his nose. “Secret’s safe with me.”
Steve’s pretty sure this says something about him, about how he idealizes things, wants control over the story. He doesn’t dwell on these dreams enough to parse them. If nothing else, Steve wants the dreams to bolster his confidence in finally talking to Tony about what had happened between them almost a month ago, to see if there was still a chance, maybe.
Steve’s happy for the relative darkness and the distance between them; that way, Stark doesn’t get to see the blush on his cheeks at the use of the pet name.
The next three hours are spent talking amongst one another about what that means for them in their respective relationships. They’re all seated a few feet away from each other, giving them a sense of privacy. It’s not hard for Steve to pick up what they’re all saying to one another over the low buzz of conversation.
Steve wrinkles his nose as he looks around the intersection he’s found himself on. He tries not to be too obvious about it, and he hates when he gets sympathetic looks from the locals. So he glances at the street sign, then back at the shopfront.
Then Rhodey and Pepper arrive and Rhodey offers to buy a round and Natasha stares at Tony as he and Pepper talk about what to get for dinner.
Tony nods, not really listening. His head is swimming with what he thinks could be actual reasons why Steve had kept this from him. A tangled mess of fear and insecurity, then shock at his ability to be aware of it. Is this maturity? He doesn’t like it much. Better if it stayed Steve’s fault—and it is Steve’s fault, it is. But maybe Tony doesn’t need to work himself up like this. But then again, Tony’s already worked up. “Stop,” Tony grinds out.
“I know,” he says. He can’t seem to bring himself to meet Tony’s gaze just yet. There are too many emotions roiling inside him: relief, fear, gratitude, love.
Steve stares at his notebook, the messy scrawl of his handwriting, and squeezes his eyes shut. Then, he scratches it all out.
Natasha knows that she has this power over people that make them spill their secrets. She uses it wisely, most of the time.
Tony blushes and tries to tug his hand away, but Steve tightens his grip, kisses the inside of Tony’s wrist, then up his arm. “What is it?”
He stares at the hoodie on the floor, faded a little in the collar and at the cuffs, from how often he’d tug them. Tony squats down and picks it up, his heart clenching as memories come unbidden.
) why they’d broken up. When Pepper had tried digging, Rhodey didn’t have any answers for her. Back in college, he said, they were the picture of a perfect couple. Then… they weren’t. Tony didn’t talk about it. Ever. Something about this was
“It’s me,” Steve says, laughing a little. The man gestures to the seat in front of him from behind the bar.
Bruce shrugs, then nudges Natasha’s legs up to retrieve his book. JARVIS has lowered the music to a soft hum, and Natasha and Clint’s are bowed close together as they look at something on Clint’s phone.
Twelve miles later and Steve still can’t think. It’s as if his mind has just erected a wall around the memory and refuses to access it, either out of self-defense or shame.
After spending the good part of an hour swiping and never coming across the man’s profile, Steve sighs and puts his phone away.
Scene four, five, six: the sureness of his arm around my waist as I picked him up off the ground in the suit, a mutual understanding that neither of us acknowledged out loud.
He thinks that maybe he’s finally ready to try (even if it’s not going anywhere, but Steve doesn’t want to dwell on that, not yet, at least).
“You sure he’s in the right place?” Tony asks Jan, again. She tuts in response, just like she did earlier. “He’s too pretty, Jan.”
“I’m never just me. I’m never just Steve Rogers anymore. It’s always Captain America: Steve Rogers, or just Captain America. It gets—” Steve grapples with the admission, then says, “It gets tiring.”
“Gonna need you to,” Tony says, shifting to lift up his shirt. Steve lets out a small breath before helping Tony take it off. This is
The doorknob to Steve’s bedroom turns slowly, and Steve takes aim from behind his bed. It’s as fortified a position as any, right now, and he has the advantage.
He doesn’t know why he’s crying. He hates it. It being: crying, and not knowing why he’s crying. Well. He knows. But he doesn’t want to dwell on it.
“Give me some credit,” Steve says. “I’m pretty sure I’ve been saying this for a while, now.” Tony shakes his head, dismissing Steve’s attempt at levity.
A box is left at the entrance of the tower, unmarked. The man who left it had covered enough of his face to make JARVIS have to work at finding him.
“You really should,” Steve says, and pushes Tony’s legs to the side so he can sit on the cot. He’s aiming for casual friendliness, and he hopes he doesn’t come off as anything else.
Steve cups Tony’s cheek, rubs their noses together. “No,” he says. “I remember being over there,” he lifts his hand to point at the spot under the tree. Then, he rests his hand once again on Tony’s face. “I remember how bright the sun was, and the shorts you wore were red…” he trails off, smiling as he sees Tony’s face crinkle up with fondness.
—but Tony’s workshop is a marvel he never would have dreamt up. There are so many machines, all clean lines and smooth movement, working at absurd precision as they whir around and build. Big, blue holograms with Tony’s designs, blown up with their measurements displayed on glass. Movie makers couldn’t come up with this in their wildest dreams, and Tony had thought this all up and
They don’t have time to say anything else, arriving at the scene of the AIM attack. Natasha’s too focused on staying alive, listening on the comms for the next move, when she notices that a line has gone silent just as the battle winds down.
“You absolutely, one hundred percent, belted out that chorus, and it was one of the most magnificent things I’ve ever witnessed,” Tony says, chin jutted up, as if daring Steve to question him. Steve laughs, and laughs, and laughs.
He turns around and pushes things around his workbench, then turns to Steve with a flourish. “A few weeks ago you talked about how you never got to see Europe during peacetime, and well…” Tony pauses and licks his lips. “I figured you’d never gone on vacation, either. After everything. So.”
Tony, meanwhile, is looking at him like he hung the sun; there’s a soft smile on his lip, and the emotion is clear in his face. Adoration, fondness.
“Wait,” Steve sits up properly now, moves to get up, but Tony’s out the door before Steve can get any words together. Still, Steve tries, runs out the door after him and catches Tony standing in the elevator lobby, shoes in hand.
Maybe it was because Steve was the one who reached out first—wrapped an arm around my shoulders and held me against him.
Steve gestures at them and Tony ducks his head and laughs. Steve can’t say what comes over him, but he can’t bear the thought of not looking at Tony now that he can, so he reaches over, cups Tony’s jaw, and pulls him into a kiss.
They’re quiet, and then Steve asks JARVIS to play some music (not Tony’s), and the air is filled with the sweet notes of showtunes. Tony rolls his eyes and shakes his head at the music. “Oklahoma? Really?”
“Why didn’t you want me,” Steve asks, and he knows he sounds pitiful and he hates it, but he can’t bring himself to stop, either.
Bruce frowns back at his book. Tony had mentioned earlier that he was working on something urgent, hence the need for Bruce’s support.
He remembers how Tony’s skin felt against his, how the bottle of sunscreen had gotten trapped between their chests, how Tony had laughed against his mouth, how he thought, as Tony smiled at him, that he was more beautiful than anything in the world.
After three months of this, it’s almost over, and Steve can’t bear the thought of letting it pass. He thinks of how foolish he was, all this time, pretending that he didn’t feel anything, just because it was safer that way.
“Sorry,” Tony says, sliding onto the seat opposite Steve and almost slamming his phone, face down, onto the table.
It’s been two weeks. In the haze of the firefight, Steve had lost sight of Tony, who had flown off with the president’s wife. Steve was busy protecting the President and everyone else in the room, and then the team had arrived.
Their first date really is dinner; a small modern Japanese restaurant in Midtown. It’s not too flashy, and Steve fumbles with his chopsticks for a second before Tony reaches over and adjusts his grip.
Steve is sprawled out on the couch in the workshop. “You know about Operation Paperclip,” he says, and it’s not really a question. He’s reading through Natasha’s file again.
okay and we bumped into him at an exhibit and Pepper made googly eyes at him and said we should all catch up over dinner.” Tony takes a deep breath after his tirade, then deflates. He sips on his whisky sullenly.
Steve is jolted out of his thoughts and types in his code. “I feel the need to warn you that Sir has not slept in 36 hours,” JARVIS says, right before Steve pushes the door open.
,” Tony whines, half-heartedly trying to get out of her grip. After a short tussle, Tony rights himself up and scoots closer to Rhodey. She looks close to pulling him back into a hug, but her phone beeps.
After that afternoon spent in Steve’s room, getting intimately acquainted with each others’ lips, it’s like a dam breaks between them. Steve feels, in a strange way, liberated; he can do anything to Tony, now, pull him close and press a kiss to his lips, sidle up and wrap an arm around Tony’s waist. It’s all so frighteningly normal, their bodies slotting into each other, like all is right in the world.
Steve feels Tony’s hands on his wrists, gently pulling his hands away from his face. “Hi,” Tony says, softly. Tony’s kneeling in front of Steve, his body taking the space between Steve’s legs. It’s an intimate position, Steve notes, as he looks at Tony, his damp hair, the sharp angles of his beard. Steve looks away, ashamed by his want.
They move toward Steve’s balcony and Tony lights up, taking a long drag before passing the joint to Steve. Steve wonders idly if Tony just has drugs on his person at all times, but wouldn’t put it past him; after all, he’s Tony Stark. Even after all this time, it’s still a marvel to him that they’re friends—that they could be more than that, if one of them decided to finally make a move.
“HYDRA would have a lot more to gain by keeping Howard alive for him to make more of it though, right?”
“Thanks,” Tony says. He’s been in a dour mood since he’d stumbled upon Steve’s jacket. What’s worse is that he
The gesture is what tips the slow swell of affection that had begun to bloom in Steve’s chest into a full crescendo, and this is probably why, at this exact moment, the lights of New York shining around them, Tony’s hand on top of his, that Steve leans down and kisses Tony.
that, anyway? Steve takes a sip of his beer, enjoying the idea that he could be that kind of person, maybe. The kind who just jumped someone’s bones, didn’t worry what other people would think.
When he wakes up again, Tony’s already sitting up on his side of the bed, thumbing through his phone.
“I bring gifts!” Thor announces brightly. They all pick up a flask, examining them closely. “The finest Asgardian mead, for Earth’s mightiest warriors.”
“How was your day?” Steve doesn’t even turn to look when Tony enters the apartment, can tell who it is from the heavy sigh that follows once the door clicks shut.
Tony cracks an eye open and grabs a fistful of Steve’s shirt. “Come,” he grumbles, tugging Steve down. Steve bites back a grin, and moves Tony around so there’s enough space for the both of them. Tony lifts his head, and Steve extends his arm, offering it up as a pillow.
This is a familiar scene, now, Steve thinks, as he stands on the balcony with a cup of sweet coffee, surveying the city.
, except now Steve has become distinctly aware of every time Tony touches him. It feels electric, every time, and it makes Steve not want things to go back to normal for a little while, until he realizes how crazy that sounds.
Steve can see the individual lashes around Tony’s eyes, only then does it register that he’s been moving closer and closer (and that means, Tony has been too, right? Steve thinks, dazedly). Their noses touch, and they both let out a surprised huff of laughter.
“Of course not,” Tony says, smirking. “Come on, there’s an apple pie in this cafe I found that has your name on it.”
Steve pulls out a pan, digs around the refrigerator for eggs, and then pours a cup of coffee. He mixes in two teaspoons of brown sugar and wordlessly places it in front of Tony, just as he downs the last dregs of his first cup.
“Now we just have to make sure the President stays alive,” Steve says, hefting his weekend bag over his shoulder.
“Did you hear me? You. You’re the love of my life. Please don’t make me compare,” Steve huffs out a small laugh, and it warms Tony all over, like sunshine peeking through the clouds after a strong rain. “And maybe you don’t believe me just yet,” Steve touches their foreheads together, then rubs his nose against Tony’s, the affection plain and chaste. It makes Tony feel more loved than he’s ever felt in his life—not that there were many moments to compare against, but still.
Bucky, the one person in the world who had stayed with Steve through everything. Bucky, who had fallen all those years (
There’s so much information scattered about the multiple panes of glass (they’re monitors, not just displays, Steve realizes belatedly), calculations running and being processed into lines of zeroes and ones. On the workbenches are neat illustrations of the armor and its ammunition, and one showing a blown up boot with what Steve assumes to be adjustments to the wiring.
They drink some more, and somehow they end up on the balcony overlooking the tower, Steve cradling a bowl of reheated pasta to his chest. Beside him, Tony is lying on a lounge chair, eyes half lidded as he smiles over New York like it’s his kingdom (which, Steve notes, it maybe kinda is).
Steve pinches the bridge of his nose, inhaling deeply to keep his misplaced anger in check. “I said I’m fine.”
Pepper doesn’t need to look at Tony to know that he’s frowning at her; she can feel his irritation come off in waves.
Steve slips his gun out from his bedside table, throws open his curtains to give him more light. He can hear the light steps of whoever has broken in, and he’s pretty sure this is his moment of reckoning—a former mark’s family member, someone from Stane’s gang finally tired of waiting and tying up a loose end, hell, it could be Tony Stark himself except Steve’s pretty sure he couldn’t be stealthy if his life depended on it. If it were Stark, he’d probably have just hacked into Steve’s microwave and made it explode.
Sometimes, and these are the ones he likes best, he leans over in the three minutes allotted to them and presses a soft kiss to Tony’s lips.
Tony looks away and licks his lips. “Yes,” he sighs. “That and, well. By how much I felt?” Tony shakes his head. “That sounds gross.”
“That would’ve worked three years ago!” Tony shouts from the kitchen, the air filled with the sound of corn popping.
Thor scoops a large amount of Froot Loops into his mouth. From behind Tony, Steve gives Thor a look.
“Building stuff, I guess?” Tony says, then laughs, a real one, this time. “Jesus, this shouldn’t be so hard, Cap. Stop looking at me like I’m a target.”
It’s this feeling of distance that allows him to revisit an earlier thought, from when he’d first seen Bucky in this future world: is it even really Bucky, anymore? Or is it a man in a body Steve had known? But just as quickly, Steve disregards these notions, knows, deep in his bones, that of course it’s still Bucky. It has to be, and it is.
Steve pads out of his bedroom and stops when he sees Tony in the kitchen, leaning against the counter as he types on his phone. The kettle is beginning to sing, and Tony huffs and drops his phone before turning off the flame.
A laugh bubbles out of Steve, joyful and unbidden, and a little bit shocked. “Good,” he says, reaching out and holding Tony’s hand, which is as disgustingly sweaty as his own. “Good.”
At one point their kisses get heated enough that Steve acts on what he’d dreamt up, pushes Tony against a wall and slides his hands under Tony’s shirt, making Tony gasp.
“They’re making popcorn and rounding people up for movie night,” Tony says, leaning on the doorframe. Steve drinks the image in: Tony, illuminated by the light of the setting sun. His heather gray t-shirt, the muscles around his wrists, his black jeans that didn’t start out ripped.
,” Tony huffs, oblivious to Steve’s inner musings. Then they’re inside, and Tony hushes him as they stumble toward the elevator.
“Why does it matter?” Tony asks, deflating all of the sudden and sinking down to sit beside Rhodey. “Why can’t you just believe me?”
Steve is familiar with the motion, and that’s the only time he realizes: “What happened to your—” he says, as he gestures to his own sternum.
And it’s not like—it’s not like anything could happen, Steve reasons. He still can’t say he’s really figured Tony out. It’s worrisome to consider what could happen if he’s found out, because against all odds, he and Tony do get along. He doesn’t want to go back to the time when they were just a step above strangers.
They’re quiet, tonight. Tired, drunk, ready to lie down. They say nothing as they lean against each other and wait for the elevator to bring them up to Steve’s room.
Steve wakes up from his dream with a jolt: His chest arching off the bed, hands gripping the sheets. He feels hot all over, his body reacting to his dream: trapped in ice, but awake, watching the world go by, stuck.
Steve furrows his brow at the ceiling. “Okay, I wasn’t going to ask,” he says, feeling infinitesimally defensive at the implications of JARVIS’ statement.
Steve disregards Tony’s offered hand and sits up on his own. He digs the heels of his palms into his eyes in an attempt to stymy the tears. “That was a good one, Tony,” he says, and he’s proud of himself because his voice doesn’t crack.
Tony looks over his shoulder and regards Steve for a moment, then his eyes flick to the rest of the team, behind Steve and catching up to them.
Steve feels his body tense up: his mouth opens and shuts on its own accord, his brain trying and failing to come up with something to say.
Tony grumbles. Steve continues to smile as he peppers Tony’s neck and back with kisses. He feels giddy and excited, and he pulls Tony closer against him.
“Want to talk about what happened back there?” And only now does it register that Steve had nearly killed someone, that Steve had lost control so profoundly.
Steve is sitting on his bed, watching his hand shake. He feels as if he’s watching himself through glass, the thoughts rattling around his head coming off as white noise.
Steve sits up straighter. Natasha clicks on the autopilot and gets up from her seat to shake Clint and Bruce awake. Tony reaches over and tugs at Thor’s boot, waking him up as well.
Tony breathes out through his mouth, then in through his nose. Steve tips his chin up and meets his gaze.
He curses again as he flips his laptop open. His desktop is a mess, flooded with icons and random files, but he knows what he’s looking for.
“You’re going through something right now. Something really difficult. I know that, and I’m here for you, okay?” Tony looks back at Steve, waiting for an acknowledgement. Steve swallows, and nods.
But they haven’t. They should be better at this. Steve paces around Tony’s workshop, Dum-E following him as he goes.
“As I was saying,” Fury says, “Both of you will run this operation. It’s a long game, and you’ve got to keep the public convinced that it’s all genuine. We need you in that cabin in three months.”
“After,” Steve says, pulling Tony close and wrapping his arms around his waist. “Tell me,” he prods.
Tony leans closer, and Steve mirrors the movement until they’re only inches apart. He moves his other hand and cups Tony’s cheek.
“It’s easy,” Tony says, voice strained. “Just gonna—” and to emphasize his point, the reactor comes fully out of his chest with a
Tony laughs. “I was kidding.” He takes a bottle of water from the break table and takes a swig, mostly to have something to do with his hands, which are itching to continue touching Steve. Tony wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and considers Steve before speaking, “You’re not so bad, yourself.”
He digs around his desk for a new notebook, disregarding the taste of metal on his tongue as he sets aside half-finished sketches and pencils.
Tony finds out with his hands deep in JARVIS’ code. Former-JARVIS, actual-JARVIS, he hasn’t really decided on what to refer to the mess of numbers of letters that formed his former AI, and now, well—Vision, too. It’s all a mess, really, and Tony wanted something simple to do with his hands, minimal focus, low-risk.
Steve starts to laugh, because Tony is an idiot, and he’s an idiot, and they were probably drawn together by the universe due to their shared idiocy. He tells Tony this.
Steve thinks of Tony’s presence, of all the times he’d pushed Tony away, of all the times Tony had found him. It dawns on him, all at once: “I didn’t mean to keep running away.”
Tony pats Steve’s back. “You were such an asshole last night,” he says. “Like, seriously, the fucking worst. This is your karma.”
“Yeah,” Steve tries to smile. He’s not sure if he actually achieves it. “Anyway. You said you wanted to talk?”
Even if he’s all alone, he can’t say why he hasn’t thrown out Steve’s favorite jacket. It didn’t even fit him properly, and stopped smelling like Steve years ago. He does remember—quite shamefully—that it’s the one thing of Steve’s he didn’t give back. After what had happened he’d packed up everything that reminded him of Steve and given it to him, except this.
He feels a bit manic, and just wants to rest. He’s afraid of what he might do if he goes too long without sleep, if it’s possible for him to get unhinged. He doesn’t want to find out. He just wants to sleep and wake up tomorrow with renewed vigor to find his best friend.
Steve can’t sleep. Again. He oscillates between his sketchbook, the TV, the reports on his tablet but nothing keeps his attention, and nothing helps him feel any less keyed up. Steve sits on his bed and surveys his room, and his eyes land on the small flask of mead Thor had given each of them.
He flicks on his tablet and continues to read through the packet as he waits for Tony to fall asleep. Tony shifts around, trying to get comfortable, all while grumbling under his breath.
Steve takes deep breaths, then sits up. The analog clock on his bedside tells him it’s four in the morning.
“Nothing,” Tony laughs, just as Steve kisses the inside of Tony’s elbow. “I am just glad that you came to the bar.”
Steve shrugs in response. The sudden truce between them feels fearless, both of them exuding the strange relief of finally speaking without the threat of violence.
Steve makes a small, whiny sound, just for himself. He hates not being able to do anything, hates waiting. He’s always been a man of action, and to be forced into a state of inaction makes him antsy.
So Steve does. Tells him about Fury, his apartment, about seeing Bucky, the fights, finding out about Hydra. Tony plays the perfect audience, listening in rapt attention and asking questions when Steve pauses. Steve isn’t used to this, at least not from Tony, who barely gives conversations enough attention to finish a sentence. Steve talks, and talks, and talks, and Tony nods along as he reaches into a cupboard to pull out a bag of chips or pour cups of coffee for them both.
“We’ll find him,” Steve says, patting the robot on the head. It’s funny, how he’s trying to comfort a robot.
The touches could be seen inconsequential things: a hand on Steve’s lower back as they all file out of the elevator, or touching Steve’s forearm while they’re having dinner to ask him to please pass the salt, or his knee bumping against Steve’s when they sit on the couch together.
“Yeah, I. Medical’s on the way.” Natasha breathes out, and fully takes everything in now that she’s adjusted to the threat level.
Tony’s in the middle of a call by the time the food’s ready. Steve waves his hand at Tony, who is standing by the window, pacing.
He tilts Tony’s head up, wanting to see Tony’s face, scrunched up with sheer delight. Tony follows the movement, then he leans forward and kisses Steve again, and this—this is much better.
Beneath it, though, is a grain of doubt: Why? Why did he keep it hidden? Especially now—after all the truth came spilling out of them, crystallizing into something Tony held dear. And after all Steve had said, about keeping secrets, about
Bruce, Natasha, and Tony are speaking in hushed tones as Steve checks his gear one more time. Thor arrives last, adjusting his chestplate with one hand and yawning as he sets his hammer down on the floor.
Tony’s manager waved them off early, and Steve left a generous tip while Tony was putting on his jacket.
“Me, I’m saying it,” Tony says. Panic is beginning to bubble in his belly, slowly rising up his throat. Typical of him to mistake a eureka moment with a panic attack. Par for the fucking course for Tony Stark. “I’m being difficult right now.”
“There really isn’t—I don’t know, okay? I think I’m managing. I’ve been trying to write about it like you told me, but I can’t get anything out of my head.”
He remembers Tony’s hands on his chest, then on his stomach, then on the skin just above his hip, right above the band of his trunks.
Steve takes a step back, Tony’s words landing hard like a slap to the face. “It’s not like flicking a switch,” he says, trying his best to be level-headed, afraid of what he might say if he isn’t.
Steve smiles, one arm around Tony’s waist and the other resting squarely on Tony’s stomach as they pose for a photo. He turns and looks at Tony, smiling still, and Tony looks back at him, eyebrows lifted in an unspoken question. Then Steve leans forward, presses gently against Tony’s stomach until he’s leaning back, and Steve presses a kiss to his lips, and it feels so
They do a few more takes, try one where Steve’s wearing a different shirt, and one where Steve is talking to the gaffer, so his gaze is set off camera.
Tony turns to look up at Steve, his features highlighted by the glow of dusk. “You happy?” He asks. He asks these questions periodically, as if Steve hasn’t given him enough proof, or maybe (more likely) that he doesn’t believe it.
The next thing I know he’d flipped me onto my back. My hands flew up to his shoulders, but I didn’t know if I was going to push him away or pull him closer.
Steve wants to punch something. Himself, mostly, just to have some semblance of control over his pain. His heart is rattling around his ribcage and so Steve decides that maybe today is the day he finally takes Sam’s advice; Today, he’s going to write about his feelings.
In spite of this standing agreement with JARVIS, Steve has bumped into Tony thrice already, and—again, now, for the fourth time, spilling orange juice down his shirt.
It’s happened often enough that when Steve finds Tony passed out on the couch, he doesn’t make a fuss. Instead, just gets a blanket from Tony’s room and drapes it over him.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “I can’t recall,” he says, pausing for dramatic effect. “Was that before or after your sensual sunscreen application?”
“My apartment is a street away,” Tony breathes out, but tilts his head to give Steve access to his jaw, his neck.
“I can’t help fix you, Steve,” Tony says, and looks away again, moving his jaw away from Steve’s palm. “I can barely fix
Tony shakes his head, and he’s disappointed, and Steve hates that, hates that he knows that, hates that he deserves to be disappointed in.
Tony shushes him and moves his hand back to being tucked under the pillow. Steve continues the movement, happy to just be touching him.
“Says the man who was literally frozen in ice,” Tony smirks. “I think we’re way past the point of ever using that word anymore, Steve.”
“Finally they sent a pretty one to come after me,” he manages to say, before breaking into a hacking cough. “Just my luck,” he adds, his voice rough.
Peter laughs, a small, nervous thing. “All the more to be grateful to you both, then,” he says. “Mind if I start recording?”
“Fine,” Tony says, steepling his fingers over his stomach. “Tell me, Steve. How can we make our relationship more open to communication?”
Tony had asked him at lunch, over the din of the crowd, how he’d like to celebrate their anniversary.
He only realizes he’s watching Tony intently when laughter and clapping snap him out of his thoughts.
Tony laughs, full and vibrant. “Well, fuck you too!” he says, shaking his head as he climbs onto a treadmill.
Then, around them, the alarm sounds. “Looks like we have to save the drinks for later,” Steve says, making sure Thor sees Steve pocket his flask; he wants Thor to know they appreciate it.
Looking back at it now, I was a fool to consider Steve’s apartment a haven. But it was learned behavior, pavlovian—every time I’d go there, he would touch me, and I would touch him, simple and chaste, except in the four corners of that space I didn’t have to think of what it would look like to anyone else.
It was a normal Tuesday between the two of them, stressed and under duress and Tony needing a drink. Tony had escaped his office to work with Steve, using the excuse that a change of scenery made him more productive.
Tony snorts. “While it’s an honor that you think I can get her to do anything, we both know that woman literally has otherworldly senses,” he says. He walks into the library and takes a seat on the couch beside Steve. “Did you talk to her?”
He inches forward until his chest is flush against Tony’s back, and he worms an arm around Tony’s waist. Steve smiles to himself as he presses a small kiss on Tony’s nape.
,” Steve says, crossing his arms over his chest. He can’t pinpoint why he feels so touchy about this, hates himself for not being able to meet Tony’s gaze, hates himself for wanting to, for being just a little bit curious. Steve stills, then comes back to himself.
Steve’s eyes remain trained on the floorboards, dark brown with swirls of black grain. Tony touches Steve’s wrist. Steve keeps his eyes fixed on the floor, trying to measure his breathing.
“Well darling, so are you, and that’s what we pay for,” Jan says, meeting Tony’s eyes in the reflection of the mirror. She tilts her head, assessing him, before she runs a hand through Tony’s hair.
He’s hard, as if he hadn’t spent the past 12 hours in a shoot, popping a pill to keep him up as he held another anonymous man close and imagined Steve in his place.
“Here are the variables,” Tony breathes out, is afraid of what he’ll say next, his brain is fogged over and full of static. “I love you, and I don’t know what to do with that.”
Clint shifts on the floor beside Tony, using Bruce’s knee as rest for his elbow and getting comfortable on one of the floor pillows.
“I will,” Steve says, and means it. He turns back to the kettle that’s beginning to sing, and they both walk back to the team together. Steve feels the beginnings of doubt (fear) niggling somewhere below his heart. So, maybe, fine:
His breaths are even as the door opens. For a split second, his eyes meet that of his attacker; he was right, it was someone from Stane’s crew, and Steve barely raises his gun and then the window behind him explodes with force. The man’s head tips back, a bullet lodging itself right in between his eyebrows.
“It’s fine, though. I’m fine,” Steve says, wrapping his hand around Tony’s finger and lifting it off his chest. “I’m fine.”
Maybe he’s just making it all up in his head. That’s the easy solution, isn’t it? And that’s usually the answer: start with the easiest answer and work your way up. He can already see Natasha rolling her eyes at him.
Tony raises his eyes in response and holds a finger up, and Steve sits down with a sigh. Tony was doing too much. Ever since they became roommates, he was always doing too much, and a small part of him feels that Tony only suggested that they become roommates because Steve had asked. Which is to say, Tony never said no to anyone who asked anything of him.
thing in the 60s,” Tony says, and then touches two fingers to Steve’s forehead, smoothing out his eyebrows. “And it’s supposed to be fun, too.” He smiles. Steve lets out a huff of laughter.
The man nods. “Enjoy your beer,” he says, and Steve watches as he walks back inside, only to blush when the man looks back at him and catches him staring.
Tony wants to argue, right this moment. But how can he? It’s awful that they can be so alike. The only reason he keeps his mouth shut is because he knows that Tony’s used that argument before. Maybe this is growth, to know when to back down from a fight. Or to avoid one totally.
“I thought of myself as someone who could do anything, could save anyone, because I was strong, and brave, and smart. And then, one day, none of that mattered, none of that was true. I wasn’t strong enough, or brave enough, or smart enough to save the one person in the world who was with me through it all, before I was the man people talked up enough to become a myth.”
They sink into a comfortable silence, waiting for the doctor to arrive. Steve’s itching to go, though—to tell Tony about Bucky, because if anyone would be able to help him, Tony seems like the best option.
He bristles at the pregnant silence, understands it for what it is: Tony expecting an apology, too. Steve takes a sip of coffee, stalling. He didn’t do anything wrong, he rationalizes. He didn’t hurt anyone, he just got drunk and took a nap. And what has Tony done, anyway? They’re nowhere close to finding Bucky, and if Steve is being honest, finding Bucky would fix everything—Steve’s thoughts stop when Tony shifts and the cold air seeps into the space between them. Steve sighs.
Steve sighs, kicks off his slippers, and digs his toes into the sand as he looks out at the sea. He’s always loved beaches, loved the vast expanse of water, loved the way the sand got cold if you dug deep enough. He looks down at Tony when he hears the telltale fizz of a bottle being opened, and watches as Tony takes a long drink of beer.
Except, he’s the opposite of that. He opens his mouth readily when Tony kisses him, knows how to move his body, and seems to share Tony’s preternatural awareness of the camera. They move in sync, shifting their bodies to best show the camera their actions.
Steve tsks, even if he’s already pretty cross-faded from the drinks and the joint. Tony smirks in response.
Tony finds Steve sitting on the balcony, nursing a cup of coffee. Steve doesn’t acknowledge him, keeps his eyes on the skyline.
The shame doubles down on him, and Steve blinks, finally back in his skin, and his skin is crawling.
“Hey, Steve, buddy, come on,” The world is blurry. Everything is blurry. Steve’s eyelids are heavy, so he closes his eyes because he’s tired and everything is blurry.
Then, somehow, we lay down that way. We didn’t say anything to make it happen, simply followed and predicted each others’ movements as well as we did in the midst of the battle.
Rhodey slings an arm over Tony’s shoulders. “It’s not that, and you know it,” he says. “We’ve always got your back.”
There are some days when the team just gravitates toward each other, not really seeking to do anything other than bask in each other’s company.
“I don’t.” He looked up at me and smiled, simple and easy, as if we weren’t naked and he wasn’t about to blow me. “I’ve just wanted to for so long,” he said, kissing the inside of my thigh. “I can’t believe this is real. Can you?”
Tony hums, letting Steve know he’s thinking of his response. Steve appreciates the gesture immensely.
A slow smile spread over Tony’s lips, and he pulled out his phone to type out of a text. “Great. Wonderful. There’s this place I think you’ll love.”
saying that, that it’s never going to be enough, but the most we can do is what we’re doing and accept that... that.” Tony falters, laughs. “No, nevermind. I have no idea what I’m saying. I’m like, the least qualified person here to talk you out of self-hatred.”
like, made me hot all over and desperate to press his skin against mine. I was moaning throughout, unable to stop myself and not even wanting to—I moaned as he tugged on my hair to expose my neck, I moaned when I finally got my hands under his shirt, digging my nails into his skin, I moaned when he lifted my arms up above my head and held my wrists down with one hand.
“I shouldn’t have snapped,” Tony says, softly. Steve hums in response, a bit surprised at the sincerity in Tony’s voice. “I’m sorry,” Tony says, ducking his head.
He moves without thinking, out of Tony’s workshop, up to his room. He’s numb as he wraps his hands, walks to the gym. It’s like there’s a faint buzzing in his ears. It’s enough of a distraction to keep him occupied.
The bar had filled up and cleared out, but Steve and Tony had still managed to have bursts of conversation especially since Tony was bartending that night. Some customers had given them knowing looks, one regular even went on to jeer at Tony in spanish and wink at him, making Tony laugh and Steve flush all the way down his neck. He may not have known the words but the intent was clear.
. He briefly considers asking FRIDAY to print it all out, just so he can throw the sheaf of paper in front of Steve and demand:
I didn’t have to think hard of where to go; there were only so many places in the mansion that afforded privacy.
“Wait until you taste it, Cap,” Tony says, drinking from his again. Steve hefts his flask from one hand to another.
“Yeah, what a coincidence,” Steve says, even if it isn't. They all rotate on sets in the large warehouse, schedules crammed tight as shoots go on almost ‘round the clock. It’s cheaper that way, and it’s not like their audience keeps track or comments on it.
“No,” he says, quietly. Natasha stands to his side, and Steve can tell she wants to examine it for herself, too.
, or the time that he and Tony had sat down and gone through (in excruciating detail) their story for the couple’s retreat counselors who would be interviewing them separately for admission. It was an exhausting conversation, but Steve had broken down their main agreements succinctly. On the margins of the page were his notes:
It takes a few seconds of Tony getting his bearings before he looks at Steve, and Steve is momentarily struck by how handsome Tony is, this up close.
Steve presses his nose against the base of Tony’s skull, breathes in the scent of him. He lets himself fall into the halfway space between awake and asleep, until above them, the alarm blares.
So instead, Steve says, “Oh, sure. Don’t fall into bodies of water, Steve, but I’ll go right ahead and remove my life-preserving tech.”
Shame was burning in my belly, but the question lifted my spirits somewhat. Still, I knew I couldn’t stay; inexplicably, I felt like getting back at him for walking away. I felt like I needed to keep some of my dignity despite the fact that I’d almost kissed him, just then.
“If this is okay, then I’d hate to see what bad is,” Steve says, smiling a little. He hands Tony a paper towel, and Tony blows his nose noisily. “Wanna talk about it?”
Beside him, Natasha stretches out like a cat and yawns. “That was fun,” she says, untangling her legs from under her and getting up gracefully. “Good night, nerds.”
Steve takes out a book from his bag, tries and fails to focus on it as the man comes back to check on him periodically. Steve feels a little hysterical, doesn’t want to think it means anything, maybe they’re just trained to provide great service.
He remembers when Steve first leant it to him, months into their relationship. They’d gone out for a walk, and despite Tony’s own jacket he was shivering. The leaves had turned gold and red, and the breeze brought the reminder that winter was on its way.
“Okay, and then kinda, rock on the balls of your feet,” Tony says, and does it himself, demonstrating. Steve nods a bit jerkily, reminding himself not to stare. Steve tiptoes, and copies Tony’s movement. “There you go,” Tony says softly, a touch of pride in his voice.
“Hi boys,” Natasha drawls, completely nonchalant as she lifts herself up to sit on the table beside Steve. Thor, meanwhile, disregards them as he digs through a cupboards, looking for food.
He may not have had an answer in mind, but a laugh certainly wasn’t what he’d expected. Tony’s shaking with laughter, his eyebrows up in surprise. “Of course I want you!” Tony exclaims, hands gripping Steve’s shoulders.
Steve finishes these ruminations and begins inking in the sketch. He erases the pencil away carefully, and realizes that the lightness in his chest is hope. It’s a strange feeling, but not an unwelcome one.
Steve feels the sharp stab of want in his belly, and he wishes he’d had the same resolve all those nights ago when Tony had pulled away. He wishes he’d told Tony he wouldn’t take no for an answer, and kept kissing him, and kissing him, and kissing him.
“Doesn’t mean I have to like it,” Tony says, and leans down for a kiss. “But since you keep asking,” Tony trails off, raising a finger to his chin.
“Don’t,” Tony says, so Steve doesn’t, mostly surprised by the gesture and the tingle of electricity that races up his arm.
“Anyway it’s a lot. But like I said, we’re here, whatever you need. I sincerely have no idea how I’d be dealing with this if it were, I don’t know, Rhodey or something. Like what the hell. Really. Okay so the point has run away from me.”
