“Hey, Steve. Nah, not that hungry.”
"Yes, sir."
Steve obliged, growling and moaning deeply with pleasure as he went faster, fucking him hard and so harshly that Stark’s toes were lifting off the ground with each thrust, shooting shivers and sparks of pleasure through Tony. Stark was gripping the counter for dear life, face scrunched in focus and desire. Steve let out quick, passionate groans that came from somewhere deep in his throat and Tony drank that shit up like he needed it to breathe.
“Take a ride…with Captain America…on his motorcycle? Pft, who wouldn’t want that?!” He ran upstairs so fast Steve wondered if he’d hurt himself. “Hell yeah!”
“Hm?” Steve turned around, heading back toward Tony and raising an eyebrow.
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony, pulling their bodies flush and saying a gravelly, “Okay.”
Cap blinked and then nodded, “Yeah.” As Tony sat up, Cap pulled his own pants and underwear down more, watching with attention as Tony opened the little condom wrapper. Tony gently slid the thing down Steve’s length until it was secure.
Looking at Tony, Peter decided to answer the door to just get it all over with. Besides! He’d really missed Steve. He’d began to think of him like an uncle…as weird as it was that he was even able to think of Captain America like an uncle after once trying to beat him with webs in Berlin.
“Oh, yes! What is it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay?”
“Are you tired?” Steve lightly asked, voice so deep and close to his ear it made him get goosebumps.
“It’s fine, I’ll do it. I like that one about the Bohemians,” Thor mumbled, leaning down into their cooling box to pull out a few peach-colored sodas. “Cool?”
Tony was proud of his own six pack. Seven and eight were fighting with all the chocolatey non-protein shakes he kept sneaking on days he didn’t work out.
“No,” Cap enunciated with a particularly naughty butt squeeze, giving him a look, “I mean, I know how it’s done. I’d just like to know what you want. How you want this to happen,” Steve’s eyes were nothing but calm and hungry, cheeks were rosy.
Thor looked around, finding them and sliding them across the ship floor. Quill got one triangular cookie in his mouth before the healing tab knocked him out. His head hit the metal floor with a clunk and his mouth fell open. Thor came over, reaching down and gently hefting him up bridal style. He effortlessly carried him over to Quill’s bed, laying him down and then turning him on his side to see that yes, he was indeed shot in the ass.
Peter made a helpless noise and hid his face behind his drawing. It didn’t matter if he was almost 18 years old, he felt like a 13 year-old again getting caught typing "boobies" into Google.
“And?”
That noise that he’d heard escape Cap’s lips that night echoed in his brain and he straightened up. “Whatever, I need a shower. You leaving?”
“Shit, I’m getting old,” he yawned coming over and walking beside Steve.
“Yeah, everyone knows that’s my name.” There was a pause where Cap licked his lips and then stared down at the floor, taking a small breath and letting those long, lovely eyelashes brush his cheeks with every blink.
“Hey, Tony…”
“It will be. So, lunch? I’m thinking chili since it’s chilly outside,” Tony stepped off of the pedestal he’d been standing on as the suit faded back into an arc reactor hooked up to a few different wires and detectors.
“It’s going good. I think it really helps the guys.”
Still gripping Tony’s waist, Steve took a step back and looked down at him. When Tony finally got up the oomph to look Steve in the eyes, he realized it was a big mistake. The other man was watching him so calmly and sweetly, face more handsome and angular in the dim shadows of the jazzy dancefloor. “Tony?”
Tony sat watching Peter talk with other Peter (Star-Lord), and told Steve, “I raised a real-good kid.” Even if someone else did the dirty work.
“I picked up some during the war. Kind of had to.”
“Friday, call the place, tell ‘em it’s three instead of two.”
She barely opened her eyes, seeing Quill sitting at the planning table and holding his chin. Their ship was dim, and aside from the mechanics of everything running while the ship went autopilot, it was quiet. He was turned away from her mostly, and he had his elbow on the table. This wasn’t exactly new, but it had been a very long time since she’d seen him so sad. The man never really cried full-on tears and snot, but he’d get this glossy-eyed look when he thought no one was watching. The moment she’d decided to get up, she heard Thor’s massive footsteps coming downstairs.
Peter followed behind after them and hopped into the backseat of Tony’s dark red Nissan GT-R before Steve could even think about a seat.
“So, first thing’s first. Dinner. Then a show. There is a Cirque du Soleil show in town, and those are literally the only kind of shows I like. It’ll be great. Even if the ones in Vegas are better.”
A few weeks and no new leads later, Tony was frustrated. There was no feeling quite like knowing that all the money and manpower in the world hadn’t brought him any closer to figuring out who’d tried to hurt his boy. He spent many mornings just staring into his cup of coffee until it got cold, thinking about what it was he was missing. This “morning” wasn’t much different, except this time, Cap came and sat next to him.
He’d never given any thought to the fact Steve could like men. He’d been crushing on the blond even when he resented him.
“Mr. Rogers left the room at about 10 PM, Sir. He hasn’t been back since.”
“Awh, Tony! You know I’m a good driver!”
Damn his life was weird now.
He tried calling and texting Steve, but the other man didn’t answer.
“Yeah?”
“Alright, c’mon I’m hungry and I can’t go over 110 with you in the car in good conscience.”
“Hi, yourself,” she whispered at him—she looked cute with all her hair stuffed in that hat—and made a hand signal. He nodded and both of them moved, going one after the other into the room ahead. There were crates stacked everywhere, and men all over the place. The men saw them the moment they got in, and immediately they broke formation and began shooting. Bucky watched Nat take cover behind a create just as a bullet hit the corner of it, exploding white powder everywhere. She started coughing and he just full-on body slammed a guy nearby. He ducked and rolled and fired back at the bozos who were calling more goons into the room. A guy got too close to him and so he ran towards him, dodging the idiot’s cheap machine gun and punching him so hard in the chest he knocked two other guys into some crates. The wood of the crates broke and out came bags of white powder, tumbling down like little bean bags.
With one small thrust, Steve gently slid all the way inside Tony until the skin of their groins were flush. Tony arched against the other man’s body and gasped, because oh god it was so much better than his fingers. His girth felt huge and perfect inside of him, and he was more than big enough to stimulate Tony’s prostate in that way that drove him nuts. Cap had also gasped and turned his head away—giving Tony a perfect angle to kiss and bite his ear. Steve pulled his hips back and then slowly thrusted in again. Tony moaned, open mouthed against Cap’s ear. Cap only thrusted slow a few more times before he began an even slew of thrusts, deep breathy grunts and sighs leaving his lips.
“Well my day was great. Woke up about four hours ago, fixed my hair, took a shower, the works.” Hmm, this wasn’t working. He needed to turn up the charm, get Steve comfortable. “Lesson three, make the questions personal. You really want to know the person. Ask questions you actually care about the answer to, y’know if you want more than a one-night stand.”
Bucky nodded, “All bad things, I promise.” Wrapping his arms around her shoulders he pulled her in to kiss the top of her head. Nat closed her eyes and cuddled up close to the brunet, pulling a blanket over her waist and sighing. He smelled her hair for a moment.
“My suit? Which one? Can I see it?” Tony laughed as he ate the last appetizer on the platter. Before he knew it, they were having a good time. Their conversation turned more personal, and before long Tony had learned Steve grew up poor, won an award for art when he was younger, his dad died when he was young, and he helped his mom during The Great Depression by painting signs and window advertisements. He told Steve all about his rebellious younger days, about the real Jarvis, his time in college, and about his first robots. It didn’t take long for them to finish all the courses and dessert. It was after he made Steve laugh particularly hard that he realized they were done with their meal.
“You’ll grow to like it.”
They both laughed, and Cap chuckled, “Honestly? I try not to. Luckily, it’s not like you have that problem, huh? War Machine…who is that again?”
The hostess gave them menus, took their drink orders, and left them in peace. She didn’t seem very phased to see Captain America and Iron Man.
“Does he know you know?”
Nebula shut her eyes.
Peter watched Tony leave his room and hopped up to follow. Sometimes when he saw one of the few Lego sets he’d kept on his shelf, and they’d remind him of everything he didn’t like to think about. Peter didn’t like to think about how long he waited in an empty house, foolishly hoping May would come home as he ate whatever he could find in the pantries, playing alone with Legos and watching old DVDs. Finally, he’d broke down and frantically called Happy, crying so hard that by the time Happy got there he’d thrown up three times and had been passed out for who-knows-how-long. This whole life felt like a dream, but it wasn’t always a nightmare.
“Gonna take it with you right? It’s collecting dust here, a real tragedy.”
Tony leaned forward, eyes trailing up and down the lines before he frowned and nodded in an approving fashion. “Pretty good, kid. To date this is possibly the best excuse to watch porn I’ve ever seen. God, I am just beaming. You are going to be so valuable in this economy. A fresh mind with fresh ideas.”
“They started shooting at us first,” Thor said, pointing to Nebula with his axe. Nebula wondered if the only reason Thor even came along was to make sure Quill didn’t die, seeing as how he almost always did if there were more than five guys shooting at them. “They got greedy! It wasn’t our fault this time!”
“Crime novels. They’re fun. I like to guess the ending. What about you? What are your hobbies?”
She took it and ate it in a much more dignified fashion, nodding her head too. She did love this song, even after the 100
The wind rushed by so hard and fast he couldn’t hear anything except Happy shouting. He looked down and saw part of the cabin twirling slowly, spewing debris, liquid and smoke. Peter couldn’t see anyone falling, and knew in the pit of his stomach that their stewardess who was in the back half of the plane was gone. Karen confirmed no life was left in the back.
“It’s done. You forget I can literally shoot taser rounds from my fingers,” Stark said. “I finished up about five minutes ago, been enjoying the view ever since.” By that he of course meant standing on a roof and lovingly watching Cap work, zooming in on those justice-clad cheeks with JARVIS.
Steve’s shook his head once, tensely. “Probably never. I’m not…I mean, I like women too.”
Thor laughed, “Whatever,” and turned on the radio.
Tony looked at him and sighed. “You’re fired.”
An Avenger stood in front of his office’s misty window, watching as sleet softly spat at the glass. Steve Rogers had one hand wrapped around a steamy cup of coffee, and the other was fiddling with some keys in his pocket. It had been a long week. Well, it was always a long week these days.
“So this will be the last shipment?” Nebula said, taking tentative drinks of the lemonade Tony had given her.
Tony looked up at him, “Not really. Saw Thor.”
Bucky made his way up to the kitchen in the Avenger’s penthouse on the top floor. It was the floor above the conference and residential rooms. It was his favorite floor because there had been many good memories here. He, Cap, and Nat would all watch movies together. He was sure it was even more of a sacred place to Steve, who he’d often find just sitting on the couch alone with only his phone on. It was also the floor with the espresso machine and today he was in the mood for a fancy coffee.
When he sauntered on into the kitchen for some pick-me-up, he was surprised to find Steve making blueberry pancakes. His favorite. Hmm. He smirked as he watched the big guy flip them.
“Sir? Mr. Rogers and Peter are almost home.”
“Yeah, a little bit.”
“So Peter, I’ve got a present for you,” Steve announced. Tony knew what it was, and he’d protested, but let it happen.
“Good evening, Quill.”
His muscles were burning and it was about time to call it quits anyway. Popping up he grabbed a towel and wiped the sweat off his face. He made his way to the living room and moved a curtain with a finger. He watched as Steve rode up with Peter’s arms wrapped around his waist. They both got off and thankfully it seemed Cap had convinced the kid to wear a helmet. The two were laughing and Peter was gesturing wildly with his hands about something.
Steve chuckled apologetically and sat on the sofa too.
“He left this morning looking pretty annoyed. It was pretty funny actually,” Bucky said, scratching the back of his head underneath his own messy half-bun and sauntering on up. He needed a haircut real bad. “Gonna go see what that was about.” He leaned down, kissing the top of her head and petting her temple with a thumb. She looked up at him and their eyes lingered on each other. “I love this,” he squeezed her bun.
“How’d you think I’d look with his mustache?” Tony asked, looking up at Cap.
“Send him down,” Tony said, legs trapped in armor. On his upper body he sported a beat up grey shirt with an old album cover design from Van Halen. He was running some tests on this new nanotech and was (not so) patiently awaiting a new delivery of krykor so he could start working on a suit for Peter. Kyrkor was probably the coolest element he’d ever gotten his hands on. And now that he had full access to vibranium from Cap’s friends in Wakanda? Oh, yeah, he was back in business baby. No space-level threat was going to hurt him or his kid. He’d never be exposed on an alien planet again. Not with this tech. He vaguely felt like the suit he was making was actually overpowered since it was mostly made of cosmic metals and elements.
“What’s a jammer?” Tony asked, having a vague idea of what they were.
“Friday, where’s Rogers?”
“Not for me,” Tony grabbed Steve’s face and made him look at him again. The other man’s eyes were full of want, but the knit of his eyebrows betrayed him—it almost gave Cap a look of desperation or hesitance, Tony wasn’t sure. “Unless it is for you?”
“Bucky?” Nat said, feet propped up on her desk. She looked a little less miserable than normal and she was sipping a diet soda. Bucky was in a chair in front of her, helping her look over notes and cases. The pair had began to tackle Avengers business together, it felt kind of like he was the Maria Hill in this situation, but he didn’t really mind. He thought that lady was badass, even if he’d never gotten the chance to meet her.
fuckin’ language,” Tony said. Then he squeezed Cap’s ass, because Jesus what an ass. He slapped it once in passing, and he stared at it all the time, but his? Oh god, it was glorious. He continued to squeeze and knead Cap’s bottom, eventually just giving it a few gratuitous pats. Tony was actually struggling with the realization of what’s just happened between them…but seeing as how there was visible evidence staining Cap’s poor shirt, it was sinking in pretty fast. Cap was such a considerate lover it seemed, and even though Tony was pretty sure Steve was overwhelmed and dazed for most of this, he could tell the other man had been trying to respond to his noises. He was a great already at understanding what felt good, what was comfortable, and had already found ways to tweak things in order to drive Tony wild, just from watching and listening. This was good for a first time. Much better than his own.
Tony grabbed a massive bowl of snacks, escaping to the elevator. “Can’t chat, got a super important Skype call. See you guys for lunch, come hungry,” he said not telling them that the call was actually to Peter.
“What color are you going to make it?”
“I think that’s the most you’ve talked to me in months.” Steve was beaming at him.
“I’m so glad Tony,” Steve said, all husky and genuine. Tony could feel Steve was actually completely hard again. God, effing super soldiers. It’d be a little while before he could get it up again, but a good deed needed a reward after all. He pulled away, biting Steve’s chin and then reaching between them to palm him.
Steve nodded evenly, not looking ashamed, just slightly sheepish. “I know.”
“Remember what I said about—are you looking at porn?” Tony grinned and his eyebrows practically flew into his hairline in something that looked kind of like joy.
With a hesitant feather-like grip, Steve reached and drew Tony’s member from its confines, a feat made somewhat difficult due to Tony’s love of tight name brand underwear. The moment he sprang free, Cap stopped kissing him for a moment to just look down between them. Tony wondered what he was thinking as he slowly picked up pace, pumping all the way from Steve’s balls to the head. Cap’s eyes fluttered closed and he bit his lip as his back arched a little, his own fingers squeezing around Tony’s member. Tony could feel that Cap wasn’t exactly experienced at this action, but it still felt great, the man was a fast learner after all. Tony wasn’t holding back how the touches made him feel, either. Steve’s hand slowly cupped his balls and then massaged them with his thumb in a way that had Tony reeling, and groaning. He thrust his hips gently against Steve’s hand, and gripped the comforter in a fist. Steve kept doing just that, and it was so good, Tony was more or less just absently working Cap’s member in time with those delicious movements. Cap’s moans were softer than he thought they’d be, almost shy at the moment.
“What’s up Cap? Oof—” Peter hugged him and then threw himself on the sofa. “Hey, Pete.”
“You’re ridiculous.”
“Need anything?”
“Oh fuck spank me again Steve, oh, yay,” Tony begged, groaning against the cold surface of the bar.
Bucky tilted his head a bit, coming in and leaning against his best friend’s dresser. “Do you want him to?”
It's one of my favorite songs in the whole world. Give it a listen if you'd like.
He rubbed up and down Tony’s front, sneaking his hands up Tony’s shirt and rubbing his pecks. Tony’s weren’t as impressive, but he was damn proud of his chest, and Cap seemed to like it all the same. Steve’s hands kneaded and played with his chest, then worked their way down his body, undoing his pants. There was something so kinky and wrong-right about this whole thing Tony felt lightheaded from all that blood rushing straight to his dick again. Oh, man.
Above him, he saw Cap reach out an arm and grip the low headboard. Tony wrapped his legs tighter around Cap’s body, forcing Steve to just grind for a moment, causing them both to gasp from how good the friction was for their stimulated bodies. The grinding descended into hard, rapid thrusts and harsh panting. Both of them were gasping, moaning, and desperately moving against each other. Their kisses were wet and sloppy, and they were just suddenly not close enough. Abandoning kissing altogether, Steve buried his face into Tony’s shoulder, pounding into Tony so roughly that Tony was already seeing stars. He was so close, he wanted it. Tony reached between them and began to pump himself, gasping Steve’s name as he came hard all over his hand and Steve’s stomach. His orgasm was just so abrupt and good that he wanted to ride it out and kept moving against him. Steve slapped into Tony quickly, and then buried himself deep, grinding into his ass as he came with a loud gasp-like moan. He kept grinding, hips twitching with each spurt of his release. Even though Tony couldn’t feel the come inside him, he knew it must have been a lot by the way Steve kept thrusting into him and milking his orgasm.
“…Hey, Cap.”
“Just wondering if Nat had any company. Wanted to let you know about that incident in St. Louis. It’s all good.”
“You know what I’m about to ask you.”
He wrapped his arms around her, and after pulling out, hoisted her up easily and carried her over to the captain’s chair where he proceeded to make out with her most of the trip home.
“Nothing. Just glad to be here. It didn’t stop snowing the whole drive down. You should see how high the snow is outside, it’s more snow than I’ve seen in ages. Thought I might have to stay in a hotel, pushed on anyway. What’s up with you? This looks interesting.”
Both of them just lay there softly moving against each other until Steve pulled back and kissed Tony gently, one hand going up and down his thigh.
It was then that Tony reached the peak of his impatience. He pulled back and sat up, clearing his throat and sighing at the warm weight beneath him. Steve’s hands were on Tony’s legs, and he was looking up at him with his chest heaving evenly. Tony smirked, pleased that it seemed like the super-soldier was so excited his body was making him out of breath.
If nothing was wrong…why was he here? To patch up things? That would be such a relief. Maybe, it was okay to be a little shit-starter if it was for a good cause.
Steve shook his head, “And if I had needed it?”
Tony grabbed Steve’s hand, playing with his fingers for a moment before gently guiding it to his stomach, “Give me a hand, Cap?”
Eventually, Tony screeched his the car all the way into the inner city. He slowed down and then took a turn down a street that led to a rather inconspicuous-looking parking garage at the base of a huge hotel. It was a gorgeous building, and this parking area was reserved for celebrities and rich people like him. He used to come here a lot. Still did alone sometimes.
“You seem pretty excited to be going to Georgia tomorrow. Anything new going on? Tony making you something?”
“Oh, hey dude! What’s up?” he turned and she heard the gross sound of him wiping his nose on his sleeve. “Hungry? I was ah just about to make some ornams. With sauce,” Quill boinked his eyebrows a few times.
Steve looked at him, and like a switch turned on inside of him his face broke into a huge smile that lit up his eyes. “I’d love that,” he said, taking Tony’s arm and leading him to the dance floor. He turned to Tony and didn’t move at first. But then he grabbed him by the waist and took his hand, instantly leading him in a classically jazzy-ballroom like fashion. Tony’s life as a rich kid had prepared him for this kind of dancing by leaps and bounds. What his rich kid life hadn’t prepared him for was the feeling of Steve’s hand on his back and the warmth of their joined hands. With the first twist of their dance, Steve literally stole his breath away. He felt embarrassed and aroused. This was all of a sudden very real.
When the machine beeped, Quill took out the bowl and then held it up for Thor to pour the sauce on. As Thor did that, Quill ripped open a package of bacon-strip like meat pieces and sprinkled them on too. When they both had their hands over the bowl, their hands brushed.
Maybe…maybe he was feeling just a little gay right now. Like, just a tiny bit gay for Thor, but a lot of guys were gay for Thor. He’s heard even genderless asexual aliens were kinda gay for Thor. He was feeling a lot of things.
“Uh, hi Captain Rogers!” Peter said, staring up at
“So you’re not a 100 year-old virgin?”
“We uh,” Star-Lord said, audibly swallowing, “Need some music. I forgot to put on some music.”
what his happy ass was doing.
“I’ll see you in the morning?” Steve asked, voice more gravely than usual.
“I know,” he agreed. He was still in full combat gear, fingers laced across his waist just watching her do her thing. “What drug do you think that was? I don’t feel much right now.”
“We’re going to find out who did this, Tony,” Nat said.
“What?” That didn’t make any damn sense.
Peter laughed and nodded. “The coolest, always.”
He saw Steve from the side, pinning another man against a door and kissing him deeply. The pair were as quiet as they could be, bodies pressed close and mouths open and hot for each other. The guy had his hands in Steve’s hair and on his ass, and Steve had his arms wrapped around the bigger guy’s waist. They were kissing so passionately and wetly, the very sight shot straight to Tony’s groin before he could do anything about it. His heart slammed itself against his ribcage and he stopped breathing for a good few seconds.
“Dangerous. But profitable,” Nebula said, watching Quill flick a piece of something into Thor’s beard. He had good aim.
The blond’s face was stony. “Don’t really want to.”
They all entered a jump point and came out in a district much farther away. The communication receiver on the Benatar beeped loudly, instantly alerting them to an incoming message.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist, pulling their sides together and chuckling.
Tony, Steve, Happy, Rhodey, Nat, and Bucky were all standing in the crowd, shouting and clapping for Peter. Today was his graduation day. Peter had graduated, his boy had finally gotten his Master’s degree, and Tony couldn’t have been more proud. He certainly didn’t have tears in his eyes—no way—and he certainly wasn’t squeezing the life out of Cap’s hand through most of the ceremony. After the rest of the names, the speech, and the cheering, the Avengers, who were already in the back of the crowd in the stadium, made their escape quickly. Once the ceremony was over and Peter had gotten done talking to what very few friends he’d made, he found them all waiting for him in the parking lot.
Sam just laughed at him and Cap was smiling. Tony felt sorry for Cap, it sucked not being able to get drunk. Guess he cried like a baby about it, using his huge manly super-serum muscles to wipe away the tears. Asshole. Tony smirked to himself.
“Then take me downstairs,” Stark said leaning up, almost in a challenging way.
“Well, when you two are done bad mouthing me, maybe you’d like to eat dinner? I made it all by myself.”
Steve should’ve been surprised or something, but he was really just grateful. He was pretty certain this was going well. Hopping in the car, there was a small silence before he opened his mouth to speak and then double-chinned as his head was forced back into his headrest by Tony gunning it out of the driveway. He’d wished he could say he missed Tony’s driving.
“That’s the Captain’s job? Oh, then I say we go. Aye Quill?” Thor leaned back looking over his shoulder at Star-Lord in a mock-serious fashion.
“None of your business, pal,” Steve smirked, shoving his friend. Bucky shoved him back until soon they were wrestling like boys, in their socks, in the kitchen.
Tony looked up at him, rolling his jaw and nodding. The idea of not being alone in his bed that night sounded just fantastic suddenly. “Yeah. Only if you don’t mind having 12% of the bed.”
“Happy!” Peter ran up to the big man and gave him a hug and then a double thumbs up. “How was I? To cliché? I think it went great!” He threw up his arms, walking over and flopping back on one of the private jet’s comfortable couches. “And they didn’t ask me a single question I didn’t know the answer to. Yes!”
“Nope, no, it really isn’t. You wanna do this thing or what? When the snow stops shitting on us, we can drive to the airport.”
“What the hell were you doing down there?”
The pair were walking in the door, both of them laughing so adorably it made Tony feel many things at once. It had been a long time since he’d seen Steve laugh like that with his sweet eyes and easy smile. He could go from bad-ass to precious so quick it was infuriating.
“It was incredible. Thank you,” he turned to Tony and grasped his shoulder before sitting down and excitedly staring at the stage like he wanted intermission to end right that second. When the show started up again and then finally ended, Steve’s clap was loud and he whistled. Tony watched him clap and grin, feeling a smile on his own face. He felt happy he could show him something so new and interesting. As the two men walked side by side out of the theatre, they talked about their favorite parts.
One of Thor’s friends? Out of all the people in the galaxy, the person who could help her loneliness was a friend of Thor’s? She dearly hoped the woman was much different than him, or else she might actually go mad.
Steve shot him a look, which died into a pleasant one when a server poured them their expensive wine. He reached out and took a sip. “This is a really nice wine, Tony.” Tony watched Steve’s eyes look around the room, surveying it all. Tony was so caught up with the way that Steve’s suit fit him like a freaking glove, he barely registered when he was speaking. “Okay, what do you do for a living?
Steve turned to him with a shadowy look that only lasted half a second. “Why would you ask me that?”
Cap boinked his eyebrows once, “Well we did, though. But, hey, how about a breakfast date?” Cap gave him a plate of pancakes and sat next to him, watching him with those soft eyes.
clouded with surprise may haunt his every waking wet-dream but sure.
Tony grinned as he took a turn so sharp it made Steve grab onto the oh-shit bar out of habit. He chuckled once evilly, glancing over his shoulder at the somewhat tense look on Cap’s face.
“In a few months. In May.”
He heard Steve make a quiet noise somewhere between a moan and a sigh. The sound was so small and god damn beautiful he took a step back saying, “What the fuck,” mostly against will.
“Steve,” he panted against his lips, breaking their kiss and kiss-biting his way down Steve’s jaw. Steve let Tony suck and bite at the warmest, softest part of his neck, rubbing Tony’s sides. “I want to show you something new.”
“Yeah.”
Bucky looked up and then snorted. “Oh hell yeah. Go for it.” The two shared a smile and then a comfortable silence resumed between them as they idly tapped on their computers. It was broken only by Friday telling them Steve Rogers had returned to the compound.
“Cool,” Quill responded, clapping his hands once and then pointing at nothing. “I’m gonna like, take another tab and go to bed I think. I got pretty hurt today so…have fun watching the Death Star get blown up.”
Tony kissed Steve for a while, melting into it and stroking their tongues. When he parted, he did so with a loud noise, and then licked the mess from his own lips. Cap had chased his mouth, laying a peck on his cheek when he realized through lust Tony was walking away. Stark hurried over to a table and grabbed a bottle of lube he always stored there (he could care less who knew he kept lube and condoms around like candy). Steve’s lovely blues watched him eagerly.
“Oh my god, you look just like Tony Stark.” A woman in a graphic tee and black leather pants said to him. “That’s freaking rad.”
Tony blinked. That tight-wearing son of a bitch.
“When did this happen?”
Steve did stop, blinking once and taking a steady breath. This conversation made him feel like he was fighting some sort of battle, it was just so personally important to him. He knew from the moment he’d hopped in his car that he was going to do more than just check on the man. He wanted him back in his life and hadn’t realized that he’d needed a push.
“Hello, I’m Peter Quill, people call me Star-Lord,” he said, standing taller than usual and resisting the urge to deepen his voice. “Captain of that ship.”
“I said, let me show you what a real date is like,” Tony’s heart was about to fall out of his ass which was unfortunate because he was also pulling this whole crazy idea out of his ass. “You’ve never had one, so I can show you how fun it is. Teach you a few things.”
They got in an elevator and went to one of the residential floors. The residential floors had huge common areas and kitchens, and then there were hallways that led to each Avenger’s personal tiny apartment. Tony had his own room in the basement lab where he worked on projects since his money paid for everything.
“That’s good.” Tony looked up at Steve and pointed at him with his spoon. “Guess what? The kid’s graduating this year. In May. I have to tell someone about this though—check it—he and I had an in-depth discussion a few months back about how one day in the future we’re gonna have 7 billion people on the planet again right? Well he convinced me to let him work on a concept for a new branch of Stark Industries. So I gave him some time, and do you know what he did?”
Tony gripped the edge of the bar, shouting in pleasure as Cap eased most of his member into the tight heat of his body in one long, slow thrust. He’d barely heard Rogers release that beast from its confines, he was actually impressed. He did wince because Cap was a big boy both long and wide, but it wasn’t anything Tony couldn’t take. He threw his head back and moaned Steve’s name long and airy as the other man grabbed him by the hips and thrusted until they were pelvis to pelvis. He held him there for a minute, and Tony loved it, just enjoying how full and alive Steve’s dick made him feel. He was so big his prostate was sending pleasure tingles through him without him barely moving at all, but that didn’t stop him from shimmying his hips backward onto Steve’s member greedily.
“To Peter’s graduation. He thinks you’re neat.”
Steve laughed quietly, it was such a rare and cute noise, it made Tony laugh too. “Language,” Cap mumbled blissfully against Tony’s lips with the hint of a smirk. Tony full on slapped Cap’s ass.
“No! I mean, it’s just, it looks like that but it’s not—”
“That’s a great freaking idea!” Peter snatched up the papers and disappeared.
The other man’s eyes were laser focused on him and he stopped chewing. “Tony, you really don’t have to do that. I just haven’t been looking. It’s fine.”
“So this is the part where I leave, and we tell our friends through text how dreamy the other was,” Tony said, suddenly realizing that Cap had moved him so far back he was only inches from being against the wall, caged by the other’s bigger body.
This man had to be new here. He'd never seen him before. After all, he’d lived around this area most of his life.
The other man nodded, “Wouldn’t miss it for the world. How’s he handling all this?”
All of them looked at Tony.
Steve smiled at him in that genuine way where he just looked so proud of him it made him feel like he needed to hide. “That’s amazing Tony.” And the bastard was so genuine, he knew he meant it with all of his heart.
“You’ve earned it.”
enough, “Fuck me, Steve, what’s taking you so—shit!”
Thor’s eyes were wide and had more shine in them than they’d had in weeks, “Someone who was supposed to be dead.”
“Yeah, I know that. It’s courteous.”
Tony was completely prepared and swallowed what he could down, shocked as hell that it kept coming, but actually enjoying having so much of it on his tongue. He pulled is lips away, leaning back trying to wipe away some that had spilled out of the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand. When he met Steve’s face the other man looked like a cross between shocked and extremely aroused. Yeah, he got that.
“What are we going to do about it?” Tony reached out and wrapped his arms around Cap’s neck, pulling him closer. The heavy armored shoulders of the uniform didn’t bother him in the least, in fact, they turned him on. He leaned forward and softly bit Cap’s chin with the tips of his teeth, inwardly smirking when he heard the man making a low, “Mm…” sound. His Stevie was so easy to fluster. He kissed his way from his chin up to his mouth, pulling his body closer to the other man’s.
He suddenly couldn’t breathe and took a big breath through his nose, pulling his head back and looking up at Steve with astonished brown eyes. His breath had now picked up and he was just panting into the space between them, watching Steve watch him. He felt hot all over and everywhere he felt Steve’s fingers, there was a sort of jolt that went straight to his groin.
Thor nodded, looking thankful somewhere through his glazed expression.
"Why the hell did you let me make decisions in that state anyway? You should know better! Really, Jarvis, I expected more of you." Tony pushed off the wall of the dock, no longer able to see blondie's muscles bouncing as he'd stopped to pick up his board. He shook his bag again feeling only a little sorry for himself. "I'll see you Tuesday. I'm busy. Why'd you call me again?"
Tony hugged him, kissing his head and clapping him on the back. Peter was grinning ear-to-ear. Steve even grabbed Peter, hugging him and ruffling his hair. He got hugs from every Avenger, who all congratulated him. Tony watched from afar as that dough ball Peter Quill ran through the parking lot and grabbing Parker from behind, giving him a massive bearhug, shouting, “Yeah, man!” Peter was laughing, even as Thor nearly slapped the air out of him, giving him a congratulatory pat on the back.
“What’re you looking at Winghead?”
“I’m just not certain this is typical date driving,” Cap said, noticing that the speedometer was over a hundred.
“It’s my pleasure. I’ve got a thousand more lessons I could teach you, but you know, you’re a natural Cap.” Tony looked up at him and brought his hands back to himself. “The teacher has become the taught,” Tony laughed breathlessly, stepping away and anxiously going to retrieve his jacket.
Steve nodded, “Go for it.” He was watching Peter absently, but his mind was stuck on how Tony’s shirt rode up last night so far he could see his underwear and the hair line that disappeared beneath the hem of them. Steve was pulled from his thoughts whenever Peter clapped his wrists together after putting on two things that looked like fitness watches. From them came a suit that trailed up his arms quietly, going all the way from his wrists and hands to his feet. Finally, the suit melted up around his head, forming the typical spider-eyes he was used to seeing. This suit was black and red, with a few hints of white. It was very impressive. He moved around a little bit and then the suit began disappearing to his wrists and back.
How long had he been standing there?
Tony jumped, having been staring intently at his phone as a distraction. He looked over to where he knew Cap’s eyes were even though his face was framed only with the soft hallway lighting.
Rogers ran a hand through his own hair, his other hand was still firmly on Tony’s waist. “I just,” he breathed.
“Prouder! And Aunt May, she would have loved this. I can’t believe it…I’m actually gonna help so many people…” Peter’s eyes were wide and he just took a deep breath. “When I can’t stand anymore business meetings, I can still be Spider-Man. The world still needs Spider-Man…”
“You speak French?”
Soon something changed and it all became very frantic. Cap was pounding fast into Tony’s body, making him arch and tremble. Steve was using so much power he was actually moving Tony farther up the bed with every thrust. Eventually, Tony’s head hit the headboard, or else he wouldn’t have even noticed. His head made a soft noise that alerted Cap, who reached down and kissed the chuckle from Tony’s lips.
There was radio silence from Tony, which was on purpose, because he knew it’d make Cap anxious on his behalf. Messing with Spangles was one of Tony’s favorite past times, even in times of crisis. He saw the other man with his hand up to his earpiece. His iconic shield was on one arm and god he was the picture of sickening patriotism. Oh well, patriotism had made Stark a shitload of money. Now, he slept better at night knowing he wasn’t making weapons for the army anymore, but even after Stark Industries had gone full tech, his company was still seen as a hallmark brand of the USA. He didn’t necessarily like being the government’s lapdog, but at least he could cry himself to sleep on a bed of congressman’s money. The thought made him smirk as he walked toward the edge of a building. Steve couldn’t see him, so his dramatic entrance would be particularly legendary this time.
Steve was looking down at him like a big handsome man on Christmas, and his grip was firm but sweet. His feet moved with ease, a few beats ahead of the music sometimes from his enthusiasm. Tony’s heart pounded, and whenever Steve turned them too quickly it made him laugh. He didn’t even care he’d swiftly been put in the woman’s position.
In reality, Tony
She shrugged, “I don’t know. I breathed some of it, but it wasn’t enough to do anything. Why, trying to get high, Barnes? You’re too old for that, it’ll give you a heart attack.”
“Chop-chop kiddo, what are you even doing right now?”
Tony squeezed Steve’s leg, then stood up and dinged on a glass, “Hey! Shut up!” he called. Everyone did settle down, except the Peters who had a case of the giggles.
Peter was so ecstatic to be Stark’s actual adopted son. He just wished it would have happened under very different circumstances. He’d trade everything in the world to get his family, his friends, his anything back. Still, the best part of this new, strange life was having a father figure that cared about him so much. No, a father. In his mind, Stark had become his father. He didn’t replace the father he’d already had, but in his mind he had two, and that was okay.
Steve sipped his wine, looking thoughtful. “I try to help people.”
The doors dinged and it made him jump. Shit, he needed to escape. How in the hell would he ever sleep with the feeling of Cap’s strong hands on his waist? The feeling of his hot, perfect lips against his, and Jesus fuck the smell and feel of him. He had been exhausted when he got into the building and now he felt like he needed to run four miles. Maybe he would…He stepped back into the elevator and went to go work off the sudden adrenaline rush, hoping he could work through all these feelings.
“Sure thing, Mr. Rogers.”
“You learn anything?”
A few days later Bucky and Nat stood together watching Steve get into one of Tony’s nicest two-seater cars. Tony had flown in but always had some sort of fancy car waiting at the airport. Steve was in a nice dark navy suit that had a matching dark navy shirt, with no tie. It was a casual sort of formal that Nat told Bucky really suited him. As the car sped off, Nat turned to Bucky and said, “Y’know, it’s kind of weird.”
“Huh! Learn something new every day. I know lots of phrases in a lot of languages. Most of them would probably hurt your 1940s sensibilities.”
Tony shot him a look, somehow Steve being all dad-ly was turning him on.
“Hey Friday, when Tony wakes up tell ‘im I took Peter out.”
Steve looked up and him while chewing and shook his head, the pink of his tongue coming out to clean his lips. “No, never. I’ve gone out with Bucky a few times when we were younger with some girls, but it wasn’t like what you said. It was more like a double date with a gal who Bucky set me up with. Poor thing escaped the first chance she got. Almost took a girl out for coffee before she turned out to be a secret agent, you remember Sharon. She was nice. I really liked her.”
At some point, Tony came up. He had an energy drink in one hand, and a phone in the other. He came up to find all of them eating and laughing while some show played on the massive curved TV up here.
“Do you want a hug?” Tony offered in a way that was half-sincere and half-sarcastic.
Steve groaned but he was smirking.
Tony grabbed one of Cap’s pecks kneading the thick muscle for a moment before going lower, and actually palming the bigger man between them. The action made Cap gasp, and he grabbed Tony’s leg, roughly rubbing the softest part of the back of his upper thigh.
“Well yeah, who the hell makes garlic bread and doesn’t put cheese on it?” Nat rolled her eyes and then gestured for them to follow her as she got up and took the blanket with her. Steve hopped up and followed her. Bucky watched them go, following behind slowly.
“Wanna see me put it on?”
He scooted backward until he was off the bed, and then went over to his nightstand, pulling out a few things. As he approached, he just took off his pants and underwear, crawling right back to where he’d been. Tony leaned his upper half on Steve’s but kept his bottom up, kissing the surprised and cutely aroused expression right off of Rogers’ face.
“What did you just say?” he said, rushing over to the receiver and reading the message himself. He immediately stormed over to the captain’s chair, put in some coordinates, and they blasted off without much warning.
“Thank you,” he said, smirking at the surprised puppy look Cap got at being man-handled all of a sudden. He wouldn’t mind spending a few more minutes in bed if it meant he got draw more of those addictive noises from Cap’s body.
“Y’know what, never mind I don’t want to know.” He really didn’t. Jealousy boiled up inside of him and he was actually surprised at himself about how intense he was starting to feel.
Why in the hell was Steve at an event like that? Maybe he just wanted free beer. Maybe he was bored? There was trouble afoot? Someone forgot to say, “Please,” or “Thank you?”
“Hey did you tell Bucky about this?” Cap leaned the shield against the legs of his chair.
“Yeah, I’m tired. Don’t care to drive right now. Besides, there’s one last very important part of a date I haven’t gotten to teach you about.”
“I’ll get it,” she said, already knowing it was going to turn into a game of nose-ghost that ended in shouting.
“Tony? What’s going on up there?”
“And you love me.”
“I’ll tell you when it works.”
Tony was going to skip town before everyone woke up, but you bet your ass he was going to stay now. “Oh yeah. I’ll order breakfast for everyone. Ever had yakitori first thing in the morning? It’s fantastic.”
“A suit? For what?”
“What, really?" Steve was surprised. "Are you heading there now or later?”
“I’m Steve, nice to meet you,” Steve said, grasping Tony’s hand and giving him three hardy shakes. Steve's hands were warm, even after taking a dip in the cool beach-water. The two held on for a moment longer than necessary, their eyes locking. After, their hands unclasped and Steve nodded, shrugging and muttering, “I guess I’ll uh, get out of your hair.”
Tony always brushed his teeth first thing in the morning and was wearing comfortable jeans and a fitted cashmere sweater. He wasn’t self-conscious at all (he seldom was), but this date gave him that ridiculous embarrassed flutter that he honestly thought he was getting too old to ever feel again, making him want to check his already clean breath or shirt.
“Yeah.” Tony noticed Steve’s nipples through that thin shirt, since they were way more noticeable right now than usual. He couldn’t resist the temptation and lifted up the material, kissing one of his pecks, licking a nipple. Steve’s hand came to the back of his neck and he played with the fine hairs.
“So when were you guys gonna tell me you were seeing each other?” Peter said, seriously. Both Steve and Tony were now awake and sitting on the end of the bed.
“Sing with me, Nebula! C’mon! Someday, love will find you! Break those, chains that bind you—” Quill held his arms out to her, drawing his elbows in and doing the most ridiculous manly shimmy the blue woman had ever seen. He grabbed her by her wrist anyway and pulled her from her favorite chair. “One night! Will remind you—” Quill was headbanging and pulling her elbows in time with the beat. She frowned but moved with him, enjoying his energy far more than she would have ever admitted. He was obnoxious, but she loved him anyway…perhaps in the way a cat loved a dog it was forced to live with.
Bucky came over and squeezed Steve’s shoulder. Something was definitely bothering Steve very deeply. Bucky wondered if it was fear of rejection like what Bucky had put Steve through. Or if it was because of Howard. He knew Steve and Howard had had a short sort of thing and it ended somewhat badly because Howard was a playboy. Still, the man treated him well after and before whatever it was that they had—something he still never fully told Bucky about—and then he’d fallen hard for Peggy Carter, like real love. There was that something with Sharon. And he knew Steve had flirted around or messed around with other people, but the man didn’t ever talk about his love life.
Nat stuffed the last remnants of a sandwich in her mouth. She had her two-toned hair pulled up into a messy bun. Bucky loved it when she wore it like that.
logo appeared behind Peter, who was standing on a stage in front of almost 10,000 people. Some were fans, some were reporters, but a great many of them were investors and shareholders from some of the biggest companies in the world. There were a few sign language translators on stage with him, translating in American English and British English. Other than them, he was alone with thousands of eyes on him. It used to terrify him, but now he got a sort of excitement out of it all. His adrenaline kicked up and he felt alert and ready…It was easier when he was actually talking about something he cared for.
“Kiddo!”
“Sif!” Thor bellowed, running toward a woman and picking her up like a doll, twirling her around and squeezing the life out of her. She was laughing loudly, slapping him on the back and calling him funny names. Thor was beside himself with joy, shouting, jumping, and cursing.
Steve nodded to himself even though Rhodey couldn’t see him, “That’s great. I’m glad you let me know.”
Steve cleared his throat, licking his lips and asking a soft, “I do?”
“Is Tony here?”
“Tony,” he said, voice sultry and different than the one he was used to giving them all orders.
“Yes! Asgardians, things to sell,” Thor slapped Tony’s shoulder so hard he nearly knocked the man over and then waddled his way out of the cabin. Peter watched them go, but before he left he turned to Tony and rapidly began pulling something bright out of his pants pocket.
The thought brought back a swell of emotions the man desperately tried to ignore. Bucky felt horrible that he didn’t love Steve the way the other man so desperately wanted him to. They didn’t talk about it. They had kissed once long ago when Steve was still cute and small, and it was nice. But for Bucky, it wasn’t what he wanted for them—it was too weird. He still thought of Steve like a brother. It was magic for Steve who was so broken when Bucky eventually admitted he didn’t feel the same, that it had made the other man wish beyond all reason that he really was gay, just for Stevie. But he couldn’t. He just didn’t feel the same and couldn’t force it. And Steve being Steve, well, he didn’t let it ruin them. They were stronger than that.
“Say Peter, why don’t I take you to get something to eat? Wanna take a ride on my motorcycle?” Steve smiled warmly. Peter nodded.
Steve nodded, “Okay.” Then the pair took a short drive to a concert hall. Tony could tell by the look on Steve’s face the entire time that the man was floored and completely amazed. The music was powerful, the dancers were elegant and beautiful, and the moves were complex and artistic. Tony wondered if this sort of thing was right up Steve’s alley. Every now and then he’d glance over and Steve’s mouth would be open. It made him feel good to know that he was absolutely positive this thing was blowing his mind. If he was a poor kid from Brooklyn who only knew war and the occasional corny showtune and dance, there was a huge chance he’d never gotten to experience something like this. It was moving stuff. Tony was not impressed as usual, even though he thought it was pretty. But the moment intermission happened Steve stood up immediately and clapped loudly and hard. It looked like he was even breathing deeply.
The party devolved into watching Peter’s favorite movie, massacring the graduation cake, singing karaoke for those brave enough. Mostly they all sat as Quill, Peter, and Thor made asses of themselves. It was a lot of fun, and a really good day when they’d had so many long ones as of late. Soon everyone but Steve, Peter, and Quill turned in. Nebula said her goodbyes and went to go sulk on the ship, having her fill of contact. Thor was asleep in an armchair, snoring with crumbs on his chest and beard.
“Rhodey wanted to know how you were doing. I realized I did too. It’s fine that you’re not answering anyone’s calls. Something’s going on, I get it.” Steve really didn’t expect Peter to be home, but he thought it explained some of the behavior Nat and Rhodey saw as worrying. Tony could ignore people when he was having a good time or working hard, and without Pepper to remind him that other people exist…
“Tony Stark doesn’t do instructional, we both know that,” Bucky narrowed his eyes suspiciously. Surely Steve wasn’t that naïve.
The air between them was so funky now, but not in a bad way. Tony now realized it was because he was under the flirty stare of a big, huge, sexy man who also happened to be one of the most fundamentally good people on Earth. “I’m leaving right now actually.”
“Oh, hey you two. Am I interrupting something?” Nat said, something like a smile on her face as she sat on the couch in between Steve and Bucky. She leaned on Bucky, and then put one of her legs in Steve’s lap. He patted her shins and left his hand there, cocking his head a little and chuckling at her.
Nebula nodded, dangerously rasping, “Not at all.” There was something very murdery about her eyes that made Tony desperately wish he could have seen it all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve huffed. “Everything could be.”
Steve turned them so Tony’s bottom was pushed against the table, and Tony’s mind only vaguely mused that they were making out like horny teenagers. He pressed the full-length of his torso against Steve’s. The air was hot and Tony was suddenly desperate, kissing like he was on some sort of time limit.
They were going to actually go to a restaurant—a fancy one—together for the first time since August. Peter had caught a flight home that past weekend and had decided to stay a few extra days since if he wasn’t around Tony, he was super lonely (he was pretty sure Tony was pretty lonely too). It was too painful for him to think about everyone in his life that wasn’t there but being around Tony made him feel so much better. He’d wanted to go to a school here in Georgia, but Tony forced him to go to the best school he could think of, his alma mater: MIT, i.e. the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was hard, but he was already in a pre-master’s program. Ever since Mr. Stark had began to really show him the ropes of what it took to be the owner of a corporation—although Tony barely managed his own company anymore—and Iron man, he’d really began applying himself. He was so proud to learn that with the proper motivation he was really capable of absorbing everything.
“It’s not porn!”
He found Steve on the residential floor, heading to his room and holding a garment bag. The other man was walking pretty quickly.
Thank you for reading this far!
Honestly it wasn’t a hard decision. Tony wanted to blow Cap’s mind. For his first time, he knew what he wanted to do. Some part of him wanted to let Steve know
“How did you get him to agree to this Steve?!” Peter asked, practically vibrating from excitement.
“That’s great, me too. We have so much in common. Next you’re gonna tell me you’re an Avenger.”
It wasn’t long before Tony had kissed Steve all the way to the bed. Steve pulled Tony to straddle him as he sat on the side of the bed, hands roaming all over Iron Man’s back. The brunet was nearly dizzy by how hot this all was, smiling as he kissed Rogers deeper. He let himself sink until his knees were caging Steve’s legs and firmly on the bed.
“Anyone in mind?”
“White.”
“Yeah, last lesson. It’s the most important step of the whole date actually.”
He held up the stack of papers and proceeded to tell them all about it.
Steve just looked at him. Tony thought it was cute, he looked either overwhelmed or excited…he also looked damn serious at the same time. It was hard to tell with this guy.
“Oh you know, the usual,” Steve was smirking at him. “How about a walk around the park for our second date?”
Cap tilted his head back and moaned somewhere high in his vocal range, expression so pleasured it made Tony want to slap him for being so damn adorable. He reached up with one hand and grabbed the back of Steve’s head kissing him wetly as he ground their lower halves together. A noise escaped him too, god it just felt so good. They were both so hard he was certain it felt just as good for Cap. Vaguely, he wondered how far Steve had gotten with anyone else, but ultimately decided it didn’t matter. He reached between them and undid his own zipper, pulling his pants down to his thighs. Not breaking their lips apart at all, he reached down and undid Steve’s pants with one hand too, shoving his hand inside the warmth and palming him through his underwear. Steve held onto him, moaning between them and lightly moving into Tony’s hand. Tony got the lustiest butterflies he’d ever had as he continued to palm him, his own bottom being grabbed by Steve. The blond’s fingers rubbed and clenched his ass, until he seemingly got brave enough to just full on palm him back.
Steve rose an eyebrow. “Nothing beats a good diner burger.”
"To remind you of your appointment tomorrow and today."
No way. Who caved first? “You’re shitting me.”
“Say it all you want. Are we gonna see Captain America at the next Pride parade?”
If you don’t mind them together…please continue on.
“Well,
Even at this time of night, the first floor was playing music, there were people everywhere yelling and talking, someone shot a streamer popper a little too close to him, and he was pretty sure he saw an underage kid shot-gunning a beer. The sheer amount of decorations honestly made him feel like he was tripping on something.
Tony blinked, looking at the other man’s large, strong hand and nodded. “Yeah, ditto.” Once the warmth of Cap’s hand and blue-eyed gaze was gone, he felt like he could breathe again. It should be illegal for humans to go around looking and acting as sweet as that 1940s d-hole.
Thor was asleep in his chest, possibly dead, and he was snoring. Quill kept getting distracted by nothing at all, and Nebula was like talking to a (very deadly) wall sometimes. Jesus, how had these three not killed each other yet? He’d never admit it was nice to see them, even Thor. Well it wasn’t pleasing to the eye to see him, but it was good to know he was at least somewhat alive.
Cap blinked. “I’m not lady.”
Especially how much he was enjoying life right now. He had his best friend back and Nat. There was really nothing else in the entire world Bucky had ever wanted. Whether or not he felt like he deserved how happy his life was didn’t matter.
These are two songs very dear to my heart. I hope you enjoy them.
Cap stopped walking and then just turned with an expression looking half genuinely offended and half humored. Peter ran ahead yelling something that sounded like, “Not sorry!” And Tony actually just started laughing. He was laughing in that somewhat high-pitched way that melted Cap’s heart. He missed him so much. He found himself laughing too, besides himself. Mr. Parker’s gotten some nerve, he liked it.
He escaped in probably the most un-cool way he’d ever escaped a situation and took a tab, hoping it would knock him out until the morning, possibly forever, or at least until his face stopped burning.
“Let me take you somewhere. Let’s get a cab.”
avoiding them, but only because he was finally taking some phone calls he’d been putting off. He was in the middle of a serious discussion with a company that was helping him make more drones when he saw Cap come out of the elevator with a burger and a glass of iced tea.
It was very quiet as Tony tilted his head and made a face, shrugging his shoulders at Cap. The other man was watching him carefully, and then shook his head, a huff coming through his nose. “You’re unbelievable.”
Hold the phone.
"Cancel it, cancel the shit out of it. No meetings."
He squeezed Tony’s ass, tentatively, and then with a stronger grip. He ran his big hands all the way from his clothed buttcheeks down the back of his thighs, where he squeezed some more. Tony loved it and showed him so by making his way back up and kissing him open-mouthed. Steve tilted his head and gently kissed him with tongue, stroking their tongues together in a way that had Tony moaning softly. The moan made Steve make a breathless sound, one that Tony didn’t think a man like him should even capable of.
Tony blinked, “Yeah, I think so.”  He looked at Steve who just nodded.
“Will you come out here for a second.”
What the actual fuck. Oh god. He was dating Steve Rogers. He’d kissed him. Jesus, the world really had ended, the 100 year-old virgin made the first move. They’d practically made out there for a second, he didn’t know how to handle this like an adult.
“Well, thank you for the advice. I have a life, a good one.”
Tony blinked. “Alright then why not?” They walked down the street, and Cap hailed a cab. Once they were in, Steve told the driver to go to an address Tony wasn’t familiar with. Once they got inside, it seemed to be a sort of lounge that catered to jazzy music and it had a huge dancefloor where some couples and individuals were dancing to a medium-paced song played by a live band. It was a happening and swanky place, Tony actually kind of liked it.
“Watch it and see, if you give a little more than you’re asking for,” and in a funny high pitched voice, “Your love will turn the key, ah ahh ah ahhh…” he happily nodded his head, moving his arms with the beat. He continued to hum the tune until he was full-on singing it, not even caring wherever the heck Thor went, this was one of his most favorites. His mama and him would sing it together when she was making breakfast sometimes. The song just genuinely made him very happy.
A lot of events in this fic are based off of a story my friend Silver_Centurion and made together.
“I know,” Steve said, looking up at him with the tiniest tingle of something. It left Bucky stunned. Did Steve know what he was doing? He didn’t know whether he was happy for him or concerned.
He watched Nat prattle on to Steve, more joy in her eyes than he’d seen in months. She was beautiful, radiant, and the best thing to happen to him other than Steve Rogers. For the first year after the Snap he’d spent a lot of time out of the country helping the Avengers that were left deal with the aftermath of the Snap. It was only a few years after that that Steve was somehow able to convince him to stay in the United States. He had been a real pain in Natasha’s ass. Their relationship was purely accidental. It had all started when he caught her ballet dancing in the firing range. The very memory made him smile.
Iron Man stared at him for a good long minute and then shook his head once, looking at a stunned Peter.
“A lot of kids aren’t being forced to go to school until they’re ready, but Mr. Parker here’s got himself a future business to run, so I put my proverbial foot down.”
As he sat down in a loose pair of jeans and a black tank to work on his new armor, he caught sight of Peter’s Mark 2 armor charging house (Peter’s Mark 1 had exploded). His eyes softened. Peter. The one and only reason he probably hadn’t drowned himself in alcohol by now. After some time working, Tony’s stomach growled. The more he aged the harder it was to ignore it.
Tony was surprised Thor had enough brain cells left to form a four-syllable word. “He sure is.”
“Been thinking about our dance,” Steve said, smiling into the words. “Let’s do it again sometime.”
“Mhm,” he said. Tony sat right between Cap’s legs, with his back pressed against Steve’s chest. It was warm and comfortable.
“What do you like to do when you’re not making things?” Cap looked up at him.
“Gotcha.”
“Ah—oh,” Tony breathed, sliding his hand up to Rogers’ stomach and then slipping his fingers beneath the hem of his underwear. He pulled Steve free, grabbing the length of him in his hand and then looking down between them. How was he even surprised that Steve’s cock was so pretty and uncut? Of course it was. The model cock for the world’s most gorgeous super-soldier, as if he needed to be anymore attractive. It was large and nicely sized for such a large man, and Tony just wanted to kiss it. But he didn’t want to stop kissing Steve’s lips, no way. He gave him a slow pump, relishing the thick warm weight in his hand. Steve immediately moaned, moving against his fingers and then squeezing Tony in return.
“So you come here just to give him a death wish or what?”
the hardness of their cocks together in the most intimate way his body would let him.
“Guys?!” he shouted in a cute high-pitched tone. Gross! It was like watching his two older brothers make-out. This was a huge surprise and honestly, he would never have guessed Quill was even a little gay with how much he talked about girls. Unless he was bi? He was happy for them and all but what was it with people not telling him things?! First Dad…now Quill…with
“Don’t like McDonald’s.”
Steve had his arms crossed and was sitting in a chair watching Peter explain things that were far beyond his paygrade. He reminded him so much of Tony it was kind of scary. But his humor was more wholesome and he wasn’t nearly as self-destructive. Tony was actually asleep upstairs. Ever since their dinner a few months back, he’d made it a point to visit Tony (and sometimes Peter when he was home) at least twice a month.
“Tony…” Cap stood in disbelief, coming over and taking the shield on his arm like he had a million times before. He tested its weight, and then broke out in a huge smile, his eyes so sincere it made Tony feel a way.
"Sir, I just wanted to warn you that you still have an appointment for later this evening."
“I heard you, I’m…” a heavy breath, “I’ll do it. I’ll drive down there. Gimme a few days,” he’d need the time in the car to go over his thoughts. Tony’s cabin was less than 1,000 miles away, the drive would be good for him. It’d be sort of like a mini vacation.
“So, we’re doing this now--mph—” his words were quickly cut off by lips on his. There was no hesitation, just a warm, strong kiss and Cap’s arms tightening around his waist. The man pulled him closer until they where stomach to stomach, tilting his head and blowing Tony’s mind. How in the fuck was he such a good kisser? Tony kissed back, shock and arousal pounding through his body, “Oh fuck,” he breathed, completely breathless against Caps lips. It was so good, and god how he wanted it to continue. Cap pulled away, a soft wet noise sounding when he brought their mouths apart.
“Yeah? And…?” Bucky was in a black shirt that had its sleeves all the way rolled up like some sort of greaser. Ever since Nat made a comment about his biceps, he can’t help but show them off for her. It made him love his own body a little more.
Steve’s fist gripped his hair and he suddenly released, throwing his head back, body tensing. He made a loud noise, that descended into sort of moan hum as Tony continued to milk him. Steve mumbled, “Sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get it in your mouth,” through his panting.
“Yeah, probably.”
“Nat, I’m in the East door. Any movement?” Bucky whispered into his earpiece, squatting in a dark hallway behind a shelf. This place was a fucking mess. They were currently in what was supposed to be in an abandoned building in central Africa investigating a claim of alien tech distributors. Ever since the Chitauri invasion and the Battle of Wakanda, there were all kinds of dangerous alien weapons floating on the black market. Half of the time, the people that had them had them en masse and knew how to use them. They had a few agents working for the Avengers that could handle these sorts of missions, but Bucky had convinced Nat she needed to get out of HQ a little bit. She hadn’t left the compound in over six months, and he thought it was about time his girl got some action. Was it a mistake to go on a mission together? Probably, but he liked watching her work. It turned him on.
“Yeah? Alright super-soldier, leave me then.”
“Okay!”
“Mr. Stark, we have a visitor. Steve Rogers has just gotten out of his car.”
The other guy leaned away from the wall, looking at Tony too with a look that seemed more pissed off than anything else.
“Hey, man,” Quill said, setting the box down on the porch. It was a bright sunny day at the cabin. Tony sometimes wondered if the spaceman missed Earth, even if the star guy had told him that being on Earth made him uncomfortable. By the slightly-hung over irritated look Quill was giving the sun, he guessed probably not even a little at the moment.
“In three days. He’s picking me up from here.” Cap made a noise to himself and then sat down, shaking his head.
“I’d like to try it,” Steve said, just breathing softly and looking as gorgeous as ever on his bed. Oh, yay.
“If Stark felt anything toward me he would have told me or shown me by now. If you haven’t noticed, he’s just like his dad…as much as he hates it.”
On the way home, Tony let Steve choose the radio station. Of course, he chose an oldies channel. Luckily, oldies these days consisted more of 70s songs than old showtunes. Steve tended to find the 70s stuff more palatable it seemed. Tony drove slower now that it was late and lightly sleeting. Every now and then he’d glance over, just to find Cap staring out the window all thoughtful-like. Tonight was really not what he was expecting. It seemed like it had turned into a real date, and Tony wasn’t even mad about it. It was nice. Unexpected, but nice.
Thor was sitting in the captain’s chair, hand messing with his beard, eyes hard and set on the viewing window.
The adorable look of delight on Cap’s face was absolutely worth the burn in his own cheeks.
Sam threw his arms up. “Oh! Oh! Aight, that’s how it is?”
Tony sat up with insane hair smelling like beer and bad choices. The sound of the TV was so loud all of a sudden. He scrambled for the remote, squinting in the dark at the keys before he finally just turned the TV off.
The last thing Tony remembered seeing before he blacked the hell out was an actually really gorgeous red and peach sunset from their high hotel window…and maybe the sound of a Febreze add playing on the crappy TV.
“It’s a tick. Okay, y’know what, since you’re not used to all this and I am, I’ll tone it down for you. Real kosher stuff, no yacht. Mostly. Besides, I’ve always wanted to see you in a fitted suit.”
One of the aliens tackled him out of nowhere, teeth ripping into his shoulder. He shouted, immediately shooting the thing until stopped moving, but then two more were on him. Quill was dog-piled with three or four aliens, all trying to frantically punch, bite, or kick him. Just as he felt one’s teeth sink into his upper thigh, he heard the familiar woosh of a large object coming toward them. Stormbreaker burst through the huddle, and as Thor called it back, it sliced through them again. Thor ran to him, grabbing up the axe and slicing a few of their heads off. He reached down and hauled Quill up shouting, “I left you for sixty seconds, Quill!”
Nebula sighed, taking a deep breath and somehow finding the strength to keep going.
Here are the songs Quill's singing:
“Yeah, and you deserve one too. The ship’s already sunk, Captain, the only thing dragging you down is yourself.”
“Watch
Stark grabbed Steve’s face and brought his head up so he could kiss him open mouthed groaning, “Ohhh, shit, I’m not in the mood for foreplay babe.”
“Incoming call from General—”
“I love you,” he said, kissing her unhurt shoulder.
Just as he finished it, the song “I Just Want to Be Your Everything” began playing. He canted his hips to the beat, loving the intro and singing it under his breath. He started moving one foot, the music already making him feel better. He was singing the song to the holo screen which was paused on the intro to
Picturing Quill as this sad, chonky Andy Dwyer boy is giving me so much life right now...
“I didn’t teach him shit. Kid’s like a sponge.”
Looking relieved, Steve took a few steps closer. “Are we alright?”
“Why?”
“Literally—you’re already horrible at following instructions.”
Steve’s long eyelashes fluttered and he groaned, “Ah, oh yes, Tony…” before capturing the other man’s lips in a hard kiss. It became wet as Cap began nearly panting and gasping between them. Steve’s body loved sex, and he didn’t have to fight or run thirty miles to get hot and bothered. One of Tony’s favorite things about dating a super soldier was that the man was always ready to go. Ever since they’d started dating two years prior, Steve had become needy for Tony’s intimacy—not that Stark would ever complain, oh fuck no.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky tried to forget the day he told Steve how it was between him and Nat. He remembered the pure and genuine happiness in Steve’s voice. But Bucky had known him long enough to also notice the veiled guilt tugging at the blond’s face. Steve was his best friend, the two loved each other more than anything in the world.
Tony led Steve into the back of the building, and the inside had a gorgeous lobby that looked more like a modern palace or castle than a hotel. There was a beautifully chic restaurant face near the entrance of the hotel. It was one of the most expensive and best restaurants this side of New York, placed inside a hotel only the rich powerful could afford comfortably. It was pretentious, but Tony wanted to impress. He hoped Steve had the capacity to enjoy fancy meals.
“Told you I was the king of dates,” Tony grinned devilishly, however his body language was showing the opposite. Steve was intimidating in this arousing way that had him feeling embarrassed again.
“A piece of your what?” Steve leaned down and whispered into Stark’s ear, biting it. Stark’s chest fluttered a little and he nearly giggled.
The moment he was gone both Nat and Bucky turned to look at Cap in a way that was so comical it actually made Steve laugh, “Guys?”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers is here.”
Peter nodded. “Good enough!” He popped up and left the two alone to run off to some part of the house.
The two shared a look, and then Cap huffed and started eating some of the crispy little barbeque potato chips Bucky was so fond of.
Thor immediately grabbed Tony and gave him a massive smelly hug. Space was not treating him well. “Tony! My friend! How goes the ah, thing?” Great, now he needed a shower.
“We’re okay,” Happy said with wide eyes and a strangled voice.
Tony came back to him, shedding his shoes and socks as he did so. The moment he was close again, Steve grabbed him up and began kissing his neck. He turned and kiss-nibbled at what little of Steve’s endearing ears he could reach. Tony’s hands came up Steve’s body to play with the fine hairs at the base of his neck as he moaned under Steve’s kissing and sucking.
Tony suddenly felt guilty. Did Cap think he was mad or disappointed somehow?
say when we accept the mission.”
“Easy there, Rogers,” Tony said against Steve’s chin, which he took the liberty of softly biting with just the tips of his front and bottom teeth. When he pulled back to look at the other man it was clear Steve was sorry. The look on his face was pretty darn delightful, so he was forgiven. “It’s fine, keep it coming.”
This chapter is a gratuitous chapter I’ve written because I just can’t get enough of Bucky and Nat together. This chapter does not progress the main story significantly, but it does give you a window into their life with each other. If you are not comfortable with M/F intimacy scenes or just don't like Bucky and Nat together, you can go ahead and skip it.
As far as Bucky knew, poor Steve’s love affairs had always been short, brief and catastrophic. He wondered if Steve even knew what he really wanted or needed. Sharon was dusted, Peggy had passed, and Howard was long married and gone. He hoped Steve could find something real and good, too. He deserved it. It was only matters of the heart that Steve was ever uncertain about, it wasn’t like a battle. A tactical mind couldn’t really help a damaged heart that still belonged to a 95 pound rascal in a super-soldier’s body.
Quill meanwhile sighed, the healing tab working, making him feel all warm. Sometimes it made him feel like he was peeing. He checked, nope, not actual pee this time. “Well that sucked,” he groaned, smooshing and rubbing his face with a hand. His hair was messy—but still cut the way he usually had it. He was just laying pathetically on his side, noticing a box of cookies under the briefing table from this angle.
“Damn. I’ll get better. You know I’m taking this as a challenge, right?” Stark chuckled before he gasped, alerting the Captain in his arms. “Oh my god, I forgot about Nat.”
“Morning Steve, smells good,” Tony plopped down and stole a few blueberries from the batter bowl. “Bad news Cap. Park date’s canceled.”
“Yeah, Nat?”
“I may not be an original Avenger but at least my hair’s not gray, old man!”
Steve sighed but looked relieved, reporting what Tony had said to others in his radio. Stark walked closer, glancing around casually.
God it felt good to talk to Tony. Even if he was more or less talking at him.
“Hey Cap, where are you?”
Cap shut his eyes and sighed. “Not you too. You guys really need to stop worrying about me.”
He turned to find Steve watching him, that tiny curl of a smirk.
“We’re trying to be. I know this is a big news for you, and I didn’t want you to find out this way. I was going to tell you myself if Tony didn’t.”
Tony blinked and then made a hand gesture, just splurting out his thoughts. “When were you going to tell me you were gay?”
The next thirty minutes were filled mostly with Tony telling Cap all about what he and Peter had been up to—but mostly about what the kid was doing. Steve felt a fullness that he wasn’t quite sure how to describe, it really seemed like Tony genuinely loved Peter even more than he’d thought he did. It was such a new side of him. It was wonderful, seeing him like this.
Steve turned and kissed his ear, hands still feeling up his body. “Okay,” Steve agreed, seeming excited for it. Tony liked how even though Steve was a confident and open lover, sometimes he was shy and adorably eager. Tony had begun to wonder if that super-serum made him horny because of just how much Steve seemed to enjoy and initiate intimacy when given the chance. It made him eat everything in the freaking compound, and he had energy for days, so he thought it made sense.
Captain America himself. Every time he saw him he felt like he might poop his pants a little. Would that ever wear off?
Steve suddenly looked up at him like he was a bomb that had started ticking. “What?”
“Is it really?”
Thor laughed sloppily as he downed the beer. The man had some sort of pseudo dreads going on and ate more than Quill. She wasn’t quite for sure how she’d gotten roped into the world’s most testosterone-filled pity party. Both of them had gotten kind of fat, but at least Quill let her cut his hair. They were a mess, it was pretty sad. All of Thor’s friends had died too, and on an Earth-check-up mission, the Asgardians had basically given the guy to them, begging them to help him somehow.
“Nothing,” her voice whispered. He walked quietly heel-to-toe, peeking around corners and opening doors as silently as he was able. It was raining hard outside, and he could hear the massive raindrops pounding on the shabby metal roof above him. There were dim lights on throughout the whole structure, and he’d knocked a few guys out already. They were too armed for this place not to be suspicious. Distantly, he heard the sound of a gunshot, it sounded loud even though this building was massive. The sound was soon followed by shouting.
Cap sat in a chair nearby and set the food near him. Tony ate as he talked, eventually ending the call and stuffing his face. He hadn’t eaten in hours.
“Okay then! Fantastic. I’ll call you. Y’know a real date isn’t that different than just going out to dinner, but there is a finesse to it Cap. Something no super-soldier serum can prepare you for. In the meantime, we’re gonna go downstairs and watch that Lord of the Rings movie I’ve been telling you about. It’s great, it’s only about three hours long.” Tony was acting nonchalant but his heart was hammering and his mind was going a million miles an hour. “C’mon, icecream later.”
“Yeah, Cap?”
Cap laughed and then took a step forward. “This is the best date I’ve ever had.”
“Whoops, uh. Just came to make sure you were alright. You clearly are, yeah I’m gonna go upstairs.” Tony practically ran upstairs. Normally he’d have made a joke and handled that situation in a way that was completely hilarious and asshole-ish, but this time he couldn’t. Something about Cap’s expression and…his mind was a mess. Cap was gay? There were very few things that ever surprised Tony, and considering that Captain Freaking America carried around a picture of a chick he barely knew like some love-struck virgin for God-knows-how-long he just didn’t even know what to feel.
He groaned when she canted her hips forward and back, feeling like he was drowning in her tight, hot warmth. She took off her bra, with Bucky helping, and tossed it carelessly somewhere. Just as she began to cry out quietly and wonderfully, Friday loudly alerted them.
More easily this time Steve worked in a second finger until he was just thrusting two of them in and out of Tony’s ass so smoothly he wanted to whine about it. Steve’s fingers rubbed against his prostate with every little thrust, but he was a man who needed more than just fingers to really get him going, even though they felt amazing. Tony still made small sounds because it did feel nice. Steve was quiet, seeming focused. Steve must have either watched porn or done this to someone because he was widening and moving his fingers in a way that was suspiciously pleasing. With each small movement, Tony knew he was closer to having the thing he wanted most inside of him. He was grinding his hips against Steve’s urging him to pick up the pace.
They spent many days like this, just the three of them at home in the Avengers compound unless duty called (of course other staff still worked there too, but they were the only resident Avengers left on-call). It was a strange sort of bliss he couldn’t have properly explained to anyone. It was January 2023 and they’d all spent Christmas together like one big happy family. Even Tony had stopped by, somehow able to spend more than ten minutes in Bucky’s presence without making a rude comment. It seemed the Iron Man finally realized that even though his body killed his parents, his mind was just an observer locked in a meaty prison. Or, for the sake of the others, maybe Iron Man had just controlled himself. He still ignored Bucky for the most part, but he wasn’t trying to kill him anymore. No more stank eye for Steve either.
“Happy, Happy? Are you okay? Hey!” Peter held onto him, lightly getting the other man’s attention. “We’re okay! It’s okay!” Far in the distance the plane parts crashed into the ocean. Peter had flown hard and fast down toward the ground, so they were much faster than the free-falling plane.
