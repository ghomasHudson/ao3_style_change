“You worry about your drinking,” Sherlock said plainly, out of nowhere. “But you’re not an alcoholic.”
The noises upstairs went on for hours. Furniture moving, Sherlock walking at various paces, a vacuum cleaner, a blender. Ice cubes being poured into a plastic bucket. Violin tuning, followed by something short John recognised but did not know the name of, and he hummed along. A blast of pop music that was quickly turned down to nothing--Sherlock had been taken by surprise at its volume. The rattle of the pipes all through the house, for longer than it took to do washing up or to take a shower. The unmistakable smash of something glass hitting the floor, Sherlock shouting an unintelligible three-syllable curse, doors slamming.
“Cross my heart,” John promised, warmed over with love for her earnestness and her creativity, and the gentle way she set each animal and astronaut in place, just so, chatting away all the while. “Are we going to get dressed and maybe get out of here today, or are we having a pyjama day?” It was nearly ten and although Rosie could be relied upon never to sleep past seven even on a Sunday, they had taken their time about breakfast and John’s three cups of black tea, snuggled close on the sofa to watch two episodes of Rosie’s plastic-cat cartoon on her tablet, and then worked at their Animal Parade for the best part of an hour.
Sherlock scoffed and tossed his head a bit. “Course not. These women or their partners work in high tech; the thief is stealing work product, information, and files, then taking the shoes to divert attention. I’m still on the fence as to whether that was clever or ludicrous.”
“My shift ends at eleven.” He poured the tea into two cups, removed the strainers and covered them with a white linen napkin so as not to offend Sherlock’s eyes.
They drank and grimaced and swirled the smoky brown liquid around the heavy bases of their tumblers. John’s eyes closed, long enough to slowly draw breath then softly sigh it away. The soldier, home from the battle. Sherlock slid down to stretch his legs and his back, letting his shoulders slump comfortably. The junkie, in the bliss of the fix.
SH: There’s an important delineation between living quietly due to a wish for personal privacy, which is absolutely valid and respectable, and living in silence due to fear of harm. The existence of choice in the matter of how public to be with one’s personal life is incredibly important. People need room to choose. It’s perhaps, I hope, easier to choose to share one’s orientation when one can find evidence that it can be done literally anywhere, with anyone. If we can be queer hockey players and damn the fallout, then maybe someone who’s longed to speak up but worried for the repercussions can find a little inspiration.
Alex George had left a handful of pockets-emptied effluvia on the desk in the suite’s sitting room: key card, wallet, crumpled face tissue with blood stains apparent. Four dark blue Adderall, a pale blue Klonopin broken in half, and four round white pills each etched with a “10” on its reverse side. Sherlock wanted to laugh, or to scold him. No one should be so careless with their stash. Sherlock himself would never have left a single shattered sliver of even the tiniest rock of heroin, back when he’d been an addict. Nevermind that one could find oneself disastrously exposed by such wanton disregard for privacy; any fiend worth half a penny would have that pile of sweets pocketed and out the door in an eyeblink. A smirk bent up the corner of his mouth as he swept the pills into one palm with the edge of his other hand, clearing the table of Alex George’s crumbs.
“Not decided, but it seems like the sort of thing you think about when a birthday rolls around. You’re a week into the new year, as well.”
“The music of the season is one of its only redeeming features,” Sherlock informed him. “That, and. . .” He cleared his throat and rose to stand, crossing to find his pipe and matches, commencing to busy his hands with them.
Sherlock walked him out of the hotel suite, allowed himself to be fondled (shoulder, elbow, his hands for rather longer than seemed appropriate) and even to be kissed on the cheek, then shut the door and paused in the kitchenette, seeking hydration. The light from the sitting room barely spilled over the bar differentiating the two spaces, so it was the bulb inside the mini-fridge that put a spotlight on the spilled-out contents of George’s emptied pockets, in a heap on the countertop. Sherlock spun the cap off a bottle of cold lemon-lime soda and gulped down a few swallows, half-emptying the bottle, then belched.
John’s rhythm stuttered as he orgasmed, deep inside, and Sherlock went tumbling after, coming hot and wet all over his own heaving belly. Panting to catch his breath, still shivering through the finish, John couldn’t quite kiss him, but nudged and nuzzled at Sherlock’s temple and eyelids with his nose and cheek. Sherlock clenched his teeth and sucked in a satisfying gasp of cool, humid air, then melted and went utterly limp. The bedclothes were all rumpled chaos; some of the pillows had slid off onto the floor. John drew away and resettled onto his side, one heavy arm across Sherlock’s chest with a hand cupping his shoulder then sliding up his neck, dropping kisses here and there onto Sherlock’s face.
The government, the people who take children from bad parents.” John threw his arms out for emphasis. Sherlock felt as if he were breaking upward through a layer of ice, a breath of epiphany where only a moment before he’d been cold-drowning.
Sherlock’s eyes closed and his shoulders sank forward on a silent sigh. He wondered if George was really so oblivious to the fact Sherlock thought him a cad, and whether he worried the resident weirdy might speak a bit too plainly to the woman he endlessly cheated on. For no reason Sherlock could define, he put on a t-shirt, and then a small, closed-lipped grin, and went out into the sitting room to greet poor Mrs George.
Sherlock’s orgasm was protracted and thrumming, low-frequency waves of throbbing pleasure ebbing outward from his center, then softly rippling back in. He listened as John closely followed, sounding frustrated and elated at once, then murmuring his name in that happy-sleepy way he sometimes did, sounding as if he couldn’t believe his luck. Sherlock’s cheeks warmed once more to hear it.
Mrs Hudson won three bottles of decent champagne in a charity raffle. Just the sound of the popping cork made John feel green around the gills. Her voice in the entry hall calling, “Boys! I need you!” was like a needle in his ear drum that exited through the back of his neck. The smell of Sherlock’s freshly applied (usually really rather nice--distractingly nice) after shave as he passed John’s door forced him to swallow a sour throatful of upward-rushing bile.
Once in the room, Sherlock went straight to the bathroom, cleaned his teeth, then edge-sat against the sink to text John.
“It’s not outrageous for me to worry, just a bit. The veteran Brawlers have had years to get used to you; the rest of the league only got confirmation of the rumours a couple months ago.”
John was clearly out of sorts, and had been for most of the day. He was sullenly quiet through supper, sparing quick, forced smiles and monosyllabic responses when addressed, adding nothing of his own to the evening’s conversation. Plainly not his usual jovial self, Sherlock was not the only one to have noticed; Molly had even inquired about the state of his health. “Fit as ever, thank you,” was his simple response. Beneath the table, his knee jumped away any time it brushed against Sherlock’s, and he kept his feet flat on the floor lest the toe of his boot meet Sherlock’s ankle.
“It’s been a very long time since I’ve had any loved ones to whom I might give a present,” Sherlock said, an explanation rather than an ending to his original statement.
Sherlock found a purpose. He made moves to duck out and shout at someone to get Rosie’s line started so they could top her up and take her home.
“It still is,” Sherlock said, and turned his hand palm up on John’s thigh so they were clasping hands, fingers slotting together. He realised he was perspiring. “My one easy thing. And the most important.”
!) But when Sherlock Holmes’s people contact your people (note: “our people” are Mike and me; we are our own, only people), offering an exclusive interview with a pair of hockey hotties who happen to be hot for each other, you don’t say no. (Incoming gif from
Once they had cleaned up and dressed, with business-like distance and no conversation, Steven sat on the bed’s edge to put on his shoes while Sherlock buttoned his shirt cuffs.
dad,” Sherlock had never asserted himself as Rosie’s other parent, never claimed her.  Sherlock had changed the nappies and learned from online videos how to plait her hair, trained himself to check in with her needs—and meet them—at regular intervals, ran her ragged at the park when her seemingly endless energy needed draining, and sat long hours bored and exhausted on the edge of her sickbed. But he’d never really made her his. He had never even asked.
Afterward, they shared the bath, languid and laughing as the water overtopped the tub and ran down between the floor’s wood slats. John couldn’t stop touching the ring. Sherlock closed his eyes and rested his head on folded arms, admiring John from a new angle. It was good, and he was grateful.
,” he read. “Wanted to speak to me about it, ‘but’? But thought it would be easier to sneak it through the courts behind my back?”
“Could you not just have played the part yourself? You seem pretty clever. Maybe did a bit of drama at the all boys public school, eh? Juliet? Or maybe Cleopatra.”
. . .until he ran out of breath. There with his eyes shut and his skin warmed beneath the surface, he could have slipped straight into sleep.
The window. The armchair. Door shut and locked. His legs and arms and the bed beneath him and the ceiling of a tiny London flat over him.
“Anyway,” he said, in a lighter, decisive tone, “That’s enough death and depression for one afternoon, I think. Care to see if Mrs Hudson’s got any cake in?”
They aren’t engaged or anything. (Mike is mentally planning their wedding attire, despite this, just to be ready in case their relationship status updates)
Out in the room, there were clues to George’s before-bed ritual. On the desk, an empty vodka shot and the bottle of beer that had chased it, no longer empty as George had made do while the bathroom was occupied. His phone facedown on the bed beside him. Hood of his sweatshirt tight-strung around his face, to cover his eyes and block out the light. On his side table, a rip-stop nylon shaving bag, battered, overstuffed and unzipped. Sherlock purposely turned his face away from whatever contents might be visible as he reached across to shut off the lamp. Dropped his pants to his ankles and stepped out of them, slid between deliciously cold sheets, fell into sleep still waiting for warmth.
Sherlock had fallen asleep, and John studied his lightly parted lips and the dark lace of his lashes, the smooth, the soft curl of his fingers. Flicking his gaze from Sherlock’s soft face and his notebook of rough-textured paper, John sketched quickly to capture him before he changed. Every evening they spent together in Sherlock’s little room, John passed in acute awareness of the tick of every second. Stealing these last few minutes before he must slink away into the night, back to his own bed, was a calculated risk of inviting unwanted attention to their habit of late nights behind closed doors.
“I like to cast a wide net,” Sherlock said, with exaggerated casualness. “You really never know until you ask. Didn’t I tell you weeks ago you should invite your poet-friend for a threesome?”
John frowned, looked like he wanted to say the correct one of at least three different things. Sherlock knew he would get it wrong, so put him out of his misery before he spoke again.
—so it was unlikely he’d ever joined the dots between a single passing comment and a later, however significant, revelation.
warm,” Sherlock grumbled, inexplicably annoyed that John was expressing concern over him. He set his feet on the floor and slapped the remote down on the table where they’d been resting. In a single motion he rose and reached for the hem of his hoodie, peeling it up and off. Shaking his head to resettle his hair did give him a bit of twinge, a flaring shock across his forehead. “I have a headache.”
John’s appreciation of Sherlock, though, was never in doubt; he listened attentively to Sherlock’s lectures and his face became serious as he sipped, searching each mouthful for notes of cedar, or evaluating the coating on his tongue. One cabernet turned their teeth blue, but they all agreed to forgive it. Indeed, Sherlock thought it so exceptional he went back to the winery and bought three bottles to take back home.
John shook his head, even laughed a little. “Not exactly what I meant,” he assured. “Let’s just leave it at: I found something new to believe in.”
Sherlock wanted to trust it—John watching on television from the opposite coast—but John was hardly objective. Sherlock thought his hands might be shaking so he put his phone away without finishing their exchange, and yanked up the front of his sweater to pointlessly unfasten and refasten the plastic buckles of his chest protector.
“No trouble; I didn’t expect you to, as he’s undistinguished--never published, no flashy back-of-the-bus-bench adverts extolling his rhinoplasty techniques--and in his early seventies, so wouldn’t have been a member of your medical college cohort.”
Thank you for joining me this season; these have been a lot of fun to write and I have enjoyed reading all yr comments! Merry Christmas to all of you, and best wishes for a new year that brings you everything you wish for.
John didn’t look away from the window, but he could see Sherlock half-nod, in his peripheral vision. The cab turned in to Baker Street and in a few moments they were once again on the pavement, looking at a building John lived in, that didn’t feel like home.
It would be record time, but Sherlock felt it was worth a try. After all, he’d been coming up hot all night.
“Yes, well.” John cleared his throat and they shared a stare. John looked regretful; Sherlock dared him. “I’m going up for my phone, then I’ll go.”
“Absolutely not, I’ve a house to run.” Sherlock sat up straight and though he looked pale and not a little sweaty, he took up the lemonade and sipped.
Sherlock half-smiled--curse that, too--and nodded tersely. “Cooking is only science, and I’m a scientist.”
“The fuck—?” John caught himself, flashed a quick smile at the senior citizen at the front desk. “Science thing?” he asked, false casual.
There was the sound of Sherlock lifting his book from his table, smoothing his fingers down the page once he’d opened it. Then his low, sonorous voice–“I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind.”–and though John loved to hear him, and enjoyed the story, it was no time at all before he drifted, and then sank.
John wished he didn’t understand what Rosie was talking about, but he’d sat through enough online videos about the tiny plastic cats which were Year Two’s singular obsession to catch most of what she meant.
Sherlock felt boneless and blissful—of course, his man was a wonder—and after some awkward rearrangement, they found space to share the length of the sofa, eyes closed, John’s arm draped possessively around Sherlock’s waist. He was smiling. Sherlock wanted to sink into the sensation of weighty exhaustion, sleep away a few hours, wake up and fuck again, then eat, then fuck, then sleep, eat, fuck their way through the next three days. What was wanted and what was required were, tragically, so seldom one in the same. He rolled his head against the sofa’s arm, searching for a clock.
“A bit, yeah.” John’s shoulders were tense, and his headache showed in the creases around his eyes. He shrugged, not genuinely, but because it was expected. “Well.” He cleared his throat. “Just one of those things.”
“I might do, in your place,” John shrugged, but he was grinning. His forehead smoothed somewhat from its tight-knotted frown. “After a rainy weekend like we’ve just been through.”
As Rosie was asleep on the bed just a couple yards from the little dining table, John had his laptop’s brightness turned down as low as it could go, squinting through his cheaters to check for typos.  He sat back and let his focus soften, gazing into the dim as he worked out how to write the next bit in a way that was definitive without being unkind. It was a delicate situation—one he and Sherlock had not discussed in the intervening days—and which must be addressed before they spent time together. Better to get it set aside sooner than later, so they could enjoy the holiday with Rosie as their sole focus. No questions unanswered; no tension in the air. Or at least no more tension than was usual.
Momentarily weak, Sherlock said, “Your dad and I were talking about the three of us having Christmas together, Watson. What do you think?”
When Sherlock offered John a crostini spread with chicken liver paté and balsamic-glazed onions, he accepted, keeping his doubts to himself, and found it astoundingly delicious. Through the course of the evening, he returned to the tray three times, for more.
“Makes sense. But with your one-and-done rule, and me having to keep working with him,” John smirked, “A threesome seems like it could be more complicating than we’d like.” He drew his pants up to his waist and snapped the waistband into place atop his hipbones. With a shrug he added, “But I’ll ask him. See what he says.”
Sherlock said it matter-of-factly, guarding his own emotions, whatever they were at the time, whatever they had become. He wasn’t sure of the names, didn’t trust the sensations they inspired.
“Untrue, a pair of students used an algorithm to create the world’s most annoying song and this is not it.”
“Night then,” John said, and kissed his hair, and shifted just enough to sink Sherlock deeper into him. What had he done with himself before John Watson? Sherlock shuddered to think, and so didn’t. All was as it should be, and there was nothing for it but to be present in that moment.  He stroked one big toe up and down over John’s ankle, just slowly, until he drifted off.
“Mother’s rather smitten with your companion; you should expect to hear casual mentions of grandchildren in the near future.”
Sherlock lowered himself into his mother’s twee, too-narrow armchair and pilfered the last of Mycroft’s biscuits.
Sherlock found admirable; instead of passing around blame, John had chosen closure of ranks and a staunch, unconditional defense of his own. Sherlock tried not to find this protective assertion sexy, wondered if he was barred from attraction to John simply because their relationship had broken down, decided it was biological and beyond his ability to control, wallowed in momentary appreciation of the particular, firm set of John’s shoulders.
Sherlock folded himself back into his chair, adjusting it as he went, dragging it a bit nearer to John’s.
“No,” Steven replied, licking his lips in a utilitarian manner, then smiling with half his mouth. “You’re right; the beard’s new. You dressed more like a grown-up, I remember.”
“I’ll see what I can find out and get back to you,” John told her, and a glance at the television showed him a text-crawl about explosions in storage and repair facilities for city buses. “I’ll ring you back,” he said distractedly. As he disconnected the call, his phone lit up with a text.
“Normally I’d beg off,” Sherlock said. “But is this a teammate invitation, or a boyfriend of your sister invitation?”
“Good morning, Dr Watson. Mr Holmes, nice to see you both again,” the teacher began. Sherlock cut a glance to John, and saw by the angle of his smile he was still fantasizing about her with some regularity. John cleared his throat; Sherlock closed his eyes to hide rolling them.
Despite the fact Rosie had always been quite loud about having two parents, and would tell anyone who listened, “Just like you’ve got a mum and a dad, I’ve got a dad and a
Sherlock nodded, hands in his pockets, one tapping itchily at the cigarette packet within it. He dared to venture, “Are you free? Coffee?”
“Busy time of year, but after I’ve submitted my grades for the semester, maybe. Between Christmas and New Year’s? Something like that?” Iain the queer poet was rolling with it; Sherlock sensed he would be willing to do much, if it meant spending time with John. More than a crush, then.
LoPresti got start after start, and win after win, making huge saves, working overtime to prove himself worthy. No doubt other teams around the league were taking note, looking at their own starting goaltenders’ records and making calculations about who might be offered in trade. All well and good for him; he was a quality goalie, no doubt, with a very different style to Sherlock’s which had always made him seem like less than a threat. Now there was chatter in the sports press about LoPresti’s rise to the occasion of Holmes’s collapse, how adeptly he filled the gap, how the Brawlers’ head office had a real dilemma to face when it came to the cost/benefit analysis of sitting their ten-million-dollar starting goaltender at risk of making the golden goose unhappy.
“Very funny,” John chided. “You’re funny.” He ditched the plates and forks in the sink, drew out his phone to buy their tickets. One thing Sherlock decidedly did not need just then was John worrying over him. Doubting him. That much, Sherlock could handle all on his own.
He considered Sherlock’s insistence on staying when John tried to wave him off. His imperious way of walking ahead of John. The weird exchange with the teacher, making everyone squirm with hints about what he thought he
“Excellent!” Sherlock smacked his hands together and looked pleased, like a kid who’d just been told he could set up the tent in the back garden for the night. “Pack a bag; we’ll be gone until tomorrow.”
“I want you to adopt her. I want her to be yours, just as much as she’s mine.” John reached across and rested his hand on Sherlock’s knee, briefly, a reassuring brush of fingers. “I’ve always wanted that for her. And for you.”
He made his way upstairs, the rubbery tip of his cane thudding on each step, and found both doors from the landing into Sherlock’s flat shut. He pressed the sticky note in place onto the sitting room door, right in the center of another, bigger wreath that hung there.
“My concern with this, as far as Rosamund’s recent behaviour, is that I must remind her pretty often that her classmates have different tolerance levels for frightening ideas and images. She seems to enjoy telling stories that can be scary to those children who are a bit more sensitive, and needs repeated direction to stop, and perhaps choose another activity.”
John looked pleased; he’d booked them an island holiday during the Brawlers’ bye week shortly after they’d seen such a place in a television program about exotic travel. There’d be white sand and blue sea only steps from their elegantly-appointed room, with privacy enough for trysts in waist-deep water. John talked of paragliding and guided hikes, but Sherlock wished only to burrow together under soft sheets, to eat unusual fruits soaked in local rum, to sleep at their leisure. To let go of every thought in his head and sink into spoiling pleasure.
They disentangled, wiped away the leavings, stretched and hummed luxuriously. John’s fingers teased into and out of Sherlock’s hairline, leaning up on his elbow at Sherlock’s side.
“It’s not safe for her here,” John replied, mechanically lifting out objects from Rosie’s basket and dropping them into an army-issue canvas bag he held open. “
“What’s our wake-up call time?” George asked, staring into the mini-fridge but ultimately coming up empty-handed.
John cleared his throat mildly, and his voice went quieter, compelling Sherlock to study the shape of his mouth around the words.
“He licked me so slow, all the way up to my bollocks.” John’s eyes stayed closed, and the angle was strange—chin and nose, pursing and licking his lips—as he rested the bottom edge of his phone against his chest. Just as well, as Sherlock kept forgetting to frame his own face properly, more intent on sliding his hand in perfect tempo up and down along his cock. John’s voice brought his focus back to the telling of the tale. “His tongue was so wet, and he kept on stroking it over my hole, just licking and licking while my cock got harder and harder in his hand.”
“I see my dad,” she dutifully reported to her teacher, who looked where she was pointing and gave John a wave and a grin as she bid Rosie a good rest of the day. Rosie ran at him, and he bent to catch her; she swung in his embrace before setting her trainers back to earth. “Dadda! Why is it you today? Sherlock is meant to take me home, I thought.”
“Colin. I know yours. It’s unusual. Hard to forget.” He smiled with very white, very straight teeth, then took Sherlock’s hand and guided himself around in a sort of spin, laughing to let Sherlock know he was being cute and funny. When he came back around, he pressed closer, one hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, the other resting very low on his back. “Check my pocket,” Colin told him, and indicated with a downturned gaze the breast pocket of his shirt.
“You forgot to say goodbye to Sherlock!” she gasped suddenly, as they walked up the pavement toward the building.
“Thanks. No.” John tugged at his nose with thumb and knuckle. “The toddler seemed OK, a little quiet, kept an eye on me, suspicious. The boy was hyper, all over the room, interrupting, touching everything.”
—and tilted his hips back where he wanted them. He was close at Sherlock’s back as he thrust his cock into the space he’d slicked, pinching Sherlock’s hip, shoving at the meat of his buttocks with rough fingers, his chest thudding up against Sherlock’s back when he moved to slide between Sherlock’s thighs. He went hard, groping and gripping to pull Sherlock to him, against him, and now and then they caught each other’s gaze in the portrait mirror, and Sherlock shivered—taken—giving in.
Sherlock offered him tea, which John declined, then whiskey, which he accepted. Sherlock poured them each a splash and directed John to sit at the kitchen table, where there were five separate, neatly stacked piles of paperwork. He ticked them off, touching each one with the tip of his finger. “Relevant medical history for the past thirteen years; heart, lung, and brain specialist visits since 2010; visiting nurses and other at-home attendants; hospice records; and the wife’s notes taken contemporaneously during his final hospitalisation and the period in hospice care.”
John wondered if Sherlock might be a paranoid schizophrenic, or in a manic period--it could explain the one-day orgy of holiday decorating John had witnessed. Asserting that his flat might be bugged was a bit. . .out there.
She swung a little pink duffel that held her dance shoes and a bottle of water, held it up to show him.
“Usually a family tree is a record of who married who, who was whose parent or brother or sister,” John dodged in favour of focusing on the letter of Rosie’s assignment rather than its spirit. “They can get quite big—imagine two parents having four or six children, who all have partners and children—all the cousins and aunts and uncles may not really know each other in a big gang like that, but they’re still technically family.”
John considered demurring again, but caught sight of Sherlock’s profile and decided to walk up to the edge. It had been forever since he’d had anyone. Even longer since he’d had a friend. And Sherlock was a bit weird, but god he was gorgeous. Only seemed to half-know it, too, which made it even worse. Or. Better.
“I explained to you it’s hard for him to get around right now, since he got hurt. It’s just easier for everyone for you to stay at home with me.”
It wasn’t like him not to notice an incoming body, even one walking silently on soft-soled, expensive shoes, even--or perhaps especially--one approaching him from behind. And yet he’d been distracted enough that when he turned, his bent elbow caught on someone’s rising forearm, he squeezed the cup too hard in an effort to save it, the top flew off, and the foamy, milky coffee arced up and splashed down, soaking them both.
John smiled to himself, and the anxious sensations seeped out from under his skin back to wherever they lurked when not in use.
“Yeah,” John said, after a moment’s true consideration of Sherlock’s inquiry. “Yeah, I’m OK. I was thinking a lot today about the idea that no one else on the Thrashers will wear number eighteen, ever again. And tonight, looking up at the banners, and there’s so many guys who’ve been Thrashers over the years, and so few numbers up in the rafters. It really hit me what an honour that is.”
“I’ll mention it,” Mrs Hudson said, and her face was doing that thing where she was about to say something disapproving and piteous, so John flashed another tight-lipped grin at her and waved his hand a bit.
John had taken to leaving his front door open, as Sherlock and Mrs Hudson both did, whenever he was at home--which he was most of the time--and not asleep. It helped him feel a little less hemmed in. It also gave him a better view of the front foyer, and he noticed Sherlock coming and going. Sometimes they said hello.
John’s instinct was to play it off casually, pretend he agreed, but having already decided the risk was worth taking, he felt a duty to stay committed. “Why’s that?” he asked, and fixed a gaze on Sherlock, which Sherlock met only briefly before looking away toward the running, giggling children, as if Rosie needed checking at just that moment.
“Birds, I think,” Sherlock said. He inhaled deeply, exhaled as slow and long as he could manage, and let his muscles melt.
“Not entirely,” Sherlock replied. “I was going to have the party; I always do. But. . .” He shrugged.
At the appointed time, a smiling young man summoned, “Rosamund W,” and lead the three of them down a short corridor to a conference room, where they were greeted by a woman in a smart outfit and statement necklace, who introduced herself as Constance Arthur, the district judge. She invited them to take seats at the table, where the clerk who’d brought them had placed a green folder and three pens. In the center of the table was a tray with plastic glassware and small, sealed bottles of water; a spike-leaved plant Sherlock immediately picked out as an imitation, though admittedly a good one; and a square, pink paper bag with yellow tissue overspilling its top.
“My sister and her boyfriend rented a house; we’re staying with them,” John added, trying to smooth things, bless him. Sherlock would be sure to thoroughly, gratefully bless him later. On his knees. Perhaps in the shower.
John had long dreamed of a place to call his own, no one to answer to--not much, but enough--and had been satisfied. How much better it was, though, to be making a home for his love, his own Sherlock Holmes, in a house that John built.
A roll and fall into synchronised heaving, kisses broken for want of breath, bodies meeting and retreating and meeting again.
“Her granny and grandad came and brought her an iPhone,” Rosie reported. John braced himself for what inevitably came next. “Can I have an iPhone?”
Sherlock huffed a sigh out his nose. The barber laid two fingers on his temple to persuade a head tilt and Sherlock found it deeply annoying but ultimately complied. The first half of the email had given him a pleasant wash of that old familiar sensation of
“Not at all. For the moment it’s only an investment property.” He sipped the wine, which was flattening and changing character; Sherlock wasn’t sure he liked the newer version.  After a pause, he said, “For the moment I’m looking only so far professionally as the next game, then the next. Feel like I’m getting my legs back under me but. . .” He waved his hand lightly in front of his shoulder. “You know.”
“Sometimes guys get shaky. You know this. It’s not a crisis.” Lestrade had been scolding him for the better part of an hour, picking apart his performance not just in the previous night’s game but over the course of the season to that point. Sherlock agreed with most of what he said. Sherlock missed easy saves. Sherlock was in his own head. Sherlock was probably having some post-championship letdown. Things all right outside the arena? All good at home, and that?
Sherlock spooled out the story of the case as they ate, and it was fascinating and horrible, and John was rapt. Though nothing personally encouraging was said, he felt more confident about his proposed role in Sherlock’s subterfuge by the time he’d finished the tale. It would be fine. It might even be fun.
“You got the worst of it, I’m afraid,” Sherlock said, sounding apologetic, looking down at John’s shoes, which glistened with drops of spilled coffee. “What are you having? I’ll buy you another.”
Glancing around the kitchen John was willing to believe it was not on fire, and left the extinguisher alone in favour of raising the window sash to let some air move. He couldn’t suppress a grin at evidence that Sherlock had found something at which he did not excel.
John dirty-smiled and dragged his hand over his jaw. “Young, rough hands. Nice shoulders, chest. Thick dark hair and light brown eyes.”
Inside was a photo card, portraying a mantelscape of pine and candles John immediately recognised. Just to the right of center, an antique-looking folding knife was stabbed through the top of a long, cream-coloured strip of paper, the writing on it just legible: a wishlist.
John had been too busy to engage with his online therapist except during their regularly scheduled chats, given the adjustments of having Rosie at home every night, taking her back and forth to school, dance, and vitally important appointments with playfriends. To say nothing of his work, where he was dead on his feet half the time, or of how his back hurt from spending every night on the sofa so that Rosie could have the bed. Time to look for a new flat, he thought, but it was terribly unlikely he’d find anything even the same, let alone bigger—a proper bedroom, or at least the space for two beds, even if one of them was in an alcove, cupboard, or under some stairs—because he was already stretching frighteningly thin, in multiple directions, to cover the rent.
“We should do some warm-ups, then, if there’s about to be a forest orgy.” John accepted a proffered glass of vinho verde—Portuguese, not local, of course—and found a comfortable place for himself amid the mounds of cushions, contrary to his own suggestion. “C’mere, then, and let me get an arm around the most handsome man in the Northeast Kingdom.” Sherlock accepted the invitation, curling up beside John, their arms in an ‘x’ as each rested a hand on the other’s thigh.
“They’ll find me out, and they’ll come and take her, and then I’ll have.” He sobbed, and Sherlock’s heart broke.
His thoughts drifted, babies and children, fad toys with their own internet web-series, Rosie pretending to have a YouTube channel the modern version of kids pretending to be on the telly, the movie he’d half-watched a few nights prior then forgot about—mental note to get back to it.
her.” His voice broke on it, and his shoulders fell. He pressed his fingertips and thumb against the bridge of his nose, head down, and Sherlock could hear him struggling to calm himself with an audibly shaky inhalation of breath.
John looked over at Rosie, asleep in the bed in its little alcove, from his dim-lit station on the sofa. As he readied himself for bed—chastising himself for the earliness of the hour, half-nine, like a kid—he thought about the idea of
Sherlock hummed at him, peering across the top rim of John’s reading glasses, which he wore on the tip of his nose like a spinster aunt. John thought it suited him, made him look a bit meek—even vulnerable—which was not a veneer Sherlock often wore.
Half off his feet, his shirttails irritatingly tickling his thighs, both their belt buckles rattling, Sherlock dipped his fingertips between Steven’s, to tickle and pinch the crown of his own cock while they pulled together and Steven bucked up faster and harder behind him. Sherlock’s orgasm was a sudden shock to his system, as quick and forceful as the whole encounter had been, and Steven maneuvered his hand to catch what he could, then jammed his fingers into his mouth, licking and sucking, and Sherlock watched his reflection in the mirror—sweat at his temples, shirt collar unbuttoned, necktie loosened, sucking Sherlock’s cum off his fingers and coming, his eyes rolling back before he closed them. His spunk was hot and fluid-thin, flooding the space between Sherlock’s arse-cheeks, and sliding down toward the inside of his thigh. Steven’s fingers at his hip would surely leave bruises.
“Nothing,” John said curtly, then stopped mid-stride, near the foot of the bed, let go a quick sigh. “I had a pile of papers lying around somewhere, some of them had graphs and whatnot on them. You haven’t seen them, by any chance?”
“Right after the game tonight,” Sherlock confirmed, then added somewhat snidely, “Do you want me to arrange tickets for you?”
“AnarchoTec is doing something with data collection the Chinese would love to get their hands on,” he offered. “There’s an update soon. And a programmer involved in keeping it all secure hasn’t been a housebreaking victim yet.”
Leaning slightly closer, John lowered his voice and gave Sherlock a penetrating gaze. “Loads of sex.”
OK, so we edited out the boring stuff like Hi, can you hear me? and introducing ourselves (we interviewed them via conference call). We talked for about forty-five minutes, sometimes about dumb stuff you don’t care about like how we decided to start the blog and hockey-geek stuff you might care about but which is not fun to describe in this format, like who we like for the upcoming season, and why Graham McInearney is the most undervalued center in the league right now.
Mercifully, there came a knock, and John opened the door before it had finished sounding. He let the uniformed man wheel in a cart laden with food—including a basket of baked goods enough to feed eight people or two hockey players, and a bucket of ice embracing a bottle of champagne. The bellman offered to open the bottle but John declined, shoved a folded bill at him, and practically chased him out the door.
There was an uncharacteristic seven-second pause in her chat-stream. Sherlock’s shoulders eased downward.
John pretended to think it over, frowning, checking the clock. He tilted his head toward the landing to listen for any fuss from Rosie, downstairs in Mrs Hudson’s flat. At last he slapped his palms against the arms of his chair and pushed himself upward. “Yeah, why not?”
“Anyway, it’s late and I’m tired,” John said with finality, ending the discussion of whether he could arrange a hookup to sub in for the absent Sherlock.
The rapid-fire patter was delivered as she shrugged out of her warm jacket and handed it to him, then steadied herself on his shoulder to step out of her boots, their soles just wetted from damp pavement; the rain had stopped. Sherlock regained his feet and moved to hang her coat on the hall tree, lining up her boots on the floor between two pairs of his shoes.
Sherlock took several strides away, crouching to catch Rosie as she jogged to them. He embraced her and kissed her head, and let her go.
“If the internet fails me, you’re the first one I’ll call. I think the sleep disorder angle is one to pursue.” Sherlock stood, and they walked toward the landing. “You’ll let me know if something occurs to you later.”
Steven politely directed him to the en suite bath—hidden door, small but with a shower and even a bidet—and Sherlock cleaned himself up, checking his thighs and arse for marks, and feeling oddly disappointed to find none that were likely to last very long.
As the two began their descent toward the front door, John said, “Darling, I wish you’d told me your parents would be here; I’d have come earlier.” He scolded, “Shameful behaviour.”
Ten minutes later, he checked again, between the girl with obvious strep infection, and a pensioner with a chest cough. The death toll had risen to three. There were pictures and amateur videos of a smoking metal skeleton that had once been building, fire brigades, police tape being unfurled. Across London, public transit stations were being evacuated and vehicles searched by bomb-sniffing dogs. John’s heart lurched toward Disraeli Primary School and he passed the pensioner off to his nurse.
“Where do you want me?” Sherlock asked, and the groaning gasp it elicited in reply was well worth stifling some of his instincts.
--and John held him hard and kissed him hard, again and again, silly smacking kisses on his forehead and cheeks and at last on his beautiful lips.
One pretty amenity John had been sold was a butler—the resort called him a “host”—assigned only to them and their whims throughout their stay. Jordan was compactly built—a bit like John but less dense—with a toasty complexion and dark hair he wore medium-long and smoothed back from his wide forehead. Sherlock—himself gratefully half-naked and barefoot at all times—marveled at the polish of the host’s shoes, and how he never appeared to perspire despite wearing a three piece suit. He was not a local, but an American—from Georgia, to be exact—but could not be drawn into personal conversation and so Sherlock was left to wonder how he had ended up on a Caribbean island, though he knew the usual story of Americans in such jobs tended to be of young people spending a year or two earning money forty hours a week—and partying with holiday-makers all the rest. Regardless, Jordan had proved himself to be useful as well as decorative.
Sherlock had been six stories underground—needling his brother—for the best part of three hours; he’d had to surrender his phone at the first security checkpoint. It wasn’t until he emerged onto the pavement that he found the string of increasingly edgy texts from John. He threw up an arm and shout-summoned a cab, barked at the driver that if he valued his life he’d put his foot down hard and get them to Cooper’s Green Road as quickly as possible.
It felt less like a real home than ever, on those nights when John returned from his clinic work to the hum-filled silence of a flat with nobody in it.
“Thought you’d like to know the woman we met in Comfort’s clinic had the gold ingot safely removed from her sinus cavity by a competent surgeon. She’s in recovery and the gold is in evidence.”
Sherlock was pleased to think of John going out of his way to meet the team plane in the dead of night, but felt obliged to say, “No need.”
“Game day,” Sherlock announced, and drew the covers up around his shoulders to keep in their body heat. John was already awake beside him, looking at his phone, which he put face down on the bedside table.
“Very well done,” Sherlock congratulated them both, eyes closed, but grinning. He squeezed his lips forward and John obliged him with a kiss upon them, then another.
“It’s all right,” Sherlock said dismissively. “I’ve work to do and won’t sleep much. Take the bed. I’m fine here.”
“Whatever we want,” John told him, and the tone of his voice communicated his delight at the fact of no demands on them, in a hotel bed in paradise. He bent and stretched and came up with his t-shirt, courteously swiped it over the surface of Sherlock’s abdomen. “We could get some food?”
Sherlock could sense what John was really asking, so answered accordingly. “He hasn’t put in a request to change roomies so I assume he’s not a rampant homophobe. Or, now that I think of it, perhaps he sees it as an opportunity to target me for a hate crime.” Sherlock smirked, and John looked chagrined.
There was always porn. He wouldn’t need much time. It would help drain off the last of his adrenaline, and a solo orgasm was better than none. He tapped and swiped, muted the sound, opened his trousers and looked around for anything slippery. He was already stroking his prick with a coating of perfumey body lotion from a tiny plastic bottle—hotels should stock lubricant, he’d often thought, but then, he would—by the time he even looked at the phone’s screen to see what video he’d landed on. A three-way, outdoors, all of them wearing thick cableknit socks and lumberjack boots. Sherlock set aside curiosity about how they got their jeans off without taking off the boots, and kept his attention on setting a pace to bring himself off quickly.
Sherlock let him hover there a half-instant, then tilted to meet him. Not merely offering an upturned palm, though, he made a delicate fumble of the transaction, and let the tip of his index finger trace a suggestive slide down the inside of John’s thumb. John’s eyebrows rose and he gave another version of his skeptical quarter-laugh.
He lifted his head and stretched his neck, couldn’t believe the time, and how much of it he’d wasted.
He jogged across the grounds to the house, was still the last to arrive at the table despite his effort to hurry. He carried in the pocket of his trousers the little notebook where he kept his sketches, its pages bulging from tucked-in scraps of treasure.
he texted, barely able to string words together in his brain, let alone pass it off in text as casual dismissal of a grammatical quirk.
—packed her brush but kept her comb, left her toddler-era comfort-blanket folded on the foot of her bed, which she left, and then three weeks later, took. Mrs Hudson gave her a little tea party while the men with the van jogged up and down the stairs six times. Sherlock leaned against the kitchen worktop, tugging his lip. John rubbed his fingers and thumb against his headache spot.
John stormed in and slammed both doors to the landing, locking the two of them in together, his nostrils flaring in his fury.
“We’ll have to have a look sometime,” John said dully, placating and heroically struggling not to hint at being either bored or puzzled.
Thanks once more to kind friends and chapter sponsors LonghornLetters and K2DangerGirl, who got to name characters Alex George (Sherlock's new teammate/suitemate) and Iain Westcott (John's writing partner)!
When Sherlock caught a glimpse of John—only mildly prowling judging by parted thighs and flat-planted feet, upright spine pressing his chest forward just so—he felt a particular stirring and congratulated himself for his brilliance. He set a hand on John’s knee, brushed upward, and John threw him a wink over the rim of his glass.
“No,” Sherlock said again. “You must trust me. If you ever have—I know it may be hard for you to believe—but please, John, you must trust me when I say you are doing just fine, and no one is going to take that girl.”
Sherlock nodded and hummed, unfastening the too-many buttons on the fly of his jeans. Steven slid his brown leather belt out of the loops of his khaki trousers, tugged at his polo shirt to untuck it.
.” He mugged a knowing expression. “The artist is a lesbian, does custom work, a lot of commitment jewelry for The Gays. In particular, The Wealthy Gays.”
“You’re a real treat today, darling. Is it bedtime yet?” John was sure his own eyes were as glassy as hers; he’d worked three shifts in two days while she’d been with Sherlock.
John was directed to exit the rink, the small crowd gathered on the rug for the ceremony leading and following him as he grinned and waved his thanks to the crowd, and Sherlock skated out the visitors’ door to meet him as he reached the Hamilton bench. The Brawlers poured over the bench and gathered around him—their former captain, too—to pat his shoulders and back, bump his knuckles with their own.
“Speaking of which, we should shower up and dress; if you show up late on game night with me in tow, people are bound to talk.”
“Morning,” Sherlock murmured, nuzzling his face up under John’s arm, shamelessly digging his nose into the hair, nipping at the tendon that emerged as John lifted his elbow to accommodate him.
John chucked a small handful of upholstery nails into a tin with a satisfying rattle. “Think I can manage,” he replied, and threw Sherlock a wink.
In moments they were slick with spit and fucking up against each other in steady rhythm; Sherlock gratefully pinned to the mattress and John hectic for the finish.
Sherlock, recently furious with worry and a sensation of having been left out of something rather vital to his health and happiness, understood John’s anger but thought it was not only misdirected, but out of proportion to the current situation—which was serious but not truly dire. John leaned away from Rosie, talking through near-gritted teeth.  “For you, that’s as bad as if you left her alone to go out for a pint and to watch a match at the corner pub.”
“Helped?” John reached across and speared Sherlock’s smoked eel, thrust it to his mouth and finished it in two bites. He offered shrimp tempura roll as an apology but Sherlock waved it off, feeling anything batter-fried rather negated the entire point of sushi, which was to provide a meal more nutritious than pizza or fast food burgers.
“Are you getting adopted today, too?” she asked him. He nodded. His parents were beaming, and two teenage siblings posted selfies, presumably sharing the occasion with their social media followers. Rosie nodded acknowledgement. “That’s good for you. Congratulations! I’m getting half-adopted.” She pointed toward John and Sherlock. “My dad already has me, but Sherlock is going to adopt me because that makes a family more secure.”
“How’s the mobility in that right shoulder? Anything bothering you? How about the wrist, got a good grip on the stick?”
Kocur turned his focus on Lamm and shook off a glove; Lamm only shook his head and skated away. Mellon, ever the pest, poked Merrick repeatedly in the back with the blade of his stick. The linesmen buzzed around, trying to keep a fight from erupting.
Steven reached around and cupped Sherlock’s bollocks in one hand, squeezing and rolling, possessive, uncareful. Reflexively jumping away from the stimulation, Sherlock thrust his arse against Steven’s prick and hips, and made him grunt, then growl, and hold him there and fuck harder against him, his cockhead slipping fast and rough over Sherlock’s hole. Taking him in hand, Steven’s fingers were more sticky than slick, but his grip was perfect and he pulled hard and fast. Noisy over Sherlock’s shoulder, he growled, and panted, cursed, grunted in time. Sherlock’s mouth was dry and he licked his lips, shifted his weight to free his hand, wrapped it around Steven’s to guide him.
Sherlock sipped at the wine, let it release its mild effervescence against his palate before swallowing. “It’s only the appealing fantasy of a neverending holiday. A week in a beautiful place you don’t have to clean or maintain, uncluttered by your lifetime’s collection of junk, at last feeling relaxed and treating yourself to experiences you wouldn’t normally have, food you wouldn’t normally eat. You trick yourself into thinking it would always be like that. Or that it could.”
Sherlock let his head tilt, supporting his chin with his thumb, two fingers pressing hard against his temple.
Boston kept control most of the remaining four minutes of the second, had some good chances the Gold Rush goaltender robbed them of.  Just before the horn, Sherlock dropped a puck and covered it, though it should have been one he brushed aside; Kocur was nearby and with his long reach could have scooped up a well-placed rebound. The faceoff in his own end meant more pressure from the Rush, and they took three more shots before the siren went. Sherlock was at the bench in seconds, stomped down the tunnel without raising his mask.
,” Sherlock urged, and pulled John by the shoulders, until at last he was flat on his back with his thighs open and John lying heavy between them, rocking his hips in impossible, serpentine motions. Sherlock leaned up to nip at his ear lobe, then requested, “More.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, meaning it two ways. He transferred the cake back to its box, to return it to the fridge. “Going right to sleep, then,” he ventured, an almost-question.
“Behave for your granny, Watson,” he instructed, ignoring Mrs Hudson’s plea. “In bed no later than half-eight. John.” He threw John’s coat across the space between them; John lunged to catch it.
He needed to play. He needed his start. He needed his routine, from the first words off his lips upon waking—
,” she whined, thin and heartbreaking. The zippy, chatterbox girl Sherlock eagerly observed in all her rapid-fire changes of mood and expression, reduced to misery and fever-dreams. Hateful.
“You’ve been playing a long time, pro a long time; just ease up on yourself—you know—mentally—and concentrate on the physical stuff. Just reminding your body what it needs to do is often all it takes to shake it off and get back to work.”
Three hours later, they trudged up the stairs they’d thundered down earlier, the still silence of a whole house asleep at distinct odds with the jangling bustle of the city they’d recently slogged through. There was freezing rain, and a cutting wind off the river, and Sherlock was certain as he bent to untie them that his oxfords were beyond saving. John’s boots had weighed him down and slowed them, but his socks were dry. His cheeks were pink and he smiled in a particular way Sherlock had nearly forgotten he had.
John gave it up for lost and switched to playing a mindless, anxiety-soothing game wherein he fired coloured balls at other coloured balls to explode pairs. The sound effect when the balls landed was satisfying. The high-pitched, unearthly swooping sound when they burst was tolerable.
,” Sherlock told him, his voice confessionally low. After a half-beat, he added, “It was an experiment.”
Sherlock felt his nosebridge crumple in a frown; he’d come from the practice arena freshly scrubbed but dressed casually in black jeans and a baggy white jumper with a large black X on the front. Caught off-guard by the casual insult, he was unable to quickly assemble a clever reply, about how he thought his relative youth was what Steven fancied about him, or the exorbitant price he’d paid for the designer clothes, or. . .anything at all.
John was back to work, giving his talks and making appeals for donations to his foundation. They’d enjoyed a good stretch of time together on the road—almost just as it used to be, though now they stayed in non-league-sanctioned hotels, just the two of them in five-star rooms John specially arranged for the nostalgic road trip—but since their return home they’d been re-cast in the roles of proverbial ships in the night. In the nearly two weeks since John had flown back to Boston while Sherlock went on to play in Phoenix (the Flames pummeled the Brawlers, winning 6 – 2), they had spent only three non-consecutive nights together in their flat. Sherlock made do with CRUZR hookups when he couldn’t video-chat with John, and so felt his most basic needs were met, but there was an itch of discontent beneath his skin nearly always—one he could not discern the cause of, nor alleviate. He felt if he could only pinpoint it, he’d gratefully scratch it until it bled.
“Heard from Coach about your start?” John asked.  In sixteen hours, the Brawlers were opening a five-game west coast road trip with a game against the Condors.
“Sometimes that’s not enough. We’re hardly the first.” John sounded resigned—neither relieved nor disappointed—as he offered, “I think it’s probably too late to change. We’re only ever growing older and even more set in our ways.”
“Help your father and I’ll go look. Stop in and say hello to Mycroft; he’s in the front room with his tea.”
. John’s transformation from slack and silent to tense and growling in the course of those few moments was magnificent; Sherlock felt privileged and powerful, bringing him to life.
“But maybe Lulu is there. She doesn’t come to our park.” Lulu had been Rosie’s nearest-in-age friend back in Baker Street, a fixture at their playground for the past three years. “Can you call her mum and ask if she can come play here?”
He dressed and even led the team out to the ice—team-wide superstition preventing them from implementing too many changes to the usual routines—then took his seat on the stool at the end of the bench, wearing a ball cap instead of his mask, his sticks lined up in the rack behind the equipment manager. He cheered his teammates, chirped at his opponents when he could, kept on being his brothers’ brother. LoPresti started on a win streak. Sherlock worked on explosive movement and twitch muscle response with Whitehouse every morning; added a fifteen-minute seated meditation to his game day routine; took shots from teammates and hangers-about during extra, off-hours practice sessions. He slept five or six non-consecutive hours each night, let John massage his feet while they watched television, smoked cigarettes out the window while John was out at foundation meetings and giving talks. Drank wine with lunch.
In a tone Sherlock by then had come to know well--of contentment and a little disbelief, warm with adoration--John’s easy response was, “Now I’ve got you, my own one, I’ve nothing left to hope for. I’ve no need to make a wish.”
“You’re tired, sweetheart,” John told her, feeling truly sorry for her because he had some of the same and knew what it was like. “Let’s put screens away and get you ready to sleep.”
He thought of a real threesome he and John had had with a twinky waiter in Seattle, of John watching him giving head—not unlike this one in the video, chin wet, swallowing impossibly deep. Imagined that instead of watching him, John had urged him onto all fours as the muscle queen was doing to the lanky one, teasing Sherlock’s hole that way, with his prick—nearly that long, just that thick—rubbing it along the cleft to tease him with promises of more to come. Sherlock rolled his palm over the head of his prick, licked his lips, envisioned himself with a cock in his mouth, deep in, holding his tongue down. John’s cock wet with slick, pressing hard to force Sherlock open, slow and steady, holding his hip. John’s fingers curling into the flesh at the top of Sherlock’s thigh, pulling his hips back where he wanted him. Sherlock sucking, licking, and John fucking, fucking. . .
“Know what?” John said, hoping to redirect her. “Talking of Christmas, if we’re going to have a tree, we’re going to have to get some things to tart it up with. What if we get dressed and brush our own hair—as you suggest—and go out to the shops to find some, I don’t know, strings of beads or silver snowflakes or whatever. The whole lot. What do you think?” He boosted and unfolded himself to stand, and arched his back so much he couldn’t help but look at a wavering, beige water stain on the ceiling.
John was visibly disappointed in what remained of Sherlock’s childhood bedroom: two narrow beds pressed up against perpendicular walls painted beige, linens and curtains navy blue and bland. No cuddly toy propped against a pillow, no trophies, not even a pin-up of a lusted-after pop star or an admired hockey pro. The one shelf hung between the windows held only a dictionary and two volumes of fairy tales Sherlock had never owned in childhood—mostly likely his mother’s spoils from a car-boot sale, with spines that matched the décor.
“That sounds like a bit of fun,” Mrs Holmes cooed. “How nice you’ve got friends you can travel with.” The last of it directed squarely at Sherlock, well known not to have friends of any sort, at all.
“Yep,” John interjected. “I’ll let you know. Should be pretty normal, I think. If anything changes—”
“And it was the first time that I was treated like a stranger instead of her parent. The school’s been very understanding, for instance. But when they took her into that room and made me stay outside, and call you. . .” Sherlock shook his head. “I guess I hadn’t had to think about those things before. The legalities. Because I held her while her age was still counted in hours. And ever since.”
“Mad snogging in the too-small bed,” John told him, and there followed nuzzling kisses on throats, and nips along summer-stubbled jaws. “Trying to be quiet.”
John drew himself up away from the fence on which he was leaning. His face was aching from frowning and pursing his lips. His forehead was so pinched it had sparked a headache. He tugged his lip, then scrubbed it with his fingertips.
“One to stay, one to go. Make sure the lid’s tight.” He smiled at John, a mild joke that somehow wasn’t humiliating.
“It’s a Brawlers game,” Sherlock noticed, and their gazes met; John’s eyes were still glistening. “A coincidence, you think?”
Sherlock’s party was sparsely populated with only a haggardly handsome cop (”DI Lestrade, best man at the Yard.” “Nice to meet you, John. Greg.” “Mm, I don’t think so.”), a pretty coroner (”Molly Hooper. She lets me abuse corpses now and then.” “Sherlock, you mustn’t keep saying that.”), Mrs Hudson (”Don’t you look handsome! Be a dear and pour me some punch?”), and John.
“Back to work Monday?” Mr Holmes asked, his hands resting on the back of a kitchen chair, liver spots aimed threateningly in Sherlock’s direction.
He bit a possessive kiss onto the back of Sherlock’s neck, just above his shirt collar, and finally let him go; as he stepped away from Sherlock’s back, Sherlock had a strange collapsing sensation, despite his hand firmly on the shelf’s edge, he felt as if something that had been supporting him had been suddenly yanked away, and he had to catch himself falling. He wondered if he could trust his legs to keep him upright; he felt weak all over.
“So. . .” Sherlock put in, twisting up the false smile everyone fell for. “Open to novel inquiries.” He tilted his head toward John, who grimaced. The teacher’s pinched smile made her look mildly alarmed.
He found a rolling board with a well-worn neck cushion and lowered himself onto it, slid under the jacked-up front of a bus awaiting a fresh tyre. He used his phone’s flashlight to scan for anything obviously out of place, having the previous night committed to memory several photos and diagrams available online to students of fleet maintenance for a price, or for free to determined detectives shamming to an overnight IT specialist that being shut out of the system was certain to cause a failure on an exam and hence destroy his family, future, and fortune. There was nothing obviously extraordinary, which Sherlock found mildly galling, as the bus bore registration information he was sure indicated it was one of those meant to be weaponised.
Sherlock’s hand on John’s thigh came to rest, and instead of teasing, merely held on. “You’re all right?” Sherlock asked.
“If I could get hard again this quickly I’d already be pulling your ankles up on my shoulders,” John told him, and Sherlock shivered something like an orgasm aftershock. Mugging, John stated the obvious, “I’ve missed you.”
Sherlock waited until he was just about to sign his name to venture, “You don’t know Mycroft Holmes, do you?”
John rubbed his forehead and returned his attention to his computer. And it started up again, further to his right. He looked at the ceiling as if it could tell him something. The flurry of footsteps made their random, thudding way around the room, then came a scrape and a thud, and a sound like ball bearings rolling down the slight Baker Streetward slope of the floors. Sherlock let out a rumbling complaint--words John could not discern--and silence fell once more.
John looked exhausted and small, and it was all Sherlock could do not to reach for him again. He looked at his wristwatch. “Watson’s staying downstairs?”
John shook his head in disbelief of his own tragedy, spoke around a half-chewed mouthful of a cheeseburger. “Over two hours. I nearly wept when they told me it was time to leave. Don’t mind saying.”
“Being with you has made me a better man. Makes me a better man every day. And I can’t tell you how I appreciate you.” Sherlock licked dry lips with a dry tongue. “And while I respect you far too much to do anything rash like marry you—”
John frowned, looking vaguely embarrassed. “There’s a lot of glad-handing, posing for photos, making small talk before and after. I don’t mind the time I’m talking, and I enjoyed writing it more than I imagined I would—I had some idea it would be like writing theme essays in school, but it’s actually kind of, I don’t know, fun.”
John stood dumbly for another moment and finally cleared his throat and ventured, “What do you do when you’re not on a case? Not working. For fun.”
“Feel connected to me. Yeah.” Cleared his throat again. He non-explained, “Therapy talk.” Shrugged. “Bear with me.” He turned his eyes to meet Sherlock’s again. “I think I’m having some kind of epiphany.” A self-deprecating smirk to slough off embarrassment.
“I only get three tries at this, and it’s really too cold for public sex in the shrubbery,” John admonished. Sherlock rubbed hard at his chest through layers of hockey jersey, dress shirt, and vest, trying to harden John’s nipples with brushing fingers.
Best just to come out with it. “You remember once I said that being with you is the only easy thing in my life?”
or the evening news. They accepted tea and biscuits as payment for their labour, and Sherlock allowed himself to be embraced as they said their goodbyes. Sherlock’s mum spared a hug for John, and Sherlock’s heart panged watching how John closed his eyes at the sensation of being wrapped in any mother’s arms.
“A holiday, yes,” Sherlock corrected, lest anyone count his weeklong obligation to do his parents’ chores as anything like a relaxing vacation for him.
The counter-girl at Speedy’s wore a head scarf but wished him a happy Christmas. He smiled as he received the over-priced coffee across the counter, gripping his cane in the other hand as he turned to go.
“Perhaps not tomorrow,” was all he said, forcing some false apology into his tone. “Got to run. See you. When.” Another shrug and the driver shut the door.
John touched her shoulder. “Up you get; put on some clothes. I used to do all the cases—what do you mean?”
John brought him along to the point of aching, then eased himself away, swiped saliva from his chin with a brush of his fingertips.
“I get it. I’ve seen you. I’m not worried. Let’s just try to shrug off the past and move forward, all right?”
“Fuck off.” John was smiling. Sherlock had an odd, burning sensation low in the center of his chest.
John felt himself lingering, admiring Sherlock in several new ways, wanting to stay in the beautiful space a while, disinclined to return to his room where all that awaited him for Christmas Eve supper was a packet of HobNobs and a fifth of Scotch. When Sherlock announced that he had plans, though, John knew he should not overstay his welcome.
Nodding, leaning back, John rolled his eyes slightly. “Right.” He crossed his arms over his chest, a motion Sherlock knew well. John cleared his throat. “We’re not doing this,” he announced, and even shook his head. “We’re not going to be those people who muck up a perfectly workable break-up falling in and out of bed.”
“Me, too, I’ll admit.” John came near—cutting a pleasing figure in a tight t-shirt and slim-cut khaki shorts—and Sherlock reached for him, cradling John’s bearded jaw in both hands.
“I think it’s best we go back as we were, before all this. . .” He juggled words in both hands, caught one. “Complication. Keep it about Rose, split the time, try to keep it regular. It’s best for her.” John pinned him with a look. Sad. Decisive. “We’re not getting back together. So let’s just. . .”
Sherlock tapped the edge of his fingernail rapidly against the rim of his saucer. When Mrs Holmes turned away from them, John reached out a hand to quiet Sherlock’s fidget.
Sunday brunch comprised Sherlock on his back and John hovering above, first trading teasing blowjobs back and forth, each bringing the other partway along before stopping to breathe, then losing his breath as the favour was returned. They generated a steadily-rising tension, no cresting and subsiding waves, only building and building, and by the time John replaced two probing fingers with the thick length of his cock, both were sweaty, cursing, clutching, desperate.
“Just keep talking long enough that he doesn’t feel I’ve wasted his time; I suspect he’s holding out for me to raise my budget before he comes across with the good stuff. I’m willing to go another quarter million but he doesn’t need to know that yet. I know he’s the listing agent on that shuttered bank we passed; imagine an oak bar inside the vault.”
“So then, there we are,” John said, with something like finality. “I’m never going to feel good about you risking your life, getting hurt. One of these times it won’t just be your ankle and your wrist.”
Rosie was in the midst of an animated explanation of her display to some other child’s mother and grandmother, and Sherlock stood back, waiting his turn to be acknowledged.
John went on staring, smiling, until Sherlock felt a growling low in his belly and had to look away—didn’t look away—couldn’t—finally licked his lips and turned his gaze over one shoulder, toward the front of the house. John exhaled something not unlike a groan, arousal and frustration, a touch of amusement; Sherlock found it a satisfying sound to hear. Coast clear, he fixed fingers and thumb around John’s chin and guided him, meeting him halfway and kissing hotly, as if they would not be forced out of it by the intrusion of one senior citizen or another, sooner than they wished. Sherlock kissed John a fervent promise of more to come, confirmed it with one roaming hand under the edge of the white lace-hemmed tablecloth.
“Yeah,” John agreed, shuffled his feet and crossed his arms with hands tucked against his ribs. He remembered how content he’d been to watch her sitting on a blanket on the floor between their two armchairs, passing a chain of plastic links from hand to hand. He could look at her face forever, and knew he’d never get bored. It really was like a kind of falling in love; the only other person he’d ever been so utterly besotted by was Sherlock. John would know them anywhere, by just their bare toes.
Sherlock’s nose crumpled at the bridge. He quick-glanced at the box on the table, return address in Scotland, not that John was being nosy.
“You know, I mentioned something to Rosie about how I used to help with your cases, and I don’t think she believed me.” John offered it as a point of interest. It had nagged at him a bit in the intervening days—that Rosie didn’t know or remember him as Sherlock’s second. Of course, she wouldn’t; he’d stopped doing legwork well before she was aware of the things the adults in her life got up to that didn’t center solely around her. But he’d kept up writing the blog, for a while. She must not remember that either—suggesting his Christmas ornament should be doctorly rather than writerly—and he’d been thinking rather a lot about how she saw him. How everyone did.
“Ah,” John said knowingly. “So it’s dirty video chat you’re after. And here I thought you were genuinely concerned about whether I had a good trip.”
I like you dressed like this,” he said, and ran his hands over Sherlock’s bicep through his suit jacket and shirt. “Maybe take this off,” he allowed, and with nimble finger and thumb slipped loose the single button, then pressed his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and guided the jacket off them, sliding until it fell. John quickly swept it aside with his foot, a ruffian gesture that stole Sherlock’s breath. One hand pulled him forward by a hand tucked into the front of his trousers while the other found his nipple and plumped and tightened it through his shirt. “Pretty, pretty,
“That’ll do,” John said at last, and the two looked at each other with the half-lidded, grinning giddy expressions of recently-spent lovers. “All right?”
, and finally settled on clearing his throat and finishing, “You’ll find it when you do a tree with Sherlock.” John made a mental note to ask Mrs Hudson to remind Sherlock when the time came that he should buy a tree and make a date with Rosie to decorate it. It had always been John’s duty to arrange for Christmas trees and pots of tulips in the spring and a new jumper and warm gloves for Rosie on bonfire night; he had little faith that Sherlock would remember to do any of it under his own steam. “Two Christmas trees! That’s not bad, is it?” he enthused, and Rosie looked to be thinking it over.
“They all were. Oh, it was a relief to see them turn brunette. That’s the Scott side coming through.” She lifted her head toward the closed door to the little room off the back of the kitchen. “Eansworth, I’m coming in. I’m showing John the scrapbooks.”
The sun was dropping behind the big house by the time he was finished, and he did wonder whether Madam would truly be pleased with the muddy scar in the ground, but he’d done as ordered, and to the best of his ability, and so in that sense, it was a day well spent. But he was cold, and his fingers were blistered, and his shoulder reminded him about the war. His day of steady exertion and the accomplishment of a task completed left him feeling satisfied. And tired.
“Yes, well. This is a topic perhaps better addressed in a more sober tone,” John said gently. He reached for the bottle, but Sherlock held it, took another deep slug before surrendering. “Though I appreciate you’re on to something rather significant. If anyone could change the bible and the minds of all mankind, I’d put my money on you.”
Sherlock sent a terse reply to the email, insisting he planned to be mobile after his follow-up on the wrist a few days later. He was reminded of years spent arguing about how much danger was acceptable, and of John’s slow-growing resentment that Sherlock kept going out on cases while John paid the psychological price of a self-imposed sidelining. Sherlock had grown used to John coming across more angry than sympathetic on the few-and-far-between occasions when Sherlock came home with injuries. The disapproving frowns and barely-disguised eyerolls he’d gotten from John in response to his current heavily sprained ankle and lightly fractured wrist had been no surprise. It was the most injured Sherlock had been in ages, and John was furious at him. A faint tickle at the back of his mind told him John’s reactions were unreasonable, but whether or not, it was clear Sherlock was being punished.
Later that week, John had a final text-chat with his therapist; she’d helped him find references for a couples-and-family specialist they were already meeting with in person, while they sorted themselves into their new/old niches.
“I can upgrade you to a single-bedroom suite,” she replied, untroubled, perhaps amused. “Congratulations.”
“If you speak another word about my parents from this moment forward I swear I’ll jump out of this car.”
Sherlock reclaimed their not-quite-dry glasses from the dish rack and stood them on the worktop, opened a second bottle of the wine, which was the correct one after all, so clearly not as good as he’d remembered. He made a mental note never to buy it again.
Sherlock smiled a bit and lowered his eyes; he felt sure he would never become accustomed to John’s freely-spoken admiration of him.
“Sherlock, yes. I said yes.” John looked at him with wide eyes, trying to penetrate—a look Sherlock knew well.
Another pause, and Sherlock imagined the way John’s face would knit up and then unravel as he decoded it.
“Oi, now,” Lestrade scolded him. “All I’m saying is this is not something to get your tits in a twist about.”
John felt a strange sense of giddy anticipation as he descended the stairs. His bug-out bag was still packed at the foot of his bed; it took him the full twenty remaining minutes, though, to decide on a hat.
could work out, he would have stayed loyal and worked hard. John Watson, though, had left. Not lightly. And in that case, could a hope remain that
Such thoughts reminded him that as well-balanced and ready as he felt, there was a shard of not-quite-right stuck in his chest, and he texted John.
In the zippered pocket at the back of his running shorts was a money clip pinching together his ID, two cards, and some cash. And if he kept straight, there was a place even the usual suspects would not know, where he could make a purchase. So many of his insomniac nights for weeks on end had been spent talking himself into and out of it. There would always be another day, of course, and maybe he could find it somewhere else. But Sherlock knew with certainty that it was
John looked skeptical, as if tempted to remind Sherlock he was not a particular fan of meeting people, but followed him, glass in hand.
Hot gusts of wet breath against his shoulder and neck; a flying bead of saliva landing on the inner fold of Sherlock’s ear. “Fuck you, you’re so hot. You make me—” The words choked off, coalescing in a shout that sound as much full of rage—possibly revulsion—as it did pleasure. Sherlock felt the hot-pulsing ooze between his thighs, a thick throb against his perineum. He worked to get his hand beneath him; his prick was leaking, aching, and he needed to come and get the fuck out of there though he couldn’t have said which of these needs was the greater. Steven shifted just enough so Sherlock was free to fuck his own hand, thrusting hard into the clammy cage of fingers and palm. Steven had at some point released his grip on Sherlock’s wrist, but all at once his hand was halfway around Sherlock’s neck, thumb dug into the notch at the base of his skull, fingers pressing his throat, something Sherlock never allowed and would never tolerate, but instead of annoyed or frightened, he felt relieved, and so he let Steven carry on. Someone was finally giving him what he deserved.
“You were always—” Sherlock started, but cut himself off and started again. “I know you were always bothered that I still took on cases you thought might be dangerous.”
“Depends on the dinner,” John mused, then probed, “Out at a restaurant, Sherlock said?” He did not relish the ever-frustrating mission of obtaining accurate information from a water bug who seemed to only ever half-listen to anything she was meant to hear (but recalled every word never meant for her ears).
“After they push fluids and something for the fever, they’ll probably tell us to take her home and care for her there,” John went on. “It’s what I’ve been telling people at the clinic. Vaccine’s not been terribly effective; it’s a virulent strain this year.”
“He teaches creative writing at Emerson. This is his side-gig; they don’t pay academics a living wage anymore.” John draped the towel over the corner of the bed and Sherlock looked his fill of his muscular bum and thighs as he went into a drawer for clean pants.
Sherlock resumed a seat in his chair, this time properly, and crossed one thigh over the other. Rosie was unzipping her pack even as she approached, reached in and drew out a sheet of yellow paper with a crayon-drawing on it.
Suddenly John found himself double-timing, as Rosie had jogged ahead and could be surprisingly quick—he’d felt the short-lived but still awful panic of losing sight of her around even the most familiar of corners enough times to have learned how fast she could move.
“Something like that. The mum went to hospital; she went into a shrieking rage once the social worker showed up. Why wouldn’t you? Even if she somehow gets it together. . .” John sighed again, and this time his shoulders stayed down, rolled forward against the weight of the world on them. “She’ll probably never get the kids back. They rarely do ever get it together. Not in time, anyway.”
Sherlock shook his head slightly, didn’t believe it, didn’t want to talk anymore, but would listen a bit longer.
Sherlock slid open the narrow drawer in his wardrobe where John knew he kept his small clothes, as well as neatly tri-folded socks and two sets of hose garters to keep them obedient. John felt a thrill of anticipation; Sherlock had never given him a gift before. Aside from himself, of course.
Sherlock whisked his phone up off the table beside the bed—antlers and glass, he’d once liked it but now wasn’t so sure—scrolled and tapped to summon a car. “Let’s get it over with,” he said grimly. “If we can get out in time, there’s a shop in the same street as the agent’s office that has authentic Danish pastries and excellent coffee.”
“Was the front door not locked?” John asked, annoyed that Sherlock may have made Mrs Hudson vulnerable by leaving the heavy front door open for anyone to walk through.
“They’ll just knock anyway,” John grouched. Sherlock reached for his trouser buttons and John held up a hand. “Wait, let me do that.”
Sherlock hummed. John did his soldierly pivot and marched away down the pavement. Sherlock turned his back and at last lit his cigarette.
By the time they’d had quick and noisy reunion sex; seared and oven-baked the chops; made a quick mint pesto and a risotto tarted up with spinach, lemon, and feta cheese; stuffed themselves; and fallen into bed with John’s laptop between them to watch a crime documentary about an imposter who was obvious to everyone but the mother and siblings of the long-lost loved one he pretended to be, it was half past midnight and Sherlock was struggling against sleep. For no other reason than that he was back with John, cocooned in their sometimes-smelly, clutter-riddled love nest, and for him to fall asleep meant morning must come. Morning meant reporting to the coach’s office for a dressing down or, worse, a “we’re all here for you; what’s going on?” sympathetic faux-therapy session.
Sherlock had a mental list of things he wanted to do just then, none of which was of any benefit to him, but all of which held a promise of distracting him from his current job-related distress.
Sherlock had called in a favour from a computer whiz, arranged a place for her to work outside the police station she refused to step foot inside. John crouched beside Sherlock, by the body, and shared his impressions of a wound in the entirely wrong place for a suicide, the handgun beside his leg looking so clean it might never have been fired. He was dressed smartly from the waist up; his lower half, though, wore ragged tracksuit bottoms and vinyl slippers.
It went on for another twenty or so items. John found himself laughing again. He turned the card to the back, and was surprised to find a hand-written note.
“Mm.” Sherlock was noncommittal; his brain—usually quieter after a good shag—was tangled up in thoughts of his flat, his family, the flight back to Boston, training camp. “Maybe I should sell this place,” he mused to the ceiling.
Despite Sherlock’s willingness to have John sit on his face the whole night if it pleased him—and given the grunts, sighs, and curses streaming from John’s mouth, it seemed to—soon enough John rearranged them so he was kneeling between Sherlock’s wide-spread thighs, running hands up the lengths of them, massaging Sherlock’s quadriceps muscles through the rough silk of his trousers. At last he took Sherlock’s prick in his mouth, not deep but sucking hard, licking wet spirals around Sherlock’s crown, nodding and humming and—
“No doubt because it was I who would pay him,” he offered in reply to John’s non sequitur. John humphed a sour laugh.
Of course Sherlock was plainly aware he was the cat looking to get itself killed through self-indulgent curiosity; always had been. Inching closer, half-out of the shadows, eventually donning a third or less of some disguise or other and walking straight into the thick of it. Thugs and schemers looking at him through narrowed eyes, knives no doubt folded inside their pockets, if not already in their hands. Now and then there was a foot chase, a climb up an aged and rusty fire escape, a dog trained to go for the bollocks. It was a damned shame his body was betraying him by beginning to break down when he was as keen to take on all comers as he had been at twenty-five. His reflexes were slower—still quicker than most—and his eyes and ears were becoming alarmingly lazy. Danger was intrinsic; a knock on the head now and then was a good reminder that he must stay alert and on his toes. And perhaps not go alone to a counterfeiter’s warehouse in the earliest hours of a Tuesday morning.
There was little need for them to ever leave their sunny, wide-open pavilion room. The entire point of the trip being to spend time alone together, completely relaxed and removed from reality, they’d made sure everything they could possibly want was included or would be billed later, so whether they went to one of the resort’s restaurants, or the bar, or the clubhouse beside the golf course (“You play?” “I know it’s practically required, but I don’t have the patience for it.” “Agreed; boring as fuck.”), or ordered their meals delivered to the table on the sundeck or even directly to their bed, they had no care at all for any of it. Even the gratuities were paid offstage. By the third day, they’d been in two pools, three times in the ocean (once in full moonlight), drunk local rum and French champagne, and Sherlock had got a little sun on his nose and shoulders. They’d slept whenever and for as long as they wanted, sometimes dozing on lounge chairs or in bed, their eyes growing heavy as they read or gazed out at the endless turquoise sea and the expansive pastel sky.
“A day in bed with you is one of the best things I can think of, and I am in no way complaining,” John told him, “But tomorrow we’re going to find something to do. Out there in the world. Something new and interesting and that we won’t soon forget.”
John was acutely aware that cinnamon-sprinkled cappuccinos in paper cups were not in his meagre budget, but it was the first properly cold day of winter, and he’d left his gloves in the flat. His fingers were stiff with cold and a tasty hand-warmer would not go amiss, even if it did cost him three pounds he really could not afford to part with.
Sherlock settled in his armchair, and poured himself a swallow of port though he did not lift the glass from the little table.
Still, every night the bed was too warm and the room was too cold, and John was not there, or was there and breathing loudly, or there and—as at the present moment—distractingly silent. Sherlock could hear his own pulse in his temple when he lay on his side, feel it in the pad of his finger when he lay on his back. Louder still was the sound of pills and cocaine and god-knew-what-else in the bottom of Alex George’s shave bag, generally no more than two rooms away.  The nagging rattle of it—an itch in his ear and at the inside of his elbow—was a too-constant, muffled buzz in the distant back of his mind, which occasionally crescendoed, fell away once more to barely audible irritation, but never truly subsided.
“Haven’t seen Jordan tonight,” one of the men offered, and pulled out his mobile, started tapping at its screen. “I’ll text him and see if he’s coming.”
Sherlock had only forty minutes before the bus to the arena, and so decided to jump ahead to the good parts.
“Sherlock!” she squealed, too loud right beside his ear. “Is your leg finally better? Me and Dadda got pizza. I brought clothes and some of my cats just in case I can stay. Can I stay tonight? Dadda said he wasn’t sure.”
Sherlock’s fingers jigged agitation against the door handle. There was an alley, unfenced car park, residential road under construction—
“You could write your own,” Sherlock said, a bit indignantly. How dare anyone assume his man was not articulate and brainy, just because he’d gone to the NHL instead of university?
Sherlock was surprised to hear it; John was passionate about the issue of head trauma in hockey, was in a unique position to raise awareness and possibly even spur change, and thus far had seemed to be enjoying his appearances. Sherlock made a questioning noise, prompting him to go on.
Mrs Holmes threw a dismayed expression John’s way. To his credit, he only smiled at her apologetically. Accepting it was futile to argue, Sherlock’s mother only rapped two knuckles on the shut door of his father’s little study, and called through it, “Sherlock and John will soon be going; come out and say goodbye.”
John opened his mouth to protest. Closed it again. At last, he said, “Yeah. Probably something like that.”
John looked stunned, smiling, but didn’t reply. His hand clamped hard around Sherlock’s, and he lifted it to press a kiss against Sherlock’s knuckles.
A "bye week" is a week off during the season (part of the players' union collective bargaining agreement), usually in late January or early- to mid-February.
“I actually have no idea, but now that it’s out there, I guess I’d better find something.” He laughed a bit, and reached for his phone, began typing with his thumb, narrating carefully, “Fun. Unforgettable. Things to do. . .near me.”
The judge frowned as if searching her memory. “Can’t say I’ve met anyone by that name. Is that your dad?”
He worried about losing his job. He could be traded, demoted to second string in some far-off city he’d never get used to because Boston was the closest the US had to his beloved, longed-for London—and even it was not all that close. He could get busted down to Bridgeport; the thought of making such a distinctly-backward step made him queasy. He was worried about his stats. His reputation. His shot at more trophies, more championships, time to sort out his post-retirement career, which no longer seemed necessarily years off. It had been a long time since he’d been so preoccupied, so anxious, so sleepless.
The kettle had boiled and as it switched itself off there was a sudden absence of noise in the room. Jordan poured the water into the teapot, grinning mildly.
“Never a bad idea,” Sherlock said, by way of agreement. He smirked. “So you should leave ten minutes before me, to arrive at the same time.”
Sherlock sniffed. “Not a bit; we’ve got at least a hundred and fifty items left on that list of things you wanted us to do together. In any event, addicts aren’t allowed to be bored.”
John favoured him with a kiss on the temple, and they set aside their near-empty glasses, drawing each other low and close, the only sounds the crack and rustle of the fire and insects and frogs singing to let each other know they’d survived the day.
John nodded and they fell silent. Sherlock kept an eye on him, though John’s gaze shifted about the place as if it was unfamiliar: the cold ashes in the fire, the recently-dusted bookshelf, the threadbare place on the rug. He looked at his watch.
Still lingering on the mattress edge, before John had even set his feet on the floor, his attention was caught by gentle, gliding music from. . .somewhere. His phone was dark and silent. Laptop closed and cold on the table. Was there a radio in the room he hadn’t noticed before? Under the bed?
John tilted the phone once more, and breathed, “Now you.” Sherlock searched for a good angle, giving John a fairly close view of his curled fingers and thumb pumping up and down in a loose fist.
A car was summoned, and arrived mercifully soon—thankfully not driven by one of Mrs Holmes’s pensioner friends supplementing her post-retirement income—and John went on being charming and jovial, ingratiating himself even to Sherlock’s father, who deigned to walk with them as far as the foyer. In the end, though, Sherlock’s mother stood alone on the front step, waving them goodbye.
Sherlock tilted his phone’s screen, though no one on the team bus was paying him the least attention. A glance out the window let him know they were already rolling up the hotel drive.
He panted himself toward normal. Reached for the lamp and squinted against the sudden brightness. It might be midnight or just before dawn. He shivered; he wasn’t cold.
“For oh, so many reasons.” Sherlock leaned forward and passed a business card to the driver. “This address; thank you.”
She nodded her blonde head vigorously, which only served to emphasise the fact of her hair growing straighter and darker with each passing season. Sherlock felt something like disappointment about this change in her, though he could not properly explain why he should feel anything about it other than interested. He’d spent the past seven years observing continual changes in everything about her except the smell of her neck, requiring him to form a new set of deductions daily—sometimes every few hours. Lately he wondered what interim transformations he had missed at the in-between times, and the wondering was edged in lavender-grey.
“Kept us together too long,” John said, with a tilt of his chin toward Sherlock’s hands working at the buckle of his belt. “This.”
After what seemed like endless insults against which Sherlock was not permitted to defend himself, only nod and hum, parrot back what was said using fresh phrases, to let Coach know he was listening and understood, at last their plates were empty and Lestrade waved off the waitress’s offer of more coffee, requesting the bill.
By the time John sat back in his chair to stretch, and looked up at the clock on the kitchen wall (due to Sherlock’s influence, Rosie was the only child in her class who could tell time on an analog clock, and who understood the meaning of “quarter to” and “eight minutes past”), it was already well after eleven.
Sherlock’s throat thickened with grief, and anger flared in his chest. “It’s not my intention to steal her from you, John,” he said, perhaps too sharply.
“One-on-one time with Razor.” Andy Raynham was the head goalie-coach. “I think a couple of the equipment guys are going to take some shots.”
“Mycroft was already away at the boarding school he applied to and arranged all on his own; he’ll tell you it was because of his single-minded determination to make something of himself, but the truth is he would have gone anywhere not to be trapped here with my father while we were in Finland. Enoch came with us but foundered. He and my father were bachelors together.”
Sherlock roughed up his crease, moved quickly east to west, setting himself as if to stop or catch pucks every few inches until he’d made six imaginary saves: wrist shot, backhand, slap shot; wrist shot, backhand, slap shot.
Mrs Hudson was elderly; she probably ate her supper at half-four and was in bed by six. No need to bother her.
Lestrade carried on as if Sherlock had not cracked the grim joke. “Too bad about LoPresti’s streak but he asked not to start, and if he’s not a hundred percent, I’m not going to risk putting him in.”
“Iain disagrees with you about that section of my speech you said you liked. He wants to cut it. And about half of the next section, as well. Apparently my youth is less interesting than I thought.”
Sherlock have said, since he had said nothing? John looked away from her probing gaze while he lied. “He said,
John pulled a face of exaggerated sympathy and cooed, “Poor you.” He pressed four fingers into the midsole of Sherlock’s right foot, squeezed, and dragged. Sherlock let go a moan; the sensation bordered on erotic.
John felt his eyebrows crumple. “How long ago?” he asked, gathering the history to put in the chart. “I’ll have a feel of it?”
John laughed, humourless but wistful. “Not remotely. She read paperbacks on the sofa. Wine in a coffee cup. Sister Kim did the shopping, cooked the meals.”
Sherlock, who had not taken so much as an aspirin in five years, thought a handful of anything chased with a bottle of cabernet was just the solution he needed. Immediately following that thought was a fresh wave of panic, and he braced himself with one hand on the wet tile wall, hung his head and tried to breathe through his nose, waiting for the vomit to rise again.
It didn’t occur to John to argue; he was already shrugging his coat on. “What are you shopping for?” he asked, as the two made their way toward the heavy front door.
Rosie dropped dramatically across the red chair in the sitting room, starfish-shaped with the toes of her new, white sandals just brushing the rug.
John’s mouth hung open, and his glass hung in the air in front of his chest. He wasn’t sure why he was allowing Sherlock to talk to him in such a fashion, as if they were that sort of friends. Or as if John was a science experiment Sherlock was reporting on. He sipped the whiskey again and put the topic aside. Anyway, he was distracted by another odd thing that was going on just then.
Mercifully, John finished the book and slid it aside. There was cold tea left in Sherlock’s cup. He tilted it on its saucer, watching the liquid shapeshift.
“Ludicrous but perhaps necessary,” Sherlock replied, and they danced around each other as Sherlock went for the kettle and John plated takeaway sushi from the organic supermarket, irreverently accompanied by cranberry and pecan-studded bread rolls with butter, and two ginger beers in brown glass bottles—a real bachelors’ feast.
“Ah, light bulb,” John said, inexplicably fumphering. “My uh,” he threw a thumb over his right shoulder to indicate his flat downstairs. “Lamp. Wondered if you have a light bulb I can borrow. Or. Have.” He cleared his throat again. “I suppose.”
“Maybe so,” Raynham allowed, though Sherlock felt he was being patronised. “But I’m looking at where the pucks are getting by you, and we can’t ignore there’s a weak spot. The rest of your game looks good. But if we can just dig into this issue a little, and at least rule out some possible reasons, we might figure out how to make sure you look good all over the net, you know?”
“Meeting Iain for a working coffee before I go to the office. Caravan to Providence for a lunch thing.” Half of the information was called back to Sherlock over John’s shoulder as he crossed into the sitting room. “These are the ones,” he confirmed, and after a moment appeared in the bedroom doorway once more, paperwork in hand. All the irritation gone from his voice now that he’d got what he needed, he sat on the edge of the bed to tie his shoes and reported, “We’re giving three hundred helmets to the city youth leagues.”
John silenced him with another kiss, fiercer, hiding his amusement at being teased—not very well—in a show of his ongoing virility. Sherlock was more than willing to go along.
John undressed them quickly, breaking up the progress with more harsh kisses, bites with his teeth on Sherlock’s neck, and his lower lip, and his wrist. By the time they were naked, Sherlock was aching, rising slow but steady. John was rampant, and ran hands possessively over Sherlock’s body from shoulder to hip, and down around his backside, kneading and nudging, tucking his fingers intimately. They arranged themselves on the bed, finding their old places, with the covers kicked down to the foot. Left the lamp on.
Rosie did eventually need the restroom, and Sherlock stood waiting for her outside the ladies’, tugging his bottom lip with fingertips and thumb. He was reminded of the way in which he had trained himself to assess her needs, long before she was able to reliably express them with any level of nuance (in her earliest days she had three settings: asleep, eating, and shrieking, which indicated a pressing need Sherlock then had to tick through his list to deduce). He had subdivided the complex question,
“Sore?” John grinned, a bit devilishly, which Sherlock thought a bit cruel; he very well knew how painful the first day at training camp could be. He loosened his necktie and top two shirt buttons, ignored the tea in favour of lifting Sherlock’s calves in his hands so they could share the sofa. He went straight to work massaging Sherlock’s bare feet. “Blister there. I told you to break in those trainers a bit more.”
“No need this early in the season to make a fuss about not getting enough starts. I’ve got over eight hundred starts, career-long. Missing a handful is nothing to—”
“Shoulder’s fine. Grip’s fine.” Sherlock was beyond frustrated; there was no reason for him to be missing pucks at all, let alone in one particular area of his goal. “It just depends where I am; they get me low to the glove side and I can’t get across fast enough. Or they’re shooting backhands and even they don’t know where the hell that’s going to end up.”
It was John’s turn to nod. His gaze was ravenous; Sherlock longed to force his tongue into John’s open mouth, hold his head, push him back and back and—fuck’s sake, the wall was a day’s walk from where they stood. It really was a hideous place. John’s voice snapped Sherlock back to the more imperative, present discussion. “I was thinking—listen—thinking about holding your throat while you suck him off. Touching your face. Guiding you by the hair.”
A few hours later, they were in a taxi on the way back to Baker Street. Sherlock had spotted his man shortly after they found a vantage point from which to view the techie’s home, texted his police contact, and sent John to spill the contents of his pockets on the pavement in front of him, a distraction just long enough for Sherlock to pick his pocket. A handful of useless computer parts, and a scrap of paper torn only in half, bearing the address from where they’d been pilfered. A pair of women’s red-soled sandals in the gym bag he carried—he hadn’t even gotten far enough away to ditch them—and a shimmer of tears in his eyes as the cops descended. Amateur.
“If not that, he’s got some highly specific erotic fixation involving unnecessary corrective procedures. Either way: interesting.”
Urgent and taut, a hand guiding his and his hand guiding with no need for guidance because they know each other to the core, have known each other inside and out and inside-out, for years, and forever. Quick kisses and hectic breath and, “Yes, that’s it. . .oh god yes, I love feeling you. . .
SH: It’s only been a few weeks, and since school’s out for summer, there’s not a lot of interaction. The league put out a nice statement of support, not for us specifically, of course. But I think it clarified the culture a bit. It’s a been a few years since they started the “Hockey is for Everyone” promotion, and I for one was relieved to learn that when faced with a practical test of its theoretical support for queer people, the league rose to the challenge of walking its talk.
“No,” Sherlock murmured, and John went back to caressing and arranging the waves of hair no doubt running wild across his forehead.
“I’d rather be a hockey player,” John said simply, not much in it, but Sherlock felt it like a punch in the gut. He slid his hand up along John’s spine to cup his hand around the back of his neck. He worked his thumb against the back corner of John’s jaw, and John let him for a moment, but then rose and walked away, and shut himself behind the bathroom door. Sherlock, feeling useless and lost for words even though none had been asked for, gathered the by-then empty dishes and carried them to the sink, an endeavour that required two trips. He was reaching for a knife to slice the cake when John emerged, rubbing his forehead with fingers and thumb.
He never failed to find interest—if not downright intrigue—in the exploded disconnection of even the boldest, inkiest type under powerful magnification. Spaces so small they were invisible to the naked eye, and even to the enhanced one, but which gaped when viewed through a microscope’s lenses. Ink fell into crevasses and floated over ragged threads—sawdust—once the leg of an insect. Paper was technology, as well, and so was ink, printing, the rollers that churned out the evening news, the binding of his most treasured books. Not all bad, then, and he didn’t use that thumb for much, anyway.
Sherlock felt a panic welling up, like the urge to vomit, but he nodded and pursed his lips against an instinct to protest that it was his day to collect her. Bending to retrieve the crumpled letter, he smoothed it between his fingers and thumbs.
John needed a light bulb for the reading lamp standing behind the armchair in his flat (not “his armchair” because it was too new to him, and too narrow, and the seat was too high, with tired springs). He told himself it was too late go up the road and round the corner to the shop; even walking at his newly-normal pace he’d likely just miss closing time. If the shop closed at the top of the hour, which it might do. Instead of braving the cold after dark, he figured he’d be a stereotypical neighbour and ask to borrow a cup of sugar. Or in this case, a lightbulb.
Sherlock returned leading a shorter, older man wearing a long camel-coloured cashmere coat and dark red muffler. The composer.
“I don’t usually see a man more than once,” he’d said, even as Steven was already unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt, backing him across the open-plan living space toward the back of the flat where the bedroom was stocked with condoms and lubricant and more ink-on-paper pornography than Sherlock thought necessary in the internet age.
“I don’t know how.” It was hideous how something true could sound like nothing but a lie. “I wanted to speak to you about it first, before anything went down in writing. But—”
. It had been ages since they’d worked a case together; their easy simpatico, the back-and-forth play of their complimentary puzzle-solving skills, even the shape of John’s forehead as he frowned over the work were all things Sherlock had greatly missed, even before John moved out of Baker Street. Working with John again had been the most pleasant two-hour stretch they’d spent together in longer than Sherlock could remember. Seeing John so engaged, reading up in his spare time, had made Sherlock smile to himself, despite himself. And then John had wrecked it.

Sherlock, by then nearly finished with his breakfast, scraped up the last forkful of eggs and potatoes from his plate and used speaking through the resultant mouthful as an indication of casualness. “Talking of health and safety,” he began, “What’s Doc giving out in the way of sleep aids these days? Do you know?”
He'd never grown tired of John’s kisses, never refused them even when he was furious. Indeed, kisses given in a fury—or afterward, as an apology—were just as deliciously teasing, worshipful, as any John ever bestowed. Fighting with himself, still, even after his decision to surrender to the comfortable heat they so easily generated, John fell away humming and licking his lips dry. In a breath’s time he was back, though, tongue-tip curling up to stroke Sherlock’s lip, pressing forward, tugging back with the edges of his teeth. Sherlock held tighter to his hand, and pulled,
John chuckled, closed-eyed, and shook his head. As ever, one could only do one’s best to explain complex situations and ideas to even the brightest child, and never anticipate quite how the information would be processed.
The Year Twos bounced out of the door nearest where John was waiting, and he waited for Rose’s teacher to see and acknowledge him, grant Rose permission to come to him. She gave an expressive, comic performance of surprise.
The next day was a game day against the New Jersey Demons at home, followed by a flight to play the Vikings in the Brawlers’ last game before their short holiday break of Christmas eve, Christmas day, and Boxing day. Sherlock had not been told whether he would get his tensely-awaited start, but he doubted so, given that LoPresti was on a hot streak and Sherlock was still letting shots go in over his right shoulder in practice sessions. John could not arrange a flight in time to attend the game against the Vikings;  Sherlock would meet him in Hamilton for Christmas eve and the next morning with his sister Kim.
But of course, inevitably, despite his best intentions not to, Sherlock opened his eyes. John was just as Sherlock knew he would be: straining, moaning, open-mouthed and utterly unguarded.
By the time Sherlock located his phone and lifted it to where it belonged, John’s face was once more visible on the screen, a sweetly stupid grin soft on his lips.
Beneath it all, a greeting-card sized envelope, almost square, of thick, rough paper in a tasteful shade of dark red. On the front, elegantly hand-lettered in gold ink,
“Firstly, not ‘just’ a hockey player—one of the best defensemen to play the game. And I know, I’ve studied.” Sherlock smirked. “And you are somewhat of an expert, having had your bell rung several times. Advocacy is just a name for what you’re doing: speaking out on behalf of others not in a similar position to do so. Expert and advocate. Tick, and tick.” Sherlock flicked thumb and forefinger through the air, ticking imaginary boxes.
Sherlock blew across his phone screen, clearing off specks of fallen hair. The barber pulled too hard at a lock behind his neck; Sherlock grunt-growled his displeasure.
“I promise I will not smoke cigarettes. Are you a police officer? Putting the petnapper under arrest?”
, he thought. John’s mouth widened to swallow him deep, velvety tongue curved to fit, and Sherlock cried out, swept away and shameless.
make messy suggestions they involve others. The buzz and hum of a busy, echoing room quickly increased in volume as the two rounded a corner. John held up his hand. “Shut up, nevermind. Anyway, she wasn’t expecting you; you can go.”
John’s face rumpled in that affectionate way it sometimes did, all the best lines in his face appearing as he grinned at Sherlock. He tugged at Sherlock’s trousers. “Let’s get naked,” he suggested, no growl in it at all, “And c’mere. Just come here close to me,
