“Well, first off,” Castiel continued, his eyes fixated on Dean’s chest. “This is a sober house—so there will be no alcohol here during the duration of our chosen stay.”
Castiel shook his head. “There is an aura of animus emitting from him. One I cannot tell if it is tied to his own aura via hatred—be it self or towards another—or if the aura was cast upon him through an act of malice. Either way, I see both the Aura and his warding has dampened your Witchcraft’s total effect.”
“Finally, the most important thing of all, is…” Castiel took a deep breathe, then looked away from Dean. “Is…”
“FINE!” Abigail said with a loud huff. “I’ll get right on that too!” Without a second’s delay, Abigail snatched ahold of the Impala’s keys from her sister’s finger and clenched them tightly in her fist. “But that means I am NOT responsible for cleaning upstairs! That’s on you and Kora!”
From behind the corner emerged the witch, who in question was still using her powers effortlessly to her advantage to manipulate the surroundings around her. Choosing carefully to lift Dean’s limp body in front of her like a shield, the witch glared down the hallway, ready to strike at a moment’s notice the very second she saw her prey.
Abigail snapped her fingers, and Sam Winchester was immediately smashed into the ground by an overwhelming spectral force. However, unlike the gravitational force that he had encountered prior that he knew the witch Kora controlled, the spectral force itself felt much different. It felt cold, heavy and concussive; as if he had just been hit by a stockpile of iron chains. Then, shortly after he hit the ground, Sam felt each of his limbs be pulled taut; preventing him from budging even the slightest inch. It was painful and yet at the same time, beyond unnerving—because it was not so much of a physical pain, much like any normal iron chain would inflict—but it was a harrowing experience that seemed to abrade both Sam’s very mind and soul. A sensation that was far too similar to one that Sam felt long ago and was forced to endure time and time again in his nightmares during the darkest of his sleepless nights. The very same sensation of the bindings used on Hell’s torture rack.
“How so Cas…” Dean grumbled, putting the impala in park before shutting off the engine. “What—we have a little sleepover, braid Sam’s hair, watch scary movies in one room, then play stupid college games like ‘ultimate frisbee?’ Please, I rather just go out drinking…”
“Yah, and you drove for 7 hours after me—following our stay at that crappy motel—so now it’s my turn again!” Dean sputtered. “I’m all good to drive once more! So if Sam would just stop at the next rest stop in Baker, then I could…”
“Cas is an all knowing, powerful celestial being who has survived worse than just being petrified in place!” Sam snapped. “But James is human, like us. And if these witches are the same ones that are taking out Seasoned Hunters with ease—then James doesn’t stand a chance! Especially if he is the one they are hunting!”
Instantly both Sam and Dean hit the ground with a thud. Shortly following that, their bindings and torture slowly started to wain. Their senses gradually returned to normal and their breathing stabilized, permitting them to recuperate in what seemed to be a short moment of relief. And as a result, both were able to see the figure the voice belonged to; along with another familiar face that always brought solace to them regardless of their current troubles.
Before Dean could even react, Sam watched in horror as he saw his brother be pulled away by the same strange, gravitational force that had ensnared them before. Choosing this time to thrash Dean against the ceiling and back onto the ground repeatedly until he himself was struck unconscious, the gravitational force separated the two Winchesters; leaving Sam to fend for himself.
Abigail turned around and headed towards the garage, grumbling to herself as she walked under her breath. Time and time again her words almost became loud enough to be interpreted by those nearest her, but in the end the fragments of words uttered were too ambiguous in nature to be understood coherently. Nevertheless, though it seemed that Abigail was frustrated with her sister—for a scowl was ever present on her lovely face as she journeyed forth to accomplish her next task—Abigail did not dare challenge Fiona’s command. She knew much better to do so.
“Then thanks a lot, Cas! You just condemned me!” Dean sneered. “You just condemned me to a living Hell where I am forced to listen to the same set of songs endlessly over and over again for eternity so that I can pay for a handful of sins that I didn’t even commit!” Dean threw himself back into his seat, then twisted his head around so that he could glare out the window; forcefully attempting to drown out all he heard by force of will. “Some best friend you are!”
“Dean, he was just concerned about us,” Castiel interjected. “Show a little compassion. He is your brother after all.”
“Cas says,” Sam muttered. “‘This place is—warded too.’” Dean grunted, then shook his head. “Then it is just as you thought Sammy.” Dean said slowly. “James might be in danger.”
It was a text from Castiel. One that was not only recent, but it looked like it was written in a panic too.
Without a second breath, Kora replied to her sister almost instantaneously with what seemed to be a preordained response. “Would you rather me set him on fire then?” The witch with the leather-hide spaulders asked. “I do hear Hunter’s make good kindling.”
Wesson winced. “It...might.” Wesson turned to Castiel. “Healer Castiel, when you administered Blessed Water to Dean, was there ever a time it was water blessed by anyone other than yourself?”
Dean grimaced slightly. “I probably could have done it either way, but...I was a bit hungry—and still recovering. I just didn't want to take any chances I didn't need to.”
not going to happen.” He wrinkled his nose. “Though I suppose I'm also not entirely sure what that would be, exactly. Probably Sam
Dean took Castiel's hands in a firm grip, seeking Castiel's gaze. “I have you.” Ducking his head, Dean pressed his lips to Castiel’s hands. With a little shrug he murmured, voice rough, “You’re the best option I could ever ask for.”
“At least we figured it out, huh?” Dean pressed a soft kiss to Castiel's lips. “Honestly,” Dean admitted, “loving you has been one of the simplest things in my life so far.” He'd never struggled with it like Castiel had, for years of agony, because, well, Dean had known right from the start that Castiel loved him back. It wasn't fair, but it had just been so much easier from Dean's side of things. And everything with Castiel, the kissing and talk of marriage and all of that, had just felt so
“I was drunk!” Dean protested, shoving off the wall and following Castiel back through the kitchen towards the side door. Apparently they were heading to Dean's house, finally. Shower and panties, or something like that. Whatever Castiel didn't insist on saving for their wedding night. “How many times do I need to remind you how very drunk I was when I said all that stupid shit?”
“Yeah, as a friend,” Dean countered. “A fully platonic guy friend who happens to be gay and likes to cuddle sometimes, because apparently that's totally normal and healthy.” The remaining beer in Dean's bottle sloshed as he gestured with it. “He made it very clear that he doesn't want to marry me and have a bunch of kids together.”
After a while Dean released Castiel's finger and lightly kissed the tip. Castiel couldn't help smiling as he quietly drew the touch of power needed to heal the wound.
Dean wrapped his arm around Castiel's shoulders, tugging him a bit closer. Pressing a kiss to Castiel's hair, Dean whispered, “I love you.”
“Don’t know what that is, and I don’t care.” Dean replied. “I’ll take my chances. The only thing I know is he better be a good cook and host, or we will not be staying here again!”
with a twist of his head. “She helped me,” Castiel replied. “Just as she is here to help James as well.”
“I sense this is not the first time he has seen an Angel nor any other supernatural being.” Castiel muttered. “Also, when I gazed into his eyes, the amount of life experience I sensed he has gone through is almost triple of what it should be.” Castiel pressed his cheek into his fist next as he leisurely leaned to his right. “He is, as one once put it, ‘an old soul.’ One who has lived countless lifetimes, despite the limitation of their fixed mortality.”
“Not going to happen, Dean!” Castiel snapped. “You didn’t sleep a wink while I drove!” Castiel reached down into his trench coat’s pocket and pulled out a cassette tape with both his index and middle finger. Waving it back and forth in the air as he displayed it to Dean while he spoke, Castiel shook his head with mild grimace. “Though you said you would sleep during my turn behind the wheel, I know you were just pretending to sleep!” Castiel balked. “You were listening silently with a grin on your face as I played my choice of music for the road trip!”
“DRIVE, DEAN!” Sam ordered again. “What Cas meant was, ‘James is in the Crossfire!’” Sam lurched forward and shoved Dean back into the Driver’s seat away from Castiel. “And what he sensed was most likely witches! The very same perhaps that I was talking about when we arrived!”
,” Dean said, taking two exasperated steps closer to Castiel. “It wasn't just—some drunk thing. And I did mean it. Well, parts of it. I meant the important parts.” He winced, closing his eyes and tipping his head backwards. Why was he so
“But I more meant like...where's Cas?” Sam frowned slightly. “Don't you usually bring him along on these sorts of things?”
remember! That's—the sort of thing you'd think maybe a kid would remember! Right? No kid is looking to get 'disowned' by their own father. I don't think we really knew what it meant, but it sure sounded bad.” Dean rubbed one shaking hand over his mouth. “It sounded a whole lot like 'unwelcome and unaccepted'. So you know what? You don't get to lecture
gets to find out that you've changed your mind, done a total one-eighty. Now you're all 'I love my gay son' here.”
, Dean.” John looked down at his shoes. “Whatever I said in the past, there wasn't a moment of your life I could have abandoned you.”
“It's all right.” Dean knelt before Castiel and something in his posture suggested he'd continue to wait as long as Castiel asked. Something helpless tugged at Dean's smile as he added, “Just glad to have you back.”
“This transformation took place,” Tran commented, “at the moment Dean took a significant blow from the Shade.” He folded his hands on the tabletop. “Perhaps the transformation had more to do with the Shade's nature than with Dean's.”
Castiel hummed, folding his hands in his lap. “I suppose that is a typical time to start thinking about such things.”
“It can also be useful,” Dean shot back. Grimacing, he looked away. “Look, Crowley made sure no one would get...seriously hurt. I insisted on that, and as far as I saw no one did.” Crouching down, he sought Castiel's eyes, one hand gently touching Castiel's face. “Cas, are you angry with me?”
The guard caught Castiel's arm to steady him as he stepped onto the platform and Castiel murmured, “Thank you,” before realizing just how strange that was.
“I suppose you did,” Castiel said, pulling back to create some marginal space between their bodies. “It's just that...last week you said...”
With an annoyed huff, Castiel rolled his eyes. “In my youth there were some times when I did through inexperience cause some minor harm, but none of that was within this jurisdiction.”
“I have no idea what I feel,” Dean said, shaking his head. “I just...” He sighed, turning a wobbly sort of smile on Castiel. “I want...a lot...to spend the rest of my life with you. Is that—is that stupid?”
Sam stared at Dean until Dean was about to snap at him and then finally Sam said, “What universe have I been living in?”
Walking over quietly, Dean sat next to Castiel and placed a gentle hand on Castiel's thigh, warm through the thin material of his pyjama pants. “Cas, I am so sorry.”
“Well, I'm open to almost anything,” Dean admitted. “I can't guarantee I'll be any good at much. Well, I'm good at hand-jobs, but what guy isn't? I'm sure that doesn't exactly...set me apart.”
More than anything, Castiel just wanted to see Dean. To tell Dean how very proud he was of him and how much he loved him. Had Castiel ever properly expressed that?
, Sammy!” Dean lets out an exasperated breath. “You and I are never going to have a conversation with these words in it. That is not a reality that exists.”
“Okay, so, uh, there isn't enough room,” Sam points out, putting his hands on his hips and looking around the room as if maybe he's missed some key piece of floor-space somewhere. They're trying to lay out bedrolls, and they've already stuck the chairs and stump-stools they used for supper out on the porch. They'd take the kitchen cupboards out, but they're a bit too attached and no one thought to bring a crowbar. And Sam really is just so damn
at this? “Cas, I swear to God I am stone cold sober right now,” he tried, meeting Castiel's eyes. “I had a couple of beers with Sam last night but all I've had to drink so far today other than water was a cup of coffee. And...I still want to marry you; that was nothing to do with being drunk.”
“Yeah, uh.” Dean pushed himself up to follow Castiel to the door, head feeling fuzzy. Maybe he'd been this fuzzy the whole time and not minded. That was the point of alcohol, after all. “Maybe we could, uh, hang out tomorrow. If you're not busy.”
“What, you mean because of this?” Dean looked down at himself with a bashful smile. “This was just easier—I can make myself pretty again.” To prove his point he shifted into his fae form. He offered Castiel a smile. “See?”
Instantly Dean was thrust into the air and pinned against the ceiling. Held in place thereafter by the otherworldly gravitational force that the witch controlled, Dean glared back downward and cursed. “Son of a Bitch!” Dean spat. “Let me go!”
Succeeding with his effort to wrestle the gun away from Dean, even though it was somewhat pointless now, Castiel swore under his breath. “Jesus, Dean…” Castiel grumbled, before confiscating Dean’s firearm, only then to quickly place it in his trench coat’s right pocket. “You are a piece of work.”
“I’m gonna shoot you between the eyes when I get out of these bindings!” Dean grunted, as he struggled to get free. “Then I’m gonna cremate you both, before I choose to bury what remains of you at sea for what you did to Sammy and Me!”
“Ya yah, Samantha! We get it, you have feelings… And you feel like you neglected your friend and so on.” Dean grumbled. “But I still don’t see why we gotta drive all the way to California to visit him when you could have just did another Zoom meeting and called it even!”
Though Sam could not see the expression of pride on Castiel’s face following speaking his own statement aloud about sharing the family’s last name, it did not matter. But even after introducing both himself and his family properly, it did not stop Fiona from displaying the same quirk now and then as she had once done before, prior to inspecting Sam’s phone. Overall, the more Sam talked, he soon noticed that it seemed to cause Fiona an ever growing sense of uncertainty. One that she could just not shake.
“Bout time you two decided to join us,” Sam muttered, as he leered at both his brother and Castiel from across the living room. “I was starting to wonder what unholy things you two were doing together in the impala alone.”
“Damn it Cas, I said LET GO!” Dean grunted. “He’s got a—” Blinking twice to confirm what he saw before continuing, Dean narrowed his eyes and sneered. “A—”
Castiel’s facial expression shifted, alerting Dean that he was now confused more than he was before.
“And I’m out of fresh, green leaf teabags too! Freaking, Damn it!” James spat, before slamming the kitchen pantry door shut with a bang. “This is all I need right now, post three 14 hour shifts back to back!”
Pushing his brother aside so that he could examine Castiel without hinderance, Sam lurched himself forward and sighed. “Give Castiel a chance to recover before you go shaking him.” Sam said. “I’m just as worried as you.”
James abruptly shifted in place to face Dean. And when he did, the hauntingly familiarity struck home.
Refusing to disobey Dean, Castiel did as he was told and turned his focus onto Sam. Repeating the same process, the blue-eyed angel began his slow inspection. “Are you hurt Sam?” Castiel muttered. “You don’t look well.”
Castiel shook his head, then let out a loud sigh. “If you excuse me, Lady Fiona—I would like to intervene before Dean does something he regrets.” Castiel muttered. “So I best take my leave.” The blue-eyed angel bowed his head next, stood up, and departed.
Ignoring the rabble, possible threat and all, the motorcyclist pulled whatever he was trying to fish out of his pocket and held it up high into the air before him.
“Almost,” Sam replied, glancing at brother in the rear view mirror from the driver’s seat. “We still have few hours or so before we reach our destination. So try and bear it a little longer.”
The witch talking was about six feet or taller in height and of average build. Her hair was long, black and curly, and her skin was dark-copper in tint. And though she seemed to be dressed casually in a modern day vest, medium sized dress and peach colored high-heels, the witch had a tribal-like pair of leather-hide spaulders resting on top of her shoulders too as well. In the end, though Sam only saw a quick a glimpse of it, the spaulders reminded him of a shamanistic garb that he had read about time and time again somewhere in the countless collection of books in the Man of Letter’s private archive. To why the witch was wearing it although, he was unsure.
“I don’t expect forgiveness, nor do I care if you give it to me or not, Grunt.” Fiona replied, speaking calmly, but also sternly at the same time. “My sisters thought you were Hunters masquerading as escorts of some kind to mask some ill intent. Such as to steal from James, maim him, kill him—or even kidnap him—like other Hunters have tried to do in the past. And to some extent, my sisters were both right in believing that theory…” Fiona then rolled her eyes. “Not that James ever hired an escort before to begin with, nor do I think he would do something so—
“Are you trying to cause a scene and get the neighbors to call the entire bloody police force down here all at once!” The witch continued, her eyes beaming with ire. “I asked you to check on James and inspect whoever his guest were—not KILL and or TORTURE them!”
Dean’s brow furrowed slightly, while his green eyes glistened with ire. “As I said before, Bitch—we didn’t do anything!” Dean glowered. “So get your mind out of the gutter!”
“Then can you at least knock me out or something with your power mojo so I am not forced to listen to this horrid and jarring refrain of lackluster music!”
“Cas…” Dean grunted, easing on gas petal the until the Impala came to an abrupt halt on the neighborhood street. “Cas?” Dean repeated, his heart beginning to beat faster and faster with each passing second. “Come on buddy, you gotta work with me here. You can’t just say, ‘somethin’ is wrong,’ den go dead quiet on me!”
The vein on Dean’s forehead pulsed slightly, then he snarled loudly with anger. “Are you serious right now, Cas? Really?” Dean balked. “You are going to play pacifist while we are in danger with the lone gang member here?” Dean cocked his gun, then slowly readied himself to take aim the second he saw whatever the man was about to pull out of his pocket. “He’s mine.”
“I can see that Cas…” Dean grumbled. “I may be, as Sam so well puts it, ‘emotionally constipated’ most of the time—but I am not a fool. I can tell if someone is lying too.”
“There are many things you still don’t know about me Dean.” Castiel replied, unvexed. “There are still countless secrets I have yet chosen to share with you or Sam. But yes—I can see the fate of one’s soul by looking into their eyes. I am an Angel after all.”
who left the garage door open and the door into the house unlocked too as well!” The witch known as Abigail then snickered to herself, amused by the ironic ignorance of her own sister. “If anything, we both messed up royally!”
Dean unbuckled himself first, then Castiel. Following that, with Sam’s aid, both of the Winchesters pulled Castiel towards the driver’s seat. Lowering him gently, the two brothers positioned Castiel in a recumbent position; thus securing his safety for the moment from an ambush. After that, both brothers drew their guns and exited the Impala.
“Then we’ll improvise, Sam.” Dean replied. “We already know where James is supposedly located in the home. So we’ll make our way up to his room and look for clues there first.” Dean turned to Castiel next. “As for you Cas, since you can’t move and all, Sam and I are gonna lay you down in the front seats so that if the witches come running—they don’t just see you and cast a curse on you.”
Succeeding with his endeavor of threading the leather string, Dean inserted the string through the small glass loop sitting on top of the glass vial containing Castiel’s grace, and tied it snuggly. Thereafter, Dean stood up and walked towards Castiel. Upon reaching him, Dean secured the remaining end of the leather string around Castiel’s bare neck and formed a makeshift necklace. However, before he dared to leave Castiel’s side, Dean quickly made sure the twist-on top of the vial was secure and both ends of the knots were strong enough to support the vial’s weight. Only then did he return back to his seat and continued to sulk.
,” Fiona muttered. “That fixes the most prominent threat—which means the Angel’s life is no longer in danger—but you are still forgetting about the effects of the Hex-Barrier on his grace, which itself is
“So he is like Garth—so to speak…” Dean mumbled. “Great… Would be easier to deal with him if I had a beer to calm my nerves, but sure, let’s see how he differs…”
“I swear Sammy, if the next song is ‘My Heart Will Go On,’ I will die right here and now from a self inflicted stroke or something.” Dean growled. “But not before I smash dat worthless hybrid DVD/CD you ‘had to have’ for your birthday to smithereens!”
“Not that I’m going to complain about the hiding place, Dean,” Sam said with a whisper. “Great quick thinking and all… But of all places, you choose a laundry-closet to hide in? While ironically, you yourself, have yet to still come out of the closet?”
Suddenly Sam felt his phone buzz in his back pocket. Leering over his shoulder as he began to ponder who it was, despite he was already preoccupied at the moment, Sam ignored his phone and continued on with his examination.
Step. Step. Step. Soon, both brothers could start to see a shadow of an approaching figure around the corner of the distant hallway.
“Still, I must say… I am confused Sam.” Castiel said, his voice as low as a whisper. “Why is it we are driving all the way out to California? Is it for a case or something?”
“You’re right,” James muttered. “I did I come from humble beginnings—however what you see does not belong to me. This all belongs to my parents’, and the only reason why I am permitted to live here is because I am currently working a job they approve of and due to the fact I pay rent also. Otherwise, I’d be disowned and cast out onto the streets.”
That moment, both of the Winchester’s phones buzzed again simultaneously. Leering down together at the same time, both brothers read their text as best they could.
“Restituere carne et anima, Et oblinito maledictioni cor tuum, et speculum. ut benedicat e novo. restituere vigorem.” The three witches said one last time. “Novam vitam restituere. Ut benedicat tibi Deus May, James - lupus certatior mi fide!”
“Well, at least I know you can drive,” Dean scoffed from the back seat. “Still, I think you’re not finished Sammy. Baby is still half way in the street—and I’ll be damned if I allow her to be scratched by these crazy California drivers!”
“He is not lying, Dean.” Castiel muttered. “I can sense how much hardship and pain he went through by just looking into his eyes—as well as the wavelength given off by his very soul.”
, you are just too prideful to admit that you let your guard down and got locked out of the house like a common half-wit, Hunter!”
“It is already bad enough that we had to put up a magical barrier to keep all supernatural creatures out—including our allies as well… But now, we have Hunters in our midst?”
…” The witch said with a sneer. “And ‘we’ wouldn’t want that to happen so soon… Because that would be tragic.”
Pausing first for what seemed like a minute or so to allow Dean to counter his statement, Castiel continued to stare at Dean inquisitively, never once blinking while he waited. Following that, Castiel sighed and continued on. “Regardless Dean,” the blue-eyed angel cooed. “You drove for 10 hours straight without pause, blasting your favorite song albums nonstop back to back as you drove 80 miles per hour down the stretch of roads marked out for us by Sam. You need your rest.”
“Hey, I’m not stubborn—Cas!” Dean rebutted. “I’m just highly motivated by my passions not to give up—that is all! As for hypervigilant—maybe… But then again I have to be for you two’s sake. Otherwise you two lovable misfits would be long dead like the ancient dodo.”
“I swear to God, someone—anyone—just kill me now…” Sam muttered, leaning his head forward on the steering wheel. “Please… I can’t handle this anymore…”
The footsteps slowly grew louder, ever echoing continuously in the distance until they themselves were so loud, that Dean swore that it had begun hailing outside.
“From what I remember him telling me Cas, post college, he became a travel nurse.” Sam said, his focus on the road, and yet still on the conversation firsthand. “As well as a Man of Letters, like us—so to speak.”
“Because Hun, unless those two Hunters are as dumb as they look—especially the grunt you seem so enamored with—I suggest you back up and return to my side.” Fiona said, before swiftly reaching into her pocket to retrieve something. “Elsewise, you risk them possibly killing you out of fear.”
“Seriously? You right now are going to preach to me?” Castile asked, raising one eyebrow as he glared back at Dean with a daunting expression. “When you yourself swear more than a navel man explorer?”
Getting up from where he sat, Sam walked over to where James was to comfort his friend as best he could. However, the very second Sam came near, James rebuffed his advance and grit his teeth. “But I don’t need pity, respect nor half-ass concern from anyone!” James huffed. “I never needed it before nor do I care what others think of me. I learned to survive on my own for the longest time and in the end that is all that matters. For I carry my own weight!”
“Oh, do you mean that dark brown-eyed man with the wolf necklace I saw you talking to over the computer on a ‘Doom’ meeting?”
Castiel said nothing. Although, his eyes did shine brightly with a divine glow for a second or two before they returned back to the normal, luminous blue that Dean cherished ever so.
The blood-red sigils painted all over James’s body instantly lit themselves ablaze with a violet hue. Rising up from the area of flesh they were drawn upon thereafter, the blood-red sigils began to thrum loudly.
Emerging from out of the hallway, only then to shamble past both Castiel and Dean in one swift and silent motion, James walked to the kitchen counter with an irked expression. “But knowing him,” James continued, sounding more exhausted than he was exasperated. “The dimwit failed to take stock of the remaining food and other necessities left in the house—again—and as a result, now has to rush to over to the store because he has three extra guest he needs to take care of, excluding himself!”
“I refuse to put his health and safety in peril,” Castiel replied firmly. “If it is a crime to refuse, then I will accept due punishment.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied with a nod. “I mean, I can see a level of appeal there.” A bit of a grimace flickered across his lips and he cleared his throat. “My first time...wasn't exactly planned. At all.” He shifted his grip on the steering wheel. “There were...probably a lot of good reasons why we should have talked things through ahead of time, but you know.” He twitched his shoulders in a small shrug. “We didn't.”
“Speaking of a ‘beach neighborhood,’ where the hell is the freaking beach?” Dean glowered. “All I see here is cramped looking homes and the narrow divides that one dares to call a front yard.”
.” Castiel said, as his eyes began to glow softly divine luminosity. “And despite the unrelenting anguish and anger that enshrouds you—inspired by this corrupt and shameful world—it is these attributes alone that I sense emanate from you unquestionably.”
“But, that is only because James does not drink personally.” Castiel muttered, trying to speak slowly and bluntly so Dean would not misconstrue his words. “So it is, ‘BYOB’—whatever the Hell that means.”
Sam just shook his head, then scrolled back up on his phone to read the other text as best he could; including Dean’s as well. “Arrier…” Sam muttered. “E, it a arrier…”
—” Sam said, coughing abruptly to clear his throat. “Um—well, we’re not… Whatever your sisters thought we were—but we are Hunters—and I guess it is acceptable that there was bound to be some misunderstanding down the line. Although again—we meant James no harm. We ourselves were invited by him alone to come here at his request.” Sam then pulled out his phone and stood up. Opening his prior texts and call records between James and himself before handing his phone to Fiona, Sam smiled and spoke once more. “So like you, please let me introduce myself properly. I am
“Son of a bitch…” Dean grumbled, his mind fogged and his body aching with pain. “Gonna kill dem damn witches when I get my hands on ‘em!”
Without pause, Dean came crashing down head first into the ground. Yet, just as he was about to land and snap his neck upon impact, the second witch, Abigail, used her own magic to freeze Dean in place. Now forced to float aimlessly in midair, unable to move, speak, and just barely able enough to breathe, Dean blinked twice, then grew disgruntled.
Dean grumbled, then swore under his breath; but he did obey. Permitting Sam to proceed first, Dean begrudgingly held himself back as he watched feverishly with panic.
Once both his flank and his front were clear, Dean dashed for the front door and slammed himself against it. Quickly locking the front door before daring to glare out the side window next to it, Dean grinned momentarily.
“Yes, Ma’am!” Abigail replied, sounding somewhat exhilarated. “I tweaked all the warding in the house and added the Angel’s signature to the spellwork formula as you requested. Now he should only feel dampened effects from the Hex-Barrier, as well as from all other hexes we place throughout the area.”
“With all do respect dear eldest sister,” Abigail said sweetly, treading ever carefully as she spoke in effort not to enrage Fiona. “Why are you helping them?” Abigail pointed to both Dean and Sam with her main hand, then swiftly pointed it back onto James next. “Have you forgotten it was their kind who attacked James prior so many times in the past without warning nor rightful cause?”
Before Castiel could even reply, the eldest witch spoke for him. “Ignore him!” The witch said, focusing intently on Kora. “
Slowly Dean pulled up into the driveway of James’s house, his off hand on the wheel of the Impala and his main hand on his best friend. Narrowing his eyes slowly as he examined the area around them, Dean slowly began to list off the abnormalities he noticed quickly out aloud. “The garage is open, and I recall Cas closing it prior before we left.” Dean muttered. “Also if you look forward, the door to the house, which was originally locked by you Sammy before our departure, is now ajar.”
“Alright!” Sam reluctantly said aloud, as he hid behind one of the master bedroom’s closed doors. “I’ll come out, but just hear me out first!”
Dean did not need to be told twice. He swiftly reached back into his pant’s pocket and pulled out his phone.
The motorcyclist didn’t answer. Rather, he just switched off the engine of his ride and turned to stare at Sam with his helmet still on. Choosing to sit sidesaddle on his motorcycle as he glared at Sam with his arms crossed next—his face obscured by the black tint of the helmet’s glass—the motorcyclist listened silently, waiting for Sam to finish his story.
“Is something wrong?” Castiel asked, before glazing back onto Dean for a fleeting moment to see if he was still alright. “Is he hurt or require aid from us?”
“Alright then, Sam.” Dean grumbled. “We’ll drive back to your friend’s place and check if he is safe, but the priority here is still Cas.”
Shouting loudly before James had a chance to speak, Dean stretched out his main hand and pointed at James’s chest with his index finger. “I knew it! Those are my clothes!” Dean yelled. “How the hell did you get them!”
The racket at the front door soon grew louder. Then following a few seconds later, a new sound emerged forth, one that the Winchesters were not prepared to hear.
Then without warning, the figure abruptly stopped; halting right before they had just turned the corner and walked into the brother’s line of fire.
In reply to Sam’s request, he was instantly met with the same pull of the strange, gravitational force that felled Dean prior. Rammed thenceforward into the large wooden door he hid behind, just then to be flung back into the hallway like a common rag-doll, Sam was dragged back towards the witch at high speed. Ever helpless and unable to resist the otherworldly magic thrust upon him like he knew no other.
“Ignore him Cas,” Sam said kindly. “He doesn’t mean any of it. He is just a sore loser—that is all.”
Ignoring the witches, Cas kneeled down next to Dean and gently placed his main hand on the eldest hunter’s face. “Are you hurt, Dean?” The angel asked, his loving blue eyes looking directly into Dean’s own.
“You see, I am the black sheep of the family.” James stammered. “Mainly due to the fact that I am Bisexual, eccentric by nature, and most of all, not really congenial in any proper way. And because I am socially awkward at the best of times, my pious, morally driven, hardworking middle class family views me as an embarrassment.”
Suddenly the linen bandages wound tightly around the soles of James’s feet burst into a tricolored flame. Composed of the colors blue, red and green, the violent flickering flame surged forth, spreading its reach outward towards the witches in effort to singe them. Yet just as the tricolored flame came within inches of the witches’ face, ready to sear them to ash, it’s rage was instantly snuffed out by an unseen force. Compelling the flame to return to nothing more to a mere collection of embers thenceforth, the three witches pulled their hands apart, then thrusted them down towards the ground.
Refusing to accept that Castiel was right, let alone believe that all their hard work was for naught, the two witches leered downward at where the angel was pointing and glowered.
“I think it says, ‘I sense… something nearby.’” Sam muttered. “As for the second part, it says, ‘James, I— Crossfire?’”
As Castiel and Dean continued to bicker, leaving Sam alone to sulk by himself quietly, the motorcyclist set down his phone on top of the impala and snickered. Pulling his helmet off next slowly with both arms, the man revealed his face to the three Winchesters and grinned. “Damn Sam,” the man laughed. “I don’t remember you driving around in this beauty while you were on campus—nor do I remember Dean being this paranoid by other males riding bikes. Has it truly been over a decade or so since we last saw each other face to face in physical person?”
At that moment, both brothers heard the supposed witch outside reach the front door. Attempting to reenter the house again thereafter, despite she soon found it to be futile, a loud racket began to surface; which in return alerted all others possibly still in the house that the brothers did not know of presently that something was amiss.
“Anyway,” John said, clearing his throat with emphasis. He made a vague circular gesture around the table. “We're supposed to say congratulations.”
“Because you're avoiding me, ignoring me,” Dean countered. He winced, biting his lip. “You're the most important person in my life, Cas. I've been going out of my mind. I don't know how to function when you're mad at me. Obviously I...have to apologize. Apparently
Raising his brows, Benny steps away from the wall and spreads his hands a bit. “I just don't want anyone falling off the bed.”
“It's been a while,” Sam commented, clearing his throat. “It's nice to see you, Adam. You're looking well.”
Castiel looked up from where he sat on the narrow dusty bunk. The thin excuse for a straw tick would be rather uncomfortable if Castiel had any inclination to sleep that night. “And what have you deduced from that?”
“Yup.” Rolling his eyes a bit, Dean said, “Mine was blue.” The image sprang forth vivid in his mind: the not quite smooth curve where someone had cut it out with scissors, the scrawl of Dean's name in Crayola marker. Like some sort of elementary school art project, basically. He worried the inside of his lip a bit. “I—speaking as someone who broke the pledge, I think maybe it would have been more helpful if instead of asking us to pledge to 'wait until marriage' they'd asked us to pledge to think things through before just jumping into bed with someone. Because...once it didn't work out with Lisa, I kind of figured...well, what's the point anymore? I already broke the stupid pledge. Virginity's gone.”
Dean rubbed a hand down his face. “These things with guys never work out. I told him about that, by the way, about Nick and Aaron. He thinks I'd be happier with a woman; he kept saying it.” Dean took a swallow of his beer. “He's probably right, even though I've never had a relationship with a woman last longer than about two weeks.” Snorting softly, Dean shook his head. “I was with Nick at least that long.” Dean's lips twisted in distaste at the realization, “Pretty sure Nick fucking Munroe was the longest relationship I've ever had.”
Sam winces, looking about again, considering. “I don't think we'd even fit that way. Maybe if we were all as small as Kevin, but even then.” He worries his lip, shaking his head.
“Never had whisky before, Kev?” Dean asks. He flexes his toes on the dusty bare wood floor, feet almost comfortable in a nice dry pair of socks. They've all lined their boots up next to the door with their damp socks hanging over the tops to air out.
Chuckling again in apparent disbelief, Castiel shook his head and leaned forward to set his not quite empty beer bottle on the coffee table with a hollow sort of thunk. “But why would you want to get married?”
He'd actually said all of that to Castiel, hadn't he? Gotten fucking stupid giddy drunk and started spouting off about marriage and kids. Groaning, Dean rolled over and shoved his face into the pillow. Castiel had shot him down multiple times and Dean had been too drunk and self-absorbed even to notice.
“Yes,” Sam said. “And do it while sober. Don't get hung up on pointless details like where you fall on the Kinsey scale.”
Clearing his throat, Castiel shifted a bit in his seat. “So that's why...I've been thinking about this more. I know we agreed from the start that we would never have to have sex. Like we read about on the internet, how some gay Christians do things.”
It took Dean a moment to process that Castiel was in the middle of trying to take the garbage out and Dean was in his way. “Oh, sorry,” Dean said, stepping to the side.
Castiel pressed his lips together, eyes somehow managing to look confusingly sad and hopeful at the same time. “You're thinking about kids?”
Castiel waved a hand. “I feel safe with you, Dean.” Offering Dean a bit of a crooked smile, he added, “You're not as intimidating as you think you are.”
Castiel opened his mouth, but after what was likely far too long a pause the best response he could formulate was, “He is a shapeshifter.” Swallowing, Castiel added, “On one occasion he took my own appearance in unnerving detail.”
Dean laughed. “Okay, fair point.” Scrubbing his fingers back through his hair, Dean went on, “Anyway, so far as marriage goes...when I was back in college I was taking...” He frowned, looking away. “Some class—could have been history, I guess. And the professor said that arranged marriages didn't—and I guess don't, since some people still do it that way in some places—have any lower of a success rate than those based 'on love'; apparently success in a marriage isn't all about feelings, or attraction, or any of that: it's about making a choice, a commitment, and then following through on that. I'm sure,” he added, rubbing at his stubble, “that feelings can help, sometimes, to some extent. But you know plenty of heterosexual couples aren't actually having sex, despite being married—and no one tries to tell them their marriages aren't valid because of that. It's no one's business, really.” He twisted his lips thoughtfully. “There's a lot more to marriage, to making a life with someone. Like kids, for example.”
Castiel missed Anna and Balthazar terribly. Objectively it was probably best they weren't here, but he just—wanted to see them both, to hug them and tell them he loved them. Perhaps he should have asked for ink and parchment and written them a letter rather than simply sitting up with Wesson all night. Wesson would no doubt have fetched the things, even scribed if Castiel's hand had trembled or eyes blurred too much to write. But maybe Castiel just didn't want this to feel real.
“Well, Benny and I are huge,” Sam points out. “And apparently when you're trying to fit everyone safely in this one cabin for the night...”
That mutual coming out debacle had been a real mess and they'd both said stupid shit they'd had to take back, but Castiel had stayed that night anyway. It turned out Dean didn't need to offer sex to get Castiel to hold him, and thankfully Castiel loved Dean enough to forgive him for joining the long list of men who'd learned he was gay and immediately tried to get into his pants. It had been months and it still blew Dean's mind: despite everything, Castiel loved Dean so much that he was willing to try to make things work.
Dean nodded a bit as he pulled his claw back and a sort of ripple ran through his body with a gentle sigh as he shifted fully into his demon form, leather wings snapping a little as Dean's mouth closed over the beading drop of blood on Castiel's finger.
Dean tried to call out to his brother, but he could not speak—for he was in a similar predicament. For the more he struggled in attempt to free himself so that he could help his dear brother, the more unpleasant and daunting his own bindings became. In the end, Dean was forced to cease even the mere mental stimuli of resisting, because the reprisal for doing so brought him back into submission so severely, that Dean himself almost lost consciousness each time he tried to fight it.
Dean snarled and forced himself up. However, when he did, Kora used her magic to suppress him back onto the ground. “Where do you think you’re going, Hunter?” Kora snapped.       “You stay put there like a good boy, or we’ll put you back into shackles!”
Confused, both Winchesters narrowed their eyes on the blue-eyed angel as a sense of newfound dread began to stir deep within their hearts; for something just didn’t sit right. What did the witch do to Castiel that could free him from his unexplained rigor mortis—one so strong, that it hindered him from speaking, moving and using his heavenly powers to defend himself? A hex? A charm? Or was this all just another trick? Was the person before them even Castiel at all? Maybe it was a doppelgänger—a shapeshifter indebted to the witch that had taken the form of Castiel in effort to trick the Winchesters into a false sense of security. Regardless of what it was, neither Sam nor Dean could escape the sense of growing dread.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Ridley…” Fiona cooed calmly, attempting not to smile nor sound peeved as she spoke. “I assume now is a good time for you to catch me up on what is going on?”
Dean let out a low scoff, slightly bemused by the statement. “Didn’t know your friend was related to ‘Bigfoot,’ Sammy…” Dean muttered. “Anyway, they are going back towards the personal gym area I saw you eyeing earlier. Let’s follow them, and see if we can find any more clues.”
From out of Dean’s pocket shot forth the Impala’s car keys. Floating aimlessly in front of the eldest Winchester before choosing to soar directly through the air and onto on Fiona’s finger, the Impala’s car keys clanked minorly, taunting Dean to instantly stand up in shock the moment he heard the metallic sound resonate.
Though Sam had been beaten and exposed alongside his brother at the same time, currently it seemed that he had not been spotted yet by the witch who had summoned the gravitational force to expel them from their hiding place. Scrambling forward to grab his gun feverishly before that factor changed, Sam rearmed himself and retreated backward towards the master bedroom.
But that’s all Sam could say before he felt the massive gravitational force start to press downward on his neck.
“Now please do as you are told Hun, or I can’t guarantee your safety.” Fiona continued. “To be honest, I have no idea how you are still able to function in this barrier so well. You should be dead!”
“For Hell’s sake—it’s an expression Cas…” Dean huffed, expelling a loud puff of air as he glared forward in frustration. “I meant, tell me what you need to tell me. I can take whatever it is.”
Both heard Dean exhale loudly with a disgruntled huff. Following that Dean was utterly silent, his eyes locked on whatever he saw in the distant and constantly passing landscape.
“So he is a dumb rookie.” Dean said, his comment coming off much more smug than he meant it to originally be. “And you feel that you need to protect him before he tries to and goes on a hunt by himself to correct the situation.”
“Is this 741 Dragoon Drive?” Sam muttered. “Reason I ask is because all the numbers on the houses are not highly visible, and the past dozen don’t seem to have any markings whatsoever.”
“Nevertheless, I know you brutes tend to hunt in pairs…” The female voice laughed. “And your ally’s outcry earlier only confirmed it.”
The witch speaking was about the same height as Dean, perhaps slightly taller, and she was about thirty-five in age at least. Her skin was slightly darker than the other witches before her and around her neck was a tribal, fanged necklace of a shaman. She also bore bracers that also seemed shamanistic in nature, for they had beads and black feathers woven deep into its leather-hide fabric; but the witch’s overall garb was modern and well kept at best. But her voice was blunt and commanding—for it was naturally loud and daunting. As for her composure, the witch presented herself ever orderly, despite the temper and rage she felt time to time depending on the stress thrust upon her during unfavorable situations. Nevertheless to the Winchesters, though witch came off as beautiful as she was fierce—much like a tigress. One, if crossed incorrectly, could fell them in a blink of an eye; just like Rowena.
Looking in unison, the Winchesters and Fiona herself glanced over towards the main hallway that led to the stairway. Shortly after that, the four saw Abigail approach from around the corner and enter the room.
From the eldest Obi sister’s palm shot forth a bolt of violet-blue lightning. Striking James with the strength of a mild form of an electric shock, which caused him to jolt almost instantly upon contact, James was forcefully awoken from his unconscious slumber. Convulsing onto the ground thereafter as he slowly came to, James twisted his head to his side and looked up to see what was possibly going on. And to his surprise, despite he was still in a daze and fatigued, James soon realized that he was in deep trouble.
“‘Lone Wolf?’” Dean grunted, leering over from the front seat of the impala to glare at Castiel who currently sat in shotgun. “That’s what you choose to call him? And since when can you foresee another’s future by just looking into their eyes?”
“You are indeed enduring.” Castiel continued. “And in time, despite your doubts, you shall find solace, Lone Wolf. I am sure of it. But for now, what you need most is rest.” Stretching out his main hand to gesture to both Sam and Dean, Castiel smiled. “Allow us to gather the necessities needed to support both you as well as ourselves for the length of our stay. Until then, please try and get some sleep—for you are weary. We shall be back soon within the next hour or so.”
The gravitational force increased its pressure around Sam’s neck, preventing him from speaking again out of turn.
A small moment of silence was exchanged, but Kora then lowered her head, as if ashamed. “Yes, Fiona,” Kora replied. “I’m sorry.”
Sam felt his heart stop momentarily, only then to be immediately jumpstart again by an overwhelming sense of impending dread.
“Poor choice of words, Hun…” Kora replied. “But, as you wish.” The witch simply waved her hand, and her spell came undone. “Who am I to deny you…”
The young witch slowly opened her hands to reveal the glass vial within. When she did, all present saw that the glass vial—which at first was clear and void of scratches, cracks or abnormalities—had undergone a metamorphosis. It had been reforged by Abigail’s arcane witchcraft into a vessel more befitting of an Angel’s grace. One etched and engraved with glowing runic symbols that constantly shined enticingly with a humble and warm violet hue.
“I must agree with Dean, for once on the subject Sam.” Castiel added. “This cul-de-sac is quite crowded and the owners’ cars are scattered all over the street. It is astonishing that none of them hit one another while they back out.”
Ignoring the two hunters and their devoted angel companion, the three witches continued; undeterred by the boy’s chatter.
“Indeed,” Castiel said sweetly. “Also, Miss Fiona, the three of us were invited here by young James as his guest for this upcoming week.”
“Alright, Sam.” Dean muttered, locking the Impala the very second Sam shut the car’s side door. “We’ll go in together, but keep a short distance between us at all times. You head to the upper level and I’ll stay on the lower. If you see any movement or sense trouble, fire once and I’ll charge in to aid you.”
For a brief period following James’s comment, the only thing that was exchanged was utter silence. No one present dared to comment nor make light of the supposed situation. Not even Dean, though he was still angered from the loss of his prized possessions, dared to jeer James anymore than he already had. He too was silent; lost in contemplation of how to proceed. Nevertheless, despite the long awkward silence, James chose to break it willingly himself; determined to explain what needed to be said.
Dean’s face instantly flushed red, then he turned it away to leer in the opposite direction of where his brother was looking. “I knew that Sam.” Dean grunted. “Just testing yah!”
,’ was it?” Fiona glowered, her eyes narrowed and staring directly into Sam’s own. “You and I have barely even begun to properly introduce ourselves fully to one another.” The eldest Obi sister continued. “And we must not have that… But before we finish with all the needed, ‘formalities,’ allow me to ‘reacquaint’ James to the situation.”
“So you are telling me this wannabe biker dude is your old roommate from college?” Dean grunted, before sticking his head forward to glare at Sam from the front seat. “Cause I damn don’t remember him at all.”
Kora just rolled her eyes in response. “Then what are you referring to?” The witch asked. “The hex we just placed on him?”
James just sighed. “I didn’t steal them, if that is what you are assuming.” James replied. Gesturing to Sam silently with his head next, James narrowed his eyes. “They were donated to me, along with most of my other wardrobe by Sam.”
Following the moment he heard the man’s voice, Sam lifted his head from where it lied and turned it towards the speaker. Smiling weakly as he glanced at the man, Sam exited the impala and wrapped his arms around his friend. Hugging him tightly thereafter as he leaned his own head into the groove of the man’s shoulder, Sam remained silent, his body shuddering in spite of himself.
Sam’s phone buzzed again, but this time it was more persistent. Sounding twice this time  back to back, Sam’s phone called out annoyingly.
” Fiona said, swearing under her breath. “Blue-eyes is right…” The eldest witch hissed. “The curse still remains. All we did was dampen it.”
“Oh, dang,” The man stuttered, slightly disarmed by Sam’s abrupt action. “You grew too in both height and mass.” The man narrowed his eyes next in disappointment, even though Sam failed to see it happen. “Or I just stayed the same body mass index overall for the past countless years… How embarrassing…”
Sam just rolled his eyes at the empty threat. “Sure Dean,” Sam grinned. “While you’re at it, why don’t you own up to your sins once in a while and just admit you were fooling around when you are caught!”
“We’ve only been here for an hour or so and I already hate this place.” Dean grunted, as he pulled the impala into the garage slowly. “The streets are too narrow, confusing, and make no sense.”
“What do we have here,” Sam heard the female voice say. “So it must have been you who was the one who locked my sister out of the house! Clever—for an impudent fool…”
Dean pulled the white curtain ever so slightly with his gun, then leaned in forward to glare out the window. When he did, he instantly spotted a person on their phone, standing alone on the front porch-driveway next to James’s motorcycle. The person in question was female and their skin was dark-copper in tint. Height wise, Dean assumed that the female was almost as tall as Sam and was of moderate build at least. Other than that, the main characteristics that stood out to Dean was the female’s hair style and the shamanistic objects she used to decorate it with it.
Clearing his throat to signal the two to be quiet, Sam rolled down the impala’s shotgun’s side window and smiled. “Uh, hey there Sir,” Sam forced himself to say as polite as he could while he himself also leaned forward towards the open window. “Forgive me please if I took your spot in the driveway—but I think we’re a bit lost.”
The first to heed the witches’ offer was Castiel. Rising from his knees slowly, for he was still weak, the blue-eyed angel shambled over to James’s bedside and kneeled himself back down. Glancing at James’s feet next, Castiel began his own process of examining James’s body for abnormalities. Upon doing so, despite his lack of grace, Castiel grew bemused.
Before Sam could even continue, he saw Fiona’s eyes open as wide as they could, then quickly narrow to hide her astonishment. This sudden change in the eldest Obi sister’s composure unnerved him, causing him to backpedal momentarily. Nonetheless, Fiona snatched the phone from Sam’s outstretched hand and swiftly began to scan the texts as fast as she could.
Sam’s phone buzzed loudly, which in return caused Sam to instantly answer it. Pulling it out swiftly, for he knew already who the text was from, Sam read the message.
Then, after what seemed like would be the start of an eternity of torment, something intervened. A single voice, despite all odds or reason, that was able to quell the chaos and return order to the dire situation.
“We hit a spell barrier!” Dean grunted. “And that means it was a hidden one we couldn’t see before.”
“According to our allies at the supermarket and throughout the town, these Hunters were seen using James’s own funds to buy supplies for themselves! They even talked about hunting our own and using James’s house as a base!”
“Well the only thing I can think of that is powerful enough to screw with Cas—besides your’s truly—is other angels, demons—such as Crowley… And, maybe witches too?” Dean snickered. “But—”
“Good,” Dean replied. “Because I don’t have the mental fortitude to explain it to you, nor do I want to do either.” Dean slapped Castiel on his back and grinned. “Let’s go!”
“Restituere carne et anima, Et oblinito maledictioni cor tuum, et speculum. ut benedicat e novo. restituere vigorem.” The three witches said. “Novam vitam restituere. Ut benedicat tibi Deus May, James - lupus certatior mi fide!”
“Whatever,” Dean grumbled. “I’m just glad we got to go to the market and pick up everything including beer!”
Dean struck the steering-wheel of the impala with his main hand, causing the stationary car to suddenly jerk in place momentarily for a second or two. “What?” Dean asked, his voice hoarse with anger. “He a vegan? Only eats meat on Wednesdays? Can’t do it unless the lights are on? Or something far worse than I can’t imagine because in the end it is so kinky, that I myself in the future might find out that I enjoy doing it too once I try it alone somewhere while I’m drunk?”
?” Abigail scoffed, leering at her sister with a bemused look upon her face. “I enhanced the glass vial to ward off the negative effects of the magical barrier with the most powerful warding hexes I could weave.” Abigail then released the glass vial and allowed it to fall back against Castiel’s chest. After that, the witch turned around to face Fiona directly and glowered. “As a result, his grace should be preserved and further strengthened the longer it dwells within the arcane vessel—renewed by the very energies that once sought to dampen and-or distort it.”
“I can’t believe it,” the witch with the leather-hide spaulders resting on top of her shoulders said. “How could you allow these grunts to get past you!” The witch then pointed to her companion with her index finger and snarled. “
Suddenly a sweltering heat shot up from the base of Sam’s spine, then surge rapidly throughout every bone of his body, inspiring an unbearable pain to surface within seconds. Following that said pain, his mind was overtaken by a chilling fog—one that numbed every neuron from firing and shattered every single thought like a rock striking a thin sheet of glass. Finally, when Sam couldn’t speak, see or hear—for his senses were rendered mute, Sam felt his very soul begin to be stabbed—perforated by what seemed to feel like thousands upon thousands of jagged rods—over and over again; repeatedly.
Sam’s vision began to wane, while the area around him grew darker with each agonizing second. His chest grew heavy and his mind’s ability to process what was being said to him slowed rapidly until it reached a sudden halt. Then, once Sam was unable to maintain his own will and keep fighting against the overwhelming odds, Sam fell unconscious. Hist last thoughts fixated on the importance of his brother’s safety, and of James’s own.
“Cause those were great songs!” Dean said, blushing slightly, but otherwise trying to remain stoic. “And you have a good taste in music—unlike Sam here!”
Confused, but also wounded by Dean’s statement, Castiel shuddered in place. “Wait, I never…” Castiel muttered, attempting to apologize for something he may have said. “I…”
Fiona rolled up her sleeves and began to approach James slowly. Following their sister’s lead, both Kora and Abigail did the same. Clasping their hands next in prayer, or at least what seemed like a praying motion, the three witches shut their eyes and started to chant.
Again Castiel said nothing; nevertheless his eyes did repeat the same flashing pattern as they did once before. The only difference this time was the fact that Dean himself could see beads of sweat begin to form on his best friend’s brow.
Wesson's brown hair fell across his forehead as he ducked his head, shaking it. “Even if you are wilfully and knowingly protecting a partially-corrupted Creature, I don't believe that's worthy of death.” Grimacing, he shrugged. “Far from it. I begged for time to investigate more thoroughly, but...Judge Naomi is unyielding.”
Feelings certainly were complicated. Dean himself was about ready to crawl out of his skin with how badly he missed Castiel. “I just want him to
“Well.” Dean cleared his throat. “For the record, it feels pretty good. In the moment, anyway. Not that I'm—that I'm trying to sway you in that direction or anything.”
Dean nodded, chewing on his lower lip a bit. “I've always wanted kids.” He nodded again. “And I think maybe...I'm at the point where I could see myself actually doing that.” He chuckled softly, ducking his head. “Sam's moved out and even Adam's only home a few weekend's a year now. The house is starting to feel unnaturally quiet, empty.” He scrunched up his nose and took a swallow of his beer. “And anyway, I guess I'd like to have some kids before I'm too old to keep up with them.”
Dean blinked the worst of the groggy just-waking-up feeling away before he suddenly remembered and his eyes flew open in a panic. Shit.
“Cas,” Dean tried, wetting his lips and worrying the lower one a bit, “you're not a 'last resort'. You're my first choice. Uh, pretty much the only choice I'd consider.” He grinned a little, gesturing in the general direction of his house. “If Kate Winslet, Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, and Doctor Sexy himself were all to come to my front door tomorrow and each declare their undying love and beg for my hand in marriage, I'd still rather have you.”
Dean stood outside Castiel's door, psyching himself up. Castiel's car was in the driveway so it was pretty likely he was home. And it wasn't creepily early or uncomfortably late. Dean was freshly showered and maybe he'd put on his
“You are so beautiful,” Dean said without quite meaning to. His cheeks heated and he smiled self-consciously.
Sam raised his brows. “Well, uh...feel free to pick whatever label you prefer, but you did by your own admission want to marry a man.”
“So, uh,” Sam said, turning to smile at Dean in the setting sun, “not that I'm complaining, 'cause I'm not—it's nice to hang out just you and me like this. We don't hang out enough anymore.”
Castiel shook his head. Rubbing at his arm through the sleeve of his shirt, he said, “No. Well, not really, anyway. I mean, maybe at first I thought about it some. Like, is this even still possible, being gay and all? Is it still...'allowed' to wait until marriage? And I kind of...” He scrunched up his nose. “I kind of wanted someone to prove that it was, to show me he loved me enough to wait. But at the same time...the importance of writing my name on a yellow heart and sticking it to a red construction paper cross masking-taped to the wall...well, it faded over time. I didn't really feel like God, assuming he still wanted me after all, would really hold me to that.”
“And the 'punishment' is mostly just the consequences God was trying to help us avoid,” Dean replied with a bit of a grin. After a pause he added, “You remember that dumb abstinence pledge they had us do that one time?”
Castiel reached out hesitantly and took Dean's hand in his own. Dean's heart hammered painfully in his chest and he might have forgotten to breathe. Castiel laced their fingers together and raised his gaze to meet Dean's. “Like this?”
to Dean, sliding one hand around to press against Dean's chest and pull him closer against Castiel's body.
“Because then,” Dean reasoned, pressing even closer and tipping his face up so he could look at Castiel, “the two of us could get married.”
“You still had your heart,” Castiel suggested. “The rest of your life. Speaking as the person you're planning on marrying...those are...pretty important. To me.”
It was funny in a way, but the house, the yard...it had never looked so odd when Dean was growing up there. It had just seemed normal, and even when Kate complained it had seemed like probably she was overreacting. But this just...wasn't normal. The people who'd called Sam and Dean 'hillbillies', 'rednecks', or worse when they were in high school might have had a point. When your clothes were hand-me-downs and you lived in a dump, well.
of losing Castiel again. And what the hell were you even supposed to do when your childhood BFF came back after disappearing without warning for actual years of no contact and said he'd left because he was gay, in love with you, and convinced you were so straight and religious you'd hate him for it?
“So you're really—?” Dean drew a breath, closing his eyes as rebel tears streamed down his face. His voice broke as he tried, “You're okay with this?” He gestured in front of himself. “With—me and...Cas?”
“Hell,” John muttered, stepping forward and pulling Dean into a hug. Dean stayed motionless for perhaps a beat too long before finally returning the hug, breaths shaky in his chest. “I'll always love you, son,” John said, holding Dean tight. “That's not something I can just turn off. And if you and Cas love each other—that's a
Castiel turned the teacup in his hands. “There certainly are a few things...texts and talismans and the like that I'd prefer not to lose, if possible. But the most important things...I never wrote down.” Taking Dean's hand, he turned a soft smile on him. “My true life's work? That's Dean.”
“Let's get a fire started,” Benny suggests. “See if we can get dried off and maybe have some supper.”
“Such confidence you have in my skills,” Crowley commented from the doorway before walking over to set a tray down on the bedside table with a metallic clink. “Though, if anyone has need of any Blessed Water, I'm sure
“Not at all,” Castiel replied. “Once Dean was enough recovered, I'd always planned to rejoin Anna and Balthazar, at least for some missions.”
Dean shrugged, flexing his hands against the smooth familiar curve of the Impala's steering wheel. “I mean, 'the worst' is
Edlund's clear voice was reading out Castiel's conviction, but he couldn't make himself follow the words. He'd heard it before, anyway. He knew why he was here: he'd shown more compassion than he ought to and by doing so he'd put many people in some vague danger. He couldn't quite feel like that was wrong. Maybe sometimes a person's conscience demanded they save the one and let the hundreds sort themselves out. And if a law defined 'malevolence' on appearance and the ability to tolerate a certain type of magic water, then the law was wrong.
“So,” Castiel said after a beat, “we wait until everyone's had time to eat a decent amount but before they get a chance to leave the table. And then we tell them.”
Dean managed to avoid visibly wincing. The thing was, he didn't feel very confident around Cas. Not when it came to this, anyway. Wrinkling his nose at Sam, Dean said, “I'm sure you know all about how to get the guys, Sammy.”
“You realize,” Castiel said, one corner of his lips curling upwards, “that having children would be considerably easier with a female partner.”
After a pause, Wesson said, “Given enough time, Dean's injuries should heal to the point where it would be safe for him to come to you.” Castiel nodded. In truth that time had likely already come. Maybe it was a testament to Dean's wisdom that he had stayed away thus far. “Would he...? Do you think, were I to administer it,” Wesson asked carefully, “he could pass a Water Test?”
“Cas?” Dean let go of Castiel's wrist to put his hand against Castiel's cheek and guide his face back to looking at him. “Just so we're clear: I am interested. Exactly that way.” Maybe it wasn't the best line he'd ever used, but maybe it still got his point across. Leaning in, he brought his lips to meet Castiel's, gentle and tender, like something from one of Sam's chick-flicks, exactly the way a 'just proposed and got accepted' kiss should go.
“Outhouse out back,” Benny says as he comes in followed by drenched and morose versions of Castiel and Kevin. “Though I'm not sure I'd trust it.”
Dean dropped his gaze. “Just...” His fingertips ghosted over Castiel's wrist and along his fingers. He swallowed. “It's been...a while.”
Dean shrugged one shoulder. “I don't really mind.” He flexed his wings and candlelight glimmered off their iridescent surface. “I like being pretty.”
Taking one hand off the wheel, Dean caught Castiel's hand where it lay on his knee and squeezed it in response. “I'm glad we did too.”
“I suppose—” Dean cleared his throat. “I suppose there's always an expectation there, just because that's what people expect. Even if they've already been having sex, I guess.” He shrugged.
“Well, I...” Frowning, Wesson shifted some sheets of parchment in front of him and shook his hair off his forehead. “I feel like there must be something important that we're missing.” When Edlund raised a brow, he said, “For one thing, in your first listed possibility, the Water Test—I maintain that with valid Blessed Water a properly-administered test should be impossible to fool.”
“You didn't really look fine,” Castiel countered as he pulled away and started unbuttoning his shirt.
“Many times, as is advisable for us all in ritual cleansing.” Castiel had been administering it quite regularly, though of course never directly; Castiel drank it and then had Dean drink his blood. Administering the Water directly, at least early on, might have killed Dean. At this point it would probably have been safe to try having Dean touch it, but Castiel hadn't been in a rush.
“Well, I don't know.” Sam shrugged. “They are probably his most striking feature, but just pick whatever you personally like. His hair. I dunno. His abs.”
Dean pulled back, blinking and shaking his head in an attempt to get his face to feel normal again. “Okay.” After a moment of feeling like the world was still spinning off kilter, he asked, “So you'll...come to the wedding and everything?”
Wesson cleared his throat. “In most recorded cases, a Creature approaches a human to offer a bond. Obviously not all are willing to wait for such an event, and a human seeking out a bond is common enough. But there is some...compelling evidence that forcibly bonding a Creature corrupts the bond...and with it the Creature.” Castiel looked up, eyes wide and chest constricting at the thought that Castiel himself may have added even a hint of additional injury to what Dean had already suffered. Holding up a hand, Wesson added, “Now, I'm not saying that's what you did. What you're describing isn't what I'd categorize as 'forcing'. But there is something of a continuum between a Creature in their fully sound mind entering into an unrushed and freely-chosen bond and...a Creature injured and near death for whom the bond may be his only chance of survival.”
“Why wouldn't you expect him to say yes?” Sam clarified. Dean stared at Sam until Sam added, “You do know he's gay, right?”
“Thanks,” Dean says, accepting the flask from Benny and taking a swig before handing it to Castiel. Benny—as a surprise to probably no one—is skilled at using wood stoves, so they've got a cheery warm light to huddle around as they eat. They've got their damp shirts and soggy hats hanging wherever they could find a spot. The chair Dean's in has his shirt hooked on one side of the back and Castiel's on the other. Good thing everyone had a dry shirt in their saddlebags, since even with the fire going the cabin isn't exactly warm. The door doesn't fit right—not anymore, anyway. Settling's a bitch. And the ill-fitting door might not be the only source of drafts, but it's the biggest.
Pursing her lips, Edlund folded her hands on the bar. “If Healer Castiel's magic was tainted, would that be enough to invalidate the power of water he himself blessed?”
Benny laughs. “That's fair.” He takes a swig and makes a face at the flask. “It's not the best whisky.”
Dean shrugged, worrying his lip a little and looking back at Castiel. “I'm sure it happens.” Castiel shrugged noncommittally but he kept looking at Dean like he was
With a frustrated breath and a disgusted roll of his eyes, Dean pushed himself up and walked—a little unsteadily, admittedly—to the window. He put both hands on the sill and looked out over his darkened back yard. “You think I've never thought about any of this while sober, Cas? Just because I don't say something out loud doesn't mean I wasn't thinking about it. And anyway,” he blurted, “if you need more gay cred to believe me, I dated a couple of guys in college.”
Castiel's grin turned rueful, and he looked away a bit, ducking his head. “Dean, I—I've been in love with you for...a very long time. I just...never thought I'd have a chance. I assumed you weren't...interested. Not that way.”
Castiel puts his hand over Dean's as though to keep it there and makes a quiet little contented sound, and Dean is so damn glad he's got his back blocking everyone's view of this. The blankets don't feel nearly opaque enough, even in the dark.
Castiel tilted his head to the side again. “I always assumed you just wanted to be him, be like him.”
Dean sighed, looking away towards the tree-lined hills in the distance. “A week ago...yeah, it's been a week now. We were hanging out, drinking.”
Dean shivered at that and flashed Castiel a crooked grin, flicking his eyebrows suggestively. “Maybe that's the idea.”
Dean cleared his throat and focused his attention on the road. “That wouldn't be very polite to our guest.”
Castiel hummed thoughtfully. He started to pull his hand away, and Dean made an embarrassingly plaintive noise in protest. Castiel chuckled, patting Dean's cheek. “I suppose you really do like my hands.”
“No, I agree,” Castiel said, nodding. “It is none of their business and the only way we're going to normalize queer relationships is if we treat them the same as any other relationship.”
