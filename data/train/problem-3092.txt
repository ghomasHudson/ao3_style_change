“What the hell happened?” Sam asks bringing his hands down heavily on the table, making some of the water spill out.
Outside of the house, he walks to the middle of the backyard, dropping his clothes on the ground. He walks over to the side of the house grabbing the old gas can Sam had sitting, next to the lawnmower. Castiel walks over to his clothes, and pours the whole can over them. He tosses the can aside, and lights the lighter. Barely touching the clothes with the flame, it catches and ignites the pile. Castiel watches the flames slowly licking their way through the fabric.
“Let. Him. Go.” The simple three words are laced with so much alpha dominance that Dean feels Benny’s fingers begin to shake before he lets him go.
“Crowley!” Sam grunts frantically looking around the empty room as Dean bangs on the door separating them. “Damnit, I wont be able to hold him too much longer.”
They just stand there, staring at each other. Dean knows, even after all this time, male omegas are so rare you hardly ever hear about them let alone see one. Sam figures the percentages are what he estimated the first time. Any alpha that Dean has come across seems to think that fucking him means they’ll win some sort of ego filled prize. Over the past two years Dean’s played this game more times than he can count. Most alphas seem to think because he’s omega that he’ll be easy pray and just submit to whatever they want from him. Each one has quickly learned the hard way that even though that might be his subgender making him a lot of things, weak isn’t one of them.
Slowly, as if in a trance, Castiel slid into his seat across from Dean, still staring at his arm like it might light back up again.
After a few weeks since Dean was discharged from the hospital, the news begins reporting something else other than the number of infected and dead people. All the reports start coming in from where the virus hit first. The reporters are saying people are just going off, completely enraged, unable to control themselves. They show a video of some average looking guy punching out a window of a store, completely unphased by his strength, actions or pain. Throughout the week the media stops broadcasting infected and death numbers. Instead, they talk about how rape is on the rise throughout the country, and climbing at an alarming rate.
He stares at the empty place where Cain was standing just seconds before, blinking slowly. He briefly glances around the area, lowering his blade after sensing no one near. The conversation with Cain replays in his mind, as he tightens his grip on the smooth handle of his blade. Castiel feels a tingle from his grace that helps make up his blade pulsing underneath his hand, trying to soothe his pain away.
“We just set up our testing tent two days ago, and we’re already running out of protective gear for everyone.”
Someone yells from loud enough for Dean to hear their muffled voice, but the thick metal door distorts their words. There’s clanging of metal being hit and more yelling. Dean tries to focus out the sounds coming from behind the door. It wont be too long before he’s behind it, locked in his own cell.
They laugh again, their high pitched voice grating on Dean’s ears. “Poor little human upset we got his little faerie-wearie all tied up?”
Dean’s pretty sure that when someone dies they hope to stroll through those big pearly gates into Heaven. Hell, some of them probably even expect it. But not him though. No, he knows enough of the pain and misery he’s caused on this plane of existence and knows full well what’s waiting for him on the other side.
“Fuck!” He jumps, lowering his hands that were about to hit him. “Cas, damnit, you scared the shit outta me.” He glances back at the house. “Everything okay?”
With a choked off noise his orgasm hits out of nowhere. Dean’s shaky legs wobble before giving out and he slumps to the ground, hand still around his softening dick.
“It’s fine,” Dean says fighting back the urge to reach out and entwine their fingers together. “Nothing would’ve been worked out anyway if you got my messages. You still would’ve thought that I…”
“And it was just a really shit night, alright? Damnit, we’ve been through this!” He snaps glaring back at his brother pinching the bridge of his nose.
Phasing back was excruciating and took two times going to his cell and coming out to become human again.
The excruciating pain flares inside him as Castiel gasps, trying to hold himself back from arching his back. He digs his nails into the wooden chair, barely realizing the poorly made arms have splintered and broken off into his hands. Castiel hears a deep jumble of voices somewhere above him, and then the most agonizing pain he’s ever felt in all his millennia flares up in every atom of his make up. Unable to hold back the scream any longer, he opens his mouth and lets it out, hoping in vain that might relieve some of the pain.
Eyes, what? His eyes aren’t golden they’re green. And he wasn’t going to meet him at the door he was looking for something. He was –
“Hear me out,” Sam says turning back to Dean. “What if this is just how normal people act, and we’re actually just too jaded to realize it?”
Dean doesn’t think he looks any different. Same face with the same stubble dusting his cheeks. Same green eyes staring back at him. He holds out his hands and flips them over examining them for even the slightest of change. Everything still looks every bit the same as it always has. Finally, Dean lifts up his shirt halfway up. He stares at his chest, his belly not entirely flat (which he completely blames on the amount of crap food he eats at the diner all the time). It all looks exactly the same.
Castiel is well aware that Sam is still talking, but the painful feeling of the Mark digging at his grace drowns out his words. Hissing, Castiel stumbles towards table, hands gripping the edges tightly. It feels as if claws have torn their way through his chest and are tearing away at his insides, digging deeper, deeper, searching for something.
“Those are the main three. We haven’t been able to do much in the way of testing with it yet, but we do realize that when an omega sweats their scent seems to spike. With any alpha or omega, you’re almost able to tell emotions through the scent. Certain smells can get sharper or sometimes smell gets sweeter. It all depends. I mean, I was able to smell an omega pretty well when they were brought in after an attack, so that tells you something.”
Castiel’s left hand slides to the back of Dean’s neck, sliding up into his short hairs. Tilting his head to the side Cas gently coaxes Dean into the dip of his neck where his scent is the strongest. Dean’s whole body locks up, freezing, holding his breath afraid to breathe.
“You’re so beautiful,” he says stepping out of his pants. “Just look at you, chest flushed, eyes golden for your alpha. You were already so hard when I walked in. Couldn’t wait for me to get to the bed and had to meet me by the door, right? ”
“You can’t possibly mean that,” he says stepping forward. “After everything we’ve been through – after everything Sam’s done for you – you’re just going to give up? Just like that?”
Castiel’s whole body burns with want and need so strong he pulls back just enough from their kiss to gasp with it. Dean doesn’t waste the interrupted second, but instead uses it to start trailing wet, open mouthed kisses down Cas’ neck. Oblivious to the fire Castiel swears is burning underneath his skin, Dean’s mouth only seems to fuel the flames further. He moans again, hips bucking forward, seeking any type of friction. It surprises Cas when his achingly confined cock brushes against Dean’s. Cracking his eyes open, Castiel realizes at some point Dean has laid him back and is pressing himself on top of him. His gorgeous bow legs are spread wide, straddling him as best they can on the couch.
After awhile, he could never tell the difference between pleasure and pain. Alastair made sure to train his body into thinking both were the same. One isn’t allowed without the other.
Confused, Dean walks over to the mirror in the hallway right by the front door. He stops in front of it, turning his head to the side. His eyes grow wide as he sees a hickey on the side of his neck. Not just any type of hickey, but a deep red and purple one. One that means the person was sucking on it hard and for awhile.
. Dean swears he can smell the sour scent of Alastair in his nose and hear those angry alpha words echoing in his head like it was just done hours before. His breath hitches as he remembers just how it felt when that one leather whip snapped across his back, drawing with it the scent of blood into the air.
When they did actually stop and Castiel was actually able to lay down on a bed, it didn’t help things that he was usually woken up by Dean loudly stumbling into their room from wherever he had been, so drunk he barely knew his own name. Some nights (most nights) he was jolted from his sleep by Dean’s blood curdling screams.
By the end of the day Benny hasn’t come back. Dean is closing up when he smells something that makes him turn his head sniffing the air. It smells like he’s in a forest. Some type of wood he can’t put his finger on…Cedar? Pine? With a hint of honey. Dean knows it’s instantly an alpha but instead of feeling fear his body is seems to almost be pulling him towards the scent. His mouth starts watering and without thinking about it, his feet are taking him towards the open garage door. He manages to stop himself just outside the door staring at a man with dark hair that looks his hands have been running through it too much stands beside an old gold Lincoln Continental. Bright blue eyes stare back at him, crinkling slightly as he offers a small smile.
For the first two days he couldn’t bring himself to crawl out of bed unless it was for alcohol or using the bathroom. Work didn’t think anything of it when he called in saying he was under the weather.
Dean makes sure that Castiel has made it to the edge of the bed before he goes back over and shuts the door. Just like every time after being that close to Cas, Dean feels a cold emptiness inside him that he doesn’t understand at the absence of the touch. He shifts on his feet, trying to mask the squirming his body does.
Crowley rolls his eyes dramatically. “You were human. Of course you wouldn’t be stronger, you moron.”
Squeezing his eyes shut tightly for a moment, Castiel sighs, trying to get his emotions in check before slowly opening them again.  “I am not asking your permission.”
“I think you know as well I do that if I truly don’t want to do something, I wont. Not because I’m not attracted to you because…” He glances down to his half hard cock still pressing against his jeans. “That’s never been the issue. All the times you’ve pulled your name from my lips with your lips wrapped around my cock kind of proves that.” Castiel presses a quick kiss to the edge of Dean’s partially opened mouth, loving Dean’s reaction to his words. “I’ve always just, well, not been ready. I’ve tried to explain it to you a hundred times before, but maybe, deep down, I thought what we had was enough, maybe? I think the bottom line was that I just wasn’t there, yet, with us.”
“Why are you so infuriating? People say I don’t get subtle hints, and I never really understood that until now. It is quite possibly one of the most frustrating things not being able to scent you right now.”
Dean freezes, eyes shooting open. The water suddenly feels like rocks pelting his skin. If it wasn’t for the fact that one of Castiel’s hands is on his dick, and the other is squeezing his asscheek, Dean would be concerned that he’s trying to kill him. Still, the way Cas worded what he said is something that only addicts say.
“Nope! Sorry buddy, I’m not letting you fucking touch me again. You forget you fucking bit me?” Dean tilts his neck to the side, ignoring the twinge of pain and points at the mark. “Getting me a glass of water ain’t gunna change my mind about you being in my damn house. I want you out!”
Sam hands him the bottle and gives him a sad smile. “Yeah, I guess I am. I want to blame it on being stuck at the hospital during all this, but a handful of the doctors and nurses on staff got affected. Two of them didn’t make it.” He nods to the bottle. “Anyway, this is what we are calling blockers. Kind of what you got sprayed with on your way in, except this you just rub on the spots of your body that secrete the most of your scent.” Sam points to the spot where his neck meets his shoulder, behind his ears and under his arms.
Even after Sam went off to college a few states away, Bobby passed away and he seemed to constantly be repairing something in the place he inherited, Dean still hung onto the house. People in town talked, whispering and calling him all sorts of things. Some were brave enough to question him to his face, asking him why a good looking guy like him wouldn’t start looking for a nice lady to spend the rest of his life with. He gave them all the same excuse, some bullshit line about waiting for the right girl, or until it felt right. It’s not like he could explain that more often than not he spent his evenings with a faerie that never seemed to age.
A shrill sound of metal against something solid pierces his left ear, and he lolls his head to the side to see his angel blade sticking out of the rocky earth beside him. Castiel blinks numbly at the silver shining in the firelight, and slowly turns back to the body still on top of his.
After wiping away the worst of the mess, Cas settles back down on the beside Dean, curled just slightly into him, his ankle wrapped underneath Dean’s.
Finally, after both of them just can’t bring themselves to yell at each other anymore, they stand there quietly, looking everywhere but one another. Dean feels too wrung out and raw from everything between yesterday and now. Everything inside him is begging him to just close the space between them and pull Castiel into his chest where he fits and belongs so perfectly.
The walk to their diner was just about fifteen minutes from the museum. Not difficult to manage, but enough that he debated on having time to actually order and eat anything. He gave a wave to of the ladies working behind the counter before making his way to the back booth where they usually sit.
“Good with what, Dean?” His tired voice comes out deep and raspy, fogging up the window. The coolness feels nice against his warm forehead.
Dean can just imagine how dramatically Charlie is rolling her eyes, and practically feel the sarcasm rolling off her. Bobby knows damn well that what she does and how beneficial it can be to their department when certain cases call for it. He seems to think that by telling them he doesn’t care how they got the information, just that it’ll help whatever needs helping, that it gives him some sort of clear conscience.
Dean winks and squeezes his wrists tighter. “I think it’s only fair to let you know that I – Dean – feels the exact same way you do. I’ve been literally
Bright lights, everything white and blinding, and muffled sounds of a voice that sounds like his brothers. Dean remembers panicking, not knowing where the hell is he. He remembers trying to breathe and not being able to. He remembers a lot of yelling, the sound of someone growling, and then everything goes black.
Castiel’s eyes snap back towards him. Dean hopes it might be the red and blue lights still dancing around them, but he’s pretty sure Cas’ eyes have a red tint.
Sam nods to the judge, a few strands of his long hair falling into his eyes that he ignores. “Thank you, your honor.” Dean watches as his brother’s eyes harden as they shift back to the man sitting on the stand, is whole body tensing, going ramrod straight.
The wipers squeak as they wipe away the melting snow from the windshield. Huh, he guesses it has been a minute since he’s bought wipers. Sometime last winter, if he’s remembering right. Damn. He’s never been so neglectful of his Baby before. When they get back to the Bobby’s he’ll definitely take the time and look her over.
After two days of doing nothing but battling his enteral wave of emotions, Dean’s thoughts stray to Bobby’s shop. Since Benny got locked up and he’s been sitting on this damn couch, no one has been running it. Even though Benny fired him before the shit went down, nothing was really in writing or whatever. Does it really even count? It’s not like he wasn’t running it before he had to sign everything over to Benny, anyway. Maybe he should just open it back up and continue without him.
Dean moans at the taste, opening up his mouth and chasing Castiel’s tongue for more. The alpha pushes Dean back until the coolness of the wall presses against his back. He breaks the kiss, turning his head to the side. Castiel nips and kisses over his jawline causing Dean to let out a whine from the back of his throat. The alpha’s stubble scrapes against his own but instead of being turned off by it, it almost feels like electricity vibrating over his skin everywhere the alpha touches. It feels amazing.
“The alpha on scene radioed in you were showing signs of shock,” he replies patiently. Dean eyes the beta’s hand hovering still too close to his back for his liking. The thought of this guy touching him rubs Dean the wrong way, making the hair on the back of his neck start to rise.
It’s not that he’s in a bad place in his life. No, not really. It’s just that when you are toeing the line of thirty and see all your friends settling down and starting little families you kind of tend to look at your life and wonder what the hell you are doing with yours exactly. Hell, even his kid brother is engaged and planning on getting hitched next year.
“Buckle up because we have a whole bunch more of these to go.” Sam says placing a hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
“So let me get this straight.” Sam pauses from his vigorous pacing back and forth in the small motel room turning to Dean. “You leave to go get drunk, Crowley finds you, fills you in on what is going on and –”
Unable to find any peace in sleep, Castiel sits up in the uncomfortable bed, clutching his chest trying to make sense of what is going on with him. His clothes – no,
“It was like…every atom in my body fighting against my mind. It wasn’t so much physical that hurt. Not really,” Dean growls in frustration before pushing off the couch and starts pacing. “It’s where he grabbed. Right on my bite. It-It-It was like
Letting out a small sigh, Dean tries to turn off his thinking by focusing on listening to Castiel move around the apartment. It’s the first time since becoming omega that he really notices a change in his hearing. He can hear Cas in the kitchen and the clinking of beer bottles being placed into the box for recycling almost as if he’s sitting in the living room. As his mate finishes cleaning up and shuffling around, he can hear his socked feet moving lightly down the hall towards the bathroom. Dean stops paying attention to give him some privacy and focuses on the light from the streetlight casting shadows on his walls. Every now and them a car passes by making the shadows grow into long, obscure shapes before quickly settling back into themselves again.
“This is my brother, Cas. I know you guys have shit or whatever, but he’s… I…” Sam swallows thickly, looking down at him with his hazel glistening. He takes in a shaky breath and Castiel nods in understanding.
His smiles drops and the thought immediately turns bitter when Dean remembers why he’s in this place in the first place. Castiel can’t even be an arm’s length away from him without looking disgusted or angry.
“Hey, look at me.” The voice fades in and out, barely audible.  Castiel looks back at the man. “You’ve been through a lot. I get it. But it’s going to be alright, okay?” He squints as Sam blurs into a mixture of colors, lights and darks. “You just gotta talk to me, okay?” The flesh toned colors move closer towards him. Castiel tries to back away from the colorful blur approaching, but his back only hits the wall. “Cas, it’s just me. Let me help you.”
“Right, well, this is the part where I say I told you two idiots so, and we chop off his arm and get rid of it,” Crowley says reaching for the demon knife sitting on the table.
Besides that, the kid has never had any professor or doctor say anything negative about him whether that be in school or job. He’s always given it his best and always strived to go above and beyond in any way possible. If trying to help omegas in any way possible isn’t something important then Dean is at a loss on what Zachariah thinks they’ve been done with the ward all this time. Isn’t the point of science and modern medicine to help people? Research and discoveries happen every day in the scientific and medical world, (or, they use to at least) so why should now be any different? With all the new information Sam always seems to have to tell him, Dean knows that someone out there is doing something for the greater good.
Every little push deeper into him he feels. Castiel swears time must have slowed down, because there is no possible way this has only been a few seconds. His whole body feels ignited in such burning agony, yet the coolness of his grace refuses to wash it away.
Three; just even thinking about it makes Dean feel sick and full of rage at the same time, but Dean is almost positive he knows (without any type of confirmation) that he cannot live without his faerie. It’s knowledge running through your veins that you’re born with.
Sam’s eyes narrow, boring into him so intensely Castiel has to hold back shifting under the stare. “What exactly does it mean to extract your grace?”
Castiel has always been good at looking at a situation, analyzing it and been able to come up with the perceived outcome. Given what is laid out in front of them, it doesn’t look promising. But with all the time he’s spent on earth with the Winchesters it’s made him discover that he can’t keep looking at the world as he use to. If he knows anything it’s the fact that these two brothers keep surprising him over and over again. Even when times have seemed the darkest, they still found that sliver of light and relight the world again.
Usually Dean can’t scent his brother. Whether it’s from working in a sterile environment all the time or just being beta, he’s never really gotten a clear smell from him. Occasionally Dean thinks he might have caught something in their rare short meets, but he hasn’t really put much thought into it. But now as Dean subtly sniffs the air, he catches the scent of old books and something like bergamot. It’s strong. Almost growing stronger, Dean thinks.
He guesses he was one of the lucky ones who had a family member with inside information. Dean learned about mating bites before the media got a hold of the information and spun it into something more than what it was. Bottom line, if an alpha bites an omega’s neck – specifically where the scent gland is – during sex they are bound together. Something about blood and chemicals that Dean really couldn’t understand, but bottom line is; don’t let anyone bite his damn neck.
When he read about asexuality he actually started crying. It was like that missing piece he’d felt all his life
Closing his eyes Dean takes in a deep breath through his nose as he counts to three, then slowly exhales through his mouth counting to three again. It's a breathing technique Cas taught him when he’d come over after Benny left when things had gotten bad.
Annoyed doesn’t even begin to cover how much he kind of hates his brother right now. More like flat out pissed. Which is actually helping him think clearer and come back to himself, which is weird, but Dean decides he’ll figure that out later. He may not have his shit all together yet, but he’s still able to have a break up without his little fucking brother stepping in and trying to, what? Threaten his boyfriend? Isn’t that suppose to be his job as a big brother? Just because he’s omega doesn’t mean he’s some de-aged damsel that needs saving.
Castiel must scent something, because he gently maneuvers and nudges Dean to his feet. Dean blinks open his eyes to the floor, refusing to raise them all the way to the car. He scents, more than feels, his brother sitting in the drivers seat beside him. Dean glances into the back seat when he hears the door closed, seeing Cas staring back at him with that soft smile.
. From his head, to his fingertips and everything in between. Castiel shifts on the seat trying to pull himself back up which only sends a sharp stinging pain through his ass.
Someone clears their throat, making both of them startle and jump apart. They both stumble off the little step, on separate sides allowing a couple to enter the diner. Cold, heavy raindrops are falling now, soaking quickly through Castiel’s sweater. He looks over at Dean, who is barely an arms length away, yet feels so much further. He gives him a little smile before raising his hand and giving him a little wave. Castiel nods his head in response, watching Dean close his eyes before tipping his head up to the rain and smiling.
Castiel stands in front of his desk and waits. They both just look at each other, staring, almost like they’re both waiting for each other to break the silence first. Castiel has so many questions he honestly doesn’t even know where to begin.
than friendly. He tries to chalk it up to just being lonely. He and the faerie have always been a bit more touchy-feely than, maybe, regular people are. It’s just sometime that always stuck since Dean was four and fascinated with being able to touch a real live faerie. As he got older it was more-or-less just to make sure the perpetual messy haired man is real. Admitting it, though, means possibly scaring away his friend who’s shown no hint of anything more than just friendship. He convinces himself to stuff it down – deep down – inside and forget about it.
He hears rustling on the line, a loud thump and then the line goes silent. Pulling out into traffic he glances down to check if they were disconnected. He frowns seeing Charlie’s still on the line. “Charlie? Hello?”
“To stop.” Cain’s eyes harden as his voice raises back to its steady tone. “The Knights found out and took and killed Colette in front of me. So I picked the Blade back up.” A smile spreads across his lips that makes Dean shift uneasily. “It felt so good to have it back in my hands. I tore through the Knights, slaughtering them all one by one. I enjoyed every minute of it; basking in their death.”
Sam scrunches up his nose again and gives him another bitchface. “Gross. Totally not what I mean, thanks.”
As just quickly as Cas filled his space, he’s gone. That fake smile that he uses when he’s out in public is beaming, using far too much teeth as he waves to someone behind Dean. Slightly knocked off kilter by the sudden loss of Cas’ presence, Dean blinks a few times before focusing back on his ex.
that he’s missing. Sitting up in the seat he runs a hand through his hair, tugging on the ends trying to wrack his brain. What is he missing? None of this even makes any sense. No one could even know Cas was in this town. He’d just gone from the car to the room, and he’s almost one hundred percent sure that no one even drove past their street the whole time.
It’s such an odd feeling after weeks of flinching or moving away from Dean, not feeling that nervousness. Instead, the old feeling of wanting to be closer tingles underneath his skin. The urge to comfort Dean is almost overwhelming, and if it were anything time Castiel would give into it, but now…now he doesn’t know
The laughter stops, eyes narrowing down at him. Dean meets her eyes, glaring back at her refusing to show any fear. Oddly enough, he doesn’t feel anything and decides to blame it on the adrenaline.
A hand comes into his view and Dean, startles, flinching away from it, almost expecting it to reach behind him and grab his neck. He glances up at the body attached to the outstretched hand, and instant relief washes over him. Despite the intense scent Castiel is giving off, Dean swears he’s never felt so safe in his whole life.
whispers over and over like scratched cd. He may not have caused the actual marks, but he did this to him.
Dean takes a few more pulls on the burning liquid, pushing himself off his car. He sways slightly, only then realizing over half the bottle is gone. Closing his shut tightly he tries to steady himself. Behind his closed lids he sees Castiel’s terrified face looking back at him. It’s like the image will be forever branded into his mind. Over and over the scene plays out again. Each time the look of fear in Castiel’s eyes makes his stomach churn inside him with disgust.
“This…This is…” Sammy shakes his head with huff of a laugh, looking down at him with eyes so full hope Dean can’t bring himself to look away. “Man! You have no idea how much information you’ve just given me that could potentially help so many other omegas! I mean, based on –”
Dean manages to drag his eyes away from Castiel shuffling off to the bathroom, and awkwardly fidgets with the room key waiting for Sam to finish whatever the hell it is that he’s doing on his computer. Castiel just gets to the bathroom, closing the door quietly when Sam announces that he’s ready to go.
After a beat of silence he feels some of the tension in Castiel’s body relax. “I just don’t understand.”
Dean can practically smell the confusion and questions coming from his alpha, but it’s too late (or early) to really give into all of it right now.
He hears the groan of the Impala door opening and closing before a shadow falls over him. “What the hell did you do?”
Dean never really understood the weight of the promise he made all those years ago until this moment.
“Zachariah knew damn well I wasn’t going to do anything until Madison and I had more of a plan,” he growls clenching his hands into fists. “He was down in the ward today, which was weird to begin with. I don’t think he’s stepped on our floor since the whole thing was established. But I get there, and Madison says he’s asking a bunch of questions about care and comfort for our patients. She says something just seems really off about the whole thing.”
Carefully, but quickly, Castiel goes through his human necessities. He will never understand how humans can keep up with the constant demands the human body requires. It’s tiresome and annoying.
Dean tilts his head just a fraction, so very close to pressing his lips against Cas’ he can feel their breaths mingling in the barely there space.
knife. He pulls it out carefully, holding it at the ready as his eyes dart back and forth around the room. Carefully he moves backwards until the heel of his boot hits the back of the wall. The air seems to grow heavier, charged with tension and something else Dean can’t seem to put his finger one, but still no one shows.
Dean’s eyes can’t seem to move from Castiel’s body. The lamp is knocked somewhere on the ground casting dark shadows over his body, but he thinks he sees blood. Is that…are his hands bound with a belt? Dean’s clenches his teeth so tightly it hurts.
“Breathe with me.” Suddenly Cas is right there, cupping his face in those soft, big hands. Dean’s body jerks at the touch, expecting some sort of hit to follow, but Cas’ touch doesn’t falter. His scent warms, bleeding out nothing but safety and warmth. Dean wants to sink into it, but he remembers the last time he let his guard down. The last time he thought he was safe. He remembers —
His narrowed eyes flick over to Dean’s face, searching for something so intensely he can’t help but squirm in the seat. Needing something to do with his hands, Dean glances away from Cas’ stare to his coffee before reaching for the mug. He wraps both hands around it, just simply enjoying the warmth it’s still giving off before lifting it and taking a drink.
“How did you know who we were?” Dean asks ignoring his question, prompting one of his own. Now that Dean knows he’s a demon he’s trying to see him as that, but it’s difficult when Cain is acting nothing like one. If anything he’s acting like your stereotypical friendly neighbor and not (according to Crowley) one of the worst ones out there.
“Cas!” Dean yells as he feels the car swerve dramatically. “You’re alright, okay? We got you. It’s going to be fine.”
Dean hits the breaks a little too soon and too hard, making Cas slam into the back of front seat with a groan. The squeak front the drivers side door opening and then slamming closed happen before he can even right himself again. Sam quickly follows, leaving Castiel in the car alone. Rubbing his forehead gingerly, Castiel contemplates exactly how to go about even approaching this.
“There is still hope for Dean to find himself, again.” Castiel argues. “We can remind him of his humanity, and give him something to hold onto.”
“And I let her take away the one thing I – we could have had it all – God! We were happy! I can’t even remember what that feels like. But I…I let her ruin it. You know the fucked up part about it?” His laugh comes out sounding more a broken sound. “I never stopped loving you.”
Castiel looks away from Cain quickly, looking over at the tree line. He doesn’t want to answer this question. Dean shouldn’t even been in this situation to have to pause for an answer. He was Castiel’s responsibly to protect, and he failed. He was too weak to save the one person who had become his whole entire existence and purpose. He had to somehow form this into words and beg for the Father of Murder’s help to cure him.
It’s more a statement than a question, but Castiel feels the need to answer it so there isn’t any room for false hope. “No,” he sighs following Sam’s gaze to the door separating them from Dean. “It doesn’t work like that. Dean’s soul was his own and when my grace touched he latched on and –”
The man squeezes his wrist just slightly before stepping closer, their chests practically touching if it wasn’t for their arms in the way. “I can’t go back to living without you.”
“Oh, so you’re Dean!” She says with a smirk, pressing herself closer against Cas. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“Wait, what?” Dean rasps out, his voice scraping the insides of his dry throat like sandpaper. He coughs and clears his throat before trying again. “Message you? I have been messaging you. You’ve never responded to me.”
Fucking betas carry on as mostly human. Their scent of smell is increased, but their anatomy is the same. They don’t submit like an omega, or posture like an alpha. They don’t have ruts or heats, and aren’t scoffed at in public. Sam and the scientists claim that an estimated seventy-five percent of the world’s population is beta.
The words for what they are hold so much more than what’s being said. The truth itself is right there, plain as day for anyone to see. And it is true. They aren’t fine. But still the words make his stomach twist, and Dean clenches his hands into fists so tightly he can feel his nails digging into his palms. Any lesser man would play it off, but tonight he doesn’t have enough left in him to keep fighting it. It hurts.
“I promise you after I finish killing Abaddon and every fucking shifter in between, I am coming to kill you next,” he growls turning away from Crowley, rubbing at the itch under his arm.
He ended up having to move not longer after that, unable to shake away the memories and emptiness of their apartment.
Castiel walks into the dirty bathroom, flipping on the light above the mirror. The light buzzes loudly, flickering for a moment unsure if it wants to obey the command and only purpose in existence. Castiel pushes on the mirror and he clicks open revealing a tube of toothpaste half gone, a toothbrush, and a stick of deodorant. Of course there would be no scissors. He should have known better than to even look. Sam would find it a personal offense if such a thing existed in the bathroom, threatening the safety of his own hair.
“Alright, you’re going off on one of your doctor rants again,” Dean chuckles as he stands up, raising his arms above his head, stretching his back. “Honestly man, I’m just wiped. I gotta check in with Benny and I just kinda want to…” He coughs and looks down at his feet hoping Sam can figure out what he’s saying without saying it.
“I want you to tilt your chin up to me like this…” He raises Dean’s chin where he needs it with his fingers. The angle makes it difficult to look at his brother without going cross eyed, so Dean settles with staring up at the ceiling. “I’m going to start at the chin working my way down and around your throat. I’ll try and finish with the mating bite last. I want you to tell me if anything hurts – scale one to ten – and describe the pain beset you can.”
The night drags on slowly. Sam eventually comes back bringing with him multiple cases of beer. He sits down in his usual spot and broods at the tv most of the night until his head starts to loll to the side. Dean loses count of how many drinks his brother has had, but figures after all the bullshit lately Sam deserves a night to get drunk and forget about shit for awhile.
Dean jerks Castiel’s body against his so forcefully that he has to close his eyes to try and steady himself. As he slowly opens them, Dean’s eyes, now darkened with lust, peer down at him with such a hunger that Castiel’s stomach twists and his mouth goes dry. He hears the sound of a belt being unbuckled, but he’s unable to break away from Dean’s eyes; those green eyes that belong to his Righteous Man he pulled from hell. Those eyes that belong to the man he’s fought beside for years, saving so many lives.
Silence stretches between long enough that Castiel begins shifting awkwardly, almost realizing just now that he’s naked, hands trying to subtly covering himself.
Dean looks around Cas’ shoulder to see Sammy standing there, worry etched over his face. He blushes in embarrassment, instantly hating that he let himself go with his brother around. Castiel’s arms slip free from around him as he turns to Sam, but makes sure to still keep an arm pressed against Dean’s.
His eyes rake over Castiel’s body, trying to take in the fact that he’s actually wearing normal clothes. The pair of dark blue jeans are hugging his thighs perfectly, and that dark green t-shirt has risen just enough Dean can see a flash of his toned, tanned stomach. It’s a combination of seeing Cas so relaxed and comfortable that has Dean unsure on what to do.
“I would love nothing more than to fall asleep with you in my arms again,” he says with a low, possessive growl in his voice. “Are you sure we it wont be too late?”
Castiel ducks his head as Dean moves his hands to Castiel’s back, gently pulling him closer. Cas bends down and rests his forehead on Dean’s chest letting out another sob. Slowly, Dean rubs slow circles in his back lifting up to place a soft kiss in his hair.
He swore his life to this man – fallen for him. They have fought together and always made it through. Castiel sets his eyes on Dean, willing himself to take a step forward. His body listens, though his breaths come out in quick gasps and his chest feels like someone is squeezing it too tightly. Forcing himself to not think about anything, Castiel grabs the lapels of Dean’s jacket with both of his hands, pulling the man closer to him so they stand nose to nose.
He sighs and picks up the lamp from the bedside table, pulling the outlet from the wall. “I’m aware.”
“Dean,” that familiar deep, rough voice says. “Are you – no, stupid, I’m sorry. You were in the hospital. How are you feeling? I was there. I swear I wanted to be there. I tried to come by, but I –”
A curly brown haired man dressed in the same dark blue clothes as the blond cautiously approaches them, scenting the air before barely glancing to Dean. “Everything okay?”
The anger took his thoughts and memories of the angel far away, locking it away in some back, dark corner of his mind to be forgotten. But all that mattered was that he could finally breathe again. It didn’t matter that the air had an iron tang of blood still in it, he was finally free.
Focusing on Sam’s fingers moving again, Dean gasps and hisses out higher numbers. Over the lower side of his unmarked neck is bad, but behind his neck Dean has to fight back the tears. His throat seems to close off, and when his brother asks for a number all Dean can do is barely shake his head. As Sam pulls back to give him a minute, Dean practically collapses over himself. The exhaustion is back, and the steady increasing brain fog doesn’t make it any better. With every painful amount of pressure felt on his neck, shadowed images of memories without faces dance on the edges of his mind.
– feels like Dean, smells like his Dean, but he isn’t. The feeling of Dean’s sweaty skin moving back and forth over his back, along with the dry thrusting makes his body feel like it’s being ripped apart from the inside out. He feels like he’s burning, and Dean is the cause of the fire.
Sammy straightens his back and slowly stands up from the stool. Almost in the blink of an eye he watches as his brother’s face shift back into serious doctor mode. Sam walks beside the machine Dean noticed when he first walked in now realizing what it is – a ultrasound machine – and pulls out a bottle from one of the holders.
Dean’s almost glad his throat feels like it’s on fire, too raw to speak, because he’s afraid of what he might say. Instead, he takes in one last deep breath of his alpha and pulls back away from him just enough that he knows it’ll be enough. Slowly Dean squints open his eyes, blinking up to the dark figure above him, silhouetted in painfully bright fluorescent lights. After a few tries to open his eyes without the light making them water, they finally adjust and Castiel comes into focus.
A chuckle comes from his mate. “Sleep, Dean. It’s been a long day for all of us. I’m off for the next two days so we can talk tomorrow.”
to stop. He just needs to give Dean’s humanity something to cling to-a reminder of what it was like to
Finally, Dean’s body relaxes, jaw loosening as he lets out a huff of a laugh. The tightly wound knot inside Castiel’s chest loosens slightly as he watches Dean shakes his head, placing the dented and slightly squished water bottle on that coffee table. Dean turns his body to mimic Cas’, giving him a soft smile. “I would hope by now you know the only person I see myself ever being with is you.”
Mind spinning with the whiplash Charlie and Bobby just threw at him, Dean fumbles for something to say. His mouth opens and closes like a fish out of water as watches Bobby stand up from behind his desk.
mean? Shaking his head and realizing he hasn’t actually spoken the words, Dean clears his throat to try again.
Clenching his uninjured hand tightly, he stops past Sam back to the Impala. He’s never done well with taking orders, especially when he doesn’t agree with them. “I will sit this out.” He says, glaring at his reflection in the window. “Not as if either of you have given me any options.” He opens the door and gets in, closing the door firmly behind him.
“Maybe. Or,” Dean says tilting his head to the side, giving Cas a wink. “You could come in and help me wash off my back.”
. He has to at least try. Castiel refuses to return to Sam with anything less than he tried the impossible.
“No,” Castiel says roughly, shaking his head. “Sam doesn’t have to. It’s…It’s fine.” He spits the last word out like venom. Nothing about this whole situation is
“Dean wanted to meet with Crowley to make some sort of deal to get your grace back. I figured we could hear what Crowley had to say and go from there, so we called him here.” Sam shifts nervously, looking him up and down as if he’s trying to assess something. “You were out cold, man. We didn’t want to wake you. Honestly, you need the rest, Cas. Hell, you still look like you need a week’s worth of sleep!” Pinching the bridge of his nose Sam squeezes his eyes shut tightly. “Nothing was waking you up, anyway.”
Three days later and finally coherent enough to process what he’s been doing for almost seventy-two hours straight, he calls his brother and tells him (in not so much detail) what’s been going on. Sam demands for Dean to get to the hospital for testing right away.
Sighing, Dean runs a hand over Castiel’s back once more before looking to his brother and giving a small nod. Time to get to work.
A sudden flash of memory of the pain from hell he’s tried so hard to repress away pierces through him. He can feel something almost like a crack inside his mind of all those memories starting to leak through. Dean shakes his head frantically trying force those memories away. They poke at the back of his mind as Dean starts seeing himself waking up in the coffin. Punching through the boards until he was breathing in dirt, digging and digging, lungs screaming for air so badly he felt like it was just another form of torture.
Dean groans, looking heavenward. How is this even his life? Is his brother really not going to let this go? “Really Sammy?”
That’s how Dean finds himself alone in his apartment, three quarters of the way through the freshly bought bottle of whiskey on the table. All the lights are off, except for the light over the stove that Castiel use to get so annoyed he’d forget to turn off and leave on after dinner.
Now, more than before, Dean wishes he could just forget tonight. Whatever wall or whatever was keeping everything that happened from today away seems to have come crumbling down, leaving everything open and bare. The reality of how close he was to being taken and ripped away from Castiel hurts like an open wound, making him sob harder into his shoulder.
“If my grace alone is what is keeping the slightest part of Dean hanging on, then maybe it is the key to saving him.”
to hit, but it never comes. Castiel scent surrounds him, practically screaming comfort and safety. He finds himself leaning into his side, slowly stopping the itching to just slowly rubbing the parts of his skin where he feels phantom touches from the two beta’s.
Dean opens his mouth to reply, but Castiel hisses in pain, his hand flying up to his lip. Dean’s body jerks to move forward off the couch and over to check on him, but he catches himself at the last minute remembering his presence is probably the last thing Castiel wants close to him.
“Dean!” He faintly hears Castiel call over everyone yelling, shooting and various other noises. His voice is more distance than his brothers, and Dean wonders how he got separated so much farther away. “Sam, I need to get to Dean.”
Dean looks around the area slowly, taking in as much of their new surroundings as he can. They’re standing on some sort of gravel drive in the middle of some wooded area. In front of them there is a house with a light on in one of the rooms that is surrounded by a white fence. It all seems somewhat normal except for the feeling in his gut telling him that something is off.
someone – just one person – managed to get this virus and somehow spread it like wildfire overnight? I call bullshit.”
Castiel feels a surge of energy come from Dean, then his muscles tighten underneath him. Castiel feels himself rising off the ground as Dean uses his feet to push them up, before he slams back to the ground again. Dean growls in frustration, thrashing his body back and forth, yelling frustration unable to get free. Castiel pants, feeling sweat from his chest cling to his shirt as more sweat drips down from his face. His body aches with strain, and everywhere he’s been hit starts to throb like the beginning of a bruise he remembers getting when he was human. Honestly, he isn’t sure how much longer he can keep this up. Castiel can feel himself growing weaker so much he can hardly feel his grace inside Dean reaching out for him.
Things wrap up pretty quickly after that when Sam’s phone buzzes and he sees the time. He insists on leaving the rest of the soup and makes Dean promise to see him in a few days to check how he’s doing and healing up. Dean agrees, not really sure if he’s lying or not about going.
Anyways! I hope this longer chapter makes up for my absence! I promise you guys I am completely FOCUSED now! Zeroed in! One hundred and ten percent on this! >_<
“Remember now?” Castiel says, stepping out into the hallway, angry tears still running down his face.
Dean tears his eyes away from Castiel to glance over at the betas standing there looking at him with twin smug expressions. It’s irritating, but with Cas standing with him he doesn’t feel as threatened or angry. Even with his scent somehow pulled back to just basic hints of something familiar, yet very alpha, Dean somehow feels safe. They’ve only known each other for a few days, technically, but Dean feels more comfortable with him than he might have ever felt with Benny. And he knew him for years. But feeling safe and getting to know him is different than trusting him.
Castiel closes his eyes and turns away from Dean, chastising himself for even having the smallest amount of hope. It was never going to work. “I can give you pointers, you know. Tell you stories about all the souls I tortured and ripped apart in Hell. Mm, their blood tastes better after they’ve been left screaming for hours. It’s almost like the fear and pain marinates their souls.”
“Whoa there buddy! Where do you think you’re going?” Meg rushes forward placing a firm hand on his shoulder preventing him from getting off the bed.
Still, Castiel refuses to let up his hold, untrusting that the chains will actually hold him. He beings dragging him towards the warded room as Dean struggles in his arms trying to get free. He’s weaker now, but Castiel doesn’t trust the false sense of security for a second. He’s seen what a Knight of Hell can do, and will not be foolish enough to put his own emotions ahead of their only shot to possibly cure Dean.
“So we need to get rid of the Mark.” Sam walks over to the bed where his duffle bag sits, and he digs through it a moment before taking out his laptop.
Castiel looks away from Sam and settles himself back down onto the couch again. The uneasiness prickles at his skin in an almost mocking way as if to remind him there is absolutely nothing he can do about anything. Dean made this potential deal to get his powers back, but at what cost? Essentially, his life – his humanity. The one thing that Castiel has sworn to protect and preserve since he fell all those years ago.
Still, having him gone this time and not being able to really see or talk to Cas this time left Dean more irritated and off than usual.
Slowly looking around the space gives Dean a chance to take in the area, waiting for something to jog his memory. Still, it remains quiet. Rolling his shoulders, he eyes the doorway leading to a dark hallway a second longer than any of the other spaces before continuing on. No one
“Thank you for your help.” Castiel tries to offer a smile, but his body doesn’t seem to have enough energy to do anything more than twitch. “I wouldn’t worry too much about Dean. More than likely he’s just drank too much and is ‘sleeping it off’, as you say, in his car. He’ll be back soon.”
Out of all the people in the the seven point seven billion humans on this planet, and all the places across the whole entire earth, never did Dean think he would see the one person he’s been trying to avoid for countless months.
He opens the door to find Sam’s fists pressed into the Impala, staring down at her hood. He looks angry, but Castiel knows better. Winchester’s have never been ones to show their emotions easily. John made it a point to drive home that any type of emotion other than anger should be considered a weakness. Oh, how he would like to go back and give that pathetic excuse for a father a piece of his mind for treating these boys like he did. It breaks him a little to see Sam subconsciously fighting so hard to keep everything bottled up so tightly. Even after all this time with John being dead, his words are still rooted so deeply inside the brother’s makeup that it makes fear rule them if something slips out of the realm of “John Winchester approved”. It’s aggravating.
He almost feels floaty now, just on the verge of passing out and waking up. All the sensations that he’s been feeling have gone numb, and nothing but a tingle across his whole body is what he feels. It feels nice, almost. The weight and rocking Dean’s body over his is almost comforting.
“It felt like someone had a vice to the inside of my head and kept tightening it. Over and over,” he pants, looking past both of them at the wall and seeing nothing except everything for what happened. “I just wanted it to stop. I tried to get away from him, but I wasn’t – I couldn’t – ”
night. He hates himself for it. He wishes more than anything he could make himself stop reliving it. He wishes so hard that his heart hurts that he was an angel again. The longing for his wings makes his heart ache so badly he rubs his chest to try and dull it.
Castiel’s injuries were healing slowly, though probably normal for being human. Functioning “normally” was getting physically easier which should’ve been a relief and probably would’ve been if he Cas wasn’t so frustrated with the limitations of his body. Sleep was easier to slip into, and if he had to guess he would bet a lot of that had to do with Dean keeping them on the move constantly. Despite not doing much, it was physically and mentally exhausting.
“Why!” Castiel screams as his wrists are grabbed and slammed against the headboard, The shifter’s  hand still in his pants grabs his flaccid cock and gives it a tug. He screams in frustration as he tries to thrash his body out from under the shifter to no avail.
Cain turns to Dean, eyebrow raised in amusement. The action has Dean stumbling to a stop. “You may let yourselves out,” he says turning and walking back into the kitchen.
Technically nine minutes and forty-three seconds, but instead of commenting he just holds out the syringe to Sam, and walks over to the chair, sitting down. Castiel tilts his head to the side, watching Sam out of the corner of his eye stepping closer. He taps the side of his neck, letting his finger rest on the spot that would be the easiest for Sam to access his grace.
The feeling of safety, comfort and mate feels like a blanket over his nerves, and Dean eases back until he feels his arm brushing against Castiel’s. Sam’s eyes shift between them, and Dean can’t help but wonder what his little brother thinks this is. Does he really think he’s just letting some alpha beat the shit out of him because of some mating bite? He should know him enough that, virus or not virus, he isn’t going to put up with anyone leaving marks on him.
“Anyone going to explain to me what the hell happened to my brother?” Sam exclaims. “Because, from where I’m standing, it looks like – ”
The Kansas stay at home order that Dean isn’t quite sure when it got put into place (because honestly it hasn’t made any fucking difference; no one is staying home.) gets revamped into curfews and small businesses begin shutting down until further notice. Thankfully, people who still have to work and need cars to get where they need to go which makes Dean essential. Score one for him, except wearing a mask when he interacts with the general public sucks. Being only one of the few places still open for oil changes makes Dean’s days ridiculously busy. Benny’s wife Andrea had begged Bobby to let Benny take a leave of absence when the virus started to hit their city. Bobby agreed, and Dean couldn’t blame her. She was eight months pregnant and terrified about losing their child.
The diner itself is more or less the same thing as the last hundred places they’ve been. The scent of oil and fried food hits Dean’s nose and his mouth starts watering while Sam scrunches up his face in mild disgust. They chose a booth in the corner, Sam facing the wall while Dean has a good view of the front door.
“Doin’ fine, Gordon. Finishing up my report for the Klaman case.” Dean narrows his eyes as he leans back in his chair, making sure to leave his body language open and as non defensive as possible.
After his heat, he breaks down and tells Sam what happened, asking if std's are still a thing, or if he needs to stop in and get checked. Sam tells him that what happened was called scent marking, and to stop in to the hospital and he’ll check him.
Castiel spins to charge at the demon, but Sam steps in front of him, arms raised. “Stop. He’s just trying to get a rise out of you.”
After taking off his undershirt and giving it to Dean, Castiel leaves an hour later promising to check in as much as he can.
Two bright blue eyes stare back at him, no long circled with black bags. A healthy looking face moves along with his as he shifts his face to the side. He watches himself in the mirror as his fingers touch his cheeks, trying to find his sunken in cheeks that he had only hours before. Castiel runs his fingertips over the start of his five o’clock shadow loving the tickling feeling he gives him. He marvels, for a moment, at the healthy glow his grace has given him. He had almost forgotten what it was like to feel “well”. Castiel blinks at the stranger, trying to rememorize himself again.
Castiel has no idea what is going on with grace other than the fact it doesn’t feel like he is quite whole. The way his body is reacting to Dean’s eyes slowly climbing up his face sends a wave of heat over his skin. The closeness of their bodies, mixed with the already hot air must be the reason his vessel react to the man in front of him.  Castiel pushes down the remaining thoughts of
Silence, or as much silence as you can find in a holding tank, settles back over them again. The guy in the corner murmurs on and off to himself while the distant clanging of metal and yells can be heard through the door. After awhile the obscure shadows the harsh fluorescent lights cast seem to twist and move, reaching for Dean’s own distorted shadow. He starts rubbing absentmindedly at his skin again, only this time he isn’t sure if he’s rubbing the blood away or more into his skin.
“Annnnd that’s enough,” she says snapping her fingers. A branch comes up and wraps around Castiel’s mouth, cutting off the rest of his words. “On that happy note, time for us to go. See you at Elysium, Clarence.”
“That pretty much explains how my day is going,” he chuckles quickly glancing down to make sure his leather wrist cuffs are still in place before tugging at the edges of his sleeves. “So anyway, how’s your…day?” The words die out on his tongue when he looks up to see Cas’ glare zeroed in on him.
Dean barely gets two steps out before someone is grabbing his shoulder, spinning him around. Dean manages to get two good, solid hits in before he’s drug behind the bar, thrown and pinned against the brick wall next to the dumpster. His cheek scrapes across the brick enough that he knows the skin is broken, but he hardly it hardly phases him. He doesn’t stop fighting.
“Let me walk you to your car,” Cas says with a small smile. It’s the kind of smile he use to give him. The one that makes his eyes crinkle at the sides just enough that Dean knows is genuine, real, just for him.
Dean pushes off of him, and Castiel hisses at the sudden, fresh pain as the cool air hits his bottom half. The stinging of his ass is breaking through the numb, and he dreads whenever the his body settles enough that he feels everything.
“You deserved so much more than some angel cast out from heaven!” He says, taking a small step towards him. “I have held your very essence in my hands, rebuilt you from my own self. When you think at night some times it’s so loud as much as I try and shut it out, I can still hear you. I hear how ashamed your are to feel the way you do. I never wanted you to feel pressured into being with someone like me –
Cas promised him it didn’t hurt, that it was an accident, but Dean couldn’t hear him past his own self-hatred drowning out the words. He couldn’t help feeling that he was just like Benny.
“They just wouldn’t stop bothering you and I wasn’t thinking,” he says. “I lost control control. Again.” Dean hears him sigh, but can’t bring himself to move his head up to even look at him. “I don’t know what it is about you, but I can’t seem to control myself when it comes to you.”
“M’good,” Dean says, taking in a breath and letting it out slow. “I’m good.” He reaches for the handle of his car and pulls it open. “I’ll follow you, okay?”
A gunshot goes off followed by the sounds of glass breaking somewhere closer than the last few times. Castiel snaps out of whatever trance he has been in, body tensing. He tries to pull back from Dean, hissing against the hold Dean still has in his hair. Dean pulls Castiel’s face close to his, again, and chuckles, eyes reflecting the fires around him.
No…No that can’t be right. He didn’t kiss Cas until he had his own apartment. They were just friends until that one night he left a bruise on Cas' face.
Not expecting another heat – or whatever this is – so soon Dean hasn’t had any time to restock on supplies. Instead of having his case of water beside his bed, he has an empty cup from who knows how long ago and not enough energy to refill it. His phone dings again with another message. It’s been doing that all night, but he hasn’t had the energy or the want to check it. Maybe Sam actually found something but doesn’t want to come over and be traumatized?
“Cas?” Dean’s whole body seems to awaken, sudden filled with energy out of nowhere simply by hearing the name of his alpha.
“I have a certain skill set,” he says with a smirk before leaning forward and placing a chaste kiss over Dean’s lips. “I can promise you I never kill someone who doesn’t deserve it.” He kisses across his jawline, and Dean can’t help but tip his head to the side to give Cas better access. “You you’re safe with me.”
As he catches himself staring at Cas again, he ducks his head, ears burning as he wonders for the thousandth time if maybe Cas feels something for him too. Sometimes Dean thinks he might, maybe, but then there are times when he says something or does something that throws the thought right back out the window. Back in their college days Dean actually wondered if Cas might be asexual, not that it would ever be an issue, of course. He’s never seen the guy hook up with anyone. Even now, Castiel claims he’s too busy with work to have time for a relationship.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Dean says sliding the Blade along Sam’s neck making him hiss in pain. “That is exactly what I want to do,”
It dawns on Dean, for whatever reason, that even though they’ve been together all this time, neither one of them as ever said those three little words. They’ve done it in other ways, certain actions, but the actual words themselves…
“I figured that was your problem. Not gettin’ any, right?” Gordon brings his arms down, placing them on the edge of his desk as he leans over, leering across at Dean. “Your guy was good lookin’ enough. I don’t get the whole wanting to stick my dick up another guys ass, but whatever floats your boat. An open willing hole is just as good as any. But then I overheard you and that red headed lesbian talking and your guy ain’t even putting out!”
future, you and I.” Smiling down at him, Cas softly traces Dean’s lips with his finger. “I love you, Dean Winchester. I think I’ve always loved you, even before I knew I was capable of it. I don’t know why I never said, but I know the feeling was always there.
Dean sees Castiel move out of the corner of his eye, but instead of meeting his eyes or even caring, he just hangs his head. It’s all too much. “They needed to break the first seal to start everything or whatever, I know. I get it. It was forever ago. I should be over it.”
“Sir,” the lady says taking a step back. Castiel’s eyes flick down to her hand lowering towards the desk. Realization hits him that she’s got an emergency panic button silently calling police to her aid if she pushes it. “I need you to calm down, okay? Do you have an appointment with the Chief? Is he expecting you?”
“You caught my scent, felt something was wrong with some guy you barely said a few words to, and found it your life’s mission to try and save me from whatever doom your alpha thought I was in?”
After a bit of coaxing and just letting Cas’ scent relax him, Dean lets his alpha help him to the couch. Castiel disappears for a moment only to return with a glass of water and an apology that he has to leave to change uniforms before filing the report before his shift starts.
Castiel isn’t sure who moves first, or maybe both of them finally give into the undeniable pull of one another’s orbit, but their lips find and slot together easily as if no time has passed between them. It’s a gentle dance, relearning how Dean’s soft lips move against his own. All too soon Castiel finds himself spinning, drunk on the remembrance of it. Intoxicated by the taste of him, Cas lets his tongue slip out, teasing the seam of Dean’s lips.
Breathing a sigh of relief Dean asks, “Shouldn’t you be at work?” He twists around on the couch to see Sam still in his wrinkled scrubs, angrily kicking off his shoes, looking less composed and put together than he usually is.
Turning to the voice, he opens his mouth to ask what the hell is going on, but the words turn to dust in his mouth the moment his eyes lay on the man. Castiel is sitting there, leaning back on his arms with head tipped back just soaking in the sunlight without any car in the world. But that isn’t what makes Dean lose his words.
Castiel feels like every emotion he hasn’t known he was keeping bottled up for weeks bubbling to the surface all at once, unsure as to why or how to stop it. All he knows in this moment is that his chest
Mumbling out “excuse me’s” and apologies through gritted teeth, Dean presses into the crowd trying to get away, but his voice keeps getting closer. It’s almost like those nightmares he use to get early on in their relationship. The ones where he was always running, but it was never fast enough. In the end he was always caught. In the end –
