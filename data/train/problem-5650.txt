Steve scoffed, annoyed. “I can’t believe the council tried to hold my right to the throne over my head like some kind of bargain chip. Your rights as a human being are more important to me than their sulking.”
“You have no say in this,” Tony informed him as he stepped up to the table, elbowing Natasha out of the way and ignoring her glare. “I’ll take a small force with me and we’ll execute Natasha’s plan while you deal with Schmidt and his army once and for all.”
Tony relaxes and a smile he knows screams seduction and promises untold pleasures slowly stretches his mouth. It’s been a while but Tony remembers how it’s done.
“And I meant what I said, Steve. I don’t know how to submit so anyone; alpha, beta, another omega. It’s not in my nature.”
“Hail Consort Stark,” Steve declared as he placed the crown on Tony’s head. “May your days be blessed.”
Ah well, it was true so Steve couldn’t be too bothered to care. If everyone had such an amazing mate as he had, they’d want to do it all the time too. He anchored a hand at the small of Tony’s back, rubbing gently. Tony shut his eyes in bliss as his muscles slowly softened under Steve’s touch.
“I can’t compete with that, Steve,” Tony rasps thickly, breathing hard, and Steve looks at him with one of the most loving gazes Tony has ever seen directed at him.
of him - not even a freaking finger, what the hell? - danced around in his mind’s eye. He couldn’t even remember if he’d told Steve he loved him.
Bedecked in his most expensive finery, Tony mostly feels like a wandering mannequin. He’s more eager than usual to have the night over and done with, so he can take his mate back here and have Steve make good on his unspoken promise of pleasures to come. “So, what did the mysterious paper say, other than to transfer ownership, of course?” Tony asks as he reaches for the last pieces of ornament to adorn himself with.
“You’re fired, all of you,” Tony sulked and crossed his arms over his chest with a huff; trying to look as dignified as a grown, pregnant omega could while resting in his mate’s warm, strong arms.
“I’ll just wait here then!” Bucky said loudly as Steve jumped the nearest man, bashing him in the back of the head with the shield. Tony made quick work of another and together they finished the men off before they knew what had happened.
“Honestly,” Rhia huffed with her hands on her hips. She reached down to help Peter up from the floor, their features mirror images of each other. The twins were twelve and copies of Tony, down to the black hair and brown eyes. They were omegas, just like Tony and so smart it was baffling at times. Steve was so proud of all of them he could burst with it.
“Did you want anything, Tony?” Steve said loudly, interrupting Tony extolling all of Thor’s physical attributes.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck with a deep, heartfelt sigh. “I-I don’t know what to do here, Tony.”
“I’m...” He swallows and sniffles into Steve's shoulder before he tries again. “I’m... same. I feel the same”, he whispers. Steve’s hand combs through his hair, ignoring the way he’s messing up the strands and knocks loose the band over Tony’s forehead and the pearls and ornaments in the process. They rain down on the carpet, falling and scattering around their feet like a river of metal, gold and precious gems.
And now Steve was gone, only the lingering smell of him suspended like a wraith in the quiet room for company. Tony couldn’t really blame Steve for leaving. He’d shown him the messiest, most desperate parts of himself during these last days; Steve wasn’t to blame for not wanting to deal with that. It wasn’t like Tony wanted to deal with them either.
“Er… I’m sure it won’t do any harm to let this gentleman join us, Omega Stark,” he said at length, when Tony’s skin was starting to itch from the tension floating in the air.
Thor was a wonderful dancer, moving gracefully around the turns of the dance despite his size. Tony felt like a princess as Thor held him at a respectful distance, never once trying anything inappropriate.
“Yeah,” Tony choked, shifting minutely on the length splitting him wide, getting a feel for it. Sparks of pleasure bloomed when Steve hit his prostate perfectly, and he moaned lowly. “Better than good.”
“Hello,” Tony said, forcing himself to sound calm and professional, which was hard for him even on the best of days. A people-person he was not; he knew himself well enough to admit that.
Straightening and leaning back to sit fully on Steve’s cock, sharp smile curving his mouth, Tony ground down and took in the way it made Steve’s eyes roll back, lids fluttering shut over glazed, blue eyes.
“Because you’re not there!” Tony yelled. “I’m not going to let you go on your merry way towards an honorable death or whatever. If you’re here, I’m here!”
“Yeah?” Tony let go and Bucky’s knees immediately folded. “Thought so.” He took a firm grip around Bucky’s waist and started walking, leaving his friend with little choice but to come along. They picked their way down the path slowly, keeping an attentive eye on loose rocks so not to slip and get a fast trip down the steep slope.
He stared after Tony when he went, longing so deep it hurt gripping his heart. What would he do if Tony never said yes? What would he do with the rest of his life if he didn’t get to have Tony at his side? Steve refused to let thoughts like that get a grip on him. He would win Tony over; he would show Tony how serious he was about changing the laws and that he could make Tony happy. Tony would never have to look at Steve with doubt or worry, he would make sure of it.
Where were his men? A soldier only partially armored - in the western style favored by Doom’s men - stepped through the curtain of smoke, swinging his broad sword at Steve’s head. He ducked under the sword and bashed his shield right in the man’s face, making him stumble back and trip over another fallen soldier behind him. He had taken down so many enemies already, he couldn’t keep count of them all.
“You were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen; the alpha was growling and demanding you step aside and let him get his omega but you refused. You spat in his face and told him to stop justifying his need to abuse his mate just because he had a small dick.”
Tony was already waiting for him there, a step down from the top of the raised dais, kneeling all dolled up and pretty on an ornate pillow. How Pepper had managed that, Steve would never figure out. Maybe it was best not to think about it too much, his head already ached from how tight his hair was braided.
That was the only thought keeping him sane so far; the knowledge that his family was safe and beyond Schmidt’s reach. Steve refused to think about what Schmidt would’ve done if he’d gotten his hands on Tony too. The mere suggestion – and there had been many during his “sessions” with Schmidt – of him coming anywhere near Tony sent Steve into apoplectic rage.
They’d both refused to listen to the ones opposing their mating, the ones accusing Tony of using Steve and taking advantage of him to elevate his social status from commoner to royalty. So many had pulled Steve aside, thinking they were doing him a favor when they warned Steve about Tony’s past as an escort, that Tony was
Tony awoke slowly, consciousness returning in increments with a splitting headache and the pressure of a too full bladder blaring for release tagging along. Groaning, Tony rolled over and tried to sit up. He ached all over, his head and backside complaining the most.
Steve took a step back, shaken. He’d never thought about that; what going into battle and making Tony sit and wait at home would do to him. It was worth a second thought, because it was like he was finally able to see Tony clearly, and Steve noticed the blood running down his face.
“Do you know anything about some kid of breeding chambers?” Steve asked after a long stretch of silence. He didn’t like how his voice quivered, from fear or the cold; either way, he didn’t like it.
He didn’t like his fellow peers anymore than they liked him; Bucky was the only exception and that was because Bucky wasn’t a noble like the rest of them. Bucky was a commoner sent to train as a squire at the castle and they’d been as thick as thieves from the age of five, when Bucky had defended Steve against another older and much bigger boy also in training.
“How about I’ll stay here for another hour and I’ll have this handsome gentleman escort me back in time for dinner?” Tony motioned to Rhodes.
Tony opened his eyes, nose wrinkling in confusion. “What’s wrong?” he asked, hands stroking Steve’s muscular shoulders lovingly.
“I… can't help it,” Steve groaned, trembling grip slipping on Tony’s hips from the combination of oils and sweat.
Steve shrugged, as if it was totally normal for him to be out and about in this part of Manhattan at a time of night when most nobles kept themselves in relative safety and comfort in their homes on the Upper East Side.
“No-it’s Rogers – I mean Steve. Please call me Steve,” Steve entreated, the blush now staining his cheeks and the tip of his ears red. Tony thought he could hear snickering from outside but he couldn’t be sure. Probably just some kids playing or something.
Tony thought he was furious before. He was wrong. “You fucking jerk!” The anger steals his words, makes him unable to even form them. Quick as a whip he’s at the door with a hand on the handle. He can’t be here right now; he’s going to fucking kill Steve if he has to be in the same room a second longer.
“You want to find out why right now?” Tony wondered and ground down, making Steve choke and his eyes fluttered closed for a second when the pressure threatened to engage his knot. Tony kept up a steady grind and it was all Steve could do not to lose himself in the feeling of Tony tight and hot around him, his channel rippling around his throbbing cock.
“This is the most precious gem in my collection, a gift worthy of, well, kings.” Stone gives a small chuckle, like he thinks he’s funny with that stupid pun. Tony has a hard time not curling his lip in disgust. Steve’s hand lands on his knee under the table and gives a light squeeze. Steve’s face is politely attentive, but Tony can see the displeased expression in his eyes. He’s no more approving of Stone’s words than Tony is. Tony hates when people talk about omegas as objects, like they’re trinkets or things to be collected, polished and displayed then put away for another day.
Steve raised his shield again, ready to take another enemy down if necessary, but he froze when the man came close enough to make out his face underneath the simple helmet. Steve dropped his shield in shock, fingers tingling as blood flooded back into them. He’d clutched the straps desperately during the hours since he’d entered this hell, too afraid to lose his primary weapon. The one Tony had made him.
Deflating at Tony’s small voice, Steve sighs heavily and nods “Yeah I did. Nat’s contact sent me the intel last week.”
Tony nodded at the schematics. “I can see it from here. If you change the -“ He stepped up to the drawing table and went off sprouting numbers, percentages and degrees without noticing their astonishment. Within ten minutes, Tony had discarded the diagrams entirely and was drawing a new one with sharp, confident movements, holding them all in awed capture as something revolutionary took form before their very eyes.
Tony felt ashamed. He’d put his foot in his mouth and reminded Bruce about his failed mating with that dick, Rumlow, and now the little glimpse of good mood they had was ruined.
“Then I only wish for you to not think ill of him. He goes against even his father’s wishes in his pursuit of you. You cannot see how deeply his love for you goes, when he has gone to such lengths just to grant you happiness, even if he has nothing to gain from it.”
“That was a ballsy move,” Tony finally manages to get out, at length. “It could’ve gone very wrong.”
“Oh man, I can’t miss it. I’m gonna go get Bucky, he’s going to love this.” Clint giggled with glee and hurried out of the room. Steve sighed heavily and shook his head after him.
“Twins?” Steve froze in the middle of a step and turned to stare at Tony. “You had twins? As in more than one?”
“I should go back out there and kill them all!” Steve snarled from between clenched teeth. “Fucking bastards, attacking a lone omega that way.”
Their harsh breaths were the only sounds in the room for a while, as they basked in this perfect moment. Tony cracked one eye open and glanced at Steve’s face, taking in his blissed-out expression with a small, satisfied smile.
“I keep track of your cycles?” Steve says, a little shell shocked. “And you always get this scent, when you’re pregnant.” He looks a little bashful. “It’s actually one of my favorite scents.”
“Nat took care of him when we raided the… labs.” Tony made a face as if he was smelling something bad. “He was spouting off about creating some type of super-soldier, you being the first.”
He was gentle as he placed it around Tony’s throat, the metal cold at first but quickly warming when in contact with his skin. Tony bowed his head so Steve could fasten it and the feeling of his calloused fingers on his skin made his breath hitch.
“What’s that?” Steve grunted, hissing through clenched teeth when Tony squeezed his inner walls around the hard cock sliding in and out of him, hands planted on Steve’s firm pectorals for balance.
It was a little snug around his waist right now though, thanks to the baby growing inside of him. When Steve looked at him and thought about their unborn child, something inside of him rebelled. Before Tony could move, Steve had his arms around him, hugging him tightly.
The big alpha was smiling kindly down at him, his straight teeth gleaming in the light from hundreds of lit candles and torches.
Steve stood on shaky legs and looked around, drinking in the breathtaking view. They were almost at the top of the mountain, Brooklyn spreading out before them in the distance. It was almost dawn; Steve could see the sky brightening in the east as night slowly fell away. He spotted a path leading down into the valley below, narrow but seemingly well maintained.
Steve holds his arm out for Tony to take, leading him towards the banquet hall and the feast awaiting them.
“You’re always so fucking considerate,” Tony huffed angrily and crossed his arms over his chest with a pout, locking his eyes at a spot on the ceiling.
“I got you,” Tony said, weak but surer because of it. “I’m right here with you, Steve.” He clenched and swiveled his hips, gasping at the feeling of Steve’s knot thickening just inside of his entrance. “I need your knot, Steve. Give it to me.” Tony had meant it to come out like a command, but it morphed into a plea somewhere; he was too frantic for Steve to finally claim him to be bothered by it.
Bucky and Sam laughed while Steve’s mind spiraled into dirty thoughts about Tony and dicks and what fun they could have with each other’s.
“I don’t know,” Tony croaked. He didn’t have the courage to tell Steve how grateful he was that he was still there, that he hadn’t left Tony all alone. He was so sick of being alone.
Tony nodded, satisfied with the knowledge that they wouldn’t freeze to death and handed Steve his shield; the familiar feeling of it in his hand like an old friend coming home.
Steve leaned in to kiss his mate, filling it with as much love and thankfulness he could manage. “Yes. Thank you for coming after me.”
Though his brain was mostly filled with visions of Steve bending him over, mounting him and rutting into Tony’s willing body, Tony had to admire Steve’s sweet nature. How many alphas would refuse to touch an omega in Heat while they begged for a knot? Steve sure was tenacious, Tony had to give him that.
Tony’s heart is breaking inside of him, that’s what the tearing sensation in his chest is. He gets derailed from self-implosion when he feels it: a hand on his bare thigh, snuck inside the fold of his waistcloth. Stiffening in his seat, Tony glances at Stone, who smiles innocently even as his hand slides further up Tony’s leg.
“No even one bit,” Steve replied solemnly. “It’s my intention to change all of that the day I’m sitting on the throne.” He watched the play for a moment but could obviously barely stand it - it truly was a piece of shit - and turned to look at Tony again. “Hopefully I’ll have you by my side when I do,” he said softly, intimately. His eyes were so blue and so close. Tony could see how sincere Steve was; he truly believed what he was saying. Tony couldn’t let the burgeoning hope in his heart grow further. He quenched it brutally.
“Why didn’t you stop me?” Tony hissed, nearly spilling the wine all over his red and yellow waistcloth. It was his best but you couldn’t tell from its threadbare state. Bruce’s wasn’t any fancier, though the green muslin really brought out the color in his hazel eyes. Even though the guards hadn’t even lifted an eyebrow when they’d entered, Tony didn’t think he’d imagined their judgmental stares, or the way some of them had sneered.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony didn’t get offended this time. He was trying something new, along with his new status as a royalty and claimed; he was going to set his insecurities to the side for a while and just listen.
When Stone re-takes his seat next to Tony and the little tramp omega has slithered into the empty one left of Steve, the night becomes something out of Tony’s imaginings of what hell must be like. Stone yammers on and on about all of Hani’s attributes in Tony’s ear, and Hani has all but fused himself to Steve’s arm, touching him all the time with a simpering smile plastered on his face. Steve listens attentively while Hani speaks to him; he doesn’t seem to mind the hunger in Hani’s eyes nor the way he closes his long fingers around Steve’s bicep.
Steve started to laugh. Tony and Bucky stared at him like he’d lost his mind but he couldn’t help it. “What the – what the hell did you come up with to make this place go up in flames like that?” he managed to get out through his mirth. He felt awful but at the same time not? He didn’t know what Schmidt had forced him to drink during his captivity – some kind of elixir, he’d said -  but whatever it was, it was making him feel like he’d just taken a stroll through a park, but at the same time he felt like collapsing into a bed and sleeping for at least week. Maybe two.
At the edge of the market square he witnessed a hulking mass of an alpha towering over a small, slight omega in front of him. How Steve knew he was an omega with just a glance, he had no idea. There was just a feeling in his hind-brain screaming when he laid eyes on the most beautiful boy he’d ever seen.
As lousy as his father had been, he’d sometimes said things that Tony had taken to heart. Even if he’d been a big asshole, those small pearls of dubious wisdom were sometimes the only thing saving Tony in awkward situations.
Finishing off the braid, he makes fast work of securing the end with a cord and starts on the second.
“How do you know more about this than I do? You’re an alpha, you’re not supposed to care about crap like that.”
“I-I would like to say no,” Bruce began, slowly, “but that would be a lie. Brock wasn’t like that in the beginning. He changed when he lost his job and started drinking. I’m not saying that it’s okay, how he treated me,” he hurriedly assured, noticing the look in Tony’s eyes. “What I am saying is that, for the first few years, we were happy. I loved him very much and he loved me too, once upon a time. I can’t regret the happiness we gave each other before it went wrong.”
He feels more than hears when Steve comes in after him. Steve almost never makes a noise if he doesn’t want you to hear. Tony has become, over the years, very accustomed to the way the air in a room changes when Steve enters it. It’s something about the way his energy fills every space he occupies and the way his scent always fills Tony’s nose, no matter how subtle.
“It’s just-“ Steve trailed off when Tony leaned in to nibble on his earlobe and Steve’s eyes rolled back. “Uh- I haven’t –
Tony thought he could be excused for the high-pitched squeak he gave when he finally removed the lid and bared the content to his eyes. He was astonished, unable to form a reply, his mouth opening and closing like a fish on dry land.
Tony looked down on them, on their beautiful, perfect faces – content and half-sleeping even as they nursed the bottles with ferocious hunger. They were Steve’s kids alright. It broke his heart to leave them and Patrick behind, even for a short period of time.
In the midst of working himself up to what looked like an epic rant of self-recrimination, Steve paused, took in Tony’s sated, blissful face, and said, “Oh.”
“Making love to you,” Steve hummed, teeth flashing in a savage smile when Tony bared his neck with a mewl of pleasure. “I figured,” he whispered, bending down to nose at the nook beneath his ear, “that if we’re gonna fight, we can skip the fighting and go right to making up. I’ve heard it’s the best part.”
“…alright. Steve.” Tony rolled the name off his tongue, liking the way it felt to say it. “What can I help you with?”
“No,” Tony denied, mouthing at Steve’s rock-hard cock with barely there licks and light, sucking, kisses. Steve’s flesh throbbed against his tongue and he lapped at the swollen glans, at the pre-cum beading there. It exploded in a burst of salt and something that was uniquely Steve in his mouth; his own, neglected cock jerking while his backside grew increasingly slick.
“You wouldn’t understand,” Tony mumbled petulantly and took a sip, glancing into the glass appreciatively. Wow, they really had the good stuff at shindigs like this.
But the arrogant look on Lord Stone’s face, when he approached the throne earlier, especially the hungry gaze directed at Tony - kneeling beside Steve’s ornate chair on an equally ornate cushion- now has a niggling of doubt swirling in the back of his mind.
Tony was fighting against the drunk alpha as much as his biology at this point. His instincts wanted him to drop to his knees and present himself, the need for a knot growing exponentially in his blood. His brain screamed at him to resist, however, to fight and get away. No one but Steve was meant to touch him, Steve was the only one he wanted to mate with, he was
Bucky was silent for a long moment before he spoke up, kinder this time. “It wasn’t your fault, Steve.”
“Nothing, alpha,” Tony demurs and lowers his lashes to send Steve a coquettish look from underneath them.
“Then why?” To Tony’s shame he starts to cry; big, fat drops run down his cheeks and drip down onto Steve’s arms.
Steve was honest and always kept his word. With the king’s health waning, Steve was stepping in more and more to help his father, leaving him less time to spare to visit Tony and Bruce, but Tony had heard that certain laws were on the table for amendments. Laws concerning omegas.
Tony frowned. Why was Steve looking worried? He shouldn’t be. Tony had never felt this good in his life. “I feel… amazing,” Tony settled on, when his brain caught up and some resemblance of intelligence surfaced enough to give him back the ability to form and understand words properly.
“I-well I…” Steve cut himself off with a frustrated huff and raked a hand through his hair, fingers snagging in the hairstyle. A few pearls came loose from it. “Damn it,” Steve swore and seeming to give up, he let his hand fall to his side and thrust the other out to Tony.
“Aw, hell,” Bucky sighed from right behind him. He could tell what Steve was thinking without a single glance at him, just taking in the scene before them was enough.
“They-they didn’t have the time to- “ Tony had to stop and swallow when the realization of how close those men had come to raping him slammed into him. He tried to suppress a new wave of tears and the accompanying sobs. “They didn’t get a chance to do more than break my nose and hold me down. They didn’t… they didn’t rape me.”
“I love you too, Tony, just as you are; messy, cranky, sassy, stubborn… anything you want to give me, I’ll gladly accept and keep.”
“Tripe about omegas,” Steve replied grimly. “They’ve been saying to him that omegas can’t sign up for drafting or fight in the army, among other things. And he’s listened.”
Tony hates it when he’s right. After the dinner, where he’s been forced to sit beside Lord -please call me Ty – Tiberius Stone, and listen to him brag about everything but how thick his knot is, the big-headed lord finally makes his move. He gets up and saunters in front of the head table, making a gesture to an aid who waits at the far end of the hall. The man nods quickly and then slides out of the doors.
Carefully, Steve stepped closer. Bucky tried again to hold him back but it was no use. He wanted – no, he needed – to talk to Tony. It was a compulsion screaming inside of him too loud to ignore. Steve was helpless in the face of the immediate feeling of
“I think they got out further down the mountain,” Tony replied between coughs. “This place is a huge fucking maze; it stretches for miles inside the foothill and has several exits.”
What if Steve suddenly finds himself wanting someone like that? Someone who isn’t scarred from three pregnancies, or battles he shouldn’t have been allowed to fight in, or someone who doesn't talk back and argue every time Steve expresses an opinion Tony doesn't agree with. What if he’s gotten too old to hold Steve’s interest anymore?
“And you came charging in like a white knight and punched him right back,” Tony murmurs with a small laugh.
He’d had everything planned out, before those alphas had put him in the worst position ever. He’d invite Steve over for dinner – never mind the fact that Tony couldn’t cook to save his life – and after having a pleasant meal – Tony had asked Bruce if he’d make it, he was a freaking genius in a kitchen – Tony had had every intention to calmly and graciously accept Steve’s courtship.
?” Steve yelled back, rage slowly filling him when he realized that it actually was Tony, here, with him. On a fucking battlefield.
That made the others burst out laughing. Tony pretended that didn’t hurt even though the omega had nailed one of Tony’s biggest insecurities right on the head.
“Go, dance with him, I’ll be fine here,” Tony whispers and holds back from saying what’s really on his mind. Stone seems all too eager to listen in to them, and even though Steve seems far from convinced, he gives a sharp nod and escorts Hani to the middle of the floor with a polite: “It would be my pleasure.” Tony doesn't want to look at them but he can’t tear his eyes away. They look so good together; they move gracefully in the steps of the dance, Steve regal and calm and Hani gracefully following, adoration shining in his eyes.
“You are mine. All mine.” Tony couldn’t help the gravely way his voice had turned, or how he moved his pelvis in small circles against Steve’s, pressing their erections together again and again, making them moan into each other’s mouths.
He keeps his body still and face impassive when Stone leans in closer. “Hani’s truly a masterpiece, isn’t he?” Stone speaks lowly, forcing intimacy where it’s not welcome. “Just look at your alpha. He’s really taken by him.”
Steve supposed that he’d learn and grow out of it, just like he’d done. Rhia could never leave Patrick be when he got into one of his strops and had to nitpick at him until Patrick’s temper often got the better of him. She loved to poke holes in arguments with cutting logic, a trait she got from Tony.
“The treaty was a sham, all along, right? Stane most likely sent you here to divide and conquer and then he’ll sweep in and try to usurp the throne when Steve and I are busy with the havoc you hoped to wreak. That’s it, isn’t it?”
Finally, allowed to move after letting Tony do his duty as consort, Steve turns to look Tony in the eye. “What thoughts are running through that beautiful head of yours?” He smiles, and Tony can’t help but smile back. By the gods how he loves this man; his mate, lover and king, with an intensity bordering on obsession.
“Yes, you certainly are” Tony breathed, shivering when heat speared through him, as Steve’s scent grew sharper, muskier, and his cock twitched against Tony’s, making them groan and close their eyes in bliss. Steve’s hands didn’t stay idle, where they rested on Tony’s hips, slowly sliding underneath the waistband of Tony’s loincloth, scalding hot against his lower back, fingers grazing the top of his buttocks.
Hani bows gracefully, his motions loose and confident. “I thank your Majesty and his consort, for having me here tonight.”
“Pretty words from someone who has never had to think about his privilege for a day in his life,” Tony said at length, cold and hard. “You want to change the laws? That’s all well and good, I’ll welcome it if it happens, but I won’t hold my breath.”
“I think it went rather well, actually”, Steve says, hesitantly. He comes up behind Tony and touches his shoulders. Tony moves away sharply, out of his grasp. “What’s the matter?”
Tony looked after him and mourned the money he would never see now and the rent he would have to find another way to pay.
“This is surreal,” Tony muttered when Thor executed a perfect twist, twirling Tony around expertly. Tony thanked the Gods his mother had taught him to dance when he was little. They’d laughed as they’d staggered around the table in their small kitchen, Tony standing on Maria’s feet with the sun shining in and painting their hovel in warm tones as they’d danced and danced. It was one of Tony’s most treasured memories of his mother.
Lastly, Steve cards his fingers through Tony’s hair, loosening the cord holding it in its tail, so it spills down over his shoulders. He smiles at the silver glimmering in between the black strands. “This is the proof of someone who has endured and fought and survived to reach an older age, who has been granted the gift to grow older with his mate.”
Tony ducked shyly but Steve’s fingers around his chin held him up. “Never lower your gaze when I’m complimenting you, Tony. I mean every word.”
Tony has never wished for a pair of pants so hard in his life, and he hates the fact that he has to sit there and smile and be nice in his ceremonial outfit, which consists of little else but silk and jewels, and is forbidden by social customs from knocking Stone’s teeth out of his smarmy mouth with his fist. Tony wishes he could signal Nat and know she’d take care of this stuck up alpha, who thinks he can lay his hand on Tony without repercussions. But the treaty depends on Stone’s cooperation. Tony can’t – won’t – ruin this. They can’t afford to.
He’d never felt more relaxed in his life, resting atop of Steve with his mate’s hard cock safely held within his body, binding them together intimately in a ritual as old as time, just the way nature had intended. Alpha and Omega, two halves of a whole, joined as one in fleeting moments like these.
“Really?” Tony didn’t like how small that came out, but he was so out of his element and not sure how to act.
Steve’s hands gently stroke the stretchmarks on his stomach, hand flattening over Tony’s still flat abs. “I see someone who has carried, nurtured and birthed life to three, wonderful children. These are the marks of someone who has made his mate the happiest man in the world, and who’s sacrificed his body for many months to make that happen. Someone who’s soon going to give me another wonder to take care of and love with all my heart.”
Tony didn’t like the feeling of exposure creeping over him. Was he really so transparent that even a virtual stranger could read him that easily?
“I think we should hurry,” Tony agreed. “We’ve rigged this place to blow up in about…” A distant sound of an explosion resounded; the walls around them shook and the floor trembled as a mighty roar grew from somewhere deep inside the keep.
“Fucking Hammer,” Tony swore. He grabbed a quill and dipped it in the inkwell, slashing over the calculations and words with what could only be described as vicious glee. “I’ll show him a fucking siege engine. I can’t believe we commissioned that quack; who authorized this?”
Tony managed to drag himself over to the privy, where he did his business and then fell back into bed when he returned with a disgruntled noise, the stink of Heat, sweat, slick and Steve assaulting his nose. It smelled like the best thing ever – their combined scents sweeter than any perfume.
Tony can’t tear himself from Steve’s intense gaze. A horde of wild horses trotting through their room wouldn’t have been enough to rip his eyes from his husband’s in that moment. “What-” Tony runs his tongue across his bottom lip and Steve’s eyes quickly dips to follow the motion, his pupils growing bigger at the sight. “What do you mean?” Tony hasn’t felt this small and insecure since before Steve had claimed him. It’s not a feeling he’s missed.
“I’m not the one with a chip on my shoulder.” Bucky shrugged when Steve glared. “Sorry, pal, but it’s true. Ever since Tony rejected you, you’ve been like a bear with a stomach ache.”
They lay on the cold, frosty ground for a long moment, catching their breaths. Steve had never been so glad to breathe fresh air, dragging it into his heaving lungs; it burned and made him cough weakly but he didn’t care. He was finally free of that dreadful prison.
Tony can’t really claim the high ground here and pretend like he’s never been jealous when other omegas have eyed Steve with lust and thrown him coy glances over the years, but he likes to think that he’s above such things as insecurity on where he stands with Steve. Their relationship has always been passionate and permeated with a deep love, which has, at times, left Tony both befuddled and nearly afraid of how deep it runs in him.
“Steve just wants me for the challenge,” Tony said derisively. “He’s like all of the other alphas: they like us for the hunt and the twisted pleasure of having us fall for them, only to leave us in the dust or treat us like dirt after they’ve gotten what they wanted.”
They rule side by side and have seen to it that every omega in their land has the same opportunities as alphas and betas. Inside their borders, omegas never have to lie awake at night and wonder what their fate will be, if they’re going to be forced by their parents or guardians to marry someone they don’t want to. They have all the power to choose for themselves. This has, unfortunately, not made them very popular with other countries governed by more… conservative regents.
Unfazed in the face of their nakedness, she pursed her lips and snapped her fingers, pointing at them firmly. “His Highness and his fiancée need a bath. Take Omega Stark to the other room.”
“Was it worth it? Letting Rumlow claim you?” Tony asked, genuinely curious. He wanted to know if Bruce had ever regretted giving his heart away, only to have it stomped on later on.
Even twenty years later, Steve has never told him what he thinks is so special about Tony that he just had to claim him, way back then. Sighing, Tony ties off the last braid and quickly interlaces the three together, completing the hairstyle marking Steve as King and Highest Alpha, the one who rules their little land and commands their army.
“I’ll meet you at the gate in thirty minutes,” Steve said when Bucky stopped talking. “Make sure the men are ready.”
They didn’t know a fucking thing. Steve was crazy about Tony, had been since the first time he’d seen him – strong, fearless and independent and refusing to comply when the world tried to force him to be something he wasn’t. Tony using Steve? He’d barely been able to get Tony to
“You seem to operate under the impression that I’m your average omega,” Tony says, mockingly. “There’s a reason I’m always at my king’s side in battle, Lord Stane, and it’s not just because I’m there to keep him warm on cold nights.”
“Yeah, back off, Buck, let me take this asshole down,” Steve snarled. He was vibrating with the need to put this asshole in his place; you didn’t hit omegas – you didn’t hit anyone smaller and weaker than you, period.
Time passed slowly, each second creeping closer to what Steve thought was morning, and a new round of torture. He didn’t really consider his own wounds, which should’ve hurt more than they did. He also didn’t really think about the lack of infection, or how he felt stronger than he should have considering that the scraps of food they were given wasn’t nearly enough to sustain him normally.
“All the time,” Steve lied shamelessly. And damn him for that. Tony couldn’t call him out on his bullshit here, of all places. Being, y’know, royalty - Steve could get kidnapped - or worse - if anyone found out the crown-prince was strolling around the shadier parts of their city unprotected without any guards, for Gods’ sake!
“You must be Omega Stark,” he rumbled. “Friend Steve has told me a lot about you.” He stepped back and bowed deeply and Tony could just stand there and gape like a fool while still holding his nose.
“What the fuck have you done with him?” Steve growled at the guards. They paused and one turned to him with a smirk.
“I have no doubt that the omega Stone has snuck in is the most… persuasive of the bunch”, Steve comments. He wipes his face clean of shaving cream and then pulls on a royal blue and white tunic, lastly fastening a wide leather belt around his trim waist.
Tony would never forgive Johann Schmidt for trying to start another upheaval so near Tony’s due date.
“Oh, stuff it,” Rhia snapped. “What does it matter if Peter wants to have some fun? So what if he’s a prince? It’s not like he’s hurting anyone and besides, we’re still kids, Patrick.”
“I can’t go back home!” Bruce gritted out, anger and heartbreak clear in his anguished voice. “I can’t Tony, I can’t take it anymore.”
“While Bruce is my brother from another mother and he’s awesome, I think I’ve found my platonic life-partner. He knows calculus, Steve. Calculus!”
He delicately traced over the middle of Steve’s back; the long, ugly scar there barely discernible through the silk tunic. Steve’s mind had been more occupied with Tony and the baby than the battle, that time, and he’d taken a sword to the back. He’d nearly died from blood-loss and the nasty infection following. Tony’s breath clogged in his throat. He never wanted to experience that kind of torturous worry ever again; to not know whether his mate would survive or not.
He would not kick up a fuss the day Steve found someone else. He would let Steve go and remain his confidant and friend, if not his lover and mate. He’d sworn. But fuck, he’d never thought it would hurt this much.
“My beautiful Tony, what have they done to you?” Steve whispered, dismayed. He hurried to get a cloth from the pile beside the sink, wetting it before coming back to kneel before Tony.
“Alright,” he relented when Tony turned big, pleading eyes on him. “I’ll see you back at our rooms in an hour.”
shook him out of the half-slumber he’d fallen into. Bucky sat upright with a curse, holding his amputated shoulder when he jostled it in his hurry. Steve got to his feet and tried to peer out of the small, barred window in the door, but he could only see flickering shadows behind it.
Tony stared again. He’d done that a lot in the span of half an hour. “You’re the crown-prince,” he intoned. Steve looked far too amused for his liking.
Tony froze in his tracks. He slowly turned to look at Steve, standing right behind him and the alpha whose arm Tony was holding onto.
“Don’t feel bad,” Tony tried to comfort him. “I doubt anyone could beat Thor. He’s too…” he trailed off with a dazed look in his eyes that Steve didn’t like at all.
In reply, the door crashed in, flying clear off its hinges and noisily rebounding down the short steps to land with a bang on the floor. Dust billowed up, making it harder to see as a shadow appeared at the top of the stairs. Something blue glowed in the middle of it.
“Tony.” Steve sighs with a shake of his head, muttering something under his breath Tony can’t make out. He stares down at his feet and reaches up to rub the back of his head, mussing the braids. A few pearls come loose and fall to the floor with quiet pings.
Tony refused to answer, stubbornly keeping his eyes on that spot. Was that mold? They should take care of that before it became a problem. Before they knew it, the whole castle could become a cesspool of filth and dirt and-
Rolling his eyes, Tony had to kiss Steve, pouring all of the love he felt for this incredible man into it.
“Tony could fall in love with Thor,” Sam pointed out, unhelpfully. “He’s got that dreamy prince charming thing going. Omegas love stuff like that.”
He’d never get that back and he’d hate Johann Schmidt for taking it from him until the day he died. Eventually the tears stopped flowing and even though his nose was running and he most likely looked like something that had crawled out from under a rock, Steve’s hands fell away to dangle between his legs.
Tony arched against him as best as he could with his big stomach in the way. “Bucky is mated,” he got out around a bitten off moan, as one of Steve’s hands slowly slipped underneath his rough work tunic, stroking his rounded belly lovingly before making its way under the waistband of his pants.
“How in the hell do you know about this but I don’t?” Steve giggled-wheezed, tears forming at the corners of his eyes.
Tony’s mouth went dry at the sight of him and his stomach clenched when the sweet scent rolling off the prince reached his nose. Wow, that was a potent cocktail of pheromones. It was all Tony could do to suppress his own from leaking all over the place and stink it up with how much want he currently felt for the handsome prince.
Steve was jolted out of his troubled thoughts when the door atop the stairs banged open and the guards appeared, dragging something between them. No, not something – someone.
Tony’s frozen, completely gobsmacked. “You want me?” He nearly laughs. Of all the asinine plots, this must be the most ridiculous. Stone must sense his incredulity; his face darkens and his fingers wrap around his wrist, squeezing too tight. Tony winces. That’s going to leave a bruise.
Despite their eagerness to get married as soon as possible, the death of Steve’s father put a damper on their happiness and forced them to wait the allotted four months of mourning before Steve could formally propose to Tony.
“I didn’t mean lube,” Steve said when he tore himself from Tony. “I meant; do you have something you use to help get through your Heat?”
“You also look…” Tony was just as tongue tied, his mouth turned dry and sweat broke out between his shoulder blades.
“I was jealous okay?” Tony bursts out, whirling around to glare at him. “I was fucking jealous of him because he’s young and gorgeous and not fucking me!”
The smile curving Thor’s full mouth was gloomy. “Because Loki loves to dance but has few opportunities to do so and would never ask anyone to join him. Asgard is not a land of song and dance, unless ballads of war and drunken brawling counts.”
Steve’s smile oozed mischievousness. “Oh you have no idea, Tony. Revenge is gonna be so sweet,” he said with relish, making Tony groan theatrically.
Clenching his jaw, Steve remembered seeing Clint take a blow to his head early into the fight. He straightened his shoulders and nodded decisively. “Right, let’s go then. Stay behind me.”
“Tony…” Steve picked up the plate, moved it out of the way and then drew Tony into his arms, enveloping him in a warm embrace. “I could never leave you; it took everything in me to get out of bed this morning.” He pressed his lips against Tony’s forehead tenderly. “If it were up to me, I’d never leave your side again,” he whispered into Tony’s skin, like a secret.
“Now the couple will exchange claiming gifts,” Yinsen intoned, over the excited chatter in the hall.
“He’s the omega Steve’s trying to court,” Nat explained with an eye-roll. “Only he’s not really swayed by our mighty prince’s endeavors.”
“King Steven will never leave this room after tonight,” a young man said admiringly. “You’re so beautiful Consort Stark, it’ll take his breath away.”
“No,” Tony said around a groan of pain, tendrils of painful heat snaking out from the base of his spine and into the rest of his body. “I need you.”
“And you still went and flirted with another omega in front of me?” Tony wants to shove the words back down his throat. That was not something to focus in right then and there, but Tony’s brain to mouth filter was apparently malfunctioning.
“In your twisted fucking dreams, Rumlow!” Stark shouted back. He relaxed when the guards disappeared around a corner. He looked down at the arm Steve still held across his chest, eyebrows raised.
Tony moaned and his head fell back, exposing his throat to Steve’s roving mouth where it pressed soft kisses and sucked marks into the pale skin offered to him.
“Don’t you fucking why me!” Tony yells, fury breaking his hold on his emotions and exploding inside of him like a gale of wildfire. He whirls around. “How could you use me like that? Was this a fun little game for you? A game of: Let’s see how far I can push Tony to get me information?”
His omega was so beautiful like this – his face flushed, brow knitted in concentration and hair in a tangled mass down his back from where Steve had wound it around his fingers and pulled it throughout their lovemaking.
He released Steve’s hard length with a last, lingering suck and crawled back up his panting, shivering form, straddling his trim waist and letting his hands caress the damp skin tenderly. Tony gave Steve a moment to catch his breath, waiting patiently until he could open his eyes properly.
“I’m still amazed of how much of a petty, little shit you can be when you put your mind to it,” Tony marveled with a deep laugh, face flushed from amusement and arousal.
“Damn,” one of the alphas breathed. “Look how wet he is, he’s just asking for an old-fashioned knotting.”
“Pride is useless in a fight,” Thor laughed and reached out a hand to help Steve up. “Only bravery, quick feet and wits may help you when you meet a foe you have yet to best.”
“It was on that mission where they went missing for like, three weeks, was it? Apparently they ran into a Hydra group and you know how Hydra is - all rah-rah
An embarrassed flush slowly replaced the rosy glow of arousal on Steve’s neck and face and it was typical Steve to get bashful about voicing his fantasies while still balls deep in Tony’s ass.
Even if Steve had meant for Tony to be the one in charge, it seemed like he couldn’t help himself as he took over, setting the pace and doing all the work. Tony was too busy making pleasured sounds, rocking with Steve’s motions and just hanging on to be too irritated. At least at first.
He ravished Tony’s mouth, nipping and sucking his lips until they were plump and swollen and throbbing in time with his galloping heart. Tony had been kissed a few times in his life, but never like this. This hunger was new, taking over all of his senses, the air permeated with Steve’s scent, Steve’s heat and it was so overwhelming, it coalesced into a jumbled mantra of
“About a week.” Tony smiled through his own tears and pressed a kiss to the crown of Steve’s blond locks. He gently carded the tangled strands between long fingers, making Steve shudder when Tony’s blunt nails scratched his scalp.
“Oh yeah, I never said, did I?” Tony told him with a grin. “Two babies at the same time, a boy and a girl.”
“How so, Omega Stark?” Thor inquired. Luckily it was a slower part of the dance; they could talk without having to shout.
Tony revelled in the feel of Steve’s body under his clever fingers, as the tables were turned and he helped Steve pull his tunic and pants off; tickling caresses exploring the expanse of muscles bared to his hungry mouth. He marked Steve’s pale skin with damp kisses and sharp nicks, taking pleasure in the way Steve squirmed and moaned under him, loving the way this big, strong, alpha let Tony, an omega, take charge and lead them towards the endgame of mutual satisfaction.
“I see,” Steve said calmly, almost coldly. He rarely got stern with their children, but he felt it prudent at the moment. “Then I guess I just have to speak to your papa and hear his opinion on this matter.”
Steve barely had the time to bask in the afterglow before the day descended into, in his opinion, chaos. An army of servants, led by the formidable Virginia – Pepper – Potts marched into their bedchamber, her stern gaze raking over their naked, mussed forms blinking at them from the middle of the bed.
“…. Not really,” Tony answered at length, confused. “Sounds to me like you’re the one thinking that?”
“Thank you,” Tony mumbled. “I’ve never gotten a gift before, and of course you have to put the bar too high from the start. No one’s ever gonna be able to top this.”
The battle was raging all around him. Smoke from the fire trenches billowed over the wide fields, shrouding them in opaque clouds that made it hard to see anything beyond a few feet in front of him. Clangs from swords impacting shields and armors and the screams from wounded and dying men coalesced into a roaring sound that drowned out anything else.
“Nice landing, loser,” Bucky mocked as Steve sat down on an empty crate with a sigh of relief. “I told you he’d go for your ankles; you need to be faster next time.”
The crass words make Tony feel sick. Stone’s oily voice and his hand on Tony’s leg worsening the nightmare he’s currently in. He can’t breathe. Tony needs air right now or he’s going to pass out. Without taking his eyes off Steve, Tony murmurs, “Excuse me, Lord Stone, I need to step away for a moment. Please, enjoy your night.” How the words come out steady and smooth Tony doesn’t know. He gets up and thinks he hears Stone mumble, “Oh, I already am” and quickly moves to the door behind the head table.
“You’re so beautiful,” he whispered reverently. “I could look at you all day, every day for the rest of my life and never grow tired of the sight of you.”
“What?” Tony’s completely taken off guard. He quickly gets up; he feels too vulnerable sitting down when Stone is looking at him like that.
The Heat was climbing to unbearable levels, rendering Tony speechless as it tore through him like a volcano erupting in the pit of his stomach. He ached all over, the scent of slick soaking the very air they breathed. Steve growled, low and pleased, and with the toy slowly sliding into him, Steve helped Tony to completion. Over and over and over for the next, three days
?” Tony asked incredulously, making Thor laugh ruefully. What kind of moron didn’t want to marry a kind, handsome prince?
Mood ruined, Steve sat back between Tony’s spread legs and raked a hand through his hair, as always taking no notice of how he messed up his braids.
It wasn’t that Steve distrusted his people or anything like that, and everything to do with a sudden urge to bend Tony over the nearest, vertical surface while showering him with praise.
“Now you’re being deliberately obtuse, Tony. I’ve never resented the way you like to lead in bed. I like it,” Steve snapped, blue eyes flashing warningly.
“What the fuck for?” Tony groused to himself. What could the prince, the heir to the throne, ever want with him? Tony was a nobody – a poor omega turned blacksmith born to poor parents in Lower East Side, one of the poorer parts of Manhattan. Their paths had crossed the other day, when the price stepped in to keep Tony from death by enraged alpha, but that could hardly have left a lasting impression.
“Uh…” Tony didn’t really know what to say to that. He let Steve help him sit up against the headboard and looked on, speechless, as Steve draped the cloth over his lap and put the plate on top of it.
And that was just like his Steve: polite and kind to a fault. Tony hadn't seen that through the haze of his jealousy.
Patrick immediately turned around and knelt before Peter, putting a comforting hand on his little brother’s shoulder. “It’s all right, buddy,” he tried to soothe him. “No one’s angry at you.”
Steve growled, frustrated, and before Tony knew what was happening, he rolled them over, sprawling Tony on his back with Steve lying between his legs, Steve’s hand anchored at the small of Tony’s back to keep their pelvises pressed together.
Tony punches him. The satisfaction is greater than he previously thought, back in the banquet hall. He knows Stone’s type; the typical alpha who looks down on omegas, who sees Tony and everything he is as a curiosity, a peculiar little pet to fool around with and discard without a second thought.
“Aye. He has not, how do you say? Cottoned on to the fact, yet. And please, call me Thor. I like you, friend Tony, and I think Steve has made a wise choice when he decided to court you.”
Steve reached, grabbed Tony’s nape and pulled him down into a messy, spit-slick kiss at the same time as he positioned his cock at Tony’s entrance with his other hand. Tony moaned at the feeling of Steve’s cock prodding his slick hole, whining loudly when Steve’s hips shifted and rose, his hard, thick length slowly pressing into Tony’s body.
Stone refuses to answer but his baleful glance says it all. Tony releases Stone in disgust. The alpha’s head falls down with a thump and he groans when his nose is jostled. Tony does not care one bit. He straightens and turns to the niche’s opening.
“I have forged this shield with my own two hands. It is made of vibranium, which was gifted to me by the kind king of Wakanda, in honor of our union.”
“Just here for the show.” He smiled and indicated to the door which Tony and his companion had been about to step through. The theater was run down and in dire need of renovations – had been for the last twenty years at least, and not really up to prince-like standards.
Steve’s eyes were as wide as his; they never broke eye contact during the time it took Steve to work his cock deep into Tony, a thick, reverent silence descending over them as Tony’s pelvis finally was flush with Steve’s.
“This is my gift to my omega and mate,” he recited, “may your days be blessed.” He took a deep breath. This was it.
Stone tries to break Tony’s hold on his hair with a snarl, but Tony just tightens his grip and presses the tip of his dagger against Stone’s neck. Stone stills instantly, wide eyes staring at Tony without blinking.
Tony misses the glance between his friends as he steps past them and wrenches the door open. It leads out into a wide corridor, where the din of the banquet hall is muffled and lit torches in scones casts dancing shadows on the cold, bare walls. Tony inhales deeply, a little of the tension in his back and shoulders finally loosens. He walks to a small niche a bit further down the corridor; where a small window with a bench strategically placed underneath makes the perfect hidey-hole for him.
“I can too marry him,” Steve replied hotly as he allowed Bucky to herd him in the direction of the castle.
“My point exactly,” Steve said drily. “Now, what’s this shouting about? You were loud enough to make the cows in the fields moo.”
“Hold on, Buck, we’ll get out of here,” Steve said around the lump in his throat. “I’ll get us out.”
Panting heavily, Tony’s words penetrated the pleasure-induced fog in his head and his arms jerked around Tony, jostling him and making him moan again when it made Steve’s knot press more firmly against his prostate.
Tony was left stunned with a hand outstretched after Steve when he ran out and thundered down the narrow stairs.
“Bucky!” Steve shot up from his pallet, hands grabbing the bars so hard his knuckles whitened. “What have you done to him? Bucky! Bucky, can you hear me?”
“I-I promise,” Tony stuttered, writhing underneath Steve when his hormones insisted on getting some action. Now!
Steve leaned to the side to retrieve the Heat-toy Tony had made himself and Tony used the respite to get out of the rest of his clothes. It was too warm in the room, it felt like his skin was on fire even as the cool air hit him. Steve’s eyes roved over him hungrily when he settled back, coming to kneel between Tony’s spread legs and greedily drinking in the sight of him.
“I know, and I’m with you on this one. That’s why I wanted to talk to them. If we tell them about when we met and about all the times you’ve stood by me in battles maybe it’ll make Patrick see...” he trailed off, his eyes pleading with Tony. “I don’t think Patrick’s beyond reason yet.”
It was the only time his mother had put her foot down too. She’d fought Howard on it and won, in the end, when the bastard died before she did – stabbed in a fight over another omega. She’d wasted away after that, unable to go on without her asshole of an alpha. Her love had killed her in the end and Tony had sworn to never put himself in that position.
“I think you do yourself a disservice, Omega Stark. It is clear for everyone who cares to look how enamored friend Steve is with you. He would move heaven and earth for you,” Thor said. He took Tony’s hand as they turned, moving back from each other and together again rhythmically.
“I won’t be at the fore, Steve,” Tony assured him gently. “I’ll keep myself in a safe spot and lead from there. Our men will understand.”
“You up for getting down this mountain now?” Tony asked, getting to his feet and reaching a hand out to help Steve up.
“I can protect myself,” Tony whispered into his chest. “I’ll be very careful and I’ll have Clint and Sam with me. They won’t let anything happen to me.”
“I’d like to see you do it instead, jerk,” Steve shot back but it lacked heat. He was too tired to care all that much. He gratefully accepted the wet rag Bucky held out, mopping sweat and blood off of his face and held it to his bleeding nose.
“That’s really interesting,” Bucky said dryly. “Please, tell me more while I’m freezing my ass off on the ground!”
Raising his head, Tony stared at the door opening where Steve stood, holding a covered plate and a glass of water, a cloth slung over a shoulder.
Their prime argument was the fact that Steve wasn’t crowned king yet and didn’t have the authority to start changing laws as he saw fit. Steve calmly pointed out that he was the king, crown or no crown, and he would do as he pleased with the damned laws if he felt like it. They fell silent after that.
Speaking of the kids, their voices echoed off of the walls; Patrick’s going from childish squeaky only to break in the middle and shift to a deeper baritone. Puberty is a bitch, Steve remembered with a rueful chuckle. His eldest son’s shouts were drowned out by Rhia shrieking loud enough to crack glass. Steve and Clint both winced and Steve only hesitated for a moment before he eased open the door.
Laughing too, Steve cups his face, his hands so capable of violence and destruction gentle and careful. “When I look at Hani, he reminds me of you that day. He’s making the most of what he’s been dealt, and just like you, his spirit hasn’t been broken. I pity him because he doesn’t have someone who can be by his side and hold him up when he tries to make something of himself, not yet anyway, if ever. I was gentle with him because I have a feeling he’s been met with more lust than kindness in his life. I didn’t give in to his advances when he pressed, I was only talking to him like he’s a normal person. Because he is. That’s why I told Sam to put him up for the night, so I can talk to him tomorrow and let him choose for himself what he wants to do. I don’t want anyone to take that away from him, just like I think it’s every omega’s right to have the final say over their life.”
“And if I do…” Tony slinks closer, letting one hand ghost up Stone’s chest while the other reaches behind him, towards the waistband at the small of his back. The handle of the small dagger he keeps there is warm against his fingers and it fits in his hand with easy familiarity as he palms it. “Will you tell me who is behind all of this? I’d want to know who I’m going to pledge my loyalty to, after I’d betrayed my king.”
Coming out into the bright shop, with its wide windows and rows of immaculate shelves, Tony stepped behind the short counter where the prince himself waited on the other side.
“Please, call me Tony”, Tony said. It didn’t feel right to be so formal with someone who’d bared their heart to him.
He’d seen Tony’s ingenuity when it came to weapons, from his shop, and from watching him work in the forge – red, glowing iron taking shape beneath each hammer-strike and slowly transforming into wonders only Tony could see, before Steve’s awed gaze. Tony had however revealed his true colors when visiting the castle’s war factory.
He gently curled his fingers over Tony’s, closing them around the scroll. “In your hand lies a decree. It reads, that from this day forward, all omegas in our kingdom are of equal standing with alphas and betas. Their families no longer have the power to force them into a claim they don’t want, nor is it legal for any bank, university or employer to refuse an omega business funding, enrollment or employment based on their secondary gender.”
“I came as soon as I heard,” Tony whispered. “Are you alright?” The metal fingers stroking his cheeks were cold but so welcome, it was all Steve could do not to burst out in tears.
“Peter, stop!” she yelled in Peter’s face, startling him out of his crying jag. “You’re not really upset, stop messing with Patrick.”
“There’s a good kitty,” a beer-stinking voice breathed in his ear. “Why don’t you invite us in? We’ll show you a good time.”
“Uh, hey-hi-hello,” the prince stammered with a blush slowly creeping up his neck. It was fucking adorable. Tony loved it.
The world they lived in wasn’t perfect nor beautiful all the time; it could be cruel and tried repeatedly to put them down, to force them to submit to their biology as much as to what men before them had decided should be their fate. But they would keep on fighting; for each other and every other man and woman who wanted to be who they were meant to be. They would never stop going forward.
Tony averts his gaze, unable to voice his doubts to Steve. “Just thinking about what Lord Stone would hope to accomplish by bringing you a new omega, that’s all,” he hedges.
“You’re about to let a prince claim you,” Steve pointed out. “You can and you will accept it. It’s your right as my betrothed.”
Tony at least had the good sense to wait until Bucky had closed the thick, oak, door before he unleashed his fury on his alpha.
“Ah, I apologize for that.” Thor grimaced and gently patted Steve on his back. “The heat of the fight got the better of me and I didn’t hold back my blow.”
On and on they walked, winding their way through a maze of corridors, side passages, empty rooms and so many stairs. The eerie feeling of emptiness resonating throughout the place gave Steve the creeps. Things got a little sticky when a small group of men ran out of a side corridor, right into their midst. They concentrated on Tony, deeming him the bigger threat in his armor and Steve was more than happy to take advantage of the opportunity.
Steve exploded at the same time, cock throbbing in time with his galloping heart as he emptied himself inside of Tony. His knot pulsed and grew, slowly sealing them together for the next, twenty minutes.
Tony smiled so hard it threatened to split his face in two, Steve’s arm warm and strong around his shoulders as they observed their children lovingly. It’d been an interesting afternoon and evening; Peter had wanted to know more, Rhia had asked far too probing questions and Patrick had sulked through the first hour or so.
They stood facing each other, their profiles to the crowd. Steve held Tony’s left hand in his as Yinsen weaved the Bonding cord around their joined hands three times, chanting and asking the Gods for their blessing, reciting the words that would bind Tony to Steve and vice versa.
“In what world do I – a poor commoner – get invited to a feast at the castle and get to dance with a foreign prince?” Tony had to laugh and shook his head. “Unreal. I can’t imagine what Steve was thinking. I don’t belong here.”
“Sounds like they’re at it again,” he said with a wide grin at Clint, amusement dancing in his eyes.
Watching Tony – Tony, Steve thought, the name rolling around and filling him with a warmth he’d never felt before – unconcerned of his own injury and handling his fellow omega so softly, calming him and helping him up on shaking legs, Steve felt something he’d never experienced before. He’d heard tales about love at first sight but never thought they held much merit. Right then and there, Steve Rogers, crown-prince and future commander of armies, fell irrevocably in love.
Tony went as deep as he could, whimpering when his lips met resistance at the base of Steve’s cock, where his knot had started to swell, too wide to fit in Tony’s mouth.
“I hope you wake up with spiders in your bed!” Tony called back when Steve strode off with him, ignoring Clint’s rude gesture as he snuggled deeper into Steve’s hold smugly.
“What’s the matter?” Tony repeats. He’s still so fucking angry, he can barely see straight. In all of their years together, Steve has never treated him so cruelly. He’s never blatantly flirted with another in front of Tony and let another alpha almost molest him to get information. Steve has rather been a little too protective of Tony; never letting another alpha get so close and personal with him.
Clint seemed to be getting cold feet, damn him. Tony didn’t have time for this. “I don’t know, Tony. It’s only been two weeks since the cesarean. Maybe you should rest a few more days.”
The bully hadn’t known Steve was the crown-prince when he’d decked him but a guard witnessed the whole thing and intervened before the fight went further than the one blow. Bucky, completely disregarding Steve’s royalty-status and his own humble background, had declared them best friends and that was that.
“Be safe,” Steve managed to choke out, his eyes starting to mist as Tony left the tent on quiet feet.
Ignoring Tony’s indignant protest, he hoists him up until Tony can wrap his legs around Steve’s waist and carries himt to their bed.
“I’m going to tell you what I see when I look at you.” He starts to trace the wrinkles around Tony’s eyes. “I see someone who has had reason to smile and laugh a lot. These are the proof of that.” His fingers dip down to brush over the bonding-mark. “I see someone who is loved and cared for and safe.”
“Tell me about it,” Sam muttered sullenly. “I still have bruises after the last time you forced me to spar with you.”
Tony didn't recognize the person staring back at him, it was so vastly different from how he usually looked.
Tony stormed into Steve’s study, so angry he could hardly speak. Steve didn’t even acknowledge his arrival, the bastard, and kept his attention on Bucky while he relayed the latest intel on Schmidt’s movements with a passive face.
“He never told you?” Tony had thought Steve was joking. Holy shit, Bucky was in for a world of trouble.
The crowd erupted into a cacophony of protests, threats and exclamations of injustice. Steve didn’t hear them, he could only watch as tears fell from Tony’s eyes, smudging his makeup but so much more beautiful because of it. He waited until the din died down before speaking up again. “And lastly…” He half-turned with his arm outstretched, accepting the thin, square box Bucky held out to him. “It states that a person, whether of noble, royal or common origins will be declared Consort and rule by the king’s or queen’s side as an equal upon a union of marriage.”
“He better not fucking be,” Tony muttered, stalking angrily beside Steve. Or well, he waddled more like. Steve thought it was adorable. “I’ll put Harley on his ass; that’ll teach him to sprout bullshit about things he doesn’t understand.”
“Yeah, and I’m an omega and your fucking mate! That has nothing to do with this. Alpha, omega or beta – we all want to fight to protect what we love. I don’t give a shit what customs say about it. I have every right to be here by your side!”
Tony would never tell a soul how his heart shattered into a million, tiny pieces in that moment. It was by his own doing, but he’d rather have that than get to have Steve only to lose him again when Steve saw how little worth his time Tony was.
“Fuck you. I just want to go home and my king beating himself up over things he can’t control won’t get me there faster.”
“What the fuck are you doing? Stop!” an enraged, familiar voice shouted from behind them, stopping the alphas in their tracks.
Fat lot of good that had done him. His Heat had taken him completely off guard and before he even knew it, he’d lost his chance to pour his heart in Steve’s hands, hoping he’d handle it with care. Shuddering, Tony thanked the Gods for Steve’s timely appearance. He couldn’t bear to think about what would’ve happened if he hadn’t shown up.
– right. The alpha didn’t even seem remorseful. He smiled; he smiled and it looked like he expected Steve to understand, to
They pulled apart with a wet sound, panting slightly. “Right,” Tony nodded. “Rescue first, kisses later.”
They trudged down the passage behind Tony; the pace was slower than he’d like, due to Bucky’s injuries and inability to walk by himself at the moment. However, Steve couldn’t help when his eyes slid over Tony’s form, over and over. It was just so… hard to grasp that his mate had come for him and kicked Hydra’s ass while he was at it.
“Bucky can suck my dick,” Steve told Tony pleasantly, crawling up on the bed and forcing Tony on his back, coming to loom over him with his hands resting on either side of Tony’s head with a hungry glint in his eyes. “The day he finds himself a mate of his own I’m going to laugh until I burst and give him so much shit, you’ll be amazed.”
Letting Stone lean in even further and get a real good sniff of his scent, Tony loosens the hold he usually keeps on his pheromones. Stone looks drunk; his irises almost completely overtaken by his pupils. Good. Tony knows what an omega’s pheromones do to an alpha, and he thanks the gods that he’s old enough to keep them suppressed most of the time, and the ability to use them to his advantage when he needs it. The lord swallows heavily and it looks like he’s trying to rain back on his arousal. Tony almost snorts. Like he could.
“Well…” Stone reaches out and traces a finger down Tony’s shoulder, greedily following its trail with his cold, blue eyes. “While I do understand the temptation of a young, untouched omega in my bed, I’ve always preferred more… mature partners.”
“What the hell, man?” he exclaimed as he rubbed his nose. Steve had recently shot up in height; Bucky wasn’t used to his nose being level with Steve’s neck.
Tony pointed at a bundle on the floor. “You’re way too underdressed, sweetheart, and as much as I appreciate the view, you need to get some clothes on you.”
“You are amazing,” he retorted breathlessly, wriggling when Steve’s dick slid against his balls, slick from his own, persistent arousal.
“You’re a lot better at it than Clint,” Steve had to admit, making Tony smile wider and lean in for a kiss.
“So do you,” Tony said shyly. This was ridiculous. They’d seen each other naked plenty of times before this; Steve had helped him through four of his Heats! They had no business behaving like blushing virgins just because Steve was about to knot him for the first time.
“And you shouldn’t,” Stark – Tony? – soothed. “You can come with me. I’ve a spare room in the back of the forge, you can stay there with me. If Rumlow shows up I’ll throw my hammer at him, how’s that?”
They left Steve seething and throwing himself against the bars; a kind of rage he’d never felt before staining his vision red. He stormed and screamed at the top of his lungs, putting every ounce of fear and anger into it.
Their relationship has always been and remains an unorthodox one. Steve has never treated Tony like the world treats omegas: as brainless ornaments, devoted to childbirth and silly pleasures only, never to be troubled with worries bigger than what clothes to wear and how much jewelry they have. No, Steve has always addressed Tony as his equal, and made Tony his consort as well as his mate the day he claimed him.
He left his befuddled children in his wake to find Tony and tell him to cancel all of their meetings for the rest of the day. Steve found him in the chamber off the throne room, up to his elbows in documents and blueprints with Pepper hovering beside him, a harried expression on her face.
Sneaky husband, Tony thought affectionately with a slight grin. Maybe he ought to reward his clever husband in a sexy way tonight.
Pepper gave Steve a grateful smile. “Thank you, your Majesty.” She then looked down at Tony. “Will that be all, Consort Stark?”
“Doesn’t look like it when he seems to enjoy your omega’s company over mine,” Tony muttered petulantly. He knew he was unfair but he couldn’t help it. It was the first time he’d ever felt jealous, wasn’t he allowed even a smidge of pettiness?
Screams echoed throughout the underground complex – men and women shouting in pain as they were tortured or subjected to sick, twisted experiments. It was the lullaby he’d been forced to fall asleep to for far too long. He wanted to go home; to Tony’s waiting arms and Patrick’s sticky kisses.
Harley was a general in the making and after Steve had started to take an interest in his lessons, Tony wouldn’t be surprised if Harley made it in ten years. Tony also had a suspicion Steve was grooming Harley to take over Bucky’s position as head of the royal guards a few years down the line and then take charge of Patrick’s detail once Steve was no longer king.
“Eat up,” he encouraged with a smile. “You didn’t have any food so I went out and got some bread, cheese and ham.”
Suspicion started to creep into the back of Tony’s mind, but he played along and nodded in response to Steve’s apparent disbelief. “Yeah, he and Sam mated two years ago, almost three if I’m not mistaken.”
“You ready?” Steve asked, hands gripping his buttocks firmly, spreading them wide and making Tony’s eyes roll into the back of his head as cool air whiffed against his puffy entrance.
“A well-paying asshole,” Tony pointed out. “I needed the money he was willing to fork up to buy my company for a night. And I can take care of myself.”
His eyes surely weren’t that dark and seductive, were they? That couldn't be his lips - full and red and looking ready to be ravished by hungry kisses. And that body didn’t belong to him; all long lines and toned muscles glistening in the dim light from the fireplace and what had to be at least hundreds of candles. The loincloth he’d thought transparent teased the viewer with peeks of his long legs and slim hips, while obscuring his most private areas in shadow, and the oil coupled with the gold and maroon silk falling from his waist literally set  his skin aglow.
– because I’m pregnant!” Tony keened and spilled between them, his hot cum painting Steve’s quivering abs with sticky, white streaks.
Johann Schmidt had been a thorn in Steve’s side ever since he was a teenager; his father had cast him out of the castle when he’d discovered just what his leading alchemist was spending the King’s money on: sick experiments on humans that would turn an omega into an alpha – all to give him the power to change the very laws of nature. He fancied himself something of a God, and his equally twisted sycophants worshipped the ground he walked on. They called themselves Hydra and Steve hated the whole lot of them with his whole being.
The thin chain of gold across his forehead and the bracelets around his biceps shine in the torchlight. In between the folds of his blood-red silk waistcloth, another set of gilded links wink from around his ankles. Steve, with a leer and an aroused glint in his eyes, had even exchanged Tony’s usual, plain navel piercing to the big, crimson ruby he’d gifted him on their fifteenth anniversary of their mating. It sparkles where it rests in the shallow divot on Tony’s flat stomach. Stifling a sigh, Tony’s resigned to showcase his riches and stretch marks both.
Steve spins him around to face him. “Tony... how could I look at you and think anything but how achingly beautiful you are? You take my breath away, every and each day.”
Walking through the castle to where Clint was waiting for him was one of the hardest things Tony had ever done. The only thing forcing his feet forward was the thought of their unborn child resting under his heart and a burning, desperate hope that Steve would come back alive. He’d promised, after all, and Steve never broke his promises.
Tony shifted from foot to foot, impatiently waiting for Bucky to finish so he could rip Steve a new one.
He rubbed filthy hands over his unshaven face, the beard coarse and stiff against his fingers. God, what he would give for five minutes with a bucket of clean water, though he was so filthy he doubted it would be enough.
“Alright. I’ll come back another day.” Steve said with a nod, turned on his heel and stalked out of the store. Tony stared after him, mystified, with his mouth hanging open.
He takes a step to the side and lets Natasha and Bucky pass him when they come up from behind. “Take Lord Stone to see our physician and then escort him and his following to the border. I don’t want them to get lost on their way home.”
The door slid shut, closing them inside Tony’s warm, silent and safe kitchen. Steve slowly lowered Tony into a chair and lit the candle standing in the middle of the table, getting a good look at Tony’s face. He gave a growl so low it was bordering on subvocal; Tony could feel it vibrate through his bones more than he heard it.
Their voices grew louder and louder as they approached and Steve suspected that Hani must’ve washed his hands of them already.
“I kind of did,” Tony admitted sheepishly. “That fact kind of fell away the more I got to know you.”
It’d been humiliating, for sure, to have so many eyes on him at his weakest, with his men in equal state behind him. Steve had held firm though, had refused to let them cow him and make him lose hope. His people would come. He just hoped it would be soon – he didn’t know how much longer his men could take it.
“How long have you known?” Steve choked out through gritted teeth with tears sliding down his cheeks. He didn’t care. He was so happy he could burst with it.
If it hadn’t been for the pressing need to talk with their children, Patrick in particular, Steve would’ve scoped Tony up in his arms and carried him to their bed and taken a few hours to pleasure his beloved omega to his heart’s content.
Tony clutched Steve’s jacket tighter around him when the touch caused a new surge of Heat to sweep through him. Steve paused in his ministrations and Tony could see his nostrils flaring and his throat bobbed when he swallowed. They froze like that, staring into each other’s eyes. Tony’s ass clenched and his heart throbbed in his chest when he saw Steve’s pupils widening, the blue reduced to a thin ring around them.
Steve’s brows furrowed, pensively. “I… think I’ll need you to explain it further to me. Just to make it clearer,” he added hurriedly at the disbelieving look Tony shot him.
Steve has the good grace to look embarrassed, a blush slowly creeping up his neck. “Yeah well, that was different.”
“You thought I left you?” Steve guessed and the tenderness in his voice and on his face was too much for Tony. He closed his eyes and nodded, defeated.
“I’ll make sure he’s not overdoing it, Pepper,” Steve promised. “I’ll help him, even if I don’t understand a thing about what he’s doing.”
Damn, even his voice is lovely – smooth and melodious. Tony can hear sharp intakes of air from several people in the vast hall; he even thinks he hears Bucky swear from somewhere behind them, where he’s keeping watch together with Clint, Nat and Sam. Tony doesn't have enough courage to even glance at Steve, too afraid of what he could see on his mate’s face. Instead he keeps his eyes trained on Hani, when the young omega sets his gaze on Steve. His eyes widen and a hungry expression flashes over his face before he schools his features into demure graciousness.
“Oh man, you got it so bad,” Sam said and slapped Steve on his back, ignoring the pained sound Steve let out.
“Will do,” Bucky nodded, glancing sideways at Tony. He took in the thunderous expression on Tony’s face and smirked at Steve. “Good luck, pal. Seems like you’ll need it.”
Tony was flung to the ground, grunting in pain when his knees connected with the unforgiving cobble. His face was pressed into the cold stone as hands pawed at his pants, pulling them down and exposing his Heat-slicked buttocks.
“And do you both promise to support each other, through bad times and good times, through sickness and health, for as long as you both shall live?”
“It doesn’t, but thanks for the effort,” Steve said mournfully. “I can’t believe they didn’t tell me.”
“But,” Steve interrupted, “if you’d like to come and live with me in the castle, I would be overjoyed.”
“You okay?” Steve sounded like he’d gargled gravel, his voice was so strained and hoarse, seemingly dazed and worried at the same time.
Steve’s hands tighten around Tony’s jaw. “I’m not interested in anyone but you, Tony. I haven’t been since the first time I saw you.” He shakes Tony, gently. “You and no one else.”
He opened the box and showed Tony the thin crown resting within; delicately crafted with concentric rings supported by spindly struts and a triangle-shaped sapphire in the middle of the circles. Tony gasped with a fresh wave of tears spilling down his cheeks.
Never in a million years would he let what others said dictate his choices, be they words of Gods or men.
The day of the coronation and their claiming began pleasantly with Steve waking up with Tony’s lips around his cock, leaving him a wrung out, panting mess before he was done with him.
Tony rose higher on his knees, letting Steve get more room to slowly run his fingers down the valley between Tony’s cheeks, giving a hungry growl at the wetness there, as he stroked Tony’s  twitching hole and coated his fingers in slick.
Fact: He’s still useful to Steve as his consort and head inventor; he’s still able to come up with new armor and weapons to help defend their kingdom.
The omega didn’t like to hear that. He growled and got angrier when Tony ignored him. “Who invited you anyway? I can’t think of any self-respecting alpha wanting to get caught dead in your company!”
Tony froze as hope surged through him. Steve! Steve was here! More tears streamed down his face, this time out of relief and gratitude.
“They lost contact with Steve’s company three days ago,” Clint told Tony, his body tense and face set in hard lines. “They’ve scoured the battlefield but didn’t find him or his men. It’s like they’ve disappeared into thin air.”
“It’s my turn now,” Tony informed, breathlessly, prying Steve’s hands from their purchase on him, slinging his palms against Steve’s and interlocking their fingers tightly. “You just lay there and look pretty. It’s your first time too, after all.”
Time seemed to slow down, seconds stretching out into eons, reaching for a forever out of reach horizon, where the end of the night was on the other side. Steve undid Tony’s loincloth with worshipful hands, lips and tongue following every dip and curve and straining muscle he could reach from lying underneath, like it was the first time, making Tony moan and swear and beg in a never-ending plea for more pleasure, more pressure – just
The omega who’d called out scowled after Bruce then at Tony, stung. “Yeah well, where’s your alpha? He should smack you for your rudeness.”
Steve’s face softened and he leaned in to hold Tony close, love shining in his beautiful, blue eyes. “But you still love this alpha, no matter how hopeless I am?”
“Do you even have to ask?” Clint smirked back, taking a step forward. After clearing his throat, he then bellowed, “LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE!” at the top of his lungs. They both burst out laughing as the children froze. Patrick and Rhia stared at Clint while Peter finally busted out the tears, wailing loud enough to drown out his siblings’ previous fight.
“I say, why not? It could surely not hurt to try.” Casting a quick glance behind him, towards the small lookout hole cut into the thick slats, a hungry grin split Thor’s face. “I see it is my turn again. We will discuss this further after I’ve won, my friends.” With long strides Thor vanished out into the arena again, his appearance heralded by the crowd chanting his name over and over.
For so long it had seemed like the hill he had chosen to die on; no matter how many times Tony had proved him wrong it hadn’t really sunk into Steve’s stubborn head, until Tony had forged his armor and imbued it with magic - thanks to an alchemist named Stephen Strange and a blue gem, and saved his and Bucky’s asses from Hydra.
Steve didn’t hear him. “But- you’re pregnant? Where’s Patrick?” A cold, panicked fist squeezed his heart. What had happened to the kids?
Their friends teased them mercilessly, but Clint bit off more than he could chew, when he’d tried to start a prank war and walked in on them in the middle of a passionate embrace. Serves him right, Steve thought smugly. He should’ve learned to knock before barging in.
Steve spat on the dirty floor, muck coating every surface but the ceiling. His father had done the right thing putting a stop to Schmidt’s experimentations, although Steve would’ve been happier if his father could’ve killed him instead of sending the mad man into exile.
his first time and it didn’t seem to matter how much he had tried to tell himself it was nothing to worry about.
“I didn’t get an opportunity. We’ve been in meetings all day and then there was this.” Steve motions to them and their room, but he smiles lovingly as he holds out a hand for Tony to take. “Although I’m generally not fond of all the pomp and splendor, I can't help but feel grateful for this time with you, when it’s just the two of us. Between negotiations and lords and whatnot, we’ve spent far too little time with each other lately.” Steve pulls Tony in for a long, deep kiss that ignites embers of arousal in the pit of his stomach.
“I know I’m pregnant, Pep, not like I can miss it – it was a whole thing, Steve was there, penetration was involved, after that it’s a bit blurry to be honest - what’s that got to do with anything?”
“Well, we’re sure as hell thinking it now!” Fury exclaimed. “Where’s Coulson? Coulson, get over here!”
Bruce had been gone for the day, with Natasha - who he’d befriended back at the feast - no doubt, and Jarvis was out of town for the last two weeks. Tony had no one he could ask for help and even though he knew better than to move around when he was putting out Heat pheromones like they were going out of style, he’d had no choice.
“It didn’t cost me that much,” Steve shrugged with an alarming disregard for valuables and their worth. “Nothing at all, in fact. Well, except for a screaming match with my father.”
Neither of them noticed when Natasha left the tent, flap softly falling shut behind her. Steve’s whole being was screaming at him to throw Tony over his shoulder and personally escort him back to the castle, Tony’s protest notwithstanding.
Sure, Tony had flirted a little – too little to count really – and now the prince wanted… what? To flirt more? Buy a sword? Didn’t he fight primarily with a shield? Tony couldn’t really remember, the last tournament where the prince had participated was a little blurry, to be honest. Tony had been there with some alpha who’d wanted a pretty omega on his arm and he’d paid a pretty penny to get it. He’d kept plying Tony with wine and sweet fruits marinated in alcohol in the hope that Tony would let him fuck him after – which he hadn’t, thank you very much. His virtue may have been a little tarnished but he still had his virginity intact.
“No more than usual,” Steve groaned good-naturedly. “I think the only thing permanently injured is my pride.”
Tony supported Bucky while Steve hastily pulled on a rough shirt and pants and then helped Bucky into a similar getup.
He’d left out that as another lead in quenching omega-prejudice once and for all, Tony had shortly after the twin’s birth taken on a protégé – Harley Keener, who was a bright, feisty omega with almost as much fire in his eyes as Tony. Although, with the way Harley was racing past his peers, leaving them in the dust both in the academical and physical departments, Tony would have to admit that Harley was far more competitive than he’d ever been.
“I really didn’t mean to make you feel like I put you in that situation to get information for me. It killed me not to step in and bash Stone’s face against the wall, but when I got there you already had him on the ground.” Taking a deep breath, Steve says, “I know you can take care of yourself, Tony.”
Tony chuckled, exhausted. “Yeah, I know what you mean.” He felt no need for talking, soaking in the tranquility, letting his thoughts wander here and there, ignoring the way his knees ached or how his back protested the awkward position he was folded in.
“I do,” Tony confessed, shakily. “I’ve wanted you since the first time I saw you but I’ve been too fucking cowardly to tell you and accept your courtship.”
“You mean to tell me that my son’s been fed bullshit propaganda about omegas - what they can and can’t do - and he
“Stop teasing me,” Steve implored hoarsely and turned pleading eyes on him, where he’d shimmied down between Steve’s spread legs, the ocean blue almost swallowed up by dilated pupils.
“I want to see what’s going on,” Steve insisted and shook Bucky’s hand off, quickly sliding into an opening in between two people when they sidled away from each other. “Fucking hell, Steve!” Bucky exclaimed and dove after him, but Steve paid him no mind. What he saw when he stumbled out of the mass would forever be seared into his mind, never forgotten and fondly remembered in later years.
“Big, strong, blond, handsome – take your pick,” Tony answered loftily. “I swear he can probably break me in half with just his biceps. That, or smile so blindingly you’re left dazed and confused for the rest of your days, wondering what the hell happened.”
Steve’s smile was as brittle as Tony’s thoughts. “Friends then. And I’m serious about the laws. Whether I’m allowed to court you or not, I want to make a change. All omegas, you especially, deserve to have the same rights as alphas and betas.”
“Who is this Tony you speak of?” Thor asked curiously. He stepped back when Sam knelt down to help Steve get his shin-guards off.
To say he’d been floored when he realized that Steve had kept his promise, that he was rewriting the laws restricting Tony and any other omega inside of Brooklyn’s borders, would’ve been an understatement.
Steve surged up and caught Tony’s smiling mouth in a deep kiss, hope and happiness and love overtaking him completely. They’d tried for so long and it had never happened. Steve had ignored the whispers around him; whispers that said Tony was barren, that Steve had chosen an unsuitable mate, that their marriage was a sham, that they weren’t a good match.
“We will continue this discussion in the morning. Please, let’s continue.” He motions for Stone and Hani to join them at their table as the chattering of voices around them resume. Even though Tony knows – he fucking knows – it’s just a formality, Hani’s self-satisfied smile and Stone’s smug face still stings and makes him want to hurl. He does his best to tamper down the heartbreak threatening to choke him, and swallows around the big lump suddenly stuck in his throat.
Steve tried to give a reassuring smile. If it came out as strained as he thought it did, no wonder Tony looked mildly alarmed. “Really, Tony. Thank you for checking up on me.”
The angry shout brought Steve up short. Bucky, who’d been walking right behind him, crashed into his back when he stopped so suddenly.
“I thank you, Lord Stone. I would like for you and I to leave business behind tonight and instead enjoy this feast my consort has prepared for us,” he says calmly, obviously pretending not to notice Stone’s triumphant smile or Hani’s smoldering eyes devouring his trim, handsome figure. If Hani doesn’t want into Steve’s pants, Tony will eat his gilded sandals.
“Do you have a claiming gift in mind?” Tony changed the subject, his fingers tickling over Steve’s ribs and making him squirm at the sensation.
Steve kissed every inch of skin he could reach. He took both of Tony’s wrists in one of his hands and held them over Tony’s head, caressing his face, collarbones, chest, stomach and hips with the other. He littered Tony’s neck and chest with bites and hickeys, growling in satisfaction with each new bruise blooming as proof of his unrestrained passion.
“Rhodey did. He thought it would be a good idea to lessen your workload seeing as you’re eight months pregnant,” she said archly with a pointed look at Tony’s stomach.
His knuckles ached with the need to punch this asshole in his face, to make him understand how to treat his omega – his fucking
“No, I know,” Steve assured, giving Tony’s ass a quick, fond squeeze, a smile flirting with the corners of his mouth. “I know that’s not who you are. I just imagined you’d let me take charge in bed.” He giggled. “Silly me.”
“You’re all idiots,” Natasha informed him and with a last, pointed look at Steve, she left them to go back to the arena. She was a real fan of Thor’s, even if she’d never admit it and they were too scared of her to tell Thor.
“... I see,” Steve said slowly, at length, eyes trained on the stage. “Would you like me to stop courting you?”
The group found this really funny and raucous laughter echoed between dark windows and empty stoops up and down the alley. A small scuffle occurred and Tony thrashed to get loose from the hand around his neck holding him down to no avail. The hand pressed Tony’s throbbing face harder against the ground.
“Then he started shouting and Rhia shouted back, Hani threw up his hands and fled and I cried instead of laughing like I really wanted to,” Peter supplied happily.
“You are though,” Tony whispered, eyes locked with Steve’s as he leaned in, body aching with the need to feel Steve’s against him. “You are my alpha and my mate; that makes you the most special person in the whole world.”
Thor’s laugh boomed loud over the crowd’s shouts. “Come at me then, Prince Rogers, and we will see if your prowess has grown since last year.”
Steve gasped along with the rest of the hall as a shield came into view; only it was of a kind he had never seen before. It was round and painted in red and blue circles with a large, white star in the middle – the symbol of Brooklyn.
Tony reclined back into the chaise again with a kid supported in each arm, and asked Clint to fetch a couple of bottles. They quieted down once they had a rubber-teat in their mouths, their vigorous suckling loud in the room. It was a nice one, as far as rooms go, comfortable and containing anything Tony or the babies could ever need. But it wasn’t
Steve finished as quickly as he could, taking great care not to jostle Tony’s tender nose when he cleaned the lower half of his face.
“W – what the hell do you think you’re doing?” Tony stuttered around a moan, when Steve nailed the head of his cock against his prostate purposefully.
It wasn’t anything new to him, but to Steve it was the most amazing sight every time he looked at his husband; Tony’s hair was tied in a messy bun and he wore rough, torn working clothes with smears of dirt and oil all over them with his big stomach jutting out in front of him. Still, Tony’s skin was infused with that healthy pregnancy glow and his silver-streaked, black hair was glossy and he smelled so good, Steve’s mouth flooded with saliva.
“I don’t want Hani, Tony; how can you think that?” His words are achingly gentle and a little hurt and Tony’s heart lurches in his chest. He doesn’t want to look at Steve but he has to.
“Don’t have one, don’t need one to keep me in line.” Tony wasn’t ashamed of his single status. “My thoughts and actions are my own, unlike yours.”
and declared them best friends forever. Steve laughed at Rhode’s disgruntled expression, but the tall, black man didn’t seem to mind too much.
They walked around in a constant state of sexual bliss and Bucky was so sick of Steve’s complacent face he’d threatened so deflect to Latveria and join Doom’s doomsday cult if Steve didn’t stop. Steve didn’t think he would; he was nice that way.
“I will take care of the party skulking about in the mountains,” Tony finished from behind them. Steve pivoted, frown already creasing his forehead.
“Alright alright,” he grumbled. He snatched the document out of Pepper’s hand and quickly read through it. He then did a double take, frowning irritably at the neat script. “What the hell? Who did these calculations? It’s all wrong. If they build it like this it’s going to implode the minute they try to load it with anything heavier than a kitten!”
Then they disappeared in the crowd and Steve stood staring after them, a starstruck look on his face.
“Would your Majesty do the honor of giving me the night’s first dance?” Hani asks breathily when dinner is over and tables cleared and moved further back to make room. Steve slants a glance at Tony, who acquiesces with a nod and the fakest smile he’s ever given.
“I don’t think you do,” Steve replied. “I can’t take anything you say right now at face value. You’re compromised by your Heat and I need to leave before I do something we’d both regret in the morning.”
“We don’t need lubricant, I got plenty of that,” Tony laughed, charmed. He squirmed on the bed, managing to get his pants down to his knees, his cock springing free and slapping against his flat stomach.
Thor, too observant for Tony’s tastes, took in his shattered expression and followed Tony’s gaze to where Steve and the harlot smiling at him pranced around.
“And his hands!” Tony exclaimed, oblivious to Steve’s darkening expression and Bucky and Sam’s gleeful faces. “His hands are so big, with those long fingers I bet they can completely encircle my waist easily.”
“Say you’ll be mine Tony,” Steve whispered. “Say you’ll be mine and I’ll never let you go, same as I’ll be yours for the rest of my days and longer still.”
Steve had no idea where Peter’s ability to shamelessly confess everything he may have done, right or wrong, came from, but he appreciated it all the same. It made it easier to make peace between Rhia and Patrick every time they argued. Patrick was passionate and stubborn to the point of obstinacy sometimes – the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, Steve thought contritely – and had a hard time admitting when he was wrong. It wasn’t a flaw as much as it was youth and the belief that he was always right, even if Steve or Tony corrected him.
He’d taken Tony on a tour around the castle, showing him where everything was and introducing him to all of the people working and living there. He didn’t think much of it when Tony seemed the most excited about the big building behind the keep, which housed the royal forge and a big, open space dedicated to designing and building Brooklyn’s famous siege engines.
“Two - ,” Steve blinked. “You mean to tell me that my best friend mated two years ago and he didn’t tell me?!”
“Out of my fucking way, omega,” the alpha spat, spittle flying when he snarled and took a threatening step forward. The omega didn’t budge an inch.
“Shit,” Steve cursed. He buried his head in the crock of Tony’s neck and inhaled deeply. Gods, he’d never get tired of Tony’s scent, it smelled so… Frowning, Steve pulled back and stilled Tony’s movements.
“To what do I owe this pleasure?” Tony purred when he stood before Steve, a seductive glint in his honey-brown eyes. Heat immediately gathered in Steve’s loins, tendrils of warmth slithering up his spine. It was an automatic response by now. Steve saw Tony, Tony saw Steve and they immediately wanted to have sex. Well, not all the time, but enough to be a bit of a laughing stock around the castle and Manhattan in general. Hell, Steve wouldn’t be surprised if people sat around at inns and pubs all around the country and snickered into their tankards about their horny regents.
It wasn’t like Tony really could blame Stern. While Steve was the epitome of a young, strong and beautiful alpha, Stern was decidedly not. He was rather short, only an inch or so taller than Tony, beer-bellied and soft faced and in the middle of his fifties. Before Steve’s obvious strength – as he’d built up a lot of muscles during the months since he’d forcibly befriended Tony – Stern looked all the more like the pitiful alpha he was.
Tony suspects Stone must’ve spent hours repeating and preparing both his speech and the theatrics, because the timing is too perfect. In the pause Stone makes, the aid returns with the unknown probably-omega. The hall is silent as the pair makes their way up the path in the middle of all the tables, stopping beside Stone in front of where Steve and Tony sits, side by side. The lord takes the chain fastened to the collar around the omega’s throat with a sharp and shark-like smile.
“Yes, your Highness?” he said politely, letting the poor man find his composure though he was sorely tempted to mess with him a little.
He always felt like crap after a Heat; it took a great toll on him the longer he went without an alpha’s knot. Tony knew, from his mother talking about it, that it would get better the day he was claimed and knotted properly by an alpha. He sighed. Steve hadn’t knotted him once; he hadn’t even undressed!
“What merits?” Steve wondered, interested to hear their opinions. As an alpha, Patrick could be somewhat overbearing on the twins, which they didn’t like at all. Raised by Tony and Steve to mind their manners, be kind to others, listen to people and always, always remember that their designated gender wasn’t a hindrance in any way, their kids were headstrong and didn’t let anyone tell them they couldn’t do something. But they had to listen to their parents. That one was non-negotiable.
“Alright, alright,” Tony soothed. “Guess you guys are hungry, huh?” He picked Peter up first and handed him to Clint, then cradled Rhia in his arms. They were only two weeks old but they certainly knew what they wanted. To say Tony had been surprised when he went into labor and the doctor told him he’d delivered not one, but two children had been an understatement.
Tony’s sweet, heady scent filled his head and he flexed his arms around Tony’s waist, when Tony clenched around Steve’s cock deep in his ass. Grunting, Steve did his best to meet Tony’s thrusts where he sat cross-legged with Tony undulating in his lap. He gritted his teeth and groaned from deep within his chest as Tony’s nails raked down his back, the sting only adding to the pleasure roaring through him.
Steve laughed and swept Tony up in a bridal carry – ignoring Tony’s indignant protests. “Calm down and let me take you to our rooms. I’ll show you what
“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about, of course,” Stone says hoarsely, slowly licking his lips when Tony presses their fronts together and his fingers creep up to stroke Stone’s cheek. He wants to keep Stone’s eyes on his face. “But-“ he starts, “I would always be glad so give your regards to Lord Stane, when I go back home.”
“Uh…” the prince seemed dazed, his blue eyes – so fucking stunning, the color was unreal – unfocused and glazed. “I’m here to- I would like-“ He cut himself off several times, searching for words.
Tony’s mood soured further. Where the hell was Steve and the others? Tony wasn’t here to stand around and be the night’s laughingstock, that was for sure.
Terror streaked through him when loud voices shouted from down the alley, jeering and calling out for him. “Here kitty, kitty, kitty! Come back and play with us!”
“By the gods,” someone, Tony didn’t know his name, breathed in awe. Tony fidgeted nervously with a bracelet, he didn’t know where to look as their gazes slid over his form again and again.
Tony’s grin softened into a small, shy smile. He pressed a tender kiss over Steve’s heart. “I don’t think anyone could’ve missed it; you’ve argued loud enough to make yourself heard even in Asgard.”
“Well,” Tony laughed while Steve gently deposited him on their bed, “nothing I guess, but what with Hani fleeing the room as soon as we’re in it and Bucky walking around and looking like he’s scenting something really unpleasant, I’d say it’s lucky I’m due soon.”
For the rest of the night and towards tomorrow, Tony and Steve make love to each other and don’t think about anything else.
“That’s harsh.” Tony felt a twinge of pity for the big prince. Nobody deserve that kind of treatment. “What are you going to do?”
Tony pretends to be offended a few more seconds then rolls his eyes and lets himself fall from Steve’s hold down onto the bed, arms outstretched and a big smile curving his mouth.
“You’re killing me,” Steve gritted out, head falling back against the pillows, groaning from deep within his chest when Tony took mercy on him and swallowed his length, taking it deep in his throat.
It hadn’t solved one problem as much as it’d created new ones, when alphas and betas too stuck in the old ways discriminated against their fellow, omega soldiers. Tony hadn’t really had a desire to become Steve’s second in command before that little tidbit of information had reached his ears. The words of omegas being treated poorly by men and women supposed to have their backs had galvanized Tony’s will to go in the front and show the poor sods just how dangerous an omega set on fighting could be. The unfair treatment and protests had slowly died down after that, even if there still were families - old and distinguished and horribly conservative - who still spread misinformation and fed their kids lies of how it was against the laws of nature to grant omegas too much freedom.
Tony inhales sharply and without a word he sweeps past Steve and Sam, angrily stalking down the corridor towards the royal suite. He won’t show Steve how those words cut into him. He fucking won’t even if it kills him!
They could hear distant screams and more thundering booms; Steve had never heard anything like it. They waited with bated breaths as the noises came closer and jumped when a guard’s face was suddenly smashed up against the bars in the door. His face was bloody and terrified and he vanished with a high pitched scream of terror before they could react.
“Mind if I join you?” Steve walked after them when they went inside. “I’m not here with anyone and I could use the company?”
Tony winced as he sat up. “Yeah, so they Claimed each other when it looked like Hydra was planning on sticking them in a room full of Heat-induced omegas. That put kibosh on the plan to turn Bucky into the fist of Hydra and kind of ended the entire endeavor. Well, except for their desire to have you father the other half of the planet, that’s not going to end soon.”
“Of course. King Rogers’ beautiful omega, famous across all lands: as fierce as he’s intelligent and always standing beside his king with unwavering loyalty. Since the first time I saw you I’ve wanted to show you what it’d be like with a real alpha. I’d knot you until you can’t see straight.”
Thor smiled amusedly, like Tony was a little, innocent child. “I think you will come to learn, in time, that there is no greater force in this world than love. It can build countries and destroy them. It can unite enemies as well as make them.” He pulled Tony close enough to bend down and whisper in his ear. “And I think that you will find, the day you finally give in and let friend Steve claim you, that love can also bring you the greatest pleasure and satisfaction.”
“Wait!” An idea had formed in the back of Steve’s mind. “Why don’t you join us at the feast tonight?”
Before Steve knew how it happened and could protest, he found himself submerged in a large, copper bathtub, naked, bewildered, and wet as Tony was spirited away out of his sight. He was forcibly scrubbed within an inch of his life, despite his complaints that he could bathe himself. He got a mouthful of soap for his troubles and Pepper gave a wry snort. “Hardly, your Highness. If I left it up to you, you would walk to your coronation in your usual, plain, rags with straw, twigs and leaves stuck in your hair.”
“I accept this gift,” Steve said with a shaky voice. “I thank my mate for his consideration.” The traditional words rang hollow and niggles of doubt crept into Steve’s mind. Would his own gift measure up?
“Never.” Steve spit out a glob of blood, tongue prodding the split lip he’d gotten earlier and grinned back at Thor. “Today is the day I take you down.”
He was so provocative, almost suggestive, where he stood with his arms crossed and legs far apart, strong jaw and high cheekbones defined as he held his chin defiantly lifted and faced the enraged alpha head on.
Thor’s eyes tracked Steve and Loki’s steps with deep longing and sadness painted all over his face. “I have been in love with Loki since the first time my eyes lit upon him, but he refuses to even talk to me.”
The kids loved him and even Tony had grudgingly admitted that the younger omega wasn’t so bad - once he’d stopped making cow-eyes at Steve that was – and Steve knew of more than one alpha who’d approached the beautiful omega and requested permission to court him. Hani, not having any family to do it on his behalf, had so far declined every entreaty.
“Oh my gods,” Tony whimpered, eyes wide in shock as Steve thrust into him on a long, slow push that never seemed to end. It didn’t hurt exactly, it wasn’t the first time Tony had something up his ass after all, but it was… different.
Those eyes perused Steve slowly, something in them flashing by too fast for Steve to interpret, and then Tony smiled. It was soft and thankful and transformed Tony’s face into something that went beyond beauty and into the realm of fantasy. He was so striking that Steve felt dizzy.
Steve snorted. Yeah, he wasn’t supposed to be out alone with Bucky in Midtown, but what his father didn’t know wouldn’t kill him. It’d been easy to give their stern teacher – Mr. Hammond - the slip earlier; taking a right where the rest of the group of students took a left. Steve was glad to be rid of them for a while; their stuck-up sneers and stuffy attitudes were almost enough to choke him.
Steve’s knot engaged properly in a heartbeat, expanding past the point of comfort, hurtling Tony into a state of semi-panic, thinking it wasn’t possible to fit it all inside of him. In the same moment he was sure he was about to split in half, something suddenly shifted and it became far more than just pain filled pressure. The knot swelled until it nudged against Tony’s prostate and sent waves of renewed desire up and down his spine, stimulating new, hidden nerve endings he’d never even known he had before. Head spinning from the conflicting sensations, Tony collapsed onto Steve’s chest like a puppet whose strings had been cut, both of them shuddering and moaning when the movement jostled Steve’s knot, causing it to tug at Tony’s swollen rim.
“Really?” Steve didn’t like how small he sounded. Tony’s eyes softened. He took one of Steve’s hands and pressed it against his cheek. Tony’s skin was soft and uninjured under the blood and grime and Steve’s heart calmed somewhat.
With his heart beating furiously and battle spirit singing through his veins, Steve engaged again. It was over before he knew it and soon enough, he was once again on his back in the sand, Thor’s hammer resting victoriously on his sternum.
“Language,” Steve chided halfheartedly. It went ignored, which, fair. It wasn’t like Tony didn’t swear all the time.
Steve took the better part of Bucky’s weight, all but carrying him as they took off at a quicker pace than before. Steve’s body was screaming for rest, the tremble in his legs amplified by the shaking floor. Dust and small debris rained down on their heads, turning their hair an off-white and dulling Tony’s colorful armor.
“You’re really not the type of alpha who chose to sit down at the tavern and drink ale while I was in childbed,” Tony remarked. “You’re a king and you were busy quenching an uprising. I’d say that makes you exempt from keeping vigil at my bedside.”
Steve’s eyes softened and his mouth stretched in a tremulous smile. “Don’t be, it’s only me” he said as he cupped Tony’s cheek tenderly. Tony couldn’t help but nuzzle into the wide, warm palm, suppressing the urge to purr like a contented cat.
Steve nodded thoughtfully. While Natasha’s plan had merits, Steve didn’t like where that left the rest of the oncoming army. “I think it’s a good idea but we still have the western front to worry about. We can’t leave ourselves open for an attack while we’re dealing with this.”
“Come here,” he says, reaching out to Tony. Head dropping forward and shoulders slumping even as he reaches back, Tony curls his fingers around Steve’s thicker ones. Steve slowly pulls him across the room, until he’s standing with his back to the big mirror in the corner. He pivots and gently tugs Tony in front him, making him face the mirror. Steve’s right behind him, his chin hooked over Tony’s shoulder.
Tony had no idea how long they kissed but at some point, air became a real concern and he managed to pull away even when all of what he was, was screaming at him to stay, to drown in these feelings and dedicate every fiber of his being to please his alpha.
Nodding, Tony stepped back. “I’ll come back in a few weeks, whether you’ve finally killed Schmidt or not.”
Steve snorts. “No, you’re not, you’re not even forty yet and menopause usually doesn’t happen until you’re around fifty.”
“You heard me,” Tony says, his nimble fingers getting back at weaving a portion of Steve’s thick, blond mane into an elaborate and gorgeous braid. “I saw him leading a cloaked figure with a chain around their neck into the keep when they arrived, and let me tell you…” Tony pauses and reaches for a pearl, expertly fastening it with a twist of his fingers. “He did a lot to make sure no one could catch a peek underneath that cloak.”
“Whatever,” he muttered. He turned to leave and bumped into a wall of muscle. Rubbing his smarting nose and looking up, Tony’s jaw dropped when he met the blue eyes of Thor Odinson, crown-prince of Asgard, five-times champion of the tournament and a walking wet dream.
Tony chewed on his lower lip, ignoring the alpha who had hired him for the night when he huffed in impatience. “Well, it was good to see you, have a good night!”
“How long, Tony?” Steve yelled over the growl of a mighty fire gaining momentum somewhere below and behind them. He imagined he could feel the heat licking at his heels.
“Alright then,” Steve said, assured, and gave a small thrust. He nailed Tony’s prostate again, drawing sounds from him that he’d never made before. That set the tone for the beginning of their lovemaking, Steve staring at Tony’s face with utmost attention, to gauge his reactions and adjust his movements accordingly.
Tony’s way too old to have any business blushing like he’s still an un-knotted, wet behind the ear omega. Still, there he stands, cheeks heating under Steve’s appreciative stare and feeling a little of his confidence returning. He ducks his head with a pleased, little smile, despite the dread growing stronger in the pit of his stomach. For the sake of the night ahead and the need to keep their peace with Lord Stone, he has to ignore it.
“Hey,” Tony said when Steve started to clean the blood off of his face. “I’m alright. Really shaky and I think I’m in shock, but I’m alright.” It took everything he had to force those words out, he was still trembling all over and he doubted he’d go anywhere alone for a long, long time, but he was fine. Tony refused to give those assholes any kind of power over him.
“I’d rather eat shit and die,” Tony muttered. The key refused to find its way into the hole, his hands trembling too much and the sweat dripping into his eyes didn’t help the situation. He didn’t know what he’d been thinking, going out just before his Heat was about to begin. He’d felt the telltale tingling at the base of his spine just before he locked the shop up, but he was out of food and had to restock before the Heat hit him full force.
“He and his aid made sure only my eyes would land on that paper.” Steve’s voice tugs Tony out of his own thoughts, and he misses Steve’s warm fingers when they fall away and his husband gets to his feet.
“I love you,” Steve almost snarled, sweat dripping from his face onto Tony’s chest. He released his hold on Tony’s wrists and scooped Tony’s legs over his arms, bending him in half, deepening the reach of each thrust until Tony was incoherent from the zealous onslaught.
And Tony could only laugh and laugh for the rest of the night while Thor kept him company. Nat, Clint, Sam and Bucky all appeared at one time and another, but Steve’s absence was like a sore thumb none of them mentioned. When Tony found Bruce in a corner, talking amicably with Natasha, they both agreed that the night hadn’t been a complete disaster and returned home in good spirits.
“Who is it, the king himself?” Tony joked and put the hammer down. He grabbed a rag from a pile nearby and wiped his soot-streaked fingers on it. Given that the rag was as dirty as his hands, it barely helped, but Tony didn’t care. He picked up a mug of water from a table beside the forge.
“No, you’re angry, and you have every right to be.” Steve’s calm voice rumbling in his ear doesn’t lessen the anger burning him from inside and out. He wants to scream and thrash and throw Steve out of the fucking window. He tries to break out of Steve’s unwelcome embrace, he’s struggling and throwing all his might into getting loose, but Steve holds fast and doesn’t let go.
“I am fucking calm!” Tony growls, blinded by something that feels a lot like betrayal. He throws back an elbow, aiming for Steve’s ribs, but he blocks it and tightens his grasp even more.
He wasn’t really surprised that Steve had vanished; it wasn’t like they’d promised anything after all. Tony couldn’t really remember that much after getting upstairs, but blurry recollections of Steve over him, around him but never
It’s like he’s been punched in the chest. He can’t help the small flinch and quickly ducks his gaze, so Steve can’t see how miserable his words make him. Steve’s fingers gently grip his chin, thumb tenderly brushing the edge of Tony’s beard when he forces Tony to raise his face, to stare deeply into Tony’s pain-filled eyes. “I can’t deny I think he’s beautiful”, Steve repeats, “but it’s not for the reason you think, Tony.”
“I shouldn’t have been so rough with you,” Steve explained in a hushed, regretful tone. “I didn’t want to hurt you.” His fingers grazed a hand-shaped bruise on Tony’s hip. Tony followed the gesture with lethargic eyes, a hum of satisfaction taking root in his heart at the sight of Steve’s possessiveness.
Tony took it all in like he was an outsider looking in on an elaborate ceremony worthy of any stage; the servants were so coordinated and in sync it was almost scary how efficient they were. He manfully held out until they took a step back, their admiring gazes sliding over him without feeling intrusive or offensive. They simply looked at him like he was a work of art, their masterpiece turned alive under their care.
His tone must’ve penetrated the lust-filled fog in Steve’s head because he looked down at Tony with a small frown. “What’s what supposed to mean?”
Seeing the humor in the whole mess, Tony shrugged with an unapologetic grin. “Clint likes to gossip. Apparently Bucky threatened to chop his balls off if he told anyone, but he couldn’t keep his mouth shut anyway.”
blood-purity, we want to make a super-soldier out of Bucky and force him to repopulate half of the planet when they’ve killed everyone not passing muster?”
“Guards!” Tony hissed jokingly at Sam and Clint, when Steve stepped out through the door. “I command you; seize this scoundrel immediately and behead him, he has greatly offended the royal fetus and its carrier!”
Before Tony knew how it happened, he was holding on to Steve’s big, strong arm – his biceps were bigger than Tony’s head and rock hard, oh gods – and Stern was bobbing along in their wake into the theater proper. It wasn’t like they had designated seats and Steve picked out three in the back, letting Tony sit down first before taking the chair beside him and letting Stern take the final one. Wholly blasé, Steve carried on to dominate the conversation and prattled on about the weather, the state of the capital, the economy and omega rights.
Adam and Davy. It figured. They were sons from two of the most conservative families in the capital and Patrick’s best friends.
Eventually the din died down but Tony didn’t dare to move. He jumped when all of a sudden something warm and soft was draped over his exposed back and ass.
“I bet he can’t wait to sink his cock into Hani’s tight, virgin ass and knot him good. Maybe he’ll make him pregnant on the first go, you never know.”
Steve would never get over how alike he and their eldest was. With his blond hair, blue eyes and slight build, Patrick was a dead ringer for Steve at the same age, fourteen years old and on the cusp of adulthood. He was also as compassionate and kind but without the need to prove himself and fight every fight he could get into. He still had one hell of a hot head, though. Steve blamed that one on Tony. He’d never said it out loud where Tony could hear him; he valued his sex-life and manhood too much.
They slowly walked out of the arena and ducked into the opening on the far wall together. Thor didn’t have a match until the next one’s winner was declared and Steve was out of the tournament for his loss. Beneath the stands it was cooler, the shade a balm on their overheated skin. Bucky, Nat and Sam waited for them in the corner where Steve stashed his gear when he was competing, a shit eating grin stretching their faces. Well, Nat smiled, which for her was the equivalent of a grin.
“By the power vested in me by the Gods I now pronounce you married. You may claim your omega,” Yinsen proclaimed and cut the Bonding cord with a small, ceremonial dagger.
“I know, but I’m not above using that to get you away from here.” Tony closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Steve’s collarbone.
“Lucky bastard,” another one muttered when they drew back and closed the door behind them, leaving Tony and Steve to stare at each other in anticipatory silence.
Bruce’s smile was gentle as he looked at Tony with kind eyes. “I sometimes forget that you’re so young, Tony. Love isn’t something to be afraid of. The more you’re denying yourself and Steve the happiness you could have together, the more miserable you’re going to be.”
“I’m not so far gone yet,” Tony gritted out. “I know who you are and what I’m doing. I want you, Steve.”
Just like that the murderous aura vanished from around Steve and he seemed totally carefree with a rakish grin curving his full lips. Damn him for being so pretty. Now Tony wouldn’t be able to think about anything other than how he wanted Steve to whisk him off to a secluded corner or broom closet and have his way with him.
“I like you too, Thor. I’m honestly a little amazed by how much you know about me and what Steve’s been doing. You’re not here more than once a year.”
Steve frowned. “Where else would I be?” He came into the room and placed the food and water on the bedside table.
Tony could only stare at Steve; at this wonderful, sweet alpha who somehow loved Tony and gave him gifts more fit for a king than him.
It had finally opened Steve’s eyes and made him realize that even if omegas were free to do as they pleased in other aspects of their lives, true freedom hadn’t been granted to them before they could also decide if they wanted to help defend their country or not. Steve had signed the law with tears in his eyes, mind undoubtedly filled with horrible images of Tony dead in a war somewhere, but he’d done it anyway, so that Tony and every other omega could truly rule over their lives the way they saw fit.
Tony smiled when he could meet his gaze; nothing else but love shining out of his brown eyes. “Feel better?” he asked without any hint of mockery.
“You sure seemed to appreciate him when he was plastered against you.” It’s a little acid, but fuck, this is Steve he’s talking to. If he can’t be caustic around him there’s no hope for them.
Tony’s really embarrassed when he bursts into tears. Steve doesn’t even flinch when Tony flings himself at him and holds him tight. He doesn’t even know what he’s crying over. He has no reason to feel like this; relieved and sad and so damned happy at the same time.
Tony threw up his hands and turned back to Steve. “You want to have this discussion now, when we’re minutes away from getting cut down by Doom’s fucking minions?”
“You can have him when we’re done,” someone slurred. “The bitch’s in Heat, he won’t care if you get a turn too!”
After the combined Claiming and coronation feast Tony was led into the royal bedchamber by a gaggle of giggling servants. The anticipation hovering over them was thick enough to cut with a knife, a tangible tone humming in between the unspoken words and knowing glances the small group exchanged as they helped Tony get ready for the Claiming night.
“I had not really contemplated why omegas have been subjected to laws written to suppress and restrict them before I met Tony. I am ashamed to admit that while I have never liked bullies and have fought them on occasion, I never really had to think about what omegas have to live with, before he pointed out my own privilege to me. As an alpha I have no one to answer to, save the Gods and laws written by other alphas. Why is it different for omegas?”
“No,” Tony said at length, when the silence threatened to become oppressing. Steve’s hand dropped and he chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment, his jaw flexing. Here it comes, Tony thought. The indignation, the entitlement and demands for him to obey. It was always the same.
So, Tony got a job as engineer-in-training with Rhodes while Steve got serious with amending the laws keeping other, brilliant omegas such as Tony captive under their thumb. It wasn’t easy. Steve was so sick of arguing for basic, human rights by the time he finally managed to quell all protesters.
to,” Steve insisted stubbornly. “I wasn’t talking out of my ass when I said that the current laws are designed to oppress omegas.”
“I wanted to have your time for the rest of the day, if Consort Stark would be so inclined,” he smiled as he bent down to press a kiss to Tony’s full lips. Mmmm, he could do that all day.
“Geez, no,” Tony answered flatly. “I really love it when a big, hulking alpha has decided he wants me and I don’t really get a say in it.”
“Hm,” Tony grunted, begrudgingly lifting his head and resting his chin on Steve’s chest, gazing up at a vulnerable spot just underneath Steve’s jaw. “How so?”
Had it been Steve’s hopeful expression, or the fact that he’d been sitting there in the shadows underneath the arena with a sunbeam filtering through a hole in the wall, highlighting him in all of his glory? Had his muscles - shining with a layer of sweat - and long, slicked back, blond, mane dulled Tony’s common sense and made him say yes?
