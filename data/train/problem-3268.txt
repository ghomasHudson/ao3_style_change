happen to order one of the best items on the menu, if you want my opinion. I can’t take credit for it, but I can tell you that it’s one of Ellen’s best recipes. I’ve never had jambalaya like hers and you won’t find anything else like it in California. I’d be willing to bet on that.”
Dean doesn’t know why he feels so deeply for this stranger, but there’s something about him, something that screams that this whole situation isn’t right. Steve’s not some drifter who enjoys spending his time wandering from city to city. He’s lost and alone… and
“Listen, I gotta get some paperwork done and send a few emails. You’re welcome to hang out here for a bit and wait out the rain. Should pass us over pretty soon. This one’s not stickin’ around for long.” Dean can see the man’s shoulders relax at that information.
Dean makes it home exhausted, but content with the way the night played out and happy to know that everyone got home safely. It takes him no time at all to fall face first into his bed and let sleep consume him, but another vivid dream follows soon after.
He leaves the kitchen and his eyes immediately dart towards Cas’s table. Shit. It’s empty. He’s already gone.
They quickly plan their family dinner for Friday night, agreeing to get together early enough that Ellen and Bobby can enjoy the company while still being able to make it back to the Roadhouse before the dinner crowd really sets in.
“Cas, wait.” They both freeze, Cas seemingly holding his breath and Dean not sure where his words are coming from. “Why don’t you take my number? That way, we can try for that beer some other time.”
“What?” Steve’s eyes grow wider than before as he looks down at the bowl of soup Dean is pulling from the brown bag. He’s at a loss for words, but quickly declines. “No. No, thank you.”
From on his back and hidden underneath the truck’s engine, Dean rolls his eyes at Bobby Singer, the owner of this old auto repair shop that he calls a business, but Dean knows better than to talk too much sass.
Sam shrugs. “I saw you talking to a dude in a maroon blazer. He was carrying a shoulder bag. You seemed familiar with him, is all.” Dean doesn’t miss the way that Sam is being careful with his words here.
He dreams that he wakes up on the floor of his living room. He looks up to see a figure with dark hair and a long coat standing in the kitchen, but it’s not his kitchen. He’s in someone else’s house. He can’t see a face, but the man wordlessly beckons him closer.
Thank god. Dean isn’t sure he could have handled whatever it was that Sam was about to say. He already knows that Sam isn’t a proponent of the one night stand, but to make it worse, Sam has been particularly worried over Dean for the past several months, after his breakup with his last girlfriend, Lisa. No matter how many times Dean assures him that he’s over her and he’s okay, Sam remains fussy and protective, like Dean is a fragile thing ready to crumble at any given moment. The truth of it is, he really is over her. Sure, the breakup wasn’t a picnic, but once he got some space from Lisa, it didn’t take long to come to the realization that they were never good for one another. Dean had simply been going through the motions, but his heart was never fully invested. He doesn’t miss her.
The Roadhouse is something that Bobby and Ellen have been slowly working towards for the past several years, Ellen having always wanted to own her own restaurant but putting her ambitions on hold when two little boys were unexpectedly placed in her care all those years ago. Dean’s heart clenches at the memory and the knowledge of her sacrifice and he forces the thoughts aside to avoid becoming emotional, focusing instead on Bobby’s amusing display of childish obstinance.
When Dean reads the final line in which Castiel enthusiastically encourages the locals to embrace the Roadhouse as a new community treasure, silence falls on the room. Everyone waits for someone else to break it.
“Alright.” Sam interrupts. “I think it’s time I take this one home. She’s had enough for tonight. In fact, she had enough a few drinks ago.”
“Apologies for the interruption fellas. Dean? Bobby and Sam could really use your help in the kitchen. Do you mind?”
Sam did. Before the car came to a full stop, I launched myself out into the fresh air. Stumbling about two steps, I let the contents of my stomach splatter onto the ground at my feet. It wasn’t much. As I continued to dry heave, my body trembling uncontrollably, I heard Castiel pull up behind the Impala.
He was giving me one of those unreadable looks of his that I still struggled with even after knowing him for years. Without a word, he took the trash can and set it on the ground. I still couldn’t meet his gaze. But when his fingers reached out and caught the edge of my shirt, I couldn’t help but look up. He noted that I jerked away slightly and paused.
“If you think Sam and I are legends, then you know who Cas is. He’s…he’s the best part of who we are. Sure, he’s messed up a couple times – we all have – but he’s never given up; never stopped trying to be better. He summoned the Empty to take him to save
“There’s seven of them.” I straightened, rubbing my neck and clearing my throat as I added croakily, “And who knows, maybe we can track down some other loud things that’ll wreck your day.”
A shudder passed down Dean’s spine, but he managed to shake it off before anyone caught on. Clearing his throat, he put on the best uncaring swagger he could and flashed the badge on his jacket. The cocky action seemed to amuse the burly Sherriff and he calmed slightly.
Everyone was there. Sam, Eileen, Garth, they were okay. All the other hunters too. I hurriedly wiped at my face. Questions assaulted me. Was I okay? Where was Jack? Did Cas make it out? But they all quieted as the inky portal began to close. We watched with mouths open as the black substance slowly collapsed in on itself and then disappeared. The silence was deafening.
Just as before, Dean thinks he should be scared, but there is a calmness that settles over him that he can’t explain, so he approaches the man in the kitchen. When the stranger speaks, his voice is deep and commanding. Dean can’t quite grasp what exactly is being said, but Dean feels his pulse quicken. It all seems so ominous, and yet Dean feels safe, protected. The man’s presence is somehow familiar and calming. Dean doesn’t know why.
“Jeeze, Dean. Subtle, much? Why don’t we have a drink first before you go hunting for better company.” Sam says it jokingly, but Dean knows there is a hint of honesty there.
Ash reaches across the table, picks up Dean’s beer and downs it with impressive speed. He slams it back down on the table with a.
“Har har,” Dean mocks back. He knows Bobby’s just giving him shit which, coincidentally, usually means he’s in a good mood. Feeling brave, Dean pushes his luck. “How about while I’m out here in the cold, you pour me a cup of that coffee? I know Jody made you the good stuff today and I know she makes enough for you to share.”
“I did, thank you. I meant it when I told Ellen that this place is amazing. I think that she and Bobby will be very successful.”
It doesn’t take long for Sam’s dog to notice the newcomer and she comes running back to join in on the attention. A few moments later and Dean is nothing but an afterthought for the dogs as they make fast friends and take off chasing each other out into the water. He’s laughing at the two of them when his ears perk up. Someone is yelling for their dog, which is typical at a dog beach, but he knows panic when he hears it.
Ash scoffs behind a knowing smile. “Where else you think she’d be? Listen, I gotta run to the bank for her before they close or she’ll have my ass. I was supposed to go two hours ago. You gonna hang out a bit? I’ll come back!” He finishes the question without waiting for an answer as he takes off in the direction Dean just came from. He’s in a hurry but doesn’t quite run, although looking at the time, he totally should. Ash just might have the laziest urgency Dean’s ever seen, either that or he’s the most energetic stoner, but who knows which. Whichever it is, Ash is out of sight and Dean turns on his heel to head inside.
With that, Castiel turns down the beach with Seb trotting happily alongside him. Dean watches them walk away for just a moment before he also turns away, he and Zaz making their way back up the shore towards where the car is parked. As he goes, he can’t help but feel like he is leaving something behind. He might have actually asked for Castiel’s number had it not been for the girlfriend thing, but even so, walking away just doesn’t feel right. That thought in mind, Dean looks back over his shoulder.
, does he look just as good as Dean remembers. Castiel is wearing fitted dark jeans with a black t-shirt under a maroon blazer. There’s a brown leather bag slung over his shoulder and he looks every bit the part of a young, casual professor. He has barely-there stubble on his face and Dean swears his skin is already a shade darker from the California sun. He silently wonders if Castiel has been back at the beach.
Throughout the evening, Dean finds his eyes wandering across the room in search of a head of dark, unruly hair. Each time he spots Castiel, something behind his ribcage dips in excited anticipation, a feeling of relief mixed with nervousness that Cas is still there. More often than not, he also finds that Cas is already staring back at him, their eyes meeting across the room. It’s like they can sense each other’s presence, or some shit like that, and Dean isn’t sure if it’s kind of cool, or kind of creepy. Maybe a little of both?
“I can’t find him anywhere. He just took off running and I couldn’t keep up! Oh God, she’s going to kill me. I need to find him.” The man’s words tumble out in a rush while he runs a hand through his hair (ah - so that’s why it looks like the dude just rolled out of a good night in bed).
“I just mean that I’m headed to a family thing, so uh, thanks for the invite, but I can’t. It’s the first time we’re all going to have a chance to be together in a long time and--”
“Well I think we should celebrate properly, what do you guys think?” Sam asks the room. Dean shoots Jess a look of shock and she smiles, raising her eyebrows and shrugging her shoulders, and Dean can read her unasked question -
Benny’s always been the type to take things as they come, never overthinking or overcomplicating things. He’s laid back, tells it like it is, and doesn’t stress over shit like work schedules and angry customers - Dean’s always admired and maybe even envied him for that. It’s an attitude that makes him a great bartender. It also doesn’t hurt that he’s a big dude, so no one tries to start anything when he’s there... usually.
“It’s just that...” Sam trips over his words, clearly not accepting Dean’s weak deflection. “You haven’t done the whole random hookup thing in a while and I--” His thought is cut short by Ash and the two women he’s with nearly crashing into their table in a fit of giggles.
“Oh yeah. Of course. I was about to do the same before Zaz made a new best friend.” He turns to look back out at the dogs, whistles, and calls for them. “Zaz! Come!” She may be a big goofy ball of fur, but at least Sam taught her to obey commands quite well. Sure enough, Zaz turns direction and races towards Dean, Seb following closely behind. When the dogs reach them, Dean and Castiel attach the leashes, ready to head home.
Castiel shrugs and keeps playing with the sand. “Haven’t really been here long enough to make up my mind on that just yet. Moving to a new place can be very… lonely, but this is a big city with a lot to do.” He seems timid now as he’s speaking.
“You finally figure out how to properly tie that tarp down?” Bobby muses from the doorway to the garage, coffee mug in hand.
By the time he’s ready to head out of the kitchen and back out into the crowd, he realizes it’s been nearly forty minutes. Cas is sure to have left by now. Damn. He was really hoping for one more chance to talk with him, maybe get a feel for how the review is going to go, or maybe to lay on his charm a little more, or maybe just to see if he can coax out one more of those small little smiles Cas lets slip on occasion. What’s the harm in that, right? If he leaves the restaurant smiling, then he’s bound to recall his experience as a positive one. So what if Dean wants to be the one to make him smile? It’s not like the food didn’t also do its job in leaving a good impression.
He rubs his hands together and blows on them to warm them up. The sun is going down and with it, the temperature. He can tell that the storm that’s been brewing all day isn’t too far off, but he’s got some time to enjoy his food and the view before he’ll head back and hunker down for the night. The line isn’t too long at the moment and he’s just about to step into the building when he looks up and spots a familiar maroon hoodie off in the distance, the occupant of the hoodie seated at a bench facing the marina.
A few weeks pass and Dean has nearly all but forgotten about Sebastian and his blue-eyed owner… mostly. Tonight, at least, any lingering thoughts of Castiel are miles away.
“Thank you, but please, I don’t want any kind of special treatment. You weren’t saving this seat for someone else were you?”
Dean’s adoptive sister, Jo, and longtime family friend, Ash, are both here helping as well, Jo waiting on tables and Ash working his magic behind the bar. The popularity of this pre-opening can largely be attributed to those two (but if anyone asks Bobby, which no one really does, they are the ones to
“Of course I will. I already planned on bringing them coffee and bagels in the morning. I’ll tell them then.”
“Hey, let the man look! Not everyone is as lucky in love as you and Jess,” Ash defends. “Besides, our buddy here is out of practice. He’s going to need some time to get the training wheels back off again.”
“Anyway, thank you for… well… just thanks.” He looks up through his lashes at Dean, his eyes bluer than an hour ago, if that’s even possible, and lifts the corner of his mouth in a barely-there shadow of a smile.
“Not at all.” He gives Ellen a squeeze to her forearm in a gesture that he hopes is reassuring. Before walking away, he glances at Cas and offers him a small smile as a quick apology. Cas understands and gives him a silent nod in return.
Okay. So Cas remembers his name, too. This is good. It’s fine. It’s also totally fine that he definitely did not imagine how deep and soothing Cas’s voice is. Dean feels a small rush of happiness at seeing him again, but quickly tries to ignore the jolt of excitement that flutters in his chest.
“Yeah, me too.” Dean glances over his shoulder towards Ellen’s retreating frame before twisting back to Cas. “Oh! By the way, how’s Sebastian doing? Any more attempts to sneak out and make new friends?”
for it). Jo and Ash put forth a relentless campaign about the importance and benefits of a strong social media presence, especially for locally owned and operated businesses in an industry dominated by large corporate chains. Ellen supported the idea from the beginning and, though it took awhile to get Bobby on board, he at least had the good sense to admit that he wasn’t a public relations expert and should probably leave those decisions to his younger cohorts.
Sam tells Dean that he’s headed to the library for a study group and they text for a couple of minutes before he’s got to go. Just as he clicks his phone off, Benny returns with a fresh Blue Thursday in his hands. He wiggles it at Dean and raises his eyebrows in question.
Castiel looks up at him, like it’s a weird question to ask, and Dean wonders if he’s somehow managed to cross a line by bringing up his girlfriend. Or maybe she’s his wife? He isn’t sure, but he’s only trying to be polite. “Ummm… she seems to like it, I guess.”
“I don’t normally shop here.” Cas’s words spill out in an unnatural rush, as if they were over-rehearsed.
Driving out here, Dean doesn’t have a particular goal or plan in mind - he usually doesn’t - but something in the air triggers his taste buds and he finds his way to the restaurant, though it’s probably more accurate to call it a hut than a restaurant. He parks his car and taking a long, deep breath, he rolls up the windows and heads towards the line. Just like everything else in Bagyo, the place is old and rustic, not at all fancy. Weathered wooden tables and benches are set up in an open patio area outside. There’s no seating indoors, just a counter where orders are taken. Dean gets in line.
“Oh.” Steve looks down at his backpack, then at the dark storm clouds rolling in, and then back at Dean. “I have somewhere,” he says, suddenly avoiding eye contact again while he busies himself with his backpack, adjusting it before he picks it up and hoists it over his shoulder. “I better get going then.”
Dean has been at the beach for over two hours already and the familiar soreness in his muscles from walking along the sand has begun to creep in. The sun’s heat is settling on his face and arms and he thinks he should probably call it a day, since he hasn’t applied sunscreen since before leaving the apartment this morning. As he readies himself to make his way back to his card, another dog comes bounding up to him, circling his legs.
The man marches towards him and the room fills with flashes of fire and light, sparks dancing all around, cascading from the ceiling. The man stops and Dean’s heart slows. He should be scared, he should run, but he stays put, unable to tear his eyes away the stranger. He’s transfixed. Another particularly vivid flash of light illuminates the room, and Dean picks up on something large and looming just behind the figure. The way the light plays against it, it almost looks like…
Dean can’t help but to laugh at the simplistic, straightforward response. “That may be so, but business has far exceeded Bobby and Ellen’s expectations, and I think your words might have had at least a little something to do with that.”
As he’s putting away the excess rope he used to tie down the tarp, the tinkling pings of raindrops begin to hit the tin shelter above his head, a slow melodic rhythm at first, but by the time Dean grabs the dirty towel he’d discarded earlier and heads for the shop’s indoor garage, the intensity of the rain has already picked up.
The bisque debacle is handled with relative ease and Bobby doesn’t strangle Sam in the process, so Dean’s gonna call this an overall win. He stays in the kitchen a little while longer to help with other miscellaneous tasks and he lets Bobby bark orders at him until things feel back to normal.
He resists the urge to run after Cas and apologize, or maybe ask for his phone number, or both, but he can’t. The guy clearly has a family. Besides, it’s possible he’s simply misreading the whole thing. He feels like he has a connection with Cas, but maybe Dean’s just desperate. Sam has told him as much recently, anyway. How long has it been since he’s gotten any action? Two months? Three? Yeah, that’s probably it. He just needs a good roll in the hay and he’ll stop obsessing over some guy he’s met all of two times now. Okay, so it’s decided. He’s going out tonight.
. He learned his lesson after a windstorm swept through a few months back. The dirt and debris were hell to clean.
Dean intends to give Cas one of his devastatingly disarming grins. He means to flirt and to lay on all his Winchester charm, but it comes out all wrong. He feels soft and shy and awkward and... what is wrong with him?! If his awkwardness is obvious, at least Cas pays no attention to it.
Dean takes a moment to survey the rest of him. He’s got a scruffy beard that’s at least a week or two old, dirt on his nose, and discoloration around his left cheekbone and under the eye. He looks like he’s seen better days, but his eyes still shine brighter than anyone’s Dean has ever seen. It momentarily makes his brain stutter to a halt as he takes in the man standing before him, but he recovers quickly.
“Castiel and Sebastian? That’s quite the set of names.” Dean says Castiel’s name slowly and enjoys the way it rolls off his tongue. It’s different and unique, pleasant. Castiel stares directly back at him and swallows before answering.
The two of them are seated before the other man speaks again. “Thank you. I don’t know what I would have done if I had lost him.” He looks so relieved that Dean wonders for a moment if he’s going to cry.
Dean doesn’t think about the nearly healed bruise on his cheek, either. It must have been one hell of a shiner, something Dean knows a thing or two about.
Before turning the corner, Dean lifts his head to throw a final glance down the aisle. He catches Cas looking back at him and their eyes meet. Dean smiles and walks away with his heart in his throat.
“Nice to officially meet you, Steve. So, what brings you out here? You a tourist?” Although he thinks he knows the answer, he’s not going to assume the guy’s a vagrant. Maybe he’s just a lonely passerby. Or he’s lost. Or he’s any number of other things.
“Not really,” the guy answers with a jerky shrug of his shoulders, eyes never leaving the window. He doesn’t elaborate and opens his book as if he’s about to read it, effectively ending the conversation before it really begins.
Just outside of his view, he senses another’s presence and his world grows inexplicably calm as the storm continues to rage around him. Without seeing him, Dean is aware that the dark haired man in the long coat - the one he’s seen before in dreams past - is there with him, and Dean innately knows that he is safe.
“Hey, Dean-o! This is Katie, and her very lovely friend here is Stacy. We’re going to go hit the bar up for another round, I think you should join us!” Dean is pulled abruptly from his thoughts by a petite arm slung around his shoulder. A wave of blonde hair falls in front of his face as the scent of flowery perfume momentarily disorients him. He takes a second to push the hair out of his face and come back to his senses, looking up to find Ash grinning like an idiot.
Bagyo Bay is a small community nestled right on the rocky coastline and tucked away from the bigger cities in this part of the state. It’s quaint and beautiful and old and charming. The drive there can be described in much the same way, long and winding and full of trees until they eventually give way to rocky cliffs and scenic bluffs. About ten minutes outside of San Seton, the main city road comes to a ‘T’ and Dean takes a right, letting his wheels rumble over the worn asphalt of the coastal road as it weaves in and out along the bay. It’s a drive that requires patience and demands attention, not just for it’s curves, but for its views.
The truck sits under a rectangular tin shelter that provides shade for most hours of the day, but it’s an open structure and exposed on all four sides, which means it’ll be mostly useless if the wind picks up and the rain comes in sideways. The exterior of the truck can get wet, of course, but there are some windows that still need replacing, and he has no desire to clean the interior…
“I’ll take a clam chowder and a tri-tip sandwich. Actually…” Dean doesn’t know what he’s doing until the words are out, “...make it two of each, please. And two waters.”
“I’m Dean, by the way.” He sticks out his hand for a handshake before his thoughts get the best of him, and the stranger shakes back with a firm grip and long, strong fingers.
Dean gets nervous as he approaches, second guessing his instinct to order a second meal, but Dean is good at this sort of thing - talking to strangers, turning on the charm and strumming up a conversation - he doesn’t always like it, but he’s good at it.
Dean glares at him, but then lets himself be led to the bar by a very excited, if somewhat wobbly, Stacy. As he’s following Ash, he sees in his peripheral Jo and Jess heading back towards Sam. Well, this night isn’t going as expected.
When the night eventually winds down, Dean is still too drunk to drive home. Jo crashes in one of the spare bedrooms and Dean is about to do the same, but he honestly just wants to sleep in his own bed tonight. It’s been a long week and he’s desperate for a hot shower, to sleep naked, and to enjoy the simple thrill of turning off all his alarms. Luckily, Jess stopped drinking awhile ago and didn’t hit the hard stuff (probably still too squeamish from her hangover from hell last month), so she offers to drop him off on the way to her and Sam’s place.
“Okay. Woah. You’re both assholes, you know that?” Dean acts offended, but there is no heat in his words and he nearly cracks a smile despite his best effort to look angry. Anyway, Ash isn’t exactly wrong. It
“Well, actually, they hired me on as an editor, but I don’t want to get away from my writing, so I asked to take on some journalism assignments as well. This is my first one.” Cas is shy, but Dean can also sense the pride he possesses in mentioning his career.
“Well look at that, that’s some pretty epic timing,” Dean beams. “I just finished up here and looks like those clouds did, too.”
He takes a deliberate sip from his mug while he walks back into the shop and Dean knows damn well he’s not going to see that cup of coffee unless he gets it himself.
Dean mingles with the crowd, helping out when and where he can. He doesn’t have an official job to perform at the restaurant tonight, but being the natural charmer that he is, he mostly stays at the front and welcomes the guests alongside the host. Considering that Bobby and Ellen are the two people who raised him and his brother after their parents died when they were young, he’d do just about anything he could to give them something back, so if he can spend his Saturday night being their errand boy and helping to ease the stress if only a little, he damn well will. It’s the same reason that Sam is here with his girlfriend, Jess, even though he should probably be home studying for his upcoming Bar Exam, having recently graduated from Stanford Law School.
because he didn’t want anyone losing their cool over it. The nervous tension was difficult enough to deal with, and no one needed the added pressure of knowing they were being watched by a journalist from such a prestigious publication; however, in this moment, Dean is worried that perhaps he made a mistake in keeping Cas’s identity under wraps. Ellen has such a familial quality about her that Dean wonders if maybe her easygoing approach to customers might come off as a bit unprofessional to someone like a food critic. Do they frown upon that? Will the Roadhouse lose points because of it? Wait. Is the judging process even based off points? Shit. Maybe he should have told someone.
Before long, the downpour eases up and as if by magic, the clouds begin to clear and the sky brightens.
Alright, so Castiel is a man a few words. Dean can accept this challenge. It’s not like there’s anything keeping Castiel rooted to the sand and he doesn’t seem annoyed, so Dean keeps going.
“Anyway, Cas, it was good to see you and thanks again for the amazing review. I’ll let the family know that I was able to thank you in person, they’ll be happy to hear it.” As he speaks, he notices that Cas has a confused look on his face, and a slight tilt of the head makes it look like he’s thinking. Jesus, Dean needs to get the fuck out of here. He makes his move to turn around back to his cart and step away when Cas’s firm hand grabs him at the elbow to get his attention.
“I was considering that as one of my options. Now I’m disappointed that I didn’t go with my gut instinct when making my selection. I’ll most definitely have to come back to try it.” Cas looks down with a shy half-smile on his face and Dean can’t tell if he’s embarrassed or maybe just nervous. It throws him off because wouldn’t someone who works as a food critic and has a career in journalism be a little more arrogant? No, that’s not the right word. Well, maybe it is, but it’s certainly not a word that belongs anywhere close to Cas. But shouldn’t he be more confident or opinionated? Dean doesn’t exactly know how these kinds of things work, but he definitely had an expectation and this wasn’t it.
Cas wipes his face with a napkin and sets his hands in his lap. “Yes, thank you very much. The food is delicious.”
Well, too late now. That’s done. He pays and then steps to the side and waits for his order to be called. Meanwhile, he looks back out at the bench and the man still sitting on it, and now that he's had the chance to take a longer look, Dean is sure it’s him, the guy’s backpack is at his feet. When his order is called, he thanks the woman behind the counter and takes both bags in hand, passing through the patio and heading for the other bench.
The cut wasn’t deep, but it stung like hornets under my skin; one hell of a spell. My vision doubled from the blow to the back of the head and I struggled to focus enough to fight back.
He continued with threading the bendy metal poles through loops to make up the framework of the nylon tent.
Shooting me a sideways glance before turning back to the beautiful woman he answered with a smirk, “A bit moody.”
The small Latina woman shot up from her chair and nearly dove head-first into a filing cabinet. After a moment she withdrew two files and slapped them down on the desk before us. Nervously running her fingers through her hair once more she explained, “I already told you a little bit about the victims Thomas Waithe and Gail Heavensby, both went missing, then turned up dead from blunt force trauma, and both had on weird collars.”
Picking up his pistol, she tucked it into her waistband before closing in on the Winchester. Without warning, she balled her hand into a fist and jabbed it into the bridge of his nose. He staggered back, trying to clear the stars from his vision. She followed, grabbing him by the collar with one hand while the other started patting him down. Dazed, he didn’t react fast enough before she found the pouch of contraband in his pocket.
I followed Sam out silently. After shutting the door, I started toward the car and said determinedly, “If we’re going to get anywhere with this we need to divide and conquer.”
Castiel fast forwarded until twenty minutes had passed. The figure emerged once again, their head down as they hurried in the direction of the parking lot out front. After a few minutes, a hatchback vehicle backed up to the door. The figure opened the trunk before disappearing inside. Ten more minutes passed before the door was flung open. The person dragged Maggie’s unconscious body with a lot of difficulty and stuffed her in. After laying a tarp over her clumsily, they closed up and strode around to the driver’s side.
“I was scared,” I answered, every delirious blink of my eyes lasting for what felt like minutes. “Of a lot of things.”
The Sherriff’s energy shifted as soon as the words left dean’s mouth. It intensified alongside his anger. His scent was unmistakably Beta. High-ranking. Dean’s body reacted almost immediately. As did the Deputy’s. She barred her teeth and tipped her chin toward her chest exposing her neck submissively. Dean made a small noise in his throat as an intense shiver trickled down his spine; a mix of fear and anticipation. But not one to lose a coward’s game, Dean forced himself to remain as strong as possible and stared down his nose at the Sherriff defiantly.
Satisfied, Brady turned to Sam, and threw a chummy arm around his shoulder, “To our late-bloomer, Mr. Winchester! Congratulations on making it through to the
Trying to ignore the stone of anxiety that suddenly dropped into his gut, he stiffened the arm that Jessica clung to and put on a face that said, ‘I may not be presented, but she’s mine’.
Rummaging around in the tight space that was his kitchen, he returned shortly with two commemorative mugs from civil war reenactment sites. Nodding in thanks I took a small sip and was pleasantly surprised that the bitter liquid, despite being absent of cream or sugar, was a velvety dark roast. A desire to polish off the cup washed over me, but with a tinge of disappointment I set the cup down on his coffee table and turned to him.
Without warning, the potted plant next to us started sprouting at an alarming rate. Thick vines shot out and went straight for my tiny body. A sharp whine of surprise was crushed from me as I was tangled up.
The older man heard the truth in Dean’s words and relaxed. After a moment Dean hollered over to the bartender for a round of whiskeys for the table. Joseph nodded his head in appreciation. Neither spoke while they waited for their drinks. When she poured Dean’s, he muttered for her to leave the bottle and handed her another dollar. Mildly surprised, she pocketed the money obligingly.
Knowing where this was going, Dean let his head fall back and moaned. Castiel was completely taken. He’d never seen the older Winchester like this before. And he was the one eliciting such responses.
“I’m going to change.” I said, not looking forward to avoiding another confrontation with him. “We’ll talk about a game plan when we come out.”
Sam beat me to conscious land and was already going over a couple hardbacks we kept in the trunk to see if there was anything useful while he waited for me to rise. Checking my watch, I saw that it was a little after eight in the morning. Yawning, I slumped into my chair and muttered a hoarse greeting. He was too engrossed in his pages to make any sort of acknowledgement. But just then my phone started ringing. Unfamiliar caller ID; had to be either Floyd or that guy from the visitor center.
“Shut up,” I mumbled angrily, trying desperately not to think about the argument I’d had with Sam back at the campsite. “He and I are a team! We always will be!”
They had to go. Dean knew the law would be on them soon. Someone would figure out one of these people was missing. Not to mention there was the bastard responsible for this massacre. He was out there. And he knew who Sam was, where to find him, and how to make him hurt.
“I’ll go talk to Gail’s family,” I continued, the image of Mr. Waithe’s red-rimmed eyes conjuring fresh feelings of empathy and anger. “You should see what Joel Brown has to say.”
I was too caught up in mauling Gertie that I didn’t see when Ivan rolled over and fired. The shot was impressive. Went right over Cas’ shoulder and caught Gertie in the center of her forehead. I staggered away and saw the look of surprise frozen on her face. And then she crumpled into a pile on the floor.
I came out of it enough to sneak out and hunt down a liquor store. When I got back, Sam scolded me for leaving without telling him. I just ignored him and gruffly asked for his side of the story from back in the woods.
Touching the cut with the tips of his fingers, Ivan pulled them away and stared down at the bright red like he was annoyed. Giving me a stern look, he grumbled, “I’ve had worse.”
Smirking in mock disbelief he shook his head and held up a free hand. I tossed the keys at him which he caught deftly. As he got into the driver’s seat, I let my own smile fall.
Couldn’t really escape Sam though. Even as I pressed my forehead harder and harder against the cool glass of the window to will myself asleep, I could sense the questions building up between us. The car was silent aside from the familiar hum of the engine as we headed south. Hours passed. Somewhere around Olympia, Washington my brother finally worked up the courage to ask softly, “Seriously, what happened back in Diablo?”
Whispers as faint and indistinct as a breeze reached my ears. It didn’t seem to come from anywhere in particular, and yet it was all around me. I whipped around; gun ready. A chill swept down my spine like someone or something had run their finger along its length. I stiffened, waiting for the inevitable attack. Instead, something warm and wet plopped onto my cheek. Startled, I reached up. Pulling my fingers away I saw blood.
Sam would never say that his brother was a worrier – stubborn maybe – but not one to fret. So, to see the faint trace of thinly veiled fear in his eyes came as a bit of a surprise. Still it wasn’t enough to sway him. Not when it was all too much trouble. John and Dean Winchester were bad news. Rubbing at the stubble on his jaw, Sam found that he still couldn’t tell his brother to get back on his horse and leave, despite knowing he should.
Setting the bottle down on the Pepto-Bismol pink counter of the tiny kitchenette out of my reach, he sat in the only other chair opposite me, scraping the worn wooden legs along the linoleum. Damnit. Why did he have to give me that freaking look of his? It always reminded me of Sammy, when he’d try and get me to open up about the particularly gruesome stuff I’d seen with Dad on the road in the early days.
“I’ve always wanted something to snuggle with while I slept,” the Empty added, making eye contact with me over Jack’s shoulder.
Throwing a look to Jack out the window, he acknowledged the signal by giving us one last nod and raised his hand. In front of the doors of the garage, inky black bubbled out of nowhere and expanded. The song started up just as the portal opened as wide as the Impala to reveal the expanse of nothing beyond. Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song. I could feel the base in my bones as the speakers vibrated with the sound.
As he stood, hands shaking at his sides, Sam felt as if flames radiated from his skin. Dean noticed and took a step back on instinct, not fully understanding why. Sam followed, reaching out to grasp at his brother possessively.
I chewed the inside of my cheek, struggling with one half of me calling for blood and the other half wanting to walk away like I did last night. I ended up sitting there, fuming quietly and glaring off into the woods. It wasn't like I didn't talk to him. I'd gotten a lot better over the years. All the traveling together kind of forced me to. But there were still some topics that I just couldn't go near.
Sam kept getting further and further ahead. I called out to him at one point, telling him to wait up, but for some reason he couldn’t hear me. Gripping at my leg as flashes of white-hot pain stabbed up from my ankle, I tried once again to stop him. But in an instant, the yawning darkness had swallowed him up.
“Maxine. Maxine Byers.” She huffed. Faintly, I could pick up another voice in the background that sounded annoyed. After a moment she continued, “You and I worked that witch doctor case in New Orleans.”
I paused. Cas knew Dean almost as well as I did. He knew the answer to that question. All three of us were experts when it came to getting the job done regardless of what was going on personally. Castiel locked eyes with me and I could see the silent question there; the real one.
Sam smirked and stepped over to Castiel. “Would you mind getting him in bed? Maybe getting him to drink some water too?”
The three of us looked over at Jack who was happy to see that we weren’t hurt. He mouthed for us to go, and I did just that. All of us would rush in only to be teleported back to where we started.
I crossed the distance between us at a sprint. Our chests collided. I held him tightly as my momentum turned us in a full circle.
The eldest Winchester glanced over to his saddlebag on Baby like he may have something there that could help. Tipping back the brim of his hat, he grinned and said, “Got some shiny badges just like they do.”
“I can’t.” Before he can pull them back, the words fly out of his mouth much more harshly than he intended, but Cas
“Well I’m glad you ended up here.” As soon as the words are out, the embarrassment squeezes tight around his shoulders . He looks down at his feet and brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck, willing away the blush he feels pulse hot on his cheeks. Cas is silent and still, and Dean feels the weight of Cas’s gaze like a heavy blanket, holding him secure but unrestricted.
Stunned, but yet not surprised by Ash’s tactics, he looks to Sam for help. Sam, the little bitch, has a smirk on his face and has the audacity to say, “You kids go have fun, I’ll hold down the table.”
Dean makes it ten minutes before the worry finally overtakes him and he can no longer ignore it or reason it away. He’s gripping the steering wheel far more tightly than necessary and the nagging feeling beating against the inside of his chest is too much. It’s as though a physical force is tugging him back to the marina.
Before he can make an attempt to rectify it, Cas is already making his exit. “Yes, well, thanks again for your hospitality - I should be going now. I don’t want to take up any more of your time.” There’s an annoyed tilt to his response and Dean secretly berates himself for causing it.
He should do something. The poor guy is alone and no one is bothering to help him. Dean stands up and walks towards him.
Cas’s eyes search his, looking for honesty behind his words. Cas must find what he’s looking for because after a beat, he agrees.
“No reason. He stopped by the shop just as I was closing up and thought he might’ve been headed this way, is all.” It’s mostly true.
“Aw man, listen to this. I flew in late last night and called Ellen first thing this morning to ask her to put me on the schedule as soon as possible... I was here an
They head inside and since it’s already quite late, the few larger tables are taken. Jo spots a small table in the corner that has been recently vacated, so they make their way over, Jo and Jess taking the only two stools available. It’s no matter, Dean won’t be sticking around for long anyway, he has other plans and his gaze immediately starts scanning the crowd for potential candidates.
Dean watches him leave and cleans up the remainder of the trash, tossing it into a nearby trash can. The wind blows and a shiver runs from his feet up through his spine, reminding him that he needs to get home and soon. He pops the collar on his leather jacket and pulls it tight around him. The temperature feels like it just dropped several degrees and he quickly jogs to his car, eager to escape the cold.
“Thanks again, for finding Seb.” Castiel stands up straight after gathering his shoes and looks at Dean, offering his hand for another handshake.
“I have a couch,” he offers. Steve goes still. “Back at my place in San Seton, next to the same auto repair shop I work at.” Silence. “And if you need to be back here in Bagyo, I can drive you back once the storm clears.” More silence. “Is that okay?”
Dean watches her go and when he turns back again to face Cas, he’s got a slight but fond grin on his face. “She’s lovely.”
Their eyes linger on one another in a way that anyone else would describe as awkward, but Dean can’t bring himself to look away. Did Castiel just lean in closer to him? Nah. This has to all be in Dean’s head. The sun must be getting to him. He’s probably dehydrated. This guy is a total stranger who has a girlfriend - and it’s definitely a girlfriend (not a wife) because a quick glance at Castiel’s left hand shows no ring, and Castiel seems like the kind of guy who would want to do the whole commitment thing. Dean doesn’t dare question why that thought crosses his mind, but he feels like he just knows this information somehow.
“Mind if I sit?” The man doesn’t respond verbally, but he scoots himself over on the bench, making room for Dean next to him. “I’m the guy from yesterday. From the auto repair shop?” he says.
The man looks up and his eyes go wide in recognition, quickly turning from surprise to confusion as he looks at Dean and then behind him, as if to decipher where Dean appeared from and how.
Bobby huffs out an annoyed grunt. “Well, since you’re so insistent on fixing that old piece of junk, make sure you put the tarp on her… and tie it down
“Hey, don’t worry about it. See that golden lab he’s playing with? That one belongs to me. Your dog came up to us not long before I saw you. Looks like they’re friends now.” The dogs still haven’t stopped their game of chase.
“He really doesn’t seem like he has a care in the world, does he?” The man makes an annoyed huff but cracks half of a smile as he shakes his head and, with it, Dean can see that last bit of tension leave his body. Dean is finally getting a better look at him now, and damn, the guy is attractive. He’s wearing all the wrong things for a day at the beach, but that doesn’t stop Dean from noticing the toned biceps under the fitted shirt, or the strong jawline underneath a hint of day-old stubble, or the immensely blue eyes reflecting the ocean right back at him. The air leaves his lungs and he blinks a few times to bring it back.
He takes a few more minutes to finish his beer. Before he leaves, he catches Benny’s eye and gives him a nod from across the room, not daring to tempt Ellen’s patience considering he doesn’t yet know Ash’s fate. He flashes a twenty-dollar bill and puts it on the counter with a flirtatious wink, placing his empty bottle on top, and then he’s out the door.
Dean fondly watches as Ellen attempts to fix the collar on Bobby’s dress shirt while he grumbles in the corner about having to “get all gussied up.” He smiles at his adoptive parents and could not be more proud of all they have accomplished. The night is still young and as he surveys the area, he’s already overwhelmed at the supportive turnout.
“Well I’m glad he was out making friends while I was losing my mind shouting his name.” The sarcastic tone makes Dean chuckle.
“Yes, okay. I’d like that..” Cas finally breathes out and Dean feels a weight lifted at the change in his demeanor. He still looks a little stunned, but Dean will absolutely take that over seeing disappointment and hurt in Cas’s eyes. One look at his face like that and Dean knows with all the certainty in the world that it’s a face he never wants to see again.
He strolls along the shoreline taking in the scenery, his brother’s big, goofy dog in tow. Actually, she’s not so much “in tow” as she is running around in the general vicinity. This is why Dean likes the off-leash dog beaches the best; there’s just something wrong about bringing a dog to a beach and not allowing her to run free, chase tennis balls, or splash in the water. He isn’t even particularly fond of dogs, or so he says, but he’s not a monster. Besides, it’s basically free entertainment and exercise for the pup with minimal effort on his part (and if she’s so worn out that she sleeps the rest of the day and doesn’t bother him, he’s not going to complain).
“Yeah. I told you I couldn’t eat it all on my own, didn’t I? I love food and all, but even I have my limitations.” Dean throws a satisfied smile towards Steve.
Suddenly, Dean realizes that they are caught in another wordless moment that lasts just a tad longer than what seems normal. He snaps himself out of it as best he can. What is it with this guy that makes his mind wander and his heart race? Sure, he’s beautiful and interesting and somehow different than anyone Dean’s met in a very long time, but they’ve spoken all of two times. He needs to reel it in.
“Sorry baby, no. But listen, I gotta get going. Ash just walked in the door and that boy better have gotten to the bank on time or so help me…”
“Yeah. That’s a good idea. I’ll call an Uber and then come back tomorrow to pick up my car.” It seems that Sam is also only just realizing the state he’s in.
Aside from the gorgeous coastline, the road into and through Bagyo is speckled with shops and restaurants, all local, no recognizable corporate chains or flashy signs, just small establishments, mostly all family owned and operated. One of his absolute favorite places is a short way off the main road and right on the water. It’s a small hole-in-the-wall joint at the marina where several sailboats and small fishing vessels are anchored, and it serves the greatest clam chowder Dean has ever tasted. On a good day, the line is out the door and around the corner, full of locals and outsiders alike.
“No. You won’t. You’ll get soaked and you’ll freeze. This storm that’s coming in ain’t a joke, and I know I’m a total stranger and if you want me to drop you off someplace where you feel safe, that’s fine. Just let me take you somewhere. Anywhere that has a roof, at least.”
“Aww, come on, Ellen. He’s your best employee and you know it. Why you gotta bust his balls like that?”
Dean looks up to find Cas, standing just a little too closely and encroaching upon his personal space. His first instinct is to take a step back and put some distance between them, but he finds that his feet stay firmly planted. Maybe he’s thrown off balance a little, too, because he even leans in towards Cas ever so slightly. Dean gets himself in check. Their eyes lock.
The next morning Dean gets to the shop a little early, the optimism of it being a Friday providing a natural levity to the day, even before the coffee kicks in. He usually works on Saturdays, but Bobby gave him the weekend off. Technically, he always has Sunday off, but it’s nice to add a work-free Saturday to the rotation for once. San Seton is a small enough town that many businesses are still closed on Sundays, but it’s a tradition that’s fading fast. Bobby, however, being the old stubborn man that he is, refuses to give way to
Aside from whatever noises Jess is making, the ride is silent for all of two minutes before Sam speaks up. “So. Did you really turn down that Stacy girl?”
Dean turns to look at the man and he takes in the wild, dark hair, the strong jaw, and the ocean blue eyes…
Bobby, of course, understands that tonight is a big deal, hell, his life’s savings is tied up entirely with the Roadhouse’s success, but he’s always been one to feel uncomfortable in anything fancier than old jeans and a baseball cap. If it were up to him, he’d choose to remain unseen tonight, either helping in the kitchen or working in the small upstairs office they had built above the bar, but Ellen would never let him get away with hiding on a night like tonight.
“Nah. Not tonight. Supposed to be a pretty intense couple of weeks though. This was only the beginning,” Dean answers, carefully trying to read the guy’s expressions.
“I’m originally from Kansas. I moved out here several years ago when my brother decided to make California his permanent home. After he left Kansas, there really wasn’t anything to keep me there, and besides, who could say no to palm trees, beaches, bikinis, and year-round sunny weather, right?” He flashes a smile at Castiel, hoping that sharing a bit of himself will encourage him to open up. To his disappointment, Castiel’s face seems to close off and the grin that had been lingering fades away. He pulls his legs up to his chest and hugs them with his left arm while his chin rests on top of his knees, and he begins to draw random shapes into the sand with his right hand. Dean isn’t sure what to do, but then Castiel speaks.
It’s too chilly to drive with the windows down, but he does it anyway, relishing in the sting of the wind at his face. He’s headed towards Bagyo Bay, his favorite place on the planet (well, at least of all the places he’s been, which actually isn’t many). San Seton is only about a thirty five minute drive from the ocean, twenty seven if he guns it, and the closer he gets to the water, the more the smell of the salty air relaxes him even as the air grows colder.
An hour later, Dean heads back over to the table where Jo is arm wrestling some guy and Sam looks to be half holding Jess up to make sure she doesn’t fall off her stool as she laughs at Jo’s trash talking. Jo wins and as she’s celebrating her victory, the guy passes Dean while headed back towards the bar, presumably to buy her the drink that she undoubtedly wagered. He’s about to make a snarky comment when Jo beats him to it.
Finally, Ellen stands up from her chair, sniffles, wipes her hands on the front of her jeans like she doesn’t know what to do with them, and says; “Well, that was all very nice, but I think I’ve got to get to work now.”
“Hiya, Cas! Fancy meeting you here.” Castiel’s eyes flare wide at the moment of recognition, and Dean feels proud of himself for remembering his name; it doesn’t matter that he’s had the guy’s face in his mind since they walked away from one another at the beach, no one needs to know that part, but
He appears to be standing in an abandoned home as a hurricane-like storm whirls and thunders around him. The room he’s in is unfamiliar and he doesn’t recognize his surroundings. The walls shake and the windows rattle and, save for an occasional flash of lightning, the world is shrouded in darkness. He hears shouting, but he cannot make out the words. Suddenly, as if by magic, a ring of fire appears on the floor in front of him and a figure stands inside of it - powerful, menacing, and fearsome.
Dean isn’t sure how to respond. He assumes the dude is talking about the clouds, but something ever so slightly tugs at his chest, telling him that maybe those words aren’t about the storm at all.
Dean found the truck abandoned on the side of a backroad about half a year ago, and after local law enforcement ran the VIN number and contacted the owner, the guy told Dean he could have her so long as he didn’t have to deal with getting her towed and Dean covered all the expenses, including the transfer of registration fees. By that evening, she was hauled to the back lot of
“No, no. Not mine…” Dean cuts him off, not wanting Cas to worry, “...but I do know the owners. They’re family. I’m just here lending a hand, but I don’t work here in any official capacity.” Dean sees Cas let out a relieved breath. “Why don’t I show you to your seat?”
“Could that be the little guy you’re looking for?” Dean points to where the two dogs are sprinting through the shallow tide chasing each other, stopping to jump and paw at one another before the chase begins again. The guy peers out at the beach and Dean knows exactly when he recognizes his own dog because his shoulders relax and he breathes out a heavy sigh. He then bends at the waist, puts his hands on his knees, and drops his head in relief. “Come on, man. Why don’t you have a seat - you look like you could use a breather.”  Dean pats him on the back and leads them further away from the shore where they can sit in the sand without getting wet.
Dean might have done a little research to find out that the blog posts it’s content at about five in the morning. It’s just after six, which means Dean has spent nearly an hour forcing himself not to cheat and look at it before anyone else has the chance. They had all agreed to look at the article at the same time and his skin is buzzing with anticipation.
Bobby doesn’t understand why Dean’s going through all the effort of restoring the F-150, and he’s said as much time and again. He grumbled and griped when Dean brought her to the garage, but after some shameless pleading, Bobby ultimately allowed him to make space at the shop for her - Bobby really is a big ol’ softy at heart, but he’d kill anyone for saying so.
San Seton is a quiet, quirky little town where hippy meets midwest, a rural community a couple hours north of San Francisco. It’s a far cry from the city life, but it’s not quite the country, either. Around here, everyone sorta knows everyone else, but folks tend to keep to themselves. It’s where Dean’s done most of his growing up, and if Bobby were to say anything about it, it’s where he’s still got some growing up left to do.
Over the sounds of the storm building outside, Steve speaks for the first time since leaving Bagyo Bay. “I didn’t realize. You said there was a storm coming but… I didn’t realize.” His voice is wrought with regretful awe.
By the time he gets back, Steve is nowhere to be seen, so Dean drives along the back road, the one Steve had been walking down. It only takes a few more minutes of driving before Dean spots him, still walking alongside the road. He slows his car and carefully pulls up next to him, rolling down the passenger side window.
, and Bobby’s been complaining about her ever since. But it’s no matter because Dean’s proud of the work he’s done with her. The truck was undriveable, useless, and barely worth the scrap parts holding it together, but all Dean could see was potential. And now? Well, now he’s nearly ready to drive her off the lot thanks to his own two hands. He has absolutely no clue what he’s going to do with her when he’s done (another point that Bobby’s made on several occasions), but he’ll figure it out. He knows he will.
With a small weight of disappointment tugging at his chest, he scans the room looking for Ellen. Now that he’s lent his hand in the kitchen, he might as well find out if she could use him for anything. It only takes a few seconds before he spots her. She’s near the front doors and, to Dean’s surprise, Cas is standing with her. He’s smiling, but there is something slightly forced about it, reserved. The air in the room seems to shift and Dean can feel his pulse beat a few times against his cheeks. It’s a strange sensation, but along with it comes an unexplained urge to reach out to Cas, to make sure he’s okay. Nothing seems particularly wrong or urgent, but he feels the need to be sure.
As she exits the door and he calls out his goodbye, he notices a man standing on the opposite side of the street. It’s
After running through the morning routine and before switching on the neon ‘OPEN’ sign, he hurries out back to check the truck for water damage, not that he expects any. It wasn’t much of a storm last night, more like a quick downpour before it moved on, but another, much larger surge is expected to hit sometime tonight. He’s reinforcing some knots when he’s interrupted.
Cas can’t just casually ask him for a beer while Dean’s practically having a meltdown. He can’t ask for Dean’s company while mentioning his girlfriend in the same damn sentence. Maybe if they were friends first, but they aren’t, not really. If that’s what Cas is trying to do - to be friends - then fine, but Dean isn’t even sure he can do that.
is a magazine dedicated to reviewing all the hottest spots up and down Southern California. It’s also renowned for its associated food blog. A good review with this magazine and blog is basically the holy grail of approval stamps and all but guarantees a successful opening simply due to its mass amount of followers. Dean knows that Jo and Ash specifically sent the publication an invite, but no one actually expected them to send someone and, of course, Dean is even more surprised that that someone is Cas.
The sky has really opened up now, and the rain is coming down in droves as the wind pushes it slantways. It’s an ominous sight, the late afternoon dark with thunderclouds lining the sky as far as he can see. The news reports have all said that this storm is just the beginning of what promises to be an incredibly strong storm season. The weather has been abnormally mild the past few years, so Dean supposes it’s well past due.
“Here we are, best seat in the house!” Dean pulls out Cas’s chair and he accepts, dropping his shoulder bag down next to him.
“Okay. Alright. It’ll be fine. I’ll help you look. What does your dog look like?” Dean’s problem solving instincts kick in and he immediately gets into leader-mode.
“I didn’t know until tonight, okay? Like I said, we briefly met at the dog beach when he thought he had lost his dog. It’s not like we shared our life stories. After we recognized each other and I found out about his day job, I figured it would be best not to spread the information until after he was gone - you know how Jo and Ellen can get. They didn’t need the extra pressure tonight.”
“What?!” Sam lurches forward in his seat, nearly knocking Jessica off his shoulder. He sits back and readjusts her, lowering his voice. “Are you kidding me, Dean? You didn’t think to share that with the class?”
He doesn’t know how to tell Sam that instead of fantasizing about sleeping around, he’s been fantasizing about settling down in a three bedroom house with a porch and a big kitchen. He can’t tell him that he daydreams about waking up next to someone on a lazy Sunday morning and sipping coffee in bed with legs tangled together. Even more so, he can’t imagine trying to explain to Sam that those fantasies have come into clearer focus ever since he met some random, dark-haired guy on the beach and that now, when he closes his eyes and envisions the life he wants for himself, he imagines that the body laying next to him is tall and muscular, and that the man sharing his bed has a deep voice and eyes as blue as the ocean.
Dean can tell Sam a thousand times over that Lisa doesn’t matter to him anymore, but what he doesn’t know how to tell Sam is that he’s… well, he’s
“Are you trying to hit on me, Winchester? Is this your play? Take Sam and Jess home and then make your move? I see you.” Jo takes two fingers and points directly at Dean’s eyes with a look that’s supposed to be intimidating but only makes both Sam and Jess giggle again.
It’s clean and crisp outside, and although the night promises to be chilly and perfect for watching a movie in bed, Dean decides to take advantage of the fresh air and the rejuvenated energy he feels with it. He turns right and, sticking his hands in the pockets of his jacket, he heads towards The Roadhouse. As he walks the short distance, he can’t help but wonder where his stranger went. Not
The article continues to overflow with sophisticated praise and rounds out on a beautiful note about Ellen’s
The article begins with a basic description of the restaurant - the location, the front entrance, the constructional and design layouts - the boring stuff. As Dean continues to read, however, his heart rate picks up a beat. He tries not to fidget and to maintain his composure as he reads on, Castiel’s words explaining that
face.” Sam leans in to lick the tip of her nose, and that’s when Dean realizes that Sam’s face is red and he’s definitely had more to drink than Dean realized.
Dean doesn’t really know what to say to that, so he looks back out towards the dogs still playing in the water and leans back, resting his weight on his wrists as he enjoys the feel of the sun on his face and the company of his new companion. A minute or so passes when he decides to speak again.
. “...I’m a teacher and my students were working on their final projects this week. I was helping some of them and I guess I may have gotten a little too enthusiastic. Thanks for the heads up, though. I’ve been walking around like this all damn day.” Dean continues to rub at his ear, hoping he’s getting all the paint off and not actually making it worse.
Dean is caught so completely off guard that had he not been able to control the flinch that jerks his body to attention, he would have swerved his car right off the road.
a sure thing, alright? But I wasn’t, apparently.” There’s a beat of silence as Jo takes in what he said. “Besides, you didn’t even find anyone for me, did you?” Jess snorts a laugh and nearly falls off the stool. Sam is there to catch her and he manages to look annoyed yet amused at the same time.
“Uh… I just, um…” The man is caught off guard and unsure of himself. He finally glances up and Dean’s eyes meet his for the first time and holy shit.
“Nah, you’re not an idiot. You clearly care a great deal about Charlie and little Seb, is all” and before he can stop himself, he adds, “and they are obviously very lucky to have you.” Once again, Cas looks at him with a mix of uncertainty, as though he’s weary of Dean approaching some imaginary line that indicates he’s about to cross into a territory that’s too personal.
They exchange numbers and after a few additional minutes of pleasant conversation, the two of them finally part ways. Dean grabs that handle of Jack without another thought and heads for the checkout line. Cas continues down the aisle in the opposite direction to pick out some wine for his girlfriend.
There is a silence that settles between them then. Neither of them knowing exactly what to say next, but yet they don’t make a move to walk away either. It’s Dean who breaks the silence first.
When the first drops of rain lightly tap the windshield, they’re still fifteen minutes from home. Within seconds the small, inconsistent droplets give way to large, heavy pellets of rain that smack the windows in angry pelts. Steve sits up, eyes searching the sky. Then comes the first flash of lighting, eventually followed by several claps of thunder.
Seb makes a playful yelp, clearly unamused by the strange staring contest happening, and it proves to be a successful distraction. Castiel bends down to give Seb a pat on the head and takes a step back, away from Dean and in the direction from which he came.
“You got it. We’ll work the room.” And then they’re off to do whatever it is that they plan to do to be Dean’s wingwomen.
Steve finishes chewing his bite of sandwich before he answers, and Dean thinks he intentionally slows down, delaying his ability to respond. “Washington… state.” The reply is tentative, and Dean makes a mental note to tread carefully.
The wind screams and the rain bites sharp at his face, yet a faint warmth wraps around his shoulders, feeling like a blanket where there is none. It seems to be coming from the man next to him. Dean can’t explain it, but the force encircles and shelters him. He should be afraid. He should be running for cover or preparing to fight, but instead, he faces the furious, fiery power before him with tranquil assuredness. He is protected.
He dreams of a storm. There’s bright lightning and thunder strong enough to shake the earth beneath his feet and make his chest rumble. He doesn’t recognize where he is - some kind of shed, or maybe a barn. He hears more than he feels a rush of wind followed by a startling bang. The barn doors slam open and standing on the other side is a tall, dark haired man in a long coat. Dean can’t quite make out his face.
Her hands immediately released. She blinked as if she wasn’t sure what just came over her. Dean held back the urge to whine as the heat from her hands vanished. He immediately scolded himself for wanting to submit to his Omega instincts in this kind of a situation, but it didn’t change the fact that he was semi hard.
Shouting and cries of pain exploded from the room down the hall. I saw the fear in Dean’s eyes just as another one of his ribs cracked. It drove me crazy; rabid, even. I tore through the plant. My jaw ached from the effort. When I was free, I stood in front of the tree that had my brother and started looking for something to bite.
Without a word, Dean wrapped his fingers around Cas’ length. The dark-haired man gasped, one of his hands instantly going up to grip the shoulder with the mark he’d left. For a split second the hunter was afraid that it would be too foreign a sensation for him to handle. But then the soft skin on the shaft moved along with his grip. His did the same when he masturbated. Not so different.
“The man that interviewed you is a slippery son of a gun. I wouldn’t put it past him to capitalize on someone’s grief.” Dean continued; glad Sam wasn’t there to hear him.
By this time Sam and Dean were striding up like they belong there, tipping hats and being none-too-shy about flashing their badges on their chests.
A shock of apprehension ran through Sam suddenly, electrifying and chilling his core at the same time. He thought of Jessica waiting for him. Worried that he might not come back. This kind of
Still Jack. That was good. I smiled through the tears and watched as his body disappeared like it was being carried off on an intangible breeze.
The jangle of the keys rang out like church bells as I handed them over to Sam. Without even looking at him I could see the surprise on his face. Not wanting to keep Cas waiting any longer, Sam deftly hooked his finger through the key ring and lifted it from my palm. A second later and I was lowering myself into the passenger seat of the Impala, ignoring the incredulous look from my little brother.
After ducking inside a shifty looking pawn shop, I strode back to the Impala and noticed Castiel standing next to the hood of the car gazing unseeing in the direction of the ocean. It was turning into a grey day. Formless clouds spread across the sky, blocking out the warmth of the sun. It made the smaller man look paler than ever. I couldn’t help but think that the angel looked sad in this light, refreshing the deep sensation of guilt I knew both my brother and I shared.
Luckily Sam was able to escape without anyone spotting him. Looping around in the brush on the edge of town, he headed for the saloon. There he could hopefully find someone that could tell him where Joseph Welch lived, which would then hopefully lead to John. He was going to have to think about what to do for Dean.
“I don’t know,” Dean mumbled cautiously, not breaking the locked-on look between them. “I just…I need to adjust.”
Reality hit me like a truck. Warm hands on my shoulders suddenly slammed me into a different body. I could still feel the pain. But it faded with every gasp of air. I shot up, shoving at the chest of whoever loomed over me. Scrambling away, my back hit the headboard and I glanced in terror at the room I was in. Helena’s guest room.
Castiel took in a startled breath as he felt Dean’s tongue slip expertly into his mouth. Once again, the urge to pull away surfaced, but he was powerless to act on it. Not with Dean holding on to him and doing what he was doing with his mouth. After a moment though, Dean unlocked their lips. He pulled Castiel close enough that their foreheads touched and he breathed, “I don’t know when I started wanting you. But I do. Every day.”
Something primal and unfamiliar bubbled up inside. It was similar to what he had felt when he’d killed Constance. This time though, instead of glowing like the light of a candle, it was a blazing inferno. It hurt. But also felt good. Like something that had been missing from him his whole life had awakened.
. The blonde thought, frantically casting around in his mind for any and all ideas on how to do that.
It wasn’t a bad idea. On any other normal day, I would consider it, especially because he did know more about ancient languages. But the angel didn’t have a good track record with people and communication in general.
Again, silence. I avoided looking into his eyes unsure of whether he would be able to read my thoughts any more than he probably already had. Clenching my jaw, I kept my gaze trained on the cheap dime store shaded lamp on the low dresser across the room and asked, “Did Sam send you? I told him I’m fine, I – “
“Nothing. I don’t really socialize with them. Darren is quite the drinker. Likes to run his mouth at all hours; usually about unsavory topics. Katherine is abusive. No getting around it. She beats her husband and the poor bastard takes it to make sure the kid stays out of it.”
“Everything.” I said seriously, trying to convey how important it was for me to hear a full and honest account.
“Don’t worry. You just take care of yourself.” Jodie pressed the bag of sandwiches into my hand, leading the way to the front door.
After a moment, the flash of coin passed between them and the mysterious man strode purposefully toward the saloon. The younger Winchester was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice.
“Here we are!” Dean exclaimed, finally withdrawing his hand with what looked like a stack of tattered letters and newspaper clippings. Smoothing out a number of them on top of Sam’s saddle, he pointed at the topmost one.
Awesomelypathetic commented about triggers and I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure how to be aware of those. If anyone has any advice or articles I can read, please let me know! I wanna make sure y'all are comfortable!
The wing that curled around Dean looked charred and ripped to shreds. It instantly put into perspective just how traumatic falling from heaven must have been for him and the other angels. Castiel lay behind my brother, eyes closed, oblivious to the gruesome sight of his once magnificent mangled wings.
Sam finished getting his horse geared up and nodded to Dean silently to let him know he was ready to head out. Without missing a beat, Dean swung up into his saddle, tugging a letter out of his inside left breast pocket. He handed it over to Sam before steering Baby toward the road out of town, calling over his shoulder, “I hadn’t heard anything from him until I picked that up from the post office a couple days ago.”
“Perhaps I should go to the police station.” Castiel offered, breaking his long streak of silence. “I have more knowledge of sigils.”
“Cas has enough to worry about besides babysitting me.” I cut in, my voice losing some of its intensity as his bloody, choking face flashed into my mind. I attempted swallowing past the thickness that had formed in my throat, but that only made it more apparent. “You should have kept him out of this.”
Dean’s anger wilted a bit at that, but he still kept his serious hunting face on. After a moment he cleared his throat and addressed Castiel, “Will witch-killing bullets do the trick, or do we need something else for druids?”
He fell to his knees. A long howl of agony ripped from his chest as his brain sluggishly started processing the grotesque display.
Curious, I looked down his finger and saw a slightly blurry license plate. Dean shot me a triumphant grin, “Great, we just need to hack into the registration database and search for the owner’s name.”
Before he could say anything else, I limped past him, shoulder-checking as I did. He tried calling after me, telling me to wait, but thankfully he didn't follow. I disappeared down the gravel road away from the campsite, ignoring the pain in my leg.
The most surprising thing however, was how much fun it was to see another dog. As Dean and I passed her and her owner, we locked eyes. Immediately the big lab started pulling on her leash to get closer to me. I felt Dean tense up next to me, wondering if he was going to have to save me from getting eaten, but I just wagged my tail. The other dog was just as happy to see me too. I tried speaking to her a couple different ways. First with my mind, then with barks. She didn’t seem to understand. It only got her more excited.
Angling his body to block the pouch from being seen from the main thoroughfare, Sam hissed, “That’s against the law.”
I felt him lean toward my lower half and I flipped over in a panic, but he just gave me a confused look before reaching for my leg. Hovering his palm over my ankle, I watched as an intense light brightened his palm. Small granules of what looked like molten pearls drifted down and gradually, the pain dissipated. When he was done, I pushed myself into a sitting position and tested it. I relished the absence of the aching pain that had been there before.
Dean muttered comforting words as he strode across the parking lot. When he reached the door, he adjusted my body in his arms, unintentionally digging my newly re-formed shoulder into the crook of his arm. I whined in pain which caused the panic to return full-force to his eyes. He muttered an apology before striding through the door straight to the same blonde secretary from before.
“That’s what we’re here to find out.” Dean answered sarcastically. Sam immediately stomped on his foot. Suppressing a cry of pain, Dean shot Sam a look before adding, “
The level of honesty from the bartender surprised Dean and brought down his level of anger considerably. After a moment, he withdrew his billfold and slapped a dollar note down as thanks before downing the contents of his glass. Letting out a grunt of appreciation, he pushed off and sauntered over to the morose looking man slumped in the darkest corner of the saloon.
Her friend, Miss Rachel Barrow, brought up a handkerchief and rubbed the other’s back as she added, “It’s just…there’s been a number of folks that have gone missing recently. People talk.”
“Never mind,” I mumbled. Trying to change the subject I continued hurriedly, “So, back to his behavior before he ran off. Was Jacob saying or doing something in particular that struck you as out of the ordinary?”
Dean could only feel and hear the beating of his heart in his ears as he warily waited for Castiel to do something. His whole body was frozen with embarrassment. But Castiel didn’t notice. He seemed lost in his own world as he carefully trailed his fingers down Dean’s chest, leaving goosebumps in their wake. And then he was pushing against Dean’s jeans trying to get them off. Here Dean had the opportunity to back out, not that Cas was thinking of that. But it went through Dean’s mind.
The blonde glared over at the other for a moment. Finally, though, he decided to take the opportunity Sam was presenting him. Dean nodded.
He looked down at me in surprise, but after a brief once over of my attire he guessed who I might be. Swallowing hard he answered with a nod. Before I could start in on any questions, he held up his hand and said, “Listen man, I already told the police all I know.”
” it asked sarcastically, with a tinge of the disappointment Dad always sprinkled on everything he said. “
High pitched ringing in his ear muffled the outraged cries of the men around him. But with their pants down they couldn’t do much by way of counter attack. Dean circled his arms around the woman in a sort of morbid hug and fired once, twice, five more times, emptying the cylinder. Bodies thudded to the ground one by one, but Dean’s finger kept squeezing the trigger. When the shock and adrenaline started wearing off, he took in a few deep, shuddering breaths before pushing the woman’s dead body off. Trembling all over, he stood.
The brothers exchanged looks once again before taking their key and heading up the nearby flight of stairs. On the second-floor landing, Dean leaned in close and whispered to Sam, “There were only a couple keys missing, let’s check the rooms out, see which one good ol’ Burt was staying in.”
"Missing people goes on like that with one every decade. Usually lowlifes. Until we get to two weeks ago when three workers from the local construction site go missing one after the other.” Sam jumped in shaking his head.
It was almost enough to make me laugh if it wasn’t such a ridiculous idea…or if I could laugh. I settled for huffing and barking a bitter ‘no’.
For the first time in our lives Team Free Will was finally getting to make our own choices. And our first (and possibly last if it went bad) choice was going to be to save the angel. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
Dad had never been the same. One day he was playing with me in the backyard, the next he was wordlessly cleaning guns while I fed a crying baby Sam a bottle of lukewarm milk. He threw away everything. All for revenge. I’d been so young that I hadn’t understood what was happening. I just knew that the man I loved and idolized was slipping away. I did everything in my power to hold on to him. To be what he wanted me to be.
Over the next few weeks, my throat healed up, Eileen moved in, and Sam and I made the decision to make the bunker open to all hunters. There were still monsters out there that needed to be taken care of after all. Sam asked me if I was alright at one point, and for the first time in my life I didn’t try to lessen the impact of how everything turned out. I told him I missed Cas. Every day. But that I was happy being with my family here.
The Winchester brothers sauntered along a lonely, dusty road a couple hours later. They had a little way yet until they got to town, but as they came around a bend, they heard the sound of multiple voices. Dean held out his arm to Sam and pulled back on his reigns, “Hold up.”
Eventually the shifting slowed and stopped. I lay there trembling, feeling small and broken. The hand was no longer trapping my voice so I tried calling for help. A raspy whine escaped through a mouth that didn’t feel like my own. I struggled to open my eyes.
Leaning against the trunk of the car with my arms folded and my head down, I waited for the tank to fill up. I didn’t end up chasing after him though. I couldn’t. Didn’t know how. I wasn’t good at that kind of thing. Not like he was. Bobby always said he was the more emotionally mature of the two of us.
We left Officer Uptight to do his job and headed for Helena’s. I carried Sam, worry knotting my stomach as I felt his body shaking with pain. It helped keep my mind off my ribs. I saw Castiel looking at me worriedly, so I tried extra hard to look like it wasn’t bothering me.
The number of hallways and storerooms was dizzying. And the further we went the less people there were. The perfect place for an ambush. Eventually Joel stopped and explained that his friend Maggie would have come this way to head out one of two doors at the back of the building that led to the employee parking area. I looked around at where we stood now. Plywood cutouts stored vertically in rows stretched back about fifty yards and to each side about one hundred yards.
Just as the blanket slipped from his shoulders, the woman lurched toward him. His reflexes were dulled by his heat, but his stubborn determination was enough to sidestep her grasping fingers. Dean’s fist collided with her abdomen, earning him a soft grunt of pain. It wasn’t a powerful blow. His strength was fading by the second. Blinking in an effort to clear his eyes and mind, Dean staggered back from another hand trying to snatch the collar of his shirt.
“I thought I smelled somethin’ good,” one of the posse called out, earning some laughs and whoops of approval. “Seems like we got ourselves an Omega in heat!”
Jack smiled and gathered the pair of us into his arms and mumbled into our chests, “You two, my mother, and Castiel taught me that anyone can find the best in themselves if they look for it.”
“Carly and Gavin,” Sam answered, reaching out to steady Moonchild as she wavered on her feet. “Did you know them?”
. Instantly Sam’s defensiveness doubled. A low growl came from deep in his throat as his hand went instinctually to the gun at his side. The prostitute noticed and immediately fell back; hands held up non-threateningly.
“Thank you for your time, Sherriff. We’ll keep in touch.” Sam muttered, backing away slowly with Dean in tow.
Cas glanced at me before turning to face the gray waters of the Pacific Ocean. Looking far beyond the horizon the angel continued, “You were dead, but you spoke to him. You blamed him for Jessica and for bringing you on the road. He saw your father and brother and they spoke of his weakness as a man. He saw me -”
Making a half-hearted attempt at a smile I got to my feet, stood tall, cleared my throat, and said, “We’re getting him back.”
The seat next to me was empty and the door was wide open. Beyond was darkness. Unable to tear my eyes away, I felt blindly for the doorknob while reaching back to my back where my pistol had been tucked away. My door swung out with a loud creek that was quickly swallowed by the constant rush of rain. I whipped around, my pistol trembling slightly in my hand as I realized that this was the clearing from back in Diablo.
. I really didn’t want him so close. Couldn’t handle it. I dodged his touch, trying to play it off by adjusting my hold on Sam.
“You should get out of here; I’m going to call this in.” Ivan said, groaning as he got to his feet. He went to Castiel who was just finishing up healing and offered a hand to him. I watched closely as the angel took the officer’s hand appreciatively. Once Cas was on his feet, Ivan rubbed at the back of his head and moved to check on the comatose old woman’s vitals.
A slight smile tipped the corners of Sam’s lips as he rolled his eyes and followed after. Even though it was a good natural instinct to be worried and alert when on a hunt, it always made me upset seeing him looking like that. Not that I’d let him know. He hates when I look at him like a kid.
Sam’s arms were around my shoulders in an instant. My tears soaked into the front of his shirt as he pressed my head to his chest. I gripped the fabric tightly, reliving the moment of Cas’ lips forming the words ‘I love you’ over and over again.
Before I even emerged from the tree line, I could hear the roar of the flames. I coughed, shielding my stinging eyes from the acrid smoke. It raged despite the rain, bursting through windows and licking up the side of the house. My childhood home, the only one aside from Bobby’s that I’d ever really known. How was it here? A faint scream rose up. It was from inside the house. One that had haunted me my whole life. Mom.
I was utterly speechless. The monster was dead. Cas was still alive. Of course. Only an angel blade or something more powerful could have killed him. When I didn't answer, Sam's brows scrunched together as he knelt at my level and asked seriously, "What happened?"
. When was the last time he had a heat? A thin sheen of sweat developed on his brow and he became acutely aware of the sun beating down on his shoulders.
Looking a little dower, he shut his notebook with a light click. I asked silently what his deal was with the quirking of my brow. Letting out a breath he explained, “There’s uh…there’s no motel. The only way to stay around here is to either camp or rent a house.”
They gave their excuses to their friends who were much further along in their consumption of spirits and slipped out of the front doors into the city. The sun had set by now. The flickering light of streetlamps cast a warm glow on the walk; a pale interpretation of the golden light that had flooded the streets earlier as they headed into the saloon. Didn’t change how beautiful Jessica looked. Her skin practically glowed.
Without warning, a scream tore through the air. It sounded close. Before I could think it through, I was already tearing off in the direction it had come from. A few seconds later Sam was calling my name and rushing after me. More screams echoed out, each one getting further and further away. It quickly became apparent that this wasn't normal. Realizing this, I tried stopping, but found my boots were not agreeing with that decision. An errant piece of moss or leaf or something sent my right ankle into a roll. I immediately collapsed with a cry of pain and crashed onto the forest floor.
Goddamn him and his annoyingly genuine persistence. I didn't want to talk about it 'cause I had no fucking clue about what that was. I needed time to breathe. To think. Which I couldn't do with the haunting echoes of Dad's voice, mom's screams, and baby Sam's crying still bouncing around in my head. It felt as if my clammy skin could still feel the heat from the flames ghosting across it. I shook my head, shoving my gun back into my pants and said, "Drop it, Sam."
“I gotta do this, Sammy.” I cut him off. He gave me one of his trademarked looks, but he knew I wasn’t going to budge on this. Smiling I continued, “You and Eileen just hurry.”
Ignoring his pitying eyes, I took another drink, albeit a smaller sip this time, and asked with over-the-top boisterous frivolity, “Care to join me? The night is young and so are we. I mean, in angel terms you can’t be that – “
Zachariah hauled himself into his own saddle and sighed, “Something tells me this is going to be a long ride.”
I revved the engine, shot Cas a look of pure joy, cranked the volume and took off down the dirt road in front of us. We didn’t need wings. Baby flew just fine on her own.
As we walked out of the chilled morgue toward the front entrance I muttered quietly, “It’s going to be tricky tracking down a witch. Was there anything linking the victims?”
Propping my chin on my fist and staring out the window at the half barren branches of the deciduous trees around us, I told myself to stay calm. I felt like a raw nerve exposed to the elements and a numb ghost of what I once was at the same time. A strange contradiction that left me angry and exhausted, craving nothing more than solitude.
The youngest Winchester remembered taking this. It was one of the few times John had taken them into a town. Sam and his brother had been so happy. John even bought them some penny sweets from the local general store. The sugar had helped glue his mouth shut for the photo that they had to sit still for. It was a good memory.
I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. His blue eyes were gone. All that looked back at me was black. The black of a demon.
“Take me home.” A petite, dark haired woman commanded darkly as she spurred her horse forward. The click of her gun sent a chill down both brothers’ spines.
Letting out a heavy sigh, the man who appeared to be the Sherriff looked back at one of the people next to him and asked, “Thoughts, Deputy?”
“You been talkin’ with those gossips at the general store, haven’t you?” he asked, jabbing an accusing finger in Dean’s direction.
His blade found my flesh over and over again. He didn’t speak, but he kept forcing me to look into his eyes. The eyes of a demon. Reminding me of the guilt. I didn’t die. No matter how much I wished for it. No matter how many times I begged for God to come and give him back his wings and take my life in exchange.
Ever since coming back from The Empty, Castiel had wondered about Dean. After the older Winchester embraced him and brought him back to the bunker, they’d gone out on hunts together just as they had before. Dean acted just like he usually did, perhaps too much so. But it was the small things that Castiel noticed as off. Dean seemed like he was holding back under all the bravado. Whenever Castiel touched him, Dean would pull away as soon as he could. Whenever they spoke, Dean wouldn’t quite meet his eyes. And so on.
The sheer weight of this investigation was becoming apparent as I struggled to piece together the distances he was talking about. Sam of course was already on it, mumbling something about a two-day hike in each direction. I assumed that was in experienced outdoorsmen terms.
“Who’s there?” I demanded, the base of my neck tingling as I struggled to recognize the familiar voice.
Suddenly I ran straight into a solid wall of leaves that hadn’t been there a brief second before. The sharp scent of juniper assaulted my nose as I fell flat on my ass. Groaning and rubbing the spot on the back of my head that collided with the hard earth, I rolled over and glanced up at the offending shrubbery. Looking around I found that what looked like a hedge maze had sprung up around me. I was trapped.
This added to Sam’s anxieties about presenting late. If he ended up as an Omega, he would lose her. Omegas can only be part of the same pack if the leaders of said pack brought them together. If he was a Beta, then he could mate with Jessica and start his own pack, just like his father did with his mother. Then they could find land somewhere and start a family of their own.
Fires with Dad were cold. Low so the flames weren’t easily seen by anything. Fires with Sam were warm; happy like it was supposed to be. So, I let him have his way with making the grub. I sat back, enjoyed a beer, and attempted flipping through the internet on my phone to look for anything that might help us on the case. A lack of reception smashed that ambition, so I stuffed it back in my pocket and allowed boredom to distract me. I ended up letting my mind wander as I stared into the crackling flames.
Hope you all are staying safe and healthy out there! I've been busy with finals the last few days self-quarantined in my house, but after tomorrow I can get into some more writing! Going to get more of this story, and my others done!
“Pa and his crusade ain’t my responsibility. Shouldn’t be yours either. Especially not now.” Sam continued, getting even more heated. “Hell, if it weren’t for that picture or the stories you told me, I wouldn’t even know what Mama was like. I mean, even if we do hunt down the bastard that killed her, she ain’t comin’ back.”
The brothers fled across the street to a nearby alley and ducked into the shadows. Not long after, a crowd started gathering outside the boarding house. Some attempted a half-hearted gesture at getting buckets to fight back the flames, but it was already too far gone. They realized quickly once the fire brigade arrived and instead of fighting the fire, started preparing the houses next door to spare them the same fate.
he considered his best friend. The kind of mind-blowing sex that lived in legends and changed everything. His mind flashed to the brief thought he’d had earlier. Dean pictured Castiel between his legs, pressing his dick inside. He’d overheard people mentioning that it hurt, but in this fantasy it didn’t. It was incredible.
He pumped faster, twisting his wrist when he neared the top of the shaft. His other hand slid up his stomach, across his chest, and up to his neck. There his fingers roamed, pressing intermittently. He curled in on himself tighter, wishing desperately there was someone that he could be close to.
Dean’s eyes looked clearer now that he’d ingested some non-alcoholic fluids, but he was obviously still drunk considering his words were slightly slurred.
“Yeah,” he answered, the sound of rustling coming through the speaker as he looked around for something in the tent. “After that we should hit up the North Cascades Visitors Center before it gets dark, see if they have anything useful.”
The pair of us went to the front door. It was pretty normal looking, but the smell of herbs was super strong. I sneezed. Definitely plants traditionally used for spells in the garden. Dean glanced at me as he opened the screen door and knocked solidly.
Glad to have something to distract her, she started making sandwiches. I turned my attention to the computer and started pulling up anything and everything on human-animal transformations that I could find. Everything fell away as I delved deep into the research.
Still overwhelmed by the shock of what had just come over my body and flashed through my mind, I nodded. His blue eyes were all that I could see. All I could feel was the gentle brush of his trench coat against my hand. When did we get so close? This would usually be the time Sam would come out of nowhere and interrupt us.
“Morning Sleeping Beauty,” I cut in, fidgeting with the keys in my pocket. “We going to hit the road soon, or are you going to sleep the day away?”
Letting the door of the Impala shut with a loud creak, I took off at a jog toward the front of the large theater. Only one person stood outside, a young man with brown curls, thick glasses, and a look of fear barely restrained on his face. My gut clenched as I made a beeline for him.
“You should allow yourself to feel vulnerable.” He finished, his breath ghosting over the short hairs on the back of my head. My thoughts and feelings raged. I struggled with how this kind of intimate contact was affecting me. It was something my body craved but my mind told me I shouldn’t.
At some point I woke up enough that I noticed healing energy pulsing familiarly through my ribs. Cas had pulled off onto the shoulder so he could reach back to where I lay. I didn’t move or say anything. Pleased with the small bit he accomplished, he waited for Sam to crawl back and curl up with me before pulling back out onto the highway. I shouldn’t be so stubborn about getting help. I knew that. I should thank him. But it was hard.
A thin sheet of rain was coming down as we arrived, dampening clothing that wasn’t waterproof and making visibility a little difficult. Didn’t stop me from noticing that none of the lights in the tower were on. The shadowed windows stared down at us blankly. Jerking my head in its direction, I took out my gun and proceeded to quietly limp my way toward the metal stairs that led up the western side of the tower.
I took a tentative sip of my steaming coffee before answering, “Both of the victims had partially digested dog food in their stomachs. One of the victims, Thomas Waithe, went missing last month for about two weeks before they found his body in the middle of the main road. Seems he’d been struck by a vehicle. Gail Heavensby went missing right after they found Thomas’ body. They found her a little outside of town, also in the middle of the road, also struck by a vehicle.”
The joints in my legs popped in relief as I emerged from the driver’s side. Rolling my shoulders, I took in the fresh mountain air. Further west the peaks loomed, promising that our journey through them was about to be narrow and winding.
Again, he struggled with telling me what happened. But I waited. Even though I needed to know what went down, the last thing I wanted to do was pressure him.
I was halfway done unbuttoning my shirt when I caught sight of his blue eyes watching me. I froze, realizing that I was standing half naked in front of Castiel, who was looking at me more intensely than a friend should. He didn’t seem to care that I noticed.
I nodded, running my hand over my face one last time before I went back to my dresser to start digging in the drawers once again.
“They don’t just do Shakespeare plays though,” I answered. “There’s a lot of experimental stuff that they put on.”
Both were surprised by this. But Castiel didn’t want to get his hopes up, so he waited for Dean to continue.
The question kind of came out. Sam regretted saying anything as soon as he felt the sting of the handle of her pistol slam against the side of his head. He fell to the dirt with a grunt of pain and didn’t have time to clear the stars from his eyes before Constance was on top of him, holding him down with more strength than she looked like she possessed.
Green eyes met blue. For a second, Dean hesitated. Castiel could see him struggling with his vulnerability and immediately regretted pushing. To make sure he didn’t slip too far into self-doubt, Cas caught his mouth and kissed him slowly and tenderly. As apology, Castiel moved his hand from around Dean’s shaft to the edge of the blonde’s shirt and pushed it up, exposing midriff and then chest. Dean watched warily as Castiel lowered his head to one of the exposed nipples.
Peeking around the corner I saw Ivan on the floor close to where I stood, lying unconscious under a pretty significant dent in the wall that was body shaped. Castiel was further in, literally rooted to the ground. His angel blade was next to his feet, dropped when it was crushed from his grasp. He cried out in pain as the vines around him constricted. Gertie stood in front of him, working hurriedly to scatter herbs and light candles around Maggie and an older woman lying on the bed. That must be Gertie’s mom. Tubes and wires trailed from her body.
“It’s what we do.” Claire added as she jogged into the kitchen from the backdoor. I hadn’t even realized she was paying attention.
“Floyd Rees? My name is Ranger Plant. You mind if I ask you a few questions?” I asked, holding up my badge for his scrutinizing eyes.
“Hey, you okay?” I called over to Ivan. He looked a little banged up. Blood trickled from a cut on the back of his head, staining his uniform collar black in the dim light.
Dean could see Sam thinking about his new life. The oldest Winchester glanced toward the road and back, squinting against the light.
Lifting Cas so only his toes brushed the ground, the Tikbalang rubbed the side of its face against his struggling form. White hot anger boiled up and I started toward them, not sure what I would do, but unwilling to back down.
A couple of young women walk in and Benny excuses himself to take their drink order. Dean settles in and enjoys his beer, the siren call of the weekend so close he can taste it in the way his cheeks tingle with the bitter stout. Feeling relaxed, he fishes his phone out of his front pocket and responds to a text from his little brother, one that’s been sitting unread since lunchtime. Sam, who’s currently attending Stanford on a full-ride scholarship, the brainiac, always makes sure he’s checking in on him. It gets annoying and though he won’t admit this to anyone, Dean wouldn’t want it any other way.
Things are dying down at the restaurant now, but he stays for another hour and a half to help Ellen take care of a few things. As he’s stocking a crate of clean glasses behind the bar, he tells Jo and Ash about his plans for the evening and they enthusiastically agree to join him. Sam, on the other hand, isn’t quite as easily persuaded. Luckily, Jess is there to remind him that he’s been wound up so tight with all his studying that he could use a night off and that she could use a couple of drinks and a dance floor. Within the hour, plans are settled and they are itching to get out of there.
Castiel beamed, looking happier than I thought was possible for him. For the first time in forever I felt complete. The wind tossed our hair and the music faded, I reached over the back of the seat and rested my hand on Cas’ shoulder. The gesture seemed to surprise him but after a moment, he smiled. As we kicked up dirt and coasted down the lonely stretch of road I thought of Sam and hoped that he’d get here soon. But not too soon.
“Perfect!” Sam cut in, sparing them all from the undoubtedly lengthy list. “Go and pack a bag and meet back here in five.”
So, he had heard. Stiffening, I wondered if I could get away with saying I had been sleep walking. No. He was too smart for that excuse.
The plastic case on my phone rattled against the concrete floor. Numbly, I picked it up and turned it over. Sam was calling. Where was my voice?
Finally, he broke away, blinking over at me. He seemed to realize the truth to my words and bowed his head. Not wanting him to sink into dark thoughts, I said hurriedly, “Why don’t we go over the case together? Keep ourselves occupied.”
I dropped Sam off near Joel Brown’s apartment before heading to Gail’s family’s house. Most of them were there, mourning the fresh loss of the youngest of them. It was touch and go for a couple of them. Their emotions were running high and sensitive. But I managed.
He glanced up, catching sight of me. If he was surprised, I couldn’t tell. For a moment we stared at each other before he gave me a solemn nod. Not sure what else to say or do, I awkwardly patted the wood and turned, tight lipped to follow after Helena.
Castiel’s whole body stiffened as a familiar warmth spread throughout his body. He’d felt it before over the years, and each time he didn’t know what to do with it. This special…bond with Dean had been there since the beginning. Sam had never elicited anything like this from him. Which only further complicated the urges he was certain Dean would find unwelcome.
My fist collided with my attacker who hadn’t moved after bludgeoning me. Their small frame went staggering back, crashing into a worktable. The random contents scattered across the ground. Before I could get another hit in, or tackle them, they threw out their hand and uttered a string of guttural words. It sounded familiar, but the sudden tearing of flesh on my forehead sent me doubling over in surprise and pain. In the next instant blood flowed down my face, blinding one eye.
Sam headed further into the alley, to keep away from prying eyes and ears, but he stopped when he noticed Dean had stilled.
Sam shook his head in disbelief, “He was supposed to go with me, or tell me there was nothing to be afraid of! I was seven, Dean.”
The look of realization on his face when Jack took his powers and knitted our broken bones back together was intensely satisfying. The pure horror at the thought of living mortal and forgotten was the icing on the cake. This was what he deserved after treating all of creation like toys.
Scoffing, I glanced over at him, now hoping that he would just read my mind and get it over with. But instead I felt my insides twist at the look of focused concern on Cas’ face. His dark brows were drawn together tightly, wrinkling his forehead up to his hairline. Mostly it was his eyes that got me. Normally if he was trying to get information out of someone or something, they would be slightly narrowed making them crease around the edges. It always made the blue of his irises look even darker. But right now, they were wide open, bright with curiosity and ready to take in all of what I had to say.
I could hear chanting. Whatever she had planned for Maggie, it was happening now. I had to do something. Craning my neck, I started biting at the plant trapping me. From out of the corner of my eye a flash of white and beige went toward the voice. Castiel! I chewed faster.
For a moment, she sat in silence, wracking her brain for anything that could help us. After some time, I offered up suggestions that might jog her memory, mentioning hearing things, or strange smells.
Prodding the tender flesh, he glanced nervously around for whoever or whatever had been screaming or causing the screaming and then tested the joint. Muttering an apology, he slowly rotated my foot. Not gonna lie: it hurt like a bitch.
to rely on my arms that were now my front legs. When I did get up on all fours, I wobbled slightly. Every move was strange. It felt like what bloom around lights in a dimly lit room looked like. Shaking my head to clear my thoughts, I looked at the wood flooring below. Hopping down from the ottoman seemed a bit intimidating. I was high up now that I was the size of a Cocker Spaniel.
Once the pair were in the bathroom, Dean handed Castiel a towel and started wiping himself off. Glancing over at the angel from under his eyelashes, Dean continued to wonder about what this all meant. He worried that everything would change now. Did Cas expect them to kiss and date like a real couple would? Again, he didn’t know how to answer.
Leaning over the counter so her mouth was less than a foot from his ear she continued, “You’ll be wantin’ to share some words with Mr. Joseph Welch. Just over there. She’s his wife.”
The pistol had most likely been relieved from one of the bandits that stayed back to assault Dean. Sam didn’t want to think about what happened. He was sure Dean didn’t want to either. Checking the number of bullets, Sam waited for Dean to start returning fire again before sprinting off. As he passed his brother he said, “Hold them off. I’m going to circle around.”
She ran her hand through her already frazzled curls and turned to the fridge. She started pulling out vegetables and asked over her shoulder, “Either of you want something to eat?”
He was right. Going to the cops would only make things messy. Seemed like I was about to become the first I.T. savvy dog.
Sam closed and locked the door before dragging my desk chair close to where I’d posted up on the foot of my bed. Neither of us said anything at first. It felt like Sam was struggling with how to begin. I couldn’t even look at him.
Tracing the tense line of Sam’s neck and shoulders with her eyes, Jess stepped closer and probed, “Your brother said something about him being on some kind of hunting trip?”
Sam turned instantly, his eyes saying ‘no’ before his mouth could. I stopped in my tracks, blocked by his Sasquatch-ness. I held up my hand and continued fiercely, “I get that you’re worried about me, but we need to get answers before this happens again.”
Leaning against the hood of the Impala with my arms over my chest I called, “You’d think these crunchy granola types would be out here slumming it instead of in a house to get the full experience.”
That fooled no one. Panting, I finally looked around at the pair staring intently at me. Sam in particular. He’d been the one to pull me out of my nightmare after all. As I mentally told my brother to shut up, I didn’t pay attention to Castiel coming closer. The familiar pressure of his hand against my shoulder – over the mark he’d left when he saved my sorry ass from hell – startled me. I jerked back like his touch  burned.
High-functioning train wrecks. That’s what we were. I rolled my eyes and huffed but didn’t comment any further. We got to Ashland about an hour later.
We left shortly after, walking through the sleepy streets of Ashland one last time before finally making it to where I’d stashed the Impala. Running my hand along her hood I greeted, “Hey, Baby.”
“Get up Sammy!” he hollered, shooting a few more rounds at the bandits as they hurried to find cover.
Their horses’ hooves became muffled as they reached the last of the cobblestone streets. Only a dusty dirt road was ahead of them now. Sam shot his brother an annoyed look, silently telling him to get along with explaining.
Ivan didn’t reply right away. And when he did, he did so with a pointed glare in my direction, “Just look out for Helena until I can make it back.”
Sam’s blood ran cold. A hunting trip could only mean one thing to Winchesters: bounty hunting. Somehow, he managed to keep his expression under control and turned to Jessica. Very calmly he mumbled, “Go ahead on inside, I’ll be in in a little while.”
He turned and nipped my hand affectionately before licking it. I ruffled his ears one last time and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll see you again soon. Enjoy your vacation.”
Heat rising to my face, I ducked my chin toward my chest and grumbled, “I don’t think it’s safe for us to go back to the motel. Whoever our Druid is, knows that we’re looking for her, and this is a small town. Won’t take them long to figure out we’re the “FBI” that’s been going around asking questions.”
