Tony let out a sigh. “Cockblocked by my own earth.”
“That would be me.” A voice said from the shadows.
Steve shrugged. “It's legal now, isn't it?”
“Oh.” Tony's smiled dimmed a little bit. “At least one of us is lucky in love. My attempt at marriage didn't go so well."
Natasha let him go and turned to the portal platform to make sure everything was all set for dimensional travel while Tony turned to Steve.
Natasha shook her head. “No, but I'll look into it.”
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose and resisted the urge to walk in there and just butt their heads together.
Natasha smiled proudly. “Yes, Iron Woman. I had some heart problems a while back and invented the armor as a type of life support to keep my heart going. Been kicking ass ever since.”
“Why is that?”
. He thought he would never have the chance to do this to him again. To kiss him, to hold him, to have him fall apart in his arms like this.
It was unnerving just how well she knew him in this small amount of time.
Jan walked into the room and saw Steve sitting at the table.
Tony woke up with a pounding headache. God, it had been a long while since he'd woken up with a hangover.
“I'm serious.” Steve scowled, crossing his arms in front of himself. “You've been holed up in here going on a week now.”
Steve had been killed by a gun he had made.
“It's okay, Tony. I'm okay. I'm here.” Steve said.
It had all culminated when Tony had yelled that he wasn't one of Steve's soldiers and Steve had all but stormed out.
"At ease, tiger." She warned, eyes sparkling with amusement. "I'm married."
Tony gave them both a wave. “Here goes nothing.”
"I'm fine," Laura assured. "I just care that you're healing and safe."
One of those blessings was – strangely enough – Stane's arrival. Since he was listed as Tony's next of kin, the doctor could update him as to Tony's condition, which was done as soon as Stane and Rhodey arrived in the waiting area they had been instructed to go to.
"No, really?" Tony said. "I never would have guessed that the way you came flying into my building faster than the speed of light." Carol let out a bit of a self-deprecating laugh.
"Yes ma'am. Thank you."
"Doctor." Smith made eye contact with Fury and within a few seconds, she relented.
"Understandable," she said. "So, if you want to talk about something else, why don't you tell me who Steve is?"
"Yes! Have you seen him?" Natasha raised a hand placatingly.
"She is," Bruce said. "Trust me, the more you get to know her, the more awesome she gets."
"Do what?"
"She started it," he said. "I'll stop when she stops. Besides, I've heard worse in scarier languages from strangers on the street."
"Alright," she said. "I'll look into it, see what I can find."
"I just need my S.H.I.E.L.D. ID," Clint said as he entered the bedroom. "We think we know when Tony left, and we want to use the surveillance footage to track his movements."
"No," he said. "Not really." Tony frowned, the deeper disappointment apparent.
First thing's first, I'm not going to see Ant-Man and the Wasp until next Thursday. Please don't put spoilers in your review. Second thing's second, this is another chapter where I teeter very close to the M rating. Not for anything sexual, but for... Well, you'll see.
"Yeah," Lara. "We're just going to ask him what we can do to
Lara led the way out of the room and to Steve's surprise she didn't go right to one of the others' rooms. Instead, she went straight to the elevator and hit the call button. It was already on their floor, so the doors just opened.
"It wasn't like right and wrong mattered to me at the time," Natasha said. "All that mattered to me was saving you. Now that I can look at it objectively, I can see that I was wrong. I can also see how I compromised myself…" Clint narrowed his eyes.
Stepping back over to where she had left her phone charging, she picked it up and pulled it off the wire. She figured she should probably text some last words to her brothers while she still had the chance. However, she ended up being distracted when she saw that she had a new text message. Figuring it was Todd texting her back, she opened it up right away, only to be shocked to find that the text had come from an unknown number.
"Well, that's wonderful," Steve said.
"Or we can discuss this now," Tony interjected. Pepper held up her hand in the stop signal a little higher.
"No, I don't want to hear it." Tony took a calming breath before continuing. "I know that Project: Rebirth was the operation that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America. I'm not going to give those files over to S.H.I.E.L.D. just so they can create their own army of Super Soldiers."
When Steve didn’t answer soon enough, Tony tactfully filled the silence.
“It feels like I
“So,” Steve said after chewing and swallowing a bite of eggs, “What kind of big plans did you make?”
“What even is a pawn shop?” the child said. Steve stuffed his hands into his pockets and watched his feet while he hiked up a hill. He shadow grew before him, a streetlight to his back. He was getting further and further from the heart of the city, from home, and the neighborhood was quieter out here. The scream of sirens in the distance was ubiquitous, but he was the only person on this side street and half the street lamps were dead. The stores out here weren’t open past eleven, and half the houses had dark windows and weeds in the tiny yards.
"Me too," Tony admitted. "I'll keep an eye on things as best as I can."
He was curled up in an arm chair across the lab drawing when he heard a zapping sound, followed by a purple-blue hazy glow emanating from the device.
Tony chewed on a piece of salad. “Are you going to be alone?”
“Those tendrils are fused to his
He had visited Steve this morning to give him a birthday gift, but the lost his nerve when the bathroom door opened and Sharon stepped out of a cloud of steam with a towel around her body. She was a beautiful, witty, wonderful woman. She and Steve made each other happy, and she was there for him when Tony couldn’t be. He couldn’t resent her for loving him, and there was some mutual respect between he and Sharon, because in a way, they shared Steve’s heart Half of him was better than none of them, and he was too much of a gentleman to love them both at the same time, but that love
Tony poured Sam a cup of coffee. “SHIELD is looking into it. They debriefed Steve and they’re trying to find her body but—”
"Nothing," Tony repeated in a strained voice. His expression was surly, like he was annoyed at Steve for making him lie.
“In the other dimension?”
As quick as that, Tony recovered. “We’ll see about that, won’t we?” He said as if it was a challenge to exhaust Steve with newly-wed activities.
“His signature? You mean— Jet, get off of him, you’re confused," Steve said.
Tony was unbearable. He paced Steve’s room. He drained cup after cup of shitty coffee from the mess hall; the Hub was a SHIELD base, so it operated on global time, and like New York city, it never slept. There were always agents in the halls, someone to bring him coffee.
Tony was lying on the ground, rubbing his throat and gasping. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I didn’t clone any kind of signature. I don't know who you're even talking about. That’s not what this thing does,” he rasped, holding his hands above his face defensively.
“You usually get up by now. Are you feeling alright?”
“Make sure you get enough to eat,” Tony said softly, but the damage was done. Steve had lost his appetite.
And more puzzling still were the
“Oh,” he said, “They’re going to try and find Sharon. The portal collapsed around us when she detonated Zola's ship, so she... I don’t think there’ll be anything left to find but.”
Steve was formally discharged from the medical bay without so much as a psych evaluation. First mistake.
But he couldn’t. He just— couldn’t.
It had clearly not been opened in years. The lock has been painted over by a careless worked. He forced it open and sucked in the fresh air.
"I don't think anything here is big enough," Steve said. "This whole suite is too small. He'd stick out like a sore thumb."
"And you're willing to make that sacrifice for me?" Steve snorted.
"Let me correct that," Stark said. "This is the first time you've been dying and had time to mull it over." Clint opened his mouth to argue, but he realized Stark might be right. Every other time he'd been dying or close to death, it either happened so quick he didn't even have time to process it or he didn't possess the awareness to even really think about it. "That's what I thought," Stark said after Clint went a few moments without responding. "Well, I've been dying or in a situation where I could die more times than I can even count at this point, and let me tell you, watching other people watch you die is worse than dying itself."
"I'm not upset with you," she said. "Do you know why?" Tony shook his head. "Because there's nothing to be upset with." Tony gave her a strange look. "I'm going to tell you something. Something about one of the greatest men I've ever known…"
"Last week," Salinas said. "While Stark was in my house, he and possibly my maid attempted to poison me with the venom of a rare species of jellyfish."
work."
"I'll take a cold shower," he said. "I'll be fine." Steve raised an eyebrow.
Having gotten ready, Jessica headed up the basement stairs to get to work. Salinas was sure to be gone by now and there would be another twenty to thirty minutes until the workers showed up. She would have the house to herself, but unfortunately, in order to keep her cover, she would have to spend it mopping the floors and scrubbing the counters. Otherwise, she would have spent the time getting into some

"Hey," he said. "Look at this. If I squeeze the tube like this, blood comes out of me and goes back up into the bag." He attempted to give a demonstration as he said that, but the nurse rushed over and pushed his hands away.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course, you do, because that's who you are." Carol couldn't help but smile at her friend's kind words. Unfortunately, though, she didn't have time for too much of a self-empowerment seminar. The phone beeped, indicating that she was about to run out of call time. She urgently fed another quarter into the machine, temporarily resetting the clock.
Still, if she did not want to hurt him, then he could not see why she would even bother in the first place. There had to be a reason. If there was one thing, he could give Romanoff, it was that she never did anything without a reason. He respected that about her.
"I think that could be arranged," he said.
"So, what does that tell you?" Pepper asked.
The nurse pushed her down a labyrinth of hallways leading back to the ER. There, Carol was brought to an empty bed and told to sit and wait for the doctor to check her out. She asked if she would be allowed to leave after that, but the nurse acted like he didn't hear her and walked off. Carol's right hand started to ball into a fist.
"I'm going to need their contact information," Duran said. "Just so I can verify that alibi."
"I tried several times to inform you of this, Sir," the AI said. "But you either didn't listen or said you would take care of it later after you slept." Tony mentally slapped himself.
"The interviews and the gala," Natasha repeated.
"Only four people had full access to all the files and research related to Project: Rebirth," Commander Hill explained. "Agent Margret Carter, Dr. Abraham Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips and Howard Stark. Erskine was killed by a Hydra assassin the same day Captain Rogers underwent the serum treatment. Col. Phillips died of natural causes in his home in 1980. Stark was killed alongside his wife in a car accident on Long Island in 1991. The only survivor is Agent Carter, but she is in hospice care for dementia in London. I doubt she'll be of any help."
"You're not actually blaming yourself for this, are you?" Stark asked.
"I appreciate it," Tony said. "But you know my rules about being handed things." Natasha rolled her eyes but set the packet down on the counter in front of him.
Stark pulled back and frowned. Natasha raised her eyebrows as if to say, "are you going to do something about it?" He shook his head, seemingly pleading no contest before gesturing to the woman next to him.
As he got older, his Atheism progressed from the simple denial of a God to vehement opposition to all religion. He would tell anyone who would listen that religion was for the weak. That its enslaved people and normalized a capitalist power structure; giving white men the justification to dominate women and deny the rights of people of color. He thought the United States should be an Atheist state, reject the ideals of capitalism, and turn to communism.
"Are there any red lights on in the panel?"
"Thank you, dear." A small smile graced Steve's face. As the two men looked at each other adoringly, Pepper picked her bag and shuffled the papers in her hands.
"You need to eat." Tony looked down.
"Okay," he said. "I understand." Truly accepting that would take much longer, though, but Betty seemed to understand that.
"Eight!" Oswin cheered like a small child watching
"You were drunk yesterday, too," Romanoff pointed out. "I know. I smelled it on you and Steve told me you had a few on the plane." Tony's heart stopped for a moment. It felt like someone had poured a bucket of ice water over him.
"Oh." Tony's voice took on an unusual quality. "Are there any other treatment options."
Breakfast didn't start until six and they didn't need to be out the door until eight. This ensured everyone had a few hours to eat and get ready. However, since Lara wasn't going in front of any cameras herself, she had very little to do to get ready comparatively. So, with all the extra time on her hands, she decided to do it productively and headed out the door to do her job.
Before Steve could think about what he was doing, he had his lips firmly planted on Tony’s. He tasted like an overwhelming combination of vodka and olives but Tony was twining his arms around Steve's shoulders and god, did that feel amazing.
Steve snorted. “I don't doubt it. I'm just telling you to be careful. They've killed for less.”
“Awww, I didn't know you cared.”
Steve pulled back as far as the couch cushions would allow so he could see Tony's face. He looked flushed, his cheeks red from alcohol and arousal but his gaze was steady, obviously waiting for some kind of response from Steve.
Tony flashed him a smile. “Okay, I'll meet you in fifteen.”
Steve stepped in, making his way to the living room. He watched as Tony fixed himself a vodka martini, heavy on the vodka, before he turned back to Steve.
Tony looked around in confusion and, yeah this lab wasn't one of his. It was sort of familiar in an odd way but he'd definitely never been here before.
“The problem,” Tony hissed, “Is that I swore I'd never lay hands on another weapon as long as I live. I can't help you Steve, I'm sorry.”
Tony shuddered and shook around him and Steve petted a reaffirming hand down his back, his fingers tangling in the bunches of fabric of Tony's smooth robe. Tony took a deep breath and relaxed his body and seemed to stop quivering around him. “Okay, Steve. Fuck me hard.”
Steve watched him leave, adjusting his grip on the man in his arms. “C'mon, you're coming with me.”
Tony gave him a ride back to the Tower and Steve had planned to talk to him about their fight as soon as they got back but Tony beat him to the punch. The second they touched down on the hangar, Tony pressed him into the tall glass window and kissed him soundly, murmuring apologies to his lips and along the curve of his jaw.
She just gave him an amused look. “Not that I want to interrupt your reunion but we are kind of in the middle of an enchanted tomb.”
“It is.” Steve said, tugging Tony closer and wrapping his arms around him.
There was a beep overhead and a soft female voice rang out. "Scan complete. Radiation frequencies are consistent with Earth 1610."
“I'm fine.” Steve assured, sitting up and giving Natasha a quick once over, checking for injuries. “But who fired those blasts.”
Steve seemed to know and gave Tony a friendly pat on his arm before stepping down on the street. Tony followed, ready to protect Steve should the need arise.
The woman powered down and lowered the gauntlet, offering her other hand out to him. "I take it this is your first time dealing with the multiverse?” At his silence, she continued. “Well, Tony. Welcome to Earth 3490. I'm Natasha Stark."
Tony was a big flirt. Jan knew that. He had said sexual things around Steve before which usually ended in Steve scowling or just flat out walking away from him but he had actually smirked at him this time.
Tony just cried harder.
Steve smiled and planted a kiss on the top of Tony's head.
“Sorry, I'm doped up to the gills. I think I misheard you.”
Steve swallowed, knowing Tony meant Jan but felt himself shift under Tony’s scrutiny thinking he’d seen what was underneath the surface.
“Yes. My lab.”
Tony hurriedly snatched the bottle of whiskey off the counter and walked out before Steve could respond.
Tony rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth as he remembered Steve coming over to his house after Jarvis' funeral. This visit had been completely unprompted and Tony didn't fully remember that entire evening due to the shocking number of martinis he'd imbibed, but he did recall Steve sitting next to him on the couch as he rambled on about nothing and everything. He knew he hadn't been terribly good company and had told Steve so but he had stayed with him anyway. When Tony had woke up the next morning with cottonmouth and a throbbing headache, there had been a blanket over his body and a glass of water on the coffee table.
When he finally opened his eyes, he thought he was hallucinating.
“Letting me off right at home, huh?” Tony said.
Steve sat there for a moment, stunned. After he shook himself from his stupor, he went to stand up and follow Tony but a small hand on his wrist stopped him.
“You ready?” Steve asked, feeling a bit redundant, as Tony had just said he was, but still needing to ask again.
Tony blinked.
“God, I'm so sorry.” Natasha said, eyes sympathetic.
Natasha gave him a pitying smile. “Yes, it's positively devastating.”
He eased the tip in, having to push a bit hard to get through the tight ring of muscles. Tony tensed when Steve was in halfway and Steve stopped, not wanting to hurt him. Tony waved an impatient hand at him, gesturing for him to keep going and then Steve was poised flush to Tony's glutes.
straight.
Steve rolled his eyes at them but he was smiling too.
God, Steve had missed that look.
Steve would tell him when he was ready.
“Yeah, Steve, come on. Make me feel it.” Tony said, face pressed into his hands, having positioned himself on his knees and elbows now.
That next morning Steve found the bed empty as Thor had roused Tony early to help them work on the Bifrost. Steve did his best to help out, coordinating the teams to scour Battleworld for the Beyonder's hideout and heading communications at the tower. In that time, Tony was getting increasingly frustrated with trying to get the Bifrost to work. He was snapping at Steve and was just being a pain in the ass in general.
Steve frowned, shaking his head a bit like he was angry at himself. “No. I meant, I know I'm in love with you.”
Steve watched as Tony's fingers disappeared into his hole. He fucked himself on them, thrusting them deep inside. Tony was pretty quiet during all of it, only letting out a few hitched breaths and one tiny moan at a particularly well angled thrust. Eventually Tony added a third finger and Steve unzipped his pants and took himself in hand. He could've come just like that, watching as Tony stretched himself open, but he held off.
“We need rings.” Tony gasped when Steve pulled back for breath. “How do you feel about rose gold? Or maybe silver is more your style?”
Bucky smiled and settled back into his chair.
Just exactly how much had he had to drink last night?
“I’m fine, thanks.”
Cap smiled again at Stark's back before seeming to get a hold of himself and go back to pre-mission preparations.
Tony twirled his glass in his hand and opened the door wider. “Do you want to come in? We could watch some of those soap operas you like so much?”
“What are you so angry about, Cap? We succeeded and are home in time for dinner and drinks.”
Steve knew he should stop. He knew both him and Tony were using each other as a means to an end but he couldn't bring himself to pull away.
“What? Why not?” Steve asked, feeling confused. “You have the skill for it.”
Tony’s beard tickled against his neck, but Steve felt something in his chest break at Tony’s pleading tone. He wrapped his arm around Tony and felt as the man sighed into his skin.
Tony raised his eyebrows. "Really?"
Tony’s eyes seemed to light up at Steve's inarticulate expression. “Oh, that’s it, isn’t it? So, I was more spot on with my earlier comment. Maybe sex is just what you need.” Tony set down his glass and slid into Steve’s lap.
Tony leaned his head on Steve's tombstone, tears running freely down his cheeks.
"So, realistically, what are my chances of having a threesome with you two then? Sleeping with myself and Steve are both on my fucket list."
Eventually Tony's breathing evened out and Steve went back to his desk to keep vigil over him. He had some work to get done anyway.
"I understand just fine," he said coldly. He was frozen to the spot. He couldn't decide what to do and his chest felt too tight to even breathe. Half of him needed to book it as far away as possible and hide somewhere dark until the urge to hyperventilate passed. Through that portal was his family grave plot-- woman and boy, one spot left for father. But it was also a world he'd loved and left behind. A life he'd left behind. He could run through the portal faster than Tony could stop him. They may never find him again and the thought tantalized him.
Tony scoffed. “If you’re suggesting I was hacked, don’t bother. I ran every security test imaginable, just to be sure. The data is legit. How it happened, though, I don’t know.”
"We have to go back."
Tony felt clumsy comforting Steve; so often, their positions had been swapped. Watching Steve implode was like watching God die. It was terrifying, but he swallowed his panic. He rubbed Steve’s back, without thinking. When they were lovers they exchanged comforting gestures like pair-bonded birds preening each others’ feathers. It came so naturally that he didn’t think to ask permission.
Classification: Super soldier
. I should have,” Steve said. Tony’s expression darkened, brows furrowed. “I feel like I’m dead.”
As reluctant as Steve was to allow himself to enjoy it, the vacation was a breath of fresh air. Tony kept him so busy that he hardly had time to think during the long days, and the seclusion of the vineyard from the rest of the world gave Steve the respite he didn’t realize he so gravely needed from the noise of civilization. In a way, it was like coming out of the ice all over again. And just like when he’d awoken in this century, it was Tony by his side showing him all the light the world had to offer, coaxing him out of his darkness.
Steve smiled, but it was thin and transparent. It was obvious that he had no intention of calling on Tony unless it was absolutely necessary.
He did. He wanted to tell his story. To speak it into existence, because for now, it resided in a nebulous unreality. He was the only witness and his memory was really the only record. That scared him. The sooner he got it out of himself, the sooner it wouldn’t have to live there any longer.
TS: Fifty?
“Orange, please.”
“Oh, thank you. I didn’t notice the time pass, I guess.”
Steve had made it back to Earth alive but Tony
“No. This is where you leave me.”
“No, I’ll be with Sam,” Steve found himself saying without thinking, a lie which could easily be found out. He knew that Tony had gotten into the habit of touching base with Steve’s friends to check in on him. He wasn’t as subtle as he wished, but Steve appreciated the kindness and it was easier to pretend not to know.
She didn’t say his name. They never did.
“I’m fine,” Steve said reflexively, and Fury, the smug bastard, looked pleased to hear it. “I just want to do anything I can to help.”
Steve obediently brought the glass to his mouth, sloshing
Jet appeared as though summoned. She came in through the open skylight window, silent as a shadow. She dropped to the floor like a spider and she grabbed Tony by the throat before Steve even registered her presence in the lab, or how the hell she got in.
“But we have to look,” Hill finished.
“If you don’t talk to me, I can’t help you,” she said, not for the first time. This was the fourth session, and Steve was as closed-off now as he had been during their first appointment.
“Give me samples,” Tony insisted. “Let me run my own tests.”
“I was thinking it might do you some good to get away from the city. A vacation. A
“It was an accident,” Steve finally said.
Tony started building in his lab during the nights he couldn’t sleep, and like older times, Steve would drift that way as well and they’d sit in companionable silence. Tony tinkering, Steve writing or drawing in that sketchbook of his.
SECONDARY PHYSICIAN: Dr. Henry Pym, MCR # 32341-REDACTED
His hair had been cut, face shaved, and body washed by med techs, but Tony saw a different man before him. As though superimposed over reality, like a movie theater projection, he
For now, though, he wasn't doing anyone any good. He was burnt out. Exhausted and cold, he shivered and saved his work for the night. He had finished studying the samples and moved on to building the machine meant to use the samples as a scent to track down Dimension Z so his workbench was strewn with small parts and tools and bits of wire.
LABORATORY RECORD
in the pocket of his jeans on the floor.
Steve guiltily shifted his weight. He was dressed in casual clothes, jeans and a button down shirt with a visored hat that kept his face in shadow. Over the course of the past few weeks, he’d seemingly made an attempt to keep up shaving, but he always went too long between remembering, so there was always a layer of stubble on his jaw and cheeks. It was the way Steve dressed when he was trying not to be noticed.
“Did you do something?”
“It’s him,” Jet said, overjoyed. “Steve’s
By the time he returned to the tower, the sky was grey with light. He slipped into bed, leaving the flier folded up
“Is he going to be okay?”
Part of him had become feral in that other place, and it refused to change back.
But did he know? It was impossible to read Steve. Tony felt a pang of loss, even though he knew it was unfair. He’d blinked and lost his best friend for a decade without having a chance to stop it. A decade of distance between them, Steve growing and changing as anyone would over time, exacerbated by the extreme and traumatic nature of his experience. They’d know each other anywhere, in life or death, but it was almost like sitting across the table from a stranger. An old friend, awkwardly trying to figure out where to start catching up. It was formal in a way that defied the intimacy they used to share.
Steve put down his book, face down in his lap. “Where is this?”
“Not that I’ve heard, but Fury’s pissed at me so no one’s telling me jack shit.”
“Why do you bring yourself here? Some part of you must want to tell your story. Would you feel that that’s true?” she asked in a gentle voice.
“I love you.”
Jet had been the daughter of Zola, apparently, though Steve was hesitant to speak more on that particular point for some reason. After killing Zola, and after Sharon died, they both made it through the portal home— this much, at least, Tony already knew. But Jet convinced Steve that his war memorabilia and other relics of his first life were holding him in the past.
"Tell me," Steve demanded. He got to his feet and felt ridiculous, standing there naked with such a serious face. There was a burning feeling in the pit of his stomach like he was going to be sick. He had Tony hadn't fought in so long-- at least in his perception of time-- and it was starting to feel like a fight.
“Hey ya, Cap.” Tony said with a chuckle that crinkled his nose and then Steve was pulling him into a kiss.
Tony gave him a sharp grin. “Well, as you know, I aim to please.”
Things were good in Timely and Tony dared to hope they'd stay that way for once.
Tony nodded understandingly. “It was cancer for me.” Tony touched his temple. “Inoperable brain tumor. Figured I'd go out with a bang while keeping the world safe rather than dying in hospital bed.”
Tony seemed to see the indecisiveness on Steve's face. “Hands and knees, then. You can watch as I open myself up.”
“Steve?” Tony mumbled out sleepily, eyes opening up a fraction.
Natasha eyes twinkled in amusement. "That's something you'll need to ask Steve."
Tony Stark. Infamous weapons manufacturer. Tony himself rarely talked about his past and Steve had gathered most of his information about Tony from the town rumor mill.
Tony pouted and turned back to his own dish.
Tony smiled drunkenly at him. “So what brings you down here?”
Tony jumped so bad, he nearly spilled his drink, half of it sloshing over the rim and coating his hand in alcohol.
Tony gave her a wide grin as he sat down in the rolling chair and wheeled it over. “This is hardly the weirdest thing that's happened to me. Besides, it's not all bad news with such pleasant company as your own.”
Tony gave him a sad smile. “But just how many more people have they killed? I can't wash all that blood off my hands, I can't.”
Steve settled his hands on Tony's hips and led the kiss, plunging his tongue into Tony's mouth. Tony shifted closer in his lap and Steve could feel his cock begin to take an interest.
Tony smiled. “Is there any way I can use my sob story to get a pity fuck? It's been a long standing fantasy of mine to sleep with myself.”
Natasha glared at him. "FRIDAY, scan his radiation signature."
“It really wasn't.” Natasha admitted. “My parents died when I was nineteen and the board and shareholders were... reluctant to give me the reigns, to say the least. I've been proving their crusty asses wrong ever since.”
Tony gave Steve's face a lingering look before nodding and positioning himself in the middle of the bed on his hands and knees. “Ready when you are.”
"Why?" Pepper asked. "What is it?"
"Thank you," he said as he took the glass from her.
Five minutes later and Freeman was still standing in line for breakfast. For a second, Natasha wondered if they had read too much into Freeman's behavior. Then she heard a cell phone ring. Freeman was the one to pull his mobile device from his pocket and answer the call.
"You still let it all happen," Stark said.
"Don't mention it." Lara then turned and grabbed her coat before heading for the elevator herself. "Be right back," was all she said before the elevator doors closed, leaving Tony alone to wonder and worry.
"Who?" Lara's brows knitted together.
It was rare for him to fall asleep at such an early hour of the evening, and even rarer to wake up at such a late hour of the morning. When he did awaken, it was to a tarp haphazardly thrown over him, a smoothie waiting on the table for him, a colossal mess in the kitchen from the making of said smoothie, the perpetrator of said mess standing by for approval (he'd give DUM-E a B- for effort), and that he had exactly twenty-two minutes to shower, get dressed, and get across town before the board meeting started. Impossible odds, but Tony figured he could make it if he rushed through the shower and ignored all the speed limits set forth by the State of California Highway Department.
"Well, that was unexpected," Cranston commented.
"Of course, we're still here, Commander," Steve said graciously. "Barton's a member of our team. We want to know that he's okay."
Resisting the urge to cough is never easy. Your body wants to rid itself of all the fluids, irritants, foreign particles, and microbes that gather in your lungs and breathing passage. It does so by forcing you to exhale quickly in a sometimes-violent fashion. It's even worse when you're sick. Not only is there an increase in mucus production that can cause a post-nasal drip to occur, but the throat is also irritated by whatever viruses and/or bacteria causing the ailment making it even more difficult to keep yourself from coughing. By suppressing a cough, you are preventing your body from clearing your airway, which only increases the urge to cough. The point is, it's never a good idea, especially when your lungs are working at a diminished capacity because there's a hunk of metal in the middle of your chest preventing them from properly expanding, like Tony.
Of course, it was the Peoples Unity Church. SI security and the NYPD were escorting them out, causing the commotion. Lara forced herself to keep her eyes fixed forward and focused on the lyrics rather than the yelling. For one second, she thought that she heard someone calling her name, but she dismissed it as a trick of the mind. …Until she heard it again and again, and it quickly fell into time with the music.
"It's not your fault," Rhodey said. "You couldn't have noticed. That jackass was keeping your focus on him, and he completely avoided looking at the camera to keep himself from being exposed. He did this to hurt you. You couldn't have known."
"Hey," Bruce had said. "Wait for a second, where's Freeman? Didn't anyone tell him we were going?"
"You're right, you don't! Get your ass back inside." Clint spluttered.
"JARVIS, can you turn out the lights?" Almost as soon as the lights went out, Steve could hear Tony's soft breathing, indicating that he was asleep.
On cue, the two of them paused to see if they could hear Tony waking up. The bathroom remained eerily quiet. Lara sighed and looked at Steve.
"Yeah," Tony agreed as he got up off the ground. As he pulled himself up, he could feel Steve put his hand on his lower back, probably to help steady him as he got up. This time Tony didn't brush off the touch or push him away, but he still tried to ignore how tight the simple touch made his chest. They had jobs to do, after all.
"Do you need a hand getting up?" Initially, Tony was going to refuse, but as he started to sit up, dizziness overcame him. He knew right away that he wouldn't be able to stand on his own and took the offered hand. Carol helped to steady him as he slowly stood up and she wrapped her arm around his shoulders to help him keep balanced. "You steady there?"
"What the hell?" Tony said. "What are you doing?"
"I told them," she said. "I didn't think it was a secret I could sit on for very long."
"So, you had dinner downstairs with everyone else?" Steve asked.
"And what is happening here?" Stark asked.
"No ma'am," Dr. Griffith said. "Only you, Mr. Stark, and the head of security have the clearance to declare a lockdown. The other two aren't here yet, so I was sent to get you." Pepper nodded and stepped out of her office to address her assistant.
"Right," the woman dragged out the word. "Well, I'm Amanda and I'm from this hospital's registry department. I just have a few questions about the information you provided us with when you checked in."
"Well," Pepper said. "Assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works."
Tony went over to his desk and pulled out a spare set of clothes from the bottom drawer. He always kept a spare set in there in case the clothes he was wearing were badly singed in another fire or he spilled hazardous chemicals on them again. He made quick work of changing into the jeans and was just about to pull the t-shirt over his head when he heard a knock at the glass door. Turning around, he saw Steve and Natasha standing there, Natasha motioning for him to let them in. He slipped his head and arms through the proper holes and went to the door, the entire time trying to convince himself that he wasn't really wobbling that much.
Greek yogurt. That had to mean it was easier to break down, right? Steve seemed skeptical about that argument but given his unfamiliarity with modern food science and standards, he let it go.
"Ah, the age-old question…"
Remember kids, the cloud is a lifesaver!
When he opened his eyes again, he ended up spotting a familiar face. Standing near the exit at the top of the stairs, he caught sight of Fury standing next to a blonde-haired woman wearing an Air Force dress uniform. It took a second for his mind to put together that it was Carol. He knew the others had spotted Fury as they all gave him nods of acknowledgement as they walked past, but none of them seemed to take notice of Carol. Tony did, though, and caught the little wave she gave him as he passed by. He gave her one back.
"I wish you the best of luck with that, my friend," Clint muttered to himself.
She tried to regain her composure. She needed to get up and help people. However, it was only when the ship started tilting sideways that she was able to start coming to her senses. Fury's words in her ear did the rest of the job.
Walking into the room, Tony was surprised to see Steve staring in the direction of the door like he had been expecting someone to walk through it. Tony shrugged it off and crossed the room to the metal chair he previously occupied and sat down.
After a little bit, Tony heard a knock on his door. He tried to ignore it, but the person on the other side kept at it. Eventually, they gave up with just knocking and eventually said "Tony, it's Peggy. Are you still in there? Can you please open the door?"
Feeling all the air leave her lungs at once, Lara took a few steps back and momentarily froze up. An unknown number of highly-trained S.H.I.E.L.D. agents against one former Secret Service agent who already had pain in her abdomen flaring up from where her bullet wound scar was. The odds weren't in her favor. She only snapped out of it when she remembered that her best chance to survive was to deny them access to her location. Taking a deep breath, she sprinted down the hall and ran into the first room she saw.
"Nope," Coulson said. "I've got Stark. You get the big guy." Natasha stopped dead in her tracks. She knew exactly who he meant, and she let out a curse in a language she knew Coulson didn't understand. Well, she didn't think it was possible, but her night was just about to get even more exciting. Great.
"Sir, Miss Conroy is at the front door," JARVIS said.
"Please," he said. "I'd rather receive a nasal enema than have to sit through another minute…"
"Thank you." Fury mirrored his nod.
"Like that, I'm an abuser." Surprisingly, Bruce didn't have any visible reaction to that statement.
Lara froze for a few seconds, her eyes on Pepper. She didn't look too hurt, thankfully, which gave her some relief. However, it didn't stop humiliation from creeping up on her.
"Exactly," he said. "can you get in?"
"Can't say I've heard of it either." Lara said perfectly honestly.
"That's good," Laura said. "Do you know how long you're going to be on bed rest?"
, all law enforcement agencies – including S.H.I.E.L.D. – must issue the following warning whenever an arrest is made," Hawkeye said. "But in this case, you are not a citizen of this planet, nor a citizen of this country, so none of these rights apply to you, but we're legally required to tell you all of these rights that you do not have."
"You got seven and a half hours of sleep last night," JARVIS reported. "Although that is thirty minutes shorter than the standard doctor's recommendation, it is still an adequate amount for you to function off of."
"I'm not in danger," Tony assured quickly. "I don't know what I am." His chest felt like it was aching, and his shoulders felt heavy. He didn't want to do this, not now and especially not to Peggy. She had just said it herself, she couldn't say she wouldn't tell his parents. If he told her, she'd tell them, and Tony had absolutely no idea how they'd react. His mother would probably take pity on him, but Howard would probably want him out of the house for good. Tony knew from the second that his father sent him off to a boarding school that he didn't want him around. Now he'd have the perfect excuse to be rid of him once and for all. Peggy, however, had to keep prying.
"I saw myself getting fucked by Ty in more ways than one," Tony said. "That's what I saw."
"Hi, honey," Laura let out a bit of a forced laugh. Obviously, she was trying to keep things light. "I heard you got sick. That's…" She let out a breath. "I can't even imagine that. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. Obviously, it's not pleasant…"
"Regardless of how Mr. Fair obtained the information," the man sitting across from Fair – Harold Schaffer – said. "This is a serious threat to the company. If the thief has the building's security codes, who knows what they could do next!"
"Because you could have died," Rhodey said. "And there are people here that would have missed you if you went."
"What about it?"
"Wait," he exclaimed just as Karl Marx was about to open his mouth. Marx looked at him then as if surprised. Charles found himself to be surprised as well, but quickly got over it and tried saying more. "That… The information you keep overloading me with, is that how you speak?" That was the first thing Charles thought to ask. Marx's mouth began to open, and Charles was quick to cut him off. "Just nod for yes and shake your head for no." Marx looked at him with a perplexed expression for a few moments, but eventually nodded. Charles let out a breath of relief. That was good to know. "Alright. I'll just keep my questions to simple yes or no answers. Does that work for you?"
"Could
Tony could not lie, he felt like he was going to be sick. Whether that was a result of the emotional upheaval of his conversation with Romanoff…

"Yeah, he could, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it." Tony looked down at the ground. They still hadn't heard from any doctors or nurses about Barton's condition, nor had Romanoff or Hill returned from wherever in the hospital they had disappeared to (which was likely the quarantine area.) The longer time dragged on without any news, the more anxious Tony felt. He didn't understand why. It's not like he was Barton's best friend or anything, but he still felt bad for him. He didn't deserve to die this way. No one did.
"I know I shouldn't complain about my first day," she said. "But that was basically a witch-hunt on steroids. Seriously, I've seen nuclear deals made more peacefully than that."
"Okay," he said. "I can do that."
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do you mean?"
"Still, if it's an average commercial airliner and it's not filled over capacity…" Tony's face fell the second he saw the nurse standing in the doorway. "Oh-no, not the fun police."
"I've just noticed you've been quicker to make decisions," she said. "Like you're just going with whatever pops into your mind first."
– could protect them and lead them into the next phase of their journey.
"Unnecessary? It's keeping you alive!" Lara shook her head. "They're crazy if they're not going to cover you because of that."
"They seem pretty intertwined to me," Steve remarked.
"Already taken care of Miss Conroy," the AI replied. "Mr. Stark had me disable the alarms and inform the fire department while you were still in the elevator." Lara sucked in a breath through her teeth.
"Coulson, you know Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me." Which could be a few miles given wind conditions and altitude.
Remember kids, always aim for the head.
"Yes!" he said. "Exactly! Only it doesn't even feel like I have a clear goal. I'm running just to… Run and that's fine if you know where you're going…"
"It's parked out front," Pepper said. "Down the stairs and out the same way you came in." Steve nodded and the three made their way out of the bedroom. They were joined by the blonde woman – Conroy – as they started to make their way down the stairs.
"So?" Tony questioned. "What's she going to do?"
The line then went quiet, save for the sounds of Maria putting the phone down and typing away on her keyboard. Glancing around the store as she waited, Carol realized that she wasn't the only patron anymore. Two men had entered – both dressed in white robes – and were talking to the clerk. The conversation was very heated.
"No, it's not," Clint said. "I still have all my skin." Tony narrowed his eyes.
By the time they had gotten back on the road, rush hour had started. The highways were crowded with people who all needed to get to New York ASAP. As time passed, the sky started to lighten up making everything become more visible, including the depressive air that hung around the car.
Pepper sat up tall and straight, exuding nothing but calm confidence. Despite that, Lara could notice a few small details that most would not, like the fact that Pepper was wearing a bit more makeup than she usually did when she was on camera. Briefly, Lara wondered if Pepper had been able to get any sleep the night before or if she, too, had been kept awake by worry. Regardless, to the untrained observer, Pepper was the pinnacle of dignified composure. That was more than what could be said about one of the other members of the group.
"Well, yeah," Steve said. "I wouldn't either if I had just flown a missile through a portal to space."
"What I just said." Lara scoffed.
"That stuff he said about 'compulsive tendencies' and 'textbook narcissism.' Did I miss something there because I don't know what he was talking about?" Steve stopped in his tracks and did the best "are you kidding me" look he could give in the situation.
Loki squeezed his eyes shut and bit down on his tongue. Even though he didn't have it, he felt it necessary to exercise his right to remain silent now.
"Well, it's an apt description." Pepper's expression softened.
One, Los Angeles was huge and trying to find one single person would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Two, as far as he could tell Tony only owned cars and while he had driven a few times, he was nowhere near confident enough to try driving in a high-density area and having not had time to become familiar with the modern controls. Three, S.H.I.E.L.D. had his shield and while he had the physical prowess and improvisation skills to make due without it, he had a feeling that it would be safer to have an actual barrier to put in-between Tony and this psychopath. Maybe he had just grown overly reliant on the shield.
"I will."
"Hello," he said. "Is this Lorraine Wilburn?"
"Your house exploded," Nina whimpered. "There was nothing left! I saw…"
"You saw how I was on the plane, right?" Clint answered in the affirmative. "Well, it got worse than that; so much worse. I actually thought I was going to die, and worse than that, Steve did, too."
"I should be the one asking you that," Steve said. "You ran into the street and nearly got yourself killed! What were you thinking?"
"Steve!" His head whipped around and as soon as he made eye contact with Tony, he broke out a smile. It was like watching the sky light up after a particularly dark night; it radiated a sort of calm amazement that made Tony's heart melt. Reflecting that smile with one of his own.
"I know," he said. "I regret that ever happened, but I'm a different man now and I want to make amends." Lara scoffed at that. "I'm serious. I've learned the truth and now I need to fix my past mistakes."
"Yeah, that wasn't the smartest move," she said. "But he wasn't listening to me and he didn't want to look at me. I knew I was talking to a brick wall, so I did as he asked."
Remember kids, if you wouldn't say it to a random stranger you just approached on the street, don't say it to a celebrity.
. (Granted, Steve also knew that Tony also didn't come out of the closet willingly and had a hell of a time with the media scrutiny immediately following that revelation, so maybe he wasn't a good example, but still…) Things were still bad, but they weren't as bad as they had been. Society was slowly making more and more progress to acceptance. Steve was happy about that. However, no matter how much progress is made, it still can't erase even the basest levels of fear.
"You unlocked my phone," he said as he caught a glance at the activated screen.
Truth be told, Tony really wanted to believe that this was Steve Rogers, but there was this niggling feeling in the back of his mind that just wouldn't go away; the sense that something else was at play. Maybe not directly having to do with Steve, but S.H.I.E.L.D. had something else up their sleeves. Of that, Tony had no doubts.
"Can you do me a favor and turn the lights off on your way out?" Tony said as he crawled under the covers.
Eventually, Tony noticed this.
"Okay," Tony said. "E-mail me what you find."
"Why not?" she said. "With any luck it could have fermented by now." She walked over to one of the chairs across from his desk and sat down. Stark, meanwhile, produced two shot glasses from the cabinet (apparently Pepper did not think to take those away,) set them down on his desk, and poured apple juice into each one.
He wished he could tell him to knock it off, but Natasha and the other agent were still within earshot, not to mention the fact that they had an enemy combatant held captive a few feet from them. If he pointed out that Tony was checking him out, there was no way that would end well. He chose to ignore it. That would have worked out well if Tony didn't follow the action up with a remark.
It was a one-way trip. It still is. He kept thinking he escaped; that he fell back through the portal and lived happily ever after with his little boyfriend, but he never did. He was still there, deep in space watching the missile detonate, taking out the Chitauri ship. He was watching the last few moments of his life – soundtracked to a song that once soothed him in childhood, but now only caused him heartbreak.
"Steve," she said. "Have you talked to anyone?" He lifted his head and raised an eyebrow.
"You're diabetic," he pointed out. Lara shrugged.
"Poor little guy," she said. "Do you know if he was born like that or if…"
Before she could finish knocking, Clint came to the door. He was all smiles as he stepped out and was quick to shut the door for behind him.
He had known for a long time he liked both genders. He could never find an explanation as to why. He just did. He couldn't stop. He knew. He tried through sheer force of will. It didn't work. However, he still liked girls, so he figured he wasn't totally sick so long as he didn't act on his impulses around guys. That didn't work either. So, for the longest time he waited for the other shoe to drop; for someone to put two and two together and have him locked up in the asylum.
"Maybe they did back in the '40s," Tony said. "But nowadays we have something called 'having a good time.'"
"You have something you want to say?" Lara shrugged and shook her head nonchalantly.
"Thanks, I hadn't noticed," Tony smirked as Steve's cheeks turned the tiniest shade redder. Steve was able to keep a cool face, though, and ignored the comment as he continued to question Tony.
"I'll get it," Lara declared, swiftly getting to her feet.
"Just making sure everything is taken care of so my fella can get some restful sleep." Tony broke out in a huge grin.
"True," Tony agreed. "What else?"
"No," she said. "And you're probably not going to."
Getting access to the chemicals he needed was going to be a lot harder than Knežević initially thought. For one thing, some of the chemicals that he needed access to were rather rare and pricey. For another, none of the labs he submitted applications to had contacted him. (Which was a rather smart move on their part given that he had no permanent address and no degrees or credentials to speak of in the field of chemistry whatsoever.) So, in the meantime, he was stuck in a dead-end job working behind the bar at one of the less than reputable establishments in town. It might not have been the best job he could have gotten, but the manager didn't really seem to ask questions. If Knežević could get the job done didn't come in one day and go completely postal, shooting up the place, then the manager couldn't have cared less.
"I don't feel like I'm in danger when I'm near you." Bruce looked down when she said that.
"Enough," he screamed as he surged to his feet. "You are, all of you, beneath me! I am a God, you dull creature and I will not be bullied by…" Getting grabbed by the legs and smashed back and forth into the floor with an amount of force that probably should have killed him cut that sentence short. When it was over, Loki was paralyzed – he wasn't sure if it was fear or injury, but still paralyzed. His eyes remained glued to the ceiling as the Hulk walked away.
"And I'll probably only think of you occasionally." Tony feigned hurt.
Although, right now there really wasn't much he could do. In order to examine the letter thoroughly, he would have to take it out of the protective casing it was in and in order to do that safely, he would have to irradiate it. The hold up was that he couldn't irradiate the letter without permission from the CDC, so as a result, he was stuck in a
Lara stopped when she reached a page containing a photocopied image of a handwritten note. Just reading the first few lines, she knew it was the damning letter that had been sent to the Avengers, but that was not why she stopped. No, she stopped because she recognized a symbol drawn on the page near Sharpton's signature. It was that of a triangle, trisected by a ring. Nothing elaborates, but it still caught Lara's attention. Before she could stop herself, she blurted out "I know this symbol."
"I'll know because I'm not stupid," Lara said. "And neither is Pepper."
"It doesn't necessarily have to be him," Natasha said. "I was just using him as an example." Clint gave her a look like "yeah, sure" and Nat rolled her eyes. "I'm just saying it would probably be beneficial to talk to someone who knows how to deal with serious trauma."
"You can fly, too," Carol pointed out. "Why didn't you?"
"No, but this time it's different." He was essentially pleading at this point. "I've actually been looking into this stuff. I know what I'm doing now and I promise I won't put the girls in any danger."
The door to Pepper's office was open and her assistant wasn't at his desk, so Tony took that as an invitation to walk right in. His suspicions were immediately proven right as several people had gathered in the room including Happy, Cabe, Pepper's assistant, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent (judging by the eagle insignia on the blonde woman's uniform), a cop, a half-dead homeless woman sprawled out an unconscious on one of the couches, and of course, Pepper herself. She was sitting at her desk with her eyes shut and was rubbing her temples. From the scene, Tony could only guess at what was happening.
"You're right about that," she remarked. Clint found himself looking down as well, his thoughts trickling back to Coulson's death again. Needing to change the subject to something else – anything else – he just brought up the first thing to come to mind.
Slowly, she snapped out of it. Loosening her fingers around the knife, she allowed it to fall to the ground. She took a deep breath as she let go of Stark and directed her gaze downwards. Her mind ran through the list of breathing techniques that Laura had taught her.
"Have you tried taking anything for it?" Tony nodded, but the doctor didn't acknowledge it until he gave a verbal "yes," along with it. "And nothing worked?"
"I think Loki is trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed." He felt like he was telling himself that more than he was Tony. "We have orders, we should follow them."
"Something to kick-start the cube," he finished saying.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Exactly," Tony said, feeling reassured. "Thank you." Carol smiled and nodded.
"Alright," he said. "You're really not doing a good job of convincing me that you don't have magical god-like seduction powers." Steve laughed.
"Of course, I do." Fury opened his mouth to say something, but Tony cut him off. "However, I'm not just going to hand this over to S.H.I.E.L.D. Not until I know what the hell this is about."
Loki didn't realize that he had spaced out for a second until he heard the Other say something that truly made his blood boil.
"I just got a text from Hogan saying that you were about to do something stupid." Tony forced himself to laugh at that.
"Do you have a stable place of living?"
"Yeah," Tony responded hesitantly. "Yes, I have."
"True enough." The woman tucked a strand of loose hair behind her ear. "So, how am I playing this? What are my orders?"
Acting off of pure instinct, Lara threw the bowl of popcorn across the room and pulled Telemachus down to the floor with her. The cat thrashed and scratched at her arms, trying to break free, but Lara kept a tight grip on him, not knowing what was going on and unwilling to let her furry companion come to harm. Within seconds, the ground began to shake and Lara knew enough from her time in California not to try to get up from the ground. If she got crushed, so be it, as long as she gave Telemachus a chance at making it through, it didn't matter.
"This video was captured of him over our surveillance system," she explained. "You need to see it." Pepper took the flash drive before turning to the two department heads.
"There is," Lara said with a slight frown. "It's called 'going to therapy' and he's going to be doing that in less than forty-eight hours. Outside of that, there's nothing that has a guarantee of making things better."
"Shit," Duran said. "How did that happen? Was the video tampered with?"
"Where the hell do you think you're going?" Her tone was biting, but Clint was unphased.
While Tony was talking to the girl, Steve looked around the huge open space they were in. It felt like the future with it's minimalistic style and grey and white color scheme. Directly across from where they were standing there was a sculpture that appeared to depict a waving flag made from many small squares of reflective material.
As they began to attack the city, he could hear the people around him scream and Margot grasp tightly to his arm. Adoniram himself, though, was smiling. This was exactly what he needed. He turned around to face his followers, who once again were crowding the lookout along with a few other shocked bystanders. Gently, he pried Margot's hand off his arm, allowing him to stand with his arms out in a sort of crucifix-like position.
"Loki!" He looked to his left. Thor had landed on the balcony just below him, donning his full battle armor with the same obnoxious, commanding tone in his voice. Oh, how Loki hated that tone. "Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it."
"No, I physically flew into the Tower myself," Carol clarified before the argument could progress further. "No planes, no missiles… Just me and my physical body." Then, Carol's brow scrunched in confusion. "Wait, what happened to the Twin Towers?"
"No, really listen," Bruce implored again. "You really don't want to do that. Just put the knife down. Otherwise, you're going to be putting yourself in danger."
"Well, I know one way to clear things up." Fury pointed to one of the florescent lights above them. "Would that cost a lot of money to replace?"
"Sounds like a conversation I should be at," Lara said as she started to walk away from the counter. "Better get…" Out of the corner of her eye, she caught something strange. Stepping back to where she was standing before, Lara carefully put a finger down on the page, right on top of one of the many equations. "That equation is unbalanced."
"I don't want to waste your time." Pepper's face fell.
Tony didn't need to enter the override code again as Happy had his key. It took a few moments for the elevator to reach the penthouse as it was ten floors above them. In those few moments, Lara managed to slump against the wall and fall asleep. When it stopped, Happy had to lift her into a fireman's carry while Tony led them to the first-floor guest room. He held the door open for Happy as he carried Lara inside and placed her down on the bed. She didn't stir and both Happy and Tony were careful to be as quiet as possible as they left the room and shut the door.
"I think we should talk about it in private," Natasha said.
"Okay," the operator said. "Police are entering the building now, they should be with you in a moment." Lara doubted that, but she still gave a polite ", okay, thank you, ma'am." "Now you said these people are armed with guns and shields?"
"Yeah," Bruce said. "What were you expecting?"
"S.H.I.E.L.D.?" she questioned. "Coulson?"
He got the idea that the others didn't want to do it either. He didn't blame them. It had been a long day and they all had been through the wringer in one way or another. However, there was no way to justifiably get out of it. Not only would it be good for the Avengers' press for them to be seen attending a gala benefitting relief for a disaster some saw them responsible for, but a lot of politicians would be there. It was D.C. after all, and it was always good to get on Congress' good side. (Not that Tony would know as he's never been on Congress' good side, but he could imagine it had its benefits.) Pepper would not be happy if they skipped out on this. The only thing he could think of to get out of it without anyone getting upset would be to unplug a few wires in the Arc Reactor and give himself a heart attack, but he didn't really feel like an ambulance ride and a CAT-scan, so he just had to suck it up and go to the gala. They'd have booze there, anyways. So, it wasn't like the party was going to be totally miserable. At least, that was one of the bright sides he was going to cling to.
"Alright," she said. "I believe you."
"Senior year of college," she said. "I made a very minor mistake on a term paper and got an A- as a result. You went and apologized to my professor for distracting me and got him to bump it up to an A."
"I might as well have," Tony said. "I thought I had practically everything-proofed the building. Apparently, I left a blind spot somewhere."
There was only one acceptable way of waking up in the morning in Tony Stark's humble opinion, and that was to a lustful Steve Rogers – still bed-addled and sweat-drenched from the night before – wrapped around him and up and ready to go for round two. …Or five. …Or twelve. However, in lieu of that, he could say that eating a blueberry yogurt bowl and in taking ungodly amounts of caffeine while he watched his boyfriend fry up eggs for everyone else was a rather nice one. The only change he would make to the scene would be to have Steve cook shirtless, but basic kitchen safety would not allow that. So, Tony would just have to settle for fantasies,
"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police?" Barton questioned.
Yes, Steve was afraid to have sex with Tony. Part of that was because he was afraid, he had hurt him. He had only a handful of sexual experiences with both men and women prior to being administered the Super Soldier Serum, and even fewer afterwards. He had only had sex with women since then, so in his opinion that only added to his record of inexperience. None of that helped, especially when his sexual history was dwarfed in comparison to Tony's. He was probably expecting a lot more than Steve could give him, especially when Steve was not sure whether he'd be able to control his strength. It took a couple of times to get a control of that with women (leaving them with some awkward bruises to explain away the next day) and since the mechanisms of sex was fundamentally different between the two genders, he couldn't reasonably expect to get it right on the first try, and he didn't want Tony to suffer for that. He loved him too much to be able to bear the possibility of that.
From there, they all went their separate ways. Selvig went with Fury and Hill to see what could be recovered from Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Clint and Natasha was off to parts unknown. Though they couldn't disclose where they were going, they did inform them that they would attend Coulson's funeral – whenever that ended up being - and that if anything went wrong, the remaining Avengers had a number they could call.
"So, no change?" Coulson questioned.
. It probably had a total square area of one foot. She had plenty of room, though, but there was no lock on the door. She'd leave and find another room to hide in, but now really wasn't the time to play musical chairs. She slipped another belt around the door's handle and pulled on it tightly. If someone came in, she'd have only her brute strength to rely on to keep her safe, but she figured no matter what, she'd be toast if anyone discovered her location.
," Clint said. "Second, he hasn't been alone since I brought him back. Someone's always been with him, and he hasn't been allowed to get into anything, or tear up anything, or pee on anything…"
"Excuse me?" Lara gave a dismissive scoff.
"Thank you," Tony whispered into Steve shoulder, a few stray tears falling from his eyes. "Thank you."
human," Carol explained. "But then I stood too close to an alien device when it exploded, and my DNA was sort of trans-mutated. Now genetically speaking, I am half human and half of a species called the Kree, which is why I'm able to do that stuff and more."
"I know," he said. "You, Pepper, and Happy have been dealing with this for years and if anyone knows what this is like, it's you guys, but the thing is… I feel like I'm doing more to hurt him rather than help him." Rhodes raised an eyebrow.
This was why when she heard one of the side doors squeak open, Natasha immediately pulled one of her guns from its holster and pointed it in the direction of the defenseless nurse who just walked in. The woman held up her hands to show that she had no weapons and carefully spoke in calm tones.
"Then let's begin." Carl's face became expressionless, only serving to unnerve Lara further. She was willing to write this off as well, thinking he probably had to do that to prevent causing some sort of interference with the test results. At least, that's what she hoped. "You would describe yourself as honest."
Remember kids, only a hundred days until this God-forsaken year is over.
"Run," he shouted, but Oswin continued to stand there frozen and perplexed. "Run! You must run! The house is…"
Tony wanted to smash his head through the nearest windshield. How had he gotten here? What on Earth did he do wrong? For the life of him, he couldn't figure it out. He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He wanted to throw something and watch it smash into a million pieces. Most of all, he wanted Steve. God, why did he run away from Steve?
"Sorry," Bergeron said. "Not going to happen."
"I followed that much," Steve said. "But why would the hotel have the footage in the elevator in the first place?"
"Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting," JARVIS said.
"And who put you in charge?" Natasha asked.
"God damn," Tony muttered, briefly touching his fingers to his lips. "I needed that." It was then Steve's turn to give a flirty smirk.
"What the hell was that?" she asked.
"Oh," he said. "Thanks." Lara waved it off as she moved to exit the room.
He didn't think anything was seriously amiss. After all, he had just seen Tony two days before and he was clearly alive. However, he needed to know what the hell he was watching and hoped Tony would be able to clue him in. Despite his hopes, that isn't what happened. Instead of Tony answering the phone, Rhodey was instead met with the voice of JARVIS, the AI Tony had recently installed into his home.
"Yeah." Bruce shrugged.
"Please," he said. "You have to believe me! I had no idea anything had been taken from my lab! I've been so overloaded with my normal work; I haven't even checked on my side projects in weeks! I swear!"
Steve wasn't there; he'd gone to bed early tonight after having a particularly rough day in therapy. The lab felt cavernous and empty without Steve perched in the corner scratching away with a pencil in his sketchpad. Tony rubbed his eyes with his hands. They were dry and heavy from exhaustion. He would not admit it, but between hovering over Steve in the daytime and working on this machine at night, trying to make the damn thing work, he wasn't sleeping much and the pressure was starting to get to him. Steve was damaged. It was hard to watch. Tony wanted to fix him and that was his first mistake, probably; he knew that he couldn't fix a person and that complex trauma didn't go away overnight, but every time Steve flinched at a mundane sound, or stumbled over his own feet trying to avoid some invisible trap in the ground that wasn't really there, constantly checking over his shoulder like he expected someone to be there following close behind, it broke Tony.
Steve said nothing. He was soaked and shivering. Tony put an arm around his shoulder, checking him over for injuries.
“I’m telling you. It isn’t a glitch with the technology,” Tony insisted.
“Sorry. I didn’t want to wake you coming back in. I was just, doing stuff. ‘M just going to get to bed.”
After a moment, he spoke.
They were seated in a corner booth, tucked far away from the few other diners where they had privacy. Steve kept checking over his shoulder as though they were in a jungle.
Bruce seemed to side with Tony. “I don’t want to overwhelm you. Stress isn’t going to help you heal any faster.”
Bruce shook his head. “Not as far as we can tell. But if this isn’t the real Steve, if he’s some kind of clone or double— maybe there’s another shape shifting alien that wasn’t even on our radar before, who knows?— we have to be prepared for a hostile reaction if he wakes up.”
"Don't be. It's okay. You don't have to talk about it. I just want you to be okay."
SHIELD finally recruited Tony after a few weeks to work on the interdimensional research project kicked off after Steve’s experience. It was obvious why they waited so long, in Tony’s opinion. They wanted to give their more trusted scientists time to make every possible discovery before letting him in on it.
Steve looked up from his sketchbook.
California was warm and dry when they landed despite the sun being down. It was jarring coming from New York which had been damp and cool with rain when they boarded the plane. The private plane touched down on a runway in a yellow field. They shuttled to the house through the valley in a Jeep driven by a mustached man in a starched white shirt.
Tony could kiss him. But Steve was drunk and grieving and broken. It would be taking advantage and on some level, they both knew it. He wondered if Steve wanted that. If that was why he was coming so close— too guilty of his loss of Sharon to initiate anything, but craving touch comfort.
"I'll be okay," he said.
So they did.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, sounding miserable. He leaned on the wall, and then leaned on Tony, who brought him to the kitchen and sat him at the island. Steve’s face was flushed and his eyes were red, showing that he’d been crying.
“You’re one to talk about stealing.”
Rude. He was being too short, directing his hurt at the wrong person. He owed Tony much better than this for his seemingly endless patience, yet every word Steve attempted to produce today was blood drawn from a stone. Tony would attribute this ‘illness’ and this exhaustion to the drinking binge, which was easier than the truth. Steve hadn’t mentioned where else he had gone that night, a church basement support group that only clarified to him that the sorrow never ended. Some of the people there had been grieving their child longer than their child had even lived.
“I don’t mean to waste your time, ma’am. But you can’t help me,” he said.
but I’d rather you feel a little smothered than something happen. I don’t want anything to happen.”
Using samples of unknown metals found in Captain Rogers’ chest wound, attempting to identify substance and properties with the objective of building a device capable of locating the dimension of the substance’s origin by honing in on its structure.
“Not really. I’m just sad.” It was the most Steve had said directly. He set the water glass down and rested his elbows on the table. He held his chin in his hands.
“Obviously he did, though.”
“Can we get these people back? Can we get some space please?” Tony said, polite but authoritative. Rain plastered his hair to his forehead as he pushed through the crowd, anxiously scanning the scene looking for Steve. He came as soon as he heard, criminally speeding because he didn’t have the armor with him and he was close enough that he hadn’t wanted to turn around and get it. His car was parked askew in the street.
One night after they parted to sleep, Steve made it almost all the way to his bedroom. His hand was on the door handle. In his bed, he would be alone and his thoughts would start churning again.
“Why isn’t he waking up?” he demanded. “Did I miss a memo? He looks like a castaway from the savage lands. I saw him just this morning. Someone explain this to me.”
“Think about who you’re talking about,” Hank said. “Cap always survives. Except when he doesn’t.”
“Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. How did that mattress treat you?”
Steve covered his ears with his hands and rolled over. “Stop this,” he murmured to himself. He wrapped his arms around his chest and squeezed as though he could physically hold himself together.
“Yes, it’s definitely possible that this is really Steve,” Bruce said.
His mother told him to always stand back up. He told his son the same thing. Lying on a blanket spread out a cross the floor, it began to truly sink in: Ian would never stand up again. Steve failed.
Doctor Banner positioned the hydraulic needle above Steve’s bare chest. Titanium mag cuffs around the throat, the wrists, and ankles secured his body to the table. He had stumbled from the subway into the streets before collapsing, abandoned by the unidentified woman caught by security cameras. A concerned pedestrian had called 9-1-1, but SHIELD intervened before the ambulance arrived.
"Shut it down for the night," he said to the computer, and the lights went out one by one until the lab was lit just in the blue glow of sleeping machines. He grabbed a jacket off the back of a chair that he'd left there at some previous work-binge. He wore it around his shoulders like a robe as he left the lab and took the elevator to his room, collapsing on the bed with a deep sigh.
“I’m glad you did. Gave me time to get a head start. Eat up, I’ve got lots planned for today.” As Steve sat down at the kitchen island, Tony slid a pile of fried eggs onto a plate and put it in front of him. “Toast? Fruit? Want some coffee?”
“Maybe it’s for the best, then,” the child said in his head, “Did you ever consider whether I’d even be happy in a city?”
“But he’s not a skrull,” Tony said.
He arranged it with his therapist that he would do his next few sessions over video call from Napa rather than cancel the sessions. Tony was elated. He arranged their flight and packed bags.
“You have a lot to be sad about,” Tony murmured, “I wish you didn’t have to go through what you went through.”
injuries they encountered. Steve shouldn’t have ‘old’ injuries, let alone evidence of injuries years ago that, according to medical records, never happened.
"I'll stay here. And you can take a plane back from New York, when you're done with--" Steve floundered and his face became flushed with heat like it always did when he was anxious and upset, "When you're done keeping secrets from me. And then you can tell me when you're done. Won't you?" And he prayed Tony would just say 'yes'; it was a white flag.
Steve dropped his jacket on the floor and went to the window and opened it wide. Earth food was an adjustment, too. In the early years, eating had been a constant struggle in the other dimension— finding food, and choking it down. But, under the care of the Phrox, he’d learned which plants were edible, which could be used as seasoning. How to skin and debone a spider wolf properly so not to taint the meat. How to cook burrow squid to perfection. On the Phrox’s farm, he’d grown to love their cuisine. Of course he had missed his favorite Earth foods, but they felt wrong in his mouth, now, like dreaming of eating and waking up chewing on a pillow.
Tony seemed to consider this for a moment. “It would be possible, though, that the Steve who entered the subway could have just as well have been the imposter, then, and that this one is the real one.”
Bruce pinched his brows together in annoyance. “It isn’t magic. Give it a moment.”
“He might not wake up,” he said in a flat voice with all the despair in the world as it truly dawned on him. “No. He has to. You make it your job that he does.”
“I’m so sorry. I’m so embarrassed,” Steve said. Tony filled a glass with water and put it in front of Steve.
“I might not be in until late. So, you don’t need to wait up.”
“You have always been the man you were going to be.”
Tony realized suddenly how his invitation may have sounded and he looked apologetic. “Strictly as your friend, Steve. As someone who cares about you. No strings attached. You don’t even have to talk, if you don’t feel like it. Although, I would feel better if you talked to someone, at least.”

“Not forever.”
They both had their love lives, public and private— Tony more than Steve, who was on and off with Sharon and tended not to date many women— but they’d been on and off with each other, as well. The details weren’t openly shared, but they made little effort to hide the fact that they shared an unusual bond that went beyond brothers-in-arms. When they fought, they looked like a couple going through divorce. When they worked together, they were seamless.
“Stark!” Clint yelled at him, power walking to him. The others went silent.

It’s Tony with his repulsors aimed at him. The mask and the arm lower.
“I told you we were going to fight this
He surges forward again, trapping Tony’s face to his chest, as well as his arms. Tony struggles, bites him, headbutts him, but Steve just holds a little tighter, until Tony stills.
Tony heard a low
After that, the Witch has started to lay low, and presumably her brother. They’re back at Sokovia, using their powers to help the poor in their country, and staying out of the Avengers way.

“It’s not about our relationship,” Steve reassures him, a flashback of the time when Steve said those words to talk about something mundane and Tony thought that he was breaking up with him. Tony visibly relaxes, putting, whatever it was he was working on, down on the table. Tony moves to get up, but Steve tells him this is something he wants to sit down for.
It disgusted Tony. He’ll stick with his moose tracks
