Fifteen fourth graders swarmed John, hugging whatever leg they could reach, and John laughed.
John looked at himself in the bathroom mirror, covered in paint handprints and names written in black ink. His face was flushed, his hair a mess of curls. He spent a minute trying to straighten himself before giving up and walking out of the bathroom and back to the movie.
“Sorry to bother you,” Hamish said nervously. They’d been teaching him manners last week and he was taking his lessons a bit too close to heart. “I’m just gonna sit on the couch and maybe watch some BBC News at ten.”
“If he does, we’ll deal with it then,” Sherlock suggested and John hummed in agreement, pausing to kiss the man and nearly missing the fact that the pot he was pouring water to had since been turned into the unwilling home of Hamish’s racecar collection.
John pulled on Sherlock’s trunks. They were a bit small, hugging his arse in an uncomfortable manner, but all Sherlock did as he turned around was grin ferally at the counselor. He hid their clothing beneath a rock, his eyes never quite leaving John’s body and then he stood up, looking him dead on.
“I was thinking we might all take a day trip tomorrow,” Victoria suggested, turning a page idly. “Perhaps to a show.”
“Is she nice?”
Each girl took a comically large stack of files with them and sat of the floor across from each other- Joan leaning back against Peterson’s desk, Sherlock back against the door- and began to read through them by the light Joan’s flashlight between them.
The three-year-old ran to him the moment he walked through the door. Sherlock had been surprised by just how early in the evening it was, not even past six, and Hamish hadn’t eaten dinner yet.
He always had, hadn’t he, ever since they were children. He watched him dangle from monkey bars, climb trees in dress shoes. He’d never looked away and he wasn’t about to start now.
“Not a chance in hell, Watson,” Grace, it was probably Grace, said and something in Sherlock that she hadn’t even realized had twisted unfurled all at once.
“How-“ John tired but Sarah only smiled at him, soft and real.
“You brought me here-“ Sherlock tried, and stopped. “I thought you wanted to tell me something, I thought you were scared, you were nervous, because you were trying to trust me and you were just
“Yes sir,” he whispered and, hand in hand, they walked off to bed.
John swallowed. “Hamish, why don’t you sit down on the couch? Daddy will make us some tea, right Sherlock?” he yelled into the kitchen, where Sherlock had taken refuge.
-call disconnected-
“Sherlock!” John whispered, yanking him back. “Where are you going?”
“I want to go camping,” Sherlock said, flopping down on John’s bed about a week after they’d arrived.
“John,” Sherlock called out blindly, pulling at the older boy’s hair. “John stop, I’m going to-“
“Look, now you’ve upset Mummy,” Mycroft whispered and Sherlock gaped at him.
John sleeps on the couch. Sherlock curls up in bed and holds John-the-Bear, desperately willing himself not to cry.
“It’s okay to be scared,” he said gently. “If you do, Amelia will be there next to you to help.”
“Shut it,” John grumbled, finding them in a wad by the tent door. “This tent reeks of sex,” he commented, pulling them on and trying to ignore Sherlock behind him, propped up on his elbows and unabashedly ogling John’s arse.
“It’s our ten year anniversary,” John tells him over eggs. “On Wednesday. We should do something.”
Molly smiled. “I see you have your own forensics team,” she said, taking the bag from Sherlock who considered the statement and then nearly flatlined.
“I cannot believe you just did that!” she yelled.
John looked at the boy warily. “Will there be assassins at this fair?” he asked carefully.
“Have fun,” Marcie said and Sherlock didn’t even need to turn around to know they were making suggestive faces at Joan.
“Cool. Cool, cool,” she whispered back and they turned back to face the circle and listen to a woman in tweed pants comment on making sure all signs were either repurposed or recycled after every rally.
pulled Sherlock into her body for a quasi-hug. “It’s gonna be so friggin fun. We’ll dance, yeah? You’ll dance with me?”
Toys littered the floor, there was tomato sauce slowly dripping down his cheek and the obvious signs of two toddlers running rampant through 221B were everywhere. Sherlock sat cross-legged on the sitting room floor, a circle of train-tracks around him, staring as though he'd had his soul sucked out of him.
“Careful, you scratched it, idiot,” Joan said, walking over to lift the needle but she was smiling as she said it, watching Sherlock’s brain run away from her.
“Yeah, sorry. I’ll stop.”
She smiled up at him, sitting down. “Not a problem. Just be back by twelve, I wanna get some sleep.”
“It’s a mnemonic device,” Violet explained, straightening to cup her son’s cheek and bend him down for a forehead kiss. “I taught it to you when you were small.”
“Thanks,” Cammy said, sticking a smaller cup facedown in the first to form a makeshift tumbler. “Could barely see with the wind but we held our own. Wish those private school assholes could have heard a good Captain Watson swear-streak though; we woulda won in minutes.”
“No, you’re not,” he promised, sitting back down. “I’ll talk to your father. You can go shower.”
“Jesus.”
The two families gathered in the lobby and made their way back out to the car. Sherlock couldn’t help snickering at Mycroft, who looked as uncomfortable in his trunks and Sherlock felt. John was surprised to find that beneath Mycroft’s suits he was not even as close to fat as Sherlock teased. Harry was the only one who seemed comfortable in her choice of clothing, a green two-piece with a white tank on top.
“You’re wasted as a detective. You should have been a poet.”
“It’d only be for a few days,” Sherlock argued. “We could handle it.”
“You alright?” Joan checked and Sherlock nodded. “Did you have a good time tonight? Sorry about, well- next time I’ll only dance with you, yeah?”
But Sherlock shook his head. “No, not at all. I’d felt strongly for your father long before either of us acted. We could have had years more together-“ Sherlock paused, swallowing. For some reason his whole body felt hot. Hamish was watching him intently and Sherlock breathed deeply before continuing.
He’s on his feet before he knows it. “Sarah,” he hugs her, bone crushing. “What are you doing topside?”
John couldn’t stand it any longer and released Anthea, reaching down to swoop his son up into a tight hug. “Happy Birthday, Hamish,” he cooed and Hamish allowed himself to be coddled, easing into the hug.
Mike was waiting for him in the bunk when he got back. The boys were resisting sleep, wrestling each other into mattresses strewn across the wooden bunk floors, and Mike was trying desperately to referee, a plastic whistle in his hand.
“I wasn’t worried,” Sherlock shot back, yanking his hand away. But he smiled at John after, tiny and fragile, and John kept it deep in his mind.
“I’ll help him write a new letter,” John nodded and Sherlock couldn’t help coming over and kissing him, wrapping his arms around John’s waist.
“Never again,” Sherlock promised, smiling at John fondly. “There. Now you know more about me than near anyone else.”
And then his peripheral vision went and Sherlock gasped out. “John, I’m gonna- I’m going to-“
Sherlock flushed and nodded, suddenly unable to speak. John pushed aside the covers and Sherlock climbed in. The first few times they’d slept together, in the most literal sense of the word, they’d fought over who would spoon who- neither one wanting to concede dominance. Eventually they’d settled on sleeping on their backs, Sherlock’s head on John’s chest, one pair of hands interlocked.
John smiles at him, a ray of sunshine in black and white. “At my going away party, yeah,” he agrees, a faint smile on his lips.
Sherlock paused to think about how a Valentine’s Day card might have gone over at Eton. “No Hamish, I didn’t,” he said. “Not until Papa.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened against his will. He had been in rehab most of February for a drug overdose. A drug Jim had given him-
Shut up
Two groundbreaking revelations was more than anyone should have to handle in one day. "Two years?" Hamish repeated uselessly, glad his Dad wasn't there to call him on it.
“I’ll be right back.” He ran from the parking lot back into camp. He was not sure where on earth he was going, or what he even planned on doing, but he found Sherlock anyway.
Sherlock was sure, beyond all scientific experimentation, that his summer was ruined.
“What have you been reading?”
It was good to see you, even for just a few hours.
There was a breath, a space, and then Sherlock said,
He left shortly after that, heading down the snow-covered road alone. He took Mary’s kiss with him, the kiss that had hid in the corner of her mouth; the kiss that had been for no one else, Sherlock took quite easily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.
“Thanks for coming,” Joan murmured, grabbing her hand as they ran down the stairs to the platform. “You don’t mind, do you? That’s it’s a dyke bar? Women will probably hit on you and shit.”
“I’m not a child,” Angelica insisted.
“Oh, stop,” Mike laughed but John’s eyes had already flashed to the giant blowup slide in the middle of the lake. There, perched on top like some ridiculous windswept bird, was Sherlock, helping the kids slide down safely.
John and Sherlock shared a look as both tried to decide if a naked Sherlock tied up in red satin ribbon could be construed as a card. “No,” John decided for them. “But he did give me a kiss, so it was okay.”
They put off sleep for as long as humanly possible, watching terrible movies and reading terrible novels and building forts out of pillows even though they were both too old for that.  But soon enough, they were forced to climb into that monstrous bed and John thought that might be the end of his miserable life.
Hamish still looked alarmed so John turned him in his arms so boy and father were face to face. “Hey, none of that,” John chided, rubbing noses against his son’s. He lifted his index finger and touched it against Hamish’s small button of a nose. “Boop.”
“But it was mine!” she roared but it held no power in it, with her voice gone and her eyes starting to tear. “It was mine to tell, and you had no right- you have no right-“
“Permission to speak freely, sir,” Anthea pushed, her heals clacking on the concrete as she followed him towards the ambulances.
“Great shot, Jordan,” he smiled, ruffling his hair, and Jordan smiled back, running to get more arrows.
“Lookin’ good, kid,” an idea that she firmly denied and more firmly scorned but it didn’t stop her from paying more attention to her reflection in the small bathroom mirror and once, memorably, pinching her own, pale cheeks to give them something of a blush.
“We’ll let him decide, Sherlock says, not wanting to argue with the closest thing he has to a mother right now.
“But what about-“ the boy pressed, not oblivious to John’s own erection pressed hard against his thigh.
“It won’t go away,” Sherlock admitted and he saw Mycroft’s eyes flicker to the connecting door.
*Phone call- 6 pm*
“Don’t go thanking me or I’ll worry you’ve hurt something,” she joked and Sherlock laughed and laughed.
Hamish took her hand at the mention of her therapist’s name. They rarely ever talked about Chloe’s childhood in their letters and phone conversations, and if they did it was only to remark on how much better she was doing. It was obvious it would never really go away, he could still see that pain in the way she flinched ever minutely when the Gringotts dragon blew out fire. But she was better, and healthy.
“Papa! Daddy!” he cried, flinging himself at them before stopping short and staring at the new addition. “Hullo,” he remarked, puzzled, and Chloe stared at him.
“So, did I get anything wrong?’ he asked, smiling.
“Get off me, you-you you libber!” Sherlock yelped and Joan laughed at her.
“Hey there little guy,” John whispered gently, pushing back Hamish’s sweat-soaked curls. “You’re not feeling so good, are you?”
“I can be Peter,” John said defiantly, sitting up, and Sherlock just laughed. “If I want, I could be Peter.”
Sherlock had never been more awake in his life. Like an animal, he pounced on John, pulling various articles of clothing off.
Sherlock reminded himself.
“Hamish darling, boys can’t have babies,” John explained as Sherlock held his sides, leaning back against the doorframe as he laughed. “Only girls.”
John, obviously.
Sherlock bristled. “I do not treat you like an adult so you might pity-“
Mycroft made a point to look at him and Sherlock found himself continuing. “I told him to delete it. And I’ve been
“Piss off,” John laughed back and that had closed the book on any chance John’s snowball might have had in hell.
There are few things about Eton Sherlock likes. His room is not amongst them and so he hangs no pictures on his wall. They don’t deserve the feel of John against their skin. No one does. Least of all him.
“John, do I have to sit up and deduce or will you just tell me what that is?” Sherlock pushed.
And then they were gone, the house seeming empty for the first time in over a month. Bedtime was a quiet affair and Sherlock and John tucked themselves into bed not long after their son, even Sherlock starting to feel the strain of emotional exertion.
“What happened at 11?” Joan asked softly.
“Did you hear?” Sarah asked, coming over to John that next morning. John’s campers were at archery, their bows carefully lined up and pulled back, and another activity counselor was going around checking their positions.
“…has he tried to apologize?”
“Does that mean I can get down?” John asked but Sherlock was over the moon.
“I didn’t realize you smoke,” Sherlock said,
Sherlock woke up and for a second it was just like any other morning, her stretched out in her too small bed, the weak sun filtering in through her window, morning stiffness in her limbs, until all at once it came rushing back. Last night, the meeting, crying on the LL, telling Joan everything. Joan-
“I’m an idiot,” he whispered and Sherlock grinned. “You told me the world was made of faith-
“Second star on the right, and straight on till morning,” Sherlock agreed and John wished against hope that if he kissed Sherlock, Sherlock might kiss him back.
He gave up, simply thrusting the object in his hands at John. It was a small blue thimble, barely big enough for John’s pinky, and he took it with shaking hands.
“Oh love, please,” John shushed gently as Sherlock let out a sob, his eyes still closed. John moved three fingers inside of him, spreading, and stretching, and rubbing, and John felt like he was drowning in the pained sounds that Sherlock was making, twisting himself into the sheets.
“You could play with us,” Joan offered but Sherlock shook her head.
The specialty counselors waited tables, to give the waiters one day’s rest, and John figured it was more than pure luck that Sherlock was assigned his table.
John realized with a sudden jolt.
“Now kneel,” John chuckled at Sherlock’s face and Sherlock did, his heart suddenly hammering in his chest.
“Gloria said, at the National Women’s Political Caucus just last year, ‘This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution.’ And the revolution starts with us. Yeah, we start small. We have a few marches, vandalize some messed up posters. But we do it loudly. We show these boys they don’t run this school. That we are every bit as smart and as capable as they are. And we start now!”
“Now what seems to be the trouble?” Mycroft asked, glancing at the boys who were doing their best innocent faces. John looked about as guilty as a bluebird. Sherlock looked like he’d just come back from a murder.
“Thanks so much, Nichole,” John said as she unfolded her chair outside the door of the bunk.
Lestrade was silent for a minute before getting up. “I’ll be outside, yes?” he asked and Sherlock nodded curtly before bounding upstairs, John on his tail.
“I love you.”
Sherlock picked up his bags and started towards the house, keeping up appearances and all that, and he could feel Mummy’s approving glare on his back. Apparently that was how this summer was going to work- lies and subterfuge. John gaped at him a second, not quite catching to the ruse, and then followed.
“What noises?” Sherlock asked, ordering his body not to blush.
Harry stood, limping to the shack door, and Sherlock followed him, helping him down the steps. Harry walked carefully to the gazebo, and John started towards the door, when Sherlock walked back inside, closed the shack door, and drew the bolt.
At that moment the conference room door opened and Greg walked out with Chloe’s therapist. “We are ready whenever you are,” he offered, maintaining a safe distance, and Amelia extended a hand.
petting slave,” John teased back but he leaned in to kiss the younger boy for a minute, tongues dueling, hands digging into flesh and hair, tugging and leaving marks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m gonna kill you too if you don’t shut up,” John growled and Sherlock lost his battle to keep a straight face.
"We're talking about retiring," Sherlock said, utterly blasé, and Hamish nearly dropped his child.
Sherlock leaned down and John came up to meet him and seconds before their lips crashed into each other, they heard a small voice at the back of the cave.
“We’re going to the Opera tonight.”
Forty minutes later, John found himself in the waiting room of London Bridge Private Hospital, pacing nervously until a night nurse brought him a danish and told him a man named Mycroft had arranged for him to be allowed to see Sherlock now.
Sherlock grinned down at him, the very picture of self-satisfied, and with a groan, John reached up to wind his fingers painfully through those black curls and tug down to kiss that smug face, sucking on Sherlock bottom lip as the lifeguard’s hand worked between them and John came with a muffled scream, biting down on Sherlock’s lip hard enough to draw blood. Sherlock followed, a simple, elegant shudder, and then collapsed against John’s naked chest.
would send you over, wouldn’t it?” John teased, circling him calmly and Sherlock was vaguely reminded of a shark circling its prey.
“What can I do for you pretty young ladies?” Richards asked, the politeness in his tone barely masking his condescension. “I’m sorry about the softball team, Joan, but the budget is what it is.”
Hamish looked down, embarrassed. “I wouldn’t call it a disaster-“
“Hm, this is nice, whose is this?” Joan murmured, still giggling, as she rolled her check on said breast and the owner of it only laughed and ran an affectionate hand through Joan’s mop of blonde.
-message deleted-
John hadn’t shared a room with his sister since he was five but he found himself nodding anyway.
Hamish cleared his throat, unimpressed. ‘When you are done acting silly, we have cards to make,” he chastised and John brushed a stray tear from his eye.
“He’s married,” he said pointedly.
“I got addicted when I was fifteen,” he went on and John tightened around, trying to project mentally
It was always the same, the nightmare. He was running, running, but he never ran fast enough, never got far enough, and he always saw it, that picture of red and blood and the jagged bottle crashed down and he could feel himself screaming, screaming-
“John, please-“ Sherlock asks  but he has no idea what he’s asking.
John settled next to his, stretched out and gazing skyward. They were still silent as they turned to each other lazily and kissed, letting it progress naturally into an all-out snog, John on all fours above the pale lifeguard, watching him twist and whimper beneath his careful ministrations.
looming large in his mind. “But I can make my excuses. If that’s what you want.”
“One sec,” she promised and then yelled back into the house, “Mum! Door!”
“Silly Uncle Mycroft,” Hamish practically giggled, coming over to the bed. “It’s not a cuddle-pile if you’re in a different bed.”
“Where’s Harry?” Sherlock asked, distracting him. The two had been practically attached at the hip since their first meeting. Sherlock had no idea what they saw in each other.
part of him wanted to bundle the small boy up in cellotape and hide him from the world- keep him safe and warm and watched. He’d been warned this would happen when they’d first had Hamish but even now, six years later, he still stared in shock at how hard the child had shattered everything he’d loved about his old life and how he’d gladly let it happen.
“Did you read the book I sent you?” John whispered into his ear, a laugh hiding behind the question, and Sherlock blushed.
“Sarah. She knew what she was doing,” John smiled lewdly in the dark and that smile made Sherlock’s blood rush south faster than he could say
Her mind felt curiously blank, wiped clean from the vomiting and the crying and the sheer anger. It was that fury that was keeping her standing, Sherlock knew, anger mixed with gut-wrenching shame. Shame that curled in her belly as she ran a soapy cloth over herself briskly, scrubbing herself raw. Fury directed at Joan Watson who was standing in her living room right now but soon wouldn’t want to stand anywhere near her at all.  Sherlock stood under the spray, trying to shampoo the smell of puke out of her hair before she yelled out or burst into tears again, and felt the lights dim and brighten, felt everything sway just slightly, before she heard a crash and found herself looking up at the shower head from a great distance.
“Yes,” he declared and Sherlock never believed in signs from the universe or acts of fate but in this he could believe; in the pronouncement of his son.
“I hate when you call me Wendy,” John sighed, letting his head hit the wall behind him. The sky seemed endless on days like this and John thought he might just float away. There wasn’t much to anchor him here anyway.
“What do you want Hamish?” Sherlock pleaded, exhausted against the linoleum. “God, Hamish, tell me what you want.” There was blood underneath his nails; John’s blood was still underneath his nails from where he’d held his scarf to the wound, applying pressure till the ambulance got there.
“Wait here,” he ordered, turning around and running off. “I’ll be right back.”
*phone call 11:17 pm*
“Hey-“ she started gently but Sherlock shook her head. They sat in silence for a moment before she felt ready to speak.
“It was such a pleasure meeting you both,” Laurel said earnestly as she stood by the doorway. “Thank you so much for dinner.” Hamish stood next to her, he was walking her home, but he beamed at his parents from over her shoulders and mouthed a ‘thank you.’
“He seems nice enough,” John said, shrugging. He never was a fan of the camp gossip that seemed to consume everyone. Without access to TVs or computers, and with limited phone time, it really was the only thing to entertain them.
“John, I can’t sleep now-“ Sherlock protested but John took his hand.
“So you never told
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” John conceded. “But this is so fishy, it stinks. So out with it.”
Are you sure everything’s okay? You can talk to me John, it’s me. Mikey. We tell each other everything, remember? Is this about that Sherlock kid?
“Adorable,” Jim commented, smiling. “Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, your brother is more interesting than you,” he laughed and Sherlock flinched as if struck. “He was getting ahead in the points, you see. Disgusting. But then I pulled that stint in February…”
“Oh come off it.”
Mycroft gave him a sad sort of smile. “Oh John, don’t you know? I don’t have a heart,” he said softly, turning around. “Just ask Sherlock.”
“It’s settled then,” Victoria clapped her hands and breakfast was over. “The boys shall go camping, Mycroft and Harry shall do god knows what and Cynthia and I will go into town for a spa day.”
John groaned. “Alright fine,” he stretched, coming out. “But this-“
"Spy is a strong word," Mycroft protested, but he conceded. "Very well, how is our darling Laurel?"
“A lot?” Sherlock offered back and Joan nodded, her face so close to Sherlock’s that the motion tickled her blonde curls against Sherlock’s cheek.
“I’m here, John,” he answered and froze at John’s tone.
Joan had used up most of the hot water but it wasn’t unbearably cold and she dressed herself rather quickly afterwards. Joan was a few inches shorter than her but several sizes larger than her breast-wise so the shirt worked out just fine. The sweatpants…well, with the drawstrings pulled almost to their ends, they stayed up and covered the important bits at least.
“You are an absolute gem, my dearest,” Hamish crowed, smiling winningly at her. “You complete me. I marvel at your unearthly beauty daily, my sweet.”
“Two, max,” she guesses as they roll inside, the hallway unnaturally dark compared to the bright landing ground.
Sherlock pouted and John squeezed his hand.
“Woah, down boy,” John murmured, relaxed by the kiss. He broke off from Sherlock’s mouth and the younger boy whimpered at the loss of contact before John’s mouth was back, kissing up the side of his jaw before coming up to ear, licking the shell before biting down on the soft lobe and Sherlock was sure he’d never moaned so loud, unmuffled by John’s usually present mouth.
“Do shut up,” Hamish advised and miraculously, Bossman did. Armchair-goon failed to pull out a second gun and begin a shootout so for once in Hamish’s life, a gamble had paid off. “And big mistake calling me a Holmes; I’m a Watson. Now let me tell you how this is going to go.”
but that just made Sherlock feel- Oh.
pregnant,” she laughed and it was John’s turn to blush. “So in reality, it was Mycroft who deduced your birth, Johnny.”
“Of course-” John moved to lie, relief filling his face, but Hamish had had enough.
persuasive.”
It’s been nearly a month Sherlock and I-
“Papa, Casey and I built a fort out of pillows and blankets and cushions from the couch only Daddy said we had to leave the cushions on account of how he was sleeping on top of them but then he got up and so we sailed the fort to mars and we built a castle only Daddy said there’s no oxynagen on the planet so we’d both die but I don’t think so, cause my solar book said that they sent a rabbit to mars so if he can breathe there thans we can, right?” Hamish asked, staring up at his Papa with big blown eyes.
“No one can say the Watson family had no effect on the Holmes,” Sherlock admitted with a grin and then quelled it.
John considered it. “He’s too young for the whole story. I have an idea. Now go make tea and come back here because if you abandon me on this Sherlock Holmes, so help me I will end you.”
“Sherlock it’s been over an hour. I’ll leave you alone, I swear, I just need to know-“
and then Mary pulled back to smile at him.
“Oh fucking hell, don’t tell me you have asthma,” George panicked and Hamish nodded, never stopping in his throat campaign. “Fucking- the boss never said anything about asthma! Harry, do we have an inhaler?”
Hamish nodded helpfully. “It’s like I’m sitting under a great big sun only I forgot to put on sunblock and Mrs. Teacher said if you don’t then you get wrinkles so I’m wrinkly and hot like a shaved kitty cat that Nanny Hudson showed me once on the spider web,” he supplied and Sherlock moved to lift him.
“No, I’m officially a doctor.”
Someone official?
“He did it,” the pale lifeguard whispered to John, for once mindful of the people around him.

“Don’t be, you’re saving me from lung cancer,” Joan said with that same, gentle, patient smile and Sherlock felt ready to rip her own skin off. Joan didn’t ask, would never ask, or press, or make her feel obligated in any way and all that did was make her feel
Mary came over then, Alice asleep in her arms, and looked Sherlock over. “I have wanted to meet you for so long,” she said gently, watching him. Sherlock realized he had met his match, in this woman, who desired to keep his John forever.
and dammit but then Sherlock’s hands fluttered up carefully to rest on John’s back and he let his head droop down to touch the top of John’s and John could
"Bit bigger than the last time you saw her, isn’t she?" Hamish chatted, adjusting Annie in his arms so she could gurgle excitedly at the smiling nurse.
“What on earth is this racket?” Sherlock asked, coming even closer so she didn’t need to shout over the din of the music and the party and Joan actually stopped moving.
“Yeah, okay,” Hamish sulked and John stood. He reached into his pockets for a crumpled piece of paper and handed it over to the boy.
I miss you
“If she notices,” Sherlock smiled sadly. “We can tell her I pissed someone off and they punched me. That’s believable enough.”
“Yes Sherlock?” John said, snapping him back to reality.
Here's another nice one before a full stop at feels city.
“Heard that scientist was a bit of a bastard,” Sherlock tried to say but it came out breathless as John’s crotch rubbed against his and
“Who’s laughing now?” John teased, licking at the offered bud and Sherlock arched up into John’s mouth.
“In a minute, I need to find this letter,” Sherlock waved him off but John grabbed his hand, pulled him against the wall and kissed him thoroughly.
“Doesn’t take a genius to clean a cut,” John muttered and glared at the boy. “You really won’t let me take you to the A&E? We don’t even have to tell Mycroft.”
“He’s not here for you,” he brushes off, from posture, demeanor, eye patterns.
“Thank you, common Londoner,” he acknowledged and Sherlock looked so affronted that John had to stand and smother his face in kisses to calm him down. Hamish ignored this ridiculous display of sentiment and knelt by the fingerprint.
“Prostate,” John explained, smiling faintly as Sherlock stopped looking uncomfortable and instead looked positively wanton, pupils blown. No book had told him it would work like magic.
It got around, as everything did in high school, that Sherlock was with the dyke squad, or at least under their wing, and suddenly she was safer in the halls than she had ever been. She mentioned it to Joan once, how no one seemed to pick fights with her anymore, and the girl had just shrugged.
“We’re home, Papa!” Hamish cried from the living room.
John put the book down gently and stood up. “Come here.”
Joan had put on an album,
“Girl troubles?” she asked as John closed the door and she turned the car around. “Or should I say boy troubles?”
“We don’t have to delete it. Not if you don’t want to.”
“Never you mind,” John brushed off. “Is everything alright?”
Mycroft coughed behind them but Sherlock only tilted his head, improving the angle tremendously, and John went boneless. Sherlock’s fingers clutched the back of his shirt desperately, holding him impossibly closer, and John whimpered into Sherlock’s open mouth
“I’ll burn the

“Like I could ever forget you,” John laughed and let go, walking inside the glass doors. He stopped coming home on leave after that.
And yet, Sherlock knew Joan was nervous. She was doing an excellent job of hiding it, almost as though she’d practiced, but Sherlock knew Joan better than most. It made Sherlock nervous in turn. She almost wanted to reveal that she knew the ruse, that she’d sussed out that Joan was lying, and demand Joan just tell her whatever this secret was. Where better to talk about it then here, in the warmth of the apartment. Why did this secret need to wait for a room full of strangers? Sherlock would have deduced it herself, but there was nothing in Joan’s behavior in the past weeks that indicated she was hiding something. Sherlock had even flipped through Joan’s mail while the blonde had been in the bathroom, just to see if she could spot a clue, but there was nothing. She would’ve been impressed at how well Joan was hiding this secret, if it wasn’t so frustrating.
He simply
“John,” she moaned softly and John could have died.
“Come on, let’s get you a drink,” Marcie declared, leading her to the kitchen. Sherlock expected to see Joan there but she didn’t spot a mop of blonde amongst the sea of people mixing drinks and chatting up against the fridge. Kelsie was perched on her counter by the sink, making small-talk with a girl standing between her legs, but she grinned wide at the sight of Sherlock.
was shaking and he couldn’t breathe as that rope twisted tighter and tighter.
“To Universal,” Chloe beamed back as they drove out of the lot. “Isn’t it funny? You had to leave England just to come to the world of Harry Potter.”
John holds him, gathering him in his arms, and they find their positions with ease, Sherlock’s head on John’s chest, arm around him, and John’s hand in his hair. He could be happy with this, he thinks, for a very long time.
Joan gaped at her. “I’m never gonna get tired of you doing that,” she murmured, awed, and Sherlock didn’t even have time to blush before Joan continued, “How? How’d you do it?”
Sherlock tilted his head. “Actually-“ he started and then froze, his eyes nearly doubling in size. “Oh.
John laughed. “Don’t waste any time getting comfortable, do we,” he remarked and Sherlock glared at him.
Suddenly all of the triumph, the thrill of victory that had floated her out of Richards’ office dissipated and she was just a too-skinny girl shifting back awkwardly in third-hand jeans. The hallway felt too tight, the space too small and Sherlock could not get air in her lungs.
“Why would that change anything?” John challenged, ignoring how his heart had jumped to the top of his throat at the mere mention of the word
“Shall we?” she shouting in Joan’s ear, over the noise, and Joan smiled back at her, mouthing “fuck yeah.” And so they dived into the fray. There were people giving out signs, people selling water; there were actual children running around between people’s legs laughing and trying to catch each other.
“Not for a minute,” he warned as his body surged in pure need. “Get used to me first.”
“Joan’s soccer proposal,” Sherlock offered, her voice placid. “The team gets Bushwick’s name, use of the field at least three times a week for practice, and a hundred dollars or so for new balls and nets. Joan is coach.”
She’d stuck out the fire escape on the way out but, coming in, she decided to brave the front door. Mycroft was always at his most sound-asleep the hour before his alarm clock went off. She opened the apartment door and crept inside, shutting it softly behind her.
I may have created a Harry-Mycroft shaped monster. Do I regret it? Not a wink
“Come on,” John yawned, taking Sherlock by the hand and leading him upstairs.
Hamish looked ready to explode from excitement. “Yeah!” he cheered. “Let’s get dressed!”
I can't believe I'm doing this. *deep breath* Hi guys, I have some news.
“Oh? Talk dirty to me.”
“I’m in my last year at Brooklyn, Sherlock goes out of state. Just visiting for the weekend,” she offered and Mary made it clear which one of them she was interested in by following that up with, “What are you studying?” rather than ‘what college out-of-state?’.
“Go take care of your sister,” he encouraged. “Kids, say goodbye and let’s go.”
“God, I love you. I-“
Sherlock tugged self-consciously at her skirt. She’d overslept and had made the mistake of grabbing whatever clothes Mycroft threw at her so now she was in a checkered skirt and a top too green for her liking instead of her preferred jeans. Mycroft always liked to see her dressed more “feminine” and what did she care? After all it was just transport. Nothing that happened to this body was really ever in her control anyway.
She watched John haggle with Angelo (who refused to let them pay their bill, something about ‘old times’ and ‘not charging friends’ and ‘you know you’re welcome here anytime) and walked back to Baker Street.
Kendal went through the list in her head. Each mental bullet point was a potential solution and why it absolutely would not work.
“What did she say?” He asked.
And somewhere, a
“So, who is Kendal?” Sherlock asked, standing.
“Kendal,” He said. “Don’t talk it off. It’s- it should get some use.”
“I guess,” Kendal said, shrugging. “I hope she’s not going to too much trouble.”
“I’ll see you soon.” He said. Kendal watched him leave.
And the sound of someone crying very hard very quietly.
Kendal arrived in Baker Street after her audition that evening, fretting over the callback list that would be posted in the morning.
Then Kendal started singing, and there really was something about her, wearing a blue gown with her hair curled and a microphone subtly taped to her cheek, that pulled him into the performance itself. Kendal knew what to do, she knew how to perform.
AMY: When can we meet him?
“And this is my mum and dad,” he said, introducing the pair behind them. Immediately, the woman pushed forward and smiled, showcasing perfect white teeth behind maroon lips.
“Not hungry. And yes.” Kendal said, sitting down. “I have a song. I just haven’t been...well, focussing.”
“But you’re here now.”
She shook her head. “The window didn’t, either.”
Kendal screamed and kicked and struggled for the precious few seconds before he opened the door of a car and threw her inside.
John laughed. “You are insufferable. You are insufferable and wonderful and brilliant and I am madly in love with you, Sherlock Holmes.”
“I think so, too. I’ve been off-book for a while, but I’m worried about what I’ll wind up doing when they expect us to be off-book tomorrow.”
But still, she and John almost never touched. He sometimes moved hair out of her face or placed his hand on the small of her back when they moved through crowds, but he never pulled her into his arms or kissed her forehead, like her father would have.
Though it was much cleaner. His skull was missing from the mantle, but his violin was still there.
Kendal felt eyes on her. She was used to it, she had been treated as the mourner-in-chief for almost two weeks, now. It was wearing. All of these people who had gathered to mourn were gazing at her with pitying eyes, feeling so very sorry for the little girl who had lost so much.
"Can I help- hey!"
Kendal shook her head. “I- oh, God-“
“Well, it’s locked.” Kendal sighed. “Kyle must have when we left.”
“Acoustic or electric?” He asked, looking back down at his violin.
John Watson hadn’t moved the violin on his mantle since Sherlock had died. Everything else had been donated or put away, but every time he tried to move his detective’s beloved instrument, his nerve failed him. He felt a connection to the violin, one he couldn’t quite explain.
“What slack?” Victor asked. Kendal laughed. “And congratulations, sweet Larken.”
KENDAL: And guessing what the fortune cookies say
John’s attention snapped to the doorway. Kendal herself was standing there, her hair falling out of its curls, flyaways surrounding her pensive face.
“I think you’re ready for tomorrow,” Mrs. Hudson said, sliding her script across the table to Kendal one day. This had become a routine for them; Kendal came back from rehearsal after school, Mrs. Hudson made her tea, and in exchange for drinking and eating a few biscuits, Mrs. Hudson would run lines with her.
Should he read into that? Kendal had been held at gunpoint when she said it, so there was every chance that it was borne of hysteria.
“When someone died.” He said.
Sherlock Holmes was in the passenger seat.
“Kendal’s dad was one of my best friends from University, he and his wife Millicent had Kendal just before I went to Afghanistan.”
“Do you really think he loves me?”
“You got him?” He asked. “Alright, good. Yes, Kendal’s fine. Yes, it’s safe to come in. Alright.”
“Goodnight, Kendal.”
Then again, he certainly didn’t expect her to ask him to fulfill his duties as a godfather. And he hadn’t expected himself to accept. 221B was far from the perfect home for a child, he was far from an ideal caretaker, but dammit, Kendal needed him.
Victor was the next to pull her into his arms.
She shook her head. “No, I gave that to him, too.”
Which they did, and Mrs. Hudson graciously allowed the subject to drop.
“Kendal-”
John clenched his fists at his sides.
A man whose bedroom she was sleeping in, now.
“This is so sweet of you, really, thank you-”
John took a deep breath and walked into the flat. Kendal’s bag was sitting in his armchair, and Kendal herself was at the kitchen counter, her back turned towards him, making tea.
“I guess it’s nice to have a Spring birthday, but that makes you like, the youngest in your class.”
“Yeah, that’d be great, please.” John said, swiping his card.
And there Sherlock Holmes was, sitting across from John, a steaming mug of coffee in front of him.
She shrugged again. “Can we run the last scene again?”
Sherlock shrugged. “I can’t pinpoint an exact moment. It began to get annoying when Moriarity took me to the rooftop and threatened to kill you, but I think it began before then.”
Kendal smiled. “Better than usual. I think I have a good chance of getting called back for Audrey.”
“It’s okay,” he murmured, pulling her towards him. Kendal was light and didn’t try to pull away. Her head slumped against his chest, her arms were still wrapped around her stomach. John adjusted her so that she was partially in his lap and ignored that voice in his head that said that he shouldn’t be doing this, that he was the wrong person to be doing this, that Kendal needed someone else. He wrapped Kendal in his arms and rested his chin on top of her head.
Kendal was all that was left of William Evans, but there wasn’t much left of her. Here she was, keeled over on this bathroom floor, these choking, racking sobs shaking her weak torso.
“Why? Cuz you’re scared to lose this?” He asked, jostling Kendal’s shaking form.
John looked up at Sherlock, then over at Kendal.
“Did you text them about this?” Sherlock asked.
Kendal placed her blankets and comforter (she got cold easily, especially at night) on top of her sheets and arranged her pillows on top of those.
“I don’t know,” Kendal answered, shrugging. “Even if I didn’t, I wouldn’t have the heart to tell Mrs. Hudson that. I can’t really, you know, deny her the chance to celebrate everything, not with everything that’s happened.”
Kendal’s head lingered on his shoulder before she bade him goodnight.
Hey, dad. She said weakly. I hope you’re watching all of this noise.
“We can do that.”
The sun was setting. The shadows it cast made it difficult to examine Kendal’s expression, but John was almost sure that he saw tears shining in her eyes.
“Shherll…” Kendal slurred, reaching towards the window. “Sherlock, whuzzgoingonn…”
“Did you tell anyone I was alive?” He asked her, standing and walking to the kitchen.
The cab stopped. He noticed Kendal taking a deep breath beside him. He knew that this short journey from the cab to her old doorstep would be a difficult one. An overpowering urge to hold her, to let her know that she wasn’t alone and that they could fix the devastation together, nearly overtook him, but he stopped himself. It was too soon.
“If this goes well, we’ll give her back to Dr. Watson soon enough.”
“Oh, no.” Kendal breathed, realizing that Sherlock couldn’t see her, this was one-sided glass. Sherlock didn’t even know she was there, he didn’t know that she knew.
“And would you like us to gift wrap this?” She asked. “Seeing as her birthday is tomorrow?”
He wasn’t sure what to expect when Kyle Burke, someone who had called him about his duties (he had literally used that word) to his late friend.
“What is it that you don’t understand?”
Sherlock nodded his head. “How could I not?” He wondered, a small smile on his lips. “You- the most capable and kind doctor in the world. You should invent a career for yourself- you’re truly the only one in the world.”
Surely enough, she was right where he thought she would be, sitting on the edge of the empty stage.
And he was happy that he had Kendal.
“Mrs. Hudson had to go out this morning,” John said, handing her the steaming mug. “But she wanted me to tell you ‘happy birthday’ and remind you that your guests will arrive at seven this evening.”
Home. She reminded herself as she walked into the living room.
“Were you even going to tell him about this performance, or did he ask you? Or see a poster?”
“And...thanks. For like, you know. Doing this.” Kendal said. There were certainly tears in her voice.
“Apparently,” John said. “Everyone else thought it was terribly funny, mostly because he was such a smart-ass, and something like a hat was enough to piss him right off.”
“Your acting is impeccable.” Oliver said dryly.
“Hello, Angelo. Good to see you.” John said, accepting his affectionate handshake.
Of course, she hadn’t thought that she could do this, whatever this was, until a few days ago. She hadn’t even considered trying.
So naturally, once Kendal, who had only been in a citizen of 221B for an hour, came to him in a panic about the loss of her guitar, he was willing to do anything to reunite her with her instrument.
His landlady knew more about her than he did. All he knew about Kendal was her dad.
Speaking of hysteria, shouldn’t he have other things on his mind? If there was someone out there who believed that Moriarity was still alive, surely some part of him, some part of that entity that he had destroyed, still lived on.
“Good,” Kendal said absentmindedly, trying to forget that John was in the audience, that this was the first real time that he would ever see her do what she loved to do.
She took a deep breath and sat down on the bare bed. It was a nice room, she realized as she glanced around. There were some windows and walls and some furniture. That was all she needed, after all.
“Break a leg.” Kendal replied.
She glanced at her alarm clock. It was high time she started her day.
“In Sherlock Holmes’ honor?” Kendal asked.
That was when she felt her knees hit the floor. She curled inwards, her arms wrapped around her torso, her forehead nearly touching the bathroom tiles. The tears came immediately. There was no steady progression from whimpering to crying to sobbing, she went straight to weeping. Kendal didn’t try to cry quietly; she was alone, there was no one who would try to comfort her.
“You love me?” John asked hoarsely.
“What’s this?” She asked, looking up from her breakfast.
Mrs. Hudson sent John and Kendal to the store with a list of party necessities two days before Kendal’s birthday.
“Thank you for coming tonight.” She said.
Victor nodded. “He did. And he loved you, too.”
“Is that...that’s my guitar!”
Should he look at books? Kendal liked books, and music…
And then how Sherlock would have laughed if he heard Lestrade introducing himself to Kendal as such.
“Yes, because your flatmate has yet to finish the eighth grade.”
“It’s alright,” He said. “He’s gone. It’s alright. You’re alright.”
The school bell rang.
“Not for a while.” John said.
Sherlock hung up the phone.
“We’re going to be late.” Victor said. Amy followed him and Oliver down the hall.
“It’s okay,” Victor said, circling his arms around her so that he was holding her completely. “It’s okay.”
“He hated that hat,” he said. “He used it to keep the press away once, and they just ran with it.”
“Kendal?”
He glanced over at the half-opened shower curtain.
“Is that okay with you?”
Kendal shook her head. Even if it wasn’t okay to cry, which she knew it was, nothing could have stopped her from doing so. Nothing else was okay. She wanted her dad. She missed her dad like she would miss her own heart, and she wanted to believe John when he said that it was okay, she wanted to take some kind of comfort in the refuge of these unfamiliar arms, but how could she? She was twelve and had already lost what was dearest to her. Did people come back from that?
“First weekend of November,” She answered. “You know, if I’m cast.”
What happened if it went poorly?
Kendal walked forward and wrapped her arms around John’s neck. They were the same height, so it was easy for her to tuck her head into his shoulder. He seemed taken aback for one terrifying moment (God, should she let go?) but before she could act, he wrapped his arms around her waist and held her tightly.
“I’m Victor’s mother, we’ve known Kendal for years and years. Isn’t she something? Oh, you must be so proud of your daughter,” she gushed, taking one of his hands between both of her own.
She thought.
John couldn’t find a reason to object; Kendal’s birthday was coming up, after all, and people would probably attend, since there would be cake, if for no other reason.
And that Victor obviously had a crush on Kendal, who was completely oblivious.
He glanced at the violin on the mantle.
And how Sherlock was gone, was so far gone, would never know Kendal-
“He’s fine,” She answered. “He doesn’t seem particularly interested in me, honestly. I don’t think he likes me.”
“She’s not my new addition.”
Sherlock didn’t waste time wondering about that and walked back to the living room. He took his violin from the mantle, fiddled with the tuning pegs for a moment, and set it on his shoulder.
Kendal looked like William. Her actual father.
“She had a gun to her head-“
tall man with dark curly hair, clad in a black coat without his trademark blue scarf, stepped into the city’s streets and breathed in the brisk London air for the first time in years.
“She’s mourning.” Oliver reminded her. Amy’s brown eyes rolled.
“Tea sounds great.”
She nodded her head and left the room.
Kendal’s thirteenth birthday was on Saturday, the first day of her Summer holiday.
Kendal felt gooseflesh erupt on her arms.
“Thank you, Angelo.”
Kendal noticed that her hands were shaking, that her entire body was shaking.
KENDAL: Isn’t
“Kendal, what’s wrong?” He asked.
“So…care to explain?” Victor asked again.
“There’s a dead man in our flat.”
Before too long, there were footsteps coming from the stairwell.
“Kendal?”
“You’re not making me feel better.”
John nodded his head. For the most part, Kendal’s wishes were granted. The party seemed modest and sweet, but still celebratory.
He came home to Kendal. They watched telly together. Sometimes he came home while she was playing her guitar in the living room and told her to stay when she offered to go to her room. She learned songs he talked about liking.
“It was certainly not implied.” John said. “When did you decide this?”
Sherlock smiled. John reached out his hand.
“That’s nice of you,” Kendal said, taking a sip of her tea. John couldn’t help but notice that Kendal looked the least little bit sad. He had, on rare occasions, seen her fully smile as more than a courtesy or a facade. Her smile now had the edges of a grimace, like it took extra effort to keep it in place.
Kendal shrugged. “I always thought it was silly.”
“Opening night is always the best show,” Kendal informed him.
Kendal shook her head. “No, no, don’t be...don’t be sorry.” She looked up at at him. There were tears in her eyes, but she was smiling. “This is the sweetest thing anyone’s ever done for me. Thank you.”
To: Here’sJonny@email.com
John looks around the restaurant and then at his watch for the sixteenth time. It’s officially and hour after Sherlock promised to meet him for dinner. The waitress shoots him another sympathetic glance and comes over.
“How many are we making?” he inquired, unsure what he was getting himself into.
“Coal!” Sherlock shouted, pulling back abruptly and the record skipped a track as the jump shook the stand. “Oh that is genius, of course it was coal, no one would ever suspect-“
“You’ve lost so much weight,” Sherlock cried softly, coming over to lay his hands on John’s bare stomach.
“It looks stupid,” Sherlock said but he read it anyway because John was really good at figuring out what Sherlock might like. He’d made Sherlock try plums and Sherlock had loved those, smearing red juice all over white skin.
He knew it wasn’t normal, really, to wake up sticky and wet from dreams of your best mate. He knew he had as much chance with a tree for all Sherlock was interested in him, or anyone really. He’d heard it from the horse’s mouth itself.
And then Sherlock was gone, pulling back, and John searched for him in the darkness. He found the fuzzy outline of his head in front of his own, hair a careful collection of messy curls, breaths coming out in small pants, and it thrilled to him realize Sherlock was loving this just as much as he was.
“I wanted to go,” she said, wincing as Mycroft pulled a bit too hard on a knot. He lightened his pulls in a silent apology and she tried again. “Tonight. But I couldn’t. And I know that makes me weak but still I lied.”
“I am not a kid,” he spat out, practically quivering with rage.
“Night Sherlock.”
“Ah, Sherlock,” a voice said and he realized he’d run smack into Mycroft. “I was hoping to talk to you.”
“Ask nicely,” Sherlock laughs and John kisses him.
John felt ridiculously light. In the past two weeks, he and Sherlock had near devoured each other, stealing far more than just kisses whenever they could. It hadn’t been even close to easy, trapping each other in bathroom stalls and sneaking out at two a.m. to snog furiously behind the dining hall. But somehow they’d managed.
He'd pulled himself up on the edge of the swimming pool and introduced himself as James.
"No- Sherlock," he sighed, turning to face the man. "Nothing about this is perfect, I'm going to lose my job, there's no way I can sit there and deny everything knowing how often we've been spotted together lately. Mrs Hudson knows- now Kevin, who probably whipped out a tape recorder too while he was at it- Jesus-" John shook his head, pausing his rambling. "Sherlock, what are we going to do?"
"Is there?" John responded absently, sipping at the dregs of his lager.
"Huh, what? Oh- sorry, mate- I'm just...not with it today." He blinked at the wall, shaking his head slowly.
"Mrs Hudson, Doctor John Watson. John, Mrs Hudson." Sherlock gestured between the pair, and John hurriedly moved forward to take her hand.
"The stress of five subjects, Lestrade. It's completely overwhelming." he broke off into a quiet sob, his face angled away from his tutor.
Though the air was cold the warm breath between them mingled and warmed John's face, aware of his mouth parting slightly at a loss of what to say. He found his eyes inexplicably drawn to Sherlock's perfectly sculpted cupid-bow lips.
After fiddling with the cheap and probably broken lock, Sherlock let them both into an unimpressive room which neither of them cared enough about to notice. Sherlock was thrown off guard by the domesticity of the roles they immediately fell into, taking turns in the small bathroom whilst the other got changed for bed and moved their bags into the bedroom.
Sherlock raised his chin. "I refute that statement."
collided with his own. Felt the warmth of Sherlock's chest, closing him in against the coarse material of his tall coat. He grasped desperately at Sherlock's collar as he breathed hotly through the gaps of their mouths, pulling Sherlock towards him and not letting go,
He heard Greg shouting other teachers to restrain John, to stop him, but continued running, forcing himself straight through the double doors, the heat hitting him immediately as he clambered up the stairs, hearing his name being called by the mass of voices, teachers rushing in after him and being held back for their own safety.
"He was suffocating, not just to me- Harry as well, and my mum was a pushover, plus she feared him, so she never helped. I joined the army to get my independence, to get my doctorate and do my grandparents proud. They both died in a car-accident two days after I'd returned home from military service for being shot."
Greg raised his eyebrows, a teasing smile meeting his lips at the obvious attempt at flirting coming from the 20-something bartender, he was tall, wearing a tight waistcoat with blonde hair that flopped sideways over his green eyes. Eyes that were now looking up and down appreciatively at John's figure.
"I thought I was doing better." he admitted quietly after a moment.
"I am here to speak to you, Doctor Watson." Mycroft raised an eyebrow, as if questioning how John didn't know this already.
"It's going to die anyway," He ran after his student, noticing John in the distance turning away from the students that had gained his attention, "Sherlock!"
He dug his fingers into the wooden frame of the bench in front of him, curling his nails into the soft MDF board and leaving crescent moon shapes underneath. He barely registered the half amused, half concerned glances that John was directing towards him every so often he was so overcome with rage.
"Hey-" John snapped, tugging at Sherlock's coat at arm's length. "Watch who you think you're talking to."
"No, not this time." he squinted at the gritty particles gathering at the bottom of his test-tube.
“She’s adorable,” John coos, petting her head gently as she sleeps in his arms, all soft and warm.
Camp Baker lake stood at the edge of camp before the area turned to forest. It was huge, nearly twelve feet deep, and on a clear day like today you could see the sky reflected back off the water. The boys ran down to the shack to get lifejackets, already experts on lake time from last year, and John went to sign in with Greg, the head lifeguard, at the shack on the edge of the lake.
John kissed him and the kiss wasn’t sexual or even sensual. It was ownership, plain and simple, a stamp that read
The night of the meeting, Sherlock followed Joan home from school. In Joan’s little apartment, where Sherlock had begun to feel more comfortable than she did in her own home, Joan cooked them some rice and vegetables. They ate at the rickety kitchen counter and then Sherlock dried dishes while Joan washed, talking through an obituary Sherlock found troubling and a math problem Joan was struggling with.
“Have you been living under a rock, sweetie? It’s been all over the news,” she smiled and Sherlock didn’t know how to explain that yes, she read the newspaper every day but she really didn’t care much for any story without a dead body or a missing person in it. “It’s that big abortion case that’s going to trial. Bout time the federal government weighed in on it, abortion’s been legal here in New York almost two years now.”
mum cares about you. For Christ’s sake, you care about each other! Could you both act like full-grown adults and just admit you’re people with emotions and feelings and you love each other,
Mike flushed, looked at the ground. “It’s different then…that,” he said awkwardly and John took pity on him.
The three Holmes stood in the driveway, a dramatic parody of two months prior. Victoria was the first to move, turning around to head inside.
“Follow me,” Sherlock motioned, stealing across the basketball court and towards the brown-brick building. At the back-door entrance to the administration building, Sherlock dropped down to a crouch and pulled out her old lock picking kit. Her picks hadn’t seen daylight, or nightlight in this case, in close to two years and she resisted a sentimental moment with her whole body before getting to work.
John’s tears.
“I was recently reading about that in the paper,” he said mildly. “I must say, I’m surprised you’ve taken up so quickly with the radicals.” It was a topic change, an offering if she chose to accept it, if she’d decided that she didn’t actually want to have this conversation, wanting to yell and rave at her brother instead, but she didn’t take it.
“You were a blonde baby,” she told him, pulling out her wallet. “See here.” Hamish came over to look and there, behind pictures of all three of her children, was a baby picture he recognized from the album his parents kept in their room.
“Go get the eggs,” he ordered and Hamish rushed back to the immense fridge, already starting to hum Bloch’s
“Later,” Sherlock brushed off with clear relief as she popped open Peterson’s file cabinet. “Let’s get these first.”
!Hamish, you are a
So you see that kind of smut? That's what's in store for y'all. Summer of smut and all that. Be prepared.
Joan looked ready to die. “I am never washing my hand,” she whispered and Sherlock smirked at her, right until Joan blinked and smacked her arm.
Sherlock groans, putting on shoes. “Why do we have to visit in person? I’ve seen enough pictures of this baby to make a spreadsheet.”
John sighed. “I loved that night. That was our first kiss.”
John didn’t quite grasp the metaphor but he held Hamish’s hand just as tight. “I’m not going anywhere baby. I’m going to stay here the whole night,” he promised and Hamish calmed down.
“Fuck your good morning,” Joan groaned at her, shambling over to receive the offered coffee. “I have six hours to get over this hangover before we have to catch a train into the city. You comin tonight?”
“I think it’s best you go,” John said firmly. “We need to talk to our son in private.”
“Sherlock Sherrinford Holmes, take your tongue out of that boy’s mouth and get in the car!” Mycroft demanded and the boys had to break apart as John burst out laughing.
The doctor stood carefully, adjusting Hamish’s weight onto his hip. “I know, munchkin. He didn’t mean to be. He’s just working very hard right now trying to help Uncle Greg.”
The room erupted. Joan was standing there with a wild hyena of a grin while the girls in the room hooted and banged on their desks. Sherlock could only stare.
“What are you doing?” he gasped out.
“I’ll tell her when I get back to London,” he brushed off, only half-joking. “For the rest of these two weeks, I am yours and yours alone.”
Joan inhaled a bit shakily and smiled at her. “You could touch me, maybe,” she said, already reaching her hands into her underwear now that she’d been given permission. “It was really enough just to watch you, not the crying bit obviously but before-”
“Sherlock-“ he started to say but he couldn’t. Couldn’t form the words.
“Ooh, your pet’s persistent, Sherly,” Jim laughed from where he leaned against the door. “Read it out loud.”
Who me? Never.
“He went after Harry,” John said, his fingers working at each other. “She’s tough, you know, but she gets scared. He had this broken bottle in his hand and I lunged and it just… got stuck.”
“What makes you think there was someone else?”
“Pants,” Sherlock ordered and John pulled them down wordlessly along with his pyjama bottoms, tossing them into the corner of the tent. There was a rock digging into his back. The tent smelled like dust and mold and the sort of earthy smell John associated with camping. It was hardly the paradigm of romantic.
Especially the pictures.
“I was horrified, of course,” Cynthia added. “Mind you, I’d thought I’d gotten off all the baby weight from Harry. And here a little boy was calling me fat!”
A flashlight graced its way over the lake and its beams touched the trampoline, but there was nothing to see. John and Sherlock held their breaths as the voices drifted away and as soon as it was quiet enough, Sherlock removed his hand from John’s mouth.
me already!” he screamed and the request hung in the cool night air.
“I’m going to take him home,” John supplied and he ignored the way Sherlock’s face fell as he turned to Lestrade. “Greg-“
“Hamish!” his Papa called and ran over to him, reaching into the ambulance to lift him off the metal floor and hug him tight to his chest. Hamish wound his legs around his Papa’s middle and dropped his head into his shoulder, relieved.
“Do yourself a favor Harry,” John advised as he hugged the little boy into his chest. “Fall in love with someone sane.”
John got up and stepped forward icily and Sherlock threw out a hand to hold John back. “John, please,” he begged as people began to stop and stare at the boys. “Let it go.”
Three days past before Sherlock did anything.
John stared at him as though he’d suddenly grown two heads. “You want me to teach you how to give a blowjob?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said softly, looking down.
Dry humping was okay, they’d been doing that since February, had stumbled into it somewhat accidentally one night as they lay side-by-side in the bottom bunk of Joan’s bed, Joan’s knee in between Sherlock’s own, rubbing against each other lazily as they kissed for nearly two hours until suddenly Sherlock had gasped, jerked forward as if tugged by a string around her navel, and had come suddenly in her Salvation Army jeans. Joan had gathered her up into her arms almost at once, kissing the top of Sherlock’s head and her cheek and her eyelid until Sherlock got her breath back and could laugh into the collar of Joan’s shirt.
“Let’s go then,” Sherlock prompted and they did, locking the car and heading inside.
“That’s it, off to bed,” Sherlock ordered, lifting Hamish up over his shoulder and carrying him back up the stairs.
He scoffed. “Naturally I put him to sleep,” he shrugged off, standing up quickly. “I’m not an idiot.”
Wow. There are a lot of you reading this thing. I'm in a little bit of shock right now. I feel like we should get to now each other better, talk a little bit. How are you? How's your day going? You're looking marvelous, just so you know ;)
“Good, then this should be easier,” he assured and then unceremoniously sunk one finger into John.
Sherlock was
John had the distinct feeling that if there was a god, he was laughing at him right now.
“I never get tired of hearing you say that.”
She came back with paper triumphant in hand and the perfect little arson case that they could have settled by midnight, one am at the latest. “Put your plans on hold!” she announced, striding into the apartment and to a Joan, now with her hair piled high in a wet bun still dripping down her neck and in a men’s button-down and workman’s pants, sat down at the kitchen table with a half-eaten bowl of cereal. “I have a case!”
Sherlock studies him, finds nothing. “What do you want?” he asks and Mycroft is silent a second too long.
They don’t become sex rabbits after that first time, much to Sherlock’s mixed disappointment. There was still a large amount of snogging and some serious petting but the next time they have sex was two weeks after the first and in between they swim, they eat, they re-create crimes, they read. It’s lovely and lazy and the July heat slows everything down as they move in slow motion, taking their time.
“Maybe let’s go around and say names before we get started?” suggested a woman in a red sweater-dress with her afro combed out. “I’m Yvette, I’m a student at Columbia uptown. I don’t mind taking notes, if no one else wants to.”
“Just a teensy weesy little bit,” Joan giggled to herself. “Why, you wanna smoke with us?”
“Only four?” Sherlock teased and John flicked him with the towel.
It’s like pretending you’re still sleeping next door.
“I want something that smells like you.”
“I rather like shower sex,” Sherlock tells him as they’re toweling each other off.
“Of course,” John agreed, trying to make her feel less scrutinized. “Why don’t you show us?”
Everyone has crushes.
“Oh calm down, I barely put any gin in that,” Cammy said but she was smiling so Sherlock knew she wasn’t in trouble.
“Thank you so much for coming in,” the redheaded woman proclaiming herself as “Mrs. Emily” smiled at them from behind her desk.
Joan smiled at her across the mound of garbage between them and how did she look beautiful, even here, a banana peel stuck to her elbow. “It’s an insurance scam, isn’t it?” she asked and Sherlock couldn’t help the grin of pride that spread across her face. “I’ve lived in Bushwhick my whole life, Ms. Holmes, I know a thing or two about fraud.”
“You’re ridiculous,” John laughed. But he made a mental note to talk to Nichole at lunch anyway.
John practically raced upstairs and Sherlock followed wearily, grumbling the whole time. When he got upstairs, John was already throwing trunks and jeans onto the bed.
“Is there a woman in your life Mycroft?” Cynthia asked and John could see Mycroft’s hands clench imperceptibly under the table.
I'll try to post the first bridge chapter as soon as possible so you have something to subscribe to, even if the next few chapters are a little late in coming.
He could have been happy with that, with a John that ran with him and pretended to be a corpse from time to time. But Mycroft’s words rattled him.
“Move,” Sherlock urged, breathless and John shook his head.
“John-“ he started but he was standing up before he could remember getting up and he was kissing John gently, barely brushing their lips together. And John couldn't get air into his lungs fast enough and then they stopped working altogether as all the technicians shook hands and walked out, shaking their heads at the idea they could handle Sherlock Holmes.
she tried to explain.
, but he’d read it cover to cover, blushing the whole time. “Where did you buy that thing?”
Except, what was she going to do at home? Burn more matchboxes? Cook more pasta like the good housewife she was slowly becoming? The meeting could, at the very least, make for interesting people watching. If nothing else, it was a half-decent distraction from her own descent into madness. So, with a final slam of her locker, she made her way up to the fourth floor.
They’re lying in Sherlock’s bed, bathed in afterglow. His arm is wound around the thinner man’s waist and he finds his mouth nestled in Sherlock’s black curls. Sherlock’s breath has been even and shallow for the past half-hour now and he’s sure he’s asleep.
“Actually, it’d be by the slight twinge in your left wrist,” Sherlock informed him casually and John glared at him.
John kissed him instead, long and slow, and Sherlock let himself relax into it. Kissing John should have been something easy and relaxing after so many times, like putting on an old pair of clothes. But for some reason it never was. It stayed like fire, like the rapid heat that pooled in Sherlock’s stomach, as John’s tongue made lazy circles against his own and his hands came up to pull at the black curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
“And hypothermia,” Sherlock said, only half paying attention. Nina, oh Nina. “Tell me, what’s strange about a woman jumping to her death from four stories?”
“No, you can’t,” John insisted, holding the boy still.
Sherlock raised one eyebrow as he turned to look at his husband. “Is that so?” he asked and John flushed.
“Boys, have you ever head the story of Carl Powers?”
Sherlock smirked. “You know you’re adorable when you’re sleepy and angry?” he asked, letting John go and the teen did, scrambling up and searching for his pants on the tent floor.
“Wendy,” Sherlock teased, sprawled out on the floor, his fingertips brushing John’s. “Oh Wendy, oh the cleverness of me.”
“I’m surprised you don’t know all this,” John remarked, showing Sherlock how to avoid a particularly poisonous plant.
“What?” Joan asked, tilting her head in a manner close to comical. “Oh yeah, yeah, she’s so hot,” she whispered in sotto voice and Sherlock could see Mary smirking around the cigarette she’d just lit at the bottom of the stairs. “I’ll call you tomorrow. Love you.”
“Great girl, Sarah,” John smiles, coming up. “We worked together two years, if you’ll believe it. Felt like centuries.”
Hamish laughed at him, "Her name is Laurel, Uncle, and you know that; don't pretend you don't spy on me."
“I moved on to cooking at some point, but baking always stayed a passion,” he confessed, stirring the chocolate as it melted. “Till this day though, your father won’t eat a thing I make. Afraid I’ll poison him, I expect.”
“Don’t worry, I’m leaving,” he says, handing her a tenner for her troubles. He walks out of the restaurant and texts Sherlock.
were supposed to be sharing?”
“Uh hu,” Hamish nodded emphatically, gesturing with his free hand. “I sit on the K!”
the last night of camp.
“You guys don’t have to wait for me,” she laughed and everyone laughed too because yes, of course they did. “Okay, few words of review before we get started. There’s a massive action in Times Square on Monday against the Vietnam War. NYRF, that’s the New York Radical Feminists- thanks for the look Marcie- is gonna be there and we’re planning on joining them later in the day after class. Today’s meeting is mostly to make signs and learn some protest songs, but also to brainstorm on how we can bring parts of the protest back here. Any questions?”
Sherlock felt the edges of her eyes start to itch and she swiped at them viciously before stuffing her hands in her lap.
John wasn’t sure how he ended up in a bed upstairs with Mary, his shirt somewhere in the floor, her hands on his chest. He may have had a few beers by that point and things were a
Both brothers looked at each other, unsure if a joke lay somewhere in there, when Victoria added,
“Well then we’ll have to go to Uncle Greg!” he declared, heading towards the door.
John reached up a hand to wrap around the nape of Sherlock neck, fisting in his hair and pulling the teen closer. They bodies pressed together, chest to chest, and John could feel his shirt slowly soaking through as Sherlock practically melted into him, devouring his mouth with a single-minded passion. He could hear the sounds of people laughing and splashing in the water not two feet away, and for some reason that made it all unbearably hotter, the idea that they could be caught any minute.
“I’ll tell you later,” Annemarie promised. “Now go.”
“Probably,” he agreed and John shuddered.
*phone call 11 pm*
“I just thought-“
“Frig yeah, Watson. Stick it to the man,” the broad-shouldered boy cheered as he let Joan go and kept heading towards his locker.
“I used to think you were
“Dating,” John finished unnecessary and Sherlock only gaped at him. “What if we
Harry’s wedding is absolutely beautiful. The brides both wear white, Clara in a signature long, flowing gown that sweeps out around her and makes Harry’s breath hitch when she sees it, and Harry in a loose white sleeveless pantsuit that makes her look taller and sets of her honey skin.
Hamish ran downstairs to open the door before Mrs. Hudson could get to her and there stood Laurel, radiant in a baby-pink sundress with her hair pinned back behind her. She smiled nervously at him.
John felt a twinge of longing for his days back in the army, undergoing abduction training. Who would have thought his professional drill sergeants would have nothing on a six-year-old.
“It’s small, and we’re always undersupplied, so try and reuse, if you can,” he tells her, and she nods.
with each other. John realizes. Victor keeps up with Sherlock in a way he never could, finishing his thoughts instead of prompting them. John watches as they smile at each other, exchanging thoughts almost telepathically. It takes everything he has not to run screaming from the room.
“He’s burning up,” Sherlock offered in lieu of an explanation but that seemed to get John’s attention. Wordlessly, the doctor leaned over to switch on a lamp and the room was bathed in a soft, yellow glow. Hamish had stripped off his pyjama shirt and was flushed, breath coming in stuttering behind his thin ribs.
“You kissed,” Sherlock says from the armchair, looking out the window. “Back in Afghanistan, you kissed.”
It’s okay Mycroft. It’s okay.
“How was the honeymoon?” John asks, even though they’ve been back months.
“You were marvelous Hamish, an absolute wonder,” his Pa gushed and his Da reached behind him to ruffle his hair.
“Were you just going to keep telling me she was away for work?” Sherlock asked
“Sherlock, please, they monitor these calls.”
The cold spell didn’t stop the soccer team, who still came out to practice three times a week as the weather turned ugly and the turf began to freeze over.
Joan handed her the bundle and Sherlock took them and forced open the front door. Normally the very imagining of Joan inside her apartment made Sherlock feel ill but she’d already been sick enough for tonight, she thought as they tramped up the apartment building stairs and to her door. She didn’t have the energy. But as Sherlock opened her door and crossed inside, she could only see the apartment from Joan’s eyes. Lumpy red couch at the center of a bare living room, scratched-up kitchen table that came with the apartment. One short hallway that led to a bathroom and her own bedroom, the white paint peeling at the ceiling. It was neat, Sherlock supposed, but only because they hardly had belongings to be strewn about.
“Odd,” John agreed, looking pointedly at Sherlock, but his husband revealed no answers. Some secrets were better left buried.
she was determined to get through the entire Beatles discography with Sherlock by the end of the term- and Sherlock had cut some potatoes into little wedges so they could make fries. While they’d cooked, Joan had grabbed her hand and they’d danced a little bit in the living room to
“Even more,” he assured the child. “And we love you most of all.”
“It’s about John.”
“You don’t have to do anything baby, that can be just for you,” Joan said, which Sherlock had known she would, and this return to normalcy, to the realm of things Sherlock could anticipate calmed her enough to sit up and run her fingers through her own hair.
that was John Watson. It seemed to defy any and all laws, how perfect he was. Sherlock suspected desire was dulling his senses, hated it and then loved it. “I want to fix people, you know? Help them.” He turned his eyes on Sherlock, all flushed and tousled. “What about you?”
Sherlock grinned. “No. But you know what they say. Good things come to those who wait,” he said and John let the lifeguard kiss him, quickly and gently.
“Shhh,” John hushed, desperately trying to calm the younger boy with kisses, the kind that generally left Sherlock spinning.
“Regardless, this is all too posh. Come, I’m sure you can fit into some of my jeans,” John said, turning to the connecting door.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s a long drive,” he admitted and John sat next to him, shaking his head. Mycroft and Harry took up the seats across from them and Sherlock was surprised to see his mother and Cynthia take the far wall, leaning against the partition.
“I’m sorry I didn’t let you help. I just knew you would find the answer right away and I wanted to find the answer myself,” he explained and Sherlock seemed markedly soothed by the apology, kissing Hamish an unprecedented second time.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, having genuinely forgotten for a minute why she’d been hell-bent on distracting them all day before it all suddenly rushed back to her.
Your house, twenty minutes. I’m bringing alcohol. There may or may not be James Bond films involved.
John looked up at him from under heavy eyelids and Sherlock swallowed. “This is gonna be our foreplay, okay?” John asked and Sherlock bit his lower lip.
“Sherlock-“ John gasped and Sherlock’s hands splayed across his naked chest, pinching his nipples until their hardened under his fingertips, rolling them until John moaned, loud and unheard in the dense trees.
“Show me,” she demanded and Sherlock turned on his phone before handing it to her- Hamish was his background. She studied the picture of the black-haired boy for a minute before nodding. “He looks nice,” she agreed and John smiled.
The mad genius stepped back, for the first time realizing his mistake. “Sherlock, who and what are you?”
“Does anyone ever say yes to that question?” John asked and the waiter shook his head and left.
“Four months ago,” John said. “He’d been acting strange for days, worse than usual. Then he attacked Mum…” John wanted to stop, wanted to leave it right there. But he was
“That’s good,” she answered, unsure of herself. “Are they coming to pick Hamish up now or-“
“Did you call Lestrade?” Hamish heard John yell, muted.
They mde their way to the dance floor, hands interlocked, until they found an empty spot. Sherlock turned to face John and followed his lead, settling his hands on John’s shoulders as John’s fluttered to his hips.
Love you, Harry.
“Sherlock Holmes, as I live and breathe,” a voice drawled from the back and Irene stepped out next to Mike.
Soon,
“Well done freak; even your own kid is scared of you,” Sally hissed but John shushed her. Sherlock looked like he’d been slapped. He stood, staring at the open doorway, his face slowly sliding from angry to horrified.
“I like him,” she smiled and reached out on taloned hand to take Sherlock’s arm. “You have a drink yet?”
Sherlock only pouted. “Or we could just wait a day,” he said sullenly and Hamish’s smile was radiant.
“Daddy!” the small boy cried, squeezing the blood out of Sherlock’s legs. “I didn’t even hear you come home on account of how I was super sorbed in my project and also you can be quiet as a Mycroft.”
“Evening,” She said, walking into the flat.
“G’night, John.” She said, her mouth full. “G’night, Sherlock.”
Mrs. Hudson wanted to throw Kendal a party.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. None of it was supposed to be like this.
And as rehearsals wore on, Kendal wasn’t just grateful for her role, she was downright relieved. It felt almost normal to have a script in her hands again, to be lost in something other than her own thoughts.
Kendal, her face white and her eyes wide, nodded her head. John tried to smile and left.
“Kyle’s on a train bound for Dublin right now.” Kendal said. “He has a conference call in about an hour.”
Victor snickered. “He came to the show and mum said he couldn’t stop smiling. I think that’s evidence enough.”
Kendal didn’t like him. That was obvious.
“He’s not my father,” Kendal said almost sharply.
“Of course I do.” Sherlock answered. “Goodness, I thought you knew, I thought it was implied.”
Kendal nodded her head. Sherlock reached out and starting rubbing her shaking arms.
“Fine, and yes please.” Kendal answered. “How was work?”
The next morning, it was business as usual. Kendal ate her cereal and drank her tea and bade him goodbye.
“Is he nice?” He asked.
Her dark curls bounced on her shoulders as she escaped to her bedroom.
And that’s how dinner went on; John told Kendal his stories, watching the light of the candle flicker, creating a soft light on her pretty, smiling face.
She thought about the night that she found new shampoo in the shower, how John had seen what scene and brand she liked and bought new bottles, how she had cried and how he had held her without any prompting.
After placing her makeup, curling irons, hair brush, and headbands (Kendal had been looking for ways to dress hair for years. It was a thankless task; there was no way to dress up hair that was both brown and straight) on the vanity, there was only one box left.
John Watson wasn’t Kendal Evan’s father.
John took out his cell phone and scrolled through his contacts, looking for a number he hadn’t called in almost two years.
“It’s your birthday,” John reminded her.
Sherlock ignored the urge to roll his eyes.
John dropped into his armchair. Sherlock sat in his.
“I know,” John sighed. “Look, Sherlock, Kendal and I- Kendal and I can go. We can find a flat somewhere else, I’ll still-“
“I want to go home.” Kendal said, wiping her eyes.
Soon enough, she was making her way through the crowd, wearing a black skirt and Chuck Taylors with a tee shirt bearing the show’s name and showtimes. Victor was behind her, as were two adults he assumed were his parents.
“You have callouses on your left hand, but only on the tips of your index, middle, and ring fingers, the exact digits you need to play basic guitar chords. Given your age and the size of your hands, it wouldn’t make any sense that you would be playing barre chords quite yet, and you’ve got smaller, similar callouses forming on your right hand, because you’ve just begun to learn picking patterns-“
John shook his head and turned back to his tea. He couldn't deal with that just now.
John’s heart broke. “Oh Sherlock,” he whispered, reaching out to wrap the impossible boy in a hug, holding him close. Sherlock folded in like a house of cards, wrapping his long arms around John’s back. “At least I’ll get to meet Mycroft,” he tried to joke but Sherlock only kissed his ear.
“Sherlock, when you and Hamish are done, supper is ready!”
“Now you have two choices,” John said, releasing him. “You can suck me off kindly right here, or I can make good on my threat to have you moan gorgeously while I touch myself. Your choice.”
The boy stumbled back and before he could get up and retaliate, John had him by the chain around his neck, holding him close.
“I was beginning to lose hope after the birth control failed,” she admitted. “You are lucky I have such faith in you, John.”
“That’s not what people usually say,” Sherlock confessed.
, Sherlock had known he would but he was surprised by what John
Sherlock stared in shock at the teen, a boy who so profoundly
Instead, he lit five cigarettes at once and attempted smoking them together, nowhere near the same high, but enough to send his brain spinning and glue him even further to the floor as the nicotine sank into his bloodstream.
Sherlock was quiet again, his eyes landing on the shined reflection of his shoes. "I would."
He doesn't. In fact, when John looks back to him, his gaze is intense and involved. "I don't think I could, actually." fingers skittering across the worktop.
"Plus, you'd probably follow me to wherever I ended up, anyway." he teased.
The young man appeared in the doorway of the kitchen, dressed in a polo shirt, dark wash jeans, and sporting a navy fedora which seemed to be taming down the wildness of his curls which were sticking manically to his forehead.
Piercing blue eyes snapped up to meet his immediately.
"We need to blend in," Sherlock mock-hissed at him, looking at him from under his eyelashes as he fingered through the racks of various coloured tartan kilts. "Look, John, this one is your size." he said, pulling out a worn orange and pink crossed kilt.
"Allow me." Mycroft said and turned, his eyes on the ground, but hands outstretched to receive Lestrade's jacket.
"Do you really care?" Sherlock asked eventually, sharp eyes scanning for any clues he could get from John's expression on whether he should make the move to push them both over the edge.
"What?" John turned to him, "I can't keep an entire beard, Sherlock, I'll look like a caveman." he sighed, adding a muttered sentence as an afterthought "A 600 year old caveman."
"Is it?" Sherlock asked, his eyes narrowed. He stood with his hands in his coat pockets, knuckles moving under the fabric, his legs spread a shoulders width apart. "According to Mycroft, we have gone way past inappropriate already."
"Indeed," Sherlock hollowed his cheeks on the inhale, swaying his weight to the other foot and sliding his hand into his suit trouser pocket, canting his hips slightly forward and saying nothing in return.
"Me? I have no fears," John stuck out his tongue. "Come on, Sherlock, trust me." he said seriously, holding out a hand to the man.
Sherlock watched him for a few seconds, and then pushed down the handle. "How would I possibly know that?" he questioned, and then left with a click of the shutting door, leaving Dr John Hamish Watson completely and utterly confused.
"Anywhere would be better than here right now," John picked at his nails. "The further away, the better."
"Scotland." The surprisingly deep voice returned.
"Okay..." Greg said, uncertain, as if questioning himself. He looked back towards the man opposite him, taking in Mycroft's cool exterior, the one that must be internally harvesting so much pain.
"Yes."
Without realising his feet were taking him into a new room, Greg nearly tripped at a raised door-step, only being able to stop as Mycroft threw an arm across to prevent him from falling. Only then did he realise where they were.
"A what?" Sherlock stared over at him with a look close to horror.
John grinned, "Good," and kissed him again, Sherlock's fingers flying to the button-zip of his jeans, tugging them down over the globes of his ass. John kicked his jeans off and returned eagerly to his lover's stomach, tongue circling patterns as his hand made its way to Sherlock's neglected cock.
John watched him trail off uncertainly, and lifted one of his hands to card through his hair comfortingly "Okay," he said, kissing his temple. "Let's just take it slow."
"Sherlock-" John warned, his voice lower than before. "Are you sure we-"
"Mycroft-" Greg's voice broke slightly, as he held out his hand. "What you're doing is brilliant. The people here work like a well oiled machine- you're bound to find him."
"I know that you're not like anybody else." Sherlock said cautiously, tapping his finger against John's thumb. "That's all I need to know."
"Take a seat, John." Mycroft insisted, and the doctor noticed a lone foldout chair perched upon the asphalt.
The car jolted unexpectedly before Sherlock managed to reverse out of a box-space John had parked in earlier that afternoon. He put his arm around the back of John's seat as he looked out of the rear-view mirror at the car behind him. The sky was at its darkest point and littered with stars mostly concealed by the foggy London-polluted air.
"Mycroft will have you deported." Sherlock deadpanned in return.
"Have I ever told you how stunning you are?" John whispered, taking in the softness of Sherlock's steady gaze, the beat of his pulse underneath John's fingers.
"But I chose this, Sherlock, you can't dictate my suffering as a fault of your own when it is all mine. It's not even a fault! I enjoy...being with you...if that's what this is. I know we haven't defined what
"John-" Sherlock frowned, glancing over to the man for the fifth time in the last two minutes. "What is the matter with you?"
Mycroft spent the rest of the afternoon in his study, pouring over spliced final cut videos of CCTV recordings. It had become clear to him that Sherlock had replaced the number plate on John's car before departing from London, probably covered distinctive features of it too, just to make it more difficult for Mycroft to track.
John recognised the setting, the background of the coach's A-line logo, and recalled the moment perfectly, it was the very one he'd been reminiscing on just moments ago before he'd come into contact with the elder Holmes brother. He tamed down the rising panic in his chest and stood forward.
Pulling back slightly, he looked up to the student's face, suddenly aware of the implications that came along with the two of them sharing a bed. "Hey-" he started, his hands stroking rhythmically up and down Sherlock's sides. "I'm not expecting anything from you here, just sleeping, no funny business."
"Best to." Greg nodded, sniffing suddenly and then flexed one of his nostrils. "Well, I guess this is it then." he turned to his pupil, meeting his eyes.
"Distinctive markings, prominent bark patterns in comparison to more ordinary oaks."
As soon as they arrived at their parking space on a small side-road, lit with a yellow dimming street-lamp, John took Sherlock's hand, spinning him around and backing him against the passenger side-door.
"Hello" he smiled sideways at John, reaching to change the station before John stopped him.
Sherlock turned to find a man dressed from head to toe in black, smart material, on the verge of casual dress, with a nude ear-piece concealed in his left inner ear.
you?"
John cleared his throat, "What did he say?" he croaked with a frown.
"Don't you ever get tired of constantly pushing people away?" His teacher sighed, trying and failing to figure Sherlock out.
More quickly than John could remember, they were met by the light of the sky, the freshness of the wind forcing itself into their lungs, causing Sherlock to begin a violent coughing fit, both of them being moved straight over to the ambulance on site.
"Are you sure?" John gasped, as soon as Sherlock had him on his back in the large king-size bed. "Sherlock- I need you to tell m-aah-" The younger man sucked a mark at the doctor's collarbone. "I need to know you're okay with--"
"Lestrade" he heard behind him, turning to see Sherlock Holmes nodding in acknowledgement to him.
There was someone else in the room.
"Fine."
"Would they wait that long to question us after such a serious allegation has been made?"
"Well, it will be weird not having you around, that's for sure. You've made quite an impression on a lot of teachers at this school." Greg slid his hands into his pockets and stared at the scuff-marks on the toe of his shoes.
"Okay. Okay, good. That's good" John swallowed, not sure how to respond. What was going through this man's mind?
John closed the door and immediately rounded on Sherlock. "Why are you here?! You should be at sixth form, how the hell did you- and how do you know where I live! What made you think it was a good decision for you to just show up?!"
Sherlock kissed him firmly, still trying to learn as much as he could from just their third kiss, recognising the temperature of John's velvet lips, the quickness of his pulse, the surprising softness of his warmed skin.
"Take it however you like, I'm so exhausted right now I have no idea what I'm even saying, let alone what I mean by the things I say."
"I've been in a similar situation before." He admitted with some element of coldness or detachment in his voice. When John met his eyes, he wished so intensely he could enter the mind of the brilliant Sherlock Holmes. Wished he could climb in and walk around in it, know what it was like to live as the extraordinary man, someone so capable of so many things, though completely incapable of others, wished he could understand, wished he could know of his clearly troubled past.
Greg rolled his eyes in return and stood, moving over to the window with his hands on his hips, looking out at the tarmac that was darkened with puddles of rain. "Any closer to deciding university plans?"
John sighs in frustration and tears after him, walking a couple of paces behind his student, long legs be damned. "Where did you even find it anyway?"
However lost the couple seemed to each other, they both subconsciously knew that their sanctuary would be painfully temporary, the moment shattering with a reverberating crash of a mop hitting the floor.
"Father knew." He admitted. "I'm sure of it, he deduced it the second he saw us after the first time."
Considering giving up entirely and pulling out a cigarette of his own, Mycroft turns to the path again and begins walking towards the road where a car with tinted windows waits for them both.
It seemed that a once white minimalistic room had been transformed and divided into hubs of technology, large screens stacked next to each other on the wall, framed by smaller ones blinking fuzzy CCTV footage for 3 seconds each before changing to a different location. Greg's mouth hung open, he felt useless in the busy room, there were men and women typing away rapidly, some rushing around holding iPads, folders, or sheets with different passport stills printed on them. They all seemed to concentrate even harder when Mycroft entered the room.
"I think you do" Mr Holmes returned, his eyes zeroing in on John's. "How familiar are you with my brother,
," he scoffed. "If you refer to that as your most prominent point of reference then you're definitely even more unintelligent than I thought you were in the first place."
The ex-detective inspector breathed into the silence, his hand moving slowly to the back of Mycroft's chair, made from old remarkable stretched leather and secured with bronze studs along the seam, millimetres from the nape of Mycroft's neck.

"John, I'm going to- Oh...
Instead of making eye contact, Sherlock moved slowly back towards the bed, sitting tentatively down the edge of it and waiting for John to do the same before he spoke. John sat next to him on the bed, noticing the difference in the size of his own muscled thighs compared to Sherlock's slightly thinner ones.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is all because of me simply stating the truth. Mrs Jacobsen
Doctor Watson was waiting outside the hall when his biology students began to file out, chatting amongst themselves about questions and answers. He zeroed in on a few worried looking faces, mostly all the ones he had expected to do less than brilliantly from recent mock results, and attempted to comfort them down from verging panic attacks with the assurance that it was all over now and all they could do was wait until results day.
John stretched with a small squeak, mid-yawn, blinking himself awake from his nap. Sherlock had the radio on its quietest setting, emitting slow classical music.
"Hello, you." John blinked, his smile lopsided and fond as he pushed himself up against his desk, sitting on the ledge. Sherlock's eyes drifted to the colourful socks peeking out of John's hitched trousers, the material bunching around his crotch and pulling tight against his thighs as he dangled his spread legs over the edge of the desk.
He turned to leave and hesitated, his coat swinging around as he made dead eye-contact with John.
Sherlock whirled around, his long coat whipping at John's shins. "Finally, somebody who speaks some sense." He bit out, shoving past a blushing Molly Hooper who was shifting on her feet and mumbling, and stormed up the cobbled path leading to the lodge.
"Believe me, I think that might be our only option left" John attempted to sound nonchalant, his eyes darted to the window as a burst of heavy rainfall began to slide against the roof-light-window of the staffroom, he tried to push the memory of Sherlock's words out of his head.
Sherlock stumped out the half finished cigarettes, rolled over and vomited in disorientation, the face of John Watson flashing tauntingly before his eyes before he passed out.
"Don't you have a lesson?" John asked after a while, hoping Sherlock would say no.
"Oh my..." John slowed to a halt above a panting Sherlock, his head falling forward onto his forearm as they caught their breath. Sherlock's hands never left John's hips as he let his head fall back against the pillows, throat exposed with adam's apple prominent and bobbing in the air.
"Of course," Sherlock responded quietly, content to let his eyes roam John's face, full of happy surprise and something like adoration whenever he looked up to meet Sherlock's gaze.
Sebastian recovered quickly, however, sashaying past Sherlock who was stood in front of the closed door, who was careful to keep his expression as unaffected as he could manage, only the twitch of muscle in his clenched jaw giving away his anger.
__________________________________________________________________________________
"I didn't know we were going to Scotland!" John pleaded his defence, throwing shoes over his shoulder from his suitcase about the room left, right and centre. Sherlock only just managed to dodge one, catching another mid-flight. "None of these bloody shoes are hike-appropriate."
Their first catch up session began with ten minutes spent trying to get Sherlock to actually take the whole concept seriously. John made him sit in his Biology class seat and get his refill pad out to take notes. Sherlock stated that he never makes notes, that he doesn't need to, his brain will register the important areas. John ended up explaining three times to Sherlock that some things Sherlock might deem
interested in a student before, and he didn't even think he was romantically interested in Sherlock, he was just generally drawn in by him.
