and he will break down the door and kill Mrs. Hudson and take Joanna, and all of this only to make Sherlock burn.
The hermit slept through the heat of the day, and when the sun sank below the trees the girl lit a candle to keep away the dark. She sat in the chair beside the old man’s bed, and though she was as tired as she had ever been, she did not sleep. She watched the flickering light of the candle, and though she was as hungry as she had ever been, she did not eat.
She doesn’t much like the weeds, but that only adds to her sense of satisfaction when she pulls each one up by the roots.
,” he says, like Joanna can’t feel it too. Like she isn’t inhaling the same smoke with Mrs Hudson’s every breath. “Let me—”
Joanna drops her schoolbag to the floor and rattles the doorknob with both hands, twisting it hard to the right and to the left, hoping to shake something loose. She’s about to slam her shoulder against the frame when her gran emerges from a room down the corridor, her eyebrows raised high. “Problem?”
“It’s the only thing in the room without twenty years worth of dust on it.” She walks over, the floorboards creaking under her boots, and touches the glass with one finger. It comes away clean. “No one’s been up here for ages. Did you wash it?”
“Oh, Joanna,” Mrs. Hudson says, her voice trembling and kind. A hand settles between Joanna’s shoulder blades, rubbing in small, comforting circles. “You’re home, love. You’re safe.”
on a blank page at the back of her maths workbook. She waits until he meets her gaze in the mirror, and then holds it up for him to see.
They come slowly at first, creeping across the alley bricks and along the white stone of the houses – thin-spun shades in the shapes of street signs, of postboxes, of clock towers and lampposts and lorries. Shadows roll towards the fire like storm clouds, filling the alley as they flow through the flames and down the walls and into her shadow’s waiting hands.
She’s never seen the room all at once before; she’d only ever caught bits and pieces, glimpses given by the shifting angles of the mirror. It’s larger than she thought, and messier. The light of his desk lamp warms the long lines of his face, casting his shadow on the wall beyond.
Then it stops. “That’s all there is,” Sherlock says, sounding very young. He lowers the violin. “I haven’t written the ending.”
, but Harry is no longer listening. She jerks the handle of the axe back and forth, widening the gap, wedging the blade further into the dark. The pain is like a bullet, like the first sudden shock of impact and the cold realisation that follows. The oak gasps for breath and fills her mouth with sand.
Moran. She can feel it now, the empty space in her mind where he belongs, the absence itself like a kind of memory. Sebastian Moran. How many times has she forgotten his name?
The shadow on the door offers Joanna its left hand, palm outstretched; Joanna stabs the sewing needle deep into its open palm, and the silver disappears into the wood. Two threads hang between them, white and black and both burning.
The sauce sticks a bit at the back of her throat. It’s richer than she’s used to, heavy and sweet. They eat in silence as the restaurant moves around them, humming with the afternoon rush. When they’ve finished, Harry pays before Joanna can reach for her wallet. “Don’t even think about it,” she says, passing her card to the waiter. “I know exactly how skint you are.”
Joanna looks to the sky, the slow roll of clouds on the horizon and the rare light of the stars. If she’d looked before, she might have known. All witches believe in fate.
Joanna rips a weed free with rather more than the necessary amount of violence and tosses it into the growing pile. “Why aren’t you teaching Harry? She’s older.”
Sherlock hesitates, his face turned towards the window. Then he lifts the violin and tucks it beneath his chin. “All right, Mum,” he says, and begins to play.
It happens in a heartbeat, in the space between one breath and the next. Boyle’s hands move to cup Sherlock’s chin, to cradle the curve of his skull, and Joanna can see the coiled strength of his shoulders and arms in the moment just before she grips the bloodied cloth at her elbow and
“Show me,” the woman said, and the hermit led her out of the cottage and deep into the forest night.
“Once upon a time,” Moriarty says through the earpiece, “there was a man who was dying, and Death came and stood outside his door.” He pauses, letting the silence fill with static. “Stop me if you’ve heard this one.”
“No,” Mycroft says slowly, as if coming to a decision. “Perhaps not.” He stands, buttoning his suit jacket. “I do so enjoy our little visits, Doctor Watson, rare though they may be.”
, swelling with every beat of her rocketing heart. Roots curl around Sherlock in a protective cage and the table lurches up toward the ceiling, the wood cracking and warping as enormous branches shudder free from its blood-slicked surface. One branch crashes through the exterior wall in a shower of white plaster and brick, twigs and new budding leaves sprouting from its bark as another branch dips low, forking just as it reaches Moran and pins him fast against the tall kitchen cabinets, his arms trapped immobile at his sides.
The city is full of shadows tonight, and the dark silhouette on the kitchen door pulls them close, opens her adumbral mouth and draws them inside. She eats and eats, growing darker and denser and horribly real as she swallows the long shadows of houses and churches and shops, drinks them in until the silhouette swells into a full living form with depth and weight – a woman shaped from darkness with Joanna’s face and Joanna’s hands and the length of her carefully plaited hair.
Joanna thinks of his face in the moments after he turned and saw her standing by the water. Looks at him now, at the impatient purse of his mouth and his wild hair, and remembers the fear in his eyes when she opened the anorak and showed him the explosives beneath.
“Hand-sewn binding, generic mid-century cloth cover.” He flips the book open, briefly, to the first few pages. “No publisher’s name, no editor, no author. No title. Judging by the acidification of the paper and the quality of the ink, I’d say it was printed in London on a privately owned press sometime between 1947 and 1953.”
His fingers still. “I spoke to you, and you responded.” He picks up the television remote and clicks on the sound. “It was only nonsense, of course.”
The sound of his voice flickers, then fades entirely. But the conversation hadn’t ended there. Mrs. Hudson had told him that if he was going to act like a child, she was going to treat him like one. She’d confiscated the skull again, as well as every corrosive chemical compound in the kitchen.
The Burberry shopping bag is still sitting beside Harry’s empty chair. Joanna reaches for it, ready to limp after her, but she stops when she sees what’s inside.
,” she says, and this time the needle finds her palm’s heart line. She breathes deep and knows that her breath fills his lungs, knows that every pulse of his heart finds its echo in hers. She drags the thread through her skin, slick with blood and nearly black in the firelight.
Harry catches her just as the leg buckles, one wiry arm looped around Joanna’s waist. “Sorry,” she says, pressing the cane back into Joanna’s hand. “I just – fuck. I’m sorry, Jo.”
Harry swipes a finger along the edge of a nearby box and cringes at the dust. “What are you doing up here, Jo? It’s revolting.”
“Absolutely not,” he says, but a quick shift of her weight and he’s already losing his grip on her legs. He staggers and she lands hard on her feet, pins and needles pricking from her hips to her toes. She shuffles away from the house with the comical wobble of a newborn foal; Sherlock trails awkwardly after her, probably trying not to look at her bum.
“A decidedly old-fashioned style, one rarely worn by women of your age. Short hair would better fit your limited interest in the more time consuming aspects of personal grooming, but instead you grow it long – unusually long, and despite its relative health and thickness you never wear it loose. Every morning you wash, comb, and plait your hair, and every evening you plait it again before going to sleep. It’s more ritual than habit, and one you’ve kept for a very long time.” He pauses. “Since the day your mother was no longer able to do it for you, I imagine.”
This story is still not complete, but I've decided (even after all this time) to post chapters five and six now. Chapter seven is about half-done; I have no idea whether it will ever be posted. So, a warning: This is still very much a WIP.
“The whole house. It should keep out Moriarty and Moran and anyone else who wishes us harm.” She turns to meet his eyes. He looks back at her, impossible to read. “That’s what I did, the night after the pool. When you’d thought I’d been drinking.”
“Not that I’m aware of.” He gives her the charming almost-smile he only ever uses when he wants something. It’s been a while since he’s directed it at her. “Are you going to let me in?”
The thief struck out in the dark with his knife, but the girl raised Death’s scythe and with one swing parted the thief’s soul from his body. His empty flesh fell at her feet, and the rest of him went out again through the cottage door, where Death waited with open hands.
Joanna closes her eyes. “Because when someone is dying or about to be born, a sturdy, flat surface is rather more useful than a bit of paper.”
“He’s not the only one. Half the neighbourhood is waiting outside that gate, and every one of ‘em has some loony theory about little old lady Satanists or white slavers or your friendly neighbourhood blood cult.” Lestrade rubs a hand over his jaw. It isn’t yet noon, but he already looks as if he needs a shave. His eyes are red with exhaustion. “Child murders make everyone go a bit barmy, I suppose. Even the great Sherlock Holmes.”
There’s a silence. Mycroft’s response, she assumes. She’d heard Sherlock speaking to someone on the phone last night while she was trying to sleep, but the conversation had gone on much too long to be with Mycroft – Sherlock rarely lets his brother distract him for more than thirty seconds at a time, if he answers at all. Or so she’d thought.
‘Only the stone itself,’ the witch said, still smiling. ‘After all, you will have little use for it once you are done.’
Another small flower uncurls from the mat, green and spiked and blooming. She closes her eyes but the colour follows, painted on the inside of her eyelids. She shakes her head.
And she remembers that sunlight faded with the sound of the axe, that human hands sawed and jointed and polished until she became something new, something far from the soil and the sky and too close to the breathing lamp-lit days of their brief human lives – their births and deaths and dinners set upon her skin, and their names burned beneath. Burned, so they could not be forgotten.
The only response Joanna can offer is a slight smile; her breath is too shallow now for speech. She landed on her side when she collapsed, which was lucky – if she’d fallen on her back she would be stuck staring up at the sky, too weak to turn her head. At least now she can see the kitchen door as it opens, revealing Sherlock and Mrs Hudson crouched just inside.
Sherlock watches her for another long, silent moment. Then he pivots away, takes out the phone and punches the Accept key with his thumb. “Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock is staring down at her, stunned. She turns her hand in his and grips his fingers tight. “Don’t let go,” she says, and that’s when the wave hits.
There are other clippings taped to the wall, but they mean little to her – personal adverts from the Daily Mail, an interview with the MP for Croydon South. Several obituaries, none with names she recognises. At the bottom of the map Sherlock scribbled a note in pencil. She bends down to read it.
Gran nods. “I have one more.” She leans back in her chair, fingers steepled in front of her. She smiles a stranger’s smile, wide and hollow and white as chalk. “Botulinum toxin.”
After many years her travels led her back to the forest of her childhood and the cottage of the old hermit. The man lived there still, for after three days and nights spent waiting outside his door Death had tired of the sight of him, and now felt no eagerness to return.
Murray follows her down the long staircase to the front hall, over the threshold and into the empty street. Harry’s car is parked nearby, its windscreen dark with a blanket of dead leaves and its tyres swallowed by sand. Joanna sighs. “She’ll need me to dig her out.”
“Fuck off,” she says without much venom, and opens her eyes. Sherlock is a blurred wall of blue dressing gown and disinterest to her left; to her right is the bedroom door and freedom. She tries to sit up, but her arm refuses to support her weight and the cup tips, spilling water down her front. “Sherlock—”
,” he says, almost spitting, and stomps out of the room. He doesn’t go far; she hears him in the kitchen, banging through the cabinets and running the tap. Then the tap shuts off, and he stomps back in and thrusts another cup of water at her. “Mrs. Hudson was terrified.”
Harry rolls over onto her side, facing the wall. “Go to sleep,” she says. “We’ll talk about it in the morning.”
“Sherlock, right now I have all the muscle strength of a malnourished kitten; I’m not deliberately doing anything.” The water is cold, and it might be the best thing she’s ever tasted. She moans into the cup. “God, that’s amazing. I had no idea how thirsty I was.”
Sherlock takes a seat, his posture too relaxed to be anything but deliberate. His hand skims beneath the table, feeling for the carved words Joanna is certain he’ll find. “You knew we were coming. How?”
“Seven years bad luck, if you believe in that sort of thing.” Sherlock gives her a pitying look, and she smiles wryly. “Which of course you don’t.”
The bride promised this easily, without hesitation. She took the small wooden box and ran away from the little black house and the grove of white trees. She ran along the twisting path and out of the dark heart of the wood. Death waited still at the edge of the field; the bride ran past him and through the wildflowers and the amaranth to where her young husband lay dying.
Sherlock slips out the door on the other side and slams it closed behind him. Alice gives Joanna an amused, slightly pitying look. “Not Alice either, I’m afraid.”
“All the more reason for me to stay. You shouldn’t be alone if you don’t have to be.” She points to the half empty glass of gin in Joanna’s hand. “And what’s this, then? A little liquid courage?”
On the third day, she catches a mouse in one of the live traps on the third floor. She carries it downstairs and stands in the open door to the garden, watching the frozen clouds of her breath. The rise of the moon over the houses and the evening sky.
The kit’s needle isn’t silver or particularly sharp, but there’s no time to be choosy; Joanna stabs it hard into the centre of her left palm. “The fire will be attracted to magic. It’ll try to cling to you as you pass through, but once you’re inside the wards it can’t follow.”
Joanna bends down slightly, rolls out the stiffness in her bad shoulder, and places her left hand over the lock. It’s stainless steel, new or in very good nick, and its edges press sharp and cool into the flesh of her palm. Sherlock could pick it in minutes.
The starling lies dead in its box, tucked away in the fridge between the eggs and the milk. The sickly sweet smell of its decay follows her from room to room, clinging to her hair and hands.
She undoes the button and zip on his trousers and reaches for one of the towels. “And how did that turn into a midnight dip in a koi pond?”
The mattress moves beneath them as he shifts, easing closer. “The clothes you wore yesterday are gone. Shirt, trousers, bra, pants, everything. If you’d stripped naked in some sort of drunken haze, your clothes would be scattered about the flat. Instead they’re just – gone. Not in the bin, not in the wash, not flushed down the toilet nor burnt to ash in the fireplace. You disposed of them somehow, and I don’t know why.” The circle of his fingers tightens around her wrist. “You texted my brother and asked him my middle name.”
. Your grandmother, then.” Sherlock scowls and sits down hard in one of the kitchen chairs. “She would’ve been tall for a woman. I hardly could have predicted that, given your own considerably below-average height.”
Feeling has started to return to her numb arm; she’ll have to check the rest of the satchels for defensive spells before they leave, or risk one sending a Yarder into cardiac arrest. She holds her arm close and ignores the sting. “In defiance of what, do you think?”
Thompson makes a note, the bracelet chiming with each sway of her wrist. Head still bent over the paper, she says, “Joanna, did your grandmother walk with a limp?”
She held his heart once before, circled it with fingers and palm and coaxed it back into life. The flesh of it remembers her, remembers the weight and will of her touch, and just as she once stood beside a blood-soaked operating table in Kandahar and started his heart with her own two hands, she stands now in an abandoned warehouse in East London and stops it.
He sits on the edge of her bed, disturbing the tight precision of the sheets. For a long moment he doesn’t say anything at all. Then he nods at the disassembled shell of the Browning, the frame and slide in her hands. “Enjoying yourself?”
“A nice vase of flowers, right there on the bedside table. It’ll make a world of difference, dear, you’ll see.” Mrs Hudson gives Harry’s shoulder a businesslike pat and bustles out of the room, the empty teacups stacked neatly in the crook of her arm.
“I can’t be sure without a proper examination, but it felt like I wrenched your first and second fingers fully out of joint. Is there any discolouration?”
Sherlock opens the door on Joanna’s side and leans down until they’re nearly face-to-face. “Alice, Anthea, Anita, Augusta – whatever her name, she isn’t interested. Now would you please end this pathetic attempt at flirtation and get out of the bloody car?”
A few minutes later Sherlock stops playing abruptly, mid-phrase. He frowns down at his mother. “What?” he says. “What is it?”
Early dawn bleeds into daylight, into the sun harsh overhead, and they haven’t gone far before the street cracks, giving way to sand, to hard-packed dirt. There’s a sound like a whistle, a warning, and then they’re pinned down along an empty, endless stretch of road, sweat and sunlight bright in their eyes as they seek cover.
When daylight filled the cottage, the girl went to the window and saw Death standing again at the door. “I think you’ll find, sir, that you owe me a gift of my choosing.”
The witch began to close the door, but the orphan girl stopped her with a skinny hand. ‘Death has come for the rich man’s son,’ the girl said. ‘If you cure his fever, I will do whatever you ask.’
Joanna sits in the empty chair beside Adrienne’s and meets the challenge in Mycroft’s steady gaze. “It’s pretty simple, actually. If I had used magic, I would’ve known the bomb was a fake. If I’d known the bomb was a fake, Moriarty would be dead.”
The house is familiar in glimpses, in imperfect fragments of bedroom and kitchen and corridor – a half-remembered past seen only out of the corner of her eye. When they were children she gave little thought to the house Sherlock showed her in the mirror, the tall wood posts of his bed and the bright crystalline blur of the chandelier that hung over the dining room table. It hangs there still, dark and swaddled in thick strips of white cotton. Shielded from the dust. Joanna sits beneath it and watches her sister eat crackers from a plastic sleeve, alone and sleepless in the grey early hours of the morning.
The water is rising, and there is a part of her that wants it – wants the quiet and the cold. There is a part of her that wants to sleep.
Joanna surges to her feet and up the ladder, out of the pit. The wood around them has turned dark and still, but out of the corner of her eye she sees a flash of movement – a shadow fleeing through the trees.
he wants. I could kill you now, burn you alive and let him watch, and it would only be part of the game. He’d have his next move ready in minutes, and your ashes would be dirt under his feet.”
The oak feels footsteps through the house. The vibration of another human voice. This voice is frightened, like Sherlock’s, and angry too – the footsteps slip over moss and broken crockery, and the human yells each time it falls. Sherlock yells back, and the other human stumbles over to him, clumsy and still yelling, and then there is the fall of an axe. The oak screams.
Taped to the map near the wood is a newspaper clipping from the Times. The reporter quotes a DI Gregory Lestrade, who claims the Met has yet to identify the six children whose remains were discovered last Thursday in a north London nature reserve. Another clipping features a photo of Baker Street bathed in unearthly flames.
Mycroft clears his throat, and they turn together to look at him. He leans forward and rests his elbows on the edge of his desk, amusement in the slight purse of his mouth. “When last we discussed the issue, Doctor Watson, you told us in no uncertain terms that the Craft was no longer a part of your life. May I ask what inspired this dramatic change of heart?”
“Not at all. That one belonged to my maternal grandmother – she was a bit of an eccentric, bless her. Excellent cook, though.” She hides her hands in her trouser pockets. Her left is perfectly steady. “Sherlock said he’d be out for most of the night. I’ll tell him you stopped by, if he doesn’t deduce it from the mud on the doormat.”
“Good.” She gives Joanna’s shoulder a gentle squeeze. “Let’s get you a plaster for that hand, shall we?”
Joanna looks at the man in the mask. He has a SIG 9mm in his undamaged hand, and it’s trained on her. “My aim is not so good with my left,” he says, “but at this range it would make little difference, I think. You should get out of the car now.”
“What if it were one of us, Gran?” Harry says, in what Joanna privately refers to as her very-reasonable-barrister voice. “What if Joanna or I were ill, and we refused to do what the doctors told us? You would drag us to hospital by our hair.”
Sherlock is six years old, russet-curled and grinning like a devil; he swings once around the banister at the end of the staircase and is off like a shot towards the gallery, his short legs working at incredible speed.
Joanna’s fourth herb garden sleeps under frost when her grandmother sits her down at the kitchen table and says, “Lesson number fifty-seven: Nothing can bring back the dead.”
In the dark heart of the wood there was a grove of white trees, and in the grove of white trees there was a little black house. The girl banged on the little black door with her fist and said, ‘Come out, Mother Witch, come out!’ The door opened, and out came the witch of the wood.
“Sorry, mate,” Joanna says, joining a second sigil to the first. “You’re not really in a position to argue.” The third sigil is a signature of sorts, a declaration of intent, and as she writes she feels the world shift a bit, uneasy beneath her feet. There’s a sound like approaching thunder, a slow rumble of pressure building behind her eyes, and she quickly returns the chalk to her trouser pocket. “Suppose I haven’t forgotten everything she taught me,” she says, and presses her left thumb over the keyhole.
“Anonymous text,” Harry says. “It said you were in danger and needed my help. When I recognised the address—” She makes a sharp turn, heading south and out of the neighbourhood, towards Baker Street. “The axe was waiting for me at the front door.”
“Mrs Hudson!” he bellows suddenly, at the top of his lungs, and Joanna nearly falls on her arse in surprise. Only his grip on her waist keeps her upright. “
Mycroft sits back against the sofa cushions, his hands folded in front of him in an eerily familiar gesture. “I understand your reticence to discuss these matters, but such circumspection is unnecessary. I already know everything you might wish to hide.”
, it says, notes written in her own neat hand. She closes the book and drops it to the floor. It makes a soft sound as it lands. “I’ll stay here, if you don’t mind. The mirror can wait.”
The stairs are tight, the ceiling low – twelve years old and not yet five feet tall and still she feels the breathless press of walls and wood and the dark. When she comes to the top, she reaches up and tugs the waxy length of string hanging over her head. A light bulb fizzes and pops, and when her eyes have adjusted she sees the mirror.
Afterwards she’d wretched into a wastepaper basket, her gran watching with the dead bird’s body cradled in her gnarled hands. “Now you know your limits,” Gran had said, as if that had been the lesson all along.
,” Harry says, holding back Joanna’s knotted hair as she vomits again, tasting earth and loam. Something hard in her chest shakes loose, softens, and in one long hissing breath she exhales a dark cloud of wood dust. It lingers in the air before her like a shadow.
“If you’re so fucking independent, I suppose you can do without this.” She snatches the cane out of Joanna’s hand and walks off, weaving her way into the crowd of pedestrians passing by.
She doesn’t know him. She has never known him, or anyone like him – a solid, stiff-backed man with thinning white hair and a voice like posh gravel, a man who wears a long camelhair coat over his suit despite the heat of the day. Unfazed by the gun, he walks up to the table and places a fresh bouquet of purple flowers beside Joanna’s bloody hand.
“There are flakes of dried blood in the sawdust,” Joanna says. “I’ve never seen anything like this before, but even I know that means she maintained a direct connection to the spell. Whoever she is, this Moran person heard what we said as soon as we said it. Which reminds me.” She steps up to Mycroft’s desk and gives him a distinctly unfriendly smile. “Who is she?”
“I’ve made myself perfectly clear. I see no reason to discuss it further.” He stops with one hand on the doorknob, his expression shuttered. “You won’t see me tomorrow. I’m going out.”
Joanna has a vague memory of a spell on the front door that chased off a pushy Bible salesman; that was years ago now, but the house is old and that sort of magic tends to linger.  She shrugs. “What I want isn’t at the house.”
‘I have kept my promises,’ the widow said with a careful, furious calm that made her wise old teeth chatter in her wise old mouth. ‘Everything you asked of me, I have done.’
Showers of plaster and brick crash down through the branches as they run, tripping over broken furniture and the oak’s shrivelled roots. Mrs Barrow’s house sways, its walls buckling and bending around them like something from a fevered dream as they flee through the ruined sitting room and parlour and into the front hall. Joanna hears the ticking of the hall clock just before Harry forces her way through the front door and into sunlight.
Gran lies back on the sofa and draws a hand over her closed eyes. She’s still shaking. “I was sending a message. I wanted—” Joanna holds a cup of lukewarm tea to her lips, and she takes a reluctant sip. “I wanted to make myself clear.”
The handle of her cane has warmed beneath her white-knuckled grip; she relaxes her fingers, one by one. “I was shot,” Joanna says. “Sometimes I dream about it. Sometimes, after I dream about it, I come here and tell you how it made me feel.” She raises her trembling left hand. “I talk about it. It isn’t helping.”
Smoke fills her nose and throat, thick and stinking of familiar magic. Her eyes sting and Sherlock wheezes beside her, pressing his arm over his mouth. Her lungs constrict, fighting for a clean breath, but the air in the car is clear, untouched by smoke or fire. The danger isn’t here.
On the second day, she walks home from the butcher’s with a paper sack of bones and a jar of blood. She splits the bones open for their marrow and soaks long strips of linen in blood. She makes poultices and tinctures and salves, peels lines of bark from living trees and burns fires of hawthorn and asphodel. She sits awake until dawn, surrounded by research, filling pages with notes in her cramped, neat writing.
Mrs Hudson avoids Sherlock and the little room below the library, but she visits Mycroft each evening in his father’s study, bringing him heavily sugared cups of tea and sandwiches he politely refuses to eat. Joanna likes watching them argue; it’s as close as she’s ever seen Mycroft come to losing his temper, and winning seems to cheer Mrs Hudson up enormously. One night they spend nearly twenty minutes debating the nutritional merits of Branston pickle, and it somehow ends with Mycroft grudgingly eating both halves of a cheese and chutney sandwich – butter, pickle, and all.
The hermit slept restlessly, burning still with fever. The girl touched cool fingers to his forehead, to the echo of his heart’s beat at throat and wrist. He stirred, but did not wake.
“Or both, I suppose,” Joanna says, a wry note of warning in her voice. Sherlock continues, tone-deaf.
Death, as every man, woman, and little village girl knows, cannot be begged nor bought nor fooled, but he does have a gambler’s fondness for a likely wager. “There is nothing you could give that I should want,” Death said, though of course this was not true, and they each knew it. “You have no business here. Return home to your mother and father.”
The bride did not know how to explain love to a witch. ‘My husband cares for me,’ the bride said instead. ‘If he dies I will not live long enough to be an old woman, and I will never again be short enough for your supper.’
The assistant slumps back in her chair with a small, self-satisfied smile. “I told him you’d react badly if he touched the book. He underestimated you.”
His mother’s frail hand grips his arm. “You will,” she says, and together they fade away into the empty room.
Mrs Hudson is breathing well despite the dust. Joanna follows her from room to room, listening for any sign of respiratory discomfort or distress as her landlady clucks over abandoned dinner plates and empty glasses, tidying as she goes. Her hip still pains her on the stairs, but her lungs sound clear and healthy, undamaged by smoke.
The other human hacks Sherlock free of the oak’s roots and drags him from her protection. The pain is terrible, worse than lightning or fire or rot; the oak screams again, her roots and branches reaching desperately for the axe. She will not let Sherlock be harmed. She is strong enough to keep him safe.
Joanna is completely unsurprised when she opens the door of the waiting town car and finds Adrienne already inside, tapping at her Blackberry.
“That’s a lovely little story,” Anderson says, “but it doesn’t explain the position of the body, or why it’s on the bloody
“Of course she didn’t.” Harry closes her eyes. “I didn’t meet Gran until after you were born. She and Mum started talking again while Mum was pregnant with you, and then for a while she was around all the time.”
They haven’t walked far before Joanna sees the tent, its peak white amid the green. Beneath it a team of blue-suited forensic techs stand and kneel around a crater in the earth – a hole exposed by a massive, uprooted oak. The tree lies broken across the forest floor, the long tangle of its roots curled in the open air.
Joanna staggers but stays standing, her left arm numb at her side. For a moment the drain is too much, too fast – the alley spins around her in a woozy slur of light and dark, pale fire and purpling night sky. Her stomach clenches like she’s about to be sick.
They continue through the summer, lush and green and quiet in a way her dreams have never been before. When she sleeps she finds herself in forests, in rain-soaked jungles, in an ill-tended garden on the grounds of a dark-windowed manor. She knows she’s searching for something; she doesn’t know what.
He knows she is; the sedatives have made her head pound and her throat feel like sandpaper, raw and desert dry. She swallows and feels the grind. “It was something in her books, wasn’t it? Something you wanted to know.” His grip tightens on the bottle, and Joanna grins. “I’m right, aren’t I? Seostris knew, and she killed herself to keep it from you.”
They walk side by side up the drive to the house and push past the officers standing on the front steps. They stop abruptly when they see the sign on the door.
The shadow stretches out its arms and braces itself against the doorframe. It nods once, and Joanna grins.
“A small mirror is useful in any number of situations. I’ve always carried one.” He moves closer, a sharp-angled warmth at her back. Lingering in the periphery of her vision. “I’ve done something to make you angry. What is it?”
His chest sounds clear, so she crawls behind him on the bed to listen at his back. She rests a hand on his shoulder and feels muscle tense beneath her palm. “Lean forward, just slightly.” After a moment’s hesitation, he does. She slips the stethoscope’s eartips back into place, muffling the sounds of the room around her, and sets the diaphragm high on his back. “Breathe for me.”
Joanna tries to pull the cane from the wall. The wood prickles with heat, and it refuses to budge. “How do I—”
“Imagine my surprise.” Donovan lifts the tape so they can cross under. “We found a sixth body after Lestrade phoned you,” she says, leading them through the gate and into the sun-dappled wood. “Medical examiner says he’s a little older, maybe fourteen or fifteen. Hasn’t been dead quite so long as the others, either.”
Joanna shakes her head, phrasing her response carefully. “I doubt I could tell you anything you don’t already suspect.”
The oak is one of the oldest in the wood, its roots long and twisted and clotted with mud. Joanna examines it as she would a patient, the crown and trunk and roots, and finds no sign of violence that can’t be explained by the fall itself. She looks over at the crime scene; Sherlock and Lestrade are in the pit, and no one is paying her any attention. She works her left hand out of its glove and lays her palm against the bark.
“They weren’t relevant.” He cups her open hand in his, circling her wrist with two long fingers. “Last night you used my favourite bone saw to cut into your grandmother’s cane in three places. You hesitated before the first two cuts, but your hands were steady – you didn’t want to do it, but you felt you had no other choice.” His index finger settles over her pulse. “I don’t know why.”
Murray steps forward and pats Gran’s shoulder, his expression pleasantly, professionally detached. “Now, Helene, you know you can’t have anything to drink. What if we need to pull you in for surgery? Better safe than sorry, yeah?”
The woman nods. “Good,” she says softly, her eyes unfocused. Staring at something neither of them can see. “That’s good.”
Joanna sighs and looks over her shoulder at the dying oak. “Don’t blame yourself,” she tells it. “I’m a modern independent woman; you’re a tree. It never would have worked.”
Outside the rich man’s house there was an orphan girl who sold flowers in the street. When she saw that Death waited for the boy, the orphan girl dropped her flowers and ran down the street and out of the town and onto a winding path that led deep into the dark heart of the wood.
They’ve only walked a few blocks from the sports centre when a black town car passes them in the street and pulls up to the kerb. Joanna tenses, reaching for the gun at her back; Sherlock stops her with a small shake of his head. The car door opens and Mycroft’s assistant steps out, mobile in hand. It chimes, and she glances up at them, looking rather bored. “Which is it?” she says. “Hospital or home?”
Her grandmother’s cane. Mrs Hudson fumbles blindly in the smoke once, twice, and then snatches the cane from its hooks over the fireplace, tucking it close under her arm.
He gives her a playfully severe look. “You’re going about this all wrong, Jo. I mean, I didn’t quite expect you to throw yourself at my feet and beg for your life, but I did hope we’d stick to some sort of script – ‘why are you doing this, you’ll never get away with this
“Very unlike him, you mean.” Joanna sighs and leans over her plate, her elbows wrinkling Mrs. Hudson’s embroidered tablecloth. “We had a sort of…strange encounter last night. That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about.”
“Fuck,” Harry says – a typical sort of greeting, these days. She’s leaning back against the driver’s side door, her eyes on Joanna’s suitcase. “Is that really all you’re keeping?” Harry’s dressed for summer, in a loose blouse and a soft, knee-length skirt – Joanna feels dull and stiff by comparison. Then a sharp gust of wind rattles through the trees, and Harry leaps back into the car, shivering. Joanna lifts her suitcase into the boot and tries not to smirk.
Harry presses her face to Joanna’s shoulder, and after a choked silence begins to cry in wet, jerky gasps.
The kitchen is dim, the lamps shattered or obscured. Moran smiles down at her from the shadows, his expression polite and slightly pained. “An ambitious attempt, certainly. I should point out, however, a minor flaw in your execution—”
The wick caught fast. The candle flame burned high and thin and white-hot, and it grew higher and hotter as the boy’s fever slowly left him, cooling into a quiet and even sleep. Bubbling wax spilled over the girl’s skinny hand, but she did not let go until the last of the wick burned to ash.
Her grandmother’s house is tall and narrow and warped in odd places, twisted by age and long years of ill use. Joanna flicks on each lamp as she wanders from room to room, exploring the forgotten, dust-choked spaces behind curtains and inside wardrobes. She finds four pennies, a thimble-sized brass bell, and the half-crushed skeleton of a mouse. The pennies and the mouse’s skull she wraps in a page of yellowed newspaper and slips into her pocket – the pennies will go in her tin money bank, and her grandmother might find use for the skull. She leaves the bell behind, on the dark wood windowsill where she found it.
He inhales, and it sounds marvellous – a clear, clean rush of air that drowns out every other sound, any lingering doubt or fear. It’s easier now that he can’t see her face, and Joanna closes her eyes before she asks him to breathe again, working her way left to right down the lean breadth of his back.
Of course. Only children and the mad believe in magic. She looks away, the stinging fingers of her left hand curled into a fist. “Antipsychotics?”
.” The air inside the car is so hot she can hardly breathe. “Of course you did. You’re Sherlock Holmes, the world’s greatest swot detective; I suppose by now you can identify a hedgewitch by her broom handle and a blood cult necromancer by the stains on his tie.”
, she thinks, and Harry was wrong; she hasn’t overdone it, not even close. She has more power than she can use, has magic seething impatiently under her skin, against her teeth and in the wells of her eyes. She’s a cup about to overflow.
and a few of mirrors, but none that describe the mirror in the attic. There are mirrors that show the truth, and others that only show lies. There was once a mirror that showed you your heart’s greatest desire, but it was lost years ago and Joanna knows what she would see in it, if she could.
“Four months ago my parents died in a traffic accident,” Joanna tells the boy in the mirror. “No one will say it, but they think it was my dad’s fault.” She takes a shallow, unsteady breath. “I think they’re probably right.”
He makes a small, satisfied noise. “A miscalculation on his part. I would’ve chosen a spot closer to Sarah’s.  You’ve lived in a war zone before, but an implicit threat to a civilian, to someone you care about – that would’ve made for a much more effective message. He missed an opportunity there.”
She studies his face for a long moment, the tension in his jaw and careful blankness behind his eyes. “I really am all right, Sherlock. He didn’t hurt me.”
The book’s paper is yellow-edged and thick, and it makes a soft, sibilant sound as Mycroft turns the pages. “
—” he begins, but Harry closes the car door in his face and goes around to the other side. She gets in and jams the key into the ignition, dropping the axe onto the seat beside her. The tyres squeal and bump as she pulls off the kerb and into the street.
Joanna rather envies Thompson’s soothing, carefully neutral tone – hers has always been quite good, but Thompson’s is of another class altogether. There’s some inescapable thread of calm in her low-pitched therapist’s voice that makes Joanna
“I can’t lose if I’m not playing,” Mycroft says. He’s squinting down at the book, holding it little too close to his face, and Joanna smiles.
“He cares,” Mrs Hudson says. She smoothes the quilt at the foot of the bed, tugging it tight at the corners. “And it would do him good to see her, even as she is, but I don’t intend to waste my breath bullying him into it.” She stands back, inspecting her work. “This room needs flowers.”
The oak has swallowed her right arm to the shoulder; now the skin of her throat ripples and cracks as its bark flows grey along her neck and jaw, creeping over her mouth and her nose and growing thick over the vulnerable places in her throat and chest. As the bark spreads she feels the muscles beneath grow solid and still and somehow hollow, forcing her to watch in fixed horror as the fingers of her left hand lengthen and branch, the buds of new leaves sprouting from her knuckles and fingertips. Too late she tries to use her legs to break free – her toes spill from her shoes, growing as long and thin and fibrous as pale roots seeking soil. Her feet sink into the rich earth between the kitchen tiles and the oak’s trunk grows around her, pulling her inside.
“You did. You started my heart again with your own two hands. I told him that.” His grip on Sherlock’s throat eases slightly. Sherlock breathes deeper, and Joanna breathes with him. “You know what he said?”
Joanna gives the house more, feeds it power until the wards are strong enough to touch Sherlock’s mind.
Joanna shivers, her arms wrapped tight around her. Their clothes are nearly dry, but the damp and the cold and the slow, creeping exhaustion are taking their toll. They both stink of chlorine and smoke and Sherlock’s wincing now, every time he breathes too deep or lifts his left arm. She needs to get them inside.
The all-saint’s fire is burning through the wards at last, flaring with heat wherever the threads of the spell weaken and ignite. A scorched hole appears high above the black rails of the fire escape, and within moments the roof of 221 Baker Street erupts in flames.
“That was one of Helene Russell’s old spells; Watson had no conscious control over it. She wouldn’t last thirty seconds against Moran.” Adrienne looks Joanna up and down with a now-familiar expression of benign disinterest. “We’ll start by recasting the protective wards on your flat. They’ll be more potent if you do them yourself, and we can work from your grandmother’s book.” She sighs. “Better to begin with the familiar, I suppose, since you’ve so effectively crippled yourself.”
“Before I examined you, yes. I wasn’t sure Mrs. Hudson would be able to recognise the symptoms of some of the less obvious poisons.” He sits on the edge of the bed, his hip against her knee. “I know you very well, Joanna.”
Joanna stills, her hands raised and empty. Unthreatening. Her gun was lost in the scuffle, sent sliding behind a stack of crates at the other side of the warehouse. Boyle’s gun is gone too, but he hardly needs it – Sherlock stands pinned against his chest, helpless in the larger man’s hold. He is, for once, wisely silent.
A few glass vials of liquid fire. That’s all it takes – smash the vials against the bricks, and the whole house burns. Moriarty could have sent anyone to do it, but she doesn’t think he did. She thinks that this time he wanted to get his hands dirty.
Sherlock makes a low, dismissive sound – clearly he finds fault with her priorities. “Still in my trousers. It’s fine.” He pulls out a sticky, congealed lump of what once must have been nicotine patches and drops it onto the table. He begins his attack on the coat’s inside pockets, finding in quick succession a blue biro, a round tin compact, and his pocket magnifier. He shakes the water out of the magnifier and grins. “Excellent.”
“Why not? I learned my lesson.” She tugs the skirt up over her knees and around her hips, tilting gracelessly onto Sherlock’s side of the little seat. He shifts away, closer to the window. It makes her want to laugh at him, to jeer, to rip at the open tears in his trousers and slip her fingers between the buttons of his ragged shirt.
It’s difficult with her hands still bound behind her back, but she manages to climb out the car door and onto the pavement. The building in front of them is squat grey concrete, nondescript and entirely unfamiliar. There’s a chipped plastic sign on the door that says
, the screen says, and Joanna sits in the chair beside Sherlock’s, listening to the reporter’s even-toned account of the destruction. Faulty gas main, he says. A tragic accident.
She thought he was dead, but she was wrong. He’s just on the other side of the wall, listening for the sound of her footsteps.
Death reached out and plucked the pomegranate from the windowsill. “Then I will take you as well,” Death said, “and save myself the journey later.”
He waves a hand in the direction of her garden, indicating and dismissing it with a single gesture. “Your grandmother grew herbs. It was her hobby, not yours – you abandoned it after her death. You find it comforting now to recreate your memories of time spent with her, a time when you felt safe.”
Gran hadn’t taught her much about all-saint’s fire; the ingredients required are expensive and volatile, and in a house as old and thickly enchanted as her grandmother’s even the smallest flame could have disastrous consequences. Gran said the fire could be used to destroy the indestructible and break the unbreakable, to reduce even the most powerful magics to ash and leave nothing of a living witch but the memory of her name.
Joanna licks her lips; her mouth tastes like dust and a lingering sourness from the sedatives. “Is Molly dead?”
“The mirror is none of your concern,” he says stiffly, and Joanna laughs. Moss ripples along the broad limbs of the oak.
The shadow’s chest rises, the darkness inside her breathing deep, and then she slams her arm up through the fire’s ribs and rips out its burning ember-black heart.
“There’s always something,” Joanna says, and slides over so he can join her under the table. He does, his knees tucked to his chest. They both look up.
She wriggles through the window a moment later, cautious until her feet touch the floor. Sherlock has already stripped off his suit jacket and is starting work on his shirt cuffs. She closes the window, locks it, and switches on the bedside lamp.
“I’m going to quite intentionally boot you out of my flat in a minute if you don’t tell me why you’re here.”
“Probably. But then, I’m also a crime fighting ex-Army witchdoctor, so that may come with the territory.” She pushes herself to her feet. Her leg feels wonderfully solid beneath her, the strongest it’s been all morning. “You’re going to tell Mycroft about this, aren’t you?”
When she wakes again the room is empty, the window dark. She pushes herself up by her elbows and sits, the quilt draped across her lap. A vase of wilted flowers rests on the bedside table.
A blue thread snipped from the sleeve of Sherlock’s dressing gown. Black stitching from Mrs. Hudson’s favourite housedress, and white wool from Joanna’s softest, oldest jumper. Three silver sewing needles and three lengths of thread and three slivers of yew wood, sharp-edged and polished red in the low light of the lamps. Mrs. Hudson arranges it all on a tea tray and stands at the foot of the stairs, waiting.
Joanna clutches the cane’s handle, breathing through the humiliation and pain. “Make it up to me,” she says. “Buy me lunch.”
“Your life is full of trials, isn’t it?” Lestrade lamented, stretching his legs out in front of him.  He sipped his coffee.
While Sherlock brooded in his chair, Joanna popped off to the chemists ‘round the corner, leaving the clippers Mrs Hudson’s secure care, to get what she needed to save Sherlock’s crowning glory.
I hope to have another chapter out in a week, but I'm having to write a commencement speech that is funny, entertaining, isn't trite, and won't put 2000 people to sleep.  No pressure.  What were the kids thinking about voting me for faculty speaker?!
? No.  But enemy fire doesn’t discriminate gender.” Reese leaned his forearms against the low wall that separated the gym from the observation area and gestured to the doctor who was still sparring with The Tree. “She’d been on patrol when the unit my mates were in took heavy fire a couple of klicks away.  Her boys kept the enemy pinned down while she and Murray – that’s her nurse; bloody good sod, that man! – pulled Geoff and Mick out by their bootstraps as I hear it. She literally kept Mick from bleeding out by keepin’ her finger shoved down the bullet hole in ‘is neck until they evaced back to Bastion and got ‘im into surgery.”
“You were afraid for me,” John’s voice held not once trace of bewilderment or confusion, only acceptance.
My thanks to Ariane DeVere for her fabulous Sherlock transcripts.  Writing would be much harder without them.
Sorry that I’m swearing so much. I know you hate that about me. You said that dust was eloquent, but you are even more so.  Always. I’d blame it on my inner soldier, but I just don’t give a ruddy shite right now.  Ooops!  Sorry.
The kiss was searching and penetrating but also tender and delicate; everything that Sherlock was as well as everything Joanna was certain he could be. She coiled her fingers into the curls at the back of his head to signal her consent, and he pressed further, deepening the kiss. Sherlock’s tongue brushed the inside of her bottom lip compelling her to open to him.  He kissed her lazily, memorizing the contours of her mouth with his tongue.
not do so on their own.  Hence the reason why the three of them were now squirreled away in the quietest corner of The Drunken Labrador.
Sherlock had pulled a cigarette from the packet in his pocket, lit it, and drew a long stream of smoke into his lungs. He held it for a long moment, letting this nicotine seep into his bloodstream before exhaling slowly.
.   Being around her was both relaxing and challenging. He certainly had laughed more in the last months than he had in the previous decade.  Given the opportunity, Sherlock was quite certain that he could comfortably spend the rest of his days with Joanna Watson in his life as his friend, but could there be more?  Did he want more?  Did she? He had it on good authority – nearly 25 years of observation and deduction though no practical experience – that intimate relationships were inherently risky when conducted with one’s best friend.
Sherlock slipped on the latex gloves and dipped a square of gauze dressing into the water.  The solution was warm against John’s skin as Sherlock carefully wiped away the blood from his temple.  He tossed the used square into the bin at his side and grabbed another, and then another repeating the process until the blood was entirely cleansed from John’s head, hair, ear, and cheek.  Sherlock’s ministrations were so gentle that John found his muscles relaxing for the first time since they’d taken on this bloody case.  He closed his eyes and felt himself drifting under the care of his friend.
Sherlock’s voice was soothing, hypnotic, and without realizing it, her fingers began to card through the curls on the back of his head.  Sherlock’s narration stopped, and Joanna froze.  Through her fingertips, she could practically feel him weighing his response. He rolled his neck once, pressed back against the flat of her palm in tacit consent to her ministrations, and resumed his recitation.  Joanna smiled.
Sherlock’s voice echoed in his mind– was impossibly tall and slender with a shock of white hair and an air of bewilderment about him; he walked briskly to keep up with her.
The man seemed to be winding himself up into full “Sherlock” mode, and Joanna began to get the distinct impression that he had forgotten she was even in the room.  “Do I need to be here for this conversation with yourself, or is this a matter of ‘genius needing an audience?’”
It was impossible for her to keep her mocking tone at bay any longer.  She had kept close rein on her temper these last days knowing that it wouldn’t do any of them the least bit of good, but it was becoming increasingly difficult not to reach across the table and slap both of them for their idiocy.
Mary pressed her small hand gently to the side of John’s neck and worried his earlobe between her thumb and forefinger.  Though she loved him dearly, a not so little part of her delighted by the nervous quiver that shuddered through his muscular frame.  She pitched her voice lower – it was getting late and the pub traffic was picking up beyond the heavy curtains – so only John and Sherlock could hear her. Mary kept her recitation unhurried and languid to ensure that each point she was about to make was fully understood.
“When it compromises the integrity of this murder investigation, it becomes my business.” Donovan tucked her notepad into the pocket of her rain slicker, and from the arch of her brow seemed to be demanding an accounting.
The video had taken an hour to make. Five times longer than Sherlock had originally allocated for something that, in the end, was less than 30 seconds long.  However, much to Sherlock’s surprise, he wanted his well wishes to Joanna to come across as sincerely as possible.  Which was exactly the problem.  At first Sherlock had no idea what to say, such sentiments really were far outside his area of expertise, but after some inept prodding by Lestrade and a few minutes scouring the tiny ‘public relations’ cupboard of his mind palace – a relatively new addition courtesy of Joanna Watson – Sherlock had finally decided on the script. He was a good enough actor on cases, so he reasoned that this would come off just as he wished.
John smiled his thanks and was warmed that Sherlock had though to do so.  Though sufficient for Sherlock to examine his shoulder, the light from the hallway wasn’t enough for the detective to tend to the rest of John’s injuries.  Realizing that the concussion would likely make John sensitive to light, Sherlock had used the towel to shield it.  There was now enough light for Sherlock to work, but not so much as to cause John any undue pain.
“It has been widely proven that of all the senses, the sense of smell is the one most directly tied to memory,” Sherlock explained. “You were correct when you said I had ruined the one positive reminiscence of your childhood. Unintentional, though it was, I will never be able to fully atone for that, but I hope that this will allow you at least some chance at repairing the damage I have done.”
The days she had been gone had been hellish. She had missed Sherlock more than she ever expected.  Joanna had come to need his sulking, his madness, his genius, and his child-like naiveté like she needed a roof over her head and a cup of hot tea in her hand. Sherlock was home, and comfort, and belonging, and all the things Joanna feared she’d never know again after she was shot and left an invalid, adrift without direction or purpose.
“Then there was the smell of sex … clinging to your skin like the lover who left it there.”  Mary sighed.  “I know what you smell like, John. I know what
“You don’t cosset me.  The doctors and nurses act like I’m something fragile, as though I’ll fly apart right in front of them.  Makes me feel rather stupid … weak.”
“How is your arm?” Sherlock asked, reaching across the table to brush a finger against the bandage that peeked out from beneath the sleeve of her pale pink jumper.
definitely factors into your role as my companion, colleague, associate, partner, or whatever it is you’d like to term yourself.”
“It’s different than before, though.”  Like hers, Lestrade’s gaze was focused on the pair standing next to the corpse on the far side of the rugby pitch.
Sherlock Holmes was unpredictable and erratic, brilliant and maddening, odd and, quite simply, a major pain in the arse.  John had no idea why he had decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people, but one look into those steady eyes told him that he could trust the man – with his very life if need be.
“Vomiting blood … it’s dark … too much,” she gasped. Her breathing was becoming laboured. “Hard to … can’t remember … diagnosis wrong … can’t think to … need to
Joanna cringed at the memory. It had been one of the more hurtful things she had said to him that night.  She feared he thought she was accusing him of being the sociopath he claimed to be, but as bad as what she had said had been, it was nothing compared to what she had done by threatening his violin.  Talk about something for which she would never be able to atone.
Sherlock passed his hand through the stream of water that flowed from the tap in the bathroom.  Still too cold.  Typical.  The pipes in the building were old and the boiler in the cellar older still.  Waiting for the conduits to fulfill his demand, Sherlock pulled several clean towels from the linen cupboard and set them under John’s medical bag where he had set it on top of the closed seat of the loo.   His fingers lingered on the well-worn leather of the kit and a slight shudder ran through him when he considered how close …
Joanna held the vial up to the light of the torch, and sure enough, she could see the shadow of the data chip inside the opaque container. She bagged the evidence and stripped off her now bloody nitrile gloves, dropping them on the drape beside the body for the Yard to dispose of when they wrapped up the crime scene. Pocketing her torch, she headed back into the main room of the shop, currently the centre of the investigation.
Joanna had sprayed the detangling solution liberally over his head, letting the mixture seep through the mats and knots down to his scalp.  She separated a section of hair at the nape of Sherlock’s head, and taking up a broad-toothed comb, made her way meticulously through the tangles.
They sat under a tree in Euston Square Garden. Greg on a bench, Jo in the wheelchair Lestrade had nicked when he sprung her, IV and all, from her hospital room.  With all of the chaos previous day, Greg had been pretty confident that Joanna needed to get out of her room and out of her head.  He saw their chance when several new arrivals on the floor occupied the hospital staff, but Greg judged that they had at most another 15 minutes before someone came looking for them – he’d left a note on her bed explaining where they were; he wasn’t
Donovan gaped, her open mouth undulating like a fish struggling to pull a breath from the air rather than the water.
“Oh yes – we meet up every Friday for fish and chips,” Mycroft infused as much sarcasm into his words as he could manage. Lying to Sherlock was as pointless as ever, but he needed to distract him from the full truth for now. He gestured to Anthea, who handed Sherlock a folder.  “I’ve kept a … weather eye on her, of course.”
Though Mary’s understanding of Sherlock before he fell came solely from the stories that John and the others had shared with her, Mrs. Hudson was quick to point out how much Sherlock’s years away had changed him.  Oh, he was still an atomic bomb of rude, impossibly brilliant frenetic energy that could go off at any moment, but those moments were fewer and farther between than they had been. Sherlock was more patient, she had said.  More considerate.  Especially of John.
Sherlock hummed in agreement. As he spread ointment on the graze with his thumb, his long fingers reached around the nape of Joanna’s neck and gently probed the knot behind her right ear.   She winced and the fingers stopped immediately, instead resting lightly against the curve of her skull.
She nodded her appreciation for his candour and turned her attention to John.  “Now the corroborating evidence.”
Sherlock held her eyes for a long moment before he nodded and turned back to the task of finding the vial in Mr Soniere, victim number six.
“The heart’s been circled,” Joanna clarified. The squirrel on the left executed a descent approximation of a roundhouse kick, but the one on the right ducked lower on the tree trunk just in time to avoid it.
“Yes, he will,” his tone was ominous, but Sherlock turned to smile at the doctor.  “But I have a concussed sidekick … a concussed
“What?”  Joanna couldn’t believe what spilling from the other woman’s mouth. She crossed her arms over her chest and set her jaw defiantly.  “Just how have Sherlock and I compromised the integrity of this investigation?”
It had been over three years since Sherlock last stood on this rooftop, and when he had, it had been the need for reflection and solitude that sent him there.
“That’s the soldier talking,” Sherlock admonished.  He relaxed his grip around John’s chest but did not let go of him altogether.  “What does the
seen Mycroft look contrite.   Didn’t think he had the facial muscles for it, actually. As hacked off as you were with the bastard, I think it’s nothing compared to how Violet and Siger felt when they realized he had used them to force your hand.”
“He survived.”  An obvious deduction considering the reverence with which Reese spoke about Joanna’s work.
John’s mind whirled with the memories of the night: waking up in the tramway tunnel, confused and disoriented; the damp, musty smell of disuse; the heat of the fires burning in the dustbins; General Shen’s threats; the horrifying yet empty click of her handgun when she pulled the trigger; Sarah struggling at her bonds beside him; the bolt of the crossbow aimed at her heart.  Things could have gone so wrong if Sherlock hadn’t shown up when he did …
It was not the intermittent tremor that caused Joanna’s hand to shake as she reached out to pluck the pipe from the table as the emotional core of her mind pleaded with what her rational side already knew to be true.
John struggled against the blankets that held him captive before the fire, but he couldn’t get free, nor could he escape the doom and the dread that descended upon him.
“Sergeant Donovan.”  Joanna greeted the irritable investigator with as much affability as she could manage, which for once was quite little – Jo was usually sociable after all – but the other woman failed to hear the tightness in the greeting, and instead seemed to take it as permission to continue speaking.
John’s responding grunt was a cross between a chuckle and a groan of pain as Sherlock pressed the icepack to his injured shoulder and began wrapping the compression bandage around John’s torso and under his arm to keep it in place.  John didn’t feel at all uncomfortable as Sherlock’s fingers brushed at his skin with each pass of the bandage.  In fact it was rather comforting given the stress of the harrowing evening.
“I’m afraid you’ll have to be more specific, Lestrade.” Sherlock adjusted the angle of his torch and poked again through the jumbled puzzle of organs at the half-exposed liver, pushing it aside so as to have better access to Mr Soniere’s spleen.
“One helluva cold case,” she muttered, gauging the size of the paper storm that had enveloped the flat.  She picked up a crime scene photo of a dead parrot in walk-in cage that lay atop the coffee table.  She could see another photo of a desiccated human corpse crumpled in a foetal position next to a park bench on top of the table that served as Sherlock and Joanna’s shared desk, and sitting on the seat of her desk chair a third picture of – what the hell?
Across the city, Joanna had been celebrating her birthday with great fanfare.  Friends, food, drinking, darts, camaraderie.  All very tedious.   Sherlock had never had any intention of going.  There’d be
“Now, Mike, which one of these rooms is hers?” Mummy asked, gesturing at the rooms in the immediate vicinity. “Oh, I am pleased you made certain she’s in a private room, love.”  Mummy spoke briskly with an equally precise, but not overly posh, accent. Mr Holmes remained silent, and from the patient and serene expression he wore, Greg was pretty certain this was typical behaviour for him.
Joanna’s critical eye assessed the damage in front of her.  Catastrophic. That really was the only word to describe it. This was not going to be an easy repair.  Several hours at least.  She wasn’t an expert in this particular field, but taking him to one who was would likely result in the very thing she was hoping to avoid. Besides, Sherlock would never consent. She looked at the instruments that she had laid out in precise order on the sofa next to her, debated for a moment, and then made her selection.
The detective sank regally into John’s chair; his penetrating gray eyes had grown even more so; his tone was icy.  “Pray continue, Captain Watson.”
that you don’t understand sentiment, Sherlock,” she said when she opened them again.  Lowering the instrument, she clutched it to her protectively.  “The problem is that you don’t even
lacerations to both wrists.”  Sherlock huffed with frustration as he took the icepack from John’s still fingers and set it on the bed.  He leaned in and started to undo the buttons on John’s striped shirt.
“Partly, but I was more angry with myself. Anyway, I never should have gotten physical with her even though she had done with me.  Donovan can take care of herself under typical circumstances, the Met’s trained her well enough, but my training isn’t just about defending myself, it’s about – “
She dropped her eyes and fiddled with the hem of her pale pink jumper, suddenly embarrassed.  She knew she should probably stay silent, but the nature of the relationship she was proposing could not be founded on half-truths or evasions.  “I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t … well, to be honest –“
Mycroft was … resigned by the whole thing (yes, he popped in), but I’ve never seen Greg so angry; given all the crap that you’ve pulled over the years that’s bloody well saying something.
Joanna studied the concerned expression on Greg’s face carefully.   He was worrying the inside of his cheek with his teeth.  Hiding something.  Something … not good?   Turning her head, she observed a similar expression – though one wholly Mycroftian – on the face of The British Government.
Mycroft sniffed.  He wasn’t shocked by her admission.  “I’m living in a world of goldfish.  On the rare occasion, I come across someone who is an exceptional– one might even say
Joanna’s eyes shot open and fixed on Mycroft’s haughty smile.  If the heart monitor had still been beeping its report aloud, it would likely have indicated a flat line.
He would not share these thoughts with the man himself, of course, so, “Your medical expertise would be valuable since none of Lestrade’s people will work with me.  Anderson’s inept as you’ve no doubt noticed, and the rest of the medical examiners are even worse, whereas you at least show the
“I need to send a message,” Joanna said, locking the wheels of the chair.  Greg scrambled to assist her when it became clear that she meant to stand. He kicked the lap blanket out of the way as it fell, and gripped her arm gently before wrapping a supportive arm around her waist.  She wasn’t as weak as all that but appreciated the help nonetheless.
“Joanna!” Sherlock protested as the files hit the floor at his feet, papers scattering across the floor.  He had done as she asked and left her mood develop as she needed it to so why …
The fiberglass filaments that clung to the edge of her sleeve spoke of two … no three broken limbs – two legs and one arm (compound fracture) – one case of severe food poisoning, judging by the splatter of sick on the toes of her medical clogs; two victims of automobile accidents, one the fatality he saw reflected in her gait; three heart attacks, all resting comfortably; one stroke, also out of danger; and something untoward involving a small rodent, a bottle of personal lubricant, and … Oh.
“Passion.  All his previous killings, though personal, were dispassionate, almost clinical in their precision.  This,” Sherlock gestured with the blood-stained forceps in his hand, “was vicious, fervent … out of control.  We will find him far more quickly now that he has become the victim of his own sentiment.”
“Back in a mo’,” Joanna said with a slight smile, and then she jogged back to the changing room to grab a quick shower before changing into her street clothes.
“No point in drawing it out,” Sherlock said.  He stood and rested his hand on his lover’s shoulder.  “Four days has been agonizing enough.”
“Sherlock’s always been something of a force of nature,” Lestrade said by way of greeting, lifting the blue tape that stretched between the flashing lights of two panda cars and gesturing Mary to the other side.  “Together they’re unstoppable.”
“You couldn’t be tiresome if you tried.”  Sherlock’s eyes widened in shock at his own words as if he couldn’t believe that he’d actually said them aloud.  He had been slouching in the chair, swirling the last swallow of his scotch about in the glass, but he pushed himself up in the chair; his back now ramrod straight.  He looked from John to Mary and back to John who gave his younger lover a look that said, ‘
Let me know what you think after you read this chapter.  Reviews are love!  Constructive criticism is cool, too.  :)
me to do anything, you tosser!”  John jumped up, scattering the blankets to the floor, and leaned in until he was practically nose-to-nose with the detective.  For once, John had the height advantage, and he was going to use it.  “I
“That’s good.  Yeah.  Good.” Joanna nodded. It had been a horrible case. She rubbed at the bandage on her forearm that covered the knife wound that she had received from O’Hearn after Sherlock and she had cornered him in an alleyway.  She had been cut as she wrestled the knife away from the man, but as they grappled with the maniac and tried to force him to the ground, they failed to notice a pile of rebar amidst the construction debris in the alley. When Jo managed to hook her leg around O’Hearn’s ankle and yank his feet out from under him, the PBR Killer fell backwards onto the rebar, which lanced through his heart and out the front of his chest.  It had been awful, but Joanna couldn’t bring herself to feel any remorse for the man.  She had long since accepted that fate and justice walked hand in hand more often than most people cared to think about.
Joanna lowered her head for a moment to collect herself then raised it again to meet his gaze.  The words that she said next had come in such a rapid stream that Sherlock got the impression she might break apart if she had to think about them too long.
is my friend, the best I’ve ever had, and you’d do well to remember that.” Joanna finally looked down at where the sergeant had tightened her grip on Joanna’s arm, pulling her closer to plead her case.
to me.  I didn’t expect that something like this,” she pulled the phone from her pocket again, “would be your excuse.  That after all we’ve been through together you’d just disappear today of all days.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and thankfully Sherlock missed the expression.  He had the utmost confidence in his brother’s ability to solve the terrorist plot, but his faith that Sherlock would be able to navigate his way through the complex maze that was going to be his relationship with Joanna Watson was diminishing exponentially.
“Of course,” Mummy said, brushing at an invisible piece of lint on her son’s lapel.  “Take your time, love.  Father and I will have plenty to talk about with Joanna.”
“Shall I explicate my deductions?” she whispered in their ears.  John and Sherlock looked at one another and nodded slowly.
Joanna eyed him warily as his not so subtle threat hung in the air between them.  The last time they landed in A&E was one of the most exhausting experiences in Joanna’s life.
“We usually share a meal at the conclusion of a case.” He tried to sound as nonchalant as possible.  “There’s a small
She had let the quiet and the strain go on between the two as long as she could, hopeful that they would work things out themselves, but after three days of John sleeping on the lilo, and Sherlock literally ripping the wallpaper from the walls of 221B because John had taken the Browning and left Sherlock nothing to shoot with, it became clear that they would not … or perhaps
meant that Sherlock was desperate. Then there was the fact that he clearly wanted to know that she was safe and unharmed; Sherlock expressing concern and empathy for another human being was cause for celebration on most days. It was the “please,” however, that did her in.  Sherlock never begged. He cajoled, yes. He flattered.  He wheedled his way into any situation he wanted to be a part of, but one thing he just didn’t say was “please.”
Hopefully there aren't too many errors in this chapter.  I didn't have as much time to glean through it as I usually do as I wanted to get it out before my busy weekend.
“Just get on with it,” he interrupted, fluttering his hand in irritation.  They had been through this half a dozen times in the last sixty minutes, yet the argument had become moot in the first five.  “I shouldn’t notice any discomfort in my mind palace. I need to categorize all the data from the case anyway.”
“I know that it’s probably trite and overly romantic to say this, but second chances like the one you’ve been given just don’t happen in real life,” Mary said.  “They’re the foolish fantasies of fiction and fairy tales, yet here the two of you are, alive, and whole, and clearly in love.  I would never stand in the way of that.”
intentional.  Calculated even. Certainly is for the likes of Donovan and Anderson.”  Sherlock turned his attention to the window and picked at the corner of a safety sticker on the glass.
Joanna shook the leaves back into the bag and looped the leather cord about the neck of the pouch securely. “Thank you.  This … this means a lot.”  But her words seemed insufficient, so before she could think twice, Joanna cupped the side of his face in her hand.  He bent his head low and she brushed his temple with her lips. For a moment she brushed her thumb along the bottom curve of his cheekbone and smiled when he tried not to curl into her touch and failed miserably.
Sherlock lifted his eyes and met her gaze directly, but the sight that greeted him nearly drew the breath from his lungs. The sadness he saw on her face was just as intense as it had been the night of their row, but there was something else there, something … brighter that had nothing to do with her but everything to do with him.  He dared not name it.
“Everything okay there, sir?” Simons’ voice crackled through the device, but his confusion was clear.
“Then we’re agreed!”  Sherlock jumped up from the floor, clapped his hands together, and began pacing about the room as he always did when formulating a plan inside his head.  “Good.  We’ll start packing things up tomorrow, then.  Rent is paid up through the middle of next month, so I’ll not need to worry about another flatmate until at least –“
John Watson’s head snapped back as the sound of a passing lorry with bad breaks rattling down Baker Street pulled him back to reality.  For a moment he couldn’t figure out why he was huddled on the floor in front of the blazing fireplace wrapped in so many blankets that if he left them now he might sprout wings and flutter about the flat, but then he remembered.
He wasn’t quite sure why he felt the compulsion to protect this man he barely knew, but the pull on his conscience was undeniable.
She stared at the remains of the countless types of hardwood Sherlock had used for testing, far more than had originally been on the table when she had left for work.  Each plank of wood had been labelled in chalk before shavings had been painstakingly carved from along the grain:  Hickory, White Oak, Beech, Green Ash, Black Walnut, Cherry, Hackberry, and more, but the one that drew her attention, the piece that caused her stomach to turn and her heart to ache, required no label.
Mary leaned back in her chair, and studied the two men across from her.  Frustration, shame, anger, and dread radiated out in varying degrees of intensity depending on the man, but it was their guilt, so palpable it nearly choked her, that assaulted her heart.  It weighed on each of them like the thick snows of an avalanche she had witnessed in the Alps years ago: heavy, cold, suffocating … deadly.
John woke from his reverie and looked up from the icepack in his hand to the room in which he sat.  His brow furrowed with confusion.  “Sherlock.  Why am I in your bed”
“They are at that,” Mary agreed.  She had needed to clear her throat of memories and emotion before responding.
,” he said pointedly, looking down at her, “the thought of you leaving permanently is quite simply intolerable, and if that means that I have to learn to do better … to
It wasn’t the utter destruction of the kitchen that stopped Joanna cold.  That was par for the course with every experiment Sherlock ran.  It had taken the better part of six months and countless rows, but Joanna had finally convinced him that if she ever had to clean up another one of his tests, she would do so completely heedless of the results he may have generated in the process.  Sherlock had become
But Joanna couldn’t breathe anymore. It was too thin. Thready.  Her shaking legs finally gave way beneath her.  She felt the side of her head connect with the edge of the table as she fell.
Sherlock approached the police car at the Westbourne Grove end of the crime scene and saw that the front passenger side was vacant. Joanna had chosen to sit in the back of the car, leaving free the seat that would make Sherlock the least uncomfortable – physically and psychologically – during the 20-minute drive to the Yard.
Normally at this point in an investigation, when he was within a few clues of unveiling the killer, Sherlock was riding high on the adrenaline of the case, and though he felt the zing of anticipation, he was unable to tap into it to restore his flagging reserves of energy. He felt hollow and for the life of him, could not determine why.
of you – that because John and I are together that I would be what kept you apart.  Do you have any idea how insulting that is?  I don’t care what’s typical, what’s traditional, or what society’s expectations are when it comes to love and relationships.  I
There was only one voice that followed her into the darkness.  It was deep and rich like polished rosewood.
Should he have taken Joanna to lunch? Perhaps.  It’s what a friend would do, Sherlock supposed, flicking the ash of the end of the cig before brining back to his lips.  He did enjoy spending time with her, though he still couldn’t completely pin down why.   Joanna Watson was a constant study in contrasts that left Sherlock feeling more firmly grounded then he had ever been in his life while at the same time hopelessly wrong-footed in terms of his reactions to her.
John stopped his circumnavigation of the tea stain and looked up when he heard change in Sherlock’s voice.  It was damn near empathetic.  Blue eyes held gray for a long moment and saw the silent sympathy of personal experience that lay there.  It won’t be a problem, the eyes said.
you called us in. Nine days ago to be precise.” Sherlock grasped a piece of lower intestine with his forceps and shone the torch light on it from beneath.  Still nothing
Few ever really looked beyond the iconic skyline. Oh, they saw the landmarks – Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, The Eye, the Palace of Westminster – but that wasn’t
Sherlock was about to reply to Lestrade’s observations when their attention was grabbed by an altercation at the front door to the shop.
"I chose this, Sherlock.  I don’t chase around half of London with you every bloody night just because I need a cheap flatshare, and it’s time you understood that."
Joanna took a thoughtful sip from her wine glass. “Something like that, yeah. Most people – Lestrade, Donovan, Mike, and the like – don’t see past the short doctor in the cuddly jumpers with the warm smile.  They forget about the soldier, which means they don’t see the other side of me. I’m okay with that, but the killer I became out of necessity in Afghanistan is still with me, Sherlock. She’s in here,” Joanna tapped her chest with her index finger, “ready to kill again if it’s necessary to keep you safe; a bit of her popped out the other night, though, and that wasn’t okay.”
Tamping down on the fury and sorrow that fought for dominance within her, Joanna plucked each of the files from Sherlock’s fingers with one hand before holding out the pipe in her other.
“I know you don’t, so I’m going to try to explain it so you do.”  Joanna had reached out and tugged on one of the lapels of Sherlock’s Belstaff, pulling him closer. She looked up at him, and Sherlock had been shocked by the unexpected emotion he saw there.
dance, and he’ll find a way to use me against you whether I’m here at your side or hiding in some Costa Rican jungle.  Personally, I think we each stand a better chance together than we do apart.”
Mrs Hudson has asked me to go with her to your grave today.  One month, after all. I told her I would.
Donovan grabbed Joanna’s arm as she turned for the door.  Jo tensed. She thought she heard Lestrade shout at them, but she wasn’t certain because Donovan continued speaking.
Reese,” he said with a polite nod and hoped that Joanna would be pleased for she had spoken highly of her instructor these last months.
“Oh come now, John.  Don’t be thick.  Even you are familiar with the meanings of basic roots:  poly, meaning ‘many;’
colleagues.  If fact, John Watson was the first person to whom he had ever applied that label.  This simple army doctor.  No.  Not simple.  Simple suggested commonplace, and Sherlock had known from the moment he had walked into the lab at St. Bart’s that John Watson was anything but commonplace.  The question was why?  The doctor’s intellect was above that of Lestrade’s minions, but certainly nothing to equal his own.  What was it about this man that left Sherlock wanting to learn more?  Hear more?
Sherlock had never seen the final take, so he had watched intently as he appeared on the small screen, sitting in his leather chair in front of the window in Baker Street
Mary Morstan chuckled at the scepticism in his voice.  Downing the rest of her scotch in one swig, she pressed an affectionate kiss to the tip of the old man’s nose before grabbing the bottle and the remaining glasses.  “A thousand times over, love,” she called over her shoulder.  “A thousand times over.”
The harmony had shattered four days ago.  Though he had sent off a quick text at half eleven to let Mary know he was alive, John nevertheless returned home so late that the eastern horizon of the isle was stained pink.  He had ignored all of Mary’s queries then and since, and rarely left the small study, not even to sleep.  According to Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock had grown increasingly taciturn and sullen, growling at everyone and everything, eventually slamming the door in the landlady’s face and locking it with a pointed “click.”  Three days ago, Mary had watched with horrified amazement as Lestrade had been forced to throw the pair off the crime scene of a suspicious drowning.  “Won’t talk to each other!  Won’t even bloody well
Mary had seen this coming for weeks now.  She wasn’t a dullard, after all.  Though she would never come close to the keenness of mind that Sherlock possessed, Mary was quite intelligent and exceedingly perceptive in her own right.  Sherlock’s words – more or less – not hers, but really, there was only so much tension a person could take.  John and Sherlock had apparently reached their limits and the proverbial dam had broken.  Now they were all struggling to keep their heads above the water.

tempting! She was already annoyed and in considerable pain from the injury to say nothing about ruining her favourite pair of jeans, and had little patience for his huffing, puffing, and drama queen performance.
“I … well, they hardly have to say anything to one another anymore.”  Greg ran a hand through his already dishevelled grey hair.  “They anticipate.  It’s like they’re speaking their own language and none of the rest of us even know where to find the primer.”
“John,” Sherlock’s voice was so quiet that John nearly missed it.  The doctor turned on the tread.  He was now eye to eye with the much taller man.  Sherlock rested his hand on top of the post, clenching the decorative knob with his fingers as he looked at the other man.  There was much he wanted to say, but the words were more cumbersome than fluid for once.  Simpler was better, he decided.  “Thank you, John.  Thank you for saving my life tonight.”
“Yes.  An extremely rare condition, according to your doctors; as in all things, my dear Doctor, you continue to be the exception to the rule.”
“A beginning, I should think,” Sherlock said in all seriousness before standing and walking to his bedroom. Moments later, Joanna heard the door shut behind him, and she couldn’t stop the bewildered laugh that escaped her lips.
.  She should be able to force it back, but it resurged unbidden.  The dead soldier in her howled with humiliation.
“She’s thirty-eight, Sherlock, not eighty. And I’d remind you that it was a year that brought her into your life to begin with, you git. Something I thank God for every time you set foot on a crime scene.” Lestrade ignored Sherlock’s glare. “The least you could do is acknowledge it.  A card seems –“
She could have spent her second night out of 221B with Lestrade. He knew what Sherlock could be like and had extended Joanna an open invitation to kip in his guest room should she ever need it, but she was still riled up enough that she wasn’t willing to risk alienating even more friends.
“Running’s not exactly your style, anyway. You’re more the ‘take the idiot by the tie and waistcoat’ kinda girl.”
having Joanna Watson arrested, Sally.  End of story.  If anything, you should count yourself lucky if Jo doesn’t file a complaint against
Sherlock looked down at Joanna nestled underneath his arm.  Face slack with sleep, she seemed far more at peace than she had since the pool.  Suddenly Sherlock wanted more than anything than to keep it that way.  Keep her safe from the schemes being planned should Moriarty reappear and insist that the game continue to its inescapable conclusion.
She and Sherlock had only been sharing a flat for about six weeks, so she was just getting used to Sherlock’s “moods.” The deep sighs, the dramatic flops on the sofa, the whole ‘I am too weary for this world’ affectation was initially rather upsetting to Joanna who hated to see her friend so dismayed. Her concern rapidly flared to irritation at the frequency and futility of such tempers, but eventually she began to see them as simply another facet of Sherlock’s eccentric nature. After awhile, she almost found them endearing …
Permitting himself one last glance at the city beyond 55 Whitehall, Sherlock turned from familiar skyline and took the stairs down to the street.  He had an appointment in the Marylebone Road, and it wouldn’t do to be late.
me what had happened, I would not be here now.  I know that you wouldn’t do that to me. You’re a good man, John, if a bit bewildered right now.”
The consulting detective took a deep breath and surprisingly leaned into Joanna’s gentle hand.  She sighed in relief.  It seemed the hard drive was finally coming back on line.  He swallowed, eyes narrowing slightly as he refocused on Joanna.
He’s still suspended, but Greg called in a favour at the Yard for bloody sniffer dogs to be brought in for a drugs bust. Not Donovan and Anderson thank God. I think he knew that I wouldn’t have been able to control myself in that event.  Publically offing a pair of coppers no matter how vile they are is just a bit not good, I guess.
John stared at the dying embers of the fire and collected his thoughts; when he spoke again it was with the detached, clinical voice of a physician.  “That the mind reacts to psychological trauma in ways we don’t fully understand, and a panic attack is a perfectly normal reaction to the danger and stress I experienced tonight, especially considering my established history with PTSD.”
So while they worked on the case together, they did so separately.  It was awkward and tense, even the most obtuse of the Yarders couldn’t help but notice, but it was necessary for the consulting detective and his blogger.
He caught her look of discomfort and embarrassment and huffed with irritation. “It was a fair question. It’s true that the violin does hold great value to me, but there is something else.  Something that is, as you said,
Sherlock took one deep breath and then another, nervously tapping out a rhythm against the fine weave of his trouser leg as he sought for a response to a question he didn’t fully understand himself.
Sherlock disposed of the first swab, reached for another, and wiped it carefully against the largest of her lacerations.   Joanna lurched again, and this time the chair in which she was sitting skidded back across the kitchen floor.
life.” He leaned heavily against the edge of the table and searched Mary’s eyes.  “Are you serious?”  Her head cocked again. “Right. Of course you’re serious.  I get it,” he said.  “Just point that eyebrow someplace else, would you?”
“What's the best way to put this?  Well,  You see, you have … Hyp … Hippo ...”  Greg rubbed his face.  “The doctors keep telling me, but I can never get it right. How do you pronounce it, Mycroft?”
They can’t hear her, of course, but it still makes for a pleasant evening. Joanna stays with Mrs Hudson until her friend retires for the night, closing her bedroom door behind her.
Joanna thinks of the blinking cursor and the empty page. Of her gun, lying loaded at the bottom of a drawer.
The first few pages are recipes for breads and puddings and stews, some handwritten in a spiked, old-fashioned script and others clipped from the pages of time-yellowed newspapers and magazines. She turns each brittle page carefully, with the tips of her fingers.
This, of course, is a grievous tactical error on Mycroft’s part; Sherlock immediately begins to sing the word
“You’re a key component of the spell it’s feeding on, Sherlock – as far as that fire is concerned, you’re about as magical as it gets.” She pauses, letting the blood pool in her palm. “Also, I sewed protection spells into all of your clothes.”
“It’s an automatic process,” Sherlock says, his voice deliberately cool. “My mind can’t help but draw conclusions from the data presented by your appearance and behaviour; it’s not something I can control. I thought you understood that.”
“Oh, I know that face,” Mrs. Hudson says, and dishes another spoonful of peas onto Joanna’s plate. “Wants you to go running off to another one of his crime scenes, does he? With your poor shoulder and the chill in the air—”
“You were having a nightmare.” Sherlock’s voice from a chair on the other side of the room. He’s watching the news with the sound off, his back to her. The pink phone sits beside him on the armrest, within easy reach of his twitching fingers. “I didn’t want to wake you – once we hear from him, it will likely be some time before your next opportunity for a nap.”
Death reached into his cloak and drew out a twisted, bone-white horn. It looked to be hollow, but when Death raised it, the air around them filled with the golden smell of a harvest feast, of ripe, full fruits and warm-baked bread. The girl accepted the horn and tucked it close under her arm. “You intend to take the hermit at moonrise,” she said.
—” as Joanna makes two more neat stitches with the black thread of her housedress. “Joanna,” she says, “Joanna, that voice—”
“For this spell? Twenty-nine. One each year since I killed Peter.” He goes to reach into the breast pocket of his coat, and then hesitates. “I’ve prepared a list of names and burial locations, if you’ll allow me.”
Joanna rubs her hand over her eyes. “Better not. I’m awake now, anyway.” She reaches out and clicks on her bedside lamp. Sherlock steps into the light, and his shadow stretches long behind him, out into the corridor.
Joanna turns from the window, but the other woman’s eyes are still fixed on the glowing screen of her mobile. “You didn’t just read about my grandmother in a file, did you? You knew her.”
Joanna can’t decide whether she should be offended or pleased; she settles for tearing another fistful of spiny-leafed weeds from their grip in the dirt.
Sherlock closes the little blue book. He turns it over in his hands, tracing its shape with his fingers and thumb. He doesn’t look at the body sleeping in the bed.
The fire laughs as it watches its heart crumble to ash in the shadow’s fist; laughs as the flames of its body gutter and die in the sudden dark. The laughter fades with the light, and the shadow goes with it. Joanna hears the ping of the sewing needle as it falls to the bricks.
“There will be a price.” The woman’s hand slides down to cover Joanna’s eyes. “There’s always a price.”
, the lock does not quite say, and a moment later the sigils flare blue and white with heat. The door rattles like a caged animal in its frame, echoed by every door along the hallway, and the sound grows louder and fiercer until there’s a hard click from inside the lock. The sound stops, and the corridor is still.
“Nonsense,” Mrs. Hudson says. “Brave girl like you – you’ve nothing to apologise for.” She presses a clean tea towel into Joanna’s hands. “Now: cup of tea or nip of something stronger?”
“If I wanted him to know, I’d tell him myself.” She looks away, toward the clutter of books and papers on his desk. “Not that he’d believe me.”
“There are other ways,” a familiar voice says. Adrienne, Alice, Anthea, Anita, Augusta. So many names, and not one of them real. Joanna hears the sound of her shoes against the pavement. “I can help her, if you’ll let me.”
Moriarty pulls a flick knife from his breast pocket and opens it with a practised jerk of his wrist. In a single, smooth movement he leans down and cuts the plastic binding her ankles together. “Get the good doctor inside. If she tries to dislocate anything else, shoot her.” He opens the other door and steps out, the book tucked under his arm. The door slams shut behind him.
He nods, but now that she’s looking she can see that his fingers are clutching the edge of the mattress, his knuckles almost white.
Gran snatches the letter from Joanna’s hand and fixes her with a piercing stare. “What did he say to you?”
“Gathering what information he can before the trail goes cold.” Sherlock makes a derisive noise and turns to the window. Alice looks up from the mobile and meets Joanna’s eyes. “If you’ve learnt anything that might be useful in the search—”
Adrienne drops the cigar box to the desk and steps in close, her heels giving her the advantage of height. Joanna has to look up slightly to meet her eyes, and she finds that the one thing more unsettling than the other woman’s indifference is the chilling depth of her undivided attention. “Magic is not a hobby, Joanna, and it is not a toy to be tossed aside once you’ve outgrown fairy stories and your fear of the dark. You made your mother’s mistakes, and now out of sheer bloody-minded stubbornness you’ve reduced yourself to this – a doctor who knows nothing about healing, and a broken soldier with a stolen gun.” She sneers. “You’re a liability, and if James Moriarty gets what he wants, it will be your fault.”
“Not exactly.” She closes the box of albums and sets it behind her, on the floor. She opens the next box in the stack. “Just bring me all the books you find. I’ll remember it when I see it.”
“No trouble. Just thought you should know.” He sits back, crossing his legs at the knee, and drops the book onto the seat beside him. “I thought we’d take this opportunity to have a bit of a chat. You must have questions.”
“You know, you’ve put me in a very awkward position,” she tells Seostris’ body, and crawls under the table. Just in time, too – at the back of the house, a door slams. A single pair of footsteps rings down the corridor.
Joanna nods. When she’s sure of her voice, she says, “My parents died when I was twelve. I lived with her until I left for university.” She sits in the chair beside his, slipping the cane from his suddenly loose grip. “But then, you already knew that.”
In the bag she finds her grandmother’s leather sewing case, her wooden cane, and the recipe book. A yellow Post-It clings to the cardboard cover of the book, just over the tall, robed woman’s worn face.
“An annoying habit of yours,” Sherlock says as he tries to coax it open with little success. “Locking things. Being
There is the sound of light footsteps on the stairs, and Joanna turns to see Mycroft opening the door to the cellar room, poised and crisply pressed as always. He pauses slightly at the threshold, glancing around the room as though marking the changes since the last time he’d been inside.
Her grip on his sleeve is tight enough to strain the seams; she makes herself let go. “Better start walking if we’re going to find a taxi,” she says, and turns away before she can see the look on his face. She picks a direction and begins to walk.
The midday sun crossed the sky, and the widow polished the stone until it glowed like gold. When she looked at the stone she saw herself as a young bride dancing in her wedding clothes, as an orphan girl selling flowers in the street, and she saw the grove of white trees, but she did not see her beloved.
Broken glass litters the ground around Mrs Hudson’s kitchen door, small shards glinting blue in the light of the fire. Joanna pinches one carefully between her fingers and raises it to her nose. It stinks of smoke and bitter magic.
Joanna laughs, but it comes out strange. “No, it’s nothing like that. I just—” She starts down the stairs, barefoot and slightly unsteady. “I have a spell book, but I’m – I’m improvising, really, and it’s been almost twenty years since I did anything like this.” She reaches the last step and stops. “Actually, I’ve never done anything like this. Not by myself.”
There is a sound like the wind over water, like the scrape of branches against glass. The floor shivers under her feet, rippling as she begins to sink into the stone.
; the list of ingredients has been scratched out and revised many times, and the paper is mottled dark by stains. The final note at the bottom of the last page reads,
The girl stood from her chair beside the old man’s bed. “Then there is nothing to be done for you,” she said, and blew out the candle.
,” she tells it, and makes the first stitch deep in the life line of her left hand. Blood wells as she draws the thread through her skin, dying the white silk a deep red.
“I could be wrong,” Joanna says, “but I think there are sigils for invisibility written on these tyres.”
Joanna stands, brushing the dark soil from her trousers. There’s dirt embedded deep in the places over her knees, but she doesn’t find that she particularly minds. “I’m always in favour of sandwiches,” she says, and turns to go into the house.
“No, no, no,” Joanna says, and tries to push herself up. Her arms collapse beneath her, and she falls again. Her mouth tastes like ash. “No, no hospital. Sleep. I only need sleep.”
She doesn’t look at his face. She admires his mind for all its cold brilliance, but she doesn’t think she could bear to see indifference in his eyes now. She stares over his head at the empty wall. “Well?”
Mycroft turns to the end of the book. Standing at his side, Joanna can see the bloodstain seeping through the thick paper, and the title printed in a slender, old-style script across the top of the page:
The seventh vial is broken, shattered when she knocked the cigar box to the floor; she gently pulls the cork from the intact vial beside it.
Joanna doesn’t need to look into Thompson’s eyes to see the pity there. “You would’ve revived her against her wishes, so you wouldn’t be left alone.”
“You wouldn’t,” Gran says, but the light blinks out a moment later. Joanna switches on her pocket torch and listens to her grandmother’s footsteps behind her. The soft click of her cane on stone steps. “Astrology is rubbish.”
She buries her fingers in the clay man’s chest and digs out a coiled slip of white paper. She unrolls it clumsily with her right hand, pressing it open against her thigh.
Joanna leans down and looks into the car. “I could be wrong,” she says, “but I think there are sigils for invisibility written on these tyres.”
The house takes her eyes and shows her the sitting room in 221B filled with black smoke. Mrs Hudson crouches on the floor in front of the fireplace, trying to reach something on the mantel without raising her head too high or dislodging the tea towel that covers her nose and mouth, and Joanna cannot imagine, cannot
Harry’s gone quiet, and Joanna tugs her arm until she’s sitting back against the headboard. “Here,” Joanna says, offering her the glass of water she keeps on her bedside table. “Drink this.”
Branches whip at her face, thorns snagging in the thin paper of her blue jumpsuit, but she doesn’t slow. She hurtles through the mud, over the rotting bodies of fallen trees. She runs until the harsh sound of her breath fills her ears, but the shadow stays small in the distance, in the dark spaces between the trees – always just in sight, just out of her reach.
Late afternoon sun streams into the corridor, painting the floorboards. Joanna stands in front of the attic door and, for the first time in years, tries the knob. It’s locked.
Fire swallows her grandmother’s arm from elbow to fingertips, a pale, unnatural flame that spirals high in the air over her open hand and turns the letter to ash within seconds. Then the ashes themselves burn away, and the fire is gone. Gran’s arm falls to her side, and Joanna barely manages to catch her before she slumps to the floor, exhausted.
Harry says something soft, something Joanna cannot hear, and Sherlock lets the woman kneel beside them. Joanna cannot see her, but she feels the cool touch of the woman’s fingers and thumb against her forehead. Feels the touch, and the terrible depth of her magic.
“A mirror.” He flicks it open with his thumb. “Good, it’s intact; I’d worried the fall might’ve cracked it.”
Mycroft looks at the chaos around them – the sloping stacks of books on the table, the maps and papers pinned to the walls. He takes a step back, towards the open door. “We are safe here on family land, but James Moriarty knows we have what he wants. He will not wait forever. When Joanna wakes, decisions will have to be made.”
A muscle in Mycroft’s cheek twitches, a flinch so subtle that after a moment Joanna wonders if she saw it at all. “Kept, are you?” he says to Adrienne, his tone carefully light. “And here I was under the impression that you lived life free as the proverbial bird.”
“I am not incapable of optimism, Sherlock. When the situation calls for it.” Mycroft pauses in the doorway, one hand against the frame. “You haven’t seen her since we arrived.”
The girl stood silent for a long moment. Then she lifted her stubborn chin. “I want a blade as sharp as blood is red,” she said to Death, “with a shaft as long as night is black.”
It’s a storybook. The paper is yellow-edged and thick, the typeface familiar in its old style slenderness.
,” she says, but she cannot make herself say all of it, even when he cannot hear. Her fingers brush his cheek, his jaw; she feels the bristle of his growing beard and the soft heat of his skin and then she is slipping down through the cracks in the foundation, past cold earth and clay and deep into the waiting water.
Joanna smells copper, feels the weight of it sour on her tongue and the hum of strange magic against her teeth.
The hermit watched from his bed, his clever eyes open wide in the moonlight. “Girl,” he said, “you are cut.”
“He’s testing me,” she says. She looks past Sherlock, into the light of a streetlamp prismed by rain. “Moriarty. This was a test.”
“I know. That’s what she told me.” Harry’s hand finds hers in the dark. “But it’s not quite true, is it?”
“Peter Barrow was the first, chosen merely out of convenience. He was the right age, and I was already familiar with the house, having been a guest here several times. I entered while Amelia was sleeping and took Peter from his bed. He was small, and easy to carry over the wall and into the wood.” Moran reaches out and touches Mrs Barrow’s hand. “Had the matter been less urgent I would of course have taken a stranger’s child instead. I am truly sorry, Amelia, that I had no other choice.”
Joanna’s about to follow when she notices the potpourri satchel hanging below Madame Seostris’ sign. The satchel’s a drab little thing compared to the elegant script above – it’s been embroidered with a sigil of some kind, but the stitching is crooked and hastily done. A blessing, maybe, or an inscription of welcome. Not one she recognises or remembers. She leans forward to smell it and reels back, coughing.
Joanna lifts the lid and sees a dead starling lying on the bottom of the box, its delicate feet curled and stiff. “Gran, you—”
“He’s one of Moriarty’s lieutenants.” Sherlock’s voice from a shadow in the corner of the room, kept safe there by the firm, sheltering embrace of the oak’s roots. “He wants you to hurt him, Joanna. He wants to test you. That’s why he hired Boyle, why he exposed the bodies—”
She reaches out with a steady hand and takes the letter. “Nice to meet you, Sebastian,” she says, and closes the door behind her.
“I see it now,” Sherlock says from the door. He leans against the frame, his arms folded across his chest. His voice is slow, almost lazy. Deliberate. “It’s the appeal of the contradiction. That stimulating soupcon of cognitive dissonance – the doctor and the soldier. The garden and the gun.” He pauses, his eyes fixed on hers. “The cornucopia and the scythe.”
The waitress kicks them out before they have time to do much damage, and they stumble out onto the street, breathless with laughter. Sherlock slouches elegantly against a lamppost, smirking as she tries to shake the bit of pork free from inside her top. It involves an embarrassing amount of hopping on her part, and he starts to snicker.
Joanna watches the body slump forward onto the table, blood and brain matter spilling onto the wood.
‘And you have lived a long, good life. Your beloved died in his sleep, a fat happy old man who loved you with his whole wealthy heart. Twice he was meant to die, and twice you were allowed to keep him. Would you dare ask again?’
“I saw something,” the frizzy-haired tech says, still kneeling over the body, almost in tears. “When it happened, I saw someone in the trees—”
“Why are you so annoyed with me?” He hadn’t meant to ask that, but it had been itching at him since Sherlock had turned taciturn in the cab coming home.  John was becoming inured to Sherlock’s silences – he had learned to interpret these moods from observing the man’s body language – but this one was strange. It just hadn’t felt like the others, yet by the time they pulled up to the kerb in front of 221B, Sherlock’s silence had been replaced with frustrated monologue tinged with hints of anger.
,” he said, reaching out toward her.   It all made sense in his head. Why couldn’t he make her understand?
“The new obstetrician, Dr Lannister.” Mycroft settled himself into a comfortable chair and indicated that Lestrade should do the same. “As you know, Joanna is responding well to treatment, and the doctors are comfortable in discharging her two days hence.  However, she is still in a rather delicate position where the Hyperemesis Gravidarum is concerned. Apparently it would be very easy for the morning sickness to get out of control again.  Dr Watson will need looking out for until the danger is well past for her and the child.”
– protected Sherlock from danger had come as a bit of as surprise, yet it served to highlight the fact that John Watson was neither
Okay fine.  Yes, I did it to get her out of my hair for a while, but she appreciated the gesture, so what does it matter?  The fact that her cruise is at the same time that Greg is tied up at the Yard with the first round of his reinstatement hearings is just coincidence.
“I purposefully didn’t choose the other two.” Sherlock gestured wildly in the direction of her room upstairs.  “The carvings on them are exquisite whereas this one –“
“It’s all fine, Sherlock,” Joanna assured him. She took another sip of her wine, and snagged a piece of the mellow, rich cheese from the platter. “Of the two, I’m pretty sure that it will be
He enjoyed being with Joanna, he concluded as he took another drag on the cigarette, and he didn’t like spending time with
The first thing John noticed when he came back to himself was that the flames had diminished to glowing coals in the fireplace.  He still sat on the floor, but he was no longer alone.  Sherlock sat behind him; his long arms held John closely, and his even longer legs were wrapped along side of John’s, creating a cocoon of safety that had drawn John out of his horror.
Lestrade turned to face Donovan and Anderson. “Now, before we finish up here, the three of us are going to have a little chat about what kind of behaviour I expect from my team at a bloody crime scene!"
A slight grin tugged at the corner of John’s mouth at Sherlock’s sarcasm, but he refused to take the bait.  Too much needed to be said.
It was but the work of a few moments for Dr Lannister to understand Mycroft’s role in Joanna Watson’s health care, and just minutes more for him to learn that all was progressing as hoped, that the results of Joanna’s ultrasound were normal, and that a follow up would be scheduled in a month’s time.  Mycroft left the doctor with a threatening smile and a promise to call for further information as it was deemed necessary.
They left once the sun came up and took a cab back to the flat.  Joanna had fallen asleep against Sherlock’s shoulder halfway home.  Due to a trio of late night cases, sleep and Joanna had not been frequent acquaintances that week, so Sherlock had offered the cabbie a 50 quid tip if he drove around London for an hour so she could sleep a bit more before returning to Baker Street.
Joanna set down the large paper bag she carried, and pulled her mobile from the pocket of her good coat.  Sherlock noted that she wore a new dress – a rarity – that suited her and enhanced the dark blue of her eyes.  Her hair hung in long, loose curls over her shoulders and down her back. She tucked an errant lock behind her right ear, and thumbed open the phone.
Joanna Watson was a highly tactile person. She thrived on touch as he did on data. A bit surprising considering the abuse of her childhood, but as she was a doctor, so it stood to reason that such physicality was an intrinsic response.  Pre-programmed to nurture, so to speak, but Sherlock couldn’t truly classify her touch as purely clinical. His parents had been physically affectionate when he was a child; Mycroft and he never suffered from a lack of hugs and kisses – much to their dismay – but since Uni, when things became increasingly awkward for him where other people were concerned, Sherlock had often gone out of his way to avoid physical contact whenever possible.
This chapter was a bit of a struggle to complete.  It went through many variations, and I'm still not certain that it works the way that I really want it to work.  Nonetheless, I hope that you enjoy it.  My thanks to all those who what given me kudos, bookmarked this story, or left comments on the previous chapter.
John’s last conscious thought was that if Sherlock could coax something so achingly beautiful from what was – at its most basic components - a collection of wood, intestine, and horse hair, then the universe should count itself damn lucky that
"In the two months since Sherlock’s death you’ve lost nearly 8 per cent of your body weight.  You stand five foot four inches yet your weight is barely seven stone. You suffer from a severe electrolyte imbalance resulting in skeletal muscle weakness, headaches, confusion, and even cardiac arrhythmias.  How you managed to avoid seizing altogether is something your physicians can’t even begin to understand.  You’ve nearly exhausted your Vitamin B reserves, but thankfully there’s no evidence of lesions along your central nervous system.  Thiamine supplementation and electrolyte replacement therapy have already begun,” Mycroft said, indicating the numerous bags of fluid dripping into her central line.  “Your oesophagus is seriously abraded.  You are anaemic, and the cramping and twitching in your muscles are not the result of your experience in Afghanistan but of peripheral neuropathy.  You are, to use the vernacular, a proper
“Thinking again, Anderson?  That was your first mistake,” Sherlock bit out, before turning around to grab his tools where they lay on the counter next to the body. “Your second error was in underestimating Joanna Watson.  Given the right motivation, she could be even more dangerous than I. The key difference is that she has a generally high regard for humanity whereas I do not.”
There it was!  Tucked within the lower lobe of the left lung.  Sherlock pulled the ampoule from its cubby and dropped it into an evidence bag as he finished up his tale. He stood and turned to face a stunned Lestrade.
Joanna was braced with a trembling hand – intermittent no longer – against the solid wood of the kitchen table and willed her stomach to settle for just a few moments.  God, her head hurt.  Felt packed with cotton wool set aflame.
Of course he had agreed.   Joanna so rarely asked something personal of him that Sherlock wasn’t going to decline simply because the sentiment made no sense to him whatsoever.  However, in their months living together, Sherlock found himself strangely willing to push his boundaries of and tolerance for sentiment where Joanna Watson was concerned. It was confusing, to be sure.
Lestrade had been moderately appalled when Sherlock let slip that he wasn’t attending the party – the DI knew that parties weren’t really Sherlock’s ‘thing’ – but he had been apoplectic when he discovered that Sherlock didn’t even intend to make his excuses let alone send a card.
“Others …” Joanna grimaced and turned away. “Look, I find it difficult …” She brought her hand to her mouth and Sherlock heard her stifle a groan before drawing her shoulders up and turning back toward him. “I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.  You know that. B-but I need you to understand …”
it, but now ...  Jo met Sherlock’s anxious gaze and plucked the strings that ran over the fingerboard as she had seen him do countless times. Their atonal sound reflected the tension that had settled in the room.
So when the countless shared stories eventually made their way around to childhood histories, Joanna had confided in him just a bit of what it had been like growing up in Devonshire with her alcoholic father and brother after her granda died.  She gave him only a glimpse of Hell, but Greg hadn’t earned his rank and position with just a wink and a smile – best of a bad lot, indeed – he was more than competent at putting the clues together and in reading between the lines. He had been sympathetic and supportive enough – Hell, Joanna, call it what it is – Lestrade had been down right incensed on her behalf over what had happened decades ago, so she was pretty certain that the DI would storm over to Baker Street to read Sherlock the riot act if he knew what had happened just the other night.  That wouldn’t solve anything.  This was between Joanna and Sherlock, and it needed to stay that way.  They had to solve this themselves if they stood any chance of remaining flatmates let alone friends.
of a day where pure happenstance or fate or whateverthehellyouwannacallit became the only reason she was still alive.
Lestrade couldn’t help but chuckle. Joanna always cursed a blue streak when she or Sherlock was hurt (common), afraid (rarely), or properly worked up (often enough when Sherlock was alive, though significantly less since he died). And now she had managed to work herself up into a full temper; something her doctors had made quite clear should be avoided at all costs.
“Ah … well, Jennifer Pahra continues to improve in hospital.  Lestrade mentioned that she is expected to make a full recovery in spite of losing most of her left ear. Apparently a cousin will keep her antiquities store until she is able to work again, and her daughter is currently staying with other relatives.  All details that I really didn’t need or care to know, but I assured Lestrade that I would tell you. He said you would want to know. So, yes, the case of the PBR Killer has come to a close.”
“Mummy?”  Lestrade didn’t even try to hide his amusement as Mummy Holmes wrapped her son in a perfunctory hug before getting right to the issue.
Please note that for the next several chapters, the timeline will shift through various points within the three series.  I will always list dates, but I will not list episode titles as the events of the relevant episodes should be clear within the narrative.
When she was done, Greg helped Joanna settle into the wheelchair and tucked the blanket back around her legs. “Please tell me you didn’t just throw down with the most powerful man in England.”
Sherlock’s frustration at the suspect’s escape combined with his irritation at having to take her to A&E rather than pursue the man further had led to an epic encounter with the nurses who insisted that because he wasn’t family, he couldn’t sit with Joanna during her treatment. The resulting flurry of deductions – Joanna
“Don’t apologize for that which is normal, John.  Not in here,” Sherlock gestured at the flat around them; John should feel safe in his home, “and
Dear God, for a man who had seemingly little interest in anything sexual, Sherlock kissed like he was born to it. Joanna groaned against his lips and began her own quest.  Neither one dominating but each insistent about the answers they sought.  Ignoring all previous evidence to the contrary, Joanna pushed aside her initial hesitance and accepted that this was where Sherlock and she had been heading since that first night when she had killed a cabbie to save a man she barely knew; a man who had ignited in her a passion for life that had nearly burnt out until the moment they met in the lab at Bart’s.
Turning back to the phone in his hand, Greg could hear the panic rise in his friend’s breathing on the other end of the line. University College Hospital was closer than Bart’s, but fear was confusing her normally sensible mind. “Joanna,” he said in the soothing voice he used when comforting victims, “help is on the way.” His council nodded at him in the affirmative as she provided the emergency dispatchers with the Baker Street address. “I’ll meet you at Bart’s.” Greg didn’t know if he was right or wrong, but he decided it was simpler to play along than attempt to talk her down at this point.  “You won’t be alone, luv.  I promise.”
