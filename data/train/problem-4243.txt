“The backseat’ll be way more comfortable than the ground," Dean explained, before sliding in on his back, his shoes and socks already gone. The angel took his own off before clumsily climbing on top of him.
“No,” Cas answered, sounding super serious. When he didn’t say anything else, Dean deflated a little.
Castiel was staring in awe at the omega who had gone through hell and back, and had only come out stronger. “Wow,” he muttered. “I hope I can be even half as amazing as you some day.” He’d blurted that one without thinking, as well, but this time he was okay with that. Even though he barely knew the guy, Dean was now his new hero.
Cas chuckled. "You know I can heal it." He kissed Dean on the tip of his nose. "And you know that ripping my back to shreds only makes me want you harder."
Even from Castiel’s vantage point, he could tell that Dean was blushing even harder now. “No problem, man. I just figured that we don’t really celebrate our birthdays much, but we at least have one, and you didn’t, and…” His thought wandered off as his face reddened further.
“Uh, thanks?” Cas replied, his momentum faltering at the comment. Dean mentally celebrated his success.
“You would,” Castiel insisted. “In the grand scheme of things, Dean, I’m not really all that important.”
Sam looked up from his book, confused. Somebody was knocking on the bunker’s door, when there shouldn’t really be. The only people who knew where this place was either wasn’t expected, or had their own access. He put a piece of paper between the pages to mark his spot, then left the book on his bed. He felt like he’d know if it was an emergency, since the knock didn’t sound frantic, so his curiosity was piqued.
“I’m Dean, and thanks so much for watching it,” Dean said, right before his bladder gave him another, slightly more urgent request. “I’ll be back in just a few minutes, and I wanna buy that sweater.” When Cas nodded, Dean went off in the general direction of where the bathrooms were supposed to be.
“I never knew I wanted this,” Castiel said in a gasp. “But now that I know, I know I wanted this, you, from that first moment,” he said in a sigh as he felt the hunter’s hands on his heated flesh.
“Good,” Dean said, and they went back to kissing, and then some. After they were finally done defiling the backseat of the Impala, which Castiel would clean up before they left, Dean grabbed his phone from the pocket of his jeans, which had landed on the steering wheel at some point. He got an evil grin on his face before he opened up the camera app.
Seeing through Castiel's feeble attempt at feigning sleep, Dean pulled up the corner of the pillow. "Would you forgive me if I made you coffee?"
“You didn’t have to go that far,” Dean squeaked as he made his way down the stairs.
Crowley shifted nervously in his seat, and Castiel couldn’t help but laugh silently to himself. As he’d guessed when Dean got the text, this was just another excuse for him to hit on Dean, and if Castiel hadn’t been there, the demon would probably be trying to get him to go somewhere for a date, even though he wouldn’t call it that.
"Why do you think I do it so much?" Castiel drawled, reaching for the broken handle that led to the drawer with the lube. He popped the lid, and was about to squeeze some out when Dean grabbed his wrist.
Crowley blew Dean a kiss. “You’ll change your mind eventually, Winchester,” he said in the most obviously flirting voice he could muster.
“Seriously, Cas?” Dean responded, his anger reaching yet another new level that he didn’t even know that he could feel before today.
"I wouldn't act evil if I didn't love you so much," Castiel countered. They both smiled like the fools that they were, and leaned in at the same time for a proper good morning kiss. It was sweet and warm, promising of more mornings like this, of good days and bad and everything in between, and it promised that no matter what happened, they would get through it together.
“I think I like that idea,” Dean said softly, before kissing Castiel lightly on the nose. “It sounds just right.”
But with this wonderful, well thought out present in his hand and an awkward Dean only inches away only moments ago, Castiel decided that he at least wanted to do something, no matter how small. Not normally spontaneous like this, Castiel stepped over to Dean, who was still a shade of red, and pulled him into a hug. That was something that Dean was almost always okay with. But when they pulled away, the angel did something he’d never even thought to do before. He leaned over and put a quick, light kiss on Dean’s cheek.
Cas waited for Dean to continue, but when he didn’t, the angel could help but impatiently ask. “And?”
Castiel let out a nervous laugh. "Yeah, definitely," he choked out. "Gotta get me those discounts." The fact that he wasn't already halfway to an asthma attack proved that his anxiety didn't hate him too much. Yet.
It took Dean about twenty minutes of searching the usual sites to find a potential mini vampire nest, maybe three vamps tops, that was within easy driving distance from the bunker. It took twice that long to convince both Sam and Cas that he’d be okay to hunt like this. It was only by letting Cas come with him that he was able to get the okay he never would’ve needed if he still had his penis and the rest of his man body. No wonder Jo always got so frustrated when they refused to let her come along on their hunts.
“Are you sure you’re up to this right now, Dean?” Cas asked, obviously trying to not look condescending as he said it, though the words themselves made it kind of a moot point.
She handed the plate back to the confused angel, and when he just stared at her, she mimed eating. “Try some, I’m sure you’ll love it,” Mrs. Butters told him when he still didn’t eat.
“Shit!” was Dean’s first response at seeing Castiel behind him. He hastily pulled his shirts down, though the blush easily told Castiel that Dean most likely knew exactly what the angel had just seen. “It’s not what it looks like,” he rushed out. “It was… a gag gift? I was out of clean boxers? I mean, it’s not like...” Dean babbled, his blush deepening as he spoke.
Dean squeezed back. “Yeah, I get it,” he said nervously. “And there’s nothing wrong with being gay, or bi, but still…”
“So you like the little bow?” Dean purred, leaning in towards the angel, eyes already blown with lust. “I have others with little bows,” he teased. “Maybe I can show you them, too.”
"But I'm oblivious and stupid sometimes," Castiel finished for him, even though those weren't the words Dean would've chose. "Really stupid," Castiel repeated, looking at Dean again, marveling at just how green his eyes were. He'd never been close enough to notice before.
“I knew it!” Sam shouted. “I gotta text Crowley, he just lost the bet!” Still laughing like it was the most hilarious thing to ever happen in all existence, Sam grabbed his phone and started furiously typing before he even left the room.
"Oh," was all Charlie said, and after that, they remained silent.
A few seconds past the normal time length that it should’ve taken for a person to reply, Dean managed to croak out, “My booth?”
“I don't want you to get hurt,” Cas admitted, starting to pace a little. Yeah, definitely not a quick fix. “It… it hurts me to see you in pain, Dean.”
“The last three months,” Castiel added in. He loved this man more than anything else, more than safety, security, more than his own Father even, but he Dean wasn’t always the brightest bulb in the deck when it came to emotions, either his own or the ones directed at him.
Cas tilted his head in confusion. “Okay?”
"And a bagel," Castiel mumbled in response.
Cas smiled, seeing exactly where this was going. Without a word, they both stood up and hurried towards the parking garage, their coffee mugs long forgotten. “We should have told Sam years ago,” Cas said as they walked excitedly. Dean laughed, his earlier embarrassment so far gone it was like it never happened.
Dean’s face fell, but he nodded. “It’s an excuse more than anything, but I’m still not used to this whole guys hitting on me thing, you know? Sam says they’ve been doing it for years, but I seriously didn’t realize it until you asked me out. So I really am sorry.”
“I would never want to make you uncomfortable, or force you into anything you don’t want to do, Dean, never,” Cas quickly responded. He desperately wanted to grab Dean’s hands, to hold them and reassure the hunter, but even as clueless as he had the tendency to be about human matters like that, he knew to stay back, to not rush anything.
“Dean, I thought,” Castiel struggled to explain his motives behind helping Metatron, but the angry hunter wasn’t willing to wait for an answer.
Sam just shook his head at them, a smile on his face. “About damn time,” he muttered as he picked up his cell phone.
Sam rolled his eyes, but figured he was getting off light since all he had to do was bring in the turkey. He was a big, strong hunter, what was thirty or so pounds of meat to carry?
“Now that’s the spirit!” Dean said with a laugh. “Gonna find you something other than just peanut butter and jelly to make you happy.” He started to dig through the bags of candy excitedly, as Castiel stared at him. Was this Dean complaining about his love of the sandwich, or was it actually just to try and make him happy?
“Thanks again,” Dean said, air toasting Cas with his coffee cup as he walked back over to his table. The older couple from earlier showed up not too long after, and then Dean was busy solid for at least ten minutes, because apparently word had spread. Kitsch sold really, really well at this place, it would seem.
“Maybe?” Dean squeaked. Literally squeaked. He never should’ve got out of bed today. He should’ve freaking known better. But no, he had to go and stupid all over himself.
Dean felt himself blushing as he put his head in his hands on the table. “So everybody knew?”
Dean trailed his fingers along Cas’ now smooth thigh. “I think we could work with this,” he said huskily. Was guys with shaved legs a kink? Because if it was, the hunter was pretty sure he had it now. Then his fingers trailed up under the skirt itself. “No underwear, too?” He asked in shock.
Castiel took one last look, seeing the front room filled with furniture and warmth, a Christmas tree with presents underneath it as two children went after the wrapping paper like they were never going to get to the toys underneath. He glanced at the kitchen, Thanksgiving dinner being pulled out of the oven, cookies being made, Jack proudly holding up his perfect apple pie as Claire sulked in the corner, stuck on peeling duty thanks to the last time she was allowed near the oven. The dining room, birthday cakes with candles lit, covered in mess after mess as holidays and play dates and crafts spread out the entire length of the table. The bedrooms upstairs, the noise of rowdy kids and loud music still echoing off the walls, the little notches on the door frame to the bathroom labeled with Claire and Jack, with two near the top labeled Dean and Castiel because Jack had insisted that they be measured too. The backyard as the sprinklers went back and forth with children jumping through the spray, the garden that was Castiel’s favorite hobby, flowers and herbs gone but only for the winter.
“‘Hut,’ duh,” Dean answered immediately. “I thought these things were supposed to be hard.”
He’d never actually tried for anything with Cas, because those same four years were spent in the closet because he was too worried about his homophobic dad’s reaction to having a bi son to actually come out. But oh, there had been some seriously pathetic pining going on, with lots of even more pathetic longing looks whenever Cas hadn’t been paying attention to him. Like now, while Cas and his redheaded companion were greeting a few of their former classmates.
But lately, Dean couldn’t seem to keep his feelings in check. He was usually so good at stuffing anything he didn’t want to deal with down deep, and if it tried to resurface he’d just drink a few cold ones and go beat the crap out of a monster or two, and his denial was sated. But lately, Cas just… was he always so good looking?
Dean nodded, glad that he wouldn’t be teased the entire ride home. He only realized his mistake when Sam turned to Eileen. ‘Dean’s new boyfriend is adorable,’ he signed.
Cas laughed, dislodging a protesting Dean, but only for a moment. "I personally prefer green eyes and freckles underneath flannel," he said softly, running his hands through Dean's hair.
“Thanks,” Castiel said, catching Dean’s eyes in the darkened car, and having trouble looking away again. They’d been having that problem a lot lately, actually…
“He’s always doing things like this,” Castiel complained, glaring at his pizza as if it had given Gabe the idea in the first place.
“You’re not supposed to tell,” Sam said, but he was cut off from saying anything more as Cas walked over and suddenly grabbed Dean’s face, pulling him into a very heavy kiss.
Going back to some slow deepthroating, Dean used his tongue to touch as many happy spots along the way in and back out again. Cas was gasping, writhing in exquisite ecstasy, and Dean couldn't have felt prouder.
“We need to talk about everything first,” Castiel reminded him, “but yes, afterwards. A rain check.”
Dean laughed. "That's a big family. It's just me, Sammy, and my parents, so huge families seem like a foreign concept almost."
Dean’s face twisted in shock, and Castiel maybe loved him a little bit more for his utter naivety. “But…” Dean finally managed, though he only got that far.
“Oughta take off the shirt too, then,” Dean suggested innocently. “White fabric gets stained super easy.”
Cas smiled, looking wicked, and Dean had never wanted anything so much in his life. Then before the hunter could do anything else, Cas’ mouth was on his, nipping, teasing, biting, and muffling the moans that Dean couldn’t help but let out.
“None,” Cas replied slyly, starting to get back into the program.
Castiel was looking through his camera lens, trying to find the best lighting for this backdrop, when he was interrupted by a pointed cough. “The lady said I can just leave the robe by the door, right?” The young man’s voice made Castiel internally wince. Not another clueless newbie. The agency was supposed to train everybody that came through before they were sent Castiel’s way, but he still ended up having to explain how the process went to at least half the new models, and this guy sounded clueless enough to make that fate all but inevitable now.
Dean immediately backpedaled, his hand going straight to Cas’ face. “I wasn’t expecting you to act like a girl,” he explained, stroking the angel’s face lightly. “I am completely okay with you not being a girl.”
“It’s drama
Shoving the incriminating sketchpad under one of the boxes he’d brought the painted wood signs in, he grabbed the Styrofoam plate holding the turnover. “If this tastes anywhere near as good as it smells, I’m in love already,” Dean muttered, already drooling as the pastry got closer to his mouth and stomach. “Thanks a bunch Cas, I love apple turnovers, and pies, and pretty much anything this delicious.”
“Sorry,” he responded, looking properly chastised. “What I meant was that we were role-playing the movie, but it was still us doing it." Dean pulled his boyfriend into a side hug, trying to reassure him. “I love you Cas, exactly as you are.”
“I guess hindsight is always twenty twenty,” Cas said with a shrug. “Now I’m extra glad to have seen you.”
“Dean,” Cas said softly, and apparently that was the perfect cure for his babbling madness because he stopped immediately to listen to what Cas had to say.
"You like riding on my cock and you know it," Cas said, right before starting to pump. By now, Dean was able to meet Cas stroke for stroke, and his nails habitually went right for the flesh on Cas' back. When he scratched over the lines from earlier, Cas let out a moan of pleasurepain that managed to get Dean harder and closer to his own release. But before he could utter a single word, Cas' hand was already clamping down tightly at the base of his borderline painful cock. "No," was all that Cas said, but it was enough.
“I’d love that,” Cas agreed, sneaking a quick look over to the empty area around the appetizer table. It was a very telling emptiness, especially since all three trays were still almost completely full this far into the reunion.
“Yeah,” Dean admitted, still blushing like a fire hydrant. “I never would’ve forced you to like that, if I’d known,” he explained desperately.
“Holy shit, that feels good,” Dean mumbled. Then he shifted his hips. “Now you’re supposed to move.” He kissed Castiel lightly to show that he wasn’t actually upset, then his head flung back as the human instincts in Castiel’s vessel took over for him.
“Stomachache,” Dean grumbled. “I could eat twice this much candy when I was little, but now I’m halfway into a freaking sugar coma.” He moaned again, only this time it was over-dramatized for a more comedic effect.
Dean parked the Impala in the grocery store’s lot, and looked at the few booths set up, and saw three little homemade parade floats waiting down the street. When Sam had said small, he’d meant it. Though it was probably pretty big for such a small place.
Dean slumped back down in his chair, his hair already back to covering his face. "Yeah, I know," he said, not bothering to move the newly long strands this time. "If it happened to anybody else, I'd be making jokes too. Especially if it was you, since you already have the hair for it."
"Then you were watching wrong," Dean growled, the threat in his voice having scared far greater beings than the angel in front of him many times.
Castiel glanced over, confused. “How’s he going to ‘destroy’ me?” He even went so far as to use air quotes. They could work together for decades before he would actually understand even half of the jokes she made, though. He tilted his head slightly as he waited for an answer.
“You almost forgot your sweater,” Cas said, finally breaking the awkward silence.
Dean let out a sigh of relief. "Oh thank god, I was regressing to high school there for a minute." He smiled in a way that made Castiel's heart flutter. "I'd give you my number, but these boxers don't really have a space to keep a phone or a pen or whatever."
Dean hummed in appreciation, adding to the beautiful music all around him.
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel said, smiling in hopes that Dean’s mood would unsour quickly. “I’d love to do that.” And agreeing to Dean’s sugary plan was apparently exactly what the hunter needed to perk right back up again.
Dean blushed, though Castiel didn’t understand what he could possibly have to be embarrassed about. “Not too bad yourself,” he replied weakly.
Dean looked so pathetically broken that it was all Castiel could do to respond by leaning in to kiss him gently on the mouth. When he pulled back, he smiled reassuringly. “I forgive you, Dean,” he said, and Dean’s face relaxed. “I forgive you this time, but next time, you should remember to listen to me,” he reprimanded his boyfriend. “If I tell you that the King of Hell is flirting with you, it’s because I know that he is. Don’t doubt me on things like this.”
“Dean, I’m an angel, we have no preferences for gender like humans do,” Cas reminded him.
Castiel chuckled good naturedly, in hopes that it helped calm Dean down a little. "I'm gay too, so I know that song and dance just as well. But I'm lucky enough to have four heterosexual siblings, so the grandkid guilt trip is usually saved for the major holidays."
"Shit, sorry about that," Dean apologized as soon as the door clicked shut.
“Thanks,” Cas grunted as he took out another divot of earth, but then went back to silence. Gotta try harder, then.
Near the end of dinner, Sam scooted his chair back loudly, letting out an aggravated huff of breath as he did so. “Okay, I seriously can’t sit here any longer watching you guys telepathically flirt with each other or whatever it is you do with the eye sex thing. It’s so damn sappy I’m gonna vomit,” Sam complained, then left the room with just his bottle of beer.
Cas smiled at him in that weird way he’d been doing it lately, like seeing Dean was the highlight of his day. It kinda made sense, though, since he was the guy’s best friend. Him and Sam got along well enough, but they’d never clicked like Dean did with Cas. Probably just counting his blessings or something. He’d have to check with Sam to see if he’d slipped Cas any more of those damn self help books again.
“I need you,” Dean muttered into Castiel’s neck, barely able to speak as they continued their light frottage.
Dean was wiping some dirt off his brow when he saw Cas’ trench coat hit the ground next to him, followed quickly by the suit jacket the angel always wore. Dean looked over and gave the angel a curious look. “I’d rather not get them dirty,” Cas said, as if it were beyond obvious.
“Really?” Jack asked, eyes as wide as the toddler’s he was supposed to be by birth years.
"I…" Castiel had no idea what to say, and had barely even started to register what all had just happened. But then the most important part hit him like a two-by-four to the face. "Wait, she said you like me too?"
They struggled against each other, still fighting for control as they slid slowly towards the bedroom. Dean won enough times that he was pushing Cas against the wall for a few moments here and there, but only won by use of subterfuge and a clever hand that found its way past Cas' belt and grabbed a perfectly sculpted ass cheek for all it was worth. Dean considered it a further victory when he was the one pushing Cas through the formerly closed door of his bedroom.
Wednesday, September 1st
All of these images flashed past as Castiel took one last look around. Twenty five years in this place, and so many memories. He made sure to pack every last one of them tightly in his mind, so that they would never leave him, no matter how far away he went.
“I figured that out,” Dean explained. “So I decided that the day we met would definitely work for your birthday, since, yanno, that was when you started towards being part of our family.” Dean scratched at his neck in his usual nervous habit, blushing ever so slightly.
The kiss was light, fragile, hesitant. Castiel was sure he’d seen in Dean’s expression what he’d thought he'd seen, but his people skills were still pretty rusty so there was always the chance that Dean would refuse the kiss. But that doubt was squashed almost before it could even begin, as Dean started to kiss back like a drowning man. He pulled the angel closer and deepened the kiss. It tasted of candy bars and chocolate and something that was just purely Dean. This, this was definitely Castiel’s new favorite flavor, and nothing would ever beat it.
Mrs. Butters sat at the end of the table, looking smug. “Jack, you can have one end.” She paused for a second, looking between Dean and Cas. “And Dean, you can take the other side.”
“You are way too overdressed right now,” Dean grumbled, pulling away from Cas’ mouth just to voice that complaint.
Saturday, August 28th
“Seriously?” Dean asked, feeling all of thirteen by now. Fighting monsters that shouldn’t exist in the first place was one thing, but how did this become his life? Teasing Cas leading to possibly getting his brains fucked out by the angel? What the hell?
Cas just smiled happily. Thankfully, Dean was the only one laughing about it, and the rest of the day went off without a hitch. Dean bought a few Pride buttons, including a couple for Claire and her new girlfriend, and plenty of ally buttons for Jody and Donna and the rest of them. Dean stupidly went back for another hot dog, and spent the entire parade, what little of it there was, with his head in his boyfriend’s lap, occasionally moaning in gastrointestinal discomfort as Cas combed his fingers through Dean’s hair soothingly. It was definitely a perfect first Pride for everybody. Even if Dean did pay for all that greasy food later that night.
When Cas finally slumped on the couch, boneless and sated beyond imagining, Dean finally pulled off and licked his lips. Staring up towards Cas, seeing him breathing so hard, pupils blown with lust, hair looking even more fucked out than usual from just a simple blow job, Dean felt proud. When the angel raised his head enough to whisper, "I love you, Dean," the equally satisfied hunter horizontally climbed back up Cas' body, where he was met with lazy, grateful kisses.
This time, it was obvious that Dean’s laugh was self-deprecating, especially when paired with the blush that was creeping up his neck. “Nothing that amazing, Cas, just keeping my kids safe and all,” he mumbled in embarrassment.
“Heya, Cas,” Dean managed to say without sounding awkward. How fair was it that Cas had only gotten hotter as he aged? Because seriously, damn.
“Naw,” Dean said, a mild blush seeping up his neck into his cheeks, something that the angel had always thought softened him and made him look more cute than handsome. “I got to pig out too, so it was also pretty selfish on my end.”
Dean's surprise showed not just on his face, but his whole body. He leaned forward, radiating amazement. "Holy crap, that must've been nuts growing up. Wow."
“So,” Castiel said slowly, turning Dean’s hand over to show the patch of skin where the burn had been, “when I heal you, I already know where to send it because I know you so well.”
Sam slid down the wall by the door, not sure if he could even take all this in right now. Because not only had he caught his brother and his angelic boyfriend role-playing sexually, recreating a freaking porn said angel had watched once in their presence, but now he was looking down at Cas, very male angel of the Lord, in what looked almost like the lazy version of a school girl’s outfit, and the angel had even bothered to shave his legs! What the hell…
“My apologies,” Cas said sincerely. “I’m sure the food is spectacular, but I can’t actually taste anything.”
Dean laughed in response, not just a chuckle but a full blown laugh. “Cas,” he breathed out, still giggling as he tried to speak. “I have, like, at least twenty more things for you to try, so don’t go picking favorites just yet.”
“You only brought one shovel,” Cas pointed out, making Dean swear under his breath, though Cas still probably heard every word of it with his angelic hearing.
Cas tilted his head in confusion as Dean said this. “Charlie isn’t my wife,” he explained.
“What in the hell were you thinking, Cas?” Dean yelled, not even bothering to wait until Sam was out of hearing range.
The two new friends bonded over more than just their children and their parental similarities. Dean would get his younger brother Sam, or his best friend Charlie, to babysit all three kids every so often, so that the two could go out and do things like normal adults got to, like see movies, go to the occasional bar (always Dean’s favorite, a place called The Roadhouse that also served incredible burgers), mostly just the kinds of things you can’t really do with a baby, a toddler, and a kindergartner in tow, all of which tended to be quite loud when in public when not currently being placated. With Dean’s car, as opposed to Castiel’s bus pass, they were even able to go places that weren’t within walking distance, which Castiel definitely appreciated, and not just for grocery shopping.
Castiel mumbled something about checking in on Dean, though from the looks of it, both of the hunters were too absorbed in their books to even notice him leaving. He stepped out the front door, and once he spotted the Impala, walked in that direction. The hood was propped up, and Dean was leaning halfway into the motor, doing his Father only knew what to the engine, but everything else seemed to stop existing when he saw the expanse of Dean's back that was uncovered as his t-shirt and flannel shirt rode up from his awkward positioning. The positioning was so awkward, in fact, that part of his jeans had rode downwards, showing off the beginnings of a very well shaped butt cupped by the flimsiest piece of black lace the angel had ever seen. There were tiny threads of red running through the edge, and even a hint of a small red bow slightly covered by the waist of Dean’s jeans.
“Yes?” Dean said, though he wasn’t sure if he was actually ready for this. Pining from afar was one thing, but he’d never felt anything even close to this before, no matter the girl, so this was pretty much all foreign territory for him right now.
Dean nodded confidently. "Definitely, Cas. Let's go."
Dean headed for the driver’s seat instinctively, since he’d always been the one driving. Cas putting his arm up before Dean could reach for Baby’s door handle, on the other hand, was definitely new. “Cas, get out of the way,” Dean said, trying to push the arm out of the way even though he knew he was no match for stubborn angel strength, no matter what body he was in.
“Oh good, you found your present,” Dean said, smiling happily. It wasn’t often that the hunter got to smile so purely, and Castiel hated the fact that he was probably about to ruin it with his confusion.
As the rest of Team Free Will 2.0 watched in silence, Cas took a bite of the mashed potatoes she had ladled gravy all over. At the sound of his groan of pleasure, they couldn’t help their laughter. Cas, on the other hand, was piling even more food onto his plate.
,’” Sam read out, looking as confused as Dean.
“I’m ready,” Dean finally said, moaning as Castiel moved his three fingers around comfortably. “Fuck me, Cas.”
“I should be thanking you for introducing me to so many delicious candies,” Castiel replied.
Castiel nodded along, no longer just trying to be polite. The way Dean told the story, it almost felt like a soap opera drama on television, and Castiel couldn’t turn the channel if he tried.
When the door closed, Castiel was about to move over to give Dean a goodnight kiss or three, but he was suddenly struck in the leg by the body of a hyperactive toddler with messy bed hair. “Daddy!” Claire yelled, with Emma following in her wake a few moments later.
With such beautiful music in his ears, Dean finally made it to the end of the line, his nose now nestled in the hair at the base of Cas' dick. And this, this was when he inhaled all the air from his cheeks, causing a perfect suction that always made Cas gasp.
Jack just tilted his head, a habit he was starting to pick up from Cas. “I’m far stronger than any human could even dream of being, so shouldn’t it be me that needs to take it easy on you?” He asked.
“Great,” Dean said, and meant it. He was apparently still crushing on the guy in front of him, but since he was taken Dean would gladly settle for a friendship. Cas had been that cool, and seemed to still be. He motioned to Cas’ date as she walked over to join them. “As soon as you’re done with all the excitement here, I can get us a table at The Roadhouse, and I can meet you and your wife there.”
Dean practically jumped out of bed at that. "I'll go put the coffee on right now," he said quickly, about to dash out of the room in his eagerness.
“No, but it was,” Castiel corrected him. “That all took strength and bravery.”
Cas’ smile was even sadder this time. “No, when you’re a man, as well. I couldn’t care less what you looked like, Dean, because it'll always still be you.”
Friday, August 27th
“Yes, you dunce,” Crowley said, though you could tell that the insult was meant to be endearing. As much as Castiel really did not like that demon right now, he could at least understand where he was coming from. It had taken him quite a few years to understand exactly what it was he’d felt towards the hunter, and he’d never quite known how to go about flirting in the first place, but even he had been frustrated by Dean’s blindness towards that aspect of their relationship.
Castiel had been right about being able to finish the shoot in only a few minutes, since Dean handled everything like a seasoned pro. The last click of his shutter reminded him that it'd probably be quite some time before he'd be seeing Dean again, and Castiel couldn't help feeling sad. The initial lust had been replaced by a full on crush, and he knew he'd be missing the model for weeks at the very least.
A few minutes later, as Cas was starting to slip into a nice, deep doze, he was startled awake when Dean shot up into a sitting position like there was an emergency. Cas was about to start panicking when Dean shouted, “That’s it!”
The picture Dean had sent showed him and Castiel in the backseat of the Impala, both naked, and obviously sex ruffled. It had cut off right before anything x-rated could be seen, but it was easy to tell from the positioning of Dean’s arm that his hand was on, and most likely squeezing, Castiel’s ass. The smug look on the angel’s face almost seemed to confirm it.
Dean blinked a few times, caught completely speechless in his confusion. “Wait, what?”
“Wasn’t any other empty tables, so I figured you could share ours,” Dean explained when Castiel was close enough to hear him. Emma was eating her hot fudge sundae as if she’d been starving for years while the baby happily gummed one of the soft pretzels Castiel had seen behind the counter.
Sam looked like he was about to respond, but their brotherly… sibling-y… their whatever it was called squabble was interrupted by the sound of the bunker’s rather loud door being unlocked.
Castiel paused for a few seconds, trying to figure out if he’d missed something in this conversation. Dean didn’t even look this broken when Sam offered to sacrifice his life, and his little brother was the thing he loved more than anything else that existed.
They were sticky with sweat and other bodily fluids, but to each other, they couldn't look more beautiful. Cas smiled down at the man underneath him, before giving him a sweet kiss, trying to avoid aggravating his injured lips. When Dean winced a little anyway, Cas kissed him a second time on the cheek instead. "Love you, Dean," he whispered, then smiled even more when he felt Dean's arms circle around him.
He could feel Cas' body shudder in pleasure right as Cas moaned, "Ohh, Dean."
“Shit,” Dean muttered under his breath when he was caught staring by the redhead, who then proceeded to whisper in Cas’ ear, who then proceeded to head in his direction, smile on his face. Dean was twenty eight. He was a grown ass adult. He was smooth, and suave, and not a high school kid anymore. So he should not be panicking about his super big crush coming over to talk to him. Suddenly, at this point he missed passing notes instead of having to face people head on.
“What? You were the one who didn’t want to be here, so you shouldn’t be grumpy that it’s almost over,” Sam complained as he started to take down the booth. “Looks like you did a really good job, though,” he said, packing up the few pieces that were left. He hefted up the mostly empty boxes, heading towards the parking lot. “You get the last few bits, and I’ll meet you at the car, okay?”
Then Dean violently grappled with Cas until he was sitting on top of the angel, two pairs of boxer shorts the only thing separating equally hard dicks. He shot back down to bite at Cas' neck, causing him to writhe in pleasurepain. Dean let out a groan through his teeth before whispering in Cas' ear. "You have shitty taste," he mocked, still not over their previous argument. He shoved his hand under those ugly white boxers again and grabbed Cas' impressive cock, causing the angel to both growl and whimper at the same time. But before he was able to celebrate his triumph, he was roughly jostled into the bottom position again.
“I am right here, you know?” Castiel reminded them both. “And I can hear everything you’re saying, Crowley,” he finished, heavily implying that he knew exactly what the demon wasn’t outright saying, as well.
Dean grinned even bigger. “What, you think kids this good looking could come from anything else?” He teased. He was obviously used to such outbursts like this by now, and was trying to make Castiel feel a little less flustered. The stunned omega was grateful for that, as well.
Castiel reached a hand to his shirt, ripping it away with one small flick of his wrist, and did the same with his pants, the torn pieces of fabric falling around his feet and leaving him in his white boxers. He smirked at the stunned looking hunter. “Is this better?” He asked teasingly.
“Maybe? Probably? I don’t even know at this point, Cas,” Dean admitted. “I probably would’ve been a hell of a lot less hesitant, especially when we got to know each other a little better, but that might’ve been even worse.” When Cas gave him that confused head tilt, Dean tried to simplify it down a little. “We probably would’ve hooked up, had a bunch of crazy sex, but I wouldn’t’ve known you so well, wouldn’t’ve had years and years to learn about you, to fall in… To fall for you, the way you did for me so many times.”
“It kinda worries me that your brother thought that buying your engagement present at what had to have been a sex shop was a good idea,” Charlie said through a mouth of food, before quickly swallowing the chewed pizza in embarrassment.
“Yeah, it has been for about three months now,” Dean agreed, and for one of the only times since this started, both Crowley and Castiel were wearing the same expression of fondness at Dean’s total obliviousness.
Dean tried to hide his face underneath the bill of his hat, and nodded.
Dean shot Castiel a quick glance of apology before looking down at his daughter. “Only five-bajillion? Forever is at least sixty-bajillion,” he teased her.
Castiel chuckled softly, knowing exactly where this was going and wanting to shout his response to the world. Instead, he nodded. "If you're asking me out, Dean, my answer is yes."
“But I really enjoyed the Bitterfinger, Dean,” Castiel insisted.
"Dude, it's okay," Dean said as he stopped walking and turned to face him. "Breathe."
"No," Dean immediately declared. "I may look like a chick, but I'm sure as hell not gonna dress like one." He stood back up to face Sam at about chest level, then yelped when he felt further jiggle. "Fuck."
Cas placed a reverent kiss on the top of Dean’s head. “We have it now, at least. And we have it forever.”
“So Gabe is a bit,” Castiel hesitated, not sure which word would work best in this situation, “a bit spirited.”
“That’s not what I said,” Cas responded, “but it is what I meant.”
“I hate you so much right now,” Dean whispered to his least favorite brother, right before Cas appeared in the doorway.
“Boxer brief,” Dean finished for him, lowering the box to the floor as they wore identical expressions of what the fuck.
“Revenge, Cas, revenge,” Dean informed him. “Remember when I said we couldn’t have sex in the Impala in case he noticed something off?”
Dean laughed as he put a plate in front of the angel. “I was gonna say the food, but yeah, the pie’s the best part of the best part.”
“How the hell do you think that would’ve made
“But you’d be dead,” Dean pointed out slowly. “How could I ever feel okay with you dead?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, propping his head on Castiel’s shoulder. “They just won’t be about our babies growing up. Remember when Claire went through her daredevil phase, and we had to ban her from using the staircase for anything other than going up and down the normal way?” Dean said, chuckling as he pointed to the banner and its multiple dings and gouges, the signs of being replaced obvious on five different spires.
Which left him standing near the bleachers, drink cup in hand and bored expression on his face. He should've at least brought his friend/almost-sister Jo as a not-date to keep him company, but he hadn’t, so now it was just him and his cell phone. Only, before he could pull out his phone to play some Candy Crush, he noticed a new couple walk through the doors. The woman with red hair he didn’t recognize at all, though she was interesting looking enough in her Legend of Zelda t-shirt that he was pretty sure they probably would’ve been friends, at the least. But the dark haired guy she was walking in with, him he definitely recognized.
“I had incentive,” Cas replied with a smirk, and Dean could already feel his pants get tighter. Oh, he was so fucked, bad as well as good. Cas threw in the salt as Dean tossed in the Bic lighter. The flame whooshed up, unnaturally large like it usually was when they were destroying a ghost. Dean’s phone beeped a minute later, a text from Sam telling them they torched the body in time and everybody was safe. Dean sent one back about him heading to a motel real quick first to wash up cuz he was so grimy, his hands only shaking a little from being so nervous. Then he put away his phone and looked over at Cas, who had only put his shirt back on, untucked and partially unbuttoned. “So, uh…?” Dean mumbled.
“You had so many friends, I didn’t think you’d want to be bothered by some random guy,” Cas replied, looking a little sad at the admission.
“I will always be a part of you, as you will always be a part of me,” Castiel finished, softly.
"Dick with wings," Dean threw back, destroying some shoelaces himself before he was also barefoot.
Depression sucks, my apologies. I'm working on catching up with these, so expect new chapters... at some point...
Meg gave him a look that obviously told him she knew he was lying, and that she knew exactly why. "Well, you guys have some fun, but make it quick so nobody gets too antsy, and I'll be back in a few." She winked at Castiel before closing the door, her expression far too smug for the photographer's liking.
Castiel flinched as he automatically caught the heavy lump of a thing that Dean tossed his way without warning. “Aren’t you supposed to shout ‘Catch’ or something before throwing things at people?” he asked, staring at the bag now in his hands. It was one of those colorful bags of candy from the grocery store, covered in child friendly images of ghosts and werewolves and other monsters, that were used to be passed out to trick or treaters at Halloween.
If he had any guts at all, he'd’ve just asked the guy out ages ago. Dean didn't seem to have a homophobic bone in his body, so even if he was super straight he wouldn't have been grossed out by Castiel asking. He'd even been on the cash register the day Castiel had bought those gay pride rainbow pins a few months back. And he'd given him that wink he just loved to give Castiel, like they had an inside joke just because they were constantly bumping into each other here.
This time, it started innocently enough, technically, by the two cuddling up on the couch, watching a movie on Netflix. But it's called Netflix and Chill for a reason, and the movie was soon just background noise to the couple making out on the couch.
Sam, completely ignoring Dean’s frenzied attempts at trying to make him stay quiet, called out to Cas. “We’re down here, Cas.” Dean wanted to punch that smug grin on his brother’s face, but there wasn’t enough time as the angel’s footsteps echoed heavily on the metal staircase.
Castiel always pointed out that it seemed unfair; that he should be giving as much as he was getting. But Dean would always assure him that he liked to give blow jobs. Cas would still try and make up for the unequal distribution of orgasms in the bedroom, though, by doing as many of Dean's favorites as he could when they were having actual sex, and not just oral. Dean never complained about it, because it made Cas feel better, and also, orgasms with a sexy hot angel. Nobody was losing in that deal. But far more often, it was Dean between Cas' legs than the reverse, which was exactly how Dean liked it.
"God, Dean, yes," Cas murmured, already starting to writhe beneath Dean.
“For you, I would’ve used a bookmark,” Dean teased, and was happy when Cas smiled.
Cas just smiled in response to the hand yank back-ness. “No problem, Dean.” Then he went back to his original seat, looking at the different book that Sam had just pulled off one of the large piles surrounding him.
Dean laughed as well. “They should just be thankful we didn't have any bananas in the house that day!”
A week later, the latest pair was beautiful pale purple that was almost white, with little swirls in the design, that it took everything in Castiel to not outwardly react to. The dark green pair, which from the shape of it could only be a thong, had Castiel needing to loosen control of his vessel for a moment, and the peach colored pair, which was only a border for the ivory satin underneath that just barely showed, ended with Castiel dropping the bottle of beer Dean had given him a few minutes ago, causing a distraction that went on long enough for him to readjust himself and will his libido down. It was such a new experience, this sexual desire, that Castiel had actually had to practice to be able to do that.
Dean just laughed. “God no, Cas. There’s no way I’m scratching or sniffing anything Gabe gave us, ever.”
Movies always made high school reunions look way more interesting than this, Dean thought as he scanned the barely decorated gymnasium. It had been ten years since he’d been here, and the school really hadn’t changed a bit. It was both nostalgic and depressing at the same time, because this place had sucked when he went here, and it looked like it still did.
Dean finally bothered to look at the receipt. Only it wasn’t a receipt, just a phone number. Ohhh… “Your number?” He finally said, stating the obvious.
“Cas, personal space,” Dean reminded the angel yet again.
The first glimpse, and it was the briefest of glimpses, of the hidden lace that caught Castiel’s attention and kept it in a vice hold, happened after a rather vigorous hunt in the middle of October. There were always more cases during this month that any other, because the holiday made otherwise normal people bring out the Ouija boards and spell books, and take to forest clearings to perform rituals that they had no actual understanding of, so hunters had to deal with the aftermath of those things as well as the usual threats.
“No way,” Charlie said in disbelief. When both men nodded in confirmation, she started to laugh. “No freaking way!” She said through the chuckles and guffaws.
“Like, a date?” Dean choked out, still impossibly red.
“No, I am not okay, Cas!” Dean shouted, no longer caring how he probably looked right now, like some girl dressed in guy’s clothing throwing a prissy little temper tantrum. “I am the exact opposite of okay right now!” Had he been in more of a thinking kind of way, he’d’ve been glad he didn’t go full hissy fit and stomp his foot.
Castiel was struck silent for a moment. How was Dean this beyond perfect? "Thanks," he managed to say, blushing as hard as the model by now.
At ‘one,’ the two pulled eagerly, but Dean broke off the bigger half in only a second or two. He held up the bone shard triumphantly once he saw that Jack wasn’t upset. “I wasn’t expecting to win, actually.”
Dean blinked a couple times before he realized that he was on the floor of the cabin, with Cas holding onto him tightly. And… “Shit!” He shouted, his voice sounding as normal as it had every other day. “The spell! It stopped!” He crawled out of Cas’ lap and stood up, glad to be over six feet tall for probably the first time in his life. “I’m a guy! I’m me again!” It was only then that he realized what those ripping sounds had been, as he felt the breeze on his naked legs. He looked down at the shreds of jeans and torn chunks of boot at his feet, and the stretched very thin underwear that was barely keeping him from being completely naked from the waist down, as the destroyed bra fell from under his t-shirt when he moved. He groaned in annoyance, then turned to glare at Cas, who had just started giggling.
Castiel couldn't help the laughter that Dean's explanation had elicited. "Honestly, I can completely understand where he's coming from," Castiel agreed. "Nothing can be as annoying as a kid's mother digging them for information. Especially on that dating life part."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hate you!" Dean hissed, trying to move in a way that made Cas' fingers move as well.
But who ever said that Dean Winchester was sensible?
Physical attraction, physical acts of said attraction, had never seemed like they’d mean much to Castiel, but he was struggling to breathe even though he didn’t need to, as he opened his mouth further, exploring Dean’s as his was explored in return. He landed in Dean’s lap, feeling what could only be Dean’s physical attraction to him. There were wants, needs, desires, that Castiel felt, and he wanted to indulge in every single one of them.
Dean blushed, and Castiel couldn't help but grin like an idiot at how adorable it was. "Thanks, I tried to do my best so you wouldn't get yelled at."
Dean pushed back with his hips, really putting his back into it, but he was no match for Cas' strength. So instead, he started to edge them to the left, towards his room with the bed and the big ass bottle of lube. Because while frottage is fun, it's also the most frustrating thing in the world when you just want to be slamming into someone at the most punishing pace that you can manage.
“Holy fuck, yes,” was all Cas managed to get out before Dean once again stayed true to his word.
Steeling himself as if he were about to do something far more difficult than just walking into a store, Castiel took a final sip of his smoothie before dropping the empty cup in the trash can and heading there. The Bath and Body Works he passed made itself known with an almost overbearing cloud of mingled scents and sprays. He paused for a moment, wondering if maybe a spritz or two from a tester cologne might make him seem a little bit more attractive, then pulled himself away when he realized he was only stalling. He already had on the cologne he'd bought from Dean last month, anyway, so it'd been a bad idea from the start.
“Sorry, wasn’t thinking,” Dean admitted sheepishly. “But yeah, that spell Gabe gave you to get your taste buds back, it’s still working, right?” He asked, walking over to where the angel was sitting, carry a grocery bag with other colorful bags of candy inside. A lot more bags, judging by how heavy and bulging the bag looked.
Dean wiped a few tears out of his own eyes. “But for what it’s worth,” he joked, trying to lighten the mood because damn did it need, “until then, I do still love you.”
"But you are so destroyed," Meg added, laughing. Castiel just rolled his eyes.
before I could recreate you,” Castiel said, remembering what it had been like, seeing the very being of the hunter sitting in front of him, no barriers, just soul to grace. He blushed again, but this he knew was from what he’d been thinking about. “So now, when I heal you with my grace, it… knows without your body needing to tell it. It’s already been there, already constructed it atom by atom. I will never forget that, will never forget even a single piece of your body, Dean.” Castiel could feel his blush deepening as he spoke, knowing that it was all coming out sounding wrong, but it was like the words were speaking themselves.
Dean looked at him nervously. “Yes?”
Dean sat up, startled, when he heard someone knocking at his open door. He took his headphones off before glancing up to see who it was. He was startled again when he saw that it was the exact angel he’d been thinking about the last hour or so, while he listened to his music in bed. At least he hadn’t fallen off the bed, he realized, when he saw close he had been to doing it.
Castiel didn’t feel embarrassed at all about how wrong he was as the taste hit his tongue and he moaned even louder in pleasure. “That one’s really great too,” he said, already reaching for another.
Dean paused for a moment, worrying Castiel, until he finally all but shouted “Yes, definitely, of course, totally! I would love to go on a date with you! Just lemme go put on something nicer,” he babbled before rushing out of the room.
“Definitely,” Dean agreed, and Castiel sighed in relief. Dean must’ve been really good with kids, because it was usually next to impossible to stop Claire once she got on the warpath.
“Wait, so Dean wished for Cas to kiss him?” Jack asked, confused, as Sam burst out laughing.
Dean actually did hate Cas a little at the moment, him and his sadistic joy in not exactly edging Dean but coming damn close to it. Easier to just give in. "Just fuck me already!" He shouted, ready to offer his soul up again if it meant Cas would just get on with it. His dick was so hard it was going to explode soon if the angel didn't. When Cas' fingers stayed still, Dean rolled his eyes and let out an unsexy groan. Not this shit again. "Please?" He begged, and the humiliation was gone before it came because there were fingers moving again, and stretching, and "Jesus fucking Christ!" Dean screamed when Cas somehow managed to hit the target with all his fingers.
Dean mentally grumbled his way through four more sales, before the large coffee he’d drank with two donuts in place of a healthy breakfast informed his bladder that a urinal would be required shortly. He glanced around, frowning at how busy the place had been getting while he’d been ignoring it in favor of sketching. It wasn’t some huge city like New York or LA, where his stuff would be stolen if he looked away for more than five seconds, but he really didn’t feel comfortable leaving it completely unguarded for the few minutes a bathroom break would take. He let out a frustrated sigh as he noticed that most of the other booths had at least two people at them. Damn, should’ve thought of that before he told Sammy that he wouldn’t need him again until it was time to take the booth back down again at the end of the show. There was no way he could hold it in for another few hours.
“No, no, not like that,” Dean lectured, moving over to Castiel to show him the correct way of unwrapping a present. “You gotta rip it open, so you can see what it is faster.” To show the angel what he meant, he put his hand next to Castiel’s and tugged at the paper. When Castiel did what Dean was suggesting, Dean smiled, but stayed close. “Yeah, like that.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied, seeing Sam looking but not dropping Cas’ hand. “We can celebrate in a little bit, but right now me and Cas have some stuff to talk about, so we’ll be in my room for a bit.” They didn’t wait for Sam to respond, heading straight for the hallway leading to the bedrooms.
"Stupid hunter," Cas replied automatically, parting with said hunter just long enough to drag the t-shirt over his head. Their mouths clashed again, even more violently than before, as the two groped each other and their way over to the bed.
Thursday, August 26th
The line of conversation was cut short as Sam brought in the turkey, staggering a little at the sheer weight of the bird. There was actual literal “ooh”ing and “ahh”ing in at how it had turned out, and it was with great pride that Dean made the first cuts into the perfectly browned flesh. The perfection was cut short rather quickly, though, when Cas politely declined a serving of turkey, or any food for that matter, that Mrs. Butters offered him.
The guy turned around then, and with a smile plastered on his face, said, “I got the pizza you ordered…” Then Dean stuttered and dropped the empty box when he saw that Sam had answered the door. “What the hell are you doing here?” He yelped, trying to cover up his tight t-shirt and shorts as if he were naked instead.
They leaned against each other, holding themselves up as they laughed until they could barely breathe.
“Velma is my favorite, so far,” Jack said, not taking his eyes away from the screen as he talked, apparently very into the cartoon.
Castiel kissed him, pushing against him for that earlier friction, but Dean pushed him away enough to show him the bottle of clear liquid. “If I open myself up with this,” he promised, “it’ll feel a million times better, Cas,” he finished with a lascivious grin.
“Well, I guess we could figure out a way to swing that,” Dean said, looking like he was thinking really hard. “Gonna need a bunch of wood and some nails to make it bigger first, though.”
“Oh,” Dean replied eloquently. “Umm, thanks I guess?”
“Of course it was him,” Castiel said, sighing and rolling his eyes for at least the millionth time by now about his older, yet definitely not wiser, brother.
“Would it have been better if I’d chosen a female vessel, instead of Jimmy?” Cas asked, and it took Dean a few moments before he could figure out how to say what he felt.
Dean grabbed Cas’ ass, one hand on each cheek, and squeezed while thrusting his hips at the same time. The sound that came out of Cas’ mouth could only be described as a desperate whine.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas said, quickly moving to aggravated as he also moved closer to the eldest Winchester. “Don’t you think I already thought to try that?”
“I gotta pee,” Dean tried to explain. “And you gotta stay next to me and all…” Dean trailed off. He had saved so many lives in his time, yet the universe had decided to pull
“Isn’t that the talking dog we met?” Castiel asked as he walked into the television room, while Dean and Jack were watching old reruns of the original Scooby Doo.
“Thanks,” Dean said, only mildly sarcastic. “But I demand at least two full time bodyguards at the wedding, and a ban on her drinking anything with a higher proof than water.”
Cas’ expression went from dejection to something resembling, not quite hope, but only a step or so away from it. But all he did was nod, to let Dean know he could continue.
“Close enough,” Dean muttered, before grabbing Cas by the neck and pulling him into a deep, devouring kiss. “Any excuse to have some hot sex with my hot fiance.” He winked at that, which only made Cas laugh again, but Dean cut him off before he could say anything by resuming the kiss.
“Oh, you haven’t bought him a collar yet, then?” Crowley asked snidely. “I have a few you could borrow for now, if you’d like. Juliet outgrew her last one a few months ago. It has ‘Baby Girl’ written in rhinestones and everything.”
The man was in his late teens, maybe really early twenties, and looked like he’d been making the ladies swoon from birth. He had a classically beautiful face, almost as if he’d stepped out of a Renaissance painting at the museum and decided to try wearing underwear for a living. His body was sculpted in a way that didn’t look forced, like he hadn’t earned those lithe muscles anywhere as boring as a gym. He was golden all over, with a sprinkling of freckles that should’ve made him more cute than hot, yet they just seemed to turn the temperature up all the more. His light brown hair was spiky, in a way that made Castiel want to run his hands through it to see if it was soft under all that gel, and even from here, those impossibly green eyes sparkled with humor and intelligence.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said.
“I had to know
Cas nuzzled into Dean’s neck, sighing happily. “I love you too, Dean. And I’ll try to not take things as literally next time.”
Sam and Cas were talking about a book they’d both read when he interrupted them. “I want one of those t-shirts,” he said, pointing at the booth selling Pride merchandise.
“That was fast,” Dean mumbled as Cas pulled himself out of the hole he’d dug.
Jack gave him one last confused look, then turned back to the television. “I guess it’s a good thing you destroyed the tv, then.”
Dean moaned as the slightly premature finger stretched him in that way that pulled tightly and burned and turned him into a damn puddle of goo. The syllables that left his mouth didn't form words, but it didn't matter because the sensation of those two fingers moving and flexing made Dean forget English. When the third finger slid in, language stopped existing, as did anything that wasn't currently his prostate being stroked, oh so lightly, but enough to make him whine for more.
“I saw it at the store and figured you’d like it.” Dean pointed at the inside of the wallet as Castiel opened it. “See? It’s got the main part, where your ID goes, but it’s got those little zippered pockets for you to store your other ones. That way, you can have your FBI badge, your Animal Control badge, your police badge, and everything else ready so you don’t have to keep going back to the Impala. Great, right?”
“It’s in the past, Dean, and there’s nothing to be done. But if it helps you feel more secure, have at it.” Sam smiled, and it was obvious that when he said he was over it, he meant it.
“Oh, it was nothing really, just an overreaction,” Crowley admitted, leaning in closer to Dean as he spoke. It was obvious to Castiel that there’d never been anything in the first place, and to Dean as well, but they each had a different idea for why the demon was playing this game.
series,’ three letters.”
“Damn straight I wanna go out on a date with you,” Dean said, a little too loudly. Everyone turned to look at them, causing both men to turn into bright red neon lights of embarrassment. They both giggled and looked away, trying to avoid any further attention. “I’ll call you tonight,” Dean said as soon as it seemed they weren’t the craft fair soap opera anymore.
Dean actually had to stop himself from crying as he tried on all the clothing in his room. The only good part was that he'd lucked out and ended up with a bra, a package of underwear, and a pair of jeans that fit. Scowling in extreme unhappiness as he grabbed a random shirt and his baggiest flannel, he slipped them both on to cover up his traitorous body.
, because they could hear Crowley yelling all the way out here. “I think it might’ve worked,” Dean whispered, acting as if this were all some big conspiracy instead of just a photo sent to get an amorous demon to back off from a taken hunter.
Cas stretched out his fingers a few more times before removing them. Dean muttered swears under his breath as Cas lubed himself up. The hunter was already to his third 'fucking sadist angel' when Cas pushed his whole cock in at once. "Fuuuuuckkkk!!!" Dean all but shrieked. "Fuck yes, Cas!"
“I loved this show growing up, so I figured we could start here,” Dean explained as Castiel sat down on the other half of the couch, Jack happily occupying the arm chair to the side. “Might go for some Looney Toons next. Teach him about Bugs Bunny and all.”
“You will never understand just how much I hate you right now, Sammy,” Dean mumbled, but did as Cas had suggested and moved around to the other side of the bed. As soon as they were just a few feet apart, Cas stopped his weird new literal drifting. "Guess this means Cas gets shotgun on the way back to the bunker." Even though everything about their current predicament was serious, the angel still smirked a tiny bit, since Sam pretty much always got to sit in the front seat when he was there.
“Ahh, hello Winchester,” Crowley greeted Dean happily as they entered the throne room. “Oh, and you brought your pet angel,” he teased, once he saw Castiel enter behind the hunter.
“Okay...” Cas responded, drawing it out and proving that he was starting to pick up on how people actually spoke in this century. He gave Dean another confused stare, this one going on a lot longer than the other, before going back to digging.
“Gabe gave it to us for an engagement present apparently,” Castiel said in an appropriately annoyed tone. Then he turned away from the pineapple boxers to start gathering the necessary dishware for dinner, much of which had been in the same present pile as said boxers.
“Not like anybody could,” Dean replied. “Take me from you, I mean. Cuz I am so definitely yours, Cas.” He leaned into kiss Castiel a little more exuberantly that the angel had, and he gladly let him.
The spell broke when the model chuckled nervously. “Uh, I’m Dean,” he introduced himself, and Castiel had to forcibly shake himself out of his stupor.
“That’s actually a really good likeness of me,” Cas said softly, handing over the sketchpad when they both stood back up.
“I know, Dean,” Cas answered, sounding frustrated. “I do keep moving away, but I keep finding myself right back where I began.”
His old classmates, some he recognized but most he didn’t, milled around the punch bowl having random little conversations, but that was pretty much it. Yeah, he hadn’t been expecting some high school soap opera dramatics or anything, that stuff he knew only happened in movies. But at least there should be music or something, right? Or giving out pointless plastic awards for
“See, even angels get that dad was a homophobic dick,” Sam pointed out.
Sam covered his mouth to hide the worst of his laughter. “Dean being the one to move in closer to you,” he muttered, before returning to his barely concealed laughter.
Dean sighed in absolute contentment as he stretched out on the bed. It was Heaven, true, so it was obviously going to be super comfortable, but this mattress seemed like it went the extra mile and then some. The sheets shifted underneath him as he shimmied around, trying to find the most perfect spot in the sea of perfection. It only took a few seconds, then he let out another sigh. Everything was just so damn… heavenly.
“Try harder?” Dean suggested nonchalantly, shrugging before moving over to finish packing away his own belongings.
“Uhh, thanks,” Dean replied, probably blushing like mad crazy by now.
Cas blushed a tiny bit. “Yes?”
Over the next hour, the two taste tested all the different candies that Dean had bought, the hunter joining in on the eating after Castiel had tried a few more by himself. The angel tended more towards the savory-ish ones, like the Snickers, or the Butterfinger that was still his favorite, but some of the fruity flavored candies were good, too, like those Laffy Taffys that had the horrible jokes on the wrapper that Dean insisted on reading out loud and laughing over. There were a few things Castiel actually hated, like those Skittles that didn’t taste like much of anything, but overall it was a resounding success for Dean.
“Your soul,” Castiel grunted, his body and Dean’s moving in a rhythm that was bringing them both closer to an edge that the angel had more reason than ever to want. “It was… your soul…” He panted as each thrust brought him closer to that soul. He could feel Dean’s soul now, feel his grace reaching out to it as it reached for him. “From that first glance,” Castiel stuttered out, the pleasure starting to short circuit his brain, but he wanted to get this out first. He wanted Dean to know just what he meant. “I fell in love with you, then, your soul and you,” he finally managed, before losing himself to the frantic movements that were filling his every sense now.
“With you,” Castiel started hesitantly. He paused, trying to gather his thoughts together to explain this properly. “When I brought your soul back from hell...”
After that, there was very little talking from the four hunters/angels/nephilim, because pausing to talk would take away precious seconds from eating the best food they had all ever tasted. When all was said and done, and Dean was impressed that Cas had matched him pie slice for pie slice (thankfully there had been more than one pie, since that first one had gone to just the two of them), Sam automatically stood up, reaching out to grab one of the dirty serving trays to take to the kitchen.
Before Dean had a chance to respond, Meg poked her head in through the door. "You guys getting close to done? We got four more to go before we get to go home, and I got a hot date with Netflix and some leftover Chinese waiting for me, so the quicker the better."
“We can do it again anytime you want,” Dean whispered. “The kissing, too,” he added, even though he looked like he hadn’t wanted to.
It took a few moments for what Dean had said to sink into Castiel’s brain. “Wait, you’re an omega too?” Came flying out of his mouth before he had the chance to put it in slightly less awkward wording.
The angel had been right; even though Cas wasn’t taking a single step, or flying, or anything even remotely normal for people like them, he was still sliding slowly closer. “What the fuck?”
“Of course, sweetie,” he gave in. They’d been running errands all day, and the hot July sun had been making things twenty times more miserable for the omega. But there was really no helping it. His mate and Claire’s alpha father, Mick, had died almost a year ago, but Castiel was still struggling. It was hard enough for an omega by themselves to get by most of the time, but adding in a child to care for made it that much more difficult.
"Can I at least come in for a morning kiss first?" Dean asked, still holding up only a corner of the pillow.
"Love you, Cas," Dean managed to fit in between the slow kisses, and Netflix finally came back into play as the two went back to cuddling, though they were only half paying attention at best now.
“I hate it whenever we have to come here anymore,” Castiel grumbled at Dean’s side. The demons posted outside the entrance to Hell parted, just like they always did. They all knew by now that the older Winchester was to be allowed in any time he wanted, unless otherwise specified, and they also knew that the younger one and the angel were to be let in too, if accompanying Dean.
Cas was already stiff when Dean got his boxers pulled down, and it only took two or three strokes to get the angel's cock fully hard. He looked up at Cas, who was already panting even though Dean's mouth wasn't even near his dick yet. Dean loved that he was able to do that, that it took so little to get his boyfriend to such a state. And knowing that before he was done, Cas would be wrecked beyond words. That, that was always the best part of giving a blow job for Dean.
That was why he had hated himself so much when Lucifer had hitched a ride and he hadn’t even noticed. Mind you, his mind was all kinds of foggy from whatever Amara had been doing to him, but it felt like he still had no excuse. He should’ve known. And not just that odd feeling at the back of his mind, either. But when Cas came back, it made it even clearer what he’d always been repressing. He could even pinpoint the exact moment that he realized he’d been in love with the dorky angel for a damn long time: that smile on his face when he walked into the bunker with his mom, that look of the purest joy he had ever seen, just because Dean was alive. That hug, he’d had to be careful with it, because all he could think was “Oh, fuck.”
“But I was willing to kiss you,” Cas said, blushing a little himself, now.
“Then grab the salt and lighter,” Cas said, as casual as can be, before Dean heard the thunk of the shovel hitting the coffin lid.
“Actually, Cas,” Dean started to say, already looking as embarrassed as he had that first day when Castiel had told him how brave he’d been. “I’m hopefully not reading this wrong or anything,” Dean continued, looking like he was having trouble getting the words out.
“It said it was going to make it so you couldn’t deny how close you were, but I wasn’t expecting it to be literal,” Sam mumbled guiltily.
“Got all them muscles really working for you,” Dean flirtingly teased again, going so far as to flutter his lashes even though Cas couldn’t see it.
“First, it’s a Butterfinger, and second, you’re gonna love the rest of this stuff too, I promise,” Dean said, his hands already digging through the colorful wrappers to find the next treat. “Here, this one’s a Snickers,” Dean explained as he handed over the foil wrapped candy.
"Flatterer," Dean accused, but didn't make any motion to leave. They cuddled like that for a few minutes, both in a bubble of perfection, until Dean poked his head up. "I'm starving, wanna go get a burger?"
Dean was tight, but it felt amazing, and when he clenched his muscles and became even tighter, Castiel started babbling in Enochian. The feeling was indescribable using human words, and even his natural language could barely capture the sensations, and it was originally intended to talk about his Father, who was literally God. And once the angel found that certain spot in Dean’s anatomy that made him all but scream in ecstasy, even Enochian wasn’t enough. This was pure bliss, and Castiel could never get enough of it.
“He. Is. Hot,” she explained slowly, as if she had to spell it out for him. “Just your type, too: cute and dumb.” She winked as he let out a frustrated sigh.
“This is my first Thanksgiving, too,” Jack added. “The other years, we just ate at a diner.”
Sam had multiple stacks of books next to him as Dean came in, but Dean only shouted "I hate you," to his brother as he ran past.
“Dean?” Cas called from the top of the stairs. “Sam?”
“What was supposed to happen?” Cas asked when Sam motioned them to follow him. It took them at least twenty times as long as usual, but the three, or two by now, managed to make it to one of the Men of Letters' storage rooms.
"And sorry 'bout getting pissed at you earlier," Dean admitted softly. "They're just movies."
, Cas,” Dean said, having heard the angel’s muttering. “And Crowley’s always being a drama queen, so that’s nothing new.”
“Make sure to watch out for Dean, and get him out of there if you need to,” Sam called to them as they were about to head out the bunker door.
"And I'm gay," Castiel said instead of anything even remotely intelligent.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean responded, even though his attention was now on Cas, who was busy himself with probably his last customer of the day. He’d wanted to say goodbye, but he didn’t want to interrupt the sale. It looked like the lady was a big spender, already holding a couple pieces of knitted baby clothing and multiple pairs of gloves. He concentrated on shoving the last few things that Sam hadn’t grabbed into a box, the relatively full cashbox on top, and had the table, which the rec center had provided, completely empty in only a minute or two. When he turned to walk out, his sketchpad slipped to the floor. It fell with the portrait of Cas showing itself to the world, and Dean sighed in annoyance as he reached down to grab it.
“You know that she’s always had an eye for you, even back when we first started dating,” Castiel reminded him, though even as weak excuses went, this one was obscenely pathetic.
Dean blushed heavily and all but jumped away from Castiel, a few seconds later than politeness probably dictated. Which reminded the angel what Sam had told him a few weeks ago, while Dean was inside the mini-mart getting snacks for the rest of their trip.
“Some are, some aren’t,” Sam said with a shrug. “Like this one.” He pointed to a row of blank letter boxes. “It’s been annoying me, because I really don’t want to cheat by looking it up.”
When Cas and Dean's not-as-secret-as-they-thought relationship finally gets exposed, it's a good thing for the couple, and a very bad thing for Sam and his mental well being.
“Dean,” Dean replied, and they shook hands. Castiel had to force himself to let go of Dean’s hand, because it felt so strong and powerful in his. He was apparently a lot more attracted than he’d thought. Probably not a good idea, since Dean was a complete stranger who obviously had a family of his own.
Dean blushed and curled in on himself a little, as much as the chair would allow. “You can’t mean that, Cas,” he muttered, almost to himself.
“From, Gabe,” they read in unison.
“Okay,” Cas said in a monotone. “Then what are the other options? Somebody most likely would’ve noticed a spell being cast, not that I think there are any spells quite this…” He waved his hands around vaguely.
“Hard pass,” Dean said, before abruptly turning around and stalking out, grabbing Castiel by the arm on his way. “We know the way out,” he called back, before Crowley could respond.
“Fucking hell, Cas, that was…” But whatever Dean had been about to say was cut off by Castiel kissing him. But these weren’t the desperate, fiery kisses from earlier. They were more languid, slower, gentler. Dean kissed back just as sweetly, and Castiel was certain that this was almost as good as the sex and the incredible orgasm had been. Almost.
“They were from things done to you, not part of your soul, so I decided they weren’t necessary,” Castiel pointed out.
"I'd call you evil if I didn't love you so much," Dean said as he all but sat in Castiel's lap.
Sam let out an amused snort at his brother’s never ending pie addiction. “I’m not reading it, I’m doing the crossword puzzle.” He held up his pen to illustrate.
“God, Cas,” Dean mumbled, pulling away from the angel’s lips to get a better grip on the shirt that was tucked into black slacks. “So fucking hot, but damn it, do you have to wear so much damn clothing?” He grumbled, only just now managing to pull the shirt out.
Dean gasped, rather overly dramatic even coming from him. Then the shock was replaced with seething fury. "You know what, Cas?" Dean said, his voice sounding like a slow and painful death for whoever the words were directed at. "Fuck you." Then he instinctively grabbed the angel's backwards tie and pulled him in as close as he could. You could hear their mouths hitting each other, their lips and teeth leading to what could only be a bloody mess once they separated.
“Well, you were flirting with me rather heavily, and since I returned the attraction, I flirted in return, though I may not be very good at it since you never noticed it.”
The only sounds for the next few minutes were flesh meeting flesh, the groans and panting breaths of the two, and the rhythmic slamming sound of the headboard hitting the wall, with the occasional crack of wood breaking underneath. Cas' back was lightly bleeding, and Dean's neck was more bruise than not, by the time the beat of the headboard started to falter. Cas' thrusts were starting to waver and go erratic as he finally let go of Dean's dick. At the friction between the two muscular chests, Dean went from panting breaths to gasping.
“I heard enough,” Sam said as he pulled out the chair next to his brother. “Whenever I hung out with a male friend too often, he’d ask me all kinds of weird questions which was his way of finding out if I were gay, apparently.”
“Yes,” Castiel agreed, but didn’t make a move to change what they were doing.
The angel felt his pants get tight, knowing full well what that meant even without having Dean explain it, since he wasn’t completely naive of how the human body worked. Castiel also retained enough of Jimmy’s general knowledge, even if his vessel’s former occupant was now in Heaven, to know exactly what he was feeling at the thought of seeing Dean in a pair of the lacy underwear that was currently on the computer’s screen: arousal. He’d never felt it before, not physically, but he was willing to admit, at least to himself, that he’d felt something towards Dean. Something more than friendship, more than familial love. There was an attraction, but not just to his body. He felt attraction to his soul, had felt it to a certain degree since the moment he first laid metaphorical eyes on it. He had only more recently learned to appreciate the outer packaging, but this bit of pink lace was enough to make all of the types of attraction he felt towards the hunter both obvious and unable to ignore.
Cas ducked his head, possibly in embarrassment, which made Dean feel at least a little bit better about his current insane reactions. “I’d always wished we could’ve been friends, back in school,” Cas admitted. “You seemed so interesting, like we could’ve gotten along great, but you were kind of intimidating, too.”
It was the black lace pair that had broken the angel’s resolve. The brothers were at Bobby’s, as both a slight rest and to do a bit of research before they went bounding after their next target. Sam had happily sat on the couch in Bobby’s cozy living room with a book, and Bobby had sat at the desk doing the same while taking notes. Dean, on the other hand, had avoided the lure of knowledge by saying he needed to tune up the Impala, and had rushed out the front door before anybody could say a word to stop him. Castiel picked up a book as well, one written in ancient Sanskrit that was dusty enough that it probably wasn’t used often, and after wiping off the worst of it, he started reading, still standing. But it only took about ten minutes before he became too restless to concentrate, as well.
Dean’s face burned bright red. “Shit, I wasn't expecting that to… I’m sorry Cas, I didn’t mean to… I mean, I wouldn’t want…” He sputtered uselessly.
"Would you forgive me if I made you coffee and a bagel?"
“I’m all filled back up again, though, so don’t worry too much,” Dean said with a laugh, pulling the neck of his t-shirt aside to show off the upper beginnings of his scar collection.
"No way, your ass is mine to destroy tonight," Dean growled, trying to grab the bottle from Cas. He couldn't reach it, so he struggled himself into a sitting position on the angel's thighs. "Gimme," he said, motioning for the bottle.
The next bit of lace showed its ruffly edges a few days later. Dean was reaching into the Impala for a bag of weaponry, and Castiel saw the lace, a slightly different pattern this time, and in a lovely shade of light blue. The angel actually had to muffle the gasp he felt at the image, wondering which cut Dean had gone with today. It had turned out that, unlike men’s underwear, there were many different styles of women’s underwear, and Castiel had learned all about them as he’d researched on the different computers he’d had access to since that night in the motel room. Unfortunately, that thought was enough to start to make his pants rather uncomfortable, so the angel had made an awkward yet quick exit. He would definitely need to learn to control his response to Dean’s choices in underwear, if he were to keep this fascination a secret.
Oh, flattery will get you everywhere.
Moving his hand slowly, as if approaching a holy relic, Castiel leaned in to touch Dean. Having never experienced the feeling of anything but his own penis, feeling Dean’s was odd, but only for a moment. It was hard, and heavy, and felt as appealing as the lace that had been trapping it. Dean leaned his head back and groaned. “You’re killing me, Cas,” he mumbled. As the angel paused, worried that Dean might actually be in pain, the hunter laughed. “That’s a good thing,” he teased. “Now… keep doing… something,” he added, sounding as unsure as Castiel suddenly was of where this was going next.
“You’re only saying that because all the nuisances were on your side,” Dean teased, even though he was basically right.
“I was jealous, anyway,” Castiel explained, remembering how odd it was to be jealous of an animated woman.
“And?” Cas asked, making Dean sigh because he now knew he’d have to explain this.
“Too bad you don’t sweat,” Dean added, laying it on thick. “It’d make you look even better.” When Cas looked up at him finally, he winked.
While Dean had been trying to not have a panic attack or ten, Sam and Cas had been discussing the situation, and what he’d found so far from his research. “I’ve found a ton of instances of people changing gender from spells and curses,” Sam said, after he’d caught the angel up on the situation. “But they were all really obvious when they were cast. Lots of chanting, or a bunch of ingredients, usually something showy like that, or at least some kind of amulet or obvious curse item. But having something like this happen out of the blue, with zero fanfare, after killing off an insignificant demon, it just doesn’t make sense.”
“It was almost two heart attacks each time, though.” Dean grinned, because at the time he really had felt like his heart was going to stop as they had to rush their blonde seven year old to the hospital both times, fearing the worst.
“Oh yeah, I did say I wanted to buy it, didn’t I?” Dean laughed nervously. Consumerism should cover up the awkwardness quite nicely. “How much do I owe you?” Cas told him the price, and Dean handed him a couple bills from his earnings today. Thank you, capitalism.
Dean’s eyes immediately went wider than he’d’ve even thought possible. “You didn’t,” he hissed at Sam. The noise of the door opening had Dean jumping out of the chair. “No way, Sammy, no way,” he growled, turning around to make a break for it.
Castiel took his time answering, laughing on the inside because he knew just how impatient Dean could be, especially on Saturday mornings. "Maybe," he finally muttered.
Long stripes with his tongue, the very slightest graze of teeth every so often, just like he knew the angel loved. The soundtrack of Cas suffering from the pleasure and the frustration got Dean off more than anything. As he sped up on Cas' cock, going for less tricks now but more pressure and sweet spots hit, the soundtrack sped up as well.
It took him a little while to fall for the angel that fell for him, literally. Jimmy may have looked pretty damn good, but Dean’s heart didn’t do that thump-a-thump when he met the guy, even though it was the same body, just a different occupant. He never once got caught in Jimmy’s eyes, and once he knew what he couldn’t deny anymore, he knew it was because Cas wasn’t in there. That was all that mattered. Though he had to admit, Jimmy did have a nice ass.
“So this was all because you were upset that I was dating Cas?” Dean asked, still a step or two behind everybody else. The angel was pretty sure that even the guard demons had figured it out by now, and they never really got past the doorway whenever Dean was here.
It was definitely lust at first sight for the photographer, but those eyes made him curious enough about the man to want to know more. Castiel was frozen, could barely even breathe, because Meg had severely underestimated his reaction. He could feel his face blush, and was suddenly thankful that his side of the camera was usually difficult to see through because of all the set lights.
Sam rolled his eyes and sighed. “Fine, whatever you say.”
"The feeling is mutual, Dean," Cas replied, struggling to get out of his dress shoes and regretting his, and Jimmy's, choice of clothing the entire time. Then a shoelace snapped, and Cas gracefully, in comparison to the shoes, slipped out of his socks, knowing that sex with socks on was one of Dean's biggest turn offs.
"Bitch," he grumbled under his breath, holding onto his pants as the discarded electrical wire he'd used as a makeshift belt started to slip. Sam just smiled as Dean headed to his room in hopes of finding something a little less likely to fall down at any second. He was pretty sure that most stores frowned on that, female or otherwise. Especially since his boxers would most likely join his pants on the floor at the same time.
"Not from what I saw!" Cas shouted into Dean's face. They were both so enraged that they didn't notice their surroundings anymore, including the two people sitting at the command table, watching the whole fight in shock.
"Dude, you could totally do some of that stuff, so screw your implausible!"
Then the lights finally went on, and Dean realized exactly what Crowley had been doing, possibly even what he’d been doing all along. A woman could barely glance at Dean and he could immediately tell if she was interested in him. But when it came to men, Dean was even more clueless than Castiel, and considering Dean had a thirty or so year head start on him for learning how humans worked, that was really saying something.
“You missed a bunch of scars,” Dean pointed out, still in a lightly teasing tone.
By this time, Dean was an impossible shade of red, and slowly sinking in his chair as if to hide under the table. “This was why I didn’t wanna tell him,” he muttered sulkily.
Dean pouted for a few more seconds before finally giving in. "You bought those bagels specifically for situations like this," he said in his pouty voice, which only made Castiel smile.
“Hey, a little help here?” Dean called after his brother. He and Cas managed to walk closer, but just barely. It wasn’t a three legged race yet, but it was definitely close.
"Love you too, Cas," Dean responded, the final push of the evening putting them both on their sides, facing each other. "Sorry 'bout your back," he added, without thinking.
“Whichever you’d prefer,” Cas answered, pulling Dean out of the thought rabbit hole he’d been getting lost in.
Trying to be even half as brave as Dean, just like he’d said, Castiel reached across the table and held Dean’s head up by the chin. “Yes, it was.” Dean blushed a little more, then finally conceded to Castiel.
Emma pouted for a few moments, before sulkily admitting, “Fine, most of a forever.” Dean and Castiel couldn’t help chuckling at that.
“And your cousin Balthazar?” Dean asked, already knowing the answer.
Castiel tore the rest of the pretty paper off the box, then opened it to see what was inside that had Dean so impatient. It looked like it was something leather, and as he pulled it out he realized it was a new wallet.
Peeing with Cas less than two feet away was probably the most uncomfortable he’d been around another person in his entire life. The angel faced away the entire time, and was even considerate enough to whistle loudly to cover up the sound. Dean was blushing so hard as he washed his hands that he could feel the heat coming off of his skin.
Cas moved a bit awkwardly in his seat, still not used to the elaborate celebrations the wood nymph had been holding in the bunker for the family since being released. “Uh, yes,” he answered, sounding as awkward as he felt. “Angels don’t normally celebrate, well, any human holidays really, but especially not regional ones like this.”
Crowley chuckled. “Of course I have nothing against the angel,” he said, sounding like he was winding up for one of the biggest bluffs of his demonic life. “I just miss hanging out with my friend,” he said, trying to look accidentally vulnerable, a look that he was not very good at faking apparently.
Cas stared after Sam, tilting his head. “At least we don’t have to hide our affections any more,” the angel pointed out.
“Crowley said it was an emergency, but he wouldn’t tell me about it over the phone,” Dean explained, for what was probably the fifth time by now, “so there really wasn’t much of a choice.”
"You know you destroy me every time you do that," Dean said, panting and much harder than before.
“No,” Dean pouted, but it only made Sam laugh even harder.
Castiel called the next day, and the two set up a play date at the park over the weekend. Emma seemed to absolutely adore Claire, and Claire thought that Ben was the neatest thing on the planet; until Dean had to change his diaper, at least. She got over her disgust after a few minutes, though, and went right back to fawning over him like he was a puppy or a kitten or some other kind of cute, cuddly animal.
That dark blue sweater definitely needed to be going home with him, Dean decided once saw it up close, and a heartbeat later he kinda wanted to bring its creator along with it. Blue was all that he saw when the guy first looked up. Since when did they make blue that… blue? After that, messy dark hair, a five o’clock shadow, and a pretty nice looking body from what showed under the guy’s shirt, all turned into a (very hot) person. “Can I help you? Anything in particular catch your eye?” The guy asked in a gravelly voice, and Dean was smitten.
“Stupid oven mitt had a hole in it,” Dean complained as the grace did its healing work. He nudged one boot at the floor pie sadly. “That was gonna taste so good,” he said wistfully.
"If you insist," Castiel said with a fake-frustrated sigh.
“Baby steps,” his brother teased, and Dean socked him on the shoulder for it. Didn’t stop Sam from laughing, though.
“Dean, what are you doing?” Cas asked, tilting his head the way he always did.
Castiel smiled, even though he knew Dean couldn’t see it. “You’re right about at least ninety percent of the people coming through here,” he reassured the nervous model. “But I won’t tell if you won’t.”
"Dean?" Sam asked, completely confused at this point.
Dean let out one more bliss-filled sigh. “And it still probably won’t be enough,” he quipped, trying, and failing, to not sound like the kind of character that Ryan Gosling would play in the movie.
“I was really shy back then,” Cas explained. “And the only time you were alone was in the library, and I didn’t want to interrupt your reading.”
Castiel gripped Dean’s t-shirt, about to do the same thing to his clothing, but Dean clamped his hand onto the angel’s, urgently. “As ungodly sexy as that display was, Cas, this is my favorite t-shirt. Mind if I do it the old fashioned way?” Even if the angel hadn’t been about to agree anyway, Dean’s wink at the end would have assured his agreement. “Gonna strip for you, Cas,” Dean said softly, seductively, as if he didn’t already own every part of Castiel’s heart and body.
Dean knew Cas would never understand, but there was something about the sounds he made when Dean was blowing him. He'd probably deny it if asked, but Dean had a praise kink a mile long, and those sounds, those noises, the garbled words, they were the absolute best praise of all.
“They’re not even close to washboard,” Cas replied, blushing just enough to be cute.
“Yeah, we should definitely catch up for lost time. Wanna hit up some food after this? Cuz trust me, those appetizers are not at all appetizing,” Dean joked, even though he was speaking the truth. He’d tried one of the little paste on a cracker things, and had to wash the taste out of his mouth after with three cups of weak punch.
“I think,” Castiel murmured in an even lower tone, voice going much deeper than usual. “It was the bow.” He put his hand onto Dean’s chest, not too far from where the hunter still wore his hand print.
Dean rolled his eyes. "He's her only chance for grandkids, so that makes her even worse sometimes." Just in case it wasn't obvious, Dean added, "Yanno, because I'm gay." He paused, as if he were still slightly worried about homophobic backlash from his confession even after being in the modeling world for more than ten minutes.
“The pie?” Cas asked, sounding very sure of his answer.
The line moved up, and Castiel placed their order. Just in case Claire decided to get fussy, he ordered an easily handled shake for himself, and got the smallest chocolate cone they had for her. After he paid, he stepped to the side where all the other customers were waiting for their orders to be ready.
“Fucking, fuck…” Dean was holding his hand, a spilled baking pan and a ruined pie scattered on the floor next to him. “Fuck, that stung.”
"Oh, I did that ages ago," Cas teased, and fully laughed when he felt Dean's hand slap his ass, hard.
“To endings and new beginnings,” Dean said, as if he were toasting the house.
Once again Dean was startled, only by a hand this time. Cas’ hand. The same Cas whose lovingly drawn portrait was staring up at them. “Umm…” Dean had absolutely no clue what you were supposed to do in a situation like this, though his instincts told him to grab the pad and run for it.
“You’re asking me out on a date, then?” Castiel asked, his confusion finally starting to clear up.
"Yeah Cas, I like you," Dean rushed out, finally looking back up, the last three words said as they were eye to eye.
“I would’ve loved to have been your friend, man,” Dean responded immediately, finally all caught up and actually a little amazed. “You totally should’ve said something.”
Dean’s smile faltered, and it made Castiel feel somewhat guilty for not understanding what he was getting at. “I just thought you could try a bunch of different ones out and figure out which ones were your favorite,” he mumbled, making Castiel’s guilt kick him right in the gut.
Sam reappeared, looking sheepish and carrying one of their easier spell books. “I’m really sorry,” he said glumly as he reached the CasDean bundle. “I didn’t know it’d do this.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, but he at least gave her a small smile. He was about to recall all the filthy things they’d done in bed in the few weeks they’d been seeing each other, since the guy had only been insufficient in the intellectual areas, but he was at work, and he was supposed to at least pretend he was a professional. “You said the model was ready?” He asked Meg, giving her a glare to remind her to go back to pretending, as well.
“Yeah,” Dean said, and they were off on their colorful shopping adventure. A few minutes later had Dean wearing a shirt with a bi flag on it, and Sam wearing a shirt that had 'Proud Ally' on it. And Cas…
Dean pulled back the curtain of hair, looking like he was thinking really hard, which looked less serious and more adorable on the cute little female face he was currently wearing. "I don't remember anything that looked witchy, and unless the dumpster was cursed, I doubt it was that."
“You’re just impatient,” Cas replied, rubbing against Dean just a little bit harder because he knew it would drive his fiance even wilder.
"It turned me into a chick!" The woman yelled, before Sam had a chance to speak. "A freaking chick, Sammy! I have boobs and I'm short and this stupid hair keeps getting in my face and my hands are small and my clothes don't fit and I'm missing my damn dick!" Almost as if to prove her point, she angrily pushed the long hair out of her face and mouth.
"Oh, from what you saw, huh?" Dean hissed, his face close enough now that he could see Cas almost flinch from it. "What you saw?"
Sam opened his mouth to insult him back, just like he always did, then shut it without a sound when he realized that might not be the best of ideas while Dean was in his current agitated state. Instead, he focused on the problem at hand. "Did you see if the demon did anything that could've triggered a spell before you stabbed her? Maybe something that you touched that might've had a curse on it?"
Dean wanted to start small, wanting the pleasure Cas felt to build slowly, getting him hotter and hotter until he exploded, and not just physically. So he ever so slightly licked the drips of precum that had already gathered in anticipation. Cas' dick always seemed to know when it was going to be properly blown, acting like one of Pavlov's dogs, like it had somehow been trained. Dean smiled at the weird thought, knowing he'd never tell Cas about how obedient his dick was. As a treat for that obedience, though, Dean licked a slow stripe from the head downwards, until he hit pubes, then reversed and came the same way back up again.
“Ice cream, Daddy,” Claire interrupted the two fathers. “Ice cream now,” she insisted.
Castiel couldn't help but laugh right along with him. This was the closest he'd ever been to Dean, and he wanted it to last as long as possible. Or at least until he did something more embarrassing. Whichever came first.
“You know damn well those washboard abs of yours turn me on every time,” Dean answered, walking over to run his hands along them for a visual aid.
“He’s not my pet, Crowley,” Dean replied, acting like it was just a general insult to the angel instead of one directed to the fact that Castiel was dating Dean.
Dean ran his hand through his hair as he rolled his eyes. “Eh, just start pulling on three,” he said instead of arguing over Jack’s correct logic.
“Girlfriend?” Dean asked, slightly confused himself now.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean let out in a whimper as Castiel started to move in Dean’s lap, causing the most agonizingly beautiful friction. “Want you so fucking hard right now,” he moaned.
“Not your fault, so no need to worry,” Dean told him. But when Cas actually bumped into him, Dean turned to explain that he seriously didn’t blame him for any of this, but the shocked look on the angel’s face showed that guilt wasn’t behind this.
“Yes?” Cas replied, sounding confused at Dean’s confusion. “You weren’t exactly being subtle.”
Castiel sighed, trying to hide just how tempted he’d been at that suggestion. “It was all our family and friends, Dean, not just the ones we like.”
"Yeah, I think you might even be able to walk again someday," Dean teased.
“Only next time, we need to make sure Sam is definitely gone first,” Cas pointed out, always the voice of reason.
“Dean,” Cas said sharply, not wanting to get into this conversation again.
even want to date him? Even Anna was just a one-night stand kind of deal, and with Cas, he knew a quick lay in the Impala would never be enough. Also, he wasn’t constantly running into and hanging out with Anna, so he didn’t have to deal with any uncomfortable aftereffects.
It all started with Eileen’s birthday party three months ago. Dean knew how much she adored his paintings, so he’d decided to make one for her as a present. Her and Sam already had a couple canvases of his hanging in their house, though, so he figured he’d try something different this time. He’d gotten one of those wooden plank things, the ones that are supposed to look like old wood found in the forest and not at Michael’s in the craft section, and he’d painted a happy little woodland scene, complete with a moose in the background (might as well include Sammy in the picture somewhere, right?). She’d loved it, of course, and he’d thought that had been the  end of it. But then all her friends oohed and ahhed over it, begging her to tell them where she got it so that they could buy a bunch of them, as well. That was when the idea for him getting a booth at the craft show that was held the second weekend of every other month at the rec center downtown popped into her head. He'd tried to resist, but they’d even got their oldest daughter into it, with her puppy dog eyes that were already on par with her father’s, even though she was only four and a half.
“Really?” Dean couldn’t help but ask.
"I'll start reading while you hit up the women's section," Sam teased, making Dean growl.
“Maybe next time, I can fuck you senseless,” Dean teased, though it was obvious that he’d meant it. Castiel would have him any way he could get him, but having Dean inside him next time? It was definitely something the angel would want to try. He wanted to try everything with Dean, in fact. Even the video of the woman putting the man into her mouth, that had been called a blow job. He would happily do that, and anything else Dean wanted. Because it was Dean.
“Next model’s ready,” Meg called into the studio as Castiel set up the specialized equipment he’d be using for this particular shoot.
“No worries, they told them to me, too.” Dean smiled reassuringly at him, and it made Castiel’s heart thump uncomfortably in his chest. As if it wasn’t unfair enough that this Adonis existed at all, but now he had to be nice, too. Models were always so conceited and greedy that finding one that was pleasant was like finding a damn unicorn, so added to Dean’s looks…
Cas continued to look confused for a few more moments, before his eyes widened, proving that he had just realized why Dean was so unhappy about their trip to the restroom. “Oh… I’ll just have to look away,” he suggested, which made Dean blush harder and caused Sam to snort again.
Sam poked his head into the hallway at the noise. Instead of coming over to help, though, he looked like he yelped before rushing back into the library.
Monday, August 30th
Dean finally looked up from his hands, which he’d been staring at for the vast majority of the conversation, and stared Cas right in the eyes. “I love you too, Cas, but I’m afraid I don’t know how to deal with it,” he admitted, hesitantly smiling when he finished speaking.
“I feel as if I should warn you away from sending that photo,” Castiel said after Dean had shown the one he’d just now taken. “But if it stops Crowley from doing this any more, I think I’m perfectly fine with it.”
“You’re jealous, aren’t you?” Dean accused Crowley, causing the demon to smirk.
“Dean?” Castiel automatically reached for the burn already flaming on Dean’s skin, grace at the ready. “What happened?”
So here he was, at a table in the gymnasium, right under one of the basketball hoops, trying to make his kitschy wood look extra buyable.
“I know you’re maybe not comfortable talking about these kinds of things, but your brother is right. We’ve been flirting with each other so much, that to him it must be very annoying.” Cas paused to give Dean that special smile again, and the hunter’s heart may have skipped a beat or two, he wasn’t sure. “If it’s not too forward of me, I would like to ask you out so that we no longer have to skate around the issue.”
The angel, all but praying to his Father that he was guessing right, that what Dean was feeling, what Castiel himself was feeling…
"On other people!" Dean shouted. He stood up so he'd have a better vantage point in the argument, now that he was even shorter than the Sasquatch he called his little brother, then blushed and crossed his arms across his chest when he realized he was… jiggling…
Mrs. Butters let out a sigh, and seemed more pouting than insulted. “You poor angels, not even getting to enjoy a little green bean casserole for the holidays.” She let out a huff, before placing a consoling hand on Cas’ shoulder. There was a quick flash of unexpected light, then as everybody else was blinking away the afterimages, she picked Cas’ plate back up and started to heap on the different foods. “There, that fixes that. It’s only temporary, but at least you won’t feel left out now.”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas answered, his smile showing a hint of amusement now.
"Shut up," Castiel said, trying to suppress his blush.
“Oh god,” Castiel moaned in pleasure. Hopefully, Sam knew enough to put on his noise cabling headphones, because Dean did that again, and Castiel couldn’t stop the blissful noises coming from his mouth if he tried. Which he didn’t.
“Don’t pull too hard, it’s a pretty weak bone,” Sam told Jack as Mrs. Butters started the countdown.
Blushing more than he had the entire time combined, Dean shuffled his feet. "I was just thinking, well, that I loved talking to you and all, and they, umm, there was never anything mentioned about dating being not allowed and all, and, well, I was thinking, maybe," Dean stuttered.
“That’s nice of him.” Castiel smiled to himself this time. He wished any of his siblings were that nice. Or nice at all. He rolled his eyes at the thought.
“Wait, you were flirting with me?” Dean asked, stunned at this news.
“At least it wasn’t a dildo?” Charlie pointed out, and they all got a small chuckle out of it. “Actually, maybe that’s how we should get revenge,” she suggested. “Send him some freaky-ass, scary-looking dildo in the mail.”
“I’ve already checked that one,” Dean said as he walked into the bunker’s map room. He pointed at the newspaper Sam was staring intently at. “Nothing freaky deaky-er than a really big pumpkin some old guy grew in his garden that won a prize.” Dean took a thoughtful sip of his steaming mug of coffee. “I wonder if that’d make the pies taste different, it being so weirdly big?”
"Putting Nair in your shampoo," Dean threatened playfully, or at least mostly playful. Dean had no idea what was going on, and he was getting frustrated, and Cas was probably just as frustrated if not more, and there was no telling how long they'd be actually stuck together, so his brother's teasing was not on his list of things he felt like dealing with right now. Some of that must've shown on his face, though, because Sam was quiet until they were in the Impala, on the way back to Lebanon. Then he had no choice in talking points, since Dean turned the stereo up as far as he could without actually bursting their eardrums.
“‘Grocery list item from the superfamily
"My being an angel has nothing to do with all the inaccuracies in those movies," Cas shouted back, as the two shoved at each other all the way down the stairway. "Those movies are far too implausible to be enjoyable!"
“You guys were gone for forever!” Emma yelled as well, the two obviously having gotten just enough sleep to get their second winds. “I know, because I counted,” she explained, still loud but no longer yelling. “Uncle Sam had to help me after twelve, though, since that’s how far I can count without mistakes. It ended up being five-bajillion.”
Castiel let out a soft laugh. “Of course, Dean. I expect nothing from you but the most gentlemanly of behavior.”
“No problem, Cas,” he replied, grinning and making Castiel wish he were just a little bit bolder. He didn’t see a ring, so maybe his chances weren’t completely hopeless?
"Hey, Cas, it's cool, just breathe," Dean interrupted him.
“What’s wrong?” Castiel asked immediately, concern overshadowing his earlier sugar high.
“Took you two long enough,” Castiel heard Sam mutter not completely under his breath as he left, making it very obvious that he didn’t mean how late they’d got back tonight.
Mrs. Butters clapped her hands together as Cas pulled away, everybody staring first at him, then at her. “Faerie wishes always come true,” she explained as if it were obvious. “Little ones like that, at least.”
“They do grow up way too fast,” the guy said in agreement.
Dean was back in his artist zone, having reached a spot in the drawing that didn’t need constant observation of the attractive subject, when he was startled by a cough. Remembering where he was and why he was there, he looked up to greet the potential customer. Instead of starting his sales pitch, worthy of a fast food employee from saying the same things over and over, he almost dropped his sketchpad when it turned out to be Cas instead. He slammed the pad shut at the speed of sound, covering up the sonic boom of embarrassment with a little chuckle. Thankfully, he’d been holding it upright, so Cas most likely hadn’t seen what, or better who, he’d been drawing.
“Fingers crossed,” Castiel whispered back, holding up his own to showcase the literalness.
“We could finish this episode later if you’d like, Dean,” Jack said, getting up out of the chair even before he got a response. Castiel was proud of how astute the child was getting. Then again, Dean could be rather obvious at times. Like now, Castiel thought as he felt the hunter’s arm making its way down Castiel’s back to squeeze his butt.
or whatever? This was just flat out boring.
“Make sure to leave a hand print in the fogged up window,” Dean pointed out. “He loved that stupid movie, and maybe this’ll ruin it for him.”
“Yes, I have been flirting mercilessly with you for years, Dean,” Crowley spelled out slowly. “And yet you had the bad taste to pick Feathers over here, who couldn’t flirt his way out of a bloody paper bag,” he said, an aggravated hiss to his tone. “We could’ve been so much more,” he finished, sounding far more smug than anybody should after a declaration like that.
"Can't wait," Dean told him.
“Even if that dick bag hadn’t been lying the whole time, you were still risking your life,” Dean pointed out, his hands angrily waving in the air doing at least half of his talking by now. “Even if you are apparently a true Winchester now with the dying and coming back deal, if we hadn’t got here when we did, you might’ve bit the permanent big one. I’m not willing to lose you like that.” Dean finally calmed down for that final sentence, giving Castiel a painful pang in his heart at how vulnerable Dean sounded in that moment.
Castiel wandered over to said pile and said fiance, and looked closely at the box. Then he started reading the label out loud. “Scratch and sniff…” He trailed off, squinting at the print to make sure he was actually seeing the words he thought he saw.
“Trying to figure out a proper revenge tactic,” Dean explained.
"So, I was going after that demon, right?" Dean explained. Sam nodded and his brother went on. "She was a total bitch, and a bitch to kill, too. I ganked her in an alley behind that Chinese place I love, but she must've been a witch or had a spell ready or something, because I got all tingly as she fizzled out, and not in the good way. I looked down and saw these damn boobs, and I got my ass here as fast as Baby would go."
The words smacked Dean in the face. “Wait, this is your fault?” He growled. Nair in the shampoo was tame compared to what he needed to do in revenge now.
“Are you really sure that’s the one you wanted?” Sam asked, slightly shocked by the angel’s choice.
"Pretty close, though, Sampunzel," Dean insulted Sam, feeling angry at this whole situation, and the world in general right about now.
And now it was Castiel's turn to blush again. "Then why'd you never say anything?" He asked softly.
“Yes, Dean,” Castiel murmured, coming even closer now. “The green pair, and the pink ones, and those beautiful ivory ones with the peach trim,” he listed. “But this pair is definitely my favorite so far.”
“That’s not what I mean, Cas.” Dean sighed. “I… I don’t really know what I mean, actually.” He felt a tear slide down his cheek, and while later he would blame it on the unwanted estrogen running havoc through his system, deep down he knew it was his alone.
Castiel made sure to run his hands along every piece of skin Dean revealed, and only stood back when the hunter slid down his pants. The panties were cut skimpily, with more red threading, and a second red bow in the front. Dean’s erection was straining against the fabric so hard it looked like it would break any moment. And then, as if the universe knew exactly what Castiel was thinking, the last slip of lace that had been holding it in moved, and Dean’s erection bounced out from its prison, pre-cum already beading on its head. The wet spot that had been spreading on Castiel’s boxer short from his own needy head, gained momentum as just seeing that trapped penis had increased Castiel’s desire tenfold, at least.
“He definitely got down the most important part,” Dean added, setting out the plates Mrs. Butters had unapologetically handed him to set the table with.
"It was mostly my fault, so don't worry," Castiel assured him. "We can probably pull this off in just a few minutes, since you actually know what you're doing up there."
Castiel smiled before answering. “I’d love it to be.” He might’ve said more, but Dean excitedly pulled him into a kiss, and Castiel wouldn’t have interrupted that for any words. The first kiss led to another, then, even more, and by the time the two arrived back at Dean’s place, even Sam could tell exactly what they’d been up to.
By the time people started to come in and wander around the booths, he was in full artist mode. He noticed out of the corner of his eye that people were browsing his stuff, but he only glanced up when actually spoken to. He’d made three sales in just the first fifteen minutes, only one of them being an oohing and ahhing friend of Eileen’s. As much as he hated to admit it, the kitsch sold, and sold well.
