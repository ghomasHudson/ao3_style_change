do it for him again; he had to up his bribery this time. To be fair, it wouldn’t be the first time Dean got her to do something she’d swore never to do again.
. Dean’s brain came to a screeching halt. Sam had a new boyfriend, didn’t he? Castiel was dating Sam?
I'm just here to check up on you, so as long as you're feeling okay now, we'll wait for another dose of codeine and give it to you with your antibiotic later this evening.”
“Sorry, mom!” Dean apologized sheepishly as they made their way up to the counter. Dean could count on one hand how often he had seen his mom angry, and none of those times had it been directed at him.
Charlie rolled her eyes and Dean knew that it didn’t matter if he said it outloud or not: Charlie knew him better than anyone, despite only being in his life for six months. She settled back into the mattress, fixing the covers around him. She whispered out the plan -- “You have to whisper when you’re planning a mission, dumbass!” -- of breaking in and snooping through Castiel’s second office, confident that if there were going to be any pictures of personal items, that’s the office they would be in.
. He removed his hands from Dean’s chest and white knuckled the headboard, using it for leverage to bounce up-and-down on Dean's cock in reckless abandon.
“Yes, its with him and I don’t know where. It’s driving me crazy!” Dean said as he threw the shirts on the growing pile and turned to find something else.
this, not since Lisa, and well… that hadn’t ended well. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to meet Castiel’s family, because he was actually shocked and excited that Castiel care about him enough to
Dean’s eyebrow raised. A few months ago, Charlie would have never suggested anything like that, let alone actually believe it might be possible for the brothers to be friends. However, Dean could tell that deep down she truly believed it. How he wished he didn’t have to be there when she figured out it would never happen.
Cas replied immediately, his hands trailing up Dean’s thighs, one hand wrapping tightly around Dean’s cock and matching the pace Dean had set. They moved in a seamless rhythm until Dean couldn’t tell where one of them began or ended. The sound of skin moving against skin was almost too loud in the quiet by the river, the rest of the world falling away save for the two of them.
“Oh, shut up!” Sam fired at him, jerking his head to the side to add, “besides, she’s not my girlfriend.” Sam turned back towards Charlie, opening his mouth to speak, but Charlie beat him to it, cutting him off with a hiss.
“Embarrassed?” Dean asked, glancing back up at the camera, then further up to see Cas coming back into the room, towel around his waist.
“Secondly,” Dean pushed forward, placing a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and leading him forward. He hoped it wasn’t his imagination that the other man leaned back into his touch as he followed the lead. “You shouldn’t decorate it on your own. I’m not sure when your family is actually coming, but if you can, you should wait for your niece. She will be ecstatic to be able to decorate with you.”
blares from Dean's phone as he fumbles it out of his back pocket. He balances it between his head and his shoulder, hands busy arranging tree branches. "Sam! Where the hell are you?"
Dean sighed and turned to give her a look. “Are you gonna help me or just give me the third degree?” asked Dean, who had just about given up on trying to find something. His goal had been to pick something that was a little bit nicer than the things he normally wore, but not
“Pie? Why do you have pie?” asked Dean as he walked slowly back towards the table as if the pie would disappear if he went too fast.
He still remembered what she looked like in the hospital bed, had snuck in once for a dressing change once. But most of the time, his father had been shut behind the curtain, talking in hushed whispers with the doctor, while Dean watched Sam in the playroom. They spend most of the time watching people come and go, in various stages of healing.
“I will help too. The rest of you, just get comfortable, we will be right back!” Charlie dragged Dean into the kitchen. “I’m so, so sorry. Sam wasn’t supposed to come. I would
Lucifer looked over the three of them like they were all beneath him, contemplating with a grimace on his face. After a few minutes and a “Hurry it up, we don’t have all day!” from John, Lucifer crossed his arms before he spat out, “I’ll take the chick!” He turned to the rest of his team, his back to Benny and Dean. As everybody knew would happen, Alastair called for Benny right after Lucifer picked Jo. The three of them exchanged glances, knowing Lucifer wouldn’t call Dean’s name even if he was paid.
At an almost torturous pace, Cas leaned in until Dean could feel the head of his cock hitting the back of Cas’ throat.
Dean could very well see how Frank came to that conclusion. In the picture Castiel was dressed in what was most likely supposed to be a pizza delivery outfit, and had some brunette in a sluty school uniform
“Come on,” Dean said softly, “tall tree is the winner. Lets get it tied down to the car and we can bring it over to your place.”
Before Castiel could say anything to comfort his boyfriend, Dean looked up from his arm towards Castiel. “You’re awesome. You’re really, really, really awe--” said Dean with the biggest smile on his face before he seems to lose his trail of thought.
No. Dean wondered if the meds he was on were making him paranoid. Sam hated him but he wouldn’t-- Would he?
She must have been in some kind of a shock because she didn't hear the warning from her friends before it was too late. The next thing she knew, Dean was there and was opening the door wider so he could see what was happening.
“Mr. Winchester,” the officer said slowly, “how would you describe your relationship with your brother, Dean?”
“Oh, great, so you’re saying Castiel is a devil in the sheets? Thanks, Charlie.” That was just what he needed. Her defeated sigh was the last thing he heard before drifting into a restless sleep.
Dean took a look behind him. “Cas, that was the only way here. How could you end up lost here if you were on the main road?”
Dean’s eyes moved from Castiel’s face to the condom between his fingers, the rubber discolored. He reached for it, swearing under his breath when it felt paper dry.
in his hospital room. But it was just his mind playing tricks on him. John wouldn’t have cared one bit if he ended up in the hospital. If he brought it up to his mom, she would only worry, wondering why he was imagining the man. He cleared his throat and shook his head. "You and Bobby were there. I think I remember talking to Cas. Fuck, did I make a total fool out of myself?”
“I’d love a round three, too, Cas, but we gotta go. Pile-up on the freeway and body count is going up. They were 10 minutes out … 6 minutes ago.”
This was by no means the first time Sam had been in the principal’s office. It was, however, the first time that he didn’t know why. Being out of the loop was putting him on edge. And the police man behind Crowley wasn’t helping. “Can I ask what this is all about?”
Walking over, Mary ran a hand through his hair. “More than earned, but-” The ‘we can’t afford it’ went unsaid. “They’re not
night, but it’s too late now and we will just have to try to make the best of this. I will just stay away from Sam as best as I can. Please, try not to make a scene, alright?” When he had gotten both girls to agree, he took a few cans from Jo and added, “Got anything stronger?”
From the look of things, Lucas and Meg would probably be sound asleep on the couch if their son wasn’t so busy telling them about the crazy dream he had.
“Careful,” Dean said as he nearly slipped, laughing as Castiel did the same thing. “Always gets icy right before the steps.”
"Hey! It was Charlie's idea, not mine!" Jo exclaimed at the same time Dean called out, "They did what?"
Dean smiled, snuggling back as Cas settled beside him, Dean pressed back against his chest. Cas sighed happily and Dean was suddenly struck with how he’d originally thought Sam was rushing things between him and Luc. But, lying next to Cas, listening to his breathing even out and settle, feeling warm and safe…  he kind of understood the appeal.
“I really want you to meet Luc, Dean. What do you guys think about coming over for dinner this week? We can grill something up?”
“You know,” Castiel said slowly as he picked up his travel mug and briefcase. “My apartment is closer to the hospital, incase you want to come back tonight? I could order some take out, if you get called in you won’t have to rush to get there…” he trailed off and Dean smiled.
“She’s the reason I decided to become a doctor.” Dean turned his attention to the cup in front of him. He didn’t want to see the man’s face as he told the story, didn’t want to see Castiel’s look of condolence, or worse, pity.
Dean really didn’t need to be told twice and got straight to work. He busted his tail the entire day, with only a few exceptions where his mind wandered off and he started thinking about Castiel. By the afternoon, Bobby had come to the garage to help him work on the cars now that he was done with his paperwork.
“Castiel has two offices, his main Medial Director Office which on the first floor, where Admissions, Financial and the conference rooms are. His second office, is in the back of fourth floor Children Oncology.”
Dean didn’t buy it for one second that Sam didn’t care whether or not he and his friends showed up. Sam had always made sure Dean knew he wasn’t welcomed at the Winchester’s house and he couldn’t imagine that had changed. What he
“Jody is taking care of the shop for me today.” Wincing at the scratching sound caused by Dean nearly sending his pancake flying off of his plate again, Mary reached over to cut up his food. “Ohh, don’t give me that look, Dean Winchester. I’m your mother, I’m allowed to fuss over you all I want.”
“I met Donn -- Ms. Hanscum when I was leaving school. She was so happy with us, she wants to send it into some national competition, which would look great on our college applications. She just needs our permission.”
“I, uh, picked out a few trees for you to look at. I saw a couple good ones while I was restocking earlier. I figured we could grab a bite to eat first, though?” Dean asked, wiping his hand to the side to lead Castiel to the side of the building where Sam’s Jeep and his Impala were parked.
you can start cleaning this room by putting everything back where it’s supposed to be,” John snapped before he stormed into the coach’s office.
Behind them they heard Bobby offering to bring anything Mary and Dean might need. After assuring Mary that it was absolutely no problem for him to pick up new sets of clothes and a couple of other things to drop off in the morning, Bobby joined them at the door.
“No,” Claire answered with a sigh, “he would’ve sent me to my room and made me, like, write lines or something.”
The quick change of subject almost gave Dean whiplash. However, Castiel didn’t look uncomfortable, and Dean was able to relax minutely and take the subject change as acceptance. Although most people he met usually asked the same question, he hadn’t expected it from Castiel. Dean didn’t have to think about it his answer, however, he took a few moments before giving the generic one he’d rehearsed and gave everyone else. “I love helping people.”
Back when Sam had first approached her, she never would have imagined spending so much time with him. But the truth was, she was really enjoying it. Sam was extremely intelligent and they had more in common than she would’ve first guessed. Most of the time she’d come over, she stayed longer than she originally planned and they just ended up hanging out; mostly talking about books they were reading, something she never got to do with her friends, where they wanted to go to college. Pretty much everything they could think of.
There was something his mom wasn’t telling him. Normally she would be all over the place, making sure he was comfortable and had everything he needed. But now she was just sitting there, stroking the same spot over and over again, not looking him in the eyes. It put him on edge.
Sadly the computer was off, otherwise she would have risked it and looked at what John Winchester had hiding in there. It wouldn’t have taken her long, but she couldn’t turn it on and risk being caught in there. As she turned to leave, she noticed an old leather jacket had been flung over a chair shoved into the corner. Just barely noticeable was a book sticking out of the inside pocket.
“Shit, I’m sorry! We need to get him to the emergency room, Cassy. I’m gonna try to bring the car closer,” Gabriel said before taking off through the trees. He shouted over his shoulder, “I’ll be right back!”
“I know, Mom, I’m sorry! I would take it back if I could, trust me. But John and Sam already talked with the principal about this and, when I asked, Coach Turner said that this was final. Now Sam gets to do something he actually wants to do, meanwhile I’m stuck in gym.”
“No,” Castiel whispered and shook his head, “it’s his smile as we all crammed into the living room, his laugh as Claire tore into everyone's gifts, and just the way he seemed to fill every room in the house, even if he wasn’t in it.”
“Yes, I would guess so too,” Dean responded, before clueing in to what his patient had just said. “Ohhhh, you mean… you thought…” he laughed heartily, “Ewww, no. Jo is not my wife or girlfriend, she’s my always annoying, pain in the ass, little sister. Or, to be exact, step-sister.”
“He’s in room two-oh-five, but you can’t go in there; he’s with a patient,” Jo was saying, her voice getting closer by the second.
“For the millionth time, they are not underwear models!” said Charlie defensively. “They’re-- You know what, never mind. Is Chuck Shurley really his dad?
. She absolutely loved everything he’d ever written. Not obsessively though, like some of the other girls in this school. Becky, for example, who had just turned around in her seat to take a long look at Castiel, blue eyes blow wide and her mouth open as she stared.
"Alright, alright," Meg finally said, reaching over with a wet wipe and clearing the syrup from his face and hands as best as she could before nodding her head. "Your stocking
“Fine but what do you say we get started on your car, since we charge by the hour.” said Dean with a grin on his face.
Dean took a moment to look over Castiel from a distance, resolutely making up his mind as he made his way back over. He didn’t need his brother’s permission, but he damn well was going to take the idea. Castiel straightened from where he was examining the base of a Douglas Fir as soon as he heard Dean’s footsteps approach.
“The rumors, are they true?” asked Castiel all of the sudden while he and Dean walked together towards the cafeteria. Thankfully, the hallway was empty; Mr. Devereaux had let them out from class early and the rest of the class had pretty much ran towards the cafeteria to be first in line.
thought Dean as he to turn in his seat to look at Castiel while he tried to take in all the information that Frank was giving him. “I thought you were related to Lucifer,” whispered Dean to Cas when Mr. Devereaux turned his back to the class.
Ever since he showed up to school after the weekend, Sam’s friends had been making his life hell. Stealing his stuff, disturbing the class and then blaming him for it, and pushing him around -- into lockers, doorways, the girl’s bathroom -- when no one was looking.
.” He emphasises the final word partly out of spite to remind Balthazar that he isn’t the only qualified physician in this conversation but also to remind himself. And convince himself that he wasn’t only checking in on Castiel to see how cute he is, that his visit had an actual
Cas’ tone had him glancing back at him, inwardly cringing at the hard stare he received from Cas. Before he had a chance to reply, Cas stood up and walked away without another word, leaving Dean to watch helplessly.
. Maybe it had something to do with him and Cas… After all, Charlie started acting weird after Dean started hanging out with Castiel. But then, why had Charlie been trying to get them together? None of this made any sense.
Dean shot up out of bed, immediately grabbing the pillow he'd been laying on and swinging it before him as if it were a sword, blinking the sleep from his eyes as he looked around the room in alarm. Beside him, Castiel groaned and rolled over into the warm spot, pressing his face behind Dean's back.
, it was his in all the way it matters. “I believe the two of you are going to get along just fine,” he said before leaving them alone.
“Look, Cas, it’s fine…” started Dean as he rubbed the sore spot on his head from where he had hit his head.
“Hi, Cas! Sorry, I’m late. Detention took longer than it was supposed to,” said Dean as he sat down across from Cas. Since Dean knew that Castiel wasn’t a fan of pies he offered Castiel the cake and offered to go get something else if he didn’t want it.
Ash had fallen asleep in the middle of the movie, like usual, Benny and Gabriel were talking about who knew what, and not wanting to be stuck with Sam, Dean quickly got and said, “I’m going to get more snacks!” before he headed to the kitchen area.
Dean chuckled, watching the man’s face for a moment. Since they opened the lot, Dean had met a lot of people in their neighborhood, even receiving an influx of regulars for their normal car maintenance. But he’d never seen this man before…
“You’re not so bad yourself,” Castiel mumbled Dean’s words from earlier, smiling against Dean’s lips as he helped the other man maneuver his jeans the rest of the way off, kicking them to the floor. “What do you say we take yours off now?”
In all honesty, Dean didn’t blame John for leaving; he was young and had his whole life ahead of him. In Dean’s opinion, leaving was one of the few good decisions John has ever made. The only thing Dean hated was that his mom had been left alone to deal with the fall out.
“No, don’t worry, you’re still my favorite Winchester. Sam is just… he’s different when he isn’t surrounded by his friends and family. He’s not this major jerk I’d pictured him as all these years. He’s fun to hang around with and he’s
“Good,” Balthazar started, sitting down on the edge of Castiel's Bed. “It was a nasty RTC - multiple vehicles and multiple casualties, I'm afraid. Apparently there were at least two fatalities at the scene.” He looked truly upset at the thought, and Castiel sadly realised that this was an extremely unusual look on his friend, who was usually full of frivolity. The accident must have been really horrendous.
“Wait! You have some on your face, here let me get it for you,” came Cas raspy voice a few seconds later. “You sure you want some more? Because I think I have some more for you.”
When they reached the classroom, they saw that Castiel was already there. Charlie ran over to get the two seats behind Castiel. Unfortunately, Castiel didn’t even seem to notice her, he was just lost in his own little bubble. After a few failed attempts from Charlie to get his attention,  Jo finally took pity on her and throw a piece of paper at Castiel. The look on Castiel’s face when he turned around was adorable. He looked like a lost little puppy.
“Because I help you with your homework,” answered Charlie last. “Plus, I own all of the good tv-shows.”
Think how you’re going to feel when Charlie kills you tomorrow and this will be the last thing you said to me.
“We all do,” Castiel replied. “I miss your dad every single day. Don’t put pressure on your mom to date, Claire. That’s not fair to her, or to you. Do you want her to date someone?”
The shop was quite crowded and most of the tables were in use; Dean didn’t see Castiel anywhere when he looked over the place. As Dean made his way up to the counter, the door behind it opened and his mom stepped out from the back room, carrying a tray with some coffee cups on them.
“Also,” Castiel drew Dean’s attention back towards him, “I should’ve clarified before, but I don’t have a vehicle with me. I walked here.”
For instance, right now he was sitting under a tree in the school ground with Benny, Charlie, Jo and Ash. The girls were gossiping about the new kids that were supposedly starting the school later this day. Apparently they were related to some popular kids in the school. Dean wasn't really paying attention.
Ignoring the logical part of his brain, Dean moved towards Cas and wrapped his arms around the shorter man, his now fully hard cock resting perfectly between Cas’ cheeks, separated only by the thin layer of his sweats. Dean nuzzled the junction of Cas’ neck and shoulder and slightly sucked on the skin there.
Dean didn’t know whether he wanted to kiss Castiel or kill him. On one hand, he’d told Bobby about their date which Dean had been trying to keep low-key for the moment, but on the other… Castiel scored permission for Dean to take his baby out for a ride.
Dean nodded and shuffled over to where Sam was sitting, showing him the gift. Together, each brother took a side and pulled the paper free, revealing a large framed photograph. It was a black and white photo, blown up from a the newspaper story, highlighting Winchester Auto when it was first opened. In front of the shop, John Winchester stood, leaning against the same black Chevy Impala that was parked out in Castiel's garage, his arm around Mary Winchester. Dean swallowed hard as he ran his fingers over the picture, lifting the frame up over Sam's lap so he could see it better.
“I don’t think you have to do anything, but I’m not sure. You’re the first one to join after we founded it. Charlie might come up with something for you to do, but I promise I won’t let her decide on something too crazy.” Knowing Charlie, Dean knew that it might even end up worse for him than it would for Castiel.
After finishing hanging up his jacket, Dean moved forward a few steps so he would be standing next to Cas. Before he had a chance to introduce himself, Luc turned his gaze towards him. “So, you’re the guy who’s fucking my baby brother.”
The only person that Dean could think of that wasn’t in his phone was Castiel, but he hadn’t even given Cas his number! Of course, there was always the possibility that his friends had told him...
“Of course. It’s my job.” He glances back over his shoulder to see Bobby leaning over and kissing Ellen’s hand as she smiles through her pain. “And I’ve been pretty damn selfish. You’re right. I need to be around for this family more. I will be. I swear.”
“Are you just going to stare at me all day?” Dean challenged in mild frustration as Cas sat back on his heels, looking down at Dean spread out before him. Castiel simply smiled and kept their eyes locked as he stripped himself of his clothes.
“It’s okay, I’ll clean it up,” Dean said quickly, pulling Castiel away from the breakfast bar as the man tried to multitask hacking up a lung and finding a towel.  Dean helped him over to the couch, pulling a thick blanket from the back of the recliner and settling it over his shoulders.
“Just like that, Dean,” Cas moaned, his grip tightening as his palm slid over the head of Dean’s dick, jacking back down with the roll of Dean’s hips. “I love you, Dean. I love you so fucking much.”
She poked her finger right against Dean's sternum and Dean fought to not wince. “What the hell are you doing keeping the Medical Director for more observation? He's ready to go home.”
“I didn’t want to accidentally hurt you in my sleep,” said his mom through a groan as she stretched her back.
it had been a long time since someone had deep throated him this well. Making it even better, Cas swallowed around him at the same time as he pushed a lubed finger into him to the hilt in one stroke. Dean almost sobbed with pleasure at the dual sensations. He bit his bottom lip as he fucked himself onto Cas’ finger, alternating it with thrusting his hips into Cas’ mouth.
"Why, Dean, I was coming downstairs anyway, no need to bring me breakfast in bed, you huge flirt." He drawled with a wiggle of his eyebrows. Dean just rolled his eyes in response, way too used to Gabe's flirtations by this point, and continued his way upstairs.
“Huhh… oh hey, Dean. I didn’t hear you, I was too busy trying to get this goddamn thing to work,” said Bobby as he hit the computer screen in front of him.
Never before had Castiel been so glad to see someone. If anyone could make John leave, it was sure to be Bobby.
They cleaned up the rest of the kitchen, what little that was left of the pizza was wrapped and stored in the fridge, and Dean went room to room shutting off the lights as Castiel locked the doors. They met back up at the foot of the stairs, the room glowing a bright pink from the Christmas lights. He reached back, twisting his fingers with Castiel’s.
Castiel waited a moment, eyes locked with Dean’s, before nodding. “Thanks Doctor, I'm fine for now.”
As Dean bitched about how there was way too much space, Jo quickly promised him that this wouldn’t happen every movie night. She and Charlie just wanted some room to stretch their legs for once! They had the space, so why not use it?
Castiel looked at the bag and then back to Dean’s eyes. “That was very thoughtful of Zar. But you didn’t have to go out of your way-”
The words slowly worked through Cas’ sleep-addled mind, his eyes opening suddenly. He blinked up at Dean, half surprised to see him still there and dressing quickly. Right. Intimate evening… twice. Cas sat up, swinging his legs off the side of the bed with a soft groan.
He focused instead on Castiel swapping out the mugs and k-cups, turning his head to the side to cough into his elbow. He gave Dean a sheepish, apologetic smile, to which Dean responded with a good natured eye roll.  Castiel finished up, tossing the two used k-cups in the trash, before turning back with two steaming mugs. Dean smiled when he was handed his cup.
? Why didn’t I know about it?” asked Charlie without giving them any time to answer as she sat down next to Dean. “I want to know everything!”
Charlie hit Dean hard in the shoulder before she said, “Never mind that. Why didn’t you tell me you had a boyfriend?”
Castiel kissed the top of Dean's head and curled back around him, snuggling into the warmth his boyfriend's body had to offer. As he started to drift off, he thought of Jimmy and how Jimmy definitely would've approved of Dean, and he sent up a silent prayer that next Christmas would be just like this.
“Alright, alright, cut it out.” He managed to shove her off completely and threw a look at her. “Charlie,” he sighed, “would you like to come and crawl into bed with me? There’s beer and… tap water.”
“It’s a nice little restaurant owned by a family that lives here nearby. They bought this place a year ago and have been working on turning it into a restaurant. They haven’t fully opened yet so they are keeping it low-key until they are ready. But their food is really good, trust me.”
Dean moaned in pleasure and pulled off just long enough to rasp out a 'fuck my face, Cas' before getting back to sucking his boyfriend's, frankly, delicious dick. Completely onboard with the idea. cas bent his knees, and used his grip in Dean's hair to bob his mouth up and down on himself. Occasionally, Cas would thrust his hips into the wetness of Dean's mouth, but for the most part, Dean was completely at Cas' disposal, to use as he wished. Dean's eyes rolled into his head at that thought, and he felt a drop of precome drip down his own cock, which he hadn't even realized was hard.
"I'm sure. I've done the math. I'll still be there before Cas. I'm not gonna drop the ball on this, Dean. I've got you."
“Don’t worry, I will be there when he gets out of detention. After all, I’m only here because I’m waiting for him.”
“Oh fuck,” Dean groaned as Castiel ground down. He thrust up a few more times, hips stuttering and cock throbbing as he spilled his hot load inside of Castiel.
Once everyone was seated and plates were loaded with food, they took a moment for Michael to speak grace. Castiel's thumb moved smoothly over Dean's wrist while Michael spoke, and Dean found himself smiling and giving his boyfriend's hand a squeeze back. Once the table repeated Michael's "Amen", they dug in.
The two of them talked the whole way to Dean’s house. Dean would talk about cars and Castiel would talk about bees, that for some reason he was strangely fascinated by. They talked about everything from school, to work and to friends. Everything except Sam.
Dean had never seen anything more beautiful. He wanted to pull over right there, crawl into Cas' lap and kiss him senseless. Wanted to strip him naked, and take his time until Cas couldn't think of anything but him. Wanted to take him apart piece by piece.
“And here I was trying to be considerate. Not all of us sleep like the dead you know,” Mary said with a sigh, “I still have nightmares from when you used to sleep in my bed.”
“Let’s go back to my place, it’s closer.” All Dean could do was nod, both hands tight on the steering wheel, knuckles white.
When they went on their first date - was that really only nine days ago? - Dean immediately knew Cas and his family were close. It was clear from the way he talked about them, all of them. When he found that picture on Tuesday, and then Castiel explained the double marriage situation, Dean didn’t understand how Amelia and Cas could be close and yet, strained. Cas had reassured him that the cool awkwardness over his divorce to Daphne was always just a tough topic, and that they’d worked past it, especially after Jimmy died.
“What the…” Castiel squeaked, disorientated at the sudden change of position. He blinked up at Dean, hissing as Dean gingerly pulled his cock out of Castiel’s sensitive hole.
“But we have lot of plans for him!” answered Alistair angry, almost like Sam was taking his favorite toy away.
It became quite clear early on in the game that the other boys in the class were more interested in getting Dean in trouble then they were in winning. The only time Dean even came close to getting the ball was after Jo had stolen it from one of the guys and sent it over to Dean. He had been in the perfect position to score, and he knew he would have made the shot if Lucifer hadn’t run into him.
Rolling his eyes, Dean picked out a random movie and put it in, knowing that he had no plans on actually watching the movie. He then ignored the huge amount of space on the couch and deposited himself on Cas’ lap, wrapping an arm around his neck and resting the other on his cheek. Cas brought his arms up to wrap around Dean’s waist and looked up at Dean with those big blue eyes.
“Alright, are you ready for the best burger of your life?” Dean asked, pulling the keys free and smiling as Castiel’s eyes lit up. He nodded eagerly and Dean chuckled as he let himself out of the car, stopping at the front of it to wait for Castiel.
I'm terribly sorry for the long wait! I want to say it will never happen again, but I would probably be lying.
"Oops... did I forget to tell you I took your place? Don't worry though, I put your name on the list next to it. I think it was... literature or something? Nerd." Dean gave his best, nasty sneer, before dragging Benny as far away from his so called brother as he could.
“He and his brother found you and brought you to the hospital,” explained Mary. After telling him everything the doctors and cops had told her, she asked, “Do you remember anything after you got to the hospital? You were pretty out of it by the time I showed up.”
“Oh, right… I see how it is,” she shouted after him, frustratedly. “I’m not gonna keep covering for you, you know.”
Castiel smiled then, cocking his head to the side to meet Dean’s eyes. “I would love to get dinner with you, Dean.”
Dean raked his fingers through his hair, shaking his head to clear his thoughts away. Not feeling well, my ass. He’s telling Ellen that he thinks Jo’s pregnant next time he gets around to visiting for dinner.
“Couldn't stay away huh?” asked Dean as he opened the door to -- nothing. “Hello?” Flicking the flood light on, Dean poked his head out the door and looked around, unable to see anyone outside the house or in the driveway. Had they gone already? It hadn’t taken
Benny lets go with a bark of laughter. "You betta get on with it, brotha. Dean's gonna start worryin'."
Dean glanced down at the shirt, Novak Real Estate plastered on the corner. He thought about arguing that maybe the person he was dating had purchased their home using the Novak’s, but quickly squashed the idea. Instead, he smiled, looking away from the camera.
“Alright,” Dean said reluctantly, pushing back and sliding off the end of the bed. “I love you,” he said as he exited the room, letting the door fall mostly shut behind him.
Having to bend down over and over again and then walk back and forth was starting to take it’s toll on Dean who was already tired and hurting. But Dean kept going, mainly because he didn’t want John to have one more thing to hold over him. As much as this sucked, Dean was thankful that John left him alone. The only exception was when there were fifteen minutes left of detention and John came out of his office just to tell Dean that he better not forget to wipe the benches too.
Shutting the book, Dean didn’t know what to think. Was this real? If it wasn’t...somebody had put a lot of effort into making it. But who would do that? And why? His stomach twisted with conflicting emotions, ones he didn’t want to put a name to.
“So he’s the same he has been for the last few years, got it,” answered Dean with a smile as he put his stuff on the nearest table. “Hey Mom, is Charlie still here?”
Sighing, Dean forced himself up. With a few false starts, almost tumbling back to the ground on his face more than once, he was able to get to his feet. Happy for the small victory, he tried getting back to town on his own, but he’d only made it a few steps before his vision started to go black. He must have managed to sit down against the nearest tree before he blacked out.
“It’s just the same old crap I’ve been dealing with ever since John moved back to town,” said Dean, exasperated. He tried to cross his arms, the cast making it impossible, so he settled for giving his mom a hard stare.
After Mr. Devereaux opened the classroom, Dean and Castiel made their way inside. “Follow me,” said Dean to Cas as he went straight to the computers in the back next to the window.
"Five minutes, man. Just five minutes. I'm at the corner of Elm. There's an accident in front of me, but it's almost completely cleared up."
The silence on the other end was so long that Castiel was about to ask if she was still there. “What-what do you mean he was
Dean was there when Castiel was sick, when he felt frustrated at work or unworthy of his position. There had been a huge turn around in staff a few months back, making Castiel believe it was his fault and failings that were causing staff turmoil. Every single thing that happened, Dean was there to pick up the pieces or to cheer him on.
Dean gave him a small smile, an excuse on his lips to leave and let the man rest, when a thought occurred to him.
“Only one out of four an’t bad,” said Dean as he looked through his mail, the stack was a lot bigger than he’d anticipated. How long had it even been since he was home last? Four, five days? Apparently time really does fly when you are having fun. It was a good thing he didn’t have any plants to water or pets to feed. Since there wasn’t anything important that he needed to worry about, he put down the stack on a nearby dresser.
“Maybe the two of you could have gotten away with it, but I have a feeling I won't and I’m probably going to drag the two of you down with me,” answered Dean while watching John who was busy going over something on his board. Before any of them could say something more, John looked up and noticed them.
"Heya, Cas." His eyes sparkle with unshed tears. His posture is perfect, but his voice wobbles on Cas' name, like he's unsure.
“So you’re telling me that he spends every morning with sick kids?” Well, that’s really helping this whole crush thing…
His mom had done everything in her power to protect him growing up, including keeping information about his father's family from him if she thought it would hurt him. Was that what was going on? Was she trying to spare his feelings by not telling him that, once again, his father and brother didn’t care that he was hurt? Or did she know who was behind the attack? Maybe… did Sam have something to do with it?
friends kidnapped him and beat him up! I can’t- I can’t look past that,” she said, tears swimming in her eyes. “Even though you didn’t do anything, you know what they did and you’re still friends with them. The only reason they treat him the way they do is because of you, and you know that. I don’t want someone like that around me. So until you and Dean bury whatever it is between you? Pretend you never even knew me.”
Throwing the covers away to get up, stopping long enough to pull Cas in for a kiss, Dean made his way to the bathroom. “Just make sure there’s coffee,” he answered. As he crossed the threshold he added, “A lot of it.”
When Sam had pitched the idea for community outreach, Dean had thought he was crazy. Winchester’s Auto had been a well-run business for the better part of forty years. It was started by their father after he retired from the Marines, and they did just fine. They at least broke even, had a few loyal customers, and were comfortable enough to do a few pro bono jobs if the situation arose.
“Ugh, I guess I can do it if you can’t find anyone else,” said Charlie with a fake annoyance. “Now, tell me everything you’ve been up to lately. Starting with you coming out to your dad!”
The clock on the wall read 5:45 when Dean walked into his mom’s cafe-shop later that day, which made him half an hour late. Detention with John had been hell and had gone on and on; Dean was completely exhausted.
“I would like to be your friend, but I don’t see how that’s going to work out. Sam and I really won’t get along and I can't see Sam being willing to share you with me.”
. We spend most nights here as it is, and the nights he’s got to be home, I end up as his apartment. It seems so stupid for him to be paying for rent when I have this big house to myself…”
over att Tumblr) was awesome enough to offered to help, so it’s all thanks to her that you are getting this now, please go thank her for me. She’s has been super helpful and made this much better.
Either way, Castiel tried  to get to know the new staff at least a little bit. He was usually a good judge of character, but he was also a damn good doctor and he should at least try to make sure that Dr. Winchester was up to snuff, right? He reached for his bag, pulling out a second red pen since the first was lost, and clicked it open.
“Great! Now all we need is a code name. How about operation Dean’s-easy-sex-to-intimate-endless-love.”
"I... wow," Sam replied, laying the frame carefully over his lap before holding out his hand. "I - yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. I... we -"
Dean stopped dead in his tracks, having been caught. “Damnit.” Sighing to himself, he turned and forced a smile, dragging his feet back to the nurse's station. “What's up, Jo?”
, nothing else, not even who it was from. Even before Dean picked it up he could see that it was full of old newspapers clips, pictures, and pages that were covered in text.
“Mmhmm, is that any way to talk to your mother?” said Mary with a chuckle. Dean gave her a sheepish smile in response. “Now, how do you feel? And no ‘I’m fine’ bullshit, Dean Winchester.”
He's been meticulous about everything, down to the last detail. He went back and forth with Claire, picking out the font and colors for the letters in texts, and Donna let him use the fancy printer over at Signs Unlimited. Ellen called in a favor from her florist friend over in Kansas City to get these super special flowers, and Amelia and Gabe picked the order up on their way into town. He dug the lights out of Sam's garage, and between himself and his friends Benny and Ash, they manhandled the trees into place.
He had Dean’s support when Lucifer and his sister, Anna, passed away unexpectedly, leaving her toddler orphaned. There had been little argument, both Lucifer and Sam -- who had celebrated a year of dating with a shotgun wedding in Vegas, informing them with a selfie (and Castiel
Dean could hear the car getting closer and closer and it wasn’t long before Gabriel came jogging through the nearest trees. “I brought it as close as I could. Can he walk?”
“Are you two just going to stand around on your phones all day? Or do you want to go home any time soon?” asked Mary from the other side of the room where she was cleaning the counter.
at the head of Cas' dick, dipping his tongue into the slit and tasting the salty tanginess of the precome gathered there.
“That’s it!” said Charlie with a surprisingly steady voice, despite the tears glittering in her eyes, as she stood up. “Why was I so stupid? I’m going to make him regret ever messing with one of the Scooby gang!”
There was a fine sheen of sweat across Cas’ chest and stomach, shining in the yellow glow of their lamplight, his hair was a goddamn mess – which was only slightly different than normal – and Dean moved his hand from Cas’ chest to grip his hair tight and smash their lips together.
Standing in front of his locker, Dean was busy emptying his bag from the books he was done with, and replacing the new ones he’d need for the next few classes. His school bag was really a mess right now and Dean wondered what he would have to do to get Charlie to organize it for him again. The last time she did it for him, Dean had fucked it up again in record time, and needless to say, Charlie had not been happy. In fact, she said she would
“You won’t return my calls, so if the mountain won’t come to Mohammed…” Sam interrupted. “You can’t ignore me forever, you know,” he continued, before noticing Castiel in the bed. “Oh, hey there Castiel. You’re still sick?”
He licked Cas clean as they both came down from their orgasms, and went easily as Cas pulled him up for a kiss. The kiss was filthy, and soft at the same time; Cas could probably taste himself in Dean's mouth. Dean felt a hand creep into his pants, and the moment Cas realized he had come in his pants was obvious. Cas broke their kiss to moan loudly, and pressed his hand around Dean's sensitive, softening dick, just on the right side of being painful.
“There’s no need for knives,” Castiel said with a sigh, looking up and adding, “Charlie, sit back down. That’s just going to make everything worse.” He gripped her hand in order to stop her, then turned his head to look back at Jo. “Just let the police handle this. We don’t even know if Sam had anything--”
“So, as an adult, I’ve kept with the simplicity. It’s been a while since I’ve decorated anything. But Sam? We go all out at his house. I roll my eyes when he makes a big deal about having me there to decorate the tree, and he always insists we make gingerbread houses and do the whole popcorn and cranberry strings… but I love it.”
Without thinking, Dean said the first thing that came to his mind, “Why didn’t you go to John’s place. I’m sure Sam could have gotten you an appointment there.”
his relationship with Castiel while it lasted’. Or, better yet, just save Castiel the heartache and call it quits now.
“Cas,” Dean groaned out as his boyfriend started to fuck his hips up, meeting each of Dean’s downward thrusts. Sparks of pleasure were dancing their way through Dean’s lower body and he threw his head back, fingernails digging into Cas’ knees.
“That didn’t look like nothing. Wouldn’t be thinking of a particularly young, hot doctor would we, Cassie?” Balthazar asked, stepping further inside the office, sitting down in an empty chair next to Cas’ desk.
They bundled up, and trudged out into the snow. The sky was bright and blue with a few wintery, wispy clouds, and the snow sparkled. Their breath came out in white wisps, the air cold and crisp. Dean took a deep cleansing breath, grabbed Castiel’s hand, and pulled him out of his yard, into the neighborhood.
“Oh,” said Claire quietly. After looking at the photo a little longer, she closed the wallet and handed it back. Dean noticed she handled it a lot more gently now than she did when he first handed it over. “I’m sorry.”
"He's seventy-six, which made him a long shot anyway. But he's been diagnosed with cancer. His four grandchildren didn't take the news well.
“Ah, shit.” Eloquent, Dean. He stumbled further into the room, catching himself before he made a complete fool of himself and fell over, thankfully. He brushed his hands down the front of his black scrub pants, doing his best for a smooth recovery.
Castiel fell silent, knowing that Balthazar was right. His friend always could read him like a book.
Finally catching on that Dean was just joking, Castiel put on the saddest look he could muster and said “I like it, so I guess you’re just going to have to walk if we are ever going somewhere,” before handing over the keys.
“I wasn’t expecting company,” Castiel said over his shoulder as he unlocked his door and opened it, “so ignore the mess.” He flipped on the lights and stepped out of the way, giving Dean room to pass with the tree. “You can’t miss the living room; its to the left at the end of the foyer.”
“Look, maybe we shouldn’t be talking about this, according to everyone else I’m not the best at knowing what I should say and what I shouldn’t sometimes. I’m sure Sam doesn’t want me to tell you everything I know about him.”
This is why I always talk to you about other people! You don’t go tell people what I just told you. You need to say goodbye to Benny before I kill him tomorrow.
Both Mary and Dean had often hinted to Bobby and Ellen that they should get together, but the pair always shut the thought down.
“Honestly, you two. You’re worse than Jo. She took one look at me, said I should have been more careful and that she had other patients to tend to. It’ll take more than a fall from a ladder to finish me off, you two should know that.” She smiles warmly, chucking Sam under the chin as she does and he smiles weakly, clearly shaken but relieved. “Now, Doctor Winchester, are you going to get me some x-rays or do I have to sit here all day?”
Not five minutes after her friends left, Charlie’s felt her phone vibrate in her pocket. When she looked at it, she found one new message from “Moose”. She wasn’t sure why she had picked that name for Sam, she just didn’t want Dean to accidentally see that she was talking to his brother and the name just seemed to fit Sam for some reason.
Words were overrated anyways. He rest his head back on Castiel’s chest, his eyes falling closed as he listened to the sound of his heart.
“He’s not there often, mostly when he needs a break. He was the Department Head before me. His position was offered to me when he moved up, which is why I transferred here from Boston,” Charlie explained. “He keeps his bag there, goes there every morning before his shift starts, and puts his lunch in the mini fridge. I’m not sure the hospital knows he still has the second office, but its like seeing all the kids is what he needs instead of a cup of joe.”
“I said you could go home if you were good. But that's not happening… yet. You're gonna have to put up with me a while longer.” There was a definite smirk on Dean's face, which somehow made him even more attractive.
Showing up ten minutes late for class earned him a lecture about punctuality, but thankfully no extra detention. After listening to Mr. Ketch go on and on about the importance of being on time, Dean finally got to go sit down next to Charlie in the back.
Dean sighed, waving his arm forward as the elevator dinged and opened to the bottom floor. He was going to regret this…
Doctor Novak popped a couple of pills in his mouth, washed it down with a bottle of water, and then settled back into the couch.
Castiel hadn’t noticed right away that Dean had stopped so he had gotten a little ahead of Dean and was now waiting for him in front of the cafeteria. After Dean caught up with him, they walked inside together, both of them smiling. Even though their class had ended early, a lot of other classes had gotten to the cafeteria before them. Like Sam’s class for example. When Castiel noticed him, he turned back to Dean and said, “Listen, Dean, I promised Sam I would sit with him today so I will meet you at the cafe-shop. Around 5:15?”
Sam gave a small laugh, shaking his head. “I cried, Dean. Here I am, hanging off my new boyfriend, crying as I told him everything about Eileen and he… he just stayed and held me and told me he could see how special she was. And that’s when I knew that I was falling in love with him.”
Dean shrugged. Truth be told, he was too nervous to really enjoy a meal anyway. But helping people, making them feel better—this was what he was made for. He stood and held out his hand. "C'mon."
Dean had just about enough of the Winchesters, and the last thing he wanted was to see where John was going with this. Dean was willing to bet everything he owned that John would end up saying that not terminating the pregnancy had ruined Mary’s chances of a good life, would make it clear in front of his entire class what a waste and a mistake he thought his oldest son was. Dean knew that it had never been Mary’s plan to get pregnant, but she had made sure to tell him again and again that she never regretted having him. That didn’t stop people, Dean included, from thinking that Mary would have been happier if she’d been able to enjoy her life a little bit longer before she had a child.
Dean turned towards Castiel, giving him an apologetic smile. “Uh, well, just keep looking and I’ll come find you, okay?”
Dean didn’t know what compelled him, not even Sammy knew the real drive behind Dean choosing his current profession. Their experiences had been so different over the years, but Dean always kept his cards close to his chest. But there was something in the way Castiel was looking at him, the sincerity in his eyes, the genuine curiosity, that had Dean opening his mouth.
“Yeah, I understand. He’s your friend and we are just…” What exactly were they? They hardly knew each other so they couldn't be friends. Classmates, maybe?
Dean continued to eat Castiel out with fervor, altering between long broad strokes and teasing prods of his tongue. Castiel’s legs began to twitch and shake as his breathing became erratic. Dean grinned as he gently scraped his teeth across Castiel’s rim.
Sam Winchester was Dean’s half brother. When Mary told his father she was pregnant with Dean, John had been overjoyed. A week later he told her that he was leaving for college and that he would pay for her to have an abortion. Why John suddenly decided he didn't want their kid and to leave for school was a mystery. Needless to say, Mary did not have an abortion; John still left.
Dean gave a small laugh, looking over and meeting Cas’ eyes for a moment, before feeling himself blush. He considered for a moment slowing down, but shrugged. He knew Castiel was just as eager to get back to Dean’s place, too.
Dean swallowed his bite just in time to call “Love you too, Mom. Bye!” before the door closed behind her. He finished his breakfast in total silence except the occasional scraping of the cutlery before putting everything away and going back upstairs to get ready.
“Who would’ve thought hanging out with our brothers would be more exhausting than work at the the hospital?” wondered Dean out loud as he made his way towards the bedroom, leaving a trail of clothes in his wake. Yes, he was absolutely exhausted, but in a good way.
“It wouldn’t surprise me if Benny told him that last night. You’re lucky I needed a new friend, instead of my old ones,” joked Dean.
Eventually, Castiel had to cough, and it seemed to release him from the spell he had fallen under. Dean’s expression changed, and he hurriedly put down the drinks he was holding.
When Dean heard the bell at the reception ring, he wiped his hands on the side of his pants out of habit, before remembering that his mom wouldn’t be all that pleased with the extra dirty laundry. Grabbing the cloth Bobby had brought him last month, he finished cleaning his hands the best he could without washing them and made his way to the reception.
Dean smiled softly as he watched him leave, then gave himself a minute so stretch before climbing out of the bed. For his part, Sam stayed leaning against the wall by the door, hiding a yawn behind his hand and trying not to let on that he was snooping around Cas' room with his eyes.
Well, she wasn't his really. There was no way he had enough money to buy her. Knowing Bobby like he did, he knew Bobby would love to just give him the car. But Bobby's garage wasn't doing so well right now; Dean wouldn't want to take a car that Bobby could sell, for free. For now, Dean would just work on getting his baby back in to tip top condition and save enough money to buy her later.
Cas’ mouth stilled on his cock for a second before he pulled off, making Dean whine at the loss of the heat. He smirked before reaching behind Dean and pulled out a bottle of lube seemingly from nowhere and replied, “I was cooking naked because I wanted to fuck you in the kitchen, did you really think I wouldn’t have brought the lube with me?” The gritty texture of Cas’ voice was made even rougher from the blowjob and it almost made Dean some right then.
Cas sighed. "I know. And I made the right decision. It's just hard sometimes, to look a person in the eyes and tell them their loved one's life isn't worth as much as someone else's."
Without getting up from his place on Cas’ lap, Dean turned to Sam and said, “After this morning, you really should know better, Sammy.” He smirked.
Dean did as he was told, sliding into one of the chairs in front of the breakfast bar. The kitchen was large, but simple, with a rustic, homey feel that made Dean feel slightly more relaxed. If he allowed his mind to wander, he could picture himself flipping pancakes at the stove, Castiel beside him in the early morning preparing their coffee, smiling at him sleepily. The realization that Dean wanted something like that nearly knocked him off the stool, and he was grateful for the beeping of the Keurig to pull him out of the dangerous thoughts.
Hi there! This is BabysNotaProp and I'm so excited to show you guys what I've decided to add to the story. Fair warning, it's NSFW. Thank you to the amazing CastielsCarma for betaing my chapter.
Unfortunately for Charlie, the conversation was very one sided. Sam didn’t say much, he just sat there and listened to whatever it was that his mother was saying. Her mind began to wander to the differences between her and Sam. Who would’ve thought they would be sitting here having a civil conversation?
“The kid looks just like you,” asked Claire as she looked at a photo of a blonde women, sitting on top of the Impala, hugging a goofy little kid. “You’re not married are you?” she added with a glare at Dean.
“Well, you called first, right?” Castiel asked and then have a half shrug at Sam’s expression. “Okay, point taken. But if it’s been… months?”
“Because you were the only one that caught me in the act and I thought we agreed to never speak of it again!” answered Benny, who to Dean’s amazement was actually blushing.
Normally that would at least bring a small smile on his face but after the day he had, Dean couldn’t muster the energy to even smile a little bit.
, in an Old English font, if he isn't mistaken. He's also holding a stunning, vibrant red and orange flower, which he hands to Cas. "It's a—"
Cas nodded, sitting on the edge of the bed and straightening his tie. Dean followed him out of the bedroom, smiling when he saw there was fresh coffee in the pot and a mug left beside it for him.
Castiel laughed as he took another bite of his pie, smiling as he licked the creamy filling from his fork obscenely. “Mmmm, delicious.” He winked as Dean’s smirk dropped from his face and he stared at the fork with wide eyes.
Dean responded in kind, kissing him back before reluctantly letting him go. “I’ll probably check out your coffee maker, but I should do some errands today. That’s if they don’t end up calling me in. I’m on call tonight.”
“This is a devil’s trap?” Dean asked, cocking the notebook to look at it from a different angle. “Huh, good to know... It might come in handy someday since I’m pretty sure some people in the school are possessed.” Dean chuckled to himself and glanced up at Castiel with a slight shake of his head. No sense in making his new friend think he’s a freak. “No, I saw it somewhere, probably in one of Jo’s books or something, and I thought it was cool.”
That was apparently all the cue he needed because Dean was immediately coming explosively, without a hand to his dick. He moaned as the warm cum splashed onto his stomach and chest. Cas fucked Dean through his orgasm before he pulled out and began to jerk himself off. Dean’s eyes widened at the sight and his cock twitched and a few more drops of cum dribbled out.
“Hey, sleeping beauty! Sit down and eat! Did you sleep well?” asked Mary as she poured orange juice into a glass for Dean and put it next to his plate.
The first thing he did when he got to his room was to look for his phone. He finally found it on his desk under the pile of clothes he had been wearing the day before. The messages app was still open when he unlocked the phone.
Once the soup was done, he dished it into to a bowl and took it into the living room. Castiel was slumped against the arm rest, blanket slipping down one of his shoulders.
“It doesn’t really matter any more, but I got a message last night from an unknown number saying he was sorry. But Cas came to the garage today and we worked things out.” When he noticed the look that Charlie was giving him after that, he quickly added, “Don’t give me that look! Please don’t make a big deal out of this!”
Dean let out a loud laugh and reached down, threading their fingers together and holding Cas’ hand in place, high on his thigh. He was grateful when Castiel just squeezed back and looked out the window with a smile on his face, because Dean wasn’t sure he trusted his resolve that much. He glanced over, looking at Castiel’s face illuminated by the other car’s headlights. Yeah, he wanted to do so much more to the man beside him than what the backseat would offer.
The next few pages were just old articles or photos; an article about John, an ex-marine, opening his own car dealership and photos of Sam's birthday parties. Dean really liked the photos from Sam's fourth birthday, the one with the circus theme. Sammy looked terrified of the clowns.
“Yes, Dean, the patient you were just in to see in two-oh-five. He's just got a lingering cough! Some codeine will help and he can get back to his life.”
Castiel nodded and gave her a big squeeze. “Well… would your dad have liked how you were just talking to your mom?”
“So close, Cas!” Dean gasped, slurring with the arousal pumping inside of him. “G’nna c’m on just your cock baby, sfat n hard, it’s fillin me up com’letely!”
“You’re right,” Claire said, pushing away from Cas and leaning against her mom. “He would’ve made me write you a
Thankfully Charlie wasn’t all that wet so, when Dean went upstairs to try to find some dry clothes for himself, Charlie put her slightly wet jacket and shoes near the radiator in the hall. When she joined Dean upstairs, Dean was almost fully dressed and was in the middle of putting a t-shirt on. He had already found a towel for Charlie to use to dry her hair and she accepted it with a smile.
and shut off the engine. He sat there staring at the Mexican flag fluttering in the wind. He'd been barely able to contain his excitement this morning. Now, he wasn't so sure. Maybe this wasn't a good idea after all.
Dean sighed heavily. “I’m sorry, too. I probably shouldn’t have been so quick to get mad. It’s just... I can’t help but care for my patients’ wellbeing. Even former ones.” He glanced over, giving Cas a small smile.
“Yeah, that.” That didn’t really answer Castiel’s question, but Dean figured they were kind of the same thing, so it didn’t really matter.
Dean tried not to let it get to him, but watching Sam live the rich and popular life was hard sometimes. Especially when money was tight at his home. John didn't make it any easier. As far as John was concerned, Dean didn't exist, and he only had one son to support.
On the bedside table next to him was a glass of water, a bottle of painkillers, and a note in his mother’s handwriting saying, “Shout, when you wake up!”
Before Sam could reply, Dean continued, “Anyway, I want you to play nice and officially meet my boyfriend, Castiel.” He glared at Sam, daring him to be an asshole about it. Thankfully, Sam seemed to take the hint and grinned kindly at Cas.
“I know, right? I tried getting Castiel to read it so I could have someone to talk about it with but he thought that some of the things that happens in it are ‘too wrong’ or something.”
“Bring it over here and I’ll put it together while you help us pick a board game,” said Lucas. As Ronald gathered everything to bring to his dad, Clarie excused herself to the bathroom. Lucas, with Michael’s help, ended up having to take the whole set apart to reassemble it correctly. It took a few tries, mostly because Gabriel had stolen the instructions and refused to give them back, but he managed to do it before a decision was made about what to play. Mostly because people kept suggesting games Castiel had gotten rid of when he moved.
Dean looked up from his phone when he could feel Charlie staring at him. If looks could kill, then Dean was sure he would be on his way to the great beyond right about now.
“Eileen was my fiancé, before I met Luc, obviously,” Sam supplied at Castiel’s expression. “She was… she meant everything to me.”
Dean looked over the room. It was one giant mess.  There were all kind of balls everywhere, jumping ropes tangled together here and there, and the weights were all on the floor on the opposite side of the room from where they were supposed to be. John had most likely been planning for a while, knowing the detention would be starting today and he could force Dean to clean up. He must have let all his classes be as messy as they wanted.
The doorbell rang at exactly seven, and if Dean almost fell over his own two feet to get to the door, then there was nobody around to prove that. Except for his mom, but she didn’t count. Trying to not look too excited, Dean stopped and took a deep breath before opening the door.
“Its only been a few weeks since Thanksgiving,” Cas replied, giving a small laugh before turning his head and kissing Amelia’s cheek. “I missed you guys, too.”
“Charlie, his best friend is Sam Winchester and he’s related to Lucifer. How can he be someone Dean wants to date? Besides, we don’t even know if this guy is gay or not!” Jo was all for Dean being happy, she just didn’t want to risk Dean getting hurt in the progress.
“I don’t know how you can drink it like that.” Castiel watched Dean take a deep sip as he moved to the fridge for a carton of milk. He poured a healthy amount into his mug, then went for a mason jar of honey. When he was finished preparing his own mug, he took a seat beside Dean.
Cas.” He paused, but didn’t wait for an answer. “I knew it, you are a faggot! Growing up without a real man around messed you up more than I thought. With a mom like yours, I’m not surprised,” Sam scoffed, glaring down at Dean and shaking his head, “I mean she can’t even get a guy to stay! You should--”
“Somehow I think calling us the Scooby gang is going to help in the long run,” said Jo. “Let me just get some of my knives and--”
After Castiel had left, Dean’s friends didn’t try to get him to talk about what had happened. They knew that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. They all knew that Dean was he kind of person that needed time to work through his feelings before he was ready to talk about them. All they did was make sure that when he was ready, he knew they would be there for him. That what probably the thing Dean love most about his friends, they all knew what each other needed when something came up.
“Stay,” Dean whispered as he reached over and threading his fingers with Castiel’s. “Stay the night.”
“Ah, I see.” Castiel looked up at his doctor, and found himself mesmerised by those stunning green eyes. He was completely unable to look away, and from the look of it, Dean was having the same problem.
“Spy on teenagers? Ohh I can teach you so much more than just that.” With that, Frank Devereaux went back to teaching what he had planned for the day and forgot all about Castiel, at least for the time being.
Dean had to admit that her cutting them made eating a lot easier. “Thanks, Mom,” he said in between bites.
Cas snorted and crossed the kitchen, backing Dean up against the counter and kissing him quiet. “It’s just Amelia and Claire, Dean. This isn’t some formal to do, it’s going to be fun! If you don’t want-”
Sam didn’t care about Dean either, so why was he so worried all of the sudden.  Maybe it was because both Charlie and Castiel would be devastated if something happened to Dean? Then, in turn, they would’ve blamed him. Yeah, that must be it. No way was he worried about Dean.
“Please give us a couple of hours, Sam.” Cas said through gritted teeth, sounding all composed still, and never once stopping his thrusts inside Dean.
By the time Dean drank his coffee, the eggs and potatoes were done, so Dean piled them onto a plate and poured a cup of coffee, placing everything on a tray to take up to Cas.
Dean could feel the gaze of both Sam and John on the back of his head as he walked away and for a moment, he wondered if Sam knew that Dean had picked the list because he’d seen that was what Sam had wanted… No matter who was closer to him, they both knew John’s idea of what made a ‘strong, successful son’ and being in a club that wasn’t focused on some type of sport? Was not it. Dean also gave Sam an out-- he could blame Dean Winchester, the bad son, for switching his name over. John couldn’t possibly get mad at Sam for that.
They seemed to be coming closer to where Dean was propped against the tree. If Dean wanted any chance of getting help, he needed them to find him. Soon, before he passed out again.
“It doesn’t matter. Let’s just go!” said someone, it might have been Alistair, but at this point Dean couldn’t tell.
When the bus pulled to a stop at the bus stop closest to Bobby’s Salvage yard, it was still fifteen minutes before he was supposed to show up. He made his way there anyway since he had had a key to the place for years, even before he started working there. When he was younger and his mom had to work late, he had gone to Bobby’s after school. It had become almost like a second home for him. Of course, that was before his mom opened up her own coffee shop and he could hang out there if he wanted. As per usual, he stopped to get the mail for Bobby since Bobby didn’t see the point of walking all the way to get it when Dean was walking past it anyway. Dean sighed when he opened the mailbox and saw the stack of envelopes with red letters on them. For the last few weeks they had been a regular sight for him. He knew Bobby had been struggling lately and it only seemed to be getting worse and of course, it was all thanks to John Winchester. John had opened up his own workshop a few months earlier in the middle of the town and he could offer people deals that Bobby couldn’t afford to offer. The only reason Bobby was still in business was because he had his loyal customers, and the people that didn’t want to do business with John.
Dean remembered laughing so hard that tears streamed down his cheeks, as his mom called Bobby a ‘sport crazy idiot’ with a laugh.
“So it is,” Castiel hummed as he closed his eyes, feeling the cold flakes shower his face. He gasped in shock as he felt a warm hand grip his cheek and guide his face forward. Castiel opened his eyes and was met with a radiant smile. “Hello, Dean.”
“Why don’t you let me ask the questions here,” Principal Crowley said with his trademark smirk, “now where were you?”
Dean blinked hard, staring down at the page. If anything, it only made him more confused… It looked like… it couldn’t be. Whoever wrote this wanted it to look like John’s journal, but that didn’t make any sense. Whoever wrote this cared about Dean and his mom, so it couldn't be John!
Since Sam had gone home to take care of a few things before joining them for dinner later that night, his seat was free for Anna to take. “So have you decided what game we’ll play this year?” Narrowing her eyes, she added, “We are not playing monopoly again, Gabriel,” before he could even finish opening his mouth.
Dean sat on the other end of the couch and watched as Castiel blew gently on a spoonful before putting it in his mouth. Thoughts of the man’s lips on him creeped into his mind and he had to mentally scold himself.
For one thing, I never had to deal with any serious injuries a side from one broken arm when I was too young to remember. Another reason is that the medical system works a lot differently in the USA then it dose in Iceland or Sweden (at least as far as I know.)
“No, I wouldn’t,” he answered honestly, reaching for Dean. He didn’t need to be told twice. Dean scrambled up to his knees; he would’ve been embarrassed with how desperate he seemed, but Cas knew, he knew exactly what he did to him. He blanketed himself over Cas’ body, knees on either side of Cas’ hips, and claimed Cas’ mouth with his own, taking back control.
It was the third year they’d turned the far corner of the parking lot into a tree lot, selling Christmas trees, wreaths, and hot beverages. Dean joked that at this rate it was time they took sock in Swiss Miss from the amount of cocoa they sold. But he also had to admit that the warm, chocolatey treat was the perfect midday pick me up.
Dean needed to figure out how he was going to get out of this. Maybe someone saw them grab him and would call the police. But given how small the town was, no one would be stupid enough to kidnap someone without making sure what no one saw it.
Of course, even though the three of them were running faster than Dean knew some of the boys in the class could run, it wasn’t good enough for John. Every time they finished a lap, John would tell them to run faster, that his ‘grandmother could run faster than that’.
Dean opened his mouth, but Sam continued. “Their parents are still married, too, so I doubt that’s an option. They do have a cousin, Anna, perhaps? But she’s up in New York…”
“But they’re all there for you, you know, and any one of your cousins or aunts and uncles would be willing to talk to you about him, if you wanted. I didn’t have as many people around me as you do. My parents were both only children, Sam was too young to even remember her, and my dad-- my dad missed her too much to talk about her,” said Dean.
Sam winks at him and gestures behind him. There, in line, are Cas' and Dean's family and friends. Like Sam, they're all holding signs and tulips. "Sam? What's going on?"
“Hi, Dean. How are you? I’ve hardly seen you since Saturday,” said Castiel with what Dean would have described as a disappointed look on his face.
“Mary called me. Don’t worry she will be here soon,” said Bobby without taking his eyes off of Dean. “And Johnny, you better be gone when she gets here. You have done nothing to earn the right to be here. Now leave before I have them throw you out.”
“You don’t think Uncle Cas wants you here?” Claire asked, cocking her head in the same manner Castiel does.
“Oh, shut up and get lost, both of you!” Dean heard Sam say as the bell rang above him. A few minutes later, Dean turned to leave and noticed his brother leaning against a locker a little away from his.
A less talented driver might’ve run them right off the road, but Dean managed to keep his hands on the wheel and stay focused as Cas' hand inched up and up. He took the very next exit toward home.
Castiel gave a small laugh, cupping Dean’s cheek and lifting his head to kiss him softly before placing a hand against his chest.  “Lay back and enjoy,” Castiel cooed as he playfully pushed Dean back.
“Yeah, I know. So what do you wanna do for the next hour or so? We have our schoolbags, so we could finish our homew-- I just got an idea how we can fool the girls,” said Castiel before whispering his idea to Dean.
“Sir, all your son has been able to tell us is that he was abducted and attacked by a group of boys. Now if you could just come with--”
“It’s weird that Uriel got in the class,” Benny whispered, leaning over as silence filled the gym and Coach cleared his throat, adjusting the paper he was reading from. “There are only two spots left now. Coach has to be crazy not to give you one, brother. But as much as I hate to say it? Both Gordon and Sam are ten times better than Uriel... so why is he on he list?” Dean shrugged, not having time to answer as the Coach read out the last names. “Alright, lastly we have Gordon Walker and Dean Winchester."
“As for who is in this club, aside from me, we have Charlie and Jo, both their fathers passed away when they were younger. We are still debating on if that counts as ‘Daddy Issues’ or just absent fathers. Then we have Benny. He has a strange relationship with his
Dean grinned and spread his legs further, making a show of bending over. "I suppose I could be persuaded." He said.
“I’m so sorry! Dean said it was okay,” said Castiel trying to hold a straight face even though Dean was laughing hysterically on the bed next to him. “Of course you don’t want us eating yogurt on your bed.”
“Something funny, you three?” asked John, storming over to the benches as he got in their faces. For some reason he didn’t seem to notice Lucifer fooling around at the same time. “Ten laps around the gym. Now!”
“My head and arm hurt a little,” Dean answered honestly, squirming a little bit against the mattress to take stock of how he felt. “But its nothing some painkillers won’t take care of,” said Dean eyeing the medicine bottle.
“I wish I could stay but I have to go meet my brother downtown. Oh and to answer your earlier question on why I didn’t go to John’s place, Sam is mad at me right now so I didn’t want to go there just yet. I was going to wait but Gabriel kept on telling me to come he-- I’m starting to think he might have known you worked here.”
Castiel smiled as the waitress set down a large slice of peppermint pie between them before topping off their coffees with a bright smile. Dean had been right about the little diner having the best burgers. The onion rings had been amazing, too, but the company was what Castiel had found himself to be enjoying the most. Dean was witty, charming, and had made Castiel laugh more this evening than he had in quite some time. Hell, he hadn’t laughed this freely since Jimmy was alive.
Jo rolled her eyes at him. “I'd swear your brain was working at half mast today. How did you not realize who he was?”
“Well,” Dean grinned up at him ferally, “I promised I would answer the question you asked me on our first date, on our second one.”
hated it there, Mom,” Dean argued, placing his fork down on the side of his plate. This wasn’t the first time this had come up and Dean was sure it wouldn’t be the last. “Plus, your shop and all our friends are here. We can’t just leave.”
Snagging the satchel from the passenger seat and shutting off the engine, he steels his nerves and walks up the steps to the front door, trying desperately hard not to do anything rude like peek in the windows just in case Cas is in there lounging about. Half naked. Oh God. He draws in a deep breath until his lungs burn, lets it out - then knocks.
Sam had just smiled and told him to have faith. Then, they’d sold out of their entire inventory by the end of the week.
“I’ve been better. I just need a little time to wrap my head around everything. Like the fact that John likes to take his kids and their friends on huge family vacations everywhere. Oh! Or that my friend is the son of the famous writer that wrote the Supernatural books. Why didn’t you mention that?” asked Dean and thankfully Castiel let him change the subject even though he knew what Dean was trying to do.
Michael, Lucas, and Gabriel were sitting out on the deck, bundled up in their jackets with warm, mulled cider as Gavin and Ronald played in the snow. Anna and Lilly, Michael's wife, were putting down Sasha and Leigha for bed.
“I already told you, we leave him here,” said Alistair, and yep, that was definitely Alistair. Someone yanked his feet towards them and Dean could feel the rope there loosen. Not all the way, but enough that Dean would be able to get himself free.
Now that the two teams were ready, each captain walked over to their side of the gym and started giving out positions for everyone. Benny took his time going over to his end and made it clear he wasn’t all that happy with having to be ‘alone’ on the other team. “Think anyone will notice if we just stand in one corner the whole time?”
Dean gasped, forcing the pain out of his mind as he started struggling to get free. He managed to get one arm free by jamming his elbow back, hitting one of them with a sickening crunch. If the muffled curses behind him were any indication, he had gotten one of them. His victory was short lived as hands managed to grip his, forcing them far enough behind his back that it hurt. Badly. The panic didn’t have time to set in until he was pushed into a car. His hands and feet were quickly tied up and he felt the car take off.
Everything is quiet for a second as both brothers stare at each other, and then Sam laughs. He laughs really hard, and the more he laughs, the more annoyed Dean looks, which just sets him off again. When he’s finally able to control himself, he rubs his temples with this stupid grin plastered on.
“Is that you?” Snatching the photo frame up before Cas got a chance to take it, Dean tried to wrap his mind around what he was seeing. “What is that?” Whatever it was, young Cas looked adorable covered in it, with Luc laughing his ass of next to him.
Pushing himself off the wall, he stepped closer towards Cas, smiling at him as he leaned in to kiss him. Just as their lips brushed against each other, Dean heard a voice behind him that made his blood run cold.
“That does not look comfortable! Can guys really do that?” asked Ash looking at the page Dean was on, upside down from where he was sitting. The position in question didn’t look
“I see you got the Impala. If you want,” Castiel offered with a smirk, already knowing what the answer would be, “we can take mine instead.”
Dean nodded and stepped away from the tree, giving it a once over himself. “Perfect,” he agreed, hiding a yawn with his elbow and looking sheepishly over at Cas. “Sorry,” he said quickly, “Sam has me up at the ass crack of dawn lately.”
When he got to the kitchen he was greeted with his favorite breakfast: pancakes with a side of bacon. A sure sign that his mother was trying to make him feel better. Not that his mother never did anything like this without a reason, but normally she wouldn’t have time for it on Saturday mornings. After all, she had to go open up the store before Dean had to go to work.
“Because I know how to fix your computer?” Ash half asked only to get a “You mean, you know how to use it, unlike Benny,” from Dean.
"Okaaaaay." He settles his hat back on. He glances over his shoulder at Ash—who makes a shooing motion. Ash's behavior is weird, but then again weird behavior is a primary aspect of Ash's personality, so Cas, as usual, ignores it.
“I know! I shouldn’t have done that. I just— I saw him looking at the literature sheet and he almost signed up for it! The only reason he didn’t was that John called him. John already messed up my life, I didn’t want him to…” Dean trailed off when he noticed the sad look his mom was sending him.
“I think you’ve dealt with enough hate for a while. That can wait until after Christmas,” said Mary, giving him a small smile. “Or at the very least, make sure Bobby brings his shotgun over before you do it.”
“Well,” Castiel drawled out as he looked over his shoulder with a wicked glint in his eyes, “the backseat looks awfully comfy, and I’m not picky.”
“Get him up!” ordered Alistair and Dean felt a hand grip his bound hands to lift him up. Only, it didn’t go as planned. Or maybe it did... All Dean knew was that his arm was not supposed to bend like that.
As soon as Jo said that, she realized that Dean wasn't supposed to know that Castiel might show up. They were so used to movie nights that everyone had their own spot in all of their houses. Dean would definitely question the move… And what do you know.
Coffee Dean could do, and truth be told it would probably calm his nerves - he hadn’t had a panic attack like that in years, not since the accident with Eileen. Coffee was safe, and he already knew Cas’ Keurig made coffee fool proof, so at least he wouldn’t fuck that up, too.
“Here.” Balthazar hands him a pink Post-It with some barely-legible scribbling on it. “And come to think of it, you would take off a few hours early today. Compassionate leave, we’ll call it, since your aunt is downstairs in the emergency room.”
“Or we could do it on her bed?” suggested Cas as he walked over to Charlie’s bed. To say that Dean was at a loss for words was an understatement. His innocent little angel wasn’t so innocent after all.
“Come on, join me in the shower” he said and without waiting for an answer, pulled Castiel towards the shower.
In spite of his nerves, Dean smiles back, and he knows it’s that wide smile that shows his teeth and wrinkles up the bridge of his nose. The one he reserves for certain people; only someone special can make him smile like this.
“Guys, there is enough for everybody! Didn’t you need to leave?” asked Castiel with laughter in his voice as he put the last piece on a plate for Charlie.
Looking over the edge of the bed, Dean saw his mother curled up on an air mattress. She didn’t look like she’d gotten a wink of sleep. Ignoring his mom’s question, he asked, “Why are you on the floor? There’s plenty of space on the bed.”
I just want to say "Huge thanks to lotrspnfangirl for helping me and making my stories great!" and all leftover mistakes are mine.
“I want to see my son right now!” It was no mistaking John’s voice even though it sounded a lot more worried then Cas was used to and it came all the way from the other side of the hospital wing.
“I wish I had had the chance to meet him,” Dean said. “Sounds like he was a really good guy. Especially if he raised such an awesome kid.”
“No,” Castiel shook his head, reaching up to touch the side of Dean’s face and lead him into a kiss, “it’s okay. I would rather have him here than at Ruby’s house. I don’t trust that woman.”
Looking at the power display going on between his brother and boyfriend, Sam turned to Cas. “Do I even want to know?”
The scene that greeted them didn’t really surprise them but was shocking all the same. There Dean was sitting, shirtless, on her bed with something white leaking down from his mouth and Castiel in the middle of trying to clean it up with his fingers.
“Then you must have been something special because she usually doesn't remember what people order the moment they are out the door unless they are regulars. Most of the time she doesn't even remember what I had. She just knows that I most often have the pie if I can.”
"God, this is seriously the best French toast I've ever had," Sam said around a mouthful, earning himself a beaming smile from Gabriel.
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “You can get the typical bulbs at basically any store this time of year, but…” Dean leaned forward, stopping a few inches from Castiel’s ear to whisper, “Between you and me? Homemade ornaments are the best.”
“Sixty-seven,” Dean answered, glancing over to the side before looking back to the road. “I restored her with my Dad when I was a teen. She’d been in a pretty bad wreck, you could barely recognize that it was a four door from the frame damage.”
“Yeah, that’s gonna happen, right after we find the solution to world hunger,” said Dean, and he meant every word of it. It wasn’t that he didn’t
“And you remembered all of those details? That’s really impressive,” Castiel said in awe, “I mean there are few mistakes but most of it is correct.”
Dean let his head back to let it hang in mid-air. Cas took the opportunity to be what it was and leaned ahead, which unfortunately slowed down his pace, to suck a bruise onto Dean’s neck. He bit and nibbled at the skin before licking the abused spot and dropping a soft kiss there. The action was so tender, it made Dean’s heart ache for a relationship with this sex god of a man. Dean didn’t have any more time to think about that because Cas immediately leaned back and resumed his earlier speed, fucking Dean hard and fast.
Suddenly, Castiel cracked a smile and chuckled loudly as the exasperated look on Dean’s face. “Dean, I’m just kidding! I live in the same house as Gabriel. He lives for some of this stuff, though he seems to favor the villain most of the time, so I know more about them then the “good” guy. I know what you’re talking about, don’t worry.”
Later that evening, Bobby, who had been working the whole day, showed up and placed a cap with # 1 on the front panel, on Dean’s head and demanded to see the tape of today’s match.
Dean nodded and cleared his throat, kicking his boot against the pavement again. “Well,” he said slowly, wondering why the hell he felt so nervous, “we close the shop down around six, though we stay until seven to clean up, finish up paperwork, and restock the trees…” Dean trailed off, reaching up to scratch the back of his neck. “If you wanted, you could come back, and we could look for a tree then. You could bring your car, or I could put the tree on mine. We could get a bite to eat… if you wanted.”
Putting his shoes of the rack, Dean walked up to Castiel, put his hands around him to pull him into a kiss. “Nothing I couldn’t handle.”
To get Dean a boyfriend, Castiel has to see how lovable Dean is, so Dean must be in a good mood. If Dean is thinking about Sam or John, he’s nowhere near happy-go-lucky.
Sam had texted him that morning to tell him Luc had agreed to moving in with him. So how would the guy take it if his boyfriend’s older brother just barged into his new home? Dean stood at the door, staring at it as he debated. Did he knock? Did he go inside? Did he --
But Sam was sick of being the mechanic’s kid, of only being recognized by their grease-stained jeans and coveralls, and wanted to be a
Castiel gave Mary his best smile and said, “Oh, no worries, I completely understand. In fact, I was thinking I needed to teach him a lesson and what better way than to have him watch me eat pie when he doesn’t get any?”
“Cas,” he all but whined, looking frantically over his shoulder and scowling at the look his boyfriend gave him, “you just don’t understand. My crust is
Amelia chuckled and nodded her head, taking a few steps forward with her hand out to shake Dean’s. “It’s nice to meet you, Dean.”
“Why are you so late? I was starting to think you were going to leave me to die of boredom all alone,” said Charlie dramatically as Dean drew his stool out from under the table.
Dean smiled back, his stomach flipping at Castiel's genuine concern. “A little bit, yes. But if you want to, we can exchange Dads. I’m sure Sam would much rather have you as a brother then me…” Dean gave a small shrug and tried to brush off the pain in his voice by smirking and adding, “But I’m keeping my last name!”
“I‘ll be down in three minutes,” said Dean as he face-planted in the pillow Cas had left behind in order to rest his eyes a little longer.
“Well then.” Jo raises an eyebrow archly at him and Dean stares back, foggy-minded. He was so prepared to see Castiel and speak to him so finding himself in this situation has thrown him totally. He can feel a flush creeping up his neck, similar to the one staining the elderly man’s cheeks. “Doctor Winchester? Close the door, please. I don’t care which side of it you’re on, but I’m sure Mr Graham would like some privacy right now.”
Dean Winchester was a normal 16-year-old boy. He lived in a small town with his mom, Mary, in a small apartment over her cafe shop. Well, cafe slash bookstore, if he were to be specific. There were books everywhere in the shop, so many that Dean was sure his mom owned more than the school's library. Not that Dean had ever
“Shit. I mean, sorry. I’ll just, um, go. Good luck with,” He gestures vaguely at the scene in front of him then, as Jo glares daggers at him, backs out of the room and closes the door, turning to sag against it and massage his temples. “Shit. Get it together, Winchester.”
‘Shit,’ thought Dean. With everything going on, he’d totally forgot that he promised Castiel as he left the party to explain why he’d taken off. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I forgot. I just had to get out of there.”
Once the adults were finished eating, Dean stayed with Castiel and Anna to clean up the table and load the dishwasher. Lucas made a fresh pot of coffee and carried it into the living room to refill everyone's cups and Dean laughed as he heard his brother trying to discourage Gabriel from urging the kids to start picking out the biggest presents.
“Screw this!” With that, Dean stood up and told his friend that he was leaving. Unfortunately, John noticed him when he was just about to reach the door.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean muttered, turning and moving out of Castiel’s kitchen, pulling his scrub top off as he walked down the hallway. Castiel smiled as he watched Dean throw the dirty laundry into the hamper in Castiel’s room, something warm swirling through his stomach at the domestic act.
Dean walked them backwards, pulling Castiel against him and sealing their lips together as soon as his knees hit the end of the bed. “So,” Dean whispered, hot against Castiel’s mouth, “this is the bedroom, it's the perfect first stop for the tour.”
Sam trailed off and Dean knew what his brother was thinking, knew why he was seeking Dean’s approval. Because moving in Luc meant moving on from Eileen, it meant taking up the emptiness that was still surrounding Sam, in one way or another, and filling up the space that used to be their home.
Hopefully the slight liberties I took with regards to the temperature within the house isn't too much of a stretch for you to imagine.
When it looked like Sam was about to object, Castiel quickly said, “Sam, just go. Gabriel can you go with him please?” Dean hadn’t even noticed everyone else. Gabriel and all of his friends, except Ash who could sleep through anything, were standing on the other side of the door with worried expressions on their faces.  He wasn’t all that surprised that they had shown up after Cas yelled at Sam...
“Of course! I couldn’t let my bestie go home to wall alone, now could I? What kind of Sam would I be.”
“Cas,” Dean breathed out against his boyfriend’s lips as the other man claimed him again, their bodies completely flush, chest to chest, hips to hip. Cas’ cock was thick and hot, digging almost painfully against the jut of Dean’s hip. Dean was sure he’d never wanted anyone so badly before in his life. He opened his mouth to say so, just as Cas pressed his lips to the shell of Dean’s ear.
can get more comfortable," answered Jo, with emphasis on everyone. As smart as Ash could be, he had the tendency to not think things through before saying them aloud. "Now, everyone, sit your ass down and let's watch the movie."
“I really don’t want to leave,” Cas whispered, pressing his lips to the top of Dean’s head. “I wish I could strip back down and crawl underneath the covers with you again.”
“Hmmm…” Balthazar said as he checked Castiel’s pulse. “You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you? After all, I’m sure you would have greatly preferred that the delectable Doctor Winchester attend you this morning, rather than me.”
There was a soft knock on their bedroom door, to which Castiel called out permission to enter, and Sam walked through the door, leaning back against it with what Dean assumed was a similar expression to what he wore. Sam's hair was sticking up in all directions, a small spot of drool was dried at the corner of his mouth, and Dean absent mindedly rubbed at his own face - just inc case.
They ate their dessert and talked a little about work before changing the subject to Ryan and their brothers. They bounced ideas back and forth about what they were going to do for home improvements over the summer. They argued over Castiel’s choice of car – “It’s a Prius, dude!” “Its got great gas mileage, Dean”.
“Oh… Um… well… No need to be embarrassed.” Castiel smiled as a flush crept across his cheeks. He took the wrapper from Dean and balled it up tossing it in the trashcan to join the expired condom.“It’s been about the same since I… you know, too.”
They moved through the living room, a Christmas tree set up and shining colorfully in the corner, and casting the modest set up in purple, blue, and green hues. They stumbled together down the darkened hallway, Kissing and groping each other the entire way. Once Dean reached the door he fumbled behind his back grasping the knob, both of them tumbling inside the moment he got the door open.
“Dean, can you help me in the kitchen for a moment?” asked Jo before walking into the kitchen without giving him time to answer.
AN: Update-ed chapter! Huge thanks to lotrspnfangirl for looking this over and making this better. All mistakes are still mine.
“Well, not that the interruption is gone,” Cas said, panting, “How about you show me how good you look when you cum?” and thrust harder than he thought was possible into Dean.
“Dean,” Cas tried, reaching forward and pulling Dean’s arm back. “I’m sure it’s going to taste delicious. We’re going to Sam’s house, not a five-star restaurant.”
“Your secret is safe with me,” Castiel assured as he took a step closer to the taller tree and ran his fingers across the needles. “Jimmy loved the taller trees too,” he whispered, “and like your brother, he went all out at Christmas. All of us always went to his house.”
Castiel took a deep breath and let it out slowly before he continued, “The first year after he passed, none of us did anything. It was too painful but afterwards it just felt… wrong, like we had let him down. So, after that we decided to swap years between us all, one of us would host Thanksgiving and Christmas, like Jimmy used to do.” Castiel sniffed as he gave Dean a small smile. “Thanksgiving was… interesting, to say the least. But no one left with food poisoning and it was nice to have everyone at my house. But, Christmas is… different. It feels more important and with this being my first year…” Castiel swallowed hard, “I hope I can make him proud.”
Thanks to everyone that has stuck around and left kudos or comments, it's always fun to see what you guys think.
“You know, it’s pretty dark out there…” Dean trailed off, looking up to meet Cas’ eyes. “Walk me to my car?”
Dean had been walking around the house for a while, trying to pick out Castiel or Charlie from the crowd, when he heard Alastair say, “Look, Losechester actually decided to show up!”
"I don't suppose I could convince you to look for a pair in the bottom drawer, could I?" Cas asked. Dean turned around to see Cas' eyes trained firmly on his ass, the heat evident in them.
At a particularly hard thrust to his prostate, Dean groaned loudly, spurring Sam into motion as he stumbled on his huge moose feet in a hurry to get out. Sam covered his ears and shouted something on the lines of ‘LALALA I can’t hear you LALALA’ until he left the house.
. Had he just really stupidly ranted at his Medical Director? His medical career was over before it truly began. Tipping his head back, he looked up at the morning sky and sighed loudly. Kicking at an imaginary rock with the toe of his shoe, he made his way back inside. He glanced around, looking for Cas, disappointed when he didn’t see him.
“Dean,” Castiel waited until Dean looked up so he could look him in the eyes before continuing, “I like you too, but…” The pause that followed wasn’t all that long, but it felt like time had stopped for Dean, especially since the happy look that had been on Castiel’s face earlier had now been replaced with a far more serious one.
“Fell off a ladder trying to fix the damn sign above the door. If the damn thing hadn’t been so wobbly…”
“He got them both out on the pavement before the ambulance arrived. He must have dragged her out through the drivers side, I don’t know. He wouldn’t stop CPR until they physically dragged him away, and he… he just…”
“Hey, sweetie! How was your day?” asked Mary as she put the tray down and started making two cups of hot chocolate. She pulled out two plates and served up a slice of blueberry pie on one plate and a chocolate cake piece on the other.
He looked so lost and small that Dean couldn’t stand it any more. He knelt in front of Cas’ chair, enveloping him in a warm, sweet hug. Cupping Castiel’s cheek in one hand, Dean kissed him gently.
He didn’t think any of them believed a word of what he was saying, so it didn’t surprise him all that much when Benny said, “No man, I have no interest in being your third wheel.”
Sam sighed as he ran a hand back through his hair. “But, Dean made an effort to curb that first instinct. He, uh… I shouldn’t really be telling you this,” Sam paused, meeting Castiel’s eyes for a moment. “If you tell him, I’ll have to kill you before he kills me.”
Once Dean turned around and saw Cas watching him, he tensed slightly before bowing his head to read the chart in his hands. Cas swallowed his disappointment at the intentional slight. He took a deep breath and stepped closer towards him, seeing Dean’s jaw muscles tightening each step Cas took.
“Sam is not going to be happy we did this without him,” came a voice Dean thought he recognized as Alistair’s.
On the weekend, he worked at his uncle Bobby's Salvage yard. He would help him in the garage, fixing up cars that came in, and in his spare time he worked on his baby. His baby was a ‘67 Chevy Impala that he found in the back of the yard one day. It was love at first sight and she became his pride and joy.
From what Castiel had told him, Sam was good for Lucifer too. Growing up, Lucifer had always felt the pressure from their father to be perfect, to get into the best schools and uphold the family image. He was so obsessed with it that Castiel feared he would work himself into an early grave. Luc opened his own club, which went against their father's wishes, while still working at a top law agency, relaxing only in the early hours of the night, jumping from one one night stand to the next.
"No." Cas' eyes snapped open and he covered Dean's hands with his own. "I was really looking forward to this."
“Can you really blame me?” Dean asked softly, picking at a small hole in his jeans. “You know me, Charlie. You know how I feel about Sam. I just-- I saw you with him and I just… I snapped. I didn’t know how to deal with it.”
John talked the entire time while they ran the laps. Dean didn’t catch everything John said, but at times, he couldn’t help but think that John was talking about him and his friends. Every now and then the whole class would start watching them and start laughing. Thankfully, Dean quickly found a way to distract himself by counting how often his friends told him to ‘let it go’ or something along those lines.
In the past, Balthazar had helped Cas arrange for needed supplies after a major accident nearly depleted their own supply. Cas felt slightly embarrassed for thinking the worst of his friend. “I appreciate the offer, but I believe we have everything covered.”
“Well?” Castiel rasped, the deep baritone of his voice and the way his breath ghosted over his ear caused Dean to shiver. The hand still on Dean’s thigh moved higher and squeezed tighter.
Reluctantly, Castiel reached for his phone on the nightstand and pushed the button, the LED screen lighting up and showing it was only a little after 11 am. So, almost three hours of sleep, then.
Dean makes a face in spite of himself. That’s one bullet he’s pretty glad he’s dodged today. He backs away as Balthazar pushes off the desk and advances towards him.
As Dean, Castiel, and Jo were getting ready to head home for the night, Charlie pulled Dean to the side and asked, “Does Sam know about the two of you? Because he’s not gonna like it.”
Castiel nodded but it didn’t look very convincing. Dean rubbed his thumb across Castiel’s lower lip, kissed it, then his cheek, his temple. He could feel the tension slowly leaving his boyfriend’s body.
“At the risk of sounding like my niece on every single car ride we’ve been on together, I have to ask…” he side-eyed Dean with a sheepish grin, “are we there yet?”
“Let’s start with you, Mr. Winchester,” said Crowley, giving a pointed look to Sam. “Follow me. The rest of you, sit down and behave yourselves.”
“I swear, this is the stupidest thing you’ve ever done!” Dean heard when the voices were close enough to be clear. He knew he should’ve been able to recognize who the voice belonged to, though he didn’t remember hearing it so irritated before, but his head was all foggy. “Who in their right mind drives to the middle of nowhere because they got a message from an
Eileen’s accident quickly came to mind. He barely remembered the moment of impact or the trip to the hospital, but he remembered the doctors who worked on him. They were how he hoped to be as a doctor, although he knew, in reality, Cas was right as well. He was surprised as his anger flared. “Yeah? Well, we can’t all be like you, Cas. Not everyone is able to turn off their emotions on a dime, okay?” he snapped, standing up and walking away.
“I’m glad he did, so don’t be too mad at them, they were only trying to be friendly,” said Castiel as he looked at his watch before slowly starting to walk backwards towards the door. “I’m sorry, I really need to go if I want to catch the bus.”
Dean got lost in the sensations, moaning and groaning, and before he knew it, Cas was three fingers deep, brushing his prostate relentlessly, and teasing him like they had all the time in the world. (The last thought sent pleasing shivers down Dean’s spine which he decided to ignore for the time being)
“No one to thank but me.” Dean’s levels of sass seemed to be rising by the second. Castiel found this quite amusing, especially considering how flustered the man had been yesterday.
“Yeah, okay, Dean... You're the doctor, here. If you want to keep your doctor for another day of observation, you do that.” She rolled her eyes, leaning over to place her hand on the chart Dean was looking at. “Also, Sam called again looking for you.”
Dean chewed on his bottom lip before his tongue darted out to wet it. “So what you’re saying is you think I’m pretty?”
As Dean walked up to the door to their apartment he couldn’t help wondering what was waiting for him behind it. If he was lucky, he would find a note on the table next to the door that would say, “Left a plate for you in the fridge. Good night, honey!” It would mean that his mom would already be in bed and he could put off talking to her for few more hours. But, as Dean’s luck would have it, he had just opened the door when he heard his mom’s cheerful voice, “Hey, honey! I left some lasagna in the fridge for you!”
Cas cocked his head to the side and reached out. He ran his hand up the inside of Dean's thigh. "How about we head back to your place and fuck like bunnies until we can't stand?"
A high-pitched giggle rang up from downstairs, followed by a harsh hiss of ‘shush’ and a low chuckle that gave Dean away. The child in being shushed knew his uncle well and let out another squeal of laughter before Castiel heard Dean ushering him away from the stairs.
Dean was in such a great mood the rest of the week that not even John’s long, dreadful detentions could bring him down. Hell, even Sam and his friends seemed to have forgotten about him for the time being. Even so, as far as he was concerned, the weekend couldn’t come fast enough.
“Yeah! Not that that is his real name, but yeah,” confirmed Dean. “Please don’t make a big deal out of this next time you see Cas.”
