the frown on Steve's lips, the crease of the brow that meets in the middle in that look of concern that Steve seems to possess that could possibly bring a dead puppy back to life.
"Now this is a man that truly loves me! I could kiss you Happy but I don't think you swing that way."
"It isn't Christmas, you're not allowed to roast me!"Clint is squawking, his entire face thunderous in anger and mouth full of chewed up bacon and eggs, something that makes Bruce's face scrunch up at the disgusting display of his own delicious looking food.
mean that he is good with people. There's a reason why Tony has shaved down the number of people that he interacts with on a daily basis to 3 people ( and even at that, apparently Butterfingers doesn't even count as people because
"They're talking so fast I don't even think they're speaking English anymore. It's like watching Phil talk about taxes."Thor comments, eyes going to the pair on the sofa as he grabs a remote control to set up the PlayStation for whoever is playing.
"If it's that much off damn problem I'll buy you a fucking cow, just please shut up before we get kicked out."Tony has his name on enough places were he has been kicked out and barred from, he would rather not have it in a supermarket as well. Let's not forget to mention that the press would kick up a fuss and Pepper would be on the next jet over to beat Tony's ass even if he wasn't the problem.
“I’ll go first, and this is… extremely integral to our success as a relationship. Do you like Star Wars? And if you do, please tell me all about your salty feels over the prequels.”
Steve was smiling as the claw poked his cheek. “Then he decided he really liked my face.” Tapping to enter the camera gallery he picked up a picture of him nose booping the claw. “You have no idea how long it took me to get that picture.” He informed Tony, a grin still dominating his features as he pulled up a very posed picture of Dummy by himself, center frame.
Tony followed, after a second, and laid down on his stomach on Steve, pressing his cheek to his chest and then snaking arms around his waist. “This. I like this one.” He was shaking a little, but only because no one had ever tried like this. No one had ever put in the effort to even act as through they cared. Not like this. He wouldn’t even mind if he was murdered by Steve tonight.
Steve flushed crimson.  It had to be a sex story.  Who does that? When you first meet you ex’s new partner? Maybe Bucky was nervous or upset with him.  He didn’t know, he just wished a hole in the ground would swallow him, but Nat was laughing again.
Steve smiled over at Tony, his cute little half smile and bright eyes were all Steve needed to persuade him to drop the subject. “Sure.” He agreed effortlessly, dropping another chaste but warm kiss on Tony’s lips before exiting the car. He figured Tony wouldn’t be here unless it was Tony Stark friendly, so he relaxed a little, but still protectively guarded Tony as they walked in. He knew people could get grabby and obsessive - he’d seen it in the news. He also knew Tony was sensitive to being treated like a sideshow freak. Once they were inside and seated, Steve reached out to take Tony’s hands.
“How was your day?” He asked--to even think of saying I missed you to didn’t compute to him.  It was obvious how much he’d been pining for Tony, right?
Steve turned to look at Tony, properly look at him. He quickly assessed the situation to the best of his ability. “My last name is Rogers. My full name is Steven Grant Rogers. Let’s go to the backseat so I can give you a cuddle. We’ll call it time on the personal questions for now.” He smiled encouragingly over at Tony, “I’m not giving up on you tonight or any other night. I’m not asking you to trust that just yet though,” he unbuckled his belt, abandoning the food, fixated more on the fact that Tony needed him in that moment. Opening the passenger car door he moved to switch places, getting into the back seat, opening his arms.
“I’m setting him up as a butler,” he explained. The extra politeness was actually easier to set up than having him talk normally would be, so that worked out well too. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist and pulled him close as soon as the pen was set down. He’d show him the bots like he promised, but the eagerness was actually making him a little more wary, since it was so unusual for people to care like this. So a pause for a hug helped. “Let’s wait just a second, okay?”
Steve allowed Tony the freedom to touch his body.  He was feeling a little vulnerable after his disagreement with Bucky, but Tony seemed to know exactly what to do make him feel better.  He moaned a little as the palms of Tony’s hands rubbed the contours of his abdominal muscles.
Tony smiled back at the consideration and responded, “You’re my adorable hipster artist.  You should grow your hair out.  You’d be adorable with a man bun.  How would you feel if I just reached over and skipped songs that I find upsetting? Sometimes having a song interrupted unexpectedly can be unsettling, so I can have you change it or warn you or something if that would be better.” He actually wasn’t super affected by lyrics very often.  He didn’t have too much trouble discussing his trauma either, really, and it was normally visual or tactile triggers that got him, but it was nice to have the option to stop it if there was a problem.
Steve quickly sped up to fall into step with Tony. “Yes, I definitely will sign, I totally need more of this already,” Steve admitted eagerly. “God this probably comes off so nerdy, but I’m so fascinated.
Steve wasn’t that phased at the question he figured it would be coming.  He was expecting some story about high school maybe, or one of the times where they got stoned and he made an ass out of himself.  He was leaning against the counter as Bucky popped the cap of the beer and handed it to Tony as Nat filled a couple of cups with tea bags.
“Oh, okay, tough ones. Um. Okay, honestly?” He glanced over at Steve, then back at the road, glad he had a good excuse for not making eye contact. “Sex. If that’s all the person’s interested in, I’m not. And a person who’s rude to waiters or customer service or strangers or children or animals. Not cool with that. And, uh, not touching. Anyone who can’t do casual touch isn’t gonna work out for me. And unibrows. Not a fan.” He paused for a second, glancing over again, then turned it back at him. “How about you? And what do you like in a potential partner?”
After a few hours of procrastinating, Tony hops into the shower, scrubbing himself clean of the dreaded Hospital stench that seemed to have stained his skin. He washes from head to toe, rinse and repeat because he might not be happy about going to his dinner event but that doesn't mean he's going to show up looking like a slob. Tony Stark dresses to impress.
"Darling, you're never too busy for me. I'm too important to you."Tony smirks to himself, hopping up onto the workshop bench and swinging his legs off of the lift.
"-And will be will be arriving together, even though Clint would be late to his own funeral, Phil is extremely punctual. Natasha shows up whenever she likes and you might not even know that she's hear because she's crafty at making an entrance without actually making an entrance.
Rhodey; Tony's little angel. The guy was a saviour that pulled him out of ditches and held the bucket while Tony threw up until his stomach was turned inside out. Tony must've done something good in a past life to deserve Rhodey, to have the older man take him under his wing and make sure that he didn't die of alcohol poisoning or get fucked up behind a frat house.
Don't get Tony wrong, he loves his Mom an awful lot because c'mon, Maria Stark was his Mom no matter if she was absent from his life from a young age and had a strong relationship with gin and painkillers. Maria Stark might not have been the best mother, but She loved her son.
And so, Steve would shake himself off, preserver because then he would be reminded that there were a lot bigger problems in this world than Steve's desert dry love life, or the fact that he's still pinning after a man no Steve hadn't heard from in years. He has had heard so much about him, however, especially upon the announcement of the gracious Stark Insurance that newly entrusted Tony Stark had established for the men and women fighting for America's front, a gesture to wave over the gossip of where or who exactly Stark Weapons was being manufactured for had begun to appear.
“I’d like it if you’d straddle me,” he declared, patting his knees. He knew it would be easier to touch Tony that way. He wanted to make Tony feel worshipped and respected. It was obvious no one in a sexual relationship with him had respected his boundaries. This was all about boundaries.
“Jesus you’ve potentially ruined everything!” Steve protested, throwing Tony a look of pure disapproval. Looking distressed, he surveyed the next group of people passing by, not really having chance to take in the features of the man still in front of him. Rolling up his arm the counter had disappeared, replaced with a clean 00:00. His stomach dropped, eyes vacant as he panicked.
“These things don’t hide who I am? Or at least it doesn’t seem that way to me. Hiding myself from you would be telling you I’m ace too when I’m really… really not. In fact, I’m the complete opposite. Trying to make my expressions more aware of your existence seems like courtesy to me? But if it makes you uncomfortable I can not think about these things, it just… I’ve never really thought about these things but now I’m with you it seems obvious to me.” He reached over and petted Tony’s shoulder.
“I won’t get drunk on you, I promise.” He considered for a second, then finished his glass in a couple of burning gulps and left it at the bar. The last thing he wanted was to make Steve uncomfortable. “I’m sorry. That I can’t just not drink. I don’t want to make any of this harder for you.” He sat back down on the couch and leaned into him. “Do you need me to go drink something else? Brush my teeth? To get rid of the taste in my mouth? I can do that. If it helps, even when I do get drunk, I’m a giggly and clingy drunk–not an angry one. I mentioned that earlier, I think, but.”
Tony wasn’t going to talk about the kiss. It was enough that Steve kissed back and didn’t push and was practically perfect, ugh. He put the pizza behind them and his drink in the holder and then they were off again. He couldn’t really believe that Steve liked talking during movies. Nobody ever really liked that. He wasn’t even sure he liked that, though he was the worst offender ever, according to everyone he’d ever watched something with. But it was unbelievably, overwhelmingly sweet that Steve was thinking about movie nights with him. “Do you have family? Parents, siblings, cousins?”
Steve laughed a little, “I like to have control over my body since I was sick as a child a lot,” he responded honestly. “I’m not so into muscles personally, I prefer a beautiful face.” He smirked looking up at Tony with a coy stare.
When he came back out, he was wearing pale pink lace panties and a white chiffon robe with a pair of stockings and a garter belt he’d had to dig out of the very bottom of the drawer. “Like what you’re seeing, édesem?”
“Yes,” Tony answered simply, wishing he had an honorific to use.  He relaxed completely under Steve’s touches, breathing slowly and deeply as he felt Steve’s hands massaging him and Steve’s mouth kissing and touching him.  He rested his own hands on his shoulders, one moving to play with the hair at the base of Steve’s skull.  “I would love for you to mark me.”
Tony was feeling a little territorial too, and he put himself between Steve and Pepper to block her sight of his frankly gorgeous abs. Then he pulled Steve’s arms around him. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony willingly, pulling them close together. He hadn’t realized Tony’s possessiveness but he was catering to it anyway.
Tony grinned when he got what he wanted, then yelped when he fell to the mattress and laughed and squirmed and giggled at the kisses and nuzzles after that.  He eagerly followed Steve under the covers and cuddled up to his side, feeling significantly more content than he had before all this.
“I really enjoyed that - thank you,” Steve spoke softly with a smile. “Today you’ve really pushed yourself and I appreciate it so much. Honestly, this has been the best first date I’ve ever had,”
It took him a second for his breathing to get back to normal, then he leaned down to close the couple of inches between them and kissed him just as softly as last time. “Maybe if you had it done real fancy with flowers and stuff I could forgive you for it. Then it would be something embarrassing in a fun way. But I might still mock you for it frequently.”
Steve wasn’t an idiot, he knew exactly what Tony had done. The guise of looking like nothing had happened was thinly veiled and Steve could see right through it. As he watched Tony sit down he quirked an eyebrow.
At that point Steve made his way into the living room.  He saw Natasha stroking Tony’s hair and seethed.  “Nat he’s not yours to caress like a pet,” he snapped.  “Tony can we go to yours?” he asked plainly.  Nat moved her hand away, although she guessed he’d just lashed out at her because he and Bucky had argued.  She looked at him with quiet anger before standing up.  “It was lovely to meet you, Tony,” she beamed falsely.  She was keeping up appearances, but she was good at that.
“What do you think of the newer ones? Are you a fan?” He inquired, holding Tony’s hand tightly. “I have got to show you some cool Star Wars themed art pieces I have. I just have a thing for illustrating Jedi.”
Steve laughed at Tony’s question, flushing a light dusky color on his cheeks. “I guess you could say that but it’s not integral to my sex life. It’s like if someone doesn’t like a position I’m into--its not really a prerequisite for someone to be willing to give me control,” Steve answered as honestly as he could. “But if it’s happily given to me then I’m eager to take it.” Steve summarized, before pausing.
“I turn on the TV like a normal person,” Tony answered with a grin. “The remote is in the basket under the coffee table.”
“I’m thinking something ridiculously terrible and cult. What about Back to the Future?” he asked. “You gotta like old sci-fi right?” He smiled, as the elevator deposited them on the main floor.
It took him a little while to say anything again. “I am very overwhelmed and I don’t know and I don’t even know your last name, Steve, this was supposed to be a question and answer get to know you game, but if you’re not going to give up on me tonight, then I need some physical contact right now.” He needed to be hugged for at least eight hours. Preferably for the rest of the month.
“I guess you’re really not used to my sort of intensity, either,” he smiled, “it’s okay, we’ll take today easy, although I’ll miss all that fantastic skin touch we had last night,”
“I prefer Master,” he whispered.  “That is your special name for me,” Steve informed him.  “Say it,” he encouraged, nudging the side of Tony’s face with his nose.  “I want to hear it in your beautiful voice.”
“Holy shit that’s so cute. Butterfingers squeaked at you like a guinea pig?” He looked spellbound. He watched the bots grapple with the ball. “Awerh jeez that’s adorable.” He still wasn’t sure how to interact with them yet, so he just watched them astounded.
“I’m sorry. You can talk to me. About your dad. If you ever need to. Or anything.” He should’ve asked but… He rarely actually knew what he was supposed to do in personal, intimate interactions. “Do you want a snack? I can go find what’s left of the pizza. Or some ice cream or popcorn or… I dunno, salad? Anything you want.”
about how great my ass looks right now.  It’s being expertly presented.  You can look, if you want.  I’ll pull my coat up out of the way.” He had something special on underneath, too.  Black lace that he hoped Steve would appreciate enough to draw like he had the last lacy thing he’d worn for him.
Steve hummed at Tony. “Baby I’m not playing you at all. I promise.” The honest plea soon morphed into something different. “I am yours to keep,” he said bluntly, referring to the fact that he believed they were soulmates.
“Yeah. They were great parents. I always felt so bad for them that they couldn’t have kids of their own, but I was also a little selfish and grateful, y'know? Sometimes, when my parents were gone, she’d call me her son. A fiam. I know more about their lives than my parents’. I could never even get my mom to talk about her family.”
“Yeah.  Yeah, you can kiss there,” he answered a little breathily.  He touched Steve where he could, but also gave him the room and cooperation he needed to get all of his clothes off.  He smirked when his pants were moved to show his black, barely-there lace panties and gently guided Steve’s hands to rest on his mostly bare ass.  “I wore these for you.”
“Well, we have loads.  Hot chocolate, a collection of teas, beer?” Bucky offered as he walked through into the kitchen.  Natasha followed shortly, leaving Steve and Tony momentarily in the hallway.  Steve mouthed a quick thank you, his cheeks still sprinkled red from the embarrassment of having his romance style mocked, then he led them into the kitchen where Bucky was boiling the kettle and Natasha was fishing in the tea cupboard.
“Every part of me is personal, sugar pie,” he murmured in response. The touches against his ribs were just as intimate as ones against his thighs would be and he just needed to keep them a little limited for now.
He dialed. Steve answered. He’d barely made it a block away and his heartbeat doubled when he saw it was an unknown number. “Steve? It’s Tony. I’m sorry I didn’t, uh... I… would like to go on a date with you. Dinner and a movie? I know all the best Italian places and you can pick what we go see.”
Tony started to whisper in Hungarian again as requested, telling Steve exactly how beautiful he was and how very much he wanted to be with and belong to and be claimed by him.
“I quite happen to like messes, they’re very creative. I’m also quite the mess,” Steve tried to soothe the obvious brashness of the interaction. “This mess is called Steve,” he added gingerly rummaging in his messenger bag, pulling out a marker pen. He took Tony’s hand, the action being both gentle but firm, scribbling his phone number down on the skin.
“Okay, so. This is super embarrassing, but it was one of the guys that volunteered at the library. He was probably five years or more older than me, but he was so cute and sweet to the kids and I loved going there to get away from my family during summer break and mostly I just started at him a lot.” He wet his lips and shifted a little to rest his head in the crook of Steve’s neck. “Does a normal basement work well for art? How do you get enough ventilation and lighting?” That was a bit of a weird question coming from him since his workshop was underground, but he was rich enough to be able to install fancy ventilation units.
Tony had never had much of a thing for stockings, but he would love to wear them for Steve. Any kind. “Would you draw me tonight?” He kissed Steve’s neck as asked, trailing little kisses all the way down across his shoulder and then moving back up to nose at his jaw. “You could draw me in this or I could go put on something pretty. I’d really like to pose for you, though.” He realized that might be pushing past what was really okay for today, but the idea of having Steve’s total attention like that was too enticing to not at least ask.
Stuffing his things into his bag, he bounded down the stairs and straight out into the driveway where Tony was waiting in the car, he pulled up shot gun and tossed his bag down. Running his hand along the dashboard, he whistled. “Nice interior, what model? I’m uh, more into motorbikes, but I can totally get behind a beautiful car.”
Steve listened to Tony telling him anecdotes and stories tied to various facts he was sharing.  They stayed out in the cold for a few more hours before Steve started to feel the cold a little more than was worth it.
“Six is great, but if you get held up, don’t worry. Just text me and I’ll look at later showing times, okay? No pressure.” He reassured, he didn’t want Tony to get anxious or wound up over a date. This was for fun, and he was a flexible person. “I look forward to seeing you again,” he added, taking care to be extra charming.
Steve was honored that Tony wanted to be so close to him so soon.  He was also extremely glad for it.  He didn’t want the night to take a nose dive after it had been so wonderful.  As they took the elevator to the penthouse, Steve nodded.  “Sure,” he smiled, tucking his arms around Tony’s waist.  “Didn’t you say you wanted to show me your ass? I think it’s quite possible your ass has what it takes to save the date,” he teased, nudging his nose into the small hairs on the nape of Tony’s neck.
“Can I ask what it is about orgasms you dislike?” he inquired. “Part of me of is just curious about the mechanics of sex on that part. I’d never want to put you through something that makes you feel awful, but at the same time I’m struggling to imagine anything reciprocated where we are able to bypass that? Unless that is… stuff doesn’t happen, you know like at all, down there.” He paused before adding “I’ve been trying to think of ways around it. I mean there’s definitely other things to have fun with that aren’t your cock but it’s like, what do I do to stop that, ultimately, if you don’t get hard?” he asked, genuinely curious. “Or are there ways to frame the orgasm that will make you feel better about it? See, I suppose this is where you’ll see I don’t hide my sexuality from you. I’ve been thinking how to claim a steady middle area for us ever since last night because I’m not going to be able to consistently stay in the same bed as you and not want to do stuff,” he explained. “I hope that doesn’t weird you out or anything - I am just… really attracted to you. This is the longest I’ve gone with a partner before we’ve, you know, stayed in bed all day in the traditional sense.” He smiled a little.
Steve could feel Tony shaking. “Oh hey.” Steve soothed, “everything’s okay, I promise,” Steve tried his best to assure Tony in his vulnerable state. He moved his hands so they were soothing over Tony’s back, hands moving in circular motions. “I’ve got you baby. You’re not alone, Lemme give you some emotional aftercare for a little while, baby.” He quickly took control of the situation sensing that Tony was emotionally overstimulated and uncomfortable.
Steve snorted indignantly, “Since when did I explicitly say I didn’t want it to be you? That’s an outright assumption,” he debated, having no clue why he was still following this person—who, very clearly, had no interest in him either. “Not everyone who loses their counter ends up alone.” Steve blurted out, “I know some people with scarred over counters and broken counters who still found their soulmates.” Why was he reasoning with this person so much? Maybe it was the shards of obviously broken self-esteem that made Steve want to make him happy, or maybe it was the air of disappointment that made Steve want to impress him. “Just ‘cause your timers broken doesn’t mean you are.” He insisted on keeping pace with Tony but he made sure not to touch him again. Not without invitation. “My counter and my instincts led me to this one meeting, are you seriously leaving without at least trying something out. Even a coffee?” He asked, again surprised at how stubbornly anti-soulmate this person seemed to be. Now that he had put it in his mind that they could be connected, Steve couldn’t easily let him go.
"I’m yours,” he agreed quietly, relaxing a little now that he was being held again. “I don’t want it to be never. I want to scene with you and for you to get to know me well enough for that. I do.” He fisted one hand in the back of Steve’s shirt. “God, you keep getting me super emotional and having to hug me better. I really would like to have our next date not end up like this. Just a little hint for when you plan it.”
He shrugged, “I really don’t like talking about things that sucked. I know you don’t mean to do things because you don’t know what happened - I don’t expect you to mind-read either. Honestly, I don’t get upset the way you seem to. Its fine.” He paused. “Besides, my relationship with my abuser isn’t so black and white. We abused each other. No one is a bad person. We still deeply care for each other. It’s a very different situation.” He tried his hardest to explain although it wasn’t really an explanation at all.
“If she worries about you then I like her,” Steve declared, barely thinking about it. “Now I know exactly who to team up with to look after you mwahahaha,” Steve teased using his fingers to tickle at Tony’s sensitive skin, remembering how he’d wriggled and squirmed at the tickling last night.
well aware from the texts and messages that Steve had been thinking about him.  “It’s much better now that I’m with you.  Are we going out of the city?”
“Not a lot of good, honestly. A three year, incredibly abusive relationship, and then I was just in the community for a while because it felt safe, after. Maybe not safe, but something. I’ve done stuff with a couple professionals, and I’ve had two platonic d/s relationships, one of which went really well for a while. Helped me get comfier trusting someone with that stuff again. But hey, stuff happens. How about I trust you about the trust thing for now and we can talk about it again much later.” He pulled out onto the lookout point, facing west, and put the car into park. Then he opened the pizza box between them. “Why’re we eating vegetarian and gluten free? What’s the story behind that?”
No. It was a lot of personal questions, but he could handle it. “If it makes you happy, I don’t mind, as long as it’s about you and it stays that way. Anything after I get an erection is uncomfortable, but that doesn’t really happen unless it’s forced. It doesn’t bother me to be there while someone else is enjoying themselves. I don’t… I don’t ever really want to, but… In a scene, my wants get mixed up with the dom and it’s confusing. I don’t know.” He was blushing and beyond uncomfortable and this was a disaster. “Why do you care? No one’s… No one’s ever cared.”
“He’s so polite. It makes him adorable.” Steve grinned as he let Tony lead him up the stairs towards Tony’s office. Watching Tony’s handprint unlock the office was again extremely impressive. He followed into the office, immediately struck by the amount of computer screens, sticky notes and organized chaos. He smiled, he figured this is what the inside of Tony’s brain must feel like. When the NDA appeared in front of him, Steve didn’t even read what was on it. “I promise, no telling anyone about the awesome things you show me. They can be our little secret,” he winked before placing the pen down.
Tony immediately relaxed at the feeling of Steve’s hand in his hair, sighing softly, and he tried not to think about how much better it would be if he hadn’t put any product in his hair to slick it back. “Some of the time it’s red and some of the time it’s blue. And I like all music. All genres. I’ve even sung along to a country song once or twice.” He started to rub little circles into his back with his thumb. “I can’t wait to see your art. What kind of stuff do you do? Tell me about it?”
“I… Didn’t realize I looked quite that bad earlier. Sorry, I… Steve, I really… Fuck, I thought you were serious about this.” He was not going to get all emotional on this guy’s doorstep. He wasn’t. He dropped the roses and turned around, deeply regretting letting himself take this chance, and went back towards the car.
“It’s not hiding who I am Tony - I’m not… as marginalized? In that sense? This is how you deserve to be treated: with respect and consideration.” He caught himself before he got too heated - it wasn’t even
“I love your corny romance,” Tony responded sincerely.  “It… I guess it’s cliché for a reason.  Makes me feel special.” He reached over to squeeze Steve’s hand for a second, then settled back into the seat.  “I’m not worried about being kidnapped.  My parents died in a car accident and I’m just… not used to other people driving unless I’m drunk.  But it’s okay, Steve.  I’m just a little nervous.  And I’m probably going to be a backseat driver here.  Doesn’t mean you have to change anything.  Can we play some music? I want to hear what kind of stuff you like.”
Steve half listened to the words, mainly concentrating on their sounds, the way they changed Tony’s voice. He had no idea what was being said but it didn’t seem to matter - at all. Steve could feel himself slightly losing control. In his heart, he could feel that he wanted more and he knew that was dangerous. Humming against Tony’s skin, he pulled away from kissing him. His chest was heaving, from panting and sucking in air with sighs of arousal.
“Fuck… you’ve actually made a sentient piece of technology?” He was beyond astounded. “Does this mean you’re technically a father?” he asked again. “Oh man I’m so okay with that and I never thought I’d be saying that.”
Tony just barely kept himself from doing something ridiculous like offering to build him a studio. That was so far away from what was okay to offer on a first date. Unless he intended to be a sugar daddy? But no, that was something he’d tried once and it was just uncomfortable.
Steve felt the familiar burning sensation in his gut, his arousal leaked through his stomach, pooling at the bottom, and he could feel himself getting hard.  He trusted Tony to red out if he felt unsafe, though.  Moving his lips along the top of the lace, Steve started to mouth at the skin closest to his right hip.  The sucking was gentle, nothing too sharp.  Just enough pressure to make a healthy red welt that would soon bruise over.  Licking a trail with the tip of his tongue across the lace, Steve picked another site to repeat the action.  It was done so deliberately, done with absolute purpose and attention to detail.  He was in his element.  As he rounded of the last love bite, Steve started to massage Tony’s ass again.
“Tony?” Steve asked, wandering aimlessly out of the bedroom. He was shocked to see a woman fully dressed in business attire staring at him wide-eyed. “Are you okay? I can hear shoutin’,” he mumbled, rubbing at his eyes again.
? C'mon, man, you know I'm a waffle kind of guy, if you're going to dump me at least get my favourite breakfast food right."
"Yeah, for Butterfingers- Oh! Sarah, Jarvis came up to visit today and brought up some photos to put by my bed, can you get them from the backpack for me please? There should be a Photograph of DUMM-E in there, I want you to see my 'bot."He sounds so thrilled as he speaks, smiling widely at Sarah as he points towards the backpack in the far left corner in a childish manner.
"You're going,"Tony's face is frozen, his voice is laced with dread and realisation that has every fibre of his being to tense and flinch simultaneously. His chest stills, there's a sharp intake of breath that follows his jagged, pointed words because as much as Tony knew this was happening, he didn't think it would be this quick.
Howard, who Tony believed held his own type of deranged sadness in the forms of alcohol and abuse, did not hold back on expressing that by the age of 7, Tony had no right to be crying over scraped knees or in want of a hug when he was feeling extremely sad, or upset, or down.
"Yeah."He sighs, spinning in the chair for a second before he pauses, glancing up at Rhodey. The older of the two is already looking his way a Tony, a soft encouraging smile on his lips."I'm really glad that you're here, Honey Bear."
"And sometimes rumours lead to the truth."It's not said but Steve can guess what she's angling at as he slumps deeper into the passenger seat, wishing now that he had stuck with his stubbornness and walked to his apartment rather than give in and let Natasha give him a lift. She sighs, he looks away."Bucky said he was shaking like a tree in the wind."
"What are you implying?"Tony raises his eyebrow at the blonde, feeling defensive at the thought that Steve is implying something.
This state of mind is not alone, however, because when Tony Stark is sad, or sorrowful or stuck in self-loathing pathetic rut, it's often accompanied by awfully stupid decisions and the need to act as if he hadn't two brain cells to rub together. Which, Tony has learned, is how men like him to be, is how women like him to be, because men and women alike love to have someone who is usually so strung up, well presented and dominant, under their thumb so much so that they can't even string a sentence together. And so, that's how Tony acts.
Like tampering with one of the Prototype 'Stark Missiles' in Howard's workshop and having it explode in front of Tony
"Uh, yeah."Tony lies, looking away from Steve. He doesn't want to admit that he doesn't celebrate Christmas, too many dark memories that he'd rather not remember or have them brought up. It didn't matter anyway, Tony spent the holidays on his own, locked away in his room with his gadgets.
"Guys."Tony bluntly replies, taking out a bag of crisps from one of the many food bags that has been set on the counter. He watches the way that Steve's ears go extremely pink with a blush and Tony worries that maybe this is the hypothetical problem that Tony has been trying to suss out from the start because Steve is too much of a good guy and maybe his flaw is that he's homophobic.
"This is ridiculous."Steve continued to fume, cheeks punk and lips pouted, practically throwing the carton into the trolley."What's next, a bag of Spuds being 3 dollars? Paying for Water?"
But Steve's notions would suddenly become tainted when reminded that he no longer had that privilege of texting Tony, of telling him of his latest trek through the desert or of how Bucky recently gotten on his nerves, treating him like a kid with a bad temper or what not. He would suddenly be pricked with the realisation, even after all those years, that Tony was no longer his, not as if he was his in the first place.
this stance. It's the stance of dominance, a tactic to overcome fragile masculinity, to win an argument, to show he's right, when he puts on his stubborn, headstrong head on. It's a stance that causes most arguments and one that nearly everyone is very familiar with.
"Oh really? What's his favourite colour? His shoe size? Does he have siblings? A dog? What do you call his parents? Does he love his mother?"Bucky is listening off peevishly, listening each question off with his fingers as he follows Steve like an annoying younger sibling, even though it's usually the other way round.
It could be worst, it could be a lot worse and there could be a figure sitting beside the bed, haven been seated in an uncomfortable plastic chair for hours and hours, more nervous than the one in the bed with a missing arm up to the shoulder, more worried and feared, with baby fine blonde hair and sparkling blue eyes that always look up in such earnest and honesty and loveliness that Tony sees when he closes his eyes, when he's wrapped up in warm duvets on cold winter nights and wants them to be the arms that had held him that early morning in a diner booth.
"I should've been there."Peggy eventually speaks after what has to be minutes, hours, days, or so it feels, quiet and soft but not understanding because she
He asks in hope of there to be nothing because there's a car sitting in his garage awaiting his attention, which is an excuse of course, because the car in his garage has been there for well over 8 years now. It's a project that Tony can't bring himself to finish, but one he doesn't want to entirely abandon either because it's oddly sentimental and Tony is weird about sentimental stuff like that, evident from his workshop that is clustered with clunky gifts from young fans or his wardrobe filled with articles of clothing left behind by past lovers.
"Nonsense, Dr Banner is far sexier."It's playful, harmless flirting and smirking as he hooked his arm around Bruce's own, dragging the man out from the crowds of entrepreneurs and money hungry business men on the look out for Tony. "I heard, through the gossiping grapevine that is Harvard's research department that
"I might've,"Tony gives him a coy smile as he follows after Steve towards the kitchen to set the bags on the counter for later."People tell me that I have a tendency of going a little overboard when it comes to buying people gifts. And I couldn't come to your house without a gift, so there's that too."
But he's a friend, his best friend, and so Rhodey holds him just as tight and stands with him until their legs are numb and the tears have dried and Tony pulls away with dried tear stains on his cheeks and his eyes are red, but neither of them say anything of it. And Tony clears his throat, turns away slightly but not really moving away.
"I swear to god, Anthony Stark!"And it should've been expected because Tony can never live up to his promises or does what he's told and Rhodey can do nothing else more but shake his head and plonk himself down in the hallway, ready to wait for Tony to emerge from the workshop or storm in himself.
Tony had spot him in the centre of the crowd, standing tall in his crisp suit and a crystal tumbler twirling in his hand, it's contents of liquid gold swirling against the glass. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn't distracted by him, more so for the fact that Tony's entire self has been knocked side wards after the eventful morning and the alcohol that still lingers in his system was not helping either. He hasn't seen Tiberius in so long and unlike Steve, who Tony had knew to be alive, he frankly thought Tiberius had been dead.
for the remaining occupants of the house.  Maybe it was different when Tony was little, where there was a Nanny that tended to his every boo-boo and numerous tutors that taught Little Tony Stark the Ins and Outs of mathematics. Now, the house barely consisted off Howard and Maria.
The door of his workshop had opened, tucked a number of floors below ground level of Stark Industries New York building with easy access to a private car park through a garage door at the far end of the workshop. Tony had noticed, not really, and it was only when the music had stopped that he lifted his head from the cars engine to look at the assistant who'd entered the workshop, poised and confident but carrying a worrying edge that unnerved Tony because Virginia Potts, the only Stark Industries assistant Tony
"I thought that was later this afternoon."Tony pauses, looking up at the Doctor through glasses he seemed to have produced from thin air and frame his face perfectly. The glasses make him look so much more natural and normal. Tony isn't ready to see James Barnes yet, or later, he was actually guilty hoping that the man would bail, roll the dice and take the chance to run because if it was up to Tony, he would split.
"I don't know if I'm hurt, I feel numb, I always feel numb."Tony's voice comes out robotic, still without emotion as if trained to have said these words over and over again in front of his bedroom mirror, inside of his head as he walked home from a bad date, into himself under the sheets of his bed when he's crawled into bed. There's no emotion in his words but Steve can
His habits never venture far and never where they addicting, something that Tony is proud of himself because it's not easy. They never were the hard stuff, because as much as Tony is a thriving to be alcoholic - it's in his blood, it's his density for sure - and has a thing for the odd blow of weed now and again or sometimes Ecstasy whenever Ty sneaks him it, he wasn't stupid nor immature enough to do anything harder or idiotic as cocaine or heroine.
His hospital room is blanked in darkness, the blinds drawn closed in his room and the only light source being the light coming off of his - christened - 'Stark Phone' with AC/DC playing to his left from a portable speaker that was hidden in one of the drawers beside his hospital bed. There had already been nurses round to give him one dose of medication, another not scheduled until later.
, friend. Tony has been repeating those words for the last 12 hours, and still, it doesn't correct because Tony Stark doesn't have
"For god sake, let him talk, Stevie."His voice has changed to, in a way that only someone who has spent military service and came out more broken than he had went in can hold. It's rougher, deeper. Steve's mouth snaps shut but he remains a wall between Tony and his patient which is unnerving as he sucks a breath in.
Back to the point; Tony didn't go out. The free time that he ever did have he spent it on his own, locking himself away from the world of business or the aliens that crawled out of portals that lead to a many multi-Universe. It was an automatic thing, for him to get so caught up with touching up his suits or designing a new stark tab that he wouldn't exactly release to the public but just use it for himself.
Today however, it's different, because Tony actually kind of wants to go to Steve's house - because after a lot of dwelling and ranting to Jarvis who would rather see Tony going out than staying in, Tony had decided to actually go to Steve's house - and that's weird. Because Tony never wants to go anywhere, no matter how the media portray's the teenager as a social butterfly and never out of social interactions, Tony prefers the comfort of himself,
He knows of the reasons of his discharge, he knows because he was told quite frankly one dusky evening that the army was discharging him with honours, with medals and a fancy Sargent Captain title, whereas Bucky had told him of the real reason, the reason that for the life of Steve, he cannot remember is.
"Tony!"Rhodeys voice has changed from desperate to anger, slamming down the mug that had been cradled in his hands onto the kitchen table, to show his desperation, his anger, his confusion at Tony's frantic.
There's a sigh that leaves his lips as he straightens his spine, rolls back his shoulders and braces himself for turning to look at Steve. He's gotten bigger. Bigger in the shoulders, in the chest, in height, in mass. He's bigger and taller and stronger. His features have hardened in certain ways t do with age but also to do with war, and his brow has creased. But his eyes, his lips, his baby fine blonde hair, the underside of his jaw where Tony use to lay sweet kisses of Hellos and Goodbyes; they remain the same.
"That sounds about right."There's a clunk, the plastic bag dropped to the floor as Rhodey emerges closer to the stairs and nudges at Tony not unkindly."You might be small but you're fucking heavy and I'm not carrying you up a billion flights of stairs. Get up."
Dinner was awkward, more for the fact that Tony had been stuck up by the head of the table along side his Mother and a member of Howards company while Rhodey had been stuck further down in between two duchesses to be. Thankfully, Maria had been distracted enough by her boss of wine and friendly conversation to notice of the phone in her Sons hands under the table as he texted Rhodey.
Tony scoffs, looking away from Rhodey but neither of them really moving away, his eyes falling onto the discarded mug that Rhodey had slammed onto the kitchen counter as he scrambled to catch up with Tony's hyperactivity of leaving. It's his mug, battered and worn with fading design on its painted coloured ceramic, coffee stained on the inside and burnt at the bottom from times that he accidentally left it on burning surfaces in the workshop.
And okay, Steve may be your local hero who was ready to climb a tree to save your damn stupid cat or run to the local supermarket just because you forgot milk, but that didn't mean he didn't get into some sort of trouble. Bucky has had to drag Steves ass out of a handful of fights he has caught himself in, busted up in the face and bruised in the torso.
"We'll decide on the night. Maybe even let Tony pick?"Steve plates the finished French toast, already putting on another round for himself. He slides the plate across the counter, hitting Bucky's thigh."Enjoy, Jerk."
"Tony, I don't mind working Christmas Day. Somebody has to work it, and if I don't then someone else will take my place."
"I- right, okay."Steve almost sounds defeated and a part of Tony wants to apologise and throw the StarkTab out the window and say '
Tony finishes with the heart monitor, turning it over so that the front is now facing up and Toby can fiddle for it to turn back on again. The screen lights up with green, and inside of that damn blasted beeping sound, a soft chime echos through the room with every beat of Tony's heart.
But Tony can't do that, drop this case and take off because he has been working and dreaming and hoping for this for so long. Barnes is the perfect candidate, from location to tissue to nerve to blood type. He's perfect. And Tony and Stephen have been eating and wishing and working on this for too long for Tony's overly complicated personal life to get in the way.
He leaned over and turned the sound system on--it was connected to his iPod, but he paused the song.  “At the moment I have some Melanie Martinez but I have a feeling she’d be super triggery for you.  You know her stuff right? If it is, then I’ll try and find something tame but I like a lot of songs that kinda discuss taboo shit.  It’s part of the hipster thing.”
“No, shockingly, I don’t think I would.” Tony laughed and nuzzled him. “You’ve got me,” he agreed. “What’re you planning on doing with me now?” He definitely wasn’t watching the movie now, and he was pretty sure Steve wasn’t either.
There was a flash of adoration in Steve’s eyes, thrilled to hear Tony say that he’d be happy to sleep with him and to have this playful back and forth.  “You’re actual perfection.” He leaned over the unit separating the driver and passenger sides to steal a kiss and nuzzle Tony lovingly, then he started the car, glad for the coffee because time was pressing on.  It took less time to get to Steve’s and they could avoid going through the worst of it in the heart of the city, and when he cut the power in the car, he turned immediately back to Tony.
“No! You know what, Steve,” he almost-yelled, turning back around to face him. He hated getting angry. Hated it. But that had hurt. He’d opened up to something and the universe had taken the invitation to destroy him yet again. So he was pissed. “You don’t get to do that! You don’t get to make me believe that I could actually have someone that was meant for me and would care about me and then make me feel special and like you’re really invested and then not even recognize me when I turn up on your doorstep, ready to give things a try! You don’t get to do that! I brought you flowers because I wanted to give you that romantic goddamn moment I ruined! And then you… I cannot do this.” He turned around again, taking the last few steps towards his car.
Steve smiled running his fingers over Tony’s scalp, threading his fingers through the thick brown curls. “My favorite color? It’s red. But it’s a particular type of red,” he smiled, “OCD makes being an artist brilliant because I am very particular over what shades I’m using.” He grinned,
“Aww. That’s sweet. I think. I’m sure I’ll enjoy the captive audience.” He grinned and pulled one of Steve’s hands up to kiss his palm and then stroke the stopped timer with his thumb. “It’ll be nice for me to have someone to point out all the beauty in it.”
There was a short pause after Tony stepped in to defend Bucky’s tease.  Natasha was smiling at the floor as if she found the awkwardness of the moment genuinely hilarious.
into that though.  I can handle it.  Were you okay with Nat being in your face? She can be a little OTT when you first meet her but she doesn’t mean it maliciously.”
The apartment was dark, Tony had asked to be woken, and despite wondering why this was the case, Steve obliged dutifully. “Hey, hey honey,” he whispered being quiet so that the noise wasn’t grating to Tony’s senses. “You asked to wake you up if I was going to get up,” he stated, hoping that this was what Tony meant. “Jus’ using the bathroom,” he informed with a slight chuckle. “Checkin’ ya know what’s happenin’,”
“You’re right though, walls are bad for a relationship. I’m grateful that you like my cheesy nature. It gets worse at Christmas so we’ll soon see if the novelty wears off for you,” Steve joked trying to rid himself of the insecurity that he would be too much for Tony. “Nice to know you plan on keeping me now, I must have reversed that awful impression I made of myself. Are you glad you gave me a chance?”
Steve rolled the paper up to avoid fold marks as he moved over to Tony. “I love the sound of your voice when you speak that one,” the language was unidentifiable to him but he didn’t care, any sound that rolled from Tony’s tongue was music to him. He walked over to Tony and gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek. “Sweetness is reserved for dessert,” he teased, leaving the drawing on the side of the table. He took his seat opposite Tony, “it was a close call between the millenium falcon or BB-8 and R2D2 because I’d been focusing on your cute little bot all afternoon. I couldn’t decide. I figured I’d prefer a color study of R2D2 and BB-8 so that’s probably part of your Hanukkah gift.” Steve hummed, taking a bit of garnished salad and mixing it with the lasagna before taking a bite.
“I’m just going to get them to warm up our breakfast okay? Because these cold waffles look so tragic I can’t face them,” he laughed, nudging Tony’s cheek. “Yours are even more tragic, look at them. They have a few angry scrape marks in them and pieces missing.” He was teasing trying to cheer Tony up. “I refuse to leave the diner knowing that we haven’t eaten the evidence of our first fight.”
“Sure, I’ll just grab a little sketchpad and pencils, totally would love it if you’d be so kind as to model for me,” Steve smiled, winking, before letting go of Tony to dash inside the house. He refused to let Bucky go out or even to the door to just look. The more he thought about it the more horrible it seemed to be. Imagining people gawping at you whilst you’re trying to live. He shook his head. It’s rough.
Steve hummed thinking about it.  “I think it’s more because they haven’t asked us… or you.  She just did it.  She assumed I would be okay with her touching you.  She doesn’t know you’re ace… and I guess ‘cause you are, intimacy like that is our sex so I don’t enjoy it without consenting.  I don’t think she did it on purpose, she sees touch as very disposable.  Nat is free with her body,”
Steve laughed at Tony’s sassy response. “Daffodils? How come they’re your favorite?” He asked, nuzzling Tony’s cheek before kissing it.
“You’re worth waiting for,” the words hung heavy in the air for a moment or two before adding “I don’t really have a cute accent, but I can tell you I only have eyes for my partner in relationships so you don’t need to worry about not having my attention. I’m quite able to devote all of that to you.” He answered generously.
very warm and very comfortable and Steve was hugging him perfectly. He whined in the back of his throat, wishing he didn’t have to pick, then pulled away. “’ll be back ‘na bit, 'kay?” He kissed his forehead, then squirmed out of the bed and pulled on a robe.
“Time to wrap it up Dr.  Stark,” Steve teased taking their empty coffee thermos away.  He rolled up the blanket and offered Tony help with packing down the telescope.  “I can assure you, my home is small but comfy.  God I am so excited to feel your skin against mine,” he spoke honestly.  “I’ve missed it so much.  I don’t know how I’m going to cope spending nights alone.  You’ve ruined me, I have no hope of enjoying sleeping alone ever again.” He layered on the theatrics, acting like a dork to get a laugh from Tony as they walked towards the car.
“Yes, but I don’t want to tell you here or now, because I’m not feeling particularly stable right now and I don’t want to become a person who cries in public just because I met my soulmate. So, later. Is that okay?” He didn’t want Steve to push him on this, but he wouldn’t fight too hard if he did.
“I can’t wait for you to meet my friends. You’re welcome at the house any time.” He added, “I want you to feel like you’re part of my life--if you want that.”
Steve laughed, “Yeah,” he nodded in agreement with Tony’s wrinkled nose. When Tony completely skipped the subject Steve sensed that was Tony-speak for not wanting to discuss sex, so he let it slide. He took a sip of his coffee, shaking his head with a smile. “How do you look so flawless in the morning? Like the morning isn’t a good look on anyone but I firmly believe you look good enough for one those vanity fair shoots and you’ve only just rolled out of your lair.”
There was one part of New York city that had always seemed like the most romantic setting to meet someone, and near by was a fantastic local Italian restaurant. The instinctual feeling took him to that very street for his exact time butterflies amassing in his stomach. Natasha and Bucky had already met, some would say like a fairytale and he was just desperate to have the same happen to him.
“I love how considerate you are.” Steve moved up to kiss along Tony’s jaw.  “I really appreciate this nice surprise, Tony.” He rubbed the tip of his nose behind Tony’s ear, kissing the soft skin there as he ran his fingertips over the welts he’d just made.
Steve waited patiently for the answer before humming, but didn’t need to wait all that long.  “Would you like me to take care of you for the rest of our date?” he asked, pressing chaste butterfly kisses along the slope of Tony’s shoulder.
“If you’re struggling with addiction and want to get help, I can help with that. Relapses happen, especially if you’re all alone in the thick of it, without any understanding support you trust when you’re vulnerable.” Steve reasoned, “it has to be your impulse to kick it, but I’m here if you want to. I can help,” he offered, before grimacing at the sounds of Tony’s father and his neglect.
“I do, but nothing scheduled till eleven.  I think you can keep me if you want.” Tony sat where he was directed and leaned back into Steve before taking the coffee and pulling his soulmate’s arms around him again.  “Steve? I’m… I’m going to say something completely crazy right now, okay? I don’t ever want you to let me go.  I think I’m falling in love with you.  I’m well aware that it’s only been four days and it’s completely insane, but it’s been intense and fast the whole way and I.  Want you to know that that’s how I feel right now.”
He wasn’t sure if he agreed with that or not. It seemed like Steve knew what he was talking about, but genius or not, Tony’s skillset rested in stem fields–not in sociology. “Maybe? I see what you’re saying, I think, but I also don’t want you hiding any part of yourself from me because you think it’ll make me more comfortable.” He got the keys and started the car, then waited for Steve to get in and drove them a few blocks over to the diner.
“There’s always going to be plenty of beauty in everything if you’re around,” Steve grinned, pleased with himself for being both cheesy and smooth. He watched as Tony’s thumb moved down to stroke over the timer, 00:00 now showing clearly against his skin. He sighed softly, moving aside Tony’s sleeve so he could kiss the scar. His lips brushed over the bumpy skin, his eyes closed. He felt awful for Tony. Having to see that scar appear and the timer vanished must have squashed his hopes.
“I like Italian meals, black coffee and if we’re going to the cinema; it’s sci-fi. You know, in case you wanted to retcon this meeting and try again,” he winked at Tony before finally turning away. It was his form of wishing Tony well but leaving it on a positive and playfully light note.
She closed her eyes for a second, clearly used to Tony. “Do you need fresh clothes, Steve? There’s nothing around here that’s likely to fit you, but I can go find you something or have your things cleaned.”
Steve breathed out a sigh of release, “Jesus thought ya was never gonna ask,” he half slurred from arousal. He swallowed thickly, “S'gonna be hard not to rub up against ya,” he panted. “If gets too much, word or somethin’,” Steve explained, aware that with the sweet friction of Tony’s weight against him there would be no hope of controlling himself properly. He moved his chair out backwards so Tony could slide on to his lap. Steve’s hands were rubbing over the tops of his thighs in an attempt to keep them occupied enough not to touch himself.
He couldn’t help but laugh at Steve in his bed and he crawled in after him, then gave him a shove. “It just takes practice. Go brush your teeth. I left a new brush on the counter.” He sucked in a quick breath though when their legs touched and he suddenly wasn’t sure that he could let him go. He pressed closer and kissed Steve’s jaw, then shook himself and pushed him away again. “Go. I’ll still be here when you get back. As will the bed.”
He hooked his fingers into the lace, feeling the patterns above Tony’s skin.  “Lace looks amazing on you, don’t you think, baby?”
“Mmng I don’t see myself lasting long,” he hummed his eyes already closing sleepily. He didn’t hear Tony’s response though, the evening had been emotionally tough and long at points as much as it was amazing.
He followed Tony as he disappeared to wash his face. “People always want what they’ve never had,” he mused aloud, moving towards the mirror, spiking up his hair a little and doing the buttons up on his shirt. One by one his torso disappeared as he fastened his tie. Once he was fresh and feeling presentable walked out into the open space of living room. Today already felt amazing.
Natasha quirked an eyebrow.  “He cornered you in an alley? That sounds so like Steve, that boy has no tact,” she tsked.  “I’m surprised you even took him up on an offer to date.  If Bucky cornered me in an alley when we met I’d have kicked him in balls and stayed single my whole life,” she sniggered softly.  “Especially if I had a scar,” she added.  “You didn’t feel threatened or anything? Into making contact with him? I promise he’s not a bad person he can just come off a little strong.  But if you’re not interested, leaving him sooner rather than later would be best.  He gets attached fast,” she warned, reaching out to tidy Tony’s fluffy fringe.  “He really likes you, I’ve not seen him this hung up on anyone.  He was singing whilst he worked yesterday.  I haven’t heard him sing in like two years,” she added, her green eyes searching out Tony’s for eye contact.
“Ignore my arousal, I just really love our kisses,” Steve whispered, moving his hands up to help the water through Tony’s hair.  He grabbed a shampoo bottle, pouring a decent amount onto his palm, then Steve started to massage it into Tony’s hair, walking them backwards so the spray hit his back and missed Tony entirely.
That was an appreciated warning and he smiled when he was lifted so easily, clearly delighted. “That’s! You can just pick me up, that’s! So cool!” He hugged Steve tighter, unbelievably happy with his consideration, and laid his head on Steve’s shoulder again. “I definitely want to do that, but I also want you to get to play with the bots. They don’t normally get visitors. Also, you just said the word rad, so I’m not sure I can sit next to you,” he joked, not pulling away at all. The fact that he was so willing to change their plans definitely worked in his favor and Tony calmed down very quickly. “You’re amazing. And we can go back downstairs. I just needed a second.”
He takes a gulp, liking his lips in an action that Steve shouldn't find attractive but he does. Tony is already whirling around to where his stuff lay out on top of the drawers and of his hospital bed, setting his cup onto the bedside table as he goes to attempt to take the suitcase out from under the bed, something Steve puts a stop to immediately.
"What about it?"Tony asks because he's heard more than enough questions about it. He'd been dragged around his parents party like a rag doll, poked and prodded by wondering fingers and pushy old bastards.
Natasha's car is a beat down, dark green Ford Focus, missing it's original passenger side door after a quick get away ended with the door being broken off by a lamppost - totally Clints fault - and now replaced with a black door from a similar Ford Focus. It's car that takes half an hour to start up and 2 hours to heat up during the coldness of Brooklyn weather, but a car that holds way too many memories and one that no one could bear let go.
"You talk shit,"Tony says calmly, bluntly, ease in his voice. Shrapnel poisoning is the truth, of course, but that's not something that Tony can let on about. It's knowledge to the Starks, the expensive doctors and hushed nurses ( and Steve, because well, it slipped out ) only. It's something that not even Rhodey knows ( and he won't know because it isn't
and it swallows Tony's own in a way that's familiar but not. The hand is so smoothed, without scars or blemishes and so unlike Tony's own which have been scarred from all sorts of bother.
Barging into his own workshop, Tony is waving off Dumm-E's attempts of greeting his welcome back and immediately reaching into his pocket for his mobile phone. It takes little to no time for his finger to have pressed onto Steve's contact, the familiar dial tone fresh in his ear, replacing the pulsing race of his pulse and blood that was previously circulating there.
finished this conversation."Bucky turns, glaring at Steve who rolls his eyes, shrugging on his jacket and zipping it up.
Tony is very good at preforming and maybe that's because his entire life has always been an act, a play, a stage show for the world to sit back, relax and enjoy as Tony stumbles over all the hurdles that life throws at him. He knows how to talk, to walk, smile and laugh in all the correct ways, he knows when to show dominance when shaking a hand and when to kiss the back of one and he definitely knows how to scan a room.
His workshop, where his favourite mug is usually stranded, filled with cold, old coffee or sometimes stuffed with pens and rubber bands that he keeps for the sole purpose of entertaining Dumm-E when he's bored. His favourite mug that lives in his workshop and hasn't been taken out since...since-
His memory does not stretch further than pulling up to Stark House in Malibu, California with Rhodey in the passenger seat and cases of beer and spirits in the back seat of the luxurious sports car. They had planned to spend the weekend confined to the Malibu house and Tony suspects that he played by that rule, just not in the way that Rhodey approved because as much as Tony promised the weekend to just be the two of them, he has a big mouth and word gets around rather fast.
, is exactly what he needs, even if it is for a few days in a war withered country to make PR happy, and by extension the ugly head that is Obie, happy too.
"I'm going! I'm going!"Tony is frantic with trying to get himself out of the apartment before he starts to make things worse, of only he could find his goddamn...
"It's good to see you too, J."Tony echoes, suitcase in the trunk as he slides into the backseat. Jarvis is situated in the passenger, A driver situated where he should be. Tony allows himself to relax into the expensive leather of the seats, head lolling back with familiarisation surrounding him."Y'know what I could really go with right now?"
There's a silence in the room that follows soon after Tony has announced the finished product that is the heart monitor, the only sound that carries throughout the room being the soft chime of a bell at every beat of Tony's heart. There's a proud smile that casts over Tony's face, cheeks full of grease and meat as he looks down at his finished product in proudness that he was able to fiddle around well enough to create a sound that didn't give him a migraine.
"Hmm."Howard hums, his eyes casting towards to Tony. There's a look in the younger Starks eyes that dares Howard to speak ill mannerly towards Rhodey, ready to lash out at the man. Howard looks like he's about to open his mouth to say something more before he decides to close it, giving his son one last look before turning his attention to this wife."Dear, there's somebody that I want to introduce you to. Come with me."
On his own, James had looked far more smaller than Tony had ever remembered him to be and maybe it's in the face, how his cheeks have sunken and his eyes have darkened or how his shoulders have slumped under a jacket that looks far too heavy and large for his frame to hold. Or how his skin has gotten that waxy sort of texture that only ill or victims of trauma seem to develop, after a war or a car accident or a mistake.
It's no later and no less than 10 minutes when his phone is lighting up with a text so brief that Steve is glad that Clint taught him how to read 'text' codes or else he would've had no clue on what it was that Tony had texted him. It's a couple of miles out but Steve doesn't mind, he can run it, he's ran longer and he'll run it for Tony.
"Shut up."The blonde rolls his blue eyes at Tony in fondness."Get some sleep, you look like you need it. And a Happy New Years, Tony."
"Dr Banner!"Tony had swerved his way through the crowds, dodging hands that would come out to grip his shoulders, hoping to grab some of Anthony Starks attention and slither into his wallet and pants. Tony may be young, still getting use to the galas, balls, banquet dinners and blind auctions but he was very knowledgeable when it came to avoiding touch and contact that was unwelcome.
There had been a buzz in his pocket which Tony had chosen to ignore, sure of who it was, sure he was willing to ignore its business. A message maybe, a missed phone call, a headlining alert with the favourite tag of
Tony was never sure what was worst in the caves, if it was the unbearable heat or the chilling cold, or maybe the torture and water boarding. But whatever it was, he survived it all. He was strong and resilient and sober for the first time in an awful long time and despite his aching lungs and bruised, pulsing flesh, Tony didn't crack under the pressure, under the beatings or water boarding or starvation.
"Oh I know, I remembered. I brought you tea, English Breakfast. 2 sugars, strong."Tony recites on autopilot, something he does a lot because he has a weird habit of just having to know everyone's preferred beverages. Mostly because he attends a lot of meetings with important people who get rather very mad when they get coffee instead of tea, or you only got them 1 sugar sachet and not the 3 they asked for. Tony also has a weird memory for things like this, the small details they nobody else cares about. Strange says it's sweet, Tony had told him he only remembers Strange' order because it's the same as his own.
"Doctor Stephen Strange. I keep telling him he should change his name to Doctor Sourpuss but he doesn't seem all that into it."Tony had looked over his shoulder just in time to catch a glimmer of a smile on Doctor Strange' face, it quickly turning into a scowl once noticed that Tony was looking over his shoulder. The fellow doctor straightens his spine, standing tall as he grabs a tablet off a nurse at the station.
"Look, anyway there's a flight leaving Philadelphia in 3 hours, that gives you enough time to pack your stuff, tell your mom and still manage to get for 7PM. Don't worry about formal wear, I'll have Jarvis ring up the best tailor is Rhode Island to fix you a suit in time for the dinner."He swipes down on the tablet, typing out a message that will sent to Jarvis to inform him.
"Tony, if you want this friendship to continue he's going to know sometime or another, whether that be by seeing your face popped up on some tabloid after tonight's event or from you yourself."He can practically hear the tiredness in Rhodeys voice.
He gets up from the chair, Tony takes a step back, feeling the papered curtain brush against his back, tickle the back of his neck as he makes it sway with his touch, knuckles white around the transparent glass of the tablet in his hands that illuminate all the information that Tony needs to see, that Tony needs to read out and nothing more.
"Tony."It's Rhodey's stop it voice, the voice he use to use back at MIT when Tony was being a bit too much of a show-off or a bit over the top. Tony looks at him offended, a squawk of a protest building in his throat because hey, you'd think people would be happy that Tony is still cracking jokes after such a traumatic experience but Pepper beats him to it.
"Do I look like I've been living under a rock?"Tony physically and audibly gasps, a hand on his chest as he spins to have a look at Thor who's leaning in the doorway. Sauntering closer to him, Tony calls off in order, counting on his upraised hand.
"You don't want me as a friend,"Tony swallows his chewed up food, and scrunching up the plastic that was once covering up a cheeseburger that Tony has now ate. He makes an aim for the closed bin, groaning and slumping against the pillows whenever he misses by a mile off."I'm a flight risk, a fuck up."
"It's supposed to make that sound, Y'know."Steve can't help but to laugh, the concern still relevant in his voice but laced with a sort of fondness that seems to wipe right over Tony's head. The teenager blindly reaches out for this glasses that rest on the hospital side table. Steve rushes to grab them to aid Tony, handing them to the teenager who thanks him silently with a nod."The beeping is to tell people that your heart is still beating and that you're
James wears the same leather jacket that he had last time Tony had seen him, heavy over his shoulders, hiding his missing limb. James hides his deformity with his jacket just like how Tony hides his with fancy suits and layers of black vests to dim its glow. It doesn't work for Tony and it doesn't work for James. But Tony knows that it doesn't work for him, Tony may have gotten to a stage of understanding that he'll have to live with this deformity forever but Bucky hasn't and he doesn't even seem to realise that he won't have to either.
"You doing okay?"Steve comes up behind Tony unexpectedly in the kitchen. He'd gotten up to get himself a drink in an act to clear his head and to get away from the commotion of so many people gathered in the livingroom. 5 people actually. Tony, Steve, Thor, Natasha and James.
Okay, yeah, Tony could totally see why Steve had been into Bucky.  Tony was a little bit too, but mostly, seeing his hair just made him want Steve with longer hair for him to play with even more.  He shook the offered hand.  “James, hi, I’m Tony.  I don’t think Steve was planning on bringing me home with him, but he skirted around showing me his studio earlier and I really did want to see his stuff.” He pulled off his coat and stashed it where Steve had put his, then wrapped his arms possessively around Steve’s waist.
He quickly ended up in fight with his PA about how yes, Steve was really real and was really there and was really his soulmate and yes, he was sure and no, he wasn’t going into work.
He let Tony lead him into their bedroom. He paused - he just thought of it as their bedroom. Being far to aroused to analyze that, he shoved the thought to the back of his mind. Grabbing Tony’s waist momentarily, Steve kissed Tony’s neck.
“Steve’s always been a little social justice warrior.  I remember him giving a talk to our class about how boys should be able to marry boys.  Then insisted on calling me his husband all day until the teacher had to tell him it was a little inappropriate.” He was chuckling now, Nat cooed as she walked over handing Bucky his tea.
Tony nodded eagerly.  “Of how amazing I’ve been for you tonight,” he parroted back, sounding a little breathless now.
“Well I was hoping for a kiss,” Steve smirked, nuzzling Tony back before turning to look towards the door. “I mean I would take this opportunity usually to tell you about how attractive I find you but somehow I don’t feel that would as exciting for you as it would for me,” he joked nudging their noses together. “So I figured you might want more intellectual entertainment. Which would mean more questions - or a tour of the house. Just an excuse to tackle you into cuddles on every surface available.”
“You deserve to feel good, baby.  There’s no need to thank me,” Steve hummed as he lathered the shampoo in, taking great care not to get it in Tony’s eyes or ears.  He then moved them so Tony’s hair was under the spray, and he squeezed, finger combed and caressed Tony’s hair until it was completely sud free with the upmost care and attention to detail.
“Honestly I had so many walls set up to save you from this side of myself but I guess you dismantled my entire facade and here I am. Dorky and exposed,” he smiled, “I usually don’t say this sort of shit in public trust me,” Steve assured, slipping off his shoes and reclining.
“Aw, c'mon.  It’s one language and one word and it just means ‘sweetheart.’ You’ve got it that badly for me, honey?” He wrapped an arm around his waist and kissed his cheek, then looked through the scope while he instructed Steve to make the adjustments.  “Here, Steve, look, I’ve got Sirius lined up for you.”
Steve snorted, “it’s fine, it just seems like it affects you, so I was asking more about how you felt. It’s like when I told you about my father you could have asked if I’d been to talk to someone about.” He shrugged, “I’m sorry to hear it’s still of a sore spot for you, I hope you can one day let go of the resentment,” he added, “my life would be easier if I could let go of mine,”
“Just wanna touch and kiss you all dressed up - like last night. Then m'gonna shower,” he informed Tony hoping he cottoned onto Steve’s meaning.
Steve used the hands Tony had a hold of to pull Tony closer to him. “I can word out if I need to - so can you,” Steve gently reminded Tony that he was still aware that they didn’t have to do anything they didn’t want to.
Steve moved his hands away from Tony’s waist, he moved them up to cup Tony’s jaw to give him one last kiss. “Perfect. I’m really glad to see you use the traffic light system. It shows me that you can which is important for me when it comes to trusting that you understand your own limitations,” Steve raised his hands to rest them behind his head, allowing Tony any space he might need. He was pleased Tony had enjoyed himself.
Steve looked at Tony, but it was hard to concentrate on what was being said.  Having it called adorable in the moment made it worse.  He stayed quiet, needing some time to recover from the embarrassment before he could interact again.
Tony didn’t bother asking about putting meat on one half. He could eat anything and they could figure out that stuff later. The person behind the front desk took their order and Tony bought them large drinks as well. “You’re sweet. Beyond sweet.” He squeezed his hand on the way over to the soda machine. “I love the 20 questions idea. And I love that you trust me to drive you out of the city at night with no clue where we’re going. And. I do want to meet your friend. In the future. And I don’t care if you talk about me as long as it’s not to the press or to someone you don’t trust.” Fuck, he was relaxing about this way too quickly. He always had trusted too easily, but this was…
Tony gasped and then swallowed.  He’d never done that--never used ‘master.’ He knew it was something people did, but… It felt so much more intense than 'sir.’ So much more dangerous.  He’d just have to trust a little more, then.  Tony wet his lips, then said it, not much louder than Steve’s whisper.  “Yes, Master.”
“Oh shush you’re everything I could ask for,” Steve soothed, rubbing his large palms over Tony’s back to relax him and help him feel safe. Steve could tell the moment was probably getting a little overwhelming for Tony. “That’s fine baby, just don’t leave me too long I’ll start missing that sweet smile,” he encouraged, whilst giving Tony his space.
“I do think we’re soulmates, yes. You need me, and with time I’m sure you’ll see that I need you just this much too.” He continued his movements against Tony’s back. “Do you like your hair being played with baby boy?”
“Thank you, so much,” he deadpanned at Tony sarcastically, finally focusing on him. The chiseled cheekbones and sharp jawline were quite breathtaking but this person obviously wasn’t anticipating a soul meeting and he’d been through a similar heartbreak before--there was no way he was repeating it now.
“Sorry Buck, I should have texted or something, I didn’t think.” There was a small round of awkward eye contact where Steve apologized as best he could without words.  He should have let Bucky know--just springing Tony’s presence on him was inconsiderate.  Despite that, Bucky moved forward and held his hand out to Tony.  “Pleased ta meet ya, I’m James.  Stevie calls me Bucky cause it was like, ya know, a kiddy thing.”
“So?” she asked, pushing up Tony sleeve hoping to see the 00:00 before he could snatch it away.  “How’d you guys –?” She cut off when she saw the scar, eyes widening.  “Oh! I’m uh, so sorry…” she trailed off.  She’d heard of scars before but had never seen one.  She recoiled like she was stung.  “How do you know you’re soulmates, then?” She asked confused.
"Steve… Quite a lot? I can be pretty unobservant. If I’m hitting sore spots, it would probably be better for both of us if you tell me. Like stone or not, I don’t want to be hurting you.” He pulled his plate over and took a bite of pancake, still leaning heavily on Steve. “And maybe not all of it can be smooth, but some of it? One date? That would be nice, is all I’m saying.”
"I mean, yeah? I guess I had to, They were my ride to the hospital most of the time, and Bucky kind of stole my phone and saw all of our messages so there's that too. Secrets don't stay secrets in my friend group."Steve admits, scratching the back of his neck as he blushes."But yeah, you should come down to Brooklyn. The next night we're all hanging out is game night if you want to come."
."Bucky's voice sort of dips into a sneer as he waves his hands about in a weird sort of gesture, face turned into a disapproving scowl as he gives the bed that Tony and Steve had been sharing the night before a disgusted sort of look before he continues."He goes back to his fancy collage Michigan-"
"You want a drink? Let me buy you one, I think I owe you one from, what, a couple of years back, I'm sure. It hasn't been
"Funny,"Rhodey drawls, grabbing Tony by the arms and yanking him into a sit, recoiling slightly with a turned up nose and grimace."For fuck sake, Tony, when was the last time you showered?"
"Why? So that you can rip it out of my chest yourself? I think not."Tony gives the man a stare, one that he receives back. It's all fun and games, what tiny could like to say it is because death is a funny subject to talk about, especially with Howard because he's seen death, he's been
It had taken Bruce a criminal amount of time to finish his course in comparison to his intellectual counterpart, whose money and natural charm had been a gift to allow Tony to finish earlier, despite the fact that their intellectual abilities were on par to one another. Tony knew this, of course, Bruce had simply just assumed that Tony had been smarter.
"I share a dorm with you, I know how you are. As long as I've got a place to sleep, I don't care."He laughs, throwing his backpack onto the bed and having a look around the bedroom. It's a big bedroom, not overly big that there wasn't enough room but big for only one occupant and sometimes none for most of the time."So what's the plan for tonight?"
