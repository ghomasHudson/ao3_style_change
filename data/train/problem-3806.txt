A few days have passed since Castiel last spent the night with Dean. He was a little disappointed to wake up the next morning to find Dean gone, but smiled when he found the sketch pad open to the risqué drawing he did of the two of them on the table.
John looked at him a long moment with an unreadable expression. But then he smiled and that smile felt like a win.
I'll take that as a yes.
"Yeah, alright." He agreed before tossing his coat on and heading out the door with Gabriel.
"So have you heard from the family?" Cas asked reluctantly. They still talked to Gabe, but Castiel had a feeling if they knew he was with a man too, they wouldn't talk to him either. Gabe was the messenger, sending word about the family to Castiel whenever he heard anything and it had been a while.
"No you won't. Now c'mon watch this with me."
"You have bipolar, how can I help you? I imagine that it's not easy to live with, especially if you're on disability for it. So how can I make it better?"
"Excuse me," Cas said grabbing his wrist. "You don't think I'd want to do that?"
Dean choked a bit on his food before his eyes widened as if he was searching for the lie in Castiels eyes.
By the time he thought he was worked open thoroughly enough, Dean was palming himself through his boxers and practically whimpering. Castiel shifted above him to pull Deans boxers down past his knees. Deans eyes were closed in the darkness so Castiel simply took the condom and tore it open with his teeth before carefully rolling it onto Deans cock. He lubed Dean up some more to be sure and lined it up with himself before slowly lowering himself down. Castiel practically sobbed when he was fully seated and Deans hips were jerking involuntary. Dean was by far the largest Castiel had ever been with and he couldn't say he was surprised seeing as how Dean looked like he was molded from god himself. He took a moment to catch his breath biting his lip and taking it all in. His eyes were closed and he felt Deans thumb pry his bottom lip out from between his teeth. Dean leaned up and kissed him gently and reverently before lying flat on his back again. Deans hands flew to Castiels hips holding him in place while also urging him to move at some point. Castiel took a shuddering breath before he took the first roll of his hips.
Cas almost said something along the lines if that's what you need, but then it clicked. Dean wasn't talking about the meds, he wasn't talking about his father, he wasn't talking about school. He was talking about Cas. Castiels heart dropped through the floor. He shook his head in disbelief.
"Yeah. It's super mean but you get to pick the color and then next person has to draw four cards." Eileen explained.
Donna was the first to wrap him in a hug which he happily returned. Donna was always a comforting presence. Almost like a mother. Well, a better one. He went over and cracked a beer with Garth and Garth talked all about Bess and the twins. He tried not to make the tenseness in his body visible when he said the name Cas. But he was just talking about his son, not his Cas.
"Never?" Castiel asked.
What's in the box?
Why did it have to be like this? They were supposed to write their own story, make their own ending. Chuck even let them believe it all those years ago.
"I didn't know you had another tattoo." Dean said as he traced the enochian words.
"Unless you have a problem with that."
As soon as Dean led Castiel out of the flat he took his hand. Castiel doesn't think he's ever blushed so hard in his life as he has tonight, but the way Dean looks at him makes it nearly impossible. Dean walked him downstairs and out to the parking lot behind the building complex. Dean kept glancing up at Castiel with a look of wonder on his face. Normally Dean is taller than Castiel by a few inches, but tonight as Cas is wearing four inch heels, Dean has to look up at him which only serves to make Castiel blush harder.
"I'm so happy for you, Cas." He smiled wrapping him in a tight hug.
"They tell me you're not real." He mumbled.
"Different how?" Dean asked.
"Ah..."
"What?!"
"What are you a stoner?" Dean chuckled.
"I'd like that." Dean said and before he could retract that glimmering statement of hope, Castiel cursed under his breath.
"Sam told me. Bipolar, right?"
Cas came in and cuddled up behind Dean, kissing the back of his neck softly. Dean sighed happily in the embrace of his angel before dozing off to sleep.
"Yeah." He said sitting up and turning the TV off. Dean walked into their bedroom and got ready for bed. He stripped nude because him and Cas usually sleep naked together and stalked to the bathroom following the usual routine. When he got out, Cas was already naked in bed under the covers, sketch book in hand.
"Of course, Dean."
"You sure? You know you can talk to me about any-"
"Dean," Cas moaned and everything snapped into the moment. The sensations catching up with him. The heat of his body, the tightness around him, the fingers digging into his back. It was so good. "Say it."
"Sorry I'm rusty." Castiel lied.
"Yes, Billie is no longer in this world." He said thoughtfully.
He blearily blinked his eyes open, smiling softly at Castiel as he took both of his hands and helped him up. It took Dean a moment to register that Cas wasn't wearing his sling.
Dean set about making coffee and even decided to make Castiel some pancakes from scratch. Castiel was still set about in his painting while Dean was dishing up the pancakes for the both of them. He cleaned up his mess before setting down the plate for Cas and himself at the kitchen table.
"Jesus, Cas," he chuckled breathlessly. "I don't think I've ever came that hard in my life." Castiel chuckled at the statement as well, the laugh vibrating through his chest.  His fingers traced Deans chest like electricity coursing through his veins.
"Okay..." Dean said confused.
"He made me keep it a secret!" Sam held his hands up in defense. "He thought that It'd freak you out and ruin your friendship. Of course it wouldn't have, but I still kept his secret... But it worked out right? You're like... boyfriends now?"
"Putain de pédés." He scoffed under his breath.
Sam and Eileen both mock "awwwed" and Dean rolled his eyes suppressing his blush. He took his coffee mug back from Cas and when he frowned, Dean ruffled his hair and got up to pour Cas a cup of his own coffee. He sat back down at the table and dug into his food along with the others. They ate mostly in silence and then Sam and Cas teamed up talking about the domino effect Dean had on Cas. All the way from the mission of having Dean and Sam being Michael and Lucifers vessels, him going against his brothers and sisters, falling and fighting a war with Raphael, even purgatory. All of it he did because of Dean.
"I am... why do you ask?" He asked confused.
"I grew up in Kansas." Dean snorted.
"Just painting my sketch from last night." Dean looked at Castiels face surprised to find a slight shade of blush there. He looked down at the watercolor painting and he quickly understood why.
"God, Cas you know what the French shit does to me..." Dean sighed
Dean and Cas have been home and together for a week now and things are getting interesting. They both somehow established that Dean is the little spoon even though he's a little grumpy about it. Cas does Deans laundry and makes him food and gives him kisses every time they're alone. Truly, Dean feels spoiled. Cas is so perfect and giving, Dean feels guilty because he hasn't done anything to deserve him.
"I'm different?" Dean asked hesitantly.
"Thinking about lover boy?" Gabe waggled his eyebrows.
"Well, yeah. What did he say?"
"Go fuck yourself." Dean muttered, flipping Sam off and ignoring his laughter as he left the kitchen. He walked back into the bedroom to find Cas propped up against the headboard, adjusting his sling. "Sorry it took so long," he smiled setting the plate down on Cas's lap. "Sam's an asshole."
"What are you talking about?"
Dean fell asleep feeling both content yet exposed. He had just been the most vulnerable he ever had been with Cas that evening. Opening up about his trauma wasn't something he did with just anyone, and opening up about his bipolar was something he never did. But Castiel had made him feel adored. Special. And he could only hope that things would stay that way.
Cas was surprised by how much he missed Dean. They had practically spent every waking minute together for the past month and even though he hadn't even been gone a week he found himself missing the way Dean smelled.
"I'm sorry." Dean sighed defeated.
The four of them sat in the living room each having at least once slice of the many pies Dean made. Castiel and Sam talked and bonded over their love for philosophy and old books while Dean tried to warm up to Gabriel. Gabe was a little too busy stuffing his face to talk which was fine with Dean as he would much prefer to watch Cas. The way his long fingers handle his fork, the way his pink tongue darts out to lick a stray bit of cherry pie. Dean tries not to think about all the places that tongue has been while in good company, but still finds more distracting thoughts looking at this angel like man in front of him. Cas only eats about two different slices of pie before he's full but he swears that they are amazing. Gabe however ate more than any of them could with a grand total of five pieces of pie.
"What do you want, Gabe?"
"It was the Impala, so semi public I guess."  Dean shrugged. "Cas why don't you go."
"Kinda sucks you broke up then, huh?"
"Friend of yours?"
"No."
"On our trip you are going to wear one of those every. Single. Day."
"How? I've never been here."
"Nothing. Just hurt my foot." He replied. Once the pain subsided he leaned down to pick up what he stepped on. It was a necklace, a weird one at that. It looked like some kind of demon or tiki but despite its creepy appearance, it felt calming. He knew immediately that it was Deans and quickly pulled out his phone.
"Sure thing, Diane." Dean cast her a glare as he took a hit of the pipe but Cas chimed in too.
"You're right," he sighed. "I don't want to date."
"Of course you would get every color of paint." Dean chuckled when he saw the paints and canvas spread across their bed.
"Can you get off me?" Dean laughed.
"You act like I'm a prize," he chuckled. "You got stuck with me cause I love you."
"Don't make me leave." He warned.
Dean crawled into bed and tucked up against Cas's side, nuzzling in cuddling and looking into the sketchbook. He couldn't quite tell what it was about yet. There were two sets of hands holding each others over top of one another. Both hands had wedding rings on them, and down in the bottom corner there was a sketch of the rings by themselves. One was a plain band, nothing on it. The other had groves on it and was engraved with something he couldn't read in the dim light of the room. Cas looked over at Dean for a moment and Dean smiled up at him. He closed the sketchbook and set it to the side before leaning down and kissing Dean softly.
So. Much. Yelling.
"What?" Both Sam and Dean said in unison.
Dean shot him a confused glance at him but couldn't help but smile at Castiels. Castiel held up a finger as of to signal just a minute before continuing.
"Don't even worry about it. Here," he said walking to bring Cas the cup of coffee. "Breakfast will be done in just a moment, why don't you take a seat out on the balcony?" He punctuated with a kiss on Castiels temple.
Dean slept in Castiels flat that night. Maybe he was desperate but he loved the way Cas smelled. Like cream pastries and wine with that always there hint of marijuana. He looked through some of Castiels sketchbooks smiling at the cute sketches of angels and cats. Adorable doodles that remind Dean so much of why he likes him. His personality. He goes through two sketchbooks of angels and animals and even one full of flowers and different kinds of bees. By the time he gets to the other ones he still flushes pink at the nude portraits of himself. Not even all of them show his face, but it is so evidently him that it almost makes him chuckle. The fact that Castiel knows his body so well he can sketch it and full multiple books with the details even getting the patterns of Deans freckles right. Deep down he considers that he knows Castiels body that well too. Every sinuous muscle movement seared into his memory. Every tattoo like a fleeting touch on his body.
He sighed to himself before getting a rag and cleaning it up. Once all the glass was thrown in the trash, Sam came and mopped up the milk while Dean sat at the table trying to remember how to breathe. Hell, how to function like a normal human being.
"Well, I'm alive at the moment, so I'm good." Dean and Cas suddenly felt sad by the remembrance that this would probably be the last time they would see him. "No, don't cry over me. I swear, anyone who even thinks about crying at my funeral is getting an ass whooping from the grave."
"I didn't say you were pathetic, but-"
"Because I have to move out remember? December eleventh I have to go back to Kansas."
"Stop," he mumbled sheepishly.
"Are you on medication for it? Because if you are and it's not working, maybe you should talk to your pharmacist. Get something that will help you. I don't want you to be scared anymore."
Castiel was officially his boyfriend.
"Well at least your getting laid again."
"Dean," Cas said , a little out of breath.
"But he's not... Dead. Just in the empty. We can get him back, death hasn't got him yet. He's just stuck."
Even after Dean came and was trying to catch his breath, Castiel sucked him clean until he was to sensitive. Deans mind was in a haze all the endorphins and dopamine rushing through his system in the after glow. He hardly even realized that Castiel was working himself over Dean. Dean opened his eyes just enough to see, still in a haze. Castiels mouth was parted as he let out little gasps and pants. His eyes were dark and hooded looking down at Deans body. Dean sat up on the bed and took Castiels wrist off of his member and started to work him himself.
The smell of the water was placating. Dean closed his eyes and just breathed for a moment. When he opened his eyes he had to adjust to the brightness of the cool sun in the water. He looked over at a group of little kids playing in the sand and smiled to himself. He watched them for a moment before far off his eyes caught the attention of someone else. He could have sworn he saw Cas. But when he looked again, he was gone. Like he just vanished. And suddenly the beach was no longer calming. He sighed and took his phone out of his back pocket and checked the message.
"I think you should wear it more often," Dean said with a hit on mischief in his eyes. "Although with those boots, you will be the death of me."
"What? Why?" Sam asked, mouthful of his salad.
"Yes. I do. Pain is how hard you're squeezing my hand right now."
"Yeah." Sam sniffled. Dean smiled at the two of them before turning back into the fridge to pull out a beer.
Dean took a sip of wine hissing as the alcohol warmed his throat while Castiel made his way to the couch. Castiel opened his little box and pulled out his stash while Dean watched.
"Who?" Castiel whispered.
"Is it the medication?"
"Yeah I think so."
"Dude! Have you seen the way he looks at you? Like he's always looked at you? Not to mention, aside from his business trip, when's the last night you slept alone in your own bed?"
"It makes so much sense." Jody said mouth gaping. "I mean, I always thought you were a bit... fruity."
"Angel," he panted. "You gonna get out of your clothes?" He smiled. Castiel pulled away and did his best to shimmy out of his clothes quickly while Dean went and started up the shower. He got in first and smirked when Cas hissed at the heat of the spray.
Why would Dean throw this away? He thought.
Cas didn't respond after a moment and when he turned around, Cas was still sitting up, fidgeting nervously.
"The one and only. I told you I was coming over. Don't you ever check your phone?"
"Thanks, Cas." He said finally. Castiel walked him to the door and Dean kissed him on the cheek goodbye before he left. Castiel felt a little sad once he was alone again but he needed to brush that feeling off. Fun time was over.
"Emotional intimacy turns me on." Dean smirked.
"Can we just go to bed? I don't want to think about it right now." Dean sniffled
Castiel didn't feel angry, he just felt sad. Why would Dean lie about this? Why would he hide this? Does he not know he can trust Castiel with anything? He sighed clenching the bottle tight in his hand before walking out to the living room. He hadn't even realized but he was a little shaky and his stomach was in all kinds of knots. Does this mean Dean still sees things? Suddenly it all added up.
"Don't 'sir' me," he chuckled. "I'm too old for that shit. So, Cas, what are your intentions with my son?"
"What does this say?" Dean asked kissing the weird scrawl along Castiels lower abdomen.
"God Dean, I'm so sorry."
"Yeah. He was afraid of moving back to Kansas and not seeing Gabe, so Gabe just told him to move in."
"I love it, Cas. You're really talented."
"You showered before hand."
Dean sped all the way back to the motel, not even bothering to clean their stuff from the fridge. They packed their duffles and tossed them back into the Impala before the long drive back. Dean was tired from lack of sleep over the past three weeks, but he still drove all fourteen hours back to Lebanon, Kansas, speeding the whole way there.
"Is Adam your half brother?"
"Yes. Seeing as how we've done this more than one night. Also none of my French boys have ever made me breakfast before. And I certainly haven't let them fuck me on my kitchen island." He chuckled.
"I had been working on that for weeks. One night with you and I got it done in an hour. Every night you spend here I just... I get inspired again and I don't know why. I've been trying to tell myself I can't date, I don't want to. But to be honest I don't really even know what I want. I do know one thing though."
"I got you coffee and a bear claw. If you don't want that I could make you something, but I'm afraid we're low on groceries. I haven't gotten the chance to go to the store and I-"
"No I wouldn't have. Especially if I knew you were going to drown yourself in alcohol because of it."
On the last day of his visit Castiel spent most of the day in his hotel room that Gabe paid for texting Dean and sending pictures back and forth. Cas hadn't been able to take his eyes off of the pictures of Dean in the panties and in his free time he already ordered a package for more in different colors to be delivered by the time he got home.
"What about you Dean? Tell me about your exes." He chuckled.
"Shoot."
"Shut up." Dean chuckled.
"Are you saying I'm old?" Dean teased. Cas rolled his eyes and Dean pinched his sides. "Thanks for inviting me out here. This is nice."
"Well, luckily for you Dean," Castiel said as he moved his hand up to the back of his neck. "I am." And just like that Castiels lips were on his.
"He's right." Dean smiled coming out of the kitchen to sit next to Castiel. "But I'm afraid it's not going to be the turkey and gravy meal. More or less you guys taste testing my pies."
"Yeah well," Cas snapped his hips forward making Dean moan loudly. "I've never felt anything like this before. Fuck seemed like a fitting word." He breathed heavily.
"I'll think about it..." Dean whispered.
"Dean-o can you give us some privacy?" Gabe asked and when Dean turned around Sam was kissing Gabriel's neck.
"If I tell you, promise not to tell Cas?"
"You're not getting our souls. Sorry kiddo." Dean shrugged.
"Then what? I stay locked in here until you need me?"
"Gabe?" Castiel asked.
Just you and me.
"I- fuck- I love you. God, I love you." And just like that Castiel was clenching down and coming all at once with a wanton moan that Dean had never heard from him before.
"Round two?" Sam asked.
"I don't understand. It's just numbers. Fifteen, eighteen and twenty."
"Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. My muse." He sighed into Deans shoulder. Dean kissed the top of his head as warmth spread through his chest.
Dean obliged and took a swig of the water before sighing. Cas popped out the Xanax and Dean took them all at once downing half the water bottle with it. A bit of water dripped from the corner of his mouth and Cas pressed his thumb to catch the stray droplets, dragging the water on his bottom lip.
"Yeah. I'm pretty sure my Dad had it too. But when I would start to feel scared or overwhelmed by it, my Mom would sing The Beetles or something to me."
"Oui."
Later that night they were awoken by a crying baby. Three times.
"No," Dean chuckled.
People started arriving early in the morning, and by four in the evening, the bunker was crowded with their friends and chosen family. Of course people had questioned why they were all invited to the bunker, but of course Dean just responded simply with: "it's a surprise for later" making everyone a little more than irritated. Sam helped Dean cook food and they made burgers on the grill for everyone. Once everyone arrived, the sun was set golden in the sky nearing the end of summer and Dean suggested that they eat outside. There was a grove of trees along a hill near the bunker and Sam and Cas carried out the picnic tables for everyone to eat and talk at.
"I'm intrigued. Now what has been your inspiration for that? Are you religious?"
Cas had mentioned that Gabe was rich, but he didn't expect this. The place was much larger than Dean anticipated for a beach home. It was fully furnished with all white and black modern furniture. There was a large flatscreen in every room and at least fourteen pillows on each bed. And of course because it was Gabriel's place, the house was decadent with nude statues, sculptures, paintings and even random nicknacks of men and women, some even actually fucking. Dean just laughs to himself about it before going into the master suite and starting to unpack.
"I will."
Dean quietly stripped out of his clothes until he was in nothing but his boxers before he quietly crawled into bed. He didn't want to wake Cas, but he was tired too. Once he pulled up the covers and got in it was so warm and inviting. He knew this was where he belonged. Castiels eyes moved behind his eyelids and Dean couldn't help but smile. He pulled the blankets more over him and scooted close enough to kiss his forehead. When he pulled away, Cas jumped awake suddenly scared at the intrusion.
"Bonjour messieurs. Pourrais-je t'intéresser au champagne?"
"Yes. That," Cas said sitting legs crossed on the floor with her. "Is a dedication page. I wrote the book for you."
Castiel didn't even need Dean to specify before he responded in an amused manor.
"Are you sure he's real? How do you know he's not one of us?"
"I wouldn't let you do it if I didn't like it. It's definitely different from topping, much more raw and sensual. But yes, I enjoy it."
"No it's not. If you would like me to get a matching tattoo with you, I would certainly do it."
"Cas?"
"Are you sure? I don't want you to feel like you have to,"
Dean had been curious for some time now about all the little noises and faces Castiel makes when Dean fucks him. Been curious about what it felt like. Castiel had offered to let Dean try it and that in itself was exciting last night, but after seeing this drawing... hell he felt downright impatient for Cas. He always craves Castiel, craves him like a drug. Cas is an addiction he can't beat, but this is something raw and new that Dean wants to give to Castiel. If not for himself, than just for Cas.
Still Dean kept reading. He read all of them until tears dropped onto the letters, smudging the ink with the salt of his tears. Soon all that was left was one more. The one he'd gotten today.
"You can't afford me." Dean smirked wrapping his arms around Cas's middle.
The three of them headed into the living room and Dean and Cas watched in amusement as she smiled at all of her presents. The last present she opened was Cas's latest book called The Righteous Man. Dean already knew the book was about them and their love story; when he'd read the draft, he'd cried and practically smothered him in kisses. But there was something special to the hard bound of the book that was both a surprise to Dean and Samantha. The cover art depicted what was Deans shoulder and placed on that was a red imprint of not Cas's handprint, but hers. It was very intricate and special made to tie the three of them together. Samantha made the connection right away and ran up, hugging Cas around his hips.
"Assbutt?" Cas shrugged and Dean kissed him again deeply. They kissed with bright smiles on their faces before it melted into something more serious. In a matter of minutes, Castiel had Dean pinned to the counter grinding his thigh against Dean while licking into his mouth.
"Yeah I know."
"Okay." Sam sighed. They drove back to the small flat Dean rented in silence. Dean couldn't help but think about last night the whole way there however.
"Alright boys, save it for the honeymoon."
"Yeah?"
"So is that why you invited us all out here?" Garth asked.
"Cas!" Was the last word on Deans tongue before he felt like he lost the inability to speak. For a moment of post coital bliss- as Cas would call it- his limbs were shaking with his orgasm and he couldn't move. Castiel of course, didn't seem to mind. Dean sat up and tried to pull himself off. Once he flopped back onto the bed next to his boyfriend his thighs were sore and he realized probably cramped as well. He hissed for a moment before closing his eyes and relaxing.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean gasped harshly.
"Not at all... actually mind if I join you?"
"Like he's grown up for one. Almost like he's numb. He forced me to come back here while he finished his work."
slight alcoholism. I tried to make it better
His mouth was like water after being dehydrated. It felt like fire in his bones and bile in his stomach. It was like tears in his eyes and like every part of him that once came from a dead star, was alive again. Time stopped, he let it sweep him away until Cas started to kiss him back. His lips conquered him and he gladly surrendered.  He dissolved into the angel until they became one. He could escape the world and hide in that moment with just the barest brush of their lips and the barely slick touch of their tongues. It was as if Castiels lips were shelter, as if they wanted to know all the places Dean had been hurt, so they could take it all away. And Dean let him.
"No."
God you are amazing.
"You- he gave you his blessing?" Dean felt more tears now.
"Gladly." He snapped his fingers and the Empty's form started to wear away. Melting back into the darkness as she screamed. Soon it was just the five of them. Jack ran towards Cas and huddled close towards him, not quite hugging or touching, but Dean knew for comfort. Cas was more of a father to Jack than Lucifer. He was just glad everything was okay.
"Looked at those pictures, you have no idea what you do to me, do you?"
I’m so fcking sorry for this one...
Anything for you.
"Anything. Yeah I know, all do respect I'm not going to discuss the effects of my sex life with my brother." Dean said not even thinking. Sam nearly broke the plate he was drying when Dean said that.
"You don't know anything about how I felt about him. And what part of there's no way to get him back don't you get?"
"You're insistence that everything is fine is not particularly becoming."
"I want to be yours. Have for a long time. I want to belong to you."
"You better come." Dean said voice hoarse.
"So what the hell you boys been up to?" Jody asked.
"Deans been taking it hard too. I mean he's been- I don't even know if I should tell you."
"I'm going to tuck her in, then I'm going to tuck you in too. Don't worry, she'll still be here in the morning." Dean sighed with a smile before getting up too. Dean walked towards their bedroom while Cas put her in her freshly decorated nursery.
Better than porn.
"Hm?"
"Why are you all dressed up?" Sam asked, a knowing smile on his face.
"Ah yes I've heard it before," Castiel acknowledged before singing attempting to sing it. "Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, tomorrow I'll miss you,"
"Hm?"
"Tonight, honeybee."
"I know." He said taking a sip from his coffee.
Castiel blushed and looked down as he spoke. "Said that you were a dumbass and that you'd come crawling back."
"I um... Kind of. I mean I went to college back in Lawrence. I've always wanted to be a chef so I decided to get some culture and started school a little later."
"Please- I love you."
"Or what?! You gonna kick me out? Throw me out for kissing my goddamn boyfriend?" Dean scoffed before turning around and pulling Cas with him, their book long forgotten. Once they made it onto the street Castiel turned to him.
"How did Cassie here manage to pull you in?"
"You can't ignore him forever, you know." Sam sighed.
"Richa- wait... the art dealer from Paris?"
Short thereafter, both of them were pleasantly loose and sated from their orgasms. Deans stomach grumbled loud enough that both of them laughed and Castiel suggested that they order something to eat. It was still far too early to go to bed and too soon to go for round to, so they just talked while they waited for food. Dean had noticed over the past month of sleeping together, he was less and less afraid to touch Cas. Not just sensual touches but friendly and gentle, but more than anything... intimate.
That's how it was supposed to be. Dean couldn't hold back anymore and buried his face in his hands and cried a silent sob. He didn't stay there for long though, since he couldn't explain why he was crying if Sam or Eileen happened to walk back in. He moved to his bedroom still crying and opened his closet door.
"Yes. We're from Kansas." Gabriel answered.
"Being adorable assholes is what." Sam hollered from the grill. Jody gave them a questioning look and Dean rolled his eyes at his brother before answering.
Cas nodded and turned to the dresser opening the wrong drawer and first and finding the right one on the second try. He pulled out a pair of Deans baggy, navy blue sweatpants and a Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirt. He stiffly tossed off his trench coat, glancing as Dean crawled into the bed. Dean didn't want to make Cas uncomfortable, but he couldn't help but look a little. Cas turned around when he stripped off his suit slacks and put on the sweatpants that were just a little looser than they were on Dean. He turned back when he started to unbutton his shirt, forgetting about his tie and they both chuckled when it got stuck on his jaw. The planes of his body were beautiful, and even though he should feel guilty about being so in awe at him, he just couldn't. He was a little sad when the shirt came on, covering all those delicious muscles and that loved soft tummy. But the smile Cas gave him as he straightened up, was completely worth it.
"Cas?" Nothing.
"I hate you." Dean muttered.
"Who was Lee?"
"What does the book say?" Sam asked.
Dean needed to be more careful. He'd known for sometime now that he loved Cas, but he feared it was still too soon. They had barely been in an actual relationship a month. Still he couldn't control the flutter he felt every time Castiel looked at him. Every time he kissed him. Painted him. Made love to him. Every single thing about Castiel was perfect and Dean couldn't even feel guilty about feeling the way he did. He wasn't going to say it again until he was sure Castiel was ready, but he knew in his heart. He was in love with Castiel Novak.
"When Meg came over, you said you were on disability. What are you on disability for?" Cas asked curiously.
"Nothing, just your tattoo. That's- fuck that's hot." Castiel didn't blush or turn from his gaze like Dean would have, he just smirked confidently and turned back around.
Cas expected Dean to be different on the meds, and he was but not in the way he was thinking. Dean was for the first time in a while, enthusiastic. Happy seeming, even. They lived in the domesticity of their new arrangements and routines, building a life around each other. They wake up, Dean usually made breakfast. Then they'd shower, more often times together before Dean headed out for school. Castiel would paint and make phone calls until he got home and then they would eat dinner and cuddle on the couch with bad television. Before bed, Cas would wash his face while Dean got in the routine of taking his meds every night before they hopped into bed together. Castiel couldn't ask for anything more really. Even though they hadn't really had sex since Dean got on the meds again, he couldn't ask for that. Deans nightmares weren't haunting him and he was feeling better, so that was all Castiel could ever hope for.
Not twenty minutes after Dean left, there was a knock on his door. Castiel got up from the couch and walked over to the entry way to open it.
Are you mine?
He stepped out onto the balcony in the darkness. There was enough light from the city beyond and the moon that he was able to make out the drawings just fine.
"Shhh!" She scolded and Dean laughed a little.
"Bitch."
He and Allen were fairly close, and whenever John was off hunting some fang, Dean would go spend time with him. He told himself he just liked him as a friend but the truth was, Allen peaked his interest far more than a friend. He had black curly hair that desperately needed cut much like Sam's. He had soft honey brown eyes with round framed glasses. He looked much older than he was in truth. As much as he always wanted to be alone with Allen, he didn't trust Sam to be by himself. So he'd taken Sammy to the bowling alley with them and he was inside playing with the other kids just a little older than Sam. Dean managed to trick Allen into having a cigarette. Dean had stollen a pack of menthols from a connivence store that morning.
"Partially. But come on. We were kids. That was ages ago. We're completely different people now, it's time we move on."
"You had fun though." Castiel smiled.
"Dean, you're a grown man. You can make your own decisions. A time ago I would've been pissed, but now I just want you to be happy. Whatever that comes in."
oh glorious smut
"No, what?"
"Yes. I'm make art."
The two of them stared out at the skyline for a while before Dean spoke again.
"So how's, Sam?" Castiel asked as a distraction.
And that just made it so much harder to understand why he lied.
"Don't be nervous, Dean. It's just us remember?" Castiel walked over to the nightstand and pulled out a new bottle of lube and fresh strip of condoms that he had needed to restock on after their last rendezvous together. Castiel, as always, meticulously stripped his clothes folding each item, partial to him being an organized freak, but also to be a tease. By the time Cas was finally naked he crawled into the bed and straddled the backs of Deans thighs. Dean was a little tense at the first movement but then sighed as Cas slowly started to massage him.
"What do you know about auras?"
Dean broke down into tears. He'd never heard Castiel cry. Ever. And now all he could imagine were those beautiful blue eyes being shot and red as tears flowed from them. All because of him. He wanted to go back home. As far as he could tell his medication experiment was working, but what if something happened again? What if the next time he had an episode,  what if that was the time he snapped? What if all those voices telling him nothing he loves is real, telling him the only way to be sure is to experience death, what if he listened? Castiel would be the one to find him. Cas would be the one who would have to find his dead body, and it would be in their home, forever tainting it.
He popped the cap and kissed down Deans jaw to nip at his earlobe causing his whole body to shiver. He left little love bites and kisses along his chest and shoulders enough to distract Dean for the moment. Dean whimpered as the first press of the pad of his finger circled his entrance. Castiel smiled to himself, buried in Deans neck. He slowly worked his finger in, the ring of muscles involuntary clenching down onto his finger. By the time he was thrusting his pointer finger in and out, he cautiously added a second one. He worked slowly taking his time to stretch and scissor Dean open and was loving all the little noises Dean made as he added a third.
"Fuck you Dean. You're like my best friend and you don't get to disappear just because you saw something you didn't like."
"I loved you..." he choked out into the jacket. "And you left me. I loved you so much, and because of that you're gone. Why did you leave me?"
"No." He said flipping to the next page.
"Look I don't have time to go out and find a piece of ass every other night okay? Sex is great but constantly finding a one night stand is... it's grating."
"Ah speak of the devil," Gabe said pulling out his phone. "My prince calls for me." Gabe pulled on his coat slapping some money on the table as Castiel got up as well.
"I didn't really know who to talk to, since I can't tell Sam. Not yet at least. I figured you were the safest to talk to at the moment."
"So the art show takes place from the twenty ninth to the second of January. Don't worry about hotel expenses, I've got you covered."
"Well, we need to stop him." Dean said seriously. "Obviously you're back, so Jack is just walking into a death trap."
"Not planning to kill me out here, right?" Dean chuckled.
Hey. You two lovebirds gonna get up? I made breakfast.
"Thank you for coming out, Charlie. It means a lot to us." Cas said while Dean tried to discreetly wipe away his tears.
Dean was a bit nervous. There was at least two thousand people in the crowd and although most of them were LGBTQ affiliated, he was still nervous. He walked up the steps a shy smile on his face.
"Nope. Test comes back in four more days. You can wait that long."
Dean comes over to Castiels Wednesday night since he doesn't have school on Thursdays. Castiel is in a much better mood than he had been Sunday evening when he gets there. In fact Cas is in such a good mood that Dean just barely gets his key out of the lock before Castiel is attacking him in a breathtaking kiss.
"What?"
"Okay... what is it son?"
"Yeah. I would've said the same thing a few months ago, now I don't know."
"Yes. My sister Anna was always indecipherable. I never really knew her well. Gabriel and I were always the closest even though he is a royal asshat. And my youngest sibling, Hannah- I mean Henri. Henri is transgender. My parents were much less fond of that than my homosexuality, but I love my siblings, despite what my parents say."
"Hm?"
"I know, I know."
They started playing and soon Eileen and Cas had the least amount of cards. Dean made Sam have to draw four and laughed when his brother flipped him the bird. Eileens pile soon stacked and Sam's too. Dean was left with three cards and he thought he could win. Cas only had two cards left and Dean was scared at the mischievous glint in his eyes.
"Yes." Dean sighed.
"Deal. Now take a shower you wreak like skunk." Castiel flipped him off as he opened the French door shutters to his bedroom and stepped into his fairly large bathroom. He took a quick shower while he assumed that Gabriel was probably raiding his pantry. Once he got out he tried to dress somewhat nice. He picked out a black turtleneck and paired it with some grid patterned dress pants. He took a look in the mirror and tried to tame his hair but to no avail before he just gave up. He threw on a leather coat and grabbed his keys and wallet before meeting Gabriel in the entryway.
"No I mean it. You are. Feel free to paint me anytime." He smiled and kissed Cas on the cheek before he stepped into the kitchen. "Coffee?" He asked.
"Like angel crap." Dean supplied. Cyrus made a face of understanding.
"I think... I think I need to talk to Sam." Dean said looking at Cas. Dean knew Cas understood what he meant and nodded.
"Like what?"
"I guess it has a little." Dean realized. "It didn't affect me much before, but that was years ago, and to be fair, I didn't have a smokin' hot piece of ass in my bed every night." Dean winked trying to make light out of the conversation.
"Cried. Drank. Tried to draw. Cried some more. Drunk called you. Called your Dad a sobbing mess. Drank some more."
"No. I noticed you looked sad. You want to talk to someone?"
The next warehouse was much cleaner and hadn't been abandoned as long, maybe fifteen years max. The place used to be an old lumber mill and based on the constant creeks and groans of the old metal, the two wouldn't have been surprised if the place was haunted. There wasn't any particular supernatural item. Nothing to indicate that Balthazar's collection was in the place, which is part of the reason why they looked harder. When Balthazar was alive he was a pompous ass who would have tricked you into believing one thing, when really it was another. In many ways he was like Gabriel, a trickster. They searched the place high and low but they didn't find anything. Just when they were on their way out of the old building, Deans eye caught something.
"Kelly?"
The past few months have been fantastic. Dean and Cas have practically been fucking like rabbits and Dean is finally motivated to work on his cooking. It's nearing the middle of November now so Dean is cooking constantly. He enjoys the cooking part, where he can experiment and add things as he goes; it's the baking he can't stand. For a guy who loves sweets, pies and pastries, he hates how the segment in school with baking is so specific and too the point there's really no room to improvise. But alas he still gets through it with a passing grade that he is super stoked about.
"...So tell me." Sam pleaded. "You know you can tell me anything right?"
Castiels eyes widened comically and Dean would've thought he was about to reject him before a wide grin spread across his face.
"What?" He scoffed turning his face to try and look at Sam. "We're not breaking up. Not if I have anything to say about it."
"Yeah?"
He can't help but feel a little guilty about Dean. But why should he feel guilty about Dean? He and Dean aren't together. And Cas and Inias aren't together either. But regardless there is a voice in the back of his mind that says two of these men at once can only end badly.
"Are we sure about this?" Sam looked nervous, sure, but he nodded stiffly his contentment. Without another word, Dean unlocked the door. He handed Sam the bowl of ingredients before stepping inside. The place was still the cool white, like a doctors office, but filled to the brim with stark black bookshelves filed in alphabetical order. He walked in and quietly pocketed the key as Sam followed behind him.
Castiel goes pliant in his arms. He knows he should breathe, to break off for air, but he can't find it in himself to stop kissing Dean. Deans hands slid up Castiels sides rucking up his shirt as he trails kisses down his jaw. Castiel managed to pull his sweater off only having Deans lips off of him for a moment. Deans hands are strong. Thick muscular hands with calloused fingers. They roam all over his body with firm but gentle finesse and it takes Castiel a moment to realize Dean is searching out for his tattoos.
"I don't mind at all. I haven't got to celebrate thanksgiving since I was sixteen. Kind of miss it." Castiel blushed when Deans eyes swept over him. God he's so cute. And on a second thought Dean certainly doesn't. One quick look down at his flour covered shirt and he was up in an instant.
"I love you." She said. Sam looked at her shocked but kissed her again. "I love you too." He responded. As much as Dean wanted to slap his brother and pick on him, right now was not the time. The three of them headed to the basement and slowly unlocked the door that lead in to Deaths library. They crept in slowly being sure to be careful. They heard Death whistling that same tune they day he went to go get Cas and followed the noise.
"You- you did?" Dean just shook his head and stood up, headache still throbbing in his skull. He walked out of his bedroom leaving Sam in there all alone.
"That may be the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say."
"Oh wonderful. And please, call me Balthazar."
"Anything." Dean asked nosing at Cas's cheek.
"So you say something you've never done,  and if another person has done it, they have to take a drink. The goal is to get the other people to finish their drinks before you do." Cas explained.
"It's okay, I bought some more. Don't want those pretty locks being dry now would I?"
He hopped into the Impala and started her up. The second the car turned on Zepp started to play through the speakers. Normally he wouldn't think much of it, but he remembered the first time he showed Cas this specific song and how he laughed with Dean as they headed off to hunt a vamp nest. It stung bitter in his gut and his eyes threatened to tear up again but no. He changed the radio to Black Sabbath and started to blast it as he drove off. If he was going to face his feelings, he refused to cry anymore over Castiel. Even though it would likely happen again.
"Really?"
"Are you in love with Sam?" Castiel smiled and Gabe blushed.
"It is not of import." Cas slurred into Deans shoulder.
"No this isn't my 'car', this is my baby. She's a nineteen sixty seven Chevrolet Impala."
Dean walked down the stairs of the flat feeling like he was walking on a cloud. If Dean had any doubts about his sexuality before last night, they were now certainly gone. Castiel was something else with his beautiful blue eyes and luscious dark locks. He made it out onto the street where Sam was waiting for him. He looked both ways before crossing the street to his brothers crappy car.
Castiel took a deep breath and sat back on his couch. He pointedly ignored the pill bottle and the envelope on the table and instead looked around inside their flat.
"Not in detail no... but school is riding my ass and my piece of shit dad keeps sending me letters. I just need a break." He said the last part on a broken chuckle. Castiel finished pouring two glasses of wine before walking out to the living room.
"Okay." Castiel didn't look remorseful, just understanding. Dean wanted to ask if he should go on new medication, or if they should at least try to have sex. He wanted to ask if Castiel missed sex, or if he was unhappy with not having any. But he couldn't ask any of it right now. It didn't feel right. He knew deep down the meds had to have been affecting his libido, because even when Cas was naked in front of him he didn't lust they way he used to. Sure he still thought he was the sexiest thing on two legs, but he didn't feel the need to have Castiel with him in that way. Un rushed and unheated and so very unfamiliar. He decided then that maybe if he stopped taking the meds right then and there that things could go back to normal. That he and Castiel could touch each other in that way again.
You'll find out tomorrow. Don't you dare peek.
There was a bit of silence from everyone and Deans nerves were singing before Bobby came and wrapped him in a hug. Soon after, everyone else came and hugged him or patted him on the back telling him that they're proud of him. Lastly, Cas leaned in close and kissed him tenderly and sweet on the lips.
"Dean?"
"Have you ever smoked pot before?" Castiel asked.
Thump.
"Why? Why is it Pick On Dean Day?"
"I think everything you make is good, Dean. But yes, this pie is very good. I'm so proud of you." Cas said and leaned in to peck his lips.
"I'm holding out on you." Dean grinned.
Before he could change his mind, he pulled Cas's shirt over his head and started kissing the bare skin. Kissing at his neck and chest. Hot open mouthed kisses along his shoulder and sternum. There was simplicity in the way the curve of his collarbone caught the gleam of the warm motel room light. Dean could see the scars in his skin, thin white lines from torture and it made him ache. He kissed each scar he could see as if trying to take away that pain. He stopped just to look into Castiels eyes, both of them breathless. Dean didn't think he had ever been more aroused in his life and tried to dive back into kissing him.But before Dean could, Cas stopped the movements of his own hands, hips and lips and he looked back at Dean a little breathless.
Dean fluttering around him after the exhaustion of it all was enough to push Castiel over the edge and he came buried deep inside Dean with a loud groan. He pulled out quickly, not wanting to take to long with Dean still being oversensitive. He tossed the condom in the garbage can before collapsing back onto the bed. Castiel rolled onto his side to look at Dean and his face furrowed with concern to see that his cheeks were wet.
"Who's the last person you dated? Hmm..."
"You know, I think I'd like to see this new ink in the dark." He smirked.
"You need to get laid, Castiel. Someone had to say it."
Having a kid sure was a struggle, but luckily they had each other and managed to do it. Jack was such a sweet kid and Castiel woke up every day thinking how five years ago he was a jobless, single painter with a minor drinking problem. Lonely and poor with nothing in his life worth living for. And now Cas has a successful career he loves. He matters. Castiel Novak is a husband, a lover, a friend, and his new favorite thing, a father.
"Would you maybe... never mind." Dean brushed it off. Asking that was too much. They had only been together for a little over seven months.
"Oh um... thank you." Dean looked over at Castiel and Cas shot him a bright smile. Dean turned the laptop so they were both in shot. "Dad there's someone I want you to meet. This is... this is my boyfriend."
"I'm adorable and you know it.
"You're such a sap," Gabe scoffed drinking his mimosa. "I'm glad you're happy though."
"Not 'baby', it's Dean."
"Jack. I know I- I'm probably getting annoying. But please, please bring him back. He's like your father too y'know, so... just please. I can't- I can't live without..." he sighed and trailed off. He didn't know how to finish that sentence. And to be honest, he didn't know if he could force himself to say it out loud.
"Oui m'dame. Pouvons-nous aussi avoir de l'eau?" Castiel responded.
"Told you, you were a bad influence." Sam laughed.
Once everyone got their burgers and beers served up, the questions started rolling.
Dean was something else.
"Oh shut it." Dean grumbled. "And it turns out, he's less of a morning person than me."
"Don't be so modest, he's going to be the next up and coming artist. Historians are going to know his name." Cas rolled his eyes. "Seriously, he's getting an all expense paid trip to Birmingham to sell his art. And boy, is he selling."
"Jack, I don't know what's gotten into you, but we can fix this. Just come home with us." Sam pleaded.
"Alright. Can I see you Sunday night? I'd like to take you out again."
"Told Cas, what?"
"Sure, why not? What did you have in mind?"
"In a second. I don't think I could swallow it right now if I tried."

Tomorrow. I left a little brown box in the bottom of my closet. Tomorrow I want you to put it on and send me a picture.
With Thanksgiving approaching, Dean is contemplating inviting Cas over for dinner. He knows he's already going to be cooking for Sam and him, but he thinks it might be fun. Sam was already talking about having Gabe join them anyways. Sam keeps nagging him and urging him to ask Castiel out, but to be honest he thinks it might complicate things. The sex is great- hell best of his life- but relationships complicate everything. Cas is a great guy and if he put his heart on his sleeve, he's afraid the same thing will happen that did last time.
"I'm the bride?" He looked at both of them and they said: "Yes." At the exact same time. "Says the one wearing a dress!"
"Dean, you know you can talk to me about anything right?" Castiel said finally taking a seat on the end of the bed.
"I know a guy. His names Crowley. He's done all of my tattoos, but one I think."
As Castiel walked home, he thought to himself about love and all the things that could mean for him. When he made it to his apartment he started a new painting, one with wings and halos and a piercing pair of emerald green eyes.
"Morning." He finally rasped.
Suddenly he felt a tap on his shoulder and Dean looked up to see Death. Dean didn't know why he trusted him to wake Cas up, but he did. Dean moved out of the way slightly, one hand still gripped tight to the lapel of his trench coat. Death leaned down close to him and in a flash he pulled out an angel blade. He sliced a small insert under his chin before Dean yelled and pushed him away.
Dean rolled his eyes but didn't let up his grip. Pamela was tattooing him and Crowley was tattooing Cas. Crowley was actually British and Pam was German but spoke English. She was in the process of putting the stencil on his chest right over his heart.
"Kiss me?"
Inias and Castiel were each others firsts and at the time it was great. Their relationship was fun and incredible. They snuck out and went to parties together, or they would sneak into each others bedrooms in the middle of the night for some secretive quiet sex. It felt good to be rebellious, after all Cas was the good kid in the family. His brother Gabe had moved out once he turned eighteen and left for Paris to be a film director. Castiel was left being the oldest again which meant he had responsibilities. He went to church every Sunday, Bible study every Wednesday even though he didn't consider himself the religious type like his parents.
"Sammy my bipolar has been fine for years. I just stopped wasting money on meds so I could focus on school."
"Yeah! I mean- just if you ever need a little release I would be more than happy to partake in um... that." Castiel couldn't help but chuckle at the blush that spread across Deans cheeks.
"Cas? I hope you can hear me, because I need to talk to you." He looked at the end of the chain in his hand and clenched his eyes in disappointment that it wasn't glowing. "You hear me? We're not done with that conversation. I didn't get to finish. There's a lot of things that I need to say, a lot of wrongs I need to right, but I need you to come home to me." His hands felt a little warm and there was the faintest glow from the chain and he smiled in victory.
"...Because I'm afraid." He sighed again before rubbing a hand over his face. She seemed surprised but still kept quiet.
"I don't-"
"Thank you, Sam. We can't thank you enough." Cas said.
"Psst," Gabriel said tapping Castiels shoulder. "lookie, lookie over there." He pointed to the small lounge area where two handsome young men were sitting.
"Dean said he doesn't want to try anything new. He says they work for him, and maybe they do. It's just... frustrating."
"Goodnight, Dean." He heard the barest whisper of Cas's voice. He shot up and looked around, but realized he must've just imagined it. A gallon of coffee, non stop reading up until four am will do that to you. Still he tried to ignore the ache he felt in his chest as he realized, Cas wasn't there. He sighed and laid back heavily in his bed. He closed his eyes and despite his mind being ready for action, his body was not. It felt like a relief to close his dry and sore eyes from crying. His mind kept racing with constant thoughts, until they started to become random and no longer make sense before eventually, his body slipped off into sleep.
"You're not a ginger so I don't think so." Cas chuckled. "Why do you think he's hot?"
"Maybe skirts aren't condusive for November." Castiel chuckled as soon as the got in the door.
"Uh, sure." He said still confused. People know his art? He was in a news paper? Wait- he had fans? "Um- do you have a pen or something I could write on?"
"So, are you gonna tell us her name or what?" Donna asked crossing her arms. Dean looked back at Cas who was holding her with a question in his eyes. Cas held the baby closer, tucking her under his chin as if to protect her.
He couldn't be anything other than what his father wanted him to be. Otherwise he was a disgrace. He still believes that. Dean blinked away the tears in his eyes as he forced himself to focus on the roar ahead.
He watched Allen take the smoke up to his lips and inhale. He tried to hold the smoke in for a while before exhaling it and coughing loudly. Dean laughed, mainly to cover up for the fact that seeing him smoke was extremely arousing in a way he didn't even understand. They took turns passing the smoke back and forth until it was burnt to a nub on the sidewalk and then he pulled out another one. His mouth was numb and tingly from the nicotine and his throat was extremely dry but he still continued to smoke. Also noting the fact that they're not paying any attention to the germs of their mouths on the cigarette.
"Well I uh, I do have a half brother."
"I'm not thin. You're skinnier than I am." Dean laughed.
"I can't believe I almost lost this." He murmured more to himself than anything. Cas burrowed his face in Deans neck whimpering and breath hitching as he got closer to orgasm.
"So Cas, you said you were from Kansas, you from Lawrence too?"
"Jack!" Cas yelled. The sound still muffled like a sound box. The temperature neither hot nor cold. Dark nor light. Silent but somehow still deafeningly loud. The three of them wandered deeper and deeper into the abyss calling out for the Nephilim. But there was nothing. They walked and screamed hoarse for what felt like hours, but there was nothing. Until The Empty was summoned. If Dean had chills about the place before, that was nothing compared to the utter fear that was The Empty itself. It took the molding form of black liquid, forming itself into a human form. Dean almost jumped when he was Meg, but knew in an instant that it wasn't her. The Empty made her voice different, her demeanor was oddly snarky and similar, but it wasn't her.
"You could say boner appétit." He laughed and Castiel couldn't help but join in on the crude joke. Dean was genuinely an interesting person and this playful side of him was almost as enjoyable as his sensual side. Dean got up without another word and strode across the floor and put on his discarded boxers from last night before winking and walking out into the living area. Castiel bit his lip in a smile as he got out of the covers as well. He went and grabbed the robe he had left on the floor earlier in the morning and tied it on before walking out to Dean as well.
"You've been drinking. Let me give you a ride home."
"Dean, don't fuck with me." Cas warned.
"No I don't know."
It took a moment for those words to click and then Dean blinked at the reaper.
"Dad... there's something I need to tell you."
"I'm gonna take a shower, tell me when they get here."
"De toute évidence."
"I dunno. You'll get bored of it?"
"I wish I could heal you." Cas whispered. Dean lifted up the small vile of grace still wrapped around neck.
"Small world." Castiel smiled back. The older of the two was quiet but if Castiel wasn't mistaken he was looking at him.
"Jesus fucking Christ what are you doing here?" He asked as Cas pushed his way into the door.
Dean made the mistake of opening his eyes.
"Then come o're and I'll dirty talk you in French all night long."
"No, I'm not." He laughed awkwardly. "My uh... partner is in the car." He shrugged. She made a face of understanding and slight disappointment, but Dean didn't really care. She scanned his face credit card and gave him the room key. Dean thanked her and sauntered back outside to the car. Cas was leaning up against the hood and he looked adorable as ever. He was wearing a pair of Deans old jeans and one of his flannels, a simple blue and green one. His hair was artfully tousled from Dean fluffing it all day. When he saw Dean across the parking lot, his face lit up in a smile and he wondered; not for the first time, how he deserved Cas. Dean walked the rest of the way over and helped him get the duffle bags out of the trunk. They walked to the door the lady had said Room 116 and opened the door.
"Oh shut the fuck up."
"Yeah, you totally did. And then there was Allen, and Captain Kirk, Matt Dillon, Dr. Sexy... plus the sexual tension between you and Cas over the years had almost been unbearable."
Castiels heart sped up a little bit. Gabriel had pushed and prodded to get Cas to wear the skirt. He loved them in truth, but he was always a little self conscious about them two. And right now he isn't sure what to make of Deans statement.
"I have an idea." He said. He bolted for the door leaving Dean standing there confused. When he came back in the warehouse, he dropped to the floor with the duffle bag and started to speak as he opened it. "Remember back when we were in Shoshone, Idaho? There was that hell hound that I killed for the trials. Well, we couldn't see it, so we used glasses," he pulled out two pairs of glasses and the old jug. "And doused them in holy oil. I remember one time, Cas showed me all these sigils guarding a building. I could t see them, but he could. So maybe the holy oil," he said pouring it on the glasses. "Will help us see any sigils. It's a long shot, but it just might work."
Castiel fit himself in between the V of Deans legs stroking his hair softly as Dean smoked. Dean has admired Castiels tattoos since their first night together, but suddenly he wants to know the meaning behind each one.
Right. That's how I greet my friends too. Dean responded.
"I'm glad you like it. Culinary school is paying off after all I guess." Dean smiled.
"I appreciate your concern, but I will be fine and I am going whether you like it or not." Cas said storming past him to Deans- their?- room. Dean looked down the hallway in awe of what just happened before he turned on a heel to look back at Sam. Sam was biting his lip to stop from laughing and that just pissed Dean off even more.
"This is amazing," Cas said around his mouthful. "Truly."
They called a hospital and sure enough, Robin died of dehydration. The medical practitioners couldn't understand why there were traces of sulfur in his system, but Dean and Castiel knew. While they were there, they got Cas's arm fixed up and he had to be put in a sling for the next month. They stayed the rest of the night in their motel room, ready to go in the morning. The air was thick with tension when they went to bed, not even touching through the night.
Dean and Cas had a baby boy who they decided to name Jack. Jack Kline Novak.
"I didn't say you were,"
God, did it feel good.
"Maybe we should shotgun for your first time. It makes it easier." Castiel said as he held the roach to his mouth and lit it. He inhaled slowly savoring as if dogged his system and burned his lungs. He held the smoke in for a second but then turned to Dean on the couch. He cradled Deans jaw with one hand and used his thumb to open his mouth. Deans pupils were dilated as Castiels lips brushed his and he exhaled the smoke into Deans mouth. Dean inhaled instantly, breaking out into a small fit of coughs a moment later.
"I think Cas put it in my jacket. I don't know how, but I just know. It's like he's trying to help us."
"Then I'd say that's the best kind of stress relief." He laughed. "That should have you out in about ten minutes. I'll wake you if you're not already up by the time we have to land."
Lay me down onto the bed of your flaws. Hold yourself above me, let your wings graze the ceiling as I show you just how much of an angel you are.
"...Are you peeing while I'm taking a shower?"
For the first time since he was in the institute, Castiel felt inspired. He woke in the early morning and his clock read that it was just before six. Dean was snoring softly on his stomach hair rumpled and cheeks flushed from warmth. He smiled at him before slowly crawling out of bed. He padded into the bathroom to throw on his silk blue robe before walking out of the room. He quietly closed the double French doors that they had left open on his way out. He stepped into the dark sky on the balcony where he had left his canvas the night before. He don't know how or why it happened but he just started painting.
"Dean you have to tell him! You can't lie about something like this! It's not fair to him!"
"Dude we had sex. Not that complex. I'm not looking for a relationship right now."
"Sam," Dean sighed leaning against the counter.
"Good morning, Dean." Castiel chuckled, voice still horse from last nights activities.
One Friday morning, Castiel got a call from an investment artist in Birmingham England.
"What? No. Please no."
"What are you talking about?" He chuckled. "I'm not scared. Why would you ask that?"
"I do," Cas said hopping off Dean since they were getting some strange looks. "But I would much rather fuck you on your couch."
Dean stared at the drawing for a long time, and maybe it was wrong. Okay very wrong, but he was turned on. It's a fucking sketch and it has him tenting in Cas's robe. He took the sketch pad back inside with him because if he was going to jack off to a drawing of Castiel , in Castiels robe, about Castiel, he was not doing it outside on his balcony.
Jack maybe?
"And you know, next reaper to die becomes Death. So, I kill you, you get the promotion."
"Now, I am interested in your style. I've spoken with Richard Roman and he's highly recommended you for my spring art show. What kind of art do you do?"
"Wear the lingerie you bought me?..."
The other man had shaggy light brown hair, some might call it blonde but it wasn't. He was shorter than the other man but not by too much. He had strong, sharp features such as his nose and jawline. His lips were plump and pink and so tempting even all the way over here. But that wasn't the most captivating part. The most striking part of this mystery man was his green eyes. They were like beautiful emeralds and summer grass. So placating and beautiful Castiel had to swallow his suddenly dry mouth.
"I'm not a celebrity," just then there was a knock at the door. Cas opened it to find Balthazar and Charlie on the other side.
"But what if this... doesn't work out. Then you'd be left with a shitty reminder of me on your body forever." Castiel simply rolled his eyes and held out his forearm. He'd almost forgotten that his minimalist scribbled unicorn, was a tattoo he got with his ex.
"What's so funny?" Castiel asked coming out of the kitchen.
"That's what I live for baby." He gulped once he saw the expression on Cas's face. "A hint. Lavender."
They only separate hands once they get out to Deans car and Castiel stops in his tracks.
"Yeah. And could I-" Dean looked down blushing.
"Had to get dressed, bitch."
That's not who I am. Dean thought.
"I love you- fuck- so much. Christ, Dean." Castiel panted and whined. Dean was far to gone in the sensations to respond, just trying to breathe. Dean clenched down on Cas, just a hair away from orgasm as Cas spilled hot deep inside of Dean with a sharp gasp. Dean rode him out, searching for his own orgasm. Cas wrapped his hand around Deans throbbing cock and whispered in his ear.
"You mean some privacy?" Sam waggled his eyebrows. Dean flipped him the bird and continued.
"Bonjour. Mon nom est, Dean. Quel est votre nom?"
"I've changed." Meg walked right up next to Cas and they kissed each other's cheeks in a friendly manner. Still Dean couldn't help but see green a little.
Castiel was dressed in a champagne colored turtleneck blouse, his hair beautifully messy as always. He was wearing a simple silver necklace and bracelet, but that's not why Dean had to do the double take. Cas was wearing a fucking skirt. Castiel was wearing a goddamn, black, pleated skirt and he looked breathtaking. He hadn't noticed Dean staring yet, which was probably for the better, as he hung his coat next to Gabriel's. Dean couldn't help but let his eyes wander to Castiels beautifully smooth and shaven legs adorned by high heel black leather boots. God he really had no idea what he was doing to Dean. He walked over to take a seat on the couch per Sam's request and his skirt slid up enough he could see the flower tattoo on the side of his thigh that he knew stretched up over his sharp hip bones.
"What you said this morning." Dean froze in his tracks and went still.
"Fantastic." Castiel said as he went into the entry way to take his spare key off of the empty hook. He came back out to Dean and dropped it in his palm with a smile on his face.
"Jerk."
He looked around for his boxers but the room was much to dark and he didn't want to wake up Castiel. He opted for Cas's silk blue robe hanging on the bathroom door. As he put it on he shivered at how nice it felt and how much it smelled like him. The robe was awfully short though and he pondered to himself that this must be a women's robe. But on Castiel it always looks sexy so he made do. The neighbors upstairs didn't relent but he did stop in the doorway for a moment staring at Castiel.
"Dean," he spoke firmly. "You have never disappointed me. How could you even think that? I've told you, your health and well-being is the most important thing to me. And Dean you're not healthy," he said standing up and going over to lift up Deans shirt. "I mean look at you! This isn't healthy, Dean. You don't sleep at night, you're scared when it's time to actually fall asleep. You can't focus and you act like everything's okay. It's not!"
"Es-tu putain de sérieux?!" He gleamed.
"I love you." He murmured. Everyone started awwing and Dean blushed, almost forgetting about everything and everyone for a second.
"Yeah. I'll take you to the beach, baby."
"I'm sorry, I've- I gotta go to bed." He said stumbling to his feet. "Thanks for uh, yeah."
"The tattoos? No. It's a little uncomfortable to get them, but not painful."
"It wont kill you to try something new, Dean." Cas smiled, not even looking up from his own menu.
"In the panties?"
"Something is bothering you I can tell."
"Yeah. I don't see why-"
"I'm sorry, I have to." Cas shrugged, fake sympathy on his face.
Neither of them said a words for a few minutes. Partially because they didn't know what to say but Castiel did have something to say.
"Please don't bring him into this." Cas mumbled into his neck, still sucking away. Dean chuckled lightly before breaking out into a groan. Castiels hand wrapped firm around both of them and worked up a slow stroke. If it wasn't for the softness of Cas's hands, the rough friction would almost be too much. Dean couldn't believe the absolute depths of pleasure he felt as the lips of his angel roamed across his body. The pent up lust and longing made them much to needy to spend much time on the slow kisses of foreplay, but as Cas flipped them over and slammed him against the mattress, they got a bit rougher. Dean managed to get quick nips and licks of Cas's nipples and shoulders and whatever else came into contact. As soon as their stiffness aligned perfectly, heads catching on one another in Cas's hand, Dean thought he may come on the spot. The intensity of passion he felt for the man cacooning him against his toned body threatened to rip him to shreds. Cas wrapped a strong hand around them both as he balance himself above Dean. The lust of Cas's grip and the hardness of the other made him feel out of his mind as he watched the thick muscles of the angel's bicep hold him in place. He had drastically underestimated the absolute jaw-dropping hotness of the body hidden beneath Cas's ever-present suit.
"Thanks, Crow." Cas said. They put their shirts back on and Castiel paid for the tattoos before they headed out. Dean drove them out to lunch, and was surprised by how hungry he was after the tattoo. He ate two whole burgers while Castiel ate a chicken salad. Castiel laughed at his appetite and they talked some over food. Dean kept smiling to himself every time he remembered that he now had a tattoo, and smiled even more when he remembered Cas had the same one. Dean took them for a drive just listening to music and looking out the windows before heading back to their flat.
"S'good to see you too, Dad."
"What?" Castiel asked following his gaze.
