Cas sits forward on the chair, looking at the wall. “Our lives are long. We see...so much. Being human myself, even briefly, made my emotions sharper, I think it made me understand better, but it didn’t change that. That time span has different implications.”
Dean wants to say “for everything,” but that’s both too much and a cop out at the same time, just like when Cas said the same thing to him right before the fall. The question isn’t quite a trap, but there is a right answer there, something Cas is looking for, and if Dean ever really knew what that was then he can think of quite a few things over the last decade that would have gone differently.
Cas had been across the room, distracted by a struggling Jack. Sam was right there, but hasn’t said anything.  Not like that’s the only awkward thing they’re going to have to work through.
Dean doesn’t totally understand the rules, but gathers it has a component of poker, and a component of truth or dare, and teenagers will be teenagers, and living through near literal hell may just make them feel even more reckless and invincible.
“Not talking much. Embarrassed. But he’ll be ok.” Then he clears his throat, answering the unasked question. “He didn’t sleep with her.” Dean lets out a breath he didn’t even know he was holding, flooded with relief. That would have been...well, he doesn’t want to think about what that would have been.
“Right,” Dean says and pushes himself out of his chair to go find coffee and maybe talk to Cas about the Jack thing.
Dean had thought he was going to die here once. Castiel had thought he was going to live. It’s true that those things were a very different undertaking.
When he looks over again, Cas meets his eyes, and this time neither of them looks away. It doesn’t feel anything like normal, but at least Dean can see that Cas means it when he nods again and says, “We stay together.”
about the implications of the spell, get to Sam. And now, in the silence, after nothing played out like he hoped it would and he’s a guiltily relieved about that more than anything, he doesn’t totally know what to say.
During the day, it was easy enough not to stop moving. He pushed himself to exhaustion, because that was the mission, but also because then when he had to sleep, he could pass out quickly and, with any luck, it would be dreamless. He pushed
And so after they found Cas, when it turned out he’d heard everything anyway, Dean locked all that shit
Cas is looking at him questioningly. The little cat has followed him into the house, crying shrilly at his heels for more pets. Jesse smiles at her indulgently. “I see you’ve met Llorona. We named her that because she makes that noise.” Llorona shrieks in response. “Cesar!” Jesse calls, “come look what the cat dragged in.”
The sky is clear. The sun is bright and doesn’t threaten to trigger the aching pain behind his eyes. Dean rolls down the window to breathe in the dust of the road. Sam keeps shooting glances at him out of the corner of his eye.
When Dean gets them back to the motel and gets Cas’s shirt off in the light, it’s not as bad as he thought. He’s patched up worse, on Sam and his dad and Bobby. Even on himself in a pinch.
Fine is not really the word Dean would use, but Cas is definitely more with it after Dean gets him patched up and to bed. He drops off quickly.  Once Dean is sure Cas is asleep and breathing easy, he goes out to scrub out the car, working in the light of the dashboard and the guttering street lamp as he wipes Cass’ blood off the upholstery, thinking
Dean pours himself a cup of coffee and blurts out, “Did you know Jack’s going vampire hunting?”  before taking a sip.
It is a happy ending.  Chuck is not dead but neutralized through his connection with Amara and her newfound love of creation (it was Jack who got through to her, who helped her take control and reset the clock, bring them all back. It was Jack who saved it all, like Castiel always knew he would).
“Are you okay?” Cas finally asks, quietly, breaking the silence. “You’re very…” he cocks his head as though looking for the right word. “...loud, right now.”
Turns out, when you fall three stories, knock your head on a marble buffet table, impale yourself on a rotting piece of broken wood, and shatter your knee cap, recovery is slated to take awhile. Dean’s not sure if he’s unlucky that he managed to somehow hit that fun combo or extremely lucky that he’s not in a coma, the rotting wood missed any vital organs, and the doctors say there’s a good chance he’ll recover most movement.
Sometimes the bunker feels small and claustrophobic, like he’s tripping over the others every time he enters a room, trapped underground with a bunch of uncivilized packrats who can’t even
The house is like a haunted mansion out of a horror movie - dark and foreboding; old and in disrepair. The poltergeist comes at him where he’s standing at the edge of the stairwell and flashes out just before he swings the steel bar, and then in again with enough force to shove. The banister gives, and he has enough time to register Cas shouting his name before he hits the ground three stories below and everything goes black.
“No, that’s fine; we don’t need to put you out.” He makes quick eye contact with Dean and then looks away.
Dick laughs again. “No, none of us can. We burned out a few trying - brave soldiers. But we saw you before with that vampire and hell ghost. We know you’re my ticket out of here. And then, well. I’ll make sure my friends get what they’re owed. And yours do too.”
won’t, I guess. That technicality doesn’t really help. I’m so furious at her, and every choice she's made in all this, but I also still owe her, you know?  For Mom." He huffs a laugh, no humor in it. "I wasn’t even sure I
“Hey bud, you missed a spot,” Dean said, reaching out hesitantly to brush at the smear of shaving cream on Cas’s jaw, then leaning in with a little more confidence when Cas didn’t pull away.
not to move too much. You’ll pull your stitches or the IV.” That’s when Dean takes in the chest to waist bandages around his middle.
He stands at the rift with Cas at his back, and then steps through, hoping that there’s daylight on the other side.
Sam rubs a hand over his face. “Cas is fine. Physically. He hasn’t slept in days; I sent him to the hotel to rest. You need to rest too. Don’t get agitated.”
“I’m sorry,” Jack is saying, “he made me promise, he said it wasn’t anything we had to worry about now, he said….” and Dean holds up one hand to stop him.
There are bad days. There are days when the light slanting under his door from the hallway is too much, and the everyday noises of the bunker echo in his skull. He lies in the dark with an ice pack over his eyes because he needs the pressure, the numbing chill, the complete dark, to fight back the nausea from the pounding in his head.
A witch doesn’t seem a ton more likely than demons, really. Their numbers are so diminished, with any demon deals essentially being voided when Hell went on lock down. But if this is not the kind of weird shit that comes from demons, then it’s definitely the kind of weird shit that comes from witches.
Dean shudders again, pulling back just enough that so has the space to run his hands up Castiel’s arms to cup his face and tip their foreheads together. “Just don’t do it again,” he says.
Dean breathes out harshly. “Oh, kid. I know. Me too. Chuck played us all.“ He takes a breath. I’m sorry too.” He doesn’t feel like that will ever be quite enough, maybe for either of them.
“But how?” Sam says, still trying to understand.  “If it was about happiness in all of this, then how…” He trails off when Dean just looks at him, as steady as he can, trying not to shatter again, breathing through the knot in his chest. It doesn’t feel unlike it did when Billie was crushing his heart.
. I love Sam and Jack too, of course. And Claire, and others, but can we please just talk about what we’re actually talking about?”
She continues, “Mostly, I just called you back to really emphasize to both of you the importance of serious antibiotics if you’re going to be running around out in the woods. Hodags aren’t venomous, but their saliva’s chock full of some fun bacteria. Your friend’s lucky.  You get a bite right on a joint - I’ve seen people lose mobility. I’ve seen people lose
His head feels better, and it’s his left leg that’s fucked, so he takes Baby out for the first time since The Accident. Sam goes with him on the pretense of brotherly bonding, but probably really because he still doesn’t totally trust Dean behind the wheel. That’s annoying, but Dean doesn’t fight him too hard; he doesn’t mind the company.
, and you still think…” he cuts himself off  again and rubs a hand over his face. “I shouldn’t have asked that of you, and you
Cas’s eyes dart back into the room, and the officers who are still hanging back, inclined to listen to the FBI agent. He sighs. “I think we should look for a hex bag.”
“Are you okay?” Cas asks, eyeing him warily from the passenger seat, and Dean shifts because he can’t really get comfortable with the pain shooting up his right side.
Navigation is difficult in Purgatory. It looks like an Earth forest on the surface, if colder and strangely empty, but there’s a repetitiveness to the landscape upon closer inspection. Like Heaven or Hell, it becomes an undifferentiated maze that makes it difficult to find your way unless you know what you’re looking for. And they don’t, really. Dean is carving X’s into the trees as they pass to mark their path. Castiel is carefully watching for any landmarks, and carefully watching the time.
Dean opens his mouth to say...something, some kind of objection, but then closes it with a snap. She’s right; if this is a witch and that’s the connection, they’d have been great cannon fodder for whatever spell this is.
It feels a little like closure, too, the good kind, a step forward. It’s just that Dean’s never really trusted closure. It never really works like it’s supposed to - after all those years and all that pain, Chuck is just gone; Heaven and Hell are sealed, it’s
Jack keeps asking him if he needs anything anytime they’re in the room together, which isn’t often. Rowena keeps bringing him tea that smells like ass and tastes worse, but does help the pain. Eileen keeps sneaking him comfort food. Sam keeps taking
He trails off then, and Castiel thinks it’s over, or he’s passed out, but then Dean’s voice comes again, more softly.
He gets off the floor and he heads for the library and the lore. There’s nothing there. There’s not going to be
They go in as Fish and Wildlife Services since, thankfully, there haven’t been any human attacks - just goats, and cows, and the occasional horse. At first it seems like nobody’s really seen anything, and the locals are assuming these are wolf kills. It’s one of those times when Dean figures they’ll have to be careful not to run into the actual Fish and Wildlife Service officers.
Or maybe Castiel is just a coward who doesn’t want to be there to see the look on Dean’s face when it does.  Maybe all of the above
to remember, happened quickly. Billie at the door. The realization that deal was the only way out. That
Dean huffs something that sounds like a laugh that turns into a groan when Castiel accidentally jostles his ribs. Castiel gets one hand on the side of Dean’s jaw to tilt his head up and get a look at his face. His skin is ashen and there’s a mottled bruising along one side of his face; his eyes are bloodshot, but at least they’re focused.
“Cas?” Jack breathes out, and it’s not really a question, he has to already know too, but that’s all it takes for Dean to crumble again, and maybe there’s no way to bury this deep enough.  It’s going to hover right below the surface, maybe for the rest of his life.  However long that is.
“We don’t both have to go.” Cas’ voice is tight, and when Dean turns toward him he’s watching the rift too, fists clenched.
When he thought about it later, which he mostly didn’t, since it was easier to shove it down and bury it under years of equally traumatic baggage, those were the memories that would catch him off guard and leave him shaking in bed or reaching for the whiskey to feel some kind of warmth. It was the darkness, the cold, the loneliness like a physical ache that could still knock his legs out - the barbs that dug under his skin and only hurt worse once he was out and realized Sam hadn’t looked for him at all, that Cas had heard his prayers and
“Yeah? And what if something goes bad? Worse case scenario, we know there’s a way for me to get out. In case you’ve
Cas pours himself a cup of coffee and slumps down in the seat across from Dean, making a “go ahead" gesture. His hair is a mess, and he’s in one of Dean’s old t-shirts; something in Dean’s gut clenches. They stare at each other for a moment, and then Dean breaks.
Castiel does think that, actually, and after everything, he doesn’t think Dean has a right to sound so betrayed.
They discharge him after surgery to remove most of his broken knee cap, with crutches, a knee brace, a referral to a doctor in Kansas, a physical therapy protocol, and several types of medication for the headaches.
“Do you regret it?” Dean asks, quietly. He probably shouldn’t ask again - they’ve had some version of this conversation several times, the question asked and answered. But Dean keeps worrying at it, like picking at a scab. There’s no mission now, no real goal. Cas has seemed relatively content these last few months to hang out in the bunker and follow Dean from shitty motel to shitty motel across the country, but it seems like a lot to ask for that to last when there’s no epic cause anymore, nothing angel-worthy left.
Dean swallows hard against the acknowledgement that sleep is something Cas apparently needs these days.
She makes no secret that she thinks they’re a couple of dumbasses, and she wasn’t even swayed by the Winchester name since she’s not really that plugged into, or impressed by, the hunter community. She knows her hodags, though, and she’s been a wealth of information that Dean passed on to Sam.
“My grace is fading anyway,” Cas says, "it doesn't seem to matter whether I use it or not. Might as well be
Dean may be back in the fight, but that doesn’t mean he’s not going to call this what it is. They still can’t win this, but sure, if there’s a chance they can make a difference in the losing or take Chuck down with them, then they wouldn’t
(They’re staying at a nicer hotel than usual because Eileen wanted to. There’s this fancy coffee shop that has a tasting room - why would a coffee shop have a tasting room, Dean doesn’t ask - and Jack loves it. They burned another body and there are still apparitions, which means at least three ghosts. Jack is doing great. Seeing Eilleen is great. Sam is really, really happy to be there with her. Sam doesn’t say that last one, but Dean can tell. He may tell them to take another few days after the case wraps up. Stick Jack in a separate room for a night or two. Let him play tourist for awhile and explore Revolutionary War history and fancy coffee shops while Sam and Eileen catch up.)
The motel is their usually flop, a ways off the highway past the nicer Days Inns and even the Motel Eights. His back is already protesting the last few nights on the thin mattress and after a night of grave digging and the ghost encounter, his hip is not going to thank him in the morning.
for that. They don’t have time for him to unpack even half of what Cas just dumped on him. He’s not sure what enough time to do that would even look like. So Dean takes a deep breath, shoves it all down with long nights of doubt and confessional prayers and all the rest of the Purgatory shit they never talked about, and makes a decision.
When Dean used to talk about taking them all to the beach and a real vacation, he had California in mind. Maybe that was because of Sam, and the life he’d had to abandon. Maybe they’ll do that someday. But this works too, the quiet in the midst of the chaos, the sun coming up over the sea wall and the Gulf.
“One thing, Cas. Or two, actually. You can’t talk like you’re not coming back. And answer your fucking phone when I call you.”
“Sam says it’s definitely not demons,” Cas supplies, helpfully, and it’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes.
“Cas. Wait.” He turns back around. Dean’s just watching him, like he’s deciding what he’s going to say. “I’m so tired,” he finally says. Castiel waits as instructed. “Just..in every way and of everything, I'm so tired." He pauses, and then breathes out harshly and continues. "I’m too rung out to talk tonight. I won't say anything right. But I know we should. And I’m also too tired to pretend this,” he gestures between them “isn’t what it is.” He’s staring at Castiel a little like a challenge, and Castiel doesn’t totally know what to
Dean’s surrounded. Two more vampires step out in front of Castiel, pushing him back, away from the trees. He gets his knife in one of them when he hears Dean call his name.
except his dad and Sam, and if he thought no one could annoy him as much as Sam can, he underestimated Castiel, former angel of the Lord.
“What’s the damage?” Dean asks; he’s sure he’s not going to like the answer. He can’t feel much of anything except vaguely floaty, which probably means hard core painkillers masking whatever he’s gonna get hit with when they start to wear off.
Cas kisses the hinge of his jaw and leans in, so that Dean is fully up against the wall, held there by the weight of Cas’ body. “I love you in every way I understand the word,” Cas says, low in his ear, “and I want you in every way I understand the word, if that addresses your earlier concerns.”
Dean honest to God laughs, which is probably not the most appropriate reaction, but that’s where Cas wants to go with this? Does he
Besides, the liquor store does fancy whiskey tastings on Thursdays and that’s as good a reason as any.
He breaks the kiss to tip his forehead against Cas’ and says, “I love you,” because he has to follow Cas’ confession up with something, even if it’s weak in comparison. He may not have the poetry or the words, but he has just as much devotion to back it up.
Dean takes a deep breath and doesn’t move his hand. They stay that way, drinking coffee and staring at the limitless horizon as the sky lightens.
Dean drinks about three cups of hospital vending machine coffee in the waiting room. It’s been awhile since they’ve had to do this - the benefits of both the bunker and having an angel on-call. He’s rusty at both managing his hospital-related anxiety and the blustering charm it takes to sell their weak-ass lies about what actually happened.
And no, it can’t be, but the reports of black eyes, people bleeding from their eyes and turning on their friends, the gruesomeness of the murders, the
“Yeah,” Dean croaks out. That’s fair. Ishim was an asshole who was pretty much destroyed by his obsession with Lily Sunder. Gabriel was just a horny bastard.
“Don’t let Jack make any moves until you hear from me. Call Donatello again. See if you can get in touch with Rowena and if there’s anything she can turn up down there.” Castiel doesn’t want to know what’s lurking in the archives of Hell, but desperate times. They’re not going to find a way without serious consequences, that much is obvious by now. They just have to find a consequence they can tolerate.
Cas drops his head and lets out a scoffing laugh that sounds closer to a sob. “Never do that again,” he says, and Dean is reminded of standing over a human Cas, slumped in that desk chair, all those years ago. He’s reminded of sitting with Jack in the dark of the bunker a few months ago, waiting to see if Cas would wake up.
Dean barely has time to react to Cas calling his name, before the creature is on him, all horns and fucking teeth. At least they’re apparently smaller than urban legend would have it. He’s on the ground, trying to wrestle out from underneath it when Cas gets a hit in with the knife and draws its attention, giving Dean a chance to fumble for his gun.
Dean tries Benny’s loose whistle again, calling out through the trees, and they both wait. The forest gives them nothing back. Dean sighs and slants his eyes toward Castiel.
and knowing what that means. When I say angels feel differently, I mean nothing in a millenia has compared to the friendships I’ve formed in the last ten years on earth, and I have never felt about anyone or anything the way I feel about you. I’m not afraid I feel less than you do. I’m afraid I feel more.”
Cas huffs a disbelieving laugh and drops his head to rub at his temple. The gesture is so simple and so human that Dean has to swallow around the lump in his throat. When Cas looks up, his expression has softened into something like resigned disappointment, which might be even worse than everything that came before. “I know,” he says. “But thank you for saying it.”
And that has to be good enough, doesn’t it?  All any of them have control over are the things they can choose.
Cas nods, and brings up with his other hand and reaching out for Dean, who takes it so that they’re holding both hands across the table, staring at each other. “Yes,” Cas says. “It didn’t want me then. It said it would wait until I was
“Thank you, Dean. I want to be here.  I want…” he trails off, thinking, and Dean loses his composure.
The consensus is that if anybody DID see anything, it was these two guys who live on a horse ranch outside of Mesilla. They’re quiet, keep to themselves, but they seem to be who you call when you have questions about livestock deaths, either from sickness or animal attacks.
He feels like there’s some kind of gentle tether holding him here, next to Cas in comfortable but charged silence with their knees pressed together under the table. He’s afraid that any kind of sudden shift will break the moment, and he doesn’t want to be alone. They haven’t talked much since Purgatory; everything after that was utilitarian. Get the spell together, do the spell, whatever you do
Jesse shrugs. “Mostly. But that’s easier said than done it turns out, and you can’t just ignore a chup in your backyard. Where’s your brother?”
Castiel closes his eyes and concentrates; blue light flickers and fizzles, but there’s nothing left. It’s not enough, really. The worst of the internal damage is healed; Dean's not going to die from blood loss, but it’s a far cry from the complete healing Castiel used to be able to do with just a touch of his hand.
“I’m fine, Sammy,” he says. “I know I’ve been saying that, even when it wasn’t totally true, but I’m really going to be okay. You can stop worrying so goddamn much.”
Dean starts, jerking his head around in disbelief. “What?” he spits out. “Why, in this or any world, would we need to use you as Leviathan bait?”
They’re watching old horror movies and Eileen falls asleep with her head in Sam’s lap halfway through
Dean will take that. “No, you stay here and wait for Sam and Eileen. You’re probably still a magnet for those Leviathan bastards; I can stay under the radar on my own. Sam has Rowena’s books; he may be able to figure out how to keep the rift open longer if we need it.”
There’s no hex bag. They go back through everything from the previous scenes, and there’s nothing there either. There’s nothing tangible, really, to indicate witchcraft - no spell remnants at the scenes, no sigils -  and when they get Rowena on the phone again in the morning, she’s less convinced than Cas is.
wasn't lying, there you go." They stare at each other for a moment, tight and tense. Cas opens his mouth like he's going to say something else, then snaps it shut again, closing his eyes and looking away, seeming to brace himself. Dean braces himself in turn.
Cas takes a sip of his coffee and gazes out at the water. “I’ve seen the ocean in a million forms,” he says, quietly. “I remember when there was one continent and the water just spread out forever.”
Dean gets a washcloth to clean them both up, and then crawls back into the bed still naked. Cas pulls him against his chest.
Alan shrugs again, giving nothing away. “She wants to talk to you and your partner.”  Dean follows him back with some trepidation.
, but that’s okay because that probably would be a lie. They’re afraid of each other, and they’ll work through that, or they won’t, but there’s no real comfort in pretending it’s not there.
Cas narrowed his eyes, confused. “You’ve explained what happened with Sam. I know you had to make a choice. I wouldn’t have been much help to you as a human at that point anyway.”
Cas shrugs again. “I’m fine. Worried about Jack. Worried in general. But It didn’t work on me so…” He pauses, and tilts his head, eyeing Dean speculatively, and then says, “The siren, you know,
And Dean had time to sober up, and time to think, and time to decide that they can’t go on like this. They need an answer, whatever that answer is. Also, sobriety was not a good call, and liquid courage never hurt anyone, so he gets the whiskey, takes a shot, and goes to find Cas.
“Overrated? Are you sure you’re doing it right?” he asks, and winces a little the second it leaves his mouth. It’s supposed to be a joke, the way he’d tease Sam, but it comes out dismissive, and more than a little sleazy.
live through it, not really, and now that he has, he can’t get a handle on it, can’t find the rhythm of a life.
, but they’re getting close to the drop zone now and somehow haven’t been fired upon once. It’s only serving to make things more tense.
The few articles of furniture that had been left to gather dust were cleaned up and sold or given away, and the three of them spent the weekend painting the walls and unloading the U-Haul they’d driven up from Lawrence.
“We saw a plane crash,” Jack adds, gesturing along the road, and when Dean looks where he’s pointing he sees another cloud of black smoke, much closer. Somewhere near the part of Lebanon where they go to get pizza. “Well. A few planes. We don’t think there was anyone inside.”
Castiel trails off with a shrug. It’s still difficult to think of Hael--she had been a shy, creative girl right up until the end, when her moods suddenly began to swing from one extreme to the other, and all her interest in art and photography had fallen to the wayside. Castiel still has her camera and her car, both of which she hastily gave to him when she became aware of how dire her diagnosis was.
He pictures it in frantic flashes; himself on his knees, Cas’ hand in his hair, tilting his head back as he strokes himself, just out of reach. Cas spreading him out on the floor, shifting that same tight grip from his wrist to his knee and pushing Dean’s thigh to his chest so Cas can slide into him deep without letting him look away. And—Dean twitches in his jeans at the sudden, dizzying thought—Cas teasing him without a touch, just his grace, that cold-hot-electric tingle that runs through his body every time Cas heals him, focused and intent under his skin.
Castiel places a kiss on his shoulder and then grabs the butt plug and pushes it back in, trapping the last of his release in there. There’s much less resistance this time but there’s still a slight burn from Dean’s abused ass.
Dean wants to refuse but his dick is still aching for release from before and at this point it would be stupid to deny himself. He can hear Castiel leaning back in the couch and unzipping his pants.
And Castiel’s dick is also… very nice… Dean is trying not to stare because honestly it’s just not appropriate right after getting your windpipe crushed but Dean’s own dick has clearly missed that memo.
Well, too late to back down now. Might as well tell the whole story. And pray that his pretty face is going to save him ”My dad was a drunk. One night after he got himself fired he got into a fight at the wrong bar. They demanded money, for him to show his respect, that he hadn’t meant anything by it. When he refused they lit our house on fire. I got my brother out but both of our parents died that night. Afterward they apologised, saying that they hadn’t meant to kill anyone. They offered that I could work for them to pay off the debt. I refused. I didn’t want anything to do with them. I stored my car with one of my dad’s friends so they couldn’t follow us as easily and then I got the hell out of town with Sam. After I got my aprenticeship I managed to take out a loan so I could mail them the money. I thought that was the last of it. That’s the story, okay?”
Castiel speeds up and soon he’s panting ”Come for me”. Castiel doesn’t even have to touch him before Dean’s coming hard. The days without release and the way Castiel has been working him already had him on the brink. Castiel follows immediately after. Dean is pretty sure that the reverent look on Castiel’s face is mirrored in his own.
Castiel moves away again and that’s somehow way worse. If he just leaves him like this Dean’s going to freak out. He’s feeling vulnerable and oversensitive, the fact that he can’t even see what’s happening increasing the feeling of helplessness.
Dean brushes his teeth while sneaking peeks through the glass wall at Castiel undressing. He almost chokes at the tattoos and muscled expanse of chest that’s revealed when Castiel takes off his shirt. Castiel strips and turns off the lights before lying down under the covers. Dean finishes up and awkwardly stands in the doorway.
He unceremoniously turns Dean’s duffel upside-down, emptying it out on the floor. Then he rips open the bottom. He takes the journal out and dumps the bag on the floor before placing the journal on the dresser so he can flick through it while still holding the gun.
After another make-out session that ends with Dean panting into Balthazar’s mouth as he comes, Balthazar goes to bed.
Balthazar frowns ”Hey, none of that. I’ve just had to deal with Castiel’s pissy mood, I’m not also cleaning up after him”
He speeds up the hand on his dick and reaches down with the other one to stroke the skin behind his balls. He gently strokes the sensitive spot and is tipped over the edge.
Castiel is muttering his appreciation. At first it’s as if it’s happening at a distance but as Dean pulls himself toward the sound it becomes a second tether to reality. It’s compliments and those condescending nicknames but Dean clings to it anyway.
Dean refrains from commenting that it’s almost noon. He has no idea how he’s supposed to behave around Balthazar.
”I could damage you in so many other ways already” Castiel is very much in his space and Dean shudders. Castiel grips his chin and forces him to look him in the eye.
”Good to see that you enjoyed yourself” Castiel is eyeing the shirt that has been soiled by Dean’s  cum and hangs open from his shoulders. Castiel pulls his own pants and underwear down. He briefly pushes two fingers into Dean’s mouth ”open”.
”You’re going to come like this or not at all” Castiel crooks his fingers. The sensation is not as unpleasant as the scissoring motion but it’s still definitely strange. Dean can work with this.
Castiel is still straddling him and Castiel suddenly seems a lot more naked to Dean. Dean doesn’t know if he should look away but this is the first time he’s truly seen Castiel’s body in its full glory all at once. Dean swallows. Castiel is ripped and his tan continues on his entire body.
”So I’m seriously going to be calling you Castiel?” Dean knows that he probably shouldn’t poke the bear but it kind of just slips out.
Dean slaps him on the shoulder which leads to Balthazar grabbing his wrist which leads to more kissing and groping and Balthazar grinding up against him.
”You’re realizing that it doesn’t hurt as much as you expected it to. Remember that I could have easily chosen something else for this. And that you could’ve kicked and screamed on the way here. You don’t want to admit it but you’re already trusting me”
He should definitely be feeling worse about having just killed a man. But right now he mainly feels a thrill over being the one in charge for a change. He loves Sam but so much of Dean’s life has been spent making choices based on Sam’s needs.
Castiel scoffs ”That doesn’t sound very convincing” But he stops hitting and is now just kneading Dean’s ass in a way that makes Dean’s dick peak up again.
”So you have a brother?” Dean asks to break the tension from him being almost naked and Castiel looking like he’s going to eat him.
There’s two seconds of nothing happening before the third one comes. The uneven pacing is making this much worse.
Dean’s dick is starting to get interested but Castiel is just watching the TV and it’s not like he’s doing anything with his hand so Dean should probably say something else to not be the weird one ”Do you…. Do you mind if I take one of them apart? I’ll put everything back afterwards, I just would like to take a look”
“Stay a little longer?” Castiel asks him after a moment, his voice quiet, and Dean can’t bring himself to say no. He doesn’t want to say no.
“Thank you,” he hears himself saying, and Dean leans back a little to look at him like he’s lost his mind.
Digging his fingers into the back of his neck, Dean breathes deeply, slowly, sits down on the edge of the teacher’s desk, and tries to rationalize. He’s real.
The public library in Chisholm, Minnesota had been across the street from one of the only paying jobs Dean’s ever had. For the two months that he and Sam were stuck in the small town—waiting while John and a hunter they never met made slow work of tracking a wendigo in the George Washington State Forest—he’d finish his shift at Video Hut, and wander over to meet Sam, whose thrill at the novelty of staying in one place for two whole months had translated, naturally, into joining an after-school study club.
“I’ll be there the entire time, Dean. I can keep an eye on him. But we have to give a little bit of room to help, and to feel like he’s part of this team, not just someone we have to protect.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Ok, so I’ll be back in a week.” Maybe that’s exactly what he needs - Baby and the radio; long, hypnotic stretches of highway and a good adrenaline rush at the end of the line to jolt some sense of momentum back into him and clear out the restless buzzing under his skin.
“It probably would have worked for me before. Purgatory doesn’t want angels in it anymore than it wants humans.”
Dean leans against him heavily and drops his eyes. He says, “Just your phrasing. I know you wouldn’t leave me here, but you have to admit, you leave a lot.”
Dean takes a deep breath, and then a plunge. “What did you mean when you told Jack angels feel love differently?”
Cas nods. “Yes, but. Tomorrow, I think. Let him rest.”  He turns back to Dean and says, “Can I…” reaching toward the gash in Dean’s shoulder, already bandaged up by Sam and now a dull ache throbbing under the whiskey. This time Dean does pull away.
So maybe Rowena, Jack, Michael, and Adam saved them, and Dean’s grateful in a way that’s almost incapacitating, when he feels something other than emptied out and exhausted.
, and not righteously, not at God or circumstance (though that too), but personally, selfishly angry. And the first time he felt like this, it was about Dean too.
“Fucking perfect,” Dean mutters under his breath, staring out at the forest. They’re in a clearing, and not much is visible beyond the dense tree line. Castiel watches him scan their surroundings. Dean shifts, almost unconsciously, to a defensive stance and hefts the weight of the blade in his hand, tense and poised for a fight, already recalibrating for the hypervigilance of Purgatory.
stop him if you wanted to. I don’t think any of us can, if he’s committed to it. But yes. I think it would kill you to do it, but I think you would do whatever you had to. But I’m not gonna let it get to that point.”
Dean’s thrown a little bit because he wasn’t so much taking a break as losing all track of time passing, but sure, if that’s what you want to call it.
“Okay, you’re going to want just a fourth of a cup of the batter.  Scoop it on the griddle, and we’re going to flip it when we see the bubbles start to form in the top.” Jack smiles up at him, hopefully, and then holds the spatula ready, intently watching the stove. Dean’s reminded of the easy companionship of the day they want fishing. He loves this kid, and he’s a little afraid of him, and he still doesn’t know how to balance all of that, or quite what to say.
His weakened grace hasn't yet done much to impede his angelic strength, but there are so many. It occurs to him that the last time they were here he still had his wings, and that's probably what saved him then. They push him into the clearing toward the portal’s wavering light. They aren’t even trying to take him down, just drive him back, back, until he’s standing in front of the Leviathan leader who is still wearing Dick Roman’s smirking face. There's a crowd of Leviathan at his back.
Castiel got everything so wrong. He did not anticipate that he would be the one doing the soothing in this conversation, at least not like this. He squeezes Dean’s hip in reassurance.  “I won’t,” he says, “Never on purpose, not ever again.”
“I don’t know if I believe you,” Cas says, quietly. Dean squeezes his hand because it’s all he can do, and he knows that feeling too. Cas sits with him until he drifts off again.
Once he hears Dean head back to his room, Castiel goes to shower off the muck of Purgatory. There’s something about the scalding water and the physical act of scrubbing himself clean that’s grounding and feels like the only way to get the scent of blood off of his hands.
Dean draws in a shuddering breath, light-headed and stunned. He doesn’t know how to resond t that, so what comes out is, “Did you just compare me to original sin?”
“You’ll live,” Sam says. “Though they weren’t totally sure until the swelling in your brain went down. You scared me, Dean. And you
Sam doesn’t have a case for them, so Dean heads for the coast. They cross the bridge into Galveston Island just before sunrise. Dean buys them both cheap gas station coffee and drives to the water and they sit on the hood of the Impala as the sky starts to glow orange above them.
Cas is asleep when Dean comes to bed, the light from the moon falling across the curve of his shoulder where he’s turned away from the window. It’s a king bed - plenty of space for even two grown men to stretch out, not touching. Still, when Dean slides into bed, he can feel the heat of Cas’s body across the mattress, the rise and fall of his breath more intimate and infinitely closer than it is across the gap between beds in their endless hotel rooms.
species,” Cas acknowledges with a nod of concession. “And it was fine. She was kind and it was enjoyable and I didn’t get stabbed afterward.” Dean flinches at that, but if Cas catches it, he doesn’t let on.
Claire reminds him there are no demons anymore, and assures him they know better than to actually read the symbols out loud.
Amara got Chuck through the portal (to fucking somewhere, to build a new universe from scratch to ruin; Dean doesn’t give a shit), and she laid out everything needed to make sure the door was shut and locked behind them. No mark this time; no Ma’lak boxes; no, this time all they needed was the grace of an archangel, the grace of nephilim, and all the power of the ruler of Hell, freely given.
Dean draws in a shaky breath, and deflates a little at whatever he sees on Castiel’s face before sinking back against the table and nodding as he passes a hand over his face. “Fine. I'll keep it to myself. For now.”
It was two weeks. That’s all. Two weeks and he’s here and it’s over. The parts he remembers, the parts that are clear, that he was
Castiel is changed too, now even more fundamentally. Michael had looked at him and said, “You can come with us or you can stay, but if you stay, then you
But the nights were dark like no night on earth Dean had ever seen; the sharp, stark gray of Purgatory’s washed-out daylight faded to an inky black it felt like he had to wade through. The nights were
However, the wound in his side is infection free and healing cleanly. Getting impaled by a rotting piece of wood was, quite literally, the least of his problems, so he’s got that going for him. No one appreciates that observation either.
Silence except for the crunch of their boots on the leaves and the whistle of wind through the trees. Dean hasn’t spoken since the clearing, and hasn’t paused except to make marks on the trees. Castiel doesn’t try to talk again. They don’t need to look at each other. Castiel knows where Dean is in space by his footfalls, the shift of his weight; he can gauge Dean's mood by the cadence of his breath. It says something about them that the greater the proximity of danger the easier it is for them to fall into sync.
“Not like this.” There had been quiet moments in Purgatory, both when he was alone, and later, with Benny and Dean. They’d had uninterrupted hours. But this eerie silence is too complete. It’s weird that he would feel better if he did feel watched. “We need a better plan.”
Cas makes a frustrated noise and stalks forward, putting both palms on the table so he can lean forward and stare Dean in the eye. “Do you know what it was like, in those moments in that house after you fell? In the hospital just waiting to see if you would wake up?”
“Hey,” Dean says. He reaches out, hesitantly, and puts one hand on Cas’s knee. Cas’s jeans are caked with graveyard mud. “I’m okay. I’m pretty used to getting banged up by ghosts.”
In the morning, “fine” is definitely not the word Dean would use. He finds Cas in the bathroom, poking at his shoulder, where it’s starting to swell, red and angry.
From there it’s quick, once the dots are connected, a straight line from Eric’s first wife’s “suicide” to his estranged stepson currently living with his aunt and uncle out in Rincon. When they track the stepson down, they find a wiry, nerdy, nineteen year-old kid with his mom’s old spellbook, a deep hatred of his stepfather, and absolutely no fucking clue about the extent of his power. He hadn’t even known the spell had worked for sure, much less the ricochet effect it had.
There’s a reason he’s never broached the topic with Dean before, after all, and it’s not because he’s ever doubted that their love was mutual. Dean is complicated. Castiel knows this, and he’s ready to deal with the potential fallout.
“Yeah,” he says, then, taking in Castiel’s stance, he steps a little closer. “Are you cold? Should we call my mom for a ride?”
Twenty-five thousand feet above Kampinos Forest, Lieutenant Castiel Novak sees nothing but a sea of gray. Smoke obscures the treetops. If he’s very lucky, that same smoke will obscure the sight of his plane from the ground.
He doesn’t have time to fight back the urge to vomit. Somehow, Henriksen seems to know it’s coming, and there’s a waste paper basket in his hands just in time. He retches and retches and retches, heaves until his throat burns. Ellen crouches beside him.
It doesn’t escape Dean’s notice when he picks up the phone the following afternoon that he’s spoken to Sam more times in the past few days than he has in months. The thought makes him guilty, as though he’s using his brother. Deep down, he knows that’s not entirely true.
“Oh, fuck off,” Dean says, though both his tone and the elbow he hooks around Castiel’s neck say otherwise.
in tiny print along the inner edge of the paper label, and slips the record back into place. He’s about to leave when he hears the creak of a floorboard. The living room light flicks on before he can move.
The sun is still up when Dean gets back to his own time, and it throws him off for a moment. Makes him feel off-kilter and slightly nauseated.
Castiel can barely breathe for the way it crushes him. To be loved and wanted and needed but simultaneously wished away.
He’s reluctant to leave after, though he knows he should, and they spend several long minutes kissing by the door until Castiel finally pulls away to head back to his room. Dean’s fingers trail down his arm as he goes, leaving fire in their wake, and Castiel carries the feeling with him, almost floating down the hall even though his stomach still stings.
“Hey,” Dean says. His voice reverberates against Castiel’s chest, and Castiel feels himself slipping, all that resolve he had to keep himself separate from the dream just falling away. Because nothing has ever felt as good as this. Nothing has ever felt as safe. “How was the hunt?”
“Well, he always was just like our father. But even with the arguments, I always loved being out here. The trees, the river, the flowers… I used to think about this place when I first shipped out. When I had occasion to close my eyes, I’d think about coming back here and sitting in the sunshine. Watching the bees in spring.”
Not with his head so messed up, not with more booze than blood in his system. He needs to plan, needs to figure this out, to make sure that he doesn’t leave anything up to chance. Not again.
John’s footsteps are heavy and purposeful, and these are light and scattered. They’re not headed anywhere in particular. They’re probably not a threat. And anyway, even if they are, the basement is warded. They won’t be able to get in if they’re a—
“Where is he?” Jack asks, and Dean hates it. Hates how he can hear the waver in Jack’s voice. Hates that he can’t do anything to make it better. Can only make it worse. Fuck, he makes everything worse. “Dean, where’s Cas?”
He feels pinned in place, like a moth in a museum display, spread open for all the world to study. His mouth is bone dry. Tremors run through his limbs.
He looks incredible. Flushed and hungry and more short of breath than an angel has any right to be, with his suit coat rumpled and hanging off his shoulders. His shirt is unbuttoned, his pants around his thighs. His cock is red and curving up out of the white cotton underwear that Dean never bothered to push all the way down. Dean wants to drop to his knees and swallow him whole. He wants it so bad his mouth waters.
Picking up the laptop bag, Dean’s about to sling it over his shoulder when Castiel pulls it free of his grip and hooks it over his own. Dean’s hand makes an abortive motion as if to take it back. Castiel just catches it and starts walking toward the path marked with a sign for
isn’t the right word, but… I could hear you. Talking to Sam,” he explains, lifting his hand from the hood of his truck to wave vaguely in the direction of his room. Dean grimaces. “I know this is difficult, but Dean—”
The three djinn move to flank her. She’s beautiful, Castiel thinks, in the manner of a sharpened blade. She glints with power, rippling dangerous and cold as she studies him more closely.
“I’ll drive you back, Cas,” Sam says, snatching the keys right out of Dean’s palm. Dean looks just as bewildered by it as Castiel feels.
It’s only been half an hour since Dean left, and already Castiel is counting the minutes to their next meeting. It’s a foolish thing to do, considering that they clearly established
“The roads are a mess,” Sam says, voice shaky. “That’s why it took us so long to get back. We thought— when you didn’t answer your phone, we thought that you might’ve been gone, too.”
It’s the silvery-warm color of pre-dawn sky, stretching out between them like a reaching hand. The sight makes him falter in his step.
“And uh, pro tip?” Dean adds as they step out of his front door. “It doesn’t matter how much air freshener you spray, that sulphur smell is gonna eat right through it. You’re better off just airing the place out for a couple days.”
“But I—” he starts, clearly wanting to take a stand but uncertain how, and Mary looks on in confusion as he opens and closes his mouth like a grounded carp. He visibly swallows.
Dean had said back then, though he didn’t believe a word, and John had seen the lie for what it was. He’d cut more symbols into Dean’s skin.
is Cas reclining casually on Dean’s bed and tapping the rhythm on his own chest while Dean finished the last few questions of his math homework, making him take twice as long just by being so damn distracting.
Surreptitiously, he leans back in his seat and tries to make out the gas gauge. It’s running low. No matter what, John is going to have to stop driving sooner rather than later. When he does, Dean decides, he’s going to run. If he has to barricade himself inside a gas station, he’ll do it. He just needs help. Someone with access to a phone and two functioning hands. Anyone.
By the end of that third day, Dean had swallowed enough salt and lost enough blood that it made him sick, and as he’d heaved watery bile onto the floor of a roach-infested building on the outskirts of Chicago, a part of him had wondered, desperate and dizzy, if he
Dean’s clothes don’t quite fit Castiel. The jeans are too wide, and the shirt is snug on his shoulders, but they smell of Dean, and wearing them makes Castiel feel a little better. He pulls his feet up onto the couch and hugs his knees to his chest as he stares at the television.
He swallows against the nausea that follows the movement. Swallows again when it doesn’t pass. Realizes, too late, that he hasn’t taken a breath in several long seconds, and sucks one in with all the desperation of someone who’s just burst out of the ocean.
“I guess you’re on,” he says, then claps his hands on his knees and shifts on his seat. “Now. Anyone have any ideas for the ghosts or the hell hole they crawled out of?”
Dean grunts, and it’s obvious that he’s still unsure, even though he’s got no argument for Castiel’s logic.
Castiel thinks, and hates that it sounds so weak. That there’s little he can do but project loathing in Chuck’s general direction. He sighs. It won’t help to dwell.
As he pushes open the creaking door of the room he’s rented for the night, Cas comes to realize that there are three things wrong with the name of the Great Blue Budget Palace. First, the building is squat and dilapidated. It sits close to the roadside opposite a football field and is flanked on three sides by a gas station, a greasy spoon, and a barely running river. The exterior is painted an obtrusive shade of puce.
When John finally pulls away and closes the door, Dean slumps to his side and braces his forehead on the scratchy back of the passenger seat. He breathes as slowly as he can. Steadily in through his nose and out through his mouth, like he might be able to subdue the screaming pain if he can just get his breathing under control.
“Parker, I know this is a lot,” Dean says after a few moments of tense silence. “But we really need to know what else happened. If we don’t find Kelly in time, she’s not gonna survive this. And the rest of the world won’t be far behind her.”
, he realizes. He can’t touch Dean’s soul without digging through the smoke and sulfur choking it, and as much as he loathes the thought, that’s a part of him now.
“We’re heading back to my place if you want to hang out,” Dean tells him, the words all leaving in a panicked rush, and Castiel wants to scream. Thankfully, Benny turns him down.
And the thing is--it’s fair. Cas shouldn't have to be the one to reach out. Dean’s the one who screwed everything up. Dean’s the one who has to fix it. Dean's the one who has to try.
Time keeps passing. Between one blink and the next, they’re miles from the car accident, somewhere to the east of an Air Force base near San Angelo. A series of low-flying fighter jets sweep overhead in formation, glinting silver against the dark cloud, and as Dean watches them, a fork of lightning cracks the sky ahead.
He squeezes his hand, and Dean’s lip twitches. He looks as though he’s going to say something, and from the tilt of his mouth, Castiel thinks it must be a joke. But he meets his eyes, and something in them softens, and whatever attempt at deflection Dean was about to make dissolves into nothing. Castiel has the distinct impression that Dean had been acting on instinct himself, so used to forcing himself to make light of whatever he was feeling that now that things have changed he doesn’t know what to do.
,” he sighs after a moment. “You’re right. It’s our best option, and as much as I don’t wanna ask him, I bet Sam could walk me through it.”
He’s not certain how he knew to say so, but when he tries to remember the conversation he’s just referenced, it’s all there, as sharp and clear as any other memory he could try to pull forth. He remembers Sam calling him as he’d sat behind the wheel of his truck, waiting for the driver ahead of him to place their order at a drive-through burger joint on the other side of Rock Springs, Wyoming. He remembers Sam’s voice, how irritated he’d been as he’d told him,
Castiel follows him moments later, watching for the chutes of his men below him. He doesn’t see a single one. He hopes it’s just because of the smoke.
Though he knows it may be fruitless—in every sense of the word—he moves closer, clambering over rubble and rock, just in case there’s something more to be found. The energy is still there, after all. It called to him. Still calls.
, shut up,” Dean says, and takes him fully into his mouth, pinning his hips to the sink with his forearm.
“He was—” the past tense hurts to use, sticks in his throat. “I want you to know, Jack. He loved you so much. He was
It seems that no time passes at all before they’re pulling into the cracked parking lot of an unassuming burger joint called Danburger. To one side of the building is a busy Culver’s restaurant; to the other, an auto parts store with a marquee board out front that reads
“Just, um. Didn’t get much sleep last night,” he says, visibly forcing himself to sit a little more casually. “And uh, Parker’s fine.”
, if you don’t mind,” she’d said, “I don’t care to be skyclad in front of just anyone.”) along with a handful of ingredients that won’t arrive until morning, so with the townspeople preoccupied there’s really nothing left to do but wait and hope that Belphegor’s failing barrier will hold long enough for them to make it permanent.
Five cars ago, there had been a handgun in the glove compartment. John kept it. They dumped the Malibu in the middle of the night, in a field scattered with white flowers. They stole their next car just after dawn from a trailhead parking lot several miles away, the owners setting off in the opposite direction with hiking packs strapped to their backs.
“Well, we’re gonna need another angle for that,” Dean goes on as they both climb into the car. “Zoo security probably doesn’t even realize that anything happened, so telling them we need access to their tapes probably won’t work, even if we do make convincing agents. Too much risk it’ll draw attention.”
, I recall that there is a way to see security cameras with your computer if you’re using the same netscape.”
Outside, the engine of the pickup truck he’s been driving since he crash-landed through a Mystery Spot billboard is still slowly ticking as it cools, and Cas casts it a glance as he wonders if he’d be better off back behind the wheel.
“Bah-tlo-mee,” Castiel repeats carefully, and when the man nods Castiel gestures to himself. “Castiel.”
“Yeah. Dr Vallens. She said to call her Mia. She seems okay… Ellen and Bobby are meeting with her now.” Dean’s mouth twitches a little, and he opens his eyes. “Which reminds me… how did that happen?”
The splinter falls silently to the dirt at their feet. Castiel curls the tip of his index finger against the tiny puncture in Dean’s skin, directing his grace as it knits back together.
Pulling into his usual space in the bunker’s garage a little while later, Castiel feels coiled tight as a spring.
“Thank you for allowing me into your home,” he says, though he wonders if any of them speak enough English for the phrase to mean much.
As of this morning, it’s been exactly two weeks since he left. Thirteen days since this seemingly endless rash of thunderstorms started. Twelve days longer than planned.
“What’s the point of a no-parents camping trip if you’re gonna be such an adult about it?” he asks, flinging the gray-blue flannel at Castiel, and laughing when it hits him in the face.
“Nineteen seventy-nine,” Dean says, and chews on his lip before he adds. “The year I was born, actually.”
Staring at the mottled skin, he finds himself thinking about a kid who got lost one summer while they were in fourth grade. Garth had been too adventurous for his own good, and the year before his family had moved someplace out of state, he’d wandered off from a camping trip in Syracuse and slipped down a steep dune. The fall broke his ankle clean in half. It was two days before the search party found him, half buried under the sand.
Sam’s cell phone starts to ring before he can respond, and while he answers, Dean’s longing reaches a fever pitch. It’s only seconds before hurt and anger and confusion and fear all wind together to wrap around it, turning the need to something bitter and awful, and when Castiel unravels it all he’s ruined by what he finds. Dean wishes the longing weren’t there at all. On some level, he’s thinking that his life—that all of their lives—would be easier if he didn’t feel this way about Castiel in the first place.
“That’s right, Dean. Deep breaths. You’re safe,” he says again, and beside him, Sam reaches out to pick up a tumbler from Dean’s bedside table. Dean’s eyes flick over toward him.
Resting his hand on the tree’s gnarled trunk, he closes his eyes and pushes his grace below the surface. It weaves through the porous bark, down through the charred surface and into the fibers of the wood, slipping down between the grains before it bounces back to him, setting off something like a static shock under his skin, tainted with something blue and sharp, metallic and cool, like cloud and stone entwined.
Together, they cross the street, heading for the park that acts as a shortcut between downtown Wichita and their neighborhood in North Central. Though the route isn’t
Also, a note: the standard surgical treatment for Oligodendroglioma does--in rare occasions--result in hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and homicidal ideation. So basically, it's fucking horrible but medically feasible that John should experience this kind of breakdown after his treatment. Like the tags say--cancer is the real bad guy in this situation. Ugh :(
, and every other book and movie that has ever made him think about the concept of free will for more than three seconds, and wonders if Chuck was responsible for their creation in this universe as some kind of private joke shared only with himself.
Dean nods, and tries not to think about the fact that the last time they’d seen her was at Mary’s wake.
“Come back,” Dean murmurs, his palm sliding up Castiel’s chest and around the back of his neck. “Kiss me again.”
“Sorry,” Dean says, embarrassed as he lowers the phone. “Just... I want some proof that this is real, y’know? Picture seemed like a good idea.”
Shadows move across the walls, the trees outside making shapes like long-fingered arms of smoke as every rapid flash of lightning filters through the thin curtain, and for the first time in two weeks, Dean is glad that he’s alone. If John were here, he’d see those shadows and find demons in them. Dean knows better, he
The door scrapes against its frame as it opens, and the sound of Sam snorting in derision is the first thing Castiel hears clearly.
With a sigh, Castiel signs his name at the bottom of the note and leaves it to rest on top of Sam’s closed laptop so he won’t miss it when he gets home.
“No, I’ve got it,” he says automatically, but deflates as soon as he looks up and catches the dubious expression on Dean’s face. He sighs. “The instructions are gone, and last time I set this up, Daniel was yelling at me the entire time.”
Castiel is glad to see that his instincts were correct about the quality of the motel. Their room is small but tidy, with sage green walls and a crisp cream comforter on the bed. Squat round lamps stand on the two nightstands, and a matching ceiling light reflects warm tones off the wooden table and the couch by the door.
He doesn’t realize that they’ve parked until Dean taps on the passenger window from the outside and opens the door.
Maybe that’s the point, he realizes, and feels like an idiot for not figuring it out sooner. Cas is making Dean’s desires his own so that Dean will have to address them. He’s so turned on that the aggravation of realizing he’s been thoroughly outmanoeuvred only makes his blood run even hotter. He doesn’t stand a chance.
“Both,” he agrees. His voice barely sounds like his own, but he’s distantly aware that even though she interrupted his attempt at calming down, she’s distracted him enough that he’s starting to feel a little better anyway.
“It’s date night, remember? I’m meeting Andrea,” he says, gesturing across the street toward the Italian restaurant where his girlfriend works. “You boys have fun, though.”
“I mean… my chances of getting into college aren’t great, Cas. So I’ve been thinking that it’s better if we— if I prepare myself for that now.”
Dean watches him for a moment, then leans forward to dig through the center console for the power cord he remembers seeing there when they stole this car and gave the interior a cursory once-over.
They were wrong, in the end. A one in a million chance is still a chance, and all it takes is a stroke of bad luck to ruin absolutely everything.
Dean hip checks him as he sets off down the street, turning to walk backwards while Cas catches up to him.
Parker Thompson’s house is a two-story brick colonial in Palisades, not far from the hospital where he works.
“It’s… in my time, it’s still not… it’s not perfect. But I don’t have to hide it. My family knows, my friends know. Dad was the only one who had any kind of problem, but Mom laid down the law pretty hard. He’s gone now, anyhow. And I mean, I haven’t brought anyone home in a while. Like… years. I was nineteen the last time I seriously dated anyone--this girl I went to school with, Lisa. And I a friends-with-benefits thing with this guy named Victor back in Lawrence after I got discharged, but not since I moved here.”
Castiel’s hands slide frantically against Dean’s bare shoulders as he tries to remain afloat, and Dean stares at him like he thinks he’s lost his mind.
“You said you wanted to be good for me, Dean. Are you going to be good, or will I need to make you work harder for it?”
Dean sleepwalks through the next four hours, his mind's eye cycling endlessly between horrors. Mary dead. Jack’s eyes burning out. Chuck smirking. Rowena falling into the pit.
At some point, Castiel knows he’s going to have to make Dean think about why it is that he’s decided other people deserve happiness more than he does. Why he’ll casually offer to Castiel—or Sam, or Mary, or literally anyone who crosses his path—what he’d never accept for himself.
As visibly tense as he is up close, to an outside observer, he must look completely harmless. Dean can’t help but wish he’d start speeding again, if only to attract someone’s attention. If someone could see him, could recognize him, then at least, if nothing else, they could get word back to Sam and Cas that he was still alive.
The book spent its first handful of months in the bottom of Dean’s duffle bag. Then, a year or so jammed into the Impala’s glove compartment, and a few after that tucked into the increasingly tattered Steve Madden shoebox with John’s collection of worn out cassette tapes. For several months in 2009, it was wedged under the edge of a mattress in Bobby Singer’s spare room, and then, eventually, it ended up in its current home—nestled between a stolen motel bible and a book of Enochian protection spells in the only bedroom Dean has had to call his own since he was four years old.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel tells him. “You kept telling me we’d find a way to send me back. I thought it was what you wanted.”
Dressed in nothing but a pair of pajama pants, he looks soft and sleep-warm. Dean is powerless to stop himself from going to him. His hands find Castiel’s hips, sliding his palms up his sides as he pulls him close and presses his face against his throat.
For a moment, the sight of Dean shirtless and flushed beneath him as he says those words is enough to keep him from figuring out what’s happened. But then he really takes in the sight. Dean. Shirtless.
Though he knows that the man who did this to Dean was damaged in ways Castiel couldn’t possibly fathom, that he was suffering, confused, terrified—it’s difficult to reconcile that understanding with the sight of his best friend so broken before him.
All the while, Castiel feels Dean’s nerves ratcheting higher and higher. His fear is all tangled up with an involuntary longing for Castiel to be with him through this, but he’d been adamant that he do this alone, so although it pains him, Castiel does not go to him. He just waits.
The water splashes as he goes, and looking down, Dean notices for the first time that he’s taken off his shoes and rolled his pants up to his knees
I have no excuse for this appallingly delayed update--or my horrific two year absence from posting anything at all--apart from awful, soul-crushingly debilitating writers block. Hopefully the drought is over. I hope this chapter was okay, and thank you for reading <3
“Eugh,” Dean says, giving a little shudder at the lingering taste before ducking into the bathroom to pour it down the sink and rinse his mouth. “I stand corrected. You wanna head across the street, call Donna over breakfast?”
“Your needs will never be a burden to me, Dean. Certainly not in this regard. But I need you to tell me what you want, and I need you to trust that when I give it to you, it’s because you deserve it, and because I
As though Castiel is precisely where he should be in time and space; as though this moment, and this moment, and
Tightening his fingers in Cas’ coat, Dean nods, just barely. He’s not panicking, he reminds himself. He’s not panicking.
Dean doesn’t answer for a moment. As Castiel watches him, he looks down at their joined hands and runs his thumb over Castiel’s knuckles. Castiel barely suppresses a pleased shiver at the sensation.
From the other end of the bench, the elderly woman narrows her watery eyes in his direction. Castiel fights off the knee-jerk, cornered-animal impulse to tell her to mind her own business, and offers a tight smile instead.
The ink-dark lines on her skin shift, coiling around her fingers and wrists and disappearing under the long sleeves of her robe. Her eyes are shrewd. Calculating.
Sitting in the passenger seat of his truck, the radio crackling quietly as they slip through dark streets and onto the highway, Castiel watches Sam from the corner of his eye and wonders how long it will take for him to say whatever it is that he’s been struggling to verbalize since they left the farm.
Dean heaves out a breath, his eyes shifting away as though he’s embarrassed to have even asked, and Castiel catches him before he can stand. He kisses the corner of his mouth, then the rise of his cheek, letting his hand linger against his jaw after he pulls away.
to save,” Sam cuts in, the facade of calm he’s been attempting to maintain finally breaking. “Everybody’s gone.”
“What did I do?” Sam asks, and Castiel’s heart breaks at the way he sounds. Voice thick with suppressed tears. “Cas, I didn’t do anything.”
But even after they drop Jo off outside the house, and she heads inside to help Ellen and Bobby start to clear out the spare room, Castiel finds still can’t get the words out. He needs to—he knows—but they’re sticking in his throat.
more developed than two months,” Parker says. Then he blinks with clearly dawning horror. “What’s the gestation period for a… for something like this?”
“Well met, Fitzgerald,” Charlie replies, and turns back to Dean. “Sir Dean, please accompany me to my chambers.”
Pressing a little more firmly against Dean’s sweat-damp skin, edging closer to the place where Dean wants him, Castiel stares at him expectantly.
, asshole. You just spend so much time acting like a human that I get used to treating you like one. And it’s not like I’ve ever seen what’s hiding under the trenchcoat.”
The trees that surround it cast long shadows over the ground. John weaves between them until the car—a rattling brown Fiat hatchback they picked up after dumping the Lumina—is hidden from the road.
“I don’t want to wait for midnight, either,” Cas tells him, and he only waits a moment before giving in, lifting his free hand to Dean’s side and pulling him close.
He only looks up when he hasn’t heard Dean in a while, and when he can’t immediately find him, he feels his chest constrict.
“He won’t mean it,” Sam cuts in. He steps forward, ducking his head a little and forcing Castiel to meet his eyes. “You hurt him, Cas. A lot. But he wants you here. I don’t know if he even realizes how much.”
Staring at him from a few scant inches away, Dean’s eyes flicker back and forth between Castiels. Finally, his gaze holds firm. He raises his chin.
Crossing the room, Castiel draws the same sigil on the other three walls. When he’s done, they glow with a faint pulse of energy before they fade away. He caps the marker and drops it onto the coffee table.
While Dean considers his point, their waitress comes by to refill their mugs and tell Dean his waffles are on their way. Once she’s gone again, he sighs, rubbing at his brow with his knuckles. His hand falls down onto the table, making the cutlery clatter against the ketchup in its little wire basket.
It’s nearing nightfall when they arrive back in Normal, and after Castiel has parked the Zephyr he looks over at Dean with a smile.
“The—” Dean briefly lifts his hands, then lets them fall helplessly back to his sides. “The… I don’t know, man. The freakin’ confessions. The discussion. The… the whole
“The jacket,” he breathes. “Shit. I didn’t-- I forgot. I should have stopped you, but I just… I forgot.”
Castiel had borrowed and forgotten to return before everything went to Hell—and refuse any attempts at reunion that Castiel made.

Inside the crypt, breathing is a little easier. It's musty with old leaves and dust, but the thick stone walls have kept it relatively free of the miasma that permeates the air outside. They set up the spell quickly. For a moment, it seems as though it’s working.
Cas holds perfectly still, hard and pulsing insistently against Dean’s prostate. Dean squeezes around him, and Cas’ mouth falls open at the feeling.
He can tell that Sam noticed. Can tell that he doesn’t want to let it go. He’s always been like a dog with a bone when he knows Dean is withholding something important. But something in Dean’s face, in the inadvertent echo of Sam’s own words, must make him realize that it’s not the time.
He slides another finger alongside the others; twists his wrist and presses deep, rubbing insistently against Dean’s prostate until he sees stars, and sends another burst of grace through him. Dean feels suspended by it. Alight with it. Surrounded and known. Like he could live in this moment forever; like he already has.
It seems to take forever for Cas to climb the stairs. When he finally reaches Dean’s level, he sits down on the other side of the walkway and leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. His fingers twine around one another in a strange, nervous gesture that is far too distracting for Dean to deal with.
Shuffling closer, into the space between Castiel’s splayed legs, Dean runs his hands back down over his chest and presses his mouth to Castiel’s throat. Something swoops in Castiel’s pelvis at the feeling of Dean’s lips, warmth spreading as Dean kisses him again and again, trailing to his shoulder and then his chest as Dean’s hands wander low over his stomach.
The grainy clip is only a few minutes long, but it shows Kelly and an unknown woman emerging from a gray sedan and making the call to Parker Thompson from a payphone on the edge of the lot. The car is angled in such a way that the license plate isn’t visible, and it blocks the sight of Kelly from the chest down.
, a little voice says in the back of Dean’s mind, and he heaves a breath, barely registering the wet sound of it because as soon as he’s got air in his lungs he starts crying again.
Without any other option, he leaves Daniel and makes his way through the trees. He doesn’t find any of the others. Sees no sign of another soul beyond a few stray boot prints that look too old to be of any use, and a dark smear of long-since dried blood on the trunk of a white birch.
Castiel does, sending it further this time. Pressing his love, his desire, his need into Dean’s skin until he can feel it the way Castiel does; soul-deep and soaring.
“You ready?” Dean asks from the doorway as Castiel hesitates, trying to decide whether or not he should say anything else. Whether it would be wise to broach the topic they’re apparently all avoiding.
Castiel taps the screen a couple of times, and after a few awkward moments of asking back-and-forth whether they can be heard, Mary gets to the reason for her call.
No sooner than the words have left his mouth there’s the high-pitched whine of an approaching rocket, and Gabriel’s voice comes through the interphone with something that sounds a lot like
. The hooks in my skin. The way they made me— made me watch, while they pulled me apart. The things they made me do. The things I
Dean just stares, and Castiel wonders if he feels as dizzy as he does; if he can hear his blood rushing in his ears, feel his skin prickling with heat, his pulse thrumming in his throat like a bass note.
“I don’t need you to say anything,” Cas goes on before he can even try to respond. “I just wanted you to hear it.”
“Yeah,” Parker says, seeming confused but relieved by the change in topic. “I mean, we knew each other through a couple of mutual friends, but we weren’t exactly close.”
,” he’d told Dean as he dragged him out of the house, smearing blood along his arm as Dean twisted in his grip, desperate to get back inside, to get Sam out before the fire could spread, to make sure Cas didn’t get hurt trying to help him, to try to wake his mom up, somehow, somehow, because
Castiel simply nods and raises the camera, stretching his arms out as far as he can before he snaps a picture. The flash is blinding, and Dean blinks against the spotty vision, pressing his lips against Castiel’s neck. The flash goes off again as he does.
For his own part, Castiel has given him more openings than his pride would like him to admit, but Dean’s played things so close to his chest the entire time that Castiel has always assumed he didn’t want to deal with it at all.
There’s blood on his lips; more running down his ear. Dean can’t tell if it’s his or someone else's, and it’s only when he’s trying to figure that out that he notices the demon’s absence.
The blacktop is patchy and rough. They head north, then south, then east again, weaving through countless little nameless towns with nothing to show for themselves beyond barely functional gas stations that double as their general stores. When signs start telling them that they’re approaching Galveston, Dean wonders if they’ll actually make it that far before John changes directions again.
Dean snorts, and Castiel is oddly relieved to realise that not everything Dean does is wildly attractive, after all. He finds he wants to kiss Dean again anyway. He does. Dean lets out an amused hum against his lips, and Castiel swallows the sound, humming right back.
He buys bread and rice and tinned tomato soup, the thought of cooking anything more involved for himself to eat alone making him think of Dean again, and avoids the temptation to buy another packet of cigarettes. Since Dean told him about what happened--what
Dean decides that going outside is a great idea. Not because it was suggested but because he’s done with sitting around the house. He opens random doors at the ground floor, trying to find a door to the garden that’s not the front door. He passes by an office that’s surprisingly oldschool compared to the rest of the house, a gym and a second living room, because of course you need that. This one has a fireplace and second door. The door turns out to lead to the garden. It’s really weird that there isn’t any glass in it but it’s probably a deliberate design choice like everything else in this house from hell.
The next time it’s lower. Dean groans. It feels liquid at first, hardening as the pain goes away. The sensation feels familiar but it’s so intense that Dean can’t quite place it. It’s killing him not to know what it is that he’s feeling.
Dean grips the counter harder, too dazed to really be worried about what Castiel’s definition of help is. He takes the time to step out of his shorts completely.
Dean’s dick has gone limp but he’s not going to pass up on the chance for an orgasm so he tentatively starts stroking. He feels extremely exposed, not being able to see Castiel and Castiel most likely still being fully dressed. If Dean was in his right mind that should only be humiliating but instead it helps his erection along. Castiel has stopped moving his fingers and soon Dean is close.
He really don’t have the patience to wait for Castiel to wake up so he decides to move with more force and prays that Castiel is a heavy sleeper.
”And I distinctly remember telling you to address me as ’sir’” Castiel continues as he plucks the glass from Dean’s hand and downs it himself. The bastard.
Castiel pushes two fingers just past the entrance and the stretch feels pleasant and familiar. He pushes them in further and it’s still pretty good. Then he crooks them and Dean’s vision goes white for a second at the sensation. Dean moans.
Castiel nibbles on his earlobe and damn, that feels good ”You’re allowed to come now” Castiel growls at the same time as he’s twisting his hand just so. Dean stops caring about how demeaning it all is as the orgasm tears through him, the lingering pain and fear creating a sensation unlike anything he’s felt before. His body goes limp against Castiel’s.
Dean chances the gamble ”They recognized Ilja, didn’t they? It already looks like you’re harboring me. What are you hoping to achieve by shooting me now? You’re going to look weak. Like you don’t even know what you’re doing. Like you’re desperate not to anger them. You’re not going to look like a leader.”
”Can we go back to my place to get some clothes?” Dean asks ”I’m feeling a little exposed here” he gestures to the robe.
His hand is snatched away and he’s violently rolled over on his back, Castiel straddling him to pin him in place. Dean wriggles to get free, a frustrated hiss escaping his body.
He should probably protest about his shift not being over yet but he doubts that the man would care. He’s turning on the forklift as he’s trying not to freak out about what he’s just agreed to. At least the other man is rather handsome, even if he’s an arrogant piece of shit. And is at least 10 years older than Dean himself. And is a man. Also that. Dean has considered that he might be a little bi before but he had never really had the guts to go for it. He’s pretty sure that this isn’t going to be the gradual easing into it that he had planned.
Castiel reaches up to push two fingers into Dean’s mouth ”Do you enjoy this, little one? Having a cock shoved down your throat?”
The man shrugs ”Shame, you’re awfully pretty to go to jail for unpaid debt, but it’s up to you I guess.”
”I have people for that” Castiel says as if it’s the most obvious thing. To be fair, it kind of is, at this point. Especially as Dean is looking at the white modern house with a well-kept front yard of carfully placed stones and green bushes.
Dean slowly taps out the code and the safe opens with a click. Dean has a second to notice that there’s a gun in the safe before a loud noise from the workshop draws the attention of the leader. Dean wastes no time in grabbing the gun and as if watching from a distance he sees himself shoot the other man in the stomach.
Dean feels like screaming but reaches back anyway, the motion forcing him to rest his head on the floor.
Dimitri is wrapping the tattoo when Balthazar walks in. His eyes immediately go to Dean’s shoulder. He closes his eyes for a second and his mouth moves as if he’s praying. Then he plasters on a smile and goes to talk to Bobby in Russian.
Dean is pretty buzzed when he heads up to the bedroom. He’s trying very hard not to think about what Castiel is going to want. The dude already came twice today, shouldn’t that be plenty? Dean is starting to second guess the choice of keeping the collar on. At the time he’d thought of it as a gesture of good faith. After all, he had agreed to the deal and usually his word was worth something. And the collar doesn’t even bother him that much. The biggest issue is that its presence is making it impossible to ignore the situation.
Dean has come to regret his stance on the matter on condoms since taking it. But Castiel has been avoiding that kind of sex since so it hasn’t really come up. And Dean has not quite been ready to breach the subject himself. He still thinks that it’s a terrible idea. For all he knows, Castiel could be actively having sex with other people. But he also wants to come. And he wants to see the look that Castiel gets when Dean gives him what he wants.
”I didn’t tell you to stop” Castiel says and Dean realises that he’s stopped. He resumes his task, telling himself that there’s only a single day left and then he can get out of here.
He’s pretty sure that Castiel sees his reluctance but the other man takes the collar from him anyway and motions for him to turn around. Dean turns, it’s probably not going to be so bad. Castiel wraps the collar around his neck and tightens it.
Castiel starts moving his finger, the whole thing mostly being uncomfortable but Dean hopes that Castiel knows what he’s doing.
Balthazar is unsurprisingly a reckless rider and at several points Dean is close to suggesting that he can walk instead. Instead he just clings to Balthazar and tries his best to trust him.
Dean is going to get whiplash from the sudden shifts in Castiel being gone and Castiel being everywhere. He feels intensely alone as Castiel closes the door behind him.
It hasn’t been an issue before. The toilet is in a seperate room and Castiel hasn’t been the type to lounge around in the bedroom. Dean considers going to find another shower but he doubts that that’s going to fly with Castiel.
He cries out as his orgasm is finally allowed to consume him. The blindfold intensifying the sensation and his mind conjuring an image of Castiel’s intense stare. Dean pants as he comes back down.
”Very good. I much prefer you like this” Castiel has put the paddle down and is skimming his hands up Dean’s sides. Dean whines and leans into the gentle carress.
Dean doesn’t even have time to consider being angry about this. The only thing he hears is the implication that Castiel will at some point want to see the piercings. And that means that he’s still interested. Dean’s grin is sincere this time.
”What you’re looking for is in the middle part” Dean tells him. The rest is just filled with drunken ramblings.
”Look, I said I’m sorry. I don’t really know what else you want from me” Dean is getting increasingly pissed at this guy. Okay, so maybe it was totally his fault but there really isn’t any reason to be this unpleasant about it.
Castiel continues for another second and then pulls back. ”So perfect” Castiel murmurs. He reaches out to squeeze Dean’s dick once before reaching for the box.
Castiel rummages around for something that Dean hopes is lube. His hope is confirmed as Castiel presses against his hole with a slick finger.
The sensation is overwhelming, the feeling of something around his neck feels overpowering and way too intimate ”Please, can you loosen it” Dean croaks ”sir” he hastily adds, hoping that it will better his chances. To his surprise Castiel actually does loosen it but it makes no difference. It’s simply the collar that feels this way to wear. The leather feels as if it’s caressing him and he feels strangely exposed.
Castiel releases his face and reaches up for the phone that’s on the bedside table. He holds out the phone for Dean to type the code with shaking fingers.
His frightened eyes meets Castiel’s in the mirror but Castiel just orders him to relax and keeps pushing in. Dean tries to pull away and even though he is stuck against the dresser Castiel still notices it. Castiel pinches his nipple hard.
Nonono, not jail. Dean imagines Sam’s dream of a college education crumbling and how it’s qoing to be even harder finding a job after getting out of jail. Dean’s definitely feeling sick now. The man is opening the car door ”stop” Dean manages to say ”what is it exactly that you want me to do?” he asks as he’s looking down at the ground as he can almost feel his last reserve of self-respect crumbling.
The man gets in and eyes Dean suspiciously ”It wasn’t enough to just brutalize my car? You have to fondle it as well?”
They stand there for a while, Castiel pulling Dean tightly against him and panting while Castiel’s dick softens inside of him. Dean is still incredibly hard and he prays that Castiel is going to allow him to come.
The fifth time his body starts reacting. The intense sensation of pain on the border to becoming too much making his body feel electric. His entire being narrows in on the anticipating of the next time it’ll happen, not knowing where on his body. So far it’s only been in places where the bone is close to the skin and it feels like he’s at least a little bit protected, leaving room in his mind for savoring the intense feeling of it. Fear spikes through him at the thought of it happening near his waist or his thighs, he’s not sure that he could stand that. But there isn’t anything he can do, his only hope is that Castiel has mercy on him. He pushes himself further into the mattress anyway, his body straining to get away.
”Yes, Dean. I would take care of everything. I can even get you somewhere to live when one of us ends the arrangement.”
Castiel replies with an even voice as if he’s unaffected by having his fingers inside of Dean ”I haven’t heard anything. And then Balthazar chooses to rub it in my face by showing you off like that”
”And it looks like you bask in the attention” Castiel’s voice is hard ”Do you enjoy playing the whore for Balthazar?”
Castiel runs the razor over his skin and Dean realizes that he’s holding his breath and makes an effort to start breathing again. Castiel is kneeling on the floor in front of him.
