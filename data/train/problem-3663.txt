“I’m an auto mechanic, I work with my Dad and Uncle,” Dean states, his hands anchored on the narrow waist of his Alpha. He towers over him, the other man feels so slight compared to him, but looking at him… he knows the Alpha isn’t done growing yet.
Suddenly, Dean is no longer alone on the dais. A very tousled haired man has appeared and appeared out of thin air as it would seem. The stranger is wearing bright orange boxer briefs, a black tee-shirt, with his tail flicking behind him. His eyes are glued to Dean, one eyebrow raised, and full of mischief. His collarbones are littered with dark bruises, leaving the congregation with no doubts of the extra-curricular activities he had been involved in recently.
After Dean parks the car in the driveway, he reaches over and pulls one of Castiel’s hands into his own. Bringing it up to his lips, Dean places a lingering kiss and rests Castiel’s hand between his own against his chest. His heart beating loudly even to himself.
“I’m not old, damnit, I’m still young and fun,” he ends his tirade with a little pout. Cas, behind the wheel, tries to stifle his grin by hiding it behind his hand. He’s trying to play it off like he’s nodding and rubbing his lips in thought with his elbow resting on the window sill, the other hand on the wheel, but the crinkles of pleasure around those blue eyes give him away.
Castiel loves listening to Dean’s soft cries of passion, for him to fall apart and to feel him shake. His Omega is a strong, devastatingly handsome man and Castiel takes great joy breaking him down to a quivering mess in the bedroom. Dean’s hips move and flex, searching for more, reminding Castiel to touch his Omega’s cock, beautifully flushed and leaking, he wraps a hand around the appendage loving the feel of its weight in his hand. Occasionally, in the heat of his ruts, he’ll beg Dean to fuck him… intent only on reaching the pinnacle of pleasure. Pausing, Castiel wonders if that is something Dean would like for his birthday.
“... and she’s done it three times now, the last time she pushed her alert it was ten thirty in the morning, there were plenty of people around but she told the dispatcher she was “alone and scared and could smell something”. You have to come and talk to her, Castiel, she is incorrigible! Poor Captain Winchester has arrived with his crew each time to investigate non-existent emergencies!”
Heat pools in Dean’s belly and he knows his orgasm is now inevitable, he sees Castiel’s whole body tighten like a coil… ready to spring at any moment. Castiel’s hand stutters and stops as the young dragon tries to keep his focus, guiding his hand with his own he feels the tingling warning approaching.
“Omega,” he breathes, a dazed smile lighting up his face. Rushing to Dean, almost knocking him over in the process, his Alpha plants his nose squarely to Dean’s scent gland and draws in long slow breaths. His Alpha is making nonsensical happy noises, his hands wandering all over Dean. Petting and reverently touching Dean’s arms, his back, his neck. Cassie pulls their bodies close together, chest to chest.
“Huh,” Dean thinks to himself “If you're a guy isn’t it more of a ‘shaft stroke’?” he laughs at the terrible dick joke, and holds his breath to duck dive and swim under the water towards Cas.
As the night wore on, Cas had become quite handsy, resting a hand on Dean’s knee, the warmth of him bleeding through the denim, grasping his shoulder, or resting his palm against the skin at his waist. Dean was not averse to his advances but held back while the girls were still in attendance.
Feeling a little defiant, Dean smirks and swallows Cas down, making his Alpha moan even louder. He wants Cas to scream with pleasure. Dipping his fingers into his own heat, Dean gathers enough to coat his fingers. He gets a bit distracted, because even his own fingers feel heavenly. Twisting his tongue around Cas’ tip, he focuses one hand on his mate’s shaft and his wet fingers circling his lover’s hole.
“You know,” Dean says aloud “My mom would be hella pleased that you exist,” Dean says munching on his toast, “She’s always said mythical creatures have a basis in reality. But as much as I’d love to ring her up right now, I think you hanging out with me will remain our little secret.”
“Come on guys, I don’t need anything. And besides you can still do something for me. The day is still young and I’ve got just the thing in mind,” Dean replies easily with a cheeky grin waving his fork around the kitchen, “While your Dad and I have a drink you all can clean up the kitchen.”
“You are so beautiful,” Cas sighs, running his hands Dean’s neck and over his shoulders. The pads of his fingers massaging the nape of his neck.
“Cas,” he croaks words he can barely hear himself, “you’re so big.” Then Dean slips into darkness once again.
“Dean, you’re a religious man, I presume, and an educated one. I don’t know how much of the church’s early dogma and suspicion you believe, and it really doesn’t matter.”
“Pa,” Ben’s quiet voice cracks and wavers as he watches Dean warily. “Are you ok? I put all the towels in the wash like you wanted.”
Cold stings his face, jerking his eyes back open. His consciousness sluggishly realizing that the cold sting is the winter wind, and not the freezing water of the pond.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas cries, blinking back the tears welling in his eyes and stilling. Overwhelmed by the sensation of being in Dean’s tight, wet hole.
Sitting on the wood floor, going through all of his winter things, Dean pulls out a thickly knitted sweater, cream, and pretty that Eileen bought him a few Christmasses ago. He feels Castiel’s arms wrap around his torso, his chilled nose pressing into Dean’s hairline.
Dean’s voice breaks, out of steam, he swallows and looks away from Castiel, “Look, I’m lonely. I have no one here but you and… I’m just lonely.”
In the morning, Castiel kisses him so sweetly that it basically brings tears to Dean’s eyes. His Alpha texts him at lunchtime to let him know that he’s got dinner handled and that during his break he found a few garages that were hiring. Dean feels over the moon with relief for the rest of the day, nothing the other men say at work can soil his mood.
“Daddy puked too,” Claire answers, putting away the juice. Struggling to open the fridge but smiling huge when she finally gets it.
“Because this is my frickin’ Alpha,” Dean says, shoving the sweatshirt in his face and inhaling through his nose and mouth. His mouth salivates and he can feel slick start producing again. He closes his eyes at the sensation and gets lost in it. It’s so calming, so good, pure perfection. And then it hits him...Oh God, his Alpha is out there and he doesn’t even know where to start.
It is not till the fourth week that he hears the tinkling laughter of children, that hope surges in Dean’s chest. Early morning before the sun is fully up, two towheaded children appear in the atrium, whispering to each other in Enochian and digging in one of the flower beds.
Dean has missed this so much, he almost wants to cry with how right it feels to have his Alpha in his arms, and have his Alpha’s arms around him in return. He finally, after all these months feels safe, feels wanted, and feels loved.
Dean Winchester can’t know what’s been wiped clean from his mind. But he does know that he’s always owned this little bar, it’s out of town a ways, but known for good beer, better burgers and great company.
“I know that Dean, this is all we are doing,” Castiel sassily replies, nipping Dean’s ear, “Now hush or I won’t let you ride me tonight.”
“Yeah, yeah, I like it.” Dean laughs out, feeling the rush of fondness and euphoria through his blood.
Cas shifts bringing one hand up to card through Dean’s damp hair, and it feels amazing. He shudders through a deep breath as if recovering from a bout of tears.
Dean stares on, completely dumbfounded that everyone is so accepting that Castiel can turn into a freakin’ dragon!
“I guess I have, in a vague general way. Why do you ask?” Cas reaches across the table to clasp one of Dean’s strong hands with his own.
With a smile, Dean walks slowly, if a little gingerly to the altar as the last of the congregation take their seats and make themselves comfortable. He crosses himself and bows his head as he takes his place behind the altar ready to address his people and his God.
“If you find Cassie lacking,” Michael drawls, seductive and just a tad bit skeevy, “You’ll know where to find me.”
Bobbing his head and sucking hard, he makes sure his teeth graze ever so lightly along the shaft which makes Cas shout hoarsely in pleasure. Wrapping a hand around the root and playing with his balls, Dean makes sure he presses a finger onto Cas’ prostate making his mate pant and moan prettily. A salty burst of precome flavors his tongue and Dean moans again, the vibrations making Cas’ hips stutter and his cock twitch in Dean’s mouth.
“I hope my children are pleasant company,” Castiel growls after finally dropping his piercing gaze from Dean’s eyes.
“Dean, stay here. You lost so much body heat when you slipped under the ice, I thought I had lost you,” Cas’ voice wavers, and Dean can feel the emotional shudder run through Cas’ body, “I thought I had lost you twice, once to the cold water, and the second time because I could not warm you up. You were so cold, Dean.
Gratefully, they have stopped at a remote manor house. The house was made of stone and seemed to grow from the forest floor, nestled as it was between the trees.. It is peaceful and also the most beautiful place he’s ever seen. The Manor has but a few floors but the symmetrical wings make a perfect square surrounding a lush atrium filled with green. Raised flower beds overflow with herbs and vegetables, and the fruit hangs heavy on sturdy trees. The scent is overwhelming and wonderful and Dean uses his clasped hands to wipe away the tears of relief from his eyes.
“No, I was not interested in them,” Cas replies, solemnly. His eyes never quite leaving the dash to look at Dean.
As they land back in the grass, Cas releases Dean whereby he throws himself down dramatically and lies prone, glaring at the dragon.
With a crack of ozone, a strong whoosh of air sweeps through the chapel bringing a strong smell of sulfur. The pungent aroma sticks to the back of Dean’s throat as he attempts to speak. His heart skipping a beat as he realizes that his congregation is ogling a space to the left of him, where there should be empty air.
Dean does finally look away, unable to meet Cas’ gaze as he tries to piece together his disjointed memories. “Cas, were you, like, huge? I mean you watch TV with me, and you’re warm and cute, and sit with me on the couch, but today you were so strong and kinda majestic and...
Taking a deep breath against the burning pain, Dean repeats each word after Castiel. Gritting  his teeth and hissing through the literal fire, “...I share my soul with you, my dragon.”
With sure movements, Cas fills the tub with water and bubbles and sinks in. Cas’ legs are stretched out as much as he can in the little pink tub, sitting up he gazes up at Dean, cheeks tinged pink from the heat and their combined anger, “Get in, please.”
Her proclaiment makes Dean tear up all over again, and Castiel can’t quite tell if it’s because of Claire’s thoughtfulness or being denied pie on his birthday.
“You know, that’s my favorite coffee cup. I don’t mind you taking a little nap but man, don’t make a habit of it. There are plenty of coffee cups on this shelf,” Dean gestures to the rest of the coffee mugs stacked neatly in a row, “Really, I should stick you outside but because it’s freakin’ freezing you can stay and chill. Not doing anything anyways.”
It’s a beautiful Sunday morning in Spring, and Pastor Dean is almost ready to welcome his congregation. As he finishes wiping over the pews, he is ready to approach the altar. As expected his demeanour changes to reflect the more sober and dedicated side of Pastor Winchester. Dean stops humming, and his step slows and steadies as he walks up the nave. Stopping midway he bows his head in respect and makes the sign of the cross. He approaches the altar leisurely and busies himself lighting the candles, and making sure nothing mars the pristine white altar cloths.
“Come back to bed,” the man intones, sitting up and patting the bed, “I’ve never interacted with a guardian before. Don’t be mad.”
And with that, they rush from the diner to the amusement of those close enough to catch the gist of their conversation.
“We are not related,” Castiel retorts, but his heavy hand doesn’t let go of Dean’s neck. With a click of the door, Dean’s alone with his Alpha.
Jerking his head up, Dean meets those clear eyes once again. Mouth parting in surprise, a question on the tip of his tongue. He swallows it back down.
“I can tell you are ruminating,” Castiel comments when they pull up into Mary’s driveway and exit the car. Dean sighs, the crisp grass and dead leaves crunching underneath their feet.
In the evenings, Dean or Castiel read out loud by the fire after dinner. Casual touches between them do not go unnoticed. A hand on Dean’s shoulder when Castiel is pleased, the brush of shoulders as they walk together. But each evening they bid each other goodnight and Dean spends his nights alone. It’s a quiet life, similar to the life he had with Sam back home. He takes the task of teaching both Claire and Jake swordplay and hand-to-hand combat. Claire blooms under his tutelage and is better and quicker than Jack. Castiel even joins in, his powerful but shorter frame always winning their sparring matches.
Before he knows it...the ice breaks with a sickening crack and the icy black water swallows him whole. The chill slowly seeps into his body. The water stings his eyes, burns his skin. Dean can’t find the break in the ice, he’s gotten turned around somehow in his descent into the freezing water. His fists beat against the barrier above, his lungs burning and knuckles bleeding, but Dean knows he can punch a hole if he tries hard enough. His limbs slow, as filled with lead. Dean feels the cold slip away, he’s starting to feel numb and then the dangerous warmth of sleepiness.
“Off the ice, Castiel,” Dean shouts, when he hears another stress crack of the pond. Heart racing, he watches as Castiel stumbles towards the shore of the pond. He doesn’t concentrate on himself until Castiel is sitting in the snow, jerkily removing the clamped skates from his boots. The shouts of onlookers, the ice shifting and groaning, and his own heartbeat in his ears slow time for Dean.
“Yes, Gram. Any time you are in trouble, or you are worried about anything and I’m not here - you can push the button if you need to.”
“So? It's not like any of us have real mothers,” Kaia says, scrunching up her nose looking at Dean and Cas.
The congregation is silent, watching the drama unfold. Their heads swing from the Pastor to his companion and back.
Dean looks over at his handsome young mate, all of eighteen years old, still growing into himself. Dean imagines they will grow and change together. Learn new things together, become parents together, grow old together. Dean knows those blue eyes will never change, though. Castiel’s eyes are practically glowing because of the late evening sun streaming through the diner windows. His messy hair even messier because of the sex they had when it was damp. He’s so handsome to Dean. He doesn’t want to lose sight of how much he enjoys just
They kiss, Dean’s technique lethargic and sloppy now, but he’s careful not to get any of their mutual release on Castiel’s work clothes.
Folgers reaches the shallow jar and starts to climb in before halting and looking back at Dean questioningly. “Go ahead, buddy. Climb in if that’s what’ll make you happy.” Folgers does just that, he clambers into the jar and sits atop the small pile of coins. The coins make a light clinking sound as Folgers draws more toward his lap with his claws.
Laughing, Castiel kisses him. Though it's more teeth than a true kiss, “I suppose you can say that I’ve set you aflame. Let’s go to the lodge, relax in that hot tub and get some sleep?”
Sinking realization hits Dean, “Yes! Son of a bitch.” Scrambling, trying to wipe his neck with his hand where he rolled on his scent blockers this morning. A pack of wipes slaps the side of his head poorly thrown by Gabe.
“You did,” Cas smiles beautifully. “From my sweatshirt?” Cas’ eyes dart down to the sweatshirt on the bed and up to Dean’s own.
The majority of the day is spent that way, Folgers either in his mug or on Dean’s shoulders while Dean does his other chores. He dusts, vacuums, and gets his work laundry done for the week. When he finally finishes and after the two of them have dinner together, Folgers snuggles in the middle of Dean’s chest underneath his shirt while Dean watches some of his TV programs he didn’t get the chance to watch the past week. The dragon’s body curled up and close to Dean’s heart. His head poking out of the collar resting on the slope of Dean’s collar bone. Occasionally, the dragon’s tongue sneaks out to lick the salt of Dean’s skin, a pleased look on his long face.
He knows his mate is tired. Taking care of a busy three and a half and a two-year-old is exhausting. Castiel knows, he tries to let Dean sleep in on the weekend, and by the time his mate gets up… he’s exhausted. He can’t imagine going all day with those two. He starts the machine and goes over to his mate.
“No,” Dean barks fed up, “Your fucking team doesn’t need to show up to our anniversary lunch. Or my birthday. If you really wanted to spend time with me. You would. Instead, you hang out with your classmates while I am home waiting around like a dumbass. I bust my ass at a job every day where I’m sexually harassed by misogynistic assholes. I deserve some of your fucking time. I deserve-”
Cas opens his mouth to ask what on earth is going on, but cannot seem to make words. He looks at his Gram, and then at the man sitting comfortably at her table who then looks up at Cas and smiles. Cas is lost the minute he meets the stranger’s eyes. Something shifts deep in his chest, and his stomach explodes with butterflies. The man’s eyes are an unusual shade of green, but it is his face that Castiel cannot look away from. The man is stunning, in a manly way. More than handsome, beautiful.
Cas is relieved, but embarrassed and baffled by his Gram’s behaviour. “Yes, Pam, of course. I’ll call Gram and tell her I’ll be in tomorrow to talk to her.”
“Gabriel,” Gabe adds cheekily, “Cassie will be here soon, just got out of a lab. Oh shit, I’m so looking forward to this.”
It’s a common expectation that Alphas prefer their Omegas hairless and so Dean shaved. He didn’t mind shaving, but now… he kinda likes the hair. It feels nice curling around his cock, balls, and even his hole. Dean even lets his beard grow in and it all kinda feels nice.
Dean leads the way from the bar, hyper-aware of the warmth of Castiel’s hand at the small of his back. Dean had enjoyed Cas’ company as they walked back to his cottage, Dean pointed out his church and the gardens as they had walked.
Dean pulls out the knife and rope, handing them over easily to his lover. Dean bites at the tip of gloves, easily pulling them off and stuffing them in pocket and Castiel does the same. They stand close to the fire, one of Dean’s hands clasped in Castiel’s.
Dean leans back and kicks his feet up. Boots resting comfortably on an empty keg. His gaze is still directed at the display of spirits and liqueurs. He wonders if it’s time to get them all down and dust them.
Leading him farther into the river, Castiel dunks Dean into the water rinsing him. He dips down and rinses, his dark hair plastered back to his head. Castiel inspects Dean, running his hands over his shoulders and looking for spots of filth that he may have missed. Dean keeps his head down, he’s no longer a Lord in his own right, he’s a treasonous prisoner. A spoil of war. It will do him no favors if he fights.
“No, my brother is,” Dean answers, and kisses his Apha’s thumb, causing the other man to full-body shiver.
“I don’t know,” Dean reports, but knowing himself… he probably will. He really likes sex. He was planning on sleeping with Jo when he thought Jo was his Alpha.
Castiel’s Gram is looking at him for all like the cat who got the cream. Pleased doesn’t begin to cover it.
Cas watches his Gram closely, he’s sure there’s something more to her seemingly innocent question, something crafty in the playful glint in her eye.
“I’ve had no reason to answer your call,” Castiel answers, his usually warm voice icy with hatred. “I will not return to bear the next generation for you. I will not mate with someone I have not freely chosen. I will not be bound by your archaic and outdated ideas of how our society and those within it should behave,” Castiel is almost breathless as he spits the last words at Naomi.
Castiel looks like he’s going to burst out of his skin with frustration. Thinking about his words carefully, Dean pulls Castiel into a hug. At first, Castiel is unyielding but then after a few quiet minutes he melts into Dean’s embrace. With his face pushed into Dean’s chest he mumbles “They wouldn’t be babies, Dean. They’d be fledgelings.”
As Cas lands, Dean hops out of the saddle to duck and roll into the grass. He spreads out and lets out a happy sigh. Watching Castiel’s transformative bright light fill his backyard, then morph into the man he has grown to love. He reaches up, tangles their fingers together and Dean kisses the middle of his palm, soft lips press and he tastes the salt of Castiel’s skin.
As the car eats up the hour or so between his house and Shady Acres, he feels so grateful to his Gram for the times they shared together in the big house that Cas now inhabits alone.
“Good boy,” John softly whispers, meeting his eyes. He’s a man, Sam is a man, but to their father they’ll always be boys. Fighting with wooden swords in the field behind their estate, jumping over the fences and dodging sheep. Stealing pastries from the cooks kitchen and hiding behind their mother’s skirts.
Dean trails his kisses down his husband’s neck before dropping his head into Cas’ lap. He licks the weeping slit teasingly as he looks up at his Alpha through his lashes for a second before turning all his attention to the cock he is about to devour.
The state of Castiel’s undress highlights the state of Dean’s panicked dress. Dean is decked out for mountain climbing. Or for emergencies. Whatever. He’s taking no chances. Flying is dangerous and everyone knows it. He’d even searched around for a helmet but couldn’t find anything but Jack’s bright blue one from when he was eight years old. Dean highly doubts a child’s bicycle helmet would help him if he falls off the back of an enormous dragon.
Licking his lips, eyes wide, his Alpha looks so unsure. Dean can almost see his thoughts churning around in his head, so Dean kisses him again. Hopefully scrambling his brain and devouring all those concerns in the process. Cas gasps and shudders and moans so prettily that Dean keeps it up, pushing them both to the edge and they still have their clothes on.
Cas fits his lips against Dean’s like they are meant to be there. Soft and warm, with a hint of pressure. He cards his fingers through Dean’s hair, teasing and pulling his lips softly between his own. Parting his lips, Castiel’s tongue dips inside eagerly rolling against Dean’s. A throaty moan of pleasure escapes his throat, it’s been such a long time since Dean’s been kissed like this, worshiped like this, treasured like this. His hands grasp onto Castiel’s shoulders, pulling the other man’s body towards his own.
Breaking the gaze, Dean is grabbed and steered away from Prince Castiel by a foot soldier. He stumbles, his hands still tied behind him. A rope is wrapped around his neck and Dean is hitched to his very own horse. Impala whinnies in fright, but Castiel appears shushing her in Andover’s high court tongue of Enochian. She calms and Castiel mounts her in one smooth motion, angering Dean.
“I hope so,” Cas says, pouring his coffee, he grabs his Omega before the man darts out of the kitchen to shower, “I love you so much, happy birthday.”
“You're older than me, aren't you?” Cas’ blush is back and his little Alpha looks so timid in the moment.
Dean watches as the Prince dresses. Soft clothes fall and drape perfectly over Castiel’s lithe yet muscular body. Dean sits quietly, partially in shock but mostly enraptured by this powerful man before him. His shoulder burns and he feels loose and languid from his unexpected orgasm, but he ignores the sensations remaining wary of the man before him. Though Michael rules, it is well known that the youngest Prince of Andover may be the most powerful of all the brothers.
“Look at you,” Dean teases and nips at Cas’ neck, the heel of his hand pressing against the tight fabric. “Is this fun enough for you?”
Dressed in a cheap suit, wearing a slimy smile, the man throws what is left of their saddle at Castiel’s feet.
“You're 130, man. You tellin’ me that your parents had you on house arrest the entire time?” Dean asks, his thumb rubbing back and forth over the hand that is practically crushing his own.
Dean reaches across to wipe ketchup from Cas’ mouth with the side of his thumb. “Have you ever thought about the rest of our lives?”
“Oh Dean, thank you!” Cas’ hands grip tightly, shifting on the shaft as he comes to grips with the fleshy life preserver presented to him.
“South Dakota?” Cas; voice rumbles softly, his sour scent stinking up the room. It smells like a forest fire, choking the life out of Dean.
“Dean,” Jo pleads, pulling on his clothes. They are back in her dorm room, he had run into her at Sammy’s dorm and instantly knew. Dressed in an oversized baggy sweatshirt and those black yoga pants and just... smelling like his mate. Even though Dean hasn’t seen Jo since she was eight years old, he would have never thought she would have ended up an Alpha, especially one that smells like home to him.
Nodding his head enthusiastically, he can be quiet for his Alpha. He can do whatever his Alpha wants.
“What do you want, Omega?” The way the Alpha says Omega as if it is a filthy insult sends a chill down Dean’s spine. This guy is dangerous. And Dean knows how to handle dangerous Alphas. There’s only one way and that’s to never let them gain the upper hand. Whether it’s an argument or a fist fight, Alphas will always underestimate an Omega, and Dean has always used this to his advantage.
He follows Cas and the rest of his family through to the kitchen, Mary turns and says brightly “We don’t stand on ceremony here, Cas. Dean, find your friend a drink.” With that, she continues through and is soon slicing bread presumably to go with their meal.
Gazing into those blue eyes, rolling his lips between his teeth and licking them, Dean bites down on his bottom lip to keep the emotions at bay.
Cas is keening with desire, softly panting and clutching at Dean as if would bodily disappear. Dean has never felt more wanted, more desired. In the eyes of this incredible creature he was captivating and attractive, not a man worn down with time and hard work, a man with more years under his belt that he liked to count. Dean took a moment to fully appreciate what the dragon, his charge, his partner was offering him. The younger man is so beautiful in the subdued light of the garage. Dust motes dance between them in a shaft of sunlight, as Dean releases Cas’ head and takes his hands.
Castiel puts his phone on the counter and wonders why his Grandma would want to know the exact time he’s planning to come? He runs a palm over his face, deciding he doesn’t need to shave and heads to his room to swap out his sweats for jeans and a button down.
“I went to see Jimmy, I didn’t go to Audrey’s like I said,” she whispers only for Dean’s ears, “I hope you don’t mind, Dad told me it was fine that I could see him.”
“Well, this is painful to watch,” Gabriel mocks on his corner of his bed, stuffing a handful of popcorn into his mouth and chewing obnoxiously. He swallows loudly and slurps out of a cup from a gas station loudly. “Cassie, this guy thinks you're his Alpha.”
“Ummm, I’ve been letting my hair grow but… uh, what do you think about it?” Dean asks hesitantly, waving at his flaccid cock and peach fuzz balls.
,” keens Castiel, hips undulating, searching for friction. Castiel’s hand glides down Dean’s back to grab at his butt cheek, pulling the two men closer.
Dean reaches out to place his hands on Castiel's chest. “Turn around, let’s get you unzipped and out of these wet things.”
A particular arrangement of branded bottles catches his eye, it’s a triad of Captain Morgan’s, Absolut Vodka and raspberry and Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum. The way the bottles are sitting and the manner in which the labels are aligned means that from his vantage point all he can see is CAS.
It’s been three days of enduring the indignity of trudging behind his own horse, being carelessly fed bread and water whenever they stopped for rest. His only view is that of Prince Castiel’s back flexing, his shoulders cloaked in bright metal, and his hair curling around his ears. Dean is exhausted and hopeless. There isn’t any fight left in him. His skin itches and he’s unsure if his body will survive the journey back to the capital.
Dean is wide eyed and speechless as Cas gathers Dean’s hands into his own. His lips trembling, “I swear we will be soul bound as soon as you can fly with confidence. I swear this on my name and the names of my ancestors.”
“Dean,” Cas pants when Dean swallows him back down and presses a finger against his hole. He’s slow, letting Cas get used to the sensation, applying a steady pressure then dipping his finger inside. In and out, so slow gathering his own slick and simultaneously sucking on Cas’ cock like he’s dying for it.
“Always, my keeper,” Castiel intones, pressing an open mouthed kiss to Dean’s neck as he steps into the stream of water. Cas is all business, soaping up their bodies, washing their hair, and avoiding Dean’s twitching erection that hangs heavily between his legs.
in boxers in late January. The house is a little nippy, it’s an old house that they purchased with the dream of filling it with their children, so he goes into their bedroom and grabs clothing for his mate. Returning to Jack’s room, Castiel drops to his knees and puts socks on Dean one foot at a time. With some effort, he slides sweatpants up Dean’s hips, kissing his baby boy and Dean softly.
Castiel nods, a warm and steady hand once again on his bicep steadying him in the flowing river. One of the Prince’s hands seems to always rest on Dean somewhere; and Dean finds an odd pleasure and a modicum of comfort in that. He watches as the Prince leans down into the river to gather silt from the bottom, his golden skin taut over flexing muscles. To Dean’s surprise, the Prince coats the cool mud directly onto the rope burns that circle his neck and his wrists. Cool magic tingles over Dean, gently healing his broken skin and giving him a shiver of goosebumps in the process. Dean’s never felt magic before, it’s a heady feeling. He feels a wave of pleasure wash through him and, and he cannot stop his hips jerking, looking for some kind of friction to ease the heavy ache in his groin.
“And how old are you Castiel?” Dean asks, looking at the youthful and breathtakingly beautiful man in front of him. Big cerulean eyes, sharp cheekbones, fluffy dark hair, golden skin taut over defined muscles. Castiel has a runner’s build, only marginally shorter than his own six feet. Dusky pink nipples are stark against his flawless chest. Dean’s bed linens pool in Castiel’s lap, barely covering the sharp hip bones.
Dean whites out from the pleasure, his climax erupting out splashing out onto his chest and Castiel’s hand. The sweet pleasure is singing in his veins and it doubles when he feels his mate’s release pulse warm within him along with Castiel’s soft and lovingly whispered ‘Dean.’
The change in Cas is enough to give Dean whiplash, his eager and loving mate is gone and in his place is an enraged Alpha. The change in his scent has Dean reeling, and in the blink of an eye, Cas is dressed, his hands are washed in their ensuite, and he’s holding out Dean’s clothes. Groaning, Dean gets dressed clumsily, his limbs not quite cooperating.
Hands splayed down Castiel’s back, Dean shifts so he can look at his dragon, “You are tellin’ me that dragons are like clown fish?”
“Dean, I want you, now.” With that he pushes Dean by the shoulders and they sink together into the softness of the comforter. Dean opens his legs and Cas makes himself comfortable between them. The both groan as the planes of their hips meet, and the growing arousal of each man can be felt by the other. They kiss, deeply, Cas’ tongue seeks entrance and Dean welcomes him in with his own. Their kisses grow heated as their passion grows, their breathing becoming ragged.
“And Sammy, he has these crazy dogs, took me a while to warm up to them I’ll admit, but they’ve turned out good for mutts. Don’t tell Sammy I said that though, I like to complain about the drool and the hair - keeps Sammy on the back foot, y’know?” Dean is emptying the pockets of the clothes next to be washed as he talks.
“Thank you Castiel. I might see you tomorrow then.” Pam disconnects the call and Castiel can almost feel her relief at passing this conundrum on to him. He shakes his head as he pockets his phone. What on earth is Gram up to?
Cas tastes Dean’s slick as it slides wetly from his hole. The Alpha licking and sucking to capture every drop. Castiel makes noises of appreciation, loud and breathy moans that spur Dean’s own moans and pleasure.
“I guess I just wonder what it’s going to be like to grow older, like do we suddenly feel like adults, do we suddenly stop wanting cheeseburgers and crave salad? Is that a thing? Does that happen?”
Mary invites them over before they all go to the annual winter carnival hosted by their small town. Dean digs through his cedar chest, pulling out clothing for Cas that hasn’t been in the rotation of their usual shared wardrobe of flannels and jeans. They’ve spent so much time just the two of them… Dean’s a little nervous for Sam and Mary to meet Castiel. For the past few weeks, Castiel has been coming to work with Dean each day. The dragon has kept himself occupied with organizing and running Dean’s business life and he’s proven himself to be an invaluable asset. Castiel has the shop running very smoothly, better at time logs, taxes, and overall HR crap than all the men in the shop combined. Dean thinks it is his meticulous attention to detail, Cas makes it his business to know where every washer, car part, and invoice is at any one time.
Eating quickly, putting the book aside, the family clears up and gathers themselves to walk down to the center of their township. Dean shoves down the growing unease in his chest and decides to just enjoy Castiel and their time together. He enjoys showing off his town. Their city is small, a small community named Keeper’s Hollow, on the outskirts of Lawrence. They’ve got their own downtown, a few shops, and a beautiful square with a gazebo where most of the citizens congregate. Every season is celebrated, but winter is especially so. The town holds a winter carnival with food, contests, and ice skating on the local pond. Dean has always loved the winter carnival and he’s excited to be sharing it with Castiel.
“I thought I would be too heavy, beloved.” Cas returns, his voice husky and low. Completely wrecked.
“Their mother died in childbirth and I have been bereft of adult company and conversation since her passing,” Castiel comments quietly taking a sip of the maroon liquid.
Dean turns in Castiel’s arms, the warmth from the open fire now radiating against his back, and the heat from the dragon warming his chest and legs. Dean is careful to keep his hips canted away, as his dick is obviously totally on board with the whole situation of being naked with another person and has begun to plump up, a warm weight between his legs, and becoming more sensitive with every move.
Castiel senses what Dean is thinking and knocks him gently with one front leg, sending Dean tumbling and chuckling into the grass.
Dean feels bad now, he’s just hurt the feelings of a pint-sized dragon that has done nothing except keep him company through the morning. He puts down the coins, picks up the coffee cup, and peers in. Folgers has curled up again with a paw strategically placed over his snout and his eyes closed. Dean huffs a silent laugh, the dragon is being very dramatic.
Naomi stares, her blue eyes are ice cold and her face is like stone. A telepathic conversation seems to be passing between the two dragons, microexpressions only give away their heightened emotions. Dean can tell Castiel is livid, his fists are clenched at his sides.
“Yes, we do. We have Pa,” Jack answers, his eyes flicking towards Dean. Dean can see that Jack is getting really upset and Cas is wringing his napkin, he can see that his mate is unsure how to handle the situation, the cogs in his brain turning too slowly. Today has been a shitstorm and it's wearing them both down. They’ll probably be too tired for sexy shenanigans later.
“Hello, Dean.” The guy had such a deep voice, it had sent a shiver down Dean’s spine. “I’m Castiel, and if you’ll allow me - I could cause you all sorts of trouble… If that’s what you’re looking for?”
“Change of plan. I’ll get my Dad to mail my stuff to me and I can get a job at a shop here. But we gotta find an apartment off-campus. You’ll probably have to commute, so we need to get you a car,” Dean states, words rushed.
“I couldn’t do it,” Cas responds quickly, “Different sort of intelligence. Where do you work? Are you local?”
“Omega,” his Alpha warns to slow down, making Dean squirm and keen. Backing up, Castiel makes room to remove his clothing. Now naked, Dean resumes his impatient and desperate petting. Castiel can’t get any purchase with his needy Omega tonight.
When the tiny tent is up, strictly for Castiel’s comfort, Dean ducks in and sets everything up, even pulling out thicker clothes for Castiel to put on quickly. Dean grabs some branches and materials for Castiel to set fire to. With an air of graceful ease, the dragon breathes fire and the logs take alight. It gives Dean instant goosebumps. Castiel is so majestic and beautiful and
Castiel hums in agreement, while Dean skates a little away from Castiel. The tips of their fingers barely touch. Only over an arm’s length away from the young dragon, towards the middle where there is less traffic. He smiles beautifully at his young friend, all bundled up on the ice. He moves to pull out his phone, to capture a picture to later show Castiel. “Smile!” he jokes but Castiel’s face remains uneasy watching Dean.
“How about you put that mouth somewhere better?” Castiel taunts, pulling the back of Dean’s hair with a raised eyebrow.
“So...” Dean had drawled, leaning in and nervously playing with his beer bottle. Normally, he was so sure of himself. Dean prided himself as confident in his role, and in himself as a person. He knows he’s attractive, and he knows people like him, but in the heat of the moment, Dean couldn’t quite get a read on Castiel. He rubs the back of his neck self-consciously.
“Dean, you are incredible. I never thought I would be entrusted with the care of a guardian, and yet here you are. So strong, so loyal, so caring.”
A fun St. Patrick’s Day night at the bar with his new friend Charlie and Jo (she was the one visiting) turned into watching them both make out, drinking way too much too quickly, and then calling a ride to go home early. Cas was supposed to be away for the week for some conference, but when Dean got home… he had found Cas home early and passed out in their bed. Hogging the space and the covers. Even seeing Cas home early didn’t cool Dean’s ire, because usually even if Cas is home, he’s usually not home.
He laughs and talks with Jack, sharing stories of Sam and his home. Dean loses track of the time. They eat a lunch of berries and freshly caught fish that Dean cooks over an open fire. Even Claire warms up to him and comments on his talents of cooking. It’s late into the afternoon that the three make their way back up to the manor house. He’s so grateful that someone, even a child, is speaking at length to him that he doesn’t register the panicked commotion until the three are standing in the middle of the atrium.
Dean cannot help the excitement that builds as they enter the bedroom as partners. The two men stop before the bed, their hands still clasped.
“Anyone else care to insult me or my Alpha?” He calls out, but mostly he locks eyes on Castiel who is grinning at him in sheer delight.
“Cas?” Dean tries to turn over but the dragon is having none of it, clasping Dean more closely to his chest and tucking Dean’s head beneath his chin.
Cas’ hands find their iron grip on Dean’s hips. Fucking him hard, Cas sets the pace, his hips sure and Dean meeting them eagerly. It’s not long until the hot white heat and curl of his own release grows in Dean’s belly.
“I’m alright. Jack puked down the front of me, which in turn triggered me. God, I hate throwing up,” Dean sighs and eats some of the casserole prepared.
With sure movements, Dean guides Castiel between his legs. Delving into his core, opening him sweetly until he can't take anymore. Castiel’s fingers coated in oil and some of Dean’s own emissions leaking from his cock. Soft pleas fall from Dean’s lips to Castiel’s, to sink into him and to hit that sweet spot so Dean can see the stars in heaven.
“Hey Cas,” he calls and steps naked out into the living room, “Not trying to be sexual or anything… but uh, can I have your opinion?”
“I’m your idiot though, and this idiot might just cook you a big steak and give you another blowie later,” Dean teases and reaches around to pat Cas’ butt playfully. His mate just hums in response, nipping at the old scar. Cas hates steak, and Dean knows this, so he’ll probably just end up making burgers and whatever frou-frou salad his mate has stashed in their crisper.
“You wear this pendant every day, at all times.” Cas is taking it out of the box and unravelling the chain while he speaks.
“I will be able to find you wherever you go,” Castiel states softly as if he’s reading Dean’s mind, “The mark on your arm binds you.”
Pulling down a spare ceramic pot and some potting soil, Dean fills it and takes the primrose weed away from Castiel. Packing the weed tightly in the middle, he hands the little pot back to his dragon. Castiel still seems upset, not looking at Dean’s face, but accepts the little plant gingerly with a quiet thank you. “You can put it on the porch,” Dean states, feeling a little more than foolish about disagreeing about the weed. They stand in the garage, grease and motor oil a sharp contrast to the smell of new earth outside.
“Yeah, man, I’m sure,” Dean states, though he clears his throat and nods. They’ve been at this for hours and honestly… Dean’s feet are starting to ache, not to mention his heart at the prospect of thinking he won’t find his Alpha for the last few hours.
“We should probably do that too,” Dean laughs and hugs him back, burying his face into that perfect cedar and earth scent. Smiling and holding on to Cas, Dean can’t believe his luck… it truly has been the best Unattached Drifter’s Christmas ever.
Bobby is looking anywhere but at Dean and Castiel. The windows to the glassed in office area are suddenly fascinating and he chews on the side of his moustache.
“Yes, so you may leave,” Castiel growls, hackles visibly rising. Naomi’s face doesn’t give anything away, but her body shifts back eyes darting between the two men. Dean inches closer to Castiel, hand curling around his waist.
Last night had started well, Dean loved karaoke night, and enjoyed the company of his two best friends. They all had taken turns belting out their favourite tunes, and soon had a good crowd laughing. Everyone had enjoyed the atmosphere around them.
Gram clears her throat and castiel is suddenly aware he is standing with his mouth open, in the middle of his Gram’s Kitchen, virtually eye-fucking a stranger. He gives himself a mental shake and coughs awkwardly.
“That’s a difficult job,” Cas states softly, leading Dean to sit down, but staying close. Castiel kicks off his boots and so Dean toes his off too.
Folgers blinks lazily at him as Dean pears down through his eyelashes, “Sleep buddy, I’ll watch over you.”
Cas’ schedule is grueling, he’s gone twelve hours a day and then comes home to do more school work ‘till late in the night. He’s a teaching assistant, so he’s grading papers, making lesson plans for the undergrad labs, and then writing his own essays. Dean understands. He gets it, ok? School is hard and Cas is getting his Ph.D. and creating a career to base their future on. It wouldn’t be so bad if Dean didn’t spend his days at an auto body shop he hates. Where his coworkers make sexists remarks about him being an Omega.
Folgers falls from the cranberry sauce jar, his face smeared in the sticky fruit. He looks so affronted, tilting his head in confusion at Dean’s brays of laughter, while his tail whips back and forth with the effort of trying to lick off the remaining preserve. Dean wipes at his eyes and holds out his hands for his little friend, grabbing his kitchen towel and dampening it, he wipes the dragon’s face tenderly. “It’s been a long time since I laughed that hard,” Dean comments wiping the cranberry off Folger’s chest, “More than a long time… years.”
Things evolve into an easy friendship between Castiel and Dean. In large part due to Jack and Claire. Over the spring and the summer months, the two men spend their days teaching and playing with Castiel’s children. The air is thick and sweet, most of their time is spent in the fields and the river. Splashing, chasing, and talking. Dean learns about magic and to his surprise, not everything is as evil as his Father preached. Castiel is keen on sharing everything with him. He watches in awe as Castiel moves boulders, grows flowers, and ripens tomatoes.
Dean Winchester, Pastor of the Parish of St Mary’s was enjoying the warmth of the spring breeze as it blew a scattering of blossom into the narthex. He grabbed a broom, and began the first of many duties for the day, sweeping out the leaves and blossoms that had blown under the door during the night.
“They’re about to close the bar and start closing up. I wonder, I mean, I dunno, but I think we’ve had a pretty good night… ummm...'' Dean petered off feeling stupid. In the dim pendant lights of the bar, Castiel had watched Dean embarrass himself with a knowing grin and one eyebrow cocked in question.
Dean blanches, a companion. Thoughts swirl in his head, but anger and betrayal are chief among them. He is to be used after all.
“Cas… Don’t be an ass,” Dean snarks. The fucker is enjoying being a tease when he knows how badly they both want this. Cas tuts and adjusts his position to sink into Dean, running the flesh of his head so close to Dean’s entrance but not quite. He kisses are slow and thorough, fucking Dean’s mouth with his tongue. Dean is lost to it all and he barely hears the knocking on their bedroom door, but it stops Cas in his tracks.
Grumbling Dean steps in the tub and flaps out his arms, “Where?” He bites out and Cas gestures to his lap. So, he sits in Castiel’s lap and they shuffle to the middle of the tub. Knees knocking against the sides and Dean pointedly not looking into his mates’ face.
“It’s time for work, love,” Castiel sighs, carding his other hand through Dean’s wet hair, “Let’s take a shower and head in.”
Silently, Castiel takes the soft soap mixed with herbs in his hands. He lathers and with quick precision he washes Dean’s body. Every inch is given attention. Dean feels the Prince’s calloused fingers run through his hair and rub his scalp, they move gently over his face, his chest and backside, and then between his legs gliding soapily over his cock and balls, and then down his body to his legs and toes. Shocked to have a man wash between his legs, Dean is malleable for the silent Prince. His body obediently bending wherever the Prince moves him, like the softest branch in the breeze. Dean stands there, the soap mixing with the blood of the battlefield, and watches as the Castiel washes his own body. Dean stands there entranced as those large hands run over his pectorals and down his flat abdominals to cup his genitalia softly, just as he did Dean’s.
In a place of worship, the Pastor might be expected to be humming some Handel or Gibbons, something reverent in the warm glow of the stained glass windows, but no… Dean is humming Meatloaf’s “Bat out of Hell” and he is evidently enjoying it. His hips swinging under the black trousers and shirt, white collar starkly evident against the black.
Rolling her eyes, Alex prances back into the kitchen. Dean turns to his mate and gives him a small smile, “Raincheck?”
Dean grunts, watching Castiel pull on more and more layers. Watching Castiel dress is his least favorite activity, he prefers the unlayering of Castiel much better. They break down the tent together, and Castiel stokes the fire watching Dean with hungry eyes.
Dean’s face floods with colour as he realizes how inappropriately turned on he is by the thought of Cas’ strength being able to manhandle his 200-pound ass so easily. He shifts under the blankets, but his body is so sensitive, nerves coming alive from the cold. Every movement sends sparks zinging across his skin. He tries to remember that the dragon appears years younger than he is, even though technically he’s older. Dean tells his workworn body that Cas doesn’t want him like that, that Cas is youthful and beautiful and could have anyone he liked. Dean ducks his head and tries to shift away from the expanse of warm and smoothly muscled skin wrapped around him.
“I’ve never been in a vehicle,” Cas slowly whispers, looking around and glaring at the offending engine through the dash, “Before yesterday… I had not even seen cars, the last time I visited this plane I was just a child. Cars… cars weren’t what they are today. And when I reached my majority, I was not allowed to leave our home.”
It’s pink, the toilet is pink, the sink is pink. Dean hates it on a normal day, and even more so now that Cas wants to take a bath. The house was cheap and all they could afford. It’s in a terrible neighborhood and Dean prays every night that Baby isn’t damaged while he sleeps. He hates it. He hates the neighborhood. He hates the house. Dean hates Florida, it’s a wet armpit of a place where it is seventy-seven in March, and the population density of the elderly is insane.
Castiel stops at the pond where a bunch of children are skating. He watches them, a beautiful smile spreading across his face. Dean isn’t watching the kids, he is too focused on the joy that spreads across Castiel’s face. It’s magnetic and so pure. Dean hasn’t ice skated in years, not since he was a child himself, and he immediately wants to share this experience with Castiel.
Dean’s heart heals. He still misses Sam and his mother, and he talks at length about them to Castiel. Seasons change, but he still aches for his family. He doesn’t miss his own life, encumbered by his titles, responsibilities, and schemes of his father. He wonders how Sam is faring. If Sam has food, if he has shelter if he’s taking care of their mother.
“Yeah!” Claire cheers and Castiel can’t help but smile, “I want you to go get your crayons and paper. While I’m cooking, you're going to make Daddy a card. But first, I’m going to check on Jack and Daddy, ok?”
“You have fifteen minutes of wiggle room,” Dean states out loud looking at the same clock. It’s like he has ESP.
They are seated at the table, Jack and Claire to his right and left. Ben, Alex, Kaia, and Krissy squished in on the bench seats. Ben and Kaia are closer to Castiel, with Alex and Krissy in the middle.
Dean had never moved so fast in his life and wondered if he had been teleported when he found himself flat on his back on his bed with this wondrous man hovering above him.
Castiel does exactly that, he makes dinner and feeds the two of them, helps Claire with a birthday card, cleans the entire house, does the laundry, and eventually gets Claire into the shower and into new PJs. They call Jimmy, which makes his twin shine with happiness. He’s having a good day, the medication he’s currently on is working and Claire is over the moon telling her Momma all about Jack’s illness and Dean’s strife. When Claire skips off, Jimmy and Cas chat, and Cas clears up that everybody is ok… he doesn’t want Jimmy to worry, the lines of concern already etching into this twin’s face.
The older man is hiding a smirk beneath his greying beard. “You think I was born yesterday, son? Or do you think because I’m old I’m stupid? I know a dragon when I see one, and your Mom would too. What’s goin’ on, Dean?” Bobby’s tone grows more gentle, and he sits himself astride one of the old chairs scattered around.
As he steps into the kitchen he can see his Gram, and a stranger sitting cosily at the kitchen table, steaming cups of coffee at their elbows.
The next morning, Dean gets dressed slowly. His body is slightly sore from the entire night of sex they had. His neck is bruised deeply, Cas had bitten and sucked on his mating gland until the flesh was rendered a Jackson Pollock of reds and purples. Cas looks about the same, hickies littering his body and deep circles around his eyes from the lack of sleep and sadness in the current moment. They talked in the midst of their sexual haze, deciding that Dean needs to go home and collect his belongings and talk things over with his Dad before coming back to California. Dean’s Alpha stares sadly at his dressed form. Hands clasped in front of him, only wearing those flimsy white boxers, his face completely despondent.
“I am enjoying it greatly, I’m very thankful for finding asylum with Dean,,” Castiel answers earnestly, pulling the beanie from his head.
Dean wakes slowly, pure contentment thrumming through him. Castiel, the human and not the dragon, is nestled against him. A long toned leg still slotted between his, a hard cock pressed against his ass, an arm thrown over his chest. Dean can’t imagine a better way to wake up. Dean waits for Castiel to wake, his dragon nuzzling against him and letting out a huge sigh. They wish each other goodmorning, sleepy morning breath kisses exchanged.
“No love, this is just for you,” Castiel responds. His mate pouts only a little, but Castiel remains steadfast and watches as Dean slowly sips his drink. When he’s finished, Castiel gathers the shampoo and soap to lather into Dean’s hair and skin. With tenderness, he massages Dean’s scalp and his sure and strong mate melts visibly under his hands. If he were capable, Castiel would expect Dean to purr under his ministrations.
When the table is cleared and wine is placed before the fire, Dean follows Castiel and sits in the chair opposite his. Uneasy and awkward in the powerful man’s presence.
“I’m alright, Dean, we’re gonna leave,” Sam shakes his head and grabs Gabe’s upper arm, “Let you two get to know one another.”
He turns to look at his co-driver, co-conspirator, and oldest friend. He marvels that even with the race behind them and the heat and stress of the day he still looks so goddamn edible.
“Mom?” Dean asks once everyone settles. “Mom, how come you never told me about any of this, the guardian thing, the plaque you gave me last year, just…” Dean loses his words and instead gestures wildly at Cas, and then just generally around the warm room. “Y'know, all of it?”
“Good flyin’, ace,” Dean calls. Dean is quick to work, Castiel’s enormous eyes watching his every move. Occasionally nuzzling him with his great big snout, only pushing Dean into the snow once. Dean throws a handful of snow in the middle of his nose, making Castiel snort with dragon amusement.
His Alpha lets out the happiest little moan. A hand cupping his face, Dean holds his Alpha close, pressing a deeper kiss. Rolling, teasing, nibbling his lips between his, Dean coaxes Cas into a slow tangle of tongues and lips. Leaving them both panting for air, their breath and their scents intermingling.
“I like that,” Dean cheekily responds, crawling up and sitting in Cas’ lap. He drags his ass across Cas’ prominent erection. He watches as Cas’ eyes roll up into his head and strong hands anchor on Dean’s hips.
“A dragon guardian, the symbol,” the man says, his deep voice quieting. Folger’s eyes, this man’s eyes filling with sadness.
“Will you stay for the rest of our days?” Castiel asks, crawling up Dean’s body, planting a soft kiss over Dean’s heart.
quick right now,” Dean comments, hand wandering into the front of Castiel’s dress pants. Castiel finds himself reacting immediately, he always responds so quickly to Dean. He is putty in his Omega’s hands. They’ve been mated for eight years and he can safely say that he will do anything to make his mate happy.
When they get to work, it’s Bobby on the phone with Mrs. Butters, her loud brash voice ringing through the speaker, “But, Cas will understand what’s wrong with the car, last time he just listened to the noise the engine was making and he
Bobby gestures at the lunch table with its red vinyl chairs, and Dean and Cas each pull one and sit. Dean puts a comforting hand on Castiel’s back, fingers splayed and idly making patterns with his fingers. Dean can tell from Bobby’s face that this is something seriously wrong.
Dean retrieves the wipes and with trembling hands, he opens the packet, and pulls out a wipe. “Are those your masturbating wipes, Gabe?” his Alpha groans and snatches them out of Dean’s hands to throw them back at his roommate. Dean hastily wipes his scent gland, feeling a tad humiliated by the entire situation.
Biting on his lip, Castiel softly explains, “To be recognized as mates in court, we have to go through a ceremony. It starts with a flight to see the Northern Lights. You seemed so hesitant to fly, I did not want to pressure you into going.”
“Dean, beloved. You feel incredible. I cannot believe I’m inside you, that you are sharing yourself with me in this way.” The dragon drops kisses across Dean’s face as he starts to move his hips causing delicious friction deep within Dean.
“Oh fuck Dean, Omega,” Cas keens and he slams it into park in their garage. Cas hauls him up for a kiss while scrambling to open the door. The two men practically fall out, trading messy desperate kisses, but Cas is quick to shove Dean against the car door. Jerking Dean’s pants open, Cas’ cards a hand down the back of his pants to spread Dean’s cheeks.
“Yes, Alpha,” Dean practically purrs when Cas’ fingers card into the back of his hair. The smell of Dean’s sweet arousal in the air.
“I’m sure it was an interesting day,” Castiel responds weakly, hoping his mate just vomited because of Jack puking.
“Clothes, Alpha,” Dean requests, pulling on his pant leg. Cas nods, quickly pulling off his hoodie and cargo pants. The white boxers landing on top of the pile. Laying down next to Cas on his side, Dean snuggles up to the Alpha. Adjusting their erections so they are right next to each other, garnering a hiss of pleasure that escapes Cas’ lips. Wrapping a hand around the two of them, Dean jacks them slowly, loving the feel of Cas’ heavy dick in his hands. Their foreheads rest together, both Alpha and Omega looking down and watching the slow drag of their members in Dean’s hand. Cas holding tight to Dean’s biceps.
“Top Shelf, huh” Dean mutters to himself. “The top shelf spirits are on the top shelf…” he laughs at his realisation. “Well who’d’ve thought…”
Having found the angle, Cas strikes the same spot over and over, denying himself his pleasure until his mate has had his fill. He can feel his knot swelling and uses it to thrust against Dean’s hole providing even more stimulation.
Dean can't help but to feel a sense of foreboding sink into his gut, turning on the radio to blast The Doors as a distraction. Dean sings along, a few songs later and the short drive has ended. He’s pulling in front of his shop. Killing the engine, he hops out. Pulling the jacket tight to his body, he darts in, Cas ever his shadow practically on his heels. Avoiding Bobby’s curious looks, he sets Castiel up in the office. Showing him how to answer the phones and he dives into work… praying to all the deities to make the day go fast.
Yawning and still half asleep, Dean makes his way to the kitchen. He’s done this dance a million times before and knows he only needs to be partially awake to make coffee. He fills the glass pot from his tap, blurrily rubbing the sleep from his eyes. As he fills the reservoir, he can hear the telltale sound of water splashing all over his counter behind the cheap eight dollar rickety coffee pot. Sighing, he throws the tea towel proclaiming “
“You have to be quiet, Omega,” Cas whispers, reminding Dean, nipping his buttocks and running a warm hand along the length of Dean’s spine Dean is achingly hard and wet and his whole body is begging for release. Holding back and staying silent, restraining himself makes his arousal all that sweeter even as he aches for release.
Groaning in dismay, Dean agrees and the two get ready for work. He doesn’t want to get go, but he readily admits work is so much more enjoyable now that Dean has Cas with him. The dragon makes everything more agreeable. He has picked up the customer service side of things with ease, and people now call and ask for Cas, rather than he or Bobby.
Humming, Dean pops off loudly around Castiel’s cock, “Relax, this is going to feel so good, if you want it.”
“Dean, C’mon… get out of the suit, here let me help you,” and with that Castiel pulls the zipper down from neck to ass and peels his lover from the damp leather.
“But why, Dean? Why would you pull out that particular plant, and replace it with this one? It is smaller, but exactly the same colour of green. I don’t understand.”
“Not really,” Dean laughs, watching his Alpha curl his legs underneath him. He’s still got the body of a gangly teenager.
He remembered keeping hold of Castiel’s hand as they sat. Not wanting to lose the connection between them.
Dean lets out borderline pornographic noises when Cas digs the heel of his palm into a particular knot in his lower back.
“Dean, we could never be boring, not even in a month of Sundays. You and I together? We are more likely to have sparks fly at regular intervals than ever get boring, my Omega.”
With an eager smile, Cas practically bolts out of the Impala and to the backyard. Shedding his clothing, his preferred method to fly, as he goes. Dean laughs, following. Distracted from picking up Castiel’s clothes, he runs headlong into the dragon’s back.
They aren’t quite kissing anymore, breathing closely together lips parted. Wanting and asking for something more is on the tip of Dean’s tongue, but he doesn’t quite know how to ask Castiel.
“I’ve been wanting to see that spring in Ocala,” Dean says quietly, almost embarrassed to ask for something for himself.
“Dean,” Castiel groans against his lip, panting. Opening his eyes, Castiel’s visage of lust blown blue eyes and spit shiny lips fills Dean with white-hot heat. He holds Castiel’s hips steady, thumbs brushing his lower abdomen.
Once again Dean feels the heat of Cas’ body a warm weight down the length of his own. Cas runs warm, so warm which in a fleeting thought he guesses is natural for a dragon. Gliding his hands down the planes of Castiel’s back, over his cheeks, pulling Castiel by the waist to be closer to him. The gorgeous man undulates his hips, their mutual arousal trapped between their bodies, and it makes Dean see stars behind his lids.
Dumbfounded, Dean stares at the younger man as he stretches and lets out pleased noises in the morning light. Dean’s ring on the man’s ring finger glinting. “You’re my dragon?” Dean lets out dumbly, staring at the broad shoulders and golden skin of the gorgeous man next to him.
“Well, let’s just hope fate is on your side and they actually live in Roble,” Sam sighs and when Dean whines his baby brother changes his tune to be less catastrophic, “There are 11 halls in Roble, we’ll just systematically go down each hall and knock on all the doors.”
“Cas, I don’t want you to go. I will never ask you to go. I want you to stay with me for as long as you want to,” Dean answers, meeting Castiel’s eyes in a quiet moment, “I love you. I’m askin’ you to stay. We’ll go, get bonded. I want this with you.”
Sour mood displaced by Dean’s silly comment. Castiel laughs, nose scrunched up and eyes shining, “Something like that, though there is more politics involved at court in consideration of who can bear fledgelings. It's a very controlled, regimented life. It’s a cold childhood, not like here. Humans are so warm, you have shown me more kindness and emotion in these short months than I have experienced in all my years amongst my kind.”
“But Pa! Jack took the other car and now I don’t have a way to get to Audrey’s house,” Claire whines by the front door.
The hug is long, both men sink into the embrace and the reassurances, taking comfort in the lines of each other’s bodies. Dean commits everything to memory, the feel of his lover’s skin, the smell of the leather seats along with Cas’s own personal comforting scent tickling his nostrils, and even the warming cab in the sun. Eventually, Dean pulls away, clapping Cas on the back of the neck and bringing the other man in for a soft kiss. Soft chapped lips are pliant against his. Kisses turn into soft nuzzling and eventually the intimacy fades.
“I’m glad you found Dean, Castiel. My ancestors were known guardians. We are so honored to have you in the family,” Mary looks concerned at Cas saying he was searching for asylum, but she covers it quickly with a smile, “You’ll let us know if you need anything.”
The coffee machine breaks his reverie, and he reaches for his favourite mug. It's a warm blue colour with a dancing characterized pie printed on the outside. Sammy gave it to him as a joke one year, for a whilte elephant gift, but Dean likes it. He likes the bright blue against the stark white of his other coffee mugs. It feels right in his hand and holds just enough coffee to wake him up, but not enough that it goes cold before he’s finished. These days - it’s the small things.
Prince Castiel makes a small but intricate gesture, the Earth breaks open and roots rise from the depths. They wrap around Dean, biting into his skin, as they drag him towards Michael. He remains in the muck, staring up at the faces of his father and brother.
Dean considers the Prince’s answer. Castiel watches as disbelief and distrust war equally on Dean’s handsome face. If he’s learned one thing, the magic stirring underneath The Prince of Andover’s skin does not lie. He wants Dean. The magic calls so loud that Dean can hear its siren’s song.
“You are sad,” Cas whispers, his thumb rubbing and pulling Dean’s abused lip from his teeth. It’s the power of his Cas, his steady gaze that undresses all of Dean’s prickly layers and gets to the root of the issue in one statement. Dean’s scent, souring throughout their conversation, turns disgustingly mauldin. In turn, Castiel’s scent sours and they huddle close together.
Castiel looks at him, eyes searching and soft, he nods and the two spend the rest of their night in quiet companionship.
“It may seem archaic, but it truly is an honor to be chosen, to be a guardian. I’m so happy that you are able to be that for Castiel,” Mary is quiet as she regards Castiel and Dean across the table.
“So good, sweetheart,” Dean praises, locking his feet together in the dip of Castiel’s back, “So good. You feel so good.” Castiel’s thrusts become sharp and desperate after each little praise. Cas is biting his lip so hard that the pretty pink lip is white underneath his teeth, Dean reaches up with his thumb to pull it from his dragon. Sticking in his thumb inside of that pretty mouth instead. Castiel’s tongue swirls around his thumb, mirth dancing in those blue eyes.
“Dinner is staying warm in the oven,” Castiel says softly, getting up and following Dean into the kitchen.
Across the way the wall on the other side has been graffitied - Dean idly wonders when that happened, must be recent, he doesn’t remember noticing the stark white paint against the crumbling red brick.
Castiel follows, climbing onto the bed and straddling Dean’s thighs, he seats himself in Dean’s lap and loops his arms around Dean’s neck looking him in the eye.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean returns fondly. “I get it, you dork. Go swim!!” and with that Dean gives him a friendly shove and turns to dive in the deep end.
“I have been found, despite my efforts to stay hidden. My brother Gabriel has reached out to warn me. It turns out that my rescue on the ice alerted them. They’ve been watching and waiting, despite the fact I silenced my mental link. It is only a matter of time and my kin have been adamant in their wish for me to return home,” Castiel comments softly, fiddling with the leaves of the plant with his long fingers.
But Dean is still so angry, him distant? Cas is the one who is always gone, even when he’s here. And so he says so, “I’m not the one who is always gone, always at school, at a conference. In the lab, off going to lunch with my friends.”
Castiel transforms back to a young man and drops comfortably into the grass next to Dean. He tilts his head inquisitively, blue eyes filled with mirth and smile spreading those chapped pink lips.
“Yes.” Cas’ eyes are so very blue and reflect the light from the dancing flames of the fire, Dean is mesmerized and cannot look away.
“Jack, it’s okay, buddy,” Dean says capping him on the shoulder, Jack looks mollified but his eyebrows are pinched down.
Dean continues his onslaught, Cas trembling and gasping his name. The relentless pressure on the gland causes Castiel to twitch and moan, staring down at Dean in wonder. The neighbor bangs on the wall and Dean presses hard on Cas’ prostate, making his Alpha shout in absolute pleasure. Dean can tell he’s close to coming when Cas pulls him off. Dean grunts in protest but Cas is grasping at his biceps and pulling him up for a kiss.
Cas thinks for a minute. Dean adores his mate’s “thinking face.” Castiel tends to tilt his head and scrunch his eyebrows as if Dean has asked him to solve a quadratic equation in his head.
Dean nods reassuringly at Sam’s statement knowing he won’t be going home. He takes comfort that Bobby is there to help with John.
“Oh fuck,” Dean softly gasps out, making Cas stop and look at him with his head cocked and eyes squinted, “You enjoy this?”
Cas gazes around his Grandma’s apartment, taking in the chintzy curtains and cat figurines. The apartment smells of fresh baking.
“You are older than me,” Castiel answers simply, providing the obvious answer. He stands chest to chest with Dean, taking off his own clothes in the process and throwing them on the couch. Dean is definitely hairier than his thin and gangly teenage mate. Castiel’s still growing, still filling out. Dean’s been feeding him all home cooked meals and Dean swears he’s grown a few inches already.
Dean looks up at the little Omega loitering by his bedroom door, he knows that his own scent is heavy with Omega distress and unhappiness and that it’s probably affecting the other kids. Ben especially, as the only other Omega in the house he’s very attuned to Dean’s moods.
“Yeah?” Castiel questions when they move on to the kitchen, Castiel throwing away all the food that was left out.
“Shirt for today,” Dean says, pushing a warm henley at Castiel’s chest, “Lesson one, personal space. You can’t stand that close to me.”
He takes a breath, and looks the handsome firefighter in the eye. “I’d like that, very much. Thank you.”
“You want those?” Dean asks watching the small dragon with his paws spread possessively over the small hoard. Folgers looks at him with disbelief in those big blue eyes and nods slowly.
The way they come together is very different to the night before the fire. That was languid, measured, every touch felt at once dreamlike and almost too real. This time there are the cool planes of the Impala at Dean’s back even as Cas is warm and pliant within his arms. Cas kisses him like he can’t get enough, like he needs this more than anything and is desperate to take as well as to give.
Castiel meets Dean’s eyes, blue meets green across the sparkling waters of the swimming pool, Dean’s hefty horsemeat hard-on the only thing ‘coming’ between them.
Firefighter Dean Winchester finishes his presentation to the elders of Shady Acres Retirement Community with a wink and a bow. His audience is made up of mostly older women, and they have all obviously made an effort to dress for the occasion, as Dean is looking out over a sea of beautifully coiffed frothy while hair, lustrous pearls and a rainbow of coloured scarves.
“Bobby has been awesome, Y’know? He used to let me work on classic cars and said I had a knack for it. Dunno know about that, buddy; but the first Lincoln Continental I worked on I will never forget.”
Gabriel dives into his snack stash and pulls out a bag of popcorn to throw into their microwave, glee lining his face.
“Not planning on it,” Castiel grunts, “I think we should hold off flying for a while. The saddle is ruined.”
As they hold each other warm hands begin to wander further afield. No longer just giving comfort, but seeking further, gliding over soft, warm skin and feeling the firm muscles beneath. The two mates sink further into the covers, finding a warm and safe place where their breath mingles between them.
“Do you think she is getting confused, Pamela?” Cas asks with trepidation. He has always worried that his bright and beautifully independent Gram would start to show signs of confusion and memory loss. So far she had remained as bright as a button despite being in her mid eighties.
“What are you doing?” Castiel mumbles, his cold hands searching the hem of Dean’s shirt and slipping underneath his Henley. His muscles tighten against the chill of Cas’ big hands, letting out a hiss of discomfort but he swallows the exclamation. Poor Cas is always saying he is cold despite that fact he feels very warm.
“Bobby, did Mom ever mention to you anything about her mythical creatures theory? About them being real?” He ducks his head, feeling the blush grow on his cheeks, “I mean, you’ve known Mom forever, Dad too, back in the day and I just wondered...” He tapers off, embarrassed. “Never mind, It’s nothing. Doesn’t matter.”
Frowning, Dean’s hands flex into the soft material, he won’t go on a wild goose chase across campus… he’ll just wait till his Alpha gets back to his dorm. That would be the smartest thing to do.
At this point, Dean remembered wondering if he had accidentally eaten a magic mushroom, or been roofied because what on earth was happening here?
Cassie’s face colors brilliantly. The tips of his ears blindingly red. “I can’t smell you to discern your scent,” his Alpha shrugs apologetically, “Are you wearing blockers?”
The stranger cracks open his eyes, Dean staring down into the intense blue that is so familiar. The man hums, a deep rumbling noise, while he flips on his back and cards his fingers through his hair ruffling it up even more. Licking his lips, the man rumbles out, “You Christened me Folgers yesterday, which I must say is only a slight improvement on what my parents named me.”
“It’ll happen when it happens Gram. I’m ok. I promise.” and he presses a kiss into her silvery hair.
“You will serve as my companion,” Castiel answers simply, “The days will be yours to do as you wish, I will only ask a few hours of your time around dinner to keep me company.”
Castiel wraps his arms around Dean, pulling him into a hug and resting his head on Dean’s neck. His hands trail down Dean’s back to the little gathering of hair at the base of his spine. He toys with it, then pats his small bottom.
An idea stirs in Cas’ mind of date night, but he quiets it, focusing on his Omega. “Go to bed, Dean,” he says with some authority, “Sleep until the kids wake up.”
. Castiel fingers press against his hole eliciting the familiar feeling of his orgasm crest as it rushes through him. He climaxes, his cry is swallowed by Castiel’s lips.
“No, I don’t want anything from Naomi.” Dean hates Cas’ mother, passionately. The Alpha is a controlling micromanaging toxic bitch and he doesn’t want to accept anything from her because it always comes with strings. “I can definitely work until I find another job, ok? I’ve made it eight months, I can last another few weeks until another garage picks me up.”
The dragon blinks back, eyes sleepy. He watches as the dragon flips over and snuggles back into the bottom of the cup. Dean leaves the mug in the sunlight and grabs another one from his open shelving. Pouring his coffee he muses out loud.
“Not enough,” Cas responds, his legs spreading wider and turning on the aftermarket cruise control Dean had (luckily) installed. Throwing his arm behind the two of them, Castiel raises a challenging eyebrow to his husband.
“Nothing has to change, my Prince,” Dean moans out when Castiel rolls his hips underneath his. It’s a slow grind, a mating of tongues and hands that travel. Dean slips Castiel out of his tunic and breeches, the Prince of Andover splayed out underneath him his skin flush with arousal. Dean’s hands trace the sinew of muscle from his shoulders down to the narrowing of Castiel’s hips. His fingertips tingle from the magic humming underneath Cas’ skin. It grabs at him, soothing his nerves and inflaming him more.
“Well, hello there tall and handsome.” Two Alphas, one blonde and one dark-haired check both Dean and Sam out. It’s the blonde one drawls, looking at Sam like a snack, “Name’s Luke.” He points to the other Alpha, “Michael.”
It’s later in the evening and Dean’s daydreaming as he waits for the last couple of folks to finish up. He can see the whole bar reflected in the glass shelves where the top shelf liquor sits.
“Feel good?” Dean asks, taking a break from his assault as he notices Cas’ thighs tremble with the effort to not come. Licking his lips and nodding slowly, Cas looks at Dean like he’s the pinnacle of divinity.
Dean turns down the Impala’s radio, fiddling with his hearing aids and eventually pulling them out and checking the app on his phone for their battery life. Turning to his husband, he scowls, “Damn things, I knew they were dying. I could barely hear Jim and Claire this morning.”
Castiel Novak will settle for a quick handjob pressed against the counter, but he definitely knows he’s going to worship every inch of his Omega later.
“You need to tell Meg to the back the fuck off,” Dean can’t help but growl, “Every time you come from home you reek like her and it’s really pissing me off.”
“My sweet Omega, so ready for me,” Cas murmurs, trailing a knuckle over his hole, spreading Dean’s legs farther apart. Spreading Dean’s cheeks, Cas continues with the light teasing touches. Dean is shaking, panting into their pillows. The Omega is now leaking slick freely, it trickles down his thighs. The aroma of highly aroused Omega permeates the room. Cas scents mate, family, home,
At work they keep a professional distance, Dean wanting all of his workers to see Cas as the office manager of sorts, but at home… his dragon is glued to him. Either as a man or an actual small dragon. It’s not uncommon for Castiel to shift into “Folgers” and to rest in the middle of Dean’s chest under his clothes while they watch TV. They share a bed, Castiel snuggled around Dean, his little scaled face usually tucked into the back of Dean’s neck. His rhythmic breath of deep sleep on the nape of Dean’s neck lulling him to sleep. Castiel, always blaming the cold, curls around Dean all the time.
“Thank you,” Castiel says and eats a cracker, they’re stale. “How about we help Dad out and pick up some things?”
“You are my guardian, my keeper,” Castiel starts hesitantly, “In the past, that would have meant that I would be obligated to protect your lands from invaders and you in turn would have provided a safe haven and a place within your home for me. It is between a guardian and their dragon to decide what kind of provisions are met, a hierarchy of needs of sorts. Many dragons would simply dine with their guardians, a sort of business transaction, others… others were more intimate with their keepers. Their bond was more profound. I had wanted that with you. I feel that is the true nature of our bond. Upon entering your home, I felt it settle over me and I felt like I had truly found what I have been looking for all my life. I thought… I was under the assumption that you also wanted that with me?”
“Sorry, sorry,” Dean apologizes, but secretly he’s pleased. He’s still got it, making his Alpha come so many times.
“I need you to fuck me, my Lord,” Dean states working his hand between them onto Castiel’s cock, “I want to ride you and for you to fill me up.”
“Someone will be in touch, Castiel,” she warns and in a bright light that’s blinding a dragon appears and launches into the sky.
Popping open their shower lube, Castiel reaches around and circles Dean’s erection slowly. Making his mouth drop open and head drop back to rest against Cas. “Feels good,” he groans and thrusts his hips into Castiel’s hand.
Folgers quickly leaves his “hoard'' in the mug when the bread and sandwich makings are taken from the cupboards and fridge, becoming increasingly curious with all the steps involved in the sandwich-making process.
Dean had never met someone so straightforward. He sounded so upfront, Dean had wondered if there was a catch. But it was a minor concern when stacked against the desire he felt for this enigma of a man.
“Good girl,” Castiel praises, starting the wash with all the vomit and Jack’s shit covered clothes. He turns the machine on heavy soil and hot, adding extra detergent. Claire watches a little smile on her sweet pixie face.
“Oh, nothing dear” as she tucks the pendant in her neckline. “Nothing at all. Come and have a cup of tea in the kitchen There might even be a leftover piece of apple cake for my favourite grandson if you are lucky!”
“You are so handsome,” his Alpha whispers, fingers tracing around the shell of Dean’s ear down his jaw.
“Patience, my guardian,” Castiel murmurs, kissing the inside of Dean’s knee and nipping his skin. Letting out a small keen, Dean digs his heels into the mattress as Castiel opens him up slowly. One finger at a time. Dean has one hand buried in Cas’s silky hair, the other is clenched in the covers as the dragon twists his long fingers deep into the heat of Dean. Grazing against his prostate as he twists, and tugging gently at the rim as he pulls out. Dean is a mess, writhing. It’s almost too good, too much and he is close to being overwhelmed.
“Nothing for you to worry about,” Dean replies, knocking on the door and then entering, “Ma! It’s me.”
When they finally stop, Dean is so grateful that he sinks to his knees. It’s been five days on foot and he’s sore. He had ridden with Castiel half a day, his back pressed up against Castiel’s front. Strong thighs caging his, Castiel’s arms curling around his waist, sweet breath tickling his neck, and Castiel’s magical aura buzzing underneath Dean’s skin. He was aroused the entire day, his cock dampening the inside of his breeches with copious precome. His heart raced and he flushed with further arousal when he felt Castiel’s arousal pressed up against his sensitive cheeks. It was the sweetest form of torture. Dean refused all offers of a ride after that day.
With the flat of his tongue, Castiel laps at Dean’s hole moaning at his mate’s taste. Dean’s earthy honey taste fills his senses and Castiel licks him from the root of his cock to his hole. Castiel loves that his Omega is a man, drawing one ball into his mouth at a time, rolling them around with his tongue softly.
“Even though technically neither of us are female, we still celebrate Mother’s Day in a small way. Just our way of acknowledging Dean’s hard work and dedication to this family,” Cas states, answering Alex and Kaia’s questioning looks.
Dean has tried to ask him where his clothes go when he shifts - but all Castiel can tell him is that they stay ‘within’ him. Which is no help. And it is not helping Dean to stay calm as he watches the play of muscles across the young dragon’s back as he walks across the lawn. The jeans dipping low on his hips, exposing those delicious hip bones and the treasure trail along his navel.
“We can do that too,” Dean chokes out, not unaffected by the sight of his Alpha moaning around his fingers from his taste. Cas practically attacks him with desperation, kissing him and devouring his lips, and then moving down his body with pure enthusiasm. Cas kisses and sucks Dean’s cock in his mouth, lips wrapping around him with sloppy determination but his Alpha is quick to move past his cock. Dean panting at the turn of events. Drawing Dean’s legs to his chest in a quick movement, so his hole is up in the air and exposed, Cas breathes deep.
The dragon leans into Dean’s touch, then dropps his head into his hands. He lets out a low groan and threads his fingers through his hair and then looks up, gaze glancing between Dean and Bobby. Fear and worry marring his face. Castiel speaks more so to Bobby, words slow and hesitant,  “Bobby, my family, my court...they want me to return for one thing. To bear offspring. There are long standing agreements and treaties that link my name to Bart.
“Now, Castiel, that is no way to talk to your betrothed. The future father of your children,” the man snarks back.
Castiel is waiting for an answer, his brain is fishing around for a reason that would cause his normally sane Grandmother to call the Fire department.
Cas steps toward Dean and takes his keeper in his arms. His voice rumbly and arms tight around Dean, “My love, you have been given no reason to trust me in that form. I understand.”
Dean is used to the early mornings, doesn’t mean he enjoys them. It’s Sunday and he’s got to get ready for the week, he goofed off yesterday and today is the day he gets all of his chores done. Dean would much rather still be curled beneath the covers, warm and cozy on this cold day. His Mom always said that Dean was her little Bear. he chuckles at the thought of being called a “little” anything these days. Broad of shoulder and just over six feet he vaguely remembers feeling small, and warm, and loved.
Bartholomew, the coward, roars and launches himself into the sky. With one last cheap shot, a slash against Castiel’s chest, he flies away. Dean switches on the safety, leaving the gun in the grass, and runs to the transformed Castiel.
“Cas, was there something you needed? Did you find the coffee?” He whispers but he sees his entire congregation scoot forward comically to hear their shepherd. Groaning internally, Dean bites his lip.
Groaning with exasperation, Castiel can’t hide the slight twisted sad smile twinging at his lips, “Yes, Dean. But I really do not want to. That’s why I escaped. I do not want to bear fledglings to be pawns in their game.”
“Check it out!” he calls to his companion, “Alpha can’t keep his Omega in line, lets himself be manhandled in public - I’d put that disrespectful Omega in his place, show him who’s boss. Damn uppity, independent Omegas, they don’t belong in public if they can’t behave…” The loud Alpha’s voice tapers off to a complaining mumble as he moves deeper into the diner.
His mate smiles coyly at him, perfectly straight teeth gleaming in the morning sunlight. Eyes full of mischievous joy and arousal. His perfect bow lips licked wet in anticipation. Dean loves toying with him, loves playing with the rules of Alpha and Omega, and frankly… Dean loves sex.
“Boy? Stop right there, it’s obviously not nothin’, not when you turn up to work with a young dragon in tow.”
Stopping for a moment and really looking at his cranky Omega, Castiel can’t help but stifle his laugh at the stark difference between the two of them. He’s dressed for the day, showered, and changed into business casual attire while Dean is…well, Dean is still wearing the ratty t-shirt and sweatpants from two days ago. His beautiful Omega who is usually so tall and broad-shouldered is stooped, his shoulders rounded with fatigue. Dean’s beautiful face is pale, and there are deep circles almost like bruises around his eyes, and his freckles stand out strikingly against the pallor. His hair is a mess, floppy and greasy and hanging limply over his head. To top off the look, he is sporting a scruffy beard, growing totally untamed.
Taking a deep breath he took the plunge. “Yes. I’d like that. We probably both could do with a coffee. I’m not far and we can walk if you’re up for it. I’d like to leave before the girls come and hassle  us if that’s ok?”
As they mount to the Winner’s Box, Dean marvels that this is one of the only times he can legitimately sling an arm around the broad shoulders of his co-driver without anyone in the crowd giving it a second thought. The midwest is not a good place to be “different”.
“I’d love that, Dean,” Cas sighs against his lips, “I’d love that. Dean, my love. Please, please talk to me. Tell me when you need something from me and I’ll tell you. We have to communicate for this to work, our relationship is too important to me to let it crumble, and… it’s not good for you to bottle things up like you do.”
“Pants,” Dean breathes out and pulls out a pair to hand to Castiel. Castiel takes them and Dean watches the denim slowly encase his skin, silently wishing it was his own hands gliding up those legs.
“Good Morning and welcome everyone,” The Pastor’s rich voice carries well under the cathedral ceilings.
Even when they make time to be together, Cas’ cohorts crash their lunch dates every single time. Cas’ birthday, Dean’s birthday, even their anniversary. The first time it happened it was Cas’ birthday, Dean had planned to take his mate out to lunch and he was looking forward to it for days. When Dean had arrived downtown, to the restaurant that he had picked to meet Cas and to see Meg, Balt, Alfie, Bart along with Cas. It was devastating but he dealt with it. Cas’ huge smile, while he introduced him to his friends, was completely worth it. When it happened again on his birthday, he thought… ok, everything is fine. But their anniversary was the last straw, Dean was pissed that Cas couldn't seem to tell them no, and he’s been brimming with low-key fury ever since.
“Make sure you keep your eyes on the road then,” Dean replies impishly as he caresses the hardening dick again. A few more determined caresses and his Alpha is fully hard, straining against those shorts.  His Alpha, even after all these years, is so attuned to his Omega, and so quick to respond to him.
“You should have a name if you're going to hang out with me,” Dean says in the midst of singing CCR’s “Who’ll stop the rain.” The dragon watches on, his snout arranged in a smile while Dean sings along to Foggerty’s lyrics.
Dean and Cas sit side by side at the large kitchen table. The table has obviously seen a lot of the Winchester family. It is large enough to seat maybe 12 comfortably and has a clean yet worn surface. Today the table is set with a gingham placemat set directly on the wood. The basket of freshly cut warm bread and a vase of wildflowers grace the centre.
He reaches the table just as Cas is scrambling to leave some cash on the table and grab their jackets.
“Ahh, Dean” Cas says, eyeing the surely burdensome bulge apparent at the front of Dean’s shorts. “Do you have  the Chrysler building in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?” Castiel, former Angel of The Lord collapses into giggles at the joke he just made.
“I see you as handsome, Alpha,” Dean states and kisses Cas again, blanketing Cas’ body with his. The drag of their clothed erections makes Cas gasp and Dean undulates his hips.
“I’ve missed you, Alpha,” Dean’s fingers bite into the flesh of Cas’ thighs. Rucking Cas’ shirt up he places an open mouthed kiss on the exposed skin of Cas’ hip bones. He can feel his mate become putty in his skilled hands, his flesh warm and pliant to his touch. Undoing the belt, he palms his husband to complete hardness through his boxer briefs. Dean’s mouth is watering at the sight of his mate’s member as it swells under his hands. He is seconds from having that beautiful cock in his mouth and maybe they’ll even be able to have a quick fuck in the bathroom. Dean’s slick is already gathering and he feels the heady warmth of arousal.
“We can do that, definitely. Silver Springs, right? With the monkeys?” Cas says and kisses Dean’s lips with pure affection.
Mindlessly putting away the rest of Cas’ clothes, Dean finds comfort in just being in their bedroom. He’s hiding again, but only after telling Krissy she is grounded and taking all of her electronics. He was so close to cutting up all her power cords, but then he’d eventually have to replace everything and he’d rather eat his own shoe than do that. Flopping down on their bed, Dean pushes his face into Cas’ pillow. His mate’s scent wraps around him and leeches all the worries from his body almost instantly. Dozing on and off, he is pleasantly woken up by strong and steady hands running up and down his back.
Gram takes a sip of her coffee, and rearranges her face into what Cas is sure she thinks is an apologetic look, but is really just coming across as smug. He crosses his arms and leans back.
“You won’t be and I definitely won't be disappointed,” Dean states and kisses Cas again. His Alpha’s erection has flagged with all the insecurities and so Dean slowly pumps him back to fullness. Devouring his moans and soft keens of pleasure. He moves open-mouthed kisses down his Alpha’s body, kissing the tip of his cock and watching it twitch and pearl prettily. Flicking out his tongue, he tastes the salty liquid, moaning loudly and encouragingly at the taste. He pumps and licks, kisses, swirls his tongue around the head, and watches Cas twitch and shake. Eyes screwed shut and mouth open in silent ecstasy.
“My love,” a soft knock on the bathroom door startles Dean from his reverie, “Are you hiding or pooping?”
“Yes, Castiel dear. I was just telling you, I baked a cake for the handsome firefighter who came to lecture us today. He taught us all about kitchen safety, and what to do if we smell smoke, and who to call. I feel very well equipped to handle a fire now!”
“I’ll wait,” Dean says promptly, stubbornly, folding the sweatshirt in his lap and putting it beside his Alpha’s pillow.
Castiel chooses a spot in the centre of the thick lawn, and waits for Dean to join him. Throwing an encouraging smile over his shoulder, Castiel is the epitome of cool sexy confidence. His smile only wavers when he searches Dean’s eyes and sees pure panic.
Feeling an undeniable escalation, Dean darts into the garage and pulls out the Barrett .50 cal he purchased after Naomi showed up. He hears the roars of fully formed dragons and the flash of fire through the garage window. Loading the clip with steady hands, Dean takes a deep breath. He’s not gonna let that asshole take Castiel.
With the Eucharist ready, and his readings at hand, Dean leaves the chancel and strides back down the nave to the doors. He is ready to greet his congregation as they arrive.
Standing, Cas unplugs the tub and holds out the towel for Dean to be wrapped up in. He dries Dean slowly, his mate letting out soft keens of pleasure and breathy imploring ‘Cas, Alpha, please.’ He spreads Dean out on the bed, warming the massage oil in his hand, and with tight reins on his Alpha, Castiel massages every square inch of Dean’s flesh. Dean settles a little, but his hips undulate up into Castiel’s hand whenever his hands get anywhere near them.
Dean smiles weakly and shuffles his pages. Perhaps today's sermon should shift focus to the nature of temptation, sin, and the importance of balance in all things.
Servants come then, fussing around the Prince and untying Dean’s lead from the horse and freeing his hands. Castiel dismounts and immediately disappears into the house. Dean is ushered to a different entry, less ornate, more functional. He enters through a stout door and finds himself in the bowels of the kitchen. He is given a stool in the corner and a meal is placed before him. Warm broth with chunks of vegetables, fresh bread and butter, and a glass of ruby-red wine. A servant tends to his neck and hands quickly, quietly, and efficiently. She uses water magic and Dean is pleasantly surprised that her magic doesn’t arouse him.
Clothes are shucked and tossed to the floor as the two men divest themselves of leathers, boots, and undershirts, and finally Dean feels Castiel’s warm skin against his own. Dean revels in the feeling of the firm and lightly haired chest pressed against his own. He can’t help but admire Cas’ physique, his broad shoulders and the thick thighs that speak of an underlying strength and solidity. Their cocks are hardening, warm and velvety in the valley of their hips as they sway and meet as the two men embrace.
“Castiel,” he simpers, voice full of fake sweetness, “lovely to see you. I wish it was under better circumstances.”
“You are awesome, buddy but slow down! No!” Dean exclaims as Folgers attempts to climb right into the cranberry sauce jar. “Dude, awww now you’re all sticky, not awesome.”
“Shower,” Cas commands, steering Dean towards the house and into the bathroom. Stripping both himself and Dean of his clothing as they go. Cas cranks on the shower, his erection pressed up against Dean’s ass cheek.
If not riding with him, Castiel would stare at Dean. Deep penetrating looks that would make Dean squirm.
Shaking his head that he doesn’t mind, answering Claire with a whisper of his own letting her know that it's all good. Claire visiting Jimmy in the psychiatric care facility has never been an issue with Dean. Jimmy is her Omega parent along with Cas’ twin, and he’s grateful to Jimmy for giving up Claire into their care. Dean unwraps the present, it is a record by Creedence Clearwater Band. It's a favorite band that he often listened to when the kids were growing up.
“I’ll take you, Claire,” Cas calls out from the sanctuary of the bathroom, feeling frustrated that their good time was interrupted.
That eyebrow always sends a shiver down Dean’s spine, and Castiel has learned to use it as a weapon for getting his own way.  Wetting his lips, Dean unzips Cas’ shorts, nipping and working the skin of his neck while his hand reaches into his Alpha’s boxer briefs and pulls his cock out. Twisting his hand around it, he enjoys the weight and the velvety softness stretched over something so rock hard. They steal a quick messy kiss, with Castiel’s eyes open and still mostly on the road.
“I’ll use my Alpha voice if you don’t get moving, it’s five-thirty. Jack won’t wake up till seven,” Cas replies his thumb rubbing over Dean’s mating bite.
Dean feels renewed in the early spring air. Usually, early spring only means a variety of tasks to Dean but this year is happily different. The biggest chore is overhauling the vegetable plot out back and getting it ready to plant a new garden. Dean has always enjoyed growing his own tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, and cucumbers. Home grown veggies were something Dean delighted in eating once Sam introduced him, much to Sam’s satisfaction. He was perfectly content to share this experience with Castiel.
“What do you want?” Dean whispers, attempting, and failing, to hold his hips away from Castiel’s searching ones. Lust blasts through him sharply when Castiel’s cocks graze against his own. Castiel gasps, his mouth dropping open.
None of that matters now, he’s got his Alpha in his arms and he never thought he’d ever have one. He’s big, loud, sassy, and definitely not the typical Omega. He’s twenty-two, a drop-out with a GED, with a can-do attitude working at his Dad’s garage as a mechanic.
Eye wandering up, Dean cannot tear his gaze from his dragon’s face. Pulling him into a kiss, Dean urges Cas on little desperate pleas against the dragon’s lips,
Dean nods at a few friends, and continues to think about Blue, how he’s set it up from nothing, how this small bar in the middle of nowhere feels somehow like an old friend. He shakes his head and smiles, as he turns to pour beers for the folks who’ve just walked in.
The King and the Princes control the elements, making them the most powerful family in the kingdom. Michael controls the air, Raphael fire, Gabriel water, and Castiel the Earth. Each mage has an affinity for an element but it is rumored that Castiel can wield them all. Dean’s Father hated magic and wanted to be rid of Michael’s rule, letting the states govern themselves. They had an army, but Michael was far too powerful.
The day goes by torturously slowly. Dean dodges questions until lunchtime, both from Bobby and from his own mind. He keeps busy, not thinking about the dragon who wishes to stay with him until lunchtime. He sets Castiel up with a burger and fries from the diner down the street. They both happily eat in the office while Dean looks over the notes Castiel took down. Cas did a decent job, recording messages for Dean. Castiel’s writing is an elegant, beautiful script that makes Dean feel a little guilty for making him write on scratch paper. Cas has also tidied up the office a little, his horde still in its mug and carefully perched on Dean’s desk close to hand.
“No,” Cas exclaims, “You’re perfect. You’re a man. I… I’m so glad. So grateful,” Cas stutters and continues with a slight awkward chuckle, “What do you do? Are you a student somewhere else?”
Cooking breakfast is a stilted affair, Castiel’s curious nature is still a heavily prevalent character trait even in human form. Dean bumps into him, steps on his toes, and at one point Castiel burns himself on the frying pan. Dean sits him down at the kitchen table, intent on administering first aid to see the man magically heal himself. He seems so quietly pleased with himself that Dean can’t even be mad. It was pretty awesome, a wave of a glowing hand, and the burn was instantly gone. They eat breakfast quickly and go over what Castiel needs to do when he answers the phone. It’s hasty, but Dean lets Castiel know what questions to ask the clients and what to write down for Dean to look over. Castiel takes it all in, his eyes never leaving Dean’s even as he’s being ushered towards the Impala. He’s docile when he gets into the car, but Castiel startles violently when Dean starts her up.
,” Castiel replies, breathless. Dean hums in agreement, so he tries to kiss Castiel sweetly, softly, but with one roll of Castiel’s tongue changes the tempo. Desperate, consuming, and delicious kisses spur Dean into action. With steadiness, he grasps Castiel’s cock in his hand. Thick and hot, Castiel feels unbelievably good. It’s been such a long time since Dean’s touched another and Castiel is certainly worth the wait.
“You try being practically naked in 17 degree weather,” he snipes, jerking on a beanie over his tousled hair. Removing the ski mask, Dean leans and kisses Castiel causing the other man to let out a little hum of a moan.
,” Castiel commands, dragging a finger down the crevice between Dean’s cheeks to gather slick. Tasting his mate’s slick, Castiel lets out a low growl. “More Omega.”
“I want to, but I-” Cas stops and takes a huge breath, “I might be terrible. I might disappoint you.”
After much discussion, mostly jokes laden with sexual innuendo, Dean purchases a sleek draft horse saddle. They retro-fit it to Castiel’s shoulder blades and add further stability for Dean. With a safety cord in place, he can fly easily knowing he will not fall off his dragon partner’s back and plummet violently to his death.
“I understand Mrs Butters, I’ll put him on right now. Just one moment,” and Bobby passes the phone over with a broad smirk under his beard.
Cas has been mother-henning him, taking care of him between his classes and Dean appreciates it. They’ve only been mated for five months, so everything is really, really new. They are still learning about each other. Dean feels like he learns something new every day, Castiel likes honey and peanut butter on his toast in the mornings and his coffee black. He’s fastidious about his books but careless about his laundry. Cas tends to shove things behind cabinets and in the back of closets and forget about the messes. Dean hates it, but he’s sure he does some things Cas hates. (He does, but Cas is too nice and is too infatuated with everything Dean does to say anything about it.)
“What do you mean?” Dean scoffs, folding over his arms, refusing to look at his naked Alpha. That’s another thing… they haven’t had sex in months and just seeing Cas naked is like a damn treat. Both of them are on rut and heat suppressants, but regardless... Dean’s mad, but he’s also so horny, and his Alpha is naked now. He just wants to touch all of his skin and soak in being close. He wants to fuck and fight and he’s so damn confused.
“Please sit down so that Firefighter Winchester can finish his coffee, there’s a good boy.” His Gram then has the audacity to look up at him and wink!
“Folgers it is,” Dean laughs while cracking eggs and putting them into the pan, “If only my family could see me now, they’d think I’d lost my marbles.”
Ben and Jack stand at the side door, falling into each other, scrambling to get out of the garage but falling over each other and their gardening equipment in the process. Their horrified faces only slow Cas down a little, but his Alpha is so desperate he can’t stop. Dean has teased him too long in the car and his Alpha is riding high on his body’s instincts.
“Hello, there,” Dean had practically purred, “Haven’t seen you in here before.” Dean had given the stranger as good as he got and had looked the guy up and down. “I’m Dean,” Dean preemptively sighed to himself, usually this part doesn’t go well, “And I’m the Pastor at St Mary’s.” Cas raises his eyebrows, but he doesn’t back off or look disappointed.
“I will lose it from disuse if my keeper won’t let me bed him,” Castiel replies saucily back, hands running up Dean’s arms and pulling Dean back into another kiss. Dean goes willingly, happily.
Dean grabs another chair and drags it closer to Bobby, and he starts, “Well, I was just making a cup of coffee the other morning, and went to grab my favourite cup…” Dean’s story meanders somewhere in the middle, voice trailing about how curious Castiel is and how he got into the butter but eventually, Dean gets back on track, “...and he pointed out the plaque that Mom made me for my birthday last year - it actually means it’s a safe house, or I’m a guardian or something? He said we had the start of a bond.”
It makes his Alpha color more, his cheeks already a flaming hue. So Dean tries it again, rolling the name over his tongue with curiosity, “Castiel.” It doesn’t quite suit him, it doesn’t feel intimate enough to Dean, but Cassie seems derogatory to his Alpha. So Dean looks at his Alpha once again and simply states, “Cas.”
“I didn’t know for sure that was going to happen,” Castiel replies, his own healed hand cupping Dean’s face, “It was a reflection of our bond.”
With clear intent, Dean leaves Sam’s dorm building and hauls ass outside. His sharp huffs of breath are making clouds of mist in the night sky. Taking a left turn, his brother shoots out a strong hand to wrap around his bicep. “Wrong way, numbnuts,” Sam mutters and directs Dean the right way, crazy Omega still clutching the sweater.
“Cruel. But fair,” Castiel states, trying to look so serious, “I’ll probably be incredibly stubborn, very ornery.”
“Bedroom.” Dean didn’t dare to speak a full sentence. His arousal had been instant and physically apparent, as his dick was suddenly rock hard and uncomfortable against his zipper.
“Yes, love,” Castiel responds softly against Dean’s lips, “I can never say no to my beautiful Omega.”
“What makes you think that?” Dean growls, he’s feeling stubborn tonight but he leans into his mate’s touch. It’s been so long since Cas has even touched him. He’s desperate for it.
Cas blinks to clear the water from his eyes, and gazes at Dean as he drops a single kiss to the gargantuan glans. Dean is on a hair trigger, much more stimulation of his massive man meat and his cock would be jolting with jism any minute.
With a perfunctory nod from the dragon, Dean sets about his task. Getting his large skillet ready, he grabs the occupied mug and places it next to the stove. The dragon resting its long head on its front talons on the rim of his mug. Throwing the bacon into one side of the pan, Dean switches on his kitchen radio to the classic rock station.
Flying to Canada on the back of a dragon is very different than being stuffed in a tin can death trap for eighteen plus hours. Dean feels free, the sky is huge and the view is awesome in the moonlight, even if he is a little chilly. After spending all the day in the air with his dragon, Dean is starting to feel the wind nip at his face and hands through his layers. He’s completely covered head to toe, Castiel had insisted but he’s immensely grateful to his dragon. Dean couldn’t imagine the ride without Castiel’s planning and attention to detail.
Wrapping a large hand around Dean’s cock, Castiel strokes slowly enjoying the drag of skin beneath his hands. Watching Dean flush underneath him and the slow undulation of his hips seeking out more. It’s a powerful thing, watching Dean give in to the rapture of his flesh. When Castiel takes Dean into his mouth, he locks eyes with his lover. Watching the tears of pleasure gather in those green eyes, bottom lip abused by his teeth trying to stifle the moans that will echo through the estate. He abuses Dean’s stamina, edging him to the brink of release and stopping. His lover trembles beneath him and Castiel gathers him in his arms.
Cas pulls out gently as Dean flips over, his bow legs turning gracefully to embrace Cas once more. Castiel slides home again, his eyes never leaving Dean’s, and as he bottoms out he promises himself to cherish his mate forever.
Dean trails a hand down Cas’ back, reveling in the softness of his skin. Dean’s fingertips are a little pruney, but he traces patterns absentmindedly along Cas’ spine. Listening to the soft exhalations of his Alpha letting go and relaxing into him. Their scents intermingle and calm each other.
The ring of muscle is soft with ridges and so very tight. Dean’s a little giddy at the prospect of hopefully making Castiel see stars.
Castiel never steps out of Dean’s space, but he takes the henley and slowly puts it on while Dean looks for boxers for him. Handing Castiel some boxer briefs, Dean watches Castiel dress slowly. Dean would have never guessed that putting on clothes could look so sexy. Seeing his underpants slowly drag over the fine hairs over another man’s legs and then over those thick thighs does things to Dean. Dean’s eyes are glued to Castiel’s hands as he tucks his cock into the boxer briefs. Huge hands, long fingers dipping below the waistband to cup and maneuver it into place. Fuck, is all Dean can think.
Dean cannot see, but Cas has swallowed water and is struggling not to panic as he is pushed out of his depth and can no longer feel the bottom.
“I see Michael’s name, he’s an ancestor of mine, third grandfather or so but most are people from my court,” Castiel says, pointing out a name.
“This is not about the toothpaste cap,” Castiel says quietly, his deep voice rumbling and so very sexy. Dean can feel his eyes on him and Cas’ hands are steady on his hips. Fingers drumming along his spine and hands starting to wander. His Alpha has grown into his body the last four years, no longer the lithe freshmen he met five years ago. He’s not quite as tall as Dean, but he’s got a beautiful strong runner’s build.
Lying on the soft bed, in the warm room, Dean’s skin is hypersensitive and he can feel every place that his Alpha’s skin is pressed against his own. His arms, his chest, his legs, each point of contact is almost zipping with static. Dean holds his Alpha closer, almost desperately as he tries to soak in the comforting smells of mate, home, and mine.
Castiel can feel his knot slowly building, knowing his mate likes to talk dirty, he pants out, “I was hard all day, smelling like you.
With Sam unable to watch the kids, Castiel is scrambling to do something special for Dean. He stops and buys all the ingredients to make dinner. Along with pie from a local bakery, he grabs Dean’s favorite whiskey and special oils for a long tub soak. He’s cursing at himself, he’s really fucked it up but he’s hoping that Dean will forgive him.
Sam, bless him, scrambles for rope while the ice cracks and groans underneath him. Slow and steady, the teenager is pulled safely on his belly to the bank. Dean remains calm, he knows how to get out of the ice if it breaks...he’s watched a lot of Youtube.
“Dean baby,” she says, hugging Dean tight and letting him go, “This must be your friend that Bobby was talking to me about. It’s so nice to meet you, Castiel.”
“I’m not sick, not like Jack. I just ate something nasty,” Claire offers when Castiel picks her up and sets her up on the kitchen counter.
“Well,” Dean drops his head down onto the kitchen table with a loud thunk, “I guess I’ll sleep when I’m old and ugly. He’s leeching away all my good looks, one three AM wakeup at a time.”
Dean is passionate in his statement, and then realises he doesn't need to be as both Cas and Bobby are smirking at him now, hiding their laughter. It’s one thing to wind him up, but they should never tease him about Cas, not ever. Dean would never admit it, but he’s still insecure about his relationship with Cas. He’s still terrified that he’ll lose the dragon. One day he’ll wake up and the love of his life would have decided to be with someone better, Castiel will be gone leaving Dean with nothing.
“You take it off only to shower, and then leave it on the bathmat, don’t hang it on the back of the door”
Castiel stares at him for a second and Dean can see the wheels turning, “We’ll revamp your resume and start looking for new postings. I don’t want you to work somewhere you are uncomfortable. You should quit.”
Feeling pleased with his Omega, Castiel sucks on his hole, making Dean yelp out and moan so loudly that Castiel prays it doesn’t wake the kids. Fresh slick hits Castiel’s tongue.
Cas is leaning his butt against his kitchen counter, and staring out across the garden through the kitchen window.
“You had your long johns on! And look sunshine, you're the one who wanted to do the ceremony in the wilderness and not in the comfort of the lodge’s hot tub,” Dean teases and kisses Castiel again.
“Hey, buddy?” He waits for a sign that the dragon is relenting. “Wanna sandwich?” Dean sees the tip of the dragon’s tail twitch. “I can do turkey and cranberry on rye with mayo?” One blue eye and then the other open slowly. An even slower nod indicates the little dragon has heard and is ready to interact again. Dean smiles and grabs the “hoard” and then more carefully the coffee cup, cradling it to his chest for the short walk back through the house to the kitchen.
Dean’s head jerks up so fast he nearly collides with the opened hood “What?, He’s not, he couldn’t possibly be, you don’t...” stammers Dean, hesitantly meeting Bobby’s eye.
Chuck has worked out that it is cruel to take Cas from Dean. But it is crueler to sear those memories of their time together from Dean’s mind entirely, leaving him drifting and forever lonely; always seeking what he has lost without knowing it.
Dean isn’t worried until Bart uses his body weight to pin Castiel. Hidden in the tall grass on his belly, Dean lines up, eye in the scope, and makes his mark. Ears ringing, dragon roaring and flailing from the shot Dean took straight through his wing.
“Oh wow,” Cas whispers and hesitantly touches the mess behind Dean’s balls. He brings up to his fingers and sniffs and with a tentative tongue tastes the slick on his fingers. Shocked, he moans loudly and sticks his fingers deeper into his mouth.
“Push the button, Cas,” Dean groans, his feet shuffling as he blindly makes his way across the kitchen, “Jack woke up at three AM again last night, I swear I’m not going to be able to sleep until he’s grown. Maybe by the time he’s a teenager, I’ll be able to sleep.”
“I was disobedient,” Cas says, a frown maring his lips and he releases Dean’s hand, “I didn’t follow orders. I didn’t like the matches that my parents put before me.”
“I can help with that, I love fishing,” Dean offers with a ready smile. The three dig for worms and make their way down to the river.
Cas stands, using his Alpha strength, he pulls Dean’s wet body up and out of the tub wrapping Dean’s legs around his hips. Soaking the Alpha’s shirt and jeans, Dean lets out an exclamation of surprise that turns into a loud moan when Cas sucks on his old mating bite. Depositing Dean on the bed, Cas nips and plants open mouthed kisses down Dean’s body. His lips hovering over Dean’s cock, his words and breath teasing the tip.
With every question posed, the dragon would always tilt his head, waiting earnestly for Dean to give an answer. Sometimes he looked at Dean like he held the answers to life, the universe and everything. Most days, Dean found it endearing, and he’d pull Castiel in for a sweet kiss. Kissing the confusion off of his dragon’s countenance was becoming one of his favorite pastimes. Today though, Castiel had been antsy and on edge since he woke up, and it felt like he was purposely annoying Dean.
“Come with me, sweetheart. Let’s do this properly. I want to worship you on a bed, I want to do this right. You deserve more than me…” Cas begins to protest but Dean stills him with a finger to his lips, “You deserve more than me, but here’s the thing. You have me, all of me, body and soul, as your partner, your lover and your true keeper, if you want me.”
The boys are headed to the public pool in Lawrence to give Cas his final swimming lesson for the summer. Since falling and becoming human, Cas has had to painstakingly learn many of the skills that before had just required a whisper of grace. Dean was kinda chuffed that he got to teach his Angel some “people skills."
He’s the only entomologist on staff, the only melittologist in the state, and an Alpha to boot but Naomi wants to break him and mold him into some version of Castiel that she wants. He won’t let her. He’ll go down swinging, he won’t let this chignon wearing psycho worm her way into his psyche. Castiel has just managed to secure his position as Assistant Professor, he’s the youngest on staff, and they need the little boost in income to comfortably keep Dean home with the kids. He’s one step away from tenure and he’ll be damned if she gets in the way of it.
Making a sandwich is an art Dean Winchester has perfected over many years. Making a sandwich with an overly inquisitive and attentive dragon solemnly attempting to help has him in stitches of laughter. There’s mayo on the kitchen counter, three slices of bread have been torn by unpracticed claws and tossed aside, and there are bite marks in the stick of butter. How the dragon got into the butter when he’s not even using it a mystery in itself.
