"Are you alright?" Castiel asks gently, hand still on Dean's elbow.
"You and my brother," Sam says, prompting Castiel to speak, but Castiel doesn't know what Sam wants him to say. At Castiel's continued confusion, Sam rolls his eyes and goes on, "You've been touching each other a lot, y'know. Like, you touched each other a lot before, but it's been worse."
“Things?” Castiel asks, tilting his head to the side curiously.
He shifts back into his human form with cracking bones, groaning before he stretches to pull out all the kinks. He doesn't bother putting any clothing on (he barely wears any anymore, even if he keeps it in his bag just in case). The raven watches him, and he wonders why it hasn't flown off yet.
"And now we wait," Dean agrees.
Castiel puts his hand up to stop Dean's sentence. "I believe your brother assisted."
Castiel hangs around the doorway, but Benny walks to the bed and moves Dean's knees so he can take a seat next to him. Dean watches Castiel's eyes drift to Benny's, and he can see Castiel's half of a silent conversation. Eventually, after what feels like forever, Castiel moves, reaching the bed and climbing to his knees, leaning against the bed with his forearms braced on the mattress, resting his chin on his hands.
Dean makes a frustrated grunting noise and throws his phone onto the mattress. He gets his wool coat from the hallway closet and pulls it on. He collects his wallet and then his phone, pointedly not checking for any other text (or damned photo, the bastard) from Benny before shoving it in his pocket.
"Castiel's the opposite," Dean turns to look at the raven again and says, "It's really him. It’s really my brother, isn't that insane?" With a flap of wings, the raven lifts into the air and settles itself on Dean's shoulder, pecking at a patch of scalp above his ear. "Oi, quit it."
Dean nods, hand snaked around Castiel’s waist. “Much, thank you Castiel.”
A muscle under Lucifer's eye twitches, his mouth turned into a frown. "Why would I tell you when I can simply retrieve him myself?"
By the time he's gone back to his text history with Castiel, Castiel has replied: first with a string of emojis - the ones with the crossed out eyes, mouth in an o shape, the one that's smirking, the one with a squiggly line for a mouth and the one that's blushing - and then with,
“A few hours. Maybe until breakfast if you promise me bacon,” Dean smirks.
Castiel’s cheeks burn redder and he nuzzles his face into Dean’s hand, eyes fluttering closed. He rolls his hips and presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s palm, then says, “Say it again?”
The woman at the counter is tall and blonde and she smiles at them as they approach, “We have a discount for G-men.” When Dean shoots her a confused and curious look - they aren’t suited up - the woman laughs. “We’re a relatively small community and everyone’s a huge gossip. Particularly Sheriff Vaughan, my father.”
It takes Castiel a second, but suddenly, understanding and recollection graces his features and he laughs. "The last time I saw Jo she was ten and convinced she was a cat."
"For fuck's sake just do it."
“What the hell is wrong with us?” Dean asks, stumbling back to the bed before he collapses, falling onto the mattress with a grunt. He feels like his mind is made of cotton wool and his body is made of jelly. He’s either been spelled or drugged and neither is good.
Benny collapses on top of both Dean and Castiel, still inside Dean, panting into Castiel's neck, and it's really uncomfortable but Dean's too exhausted to care. Dean lets his eyes fall closed and doesn't realise he's actually fallen asleep until the bed is shifting underneath him. He realises that he's mostly clean, and Benny's passed out beside him, and also that Castiel's getting out of bed.
Dean kisses him again. "You got it."
They start it during the day so they'll be able to tell if it works - if Castiel shifts back into his human form.
Dean sits back against the back of the couch and stares up at Castiel. "I'm not really sure what I'm doing, either, Cas."
Dean must not be doing enough, too slow for Castiel’s liking, because Castiel shoves his knee into the side of Dean’s and says, “Pay attention.”
Cas has asked, and then after a moment, I mean his favourite alcohol.
He takes Baby this time, and parks her round the back, letting himself in the back door with the key on his key chain, locking it behind him.
It was most definitely Rowena's car, and it's parked in the garage when he gets there. He parks next to it, climbs out, and is surprised when Rowena and Jack do the same, like they had seen him in the parking lot, too, and were waiting for him to arrive.
Angel tips back his head and the room seems to freeze in time. Dean can hear his own breath for a second. The anticipation of this moment stretches so tight that Dean clenches his fist. Then the music crashes down over the crowd. The crowd exhales and a shining bright explosion of joy rocks the DJ's head back and he is laughing. White teeth shining and one arm raised. Those enormous wings stretch slowly open and curve inward to embrace the crowd. Shining lines of blue light spill between the feathers. Dean's dick is as astounded as the rest of him and he hardens instantly. Fuck. He is beautiful. So goddamn beautiful. This Angel is completely caught up in the music. His body is vibrating with joy and the crowd is pushing all of it right back at the stage. It feels like waves. Waves of total happiness to be here. Angel is inviting them in. He is introducing himself. Showing himself. It's shockingly intimate. Dean hasn't ever seen anyone this exposed outside of the bedroom. This music is enough to explain Angel. Its enough to listen to it. To know him. It hurts to see him this exposed. Like he has just ripped open his chest and let everyone see the light inside. Dean can't look anymore. He swallows and turns his head and tries to slow his heartbeat. He silently begs the DJ to relieve him.
Dean smirks, suddenly way too pleased with himself and the world in general.
He knows exactly what he needs to do. He will comfort his Alpha. Give him some place to rest that is warmed by the encircling scent of loving Omega. Castiel undresses slowly, letting his chest expand with the feeling of reaching out to hold Mr. Winchester close. Slipping into the freshly made bed feels so good. The pillow and mattress are soaked in the heavy bass notes of Alpha scent. Castiel breathes deeply and feels his throat closing with emotion.
“Yeah.” Dean says, nonsensically. Is he agreeing? To what?
Benny turns his head with relief evident on his face. “Hey brotha, there you are. I was hoping you would be back before we got to the station. Your shoulder is fucked. I talked them out of taking you to the hospital. I knew an ambulance would cost another fortune. It’s already gonna cost you a shit ton. I’ll help you pop it in. I got a sling somewhere in the house.”
At least they are alone. No comments from the peanut gallery. Just the droning haze of cicadas and the distant metallic song of a windchime. Quiet. The silence stretches on and on while Dean waits for it. Whatever “It” might be.
Castiel ties the cleverly constructed Kimono over the heavy drape of his wings and begins to center himself onto that bright heaven shard that holds his music. There. The rolling heavy stomp. Like a chanting meditation. Its techno in this time and place. It has been so many kinds of music, in different worlds and times. A heartbeat thrum. He was created to sing “holy, holy” around the throne. It was a song. A repeating rolling hum. A reminder for all beings to tune themselves to. A battery to sustain all of heaven for eternity. To listen is to drop into meditation and find the rhythm and heart of life. The tick of bodies existing in time. The metronome of eons passing and energy decaying. For every rising tide there is the falling back. This swishing swing from life to death and back again, the endless cycling beat. Sunlight and shadow and breath that comes and leaves. He had sang this song for ages, millennia. Until even the time for him to stop came. It wasn’t the end of the song. There isn’t really one. But it was the falling breath of confusion and fright. The discordant jangling threat of his song being turned from the face of an absent god into the weapon of angels. So he left. The ragged seams of heaven had made a soldier of all of them. There wasn’t the luxury of millennia to just keep the flow of heaven in beat. Instead, every angel had to find the rhythm themselves and so many songs were stuck on the tip of an angel blade.
And tender pinions from the artist flows
The angel nods. “The henge is shaped like my wings. Exactly like my wings. The gate will only let something shaped like that through. Like a key fitting into a lock. It is a henge. For me.”
Cas flexes his thighs to lift his weight and Dean almost whines at the loss. The Omega laughs softly and rubs his hand through Dean's hair. “Don't worry Alpha, I'm not going anywhere.” kneeling up, Cas crawls up to the center of Dean's chest, his cock brushing the Alpha's chin before he settles heavy and slow there. His weight drops in degrees and Dean moans. His breath is being mashed away beneath the crushing weight. The trapped hot scent of apples and cinnamon is so strong that Dean's jaw aches and his mouth fills with saliva. His mouth is watering. And Cas is so close. So crowded up into Dean's face that he blocks out the entire world. His cock stands just inches from Dean's nose and mouth and that weight is pushing, pushing, mashing him down into the mattress. Dean grips the sheets so tightly that the corner pops from the mattress. This is everything he didn't know he wanted. He has no idea how Cas knew or guessed because he never would have. So he tips his head forward, his eyes rolling up to ask and opens his mouth.
And maybe you don't need to breathe
“Yes, Angel. Tell me.”
“I mean, the materials. Your body was rebuilt after I pulled you from hell. The material was all touched by my grace. Handled by it. I am pretty sure just about every inch of your skin is imbued with grace. You manage to keep breaking it too. So I have healed you. Many times. Infusing your body with grace.” It is Castiel’s turn to be fidgeting with the bottle and avoiding Dean’s eyes. “Grace always bends to return to its source. If you hold a vial of grace next to any angel, it will lean toward it. It is attractive. It seeks to join with the life force of grace that burns inside us. The henge would have a source of power in the grace. The henge would point toward and reach toward it’s original source.”
Dean's cheeks grow warm and he nods his head, leaning down to meet Castiel in the middle for a gentle press of lips. Castiel's lips are warm and smooth, and he tastes like whiskey and cheese, and Dean thinks very seriously about pressing Castiel to the car and licking the taste from his mouth. He doesn't, because he's respectable - okay no, he really isn't, but he wants Castiel to think he is, at least for a little while.
“We should assist Emma in packing up the camp.”
"Gabriel," Castiel says, with all the disapproving anger of an angel of the Lord.
-*-*-
Maybe Metatron?
', but I just wondered."
"And Dean, does he…?"
"Now that you've figured it out, can you go do something about it? I'm sick and tired of the sexual tension, and I've only had a couple years of it. Sam's had it for most of his adulthood," Eileen says with a raised eyebrow, arms crossed over her chest with her fingers tapping at his arm. She looks impatient with him, but also exceedingly amused, and it's making Castiel very confused.
Dean chuckles, "Calm down, I'll get there." When he looks up at Castiel, he's scowling, but it's not that impressive when coupled with the red flush and his kiss-swollen lips. Dean decides to give him a break, then, and finds the bottle of lube, smearing his fingers with the slick. Before he gets his fingers on Castiel's skin he spreads Castiel's legs further open.
The fourth body is in a public, but quiet street, filled with CCTV cameras. Like the two previous murders, the drop-off is in plain view of the cameras, the perpetrator visible: the third victim.
Castiel helps Dean make burgers, though he mostly sits at the kitchen island cutting ingredients while Dean stands at the stove. Castiel still isn't allowed to cook anything that involves the stove and oven after the time he started a
“Yeah,” Dean says with a nod. “Might as well get it over and done with.”
As Dean waits for his food, he realises he's just invited Benny out on their first proper date. They've been sleeping together for years, and sure, they've had food together, out and at home, but it's never been an actual date before. Castiel got into his head, and honestly he's pretty sure he's going to kiss him for it.
, but Benny's beat him to it with a
Castiel reaches down behind him, between Dean’s thighs for the base of the vibrator, knocking it inside Dean’s body. Dean’s thinks he plans to just fuck Dean with it, until the vibrations start.
Mia interrupts, saying Dean's name in a gentle but firm tone, questioning. "Dean?"
"Jo," Dean says, shooting her a look.
. It's a five-hundred-year-old grimoire and it contains a spell that will return any archangel on Earth to Heaven and keep them there for an unknown period of time."
“Has he? I hadn’t noticed.”
“My closet,” Castiel replies, worrying at his bottom lip with his teeth. Dean’s eyes track the movement for a second, before moving away so quickly Castiel’s sure he’s imagined it. “My tie, too. And my sweatpants, my hoodie, the AC/DC t-shirt you gave to me.”
Dean makes a face, pouting out his bottom lip.  "But you're hot as fuck, why wouldn't he want to have sex with you?"
Dean clasps a hand around Sam's cheek, smiling sadly. "It's just us now, kid. Patience said you thought you were the last wolf, did Ellen…?"
“Make it quick, please.”
His heart is racing, and he can't make himself move to knock on the door, but he doesn't need to. The cabin's occupant flings the door open and steps out, holding a shotgun. His hair is unnecessarily long and he's wearing flannel and scuffed leather boots. He smells like
Emma takes the passenger seat while Dean drives and Castiel sits slumped in the back. He's particularly good at playing this world's Castiel and it makes Dean weirdly uneasy. Emma is holding open a map, and she hums thoughtfully while she reviews it.
When he turns around to head back to work Castiel's Continental is sitting in the driveway of the Bed and Breakfast to his left, six buildings down from the shop. He hadn't even heard the car pull up. Castiel's staring at him, but he looks away when Dean smiles at him and waves politely. Well.
Benny doesn't hand the condom over - like Dean thinks both he and Castiel were expecting - rolling it onto Castiel's dick himself, kissing him as he does so. Heat pools in Dean's belly as he watches, his dick jerking against his belly, and he reaches down to wrap his hand around it, just to hold it in his palm.
"A bit, but I'm mostly putting it on to fuck with Sam." He pushes Castiel towards one of the tables, getting between his thighs. "Besides, the whole crazy situation worked, didn't it?"
. And how long for. But he doesn't say that, cause he really
Jack promises not to, though Castiel knows he’ll do it again - he gets so distracted, so consumed by his new purpose, that everything else gets forgotten sometimes.
Dean's cheeks flush red and he nods his head, climbing off the bed so he can go over to the bedside table and pull open the top drawer, retrieving a small bottle of clear liquid from inside. He looks at the bottle in his hand, and then back at Castiel and says, "I figure it's kind of like doing a girl?"
Dean gets the distinct impression that the man is no longer talking about pie and whiskey.
Eventually, Benny says something to Dean, something in French, a phrase he recognises but he can't quite get his brain to understand. It takes a second for it finally sink in, for Dean to finally hear the words;
"I'm sorry, Cas."
"Yeah. Me too."
Rowena taps her finger over her lip. "Power comes with age, it's likely this witch is incredibly old and has no problem working with demons." She suddenly stops and her mouth turns down into a frown. "You know the story of Little Briar Rose - Sleeping Beauty? The sleeping curse? It was based on medieval prose, Perceforest, which was in turn based on the story of Endymion, a mortal man who fell in love with the goddess Selene. According to legend, Selene asked Zeus to grant Endymion eternal life, but Zeus instead put the man into an eternal sleep."
Sam appears first, sitting at the table next to Jack, clapping a hand over his shoulder in greeting, and smiling over at Rowena. Castiel hands the pot of pasta to Dean who places it on the table, then the pile of plates, then the salad Dean begrudgingly made (after a fair amount of complaint). There's still most of a bottle of wine in the fridge and Castiel grabs that while he's reaching for the beers. Eileen looks nauseous again when she enters the room, she’s a bit pale and looks like she might vomit, the way she’s looked on and off for days. Castiel's suddenly reminded of the hours Kelly would spend in front of the toilet the closer she got to her due date. She often complained about having to go through the morning sickness again, and not being told that it could reoccur.
Castiel goes easily when Dean pulls him in, letting himself be led, his head moving into the right position so when their lips meet again there's no teeth and no pain. His lips are soft and gentle, carefully easing Castiel into something more with his tongue, sliding a hand around the back of Castiel's neck to hold him there (not that Castiel would ever go anywhere). Castiel holds onto Dean by his sides, fitting his hands around the curves of his hips, feeling the way the muscles bunch and jump under his shirt.
"I can't break it, Dean. Only the witch that crafted it or the trigger they created can break it," she squeezes Castiel's shoulder, giving him a sad but kind smile. When she lets go she sits at the chair in front of the desk and plants her elbows on the wood, linking her fingers together and resting her chin on them. She sighs, "I can tell you who cursed him though. Crowley."
Rufus is leaning over an old man's body and while Dean has never met him, he suspects he's the man who died in the nursing home overnight, Mark something. "What do you want?"
When she's finished eating he catches her attention and signs, "Is it alright if Castiel and his children come to thanksgiving?"
Castiel grins at him and says, “Alright, now where were we?” before pulling the angel into another kiss.
conversation with him, I wouldn’t tell him.” Dean nods his head. “Oh! I’m Cat, by the way. In case you need anything. I live above the cafe.”
Castiel’s trying so hard not to get upset, to continue trying, that Dean feels kinda bad for laughing at him. He’s got a furrow between his brows and Dean reaches forward to smooth it with his thumb.
They share the appetizers until most of it is gone, and their first waitress is back with the mains. They end up sharing those too, mostly cause Benny really wanted to try the lamb, and Castiel wanted the pork belly. Dean was happy to let them take what they wanted from his plate, sneaking pieces from theirs, smiling brightly when they turn to look at him.
makes the heat in his gut grow stronger and spread through his body, to his fingertips and his toes. Once he's been divested of his shirt he surges forward to kiss Dean again, wrapping an arm around his shoulder to pull them closer together. He slides his palm over the scarred handprint across the freckled skin of Dean's shoulder, missing the thrum of his own power he left there when he raised Dean from hell, a thrum he felt every time he touched it when he still had his Grace. A shiver runs through Dean and Castiel wonders if Dean can still feel it, even if Castiel can't anymore.
Rowena scoffs, shaking her head. "My son doesn't protect anyone but himself and his own interests."
Dean wiggles out of his briefs and climbs up Castiel's body, pressing kisses into his skin as he goes. Just as Dean is kissing Castiel and taking his cock in his hand to steady it, they hear drunken yelling from down the hallway. It's a male voice, so it has to be Sam, and it's not scared or angry so Dean doesn't worry. He just laughs.
Castiel nods his head, standing beside Dean. Dean climbs to his feet and they stand together looking down at the body. Eventually, the medical examiner interrupts their silence to move them out of the way so the body can be collected.
"And here? With us right now? Before you have to go back and get ready to leave?"
Castiel’s heat still looms over the horizon, and he has absolutely no idea how he plans to handle it now - especially knowing Dean might go into a spontaneous heat if he’s with Castiel - but it’s something to think about another day. For now, he’s more than happy to sit here in the Impala with Dean and kiss him, while Stevie Nicks singing gently in the background.
Castiel doesn't reply for a long time, tapping his finger on the top of the car. He lets out a short breath and says, "What's going on here?"
Dean frowns. “How long have you been alone?”
"Okay. Weird. It's been weird," Dean replies, turning his head so he can look at Castiel, sliding his arm under his head. "Everything's just very… weird."
Sam meets with the other man's lawyer and they agree to a bargain without taking it to court. Dean pays for damages, including the man's hospital bills, and agrees to see Mia more regularly and review his medications and therapies, and the man agrees to never set foot back in town. In the deal, it's also agreed that if either break it, they go to court, and the particulars of the fight are brought up, including the sexual harassment and hateful comments, and that the man threw the first punch. Sam tells Dean that the lawyer wasn't aware of the man's side in the argument, and became more insistent that they agree on the deal. Dean ends up paying two and a half thousand for hospital fees and five hundred for damages, which is the same cost as an assault fine.
He finds one behind a large boulder a few feet from the patch of Cyprus and he picks it up, careful not to damage it in any way. It's beautiful, despite the fact it mostly looks like a moth, with big yellow eyes on its wings to scare away predators and light grey veins. He's not positive it's the right one, so he shows it to Castiel before he puts it in another pouch when the angel nods.
“Patience, Castiel. We’ll get to that. First, turn over.”
"So he is your brother, then?" Claire asks Dean. She doesn't think very highly of him, and he's not sure why, but he feels the same about her. Especially when she can't seem to handle a cordial word towards him, despite the fact he's never been anything but moderately friendly towards her. Dean nods. "Good." She doesn't elaborate, but he thinks she means that she's glad he found Sam, which is strangely nice of her. "Well, I have no idea where he's going to sleep."
Castiel doesn't speak, instead, he squeezes Dean's knee again. Dean scrubs at his suspiciously stinging eyes with the heels of his palms and lets out a sharp breath of air. Once he's decided he's composed himself enough to go back inside, he pats Castiel's hand and climbs to his feet. He stands in front of Castiel and reaches out to take his cheek in his hand, stroking over his cheekbone.
Castiel transports them to Macedonia, for the Cyprus cones, the butterfly and the teeth, while explaining to Dean that he might have to sniff out the corpses before they dig them up.
"I sent Adam to live with a psychic, I thought it would be safer if the two of you were apart," Bobby looks almost apologetic. "Last I heard they'd gotten her, but nothing about Adam."
“If you’re going to present, yes,” Sam replies, nodding his head. “But what will you do if you do present?”
. "Sure."
"That would be totally weird and you know it," Dean tells her, rolling his eyes and kissing Mary's forehead before handing her back over to Eileen. He kisses Eileen's cheek and signs, "I love you asshole, I'll see you tonight."
Eileen chews her lip and thinks for a moment, like she’s trying to decide what to say and how to say it. “The arousal will feel like a fever, but you won’t actually have one. You’ll feel fuzzy, maybe a bit dizzy, and it will feel all-consuming, the only thing you can think and feel, especially the first time.”
Castiel helps Dean make burgers, though he mostly sits at the kitchen island cutting ingredients while Dean stands at the stove. Castiel still isn't allowed to cook anything that involves the stove and oven after the time he started a
"Fuck, Dean," Castiel whispers, hands sliding up Dean's thighs to settle on his hips. His touch helps Dean relax enough to slide down further until he's bottomed out and sitting over Castiel's groin.
"Cas, what the fuck?"
The laugh that comes from Lucifer's mouth sounds like nails on a chalkboard, or styrofoam, and Dean pushes down the urge to grimace. "A gun, Dean? Really?"
"I'll probably get there by mid August, I'll give you guys a date when I know it. Tomorrow I have to put my papers in and tell the dean to go fuck himself."
"You said you like COD, do you have Black Ops? I like the zombies."
patrol the graveyards?”
Sam nods, hopefully taking it as Dean's request to watch Lucifer and Dagon around the others. When he doesn't move to follow them, Dean knows he has.
Gods, he wished Castiel was here with him.
“We won’t know until you do,” Eileen signs. “Dean’s attraction to you is no indication. Same presentation mating mating pairs are just as common as opposite presentation mating pairs.”
"Now that you've figured it out, can you go do something about it? I'm sick and tired of the sexual tension, and I've only had a couple years of it. Sam's had it for most of his adulthood," Eileen says with a raised eyebrow, arms crossed over her chest with her fingers tapping at his arm. She looks impatient with him, but also exceedingly amused, and it's making Castiel very confused.
Castiel doesn’t actually get to talk to Dean alone, cause as soon as Sam and Eileen are gone (on a salt’n’burn case they stole from Claire and Kaia) Jack appears in the kitchen looking for his cereal and a place to crash. He looks exhausted. While Jack is a celestial deity, he’s still at least somewhat human, and does occasionally need to take care of human needs. He forgets that sometimes. He usually only stays a night or two before flying back to heaven to continue his full scale overhaul.
Deanna dives into the room and falls into his arms with a screech of his name. "I bought you a present yesterday, but I'm not allowed to tell you what it is."
Dean nods his head once and spares one last look at the bed where Kelly had been, the blood-stained sheets, the towels still lying on top of it. His chest clenches and he has to look away before he does something as stupid as cry. He lets himself out of the room where the archangels and the demon are waiting, the humans loitering in the doorway behind them.
? The archangel and the devil?"
Castiel nods takes Dean's elbow again, and they move on.
"Jack, take a breath," Castiel tells the teenager with a chuckle, catching Dean's eyes and rolling his own. The urge to kiss him does not go away, at all.
want Benny or Castiel or
“Oh god, I’m gonna do that to you next time, I think I came my brains out.”
He stops then, shows Castiel the rope and says, “Where you’re going wrong here, is you’re either pulling this loop too far, or not far enough.” Dean takes hold of the bight and flips it over the second piece of rope before pulling both ropes until the loops form a knot. “See?”
"You doing alright? Freaking out?" Dean asks Castiel, turning to face him and settling into the corner of the couch. Castiel's only answer is an easy shrug, but despite the little time they've really spent together, Dean knows him well enough to know he's worried, even without having to smell him. "You can say no, keep your memories locked away."
Dean sits up instantly, his brain short circuiting. "Uh…"
Dean chokes on his spit and heat burns through his body. He thinks Benny might have been worried that he got there first despite Dean being first in, and that Dean might be mad, but he isn't, in fact he replies with,
Dean makes an ugly choking nose, Castiel must take pity on him, because he says, "Benny was only telling me that your freckles - rousseurs - extend well past your face. And before that, he'd been teasing you about the way you flush - rougir - down your entire body. Cul means… well it's a rather vulgar term for someone's rear."
"Shit," Dean rushes over to help him, kneeling down to stuff the clothes back into the box while Castiel stares at him in utter confusion. "Sorry about that, man. I didn't mean to startle you."
“Agent, it’s Sheriff Vaughan, we’ve found another body, I thought you and your partner might want to come take a look.”
Castiel laughs, and is just about to speak when the waitress approaches them with the pasta, setting it down in front of each of them once they've moved their empty plates. She takes the dishes and another order of drinks before she walks away. "I've a baba - a grandmother - in Russia, some cousins, we visit sometimes, otherwise it's a toss up between Florida and California for summer vacation, Claire likes Florida and Jack likes California."
“We can find somewhere to eat and come back?” Castiel suggests.
"Hey, I lied to you before, about the touching thing. I know I said some people are just like that, and I mean they are but-"
The sky shining in from the lip of the cave has begun to go pink and orange with sunset when he finishes, skin and slices of meat hung up on drying racks. The raven's been eyeing the entrance almost nervously and he doesn't have long to wonder why when the sky finally goes dark.
Rowena's left the TV on for them, and though it's mostly in Dutch, daytime soap operas follow the same storyline no matter which country they're from. One of the shows that starts broadcasting around midday is very similar to a show Dean was obsessed with when he was a teen living with Tasha, Max and Alisha: Dr. Sexy. It was crap, utter trash, but he loved it anyway. Max would often joke that the same guy (Dr. Avery Bacic, the main character) was the reason for both his and Dean's sexual awakenings and Dean honestly can't deny it.
“The third man hurt Ollie, he hit him on purpose.” The eldest looks back at Dale and Ollie again then, wincing. “And the fourth…” he doesn’t say else for so long that Dean wonders if he’s going to say anything at all. “She tried to yank Ollie off the street, managed to get him in a car before Ollie lost control.”
Once the box is full once again Castiel lets Dean help him get it into the trunk of his car. "Hey, I'm sorry about your mom by the way."
"Can I kiss you?"
"Yeah," Dean replies, squeezing his hand around the steering wheel. "Yeah, me too."
Dean sends him the rolled-eyes emoji and the middle finger before climbing to his feet to get the clothes out of his closet, laying them on the bed. Benny replies not long after Dean has pulled on his briefs.
“She was a social worker.”
Castiel's heart is hammering in his chest and he's trying to decide what to say next when Dean speaks again.
Dean turns to Castiel again. "Michael and Lucifer."
The sun sets at five thirty and Castiel shifts into his human form. With all of Rowena's things packed, they set out through a portal that lands them in the middle of a spacious living room where six women are waiting for them. Dean knows which woman is the dreamwalker and which is the psychic the minute they land: one smells like magic and unfamiliar worlds and the other smells like power. The two older women in the room smell like gunpowder and are dressed in sheriff uniforms, while one of the younger women is dressed in hospital scrubs and smells like blood, death and antiseptic solution. The last of the women smells like gunpowder as well, but she doesn't hold herself like a cop does, so if Dean didn't know any better he would label her as a hunter. He decides to keep his eye on her. Underneath the gunpowder, blood and power they all smell like trepidation and fear.
Then, after he's turned the shower on he texts Castiel again,
One of his hands has disappeared, and when Castiel cranes his neck to look down at him, he can just see it squeezed around his cock. It isn't moving, and he realises that Castiel like this, with his body open and on display for Dean is affecting him so much he's worried he might come too soon, and that makes his own cock give a throb.
With a rush of Castiel's angelic power they're suddenly clean and Dean collapses back onto the bed, knees bent awkwardly around Castiel's legs, and huffs out another quiet laugh, panting for breath. He flings an arm over his eyes and moves his legs away from Castiel (without kicking him in the face), planting one foot on the headboard, the other leg flung out over the side of the bed.
Castiel slaps a hand to his face and groans, and Dean bursts into laughter, a flush taking over his cheeks.
"Hey," he whispers, catching Castiel's attention but also careful not to wake Benny. Castiel turns around to look at him, smiling gently. "Where are you going?"
Dean groans when he realises that Castiel is going to drag this out as much as he possibly can, because he's an asshole. "Fuck, Cas, there were two in Montana."
Benny, the son of a bitch, comes first, thrusts becoming erratic and harder, going deeper until he stops and spills into Dean with a moan of Dean's name. At least, rather than standing there, fucked out and oversensitive like Dean's had some guys do, he pulls his cock out and shoves three of his fingers inside.
Dean stumbles his way out of bed, sliding his hand against the wall as he approaches Jack’s cot. He feels unsteady and dizzy, and his vision is blurry as he reaches for the blanket in the cot with a shaky hand, pulling it aside.
Dean has this weird feeling he's seen her before, and when he realizes where from, he feels so angry he thinks he might explode, or spontaneously shift. She's the woman who sold them the crib in the Bolivian flea market. She'd been watching them.
more. He slides his body over Castiel's and settles on top of him, licking into his mouth and groaning when he feels Castiel's body react to the closeness.
"I don't trust the Coven by themselves, and I don't trust my son to watch them. The humans won't be strong enough," Rowena tells them, shaking her head, a glass appearing in front of her with a flick of her wrist. She pours herself some whiskey and taps at the glass with her nails before she drinks it. "I'll do my best. Plan B, you come back here and he'll follow you, and I'll do it then."
Dean does, happily, leaning up to plant one on Castiel’s mouth before Castiel climbs out of the tray.
Claire climbs to her feet and says, "Sorry, just one thing. I'm still trying to wrap my head around you being an angel."
Dean’s third indication comes when he opens his eyes and finds himself in a tent, rather than in his bedroom in the bunker. And he’s not alone. There’s another figure on the other side of the tent, asleep under a pile of blankets, nothing visible but tufts of straight blonde hair.
' It's usually enough to get the information I need."
"Alright," Castiel replies, nodding his head. He's trying to figure out how to bring up the things he wants to say to Dean, the things he's been feeling for far longer than he'd care to admit when Dean interrupts him.
-*-*-
“I love you too, baby,” Dean says gently, pressing a kiss to Castiel’s forehead as he reaches over for his phone on the bedside table. “How long?”
"I was just protecting myself! You can't fault me for picking the winning side!"
"Before the Men of Letters locked him up, he willingly went to them. And he's being crazy shifty." Dean gives his brother a suspicious frown, screwing up his mouth. He hadn't noticed Crowley being shifty, but then again. "You and Cas wouldn't know what's going on around you if the house were on fire. You have an extremely unhealthy attachment to each other, and it was worse with Jack."
"I knew that," Castiel says, though he didn't. "Yes, we can go on a hunting trip."
gut), so he pulls the car over again.
"So, you, Benny and my dad…" Dean was waiting for this, but he was sort of hoping he wouldn't have to be involved in the conversation. He shoots her a look and nods so she knows to continue. "Just so you know, it was pretty obvious, from the moment we got here. So, none of you are very good at keeping secrets."
Castiel does, planting his hands on Dean’s chest and sliding up before slamming back down again, drawing a grunt from Dean’s mouth. Dean likes absolutely everything about sex with Castiel, but this? Watching Castiel above him, taking his own pleasure from Dean? This is Dean’s favorite. If he didn’t like getting his brains fucked out by Castiel and his monster dick when he’s in one of his
Dean at least has the decency not to draw it out this time, fucking in and out of Castiel until Castiel’s body is shaking with his steadily growing pleasure. He squeezes Dean’s hands and arches his back so Dean’s cock brushes up against his prostate on every stroke.
He… he
, exists in this world. If archangels and angels exist. If demons, werewolves and vampires exist.
“Lent to you. Though I dunno man, they’ll probably turn up eventually,” Dean tells Castiel, shrugging his shoulders. “I gotta go shave. I’ll keep an eye out for you, buddy.”
motion. "I'm fluent in Czech, and not terrible with Russian on a good day, but I could barely manage a conversation in Serbian. I'm fluent enough in German to hold a conversation, but only because I chose to take it as an elective in college."
Castiel's cheeks flush darker and he slides out from under Dean, leaning over the bed to open the bottom drawer of the bedside table and coming back with a bottle of lube. "I found it in the bathroom, but I don't even want to think about that right now."
"Crowley?"
. He looks back up at Bobby and goes to ask him while he'll need it, but the older man interrupts him before he can, "It won't kill Lucifer, but it'll stun him, buy you some time." He reaches back into the bag and pulls out a knife with a serrated blade and an antler handle, words in a language Dean doesn't recognize carved into the steel. He flips the knife so he's holding the dull edge of the blade and hands it to Sam. "Demon blade. Stick 'em with the pointy end in any and all major arteries."
"Speaking of horny, fuck and public," Benny begins, which only serves to make Dean worried about Benny's next words. He turns the exasperated look into one of worry and mild threat and levels it on Benny, who only shrugs it off. "You didn't put out on the first date, cher. Who are you and what have you done with Dean Winchester?"
"Sam isn't. Eileen can occasionally initiate physical contact, but certainly not to the extent that you do," Castiel says. He wrings his hands - a nervous gesture he has begun noticing in himself since reclaiming his humanity - and then bites his bottom lip with the effort to keep his hands still. "I enjoy your touch, Dean."
Dean nods his understanding. “I don’t blame you, I would’ve killed him too. The third and the fourth?”
They're sent back into the car with the woman in the passenger seat and a man in the back with Castiel and Emma. Their two new occupants don't speak, so Dean, Castiel and Emma don't either.
Dean snorts. No, he wouldn’t have. “So, unless the flowers came from somewhere else, we’re probably looking for a graveyard with Baby’s Breath.”
“Lucifer ganked him years ago.” Dean collapses into one of the folding lawn chairs set up around the burnt-out fire. “What the fuck are we gonna do, Cas?”
After dinner and once Sam has washed the dishes and Eileen has put them back in their place, Dean announces to the kitchen that the Impala hasn't been out for some time and that he and Castiel are going for a drive. Castiel doesn't mind that he wasn't consulted, he enjoys spending time with Dean no matter what they do. When he turns to look at Sam and Eileen, Sam is undisturbed by Dean's announcement, however, Eileen shoots Dean a grateful look.
"Go take this into the kitchen, I'll be in in a second." He hands Jack a tinfoil covered dish. Jack seems happy to go, but Claire gives them a
Lucifer and Michael delve into an argument in another language, presumably Enochian, the same as Castiel had spoken when he summoned the two. They're bickering like normal brothers would, and it's even more amusing than Castiel as the snotty little brother. Two celestial beings sniping at each other like children is hilarious.
He's just made a second one when Claire stumbles and steals it out from under his nose. He laughs and finds himself another mug to make himself a new one. "You feeling alright?"
Benny fits a second finger inside Dean and scissors them apart, spreading Dean's body open. Benny crooks his fingers and they catch on Dean's prostate, tugging a groan from deep within Dean's chest, a groan he breathes into Castiel's mouth. Benny fingers Dean for what feels like hours, fitting a third finger inside Dean when he's stretched enough to take it.
Dean covers his dick with lube and gets between Castiel's thighs. "Okay?"
"None taken," Castiel replies honestly, nodding his head. He's pretty much in agreement. This is quite possibly the stupidest thing he's ever done. "Is this the secret you guys have been keeping from me? Did you all know?"
"What kind of lesson?"
"Everything alright?" Dean asks, turning around and resting his arm over the back of the seat to look at Benny.
"Yeah, okay."
"Why are they coming after you, Rowena? How do they know where you are?" Dean asks, when he's finally done. He's still holding Castiel's wrist, but he doesn't let go when he realises. "You've been hidden for forty years, Rowena, how did they find you?"
They wait for hours until the rising sun begins to shine through the stained glass windows.
Dean laughs. "Yes, I am."
By the time he's finished with all four hubcaps neither Benny nor Castiel has reacted yet, so he stands in front of Baby's hood, his back to the two men for just a moment, trying to think of something that will make them move. The last thing he has to do is polish the Impala's chrome, so instead of kneeling down while he does the grate, he leans over, hand planted on Baby's hood, and polishes it with a cloth.
Castiel nods his head and picks up his burger.
"Benny, we were going to go out on a date."
Sam rolls his eyes and says, "Look, it wasn't my idea, okay, but I didn't say no. There was a
The glow of the archangel's eyes doesn't waver, and the smug look on his face proves that he's doing it on purpose - to prove his power, probably.
Dean wiggles his fingers before shaking his head no. “All good, I’ll tell you if there is.” He tilts his head so he can look behind him, smiling stupidly at Castiel. “Love you Cas.”
So Dean very gently wakes Castiel by shaking his shoulder and says, "I'm going to kiss you again, that cool?"
The woman brings them their food and drinks out on a tray and sits down in front of them with her arms crossed over her chest. “I met a woman named Olivia Lowry in 2003 when I was fifteen and my best friend had just gone missing.”
Emma snorts. "Cryptic much? Well, when you've 'figured it out' feel free to have make-up sex somewhere far far away from me."
Dean grins and pats Castiel's leg again. "Good. I sent the kids to see to a vamp in Cedar Rapids, but Sam found a haunting in Wyoming so I'll send them there and we'll take Iowa. If we leave in the morning we'll get there by noon."
Castiel steps up between his thighs, and Dean grins at the dark red flush on his cheeks. He leans forward and pulls Castiel into a kiss. "If either of you get any bodily fluids on my baby, that's it. I'll be withholding sex from the both of you, and you'll be cleaning her, got it?"
"You did?" Dean asks, pulling Benny's soft dick from inside him, and leaning up on his elbows. After Castiel had gotten back from Seraph, he'd had a conversation with the university's dean that left him angry and desperate to leave. He'd sent his CV out to other universities looking for someone in the Paleontology department, including an open teaching job at Idaho State, which was four hours away, a job as the head of the research department at the University of Montana, which was two and a half hours away and a teaching position at Montana State,
The daughter he couldn’t save. The one he never wanted but regrets losing. The daughter he only ever thinks about when he’s so drunk he can’t even stand.
“Yeah.
Castiel's eyes go wide and in the darkness, Dean can just see his cheeks redden. "Are you- you don't have to-"
"How did you? Learn who you were, I mean."
He and Benny make up their Chillo's date on the following Friday. They know just about everything about the other now, that instead of doing a normal get-to-know-you first date they spend the entire night people watching, and coming up with increasingly ridiculous stories about each person. As they're paying, Dean leans down to whisper in Benny's ear about the couple at the table closest to them. One of the two women, with bright red hair, is breathtakingly beautiful and also massively pregnant, and Dean tells Benny that Ariel got wise and dumped prince Eric's ass for Vanessa, which makes Benny burst into laughter.
Dean gives her a grin, sharp like needles and says, "I was hoping you'd say that. Now I get to eat your heart out of your chest."
Jo makes a disgusted face at Dean and says, "Ew, don't talk to me." She then turns to Benny and Castiel, like she's going to ignore him, and while Benny knows Jo, and her and Dean's weird friendship, Castiel doesn't, and he looks unbearably confused.
Dean wipes a hand down his face, hiding his eyes behind his fingers. He really hopes she hasn't said that in front of Sam yet.
Castiel looks at Dean like he's the biggest dumbass on the planet, one he's entirely too amused with, and Dean's chest clenches. "No, Dean," Castiel says, rolling his eyes.
“Are you trying to get us killed? What the fuck is wrong with you?” Emma hisses, slapping her empty hand over Dean’s mouth.
Dean's brows knit together and he mouths
Claire sits up a bit straighter, eyes narrowed on Dean. "It doesn't start."
much.
Dean salutes the man and climbs to his feet, taking his tools and rag, leaving the tools on the bench and taking the rag to wipe his hands while he goes out to the parking lot. Castiel's sitting in the driver's seat of his car with his legs outside of it, planted in the gravel. He's staring up at the sky with his hand held over his eyes to shield them from the bit of sun peeking through the clouds.
Castiel laughs and disappears from the camera's view for a moment, coming back with a pair of briefs on and a can of soda, taking a sip. It occurs to Dean that he wouldn't be pulling their legs as much as he is unless it was something he knew they were going to be happy with. "You got the job at Montana State didn't you, you asshole?"
Josephine's jaw clenches again, and her cheeks are red like she's embarrassed, like she has absolutely anything to be embarrassed about. "He made a comment about waiting til I got off for the night."
Gabriel shoots Sam a wink on his way past and Dean pretends to gag.
Castiel’s mouth tilts up into a broad smile and he raises an eyebrow at Dean. “Needy. I am paying attention to you, just not your face.”
, but you never know. It might be the one time we get lucky."
He has to wash his hair, because he didn't do it the last time he took a shower and his hair feels like it's glued together with gel and sweat and probably a little bit of grease, and it's disgusting. Sam would joke about Dean being a 3-in-1 kind of guy when they were in their twenties and he would buy Dean shampoos and conditioners because he was a shit. Dean will never tell him that he actually liked one of the brands he'd bought and he'd been using the same thing for ten years. Sam would act like an ass - Moreso than he already does.
Angels are hidden because they don’t even bother trying. The extremely rare visitation had simply done its business and moved on. Unconcerned and unmoved by the power plays and feints and games. Sure, they have their own games now, but that is a corruption. It is a leaking of humanity into the warp of them. Finally. After millenia.
Castiel finally relieves the growing tension with the barest hint of a smile and that deep warm voice “Hello, Dean” and suddenly everything is so much better. Cas had used his actual name. He hadn’t called him “Mr. Winchester”.
Because the night always comes
“You heard your soul song for the first time a month ago and you didn’t tell me!”
Dean spills Castiel onto the bed and almost immediately misses holding the weight of him. If his lover wasn’t six foot of tight lean muscle he might have made a way to hold him against the wall for much longer. It scratched some basic need to feel Cas’ weight bearing down hard against his body. The solid press of him is more real and bruising and heavy than the women that Dean had been with before. It was a drugging high to feel his body flexing and burning and taking the brunt of weight. He immediately wants the pressure back, so he rolls to the side and falls to his back on the bed. He reaches to tug Castiel's sleeve and invite the Omega to get on top of him.
“Mr. Winchester, we strive to keep our clients happy and we have to inform you that Ms. Novak has fallen ill. We are very lucky that our family is in business together and so her son, Castiel, has offered to take on her responsibilities while she recovers. We know that you are scent sensitive (Dean has to keep from whimpering at the mention of his heightened sensory needs. Fuck. Cas is just standing there looking at him!) And so we think that the familial scent similarity will make him a good replacement for your home. We wanted to stop by today so that you can tell us if his scent is acceptable.” (If only this guy knew how goddamn acceptable his scent is. Fuck. How is he going to keep from popping a boner right here in his front yard?)
It's so beautiful that Cas forgets to be embarrassed for a minute to take up his staring. The timid quiet scent of comfort that had been softly building in him flowers suddenly into fuller life and the rich bloom of vanilla fills the space between them. Happy Omega.
Castiel and his dazed companion only make it to the parking lot before chaos strikes. One wild eyed vessel shining with celestial intent slams into the concrete followed by the sonic complaint from nature and the screaming whistle of flying debris. Immediately Castiel arches his great wings to shelter the mortal that is screaming and trying to somehow climb and pull the immobile angel away at the same time. Gabriel is arming himself and casting about for the adversary. "Casti- uh. Where is the fight? And. Is that a human wrapped around you?"
They were trapped!
Dean thinks about Garth and his sweet wife Bess for the rest of the day. It's not like Dean doesn’t believe in soulsongs. In fact, as a kid he had been sold on the idea so much that he had obsessively plunged into a passionate love of music. He listened to hours upon hours of the classics. His taste ran to rock and the truly magnificent roots of blues and Americana. His music was as much a part of his soul as that classic car and his closet full of flannels. As he got older though, pragmatism had set in. It was a lot like Astrological signs or Tarot readings. All very speculative and some folks really obsessed with the implications of every detail in the song they felt resonating in their being. After meeting Garth though, he was encouraged. Not everyone had to be so damn serious and sometimes loving somebody can be as light and silly as “hammertime”.
"This witch, Crowley, he's been removing people's memories and sending them to people like us. We smuggle supernatural beings like you guys into countries where the Men of Letters don't have a foothold." Donna sets her elbows on the table and rests her chin on her hands. "We don't know why he's doing it, but we know he's doing what he can to help."
during the day. She had.
He must say it out loud because Benny reaches forward to pinch his hip before rolling the condom over Dean's cock.
Dean thinks about it for a second. He wants to be able to sit down afterwards and still feel it, but not enough that it makes sitting for long periods of time difficult or maybe impossible. “Two.”
They laugh at him, and he ignores them in favour of his burger and fries, eating his lunch as passive-aggressively as he possibly can, shooting them glares every once in a while.
, twice. They even play a four-hour-long game of
Castiel takes a moment to reevaluate everything he's seen Eileen do over the last few weeks before he blurts out, "Eileen, are you pregnant?"
Dean opens his eyes and looks up at Castiel, a small smile on his face. His eyes are so green and so bright, and Castiel imagines he can almost see the man’s soul again, so bright and beautiful. “Fine, Cas. Sam and Eileen were at it again.”
. (Castiel’s choice. Dean concedes to him when Castiel kisses him stupid.)
He goes through several emotions over the next few seconds, first confusion and then relief, happiness, sadness, before finally landing on rage.
"Dean," Castiel moans, wrapping his legs around Dean's hips, tight, heels digging into Dean's back. "
"Jesus, Bobby. Cas!"
Castiel looks back at Dean and rolls his eyes. “I’ve not been ‘missing’ sparring sessions, I just don’t spar with you, Dean.”
"Hey, we'll eat on the couch, watch a movie. Don't tell your mom and dad."
When it doesn't look like Gabriel has any plans to continue, no intention to explain what the third option is, Castiel continues for him. "A Ma'lak Box. It's a coffin warded with sigils powerful enough to hold an archangel. The instructions to make the box, however? Missing for centuries. Theoretically, someone still holds the instructions, but-"
Dean eyes them as they get closer, trying to decide what to say when they take the tape off. If they take the tape off.
has wreaked havoc. The infected are commonly known as grinders, I suspect due to the motion they exhibit with their teeth, however, you would call them zombies. I have seen no evidence of others since finding myself in this body and this world. I was unaware you had sired progeny, Dean.”
"He is not
"Uh, well, sometimes, ye-" Dean's interrupted when Castiel falls into his lap and kisses him.
After a moment, when Dean thinks he's finished and he's about to turn back to Benny and continue on with what they were doing before Castiel texts, the man texts again.
"I probably should've mentioned that she's a hugger," Dean says with a chuckle, watching Jo squeeze Castiel's head into her chest and kiss his hair. "Alright Jo, enough, don't smother him."
"I… It's my name?"
"Dude, did you ever stop to think it might have been Crowley?" Sam asks, shooting Dean a look that screams
"You might want to take a vacation some day, see the world."
Dean chokes on the spit in his mouth, rushing to nod his head vigorously. A wide grin splits Castiel’s face and he climbs off of Dean’s legs, sliding off of the bed - likely to get the lube and condoms. He pulls the drawer open that holds the items and takes them out, stopping before he shuts it. Castiel stares down inside it, his mouth morphing into a slight smirk.
"Hey Kaia, Claire."
Castiel's face softens and he nods his head. "Yeah, Claire's eighteen and Jack's fifteen. And the girl you were walking with, your daughter?"
Castiel snorts and says, "Of course that's what you take from this. Besides, I'm not an angel anymore, and I have no plans to change that anytime soon." He elbows Dean gently in the side and smiles at him.
The man shakes his head and picks up an onion ring, eating it with all the vigor of a starved man. Dean shakes his head and turns around to serve a woman farther down the bar before going back to Charlie and leaning into the window to whisper conspiratorially to her. "What's with the tax accountant?"
Dean grins sharply at the angel and whispers, so quiet only Castiel as another supernatural creature can hear him, "Because my need for food is outweighing my need to climb onto your dick right now. I love you too, you fucking dork."
Castiel sits himself in a high-backed chair in front of her, eyeing Patience nervously as Dean steps up behind him and puts a hand over his shoulder. It's for comfort, for both of them, but also so he can pull Castiel away once she's done and before she brings the potion back up.
Castiel's hands shove down Dean's briefs, letting them fall into the puddle at his feet with a
Charlie shoots him a look, "Hell if I know Dean, he only just got here, go ask him yourself."
Dean tells her the whole story, not sparing a single detail, watching as Rowena's face falls and her perfectly manicured eyebrows knit together. She's no longer angry. Instead, she's trying to keep the horror in her eyes from her face."Fuck, Dean. Fuck."
Dean snorts. "You're telling me," he moves to stand next to Castiel, leaning against the cot and resting his chin on his hand. "I never realized how boring little babies actually were. All he does is eat, sleep, and shit." At Castiel's own snort and rolled eyes, he continues, "The twins were like… five months when I went to live with Tasha."
"He's with that Benny dude, didn't you hear dad?" Claire says, still staring at her phone. Dean wonders what on her phone is so interesting that she's barely taken her eyes off of it for a second. When he barely takes his eyes off his phone it's because he's texting Castiel, Benny or both. So… partner or crush.
“Love you too,” Castiel replies, leaning over to kiss Dean’s temple. When he pulls back he reaches his hand up and threads his fingers through Dean’s hair, tugging his head back.
Dean groans loudly, moving his plate forward and bracing his arms on the table, hiding his face in them. "I'm never sleeping with you again." He mutters, angling a kick to Benny's shin under the table, only feeling minutely better when Benny swears. When Dean looks over at Castiel, his eyes are wide, and he's blinking a lot, like he's trying to process what's just been said. "Please, for the love of God, ignore him. He thinks he's funny, he's fucking not."
"God, Cas, please. Get your fuckin' clothes off." Castiel pulls away from Dean, the hands he had on Dean's hips replaced by Benny's, though Benny's body isn't pressed up against Dean's. Dean can feel Benny's knees on the back of his calves and realises he's kneeling. He lets out a short puff of breath, remembers the last time Benny was on his knees behind Dean, and says, "Fuck, Benny, please. Get your mouth on me."
