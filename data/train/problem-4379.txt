"You called me 'buddy' while trying to confess your love to me," Cas says against his jaw before pulling back to level Dean with the same unimpressed look he's been giving him since the beginning. "I think we're even."
As the jackass DJ (Dean's half tempted to cave and switch to Cas's indie alt whatever, just for a respite) does his quips, Dean stares out the window at the fields and occasional houses whipping past. Home is as out in the sticks as the Bunker ever was, though it's aboveground this time. Home is now a rambler out in the woods, a pocket of suburbia circling the county high school. It's set back a bit: they have neighbors, sure, they get trick-or-treaters, but there's a bit of woods on all sides of the house. Jack loves them because it's "like a story," ready for adventuring; Cas and Dean love them because it's a hell of a lot easier to hide warding there than along someone else's abutting rose bushes.
"Are you alright?"
(His hair
Well, louder music, a lethal amount of booze, and almost nauseatingly blinding smiles. It's not that different from before, to be honest, but it works; though the hour drags on, no one makes a move for uneasy sleep. Dean and Jo's mania keeps the booze flowing and well-worn war stories keep the conversation doing the same. Cas especially, weirdo that he is, supplies an infinite amount of amusement. He and Bobby discuss Sumerian syntax, Sam gets to grill him about Biblical inaccuracies, Jo pierces his ear, and they finally figure out how to get him drunk, all to the tune of
Hannah jolts to a stop, annoyed, and based on a cursory glance it's not winning him any favors with a couple other angels, but...
"Dunno if that first one's really a compliment, but okay," Dean mumbles to hopefully mask the heat coming off his face. It's probably no use with Cas's angelic senses, let alone their proximity, but hey, points for trying.
Dean glances over at Cas, staring up at the stars with quiet contemplation, and looks: really looks, like he never lets himself do. It should be weird, Cas in stereotypical hunter gear, but it isn't. He's still Cas, straight backed and windswept and weirdly intense. Yeah, it's all more sex hair than his usual "just rolled out of an interdimensional tornado" look, and Dean can't look at his face anymore without mentally replaying the exact moment his orgasm shuddered through him, but he's still too Cas to mistake, a little alien dude sitting there in Dean's jacket and staring at the sky like he remembers every second of its creation. Even the amulet hangs oddly like how his tie always does. Even the earring—Dean forgot about that. He looks... right.
"You're lucky I rebuilt you from scratch when I pulled you out of Hell," Cas says, nowhere as serious as the words should be. "Otherwise you'd die of heart failure within the year."
"I didn't think anything could," Cas replies with a faint vacancy that Dean knows well: the sound of resignation to a fate pulled from under his feet, the disorientation of going from hopelessness to a win without the time between to think
But. It's the look in Cas's eyes. It's the fact that they'll probably die in a few hours. It's the familiar cradle of Baby's leather that feels brand new under his hands. It's the solidity of that same hand shifting to his cheek, thumb pressed to his lips.
"I'm just glad it worked," Sam says.
working, he's slightly horrified to find.
"Of course."
He didn't know he was missing it 'til he had it: someone who gets
Cas pretends to think about it for a second, the corner of his mouth barely upturned. "I prefer the word 'trusting.' Less dumb. Less ass."
"Did he," Cas says, carefully flat but still with a hint of... hope? Interest? Wariness? Dean can't tell, even though Cas is looking at him the entire time. Were his eyes always this blue? Was his gaze always this soft, and Dean never noticed? He must have, but he can't remember when right now, because as soon as Dean realizes it's his turn to talk, his whole brain turns to white noise.
, and Dean doesn't flinch when Cas's other hand lands briefly on his forearm and squeezes back. Their eyes don't meet, but they don't need to.
"Hey kiddo—" Dean cuts himself off to hop back in quick, "
He doubles back to flip him off but doesn't linger long enough for Sam to notice he's wearing his favorite henley because, unfortunately, he's right. Dean is going to visit his boyfriend at work, like some kind of normal person. Granted, his boyfriend is an angel, his work is a ragtag heavenly militia squatting in a power plant, and Dean's visiting to drop off some magic books from their secret society bunker-house, but still. Visiting his boyfriend at work.
And then Cas is crawling his way into the backseat, Dean sliding back uselessly as his brain struggles to keep up with his dick. His back hits the opposite door as Cas gets a hand on the front bench to loom over him properly, eyes ravenous on Dean's body, his other hand on Dean's knee. The incidental but numerous places they are touching otherwise have nothing on this hot brand of intent.
Once Dean has his shirt on, flannel collar soft and worn against his neck, he shoves his feet back in his boots and opens the door without a word.
(The fact that said militia is camped out an hour and a half away is no matter; Cas comes back to the bunker whenever he can too, even though it takes him as long to get places as any human schmuck now. Dean called it his commute once and Cas just smiled. They're on the same page about this stuff.)
As Cas works his way back down Dean's neck, Dean floats, weightless in the sensation. He's so hard it hurts, his head keeps bumping the window handle, and his mouth is probably still running, but none of it matters in this state. There's always been a part of him with an ear trained for the door, never fully able to let go with even the best of lays, but Cas is different. (He says that a lot, doesn't he? But it's true.) Dean trusts that Cas will keep them safe, and as much as it makes him sound like a damsel in distress, he does like it. Newsflash, but he likes being taken care of in whatever way he can get it.
Jo's smiling lips are barely keeping in a laugh and Bobby is rolling his eyes, but thankfully Dean gets them out before anyone can say anything more.
Cas's fingers skirt back up to his shoulder, tingling against the palm of the scar as they inch closer and closer to a perfect fit. Dean's no more ready for it now than he was before he knew what could be coming, but he wants it, craves that impossible intimacy, and then Cas gives it to him completely in a wave of awareness.
"I missed you too. I wish I..." He pauses, daring to look at Dean out of the corner of his eye. "Being human by your side would have been nice."
Cas nods solemnly and Dean turns back to cut up the rest of the lime. The sounds from the living room wander into the hallway, two pairs of footsteps on the stairs while Bobby yells up at them. Dean can't quite make it out, but he strains to anyway because the alternative is paying attention to Cas, something entirely too easy.
"Hey, listen." Dean nudges the book pile with his toe for something else to look at. "Sam found a case. Maybe. It's probably nothing but, y'know, in case it is..."
"Keep talking like that and you'll give a girl ideas," Dean says, sirens going off in his head as he does. Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with him? He shuts himself up again with another shot.
, Cas says back in his eyes and his willingness.
"Your sweet love
There's a moment long enough for doubt to creep in before he says, "Oh. My vow?"
Cas shrugs. Whatever he's about to say—if he even
One of Cas's hands lands on his thigh, helping him up onto the table. "I thought we were done talking."
Cas squints, opens his mouth, closes it, and smiles with only his eyes. "That was flirtation, wasn't it?"
He turns to the door. So this will be how it ends, then. At least this time he gets to be the one walking out on Cas.
Cas goes to answer but Dean is too quick, so he stands with his mouth ajar as Dean continues, hands still waving, "I've been racking my brain for weeks, buddy. I stayed up every night looking for a way to get you back, I thought, I—" His voice doesn't break, but it's close. "I was gonna pull you out of the Empty like you pulled me out of Hell, save you the same way you saved me by going there, and it would all make sense without me having to say. I can't— I don't know what to say."
"You can't even get up right now," Dean points out, correctly.
It's not at all what Dean is expecting: deadpan and slightly irritated. He looks back up in time to see Cas roll his eyes with his whole head and continue, "Sorry. Next time I'll remember to take into consideration your abysmal sense of self-worth."
"Sleep well, everyone," Cas says, less like a wish and more like a command. It's kind of sweet nevertheless. At least, Dean thinks it is. You know, quietly, to himself.
"You can also be very irritating," is Cas's response, busy with his belt, but it's not any better when he follows it up with, "but I accept it as part of your charm. Your random bouts of enthusiasm are... nice."
Dean snorts. It's a stupid, wet sound, totally gross, but when Cas's face turns against his ear, Dean can feel that he's smiling. Without pulling out of the hug, he grabs blindly at one of Cas's hands, lacing their fingers together carefully but certain. This, they haven't done. It's nice. Cas's thumb drags up the side of his, then back down, just the once. It feels safe.
Dean, having twisted to make sure shit didn't fall out of his pockets, jerks back to stare at him. "May you what?"
Somewhere between the thoughts about how else not having to breathe might be utilized and the nerve endings in his scalp lighting up when Cas's fingers flex, Dean manages to remember where they are. He has enough concentration to drag Cas out of sight of the thankfully empty living room by his lapel, along the length of the counter and past the fridge, which rattles slightly when they knock back into it. Cas is still attached to him like a lamprey, moving his unwavering attention to the underside of Dean's jaw, which is distracting enough that Dean doesn't notice how far they've slid until he's got the corner of the wall jammed along his spine.
"Dean."
It's definitely his best post-near-death-experience outburst by far, though he gets the feeling Cas'll only let him get away with it this one time. That's fine. He'd be more than happy to never have to go through this whole thing again. He's gotten all he wanted and more.
"Laverne! Shirley! Get in here!"
His smile now is gentle as he reaches up so quietly, so slow that Dean thinks he might not know he's doing it, just as much as Dean doesn't know what "it" is.
Jack looks more steady when he leans back, still in reach. Dean gets that; he can't pull his fingers from the khaki stitches under them. As Dean pushes himself up onto his elbows, wonderfully hard against the wood, Jack keeps rambling. He's talking about the spell now, something about blood and intention and godly power and other things that pale in comparison to the magnitude of Cas sitting on the floor of the library.
They're both laughing by the time Cas gets around to doing just that. Death is miles away.
His words are small and purposefully blasé and break Dean's heart a little all the same.
asking, that's not what Dean's saying, but the rare times they do it's a sort of unpremeditated, heat of the moment thing, impossible reunions and shit. They don't hug for comfort, or whatever Cas is offering now, but at the same time...
Dean drives home with the windows down. It's warm for October and he's gonna enjoy it while it lasts. The brown bags in the backseat (he brought a bunch of those tote bags, but it's never enough) are flapping with the wind, a sweet melody under the oldies station.
"No." Dean shakes his head like he's trying to dislodge an entire lake from his ears. It's the ringing, it's— "Nope, that, uh—" He swallows: spit, bile, dry fucking air, who knows. "You know what? I'm dead on my feet, buddy, I've got no idea what I'm even—"
. He promised he wouldn't let Cas die a virgin, so whatever the angel wants, the angel gets.
(Dean's starting to think he's the one drawing this out, to give himself time to get his shit together, like alcohol's ever helped anyone with that particular problem.)
about what comes next. It seems suddenly selfish to ask for anything more than this; the four of them in one room is so much better than Dean could have hoped for twenty-four hours ago.
"Um." Dean squashes the snide voice in his head that suggests a scrap of notebook paper with yes/no checkboxes. "Do you like me?"
or one of the usual witty rejoinders he's got saved up for times he catches Cas staring at him. His second thought is worse, an echo of the last real thing Cas said to him, but it's true. Cas is beautiful like this and Dean is struck totally stupid by it.
"When I said I love you, in the barn," Cas starts, apologetically slow, and Dean is nodding harshly before he gets two words out.
He does it anyway, if only because Cas has already noticed and Dean doesn't want him to get the wrong idea. Doesn't want him to get the right idea either, because that is... something else, but he doesn't want Cas to think Dean doesn't want to... touch him or whatever.
"Yeah." The words have barely enough air behind them to get out, but get out they do. "Yeah, that's— Hang on."
"Or at least," he amends slowly, "someone should."
"Take care of that," Dean says with a decisive point. He doesn't point out what it means that he's trusting Cas with such a big responsibility, lest Cas realizes how equally big it is that Dean put it on him. God, he watched
"Dean," is all Cas says, but that's all he's ever needed to say, isn't it?
. They can take a minute to hose down Cas's truck. They've got all the time in the world.
Stifling that, Dean deepens the kiss until they're firmly back in his wheelhouse. This, Dean can do. With one hand still flat on the plane of Cas's stubbled jaw, the other slides to the back of his neck, carding through the strands of hair there as Dean tilts them both to just the right angle, mouth against open mouth, sharing air. The toes of their boots knock as they lean against each other, so close that Cas had to wrap his arm around Dean's back, having nowhere else to go. His other thumb is still flat against Dean's wrist, right at his pulse. Dean would worry about it giving him away if it weren't for the fact that Cas could tell anyway.
Ellen and Bobby are definitely exchanging a capital-L look that says
echoing through the barren night.
"Meg, I think," Cas thinks after a moment of consideration. Just when Dean is about to cringingly ask if it's because of a certain demon, he continues, "She reminds me of you."
"You love me too much, Cas," he says, as plain as possible and as tender as a bruise. "And you picked the wrong guy. When are you gonna get through that stupid head of yours that I'm just gonna let you down, man?"
He might be imagining it, but for a split second Dean thinks he feels the arms around him tighten.
. It was truly happening, and Dean thought he might buzz out of his skin. Dean tore his lips away and rested his forehead against Cas’s; Dean went cross-eyed, trying to look at him.
“They were black before, like obsidian. When Jack restored them, they were… this.”
“What is it, Sammy?” Dean grumbled, taking a swig of coffee.
Cas considered that a moment. “Humans have a phenomenon called ‘the six degrees of Kevin Bacon.’ He’s an actor I learned, but the idea is that everyone on Earth is connected by six degrees, or six people. If we start building, say, with the Winchesters, that would lead to other hunters and their families and ancestors. If we kept going, all the souls would eventually be connected.” He frowned. “I don’t know what it has to do with Kevin Bacon.”
Ramblings and warnings located at the end.
“Oh. Alright.” Cas says, cautiously. His eyes dart towards Dean then back to the card box.

“Jesus, not now Sammy!” He blurts out, not taking his gaze away from Cas’ face.
Cas is strolling around the gadget section; there’s a few card stacks, phone chargers, some toys, and a bunch of other useless things that will break within a week of usage. Still, the angel is staring intensely at something in the toy section. Looking in the same direction as Cas, Sam realizes the object of his attention is a box of Uno cards. Switching back to Cas, he corrects himself. He’s not just ‘

Tired of watching these two dance masterfully on their constant merry-go-round of avoided feelings, he switches his own gaze to the road ahead of them and retreats back to his mind. There’s a lot of things in there he could get lost into: Eileen, the case they’re about to work, the latest book he’s read, but the first thing that comes up is the gas station architectural question from 20 minutes ago. So, in a familiar gesture, he flips his phone out of his pocket, and types the request in his browser.
He slowly pushes it open and sure enough, there’s a cot inside, placed against the foot of the bed. Grinning, he hunches over it, hoping to find a sleeping Jack clutching his dino, but… Upon further inspection, the cot in question seems to be devoid of any toddler. Again. Frowning, he turns to the main bed, where he notices the slightest of movements; the stubborn kid must’ve crawled out of his own cot when Eileen left, and climbed into the bigger, familiar one, since she’d placed it so close to Dean’s bed.

Rummaging through his mind for what the next step was supposed to be, he turns to his son:

Then, the feelings of a limp, dead weight in his arms and drenched, reddened clothes on his hands follow, until there’s barely anything left of him, and he has to fight his way out of his own consciousness, raging against a cold, harsh wall of flashbacks. He figured out a way around this, though. It’s easy: it’s called “not blinking ever, at all”. It’s been working great, for the past ten hours or so. Being an angel

Castiel came with such power, his wings spread wide and fluttered. It was as if everything he ever was, ever would be, was spilled into Dean, whose muscles milked him, causing Cas to see nothing but white heat.
angel.”
Cas turned to see the bunker’s map table and two plush chairs waiting for them. Cas hiccupped a sob; the garden felt serene like the Empty, but instead full of life.
Static passed through the garden’s calm breeze, causing Cas to jump from his chair. His grace rattled inside him, on high alert.
“Cas?”
Dean slipped his hand out of Cas’s and rubbed it down his face. He was fine.
“I—I knew what I felt was different. It took a couple years, I think, to figure it out. There was just something about you.” Dean reached out and ran a thumb over Cas’s cheekbone. Cas’s eyes shone just as they had when Billie was banging down the door. “Never felt like that before, gotta tell you, it was kinda a surprise.” Dean let go of Cas and shook out his arms, trying to calm down enough to say what he needed.
All Castiel could do was laugh with delight. “It’s beautiful.”
Cas’s wings sprung, unbidden, from his back, flapping wildly. Dean opened his eyes and made no sound, just watching Cas’s wings flutter as he pounded into Dean, any control long since gone. Dean’s muscles clenched around him, and Cas’s body continued to chase its pleasure.
“Me,” Dean whispered. “The thing he couldn't have, the thing that would make him happiest, was me. He said some bullshit about me changing him, about how selfless and loving I was, how he cared for us, humanity, because of me.”
He left Sam at the motel; they’re on a case in Ohio. When they started hunting again, Dean took to sneaking out after Sam was asleep to escape to the nearest bar. Now he doesn't even bother waiting, merely nodding at Sam and spinning Baby’s keys around his finger as he left. Sam always nods back, shoulders slumped, knowing well enough by now not to ask questions.
Dean pressed his lips to Cas’s, and… that was it. He was done for. It was a sweet kiss, and Dean thought maybe he should check in with Cas, but he couldn’t drag his lips away.
“Of course.” Cas frowned. “I think you may have broken me.” He laughed at Dean’s expression. “In a
“There was no time for Dean to say anything; the Empty took me immediately.”
Dean thrust his hips, and Cas remembered to move. Dean’s body consumed his, and Cas drove forcefully inside him. He took Dean’s knees and pushed them toward his body, allowing him to go so deeply inside Dean, his hips meeting Dean’s buttocks. Dean gripped his own knees, spread wide, allowing Cas the leverage he needed to pump inside him.
“Never forgot. You were that good thing.”
But Cas had said Dean made him into a
Dean smacked Cas’s hand away. “And I suppose that made you feel better. About your decision, about leaving us.”
“Hey, Cas.”
Cas stepped next to him. “Are you waiting for something?” Music and laughter flowed through the bar’s doors. “Sounds like the party has begun.”
“I won’t.”
“Jesus,” Dean breathed, “you’re perfect.”
“Yay, love!” Charlie yelled. The rest of the bar cheered, and the two of them were pulled into the crowd, not separating the rest of the night.
Dean could see Sam running through the plotline of an old WB show in his head. “So what was his true moment of happiness? You guys didn’t—”
“Can I—?” Dean tried to get the words out.
As Dean’s body relaxed, Cas pulled out of him with a satisfied sigh. He fell against Dean, finding himself unmotivated to give Dean any space.
A bright light suddenly filled the Empty, bringing it from midnight to noontime. Cas stood and shielded his eyes as a shape formed before him. He knew it had to be who, or what, had woken him. The form came into focus.
“Dean,” Deirdre says. Dean raises his brows. “What was his name? Your partner?”
He hadn’t left the bunker since. Apparently shit was getting peaceful outside as the hunters left the bunker and tried to reclaim their disintegrated lives. He collapsed at a library table, whisky always attached to his fist, staring. When his eyes were open they didn’t move, when they closed they didn’t sleep. They only saw him, all day. All night. Just blackness eating him, consuming Cas’s smiling face, then nothing. Cas was gone and then there was nothing, only an echo on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean’s eyes widened and met Cas’s gaze. “God, no. Please, I want to see them.” Dean swallowed hard. “I want to see you.”
As John Winchester’s son, it didn’t take long to work out that wasn’t true. Or “normal.” The ladies always made him happy, so why think about anyone else?
here.”
Cas pulled his off his shirt and started on Dean’s obnoxious number of layers. “Is there something in particular you want?”
-Charles Bukowski
Dean cleared his throat. “And the—the wanting something you couldn’t have?”
Dean slid down the bed and wrapped his lips around Cas’s dick and they both groaned. Cas was sweet and tangy on Dean’s tongue. Dean pulled off and then took him deeper and deeper. Cas bucked off the bed, pushing against Dean’s throat.
“Oh.”
“No,” Dean said. “Cas stays. He showed me I wasn’t a monster, that I wasn’t your killing machine. He showed me what I did was for love, not revenge. Not violence for violence’s sake. And if you

. “I’m nothin’ special—loads of kids got a lot worse for a lot less.”
“We are!” Charlie’s laughter relaxed Cas—he hadn’t noticed he’d been holding any tension. “How’s our guy doing?” Cas also hadn’t noticed his eyes never left Dean for long.
“Okay. I was maybe fourteen and had a friend over to do homework. Or that’s what we said; it was convenient that I lived in a motel with no parents and Sam was at a buddy’s house. So, this kid and I, we started fooling around on my bed.” Dean cleared his throat. “Dad was supposed to be gone all week, but he showed up early. He came in, and we weren’t exactly naked, but there was no way for us to get our clothes on fast enough.”
“Jack! What if they need you?”
Jack squeezed Cas’s shoulder and let go. “Sam, Dean, and I did, yes. Chuck’s power is inside me, Amara too. I am the Almighty now and plan on doing things differently. I will not be ‘hands-on’ as Chuck was; I do not care to write myself into the stories of others. My interest is in repairing Heaven, giving our humans a soft place to land upon death, and providing genuine homes for the rest of eternity.”
Cas sat back, surveying the cuts and bruises across Dean’s torso.
Cas nodded. “I’ll be there in a moment; just going to get another drink.”
Dean opened his eyes, Cas’s face swimming through tears.
Cas’s fingers easily fell inside Dean and he instinctively pushed down on Cas’s, feeling like they weren’t enough.
to see him? Was he the same angel Dean saw a year ago? What would Dean even say to him?
“Maybe the Empty’s a fan,” Dean said, managing a small smile.
Dean blinked hard at the ceiling. He’d been trying not to overthink, just let the pain consume him. The pain was his mourning, not dwelling on what kind of relationship they had, that they could have had.
“You would’ve gone to Heaven,” Cas said softly. He put his hand on Dean’s cheek. “You must know that.”
“Dean,” Cas placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder, “I know you don’t feel the same, and that’s fine. I told you, I’m happy that you know.”
for me, I’ll try to listen, I really will. I want… I want to be the man you think I am. You’re not gonna be just a memory for me, you know? I’ll make you proud. I swear I will.”
Dean propped himself on an elbow and looked down at Cas. The angel’s eyes were large and damp.
“Please,” Dean rasped. “Please fuck me, Cas. I need you.”
This creature, this holy being, loved Dean. It was easy to forget just how mighty Castiel was, but these wings…
“Fuck!” Dean came between them, coating his chest. He stroked his way through the long orgasm and Cas’s hips stuttered to a stop as he came. The bedside lamp shattered and Dean heard a whoosh and the shadow of Cas’s wings appeared above him. Cas filled him, hot and sticky.

“I think I’m beginning to hate you.”
“Huh. Well, we can buy one if you want. We could try it out once we reach Twin Falls, in the motel room or something.” He proposes, taking the box off the shelf and fiddling with it. “Haven’t gotten the chance to play Uno a lot myself either, come to think of it, what with the whole ‘hunting since I was a kid’ thing.” He adds, raising one eyebrow, his smile morphing into a disappointed fake-smirk.

You wouldn’t want Baby to get damaged in a crash that could’ve been prevented if you’d just taken a nap, right?” He adds, because he knows his brother so goddamn well, and hot tip: mentioning the Impala getting hurt is one of the only ways you can get him to do whatever you want.

He was already on the bed before he even had time to think, restraining Dean’s seizure-like movements, and pressing his fingers on his forehead, utterly disregarding delicacy this time around. Despite all his efforts, wave after wave after wave of horrors kept pushing away the soothing ones Cas tried (in vain) to stretch over the nightmare. He did his best to let Dean keep his own privacy, and looked as little as possible at the clips slipping out from under his reassuring weaving. The few he

If it’s option d, Dean may have to find a way to explain to Jack why his other dad disappeared suddenly.

He shifts positions on the stage, bringing his knees closer to his chest, like a child carefully getting ready for story-time.
Jack, looking at him with wide eyes and a light smile, nods a few times. Of course he has, young as he is, he’s still aware of a million more things than other children his age are. Obviously.
Oh. Wait a minute. There was something in the book he found…

He opens the car’s door still ruminating his order (just in case he suddenly forgets), and still suppressing the other, more concerning matter of Dean’s current situation. He’s sublimating it, because that’s a matter to be considered with a full stomach, not an empty one (he’s just decided).

That cursed night occurred some time after Sam went off on his own, in 2009. Dean was sleeping alone in a motel room, and Cas had left his post at the foot of the bed for an hour to go watch the sky in a random Oklahoma pasture. He’d discovered at some point a new love for stargazing, and had heard somewhere the stars were often more visible in large empty spaces, like fields. After a satisfactory amount of bewildered staring, his eyes still shining from the light of a thousand dying galaxies, he returned to the motel.

They’re no longer standing in Cas’ doorway, they’re… somewhere else, and Dean (happily) blames the butterflies (thanks them, more like, because he’s never felt this free in his entire life) and is frankly convinced that they picked them up and carried them into the clouds and he doesn’t give a flying (hah) shit that that sounds fucking crazy right now because he’s kissing Cas and nothing else matters.

“Shouldn’t you at least get some breakfast first? Before talking to the officer.” He asks, because that’s a great way to get Dean all to himself (that sounds a bit odd, he’s got no idea why, though) in a diner somewhere, leaving Sam to his research in the motel room, and therefore a great way to interrogate the hunter in detail about what seems to be troubling him.

The scent of brewing coffee fills Dean’s world. Slowly but surely, his other senses follow, gently pulling him away from peaceful oblivion. The well-known texture of bandages against well… Most of his skin, the taste of sleep on his tongue, the sounds of boiling water and voices chattering nearby gradually offer a clearer idea of his surroundings.
As he’s walking through that hallway (has it always been this long? It feels like they’ve been walking for 10 minutes), Cas matching his step, the urge to grab the angel’s hand grows so large he’s almost certain he’s about to do it. Coming to the rescue, a slight tremor makes itself known in his hand, indicating a): oh god he really is about to do it and b): he’s getting second thoughts, thank goodness. That sliver of doubt is enough for him to snap back to reality (aka: this hallway that doesn’t seem to end) and get a hold of himself. Ok, since the length of the corridor is too distracting (read: being alone with Cas is too distracting) let’s focus on the task at hand: delivering the news of a potential case to Sam (and maybe-probably-wait-there-is-laughter-over-there-ok-yeah-definetely-Eileen).

How ‘bout a smile? Surely that’ll work. He slaps on the widest grin he physically can, and even attempts to move his hand out of the blanket swaddle (if this person doesn’t recognize this as a brazen show of unabashed love and thankfulness, he’s gonna bite this someone’s head off. Not an exaggeration.) and although the movement feels a bit shaky, and his fingers a little limp, operation MAFLA (Move-Arm-For-Less-Annoyed) turns out to be a grand success. His hand may be hanging off the bed, lifeless, but it was very much alive a few seconds ago, and very obviously extended towards this Someone. Now he just has to wait.
I also felt as though it was time to introduce some of what I think happened in Dean's backstory, both because I need to — having head-canonned him (it's canon to ME hdjskjh) as trans — and because there are bits and pieces here that aren't discussed in the show, but only seem right.

To a certain extent, the bunker and Eileen brought this type of security back into his life, something he hadn’t experienced since college. Jessica had taught him a great deal about himself, about safety, and about unconditional love, the type that doesn’t rest upon a standard of “give and take”; she’d taught him about loving for the sake of loving. She’d been a role model for him, she lived her life as a bundle compassion and strength, of humor and stubborn will. She was steadfast in her trail and purpose, but she was

can fix my fucking brain!? And I can’t even know how fucking long that could take!? Is that what you’re saying?”
“How’d you know it was me?” Dean asks, surprised, but he can’t stop himself from grinning widely. Jack and Cas have that extraordinary power, getting him to smile in a split second.

“Ok, ok, fine. Mamabear.” She agrees, rolling her eyes. “I’ll even text you a picture every 2 hours, if you want.” She adds with a chuckle. Which means she was probably joking. This is inconvenient, because Dean was about to ask her to do just that. If possible, every 40 minutes, actually. “Oh God. You do??” She gasps, her eyes widening with humor.
“A demon in the bathroom.” Cas cut him off, not even taking his eyes away from Dean.
Dean would probably never admit it in a million years (he does that a lot), but Sam can clearly see relief spreading over his brother’s face as he replies. Gone as fast as it came, a smirk replaces it.
He isn’t sure whether or not the hand is still pulling him upwards or if the ache pulsing through his muscles and his bones and his joints and… Everything, yeah, is just residue
The kiss ends as impulsively as it started when Dean rears back only enough to throw his arms around Cas's shoulders in a toe-to-toe full body hug. This, more than the kiss somehow, is what he's needed for weeks: concrete, unimpeachable proof that Cas is here and not going anywhere. It's more than satisfying even before Cas hugs back, his hands smooth across Dean's back and his ear tucked under Dean's, and then it's better than Dean could have imagined. The air is sweeter from the crook of Cas's neck; Dean fits better in his body when it's wrapped around this man, both of them saved.
"Then quit talking," Dean says before sealing their mouths together again.
Cas's dark eyes narrow on his mouth before trailing up to meet Dean's. "I'd like to see that."
, Dean's the one who was keeping them apart, but it's as much as he's capable of right now without fucking crying again.
"I really don't," Cas breathes against his lips, like that makes any sense. When Dean looks at him in abject confusion, he adds, "Know what they say about flattery."
"I'm great, pal. Aces. How about you?"
"Hey. Uh." Dean jerks his thumb back at the door. "Cas and I are goin' for a drive."
But Cas, of course, being Cas, won't let it drop. He doesn't try to touch Dean again, but he moves closer, closer than he has in a while. Dean has mostly avoided looking at his face thus far, but there's nowhere else left to look, and isn't that always how it seems to go? And doesn't he always seem to be afraid?
), Dean goes right back to staring at Cas, still immobile. Their eyes meet again and Cas must do something, lift his eyebrows or tilt his head a millimeter, because suddenly his expression is enough like "hopeful" that Dean can open his mouth one last time.
Dean hooks his free elbow around his brother's neck as soon as he's close enough. It must be a big day: Sam doesn't even complain when Dean ruffles his hair, just wraps his mile long arms around as much of them as he can. They're a huge ball of limbs at this point, indistinguishable from within, but Dean squeezes them closer for a second to make sure.
"And the truck," Dean says regretfully, nodding at the soap bubbles on the cab roof above them. "Should rinse it off at least. If you let it dry like—"
"Great plan, love the enthusiasm," Dean manages to get out before his brain leaks out his ears, "but how about...?"
, complete with the tantalizing echo of Cas's smite face and drenched hair.
His automatic kissing must not be up to par, as Cas pauses and leans back to look at him.
"I'm really glad you're back, man," Dean says quietly, and it's not right, Cas isn't
"Are we actually leaving?"
"Right, yeah, occasion." Dean's not totally following—though, when he parses the first bit, he has to suppress a wave of mortification—but he gets enough of the gist. "So..."
Yeah, like they don't both know misremembering isn't something Cas is capable of. Dean really wishes they hadn't stopped kissing. "What'd she say?"
"That's—" Cas stops, frowns, like he's only now hearing what Dean said. "Dean. Can I hug you?"
Dean would consider himself good at reading people—a professional even—but he has honestly no idea whether Cas is joking right now or not. It shouldn't be so thrilling, and yet, when Cas finally lets out the hint of a self-satisfied smile, Dean has to lurch up to kiss it. No one's ever been so happy to be played by an angel of the Lord.
Hannah is already glaring when he looks over at her. Hey, she started it.
They don't start out thinking liver damage is the way to beat the Devil. It's just that, once Sam tries to skip out with an "Enjoy your hangovers" and Cas reveals that he could simply heal them all come morning, things get a little out of hand. Dean and Jo become the de facto leaders of morale, salvaging what's left of the mood the only way either of them know how: loud music, booze, and can-do attitudes.
"Dean."
He steps back under the harmonies, knowing if he doesn't he's never getting out of Cas's orbit. Instead, Dean turns to Jack with an authoritative point.
"I mean—" Jesus, Cas has been back thirty seconds and already Dean is fucking this up. "We're even, yeah? You saved my life, I saved yours."
tone, basically — more of an order than a ‘friendly and concerned’ request.
Any trace of the headache is gone, so it must’ve been a good nap, probably quite lengthy. Come to think of it, it may count as a full night’s sleep, if he combines the two.
He says, triumphantly. “I don’t know about you guys, but that’s looking a hell of a lot like a witch’s work to me.” Dean notes, and really wishes Rowena was still topside because she could turn out to be really useful here. “And I’m not a fan of how many deaths happened last time. I mean, human sacrifice is like a power funnel, right? This witch has gotta be a strong one.” Not Rowena-level strong, but probably somewhere around ‘Rowena-would-need-to-actually-prepare-herself-for-a-fight-with-this-witch-level’ strong.
no; any of these would be exhaustingly annoying.
Jumping back into the Impala, the annoying noise of plastic shuffling fills his ears, strange whiplash hitting him without prior notice. He didn’t realize how silent the outside world was until that God awful sound started echoing in the car, and looking around in search of the person responsible for this disturbance, he sees his brother already excitedly reaching for a piece of a pie in one of the two bags. So
Instead of responding, Dean shakes his head and fiddles with the key in his hand, before turning to open the door and stepping in to set up his bags (and probably pick out the most comfortable bed before his brother can argue). Sam is the one to clarify what the two had been chatting about.
. It can’t be all about Jack not sleeping full nights, nor can it simply be about the job. There’s more to it, and Cas is decidedly set on finding out what has been troubling him so much, sooner than later if at all possible.
There,

He stuffs a mouthful of fries down his throat to hide his discomfort, which turns out to be a very ill-conceived camouflaging plan: Cas still squints at him, face as indecipherable as usual. Wow,
“Dammit. It’s just… I still have no clue what he carved into Dean’s back, but since he sounds pretty powerful, maybe there’s some lore on who he is, somewhere. Which, I don’t know, could be a lead of some sort.”
. Like the teenager gazed upon his true form but didn’t cower, kept his head up and dared Cas to do
what they meant.
An idea pops into his head. Since he can’t seem to be able to find out what the letters themselves mean, perhaps another course of action might be preferable. Turning around to face the two other idiots in the room, he clears his throat, pensive.

Getting twitchy at his (very) near presence, Dean nervously eyes him after straightening up, and clears his throat. He’s standing very close. Like, very,

Apparently not.
’ Because it’s twenty fucking degrees Fahrenheit and he doesn’t own a proper winter coat, that’s why. ‘Eh, I’m just a bit cold’. He really is a dreadful liar. Cas frowns, he probably saw right through his subterfuge. ‘
“Well, I heard your footsteps in the hall, then quite a lot of shuffling and standing at the door, and Sam never does that. If he has something to tell me, he’ll walk with a purpose directly to my door and knock immediately. If he doesn’t have anything to tell me, then he’ll simply not come. Your steps were unsure, and then when I didn’t hear a knock, I figured it had to be you. You also tend to check up on me on a whim, without needing any type of clear purpose. Process of elimination, I learned that from those Sherlock Holmes stories, very instructive books.” Cas answers, and Dean’s pretty sure he can hear amusement in his voice, which the light twitch on the side of his mouth confirms.

“Hate to disappoint you, truly do, but I’m nowhere near 80 yet,” He points to his head. “And I’m pretty sure I’m still, y’know, all there, up here.”
Still smiling, he scrambles to his feet, looks at the imprint he made in the snow, and hums a content snicker at the wide wings ephemerally carved into the Allalin’s surface layer. If any madman decides to walk up here within the next half hour, they’ll be surprised to find a trace of Heaven is already waiting for them.
. He can’t figure out for the life of him where he ends and where Cas begins, but he doesn’t really want to know, he’s currently very happy with this arrangement (and damn is “happy” a gross understatement). After… some time (Dean has no fucking clue how long they made out for), they both need to breathe so they reluctantly pull away — both smiling, Dean notes to himself. Hell yeah. He’s not the only one who’s been waiting to do this for a long-ass time.

“Well? What did he say?” He presses him on.
“No.” The fallen angel responds, like an immobile statue.
, they’re on a new case involving cowboy-land. Obviously they have to blend in, but that’s not the whole reason he asked Cas to wear the “absurd hat”. Honestly, Dean’s not quite sure why he did in the first place, he didn’t look too far into that decision, because... reasons. He didn’t want to think about a: why he asked Cas to wear it and b: why he doesn’t want to know what made him think of asking the angel to do so in the first place. These questions are for another time, because right now, Cas is sitting next to him, he has the hat on, squinting at himself in the rear view mirror (how can he be insecure when he looks so- wait no. Not going there. Case to solve, monster to kill, cowboys to impersonate.) and Dean isn’t quite sure how speaking works anymore. Again, no reason.
“Well? What is it?” “I believe it’s ‘

Holy shit. He’s
Mechanically checking up on Dean, he squints to focus on the slow and reassuring rise and fall of the hunter’s shoulders. His slumber doesn’t appear to be disturbed by nightmares for once. Comforted by the thought that Dean’s world must currently be filled with soft dreams and nothing else, he thinks back to the countless hours over the past decade he’s spent watching his charge sleep, guarding the tormented man during those few hours of rest he was sometimes granted.
into the planning or some other crap.” He closes his eyes firmly, almost as if shutting out a painful image. “Which, y’know, kinda sounds to me like this demon’s the one responsible, at least in parts, for last time’s massacre, and for the one that started yesterday.”
Still, Dean has to say something.
"Oh yeah, great, lay it on me!" Dean throws out his arms to demonstrate, ignoring the way his hands are shaking faintly. "Sorry you got the shittiest human on Earth to fall for you."
The truth is he's tired of it. All of it, so fucking tired. Tired of watching Cas fall on every sword in sight, tired of the rollercoaster of terror and relief, tired of the stakes going up and up, the whole fucking rat race. He feels
Their mouths drift toward each other like magnets, falling into a deep kiss, tongues and fully open mouths. A part of Dean wants to protest at the grossness, but it's quickly drowned out by the white hot feeling of Cas's hand, finally, around him, and nothing else exists.
"So don't do anything stupid."
It's only when Dean's hand is a single twitch from Cas's dick, Cas's nose a centimeter from his, that he snaps out of that haze and remembers again what they're doing. Dean wants to deflect from how nervous he is. Because he's not nervous to fuck Cas, he is very excited and has no reservations about this, he tells himself. He's just...
It's only a distraction for so long, though. Sex of any kind always is. Contrary to popular belief, Dean has a lot going on upstairs, and he can't helping thinking about all the ways he could fuck this up. Cas is a flighty son of a bitch, and although he endured all sorts of embarrassment at Dean's hands the last time they tried this "last night on Earth" thing, crippling humiliation has a lot higher stakes tonight. It would really suck to have to track him down wherever he flits off to when he's not hanging over Dean's shoulder before tomorrow happens.
"Alright."
(Sometimes they skip the list entirely and end up sneaking away for a nooner, because if everyone's gonna look at Dean like the boy toy, he's sure as hell gonna reap the rewards. Then he listens to Cas complain about herding angels like cats from where he's draped across his chest, Cas's voice vibrating pleasantly through his skull as he describes Shariel's feud with the printer. Those are good days too, though, he's half embarrassed to say, not de facto better than the rest.)
Jack's sponge lands with a satisfying splat in a bucket of suds as he careens around the bed of the truck. Though he may be adult sized, he still sometimes moves with the self-awareness of a toddler, lurching and flailing gleefully like he's just realized how much mass he has.
"You still have terrible taste, though," he mumbles once he's properly tucked up against Cas's shoulder again, just to be contrary.
Endorphins is right.
Every touch Cas suggests, Dean follows. He doesn't need angelic strength to make Dean putty in his hands, though it doesn't hurt as Cas sits back on his knees, hefting Dean closer until he's splayed across Cas's lap. Lost in the feeling, Dean almost doesn't even notice. It's about anyway: making it good for Cas. That's what he tells himself when he drapes his arms over Cas's back, when he feels Cas pull back to look him in the eye and realizes his hand is down the back of Dean's boxers, jeans gone somewhere.
"Hey." Dean hikes the box up between them, mostly to draw Cas's attention to it so they can get it out of the way. "One set of Enochian spellbooks, as ordered."
Time slips sideways. One second the click of the bottle uncapping is ringing in Dean's ears like a gunshot and the next there are a combined three fingers in his ass, one of which is Cas's while the man in question gnaws at his chin. The rest of their clothes are gone and they're horizontal somehow, Dean spread over Cas like a sweaty blanket. The air in the car is thick enough to choke on, but Dean takes in lungfuls to stave off the imminent pulse of his own orgasm, the tiniest temperature difference enough to distract from the hot breath and hands on his skin.
"Wouldn't want that."
"Uh." Dean's never found the sound of his own name particularly sexy but Jesus, that voice could give anyone a complex. Still, his reflexes prevail and he claps Cas's shoulder as he strangles out, "Right. Guess someone's getting cut off—"
Even when Cas's mouth stops laughing, his eyes keep going, looking at Dean all soft and shit. He didn't know you could miss that: someone looking at you. Maybe you only can if it's someone like Cas and a look like this, fond and knowing but honest too.
He breaks off to look vaguely at the ceiling. "Is something... burning?"
(What happens is that Cas sets his hand on Dean's thigh, fingers gentle on his inseam, which Dean kind of had coming.)
Cas is a great hugger. He's all warm and careful, strong arms that squeeze and hold and... He's a good hugger. Dean wishes he could take credit like he can for a lot of Cas's human skills, but no, it's all him, there from the first time he grabbed Dean and Sam for an intense reunion in a mental hospital (because that's the kind of insane circumstances they have firsts in: dilapidated barns, mental hospitals, Hell). Honestly, he doesn't wish that at all. He likes the parts that are just Cas, under it all, his shitty taste in cars and music and friends. He doesn't like jam and he can't carry a tune and if you let him, he'll hug you so close. So Dean lets him, and he does.
When he starts down the little road to their house, tires smooth on the last bit of asphalt before their concrete driveway, a patch of gravel in front where Sam and the rest park when they visit. It's a little bumpy. A wind must've come through, scattering acorns like salt down the road, and Dean eases off the gas more and more, careful hands on the wheel. Baby's been enjoying retirement: she gets Sunday drives, grocery runs, and a cozy spot in the garage in the meantime. It's just that the bit in-between out and about and safe in bed can get treacherous from time to time. Dean's got dinner tomorrow to prep for, but maybe he'll find time to give her a shine tonight. She's earned it.
"So you said."
. He turns back to the table instead, avoiding Cas's eyes.
At the sound of footsteps, Dean's resolve breaks, spinning him like a top almost right into Cas's chest. Or, not really: Cas is still pretty far on the other side of the room, but it feels like they're nose to nose, the air is so charged.
"Yes." Cas leans into the hands on his hips, his own on Dean's shoulders. At this angle, Dean has to crane his head back out from under the roof to get a glimpse of Cas's face, painted orange by the lone lamppost. "But I have something to say first."
Cas's head tilts, knocking lightly against Dean's before he twists to look him in the eye. "What list?"
Then, between one blink and the next, as easy as tuning a radio, they're kissing. Cas's hands are back in Dean's hair as he tilts him this way and that, leading the kiss deeper and deeper until they're almost fused together, head to toe. Dean's hands slip against the wet car and he almost loses his footing before Cas catches him, shifting until he's basically sitting on Cas's thigh, and isn't that nice? Thoughtful of him.
Unfortunately, what comes out of his mouth is technically not that different, but so much worse sounding that it makes Dean want to disappear inside himself like a turtle in its shell.
It's Eagles, "Take it Easy." Last time Dean heard this was in a bar, Jesus, years ago. A decade? Someone played it on the jukebox and Dean—he was alone, must've been while Sam was at school—Dean leaned further over the bar and said to the handsome barkeep, "You know, this song's about me." And the bartender, who was older than him, huffed and poured him another.
"There's a lotta people in the house," Dean says dumbly.
He feels Cas's fingers flex against his jacket, which a moment later he recognizes as aborted air quotes. Dean would think it's adorable if he could hear past the blood rushing to his face. He's either gonna have to kill Jo or send her a fruit basket. Knife basket?
“What does that mean?” Dean asked, mouthing down Cas’s back while caressing his stomach.
“I never said I was!” Cas backed away, lowering his hands. “You heard Chuck, I’m broken. I’m just as broken as you think you are.”
Cas mojo-ed away the mess and pulled Dean’s blanket to cover them both. Cas pulled Dean to his chest, stroking his hair. In the quiet Dean felt like he was sinking into Cas, that his body was no longer his own and he was fine with that.
“Then look,” Cas said, taking a step away from Dean. “I look like this because of you.”
“John,” Castiel said, stepping closer to Dean, “I believe your son has adequately explained what happened. Dean is the greatest hunter I have ever seen, and sometimes accidents happen. The world is an unpredictable place.”
Cas narrowed his eyes.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so, well, so fucking sad on you.”
Sam snorted, trying to cover up a laugh. Dean glared at him. “I’m sorry,” Sam said, “but it’s just… wasn’t that a storyline on
“Jesus, Sammy,
“Wings,” Dean panted into Cas’s mouth. “I want to see your wings.” He shoved Cas’s trench and suit jacket from his shoulders and loosened his tie.
“I could make them feel better.”
“I need someone to watch over the people here and the throne. You had been brought back as a seraph for a reason, but, more than that, I trust you more than anyone. If I’m going to make things right and explore my new power, I need help. I need you, Cas.”
“Yeah, but not as often. Got my shit together, was interviewing for straight jobs. Knew a gal who knew a guy who knew Bobby, so I was hoping to get hooked up with this body shop. Started working out. Got a dog.”
“Dude, if you can’t bring back Cas, just tell us! Tell us why you’d leave your
Not Dean.
By the time the seed was a bud, Cas had been assisting the Winchesters for a while. He had felt his profound bond with Dean get stronger, tethering him to the human with tighter and tighter binds.
Sam’s chair scraped the floor. “He’s—”
“Harder,” Dean grunted, needing to feel
“You’re telling me you saved the world with

Cas smiled. “You saw Bobby? How is he?”
Dean took in Cas all at once. His chest was tan and strong, leading down to
“No, just my room; I haven’t the need for any other space.”
you, loves you?”
Cas hummed happily as he tasted Dean’s skin. He nuzzled Dean’s armpit, making Dean giggle. Cas smiled at that, and Dean realized he was exploring. He took his time to touch as much of Dean as he could with his strong fingers and tongue. There was no rush; it wasn’t even precisely sexual (though Dean’s dick was starting to think it was). It was, shit, it was reverent. It was careful. It was awe.
Cas didn’t know how long he’d been cloistered—it could be minutes or years. He dreamt before, as a human, but now felt like he awoke from nothing. There were no dreams, but also no pain, no hunger, no thirst. Even now, surrounded by the black and hollow Empty, Cas did not feel afraid. He felt… content. Being in stasis, unaware of his surroundings, was appealing.
rebuilt Dean from scraps scattered around Hell. He wouldn’t be here if it hadn’t been for Cas. And, sure, the “Lord commanded it” or whatever, but any further care Cas gave to Dean had been the angel’s choice. And where had that gotten him? Where did Dean take him except to break his wings, to compromise his grace, to make him so utterly
Cas grabbed Jack in his arms, and Jack immediately returned the hug. “Of course it is,” Cas said. “I am honored you want my assistance.”
“Why? We don’t have to.”
“You’re more than that. So much more. You are so full of love and strength, I’m honored to be in your presence.”
“But… they haven’t prayed to you?”
“Cas is more than just an angel,” Dean said, his spine straightening. “He’s been family to both me and Sam for years. And he’s not a foot soldier. He created this Heaven you’ve been enjoying. He saved the fucking world.”
Castiel rapidly blinked, but his eyes didn’t adjust to the dark; there was only blackness. He sat, feeling around, but found only a smooth floor beneath him. The air was cool and quiet.
“To be with you,” Cas said. “To share our lives. As partners. As... ” Cas’s eyes darted around the trees before landing back on Dean’s. “As lovers.”
They broke apart and Cas studied the floor as if he’d never seen it.
Dean glanced at Cas, who inserted himself into the trio with a quick hug from Mary.
“I’m… I kind of have that connection turned off right now.” Jack answered. “I haven’t spent much time in the throne room, so I haven’t been listening.”
Sam raised his brows. “As in…
“Yes, but—”
Cas stopped Dean’s hand as it traveled over his heart and kept it there. “Dean, we have eternity; there’s no hurry. We’ve never spoken about this before, and I want to know.”
I want, but I know that is all I can have. I’m fine with that, I made peace with it years ago.”
Cas shifted beneath Dean and held him closer. “Me,” he answered softly. “This.”
“Wait, Cas, you gotta—”
“It’s alright,” Cas said.
He had no idea why he had woken, and, if someone woke him up, why he was alone. No mirages of himself or Meg were there taunting him. There was no explanation.
Cas nodded. “Just follow the road.”
Jack brightened. “That’s a great idea! We should get started.”
He was drunk and He was high
“Did you ever, uh, feel any… longing or whatever?”
Cas broke into a gummy smile. “Well, it’s the only real home I ever had, and I wanted a place here, so…”
“That her?” Dean asks.
“Well, that’s just that classic Winchester-having-feelings-dumbass-self-sabotage. I’m sure he’ll come around.”
say. I’m gonna take a shower, wash the floor off.”
Cas smiled. “As are you. Dean, I couldn't have imagined how that would feel if I tried.”
Dean squeezed his hand. “What is it? You didn’t think I’d want you because of your body?”
They watched a beautiful brunette enter the bar and sidle up to Dean. She leaned over, head on his arm, and whispered something in his ear, at which Dean laughed.
“Yeah, and
They walked to a flattened path of earth on the opposite side of the lawn. It was chilly beneath the trees, and Dean thought the sun must’ve finally moved.
Bobby appeared beside Cas. “I’d check on that if I were you.”
Cas slowly unbuttoned Dean’s flannel and pushed it off his shoulders with his jacket. Dean knew Cas had seen him before. Had put him back together, healed him, seen his soul for Christ’s sake, but now there was an impulse to hide.
“I’m not,” Cas said, gently touching Dean’s face. “But thank you.”
Dean smiled and slapped Cas on the shoulder before their arms dropped away. “Don’t know what to tell ya, man. Took a rebar to the back, and that’s all she wrote.”
Miracle turned and licked Dean’s cheeks. Dean chuckled. “Okay, boy, let’s go home.”
“It was nothing untoward; it was purely accidental.”
Sam held up his hands in surrender. “No, but Jack… he told me to ask you about summoning the Empty, said he was there when Cas made a deal, so I’m curious. You’re not the only one who misses him, you know.”
“It’s Heaven—he’s great!” Dean looked around. “Don’t get out much, do ya?”
“‘Fraid so,” Dean said, looking at Cas with a smile. “Best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
“Yeah, me too,” Dean mumbled.
“You do, Dean,” Cas rumbled. “I love you, and that has nothing to do with my being an angel or you being human. It’s about you. You are a righteous man. You kept the entire world safe.”
Dean trailed off, but Sam nodded his encouragement.
yesterday? Did you even go down fighting, or just get stuck on a rusty nail?”
Someone (Dean isn't looking) snorts and Dean rolls his eyes, but judging by the bleariness of the lights overhead, it's got no chance of fooling anyone. When he comes back to Earth, Cas is smiling instead, which settles that: settles everything.

For a held-breath moment, nothing happens. Everyone is frozen: Sam, with a bowlful of burning spell ingredients; Jack, doing something with his residual Chuck energy and the rip in spacetime thrumming in an alcove; and now, freshly fallen from that portal, Dean sprawled across the floor and Cas sprawled across him. How they got there is unimportant in the face of their actually being there. No one blinks, no one moves. The humming planar tension is nothing compared to the strain of
"Cas—"
He manages to make it around to Cas's side before the angel gets too far, though that's absolutely because Cas, leaning against his door, lets him. He slips a bit at the very end when he half steps on a stray bottle, but he manages not to eat shit and lands with a cavalier elbow on the car's roof.
Cas's eyebrows are overwhelmingly earnest as he stares at Dean like he's an idiot. "I might not know much about being human, Dean, but even I know it would be hard to get your jeans off over your boots."
One of Jack's teenybopper friends leans out the passenger window. "Hey, Misters Winchester!"
"I'm not in love with Sam and Mary."
Dean turns Baby's radio off and reaches for the hose. They're taking it easy.
Feet in the gravel, he guides Cas over to stand between his legs. Cas has the same look of half concern he did when allaying Dean's... he wouldn't call them fears, but hesitancies a second ago, though, and studies Dean instead of diving in like he was hoping.
Dean's reminded of that weekend in Maine, the last time they did this doomsday thing, when Cas let Dean fix his tie, mess with his clothes. Cas just lets him move him around like he couldn't pin Dean with a single pinkie. Cas lets his other arm be lifted, lets Dean slide his hands up Cas's sleeves to where he's warm in the crooks of his elbows. Lets Dean bring his clean hand to his mouth until Cas is pushing forward too, taking what he wants the way Dean's been begging for even as he was getting it.
Cas is as unyielding as the day he met, though it's somehow worse now that Dean knows it's not for lack of feeling. "Yes, Dean, your problem."
is even better than
), but they really do know each other too well, because Cas reacts like he saw anyway.
He bursts into laughter. He has no idea why; Cas doesn't say it in a particularly funny way (if anything, he sounds deep and rough and sated, enough to make Dean wonder if it's too soon for round two) and Dean's just remembered they're dying tomorrow. He's still laughing, though.
Apparently blind to his own sexual prowess, Cas squints at the window behind Dean and says, "I don't think two adult men are supposed to fit in the back of this car like this."
It stops him as surely as a hand on his shoulder would have—and believe Dean, he would know. The words themselves (brilliant and confusing as they are) aren't even the worst of it. It's the way Cas says it: suddenly humorous. Like it's obvious, almost funny. Like the idea that Cas could mean that is a total joke. Of course Cas isn't in love with
For what it's worth, Cas seemed just as reverent of the thirdhand scraps, looking up occasionally when Dean walked in and saying warmly, "I like this part," because he could always tell what had been underlined and dogeared by Dean rather than the multitude of previous owners. Dean tries to convince himself that has nothing to do with it. Cas just needed something to do, and raiding the bunker's shelves always inevitably led to Sam wrestling a red pen out of his hand, so Dean graciously offered up his own library, lest Sam draft him into the G.R.R.M. fan club. It's got nothing to do with how Cas probably knew the plots of everything Dean had to offer from his Metatron megadownload but smiled and said he'd like to experience them "through Dean's eyes" anyway.
"Dude, don't make me cry," Dean says, and he doesn't mean to, he really doesn't, but he can't regret it when the words fall out anyway because it feels so damn good to tell the truth for once.
"Dean," comes a whisper in someone's ear, accompanied by some glowing sense, green bathwater warm and sparking gold. "Careful. Don't get lost."
"Yeah, Cas," he breathes, barely thinking about the words before they fall out of his mouth, "just like that. You got it. S'good."
"I'm fine, I just..." He takes a better breath and drags a hand down his face, remembering what he was going to say. "Man, I really missed you."
Sam comes over for his own hug as Jack turns to pull Dean up too, only to find him already clinging to the edge of the table. On the way up, Dean takes the chance to look Cas over, toe to head. No matter how many times he repeats it to himself, Dean can't make his brain remember that Cas is here, but he is: god, he is, hale and whatever, as beautifully whole as he was when he got swallowed alive by that fucking goo.
His cheeks flush extra when he accidentally glances over at Sam and Jack. He never told them exactly what happened when Cas died, but he suspects Jack knows more than he let on, having caught onto Dean's halting explanation for Cas's absence eerily quick, and he knows Sam figured out the reason Dean was going so off the rails in that first week of desperate, sober research. Dean hasn't said anything they didn't already know, if you don't count the depths of his self-loathing. The only person this is news to is Cas, and they all know that's the biggest deal.
Swallowing the sting, Dean spits back, "Tell me how you really feel."
It's not like he was lying to Sam in the garage. In his experience, there's very little worse than sitting with his thumb up his ass while being hunted by cosmic force. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why he wants to stay, though: the answer is unavoidably present, always stealing Dean's favorite mug and hogging the hot water and shivering in the room just around the corner from Dean's.
"Make me."
him clouding his judgment.
man to fall in love with."
"Yeah." Dean laughs as he steps further into the room. "That was a shock last time I reread it."
"Fuck you, dude." Dean punches his arm, but lightly, even though it doesn't matter to Cas anymore. He's feeling fragile enough for the both of them. It's eased a bit by Cas's reaction of laughing through his nose. "Dick."
"Do I what," Cas says rather than asks.
Cas takes a step forward, then another. His hand raises an inch like he's going to reach out, but falls back to his side when Dean instinctively shifts his weight back to one leg.
