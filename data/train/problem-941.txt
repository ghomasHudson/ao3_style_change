“Thank you.” The fox lay down where he was, mostly inside the burrow but with his nose and whiskers out in the cool air next to the bird. He was grateful, and awkward with it.
“It’s a popular Catholic icon. You’ve really never seen it before? Byzantine, I think, fifteenth century. The original’s in Rome, but you can find images everywhere.”
“Yes, ages. Ever since Mike Stamford first brought you on set. You’ve been driving me insane. I was positive you were interested, I knew you were, I could
Not that it detracted from anything when the bra came off, save for the degree of Molly’s nakedness - all she had on was the skirt rucked up to her waist. Irene stopped for a second to admire her handiwork (to give John time to pan down Molly’s body to the dark, curly head bobbing between her thighs) and went on to
I believed such seditious thoughts would be my last, there in the Afghan hills, but the Jezail bullet that entered my left leg saved my life. There is no doubt in my mind that I would have perished like so many others if I had been able to descend into the caves instead of lying bleeding on the slopes.
And as for Sherlock making short work of his belt, button and zip and burying his face in John’s crotch -
“Horrors.”
“I’ll take the ice pack, thanks.” It was on the tip of his tongue to tell him not to bother, he’d be up in a second for a cup of tea, and maybe to fry up a couple of eggs, but realistically there was only so much he could do at the moment.
“Oh, her. Yes. Dull.”
“I’m still here, Sherlock!”
Sherlock waved this away as the least of his concerns. “The bathroom’s fine - hot water, no leaks, and it’s clean, if a trifle dated. You can’t ask for much more than that. But you — ‘a nice fat cock up the arse’? Is that really what you like?”
Look, when I said I wanted to get this next bit out before the world imploded, I was speaking metaphorically and didn't
happen when an attractive naked man put his hands on you.
“I need you on this. Mrs. Hudson might just let the flat at last, and I can’t imagine anyone on earth being thrilled with the idea of us turning up on their doorstep, asking if we could use their sofa because you flubbed the shot of a blow job. So if you can’t get it together today, that’s fine, I know we all have off days. Just let me know now, while there’s still time for me to call Kate.”
He had barely finished giving himself a mental pat on the back when Irene entered the scene again. She was holding a very large, very pink dildo, quite realistically shaped, and John froze as she drew the tip of it down Sherlock’s spine, then over the ample curve of his arse, then she doubled back, parted his cheeks and
They knew better. Both of them did.
The stables were not quiet, not be any stretch of imagination, but the grooms and stablehands were happy to pay no attention to Sherlock when he showed up, provided that he did them the very simple favor of keeping out of their way. More importantly, none of them were were inclined to run to his mother about the smoking, which was more than could be said about the household staff. So it was not unusual for him to slouch down there of a morning, though he had not been going as regularly as he once did.
“I—” Excuses chased themselves around Sherlock’s head, all thrown off course by John’s sudden use of formal address. “I live here.”
That felt nice.
“It can wait, Sherlock.” John took one last drink and set the mug down on the table, trying to make his lap look empty and inviting. “Come here, will you?”
Molly snorted. “I’ve had enough of that today, thank you. I’ll take an uncomplicated dinner please.”
“Now.”
actors who did plays and television programmes and films where sex scenes either happened off camera or in tasteful shots of faces and shoulders and backs and, sometimes, feet - actors who would give their left arm to be able to do what he did. Hell, even a professional spy would have been envious of that skill set. Like now, for instance: by dint of slicking back his hair, dropping his shoulders and adopting a sly, sideways sort of smirk, he’d become a completely different person from the man who’d walked through the door a scant moment ago, even though he looked
“All right, then.”
In spite of all this, he found himself craving
“I don’t kn--”
“God, I hope so.” Sherlock groaned; Molly was palming him deftly through his coveralls, and John could see the outline of his erection through the rough material. “
is our best option
And it was utterly impossible for John’s brain to have room for anything else when Sherlock locked eyes with him through the camera again, half-naked with a naked-but-for-a-strip-of-cloth Molly draped over him, giving his fingers a passable approximation of a blow job while a barely-clothed Irene looked on.
inopportune time, “we work together. Might make things awkward.”
Sherlock couldn’t fail to notice how easily John had slipped into the past tense, but then he’d never known the man as anything other than a corpse. He was also entirely right, even if he’d missed almost everything of importance.
Molly’s turn meant Sherlock going to his knees between her legs, assuming much the same position as Irene earlier. He paused long enough for her to meet his suddenly doubtful expression with a grin of surprising wickedness, and if that hadn’t spurred him into action, Irene threading her fingers though his curls and guiding his mouth to Molly’s crotch would have done the trick.
Sarah's glare between his shoulder blades, could practically sense her lips forming the word 'Cut!', and, anticipating her order, he was about to lower the camera, but Sherlock met his eyes through the lens. And he held his gaze even as Irene groped his fantastic arse with what John believed was completely warranted enthusiasm.
, for God’s sake,
“Ooh, feel that big hard thing!” squealed Molly. “I want that
“But?”
Sherlock shrugged. He’d scraped his palm, skinned his knee, and torn his Spencer Hart trousers beyond any hope of repair, but none of that seemed to bother him as much as John’s black eye. “I’ll live. You, on the other hand - is it an ice pack or a warm compress on the second day?”
One day, when our work is done, we may be able to spend a quiet evening in Sussex, in a little cottage where we have beehives in the garden, with the light of the moon shining down upon us, pure and silver as it was before the Old Ones came.
“Possibly. Do they have dogs?”
the goatee you detest,” he laughed. “Well, it is not upon my chin yet, dear one.”
“Is that what that is?”
One did not flirt with the husbands of sorceresses, no matter how charming they were, and especially not if you were a prince of the realm and the sorceress in question was there at your mother’s invitation. It might be argued that princes were expected to behave in certain ways, but Sherlock had always sneered at those members of the nobility who couldn’t keep it in their pants.
“Privacy—”
was going to top that - at least, not in this film - John was able to watch all of that and Irene giving Sherlock’s bottom a playful smack without going all hot and trembly and weak at the knees.
Irene stepped in, leaning over Sherlock to kiss the other woman. It made for a scorching visual, especially when Sherlock reached behind him to squeeze Irene’s bum. And just before the scene became too static, Irene unpeeled herself from the other two and sashayed over to the other side of the table. Molly reached for her, and she obliged, first by taking her hand and bringing it to her lips, then guiding her down until she was lying on the hard wooden surface, spread out like a feast between Irene and Sherlock.
), the women went to their knees again to give Sherlock another long, messy blow job. It was, mercifully, the last thing on Sarah’s extensive pornographic checklist for this shoot. John could almost breathe easy now, only the room reeked of sex, heaven knew how Mrs. Hudson was going to explain that to her prospective lodgers this evening - come to that, heaven knew why she’d agreed to let them use the flat at all if she was expecting lodgers in the first place.
I managed to write a couple hundred words of this at 221B Con: some in the early morning (because I kept waking up at the ungodly hour of 5:30AM, unprompted, good lord, if only I could manage to do that on weekdays), and a bit in the Writer's Suite, which was very nice - thank you muchly for the chocolate.
“I might ask you the same thing, your highness.”
“Are you saying Sir...Jeffrey, was it?” John paused, looked over his shoulder as if the mystery someone might still be hanging about in broad daylight. “Are you saying he might have been murdered?”
, thought the fox.
There. I thought you might appreciate the bluntness.
It was almost enough to make the absurd scenario believable. From where he was, behind the camera with Sarah giving instructions over his shoulder, it was easy to remember that this was
Currently, there was nothing very lyrical about John going down on his knees so the camera could be scant inches away as Irene and Molly helped Sherlock step out of the coveralls, boots and Y-fronts, and, once he was no longer in danger of falling over because of his legs being trapped by a stretchy band of cloth (that had happened before, a gloriously happy accident), put their mouths on him.
“Oh, hello,” said the blackbird. “Don’t mind me. I won’t stay long—I’m only waiting out that hawk turning and turning in the widening gyre up there, and they can’t fly her forever. Er. Please don’t eat me. A right hash I’d have made of it, if I hid from the hawk only for you to eat me.”
“Good.”
He was fairly certain he’d dreamed of this, somewhere between the nightmares and the mundane nighttime meanderings, but he’d never imagined it was possible in the waking world. It might never happen again. So, struck by sobering thought, he ate Sherlock’s arse like tomorrow was a vague promise from a known confidence trickster.
As he spoke, he trailed his hand down his neck to his bare chest, to the edge of the towel at his waist. His fingers played over the bunched up terrycloth, almost but not quite suggesting that he was about to pluck the thing off.
occupied with long, slender fingers probing, stroking, stretching inner walls and finding the exact spots that would make a body melt into a tangled mess of nerve bundles. That was relatively easy compared to not imagining what those fingers would feel like in his mouth, against his tongue, because Molly - apparently energized by that orgasm instead of giving way to joyful lassitude - pushed herself up and into Sherlock’s arms, first kissing him soundly on the mouth, then seizing his hand to suck her juices off his fingers.
John grit his teeth in a humorless grin. He wouldn’t have been surprised if he turned around to find the lot of them joining in a festive chorus about what a mean-spirited old grouch he was. It would have been satisfying, in a way. Parting the seas of humanity with a thunderhead expression had heretofore been a Sherlockian talent, and the knack must be catching.
spent a fair amount of time considering Sherlock’s cock, not all of which was spent behind the camera.
“Though of course, there’s nothing like the real thing. Don’t you agree?”
He was teasing me—Monsieur Poirot, with his impeccably waxed moustaches, would never countenance such an affront to masculine grooming, and my companion would never offend his sensibilities so—yet I was unable to hide my outrage. “Confound it, Holmes, I will shave you myself if you attempt to grow that monstrosity before it is needful!”
Apparently the bird felt the same way.
John blinked, trying to wrap his head around that sentence as best he could with an unbearably attractive man holding his cock. After said attractive man had been sucking said cock. This was his life now.
John scrubbed a hand over his face. He hadn’t realized that his internal struggle hadn’t been all that internal after all, and hearing Sarah talk like that was a bit like getting drenched with a well-aimed bucket of ice water. He was a professional, damn it, and his boss had always been able to rely on him, and he wasn’t going to let her down just because an unbearably gorgeous man he was mildly in love with was going to have theatrical sex in front of him. All in a day’s work. Nose to the grindstone. Another day, another bare arse. Right.
The rest of that sentence was lost in a high, wordless moan that delivered on the industry’s promise of loud, showy orgasms.
Do I hope that, in some distant future, I might be able to share this story and earn my companion’s good name the reputation I know it deserves? He is the best and wisest man whom I have ever known, and it pains me daily that he must lurk in the shadows, unknown and feared by the world he is trying to save.
with ten letters?
“I can do that sometimes, yeah.”
I suppose I could begin with how we met, my companion and I, when I was a broken man, defeated and disillusioned by my campaign in Afghanistan. I could tell of our first adventure together—if such a word may be used to describe that ordeal—and of what followed after. I will not soon forget our encounter with the Giant Rat of Sumatra...
John didn’t have the option of looking away, not unless he quit his job then and there, handing the camera to Sarah before leaving 221B to have a good, hard wank in the safety of his own little flat. He swallowed and tried very hard not to think about wanking, tried to keep his mind blank and
Sherlock’s assent was a low growl as he pushed his cock into Molly’s hand. The half-undone coveralls were riding perilously low, exposing the waistband of his pants and resting just above the plump swell of his arse. If John had been allowed to take a slightly different shot, he would have seen the long lines of Sherlock’s back and those deliciously tempting dimples of Venus (
His shoulder hurt in the cold. Fairy lights were a bitch to put up, and a bastard to put away when they inevitably had to come down. He was fairly sure that real holly was poisonous (or was that mistletoe?), and fake holly was a choking hazard. Every single damn carol was either disgustingly twee or a subtle guilt trip. He hadn’t been expecting snow, so he slipped and slid on the pavement in unsuitable shoes. And as for peace, joy and goodwill to all mankind, John was pretty sure he’d seen two women having a row over the last Baby Yoda in the shop, so that was the state of the world right there.
“You heard me perfectly, I’m not saying it again.” The stretch ended and Sherlock slumped bonelessly in the chair. It wasn’t any better. He still could have been posing for a lascivious Renaissance statue — the sort that they wouldn’t put in churches because they might upset the young ladies, or, rather, the type of people who were unduly concerned about what might upset young ladies. “Much better than cigarettes. Cheaper too, in the long run. And,” Sherlock smirked, “better for breathing.”
“That gives me an E for
“Yeah. I figure if her, me, and Anderson can fit into a trench coat, we might make it to week five. Maybe even the semifinals, if we find someone who’s good with pastry — did I say something wrong, John?”
By this time, John was fucking his mouth in earnest, with his fingers tangled in Sherlock’s glorious curls, not so much to hold him in place as to make sure he was really there. He had imagined this so often that it was hard to believe it was actually happening, that Sherlock was sucking him off with reckless abandon, that Sherlock was standing now, towel forgotten on the floor, and that Sherlock was pulling him close and kissing him.
“That might not be the best idea.” John heard the words coming out of his mouth and hated himself for them. Prudence and self-denial were for Tesco runs when you were trying to stay within budget and had to put the unnecessary Wotsits back on the shelf. Not this.
“You’ll have it in five minutes.”
“Let’s move to the bed, then. Tell you what, we can use Mrs. Hudson.”
“That’s excessive, John. Why would you need to say
“Hello, Greg. You needed Sherlock? Hang on, let me get him for you.”
“That doesn’t work.
that John must have obtained by osmosis since he didn’t remember actually sitting down to watch that film.
He did, however, have to remind himself to breathe as Irene sat back, giving Molly space to straddle Sherlock’s hips and squirm enticingly.
“Can’t say it isn’t,” he managed to say as Sherlock loomed even closer. “But--”
The rest of the film went by in much the same way, with no significant interruptions apart from a couple of water breaks and Sarah asking for a few changes in angle. John felt himself settle into the glazed state one enters during a more difficult that usual this-too-shall-pass sort of work day, as scene after scene played out in front of his camera. Sherlock finishing with Molly and starting on Irene, on her back with her head in a blissed-out Molly’s lap. Molly leaning over to lick alternately at Irene’s clit and Sherlock’s cock moving in and out of her. An improbable daisy chain with Sherlock bent into a lewd approximation of a downward dog so that he could eat Irene out while Molly sucked his bollocks. The dildo making a sanctioned reappearance, this time aimed at Molly’s cunt as Sherlock fucked her arse - they went through a few takes until Molly started to protest and they stuck with the one where she was sprawled on Sherlock’s lap with Irene next to them on the sofa, exchanging kisses with them both as she worked the toy.
That ‘
"Oh, he likes to watch," said Molly.
“Done.”
! – how you knew,” he said as evenly as he could manage. “I’m pretty sure I asked Sarah not to bring that up, though Mike could have told anybody. But ‘get moving’, is it?” He moved his hands to Sherlock's trim waist and, shuffling a bit because his trousers were around his ankles and his pants were somewhere by his calves, maneuvered him a few crucial inches to the right so that he was backed up against the table. "I'll show you 'get moving'."
“Behind the stables?” John snorted. “I doubt that.”
“Ah, breathing—breathing’s boring.”
"You've shot more than that." Sarah Sawyer smiled at her cameraman. It wasn't the norm for a woman to be the director of a rather successful porn film studio - she certainly hadn't counted on making a career of it, John knew for a fact that she'd been to medical school, just like him - but she had recognized early on that sex sells, and she figured that she could do as good a job, or better, by being behind the camera instead of in front of it, and she'd be able to take care of the girls in the bargain.
Sherlock’s laugh came as a surprise, though not as much as the fact that he sounded relieved. “Finally, you noticed.”
With that, she pulled him into a kiss.
“Yes, boss.” The words stuck a bit on their way out, but John knew that
So this was happening, then. Right.
, amended John as Irene helped Sherlock shrug off the top part of his outfit. Very hot indeed. So hot, in fact, that John had to bite back an embarrassing sound when he saw Irene press her lips to his chest.
“I know you haven’t deleted the Beatles, Sherlock!”
“I think
Irene gave her an even look. "Oh, honestly, Molly. You'd think you'd never worked with the man before."
“Oh lord, don’t you start.” She waggled a finger at him, but she was already a little further away from being well and truly cross. “Any more of that and I’ll think you really are possessed.”
But I told you I loved you, and now you’re hurt, and it’s my fault.
“Hm.”
If Sherlock had been any closer, John was not a hundred percent certain that he wouldn’t have hit him. Instead, being a desk and a couple of chairs away and quite keen on
"Yes, yes, that's enough, you two. Play nice, children," Sarah intervened, taking the case of tools from him. "Sherlock, get out of those ridiculous clothes, please, we're doing the plumber one today,
“Yes,” he said, zipping his bag shut with an audible protest of zipper teeth. “You’re right. I myself,” he continued, gritting his teeth, “prefer a nice fat cock up my arse over a bit of plastic, vibrating or not, but we can’t always get what we want. And about the bathroom, Sarah said —”
Molly ducked into the kitchen to change, which John found charmingly ironic, seeing as they were all going to see her stripped to the skin later on. Sarah turned to him then. "I don't need to tell you what to do, John. You're brilliant."
Sherlock knew better. Of course he did.
“So he might not have been alone—oh.”
Knowing my companion as I do, this was not a statement to be taken lightly. He prizes his intellect above all else, justifiably so, and any man he considers to be on his level must be a terrible danger indeed.
"All right, John?" smiled Irene, her grey eyes taking in his smart jacket and shoes. She was a sharp one, and with her personality it was hard to cast her in anything but a domineering position (though in one of her more memorable films, she'd turned out to be badly in need of discipline herself). "So, Sarah, tell us how it's going to work."
"I meant to change in the cab," explained Sherlock, shrugging off his Belstaff coat and untying his blue scarf. "I just came from another job. Couldn't have bloody well changed costume on the Tube."
, was on the very tip of John’s tongue.
He didn't quite manage it. The sound was not as loud as it might have been - that was a small mercy - but it still escaped his pressed-together lips, and it was still embarrassing in the extreme. There was a distressed tea kettle quality to it that John knew he would never live down. He could
"It's in the Lizzie and Carol series, so like a home video, with a handheld camera so you can get right up close to the action. I want wet and filthy close-ups of penetration, John. And you'll be on voice-over as the guy friend who's helping them with their blog, exclaiming how hot they are every now and then."
John closed his eyes. He hadn’t wanted to look away—frankly hadn’t been able to—while Sherlock’s mouth was on his cock, but he wanted to focus on this kiss and nothing else. Sherlock’s lips were, yes, brilliant, and so was his tongue—Christ, he could taste himself there—and so were his arms around John, and John supposed he could die happy now, this was all he’d wanted ever since he met Sherlock Holmes only...only...

Forgive the gallows humor, my lovelies. I hope you're all keeping well, and I'll be more careful with my figures of speech from here on out.
“I’ve done what I can for the Homeless Network. I got Mycroft involved. I wish I could do more.”
She teased him first, rocking her hips against Sherlock’s body, keeping his cock trapped between them and giving him - and the eventual audience - just enough stimulation to be completely and utterly maddening. Sherlock certainly acted like it was: he gasped, moaned, thrust his own hips up to meet Molly’s, and, when all else failed, he coaxed Irene up off his face long enough to stutter, “Please - God -
“What?”
I’m not taking back the sentiment. Not that. Never that. I’ve lived my life wrapped up in you since the day we met, and I loved you before I had the words for it.
"I'm allowed to enjoy it, aren't I?"
He sucked until John was nearly delirious, then he pulled off just so, stopping just long enough for John to get a good eyeful of his lips stretched around his cock before ducking down to lick at John’s bollocks. Then he drew those into his mouth as well, all the while using his hand on John’s shaft, swiping his thumb over the slit that was already leaking pre-ejaculate. And just before that became too much, he released John, sitting back to show him that he had been jerking himself off as well, giving every evidence of being as turned on by giving John a blow job as John was on the receiving end of it.
I used my four seconds recklessly in Afghanistan. I thought I was saving lives, redoing all the little decisions like who to treat first, where and when to seek shelter, whether to take a half step to the right or the left to shove the soldier in front of me out of harm’s way. I thought I was helping until I wasn’t. It’s still hard to talk about what happened when I stopped Bill Murray from getting blown up. It’s harder to think about what happened when I saved my own life.

“It can’t hurt,” said Sarah, not missing a beat. “I will see you tomorrow. Ladies, if you could give me a hand with this - excellent, thank you.”
Of course his large hands were roaming all over Irene’s lithe body, and of course his mouth was smearing down her neck as she shook off her blouse. There was really no other way it could have been, given the genre they were working in (Sarah didn’t much go for soft core stuff) and the actor that Sherlock was (he was never less than fully dedicated to a role, no matter how improbable or ludicrous), but John wondered if he had to be quite so...so
“I thought I made that clear.” Sherlock wrapped his fingers around John’s wrists so that he could draw his hands down his body to rest on his bottom. “But, if you need me to elaborate, I want you to fuck my arse until you come.” He pressed closer to John, his cock hard and hot against John’s stomach. “And I want you to make me come while I have that gorgeous cock of yours inside me.”
“I’m sure you do. I just don’t feel we have much leverage when it comes to noise complaints, seeing as you literally shoot the walls and Mrs. Turner’s married ones haven’t said anything about it even once.”
“I - I don’t think....” he said, backing away ever so slightly as she invaded his personal space. Irene laid a finger on his lips to silence him - the very finger she’d been using on Molly.
“It wasn’t the dog’s fault.” Sherlock perched on the arm of John’s chair. “And I disagree:
, if penises could be said to be elegant. However, as nice as it was, its main attraction was that it was an elegant penis attached to the rest of Sherlock Holmes. When he’d finished saying this, Sarah had blinked twice, said that she’d look for him the next time she needed several reams of lyrical prose on the subject of male anatomy, and shooed him out of her office.
“Hunters?” The fox yawned, stretched, shook himself. He remembered fox hunts—baying hounds, thundering hooves, a great deal of fuss over nothing—but he could not recall being hunted. That must have been from his other life then, but that was a thought for later, if he could hang on to it.
In the normal course of things, we would have fled as soon as the deed was done, flushed with victory and stained with the inhuman creature’s blood, like the hunting dogs from which we take our name. But my companion counseled patience. We were being pursued, he said, by an adversary who was very nearly his equal, and drawing attention to ourselves by taking sudden flight would have guaranteed our capture.
“Okay,” said Sarah, satisfied that neither John nor the film had suffered irreparable damage. “To be absolutely clear, no one to put

be discreet, what with his job involving filming Sherlock Holmes in almost every filthy pornographic scenario imaginable. Sarah, at least, was good about it, refraining from pointing out the obvious tent in John's trousers as long as he kept the camera steady. As far as she was concerned, little inconveniences like that came with the territory of shooting porn for a living. She had in fact confided to him once, during a Christmas party liberally doused with alcohol, that she didn't blame him one bit as Sherlock was sex on long, gorgeous legs, and that she actually had to lock herself in her office sometimes after shooting his scenes, so that she could spend some quality time with a dildo or her fingers (John had actively prevented Sarah from getting any more drinks thereafter, and had ridden with her in the taxi back to her flat to make sure she made it home). Still, her having pointed it out yesterday made him uncomfortably self-conscious, and he fussed over his appearance before heading to the set, even if it wouldn't have mattered if he'd gone to work in a tea cozy.
“Oh god.”
in Sherlock’s arse, although I won’t mind if you bite it - actually, Irene, do bite it and pinch his nipples. Now, let’s take it from Sherlock giving it to Molly from behind.”
John’s hips stuttered, making the tip of it brush his lips, and Sherlock smiled, moving his head so that it dragged across the seam of his mouth. John groaned; Sherlock’s smile grew wider.
I’ve tried doing over the rest of the night, all of it in four-second slices. Nothing’s worked so far, and that’s the only part I haven’t touched yet. Because I told you I loved you and you looked happy, and I can be a selfish bastard when it comes right down to it. But it’s all right. I know what I saw, and I’ll tell you again. Every day for the rest of your natural life, I’ll tell you, but the important thing is that you have to be here to hear it.
So was the sight of Sherlock on his knees in front of him, truth be told.
No worries there. I’ll be happy to demonstrate. But later. It’ll have to be later, okay?
“Warmer, anyway.” John gave his leg a quick, affectionate squeeze. “Thank you, love.”
John managed to dodge her by ducking into the corridor when she did the living room, but she drove Sherlock, still in those ridiculous (
“Oh, it’s quite simple,” said Irene, half-turning while she casually went on fucking Molly with her fingers. “My friend here fancies you, but she’s a little shy.” She paused long enough for Molly to nod and give a timid laugh. “So I was helping her warm up for you. Would you like a taste?”
"Such as it is," Sarah laughed. "Well, a plumber comes in to check the pipes in a flat shared by two hot girls..."
“I’m a doctor. I know how to poke things.” John considered Sherlock, wondering - not for the first time - how he could have gotten so lucky. He didn’t know what the best thing about his mornings had been before the sight of a just-woken-up Sherlock Holmes in his rumpled pyjamas and dressing gown became a regular occurrence, but whatever it was had faded into obscurity. The first sip of a cup of tea or some such mundane rot couldn’t have been anywhere near as glorious. “How are you feeling?”
Another important thing is that I’ve only got one shot at changing any specific four seconds. Once I do them over, they’re done for true.
He looked thoughtful for a while, as he began to strip off, for the last time, the guise of the actor Sherry Vernet.
John phased out while Sarah went through the finer points of the plot, such as it was, with her actresses, using the time to adjust the settings on his camera. They were a small outfit, after all, albeit a prolific one, and Sarah didn't often call in other people to work lighting and sounds. This film was going to be the latest installment in one of their more successful series that revolved around two horny flatmates, Lizzie (Irene) and Carol (Molly), and their voyeuristic male friend of debatable sexuality who stayed behind the camera. So far the girls had had sex with each other, Carol's Boyfriend, Lizzie's College Professor, a Policeman under hastily explained circumstances, and a Female Personal Trainer who'd come to the flat to teach them yoga. Sarah had told John that she wanted them to do an airline pilot
“I endeavor to please you in all things, but it can only be Altamont and no other. He is already known in the secret loyalist societies of Chicago and New York, and until we are safely ensconced with Miss Hatty Dornan in California, there is no other name that will secure our passage through the New World. Tell me,” he continued, smiling impishly, “what is it about him that you find so objectionable? His blind devotion to the Old Ones? The goatee? Or the war he has apparently declared on the Queen’s English?”
Imagine, therefore, my surprise at his not only engaging this Moriarty in conversation, but also disguising himself as a cabbie to drive the man and his taciturn friend to their lodgings. And as if that had not already been enough of a foolhardy risk, he left this morning to deliver a message to the villain!
“To the stream. They mustn’t pick up my trail, otherwise they’ll just dig up the sett.”
“That’s the third time this week, John!”
“Sorry,” he said. “I think I know what’s gotten into me today, and it’s the soul of a horny teenager.”
Christmas, he thought, could stick it right up its plum pudding arse.
“It’s just so different, John. I’ll have to learn London all over again. All that life - it’s still going on, but away from the surface. I’m having a hard time putting a finger on its pulse.”
"Oh, for God's sake, Sarah, it's not that bad." He sniffed. "Is it?"
“What do
It was logical in a way that propositions rarely are - certainly no one had tried to
“It seems like you made new friends, Sherlock.”
The pinging of his messages provided a counterpoint to the noise of Sarah and John doing their best to make it look like they had never been in the flat at all. This mostly consisted of tossing things back into plastic bins - quick work, since they never occupied the flat for more than a session or two at a time - and Sarah wielding two cans of air freshener like a madwoman after most of the bins had been safely stowed in the boot of her car.
Only Sarah gave him another prod in the ribs because what he should have been paying attention to was Molly beckoning him over. He shot Sarah an apologetic look and moved to the corner of the living room where the actresses were standing.
For his part, Sherlock was unused to such an alarming depth of feeling that he couldn’t dismiss through sheer force of will, and he found it easier to flee than confront the impulses that possessed him whenever he found himself alone with John Watson. The small gods alone knew what was going through John’s head, but he certainly clung to Mary like a limpet and was seldom seen without her.
The fox did. He was properly awake now, and didn’t need more than a fox’s mind to sense the subtle wrongness in the woods. There were cautionary undertones to the birdsong, and the rustling in the undergrowth was hushed. Hunters indeed.
“Sherlock!”
) reflection, this was something he wanted very much indeed. Had wanted, in fact, so intensely and for such an unreasonable period of time during which no action whatsoever had been taken that he would be a damn fool to turn it down. Any token misgivings about carrying on a torrid affair in the workplace could, perhaps, be put down to a shared recollection of
“You say this after a year of living among actors! My dearest Watson, you amaze me.” He laid a conciliatory hand on my shoulder. “If it is any comfort to you, it will be some time before we can be on our way.”
and he had to zoom in, zoom out, focus where Sarah told him to, and keep the camera at a titillating angle. But as he followed Sherlock-as-a-plumber’s leer up and down Molly and Irene’s bodies while they made their introductions (a little whining about the sink, a little giggling, a little unnecessary touching), he wondered what it would be like to see this as a consumer instead of part of the production, to lose himself properly in this wank fantasy in private, with his hand curled around his prick. Though, of course, that sort of viewing, however indulgent, would never be as close as this, where he could see everything, hear everything, and - if he lost his mind entirely - he could reach out and touch...
“Oh, stop it.”
coming all over Sherlock’s hand. “You’re doing a lot of talking for a man who wants to get laid in someone else’s flat.”
*waves* Still here. Still writing. Still painfully slow - possibly well past the geological timescale now and into the astronomical. Hoping to crank out the next installment before the world implodes.
Sarah bustled over to Sherlock, tutting loudly when she saw what he was wearing. True, the man was carrying what seemed to be a case of actual, well-used plumbing tools, but the rest of him was looking unbearably posh, from his dark curls to his silk shirt to the toes of his well-made leather shoes. Unbearably posh, and, thought John, risking a brief, professional nod at the man, devastatingly, toe-curlingly attractive.
Sherlock made a face to show what he thought of that. “Please. Save the mundanities for later. I meant, how shall we start having sex?
classical music, Sherlock.”
“That’s brilliant, John.”
“I’m saying that this deserves a closer look.”
“You don’t have to do that, you know,” he said.
. There. Come here, John, they say we can start now.”
Irene gave Molly one final, lingering lick, grinning wickedly with her red, red lips (
) and find out where it lived, but it was taking all of his concentration to override his fox-mind and ensure his continued survival. The blackbird kept with him as he splashed through the stream, going first one way then doubling back, and, once they were tolerably certain of losing the dog, he flit in front of the fox to lead him to a welcoming hole in the ground.
“It’s a start.” The bird moved to a perch a little higher up: he recognized the snappish look. “Makes it that much more unlikely that you were a farmhand who stumbled into a witch’s garden. And you’re aware of an
He was being silly, and he knew it. This wasn’t anything he hadn’t seen before, it wasn’t as if Sherlock was going out of his way to make it seductive (unlike, say, that one film that started with a striptease for a bachelor party and ended in a well-orchestrated orgy, just to name one of the things that kept John up at night). To make matters worse, he was the only one staring as Sherlock, bare arse in the air, stepped out of an expensive-looking pair of clingy black boxers. And to compound the dratted business even further, Sherlock bloody Holmes - now pulling on a pair of Marks & Spenser Y-fronts - seemed to have eyes at the back of his head.
“To bloody Sherlock Holmes, that’s the trouble. And he’s taken it back. You can bet his lawyer’s having a fucking field day with that.”
“I’d prefer it if you kept your own pretty face away from where the fists are flying.”
opera!”
Technically, it was more of a brush than a grab. The full weight of his palm and outspread fingers only really rested on John’s arm for the barest second. Still, it was more than enough time for John’s thoughts to fizz uncomfortably: it had to be an accident, Sherlock had to have been reaching for Molly - wait, no, he was a professional, he wasn’t
“No, I gathered it was the kind with hooves and a tail. And they all agreed that you got into a dairy and spilled the milk and took a bite out of all the cheeses. That’s why they think it’s a fox, by the way, rather than a wolf or a madman. Apparently cheddar takes a good impression of teeth.”
“Disagreement with the landlord,” said Sherlock dismissively, lazily rubbing the back of his neck as if to ease a crick there (unsurprising, given his activities in the past few hours). “And I’ve already taken my clothes off. Putting them back on just to go somewhere else to take them off again would be rather a waste, don’t you think?”
because he was, for all intents and purposes, presenting his arsehole to John – who realized what he was looking at, and found it that much harder to get all that bunched-up clothing past his shoes.
“Sir Jeffrey Patterson.” Sherlock crouched down next to John, his tobacco pouch entirely forgotten. “He left about a year ago as a trade envoy. His delegation returned late last night—surely you must have heard the commotion at the gate?—and he was supposed to have an audience with my mother this morning.”
"Hi, Irene, Molly," said John, smiling at the two of them over Sarah's shoulder. He'd worked with them before, and they often worked together, either as lesbian lovers or as two parts of gloriously dirty threesomes (or more-somes). The last film they'd done was an office fantasy where the strict boss - Irene - seduced her shy new secretary - Molly - and took her hard on her desk in her glass-walled office.
“Oh, hush.” Sherlock spared John a quick, upward glance before drawing his lips over the thickening outline of his cock.
I can go back if I want to badly enough, if I know
tongue was doing something truly incredible that left John making helpless little noises at the back of his throat, with absolutely no opportunity or ability to ask inane questions.
someone, but if he did, why did they leave him when he was clearly in distress? Why didn’t they get help? And if no help was to be had, why didn’t they tell anyone?” Sherlock tilted his head in the direction of the main keep. “No one else knows he’s dead yet. It’s far too quiet over there for that.”
“Couldn’t you have asked for some actual bread?”
“A ten-letter word for
"We've done this with loads of our friends," said Irene, as if that was enough to explain the whole situation.
John stood back up - Christ, this was going to be hell on his back, he should have knelt - and wiped his chin with the back of his hand.
“Hey! Wake up!” said the bird urgently, darting backwards to avoid the teeth but still staying close. “And I mean wake up properly! There are hunters in the woods, and they’re looking for a fox. You’ll need your mind.”
Sherlock gave a bark of laughter at that. “Hard work? This is the best day I’ve ever had on the job!”
“And you already had that gorgeous mouth all to yourself. Greedy girl.” Irene smirked and drew the pad of her thumb over those cupid’s bow lips. “I want that next.” She jerked her head in the direction of the living room, an order as much as anything. “Come along now.”
Attention. Right. By now, Sherlock was making a show of examining the kitchen sink, bending at the waist at an improbable angle so that his arse was facing the camera. Right. That was a good visual. He could work with that.
“Was that really necessary, my dear?” I asked him as soon as he had locked the door behind him.

"Yeah, but it never ceases to amaze me. And the plot?"
through the walls.”
His supply of tobacco was dwindling. What he’d brought back from university was almost gone and it would be a long while before he’d be able to bribe anyone into buying him more, but he’d had a difficult night. That was worth at least one roll-up.
“And you occupy him for hours on end, and he may or may not have a loaf at the end of it. You really won’t rest until you make proper bread, will you, love?”
“If you must know,” he said, “I wanted to say good morning.”
“He’s--”
“You heard me,” said Sherlock again. His voice was ever so slightly disparaging, admonishing John in the undertones to
“By poking at it.”
"Wouldn't I want to join in?" asked John, teasingly.
It is difficult to refuse any of his requests, for they are always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. Nevertheless, I did worry. I was unable to rest easy, pacing our own rooms deep in the Rookery of St. Giles until I again heard his tread upon the stair much later in the day.
, for God’s sake, he’d been in the

in the throes of sexual passion, he knew damn well what he was doing. And what he was doing - what he had been doing since he’d walked through the door of 221B, come to think of it - was fucking with John.
“You never asked, Glenn.”
John said ‘ow’ again much later, because the aches and pains didn’t miraculously disappear, but it was more out of habit than anything he actually minded.
“No.”
“Yes. I couldn’t put them on while I was working.” Sherlock let his head fall back and groaned. “I’d kill for the real thing. Impossible to maintain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.”
“Why would that be g--” John turned to face Sherlock and another question became much more pertinent when he saw what was on his forearm. “Is that three patches?”
“What the hell is going on here?” demanded Sherlock, pointedly
"A threesome, M/F/F, oral, double penetration, sex toys, with a side of dirty talk and lots of cum over faces and tits. Girl-on-girl action too. That stuff sells well."
“I didn’t think so.” The bird tilted his wise little head at him. “Someone’s gone out of their way to frame you, my friend. You must have made them very angry.”
"Bloody prima donna," he said, sympathetically, as Sarah finished talking to Molly and Irene and started staring at the door as if she could will her actor to appear behind it if she tried hard enough.
“Well...”
The fox awoke to the blackbird tugging at his ear. He was never in the best of tempers upon waking, and, out of instinct and judicious irritation, he snapped at the bird before he knew what he was doing.
an air hostess eventually, but she was still trying to figure out how they could shoot the film on an actual plane.

“A nice Assam blend. I thought you might like it. A client dropped it off while you were out—Shos-something or another.”
“More fool me for not asking.” John huffed and stamped and clung to his black mood. He’d nursed it for this long and couldn’t easily be coaxed into putting it down. “There was a mix-up at the poultry shop. They didn’t have a goose for us—”
My companion stirs, and he calls me back to bed.

“What is it then?”
there.)
“Don’t mention the fairy cakes, John!”
“John, you know as well as I do that she doesn’t hear that caterwauling over the death metal on her headphones.”
"Good girl, Irene," said Sarah approvingly. "Let's have your hair in a French braid, please, I want to have a clear view of your face, especially when it's got Sherlock's cock in it."
“Going by last week’s pattern, they’ll put us through this at least fifteen times by Sunday. Maybe more if they have Italian options, less if they’ve got Russian. Or those surrealist, twentieth century ones.”
Irene took Molly by the hand, and John followed them to the kitchen where, as per instructions, after giving her a quick kiss and pressing a finger to her lips for silence, Irene shoved Molly onto the table, pushed up her skirt and proceeded to eat her out.
“Yes, you see it now, don’t you?” Sherlock found himself smiling despite the situation—or rather, because of it. His mind was racing, leaping as the facts danced for him and slid neatly into place. He’d missed this much more than intelligent conversation, felt its dearth more keenly than the prospective absence of tobacco. And John was following him with no small degree of acuity, if at a slightly plodding pace. It was an altogether heady combination, and he could feel sorry about Sir Jeffrey later—not that feeling sorry for him would do him any good now. “The most likely explanation is that he came here
“Sure you don’t want a taste?” he asked, using his free hand to guide Molly’s fingers to his groin, and looking exactly like a debauched sex god from one of the dirtier pantheons in the process.
Today's location was 221B Baker Street, an actual flat which the landlady let them rent for their films while it was still tenant-less. Mrs. Hudson had been an exotic dancer in her day, and, though she never looked in while they were working ("Not at my time of life, dears."), she occasionally brought up trays of tea and biscuits for the girls between takes. Sarah raised her eyebrows at John when he came upstairs with his equipment.
Christmas was just around the corner, and the season was in full festive swing. Fairy lights twinkled in every window; holly and ivy festooned every available surface; and strains of carols drifted through the crisp winter air, reminding the general populace in no uncertain terms that it was, in fact, the holiday season. It had even contrived to snow that evening, coating the city in a magical white blanket straight out of a greeting card.
But I am woolgathering. Forgive me.
“Come
Four seconds was enough for that too, yes. By rights, I should be dead. I did that without thinking. I didn’t mean to, but I was scared and hurt and...that's something else for later.

John snuggled closer: Sherlock’s body warmth was a delightful counterpoint to the cold.

And, oh, did they carry on. There was a lot of tongue and quite a bit of teeth, as well as a fair amount of moaning, some of which was coming from Molly on the table. John shot a few seconds of her watching them with an expression of avid lust on her face and her fingers on her clit, before going back to the show Irene and Sherlock were putting on. Their hands worked furiously, with Sherlock slipping his large hands under Irene's blouse (you could see his fingers digging into her skin beneath the thin cloth, clear as day) and Irene unzipping his coveralls to reveal bare, sweaty skin. From the way they were grabbing and pawing at each other, it seemed like they couldn't get enough of each other's skin...until you noticed that their bodies were angled for the camera's benefit with a good few inches between them. Still, it was pretty hot.

buckled, and there was no real harm in pretending it had been because Sarah had brushed past him on her way to snatch the dildo out of Irene’s hands. Although from the way Sherlock’s eyes rested on him as she apologized and asked to review the footage, John just knew the bastard could tell he was shamming. When he turned to look at him directly, however, Sherlock, still on his knees (Molly has since slumped into a more comfortable position) was staring into the middle distance and rubbing his left arse cheek. It jiggled. John gulped.
"It's just that I could smell your cologne from across the road, that's all."
“And I will pass. Things to see, people to do, Mrs. Hudson to pay.” Sarah took the bin from John. “Look, you guys were brilliant today - yes, I still do mean you, John, you can stop looking guilty now. It was a great last shoot at this location.”
He knew that if he looked at the water through the correct configuration of lenses, he would see little wriggling animalcules that would put him right off drinking it.
“Sorry, Greg.”
Sherlock’s skin was warm beneath his hands – good God, the man truly did have a magnificent arse – and Sherlock’s hair was still damp (and, yes, definitely floral) from the shower when he moved to kiss and lick at John’s throat, and Sherlock’s fingers were firm and steady as they curled around John’s cock once more. John shuddered and moaned and gripped tighter. Sherlock made a sound like a pleased rumble of thunder at that, and nipped lightly at John’s earlobe.
“Definitely not good. I’m not thrilled by their music either, but that just isn’t on.”
“Good.”
It was an act of seduction, clearly and deliberately aimed at one John H. Watson. He licked his lips. This was a far cry from his usual guilty voyeurism from behind the camera. Which, he had to admit, was rather nice.
To put it simply, everything hurt: generally, all over, in a way that reminded him he wasn’t twenty and fighting fit anymore, and specifically, in some places, to drive home the point with emphatic punctuation. The worst of it was the left side of his face.
Sherlock stayed like that for a long moment: kneeling, fingers hooked in the waistband of John’s jeans, face pressed against the front of John’s pants, breathing him in and looking for all the world as though
Peace, joy, and goodwill to all mankind radiated relentlessly from all fronts.
So saying, she shrugged off her coat. Irene often came to the set dressed for her roles, once famously going commando under an ankle-length coat. Today was no exception. Under her coat, she was wearing short denim shorts and a white top so sheer that her nipples showed through the material. For good measure, she undid the top two buttons of her blouse, and looked at Sarah for approval.
“Ow,” said John, softly but with feeling.
“I saw.” Sherlock stood, and, in an unthinking moment, offered John a hand to help him up as well. There were no sparks when John took it, but there was warmth that spread underneath his skin until it reached his very heart. “I’ll have to inform my mother,” he said, walking away briskly to hide his face. “And the Guard. It’s a shame Lestrade is away—that leaves Anderson in charge, and he’s next to useless on the far side.”
That made Sherlock

What else is important? I can’t take anyone or anything with me, that seems to be a rule. And I can only do over bits that I’ve been through myself. I can’t go back in time and stop Archduke Ferdinand from being killed is what I’m getting at, but I can nip back to Tesco last Wednesday and decide not to pick up the damn lettuce that won’t scan at the chip and PIN machine.
“Hush now,” she purred. “We’re only playing a game.”
“I might have been.” Those were the first words the fox could remember speaking—or at least the first words he’d needed in a long while. He yawned, and the blackbird darted back instinctively when his sharp teeth closed like a trap. “What do you think of tea?”
“Bizet. Again. Although I congratulate them on their choice of soprano.”
“A shame, but Mrs. Hudson has an emergency chicken in her freezer.” Sherlock tightened his arm about John’s shoulders in a half-hug, then began to help him out of his damp jacket. “I could have told you that too.”

, but I know I’ll never make it past bread week. Now, Donovan, she makes a great Chelsea bun...”
“One of the guys in my unit used to carry one just like it.”
His feelings must have shown plainly on his face, since the milling holiday crowds gave him a wide berth on the Tube. He could feel more than one pair of eyes slide uncomfortably sideways to avoid his expression. A mother snatched her child out of his way when he swore heartily at a patch of ice that almost made him lose his footing. The suspiciously cheery man who was about to apologize for bumping shoulders with him took one look at John’s face and fled. And he heard a distinct tremble creep into a nauseatingly sweet melody as he tramped past a gaggle of carol singers on the street corner.
John rather thought that was his territory. If he had known he was going to have a bona fide sex god (an actual role once that had involved a lot of faux leather and, to Sarah’s chagrin, a lot of creaking) palming him worshipfully through his underwear, he would have worn nicer pants.
John made what he meant to be a non-committal noise, but was a good deal too pained to count as such. Sherlock was about a foot away now - within

isn't until next week."
All told, it was an awful lot of trouble to go to just to help a hypothetical someone get off, maybe, in the future, if this was their thing. John had this thought at least once a week. It never ceased to amaze him what some people would pay actual money for, but he couldn’t question it too much because he was getting paid for it.
“They’ve all gone?” Sherlock asked throwing himself into one of the armchairs by the fireplace as if he had every right to lounge there.
Though he supposed John Watson could say much the same thing about the body he was currently examining.
“Thanks. Say, can you understand me?” The bird turned its head to look at the fox with each bright black eye. “You do, I know it! Fancy that. I’ve been in these woods for days, and the only other thing I’ve been able to talk to is a half-witted nightingale and I think she was just trying to be polite.” He pushed a wing feather into place with his shiny yellow beak, looking thoughtful. “She was a girl once, or I’ll eat my hat. Well. I’d eat my hat if I had it, though in this shape, I’d probably be better off making a nest in it. Were you someone too?”
normal was Sherlock’s warm hand landing on John’s shoulder.
“That’d be better, yeah. But not—”
"That's it in a nutshell," agreed Sarah. "You know how we play it, ladies: Molly, you express interest first, but Irene's the one who makes it happen, okay? And she does this by--"
personal haunt.
At that point, Sarah jabbed him in the side with the corner of her clipboard and brought him back to his senses.
"So what do we have for tomorrow?"
“You know what I mean.” Sherlock nearly fell back on the haughtiness that served him so well, but he caught the twinkle in John’s eye. Oh dear. This was flirting again, wasn’t it? He held up his tobacco pouch instead. “My mother forbids smoking inside the castle in general, and in my case in particular.”
“Then please make sure Sherlock leaves the bathroom looking presentable.”
“He was away for a long time. He might have fallen ill, might have picked up new habits.”
In a way, that stunt with the dildo had been a good thing. Safe in the knowledge that

“Going by your reaction, I take it that you won’t be remedying the dearth any time soon?”

doing here?”
this time,
“Oh.”
My companion has often accused me of undue sentimentality, and I will own that this claim is not unfounded. In the past, I had some aspirations of being a literary man, but my circumstances did not permit me to profitably exercise my skill with a pen. My chosen profession left me little time for scribbling fanciful crowd-pleasing tales. And the cause to which I am now committed makes even idle musings such as these an intolerable risk.
. I should have known they wouldn’t fall for it. Mrs. Turner talks.”
He knew he wasn't being particularly eloquent – unlike some porn stars, he didn't have much practice at delivering coherent lines in the middle of sex – but Sherlock didn't seem to mind. Nor did he object to being turned around and bent over the table, which John could only hope was as sturdy as the one in the kitchen. In fact, he seemed quite pleased with that development, going by how he spread his legs and reached behind himself to part his arse cheeks while John struggled out of the bottom half of his clothes.
“Hm.” Sherlock considered this, then shifted his knees so that he could get a closer look at John. “Better now?”
“Don’t get any ideas!”
“Mhm.”
“And I assumed at least one of you would do your job.”
“The third one: A.”
"Well, look who's finally here," called Irene from the kitchen.
The Rookery of St. Giles
And there’s always a cost.
“Nonsense, John. You’ll like it.”
“Humbug,” supplied Sherlock, cheerfully. “Yes, I recognize the sentiment—hard to feel any other way after you do battle with the Christmas rush. Here, you need a hot drink.”
Or at least that was what it would look like in the film. They did three takes of that scene, until Sarah was satisfied with the one where Irene grabbed Sherlock by the sides of his head to launch what looked very much like an oral attack, and let them carry on from there.
“There’s an empty badger sett just west of here,” said the bird, looking back at the fox. “I found it yesterday. You can go to ground there, or come out the other end and keep running.”
“We’ll talk about that later, when they’re in a better mood. I may have access to some rare Maria Callas footage to use as leverage.”
“Oh shit. How’d you even get their number?”
John,” growled Sherlock through clenched teeth, and John felt the rumble of that going through his body, all that arousal and frustration mixed into a minor earthquake.
“A gigantic hound, though that might be a matter of perspective: I am quite small now. Hey! Where are you going?”
“He’s not been dead long,” he said, looking up as Sherlock approached. His expression was grave, a jarring thing on a face Sherlock associated with easy smiles and good humor. “Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on his own vomit. Who was he?”
"And it's lovely to see you too, Irene," said Sherlock as Sarah fussed over him. "And you, Molly."
My companion, as ever, knew my mind without my having to speak a word. “Come now, that day of reckoning is a long way off. A
“Oh, I don’t know.” Molly bit her lip, and shot another look at Sherlock (John didn’t know what would require a plumber to thrust his pelvis up like that, but Sherlock was doing it). “I mean, he came here to do a job, do you think he would...?”
In real life, John gave an undignified gurgle, and he may or may not have reached out to Sarah for support. All he knew was that she gently but firmly guided his hand back to the camera, gave him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder, and directed him to respond.
“Hm, no, it wouldn’t be, not with the level of activity you’ve been having in that area lately.”
“You’re sure they’re after a fox?”
They were about to start, Irene and Molly sitting at the kitchen table, ready to tell their friend Bill all about how their kitchen sink had clogged up and that they'd called a plumber to fix it, when the door to the flat flew open with a bang.
“I could have told you it was going to snow,” he said, putting one long arm around John and drawing him gently into the warm room.
“But you’re—” John stopped himself before pointing out the obvious royal title. “Why wouldn’t it be you?”
“Do they also say they’ll stop blasting classical music through the walls after this?”
. Mind you, the court case’ll still happen, but it’ll help. I saw John’s blog by the way. Who did those mug cakes?”
“Uh, no thanks,” he choked out. “I’ll leave the hard work to you.”
To his credit, Sherlock did put on speed, donning a convincing set of workman’s coveralls (with nothing but his pants on underneath, because this was porn after all) and a pair of heavy boots. You had to hand it to the man: despite the fact that nobody could possibly be paying attention since the clothes always came off within the first 5 minutes, he always supplied his own costumes with painstaking attention to detail.
“Sherlock, don’t you dare—”
, maybe?”
John shrugged. “In a castle. Walls have ears. Eyes too, I’d wager.”
is at least as odious as
“Bit too late for that,” he said, trying to keep his voice light. “Sarah made sure we packed everything up. And she said—”
“Your cock, John.” Sherlock’s voice was almost a sob as he lifted himself up on his elbows to look at John. “I want your cock.
“Good news for breathing.”
, he thought firmly,
“I’ll manage it. I promise.” John gave her a weak smile. “You can count on me, boss.”
He hadn’t been lying. He
“I don’t blame you for getting distracted,” said Molly, taking John’s attention lapse in stride. She gave Sherlock (lying on his back on the floor, knees up and apart while making a lot of breathy, grunting noises, ostensibly tinkering with the guts of the sink) a not-quite-surreptitious look. “He’s pretty fit, isn’t he?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe,” he said instead, going carefully, fingers deliberately light around the mug of tea. “But I still have a special hatred for
It started with Molly walking into frame, smoothing her crumpled skirt, undoing the zip and pushing it down to her hips so that she was naked for true. As she threw herself onto the sofa, Irene and Sherlock stumbled in from the kitchen, Irene with her blouse fully undone and shoved down to her shoulders, and Sherlock - well,
Now this was just too much. John hadn’t had much of a choice while they were filming, but he was quite thoroughly damned to the quiet, uncomfortable hell of doormats and other iterations of the meek if he let that pass while he was on his own time.
His rational brain recognized this as rank exaggeration, of course. Nobody was going to have to call 999 just yet, but with Sarah instructing him to pan up Sherlock’s body and back down again (
The breath rather went out of John at that. It was on the tip of his tongue to ask Sherlock if he was sure, but he liked to think he was a reasonably intelligent man and it just didn’t make sense to ask that of someone who was encouraging you to squeeze his bare buttocks. Also, having made his point, Sherlock put his mouth on his again, and
“Wouldn’t dream of it. Not with a global pandemic on. And I’m not keen on doing the washing up for four people.”
“Checking on my mules.” John sounded ever so slightly defensive.
