"-absolutely psycho!"
The silence stretched, uninterrupted, until John was fairly squirming in his chair, but Sherlock wasn’t sure how to proceed. He’d had it all planned out, this moment with John. He’d spend hours in his mind palace with John’s counterpart, spewing his vitriol, telling John that he’d been just another conquest. Of course it was all to soothe his wounded ego, Sherlock was aware, but none of it took the sting away nor the knowledge of how he truly felt about John.
A knock on the door startled them all, and Sherlock stepped aside as the homely young, maid delivered the tea service on a tray, which she sat before Mycroft. He dismissed her with a grateful nod and she left quietly, clearly uncomfortable with the silence. No one spoke until the door had fully closed.
The man's eyes widened as Sherlock wrapped a tight grip around his neck and squeezed. Directly behind him, a sharp limb hung out from the tree, strong and sturdy, and before it could happen, John already knew what Sherlock planned to do.
If John were being honest with himself, he'd been asking himself the very same thing and never did find an answer that was satisfactory. Sherlock hadn't lied to him or done anything untoward to John, and he always made it a point to ease John into every new experience, but was that really what Sherlock was asking him?
Steeling himself, Sherlock made a beeline for Billy, grabbing the younger Omega by the scruff of his shirt and hauling him towards the door, intent on throwing the stubborn fool out. "Go home, Billy," he ordered tersely, unable to stomach another fertile Omega in the same vicinity as the Alpha that Sherlock planned on having in his bed in less than five minutes, if things went his way.
Sherlock placed the bag on the desk and began sorting the containers, already sensing John’s sheepish demurral before he’d even spoken a word.
“Clever boy,” he crooned. John groaned, one hand clenching around Sherlock’s cock, while the other clutched his dripping curls in a tight fist. “I’ve missed you.”
As John, this would all be highly inappropriate and borderline insane, but as Lady Grey, the vixen-in-red, the well-versed lover, it was right up her alley and he didn’t want to let this go. What if Sherlock thought that he was boring compared to her? What if John wiped away the make-up and Sherlock was disappointed with what he saw? Though John loved his Lady Grey persona, sometimes he loathed how long of a shadow she cast.
John, an intimidating, steady presence, only watched until the air was thick enough to suffocate them both. "Are you sure this is what you want?"
John shrugged, hoping to dissuade his father from pursuing what only had the potential to become a painfully awkward conversation, and pointedly changed the topic. "Have you heard from Harry lately?"
Mrs Hudson was ambling back into the room shortly thereafter, her aged fingers folded tightly around a key. “That poor boy,” she said, shaking her head lightly, “he has his bad days, dear.” The soft, reminiscent undertone laced with notes of melancholia was oddly jolting to John. How long had Mrs Hudson known Sherlock, and what had she witnessed to make her frown that way? It struck John then, how little he really know about Sherlock. How could he be in so deep and know so very little about that person? Was he falling for Sherlock, the man, or what he represented, or rather, what John
Afterwards, when the heavy breathing and hot panting died down, the slick on their body cooled, John tried to remember a time when there was another that made his heart beat in his chest the way that Sherlock could. If Sherlock decided that John wasn't what he wanted, would John ever find someone else that made his every breath feel sweeter, the ache in his body, so pleasant?
a murder, John. Though, the timing is impeccable.”
John was sleeping like the dead when his phone rang and he was thrust from a fitful sleep into abrupt consciousness. He shot a hand out towards the phone vibrating across the bedside table, and knocked the clock clumsily onto the ground in his haste to silence the noise.
John huffed a breath and dropped back into his seat, tossing the tabloid on the table. "God, I'm so stupid! How've I missed that we were being followed?"
John sat perfectly still, waiting for the moment when he could stretch his feet and forget. Sherlock stalked forward until he came to stand before John, pale gaze sharp and intelligent with knowledge beyond that of any animal. He was sizing John up, circling him,
He remembered Sherlock's words from before, telling him that they couldn't change the past, but he would never apologize for what they did, what they had... Have.
Sherlock's lips traced a narrow path down the line of John's stomach, pausing to dip a curious tongue into his belly button before continuing. John flinched as those lips teased the jut of his hipbones, nothing more than a fleeting caress. Sherlock's curiosity led him further south, his aristocratic nose pressing into John's skin, inhaling and storing away information that John could only guess at. All the while, Sherlock's hands played a dangerous game, teetering on the edge between sensuality and sexuality. Wherever Sherlock placed his mouth, his hands were sure to follow, running and mapping, liquefying John beneath his capable fingers.
John never thought he'd spend the last hour breathless and wondering if this was the best orgasm he would ever have in his life, spread and bound in Sherlock's flat, boneless and falling hard every second of it.
John smiled down at his lap and patted himself on the back for his small victory. "Okay, next question. Why are you so big on this control thing?"
The song changed again, this time, a man, beginning with the dark, ominous repetition of piano chords. It was beautiful, yet a bit macabre in tastes, but a perfect soundtrack to the near reverent stroke of Sherlock's tongue over his cock.
Now, I know this is going a bit slow, but I promise, everything is building up to certain points. Please, be patient with me. A few things for this chapter: I used a few terms or references that might be confusing to some.
Whatever Sherlock expected upon reunion with John, it wasn't this broken, fragile remnant of a man sitting across from him. He’d been fully prepared for a stubborn, tenacious young soldier; someone unapologetic and proud. Yet, everything in John's body language screamed regret like a giant, neon fixture.
John remembered Sherlock's question, his hatred burrowed deep like a parasite.
Sherlock slowed slightly at the words, looking back at John beneath his lashes, his hips now a slow, seductive circle. “You're such a good boy, John, my good boy. I think you've earned it,” Sherlock said, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he smiled down indulgently at John. Sherlock made quick work of the rope and tossed it somewhere in the room without looking. Then, he leaned back on his hand and waved a lazy hand at John to do as he pleased.
Sherlock's head whipped around to Sally, and then followed her gaze to the thick shrub on their left.
Alfie bent down to John's level, and the smaller male sunk back into the skip he was leant against, releasing a tremulous breath as he pulled his horde closer to his body. "Show us what you got, Johnny, and maybe we won't mess wiv ya."
When John's muscles relaxed fully, Sherlock began to thrust in earnest, repeatedly hitting that spot that made his insides crumble like dust. It was much too intense, and John just wanted to reach that pinnacle and take a plunge.
It was horrendous and a nightmare, and John was
John huffed into the phone. God, he sounded like such a child, but at this point, his actions were nearly involuntary. "I'm not- I'm not angry, I just... nothing."
John glowered at Mike. He wanted nothing more than to march back into Holmes Pharmaceuticals and tell Holmes to take his offer and shove it up his arrogant—hmm, but lovely—arse.
John yelped in shock and pain, as his body propelled forward violently into the dirt. He slowly rolled onto his side, dazed and struggling to regain his breath from the sudden onslaught. Sherlock barely afforded him time to recover, pouncing just as soon as John was gaining coherence again, nearly pinning John to the forest floor with sharp, clawed paws.
John could feel Sarah tense against his chest and the way her breathing grew shallow.
“I frequently play the violin, sometimes in the early hours. I chain smoke when I’m thinking, and I have a thing for a little blond man in bondage.”
At night, he rarely slept anymore, though, and when he did, Jasper almost always made a debut. Those green eyes blighted with a sheen of tears, and the betrayal, hurt; never had John thought that anything he did could inflict that sort of pain on anyone.
It was an ambush.
John blinked, feeling his heart sink. He had desperately wanted to speak with Jasper and tell him not to worry, that he wasn't angry with the other boy. John had wanted Jasper to hug him and tell him everything was going to be okay and say something to make the mood lighter.
, was Jim Moriarty. The man looked up, his large brown eyes nowhere near amiable as he smiled.
So his little brother had consummated his relationship with John Watson. Well then, it was just their fortune that Jasper was not as observant. What had Sherlock been thinking, showing up without first cleaning himself up?
John sighed and went to sit on the bed, finding the mattress firm and stiff, unyielding beneath his bum. Oh well, he would make do. John had slept on worse in the military.
“Yes.”
“He only wants to insure your personal well-being, Jasper. At least give him that.”
Before he returned to the room, John headed to the kitchen for a glass of water and froze. Just behind the partition leading out of the kitchen and into the sitting room, John could see a silhouette sitting in Sherlock's chair.
It doesn't last long. The house is filled with a raucous crowd of people, all alarmed by the series of events, and the atmosphere is cluttered with tension. Sherlock is not worried that he will be caught, or else he would have fled the moment he'd been found out.
John cleared his throat at an abrupt idea, hoping that Sherlock would take him up on his offer.
“So,” John murmured. “How’ve you been, then?”
“It means if you aren't planning to forgive him, you shouldn't give him hope,” Sherlock said calmly, unperturbed by Jasper's anger. “If you planned to forgive him, you would have come with me to see him off, especially knowing that it's likely the last time you will ever see him.”
John could already feel the grass kicking up under his feet, the call of the woods whispering notions of freedom into his ears. Jesus, he wanted to run.
Sherlock was striding up ahead, throwing his clothes haphazardly in his wake in the haste to inspect the possible threat of hunters along the southern border of the territory. John's eyes unerringly followed the valley of pale skin between Sherlock's rhomboids as his shirt is tugged up and off, the ripple of trapezius muscles against his back. The way he moves is liquid and graceful, but the wolf pushing to the forefront is deadly and savage, baring Sherlock's teeth in a frightening snarl as he begins to change once again.
Before he could move to block her entrance, the woman threw the heavy wooden doors open, an admirable feat in itself, peering around the room for a glimpse of a tall, pale figure decked out in the usual bespoke.
Sherlock's hips rolled uncontrollably into John's. He was insatiate, compelled by love and other vicious sentiments he wanted nothing more than to spit vitriol at, because they were useless!
"Are we done here," John inquired, voice steady against the icy weight pressed against his sternum. If his words were a bit snappish, well... he couldn't be blamed much for it. Every muscle in his body was tense and on edge, repelled by Irene's very presence. There was something about her that was not on, and John was anxious to have her gone.
Förstner had been clever, aiding the Yard in their investigation to avoid scrutiny, but he hadn't been expecting Sherlock Holmes. That was his downfall.
Jasper crossed his arms over his chest and stared resolutely out the window, his lips twitching downward in a dismayed arc. He had nothing to tell and he hoped to convey that he hadn't wanted to be helped or saved, or whatever his uncle thought that he was doing. “I've nothing to tell,” he responded impassively, despite the urge he felt to scream. He didn't want to go home. He had nothing to say to his father or John.
When the cab finally pulled up at John's building, he quickly paid and jumped out, breathing in the cool night air as he jogged up the steps to his flat. No one was home to greet him when he walked in, though there were empty food wrappers on the table, along with a sink full of unwashed dishes.
John sighed and attempted to tug his hand away, even as his stomach fluttered at the thought. "Sherlock, I'm
"John," Sarah called from the other room, and John broke away from his stupor and left to join his friend in the sitting room.
“I wouldn't think so,” Sherlock said, his voice lower by an entire register, and John blushed because he’d just realized how his last statement could be misconstrued as an innuendo. “After all, I've heard stories of what you army fellows can get up to when bored.”
John shook his head, disappointed in himself for losing his control and kissing the smug bastard. How could he have allowed himself to give in so easily. "First, you infringe upon my lunch with Sarah and work yourself into a snit because you have this barmy idea that I belong to you now that you've employed me! And second, you decided it was a brilliant idea to jump me, here in your office.
John didn't quite know what to do with his free hand, so he placed it on Sherlock's thigh, where it was promptly slapped away.
"There's going to be a lot of people up there who aren't going to want you here, a lot of riled up wolves itching for a fight. We all saw the hunters the night Sherlock came by you in the woods," Lestrade paused and shook his head, looking into John's eyes. "They're all a bit wary now, they think you've led them here and so does the pack leader. Whenever Sherlock is worried, then we all are, so try not to provoke them."
"I don't think I've ever had that much fun before." True to Jasper's words, they had chased a couple of suspects down several alleys and crossed rooftops as shortcuts. It had been amazing and invigorating, and John had felt invincible for the first time in his life.
Sherlock's face was a mosaic of expressions, ranging from intense concentration, to admiration, desperation and arousal. His pale eyes were bright and feverish in the darkness of the room, his skin wet with sweat. John arched up to meet every thrust, throwing his head back in pleasure and pain, and confusion at the clutter of emotion clouding his thoughts. How was he meant to go back to the streets after having a taste of this? This was not supposed to be anything other than gratitudinous sex, but it was immeasurably more than that. This was intimate and frantic, and familiar on so many levels, and the tenderness of it stumped John where he lay.
with curiosity."
It didn't say much for his presumed prescience that Sherlock hadn't deduced John's doubts before he voiced them.
John slid his hands in Sherlock's hair and pulled, delighting at the sensation of Sherlock's cock jerking against his thigh.
It was dust-ridden and stale with time, as well it should be. He hadn’t used the room in ages.
Sherlock barked out a guttural snarl and John leant forward, resting his elbows on his knees as he regarded the man indifferently. “You've got more immediate problems, mate,” he urged, tilting his head towards the giant wolf crouched over the both of them. “You can talk, or…” John glanced at Sherlock, who licked his chops menacingly, then back at the young human. “You can die.”
Sherlock returned the box and baseboard and replaced the whole lot back beneath his sock index, sans riding crop.
"You've done enough for one day, Victor, you will stay here."
"No worries," John smiled, not wanting Jasper to think he was judging him. "Is it just us, then?"
The skin peeled away, and -
John exhaled tremulously, the old, childish urge to wring his hand in his lap, unbearably irresistible. He could almost feel their thoughts, all of them blaming John for bringing this sordid mess down upon their backs. It was a heavy burden to bear, but John was determined not to let them see how much the pack's judgment affected him.
John's father greeted him with his usual quick-witted humour and a tight embrace, which John couldn't stop the urge to melt into.
They were in the confessional, and Sherlock was leaning close enough to the screen that his nose was nearly pressed against it.
John smiled, though wondered if he should be alarmed by that confession. Ordinary people didn't just follow random strangers unless they had it out for them, but then again, this man was turning out to be anything but ordinary.
It was more than he'd expected, and if John were honest with himself, less than he'd deserved. It was short and cutting, and callous. Sherlock was going straight for the jugular, and his aim had been precise. Could he expect any less from a man like Holmes?
. Even the slightest change could have altered his future, and Sherlock may never have become the CEO of his own company and in doing so, never would have met John, either. Victor’s friendship, however, was more than enough.
"You don't understand how much control it takes to refrain from hurting you. I want to hurt you, open you up and take you apart. I know you're close, come for me, John."
Shortly after John left the cafe, he received a text from Sherlock enquiring about preferable venues for dinner, but John didn’t care one way or another as long as it was somewhere they could talk.
Sherlock's fingers were back to his cuffs, toying with the button although it was perfect, just like the rest of his ensemble.
John licked his lips before replying tentatively, "So you fancy me because I understand your son, have I got that bit down?"
Sherlock pulled his eyes away from the lens and whipped his phone out of his pocket.
So John went along, prepared to offer an excuse to leave before the food arrived. Maybe he could tell Jasper he had therapy.
John stared, his eyes switching back and forth between Sherlock's eyes and his mouth, then back again. He thought of his dream of Bill. It was all still so fresh in his mind, then having to bury his mate's body. Sherlock was right; John would have resented Sherlock, and most of all, himself.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective. Yes, the only one in the world, no, I don't work for the police, and yes, I am here on an investigation.”
Jasper scoffed, throwing his head back. "Yes, like shagging John behind my back, how noble of you," the younger Holmes sneered caustically.
The male was the one who held Sherlock's attention. The blond limped up and down the room nervously, balling and releasing his fists in aggravation. His pheromones were strong, but not overbearing, and the smell of them tickled at the edge of Sherlock's senses like a light caress.
With every word that fell from Victor's lips, the glare forming on Sherlock's face grew more vicious. "You idiots wait to tell me now," he hissed in frustration, standing from the table. Mrs. Hudson was just emerging from the kitchen, hands full with steaming dishes, an annoyed Anderson following close behind. "Lestrade, Donovan, with me, now; you as well, John."
Sherlock stared down at his pale hand, flattened over burnished, golden skin, the tip of his fingers tingling where they connected to John. “But perhaps it would be better if we rehashed some old rules.”
“What, Sherlock-,” John began, opening his mouth to admonish the older man. He hadn't even finished his tea yet.
John let his wet finger hover over his lips before dropping his hand to unzip his denims. “All right,” he conceded. Sherlock just gave him a long, hungry look, before his eyes dipped down to watch John's hand as it reached into his pants and released his cock.
"You're so obedient; I could do so much with you, to you. Would you let me, John? Allow me to sodomize you, push you down on your belly and fuck you?"
When he glanced up, Holmes had spotted him as well and whatever he had been saying broke off mid-sentence. His eyes flickered from John to a point behind his shoulder, where they narrowed. The woman he was with stopped and turned as well, lifting a finely pointed brow when she saw John.
Jasper nodded, taking a sip of his own tea before lowering it to his lap. He knew he shouldn't ask, but he was curious. How had their affair escaped him? “When?”
Holmes’ lips parted, but the moment was thwarted as the director called for them to take their places. It was a simple scene. The premise was “after-school studying”, and of course, Molly would be the main focus, though it was bisexual in nature. Some touching was required between John and Holmes, but again, that wasn’t a complaint. John found that he quite enjoyed the cold, crude slant of Holmes’ eyes on his body from where he flanked Molly’s other side.
Sherlock remembered meeting Victor for the first time in Cambridge, when Mycroft hadn’t yet had the clout that a government position provided, and so Sherlock was paired with a dorm mate as per the usual.
Holmes nodded graciously before sitting down again with one last look at John.
When it was over, Sherlock pulled John up and plunged his tongue inside his lover’s devious mouth, tasting himself on John's slick tongue, still salty with the film of Sherlock's semen.
“Miss me?” Sherlock asked, his voice quiet and intimate in the enclosed space. White cotton fell to land on top of the pile, until Sherlock was left standing in only his trousers. One hand massaged his aching hardness, the fullness of his bollocks, over the zip of his trousers.
for their awesome work in helping me get this chapter out. You both are amazing!
Sherlock sat on his calves, legs spread and dick heavy with blood. He manoeuvred John’s legs to flank his own, then positioned his cock at John's entrance.
“John!” He called as he shrugged his coat off and hung it on the rack beside the door.
Sherlock cleared his throat awkwardly, which John found endearing. He could see why phone conversations weren't to Sherlock's usual taste. It seemed goodbyes were the most uncomfortable part for him.
Puppy, as ridiculous as he looked in his cotton towel and bare feet, was admirably steady in his gaze. “Why are you here,” he asked, and it was
Though John was aware that Mycroft didn't know the extent of their journey, he still felt the hot boil of anger at the man's words. There was nothing foolish or reckless about wanting to bury the dead. It was certainly nothing to be taken lightly where wolves were concerned, and gratefully, Sherlock understood that. John wasn't so sure that Mycroft would.
“Milking me, you naughty boy,” Sherlock chuckled, the sound breaking off into a moan as John reached behind himself to grab Sherlock’s cock and rubbed the slick head against his hole. “You’re going to make me come and I want to be inside you.”
*MRC is the Medical Research Council. They are over scientific research in the UK.
John knew what they looked like. Two estranged lovers coming together after being apart for too long, and in a way, John thought maybe that was what was happening. They had never been lovers, but closer than, without the added intimacy. John nodded.
Jasper's bespectacled green gaze flickered from John's eyes, to his lips and back, his own parted just a sliver. John could feel his face heating, and knew the tips of his ears had gone pink. He was so close, too close to what he had been dreaming of for more than a year now, and if he just leaned forward a little...
Sherlock lowered his head, covering the tiny smile pulling at his lips, as he dug into the kit for the supplies he would need. “Yes, well, if you're asking whether I'm a sociable person - no. People aren't my area and if I spent all my time mincing words, I would never get anything done.”
John swallowed, taken aback by the malice and hostility in the man's voice. He hadn't thought about what his plan of action would be if he lived, but at this moment, John was more worried about staying alive now that he had been captured.
At that moment, he didn't care that Holmes was devouring every expression, every thought that flew across his mind. John would bitch out about it later with Sarah over some Hobnobs and a cuppa, but for now, he relished the fervour in which Holmes regarded him.
They sank to the ground without breaking their embrace, and one of Sherlock's hands was already tugging at John's clothes.
Before Mycroft could speak, the pack was entering the room again, this time, carrying loaded backpacks. Everyone traveled lightly, apparently.
John wanted to say, wanted to push Sherlock on his back over the bare floor, climb over his supine body and sink down on the erection pressed against his navel.
Sherlock’s voice was steadily rising, but the anger could no longer be contained. He felt it like a second skin, roiling over his body like bubbling oil, burning him alive.
John was knackered; sleep beckoned him with heavy grasping fingers but he didn't want to sink into that oppressive darkness again. Nothing good ever came from sleep these days. It had become a vicious cycle to sleep a few hours and wake throughout the night in a state of fear and panic. John's dreams became a revolving door of drug addicts, alcoholics and missing fathers, and eventually at some point or another, they all meet a certain death that he is useless to stop.
John made it with ten minutes to spare, but Sherlock was already there, waiting off to the side of the door as the cab pulled up to the kerb. When John stepped out, Sherlock slipped his phone into one of the many pockets of his coat and bestowed John with a courteous smile, though his eyes were less than as they glided over John's frame unrepentantly.
He made quick work of washing up with the flower scented hand soap, scrubbing his body with deft, clinical hands. At this point, it was just a tool to get what he needed to survive; if he wanted to live, that was how he had to look at the situation. The cool water nipped his skin, but John ignored it, focusing instead on the expanse of clean skin left in place of grime. The water, where the basin drained, was dark, and combined with the soap, sludgy and thick.
With more trouble than he'd expected, John pushed himself out of the bench and stumbled outside, excusing himself when he'd stepped on a few feet on the way to the exit.
He pretended not to hear, eyes closed and bones useless. He was still catching his breath.
Video of the army advert John watched
John swallowed, staring down at their joined hands. “You don't know that.”
Abruptly, Sherlock pulled back, breathing hard as he ran a hand through his slick curls. John was a mess before him, laid out indecorously, and probably blushing from head to toe. Without breaking their connection, Sherlock leant over and pulled his drawer out. He must’ve known precisely where everything was placed, because he didn’t even have to rummage around before his hand emerged wrapped tight around a tube of lubricant.
Sherlock encircled him in his arms, his cheek resting upon the silken strands of John’s hair. It could have been days, hours, minutes that they sat there holding onto one another, before John’s tremors finally subsided. It was as if John had drained every ounce of energy from Sherlock’s body. He could hardly bring himself to move, or maybe it was that he didn’t dare release John for fear that he’d crumble and crack into pieces. The food hadn’t arrived yet and it was getting late, but Sherlock didn’t want to leave him alone. Not with a loaded gun and the shadow of his dreams still lingering behind those haunted eyes.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped low, squeezing at the sight of John’s nose dipping into the coarse, cognac curls at the base of his erection. “Look at me,” he demanded, voice stripped raw, ragged and sharp-edged. “Look at me when you put my cock in your mouth. I want to see your lips stretched around me.”
He returned to the living room and joined John on the couch, though kept a respectable distance between them, and held out the photos.
So long, Baker Street.
Molly is clever, and finds an incriminating note that merely cements her accusation against Lestrade, and never once does John object. John was not an idiot by any means. He'd known who was behind it all along, but like the good little boy Sherlock knew he was, he'd kept their little secret, and played the game.
Every touch sent him through the clouds and the power of those muscles beneath his fingertips made John's cock fill with blood.
“Yes, at least give me that,” a new voice cut in. Mycroft only sighed at his brother’s tendency towards theatrics. Now that he was so close, Mycroft could observe his brother better.
John did as he was told, closing his eyes as he waited for the inevitable caress of silk to render him temporarily blind. A moment later, and he wasn't disappointed as Sherlock tied the blindfold off snugly, but comfortably at the back of his head.
“Half that, Mycroft. A few hundred people may be nothing for you in your “minor government” position, but labour here is satisfactory, and I’ve not had one complaint since we’ve acquired a full roster.” Sherlock leaned back in his chair and steepled his hands beneath his chin, his hard gaze trained on the man opposite him. “Cut one-fifty, but that’s all I’ll allow you. The rest are useful.”

John did as bade, tossing his gun off the side, tracking it across the room where it slid to the corner.
John’s brows were furrowed and he’d gone still, hunched over his lap like a gargoyle atop a cathedral. Apt simile, in Sherlock’s opinion. John’s body was a sacred place, and Sherlock longed to touch him again, be granted entrance into the walls of his body, his mind, everything.
John knew the exact second Sherlock returned from his introspection. His eyes focused with a laser-like intensity onto John, pinioning him to the couch with paralyzing capability. Sherlock no longer appeared overwhelmed by the sensations; now he was the predator, prowling over John, lips stalking over his jutting erection with tantalizing puffs of air.
He stayed there for a moment longer, reminiscing, before he remembered the John downstairs that he had a responsibility for.
John pulled himself from his introspection and carried on with his morning rituals. When he returned to his room, John was pleasantly surprised to see that it was no longer unoccupied.
“Morning,” said Greg, and hurried to the kitchen without making eye contact. Maybe if he didn't acknowledge it, then neither would Sherlock.
At last, the sonata faded away, as did the sensation of wondering fingers.
Sherlock's lips met his only to tear away, then back again, softer than before in a tortuous cycle. John caught Sherlock's plush, bottom lip between his teeth before he could lift away, running his tongue over the wet skin. Between Sherlock's ministrations and emotions running rampant, John's insides were trembling with adrenaline and euphoria. He could almost believe that the last twenty-four hours hadn't happened, and that Sherlock hadn't revealed a less than refined side of himself, but then the moment wouldn't be what it was.
The slant of light through his window hinted at an overcast mid-morning, and the noises of thriving Westminster were just beginning to trickle through the gaps in the sill.
When it was all over, John seemed speechless, and Sherlock was watching for any reaction.
“I can hear it in how you speak sometimes, you know. That need to command, to take charge.”
Sherlock wrapped his hand around a thin wrist and gently tugged.
Mycroft.
dressed as Lady Grey.
Sherlock panted, dropping his head against John's shoulder. His breath pushed out in hot puffs of air against the smaller man's shoulder. John slumped back against the tree, though Sherlock's trembling arms still held his thighs captive.
His teenage years weren’t all that happy following his multitude of reckless decisions, but Sherlock could never bring himself to delete any of it.
Molly crawled over and helped him lick away the remnants.
Sherlock removed the riding crop, but he still had one more thing to look for. This, he’d purchased when he still held out hope that he’d hear from John again, even when it had been years since. By that point, he was simply coping; it had been a weak, maudlin moment. Now, Sherlock kept it because the mere thought of selling it back felt too much like surrender.
Reluctant though John was to disconnect, he obeyed and removed his fingers, awaiting the next order. And just for the hell of it, John slid a cheeky finger up Sherlock's erection, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's.
John smiled brightly, longing to experience that kind of excitement for once in his life. What must it be like to live with Sherlock Holmes?
Before Harry had allowed the vices to take over her life, she'd been close with John, and in a way, it felt like losing a twin. They were two years apart, but age didn't matter when they were once able to talk to one another about anything. The last time John had laid eyes on his sister was Christmas dinner the year prior, high on whatever and drunk off her arse, pale and wraithlike. John's mum had been inconsolable, and his father, flushed and wide-eyed with fear and the pain of watching his only little girl slipping away. John would never forget that.
John followed hurriedly behind her, unsure what he was meant to do, or if this was a regular occurrence. For all John knew, Irene was Sherlock's business partner, or lover, or whatever weird arrangement the man was sure to have. All of it was completely frustrating.
What could have been an hour since they’d left the cabaret, Sherlock led John past a darkened cafe and to a black-lacquered door with shining brass numbers: 221. With a patience and tranquillity that John knew Sherlock couldn’t possibly feel, the man pulled a set of keys from his coat pocket and unlocked the door with steady fingers.
Feel free to join me on
," he breathed.
John watched cautiously as she swaggered towards him, all sexual undertones and secretive smiles. When she stopped in front of him, one red-lacquered nail came up to tease the line of his jaw. "I'm quite sure Sherlock doesn't know what to make of you yet, but I've dealt with my fair share of boys like you, before."
“I want to forgive you,” Sherlock whispered, hoping that John would understand. “I want you to stay, but I need you to understand…”
Mycroft was silent, a moment too long for Sherlock as he pulled at his hair, thinking, thinking, he had to
"Mike," John grumbled, eyeing his friend who looked too awake for whatever-the-fuck o' clock. "
"Shut up."
Sebastian didn't have to do anything as tawdry as draw a gun to command compliance, but Jim relished the surprise on Puppy's face when he noticed the weapon in Sebastian’s waistband.
Mycroft’s put-on indolence was annoying, and Sherlock had better things to do than watch the fool wear holes in his floor.
Sherlock only confirmed John's assumption with a contemptuous "Oh, piss off, Mycroft."
Slowly, he slipped his hand into the larger one held out for him, and allowed Sherlock to pull him up and off the couch. Without further ado, Sherlock lead John to hallway a with two doors; one to the left of them, and one, also, directly at the end of the hall.
Unable to respond, Sherlock turned his back to Mycroft and stalked to the window.
Sherlock was beside him before his brain could process what he’d seen.
"Last night was only a taste of what I have in store for you, John. Everything else you may believe is irrelevant."
John huffed a laugh and leant his head back onto a broad shoulder. “How did you know?”
"Who said anything about average?"
“If the brother has a green ladder, then there is your suspect,” Sherlock stated, shrugging on his coat. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I must be going.”
Did Jasper just hit him with a pillow? Another hit came before John was ready, and he pulled down the cover and glared at the energetic teen currently pelting him with a sodding pillow! "Jasper, you berk, cut it out!" Jasper only laughed and hit him square in the mouth with the pillow.
His head felt light, airy, ascending somewhere unreachable as rationality stepped outside of his grasp. His chest was tight, stomach clenched, cock unbearably confined. Well, at least one of those could be fixed.
Irene threw her head back in a dramatic laugh that stretched her pale throat into a long, tantalizing line. If John wasn't so annoyed by her presence, maybe he would have found it an attractive display. "Of course you don't, dear. Forgive me if I'm being a bit cryptic. I really can't fault you for your ignorance on the matter."
John couldn't look away from those sharp eyes, wondering if Sherlock could see all the hurt and anger, the truth and lies and the admiration he was currently feeling. "But you, John, you haven't asked for a thing and I could already see Jasper already on the edge of giving everything he has to you." Sherlock leaned closer, bow lips skirting slowly against the line of his jaw. "I know what you're doing to him, because I can feel it, too."
It was sometime past midnight when John heard a noise from the woods. It hadn't been loud, and John would have mistaken it for an animal had Sherlock not leaped up immediately, his metaphorical – but soon to be literal – hackles raised as his eyes scanned the foliage.
John's knees around his ribcage might as well have been vices. Sherlock couldn't breathe so he took back his oxygen from John's lips. He thrust a hand between the mattress and John's head, latched onto his fair strands and pulled until that mouth was gaping and slick. Being inside him again triggered that incremental descent into insanity, a sluggish trickle like honey tipping out of a jar. He’d felt it before, that intensity that he knew he'd experience every time with John.
When the tea was done, John put it on a tray along with three cups, sugar and a bit of milk before he took it to the living room and sat it down on the table. John poured his own cup, before getting comfortable in the chair with the plaid blanket thrown over it. Taking a sip, he breathed a sigh of relief, feeling soothed by the taste. When he glanced up, two pairs of eyes were watching him expectantly.
John hissed, head thrown back as if in offering to Sherlock’s hungry lips. Sherlock began a slow descent, sliding his lips across the slope of John’s chin and down his neck. John’s throat bobbed, and Sherlock traced the movement with his tongue.
“Don’t see why not,” he replied, standing to accept a robe from a crew member.
Sherlock couldn't watch John die again… That would be…
Sherlock didn't look up, kept his eyes on his partner, the only one he had eyes for. If John was himself, he would have teased him for being sentimental and then Sherlock would have kissed him because he could. It pained him that he couldn't.
“John,” Sherlock said softly, his mercurial eyes growing wary.
Across from him, Mycroft shifted, just a chafing of cloth, noise to attract John's attention, once more. "You know, when my family found out that Sherlock had a child on the way, we tried to convince him to look into adoption. Jasper's mother was an addict, as was Sherlock at the time. They were both young and foolish, allowed their flesh to guide them through the high, and eleven months later, a few months following Jasper's birth, Irene was gone. Picked up by a gentlemen who promised her vast fortune and power." Mycroft's eyes were dark and far away as he recounted a part of Sherlock's past that John hadn't been privy to, before.
. Of course he wouldn't have put the same pants on from the night before. John nearly came thinking about Sherlock walking round London with no pants underneath. How had he not noticed?
Sherlock looked up sharply, regarding this younger John with stark intensity. It almost had the same uncomfortable atmosphere as their first dinner together at Angelo's. “Are you what?”
He nearly keened at the feel of John’s greedy arse swallowing him and John’s tortured moan, the sweetest sound he hadn’t heard for too long. The noise rattled around in his mind like an echo chamber, fueling his hunger.
John snickered at his text. Coy didn't suit him, there was no part of him that was shy or even keen on teasing, but with Sherlock, it felt like foreplay. The build up was phenomenal, knowing that in the end, Sherlock would most likely own up to everything he threatened to do. What would it hurt if John riled him up a little?
John nodded. Of course he would agree.
John sighed and pulled in a deep breath, lips pursing as he fought to stop the tears.
He’d thought that purging John out of his life would be conducive to the Work, and the attempt had been disastrous. So, he started self-medicating, then there were the men—by-products of John. In fact, he was due to see one that very evening. Only then could he think again, could function, even if not at one-hundred percent.
John closed his eyes. “Sherlock—”
"Mr. Holmes, I have a Greg Lestrade here to see you." John thanked the gods his voice was steady over the line, even though Sherlock's deep baritone had his heart doing a 5k race inside his chest.
He stretched languorously atop his sheets, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips as he snuggled down into his pillow. John could stay in bed for the rest of the nigh-
Sherlock’s brow furrowed as he closed the door and locked it before he shucked off his coat and hung it on the rack. “Obvious. Why do you ask?”
John pulled away to breathe, groaning loudly into the otherwise stillness of the flat, and Sherlock used the moment to bring one hand up to fist his blonde strands, straining John's neck to bare, arched and blushed a deep, sinful red.
The emotions behind those eyes were constantly shifting, despite Sherlock's automaton appearance. John didn't squirm beneath that scrutinizing gaze, merely stared back, beseeching with his eyes, for Sherlock to change his mind. John didn't want to be responsible for this death. He already had too much blood on his hands; he was drowning in it.
Sherlock was unhappy. That particular thought latched onto John's mind and grew limbs.
So John took one quivering breath and told his story.
Anderson piped up in bitter inquiry, asking the question that was surely plaguing everyone's thoughts. "And just where are we to go, now?"
"You need the money, I need the assistance. You find me interesting, and plan on accepting my proposal. I find you exceptional and would like to keep you around. You're not exactly skilled in the field, but you're willing to learn, you're loyal and discreet, and so far, have been wonderful at taking orders. Need I say more?"
They’d already washed, but neither of them was in a rush to move, content to enjoy the closeness they shared.
John was flaccid, stomach speckled with semen, though most of it had washed away.
The man obeyed immediately. Sherlock's curtness did not surprise him; this was what he did for a living, but Sherlock didn't miss the goose pimples on his skin, or the way his chest rose and fell excitedly. The man's eyes flicked up to meet his, watching Sherlock watch him, but Sherlock broke the stare and focused on the swaths of skin being revealed as each article of clothing found a temporary place at his feet. The escort had a similar build to John's, though his hips were more tapered and his arse, firmer. The only workout John had ever received was during their intercourse. Sherlock imagined that to be a different case now. The army needed their men strong, and Sherlock needed John healthy enough to get through battle and return to English soil, where at least they would be in the same country again.
Sherlock would have her by the end of the night.
"John," Lestrade nods, balancing the white stick precariously between his middle and forefinger. Between the encounter with the hunters and Sherlock's spontaneous declaration, Lestrade appears to have aged a decade. His voice is rough and quiet, belying his dark reflections, and John could see the crow's feet pulling at the edges of Lestrade's eyes as he squints out into the darkness. "All right?"
Anger and relief warred within her. She had no time to prepare to send her son off to a war. Is a mother ever ready to give her child up if there’s a chance she would never see them again?
Sherlock sucked in a breath and stood.
“Ouch, careful,” John winced as Sherlock’s hand jostled the mattress beneath his wounded shoulder.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
Lestrade drove him home because Sherlock didn't want to see John, didn't want his last memory of his partner as just another cold corpse in the morgue. That wasn't his John. The body would be buried and become food for other organisms and cease to be John Watson.
He turned a quick corner, jogging to cross the busy intersection before the light changed. In his peripheral, the CCTV loomed ominously, following his progress until he ducked into an alley, out of sight. Jasper was in an unfamiliar part of the borough, which he hadn't thought possible. He’d traveled much of London with his father for the simple reason that Sherlock didn't want him to call if he ever got lost. Getting lost is tedious, his father would say, and that it's important that Jasper knows his surrounding at all times. That way, if he stumbled across a good murder, Jasper would know the proper directions to relay over the phone.
Sherlock was standing by the window, looking down over Baker Street like a watchful guardian.
John tapped down the contact menu until he reached the words 'Mum', and pressed the call button. The phone rang for a good minute, but John knew to wait. She would answer eventually.
Jim saw Sherlock's weakness and loathed him for it, and now, Puppy was an unforgivable sign of just how much Sherlock needed to be reminded of their time together.
Mycroft raised his chin with a subtle hint of indignation, though his knowing gaze didn’t waver. He balanced the umbrella beside his gracefully crossed legs and grasped the handle with one hand over the other, patient and immovable.
John pressed his feet to the small of Sherlock's back, encouraging the man to go deeper, press harder. "It's all right," he murmured, breaking the kiss, "I won't break. Fuck me."
to know why he was calling. Even if he already knew.
John laughed bitterly, ignoring the turn in his stomach at Lestrade's revelation. "If that's him liking someone, I would certainly not want to be hated by him."
John thought for a moment, but couldn't, for the life of him, remember what the man was asking about. “What?”
, Lestrade, and why is it in my flat?"
John tried not to shiver from his ominous response. It felt more like a warning to the young man and he'd rather heed it than to play with fire. If cooperating is what Sherlock wanted, he would get it. John didn't want a confrontation. "Right."
It was automatic, without inflection. The words simply came and Sherlock was just the conduit. It was an out of body experience. He was wherever John was at the moment, floating between life and a dark abyss.
He unclipped the garter belts from the top of the stocking and hooked his fingers beneath the edge. Slowly, reverently, Sherlock pulled the silk down John’s legs, then bent to kiss each patch of revealed skin. With a hand cupping John’s ankle, Sherlock ran his tongue up the calf, doling out intermittent nips the further up he went. At his inner-thigh, Sherlock gripped the skin between his teeth and sucked in a way that he knew would elicit a response from the man above him.
“John, I promise. The moment I'm sure, you'll be the first to know,” Sherlock assured softly. He closed the distance between them and cupped John's face with gentle hands. “I won't let them get away with what they've done to your pack. We’ll tear them limb from limb. Together.”
The ride to the office building was mercifully brief. Sherlock directed the cabbie to pull into his personal entrance in the underground car park, relieving him from enduring any social interactions until he was safely on the top floor.
Then he remembered what he’d been carrying up the stairs before they were interrupted by John's parents. The riding crop he’d bought just for John.
Sherlock pointed his tongue and buried it inside of him, his breath hot on John’s hole as he panted. Sherlock had unzipped his trousers and released his cock from his pants, and if John tilted his head just a bit, he could see it hard, and red, bobbing up against his shirt as he brought John to the brink and back with his lecherous mouth.
The child fussed a little and Sherlock laid down beside him, placing a hand lightly on his back, feeling it move with John's breaths. He hadn't forgotten Lestrade's presence, merely blocked it out in lieu of giving John all of his attention.
“Oh, fuck! Fuckfuckfuck,” John groaned hoarsely as Holmes pressed in especially hard just when that shudder reached his groin.
One swipe of Sherlock's thumb over the head of his penis and that exploratory tongue licking a drop of sweat off his back, and John was coming hard enough to hit his own chin with semen. He clamped down viciously around Sherlock's prick and the alpha cried out. Sharp, prickly nails dug into John's waist, but the pain only added to the pleasure.
Sherlock rose to retrieve the medical kit from the bedroom and returned to see Lestrade shrugging on his coat.
There's no way this person would have been able to send Sherlock a message unless they’d somehow made contact before burning down his den. Or maybe he’d found something at the house… But if that were the case, wouldn't he have shared it?
, and sure enough, the fly landed on the piece of toast and probably threw up on it. So along with John's morning cuppa, there went his sodding toast, but all of that didn't matter because his sorry mug made the morning paper
clever, doctor."
everything in those seconds of pain and a pleasure so intense his eyes were watering.  His arms were burning from the strain and John had never thought himself quite flexible enough to be spread in such a way, but he'd be damned if Sherlock stopped now.
John retired to his room, a small crowded area that felt even more so now that he'd been in the grandeur of Holmes's office building. He had to keep his room tidied and things put away to make more room for himself.
Now, the very thought of intimacy with Moriarty repulsed, even as his cleverness still begrudgingly awed him in turn.
John peered out the window, noticing that they were moving in a slow crawl down the same street he'd been picked up on. How many times had they gone round the same block without him even noticing?
(See the end of the chapter for
"I feel like there's something you aren't saying," he said under his breath, needing to get it out, yet a part of him hoped that Holmes hadn’t heard him.
When they finally stopped for the night, they were kilometers away from their cabin. It would be at least a day for humans to catch up to them on foot. Sherlock felt they had an adequate head start.
“Jasper,” John breathed, feeling as if all the air was knocked out of him. “God, look at you.”
John peered at his reflection. He was a right mess. There were bags under his eyes, not ridiculously heavy, though he appeared tired and worn. His hair was a chaotic halo about his head, flattened on one side from the pillow. For having had such an awful night, John's dark blue eyes were disconcertingly clear and excited.
Before John could go far, Sherlock's hand darted out to catch John's sleeve. He was wearing one of Sherlock's shirts. “Wait, please. I'll- I'll explain everything.”
“Nearly drove me mad half the time―”
(See the end of the chapter for
After a moment, the door was opened by an unassuming older gentleman. He was wearing blue coveralls and his wiry grey hairs peaked from beneath a black fleece cap. He offered a mild grin and stepped away from the door invitingly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes to look up at him, his tongue darting out for a long, lecherous taste. “Mm,” he moaned, pitching his voice low and deep. “Spread your legs.”
Now they were laid out on their sides, facing one another and neither of them willing to look away first.
John shrugged, pulling himself from his reverie and going to sit in the chair Sherlock hovered next to.
"What's with this retro wardrobe, John," Sarah quipped disapprovingly in John's general direction, from the damp, dark abyss that was the back of his closet. His only answer to that was a two finger salute at the back of her pretty little head.
John's tongue made a maddeningly slow revolution around the rim of Sherlock's anus, before dipping in again, lapping up his essence with furtive flicks.
Lady Grey’s fingers were scraping against his scalp as his hips thrusts under hers, almost to the point of pain, but Sherlock didn’t care. She could do what she wanted to him, and Sherlock would be helpless to stop her.
John paused, meeting her mischevious eyes in the glass of the vanity. “Battle dress?” He enquired suspiciously.
Sherlock failed to think of a response as a waiter stopped at the table to offer them bread, wine, and a menu with no prices listed. Not inexpensive, then.
There was no word for the depths to which his stomach plunged, nor the ache in the centre of him that reached on endlessly. John had taken himself somewhere that Sherlock would never be able to touch him, escaped, as if residing in a place where Sherlock Holmes might find him was unbearable. Not only that, but John was putting himself in harm's way. It killed him to know that the last memory of John could very well be of anger and betrayal.
He smirked, and then Lady Grey was standing between his legs, one knee on his thigh and her hands in his hair, tilting his head up for a sinful kiss.
Mycroft stepped into the room with a sense of imperiousness that made Sherlock’s skin prickle, and his teeth grit. Everything about him screamed superiority, from the delicate tap of his ridiculously expensive umbrella on the lacquered wood, to the soft swish of chafing cashmere. Mycroft’s keen gaze drifted around the room with painstaking intensity, and Sherlock noted as his brother’s eyes zeroed in on even the minuscule changes. Always watching, frustratingly omniscient. Sherlock wanted him gone.
John was dying. Again.
Mike wasn't making any attempt to mask his own glee at the idea. He practically vibrated with awakened energy at what John could only properly call a disaster in the making. "John, how did
Their teeth were clashing and more than once, John had dealt a sharp nip to Sherlock's lips. Sherlock moaned against his lips, enjoying the feel of his legs wrapped tightly round John's waist.
"Our Sherlock seems quite fond of you, must be if he is bringing you here. He rarely ever brings anyone round, and never looks at them the way I've spotted him looking at you." She pauses briefly. "Just do me a favor and keep an eye on him. Victor and I used to, but then... things changed, so..." Ella sighed wistfully.
He unfolded the letter.
(See the end of the chapter for
John was delirious with lust and near tears as he was continually denied his climax.
Sherlock remembers.
Everything in him wanted to taste and touch, to feel that little body beneath his hands. John's pink cheeks and pubescent body were like a siren song to Sherlock. Why should he deny himself this temptation?
While John’s presence had certainly thrown a spanner into the works, Sherlock still had a multi-million pound business to run and no one else would do it for him. It was either the Work or less savoury options to get him back on track, but now that John was back, one of those simply wouldn’t do.
Where other people may have found it odd when Sherlock deduced them, John rather enjoyed it. It was certainly different not to have the usual mundane questions thrown at him, like, “How was your day?” or his all time favourite, “What are your hobbies?”.
Sherlock stared, shaking his head slowly, distantly as he stared at the younger male. How could… overnight?
Sherlock raised a fist and rapped with his knuckles.
John sat on his heels and waited, unsure if he should proceed, reluctant to embarrass himself. He'd never had his mouth on another man's cock, but Sherlock's eyes on him were surprisingly stabilizing.
Sherlock Holmes was going to be the death of him.
John was nearly driven insane by the itch tingling just beneath his skin. He craved the change, but the captive werewolf wouldn't dare transform while under the reluctant care of the unusual man he had encountered upon waking.
John didn't think it was possible for Sherlock to get any closer, but the man leaned directly into his face, pinning eyes on him alight with a vicious gleam. "Oh no, threats are tedious. I am promising you."
"I'm not yours to keep," John replied defiantly, coming to stand in the center of the room with Sherlock so as to even the playing field. All this looming over him was starting to become irksome. He wasn't fooled by the man and his fake smiles. He saw the darkness in Sherlock's eyes.
John gestured in an 'as you like' motion, and Sherlock helped him up from the bed, taking most of his weight and he wrapped a strong arm round John's waist.
John froze, inhaling sharply as his head whipped around to Sherlock, the blood in his veins running cold. He was no longer poised over his phone as he was before. Sherlock was staring at him, but again, it was with the same unnatural stillness as before. His eyes cut through the fog like headlights, piercing cyan circles that drew the breath from John's lungs. When had Sherlock moved?
“Look at you, so needy,” Sherlock tutted, standing before John, his crotch at eye-level. He invaded his space, grabbing the back of John's head and leading his reddened face to Sherlock's bulging trousers. “You have no idea what it's taking not to shove my dick inside of your pretty pink mouth.”
cited?
The restaurant they stopped at was nowhere near as fancy as he pictured Sherlock Holmes's fare to be. He'd instructed the driver to take them to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Chinatown, where they proceeded to stuff themselves silly with dim sum, all the while, giggling like school girls and shooting one another coy looks across the table.
No, they would just have to make due where they were.
As expected, in John's shitty mood, it chafed. "Yes well, in response to your text, I didn't feel like waiting around for you remember that you had a guest."
.” Sherlock crawled forward in the small space until his chest was pressed against John's knees and he was leaning forward on his hands. “No, sex isn't a priority, but that's not to say that the idea hasn't crossed my mind many times.”
"You don't know anything, you don't! Why don't you just leave!" John pulled at her hands around his neck, struggling against her hold and trying desperately to filter air through his trachea. "I hate you! None of this would be happening if it weren't for you!"
The absence of both her daughter Harriet and John was crippling. There was never a day she didn’t devote hours to trailing back and forth between the shrines of her children’s rooms, thinking of a time when there were two giggling toddlers shouting through the walls. Guilt and longing ravaged her insides and kept her mind near constantly preoccupied. She could think of little else but her children.
Ella reached up to peck Sherlock on the cheek and did the same for John, to his pleasant surprise. "Bring him round again, soon. We'll make it a proper get together," she said, pointing a stern finger at Sherlock, who shrugged noncommittally.
John's costume for the last scene (Irene's battle dress),
Playlist:
Again, John's phone began to go off and he rose to make his way to the bedroom, but the knock on the door stopped him in his tracks.
Miss Vicky straightened her back and crossed her freckled arms over her chest. “Hm, I won’t be satisfied until I hear the answer I want to hear, which is that you let him pull down those knickers and taste that lovely pri-”
John tipped his hips up as Sherlock's finger curled around the band of his garter belt and knickers, his lips parted on jagged breaths. The hand in Sherlock's hair grasped tightly as did the one tangled in the sheets. The last defense, the last remnant of Lady Grey pooled at John's feet in a puddle of dark lace. At last, Sherlock met John Watson.
John didn't have a moment alone until Lestrade had him comfortably settled into his temporary accommodations. It wasn't a terribly large room, but big enough for one to move around without bumping into furniture. There was a twin bed pushed up against the far wall, a plain white quilt and bedding folded neatly at the end. The windows had been boarded up with wood slats, so minimal natural light entered into the room besides a few slant rays peeking through the gaps. The only source of light was a reading lamp that sat on a side table beside the bed, illuminating only the immediate area.
Sherlock couldn’t believe his ears.
It was the highest compliment that Sherlock had ever given him, and John relished it like a good cup of tea, letting the words play over in his mind.
The next scene began with Molly riding John’s cock, facing the camera. She was snug and warm around him, and Holmes was alternating between her pussy and John’s cock, slurping loudly from his position between John’s legs as he sucked and licked.
John waited until the man had backed away a few feet before grabbing for the bowl. He was starving. The past few days he had been running from the hunters and the hunger hadn't set in yet. It was just a simple sausage and beans, but John found himself devouring it without delay. God, he felt like he could cry, the feeling of relief was so overwhelming. Shoving another handful into his mouth, John made to snatch the cup up with his unoccupied right hand, and swallowed as much water as he could manage.
"My good boy," Sherlock praised, and the rumble of his voice was enough to have John's hip twitching towards the sound. Sherlock staid him with a firm hand pressed against John's lower abdomen, the other stretching a rubber cock ring round the base of his cock. When he was finished, Sherlock sat back and appraised John with keen, gleeful eyes, one hand moving to massage the hardness straining against his own trousers. "The ring won't stop you from having an orgasm, but it will prolong your experience," Sherlock assured him. Dark lashes fluttered against blush-stained cheeks, Sherlock's eyelids drooping low as he watched John struggle to stay in control, keep his desires at bay. It was near impossible with Sherlock staring at him in that manner. Sherlock was losing the battle with his own needs.
John flicked his eyes up to meet Sherlock’s, swirling blue pools, lovely and oscillating in the dimly lit room. “You can come in if you like.”
He curled up with the cool wood pressing coolly through his shirt. His chest was hurting, imploding and his head swam.
It was a startling revelation.
A dark-skinned woman - a professional dancer, by the look of the toned muscles of her thighs and arms - clutched the bars with both hands and stepped forward into the spotlight, unsmiling.
“Well, that was quite a bit later than I expected,” Mycroft crooned, the smarmy git. “Don’t tell me you had another visit with the doctor, and by visit I mean-”
Lestrade narrowed his eyes, and John thought about telling the man that he was only the messenger. "You tell that prat to get out here; we have business to attend to. There's been another one."
Sherlock left work and ordered his driver to an address in the heart of the city. Hiding in plain sight, this building, with its dated masonry and old world feel. No one would think that a place like this was right under their nose.
The tea on the table was long gone cold and the draft in the room went unnoticed, because John didn't have the brain capacity to respond accordingly to the goose pimples breaking out over his skin or the rising dread crawling up his spine like a tremor.
By the third round, John was feeling lighter, and his belly was warm from the ale. Slowly, thoughts of Sherlock became fuzzy and scattered, until the only thing left was the memory of how he felt standing behind him. That long, lithe body, and John's urge to touch, pull, shove, grab, take. God, he wanted the man, but Sherlock wasn't there, and suddenly, John wanted so urgently for him to be.
Mike glared at John over the rim of his specs, eyes bleary with exhaustion. "I had to come back," he sniffed. "Kate was smothering me. I couldn't take one more bowl of vegetable soup."
“Sherlock you didn’t have to―”
Sherlock nodded. “Trousers, front left pocket.”
He pulled him close, the tears in John’s eyes finally spilling over the cup of his lower lids as he brought him forward to rest his head on his shoulder. John didn’t wail or sob, but Sherlock felt the entirety of his body tremble, the quiver of his breath wet on Sherlock’s neck. John hands held tightly to the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, before they slid up to grip his shoulders, shaking.
John stepped closer, cocking his head to the side in an aggressive stance, and Sherlock watched, feeling a quiver in his abdomen, a tiny flutter that made him blink in confusion. "Oh really, then," John enquired with forced calm. "Tell me, what do you 'see'." The emphasis on the word was mocking, but Sherlock could see that his reluctant client was curious.
Her lips parted with the words, gleaming white teeth flashing as she enunciated the lyrics of her song.
Sherlock huffed an explosive breath against John’s nape, circling John’s neck with his arm as he added another finger. He used his forearm to tilt that blond head back and bury his nose in it, the very scent of him making Sherlock’s stomach tighten with want. His face and neck grew hot, head pounding in time with the rush of blood beneath his skin.
Jasper closed the door, but didn't move from where he was, somewhat apprehensive. He avoided looking around. Every corner of the flat held a memory of John, now.
John was the first to infringe upon their unspoken contract of silence. He rubbed a finger over his eye, nose wrinkled as if he were pained. Sherlock hated that look on him. He missed John’s vibrant smile, the crinkle around his eyes when he’d grin up at Sherlock, the way his eyes seemed to brighten several shades. Now there was just the perpetual downturn of John’s lips to greet him and the hard rigid line of his jaw, tensed to the point where Sherlock wondered if his teeth ached from the pressure.
"Sarah Sawyer," Sarah suddenly spoke up, breaking the moment between Holmes and John, and thrusts her hand out to the older man.
With a parting wink, the woman stepped into the lift, and whipped her phone out, effectively dismissing John as the doors closed.
John's eyes flew open, shattering the illusion as he came violently, semen splattering across the skin of his chest.
Sherlock’s lips were pressed together, but the skin around his eyes crinkled, as well as his cheeks as he fought a grin. “Is that what you want, John?”
been perfect, and yet, John still felt a bit of wrongness, a sense that he was betraying Jasper, even if he wasn’t there anymore. Guilty, he sat up and ran his hands through his hair, sighing.
This had the potential to become very messy if things didn't play out smoothly between them, and John needed the work. He needed to be able to pay his own way when he moved with Mike to the new flat.
Sherlock paused, wanting to snap at the Alpha to get on with it, but when would he have this chance again? If this were his last meeting with John, wouldn't he want it to be memorable for the both of them? That would assure that this wouldn't be the last time they met.
After a tense moment, John forced himself to bare his throat and belly, showing the other male that he wasn't a threat nor a contender trying to usurp him. After an interminable amount of time, Sherlock finally relented and removed his considerable bulk, allowing for John to roll over and onto his feet.
John…
He slept terribly, to say the least, until his rude awakening.
Another dancer came to stand next to her, placing his arms around her narrow waist with the obvious attempt to kiss her. His lips ghosted down her long, pale neck as she talked, before it all abruptly changed. “Single he told me. Single my ass!” She thrust the man to the ground, sat on top of him and leaned over, regardless of the view she afforded the audience of her overflowing bust.
Lady Grey slid herself back up the wall and circled the chair in the middle of the stage. “You’ve been a bad, bad boy. I’m gonna take my time, so enjoy.” She swung her right leg over the chair and sank down slowly, holding his eyes with her dark blue ones as she ran her hands down her inner thighs in a coquettish manner. “There’s no need to feel no shame…” Lady Grey leant back and placed her hands behind her on the seat, tipping her head backwards as her body undulated upwards. “Relax and sip upon my champagne.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together, weighing his words before he spoke, something that John got the feeling was unusual for a man like him, for whom speaking his thoughts as they came tended to be a primary reaction.
forgive you.” So softly, Sherlock spoke the words, every bone in his body trembling with rage. He couldn't lose John. He would rather die first.
John raised a hand to the back of Sherlock's head, tangling in the chaotic curls there before he tugged his head down. Sherlock followed willingly, his eyes slipping closed as he stepped forward to wrap his arm around John's waist, drawing him near.
The dissonance between the pack was nearly tangible, like currents of electricity floating throughout the room. A tendril of shame was slowly making itself at home in John's conscience. This disruption within the house was of his doing; John was singlehandedly destroying Sherlock's pack.
John slunk closer, moving into Holmes' personal space with relative ease. He could hear the tremulous sigh from the man's lips, wafting across his face, along with the scent of mint and tea. John stood on his toes and placed his lips to Holmes' ear, nudging his lips against the soft, fleshiness of the man's lobe. "But I want to."
John clearly hadn't taken to Sherlock upon their first meeting, and Sherlock could admit to having been a bit glib, but at the time, he hadn't known that this student would spark his interest and, eventually, his libido.
"Hey, stop reading my mind, and it
"Clothes can easily be returned by post."
His tiny shower seemed too small for Sherlock and the peeling paint was embarrassing to look at, knowing that this was poor living in Sherlock's eyes. Poor he was, but he was a uni-going-med student, and it was a comfort to know that the lifestyle he lived then was only temporary. Being a surgeon would pay for his school debt and provide John with a comfortable living.
Greg relinquished the marijuana and tilted his head back, watching the cloud of smoke expel past his lips in wispy white plumes. He wasn't jealous. Okay, maybe a bit, but who wouldn't want what those two had with one another? Greg hadn't even gotten as close with some girlfriends.
They were standing against the back wall with their champagne glasses, giggling into sips when a man approached them, stopping unceremoniously before Sherlock. John looked in time to see Sherlock's back stiffen and his features twist in exasperation and annoyance. John turned back to the man who was staring at him curiously, weight leaned upon an umbrella with an ostentatious, ornate handle. And the three-piece Gieves and Hawkes ensemble was
Jasper didn't wait for anything else. He turned and walked calmly up the stairs to his room that smelled like dust and not like John. His bed was still disheveled from the night he’d left, though Jasper could tell his father had been in his room. The Pussy Riot poster on his wall was skewed and his pillow was more rumpled than usual. In the middle of the bed, there was an envelope still sealed with John's messy scrawl on the front. He would recognize that writing anywhere.
“You’re going to fuck him, aren’t you?”
had drugged her beer and taken her to an empty room, but it hadn't been William Murray. Now, Murray was going to train at Pirbright barracks in Surrey for the medical corps, with John, and he owed Sherlock a favour. Sherlock would see it paid, and Mycroft would never have to know.
John was bewitching, always bewitching him and he didn’t even know it.
Lady Grey scoffed. “Oh, Irene? Devil in a red dress, of course”
Sarah marched over to John's closet with steadfast determination. Jesus, he could already feel the migraine coming on.
"Do what you want, Lestrade. He will be your problem for the duration of his time here," the dark haired man snapped. He paused and turned to John, eyes hardening into threatening crystals. "As for you," he stalked forward, backing John into the water stained wall, "Don't think that I will not be watching your every move. You saw what I did to the hunters, and you know what I'm capable of doing to protect my pack."
Sherlock retrieved a shovel and began jabbing at the dirt for a second grave.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed his forehead softly, and pulled away a bit to stare down at him, their noses nearly touching. “You did very well, John,” Sherlock praised him, and John blushed, feeling a mix of pride and bashfulness. “You've made me quite proud.”
He knew well enough that there was bad blood between Sherlock and Magnussen. Sherlock shouldn’t have been surprised. Whenever Moriarty attacked, he always aimed low.
Now," Sherlock growled through gritted teeth.
Sherlock and Sally didn't look the least bit put out by it; if anything they acted as if it hadn't bothered them at all, but John knew there was rage crawling just beneath their skin. The look Lestrade exchanged with him over the dining room table alerted him that he noticed it too. The scent of satisfaction was heavy in the air, but there was also weariness and fear.
When John came, it hit like a freight. He wasn't expecting it. Sherlock hadn't even been touching his cock, but with the help of the cock ring, his orgasm had been building up for some time, and Sherlock's ability to hit his prostate without fail had him doubling over as much as was possible in his restraints. John's vision grew spotty and his eyes were rolling into the back of his head. The tremors had taken over completely, and his thighs were quaking with the force of his orgasm. John couldn't tell if he was dying or being revived, but it felt like ascension.
His mother's tinkling laugh filtered through the line, light and airy, just like she must be feeling from the drugs, or else she'd be bawling. "You know I used to forget your father's name all the time. His name is Hamish, like your middle name, and I would call him Haywood up until our third date. Isn't that funny?" She sighed and John heard the clink of something hitting the table. Probably the needle. “Dear thing was always so sweet about it.”
“Good, because I don't share,” Sherlock snapped, and Greg decided to leave it there, because there was no way this conversation could get any worse.
Sherlock gives John a taste of the future.
Mike's lips were parted in awe and John resisted the urge to reach out and close his mouth. "You can't say no, John, you have to take it," his friend implored. "Do you know how many people would kill for an offer like that?"
He was disgusted with his own ramblings, but the words rushed out like water from a tap. John's expression shifted from vexation to disappointment, then shame and hurt.
John cleared his throat and three sets of eyes snapped to him, each with varying levels of desperation. Though Julia hardly knew the strange man, there was something familiar about the way he couldn’t tear his eyes away from John. Like he was afraid that John would disappear if he looked away for too long. His gaze lingered in random places, seeing things in her son that Julia couldn’t begin to comprehend. He’d been left behind, too.
Sherlock chuckled, kissing John’s neck. “Yes, you are.”
“John,” he whispered, breaking his vow of distance and pressing a hand against John’s tense jaw. “John, look at me.”
It was cold and dank, as most basements were, the air thick and humid, but familiar. Sherlock walked down the steps and used his key to unlock the door at the very back of the room, nearly hidden by storage junk. Through the door was a short tunnel lit sparsely with safety lamps. The path was a short walk, but Sherlock always did find it fascinating.
you look at me. I see all the anger and the regret. Maybe I don't deduce the way you do, but I have eyes that work fine."
“May I,” Sherlock asked, his voice broken and gravelly from the rush of emotions.
“Oh, I think I hear him now.” Mrs Hudson. Sherlock pretended not to be breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn’t that woman John used to hang around, Sarah. Why his thoughts immediately turned to her was a mystery. He was certain if John hadn’t spoken to his parents in six years, then Sarah was most likely not an exception to his silence. “Never could get that boy to stop slamming doors. Going to tear it right off the hinges, he is.”
"You will never understand how badly I want to keep you this way, John," Sherlock gasped, and John answered in long, low moan, feeling the head of Sherlock's cock nudge his prostate.
Sherlock wanted to hear his voice again.
Jasper threw his head back and guffawed. "Dad, he's channeling Mrs. Hudson now! How brilliant is that?"
Irene rolled her eyes and closed some of the distance between them. “First order of business, I’m giving you the day off. Second, you are taking a break from Lady Grey for a few hours, and you are going to go out and meet people, like you used to.”
"Terribly sorry to disturb you, miss, but I was told to meet Jasper Holmes here." John smiled expectantly, in hopes that the woman would be able to point him in the right direction.
The woman returned her attention to John and smiled brightly with gleaming, kind brown eyes. "Martha Hudson," she introduced, holding out a small, frail hand, and John took it, surprised by the strength of her grip. "And what might I call you?"
John, emboldened by Sherlock's advances, had dropped one hand to his lover’s messily tucked shirt and wrenched it out of the waistband as Sherlock pressed him closer and closer to the bed.
John didn't have any pre-existing memories, and whether or not he suffered from anterograde amnesia as well was as of yet undetermined. Sherlock would have to wait some time to see if John was capable of retaining the information.
Jim was as cunning as he’d always been, playing the coy, humble businessman that he certainly wasn't. It was low, but Sherlock had felt the need to drudge up Jim's nasty reputation, and he could see the instant Jim accepted his challenge.
He reached for John’s free hand, where it was curled tightly against his thigh. John’s hand was warm and dry, fitting perfectly inside of his own.
But, Sherlock could admit to being an opportunist. It was how he got to where he was in life. Patience was a virtue that never got him anything but frustrated. So he wasn’t going to take John’s sudden presence in his life lightly, and he wasn’t going to waste time.
Anderson squawked indignantly, but the harsh glare dealt by Sherlock was enough to silence him immediately.
The only thing keeping John's knees from buckling were hands pressing dents into his hips and arse tight enough to bruise. Below him, Sherlock's lips were a relentless hold round his cock, dragging back and forth, a venturing tongue pressed against the ridge of John's erection. Sherlock's eyes were closed, but John had no doubts that the man was cataloging every moment, planning his next attack on John's body.
John gasped and arched against the mattress as another strike landed on his inner thigh again, this time, falling close enough to his cock to raise alarm. The pain was bearable, but not the look of anger and disappointment in Sherlock's eyes, so John turned his own away, only to be punished with another sharp sting of leather on the side of his buttocks. "I said
John could feel his heart rate elevate and his face heat up tremendously under the intensity of Sherlock's quicksilver gaze. A long, thin finger came up to trail over John's cheek intimately. "Even now, your body is telling me everything I need to know, and you're afraid because you can't control it."
A week passed, and John could barely bring himself to return to London. He'd sent the rent to Mike's bank account and everything else could be done over the internet. It was safe to say that he no longer was employed by Holmes Pharmaceuticals, but that was fine for the time being. He'd saved up a bit while working, but he couldn't afford to be wasteful. John would have to start looking for another job, and soon. He still wasn't sure whether he wanted to return to London or stay in Sutton for the foreseeable future. John's parents offered his room for as long as it took to get back on his feet, but John was loath to take advantage of the offer, and so the next week, he began looking on the internet for work.
In the pram, John gave a little wiggle and cried out sharply, followed by a series of uncomfortable whimpers.
John's babbling was becoming more formed around words Sherlock would say often, though they were still unintelligible. Sherlock watched it all closely with unhindered fascination, documenting it all only to add it to his mind palace in the wing dedicated to John. It was a rare and unobtrusive opportunity to observe growth rates and child development, but he was also a witness of John's childhood. With the new information, Sherlock wondered if his influence would somehow affect John as he grew back into adulthood.
John stood at the mouth of the hallway leading to Sherlock's room in 221B Baker Street, more confused than he’d ever been. It almost seemed like his first time there, unsure of his place or what to do with himself. Sherlock wasn't exactly being accommodating.
Sherlock went first to start the kettle, then to his mobile, which he’d left sitting on the coffee table the night before.
“Thank you, Miss Vicky, for your concern. Now, get out. I’m tired,” John sighed, holding the door open for her.
"Look, Sherlock," John began, shoving his hands into his pockets, uncomfortably, "I want to help you find Jasper."
John swallowed. He felt gutted, absolutely turned inside out, but Sherlock didn't seem to notice, which was odd for a man who was said to know everything. "On the coffee table; yellow envelope," but Sherlock was already flying out of the room.
Beside him, John's phone emitted a text message notification.
An hour later, they were sitting in front of empty cartons of Chinese food, because John overcooked the noodles, too distracted  with snogging Sherlock. Sherlock added too much seasoning to the spaghetti sauce, and they were too both busy giggling like schoolgirls to notice the smell of burning bread in the oven.
John found a booth not far from the door and slid in, while Mike made a beeline for the bar to order the first round. A gentle buzz from his pocket pulled his attention from the window, and before he could stop himself, John had the phone in his hand, anxiety a shock of static in his gut.
When Holmes moved away, a bright pink mark bloomed where he'd sucked the skin between his sharp teeth.
