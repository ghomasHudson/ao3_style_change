Lestrade looked at his hands as he began again, “OK… here goes… I love being intimate with another person, particularly when you’re in love with them… Both touching and being touched.  It’s the best I’ve felt in my entire life.  The most loved I’ve felt in my entire life.  And I think that when it’s John, you’re going to feel the same way.  And you know what, even if you don’t, I know John, and I know he would never, ever push you to do something you didn’t want to.  He would never want you to feel uncomfortable, or pressured.”
“Not really,” John said frankly, and Sherlock looked back at him quickly, concerned.  “Oh no, don’t worry – I don’t mean I had a bad day, exactly.  The hotel is great and I had a lovely walk around all the pools.  There are loads to choose from!  And I had a nice walk down to the little village next door, St Julian.  Had dinner down there, sitting and looking out at the bay.  Very pleasant.  Just… I didn’t know where I stood with you, and I spent a lot of the day worrying about that.  Worrying I’d messed us up.”
“What?”
“Yes… no… I mean, sort of…” John trailed off awkwardly, moving to sit down in his own chair, facing Sherlock.
“Sounds good to me.”
“Of course I’m serious!”
felt deeply relaxed that afternoon in the pool, and it was true that throwing the ball with Sherlock and Tim had been one of the most mindless, simple joys he’d had in years.  Maybe bringing a troubled kid into their lives wasn’t a bad idea… and they could try it out, unlike biological fatherhood.
Sherlock gasped.  “Why would I
“So... what do you know?  When I texted you, I didn’t expect that you would know anything, but the nature of your texts suggest that John let you know what he was going to do.”
“John, I told you at dinner this was the happiest I’ve felt in my life.  And then I told you I want us to raise kids together.  Of course I want to be in a relationship with you!  I’ve never felt like this before, and if I can feel even half this good any day in the rest of my life, I’ll be luckier than I ever dared hope.”
“You just complimented Mycroft.  You acknowledged he was good at something! Voluntarily!”
John looked back over, and said gently, “Me too, what?”
Sherlock blushed lightly and gave Rosie’s hand a little bounce.  She giggled again and clutched his finger more firmly.
“Look at those guys!”  Sherlock pointed.  John’s gaze followed Sherlock’s arm over to where some teenagers were launching themselves off the rocks and into the sea below.  John paled.  He grasped Sherlock’s right bicep, digging his nails into the skin, and said urgently, “Absolutely not.”
Sherlock shrugged, and John didn’t push it.  Sherlock wasn’t big on eating at the best of times, and John preferred to sit somewhere rather than their room, so he decided they would go down.
John looked surprised. “No, of course I’m not.”
“Oh, nothing much.  Just that you’re the love of my life and that I wanted some photo evidence of this week that I could plaster all over our walls at home.  I think they enjoyed that.”
They broke apart, panting a little, smiling.  “That was… amazing,” breathed John.
John chuckled to himself as Sherlock’s pleasure washed over him.  He was truly in his element here – marching about confidently and delighting in knowing more than the informational plaques.  John had always considered himself interested in history, and had enjoyed the lessons both at school and as part of his military training.  But Sherlock’s fascination with it was really something else.  History was alive to him in a way that it had never been alive to John.  He cared deeply about the tools used, the ingenuity taken, and who’d known what and whom at the time of the various developments.  If he’d had a pen, John felt sure Sherlock would have marked up the signs, correcting dates or adding context in that the signs’ authors had apparently glossed over.
John nodded slowly, acknowledging Sherlock’s words.  “I’m glad you did – truly.  That was a bit of a surprise, but I don’t want you to think that it was a bad one.  I just didn’t know, and now I do.”  He smiled tentatively, hoping Sherlock could see it in the low light of the bay.  “How about this?  I don’t know exactly what I think about having children.  I’m in my 40s, and it hasn’t happened, and I honestly got to the point years ago that I assumed it was never going to happen.  But I’m open to the idea, and if it’s as important to you as you’re telling me it is, then I think we should find a way to make it happen.”
“That’s great!” said John with sincerity, thinking that it’d been a long time since he’s had a chat with a child, and that he’d forgotten how enjoyable it could be. “How old are you, then? Still in primary school?”
Sherlock’s forehead crinkled.  “But that can’t be right, I’m reasonably sure you’ve chosen the two least expensive items in the entire shop.  Your frugal instincts do you proud!”
As Sherlock sat in the black cab heading back to Baker Street, his mind was empty.  The doors of his mind palace were firmly closed.  The last lines of John’s note had stilled his mind.  “… You had to prove you were smarter… that you knew more… that you could break her.  And guess what, Sherlock?  You broke her.  You won.  And Mary died.  I don’t want to see you.  Stop calling.”
.  Just when he was about to cave, Sherlock spoke again.
Sherlock gave a deep sigh as though he were terribly long-suffering, and released John, leaning back into more of a seated position.  “Fiiiiiiiine.  I’m up.”
Sherlock considered this, still running his sun creamy hands over John, moving now to his collarbone, and sweeping his hands down John’s chest.  “Is that what you want?”
“Bit chilly, is it?” John asked as he made his way to the edge.
Sherlock grinned.  “Well, I’m glad you don’t do that.  And I’m sorry for saying you harangue me.  It’s more of a low-level pestering…”
“Deal.  I’ll go put on some clothes.”
Lestrade looked down at the paper and saw that John had indeed shared his hotel information at the bottom of the page.  Struck with curiosity, he started to scan the rest of the page, wanting to know what John had written to Sherlock that had provoked this frantic reaction.  Before he could get much beyond the first question,
Sherlock looked down at his feet, not sure where this was going.
They both looked at a snoozy Rosie, now in a terry towel onesie, and smiled.  John laid her carefully down on her back in the middle of Sherlock’s fortress.  She snuffled a little, slipping her thumb into her mouth.  Sherlock watched John watching Rosie, feeling his chest stretch with the emotions of the day.  The tenderness on John’s face, his soft touch on her skin, the way he carefully smoothed down the bedspread below her, all spoke of a love Sherlock had never seen before.  John had changed.  John was a father, really a father.
Sherlock leans back into his seat. “I want to spend it at home, with you. At least Christmas morning.”
“Text her when we land, tell her we’ll be there.”
“No, I don’t,” Sherlock responds evenly.
Sherlock kisses him some more, his hand now pressed to John’s nape, “I can order some take away.”
“Text me the address.”
John nods, looking for another target. “The old man over there?”
affairs, Sherlock. That’s the point. You aren’t in this relationship alone. There’s two of us.”
John takes a moment to soak it all in - the remains of humanity, making themselves a remnant, the incidental, unchosen Israel with no Saviour in sight.
know what to do when it feels this way. On the days I’m extra quiet and extra clingy and you don’t comment at all because you somehow just know exactly what I need before even I do. Like that horrible Wednesday when my veins were singing out for something to fill them and my head was drumming hateful garbage and my heart felt like it was on another continent entirely and you just took one look at me and folded my up into your grip and held me so tight I couldn’t breathe but then I suddenly
Did you honestly think… Did you really think that doing that in front of me, your closest and may I remind you
to someone else. It should be someone who makes you smile and laugh and makes you feel so bloody happy all the time. It should be someone who makes you cry and fear it could end any time and wonder how you’ll survive if it does. It should be someone who’s there to remind you it’s never easy but that’s alright, because you’re in this together and learning day after day how to make it work. It should be someone you can’t stop thinking about, someone you want to grow old with, someone you want to make love to every single second of every single day. The love of your life should be someone you fought for, someone you keep fighting for every day.
“But there will be days when I’ll see your chair and remember how it looked empty, or think back on your body on the ground, and it’ll make me so angry, yes.”
“I could send him an email and see if he’s free.”
John leans to kiss him, softly, slowly, “I don’t have to, we can discuss this,” he murmurs. “I could always come back for the weekends.”
Just wanted to check in. I’ll swing by later. For the record, I’m still angry. Your brother showed me “the list”. Looked like a bloody hospital ordering sheet. You utter lunatic.
Sherlock closes his eyes, breathing deeply as he finally says, “I could come with you.”
And in that time, I’ve managed to get barely anything done. My mind has been terrible to me.
I’ve been in love with you for so long, I don’t even remember a time where I wasn’t.
I wanted to say… that is… thank you. For your help. You didn’t have to come, and yet… It was good to see you. And Rosie. Tell her hello from me. I hope I’ll see you both soon.
“I hated Mark because he was getting all your attention. I had seen them before, the type B fans, but you usually ignored them. But him,” John sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. “Him you laughed with and smiled to and genuinely cared for. I couldn’t stand to witness it all, to be there when it finally happens.”
He rifles through another drawer in the filing cabinet, but comes up empty. Pulls out his phone and opens his text thread with John.
Sherlock’s second hand comes to rest over his own, the glass of whiskey forgotten on the floor. Silence settles back between them, just a little lighter than before. John wonders if one day it will stop feeling so thick, if they’ll find ways to share all there is left to say.
“Then what
“Is it also not too late for everything else?”
a good kind of tension, but he feels it now, something primal and private low in his stomach. Something that wants to reach out and say
John is in his chair, finally tucking into the novel he’s been trying to read since this whole thing began. His concentration hasn’t been great. That, and Sherlock has been pretty much a full-time job these days. Again, not that he doesn’t love it.
“He’s deeply in love with her but she isn’t returning his feelings. He’s still hoping, which explains the lunch date. She doesn’t know how to tell him, so she’s hoping he’ll get the message at some point.”
I want to be that person again. I want you to trust me again, and I know I need to work to earn back that trust. I don’t want you to think that me coming back to London would fix everything. I honestly think that it would only make it worse. If I come back now, Sherlock, there’s still so many things I haven’t told you. There’s still so many things I haven’t worked on, and tried to understand. And have no doubt, I want to come home. I want to be back in London and breathe it in. I want the life we used to have, the relationship we used to have. Christ, Sherlock, there so much more I want, too.
“Questions?”
John Watson
And here he is, three days later, staring at his phone and wondering if he is allowed one last mistake. His fingers work against him, and the phone rings for a small eternity before Sherlock answers, and then, silence.
“Finally a good idea.”
Sherlock nods. He is shivering under John’s touch, and so John moves closer, using his body heat to try and warm him up. He closes his eyes, letting his hands learn the shapes of each scar on Sherlock’s skin, wondering if one day he’ll know them all by heart. He kisses Sherlock’s shoulder softly, the both of them letting out a shaky breath. Taking him by surprise, Sherlock rolls over in John’s arms, kissing him soundly. John can’t do anything but kiss him back, their bodies now attached to each other. The feeling is both exhilarating and scary, but John holds on as tightly as he can.
John doesn’t try to hide his excitement this time, already pushing away his food.
____________________________________
As Sherlock bent down to inspect the gift, a tender smile on his face, John picked up the accompanying note that had been propped in front of the frame.
“There was a nice one I found yesterday down by the sea,” John said, pointing straight ahead.  “You can’t see it from here because it’s rather lower and a longer walk, but I figure we’re up for that?”
He let the minutes pass, knowing he had time before he needed to leave, and hoping beyond hope that he might get something from Sherlock before he went.  Anything at all.  Even a “What on earth was that about?” or “I’m sorry, John, but I just don’t feel the same way.”  Instead… nothing.  Silence.  Blank expression and a slight squint of those beautiful eyes, staring into the middle distance.
Lestrade guffawed, his blush spreading right across his face and deepening into utter mortification.  This wasn’t what he’d signed up for.  He made a mental note to hit John the next time he saw him.  Helping Sherlock think the relationship through was one thing.  Discussing Sherlock’s sex life was quite another.  This was worse than giving his kids “The Talk”.  Lestrade laughed a little to himself as he suddenly wondered if maybe someone needed to give Sherlock “The Talk”.  If the answer was yes, Lestrade was outta there.  Time to call Mycroft.  He laughed to himself again.  He could only imagine what that conversation would be like.  Mycroft might bring props or pictures or something.  Or maybe he’d outsource it?  Lestrade squirmed and giggled again.
“So not so much with the
“He’s very… thorough… isn’t he?”
John smiled to himself.  The line between meddling and caring was very thin with Mycroft.
Sherlock blushed, but was distracted when his phone vibrated in his pocket, and he pulled it out.
John sat too.  He’d been leaning his hands on one of the chairs, facing Sherlock as he cooked.  Now he pulled out the chair and sat opposite Sherlock, who was now shaking steadily.
“Where are my bally swim shorts?  I’m sure they were here.”
Two hours later, as the plane sat on the tarmac waiting for take-off, Sherlock breathed out slowly.  Really happening, then.  He looked down again at the FAQ, reading it from top to bottom once more.  He’d essentially memorised it at this point, but having the physical paper in his hand made this all feel real somehow.   Breathing a sigh of relief, he reached for his phone and sent the same text to two numbers.
“No, no, Rosie darling.  That doesn’t go in your mouth, now does it?”
When Sherlock finally made it chest deep into the water, they had quite a nice time moving steadily up and down the length of the pool, half-swimming, half-walking, and chatting easily the whole time.  John enjoyed learning more about Sherlock’s childhood and teen years.  Somehow it was easier to talk about these things when they were a long way from Baker Street.
John chuckled to himself, idly noting that with the time difference, Lestrade was up particularly early.  He debated what to respond, typing and re-typing his answer.
John gave a polite smile and a nod – he’d always been awkward in clothing stores – before heading back to the changing rooms.  “Sherlock…” he called, conscious that while they seemed to be the only people in the shop, he was also unclear which of the four stalls housed one Sherlock Holmes.
As the cab pulled up outside Speedy’s the following evening, Sherlock whizzed out with both suitcases, leaving John to pay, as usual.  Mycroft had held firm on the upgrades, much to Sherlock’s annoyance, and they’d been seated in the absolute back row.  John hadn’t minded one bit, content to hold Sherlock’s hand and canoodle when the flight attendants weren’t looking.  Sherlock, on the other hand, was sure that Mycroft had actually meddled to get them allocated
Sherlock snorted and looked more closely at the paper.  “You wrote an FAQ on this conversation?  I… I don’t think anyone has done that before.  That is a very odd thing to do.  I was… you know… here.”
Sherlock decided to read to himself, not aloud.  If Lestrade was going to choose this moment to lose his nerve, Sherlock needn’t push it further.  He read:
“Same-same,” said Sherlock, and dropped her a wink.  John enjoyed flirty Sherlock, particularly when he was feeling quite secure as to his own position.  “You’re right either way.  It’s been a long time since I’ve been in such bright sun and I don’t have my sun cream down here. Let’s take that nice looking sofa thing in the shade.”
Sherlock continued grinning into the darkness, reaching his arm out to drape around John in a loose hug.  He dropped a kiss onto John’s throat and whispered, “Thank you.  Really.  For everything.”
“Language!” John responded immediately, shooting a look at Tim, who didn’t seem terribly concerned.  Sherlock did have the good grace to look a bit guilty.
“Ok – options for you.  We can inspect the Stock Exchange and some gardens that apparently have amazing water views, or we could line up for the cathedral, or we could just potter through the streets for a bit?  Or… there’s this 5D film experience which is startlingly highly rated as an activity.  Though I’d suggest we wait til later in the day to do that, as it’s only 21’C now and it’ll be 28’C by lunchtime.  We may want the air conditioning by then!”
John smiled at Sherlock then, genuinely, warmly, glad to be back in 221B with his best friend.  Feeling relieved he’d come today, and hadn’t turned on his heel at the top of the stairs.  John felt his face relax as he realised that they might be ok, and was pleased to see Sherlock loosen up as he watched John’s reaction – clearly he’d been worried about the reception this new set-up would get.
“I love you too, John Watson.  Thank you for a truly life-changing week.”
“So… what did you think of my choices, then?”  John ventured, waiting for Sherlock to reappear.
“Well, I’d better get out of it sharpish then, hadn’t I?”
__________________________
“I know that, stupid.  I would be very surprised if any of your
Tim nodded.  “Well, I would have.  It’s cool that they come to you!  But Sophie wanted to see the ice creams.  She likes to choose, you know.  Look at them, and that.  She’s only 6.”
“Sherlock, it’s not bad news… at least, I hope you won’t think it’s bad news.”
“I want to tell you.”
Sherlock read sympathy and genuine concern on Lestrade’s face, and wondered about it.  Did Lestrade think Sherlock was a bit pathetic, needing a buddy to discuss his feelings?  From what Lestrade said before, it wasn’t news at all to him that John was in love with Sherlock.  Maybe best to start there, then.
“Really?  Has it upset you that I haven’t done that in the past?”
“Can I just tell you, please?  Every guess so far has been spot on.”
Sherlock crossed the room in three long strides, and reached out his hand expectantly to John.
John looked back at Sherlock with amazement.  “You put a bath in… for us?”
“Why are you laughing?” Sherlock asked accusingly.
“Hmm.  Speak for yourself.”
John smirked even as he was surprised by this exchange.  He’d have thought Sherlock would have run at the first hint of flirting, but here he was leaning right into it.  John squeezed out sun cream onto his hand.  Sherlock turned his head back around, and stared out to sea.  John felt overwhelmed for a second that they were both here, that this was going so well.  Taking a liberty, John pressed a quick kiss to Sherlock’s shoulder, then started rubbing the sun cream in broad sweeps across Sherlock’s back.  Sherlock shivered a bit at the sensation – the cool cream, the light kiss, John’s warm hand.  It was an intimacy he hadn’t known before.
*SMACK*
Sherlock grinned down at John.  “I knew you’d come around.  We’ll have you in Armani before you know it.”
“Sherlock, look at me.”  Sherlock looked up.  “I don’t want either of us to be sad.  I want us to move forward – I want us to talk about what this means for us.  And I want us to have a great holiday.  We’ve never been on holiday together before!”  John shared a boyish grin with Sherlock, feeling his love for Sherlock bubbling up in his chest again.  He leaned forward a bit, pulling his crossed legs under him.
Sherlock snorted with laughter, surprised.  “You wish!”
As they clambered out of the cab, John did a slow spin and took everything in.  “Wow, this is amazing.”
“Well, I’m glad.  I… I don’t know what I expected, but I’m glad we’re here.   I’m glad you’re here.”
“Look, I don’t want to spoil your fun if you want to keep going, but as it happens I do have a plane to catch, so we are somewhat on the clock.”
“You’re welcome, Sherlock.  And let me just say this, before we go to sleep.  I will show you, and tell you, that I love you every single day for as long as you’ll have me.   I never, ever, want you to wonder where you stand with me.  I want you to know that you are the person I love most in this world, and go to sleep every night knowing that I’ll be right there next to you when you wake up in the morning.  Or… you know… I’ll be around somewhere, given you’re not a big sleeper.”
John chuckled.  Of course Sherlock would plan their umbrella positioning for maximum efficiency.  “I think I’ll bask in the sun for a bit given I’ve got all this cream on, but then I’ll join you under the shade when I’m thoroughly warm.  Sound good?”
Flicking his eyes to the door to the stairs, musing idly on whether he should check if John was ok, Sherlock decided John would yell out if that was necessary.  As disinclined as Sherlock was to help with these things, he knew John would eventually lose patience if it really mattered.  And so his eyes flicked back to the ceiling and he waited for John to appear before him with an explanation.  John was predictable like that.
“John… I’m not sure…”
John smiled gratefully up at Sherlock.  What a day.  What a night.
__________________________
John was both surprised by this and not.  On the one hand, he’d spent the last few days wondering if he was really up for the expense, logistics, and emotional turmoil of whatever IVF / surrogate process might be involved with bringing a “Holmes Junior” into existence.  As unappealing as that felt to him, the idea of a small person with Sherlock’s brains, curls, and intense curiosity making his or her home in John’s old room did feel oddly perfect.  But on the other hand, given Sherlock’s long history with the homeless network and his clear desire to ensure other children weren’t as lonely and isolated as he himself had been, fostering to adopt also made complete sense.
“Yeah, no, I know you were here.  I just… ah… I just thought there were some things you should know.  Some context that you might need or want as you think this week.  And while you are, of course, able to contact me the whole time, I thought that you might not want to.  You might prefer just to have a page you can read and absorb in your own time.  I’m happy to tell you all of this to your face, of course, but I don’t want to overwhelm you.”
Sherlock looked up from his shoes with watery eyes, and instinctively brought his right hand up to rest on his chest, cradling his heart.  John idly wondered if it was his shot wound he was touching, or his brain was focussed on his emotional-not-physical heart.  Sherlock took a deep breath, and started to open his mouth.  He looked quite overcome, John thought.  Sherlock stopped and started again, his lips pressed together then releasing as he took another deep breath, jarring almost like a sob.
“Sherlock, while your mind boggles with all the sex research you can do tomorrow, I’m going to go sleep.  It’s been a long and wonderful day.  But if you need anything else to occupy your thoughts while I’m being boring, consider this:  There are many
Sherlock’s eyes crinkled beautifully as a grin split his face.  John’s heart gave a lurch.  “Splendid, John!  Heave ho, and all that.”  After an appraising glance at John’s body once more, seeming to assess the physics of what was to happen next, Sherlock stuck one arm behind John’s knees and one behind his back and tipped John sideways with an ungainly “oof!”.  Even with the warning, John was surprised to be on his back, aloft in Sherlock’s arms.  As Sherlock took a few unsteady steps up and through the front door, John felt pure joy, surprised that this did in fact feel fun and romantic, if a bit precarious.  He laughed aloud and threw his arms around Sherlock’s neck, sure that this would round out the image Sherlock had in his head.  He turned his head into Sherlock’s chest and whispered: “You’re my favourite person in the world, you know that?”
The sales assistant looked on as John said quietly, putting the items he’d tried on the counter, “I, uh, think I’m fine, actually.  I don’t really need new swim shorts – I barely use my current ones as it is.”
“Wait – just wait a sec.”
Lestrade snorted.  An FAQ on declarations of love.  How very “them”.  Trust John to know that Sherlock would need more than a little help to absorb this.
Sherlock’s eyes were scrunched up tight now, and he was breathing heavily, Rosie between them staring at her father’s face.  John continued stroking Sherlock’s cheekbone with his thumb, breathing steadily.  Time stood still for a moment, and then John made a decision.
“Because…?”
John nodded, looking thoughtful.
“When I think about my life, John is there.  Any future I see for myself – whether it’s here at home, or working, or travelling, or Christmas with my parents – John is right by my side.  Anything less than that would be devastating.”
“The idea is settling.  It’s still a lot to take in, but I’m coming around to it.  I don’t really know what this means for us, to be honest.”
“Ok.  I believe you.  I just… I want you to tell me what you want, ok?”
“Really?”
“Yeah, well…”
With one last look at her, and after securing the other monitor in John’s hand, they turned for the door.  Sherlock rested his hand lightly on John’s back to guide him out, softly pulling the door to, but not closed.  John breathed in Sherlock, enjoying the touch, but not wanting to get ahead of himself.
Sherlock shook his head, but clarified, “I do mean that, but really I mean today has been incredible and being here with you is the best I’ve ever felt in my life too.”
One sunny Thursday afternoon around 3pm, Sherlock was curled up sideways in his chair when he heard a tread on the stairs.  A familiar tread – an authoritative one; one that said “I’m home”.  Though he’d previously been staring into space thinking about a case, he screwed his eyes shut as his heart leapt in his chest.  Could it be?
“And it’s ok if I change my mind?”
Wanting to ease Sherlock’s apprehension further – he clearly still felt like the other shoe was still about to drop – John broke eye contact and looked around the rest of the room again.
He pushed the door into the room, noting it was mostly dark, but one lamp had been left on at the far end, near the sliding doors out to the balcony.  Sherlock moved quietly on the terracotta tiles, pulling his suitcase in the door behind him then softly closing it, hearing the lock click back into place.  Putting his key in his pocket and moving the suitcase to the side so it wasn’t in the way, Sherlock quietly toed off his shoes and walked lightly down the hallway in his socks.  He didn’t think John would be sleeping, but nor did he think this moment called for a grand entrance.
“I know you said no, but I’ve booked us a sailboat for tomorrow.”
“No wait –“ Sherlock interrupted, holding out a hand like a traffic cop.  “Before you tell me… you should know that the elephants glow in the dark.”
“Hey yourself.”
Days later, Sherlock had a plan.  He needed John to know that he would respect his wishes; that Sherlock understood that continuing to contact John, to show up at John’s door, was about what Sherlock wanted;  Sherlock’s need to be close to John.  Drafts consumed Sherlock for days.  In the end, he landed on a note.  Short and sweet.  Posted rather than hand-delivered, so John would know that Sherlock hadn’t come around again.
Lestrade rolled his eyes, knowing Sherlock wasn’t actually offended and mildly impressed that Sherlock had identified the joke.  That hadn’t been his strong suit in the past.
“Sherlock… please.  Can you let me get this out?”  Sherlock nodded, and John continued. “Actually, I think it’d be better if you came over here so I can see your face.”  John gestured at their chairs, encouraging Sherlock to get off the sofa and come over.
Musing on whether he could justify waking Sherlock up just because he was hungry, John reached instead for his book and a hat, and decided on a compromise.  He’d just pull open the curtains enough to open the sliding doors to the balcony, and if that amount light “so happened” to wake Sherlock, then so be it.  With a silly little smile to himself, he grabbed his phone off the charger and a bottle of water from the fridge, before starting his stealthy exit.
John smiled at this, and his heart ached at Sherlock’s open acknowledgement of John’s feelings.  Good on Lestrade, doing his part.  “Of course, Sherlock.  I know it’s not really dating, exactly, when we’re already here on holiday together, but we can take it super slowly.  I think it’ll be nice, spending time together away from work.  We can explore the island, and hang out here at the hotel.  I want to show you how I feel, and you can ask me questions, and maybe when you’re feeling ready, we can talk about how you feel?”
“Go on.”
Sherlock considered this.  “No, I don’t think that’s the case.  I don’t feel worried about what he told me, and I don’t think I can ignore how John feels.  I’m curious, I guess.”
“Look!” Sherlock pulled the FAQ off the dresser where he’d left it, and handed it to Lestrade.  “Right there at the bottom.  Last question,
“No, I know I don’t need to.  But I thought it might be fun to give it a go.  And if it’s terrible you’ll just have more teaching to do later, ok?”
“Well, it’s fun, isn’t it?  You could see me if we went swimming at night.  Or if I wanted to wear them around Baker Street in the winter.”
“Now look back at him!”  the girl ordered in an Italian accent, and John was startled into obeying, looking adoringly up at Sherlock before Sherlock turned side on and caught his eye.  John felt pleasantly silly, doing this.  He was far too old, really.  But something about Sherlock brimming with happiness, his eagerness to have a photo together, and knowing that they were documenting this feeling, this week, overtook him.   John beamed at Sherlock, mouthed “I love you”, then faced the camera again, thinking it was about time they wrapped this up.
Sherlock paused, considering.  John looked pleased again, clearly having moved past the “no friends” moment to pleasure that he’d flummoxed Sherlock.
___________________________
Sherlock nodded calmly, and John felt a strong sense of peace wash over him.  They stared quietly into each other’s eyes for a few moments, then John looked back out to the cobblestone street, enjoying the soft touch of Sherlock’s hand.   By any measure at all of what he’d hoped would happen after he opened up to Sherlock, this was exceptional.
He looked back, “Goodbye, then.  I’ll be back next Saturday.  And… if you want me to move out then, I will.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and wiggled back off the bed, less elegantly than was characteristic for him.  He stood up and gave himself a bit of a shake.  “Fine.  I’ll get into my pyjamas and brush my teeth, but I’ll be right back.”
Tim turned back to Sherlock and John and said earnestly, “Thank you, Sherlock.  Thank you, John.  That was brilliant!”
“Ah, good.  That’s exactly what I hoped you meant.”
“The question!” Sherlock jumped up with a start.  Where were those FAQs?  Finding the paper had fallen just to the side of his feet, he leant down and snatched it up again.  “Here we go – I didn’t read this closely enough earlier.  There’s a question on here:
John paused to check Sherlock’s reaction.  He scanned Sherlock’s face, expecting Sherlock to look taken aback, maybe speculative, maybe happy or angry or shocked.  John had spent days considering every possible outcome of this conversation, every reaction Sherlock might have to this news.  Instead, much to John’s surprise, Sherlock looked confused and John realised that Sherlock wasn’t following.
John opened his eyes, a bit embarrassed to be caught in that moment, to find Sherlock’s expression curious and open.  He clearly wanted to know what John had been thinking, and John felt Sherlock’s eyes flicking over his face, reading for clues.
John chuckled, aware of Sherlock’s racing thoughts.  “As long as you don’t throw my back out, I’m basically up for anything.”  John then had a panicked thought at how literally Sherlock might take this, and hastened to clarify: “Anything within reason, I mean.  I’m not into knives… or fire… or third parties…”. He wracked his brain, trying to think of more carve outs he should add. “Or… like… choking stuff.”
“What did you say to them?”
“Oh shut up, you can’t be that surprised that I like to watch him sleep.”  Sherlock said evenly, without a hint of irony.  Lestrade chuckled and acknowledged that was probably correct – he was actually more surprised that Sherlock had said it aloud than that it was true.  Somehow this was funnier in Sherlock’s posh accent – Lestrade wasn’t quite sure why.  Sherlock continued, softer after his previous retort.
Sherlock looked confused for a moment.
“And… what’s that?” John asked as he took in the unrecognisable sofa area.  What had previously been a dark corner, piled high with books, magazines, old mugs of tea and (he thought warily) sometimes the odd experiment, now looked like a cut out from a glossy day-care brochure.  On the floor was a soft foam mat, almost puzzle-like, with interlocking coloured squares each featuring a letter or number.  On each wall, about a foot off the ground, was clear shelving about 10cm deep, with books set up as if in a children’s library.  All the covers were facing outwards, and they had intriguing titles like “Quantum Physics for Babies”, and “Awesome Science Experiments for Kids”.  As he moved closer, he inspected more of the titles; “The Big Book of Why” jumped out at him, as did “The ABCs of Space”.  They were books for a whole range of ages – some were board books, made of stiff cardboard and almost indestructible for little hands, while others were for school age children, with hardback covers and normal picture book paper.  There were probably 20 of them, all arranged neatly like a choir, slightly overlapping, and all at eye level for a toddler.
“Now… what do you prefer, John?  The dancing elephants?”  Here, Sherlock held up some navy-blue shorts with outlines of large lime green elephants in a vaguely Indian drawing style on them. “Or, these delightful embroidered seahorses?” Here, Sherlock held up some subtler shorts – a pink, tactile pattern on navy base, though honestly John couldn’t see any seahorses at all.  In fact, the shorts looked rather like the pattern of their wallpaper at 221B, though John knew better than to share that thought.  John opened his mouth to respond.
But now, this.  The end.

“What are you thinking?” Sherlock said softly in the darkness.
“Let me say this, and then I think we should stop talking about this for tonight – we can obviously keep talking other nights – we should finish our dinner.  And maybe sit on the couch and watch some telly.”  John nodded, and Sherlock continued, “You and Rosie are welcome here any time.  In any capacity you want to be here, for as long as you want to be here.  I know you have your key, but I also don’t want you to feel like you ever have to explain why you’re here, or text ahead to say that you’re on your way.
Alessia laughed and said, “That is not what I said… I said the shade is more pleasant for the English, generally.”
Sherlock looked chuffed with this news, and gazed fondly at her little body in John’s arms.
“Good, I’m glad to hear that… I know Rosie probably still gets up in the night and I thought you’d like somewhere to sit while you settle her.  But then I worried that it wouldn’t rock, and maybe you wouldn’t like it, and maybe I should have chosen one of the chairs that really is for nurseries and not this one that’s really for you, and….”
“Sherlock…?”
“No, you didn’t.  I think you called me a sock?”
“If you mean, why am I not dressed in a collared shirt and work trousers, the answer is that it’s the weekend and I’m not working today.”
John was floored.  Of all the things he’d possibly expected to come out of Sherlock’s mouth, this wasn’t it.  He felt his eyebrows raise in surprise and his heart rate spike, and reminded himself that he’d been determined to provide a reassuring response to Sherlock, regardless of what it turned out to be.  He just hadn’t expected this.
Ten minutes later, a clean and pyjama-ed Sherlock appeared at the end of John’s bed, looking expectant.  John had tucked himself back into the position he’d been in when Sherlock arrived.  “So…”

“What’s that, then?” Lestrade leaned over Sherlock’s shoulder to read the text. “Oh, Mycroft came through.  Good on him.  He’s a good brother, you know.”
It was companionable, standing there chopping and slicing side by side.  Sherlock was more relaxed than John had seen him in ages, moving skilfully and smoothly around the kitchen and throwing things confidently in the pan.  The kitchen began to smell wonderful – frying onions always had that effect – and John’s stomach gave an audible rumble.
“So…”
“Come on… let’s get back to the hotel.  It’s high time I cleared any doubt from your mind about how I feel.”  Sherlock nimbly stood, pulling John up with him, and tucking John’s arm into his so their bodies were touching all along the side as they walked.   “And no more chat about children.  Tonight is about you and me, and we have the rest of our lives to work out the rest.”
John thought to himself.
John said, “Eureka!” and hoisted the sun cream into the air with a triumphant grin.  Sherlock smiled indulgently, not having been remotely concerned about the location of the sun cream, and drifted back to the bathroom to spit and rinse out his mouth.  When he reappeared, he’d unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged it off, turning around and presenting his back to John.
“No, honestly... I was pleasantly, deliciously,” here he pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple, “surprised that we went as far as we did.  I wasn’t expecting anything to happen this week… I wasn’t sure if you’d want that at all, even if you were open to a romantic relationship.  So I considered everything that we did do together a real gift.”  He paused, not wanting to avoid what he felt Sherlock was really getting at.  “That being said… I think what you’re really asking me is if I
“Yes, I think we should,” Sherlock said seriously.  Sherlock returned to his seat and Lestrade stepped neatly around into John’s.  He looked evenly at Sherlock, noting the worried expression and the nervous twisting of hands.  It was the most jittery Lestrade had seen Sherlock in years.  Actually, Lestrade thought to himself, the most jittery he’d seen Sherlock since John had come into his life.  He took a deep breath, noted idly that he hadn’t been offered a tea, then breathed out as he remembered his role here.  He caught Sherlock’s eye once more, and Sherlock began.
“Valletta City Gate, please.”  Sherlock instructed the cab driver.  On the 15 minute ride between St Julian’s and the city, Sherlock peppered John with fun facts about Valletta’s history.  John let it all wash over him, content that they were together and he’d soon have a coffee in hand.
Sherlock’s expression faltered the longer John went without speaking.
Sherlock looked a bit surprised, but agreed readily.  “Won’t she fall off the bed?  I did… I mean I really did think about buying a cot, but then that seemed a bit extreme, and I didn’t want to freak you out… and then...”
“Come here, then.  Bend down.”
“I’m not nervous.”
“I’m just sitting here, thinking how incredible you are.  And how lucky I am that you love me. And that we’re here, together.”
“That was amazing.”
At this, Sherlock smiled softly, tentatively.  John continued, “I meant what I said last night, just as I think you did.  I really want us to be honest with each other.  I’d much prefer you’re honest with me, even if it’s a bit of a shock, than that I don’t know what you’re thinking.  Really.”
John snorted as they walked back to the counter, sure that he didn’t want to know.  As Sherlock whipped his credit card out and casually added a magenta hat from a nearby stand to the pile, John caught his mischievous grin and knew the card did indeed read “M. Holmes”.  He chuckled and rolled his eyes as he put his arm around Sherlock’s waist and drew him in for a side hug.
Sherlock nodded.  “That’s true.  Thank you for the FAQ.  Lestrade thought that was hilarious, by the way.”
“And it doesn’t matter if I don’t know if I want to do… the other stuff?”
Sherlock drank in John’s excitement.  John deserved everything.  All the views.  All the best hotels.  Sure, this was nice, but for it to be the nicest of John’s life gave Sherlock a little tightness in his chest.  He wanted everything for John.  All the happiness.  He gave John’s hand another squeeze.  John squeezed back, seeming to understand.
“Do they?  Say that, I mean?” John teased Sherlock.
Sherlock scoffed, and thrust a menu in John’s hand as they passed a table.  Indeed, there were scrambled eggs and an assortment of other breakfast items on the list.  It wasn’t a very long menu, and certainly wouldn’t compare to the buffet, but there was enough to interest him.  Trust Sherlock to know that, having been in the hotel fewer than eight hours.  He slowly followed Sherlock outside, where he already was chatting in a friendly way to a tanned young woman in a navy polo, with long dark hair tied back in a ponytail.  She had her hand up to shelter her eyes against the sun, and was discussing seating options with Sherlock in lightly accented English.
Sherlock nodded slowly, ruminating.
“Yes, yes. But you know me.  Once I’ve made up my mind, the game is afoot!”  Sherlock threw Lestrade a mischievous grin and continued rummaging through his drawers.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Come on, John.  We haven’t got all day.  Pick one, and you can choose the other tomorrow if it doesn’t take your fancy.”
Sherlock smiled and, taking one of Rosie’s little legs in each hand, gave them a jiggle.  John’s heart skipped a beat as he watched this funny little dance.  Rosie giggled as she kicked and Sherlock said cheerfully, “Off we go then!” and marched down the hall.  John smiled and drifted after them.
“Yes, of course!  Look, I know it’s not very “me” in the way you know me, but I’ve had a lot of time on my hands and I wanted it to be perfect.” Sherlock bit his lip nervously, and then looked back at John. “I know I probably went a bit overboard, but I really enjoyed it.”
“What would I know?” said Sherlock with a one shouldered shrug, but then gestured again at the walls. “I wanted them to be fresh and clean, but I also didn’t want the room to change too much.  This was the compromise.”
“John, I -”
They ended up down on the St Julian waterfront, seated out front of a local restaurant lauded for its seafood and Maltese specialties.  Their table had a stiff white tablecloth but was otherwise perfectly casual, and John enjoyed the light breeze as they silently studied the tourists drifting past.  Lots of sunburnt faces, wet hair fresh from evening showers, with the women and daughters in floaty sundresses and the men and sons in loose cotton shirts with shorts.  As the waiter cleared their plates, John smiled to himself, enjoying the classic summer uniforms of European holiday towns.  It felt delightfully timeless.
“Yes. I… I hoped you’d come home.  Forgive me, you know, and – ah – come home.”
“You’re cooking now too?”
John took this seriously, aware of the faith Sherlock was placing in him, and determined to respond appropriately no matter what it was.  He wanted to stop moving while Sherlock said his piece, and slowed as he looked around for somewhere to pause.  “Let’s sit over there?”  he said, and pointed at a stone bench looking out over some yachts, moored in a small bay in front of an expensive looking apartment complex.  Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, clearly writing John off completely.  John snorted.  Good to know some things wouldn’t change!
Sherlock still looked unhappy, and frowned down at the bedspread as he dropped John’s hand, pulling his own back towards him and cradling them in his lap.  John panicked slightly, thinking about how best to move them along.
John gulped a little then, and went to sit down on the bed.  As he did, he noticed a beautiful chair in the corner – similar in size and shape to his one in the living room, but in a rich caramel coloured leather.  He picked himself up again, and walked over to sit in this chair instead, groaning with pleasure as he lowered himself into it.  He stretched backwards and let his head fall back as he spread his arms wide and ran his fingertips along the chair’s arms.  Sumptuous.
“I… I was just laying here wondering if you were disappointed that we didn’t do…
“Like what?”
Lestrade laughed now, openly.  That after the day they’d had, this was what Sherlock wanted Lestrade to keep his mouth shut about, was hilarious.
John paused, just in case Sherlock wanted to say something.  But he didn’t, it seemed.  Nothing about Sherlock’s expression indicated he was about to speak, or even particularly that he’d heard John.  But John knew that he had, and for now that would have to be enough.  John felt disappointed; his heart sank, and he suddenly felt exhausted.  The adrenalin had run out, then.  Clearly some part of him he’d buried had been hoping for a matching declaration, the passionate sharing of reciprocal feelings, even a soft acknowledgement that Sherlock was even remotely open to having the conversation.
Sherlock would have laughed at John using the word ‘cuddle’, but he found that that was exactly what he wanted to happen, and he didn’t think laughing was going to get him there.  He rolled onto his back, centring his head precisely on his pillow, and reached his arm out for John, who he found was already on his way.  John settled in along Sherlock’s side, resting his head in the dip between Sherlock’s shoulder and chest, and lightly resting his arm over Sherlock’s torso.  Their legs tangled together lightly.  “Close but not too close,” Sherlock thought with a smile.  “Trust John to know exactly what I’d like.”
… while we were here.”
The conversation with Molly on John’s stoop after Mary’s death was the hardest moment of Sherlock’s life.  He’d been tortured, shot, frightened out of his mind.  He’d thought his own life was over more times than he could count.  And yet, it’s on the doorstep of an unassuming garden apartment in suburban London that Sherlock realises his life is really over.
Lestrade laughed.  “Fair.  Look.  I don’t know what the answer is about the touching stuff.  I’ll just say this – and bear with me because I am awkward as fuck when talking about sex and frankly this is not a conversation I ever expected to have with another adult man.”  Lestrade took a deep breath, pausing for a moment as he thought about how best to put this.  He considered his marriage, his sexual experiences before and after, and how to relay them in a way that would help Sherlock out.  He made a mental note that this was probably the most awkward conversation of his life, but decided to proceed anyway.  No eye contact, because how could he?
After a while, John realised Sherlock’s breathing had changed.  Instead of the calm, steady flow from before, he could almost hear…
He noticed then the neat woven basket with a small selection of soft toys that was resting in the corner of the mat.  He crouched down and leaned in, taking out the top toy.  Unlike Rosie’s other soft toys – knitted woollen bears in soft whites and pale pinks, and fluffy pink rabbits with Liberty print ears, all gifts – these weren’t recognisable animals, and none of them were pink.  Upon closer inspection, this first one was a sloth, with long fingers and wide eyes, gazing back at him.  As Rosie grabbed for it, he released the sloth to her and she gave a gurgle of delight, whacking John with it to show her pleasure.  He reached into the basket to get the next soft toy – what appeared to be a teddy bear in a dark green smoking jacket with a bow tie and a full head of hair.  He laughed to himself and turned around to Sherlock, holding the bear out.
“You’ll be fine, Sherlock.  She’s just a baby.  Plus now she’s big enough that you won’t break her.”
Sherlock caught John’s eye. “Frisky!
Sherlock felt a tingle in his belly and found the mental image of John in the shower, John under the covers of his bed, John hunched over and pulling, tugging on himself, was giving him quite the physical reaction.  Sure he’d been uncomfortable in the past, torn between wanting to listen and knowing he should respect John’s boundaries.  But this felt different.  This felt… possible.
They smiled at each other – still a bit nervous, but feeling more and more familiar as the moments went on.  Sherlock was the first to move.
Sherlock trailed off here, and John pulled him into an embrace, feeling the need to be physically closer as he absorbed the weight of Sherlock’s emotions, and the interconnectedness for Sherlock of John’s love and Sherlock’s surprisingly traditional concepts of family.  He breathed in Sherlock’s smell, enjoying the rosemary and mint scent of the hotel’s shampoo, and the feeling of Sherlock’s linen shirt under his fingers.  It was looser than his London shirts, and John enjoyed the movement of the fabric as he rubbed his hands up and down Sherlock’s back as he held him.  He was glad for the contact, and also for the time to think without his face being scrutinised.  He knew it wasn’t fair, but some part of him was wondering how they could possibly be discussing kids when Sherlock hadn’t actually said he wanted to be in a relationship with John yet.  Or even really shared his own feelings.
he’s written
“What?  No.”
Sherlock sucked in a breath.  Clearly the thought hadn’t occurred to him.  Experiments!  With John! In bed!  The mind boggled.
to John that Sherlock would want children.  When John thought of their lives together, with or without a romantic component, children hadn’t factored in at all.  John shook himself a little and felt guilty at that; in some ways John had fed right into what Sherlock already thought about himself.  He determined to do better to be more understanding.  Sherlock wouldn’t have said it unless he truly felt it – he wasn’t a sharer at the best of times – and he’d clearly been aware this may not receive a welcome reaction even before he’d volunteered it.
John smiled back at him.  “So… The choice is yours.  I got a room with two beds because I thought it might be a bit soon to share, and I wanted you to have the option.” Sherlock looked mildly displeased at the notion of his own bed.  “But – I should hasten to say – I would love it if you joined me here.”  Sherlock brightened up at this.  “And of course, I think this goes without saying, but nothing needs to happen.”
They sat in silence for a moment, both watching Sherlock’s thumb.  John breathed out deeply, actually feeling more relief now even than when Sherlock had arrived.  He really wanted to hug Sherlock, but wasn’t sure if that would be too much too fast.  He suppressed it, deciding that slower was better.
Lestrade took a breath before starting, wanting to be honest with Sherlock but not freak him out.  It was a fine line.  “Because I’ve seen you two together, Sherlock.  I’ve known you both for years.  I see the way he looks at you.  And often, you know, the way that you look at him.  It’s there for anyone to see – you’re connected, deeply.  I can almost see a physical tether between you – you know exactly where the other one is at all times, you’re in each other’s space, and then you spring apart, but never too far.  You communicate with a series of meaningful looks and eyebrow movements.  You drive each other mad, but only because you deeply understand each other.  And I don’t think John has many people in his life who really get him.  I try, obviously, and there are others who think he’s great, but he doesn’t let people in.  But he let you in.  More than even he realised, I suspect.”
John followed along to where Sherlock had pointed, and looked quite pleased at the outcome.  There were four seating spaces around a low-ish table.  Two wicker chairs, bigger and deeper than those on the room balcony, with thick navy blue cushions with white piping, and a matching sofa.  Sherlock plonked himself down on one side of the sofa, and John pursed his lips as he decided whether to sit next to Sherlock on the sofa, or perpendicular to him on the chair.
“Going to Malta.  To join John.  Keep up, Graham.”
John took his sunglasses off and schooled his face into something more relaxed.  “Oh, mate.  No worries.  Sorry that I swore, I was just a bit startled, that’s all.”
“So, did you have a nice day?” Sherlock said after a pause, looking around the room and hoping to lighten things up a bit.
“The gang’s all there, indeed.  I can’t believe you’re ready for my child to have a bath at your place - she’s got a better set up here than in her own home!  And since when did you have a bathtub?”
“So… did you also change the wallpaper?  It looks familiar, but also different?”
“Come here.”
“Me too.”  Sherlock smiled at John cautiously, and they held each other’s gaze.  Without letting go of John’s hand, Sherlock shifted around so he was facing John square on, one leg bent on the bed, and the other trailing off the side.  This was more comfortable, and facilitated Sherlock’s continued inspection John’s face.  John did, in fact, look relieved.  His face had relaxed, and Sherlock realised how much tension it had been holding these last few months.
Sherlock nodded slowly and approvingly, “That’s good feedback.  Actionable, direct.  Thank you, John.”
“No, I know.  I don’t feel pressured by what you said.  And I don’t think you necessarily mean any time soon… I get that you just meant it was on your mind.  I had personally stopped thinking about it, but that doesn’t mean I’m averse to the idea, it would just… you know… reframe things a bit.  All I’m saying is that if it’s really something that’s important to you, and it sounds like it is, then it merits further discussion.  We only get one life, Sherlock, and we owe it to ourselves to do everything we can to secure those things that feel
John snorted and grinned, reaching out to take Sherlock’s hand as he stood.
“Sherlock, we just ate!”  John didn’t even open his eyes.
Sherlock crossed one leg over the other and tried to hide the evidence of how John’s answer affected him.  Not that it was terribly risqué, but the implications were… enticing.  He looked up at Lestrade, and was unsurprised to see that Lestrade was deliberately looking away from Sherlock.  The rustle of Sherlock’s trousers probably told Lestrade all he needed to know, anyway.  Loath as Sherlock was to admit it, Lestrade was no idiot.
“Excellent choice!” Sherlock said enthusiastically, and spun John around down a side street.  No Google Maps, no street signage, no previous trips here, and yet the man apparently knew exactly where he was.  John chuckled.  Trust Sherlock to acclimatise immediately to the walled city.  John hurried a bit to keep up – Sherlock had abandoned “wandering together” in favour of a “keep up, John, it’s long past adventure time” approach.  Given his singular focus, he was lucky they hadn’t marched into traffic.
“Excellent, you’re here!  Now, did you decide you want to get those shorts, or do you want to see what other colours they have?   You didn’t even look in the “Magical” section – the patterns appear only when you get wet!  I know you aren’t much one for a pattern unless it’s checks, and I don’t think they’ll have that here!”   Sherlock chuckled to himself as he continued to touch all the accessories within reach.
“Guildford… in England.”
Sherlock stood up straighter, surprised that Lestrade knew him that well.  He looked around suspiciously and wondered if he was being watched.  Even though he hadn’t texted Lestrade to find out about the teabags, the timing was unbelievable.
depth?”
John enjoyed this spectacle for a moment – it had been a long time since he’d seen Sherlock this gleeful – and then did a double take as he took in the room.
“Sherlock, it’s amazing.  I love it.”  John looked down to Rosie’s head on his chest, and watched her pudgy little hands clutching the bear. He dropped a soft kiss on her head, and looked back up.  “We both love it.”
“Oh, no reason.  I am just struggling a bit with this conversation and I’m a bit afraid of what John’s written answer might be.  Ignore me.  I’ll just sit over here quietly dying of embarrassment while you read it.”
Sherlock pushed open the door and led John inside.  The room was flushed with late afternoon light from the far window; that sort of golden glow that makes everything warmer. The blinds were up, and John admired the new feature wall: a dark, sumptuous green that suited Sherlock down to a tee.  Against it rested a new headboard of dove grey, juxtaposed with crisp white sheets, white pillows, white everything on the bed.  The room was sophisticated, John thought with a start.  It felt surprisingly grown up; a real man’s bedroom.  It was posh, but not in a showy way.  How very Sherlock!  Clean angles everywhere he looked, high contrast between the white and green, and impeccably neat.   John idly wondered where all the Things had gone – the last time he’d been at 221B, there had certainly been a lot of Things.
“It’s Chopin, obviously.”
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully.  “Yes, I can see that. In retrospect, it’s not that John was particularly subtle, it’s more that… you know, nothing had changed.  I knew he loved me – he’d never said it, but I knew.  But that was different.  Because I knew I loved him too, and we’d always been this way.”  Sherlock gestured around the room, and Lestrade nodded understandingly.
It went no further than that, but they rested there for long minutes, each comfortable in his own thoughts and enjoying the embrace.  With his eyes closed, Sherlock realised it was less of a choice and more of an imperative as he relaxed further and struggled to open them.
“Well, I was googling around for hotels – I’d already decided on Malta – and they were all pretty expensive, it being peak summer and all.”  Sherlock nodded at this.  “And so I shut off my laptop and went to bed, wondering what my best approach was given the prices.  Then, mysteriously, the next day I got an email from the Hilton loyalty program, which I had no memory of ever having joined, with a generous discount offer for this exact week.  It said I could use the voucher anywhere in Europe, but the main photo in the email was of this hotel, and in the corner, in small white writing it said, ‘Hilton Malta’.”
John paused, slowing them down but continuing the movement.  He changed angles, reaching down to adjust them so their cocks were lined up next to each other.  “This should feel good.” Sherlock gasped with pleasure as John moved and Sherlock understood immediately.  Even through both sets of pants, Sherlock’s sensitivity skyrocketed.
“You’re amazing”, whispered John, softly grazing Sherlock’s belly as he lay back down.  Sherlock gasped a little at the skin-to-skin contact, new as it was.  John was so warm, so alive.  Sherlock kissed John’s neck, John’s collarbone, John’s sternum, moving steadily across his chest and down.  John opened his legs a little so Sherlock could rest between them and press his weight more fully on John.  This change of angle felt good, so good.
Lestrade’s eyebrows raised.  How they’d gone from the soul-searching, woe-is-me Sherlock of an hour ago to this cheerful mania, he didn’t understand at all.
John’s eyes were closed and he was clearly kidding, just enjoying the feel of Sherlock’s hand on him and shifting his face so he could kiss rhythmically up Sherlock’s neck.  He didn’t notice that Sherlock’s eyes had blown wide at this comment.  It hadn’t been his intention, and yet…
“Do you want me to google flights for you?”
John snorted.  “Right-o, then.”
“He did what?”
“Don’t you like it?  We can put it back the way it was, if you preferred that…?”
“You weren’t?”
“Really, Sherlock – this doesn’t seem like you at all.  This isn’t what I expected when we came over today.”
John rolled his eyes at the description of them as old men, particularly given the incredible body before him, but declined to comment, instead inspecting the ladder down into the water below.  Perfect!  He took off his sunglasses and dropped them into the bag with his phone, book, water, and room key, intending to make his way over to it.  Sherlock stopped him.
The two watched Rosie drop the sloth unceremoniously to the floor as she made a bid to grab Chopin from Sherlock.  Sherlock made the bear dance a little again, before gently placing him in her hands.  John looked back up to Sherlock’s face and saw him watching John closely; a tentative, enquiring look.  It had been a long time since John had seen Sherlock so vulnerable, and he felt a twinge in his chest.
John cracked one eye open, squinted at Sherlock.  “Sure,” he said, then closed it again, relaxing his face.
John paused, thinking about what that meant.  Unlike Lestrade to share a detail he didn't think was important.  John wasn’t that surprised that the physical side of a potential relationship would be the biggest barrier for Sherlock – he’d written a special FAQ for it, after all – but he was surprised that Sherlock had raised it with Lestrade of all people, even though Lestrade had been the only one there.  John wondered what Lestrade had advised.  He half wanted to respect the privacy of their conversations yesterday, but he was deeply curious too.
Seeing Sherlock start to spiral, John stood up quickly, striding across the room to where Sherlock stood by the closet.  Sherlock stopped talking, surprised by the movement.  John looked up into his face, read the worry and the planning and the overwhelming desire to please John and make it all better, and put his hand lightly on Sherlock’s cheek, thumb stroking gently across Sherlock’s cheekbone.
There is so much shared history between the two of them that it burns a hole in his heart whenever he thinks about it. Every moment where they ought to have but didn’t, every smile they shared and flirtatious exchange they suppressed. A death, a wedding, a baby. The distance seems to stretch on as Sherlock tries to reconcile who they were with who they now are. He wonders if it’s too late for them to become what they should have been all along. He wonders if
Sherlock doesn’t reply, breathing heavily, his eyes searching John’s face like he did so many times in the past. John knows what he wants to understand, knows what he wants to do right this very second. His body acts before his brain can catch up, hands rising from the sand to Sherlock’s face, most likely itching against his skin, but there isn’t a trace of complaint in Sherlock’s eyes.
, Sherlock had beaten him to it.
His feelings, apparently.
“Shall we order room service?” Sherlock asks lightly, the smile dancing on his lips not matching the flatness in his eyes.
If you’re really not dead, don’t fucking come home.
Sherlock says nothing.
John doesn’t respond, just gathers him up in both arms and cradles him, as though he’s fragile, as though he means something when, really, hasn’t he just revealed the exact opposite?
Sherlock stops, falling silent for a long moment.
I am in love with you, and it has been making my life a constant mix of bright happiness and aching hurt.
After much fruitless searching and self-negotiation, Sherlock knows what he has to do, but he doesn’t like it. Sometimes, there’s only one person who can help and, most of the time, it’s the person he leasts want to go to for help in the world. It’s kind of like selling his soul to the devil every time he asks for a favour, knowing there will be an unsavoury exchange made in future.
“All done,” Elaine says as she wipes the area one last time.
“Alright,” John chuckles and lifts their joint hands to his mouth to plant a kiss on Sherlock’s. “Five more minutes. Then we should seriously think about getting on with it. The rest, we do tomorrow.”
“Was that alright?”
The conversation doesn’t flow at all, but they do manage to talk a bit, between deductions and interrogations.
Sherlock turns around, walking away.
Sighing loudly, John rubs a hand over his face and unlocks his phone again. He finds Julian’s number quickly and types a first text.
“Sherlock,” John calls over his rambling. “Stop.”
The dust leaves almost as quickly as it came. Some experts claim that they knew it was just another, bigger Dust Bowl all along, while others warn that it will return, worse next time.
But if alcohol was what you needed to talk about this, then okay, I’m fine with doing this now. Just, please, mention this in your next letter, ok? I just want to be sure you’re alright with what I’m about to say next.
You would?
brief
It’s not until late at night that it usually happens. Sherlock can see the signs, of course, with a mix of excitement and anticipation building up all day. He catches John looking at him for long minutes, watches him getting lost in his own head once or twice, but doesn’t say a word about any of it. He knows by the time Rosie will be asleep and they’ll retreat to the living room that John will be brave enough for the two of them and say whatever needs to be said. And so he waits. Patiently, or at least as patiently as he possibly can. He locks himself in his Mind Palace, the one or so method he has found to pass time a little faster while trapped in 221B.
The outside air looks as though it’s been replaced with dust alone, the oxygen infiltrated and morphed into something ugly and hateful, twisting their lifeline into a disfigured thing that you can’t tear your eyes from.
Tell me, Sherlock. We can’t keep hiding what we think, what we want to tell the other.
Suddenly, the waiter comes to clear their plates and John coughs, seemingly remembering himself and where he is.
Jhon. SH
“I’m sorry about the phone call,” Sherlock finally says.
- blame you.
Sherlock sighs, looking at him and thrusting his hips against John’s very slowly. “Does it really matter?”
When he wakes up, the call is cut but he has an unread email.
“Mmm… hang on,” John stills him, and unzips himself, shucking off his jeans and pants in as little time as humanly possible. “Now where were we?” he asks, settling back down and kissing a hard, bruising path down Sherlock’s jaw and neck, sucking a stinging love bite right next to his Adam's apple.
“Sounds interesting,” John smiles.
“I know,” John whispers, nodding.
“Yes, yes,” John replies. “More than alright.”
What he really feels, above all else, though, is the prevailing sense of unfairness. He has given John all of himself. As much as he was able to give, anyway. And in return? All he’s left with is questions and obfuscations. He often feels as though he has flayed himself wide open for John Watson to inspect, to have, to take. What he’s never realised before this very moment, however, was that he was the only one doing so. The only one giving. The only one pushing and talking and inviting and seeing and worrying and wondering and, yes, loving. Before this very moment, the realisation that John is selfish had never dawned on him before. He’d always seen their relationship as perfectly reciprocal. He the yin to John’s yang somehow. Even when that delicate balance was disturbed by time away and Mary and conflict, somehow there was always the sense that there were two of them - just the two of them against the rest of the world. He thought it was that way and that it’d always
And it’s stupid because he could just stay. He could just refuse this job that sounds too good to be true and find something here, even if it takes months, even if it means he’ll be useless and just good at… well, not much actually.
And she’s a very, very lucky little girl. SH
John thinks, wondering why exactly he hasn’t said it out loud yet.
That’s all I need. All that could make me resist just one last drink. All that could make it alright again.
Sherlock looked stunned at this, then worried.  “John… I didn’t mean…”
“John, she’s pulling my laces!”
you?!”
“Screw you!” Sherlock said, without heat.
John raised his eyebrows, interested by this idea and thinking through the practical implications.  “I’d tell you what I’m thinking even if I think it’d freak you out?”
Sherlock looked around at the space – the new, cream carpet, the blue patterned area rug, a brand new wooden bed with beautiful slats and textured navy blue duvet cover – and shrugged in faux casualness.  “Don’t you like it?  I thought it was all very you!”
John laughed, and ruffled Sherlock’s hair familiarly as he said in a sing-song voice, “I’m proud of you.  Now, what do you think?  Teeth then pyjamas, or pyjamas and then teeth?”
Lestrade’s eyes widened and he gulped.  Embarrassment washed over him.  He got a sudden, vivid mental picture of Sherlock pressing John up against a wall, holding John’s hands above his head as he kissed him passionately, rhythmically thrusting into him.  He shook his head abruptly, shuddering and willing those thoughts away.  Sherlock looked amused, and Lestrade flushed, thinking his mental scene must have been perfectly apparent to Sherlock.
He strode back to his chair and dug in the gap between the cushion and the chair’s arm, looking for his phone.  Blasted thing always fell out of his pocket and down the side.  Scooping it up, and brushing the crumbs that also inhabited that space casually onto his trousers, Sherlock sent a text.
“Well… you know… I did some reading and all the books say it’s much better for kids to have baths and you can lean over and play with them and whatnot.  The whole shower thing would have been too hard.”
“Does everyone know?”
A cab!  For John, alone!  Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever known John to do that.  John, who protested the expense of shared cabs for years, before giving up and acknowledging that Sherlock wasn’t going to change his behaviour.  It’s not that Sherlock didn’t like the Tube – he did, the system was very clever and efficient, and worked well for the rest of the city’s people – but it wasn’t as good as whisking through London’s streets with full visibility around him and John by his side.  Just the two of them.
“Yes, Sherlock.”
“What’s got you chuckling over there?”
“Yes, I was rather on notice that you might text me.”
“I don’t want to go to the airport.  I did already consider chasing after him but I dismissed that because I don’t know what I’d say.  And I think if you’re going to chase down a man who’s just been that honest with you, you need to know what you’re going to say, one way or the other.”
John shook himself.  No point embarrassing himself further.  He stood, and pulled the paper out from his document wallet, and handed it to Sherlock, who took it silently.
John rolled back over to face Sherlock, wondering what was next.
“No, well, yes.  I’m sure there is breakfast downstairs, with all that lot.  But look – this bar is serving breakfast and then we can sit alone on the balcony in those comfy chairs.”  At this, Sherlock gestured outside on same floor as the lobby, where there did seem to be some sort of service.  John looked dubiously at the inside bar, and then outside again.
“She’s on the floor!” said Sherlock with surprise, looking down at his feet as she crawled towards them.  John smiled a little as he looked from Rosie all the way up Sherlock’s long body to his face.  She did look particularly small down there when faced with Sherlock’s height.  He wondered idly if all adults looked the same to Rosie, or she could tell that Sherlock was particularly lanky.
Well, this was new then.  Sherlock looked down again at the paper John had pressed into his hand.  An FAQ indeed!  For a conversation Sherlock had been a part of!  Though… he couldn’t really say he’d been an active participant, could he?  He’d just listened.  Maybe that’s why John had done the FAQ – so Sherlock’s Qs could be answered, when he hadn’t even tried to ask them while John had been in the room.
Sherlock nodded.  “Yes and no – I really did enjoy myself the other day in the pool.  It reminded me how great it is to speak to children and hear their unfiltered opinions and experience their unfiltered emotions.  In some ways they’re easier for me, because they don’t care that I’m not good at ‘The Rules’.  But it was also just watching you.  You were so light and easy and unselfconscious.  You would have thrown that ball for hours if he’d stayed.  You looked more like ‘you’ than you have in ages.  It’s the ‘you’ I love the most, and I loved seeing that.  So a lot of it was actually about us, doing it together.  And I think an older kid who really needed us would be the best beneficiary of that love.”
“Pip-pip, indeed,” said John to himself, shaking his head as he followed Sherlock out and pulling the door closed.
“That’s ok – it’s maybe the most comfortable chair I’ve sat in in my entire life.  I don’t think I need it to rock.”
“Come on, old bean, old sock, old thing!”
Sherlock continued to look confused.  “But…”
“Sure… I’m not really hungry, but I’ll come and join you.”
“Also, look, there’s a ladder.  So we can lower ourselves in like the old men that we are, and have the same sea swimming experience without any risk of paralysis.  It’s win-win!”
Moments later, Sherlock whipped the door open and emerged into the corridor, shirtless but wearing the violently orange shorts John had seen him inspecting.  John’s lip curled involuntarily at the sight.
“Ok.” And Sherlock was off like a rocket, shedding his shirt then dodging loungers and picking his way nimbly up the stairs to the pool.  John let his head fall back on the lounger once more, wondering if he’d already had a bit much sun.  He leaned forward, then, and quickly scooted over to Sherlock’s lounger to sit in the shade for a second.  He took a long drink of water, and put his sunglasses back on.  That was better.
He angled his body towards John, drinking him in.  “You’re not embarrassed by me.”
“Enough reading.  It’s time to pack.  Also I’ll need a flight, as you say.  I assume there are more flights to Malta tonight.  Otherwise I’ll have to wait until tomorrow, which isn’t ideal.”
John snorted, not finding that terribly reassuring.
“What do you mean?”
“Well, trust me Sherlock, it’s always work when it involves you,” Lestrade smirked.  Sherlock frowned a moment before realising Lestrade was joking.
Sherlock didn’t acknowledge this, pressing on without pausing.  “You are
“Well, the feeling’s mutual then, Miss Rosie.  What do you say you face out, then?  You can see the world! Lots of time for cuddles later, I should think.”  And with this, he shot John a hopeful look, and John nodded back.  “Lots of time for that.  I think she really does prefer looking out – she likes to point things out and chat away at birds and buses and things.”
“We’re not there yet,” John remarks, looking outside the window.
“Yes, you can,” he replies, soft and quiet.
You only need to look at my letters to understand it.
you live, John?
She was never any of that, Sherlock. Yes, I loved her, and yes, for a time, she made me happy. But she was, and always had been, a way to stop myself from doing something stupid. I was so alone, Sherlock, and there she was. Smiling and funny and interested in me despite my constant state of mourning. She listened and she waited, and I was finally starting to realise how lucky I was to have found someone to talk to again. I imagined a future with her, of course I did. One I thought I’d never get to have, one I never really considered - or needed - before, and for a while, it was something to look forward to. But that was all. I realise now how much of a jerk I sound like, talking about her as if she never really meant anything to me, and I need you to understand that she did count.
,” that truly, desperately breaks John’s heart.
“More than one maybe.”
But you have to understand, you not coming back would have been a thousand times worse. The two years I spent thinking you were dead were the worst of my life, Sherlock. At the most random moments of the day I would think about the way you looked on that pavement, or the feeling of your wrist as I searched for a pulse. It still haunts my nightmares, but you came back, Sherlock.
John lifts his head to look into Sherlock’s eyes. “I’d love to,” he whispers.
I want to move on.
“He said he was scared.”
John hurries to shake his head, “No, of course not.” He stops, inhaling deeply and squeezing Sherlock’s hand. “I’m terrified of what it could mean just to have this conversation.”
“Shouldn’t I be asking you about Lestrade?” Sherlock finally replies. “He is your more friend than mine.”
Sherlock kneels down in front of him, resting his chin in John’s lap. “What can I do?”
Maybe… No, nevermind.
And, Sherlock, making sure you’re alright was never an inconvenience.
, John thinks with a grin and sucks at Sherlock’s pulse point.
Now John is definitely suspicious. Sherlock has never, and he means
Sherlock nods, one hand coming to trace patterns on John’s naked chest.
“Don’t you dare,” Sherlock replies.
I’ve looked for you everywhere, Sherlock. I even went to the train station, searched every pub and open store. Where are you? Just answer me, or text me, I don’t know. Just let me know you’re okay. We need to talk about this. You can’t just leave.
“Did you notice the difference in softness between the two?”
He wishes for nothing more than to understand all of Sherlock, to know his every fear and learn how to make them smaller and smaller with each kiss and reassuring touch. But he knows Sherlock needs, and will need, time. They both do. Opening up with letters and texts seems so much easier, not having to face the other’s eyes as you confess in quiet whispers the demons still haunting you. John only has to pull away to look at Sherlock’s, marking his back in long, deep scars. They haven’t talked about it yet, not properly, and last night was another step forward. Still, John has so many questions. He wants to know where, when and how Sherlock got each one of them. He wants to know if they still hurt, if he still thinks he’s doing it all over again.
They get ready fast. John does his best to keep his eyes to himself, knowing he’ll jump on Sherlock if he lets them linger on his naked body for too long. It doesn’t stop him from catching Sherlock’s stare on him, and by the time they’re both dressed, John can’t help but feel ridiculously happy. Sherlock takes his hand as soon as they’re outside, pushing Rosie’s trolley with the other hand. They fall silent, neither of them saying a word all the way to the park, and even then, John watches in silences as Sherlock puts Rosie down on the grass before sitting on a bench. John waits another second before going to sit next to him.
But that’s gone. Isn’t it?
“Nights are warm here,” Sherlock says, startling him. “You won’t need that jacket.”
From around five thirty onwards, Sherlock is somehow even more of a nervous mess than he was the previous evening. He strategically leaves his date shirt hanging over the back of his chair until ten to seven, at which point he attempts to close it slowly, carefully, methodically, willing time to move by filling it with this one small thing. He then goes to wait by the window as the minutes pass leading up to seven o’clock. He knows now that there is no more being coy - not even with himself.
“Alright,” he says, half out of his mind. “I’ll just pack and go, then.”
Sherlock chuckles at that for a second. “You’re not serious?”
Useless adrenaline courses through his veins as he considers what could be. As badly as he wants it, he doesn’t know if he can even have it. The years and months and weeks and days and hours that span from then to now seem to forbid it. There’s so much that has gone wrong - more than what has gone right. There is so much to forgive and move over and move towards. There have been times, especially recently, when they haven’t even been friends, let alone anything more. There have been words that can never be unsaid and fists that can never be put down and apologies that only glossed over what stung more than anything. There has been
Sherlock is warm against him, so tall and at the same time fitting inside John’s arms perfectly. The kiss turns into something much more heated, hips moving on their own and erections meeting in the middle. John breaks away, panting against Sherlock’s lips while searching his eyes for any sign of discomfort. But he only finds bare need there, Sherlock’s fingers leaving marks on John’s back.
Sherlock’s grin escalates into something he fears is truly ridiculous after that, at which point John asks, “What?”, as though there is anything normal or casual about this entire conversation.
They lie in silence for a while after Sherlock’s gesture, examining the other’s faces, as though imprinting them upon their memories. They think of nothing. Peace hovers over them, blemished only by the fact that they aren’t in a glass bubble and the atmosphere surrounding their sleepy haven is still toxic.
Sherlock nods in agreement, “This is more difficult than I thought it’d be.”
I don’t know… SH
They arrive at the Airbnb without having exchanged a word. Sherlock doesn’t turn the lights on, taking his shoes off and walking to the bedroom immediately. John watches him, now feeling hopeless and a little lost. He can’t have misunderstood what just happened, right? He said it all - well, the most important thing - and Sherlock had kind of said it back, in his own way. And he kissed him back. Several times, actually. That has to count for something.
He only has to wait a second before Sherlock appears from the kitchen, a concerned look on his face and something close to worry dancing in his eyes. John smiles, walking toward him and sliding both arm around his waist, “Sorry it’s late, we had several emergencies today and I couldn’t even find the time to send a single text.”
“But Joh-”
“What’s everything?” Sherlock’s voice is barely audible, but John doesn’t need him to say more.
“Wait wait wait!”
“What is it, love?”
Sherlock gathers his legs against his chest, resting his chin on his knees. He looks so vulnerable, so far from his natural element, that John is afraid he could simply vanish, disappear into the rising sun and cease to be Sherlock Holmes.
They’re just inside the door when John stops, cups Sherlock’s face in both his hands and says, “Hey. You’re so beautiful, I’m always in awe,” and Sherlock wants to cry and scream, something akin to elation bubbling over inside of him. He looks away, feeling exposed, but John catches him by the chin again: “I mean it. You’re bloody gorgeous.”
“You know what, why don’t you tell me where you’d want to run off to.” John kisses his head. “Come on, you must have some ideas.”
“Wait, did I promise to watch ALL of them?”
John laughs this time, pulling Sherlock’s face down to kiss him, “Not sure I could even if I tried,” he says.
“Sherlock?” His eyes flutter open again, just in time to see Sherlock get rid of his shirt and trousers. “Coming in?” John teases, finding himself already growing harder just at the sight of Sherlock’s bare torso.
John leans in for another quick kiss. “We do now. I decided on it while watching you sleep.”
“What are we doing for Christmas? It is tomorrow, after all.”
Now. SH
“Trust each other enough to know how we feel?”
I’m scared, Sherlock. I'm scared but at the same time I can't wait for you to be here.
“I blame Mrs Hudson and her remark about the second bedroom,” John replies, smiling. “From the very start, she insinuated that we’d be using yours only. Made it our room, even for just a second or so.”
Sherlock stands up, already going for his coat without an answer. John finishes his soup as quickly as possible, grabbing his phone and jacket and rushing downstairs to find Sherlock already waving for a cab.
John barely has the time to start typing a reply and a new message comes in.
You were right that first night - I crave the danger and adrenaline (I probably always will), but the ways you provide me with both were entirely different from what it felt like to be out there in the desert. Afghanistan was like being cut off from the world, all of us trapped in our terrible and horrific reality. London, Baker Street, you… It was so much more, Sherlock.
“I can’t stand it anymore.”
Yours,
“‘I can be at the bank in twenty minutes, the other board members are gone. Can you meet me there?’” He looks up at Sherlock. “Alright with you?”
John grins, seemingly grateful for the break in the reflectful musings. “Hey, don’t push it,” he winks. “And for the record, even though, on paper, I’ve had this before, I’ve also not exactly had
“Manage to surprise me every single time. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a sex life this exciting before.”
“John, I - I never meant to pry,” Sherlock says even though it’s not what he means to say at all.
John is silent, thoughtful, for a moment before he speaks. “You know,” he says, fingers now in Sherlock’s hair, rubbing little spirals into his scalp in the most mesmerising way possible. “I understand your apprehension and that you’d think a simple man like me would only care for simple pleasures such as sex, but did it ever occur to you that your lack of experience could be something of a turn on?”
But still, it is yet another conversation they need to have. They’ve already taken the time to properly express their feelings the very first night they kissed, and if it has been both intense and a relief, John knew there were many more they had to say to each other. And Rosie was a huge part of it.
“You’re so beautiful,” he whispers, not caring in the slightest how silly he might sound.
“Can you stay? I mean… Would you like to? Stay like this until we sleep?”
“Goodbye, John.”
John doesn’t say anything when Sherlock wraps himself around him, face against his neck and tears wetting his skin.
“I’m sorry about that. Truly. It’s a funny thing, being so deep in denial. First there was my fragile masculinity to consider. And then. Then there was Mary,” John’s voice falters a bit as he says her name, and Sherlock squeezes his hand, just once.
“Mmm. Petty mortal things.”
John turns to look at him get out of bed, bare arse on display. He doesn’t bother to suppress a needy sigh.
Sherlock goes willingly when John pushes him down the bed. He pulls the cover away, not needing them anyway.
“I mustn't hold you back any longer,” Mrs Hudson declares at the end of the story. “Finding the right rings can be so difficult, you’re going to need time to properly choose.”
I love you, Sherlock, and right now I feel like this love could make us do anything.
“John.”
With hope and anticipation,
“Tell me,” Sherlock says soft and quiet.
Yes, I’ll always be there for you, and I’ll always be in your life, even in a small way, but I can no longer be the man that I was for you. Especially because you never asked me to be. I inserted myself into your life in such a pivotal way without your consent, let alone your request. I made up a fiction in my head where I was crucial in some way; that, without me, you’d still be or return to being the same lost soul I came to know all those years ago.
“Should I take a look?” John offers, standing on the other side of the chair, keeping his distance.
He considers for a moment. “Fair point.”
“I’m pretty sure she’s getting me one, too,” John replies. “Why?”
and he gasps a tiny breath, which causes John to try and remove his hand. Sherlock quickly traps it where it is, encouraging him and John smiles his lopsided smile of fondness. Something low and deep in Sherlock’s belly comes to life.
The gush that greets them on the other side of the door is unexpected, even after all this time. One never grows used to devastation, after all. Umbrellas, packets, dirt, all float up, up, up with the dust, little pockets of dirty tornadoes twisting and lining the streets. They squint their eyes and pinch their lips shut, breathing the bare minimum through their nostrils, which are lined with brown already.
“Thank you again,” John says, unable to tear his eyes from Rosie.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, coming around the table and John can’t help but jump in surprise when he sits next to him and cups his face with both hands.
“Do you?” John suddenly turned serious, as though this was the most important thing in the world for him to get right. “Do you really know?”
, while Sherlock gasps for air, his panic clearly still clinging to him.
Without a word, John gets into bed too, lying down directly. Sherlock imitates him, sliding down until his head is resting on the pillow. John turns to face him, but Sherlock continues to stare at the ceiling. With everything they already shared the day before, it shouldn’t still be this strange to be in the same bed. And yet, John can’t help but wonder if it isn’t always going to be. After years of fantasising about it, of imagining different scenarios where they found themselves in the same bed, of course the reality of it all is going to feel weird. Surely Sherlock must feel it too. Surely he also imagined— Oh. Yes. Of course.
There's a lot at stake for the both of us, love, but that's a good thing. We’re getting there, together.
As for what we are to other, I think Boyfriend is the right term for now, yes. I know it might seem silly, or at least it does to me, but I want everyone to know you’re mine. I want to be able to hold your hand while we walk in the park or work at a crime scene. I want our legs to brush under the table at restaurant. I want to be able to kiss you whenever I want, just because I can. As I’ve said before, I am yours, Sherlock, and I want to whole world to know it.
More letters, then?
I’m not going to pick up on your
Not that it hadn’t taken a whole lot of work to get here. He remembers that day like it was yesterday: he had come to 221B to tell Sherlock how he had felt and, maddeningly, of course,
A luxury he can’t afford, no matter how badly his hateful heart insists otherwise. He didn’t choose this. Given the option, he wouldn’t want it. Yes, it has made him capable of a lot more, emotionally speaking, but, if anything, all it has brought him is grief. One grief after another, all tumbling together to form an avalanche of heartache, so deep and so varied that it frightens him at times.
Sherlock smiles proudly, “I did.”
“More than a friend,” John admits with a kind of faraway regret. “But nothing more than that.”
You’ll have to stop t-tickling me then.” He could barely breathe by this point.
“A list of first times.”
“I’d love to,” John replies, this time giving in and raising himself up to place a tender kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
He turns to look John in the eyes then and sees nothing but warmth and lust, his eyelids lightly hooded as he continues tracing patterns on Sherlock’s leg. He can’t quite help it - he lets out a small groan, which makes John lick his lips, his pupils dilating.
Yours,
“No, I do,” Sherlock sighs. “I panicked, and I don’t want you to think that I don’t trust you, because I do, I swear I do, but I couldn’t stop thinking and then there were all these pictures in my head and-”
John turns to his side, the small duvet falling to the floor. He doesn’t try to reach for it; it’s too hot anyway. And it’s not as if he was near to falling asleep. Although coming here had felt like the brightest idea three days ago, he isn’t sure if it still is now. The ten hour flight had allowed him to imagine lots of scenarios, all of them involving kissing at some point. And the speech, of course. The words he had played inside his head over and over again, a mixture of what he wrote plus some ideas that had seemed pretty great at the time.
“Has it ever occurred to you that some things are better left alone?”
Me neither, John. SH
Sherlock keeps his face hidden as he murmurs, “Why?”
“I’m not hungry,” he says, eyes shut tight.
PS: The photo was taken five days ago. She misses you too.
. As if it were allowed to even happen.
“Thank you so much, love,” John says, putting it aside so that he can kiss Sherlock for long minutes. “I adore it.”
“That’s just sentiment talking.”
John hangs up his last pieces of clothing and turns to walk back to him. He crawls on top of him, pushing his hair back and leaning down slowly to kiss him. Sherlock’s arms come to circle his waist, trying to force him fall on top of him but John doesn’t give in, half laughing into the kiss. Sherlock changes his strategy then, his fingers now on John’s robe, trying to remove it quickly.
John Watson
“Hmm, I was thinking the flat was too quiet too,” John laughs. “Mrs Hudson?”
“I wish I could be kissing you right now,” he says as Sherlock finishes sending notes and evidence to Lestrade.
Sherlock looks up at him, lips stretching into a smile.
“Ah. Tomorrow then, when you’ve had more time to -”
“I’m happy you do,” Sherlock says, eyes going to the gift next to John’s feet.
“Always so surprising.”
I’d love to experience firsthand some of that so-called untoward behaviour. SH
“Perfect,” Sherlock smiles, spreading his legs wider.
“Please, John, can we at least try?”
I miss you.
John is starting to think they might just keep kissing on this beach forever when a drunken voice calls behind them,
Feeling his smile widen, John rolls his eyes, “Please tell me they’re going to stay over there?”
“Well, I’m certainly glad I live up to the fantasy version of me,” Sherlock teases lightly, kissing John’s cheek as they round another corner.
“...”
Sherlock nods, “I want to be with you, the two of you.”
Molly gave me your letter. I won’t bother you or Rosie again.
“A que- What, Sherlock? What question could warrant you ringing me at one in the morning on a work night?” John’s tone is exasperated, but Sherlock knows it’s still fond. Perhaps teasing, even.
- or sort of - but the feeling is right there, lodged in his chest, ready to burst out. Still, he forces himself to get out of bed as quietly as possible. Even though he already rested enough, Sherlock clearly needs more sleep. Besides, Mycroft had delivered all of his belongings in boxes yesterday evening. That had made Sherlock curse out loud several times and so John had managed to shut him up with some kissing and then much more than just that.
“You know, it’s not really fair that your shirt is still on,” Sherlock comments after a while.
“When what happens?” Sherlock asks quietly.
The afternoon and evening pass almost too quickly. Rosie takes a very short nap and then it’s only a matter of keeping her busy until bathtime. Sherlock plays some violin and John listens while trying to lull Rosie to sleep. When it doesn’t work, Sherlock offers to read to her and it does seem to keep her occupied longer than the violin did. She turns the pages with him and points at the words and pictures while babbling, and Sherlock answers as if he understands each and every question. John takes advantage of this moment to continue his own book, glancing now and then to the two of them on the sofa and finding it hard to focus on his story. When reading isn’t an option anymore, John goes to fetch some of her toys and plays with her on the rug, giving Sherlock the time to finish his current experiment in calm.
And even that, I feel, is inadequate. SH
“She clearly doesn’t understand how inaccurate it all is.”
Sherlock gives him a hungry look, “Good.”
“This is a more practical time to be ringing,” John says, a little out of breath but not uncheerfully, and Sherlock can tell he’s in a good mood. He’s probably been playing with Rosie. Sherlock can picture it now: John good-naturedly yelling, “I’m gonna catch you,” while Rosie squeals and runs down the corridor. Sherlock has seen them play that little game many times before.
“Yes, and last night, too…” he trails off, and if it were possible for a pocket of speech to contain a wink, his would right then.
“Where?” Mycroft sighs, relenting as Sherlock knew he would.
Uh, hi Sherlock. It’s John. Obviously. Right. Anyway, just wondering if we have eggs at the flat or if I need to buy a couple. Making breakfast for Sarah in the morning. If we don’t have eggs, call me. If we do, call me. Just. Call me.
You’ve grown tremendously over the years and I don’t think I flatter myself for stating the part I’ve played in it. I just don’t think I should continue to overstate it and, in so doing, overstay my welcome.
“Yeah?” he can’t help but breathe out.
“John?”
“I didn’t know what was happening.” Still holding his gaze, lips moving against his skin, Sherlock hasn’t stopped shaking yet. “I had deduced countless strangers, read their stories and forgot it all immediately, but you... I wanted to impress you, hoped to somehow make sure you wouldn’t be able to forget me. And it wasn’t logical. I shouldn’t have cared, shouldn’t have bothered to estimate the exact distance to put between us, standing in that lab, so that I would be the only person you could look at. So that all the rest would fade from your attention.”
A brief flash of something else crowds over the image, though: John, sweaty, naked, back arched, sheets tousled, someone beneath him. He shakes his head harshly to physically remove the picture somehow.
What if I can’t be everything you need? SH
“Yes.”
“Boyfriends, then?”
Six weeks and two days after Sherlock sees John, Lestrade rings with a case.
That it could be that easy only makes the prolonged years behind them seem to stretch further and further in the only direction there is - away.
To the afterwards. Whatever happens when dinner is finished and the plates have been cleared. He feels nervous suddenly, brief stutters of trembles going through his stomach, but knows it’s going to be okay, because this is John. It’s still his John. And that’s the best part of all.
You turned me into an even more romantic.
he thinks, before shaking the sleep off of himself and jumping out of bed.
Christ, how he misses him. He wants to be home, needs to be home with him right now. What the hell is he still doing in this flat?
The toast pops out of the toaster, as though on cue. Neither of them flinches, both leaning into the confrontation with some heat, allowing the tension to mount. They’re both stubborn men. This could be a while.
John walks the aisles contemplatively, his worn trainers making crunching noises as each step forces the dirt further into the cracks of the linoleum floor. This, that, and this. Beans, always beans. When he adds luxury items such as bubble bath to their cart, Sherlock doesn’t comment.
John rubs his thumb along the palm of Sherlock’s hand and even that small sensation causes electricity to seem to run along his spine. John must sense the shift too, because his pupils widen (just a fraction, but he’s Sherlock Holmes so he notices and files it away for later inspection) and he licks his lips.
“Tell me about your day,” John asks after a few moments.
If you’re not okay or… Just ring me, okay?
“It’s okay, love, it’s okay,” John says reassuringly, letting his fingers trace the scars on his back through his thin sleep shirt. “I’ve got you, love, I’ve got you and I’m not letting you go.”
“Sherlock, I-”
“What is it, love?”
Sherlock turns at that, surprised by how close John is. When did he get that close? “I never said you were pathetic. Did I use the word ‘pathetic’? I can’t recall.”
He looks around the street one last time before pocketing his phone and climbing inside the back of the car.
“Mikkeli. It’s in Finland. There’s more trees than people there.”
“You’re right, of course.” John takes a few breath, looking around as if to find an answer in the crushing waves or the darkness of the sky. “I still consider Baker Street as my home, and it feels as if you don’t. Not anymore.”
“You’re just saying that now because of… You’re just saying it.”
“Yes.”
I don't regret that first kiss to your neck, nor any of the ones which came after that. I don't regret my hands on your hips and my body pressed against yours. We were meant to fit together, Sherlock. Our bodies melted into one another, every time we kissed, every time we took off a piece of clothing, every time you pushed yourself harder against me. You felt amazing, all sharp and soft at the same time, every inch of skin offered to me. The way you moved, the way you moaned, the way you asked for more with just a movement of your hips.
Sherlock’s eyes are cold on him, “You tell me.”
made sure you were sleeping and eating and not blowing the flat up with you inside it.
, Sherlock tried his very hardest to lock John up in that black box. For a month after the wedding, he didn’t contact John (not that John ever attempted to reach out to him first - a very sore point, to this day). He holed himself away, planning and organising and pushing deep, deep down. He should have known from the start that the whole exercise was futile. He’d managed it with Redbeard, but even those demons weren’t truly buried.
, John thinks, getting out of bed and putting on a jumper.
“You’ve seen them both recently, haven’t you?”
“Sure,” she says, gesturing for him to take a seat by the front desk.
“I’m tired of theories, John,” Sherlock sighs. “Especially when it comes to you.”
“Thank you, John.”
“No,” John answers, suddenly turning serious. “Not that. This is for real.”
Two days later, John phones again. Sherlock doesn’t answer. There’s a brief voicemail.
“I can’t - I can’t talk about this right now,” he whimpers, near-hyperventilating.
“Obviously,” Sherlock grumbles, which earns him a fond smile and kiss on his head.
I’m not giving up on you, Sherlock Holmes.
“Now we learn what it is like to be this new us,” John says, not sure what it will bring exactly.
“That can be arranged.”
John strokes his cheeks and plants several more kisses all over his face. “I understand,” he says kindly.
“It was all worth it, then.”
He flees before Mike decides to ask him about the case, or worse, Sherlock again. How can he explain that he has absolutely no idea how Sherlock is doing. That he had lost his place as a best friend a long time ago, and did nothing to win it back. In fact, he only made sure it would stay this way.
Not needing to hear more than that, John closes his own hand around Sherlock’s erection, making him cry out rather loudly. After that, it’s only a matter of a few more firm strokes before they’re both coming with each other’s names on their lips. Sherlock is still staring at him as John comes down from his orgasm, a look of absolute wonder across his face.
“Oh, of course it does. Of course it’s got everything to do with it. You don’t trust me and it’s because, four years ago, I jumped off of a rooftop to save your life.”
you. I feel… This thing between us, it just grows and grows and I almost feel empty without you. Like there’s something missing and only you know what it is.
Bill and his wife are going away, and they say it’s alright if you come.
He’s interrupted by John’s lips and tongue meeting with his and if he didn’t know any better, he would swear that this is a cosmically life-altering moment. He is the earth and John is the sun and he’s rotating around John or John is rotating around him or whatever stupid, pointless thing goes around the other.
“I didn’t mean - What I meant to say is that whatever happens, however it happens, I’m ok with it. As long as I’ve still got you, in one way or another. I’m clearly not in this for a short haul, and I never intend to lose you again. Not ever,” John says softly as he strokes Sherlock’s hand with his index finger. Sherlock huffs out a long sigh he wasn’t aware he’d been holding in.
“Mycroft. Good to see you’re smarmy as ever. I like that about you. Always reliable,” Sherlock retorts.
“Still,” John says, feeling uneasy. “They have every right to resent me for all I’ve done to you.”
“Yes, yes. I do.”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say, so he just nods curtly and stalks off in search of a cab.
Sherlock finds his eyes, laughter dying off slowly. “Oh John, we solved it.”
John tenses up, and Sherlock can hear the unspoken questions in his posture.
I still wonder about most of this.
and then
“Yes, sure, yes,” John replies, clearing his throat as he dares to add, “I could come over.”
“I’ve forgotten it can be this cold,” John sighs, already shivering. “I should have put on my coat.”
What he meant to say was
“Maybe. But think about it, we could be doing this at home, in our bed.”
On his way into the sitting room, he notices a hunched figure sitting in the darkness at the bottom of the mezzanine level. The stench of cigarette fills his lungs as the figure takes a long drag.
“Of us!  Together!  You’re in your snazzy new gear and I’m in mine, and I told you we’d need to send Mycroft a photo.  That’s how we’ll secure those flight upgrades.”
“Well, I like that second row down there.  Bit further away from everyone else, and we can easily nip up here for a swim when we want one.  And if we flip the loungers around, we can look straight out to sea while we read.”
“Not a fan, then, I take it?” Sherlock said with amusement, taking in John’s expression.
“I’m Tim.”
“Oh wow.  He’s good.”
Sherlock ducked back into the bathroom to spit as John exited, smelling minty too.  Sherlock grinned at John – they often did this at home, and it was calming to bring their Baker Street routine into the holiday.  Sherlock stared at himself in the mirror as he put his toothbrush next to John’s in the glass.  He smoothed his hair down a bit – he was amused at the volume the humidity was giving him – and made dramatic eyes at himself as he considered the significant moment ahead.
Sherlock considered this.  “Hmm… no. Though I will acknowledge this has been one of his more useful weekends in recent memory.”
“I won’t ask what those reasons are – I think that’s probably between the two of you – but I’m really happy for you, Sherlock.  Assuming this is what you want, of course.”
“John, I’m going to…”
He came out to find John in bed, under the covers but in a t-shirt like last night.  The room was warmer and Sherlock blushed a little, wondering if John had anything else on. He slowly unbuttoned his shirt, and lay it carefully over the chair before wiggling out of his trousers under John’s intense gaze.  Feeling rather exposed in just his pants, but feeling like putting clothes on was obviously counterproductive, he bit his lip nervously and drifted towards the bed.  Towards John.
____________________________________
John considered this.  Better to be honest with Sherlock about his thoughts, or would even sharing them be too much?
And around the main pool and down the path they went, heading towards the staggering blue of the ocean.  It was a deep blue, azure, not a tropical colour, but John loved it.  He also admired Sherlock’s back as he walked, the swing of his loose shirt and the pleasing outline of his smart straw hat.  Pretty good Sunday!
“I don’t know… I was just wondering that.  I might have forgotten to unpack it from my last trip, but that’s quite unlike me.  I would have noticed when I went to put it on top of the wardrobe.”
The food came delicious and error-free, to John’s delight and Sherlock’s annoyance.  Alessia cleared their plates and they both stared out to sea peacefully.
“So…. Breakfast?” John enquired hopefully.
seats on the plane, and intended to give Mycroft a piece of his mind as soon as they got home.  John had just snorted, rolling his eyes and leaving them to it.  In his book, Mycroft was a bit creepy but broadly a good bloke.
Sherlock breathed out slowly, pulling John’s hands a little tighter.  Steeling himself for honesty.  No point having suffered all these months, missing John, wanting John, only to lose his nerve at the crucial moment.
John gave a shiver, closing his eyes for a moment at the tone of Sherlock’s voice.  It felt all too much, and yet just enough, at the same time.  He stood still and let it wash over him.
“Would you like me to hold you, Miss Rosie?  Even though I have no idea at all what I’m doing?”
“Fuck, this chair’s too small!”  Sherlock complained, breaking off the kiss.
He waited only a second before three grey dots appeared… typing.  Sherlock sighed with impatience.
Sherlock nodded to acknowledge John had spoken, but didn’t take his eyes off Rosie for a second.  Her little hands tapped on his shoes happily, and she started to pull on the laces of his left one.
“But I’m a bit heavy to lay there boneless for long periods of time, you mean?” Sherlock snorted.
John smiled reassuringly at Sherlock.  “Mutual, then.  But I think we’ll work it out.  You wouldn’t have got on the plane otherwise.”
_____________________________________________
“Well, it’s nice to meet you, Tim from Guildford.  I’m John.  Sherlock,” here, John turned and pointed to Sherlock, who had stopped laughing and was watching the interaction with great interest, “and I live in London.  Have you been to Regents Park?  Or the London Zoo?  We live near there.”
“Do you think we can rent a sailboat?” Sherlock mused, staring out at the horizon.  John followed his gaze to see a white-sailed boat moseying along in high contrast against the intense blue of the sea.
Sherlock nodded understandingly.  John rolled his eyes.  As though Sherlock had any idea of the difference between a 6 year old and a 10 year old!  But even as he rolled them, he was a bit chuffed that Sherlock was making an effort.  John wouldn’t have been sure…
Turning back towards John, Sherlock bit his lip for a second, considering, then put both hands on either side of John’s face and bent down to kiss him passionately.  John melted into him, consumed by the kiss and surprised-pleased-embarrassed that they were making fools of themselves in front of this Italian family.  They stayed there for a moment, enjoying the contact, before Sherlock broke off and dashed back to collect his phone from the girl, who now had an enormous smile on her face too.  John chuckled – clearly a bit of romance had been required to cheer her up!
John was unconcerned that Sherlock had already told him this.  If Sherlock wanted to pepper him with facts before he’d had breakfast, that was Sherlock’s prerogative.  He knew John was useless until he’d had a good sit, some tasty carbs, and nursed a coffee.  “Huh, that’s cool.”
The footsteps reached the landing at the top of the stairs and paused a moment.  Sherlock quietly cursed the closed door – it now seemed like a convenient spot for a cherished arrival to have second thoughts.  As quickly as the thought occurred to him, it became irrelevant; the latch released and the door swung open decisively.  With a wild heartbeat, Sherlock couldn’t take it any longer – he opened his eyes.
Sherlock nodded, matching Tim’s wide-eyed earnestness.  He was clearly impressed by this small boy, to John’s amusement.  “So why didn’t you order that way?” he asked sincerely.
“No, Sherlock – I know there’s more to say – and I hope we’ll have more conversations about this and the rest.  I think we owe that much to each other.  But before we go further,” John gestured between them, “I just want to say that we’re ok.  You and me.  We’re ok.  That’s what I came here today to say.”
spending.”
“Sherlock, you don’t need to…”
Sherlock huffed a little but decided to wait and see before developing into a strop.  John smiled, pleased at Sherlock’s self-control.  Sherlock smiled back, pleased to be here, with John, on a beautiful morning.  They both sighed happily and angled their bodies to take in the view.
“You mean it doesn’t usually feel this way?”  Sherlock asked, genuinely.
“Come on, John – after this morning’s performance, nothing going through your head right now can possibly be that big.”
John huffed out a little air through his nose, amused that this man, this brilliant man, who jumped from roof to roof, ran down alleys after criminals, and had gone through god-knows-what in Serbia, was too scared to hold a child in his arms without straps and buckles and Velcro.  Sherlock smiled at this too as his eyes scanned John’s face, acknowledging it probably seemed a bit silly.
John growled in his throat, thrusting a little into Sherlock’s hand as he buried his face in Sherlock’s neck.
John nodded quietly, knowing there would be time for more conversations later.  For now, Sherlock clearly wanted to show off what he’d been working on, and John was happy to let him.
“Perfect timing, then,” said Sherlock with a smile.
There stood John, his familiar outline in the doorway more comforting to Sherlock than any sight in the world.  The shape of his shoulders, the way he stood stiffly, slightly crooked even after all these years without a limp.  And on his front, strapped into her carrier, was a chubbier Rosie than he remembered, facing Sherlock with a small fist waving in the air and bright eyes focused on him.  Sherlock drank them in, overwhelmed by the sight.  He breathed out slowly as relief flooded his body, and just as quickly, wariness set in.  Should he be gearing up for a fist fight, verbal attack, or a cup of tea in their old chairs?
“Made up your mind about what?”
“Yep, she’s reading.  Dad’s taken my sister to get an ice cream.”
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully, thinking it was a fair question.  He’d raised it, after all.
Not waiting for a response, Sherlock switched his phone into aeroplane mode, put it back in his pocket and leant back in his seat with a soft smile, his eyes closed.  Big day.
“No – I tried to talk him out of leaving straight away.  I thought you’d have questions, and that it’d probably be better to discuss what this meant for the two of you.  But he was sure, so I didn’t push it.”
With a mischievous smile, Sherlock reached over and took the bear from John, neatly flipping him over and lifting up his jacket to expose his bacskside.  John chuckled – it was a bit undignified for the bear, after all.  Sherlock clearly saw where John’s mind was at, and smirked back at him, as though accusing John of being the immature one.  As he did, Sherlock’s long, nimble fingers pulled out a small green plastic wheel from a hidden pocket in the bear’s back.  He flicked a little switch with the edge of his fingernail, and then poked the green wheel back into place.  Once that was sorted, he pulled the bear’s jacket down and turned him over again, holding him out so he faced Rosie.  He wiggled the bear’s limbs so he did a little dance for her, earning a giggle, and then he lightly pressed his thumb to the bear’s tummy, and familiar piano melodies rang out into the still flat.
“Yes – it was time for a refresh.  The old stuff had been here for ages before you and I first moved in.  It’s actually the same pattern, but I got new stuff.  I can’t believe anyone still makes it, but I liked it.  No bullet holes, no blood stains, but same old busy Victorian pattern.  Same-same-but-different, as the kids say.”
__________________________________________
Lestrade watched Sherlock closely, with his head cocked slightly to one side.  “Was it really?  I guess, I’m pretty surprised that you didn’t know that already.”
Sherlock snorted behind John, who shot him a glare and turned back to Tim. “How about we move into the shallower water and throw the ball?  It’s a bit hard here where it’s deeper.”
“I’m sorry, John.  I really am.  I never meant to hurt you, either time, and if I could go back and change those things I would.  It means the world to me that you’re here in our kitchen.  That you came home, even just for a visit.  I thought you might never come, and I was trying to make my peace with that.  Trying to tell myself that that’s what I deserved.  But… I never gave up.  And I’m not sure that I ever would have.”
Around 6, Sherlock gently woke John with a light hand on his calf.  John blinked, a bit confused about where he was, to see Sherlock sitting at the end of the bed by his feet.  He said softly, “John – it’s 6pm.  I thought you might like to go out for dinner?  Totally fine if you want to keep sleeping.” John shook his head a bit to clear it, then groaned a little.
“Tim!  Time to get out!”  A tall man with freckled shoulders and foppish auburn hair eventually called out from the edge of the pool.  Tim turned, grinning up at this fellow, who was clearly his dad.  John gave a friendly wave in the father’s direction, and saw Sherlock do the same.  “Why don’t you thank these nice gentlemen for playing with you, and we’ll head up to get some lunch?”
Closing his eyes seemed easier than acknowledging the hope he felt, the rush of adrenalin, the craving.
John floated on his back for a while, feeling light and happy and enjoying the sensation of being buoyed by the water.  It’d been a long time since he’d spent as relaxed a morning as this, and he was struggling to remember his last actual holiday.  Certainly he’d had leave while he’d been in the Army, but he’d mostly used that to potter around London seeing friends and, when duty called, family.
“You know… it’s a newlywed custom.  First time into the house, and all that.  Pretty sure the Romans started it.”
“So, you’re going on a holiday.  One week or less.  Somewhere warmer than here.  Can’t be more than a few hours away as you clearly plan to arrive at your destination today wearing that outfit.  You have your passport, so it’s not in the UK.  You’re flying, not taking the train, or you would just have relied on your e-ticket on your phone.  Silly, because most airlines are fine with an e-ticket now too, but you’re conservative that way.  It’s August, and you’re pretty poor, so it’ll have to be somewhere the budget airlines have a direct flight.  You haven’t told me about it… not sure why yet, but I’m sure you will in a minute.  Though actually now I think about it maybe you’re clutching a paper ticket because you know I read your emails, and you wanted to keep this a secret.  You’re going alone, because I’m not going and you would never risk a holiday with Harry.”
