the Omega hadn't come as an attempt to avoid him, he wasn't sure what he should do. Yes, he was more than willing to be persistent with Dean and push a little more than he normally would, but he also didn't want his advances to cause the Omega any inconvenience, especially when it came to his job, and the last thing he wanted was for the Omega to feel the wrong sort of uncomfortable around him.
Walking slowly until he was inches away from his son, John stared him down and Dean could pretend all he wanted, but John saw the panic lurking there behind his wide, glassy green eyes, and he didn't like that look one bit. It reminded him of just how fucking fragile the boy was and if there was one thing he despised, it was weakness, especially coming from his own flesh and blood.
And if things went his way, they would be creating a whole lot more memories together, ones even better than this.
There was a strange calmness that always settled over him when he was alone like this, just him and the endless world ahead of him, and it was times like this when he thought that maybe, if he got to see this again, his life could be worth living.
Dean sat there in silence, not knowing what to say when she finally finishes, Jo shrugging her shoulders and giving him a self-deprecating smile, like she never quite meant to say so much or for it to sound as preachy as it came out, which was understandable since Dean knows it could sound vaguely insulting and judgemental if she said it to just any random person. Although, this fact doesn't cause her to back down from what she said either, something Dean could appreciate. Strangely enough, it was one of the most riveting things the Omega had heard in a long while, because deep inside, no matter what bullshit he told Jo (that was probably one of the reasons she said what she did, since she had the uncanny ability to know when he was lying, or he was just
At that moment Dean didn't feel very much like the older brother he was. He watched Sammy collect his things, waiting and praying for him to ask that one question he desperately wanted to hear at that point. Because he knew, without a doubt, that if Sam had asked him to go with, to get away from this hell they'd been living their entire lives, he would have been right there with Sam, packing his own things and getting the heck out of dodge as fast as possible. Because no matter how much he tried pushing his own life to the side, the Omega had had dreams of his own, ones that he could never hope to fulfil if John Winchester had anything to say about it.
Finally taking out what looks like a picnic basket from the boot of his car, Cas comes to join Dean and laces the fingers of his free hand with his as he leans in to peck him on the cheek, “Just, trust me okay?”,
He feels that gentle hand on his arm once again, and with a slight tug the older Alpha has the Omega facing her as cool blue eyes takes hold of his own green ones, “I don’t know much about you Dean, that’s true, but I do know Castiel and I can tell you this, don’t ever doubt that you’re exactly what he needs,” Hannah says, one of her hands coming up to brush her fingers gently through his hair, cupping his face, the Omega’s heart stuttering when he feels the phantom touch of when Mary’s fingers had used to brush through his hair every night as she put him to bed.
had an edge of possessive protectiveness to it that had been rearing up all damned day. Now bubbling and smoking at the pit of his stomach when he thinks about Dean saying those words and thinking about someone as he said them.
Standing on his tip toes, not realizing he was using Cas to balance himself so he could look over Sam’s shoulder, Dean saw a group of familiar faces gathered in a semi-circle around one table, some hooting and hollering in an attempt to probably psych out the person getting ready to bowl.
“They're sending one of their best writers down here, name's Casteel? or something like that. He'll be following you around for a while, maybe a few weeks or so, see what your life's like behind the scenes or some fancy shit like that.”
Dean cries out at the unexpected intrusion, lips separating from Castiel’s as he pants, body pushing down to get his Alpha deeper, deeper, deeper into his body.
At that Sam surprisingly hears Dean's own soft voice respond dubiously a moment later, “That doesn't mean he likes me ya know. Maybe he's just not an asshole and more of a decent human being than the rest of 'em reporters are.”
It takes a little longer than he would have liked to get to where he needed to be, stopping once or twice to ask for directions from some random students, the Omega thankful that nobody had recognised him so far. Not that he was stopped often by strangers on the street, but it only ever took one person before he had others soon following, even when he could tell some never even knew who he was.
But all this was no excuse, he knew, and the last thing he should be doing was taking his frustrations out on not only someone who he hoped would be more open to the idea of speaking to him in a different, more professional setting, but someone who was probably the first person that he could remember who didn't seem to pick up on or be put off by his seeming indifference as the singer willingly started a conversation with him. Either Dean Winchester was even more oblivious to social cues than he was, or he was someone more interesting than Castiel first thought.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Hey, Dean!” The Alpha hears over the low-level buzz of the bar before somebody completely knocks him out of the way only to have said person completely assault his Omega in a bear-crushing hug.
meeting boy, show some respect for the work I do, you ungrateful brat,” John fires back, not liking Dean's tone one bit.
But Dean isn't complaining, because the Alpha was right, he can already feel the cool air hitting his skin through his clothing, not realizing that he had scooted closer into the Alpha's body to stay warm. He takes the blanket off the Alpha's hands, a silent thanks to his thoughtfulness as Dean lays it out over both of them and the Omega can't help but let out a contented sigh, already feeling his body heating up.
Turning to see who it was, and wanting to let them know that the seat was already taken, he's brought face to face with someone who he would have preferred avoiding tonight.
a task this business is, maybe you could speak with him on how better to keep track and stay on top of everything if you're forgetting to schedule meetings. No harm in needing some advice after all.”
They were each sitting on opposite sides of the black leather back seat of the limo they were driving in as they headed back to the hotel they were staying in for the week. The singer felt drained and bone tired, rubbing at his temple, already feeling the mounting stress and anxiety pounding against his skull, feelings he thought must be his natural, resting state at this point since they never were far behind in rearing their assault on his body.
But Dean says nothing, his thoughts already taking him away to a place Sam couldn’t  reach, and the assistant sighs a little in defeat, smirk fading as he does so,  but before he can completely let the topic go he can’t seem to help but add on, “Think he likes you too by the way. The way he looks at you, like you're not just another story to him, like you're an actual person. It’s not something you can fake, not like that anyway. You should maybe give him a chance if it comes rolling your way, he could be good for you.”
The clothes he is wearing didn't help much either, if he could even call them that. The Omega was covered in nothing but long strips of emerald coloured cloth that flowed loosely around his legs, interspersed with strings of multi-coloured beads, with broad strips of fabric criss-crossing around his torso and up his neck to form a single polar-neck styled collar by his throat, with a thick silver arm band wrapped around his left upper arm. Although Dean could admit he was impressed with how they transformed such simple pieces of material into something that looked so elaborate on his body, he was not enjoying himself some hours later, being wrapped up and dragged down by the sopping wet mass now coiled all around him.
“Don’t fret, Castiel has mentioned you too, quite a bit might I add, we’re all quite excited to meet you, the others will surely throw mighty tantrums when I tell them I had the pleasure of meeting you first,” the Alpha says, making Dean blush even brighter at that.
“Shit,” is all Castiel manages to get out, body still moving inside the wetness of his Omega as he realizes his knot had been growing, something that only ever was supposed to happen during an Alpha’s rut.
They draw away soon after, but before they can get back to their silence, Dean can’t help but ask, “So, what was your prom then like Alpha?”
Castiel is clearly not the only one inspecting the other as her brown eyes seem to size him up in contemplation as well. The Alpha isn't sure why she's doing it, but the critical look from the other Alpha has his own Alpha brain kicking in, making him stand up straighter, head tipping up slightly to let her know he's not intimidated in the least as he stares at her just as intently with his blue eyes focused on her brown ones, neither backing down for the other.
But he also knew that Cas wasn't the only reason, that maybe an even bigger part had a lot to do with how he just wasn't happy doing all of this anymore, the discontent with constantly being paraded around, even as he came to appreciate some of the artistry in some of what he did, having built up slowly over the years. It had only been trampled and relegated to the side by Cas 's sudden presence in his life, not that Dean could complain about that though, since the Alpha had been a much needed balm to his wounded soul and filled up his life in ways he couldn't seem to fathom just yet. The only thing the Omega knew to be true at that moment being that Cas was someone special and vital in his life right now, and maybe would be for a long time still.
The Omega had wondered about the use of that particular nickname, Gabriel being the only one he ever heard use it, but the thought had soon been forgotten as she provided him with when and where he should be when he finally got back.
And maybe Dean was thinking too much into it, but the next kiss feels different than the previous ones they shared, it was as if the Alpha was sealing a promise right there on his lips with the mind-melting and toe-curling sensations the kiss illicits.
When Dean feels the hardness of Castiel at his entrance, the Omega can’t help as his body forces him to shift below the Alpha, turning around, drawing his knees up and out as he presses his face to the carpeted flow.

of the younger man, and he knew the singer could feel his own very obvious arousal too. It wasn’t enough to get him beyond half-mast, but fuck, the build-up was just as sweet.
who caused the singer so much pleasure that he couldn’t help himself as he soiled the sheets below him.
“You honestly think he'll even want to talk to me after that, as you called it, downright disaster of an introduction?”
The unbidden thought seems to stumble out in his head, so fleetingly, so unexpected that Castiel can't help the way his face contorts into a scowl, not so much aimed at Dean rather than at himself. But looking at how Dean turns his head slightly, eyes peeking down the hallway as if he were contemplating whether he should make his escape now rather than suffer through Castiel's gruff and grumpy attitude, Castiel knows Dean must have taken his presence as being very much an unwelcome one by the writer.
Soon enough, Castiel is fucking Dean’s mouth at a relentless pace, the Omega whining loudly as the musk and flavour of his Alpha overwhelms him, tongue licking along the veiny member to get more of that taste inside of him, his hole clenching, waiting, longing to be filled just as his mouth is, slick starting to slide between his cheeks. His own mating drive wanting his Alpha’s scent all over him,
In a distant sort of way, Castiel knew he was being rude and a complete jerk the moment the words were out of his mouth, but it was too late to filter them out first. And it didn't help matters when he saw out of the corner of his eye how Dean started to bite his lip, a pinched expression forming on his face as he turned his body away from the writer, from where only moments ago it had subconsciously drifted until Dean was facing him more fully.
Surprised at the random question, Dean shifts his head and looks up at Cas with raised eyebrows. He wasn't used to this whole sleeping with strangers situation, well, almost strangers in their case, but he knew enough to know that small-talk wasn't usually part of the deal. But at the same time, he can't deny the fact that he wasn't and isn't ready to go home quite yet, he felt warm and sleepy and
“Jo said you get them often, the migraines, why is that?” Cas asks once Dean finishes with the lunch, not bothering to hide his curiosity from the Omega.
him to hear this, to understand, “In all my life, that was probably my biggest regret. That I let her down; becoming exactly what she told everyone, all the teachers, and social workers and her friends and family, I wasn’t. That if they just gave me a chance, they’d see in me what she saw. That I broke her heart and probably hurt the chances of some other kid getting the help and support she would’ve given.”
Before Castiel can answer, they both turn towards the sound of someone clearing their throat accompanied by a “Hey Cas,” from the opposite side of where Castiel had been looking to see if he could spot his Omega.
But suddenly he feels a sharp tug in his hair and when he looks up, he sees those crystal blue eyes blazing with fury,
“No, no, nothing's wrong. Just wanted to see if maybe you'd wanna meet up some time? Haven't seen you in a few, is all.”
Sam had tried to bring it up after he came back from the hospital, John having never allowed any visitors to see him during the brief period he was still forced to stay there. Coming home though, Dean had felt so fucking numb, so empty, so
But Sam being Sam, he can’t leave it there just yet, and in a softer voice he says, “It's his birthday today,” at Dean's raised brow, silently questioning how Sam even knew that fucking fact, the assistant just huffs out a laugh, “You did ask me to find everything I could on the guy you know. Anyway, maybe he just wanted a day off. And hey, that shirt and access card you requested should've gotten to your room by now, perfect time to gift it wouldn't you say? And it’s team building tonight, he’d fit right in.”
But eventually, the Omega’s eyes had started to droop, and he forced his body up off the floor to instead curl himself underneath the thick, weighted blankets of his bed, phone still firmly held to his ear.
It's ten minutes later, around eight-thirty pm already, when Dean finds himself, fist poised in preparation to knock on Cas's room door, a vague echo of when he stood here the last time he had showed up uninvited to the writer's hotel room.
“No offence, Charlie, but this isn't exactly helping and frankly, I don't care about any of that. I don't care about his job or apparent celebrity status or who said what about him, I just want
With that mantra in his head, Dean opened the door, being completely done with all this mating bullshit, his heart always seemed to get a royal beating for all his efforts,
“What do you mean by that? I am in fact capable of casual sex.” Although he didn't tack on that Cas was the first person he had ever had this type of relationship with, since he had never been interested in the whole one-night-stand affair before. But he wasn't so sure Cas could even fall into that category since one night had turned into two had turned into four.
at Cas’s office, the Omega blushing now slightly at how desperate he was for the Alpha, though Cas had seemed just as eager, a fact which eased his embarrassment somewhat.
It was moments like this when Castiel simultaneously remembered and forgot who Dean Winchester really was.
The conversation they shared a few days ago was in fact their first ever interaction with each other, and if Dean was being honest it was decidedly
As I have it planned out, this fic is divided into three parts, and the first pretty much ended with that lil' date.
“What do you want Dean?” Castiel prompted, shifting his head as he leaned down to cover Dean’s lips, slowly moving his own against the singer’s, his tongue following not long after to dip inside and get another taste of him, biting softly at the over-sensitive flesh before he broke the kiss.
Castiel retrained himself from moving even a muscle as he gave Dean the time he needed to adjust, a feat when each breath Dean took caused his hole to twitch and tighten around his already rock hard cock.
There was a long stretch of silence then, Gabriel eyeing his brother as a thought started taking hold of him, “I’ve never seen you behave like this,” before he allowed Castiel to give the whole bullshit ‘
But the night wasn’t over yet. He could still make this a good day for Cas, just like he planned on before all this.
deep down, that somehow they were supposed to be together, from the moment the Alpha laid eyes on his Omega, that was it, he was lost and consumed by something much bigger than himself and it was by time he stopped fighting the Alpha side of him like he had gotten so used to doing over the years, an irony for him since for years he has strived to help young students in his classes the importance of their biological make-up and how it was okay to express their natural inclinations. After all, it was that part that brought him closer to the Omega in the first place, clearly his instincts knew what he should be doing better than he did. He just hoped and prayed that they wouldn't fail him now that he needed them the most.
Looking back down the hall he spots nothing of note, and he can feel the slight tilt as his brow furrows in confusion.
For the first time, Dean saw the awkward, adorable personality of the man stripped away. In that moment he looked like an Alpha ready to throw down some punches, and not expecting to lose if it came down to it. He had an intense, raging look in his eye that Dean found equal parts terrifying as well as hot as hell, making a warm flush spread throughout his body.
But his Alpha, his voice filling Dean up, the words, the promises, the devotion as he held onto Dean tips him over the edge as his singing continues.
He had to be more cautious, he doubted Dean had told John about what he and Castiel were actually speaking about when they were together, what their true objective was. And he had a feeling that if he let anything about Dean's plans slip, John would make sure to get Dean away from him. And the writer felt an instinctive fear, that if that happened, he wouldn't be able to get back to him before John made him change his mind about the whole thing completely, about
Not moving from his position, the singer shifts his head so his piercing green eyes are staring at Castiel, that
But then he looks over at Dean with the biggest smirk stretching across his face, and the singer takes back everything her ever said and knew about the big moose as Sam, as he opens his big mouth, “My my, is
The pair finally make it to what seems to be their location after about a fifteen minutes' walk. The path leading down into a sloped area, with short walls that straddles the slope, which have vibrant green bushes and flowers in varying shades and colours planted on the higher ground, highlighted by the soft, warm glow of the ground lights placed amongst the brush.
Not gonna lie, that paint scene was somewhat inspired by this one foreign movie I watched a few years ago, and I thought it was just perfect for these two.
Dean had somehow crept past his sharp edges, maybe even didn't mind being pricked by some of his pointed spikes, not letting that stop him from having Castiel right where he needed him, where he seemed to
, Dean thought as his mind blanked for just a second, a pulse rushing through him, but managing to stop himself from climbing the man like a tree. But just barely.
But it was something else Cas had completely wrecked without even knowing he had, because he couldn’t completely deny the fact that the simple act of talking to Cas, having somebody who was really listening to him, with no judgement, no expectations from either of them, no weight of worrying about being a burden, it soothed something deep inside himself.
But his attention quickly shifts to Castiel though and he leans down to Garth as he whispers in a not so whispery voice, “Doth my eyes deceive me or is Dean really here with a date
Dean thinks, stumbles into him, causing the Omega to lose his balance as well. But before he can embarrass himself by crashing to the floor, hands grab a hold of his upper arm and steadies him as he's gently pulled against a warm chest. Dean's about to thank whoever it is that helped him, and extricate himself from said body to continue his search for Cas when he looks up and finds those familiar blue eyes staring down at him and the Omega smiles, because
Deep down he hoped to all gods that would hear that Castiel wouldn’t have to go through life as yet another rejected Alpha, bodies living, but souls dying.
when it's so important to us? My mom always told me to think of them like a blank sheet of paper and when you have sex with someone you rip off pieces of it to give to them, whether meaning to or not. So imagine if you keep tearing and ripping and giving pieces to people that you don't care about past just a night of release, what you'll be left with when you do finally find a really great person who deserved everything, and all you had of yourself to give to them is this torn, broken little piece of paper, because that’s all you left of yourself by the end of all that fun. I used to think she was insane and being really old-fashioned, maybe just wanting to scare me into not having sex with boys, but as I got older and the more I thought about it the more the idea didn't seem so crazy anymore, ya know?”
And good Lord, Dean only added fuel to the flame when he gives Castiel this huge, toothy smile when he notes the obvious astonished look Castiel no doubt has on his face as the Omega leans in and gives him a soft, lingering peck on the cheek.
With that he slips his hand in Cas’s open palms, the Alpha’s strong fingers wrapping tightly around his as he leads Dean to the centre of the room, their eyes never drifting, green staring into blue, as if some magnetic force kept their eyes locked onto each other.
Either way, he was not about to have a conversation with the man in front of him in only the scrappy material of his boxers as he goes to grab a discarded white under-shirt, feeling a little too vulnerable and open to scrutiny from those green eyes, even as they remain fixed to a spot on the wall from where he has perched himself on one of the two chairs next to the lone desk in the room.
Seemed Castiel’s body was on board with that thought as he skated his hands down to the tops of the singer’s thighs, spreading and lifting them up that much more, encouraging Dean to wrap them around his shoulders instead of his hips.
He hadn't known what to expect when Dean had pulled him onto the crowded dance floor, but once the Omega moved his arms around his waist, Castiel couldn't control himself from bringing that plush body closer to his, his Alpha side still very much at the forefront of his actions and it wanted to feel the Omega's body pressed up right against his. Preferably skin-to-skin, but just feeling his body heat seemed to satisfy his instincts and with the weight of the Omega's arms around his neck, his body pressed tightly against him and the Alpha's hands spread across his back where he could feel the soft give of his flesh, Castiel never thought it could get any better.
Soon enough though, Cas and he are ready to leave, saying their short goodbyes to Garth, Ash and Ellen as they make their way out, the place becoming even more packed as the usual Saturday night crowd starts to meander into the place.
From one moment to the next Dean finds himself curled up, knees bent in with his arms wrapped around them, head bowed so no water can get in his eyes, sitting there all shaky and overworked on the bath-tub floor as the heat of the water coming out of the shower spray beats down on him.
No matter how hard he tries to even out his breathing, Dean can't seem to stop his heart from racing as he makes his way off the stage once the song ends, moving towards his Alpha.
She smiles at him and pats his hand before moving off and Dean knows that she knows she managed to win this round in persuading him to do what they both knew he wanted to do.
And continued still when he wasn't getting so much as an understanding, sympathetic nod from the writer who just sat there, watching and waiting for that one thing he knew would be coming. The piece he needed to pin down who John Winchester was.
what was wrong with him? He was just glad he had decided to wear blockers that day so the scent of his budding arousal wouldn't be present. Thank the universe for small favours, that was for sure.
himself before then, having used them since he was a teen. And the uncomfortable nagging thought that maybe he was hiding from who he truly was stuck with him and would spring up every time he swallowed down the tiny white pill in the morning.
, quite slacking off, I don't pay to have you two stand around all day!” She directs the last part to Garth and Ash, who are standing to the side and they both jump up when Ellen reprimands them.
Dean was grateful when he noticed that nobody else was there at this hour, so he had the place to himself for a little while it seemed.
But deep down Dean knew that it was more than their situation, it was also a simple matter that it was
All in all, read fics for the pleasure of it and not to start debacles, take what we put out there with a grain of salt and as inspiration to perhaps start writing your own stories, it's exactly why I started writing myself.

was what he really wanted to say, but he thought maybe, after one kiss (well, several kisses actually) it was too soon to voice that little bit of information. He didn’t even know if he was okay with that fact just yet, all things considered, but liking Cas could be enough.
Dean and he eventually find themselves sitting in a booth and Castiel can't help but remark, “Well, that was...interesting.”
Those concentrated hormonal glands were physiologically unique to Omega's, and were one of their primary second gender characteristics that signified them as Omegas. But the sentiment to have everybody know that Cas was decidedly taken still stood, an Omega's possessiveness was about on par with that of Alpha's, and it was understandable for somebody in Dean's position to react the way he did, so Castiel wasn't put off in the least with his Omega's fierce behaviour.
Dean can practically hear the sarcasm and patronizing tone in Michael’s voice, both of them being fully aware that Dean wouldn’t be able to answer that question without making a fool of himself. Again.
“We are. Oh, did I fail to mention it wasn't going to be at the actual cinema?” With the smug expression on the Alpha's face, he's enjoying his time goading the Omega, having made no mistake in not mentioning that little tid-bit to the Omega.
He had immediately booked it then, his booted feet racing to some place quiet where he could just hide and pretend as if he wouldn't eventually be forced to go up there no matter how he felt or how his body and mind protested the very idea. Dean knew he couldn't hide forever, and he was proved right once somebody started knocking rather loudly and incessantly on the closed, single stalled bathroom door he had tucked and locked himself away in.
And with Dean staring back at him, so much understanding and not a trace of judgement in those mossy green eyes as he let the writer hold his hand in his, anchoring him and supporting him, Castiel started to wonder whether she would’ve understood his actions too. Whether he should expend his efforts on finding
“You’re the first person to ask you know,” Cas said, looking at Dean as if he both confused and amazed the writer all at once.
Back when Dean was still on the rise, Sam had been the only person Dean had taken a personal interest in hiring when his dad had told him that if he never saw to getting a personal assistant he would be choosing one for his son. He hadn't been much involved with his crew selection, even back when he was still an excited and impressionable newbie in the industry, being too young for that sort of thing, but at almost twenty he knew he was damn well going to be front and centre when it came to choosing somebody who would basically be in his more private space twenty-four seven.
The Omega lets out a long-suffering sigh when he looks over to see the time displayed on the clock sitting on the table in the front entrance way, noting that it was already eleven thirty, well past the time he was due to get back. His shoot had gone on for much longer than it was supposed to, at least this time due to a scheduling mishap in the estimated running time, one delay after the other causing Dean's fitting and photo session to be pushed further back.
Instead of wearing his usual work attire consisting of his dress pants, shirt and tie with his ever-present coat, Castiel had stopped by his house to change into some worn-out jeans and a simple long sleeve Henley before making his way over here. He and Dean had planned on painting one of the spare rooms in the Omega's apartment since he finally got the all-clear from the landlord stipulating that he could practically do anything he wanted, so long as he paid a levy with his rent that month so the man could re-paint it to its original colour if Dean ever decided to move out.
Slowly processing what the Alpha just said, Dean scrunches his eyebrows and asks, “‘Someone like me’?”
Dean nods his head firmly at that, “Of course, I mean I think I'm always pretty fucking adorable, don't you?”
With that he pushes himself up with a groan, his one hand immediately going up to rub his head, glad to note the gruelling pain he was experiencing the night before is gone, along with that sick dizzy feeling he had. Looking around he's surprised to find that he wasn't looking at the familiar white-washed walls of his own bedroom, but the warm grey tones of Cas's.
He could never manage to pretend as if they were the world's gift from god when he interviewed them in person, while at the same time slandering their names and character in his writing when he poured out his exact thoughts about them, things he wouldn't say face-to-face. Castiel had absolutely no filter, it didn't matter if he was speaking to a regular Joe or the fucking pope, he still tended to say exactly what he was thinking.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean said, voice muffled by the material of Cas’s coat as he kept his head on the man’s chest, not wanting to move away just yet.
This was not how he imagined the night going. He never thought beyond just trying to find Dean once he saw the masses of people waiting at the entrance of the club. Luckily for him, Gabe had pulled through with an all access pass, but that hadn't been much help when he got in and saw that the place was packed all the same.
He doesn't wait long, the door opening almost immediately, as if the Omega had been waiting close-by the entire time. The thought puts a smile on the Alpha's lips, but the expression fades to one of awe when he gets his first look at Dean.
Dean stands there, watching the Alpha as he slouches back on the seat as it rests on the floor, the blanket preventing the damp feel of the grass from seeping into the material of the chair,
Castiel decides not to comment on that and to just take her word for it as she goes back into the dressing room, and instead he focuses his attention back on Dean. It's the first time the Alpha takes note of what he's wearing. It wasn't anything outrageous, and from what he can tell it was most probably his own clothes. Concern laces the Alpha's expression once more when he feels how thin the material of the cropped sweater the Omega's wearing, the cold from the tiles having probably already creeped into his skin by now, since the Alpha can feel the cold seeping through his own dress pants.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“But the truth is, my son is quite a troubled young man, you see. Not doing so good up there ya'know,” he says as he gestures to his own head and Castiel gets the picture, “but when duty calls, I'm proud to know I raised a son who knows where his priorities lie. His mother was the same, God rest her soul. But she didn't have the same drive like Dean does. Boy just wants to make his old man proud and I do what I can to help along the way, do the things his mother wouldn't let me do for her. All this about having wanted a husband and not a manager an' all, which might I add I completely respected.”
Before he can think better of his choice, Dean picks up the phone, fingers shaking with nerves as he dials his brother's number, teeth biting into his lip when the phone starts to ring.
It's then that Castiel finally realizes what Dean is wearing and the Omega notices this when the Alpha gives him a not so subtle once over. He points his finger in the Alpha's direction when the man finally looks up at him questioningly, humour evident in his clear blue eyes, “Don't even think about it,” Dean warns him, “your brother's made enough jokes about food today as it stands. I'm actually surprised the rest of the models haven't mauled him in the parking lot by now.”
“I already told you, Jo. It’s not like that with me and Cas. We’re just having a little fun, that’s all.”
But it all came rushing back as Cas stretched his arm, holding his hand out for Dean to take, as he asked, “Would you like to come inside Dean?”
Still, that was probably too much for Dean to hear right then, not with the tail spin of thoughts he was going down, and all Sam ends up saying is, “Maybe, maybe not. Would still wish him a happy birthday if I were you though, just sayin'.”
“It’s not my fault your friends are pompous asses and can’t seem to take a joke, which is what that was by the way, I told you that already.” Dean responds in his defence.
But now they were quiet, soaking in the simple act of being close again as Dean’s addled, sleepy body drifted into a light doze, Cas’s hand drifting slowly through his hair, nails scraping along his scalp and the pads of his fingers trailing along the shell of his ear doing nothing to help his current cat-like behaviour.
And it clicks for him then, how Cas could be comforted by her presence, an older Alpha he could look up to and trust to be strong enough for the young Alpha to lean on and to receive advice when he needed the type of support not even Gabriel could provide, what no other person but an Alpha could give him. To show him a better version of himself and his designation other than the one his mother had crafted out of her own twisted need for control and freedom.
Being caught off guard was one thing Dean hated the most, especially when he tried his best to keep himself guarded from the prying eyes of millions of people, which he wasn't always successful at, people could be relentless when it came to things that made money, and it just so happened that his private life was one of those things up for grabs.
He never knew where the impulse to do this came from, only that he had a vague, barely there memory that maybe him and his mom had always sat and watched the sunrise together when he was little, but like most things that had to do with Mary, it was such a far-gone memory (if it was even a memory itself), that he couldn't be sure it wasn't his own mind supplying him with the cold, empty comfort the thought of it brought him.
it would, everything was coming out all wrong, and he could see Cas wasn't overly thrilled with the idea, not that he had any reason to be really. Dean was just another client to him in the grand scheme of things, and he certainly didn't owe the singer any favours. But Dean had a feeling that he wouldn't be able to do this with anybody else but Cas, there was something about the writer's sharp edges that put him at ease, as strange as that sounded. Cas was as straightforward and as unapologetic about it as they came, and he desperately needed somebody who wouldn't feel sorry for him and who wouldn't go selling the secret parts of himself to the first highest tabloid bidder. He wasn't offering Cas a scoop here, he was giving him all the broken parts of his soul, hoping he'd know what to do with all the scraggly pieces once they were through.
“Hey, don't look at me like that, we got some serious work to do here Alpha,” Dean says, clicking his fingers in front of Castiel to get his attention. Seemed he wasn't keeping as tight a reign on his arousal as he thought then.
The words were inclusive enough, but the subtle shaming and pointed stare made it obvious who the words were meant for. And everybody knew it as they stared daggers at Dean's turned back.
Cas smiles back at him, a hint of bashfulness on his face as he says, “You're welcome Dean, I'll uh, just leave it to you then.”
Sighing, Castiel looks over at Dean, staring at him openly, unashamedly, and as he's about to look away, he sees a flash of understanding flicker in his eyes, asking the question, but already knowing the answer. It's the first time he thinks that maybe, just maybe, they could be more similar than what he expected they could be. And he can tell that Dean knows that too.
His hips stuttered in their rhythm, and he knew he was dangerously close to the edge, “Wanted to feel my come inside you sweetheart? Feel me fill up this tight ass of yours?” Castiel questioned, words filthy and crude. But it was all it took before Dean let out a long, drawn-out whine as his body stilled, ass tightening around Castiel’s cock, forcing the writer to stop his own hips lest he hurt the man, coming untouched as his release spluttered on the sheets below him.
Dean looks away from Michael and blinks a few times, trying to get the stinging out of  his eyes at the renewed sense of mortification he had felt when those words had slipped out of his mouth.
, it was a hungry and needy and demanding kind of love, an all-consuming and out of control emotion that they both had fallen so freely and willingly into. And they had to decide whether it was worth saving or whether they had to let it go after they had no more secrets to tell.
never wanted me to be. It's not gonna be this way forever, I know,” he says before Bobby can intercede him with the same words he's been hearing since he knocked on the Beta's door two years ago, “but when I'm ready to face him, I'll find him, I promise...just... not now, okay?” Sam whispers this last part, as he looks imploringly up at the Beta, begging him not to push him on this to which Bobby finally concedes to this plea with a nod.
He found out that Dean's absolute favourite food in the world was greasy hole-in-the-wall diner burgers and home made apple pie, this he discovered when he went on a half hour rant about a new diet he was put on to prep for an upcoming beach shoot he had (with images popping in the Alpha's head that he resolutely ignored, since it would more likely lead to round number three) and that out of all the aspects of modelling, the strict diets and watching what he ate was the worst part for him.
“I was stupid and thought people wouldn't care who I dated, turns out I was wrong, really fucking wrong.”
There was about thirty more minutes before the show is scheduled to end and Castiel couldn't count the minutes fast enough.
The name has the Omega furrowing his brow in concentration, knowing he’s heard it before, and then, not a minute later it’s as if a light bulb went on as Dean finally understands how Gabriel had known someone from Cas’s work.
Dean can't help the blood from rushing to his cheeks in a combination of embarrassment, mixed with mild frustration at the Beta. Dean can admit that the Beta definitely outsmarted him in their whole bantering relationship they somehow picked up instead of behaving like normal human beings in front of each other, not that he'd admit his defeat to the Beta though. He'd get him back, eventually.
Hours had probably gone by, people had said ‘hi’ only here and there to the singer, but for the most part they were so desensitized to his existence since they saw him on nearly a daily basis that nobody really bothered them all that much, as far as Dean could tell, they were here to have their own fun. But the night was winding down, and they had pretty much played almost every single game the arcade had to offer.
There's a pause after that, and while Dean goes all shy and embarrassed that he had mentioned to the Alpha, who was pretty much the fantasy of all his wet dreams, that he was close to his heat, Castiel's eyes narrows slightly at the choice of Dean's words (
Maybe it was because he just couldn't care less about most people's feelings, couldn't find it in himself to be more considerate, that coldness creeping in until every aspect of himself was covered with its freezing tendrils, making him seem emotionless,
He also knows his pheromones were going haywire at the moment, his sweet apple scent permeating the air as his instincts interpreted Hannah’s sorrow as an Alpha in distress, and Dean can’t do a damn thing to stop this visceral Omegan reaction, hoping the Alpha wouldn’t mind since Dean didn’t think he could let go, not with how worked up the Omega inside him was, blurting out a muffled “Sorry, it’s…I can’t help it.”
And there was too much. Too much adoration and longing and passion and fucking love Dean could feel growing until he was consumed by it all. He can’t bare the silence as the song ends, and drawing his body up, standing just slightly on his bare toes, he whispers his own soft, sweet words to his Alpha.
Cas seems to need a minute to respond, and Dean can see his hands fidgeting around the steering wheel, the Omega finding the nervous gesture endearing to say the least. It still amazes him how easily Cas could go from the cool, in control and domineering Alpha, to the adorable, nervous, socially-awkward Alpha in no time at all.
“Here you go,” The Alpha says as she presents him with a steaming cup of what was no doubt some type of green tea instead of the coffee or better yet hot chocolate he craves to have at that moment, but the tea was steaming hot around his freezing hands and if he was honest after taking a sip of the warm liquid it didn't taste as bad as he thought it would, noting the hint of cinnamon and sugar Jo must have added.
But that was something Dean could manage, it was such a staple part of his job, that showing off a little more skin than he usually would wasn't something too alarming. But the overbearing presence of the Beta when he was around was a nightmare, his whispered words of displeasure at how badly his shots came out, how group photos never looked quite right with him in them, only served to extend his working hours with having to redo all of them, even the group ones (much to the disgruntles from the rest of the models) made his job that much harder.
Raising one dark, thick eyebrow at Dean’s once again out of the blue request, the writer looks on in pure scepticism, not trusting the playful look adorning his perfect face one bit,  “Oh, and where, pray tell, am I agreeing to go with you?”
“Ha-ha. Very funny, asshole. You're the worst, ya'know.” Dean grumbles, and walks with Gabriel as he moves on over to get his station ready for the shoot.
“What do we have here, eh? Dean Winchester dressed all fancy-like, ooh and he's brought an Alpha with him too! Can't wait until Ash sees this! I'm Garth by the way, and you are?”
And this time, it was the writer who pulled away, taking a notable step back, brow furrowing at his own forwardness while Dean stood there, staring back at the older man, suddenly comprehending the amount of hurt he inflicted on the writer only hours before as he felt the same strong stab of rejection in his core.
“Yes, although, I fail to see how that is relevant at all to my problem,” Castiel says as he watches her type and swipe furiously on her cell phone.
me, boy, I haven't heard a single thing from you in over a month except from what my daughter's told me, and here are, just waltzing on in and you have the nerve to just
Simple really, but it was enough. That was the first thing, and after the comfort of that feeling, so foreign and new, Dean’s heart, embarrassingly easy, followed along.
The positive reaction to his words excited Castiel so much he couldn’t stop the shift of his own hips as he thrust them down, much harder than he had before. This time though, instead of rubbing against Dean’s own jean-clad erection, he found himself grinding a bit lower, his point being very much obviously made with the motion of his clothed cock grinding sharply against the singer’s ass.
Hands burning, aching from its sudden assault, he pressed them flat against the unmarked wooden surface, bowing his head, trying to get the thoughts, the fucking
Either way, Dean was determined to answer the question, and as truthfully as he could. Problem was he hadn't thought about Lisa in a while now, and it was hard trying to step into a version of himself he barely remembers being, but he had to try, “It's hard to explain. In all honesty, I don't even remember her all that well, just maybe the way she made me feel, I guess. How flustered I'd get whenever I saw her down the hall, how warm and light-hearted and happy she always was. She just had this calm, positive ball of energy all the damned time. And I-I was exactly the opposite of all of that, and it just felt good...being close to her, like a lowly moth drawn to a flame.”
And with that Dean slams the door, not waiting for a reply (not that he thought there was going to be one anyway) and as he walks up to his apartment building, he hears the tires of the Alpha's car screech before he even makes it to the entrance of the building, Michael obviously not having given a second thought to the Omega as he pulls his arms tight around his body, head bent down as he finally allows the tears to fall down at yet another failed attempt at finding someone who actually cared about him.
“You're not happy now?” Castiel couldn't help to ask, but he knew it was the wrong question, the wrong time to ask it when he saw Dean's face fall, lips quirked into a grimace.
“Anyway, I wanted to help out where I could 'coz my younger brother, Sam, he had these big dreams of going off to study law at some fancy college, and kid being the freakin' genius he was, I knew he could get into any one of them, but that shit ain't cheap even with financial aid."
“Hey! Castiel, over here!” Castiel hears Charlie's distinct voice as he looks around the semi-crowded bar from his position at the entrance, spotting her, Balthazar, Crowley and Hannah sitting at side seats by the window. Seems as if he were the last to arrive then, since this was pretty much his usual crowd of friends.
He was happy that he was in a stable enough position in his career where he didn't quite have to put himself out there to that extent, but it hadn't always been like that.
“Yeah, I know, I was pretty stupid, you can guess what happened next. I gave him what he wanted and that was it. I prob’ly should’a tried for at least a motel, but we did it in his car on some dirt road, guess that’s at least different from the cliché,” the Omega says self-consciously, looking away as those dormant but never forgotten feelings of humiliation burns through him.
“I think I've let you carry on with this bullshit long enough, what the fuck is wrong with you? How dare you run off and lock yourself up in the fucking bathroom like a damn pussy, do you know how crazy the press are going on right now? Fucking stories everywhere 'bout how unprofessional you are, making people wait over forty minutes, before you decide to get your sorry ass on that stage. Half of 'em are even speculatin' that you'd been doped up and drunk off your ass during the entire fucking  concert! ”
To be fair, the suit did have a better feel and fit than his regular ones, not that he would tell Balthazar that, he would never hear the end of it if he did and he was afraid his friend would go so far as to throw out his entire wardrobe if he knew he could get away with it now that Castiel conceded to the superiority of tailor-made clothes. He knew Balthazar wasn't beneath doing something exactly as crazy as that.
Rolling his eyes, Gabriel makes a sweeping motion in Castiel's direction and says, “Yes, this is my brother, Castiel. I'm surprised you remember him Dean-o.”
That was what Dean was feeling right now; responsibility for Cas, wanting to make sure nothing bad had happened to him and that he was okay. It was a terrifying thing, this bond that had grown between them, being made less malleable and breakable with every day that went by.
"They claimed we were monsters who tried to rule over everything and everyone, mistaking our need to protect for wanting to control and our urge to bind our mates to us for wanting ownership of our partners. As it turns out, my mother was leader of one of the main branches of the anti-Alpha organisations, so you could imagine her shock  when she gave birth to the very thing she hated so much." Castiel had to pause there to get the dark pool of disappointment he felt since he was a child, under control. Castiel had always thought it foolish that people believed all parents were the ones who were supposed to love their children no matter what, he was living proof that that just wasn't true for everybody.
Right now, he was excited to play some games, he was happy to be here with someone whose company he enjoyed. And tonight, they could simply be Dean and Cas, not anybody or anything else.
He looked over to Michael, knowing the confusion he was feeling was showing all over his face, but being unable to control the expression.
It made the other two dancers doing the performance with him grumble slightly in irritation at the singer when he wasn't taking note, even as Castiel saw them giving Dean encouraging smiles when he tried to apologise for doing such a bad job today.
In a fit of panic, wishing he had never made the call in the first place and just wanting it to be done, Dean presses the
could even love anyone else either. But here he was, the man beside him having set something alight in him, something so soft and gentle and fond and so utterly beautiful that he couldn’t believe it was his own body, his own soul that could conjure up emotions to feel this way, that he, out of the billions of people in this world deserved and was trusted so much to hold and protect something so vulnerable and precious.
Castiel jolts as he's woken up by an incessant knocking sound on his dingy, single hotel room door. Being only a tag along on this tour definitely had its demerits since the journalist was relegated to occupying the sub-par rooms of the hotels they had settled at thus far. But it was only the early stages of said tour, so he remained hopeful that his living arrangements could go nowhere but up from here on out.
The Omega has a moment to send up a silent thanks to the woman who Gabriel said could help him for giving him directions when he mentioned he wanted to see Cas, saying it was a surprise of sorts.
Gabriel had agreed with his assessment and it started a whole tirade of ideas being passed back and forth amongst them all. As the conversation wore on (and the alcohol started flowing more freely) the ideas they traded became more outrageous and eventually Castiel gave up when Balthazar had suggested he take Dean to a damned sex club of all places, earning an unwarranted amount of sniggers from the group and causing Balthazar to snort so loudly that beer had come out his nose.
Usually he would walk Dean to his front door or they would stay cuddled up a lot longer than they did tonight, but he doesn’t want to give the Omega any more opportunities to protest further or find a suitable reason as to why Castiel couldn’t go.
Sam had probably been the least qualified candidate back then, no older than he was even though his application papers had stated otherwise, which once Dean had found out were obviously fakes, should've been a major red flag as to why the boy was the absolute wrong choice. But Dean had found the whole situation slightly amusing, his intrigue to meet whoever it was that came up with this not so well thought-out plan the only thing that got Sam pushed through to the interview portion of the process in the first place.
Before the Omega can make his way back to the stairs, however, Cas's voice suddenly rings out once more, “Oh, and Dean, is next Saturday, eight o' clock alright with you? I'd rather cash in on our date sooner rather than later so you won't have much time to change your mind.”
As if to prove his point, the man with the slicked back blonde hair who had been eyeing Dean all evening, making him feel as if thousands of bugs were crawling all over his skin, and who slithered in and out of the circle of people John had been moving through, gave a decisive head nodding signal towards the staircase as he caught John's attention.
Dean wouldn’t know where to put Castiel on the traditional 1-10 scale of hotness. He lived on a different scale entirely.
Suddenly, Dean snapped back into reality. He unclasped his hands and moved them from his lap to above the table. He quickly picked up his silverware and started to spike pasta with his fork. “I’m eating dinner, Sammy.”
The group eventually made their way through saying farewells and Rowena left, leaving Dean and Castiel alone. Dean was tense. It was hard for him to think of Castiel’s body as just an empty husk to be filled.
Castiel thought for a moment. “If you’re willing to try, you may be able to create an illusion of something for me to distract myself with.”
“I am passively aware of the sensory input you receive,” Castiel said, lowering his eyes. “But I am able to focus my attention elsewhere when you require privacy.”
“I’ve already said yes, no need to keep selling,” Dean said, then hesitated. “So long as I get to stay behind the wheel.”
Sam slid his laptop to the side so that he could look at Dean directly. “I’ve been doing some reading about angel vessels. There isn’t much out there, but we know that angels leave behind a trace of grace in the vessels they occupy.”
Dean stumbled as he walked down the hallway. He was in the kitchen for just long enough to grab bread, peanut butter, and jelly by the time Sam entered the room.
“This is fine, Cas.” Dean huffed out a laugh, still coming down from an adrenaline high from the hunt. “This is just fine.”
Sam rolled his eyes and shifted his focus to Castiel. “I tried calling Cas, but it went straight to voicemail.”
Sam was caught off guard for a second before he put the pieces together in his mind. This would take some getting used to.
Dean tensed in his seat and checked his surroundings a few times to comfort himself. He was in the Impala with Sam.
Dean stepped aside so that Sam could enter the room. Sam flicked the lightswitch a few times but the room stayed dark. He looked at Dean accusingly.
was Castiel, more so than anything related to Jimmy Novak’s body. Dean’s adrenaline spiked as the tendril began to close the distance between them. It meandered through the air of Castiel’s bedroom like lazy cascading waves on a shoreline. Dean’s mouth opened and he tilted his chin towards the smoke without being aware he was doing so.
“Look at me. I get it.” Dean quirked his lips humorlessly into a smirk. “I’ve been a hunter my whole life, I know what possession is.” He paused and sighed, tearing his eyes from the road to look at Castiel, speaking clearly. “I trust you. I’m saying yes.”
His own voice answered him. “If Sam were to walk in right now, he would see you talking to yourself.” Dean’s eyes flicked back up to the mirror. His reflection’s voice was grittier than normal, as if he ate a bowl of gravel for breakfast. “But you are not hallucinating. This is one way I can communicate with you.”
Dean dropped his hands and looked at Castiel. “The wall, Cas.” He looked over at Sam pleadingly. Sam chuckled.
“Aren’t you the one who gets on me about texting and driving?” Dean smirked at Sam. “Just being a safe driver. ‘Sides, you could have used Cas’ phone. We got him one for a reason.”
Dean shook his head slightly. “No big deal. Anything else I should know about beside this whole” —he waved his hand half-heartedly at the mirror— “Mulan thing?”
It was as if he had a whole new sense awakened in him. How could you explain sight to someone who was born blind? He felt his thoughts being pushed to the side to make space in his head for another entity. His body went blank for a moment before he scrambled to gain control. The feeling, which had to be Castiel, let him gather it up from the corners of his awareness. His limbs were left feeling like they fell asleep. He compressed Castiel to right at the base of his neck, behind his collarbones. He felt raw energy thrumming in the back of his mind.
“Dean, Cas was just telling me about what happened,” Sam said. He looked back over to Castiel. “Sorry, I’d offer to help, but I have a… history with angels using me as a vessel.” He gave an awkward half-smile.
He heard a muffled, “Let me know how it goes!” from through the door and continued down the hall. Dean was vaguely grateful that Sam didn’t want to be in the room for it, but he didn’t care to examine why.
“Well,” Rowena paused as she thought. She pursed her lips, choosing her words carefully. “It was a homemade spell designed to erase an angel’s grace. It starts slow, which must be why you can’t feel it yet. It will continue to get faster and faster as time goes on.”
“Gee, thanks.” Dean rubbed his hand over his face. It hadn’t felt like a dream. Castiel must have done his forehead-touch thing to send him back to the land of the living. “Remind me to stop crashing after hunts. I get the weirdest dreams.”
The Alpha moves and retrieves the colourful quilted blanket she knew Castiel kept in one of the drawers of his desk specifically for those late nights, and she frowns at how often they had been these past few weeks as he and Crowley were gearing up for a fight in court.
And then the older man was biting down against his skin at the same time as he drove four of his fingers up into him, both fingers and mouth hard and vicious in their intentions of taking Dean apart.
Dean knew better than to think this was a purely social call on their part, there were always ulterior motives on the agenda as to when John randomly dragged him to these events, especially when Dean's schedule was so full. It was just the two of them there, three hours already having gone by with nothing of significance transpiring in the conversations during the times he bothered to tune back into, but Dean knew better.
“Hey! Yeah, that’s me, it’s nice to meet ya, sorry I didn’t catch ya name when we spoke on the phone,” the Omega says, as he shakes her hand.
Dean gave out a sigh of his own, his soul already exhausted from the prospect of going down that rabbit hole. He just wanted to hear his Alpha’s voice tonight, wanted to be soothed and comforted and told sweet nothings to.
He had scowled and attempted to rebut their suggestions and worry, but deep down he knew he couldn’t avoid his home altogether. Lately, though, it had felt desolate and empty; Dean’s scent that had started to permeate the air having faded the longer the Omega was gone, day by day, his scent going duller and less poignant. And the night it had truly faded from his home, had been an experience he hoped he would never have to endure again.
Dean shakes his head, “Fucked, we were fucked. We were a coupla' fourteen year olds pretending we could handle it, fuck what everybody else thought. Just wanting to hold on to what we had, be open about it, like everybody else could. It just made it worse in the end. We were too innocent, too naïve to have ever thought things could work out. Thought it wouldn't matter if people knew about her, and I guess I wanted to prove that I wasn't ashamed to be with her, but people online can be cruel and they pulled out all the stops, and it just felt too big in the end.
“Your mom not winning any mother of the year awards I take it?” Dean joked, wanting to approach this subject a little more gently and with a little more tact than he would any other topic of conversation.
Losing the battle, and just letting Cas carry it if he really wanted to that badly, Dean says instead, “This place is really somethin' else Cas.”
Grabbing one of many spare tooth brushes Dean knew Cas kept under the sink, Dean brushes his teeth, and gurgles some mouth wash before he feels clean enough to leave the bathroom and seek out the Alpha.
It was new though, these emotions, not thinking about whether there was something he had done wrong, if he was becoming a nuisance, a bother that Cas wanted out of. But Dean’s paranoia for once shifted outward, and grew until the singer couldn’t ignore the fact that he was worried
Giving out a long suffering sigh, “Okay, I guess I’ll see you on Friday. Bye, Cas.” the Omega says, with no small amount of defeat in his tone at whatever Cas is up to.
“Really? I thought you would have liked this better.” Cas says, brow furrowed in apparent confusion this time. The Alpha did that a lot.
“What do you want, my Omega?” Cas says, breaking the kiss to do some scenting of his own as he laps at the beads of sweat along the Omega's own scent glands, trying to cover them in the Alpha's more potent pheromones, with the Omega unable to focus on anything but tilting his head to the side in a sign of submission, allowing the Alpha more access and on the warm feel and gentle pressure of the hand gripping the strands of his hair at the base of his neck and the one that is making its way underneath his t-shirt, thumb brushing against his nipple, making the Omega arch his back so the tip presses more firmly against the rapidly hardening nub.
With that, Cas leaves the room and Dean gets up and heads to the bathroom, picking up the change of clothes on his way.
“You sure you don’t want to stop by your place first? Maybe get some actual rest, I know you couldn’t calm down enough on the plane,” Jo says as they stand shoulder to shoulder, waiting by baggage claim, both looking out for their luggage and trying to not lose their place right at the front as the people around them try to push and prod their way to get to their own suitcases.
he thinks, now wide awake at knowing it's Dean's voice speaking at the other end of the line. It's enough of a shock to get the Alpha shooting up in bed, the old springs creaking at his abrupt movement, with Sam unconsciously pressing the phone closer to his ear, as if that alone could satiate the hammering of his heart as it twists painfully at the soft, soothing tenure of his brother's voice, which had always been a source of comfort to the young Alpha, a voice he hadn't heard long enough to have almost forgotten what it sounded like.
Now though, as he sat on the plush crème carpet at the foot of the giant King bed, looking out through the giant window across from him where he had the most beautiful view before him, the bright lights of Paris sparkling like little fireflies watching over the city, and far in the distance, peeking out atop the buildings, the Omega spotting the top half of the Eiffel Tower, all he feels is this bone crushing loneliness.
Castiel thought, knowing at this point, with his thoughts veering so far to the edge of ruin, that he should take Crowley’s earlier advice when the Beta had left his office some hours ago now and try and get some fucking sleep.
Although his brain hasn't quite caught up to what he was seeing, his body is quick to react as he immediately kneels down beside the Omega, carelessly throwing his coat and the bouquet of flowers he had bought to the side as he slowly and carefully arranges Dean's body so his head rests against the Alpha's chest.
“Okay, I think we got all we need for today. Great job, Dean!” the photographer, Brad Dean thought his name was, shouts out from where he's a safe distance away from the water.
The Alpha isn't far behind, the feeling of Dean's muscles tightening around him causing him to fly over the edge, but before he can pull himself out of the warm, wet heat like he plans to do, he feels Dean's body clamp down around him once more as the Omega turns is head, and with hooded, begging eyes whispers, “Inside, please Cas, need you inside me.”
us to go out? On a date that is.” Cas finally manages to get out from his spot on the bed, where he propped himself up on one elbow.
“Fucking hell, you’re so big, Cas,” Dean said in a breathy voice as his hand stroked along the writer’s cock, his forefinger and thumb barely circling the wide girth of him. He never thought himself to be much of a size queen, but in that minute he wanted Cas inside of him more than he ever did. He wanted the man stretching him out, pounding him, and making him take every single inch.
Afterwards, they lie under the covers, legs tangled together while Dean has his head pillowed on Cas's chest, hands swirling patterns there as the Alpha methodically cards his fingers through his slightly damp strands and around his ear. The Omega had been resistant to this type of intimacy at the beginning when he realised just how much he liked it and never wanted to get too used to the gentle caresses, but Cas had proved to be a rather persuasive and tactile person in his own way, so Dean eventually let up.
The Alpha also came to the sudden realization that what they had now wasn't enough for him, he couldn't stand to have the Omega like this, knowing that at the end of the day, he never really even had him to begin with.
It wasn't exactly what she asked him since she just mentioned the Alpha taking Dean home, but the words seem to calm Jo's own Alpha side's protective streak for the Omega, lessening the guilt she feels at having to leave him alone like this even if Cas was willing to take him home.
Dean looks up at him with wide, stunned green eyes, one leg still out of the jeans he was in the middle of putting back on. Looking down he begins to shake his head, and starts dressing much more frantically than he was before. Cas was offering him something he desperately wanted, but when faced with the possibility of them having something other than
And there they sat together in silence afterwards, side by side, but seemingly worlds apart, both watching the sun finally crest over the mountain, up, up into the now cloudless blue sky until the view became nothing but another day and they became Castiel Novak,
“Calm down, he's okay, well relatively so. He's just not feeling too good is all,” Jo explains as she turns to him, hand held on the door, before she shakes her head, “it's better if you just see him for yourself.”
He tells them all of this, and when he finally looks up from where he was staring intently at the little bubbles in his glass of beer as he relays the story, he is met with mixed expressions of sympathy, concentration as they absorbed the information and probably coming up with responses but also notes of glee and happiness, no doubt at the prospect that Castiel actually set his sights on someone. He could admit, it had been a while since he had been interested in anyone, and he definitely had never been drawn in by someone like he was with Dean.
But even though he wants to dive in deeper, being caught off guard at getting an answer he wasn't expecting, he at least has the sense to know that was as far as that thread of discussion should go, at least for tonight.
to see him first Jo. I already called Gabriel, he gave me the number of one of the people working in Cas’s department and she gave me his schedule, he apparently doesn’t leave until late these days, she says he’s working on some big project, I’m not really sure. But either way he’ll be at campus and there’s no way I can wait any longer.”
John hadn't even spared either of them a look as he had turned around and headed for the door, his words, “If you hate being here so much, then why don't you just go, seems you'd be happier living it up there with those fancy fucks than you would with your own family,” the last thing he said before he had left, the echo of the door slamming shut filling the dense silence that fell in the room.
want to leave the warm nest of the Alpha's bed), and clearly Cas was just as stuck on what to say as he was.
Dean hadn't for a moment expected John to deliver the resounding backhanded slap to his cheek that he did, and it surprised him so much so that it actually took him a minute to process the burning, stinging sensation radiating from the side of his face up to just under his eye.
He put the drinks down on the table, hard, and shifting his eyes to the Beta, who was still crowding the Omega in the tiny space, he asks Dean, “Is there a problem here?”
Opening his eyes and pulling away in surprise, but not before he sees the satisfied smile on Cas's face, Dean nods his head, replying, “Yeah, 'm fine, Cas.”
The sight had left the Omega feeling devastated as a crushing pressure threatened to twist his heart to bits. In that moment, as he felt the aching constriction in his chest, the Omega finally realized what true heartbreak must’ve felt like.
's that seems to clog up at the back of his throat, a lump forming there that he can't seem to swallow down as he shuts his eyes tight, feeling his breathing become erratic in a way that's definitely not normal.
“Me and a few of the girls are having a little get-together after this,” the woman carries on as she leans down, getting closer to the elusive Alpha as she whispers in her best suggestive tone, “you should join us, might find something you like.”
, this was some Alpha male bullshit going on right here if ever saw it, but like fucking hell would he be the first to crack regardless.
And it could be what they needed to help Dean eventually open up to him once he got a little more practice with expressing himself in a way that wasn't influenced by the no doubt copious amounts of media training he had went through since he was a teenager. The rehearsed phrases and responses he kept throwing out, which Castiel had heard in a few of the singers interviews when doing his own research on the man, proved that much as they cropped up even though he could see Dean had been trying.
“We should…we should probably get going then,” Dean says as he wraps his arms around himself, his eyes finally tracking up to look at the writer from under his eyelashes.
“Woah, there, might want to slow down, we've got all night, darling.” Balthazar says when Castiel plonks  the now-half empty glass on the table-top. Balthazar, along with Hannah, were the only two who were professors in the same faculty as Castiel himself, but he knew Blathazar the longest out of all of them, going on almost six years now, since they started out their post-grad studies together. He was ever the life of the party and somehow managed to drag Castiel along with him on all his 'fun' adventures. Between him and Gabriel, Castiel was surprised he hadn't gotten in any serious trouble by now, and he dreaded the plans they could conjure up whenever they got together.
She, along with a few of her friends, had had their eyes on this particular Alpha  for a while now, but the man never seemed to pick up on any of their hints, the lot of them  thinking this made him an interesting enough target to actually form a running bet to see who could bed the Alpha first. And this Omega was never one to run away from a challenge, especially when the prize was as good-looking as the blue-eyed Alpha in front of her.
They were at the end of said trail though, so thank God there was no hiking involved on this date for Dean.
Dean didn't think he would last long in this industry, even though he hoped to hell he was wrong since the kid had obvious talent when he wasn't under so much pressure. But the man had been too fresh-faced, too inexperienced and soft in all the ways he should have been confident and firm, especially for a photographer. It was a ruthless, and take-no-prisoners kinda industry, tearing people down without warrant.
Dean splutters at that, and attempting to correct himself tries to explain, “I-I only meant as in Cas’s friend he’s mentioned before,
Fucking three more weeks, that was all, his final show down here then they'd be off, leaving the US and Dean could finally be free.
twists and wails bitterly inside him as he forces out the words, “You want to tell me more?” at Dean's perplexed expression, Castiel tacks on, “Did something happen between you two that it never worked out? Seems like you loved her very much.”
But seeing Dean automatically bowing his head down slightly in deference as he tries to move just that little further away from John as he presses his body more firmly against the door panel, settles him, that together with the already smug feeling he had before the boy opened his mouth has him not even bothering to reprimand him properly, so instead he continues, “I've been working on brokering a deal with Paul Gavins for the past few months now. He's a big wig producer and is working on an upcoming box office hit. Gave me a call around December, wanting to cast you as one of the leading roles. Some bullshit about music artists bringing in the ticket sales, which has fuck all to do with us, really. The point is, this is your next big break boy, and I managed to have them film around your schedule, which not a lot of managers can pull off might I add.”
“Tell me what you need me to do Dean,” his Alpha spoke out, his own voice sounding suspiciously frail in that moment.
Funny, Castiel didn’t think he had ever seen them before this night. They were splattered all over the bridge of his nose and across his cheeks, like little golden dust flakes, a mark of youth that would forever remain and bloom in the heat of the summer sun.
In a moment of sudden frustration, having reached his boiling point where the Beta was concerned, after weeks of taking his bullshit, Dean turns to him, looking down at the shorter man with all the hatred and condescension and contempt he can muster for the spineless weasel as he explodes, “Look, if you're too stupid and thick headed to take a fucking hint, let me make this as understandable for your obvious pea-sized brain to comprehend. It's. Never. Going. To. Happen. And you'd be delusional if you think I'd ever
Only to dull at Castiel's retraction of it as he layered the words of praise with words that took all his credibility away, “Although, I guess I can't make this judgement since I've read nothing of note to indicate his previous well-being. By the looks of it I'm sure he would've been just fine even without your intervention.”
and he also knew the source of his discomfort lied in the fact that his Omega was almost five thousand miles away from him.
dude was the worst kind of fucking creep if Dean's ever met one, and he's been in the company of a few. He was a big shot designer, and had a lot of sway in the fashion industry. As a result, Dean had ended up modelling for his lines a few times since every modelling agency wanted their models front and center for his shows. It seemed as if the Beta had taken a particular shine to Dean, and since he couldn't understand that; no, not everybody worshipped the ground he walked on, he hadn't taken the fucking hints by the Omega that his advances were most definitely
He rips open the foil packet using his teeth and rolls the rubber over Cas's rather sizeable cock, hands skimming over the hard, hot flesh, giving the Alpha's cock a long, leisurely stroke down the length as he pulls back, the touch making Cas groan out, bowing his head down as he levels Dean with a smoldering stare that sets the Omega's  heart pounding as the blood races through his veins.
Dean's eyes widen in shock at that, it was times like this where the Omega saw how totally out of tune with social etiquette the Alpha was,
If he were honest, Castiel didn't know what to make of Dean. On the one hand he seemed to play the role of happy-go-lucky celebrity better than any other person Castiel had ever written about, his sincerity being so seamless that he wondered if there was really much of a story here to tell. But other times, when Castiel found himself lurking in the areas where it was only Dean and Sam in the same room, he got a peak of someone with rounded shoulders, down-casted eyes, bitten lips and wringing, trembling hands that made for clumsy actions.
It was comforting in a way for the Alpha, to know that  that Dean must have been just as unsure about how this would go and how Castiel would react, albeit clearly for different reasons, but he didn't think telling the Omega he would have found Dean just as beautiful even if he were wearing a paper bag right now to be such a good idea, since that could make it sound as though Castiel didn't appreciate the efforts he obviously put in to his appearance tonight.
Dean was barely fazed when John had soon left him for a second chance at having a new family now his sons were grown, it just seemed inevitable at that point. One good thing that Dean would forever be grateful for about his career was the distraction it offered at the time. Strangely enough, like the universe decided to cut him some slack, when everything else was crashing down around him, his modelling career boomed, and despite the toxicity Dean came to find, it somehow kept him sane, kept him from doing and making bad choices, well any
Moving his mouth down to kiss and nip at Dean's neck, no doubt leaving marks as he bites into the tender skin, Dean cards his fingers through the Alpha's hair, drawing out a grunt of approval that sends shock waves down his spine. The Omega can feel the beginnings of slick starting to leak from his glands, a scent that would no doubt draw attention to the pair, and he knew he had to stop or he'd be having more attention surrounding him, beyond that of the Alpha currently devouring him, but Dean also didn't want the Alpha to stop whatever the hell he was doing.
Dean took back everything he said about even remotely understanding fashion, he looks and feels ridiculous in this outfit right now, and says as much, “I look like an idiot, how the hell am I supposed to look glamorous or what the fuck ever, when I look like a walking, talking breakfast table?!”
He only has a second to whip his head down as forest green eyes collides with ocean blues, before the Omega springs.
Dean knew the ball was firmly in his court now. Cas had already made his decision back in the singer’s hotel room all those hours ago, his gentle caress only making it clearer what his decision was. And now it was his choice to make, this step, whatever happened between them from here on out, it was all up to him. And he needed to make up his mind about what he wanted this between them to be before Cas went through that door alone.
Out of the car, hand on the door, Dean bent down so he was looking at Michael as he says, “I’d rather not be your dirty little secret, thanks. Goodbye, Michael. I hope you find that fucking
chief editor, ever put him on this case, following singers around wasn't exactly his forte after all. The writer could admit that while he excelled at writing detailed, biographical-type articles of his assigned cases, which always got commemorative feedback from readers, he hadn't been able to develop that deceptive aspect that seemed to be a key player in journalistic writing about celebrities.
Nodding his head as best he can with the position he's in at the news, instead of responding, the Alpha turns his body inwards towards the Omega as he dips his head down, capturing his lips with his own.
He might not be the best at interacting with people, but in all those years of staying in the background and going unnoticed, he got surprisingly good at reading people, and he was never as grateful for that particular skill as he is now. Because, despite Dean's words, there was this underlying hopefulness in his tone and an openness to his stance, inviting Castiel in, making what was very much a rejection, which he wasn't going to lie, stung quite a bit, seem more like a challenge to pursue the Omega. It was all the opening Castiel needed to know that it was okay to be a little more pushy than he normally would be in this type of situation.
But Castiel curiously tilts his head at the image of Dean, walking down the halls with his head down, minding his own business and trying his best to simply blend in with the crowd, the image standing in stark contrast to the picture Castiel would have thought of how he was back then and he says as much, “That's quite different to how I would have imagined you to be back in high school.”
And just like that, he was back to kissing him, licking his own tongue into Dean’s mouth, feeling a rumble of possessive pride bubbling in his chest as he chased his own flavour.
Jo had left him around an hour ago to do damage control on something or the other. He had chatted to a few people that he knew who had passed by him, but had declined their offers of going to sit with their groups. He wasn't in the mood to force polite conversation with people he barely knew and who were either well on their way to being completely smashed, or to those who in general just wanted to talk shit about the newest gossip that was making it's way through the mill. Over the years he had found that his tolerance level for these things had outright diminished to zero, and calling people out on not being able to find anything better to do than criticize people and spread rumours had not made him a very popular figure.
“Cas, Cas, fuck, yeah, so good, you feel so good, fuck right there!” Dean choked out, voice high and rough as Castiel zeroed in on his prostate, nailing it with almost every thrust into him, wanting to see him come, wanting to know that it was
“What if he doesn’t want it? I love him Gabriel, I don’t know if I can lose him,” Castiel replies, the rough tenure of his tone smoothed down, his voice sounding as if he were sixteen years old again, seeking out answers to a world he knew nothing about anymore.
The Alpha is quick to go back to setting up, Dean taking a moment to get his ass in gear and help, whether the Alpha wants it or not, as he takes one end of the grey blanket and spreads it out on the ground with Cas straightening it out on the other end.
Castiel had always found it rather strange that Dean lived in what seemed to be just a normal apartment building. It wasn't shabby or run down by any means and was actually located in a decent enough neighbourhood, but he would be daft to think this was all that Dean could afford what with how Charlie had described him as being almost a celebrity of sorts in the modelling industry. He knew the Omega could probably buy his own modest home three times over if he wanted to, and Castiel could proudly admit that his home was rather nice too.
He paused for a moment when his hand made it to Cas’s chest, playing a while with and delighting in the smattering of dark chest hair he could feel there. It contrasted nicely with Dean’s own skin, which was bare of any real hair along with the other parts of his body since it was hard for him to even sport a five o’ clock shadow at times. It odd that whilst he preferred to keep his own skin clean shaven,
Then, fucking finally, he felt the blunt press of Cas’s cock at the entrance of his spasming hole, gently pushing in until the head popped in, causing the writer to grunt whilst Dean’s breath became more laboured and heavy at the unrelenting pressure of Cas swiftly seating himself to the hilt before stilling, only then giving him some time to adjust to the wide girth and length impaling him.
It was around this time that he started to realize this probably wasn't the best way to get some alone time with Dean, having to approach him when he was alone made Castiel nervous enough, having an audience watching his fumbling attempts while he tried to strike up a conversation would just make it worse.
It was this mind-set that really helped him to establish a name for himself in the trade, finding he did his job a whole lot better when he actually started working harder and trying to improve himself with every contract he signed off on. His shift in attitude also opened his eyes so that the Omega realized the industry wasn't just made up of those smarmy, lecherous types that he was prone to stumble into, but also out of real, hard working people, who put their hearts and souls into what they created and loved what they did. Dean didn't think he would ever feel the same as they did about modelling or this whole industry, but he could appreciate their efforts nonetheless.
And Dean's lips form a soft smile of his own as he responds as the Alpha had that night, “Good, definitely a good thing, Cas.”
It was their regular bi-monthly get-together at the same bar that was both close enough to campus to make the commute quick and easy and far enough away that they were unlikely to find any of the college students out here when there were so many other bars much closer and more lively than this one
Hearing Jo's name grabs the Omega's attention and he looks over at the Alpha with a quizzical expression on his face.
There's a notable pause and the rustle of bed springs that ring through the speakers, “Dean? Hey man, is something wrong?” Sam finally says, sounding a bit shocked, which was understandable, he could admit.
He couldn't deny that he had been more than a little surprised at Dean's sudden decision to go out with him, but he was also more than pleased with the outcome of that day, and sorely left wanting when they were interrupted by that phone call. He couldn't remember ever going from zero to sixty in no time at all, his blood boiling for the Omega, who had been spread out so beautifully for him and he knew, if they had had the time to continue, he would have taken Dean right then and there in the open space of his kitchen.
They were so so close, bodies plastered against each other, but with the only light coming in being that from the open curtains of the sliding door, Dean couldn’t make out much of Cas’s features, though he’d been sneaking looks at the man so often it wasn’t hard to picture the expression on Cas’s face right then; that arrogant arch of one dark brow together with that fucking smirk of his, clear indications that he knew he was right, and he knew that Dean knew he was right.
With a soft, dopey smile on his face, Cas replies, “You're welcome, Dean. Who knew giving you flowers was the way to woo you, if I had known I would have presented the biggest bunch I could find when I asked you out, so you couldn't resist,” Dean knows he's joking of course, and being the dork he is, he actually laughs at his own sense of humour
But the Alpha doesn't smile back, which has Dean remembering why he was so nervous when making his way over to him in the first place, and his own smile begins to waver. The Omega's about to say something to lighten the mood, probably along the lines of ridiculing his own cheesy song choice, when suddenly the Alpha is tenderly cupping the Omega's face in his hands and giving him the most breath-taking, mind-melting, weak-in-the-knees type kiss he's ever had.
But Castiel knew better, he knew what actually happened in those places, the conversion therapy research that was done and practiced on the teenage Alphas who were tossed aside in those places by courts and parents, the horrible effects that neutralizing natural instincts and tendencies had on the young Alphas’ bodies if they were unfortunate enough to stay and complete the programmes that were advertised as correctional services.
“Yes, of course!” Dean bursts out, not being able to meet the blue gaze he could feel staring at him, “I just meant that, you never seemed all that interested in any of the models when you tagged along with Gabriel, is all.”
, he reminds himself) had said he should go up to the fourth floor when he came, so the Omega walks through the glass sliding doors of the entrance, making his way to the elevator in the foyer.
He can’t help the broad smile he gives her, knowing his dimples must be popping and everything from how it stretches the muscles in his cheeks, he extends his hand to her, feeling immediately at ease as her freshy cut grass scent washes over him.
There was a lot Castiel could say to Dean up there on that deck, but looking in those green eyes, there was already so much compassion, reassurance and an offering of so much strength and comfort that he knew he didn’t need to say anymore.
With those parting words, John turned around and made his way out the booth. Dean didn't know how long it took him, standing there as he struggled to get his breathing under control, making his lungs work as they should, before he finally made the long walk to his bedroom, where once he got there, he couldn't help but swallow back two more pills as he laid his head on his pillow, just waiting for the dark tendrils of sleep to wash over him and take him away from the nightmare that was his life.
Just as suddenly the singer realized he couldn’t recall his last meal, not beyond the copious amounts of caffeine and energy drinks that had been shoved his way. Sam usually made sure he got some food into his system but with all the planning for the global launch of the tour coming up sooner than anyone anticipated, Dean thought Sam hardly even managed to get some solid food into his own system, let alone having to get Dean to do something as simple as feeding himself.
bed, Dean’s pillow held tightly to his chest as if the Alpha in him could magically draw out the last remaining essence of his Omega, but there was nothing.
After getting their orders in the form of small red baskets filled with a mountain of fries, onions, and their cheese burgers together with their plastic cups of soda, they walked on back to the deserted deck.
Though, in hind sight, he was glad for the unexpected interruption, he knew the importance of that moment would somehow have been tainted by the very thing that had in a sense held the Omega back in the first place.
Not that their very public display stops Dean from becoming an active participant as he goes pliant and soft under Cas's ministration, moaning out encouraging noises for the Alpha so he can continue whatever it is he's doing. But sooner than Dean would like, Cas's lips are drawing away from his, their lips now scant inches away from each other, and Cas brings his forehead down to touch the Omega's, with their eyes closed as they both fight to catch their breathe.
He thought the prospect of discussing other relationships with his current Alpha would have been off putting, a reason to drop the subject, which was why he even said anything at all.
desperate as Castiel fucked him deep and brutal, taking whatever Dean was willing to give, selfish in his pleasure as he plundered in and out of Dean.
Castiel has the vague sense that the threat was said to scare him, but all he can feel at this moment is a sense of kinship and admiration for the other Alpha. It was nice to see that Dean had someone looking out for him, even if moments ago he had had some misgivings about her. But with her words though, Castiel has a feeling they would get on rather well if given the opportunity.
“I know,” Dean replied, and Cas smiled at the simple truth of the words. Because Dean did know, of course he did, he’s been spilling out everything about his own self and life and past to the writer.
“Is that a good or bad thing?” Dean says as he stares right back at the Alpha, hands moving up to tangle in Cas's unruly hair.
“It's pumpkin spice flavour, Gabriel actually made them and brought me much more than I could ever eat by myself...” but the Alpha pauses his excited chatter, the bright expression he had slowly morphing into panic as he takes the Omega's silence the wrong way. In an effort to try and fix things, he reroutes, saying instead, “You know what? Nevermind, you don't have to eat it, I-uhmm, I guess they were a pretty childish idea anyway. Should have brought wine or strawberries and...” Before he can finish his sentence, he's silenced by a kiss, being Dean's turn to soothe the Alpha's nerves, finding the slight awkward lilt to his voice and body language to be both charming as well as wishing he could erase the insecurity at the same time.
Castiel thinks, a mixture of panic and astonishment taking over as he looks up sharply at the other Alpha.
And with those two simple words, hearing Cas’s voice on the other end, so sure and strong and familiar, made something inside him yearn and cry out, “Cas,” the Omega said, trying and failing to hold back the quiver in his own voice as he felt the slight wobbling of his lips.
Licking his lips and looking up at the Alpha through heavy eye lids, Dean moves his hips so that his ass once again brushes against the front of Cas's jeans. If that display wasn't obvious enough for the man, Dean moves his head to the side of Cas's and breaths in a husky voice, thick with desperation and arousal, “Want you inside me, Alpha.”
Dean Winchester?!” Charlie practically squeals out the last part as she apparently found what she was looking for.
“Sorry, I wasn't sure if you were still on that diet of yours or not, thought this was a safe option though,” Cas says as he places his own sandwich on a plate together with a glass of OJ since he probably had his morning coffee, well, during the morning already, unlike Dean who was grateful for the caffeine boost now that he just woke up.
Cas was giving him a funny look at that, “That's not...” He stops mid-sentence as if rethinking what to say as he runs the palm of the hand that wasn't wrapped around Dean across his forehead. It's then that the Omega's flight reflexes kicks in to save them both from the slight awkwardness of this rather baffling conversation (and still being naked and wrapped around each other didn't exactly help on that front no matter how much Dean
A small, irrational part of him is so angry that Dean chose right then to make this call, thinking why the hell he even wanted to speak to Sam after the years of silence between the two. With most of it due to the Omega's calls that had gone ignored even before Sam had made that final step to try and erase his past that one stupid night he was so drunk off his ass he never even gave his decision a second thought when he pressed the
The last part came out dry and almost sheepish sounding, but instead of Castiel being the one to blush at the statement, the writer saw the deep red hue spread on the singer’s proud face as he beamed up at him, his smile infectious as Castiel felt his own lips twitch to the side in a small smile of his own.
Deciding to redirect the conversation away from him, the Omega looks back at Cas and asks, “What about you, though. I think I remember Gabriel saying you were some professor or something?”
The soft knock comes again, the person on the other end definitely not wanting to be ignored. With a groan and a mumbled out, “ 'm coming,” Castiel pushes the blankets off of himself and gets up from the bed, fully intending to rebuff whoever was out there demanding his presence to do so at a more reasonable hour, since looking at his night stand clock he sees that it's fucking two am.
The innocence of the question, the vulnerability of his brother seeking out comfort from the only source he could find, had set something off inside him. What he saw in front of him wasn’t some deranged, power hungry Alpha, it was just a little boy, lip quivering, and eyes bright and lost and scared, mind shaped already by a world that slowly grew to hate him simply because of his designation.
But the Alpha laughs, an almost musical quality to it as she shakes her head at him, her own cool blue eyes staring playfully at him as she says, “Mmm, think that title belongs to you Omega, and I can see why, you’re absolutely delightful,” her tone almost coy as she gives him a once over, with her lips settling into a soft smile once her eyes met his once more.
When he had tried going to their mother, hoping she’d offer some guidance, still holding on to that naivety that she knew everything and would see reason, but she had looked at him then, eyes seeming to burn with hate as she said, “I should never have had an Alpha, they’re all the same Gabriel, not matter who they are, remember that.”
As if Sam could feel where his mind had gone, his laughter dies down slowly, together with Dean's wandering thoughts.
Letting out a satisfied groan, Cas suddenly breaks the kiss and bends slightly down, so he can lift the Omega clean off the ground with hardly a grunt of effort as Dean lets out a very
“Anything for you, my Omega,” Castiel's voice chokes out, too weak at that moment to protest and with one final thrust, he feels his own thicker come draining deep inside the Omega, marking him with his scent where it will stay for days after this.
Let me just reiterate and reassure; THIS HAS A HAPPY ENDING. There's just a lot these boys have to go through to get there and John is a motherfucking bastard that won't let Dean be happy if it means he can't control how and who he decides to be happy with. And Cas has a little more of his own backstory as to why he's the way he is that I'll get into later on.
The feeling makes him curl up on himself, legs coming up as one arm embraces them, whilst Dean tried pressing the phone closer to his ear in a crude imitation of wanting Cas closer in the moment.
“I have something to tell you,” Dean says, breaking the silence as he stares up at the ceiling. It was now or never he supposed.
Castiel didn't know why those words left such a sour taste in his mouth. And this time he couldn't deny that that
Turning to face John, he saw the man seated on the velvet couch set up against one of the exposed brick walls, lounging there in his grey three-piece suit with a lit cigar stuck between his lips like he was a member of the fucking Mafia. Out of the two of them, his dad was definitely more of the showman than he was.
Leaning back on the side of the piano, which was in the booth, not that they really needed it most of the time, Dean's brand was all about following the latest pop tracks that hit the market, but he did like playing it when he was alone. John placed his hands in his pockets, looking as casual as anyone could in the starched suite he was still wearing at this hour, and in a similar fashion as Dean, John got straight to the point as he explained, “I just got off the phone with the editor in chief of
For some reason that pisses the Omega off so he leans up on his elbow and with narrowed eyes looks straight at the Alpha, “Well, fuck those people, nobody has the right to make you feel bad about doing something that you're passionate about, Cas. If it makes you happy, then you shouldn't listen to what others have to say about it. And besides...”
“Well, I lived in a big city when I was growing up, and as a result the home base for some pretty big organisations trying to debunk Alpha's rights, the particular brand of tactics they used were cruel and hateful though, making people believe all these stupid things about us, when in actual fact, they just didn't understand, didn't
Though, that doesn’t stop him from thanking Cas as he raises his own hand to cup his Alpha’s stubbled jaw in his palm, thumb stroking over his cheek and marvelling at how lucky he is as he brings Cas’s face down to his own, gently brushing his mouth against those chapped, dry lips in a short but fierce kiss as he pours his gratitude into the action.
“And you, how would you have pictured me to be?” Castiel challenges, very much interested in Dean's own assessment.
“Last time I checked, someone throwing themselves all over my Alpha is my business,” the Omega shoots back, exposing his neck slightly, with a smirk of satisfaction making its way on his lips when he sees her haughty expression slip as the other Omega spots the red-tinged mark on his neck that's still pretty visible since Cas seemed to enjoy marking him up everytime they were in the same room together.
It was past four in the afternoon when Dean finally arrives at UCLA’s campus, Jo having been dropped off at her own apartment first on the cab ride over, the Alpha having agreed to keep his luggage at her place until he went back and got it so the Omega wouldn’t have to lug around with them when he got here.
Dean flittered in and out of sleep during the night, the constant nerve searing pain that flashed in his head never far behind whenever he did.
Once Dean had heard his brother make that secret confession when John was conked out in their living room, bottle of whisky still in hand, he knew he had to whatever it took to get his brother's grades staying the A average it was, so he took on all the responsibility of keeping up with the chores John expected his boys to do around whatever hole-in-the-wall motel or ram-shack house his dad managed to rent and all his own studies had taken a back seat after that, he knew between the two, Sam would have always been the best bet to make their dad proud and make something of himself using his smarts.
The Omega knew he was getting a little over worked-up and dramatic, but it seemed as if his Omega instincts were right at the surface, controlling this show, and he could barely restrain himself from scent marking the Alpha right there in front of everybody. He was feeling a bit on edge what with his own claim on Cas being threatened like that, well sort-of claim anyway, and scent marking was one of the only physical ways Omega's could claim Alphas since they never had the same heightened instinctual drive to bite and mark up an Alpha's mating gland, not that they had them in the first place.
At this Cas's bright, happy expression returns as relief courses through his body and in an echo of one their first real conversations he repeats the Omega's words, “Is that a good or bad thing?”
He was the first to break eye contact, turning around, opening the door he hadn’t even realized he had been slightly backed into and thinking of the picture they must have made if a complete stranger saw them like this.
The Omega takes his time in the shower, making sure to scrub his skin clean from the grubbiness of having slept for more than twelve hours, before moving on to wash his hair for good measure as well.
But by then he had fucked her over so badly, so cruelly, throwing the love she had so freely given in her face, and as much as he wanted to that night, huddled down and alone in some dirty alleyway, the shame had grown too big for him to ever go back to her.
He comes face to face with a brown-haired Alpha who’s staring straight at him with light blue eyes, the intensity of the look strangely reminding him of Cas.
“I have excellent news Dean,” John says proudly, the satisfied look that he carried out with him after returning from his private business meeting still firmly settled into the contours of his facial muscles and skin. A look that Dean had seen many a time when John had gotten something he wanted. A look that never meant anything good for Dean.
Cas then moves to place the ground chair further up, towards the trunk of the tree, and scoots the picnic basket closer as he then takes a seat.
As the singer made his way out of the bathroom once he was fully dressed, stepping out into his bedroom, he wasn't all that surprised to find Sam already there, looking like a real man on a mission what with the little black Bluetooth piece in his ear and tapping away at his phone, no doubt going through all the places they had to be and people they had to meet.
