Probably not
Your office chair draping
Had a bathroom ghost hovered above them just then, they certainly would have made a bizarre scene. Flush against each other, muscles contracting and quivering, tiny jerks of their hips and then both of them freezing at the exact same moment. The sandy haired man's face in an angry fierce grimace, his eyes squeezed close, a guttural sound of sheer power erupting from his throat. The dark curly haired man's eyes wide open but unseeing, brimming with tears that were already streaming down his flushed cheeks, his face a picture of agony and amazed revelation as he yelled the highest loudest and longest yell that bathroom had ever heard.
Your patients are already spoiled rotten, John!
Sherlock’s answer is just another hum.
He huffed, but John only smiled. He liked this John. This was a smiling John.
“Then give me a smaller target, John.”
John is warm, the jacket having been almost too much already in the sunny evening weather outside, and it’s even warmer here in their living room, but he relents when he recognizes the desperation in Sherlock's eyes. At least his jacket is open, he doesn’t think Sherlock will ask him to zip it up again.
Sherlock whines a little. John wonders if he ever wore two pairs at once and immediately calls himself an idiot. Of course Sherlock has done that. Of course Sherlock knows exactly how they feel. In much more detail than John could ever register.
What the title says. Continuation of the last chapter.
Sherlock had valiantly tried falling asleep in random places and he was constantly yawning when John was making tea. But John never took the bait. Whenever Sherlock was lying around in prettily arranged sleeping poses, John mostly just coughed and shook him awake or sneaked to the kitchen to surreptitiously knock something over very loudly.
John.
“The new wall then.”
“God, John.”
As he reaches to grab the coffee from the middle shelf, John can feel his confidence growing. The double cuffs do move a little weird around his wrists, but then he can hear Sherlock fidgeting in his chair. Any second now...
“It's a large smiley, Sherlock, and you were standing very close. Ouch, what are you doing...?”
“Yes, John, I am. Now, turn around and flaunt your round little target for me to aim at.”
“John John John John John...”
He just smiled at John over the cab roof before ducking into the car.
Perhaps it was a dream after all.
Sherlock’s choppy explanation does not make the situation any clearer for John, and the lecture is cut off by Sherlock’s right hand pulling out of the waistband and sneaking behind John’s rump to cradle his buttock just where his pants are aligned, and now even John can feel the double hem as Sherlock’s hand pushes and kneads against it through his trousers. Sherlock leans his face against his front and is he…? Yes, Sherlock is biting gently at the front of his trousers and John is rock hard just inches from where he is mouthing.
None of it is stationary of course. John's even breaths let the fabrics move gently and evenly. Sometimes John moves a little, tiny adjustments to his posture. Sometimes he takes a larger breath. Mostly the general arrangement of the clothing stays the same, but those brief moments make the game.
He is more concerned with the fact that he is shivering. Why John always fiddles with the thermostat is beyond him. It feels like the temperature's been fluctuating something crazy just today. John really should be home when he does this so he could be properly yelled at, Sherlock thinks, and something about that deduction feels off, but he shakes his head, and more than anything else, he needs a blanket right now. John has his always folded over his chair, and there it is now. He grabs the blanket and smirks. He’s a genius!
“An ice cream stealing gang? Dairy mafia? Really, John!”
“He couldn't have been a particularly ferocious beast if he had a pink nose, Sherlock”, John had pointed out, but Sherlock had been indignant. “Why ever not?” he'd complained, “one's nose colour does not determine how brilliant one is.”
Perhaps I should see a doctor
“John, I didn't know...”
“That I'm in full agreement with. Let's move to the sofa.”
John?
John is hot, more sweat trickling down his spine and gathering moisture in his armpits and his groin, but he sits patiently, keeps his hands relaxed on the arm rests, his legs splayed. Lets Sherlock explore, open him up like the present he is.
. He did not, therefore, see how those especial eyes on their part opened wide and then, slowly, inevitably travelled down, down John's face, down his chest and down again.
God, Sherlock must be able to feel the double hem of John’s pants. He kneads John’s bum, and John arches up to his toes, giving him better access.
You’re killing me
Sherlock lifted his legs onto the coffee table. He might as well be comfortable while he waited for John to doze off.
However
He’d not slept for days in fact, and the cab had been so warm after the cold London night. They’d been lurking in freezing street corners for what felt like eons and had only gotten lucky when the killer had mistakenly approached Sherlock with a lead pipe. It had – not surprisingly – all ended very snappily after that, with the killer on the floor, John brandishing the pipe, and sirens going off in the distance.
“Sherlock, you’ve been asking about pink sparkles and restaurants and frankly weird hobbies and who knows what for weeks now. Of course I knew you were scheming something!”
As they emerge minutes later, they lean their foreheads together, their groins are pressed hard against each other and Sherlock is fingering the double collars of John’s shirts, his other hand grabbing a fist full of the shirts around John’s waist, keeping John close.
He wonders what kinds of clothing related charts and measurements there are in Sherlock’s mind palace – somewhere there in the richly draped ateliers reserved for clothing kink. Is there a new shelf or a drawer being opened for double pants underneath straight trousers right this minute?
“I know”, he said.
“Oh fucking god, Sherlock, gnnnhhh, just, take it slow, aaaahh, or not, fast is good... too... oh fuck, you're so... oh god, Sherlock!”
“No, but I wasn’t sure if you
John glances towards the bed then. He cannot help it. Just a glance, but he sees that Sherlock has lifted himself from his lounging position, is sitting, leaning forward in fact, his mouth slightly open, his head a little cocked. His eyes wild.
John picks his path there and sits down, gingerly, putting his palms on his thighs, waiting for Sherlock. He's a little nervous. It’s not like they haven’t played these sorts of games before, but it’s so blatantly obvious now. Also, he’s the one who instigated it this time, he feels responsible, anxious that things go smoothly, that it will be good for Sherlock. That he not mess up.
“Here, Sherlock, this is something you should solve. They are writing about it for the fourth week now: Ice cream shops closing down. This is already the third one folding it seems”, he chuckled and read from the paper. “’The Icy Carousel was a neighbourhood classic’. Apparently people of Lisson Grove are in mourning now.”
* * *
When John closes the door to 221B on his way to work, Sherlock can close his eyes and imagine he travels with John, close to John's heart, in his private knowledge of what John is wearing innermost that day.
“Why, yours. Why does it matter?” John’s brow furrowed.
Sherlock is already standing behind him though.
“So”, he said, “A successful scheme.”
, he sends and smiles because that one is correct. He bumps his fist in the air in victory.
John knows Sherlock likes the next part, the moment when John pushes the hem of his shirt under his trousers. He feels especially conscious of his movements now; the way the palm of his hand slides first against his shirt and then against his pants while the the top of his hand brushes against the inside of his trousers. The feeling of in between. He wonders if it's that feeling Sherlock imagines as well.
Only after a long while did they pull away from each other, and both of them were panting. John was still a smiling John, though. A dopey smiling John. Sherlock liked that John too. A lot.
Sherlock hummed. It was comfortable: Home. Sofa. John right beside him. He didn’t care that things had not gone exactly as he’d planned.
Buttoning himself up again, he wonders what Sherlock is doing. He cannot hinder his thoughts circling back to the morning, to Sherlock mussed on the bed, the way he’d arched as he’d orgasmed, the interest in his eyes still keen when they said goodbye. John wonders whether the magic will still be there when he gets home.
Sherlock, who obviously was the insensitive intruder, had already stepped in and taken the one long stride needed to reach the top shelf of the cabinet just behind John, where he kept his hair products.
“Well, I did get it right, didn’t I?”
“I was meant to wake you up”, he said, a little put off, but – surprisingly – still completely happy. John was smoothing one hand over his hair now. It felt nice. Like it should be.
John squeezes his wrist, meaning,
“I think the wallpapering has gone to your head...”
Randomly, John found himself thinking he had never before been in a room with two hard penises, at least not naked ones, and he thought how marvellous it was that he could have this experience with the man he had been lusting over for the past six months.
This happens later in the narrative. John and Sherlock are already happily married.
His cock was indeed swelling. Not much but certainly noticeable enough for the hawk eyed detective in front of him. He could practically feel Sherlock's gaze on his cock, scrutinizing, evaluating, gathering evidence. Deducing. God, why did that send his lower belly into such spirals of sheer want.
Sherlock lets his eyes wander all around John's midriff, exploring every crease and fold of his plaid shirt under the sheer brown of the cardigan. In some places the cardigan follows the same wrinkles, the fabrics undulating together side by side, in other places it's stretched over them, hiding a delectable vision of shadows and hills just underneath. Wherever the fabric is pushing tight against the brown of the cardigan, the colours are shining clearly through, in other places the shadows remain dark and inviting.
“You know, the way you are... now, hard and jutting up and leaning over... when you come, you'll be spilling all over the new wallpaper.”
John?
Almost at platform
Back at 221B, Sherlock threw himself onto their sofa and just as he’d planned it, John slumped down beside him.
It was all useless.
“I'm guessing that's a... ye... yes!”
"What?"
The point was, he needed to do something about it now. They could not continue in this state of unease. John had started something, and Sherlock had liked it, and what had happened had changer them both. They could not go back to what they had had before, but neither did they seem able to move forward. They were at an unhappy impasse.
“No it isn't, you berk. And you still managed to hit it just fine so...”
Sherlock’s hands are still there, one fondling John’s balls through the wet pants, the other grabbing his shirt combination hard. Sherlock sucks John unremittingly, hard, suctioning his cock deep inside him and unheeding of saliva pooling in his mouth and trickling all over them. John is gasping and a part of him would like this to last, but the most eager part of him just wants it all now, and Sherlock is determined to give it. He swallows around John’s head and there is an accidental graze of teeth, but John doesn’t care. Sherlock sucks harder and moans around him, and then John is coming, his toes curling, his hand thumping the arms rest, and an unflattering keening coming from his throat.
It took just a second to register for them both. And then. Grabbing, gasping, reckless, fast, reaching, staggering, pushing, tugging, desperate, crushing, tight, so tight against each other that it was painful and uncomfortable and not at all conducive for anything they really wanted, but they both just. Had. To get. Closer.
“What?”
The socks are on, satisfactory, and he reaches back into the pants drawer. He picks a pair again, steps one leg in and then another, slides the pants up and tries keenly to make it seem like they are the first pair. He knows they settle in place a little lower, just so, still showing the top of the pair underneath. He has practised.
John had not simply let him slump against him. John had molded his whole body into the comfortable embrace and held him close. John had sneaked an arm around him, caressed him, made him feel safe.
You need new pants
There was just the one problem left to solve: How to make John fall asleep?
When he’d woken up, he’d still been there, not on the sofa, but at the field, with the sun and the gentle wind and the wheat, and John had sat with him there on the grass by the oak tree, the memory of his hand on his ankle still present. Sherlock had known then, that something about the picture without the flowerpot had reminded him of that place, that cottage.
He’d felt a bit woozy as he’d sat down and had had to support himself with a hand on the hard sofa back.
The time at the hospital had been different, not only because Sherlock had been hurting, but also because by then he’d already figured it out. To be honest he’d not
Sherlock's fingers twitch as he reaches in his daydream to finally touch the cardigan, somehow different now as it rests against naked skin. It is not a bedroom garment at all, but it sure looks like one in his imagination. John all pale and a little shy underneath.
Underneath his eyelids, there had been an another world, a world where they had been at home already, and John had been bringing him cold cases and honey on a plate. He’d not known what, exactly, was the purpose of the honey, but it had felt warm and precisely correct, just like things could feel in dreams.
Everything is visible. John's collar still as neat and tidy as ever, a shadowy glimpse of his unique throat behind it, his broad shoulders relaxed, the cardigan draped over them, swooping down low and giving a generous view of his shirt covered chest. All the shirt buttons are unfortunately relaxed now but that does not matter, because for some reason the cardigan has stretched a bit as John has sat down, the top button straining just a little, the décolletage tight against John's pectorals. Dear God! Every time John breathes in, Sherlock can see how it tightens a little, he can almost feel the fibres of the fabric stretching, embracing the contours of John's chest.
been awake before we started on this insane cone case?”
The shirt is all tucked in now, just the buttons of his trousers and the belt buckle are left of this dresstease. John turns to face Sherlock, he just has to. This is the finale after all. He can see that Sherlock's orgasm is coming the second he reaches to button the lowest of his fly buttons. Sherlock hovers valiantly over the brink of it during the first button and the second button, his hand furious now, his eyes blowing wide. John can see that it is a desperate battle for Sherlock to keep his gaze clear and focused.
“I still have them on”, John offers, just to realize that he's not actually helping at all. Sherlock sort of twists all over and clenches one hand into his curls. It's John's turn to stare mesmerized.
is a little bit weird, even for him. Funny, though, he vaguely remembers that it had seemed logical enough as he'd sent it.
The delicious tingle in Sherlock's spine is caused partly by John's firm outside-cold hand curled around his arm and partly by those words. "My doctor…" Sherlock mumbles. The heat, it seems, is still making him drowsy, and perhaps he has a bit of a fever because the whole world seems hazy and wonderful and strange. He feels a pressure on his hip, and a wet something on his forehead, and something heavy is pulled over his body. Another blanket. He feels so deliciously warm now, and even though John's hand is gone, he still feels the firm support of it on his skin as he is drifting to sleep again.
How hot do you feel at the moment on a scale of 1-10 where 1 is a little bit chilly and 10 is hot enough to start shedding clothes?
It only takes a few breaths and then Sherlock opens his eyes again. He looks directly at John, his mouth slack but his eyes sharp even though his eyelids are lowered. John takes a breath in and pulls his belt through the loop, tightens and fastens it as Sherlock licks his lips and shivers.
He’d fallen in a deep velvety slumber dreaming of dark alleyways and daring chases – always with a warm calming presence beside him, a strong hand to pull him to safety, and a quick efficient word exchanged in the middle of a carefully balanced chaos.
“John.”
“...the wall had it coming.”
“But we've moved it since, it's against the wall now.”
“I just… Do you…?” Sherlock tries valiantly to form a question, any kind of question it seems, but then blinks, closes his mouth and apparently decides to remain silent. Perhaps he's afraid John did it by accident, and any questioning might cause John to retrace his motions? Sherlock flicks his hand with a never-mind gesture but his gaze remains intent.
He’d been in the middle of a frustratingly nagging cold case. A daughter and an estranged mother, mysteriously paid bills, and a disappeared cabinet. Now that he thought about it, John had been right, it
“That’s not a case”, he huffed, “You cannot solve that. People are just buying less ice cream. It’s just bad business sense from the shops. Or random bad luck. In any case, the people of Lissom Grove should have just bought more ice cream from this roller-coaster if they loved the place so much. Serves them right. People are idiots.”
“AAAAAAH!”
John smiled.
But John has to pee. So he pulls them down.
John is leaning back though now, his legs splayed open and his arms relaxed on the chair arms, one holding the book he is reading, his gaze angled a bit to the side.
“Tell me more about the cottage”, John had said.
He pondered it for a few days researching several scenarios and schemes. It couldn’t be so hard, could it, when even John had been able to do it? The internet was full of bright ideas. Surprising John with a Valentine’s day cake had to be discarded, though. It was four months until Valentine’s, and he suspected John might not appreciate pink hearts and sparkles on his person on a regular Tuesday. Offering John his favourite food was out as well as they ate it all the time anyway.
John?
However unlikely this glimpsing is, Sherlock likes to hang out slightly to the right of John, so that he has a good view between John's buttons. He will take this view gladly any time, a glimpse of John's skin is always tantalizing, but, to be honest, the best chills are the ones he gets when the shallow opening between two buttons reveals the ribbed cotton of a vest underneath.
John freezes his belt still open. Sherlock looks breathtaking. Spent, frayed, full of energy, his hair a mess, his eyes closed, one hand still on his half hard cock, the other fisted in an iron lock around his own clothes, his chest heaving up and down as if he just finished an Olympic level sprint.
John turns fully now, his need to see overpowering his need to seem oblivious. It's not like he can keep up the charade for much longer now anyway.
John smiled even wider and chuckled.
Sherlock of course regretted his feverish unthinking words in the hospital, but it was not like he could take them back. What was done was done.
John texts him that time, and Sherlock – feeling bizarrely like his legs are on fire – reluctantly scrolls up his message history to see what prompted the overreaction this time.
dressing gown?”
John reaches to continue petting his hair.
Waterloo
John for his part is completely mesmerized by Sherlock's concentration. He remains silent and waits patiently, but at the same time he is desperate to see what Sherlock will do next. Will he touch the shirt underneath as well? Will he roll the cuffs? How is this affecting him, what is so incredibly fascinating about this?
"God, John, your butt. John, did I ever tell you how perfect you are? Kneeling like this on the sofa, leaning against our new wall, under our new smiley face, your hole all prepared and gaping for me...”
There is something wonderfully satisfying in the knowledge, that these two layers will be rubbing against each other close to John's body the whole day. That there are at least two layers of honest fabric to protect John wherever he happens to stumble that day, that his skin is warm and safe, cradled by the warmth of the shirt and hugged by the tightness of the vest. It brings a safe, sanctioned feeling to Sherlock's own chest as well.
“Nope, we're not gonna christen anything else in this flat tonight. Nor anywhere else, Sherlock. And stop pouting. I'm an old man. I'm not gonna be able to fuck like a rabbit every day, you know.”
“It's ok, I... Oh, god, that feels good! Please don't stop.”
It seemed John had been trying to make him take a break and not trying to help him with the case. It was a stupid tactic, but sometimes Sherlock liked to indulge John.
“You... cock!”
“Christ, Sherlock, can you...”
“Don’t take your shirts off.”
After a while of just laying there, he turned his head to look at John. “What happens now?” he asked. It was a curious thing. He’d been nervous before. Incredibly nervous. But he did not feel nervous now. Not at all. Just easy.
Have a good lunch
Then nothing happens.
"They better be in the laundry, that’s all”, John tries again, “they got pretty soaked, both of them."
“... that you were here.”
Later John would be lying on his back in Sherlock's bed, all naked except for that cardigan, still all neatly buttoned up, while Sherlock would be plunging deep into him over and over and over. John would be panting and quivering and pleading, and Sherlock would tease his nipples slipping his fingers just under the ribbing, and John's chest and belly would still rise up and fall down underneath that brown sheerness, only all fast and furious now. And, God, how good his skin would look and feel underneath it, just hidden and yet so terribly visible.
Must be a record
Would you like to hear the results?
There is a cup of tea beside John, so Sherlock has at least a while to indulge. Thankfully John is holding a book this time, not a newspaper. Sherlock can count the frustrating mornings of trying to glimpse anything of John's gorgeous torso with the length and width of the infuriating Independent, or whatever it was that John read, in the way. Talking about teasing. John is a practical master. Not that he knows anything about it.
The line is indicating that Sherlock is currently typing again, and John dearly hopes he’s not yet on his way. They have an agreement, damn it! The last message came already 8 minutes ago. Sherlock can achieve a lot in that time.
The details of the case had slowly dispersed to be replaced by the feel of his feet against the rough of the train upholstery, the smell of mud and sweat in the car, imported by the dozens and dozens of travelers traipsing in and out of the car every day, the sharpness of John's clavicle under his skull, and the steady rise and fall of John's chest as he’d breathed under Sherlock.
Even though the door to the landing is firmly shut, they can hear a small delighted chuckle. A little later careful steps tap downstairs, successfully avoiding all the creaks in the old stairs.
“Ah, yes, I think”, he answers, “Hot. A little snug. They pull in a different… sort of way.”
And then, frowning, he added, “Why would you be afraid?”
The John in his dream had put his palm against his forehead then, and Sherlock had thought it curious, because why would the dream John have suspected he was feverish? One did not usually have fevers in dreams.
Before the latest developments, John had been often dozing off here and there in their living room and during cases, but this new polite John seemed to be always awake and alert and often retreating to his own room in the evenings when they didn’t have anything urgent going on.
figured it out. It was not like he could have announced it to the world – or even to himself out loud. The risk of being found wrong would have been much too high.
“That's it John, you're gonna come all over the... wall and you're gonna wail like a banshee while you're... doing it like you always do.”
“John”, Sherlock mumbles with fabric in his mouth, “you’re hard”.
“All right, all right! But just so we're clear, that was a really bad joke.”
“Not a roller-coaster, a carousel”, John smiled, “But what if it isn’t just bad luck? What if there’s a gang behind it?”
“John, I did not know you...”
John for his part was frozen in mixed shock and terror. Despite having been in the army and shared more community showers than he could count he really did not much appreciate being naked around other people. It was not that he was self-conscious, he just much rather kept that sort of thing private for the more intimate occasions.
But John had just said, “Because.” And then he’d said, “Sit down”.
The end of Sherlock's statement dragged a bit as he lowered his gaze in embarrassment. Unfortunately this did not help him with his flustered condition as he first now realized John's state of dress. Or undress.
“Fuck, I want to tear off all your clothes and I want to keep you just like this forever”, Sherlock breathes, and John smiles since this is not the first time he hears this particular dilemma of Sherlock’s.
Some time later John is petting Sherlock’s hair again. It is one of his favourite pastimes. They are laying in bed already, languid, relaxed, not yet ready to sleep but tired enough to call it a day. Both of them are wearing fewer layers. Still some, though; Sherlock categorically refuses to let John sleep naked. Sometimes John wonders that he is even allowed to shower naked.
Sherlock's voice is unsteady, and John’s nerves abate a little. He recognizes that quiver, it is of the good sort; hopeful and curious. Horny.
off!”
That morning John feels a little bit nervous and a little bit ridiculous as he descends the stairs and steps into the kitchen. He gives just a quick glance at Sherlock, just to check, and of course the mad bastard has noticed. The mad bastard has gone completely still and his breathing has become curiously even all of a sudden.
“That's just because I'm a killer shot, John.”
“And how long had
* * *
“Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck, I'm close, Sherl... oh, I...ah...”
“Jooohn, what are you doing?”
His name sounds tremulous on Sherlock's lips. Sherlock drops down to his knees in front of him and places his hands on John's knees. John lifts his own hands out of the way and lets them flop on the arm rests. He feels rather exposed suddenly, even if he is fully clothed – or, perhaps, exactly because of it. Sherlock fingers the fabric of his trousers, his hands are trembling. Then he impulsively leans closer and cradles John’s thigh, hiding his face in the fabric.
Went to see your pants drawer in stead
Underneath the concealing coat, he’d brought his own hand up to find John's. Their fingers had entwined together, and a pure white joy had burst inside Sherlock. He’d not been quite sure, but perhaps he’d hummed, or perhaps it had been John.
He’d been swimming in a pool where the waters of these two worlds mixed; the real world and the one that had felt more and more real by every passing breath. The waters were gradually mingling and swirling in together and creating confused but pretty shapes on the surface. He’d asked the John in his dream – the one who was now wearing nothing but Sherlock's dressing gown, for some delightful reason – “So is this where you pull me close and seduce me by serial cuddling?”
This time Sherlock seems frantic enough, though, and John is curious to see where he takes things. Sherlock’s hands are smoothing up and down John’s trousers and they unerringly find the creases of his double pants underneath. Sherlock keeps cursing and dropping his forehead against John’s thighs again and again. John cannot but follow the frantic ritual in awe. It’s a huge turn on.
Just the though of John's chest and belly rising and falling underneath those layers, how his skin touches the underside of that shirt, where it is tight and where it is loose, where it is soft and where the wrinkles tickle his skin... yes, just that thought alone makes a swirl of helpless arousal blossom in Sherlock's belly.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, just hums and snuggles closer.
But in his memory, as he'd already been drifting to sleep, what had made his dreams all the sweeter, was the fact – and he’d been quite convinced of it back then – that there had in fact been two simultaneous hums.
Because it clearly is. A deep flush has crept on Sherlock’s cheeks and he has forgotten all about his steady breathing, it seems it was forced earlier after all. He is biting his lower lip slightly, and, glancing down, John thinks he can see a slight bulge forming in the front of Sherlock’s trousers.
“You... listened to what I said last night... at the crime scene.”
There was a warm feeling all over him. Something safe and soft. Like the whole world was muffled. Colourful dream images were still casting lovely shadows all over his mind and he sighed. It was like all those times he’d fallen asleep in John’s arms. This was what John did for him, he’d thought back then; John allowed him to enter new worlds, explore, dream. He felt free and safe to journey far, because John was there as his anchor, a safe place to return to.
“Christ! I know you love me, but try not to let the flattery go to my head!”
“So sure of yourself are you now?”
, Sherlock sends back some time later after opening several of his drawers and pulling everything out. He owns lots of pants and t-shirts, it seems, but no socks. He feels strangely mellow and it feels nice following John's orders, because even though they make no sense at all, they also make him giggle.
John has always been a sexual creature, but even he could not have guessed the level of arousal Sherlock can achieve from the smallests of things sometimes.
Because Sherlock can’t stop staring at that little peek of pale skin. They are sitting opposite each other, in their chairs, and John reaching for things slightly behind him makes the gap between those two buttons of his shirt open just so.
He imagines a tiny Sherlock living in his pants and knows instantly that that would be insane. He would never eat, never sleep – never do anything but be rock hard and basically just coming in his pants all day long.
John?
The key is to guard like a hawk the moments, when John has to reach for something or twist his body. This is why, for example, their coffee lives in the upper shelf of the cabinet. John has to lift his left hand and while he is standing with his back to Sherlock, Sherlock has enough time to observe in peace.
“Bedroom”, Sherlock whispers and John can only nod.
Jackpot.
He’s also feeling incredibly hot. In a literal sense. He desperately wants to shed some clothes, but of course he doesn’t want to at the same time. But his throat is so dry.
John had been quiet afterwards, just looking at Sherlock with large eyes and – once Lestrade had arrived – had announced that they were going home. The cab ride had been a long one, and Sherlock's eyes had drooped the moment they’d sat down and closed the doors.
“And?” John asked, lifting his eyebrows, smiling like Sherlock was speaking nonsense again and like John didn’t really mind that much.
It sometimes happened when he was with John that his mind started wandering. The importance of whatever he was obsessing over slowly vanished as other, different things, flooded his mind. It had happened that time as well, when John's palm had rested against his belly, hidden there in their cocoon of warmth. It must have happened gradually, because he’d been thinking about the barn at first, and then he’d been thinking about the killer, and then, at some point, Sherlock had realized that John’s palm was smoothing small circles over his stomach, and that he’d not, in fact, been thinking about the case in some time.
When he finally opens their living room door, Sherlock is sitting by the table, ostensibly working on his computer, but John can see how his fingers are tapping on the table top and that his hair is already wild from tugging. Judging from the state of the room, it looks like Sherlock has tried to work all afternoon, but has apparently not been able to do much more than make a mess, worn his clothes twisted and tugged his hair awry.
John knows Sherlock is good at pacing. That means that John has to work like clockwork here. Just as normal, so that Sherlock knows how to time his quickly impending orgasm.
When John finally comes home, he crouches by Sherlock's side and smooths Sherlock's shoulder and sets a mug of tea close by and lifts a full bag of flu medicine on the table. "I'm here now, you lanky git. You'll be all right, your doctor will take care of you", he says.
It took him the whole day and the better part of the following night to plan it all out. Calculating distances between the shops, figuring out the average customer frequencies. Pondering on the competition. But honestly much more of the planning went into devising clever ways of keeping John awake and by his side at all times.
As he felt the telltale tug deep in his belly and a horrible dread crawling up his spine causing nervous spit to pool in his mouth, he let his gaze start sweeping up again. In perfect timing to see the pale exquisite long delicate gorgeous cock of his flatmate twitch as well.
The snuggling John had vanished, and in his place was a new John. A polite, vary, and annoyingly respectful John.
John gestures down, towards Sherlock’s groin, but Sherlock’s frown only deepens.
Sherlock stands up when John drops his bag by the door. John is about to shrug off his jacket, but Sherlock lifts his hands up in a halting gesture.
“What do you mean? What are you pointing at...? Oh! Oh!”
“Wooo! Take it easy”, John had crooned. He’d pulled a careful arm around Sherlock, wary of not upsetting the elbow in the makeshift fling he'd devised earlier.
Sherlock had been tired enough to just sigh as a reply. He’d ran the quip about John’s diplomatic skills in his head, though – no reason to let his rudeness go rusty even if he was too tired to open his mouth.
John feels relaxed and light, the success of his scheme still making him feel on top of the world and a little dizzy. But he feels grounded at the same time. The tangible love and affection he feels for Sherlock makes him stop and breathe easier. It makes him steady on his purpose and sure in his belly that this is where he belongs.
I know it’s not leather. Your clinic is not posh enough.
Reaching to pull their covers up he smiles into the slowly darkening room.
“You're a crack shot, Sherlock, please, mercy! I want to come with you inside me. Please.”
You must be at Waterloo
“Really?”
John is surprised that there is no immediate reply, but he gets an explanation as he stands in the escalator on Waterloo, about to change to the Northern. The two pings from Sherlock make him flush.
Don’t take them off I mean
“I know you think I’m an idiot, Sherlock, but there’s not many ways one can interpret
“It was a great... John! You – when did you do this?”
Of course – coming back to the morning deductions – depending on the shirt and what John is doing, there might occur the ultimate opportunity of glimpsing something from between the buttons. Sherlock often wishes John might prefer tighter shirts so that this occurrence might be more commonplace, but, after all, it is probable that John's propensity to wear layers stems from the same need as does his preference for a comfortable loose fit, so all in all, Sherlock is loath to disturb the status quo.
“So who’s scheme are we on now?” he asked.
I will tell you
"No, don't take it off John, pleease, don't take
“I know”, Sherlock answers, smiling.
The knowledge seeps in as an afterthought; something so simple and relevant that it almost does not bear mentioning. Yet he lingers on that feeling over and over and lets it soothe him into a soft caring sleep.
“Let me just close the door.”
John is floored again by the intensity of Sherlock’s arousal. He looks a wreck. His hair is a mess. His eyes gleaming. His lips red from biting. His mouth slightly open, his breathing shallow and hard. His cheeks rosy. His hands quivering on John’s buttons. He is kneeling between John’s spread legs and normally John would mostly feel the heady anticipation of a blow job, but now he cannot but feel Sherlock’s anticipation as well; Sherlock just as much under John’s thrall as John is under Sherlock’s.
“I actually put
Sherlock's eyes never leave him as he takes his cup and plate and deposits them into the sink. He feels a little conspicuous still and blushes when he shrugs into his jacket and grabs his bag.
“Ah, god, stop twisting it if you want me still hard when you fuck me, I've been walking around with this in my arse for hours now.”
“I just hope they are not laying somewhere for Mrs. Hudson to find…”
“You’re insane, did you know that?” John asked and smirked, but he was not really waiting for an answer, he just leaned his head back against the sofa and closed his eyes.
“221B Baker Street”, he announced, and the smile John gave him when he slid beside him on the backseat was radiating. On top of that, Sherlock was pleased to note that John looked completely worn out. In fact, he was already yawning.
“Getting the blood flow back?”
Well, that was not what John had expected, but then it was as well, because when did he ever expect the expected from his friend?
As John plops the third button in, Sherlock comes, shivering, and his gasp sounding like a surprised exclamation, his cock spurting semen into his hand, but also onto his t-shirt and all over his dressing gown. He spurts again as John continues closing his buttons and when they are all done, Sherlock finally closes his eyes as the final tremors of his orgasm course through his body.
God John
As the early morning sunbeams hit the Icy Carousel windows, they curved to the street in a cab, just in time to catch the building owner. He was about to go in and shut down the freezers, and so it happened that they were just in time to save the ice cream with the pretty little loophole Sherlock had found in the eviction papers. The irate building owner swore a great deal and then took a cab to find his lawyer.
I would experiment but then you perspire more than I do
Sherlock sends and smirks at the phone.
No, better to buy a new pair while he's out.
To introduce new kind of toughing, Sherlock briefly considered picking up a hobby where they would have to be in contact. Like wrestling. Or partnered yoga. Or tandem skydiving. But talking John into it would be a pain, and the results were doubtful in any case.
Sherlock still seems frozen, so John reaches for his trousers, and that finally sends Sherlock into a flurry of movement. His pajama pants are pushed unceremoniously down – just an inch or two – and his cock is out in seconds. He is grabbing his t-shirt through the dressing gown he already shrugged on earlier. This is a habit John knows well; Sherlock likes to fondle the clothes he has on for masturbation, the more layers he can grab, the better.
Sherlock has John’s trouser buttons open now. He lets one trebling hand in, to sneak first under the shirt tails and the vest and then up against John’s waistband. They both shiver as John feels Sherlock’s palm half against his pants, half against the naked skin of his belly. Soon the shirt and the vest are pulled up in the front, and Sherlock trembles as he pushes his fingers against John’s belly and then, intent, under the pants. Sherlock trembles even more as he pulls a little back, finds the edge of the pants again and this time pushes his fingers between the two waistbands. In just a blink he has fingers in all the slots; against John’s skin, between the two pants, and between the pants and the trousers. He is panting hard, leaning his forehead against John’s belly.
“Don't you like what we've done here then?”
“How do you always know?”, he’d asked then as well, but could not have answered John's baffled counter question of, “Know what?”, because an insistent hum had been just then filling his ears, the promise of sleep suddenly tasting intricately sweet.
It will be a while yet before John will put his book down and stretch and yawn and finally stand up and wander back to the kitchen to make another cuppa. That will give Sherlock just enough time to carefully stand up and adjust himself and sneak into the bathroom or his own room to silently take care of himself.
Miffed, Sherlock had risen from his chair, sat down on the sofa, and John had poured them tea. Sherlock had opened his mouth to start reviewing all the details of the case just like he usually did, because of course that was what John had been aiming for all along, but John had spoken before he’d been able to choose where to start from; from the first oddity with the flower pot that had been missing from one of the crime scene photos or from the phone call from Maria, because while the flower pot had started the investigation, the phone call had started the crime and…
he sends back, because, really, his toes are toasting now.
John looked at him and grinned. He was obviously joking. But Sherlock had already taken notice. He was desperate, and this
87% of office chairs are using a blend with synthetic fibres it seems
John sends to his under table sock ambush cove, and John really is funny today. What tea is he talking about?
John’s cock likes the last idea.
“Sit down, you're knackered, it was a long case. It'll probably take an age for her to find us a doctor now.”
“What?” John asks.
Your clinic had a remodeling seven years ago, did they purchase new chairs then?
John is suddenly very aware of his skin underneath the double layers and as he mechanically follows his morning routine of coffee making, he thinks the entire apartment is echoing from the rustle of his shirts.
Of course John could have just sneaked quickly behind the shower curtain or even remained facing the wall, but the sudden noise and the sudden presence of someone else in a room he'd thought empty and private startled him and his first instinct was to turn around in a flash and face the possible threat.
There is a hesitant question in the last word, and John feels a little offended now.
“Oh”, Sherlock breathes in. He goes a bit red and tucks his face into John’s leg, “It’s all right.”
The thing now is to act cool. Like nothing’s happened. Let Sherlock come to him for once. He’s done the first move already, he’s not about to turn around like a nervous schoolboy and watch his flatmate approach, he’s not.
It had taken a little bit of shuffling and arrangement, but finally they’d found a position they’d both been comfortable in. John's chest had been warm, and as John had been sitting quite tall and as Sherlock had been slumping down a bit, his head had slotted nicely into the crook of John's neck.
John bites his lip. It’s the double exclamation mark that does it. Sherlock doesn’t use double punctuation.
“Fuck, John, it’s so obvious. You’ve been walking around like this and anyone could have seen although no one did and. Yes, it’s obvious. Yes, I can see them, the fabric pulls here and here, and the way these trousers fit on you, it’s pretty clear once you. They are also visible whenever you, fuck John, I need to…”
It is a veritable feast.
“Can you feel them?” he asks after his breathing has slowed and he’s letting his thumb smooth John’s trousers again.
Better yet to buy several pairs, take most of them home all innocent like and leave just one pair at the clinic for later use. Sherlock will deduce his trip to the clothing store anyway, but this way he might not question the missing pair. If John is lucky.
“Fuck, John, I’m going to come”, Sherlock breathes. John is pretty hard himself, even though for him, in all honesty, nothing has actually happened yet.
Sherlock hums. He follows John all the way down to the front door, but they don't dare kiss there. They both seem to feel it would be too risky.
This one originated on Tumblr as well, as a reaction to
Most often, though, Sherlock just has to rely on the tiny observations he makes on the movement of John's shirt. He has perfected this skill after all, feeling itchy and snappish all day, if he does not know exactly what layers John is wearing. If Sherlock just has the five or ten minutes observation time, while John is making his coffee and perhaps a bit of toast, Sherlock has to be smart about it.
The kiss is not the chaste peck they are used to. It turns heated the moment their lips meet, and John is startled to note that the one moaning is him. As if summoned by his moan, Sherlock's hands circle behind John, sneaking under his jacket and sliding against his trousers, cupping him under his buttocks.
I doubt any of them have even noticed
“What can I do for you then, love?” he asks. He will be happy to return the favor, put more clothes on, let Sherlock rub one against him, whatever Sherlock wants.
“But…”
John is so handsome as he shrugs his jacket off.
Sherlock imagines slowly opening the buttons of the plaid shirt, not yet touching John, but pushing the fabric aside so that he can look. John's skin is smooth and milky white. Somehow in his fantasy it is easy to open the buttons underneath the cardigan too, letting the shirt fall open all the way underneath, and watch John's belly rise and fall just under that sheer cardigan, his skin against it, his whole midriff visible but yet covered.
Sherlock loves this particular shirt, the plaid so simple and understated and yet somehow... firm. So John. He loves how the fabric looks all soft and fluffy and terribly crisp at the same time. How often he’s imagined letting his fingers brush over that neatly folded collar and then, trembling, smooth down to feel the heat of John’s skin just under that wide expanse of plaid over his beautiful chest.
“What? You? I thought you didn't care what Mrs. Hudson 'or anybody else' thinks?”
His trousers up, John makes a point of being efficient and precise. He angles his body so that Sherlock has a good view, though, it is a show after all, even if a mundane kind. His trousers are still open in front, offering a glimpse of his pants. His shirt is next, and he lifts his hands to the top button. He always starts from his chest and continues downwards, one button after another, closing the shirt over his vest. Sherlock whimpers, and John hears him shuffle on the bed, probably finding a better position – for wanking or for viewing, John does not know.
John smiles. He cannot resist pushing a bit.
It can happen, that John's shirt pulls a little bit up from his waistline as he reaches up, particularly when Sherlock has pushed the coffee a little further back in the cupboard. Sometimes John leaves the shirt as it is, causing a little more bunching on his left side. Sherlock loves regarding this patch of fabric throughout the morning, and imagining, that he could somehow live inside that small space he has created at John's side, just above his belt.
“Yes. You have. Repeatedly. Now, let me fuck you against the wall.”
Right now, John is just fresh from the shower, and Sherlock is still sprawled sleepy and relaxed on their bed. John rubs his towel one last time through his still damp hair, reaches into his drawer and takes out a pair of his normal pants. He pulls them on; over his legs and all the way up to settle snug around his hips. He slides into a white vest next and then selects socks, black ones.
“Yes, darling?” he inquires and – damn yeah – his own voice comes out smooth and light, completely normal. He feels like bumping his fist in the air but he struggles to remains calm.
“John, you sly little... Lean against the wall.”
Somehow that makes John feel a little dizzy. It would be just the kind of thing Sherlock would know how to deduce. John vows to test his hypothesis later.
John thinks.
We might have to visit my brother next month after all.
Sherlock opens his mouth as if to say something, but he seems overwhelmed, just looking at John, his eyes roaming up and down.
Or another wank.
Sherlock is completely hard in his chair now and almost panting for the want of touch, friction, more, anything. Yet he sits still, trying to even his breathing, trying to calm his wildly beating heart. Wondering if his face is already all red from arousal and desperately hoping that John will not be able to smell the moist debauchery in his pants.
John is getting more excited the closer he gets to the door of 221B. In the afternoon Sherlock’s texts turned more and more into the whiny unhinged pleading kind, and John is rather relieved he managed to get off work almost on time.
John, who’d sat there patiently all the while, had finally huffed and puffed and then bustled to the kitchen. He'd brought back a tray with mugs and a pot that had smelled like…
On the other hand, when has he gone for the safe option, ever?
John was full out smirking and winking now, but it was much more fun to take him seriously.
“Yes”, he says, “happy.”
Just the thought of them makes Sherlock anxious and pliable at the same time.
The whole case was stupid. It wasn’t even a case really, just a lot of running around and collecting fake evidence and talking to people and making it seem like a case so that John wouldn’t get too suspicious. Along the way, they did manage to find a reporter to do a positive story about the environmentally conscious oat ice cream shop in the morning, though. And after the lunch time rush Sherlock helped another shop owner revamp her marketing campaign. And later that night, as a corner shop was closing, they – well, mostly John – helped reattach a halfway fallen marquis.
In a pinch Sherlock has to deduce, whether John is wearing a vest under his shirt or not, and be satisfied with that. Naturally he can do it, it's simple enough. Sometimes even a hint of white is shining through the topmost layer. Because of course Sherlock has catalogued each and every one of John's clothes and therefore knows, that most of his vests are basic white; simple, uncomplicated, reliable quality.
“This makes you hard?”
Sherlock is keening, small whimpering sounds of alternating restraint and abandon.
“Mmmmffh.”
“Did you put the pants in the laundry then”, John asks, drawing circles on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I didn’t find them when I tidied up after my shower.”
With the right lighting and a thin enough shirt, the whole shape of the vest underneath can be almost appreciated. Sometimes Sherlock makes John change place to a particular chair for optimal light – some restaurants and cafés really are much too dim. John rarely seems to notice, though, and if he does, he just assumes it's to do with whatever case they are currently working on.
The first thing they did was to take a cab to the home of the last shop owner who’d lost his ice cream parlour, the Icy Carousel. Really what a stupid name!
“Where are they, Sherlock?" he asks.
“I don't. But her peaking through the gap in the door is making her hip ache.”
He was finished around 4am and he only waited for a few hours before he stomped upstairs to wake John up by banging on his door. Better to get a head start on making John tired.
“Sherlock.”
It sounds like so much more than happy when Sherlock says it. He tucks his head in John’s shoulder briefly, then rises again and flops beside John, to lay on his back, staring at the ceiling.
I think I’m getting hard again.
They’d been almost alone in the train car. Not so many people wanted to take the night train on a Wednesday it had seemed. The world had been dark around the train, and the lights inside the car had made gloomy reflections on the windows. John had taken the window seat, “because it would be warmer by the aisle”, he’d said. John was always insistent like that.
“Well?”
No worries
“Chamomile!? Why chamomile, John?” Sherlock had demanded. John only made chamomile when he thought Sherlock was irritated. How irrational. It had irritated him further.
It catches his own skin on fire.
John had instructed him to keep his scarf on but to take his shoes off. It had all seemed baffling, but John had been already arranging himself with confidence. He’d folded his own jacket and placed it against the dark chill of the window, turning sideways on his chair and scooting towards the window, leaning against the black of the night and lifting one sock clad foot up on the seat and against the backrest.
“Oh, I don't know, John. Something round and, hmm, small... Something I can shoot for...”
“I don’t know”, John said, and – he was still smiling! Smirking even. “This isn’t my scheme”, he said with a lopsided grin on his face.
John desperately wants to tear open all of his buttons, jump into the bed and fuck his lover silly.
“Sher... Sher... oh, I... Oh fuck, please, oh...”
He reaches out and grabs Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock seems happy enough to leave his trouser buttons for a while and smooth his thumb against John’s palm in stead.
“Oh”, John breathes, and it’s not nearly enough to express his awe.
“Good morning, Sherlock!”
How can one man be so incredibly tantalising?
Sherlock sits up a little straighter at John's confused, "Sherlock?" He decides against answering though, because, really, at this particular moment, he is not so sure of his voice. John is now making himself more comfortable in his chair, and, yes, Sherlock very much wants John to remain, so it is much better to remain silent. John likes his peace and quiet.
“God, John. You have to understand, it's… heady.”
John gulps half of it down in one go and swipes his forehead. He is sweating. From heat and nerves and arousal. He feels moisture gathering in his neck and under his vest and fuck, down in his pants. He feels flushed. The chair is hot against his back and under his thighs. He must reek down there by this point. Can Sherlock already smell him? He hopes it's a turn on and not the opposite.
Just a little longer now; he’d want John to be truly asleep, he didn’t want to startle him before he was completely under. Just a little longer now.
He's almost done it once or twice.
Why you never answer when it’s urgent?
That the real John must have felt for his forehead at the same time the dream John had.
Oh god, Sherlock is becoming hard from the simple act of touching his sleeve. He, John, has made Sherlock hard by pulling on two shirts that morning and now they are standing in their kitchen surrounded by this magical tension and John is suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the situation.
“Actually, I don't fucking care, just fuck me, Sherlock, harder please, tilt a little, just a little, I need to...”
Please!!
“We already did that, Sherlock! Twice!"
“Fuck!”
Here was the plan then: He would make John tea and he would make John fall asleep and then he’d cuddle and pet John, and then, voilà, John would wake up, and they would kiss. It was inevitable. Although he was a little uncertain still as to what exactly the function of the tea was in this scenario, but, nevertheless, he’d make it work. He was a genius after all.
“I didn’t. I wouldn’t.”
Now the images slowly blended into the feel of heaviness in his body. He was a little groggy as well. Like he was waking from a deep slumber. He was relaxed, though, surrounded by safety and softness. Something was warm against his arm, soothing small familiar circles against his skin.
“Er…”, John offers, “would you like to…?” he gestures at Sherlock's groin, and Sherlock whines, a long, wiry sound deep in his throat.
“Gnnnhhh, I thought... that was... the point.”
“I don't know, John. You did like it when I bit your big ears just now.”
He looks wrecked. His body tense, his mouth slightly open, his pupils dilated. John cannot help the stupid smile that spreads all over his own face. He was right. This was not a stupid idea, this was a brilliant idea. This was, quite probably, even more brilliant an idea than the one Sherlock had last week that lead to the arrest of the burglar who owned a limping dog.
“We should have just gone home”, Sherlock had whined, but John had simply scooted closer and held him.
Very hot
“N-no, oh god, Sherlock, I was serious about not lasting, careful with your fing... eeers!”
Sherlock makes another small strangled sound in his throat. He is frozen in place, but his hips are tilting minutely, gyrating in minuscule ticks against the bed. John is pretty sure Sherlock is not aware of it.
“I didn't mean your cock, John. Although...”
During the ride, their positions had naturally shifted and molded through adjustments needed because of an aching arm here or a numbing leg there. At one point, one of John's hands had fallen down from Sherlock’s belly and ended against Sherlock's hip in stead. Sherlock had at first missed the smoothing circles that hand had drawn, but luckily this hand had had a caressing thumb as well, and it had commenced smoothing over his hip bone and back again in repeated soft waves.
That was a first.
Sherlock looks at him like he’s a triple homicide in a locked prison cell, and his mouth opens a little. Apparently he had not realized he actually gets to call the shots. But of course he gets to call the shots, John thinks. This is for Sherlock, after all. John is here to – well, whatever it is Sherlock wants. Besides, John happily submits to anything if it means he gets to see this expression on his lover's face.
He settles a bit deeper into his own chair, lifts his legs up to conceal his groin and surreptitiously glances down to make sure his dressing gown is strategically draped.
“Ok, ok, I'm just. Here, let me massage your arm.”
Like Sherlock guessed, John goes to the corner place with two of his colleagues. He tries not to think about the messages when he feels his phone vibrating away in his pocket. He’s eating, damn it. Besides, over time he’s learned that it doesn’t much matter to Sherlock when or even if John reads his messages – if they are not case related urgent notes that is, but Sherlock knows these days to call if it’s really important. For John, on the other hand, it saves a lot of unnecessary stressing out if he doesn’t check every message, but just reads the whole story later as something that already happened. So he checks his phone first as they are already leaving the restaurant.
* * *
“Oh, how about something like… ‘Sherlock Holmes and the ice cold deduction – with sprinkles!’”
“Oh, yes”, Sherlock sighs.
“You're incorrigible, has anyone ever told you that?”
In fact
“How do you want to come?” John clarifies.
“Well. Who’s gonna do the kissing?” Sherlock frowned.
He won't though. He stands his ground, his hands still on his belt, waiting for Sherlock to open his eyes again. This is not about undressing, this is about dressing and this is for Sherlock.
As he opened his eyes to the otherwise empty living room, he’d finally known what it was.
Back then he’d been pacing the living room carpet threadbare, and no amount of hair pulling had seemed to help his thoughts the way it usually did. Usually it calmed him down and centered him and pulled new surprising thoughts out. That time, it had just made him more irritated.
“John. Are you all right?”
Eventually Sherlock pushes one hand wholly inside John’s pants and moans out loud. John is sweaty and soaking in precome and rock hard.
John laughed out loud with that, “That’s just brilliant. I can already see the headlines: ‘Sherlock Holmes saves London’s finest cones’, ‘Holmes for the rescue: your ice cream is safe when Sherlock Holmes patrols the streets!’”
Going now. Eat something Sherlock.
“You... you prepared yourself for me... But how did you know?”
“I know. Have a… good day”, John breathes. His normal greeting sounds trite. Also lewd somehow.
Did you know he can mess with our heating as well?
John snapped the paper shut and grumbled something, but Sherlock was already thinking about the possibilities of the case. Inspecting all those shops and standing in their freezers for one; everyone knew cold air kept you awake. It would be perfect, it would make John alert while Sherlock surreptitiously tired him up. Oh, it would all work out perfectly.
He’d had the right idea from the beginning; picking up where John had left off. He would just have to do it quite literally. It would be simple like catching a burglar who had stepped in fresh paint on their way out!
Sherlock is still silent, sitting opposite John at the table. His eyelids are heavy and his posture languid and relaxed. John loves seeing him like this. Blissed-out and loose for once. John had better leave soon so Sherlock can crawl back to bed and burrow under the blankets for his shag nap. Or an extended recording session in his mind palace.
Sherlock, for his part, looks ready to burst, his fully hard cock tenting his pajama pants. Well, it wouldn’t be the first time Sherlock got off from John dressing in the morning.
Sherlock seems to be having trouble articulating, but his gaze smooths lovingly over the folds of John’s shirtsleeve, probably calculating the exact point of tension in the fabrics or figuring out the exact measurements of the sleeves or whatever it is genius detectives with complicated kinks contemplate while looking at the object of their... study.
“Wow”, John says.
“Well...”
“So…”, John asks, “Good?”
Did an experiment anyway
Until then he is stuck, sitting in his chair, legs folded, trying to keep from moaning aloud, his cock hard as a rock and leaking, soaking his pants, he unable to do fuck all about it lest John notice. It is part of the excitement of his little hobby, this torture, never knowing when John will leave, being under his mercy so to speak, even if John himself has no idea of his role in the game.
John had then pulled Sherlock's coat over them both and told Sherlock to fold his legs all the way inside the warmth of the cozy nest they’d formed together. It had been a tight fit but they’d made it work, Sherlock’s toes poking out under the arm rest, John’s leg pressed tight between the backrest and Sherlock’s body.
He’d been so knackered after the overlong case that it was a small miracle he'd detained any information at all, let alone enough to deduce something worth while afterwards.
He still finds his voice first. “So, how… how do you want me?” he asks.
“That's it, John! Come for me, come for me, yes, scream your heart out, oh fucking hell, John, you did it, you, oh, fuck, JOHN!"
“I… sorry…”, he coughs, “can I fetch a glass first? Er, drink something…” He turns in his chair to gesture vaguely and starts to stand up, but Sherlock is already heading towards the kitchen, pouring him a tall glass.
“And? You think her knees will be any better when she needs to kneel to peak through the keyhole?”
The third time was harder to piece together, but Sherlock was sure it had started with a text from John. If he screwed his eyes together just so, he could almost land back there, in that evening.
Damn.
“Of course it matters! If neither of us knows who should be doing it, then neither of us is doing it and that’s…”
When John comes to a while later – finally properly understanding that he can move and act and think on his own – Sherlock is still there, leaning fully against John’s right thigh. He has tucked John inside his pants again. It feels a little gross, but John brushes it off. Sherlock is still breathing deep. Occasionally small tremors course through him and he’s leaning his head against John’s thigh, gazing dazedly at John’s pants, carefully petting John’s trousers. John pets Sherlock’s hair in turn and hums.
, John sends.
But he doesn't get to touch John. They are friends, yes, but not like that.
John knows they cannot fuck now. For one, he would be late for work, and for another, this is meant to be a tease. He is meant to wear the pants, not take them off.
“We already christened the sofa, Sherlock.”
So he’d quickly got lost in the story, about this cottage they'd visited one summer with his family, and about a cat that he'd befriended there, and all the adventures they’d embarked upon together. For a while he'd been there, in that field with the sun warming the wheat crop that gently swayed in the wind. Running after the black cat with a pink nose.
If the shirt is free to pull up right away, it means no vest, if the shirt clings in one or two parts for a fraction of a second just before pulling tight, however, then there is certainly a vest underneath.
Cotton or synthetic?
“Good”, Sherlock agrees and fumbles to squeeze John’s hand back.
When he was almost at his wits end and thought of just giving up and asking John for advice, it finally clicked: That was it! Asking John! Only, he didn’t have to ask John, he already knew what John would answer! Or at least what John’s approach would have been. Sherlock had experienced it!
There had been no cottage on the case, and Sherlock had been about to say so, but then, for some reason, he'd just told John more about the cottage. This was a discussion they’d started earlier, of course, the day before, when Sherlock had been looking at the file for the first time, and for some reason that cottage had come to his mind then.
“I think that can be arranged. Hold tight!”
“You know what, John?”
John still doesn’t know what to say. More than that he really doesn’t know what standing in the tube has to do with any of it. Perhaps it’s something to do with how his trousers crease? He feels conspicuous again, imagines his skin is itching under the double pants. He wants to type something, even if just to let Sherlock know he’s in on this. He opens his phone awkwardly while he walks.
It’s a while since I tried that.
“Ah, John, I'm sorry, I didn't realize...”
Good. Me, I’m snug and warm.
Of course John does not always wear enough layers.
He’d known that John was up to something with this hugging and cuddling and making Sherlock fall asleep business. He’d known too where he wished John would ultimately take it. Luckily John had seemed to have a pretty good handle on it himself, and so Sherlock had made an executive decision to just follow along and enjoy the ride.
His normal routine.
Sometimes, in his own room, Sherlock imagines reasons enough for John to adjust his clothing.
John generally liked to sleep in his own bed. He did it most nights in fact. But snuggling John there didn’t quite seem the correct thing to do. Not for the first time at least.
sounded a bit like a fairy tale.
Then his phone falls silent again.
I am feeling a little bit hot
“It was mine.”
“John…”
John had already brushed his teeth and had just chucked his pants and T-shirt in the laundry bin, about to step in the shower when the bathroom door creaked.
“I know now.”
, John texts, and Sherlock huffs, but before he has time to send a rebuttal – he is never ill, only John sometimes suffers from hypochondria, or whatever it is they call it when you think your flatmate is ill – John has followed with another text.
“John...”
The obvious solution was of course acquiring a long enough case that it would tire even this new alert John out. Too bad they didn’t have any cases on at the moment. At first, Sherlock tried a few cold cases, but they were so easy, he solved them all before he even had time to tell John about them. Then he tried calling Lestrade, but Lestrade just hung up on him.
The two cocks were mercilessly caught in a feedback loop where one growing made the other twitch and the other twitching made the other one swell ever more and then, oh dear god, was the other one leaking a bit and of course the other one surged up in sympathy.
“I'm not going to take them off”, John says, and the way Sherlock breathes out and flushes dark at that makes John hope he wasn’t in a hurry to get to work after all. But he’s determined to make this as good for Sherlock as possible. “I'm going to continue dressing up”, he says, “You know, pulling my trousers up, buttoning my shirt, that sort of thing. You're welcome to watch if you want.” He says it with a small tinge of allure in his voice.
“You complaining I'm not hitting the right spot now, John?”
“Thanks. Ouch.”
Limping dogs aside, John has to relieve Sherlock from this uncertainty now, it looks torturous.
He’d motioned Sherlock closer.
He will take a few minutes to calm down, to not spontaneously burst in his chair. Then, once his heartbeat evens out again, he will let his gaze linger over John once more; his legs splayed, his crotch all displayed there, all the myriad creases of his trousers, his belt so invitingly visible, the hem of the cardigan just there to caress the top of the belt. John's breaths just as even and mesmerising as ever.
“That's one fucking big target. Proves nothing.”
Can’t you skip a few?
Sherlock hadn't much cared, he’d just rolled his eyes and shivered. It had suited his mood; cold and dark and full of recriminations for a job poorly done. The killer had still been on the loose, and they’d wasted two whole days. He’d desperately wanted to come up with a better plan, but his thoughts had kept tumbling together and winding around the same routes every time he’d tried to think of a new way out of his dilemma.
“I like the smiley face.”
“John...”
“I left a pillow for her on the landing.”
Sherlock!
When John is outside and pushes the door closed, he can hear the thunder of Sherlock stomping back upstairs, three steps at a time. John waits a beat, double checking that he has his keys and his wallet, even though he knows exactly where they are. He just wants to give Sherlock time to reach their living room window.
“I have to go to work”, John pants against Sherlock's lips even as he grips Sherlock’s shoulders tighter. They lean their foreheads together to breathe.
By some miracle, Sherlock finds them. The socks tickle something mad, but they are still soft and they smell so much like John, that Sherlock spends some time as a pretzel on the floor sniffling his own feet. He briefly wonders why he’s on the floor, but then he remembers – he descended there in search of under table socks.
He opened his eyes and looked up. Blue eyes were looking down at him. Smiling blue eyes.
“Whatever do you mean? Get off, we can't both fit... Stop purring!”
“No”, John smiled again.
“No, love”, John smiles and he has to take a detour then, to kiss his husband quickly before he heads to the kitchen. The way Sherlock's breathing quickens as he leans over is not lost on him either.
"You berk,” he huffs, “of course I know I'm wearing two pairs of pants. Of course I did it on purpose.”
“This”, John had intoned, “is not going to happen again, Sherlock. And I'd still take you to the hospital, even if we did have an x-ray machine. Which we won't.”
Sherlock growled something like “bedroom” while John was busy suckling and licking and then biting hard on his trapezius. But as Sherlock crowded John towards the bathroom door, it was on the way and banged close behind them and they ended up smashed against the door, Sherlock's body grinding against John's, his hands franticly travelling over John's skin wherever he could find a place to reach. John's hands covered Sherlock's buttocks, squeezing and gripping and pulling close and down and then, he tilted his own hips slightly up, and there. Finally there was decent contact again, their groins together, grinding, their cocks side by side, touching again, their whole lengths flushed against each other and it was heaven.
It takes John a moment to register the question. Sherlock must mean his double pants.
He is still a little bit hard in his double pants.
John smirks, and Sherlock's mouth hangs just as open as before. Then he closes it and swallows audibly.
Moreover, Sherlock had asked John’s help with cases, but John had only sat down and asked rational questions. They had solved several cold cases, yes, but absolutely no cuddling had happened whatsoever.
“So…”, John draws out sliding his still unbuttoned shirt open and exposing the double waistline of his pants more clearly, “you like it?"
Oh. John had a point there. He had been awake much longer than John had. Well. He’d thought he could make it. He had much more practice in staying awake for unhealthily long time periods than John had.
He supposes,
Sherlock manages to swallow some of it, but most of it ends up pooling on John’s pants. It’s all right. Sherlock has slumped in his lap, his face resting in the sweaty gross mess.
He smiled. He didn’t know where he was, but it felt good nevertheless.
John has buttoned his shirt all the way down now, his hand just grazing over his slightly plumped cock underneath, and he has to lift his eyes to Sherlock at that. Sherlock shudders and blinks but keeps his eyes trained on John's groin.
“Yes, why don't we have an x-ray at home? Would be nice. I could run experiments. And you could fix me whenever this happens.”
John stands dumb with his trousers in his hand as Sherlock spits into his right palm. Sherlock grabs his already magnificently leaking cock with his spit slick hand and his hips twist up with a jerk. John assumes it’s involuntary. He marvels at the sensuality of the sight.
"Pass me that book, will you, John."
There is a certain friction in the movement of a shirt layered with a vest underneath. A shirt directly against the skin is more free to move about the torso, but a vest underneath makes the shirt pull and cling and wrinkle in a very distinct pattern.
Sherlock’s eyelids flutter and he sways a bit, but his gaze is steady and he breathes like it’s a herculean task that he’s proud to complete. His hands are almost steady as he slowly lifts them up.
Grudgingly, Sherlock had come to the conclusion that he’d scared John away. He’d been onto John for weeks and that had been fine, but now John was onto him being onto John and that, apparently, was not fine at all, it was the opposite of fine. It was a disaster. John was awkward, and Sherlock was awkward, and that made John even more awkward, and the nasty feedback loop was up and working like a charm – or like an unlucky charm, to be more precise.
I should take into account other factors that might cause a rise in body heat
“I don’t know”, John said, brushing a hand over his face, “I thought. You figured it out… I thought you might laugh at me. At the whole thing.”
Just the tips of their cocks meeting, one single point of contact between them. Soft, moist, delicate, unbearably exquisite.
Sherlock watching him dress and undress.
Then, a little later, John's other hand had sneaked up and stilled against his chest, just holding him there. Sherlock had known then that John's eyes had been closed. He had no idea how he’d come to this deduction, only it had seemed an important one at the time. Perhaps because it had brought him the courage to do what he’d done next.
, Sherlock sends back a little later and frowns at the letters, who all seem to be behaving badly today.
He does not look like he never-minds.
John's known world exploded around him into tiny immaterial bits as his now newly naked and vulnerable consciousness flooded with the allencompassing awareness of Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock. Sherlock made a high keening sound and it sounded awful, like he was perhaps dying, but John knew he had to be alive still, because the whole world was full of his heartbeat.
Sherlock is breathing fast and hard against his thigh. He’s trying to keep it together, John knows, and he bites his lip, trying to stay still, give Sherlock space to calm down. It helps. Sherlock relaxes a bit.
In the end he’d been too tired to argue. He knew John usually got what he wanted in situations like these. In fact, Sherlock was usually happy to follow along if it meant that John would take care of the practical things, and he could concentrate on the important stuff. Like finding the murderer. Sooner rather than later. So he’d capitulated.
I’m imagining you sitting down on those red chairs.
bullets in the wall today.”
“So”, Sherlock said. This was getting a little too convoluted and a little too far from the main point for his liking. He needed to get the conversation back to the right tracks.
He knows Sherlock is watching; Sherlock is always watching. At first it made John slightly uncomfortable, but he's gotten used to it by now.
He notices he is smiling into his coffee cup.
"Already leaning."
Then he opens his phone again. There are 43 unread texts.
He’d had to fight not to shiver then, as a new kind of warmth had spread through his belly and up his spine, and he'd felt suddenly dizzy despite his reclining position. He'd wanted to say something then, but had not known what it was.
“We were both exhausted, Sherlock. We needed the rest”, the smiling John said.
Turns out he can but he won’t
Before the first time. Sherlock ruminates on deducing John's garments.
Oh. John knew of his grand scheme?
The warmth had seeped into him slowly but undeniably; John's body warm and solid underneath him, his own coat heavy and concealing over them. The coat had been warm despite the slight moistness it had retained from their hike earlier that day.
* * *
John finally does it that morning, carefully nonchalant.
“But what, Sherlock…?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
“You like it still then?” he asks, and Sherlock merely whines.
John smiles and then frowns and lifts his head.
It doesn’t take long before Sherlock is opening John’s belt buckle. It always feels to John like a religious ritual; Sherlock so focused, on a one track mind. Once the buckle is open, he positions his fingers just so to open the top button. He takes a shuddering breath when he pops it. For an instant, John flashes back to this morning, to the moment he had closed the same button, just seconds after Sherlock had orgasmed.
With Sherlock's eyes now boring holes into John's left hand that's still limply grabbing the trousers, John gets a move on. He grabs the waistline more firmly and lets the trouser legs drop down, then steps into the left leg and then into the right. As he bends down he hopes the hems of his double pants show nicely under his butt.
"I'm holding them hostage."
“Sherlock! I made tea, come and sit down, we've been at this all day.”
Sherlock buries his nose in the pants and licks John over them. It doesn’t take long before both pants are wet, what with Sherlock’s saliva working from the outside and John’s precome working from the inside. John is slumped in his chair, loose and tense and whimpering from want. As arousing as he finds Sherlock's arousal, this is not quite enough friction for him, and he's starting to be desperate.
After the first stop at an empty station, John had collapsed the whole misshapen spiderweb of his thoughts by jabbing him with his elbow.
The sounds coming from the bed suggest they do. Sherlock's hand is flying over his cock, his mouth is open and his throat lax. The slick sounds around his cock and the heavy breathing in his throat are almost obscene.
“I'll stop if you admit I'm a crack shot.”
“Like this?”
John feels a slight hesitation creeping into his voice, but the answering, “Yes”, is just a quick swallowed breath as John lifts both his cuffs up as if for an inspection.
Sherlock takes a long while just staring at that chest rising and falling, the first button of the cardigan neatly snuggled in the middle. That cardigan is certainly one of the most erotic things John owns. It is all proper and neat, but so thin that it's actually transparent. Especially with a shirt like this, with clearly contrasting colour values. Everything shows.
“It’s all right, John. I already came.”
“Wh-what are you doing?”
The bummer was that John had really done a marvelous job right up until he had messed it all up by getting scared and canceling his whole campaign. Well, Sherlock would just have to pick it up where John had left off.
“You...”
John did not look down. He did not need to look down, he told himself firmly. He kept his eyes sternly fixed on the Adam's apple of his friend and wished that the situation might somehow dissolve without his express participation. Because quite frankly at the moment he was completely unable to function, all his available energy being channelled into the courageous enterprise of Not Getting Hard.
“Don’t be silly”, John starts, but Sherlock shakes his head and mumbles something against John’s thigh.
Sherlock swallows audibly, and John thinks he can feel his entire body vibrating behind him. There is no actual movement though. Just another breath.
Could he do it in a way that John would remain clueless? Probably not.
John is still a bit turned on when he arrives at the clinic. He feels too hot in his pants at first, but it all melds soon into the hubbub of patients and appointment schedules and paperwork. Before lunch he has managed to forget why he feels warm. It all comes back to him when he visits the loo. He hesitates over the waistband of the double pants, it almost feels forbidden taking them off; Sherlock saw him putting them on after all, he might be thinking of John in them right now.
“Haha. And how are you going to name your own blog post then?”
A couple of pairs at least
I will keep them on all day
John took a deep breath, and it was almost a sigh. A happy sigh, Sherlock thought and shifted a little closer on the sofa. There was a warmth radiating from John, and Sherlock was a bit chilly. All those freezers today had left memories on his skin.
“Please, Sherlock, I saw your face after you shot the smiley, I know perfectly well what you were thinking of, now get on with it!”
Never mind, your office temperature should be something between 19-21 Celsius in this weather, and if you sit more than 38 minutes per hour, your body temperature combined with either fabric will make sure you experience some perspiration on the parts of your body that rest against the chair
work. He needed to have John talk about it some more and he knew just the trick to do that. He would be contradictory. He put on a dissatisfied face.
“I am desperate, Sherlock! I've been desperate ever since you... ah... cocked that gun. I'm gonna come any second with your fingers, oh GOD, on my, ooohhh... prostate... Please, Sherlock!"
They are on
There was also a lot about small touches on these websites he browsed, and he wondered if John had got his idea from the same place. Sherlock put some serious thought into this; clearly John had had a lot of success with it. The problem was, though, that Sherlock had been touching John ever since they met; reaching to his pockets, manhandling him during cases, fixing his lapels. It was normal for them. The disheartening fact was that John had obviously never taken it to mean anything more.
“Oh, don't you pull your balls now, John, I want you desperate!”
His fingers hover for a while over John’s wrists and then descend lightly onto the fabric. His touch is so gentle, John can nearly feel it, but fuck how much more sensitive he is for it now. Sherlock simply smooths the fabric of the top most shirt with his fingertips. His hands are trembling slightly now.
They were sitting drinking their morning cups of coffee. John was reading the paper and making faces at the different articles. Sherlock often amused himself by figuring out the piece of news from John’s expressions alone. The particular face John made then, made Sherlock immediately perk up. John licked his lips and grinned and his eyebrow quirked and his mouth opened and closed several times before he finally got out what he wanted to say.
John feels his back burning from the eyes that he knows must follow him all the way down Baker Street until the Vietnamese hairdresser that marks the last spot that can be seen from their apartment. He does not turn to look back.
But Sherlock’s tirade was cut short by John’s lips. They were warm and wet and light against his own. And then they were a whole lot more, and Sherlock pulled John by his neck, and John made a surprised sound in his throat, but scooted closer willingly and then. Then he threaded his hands into Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock was in heaven.
“You’re amazing, you know?” John says, to no one’s surprise at all.
So, that had been then. But this was now, and this now was turning out to be rather disappointing. It had been three weeks since the hospital and the x-ray, and nothing at all interesting had happened. No cuddling or pulling Sherlock close or even bringing him random cups of tea. Nor were there jackets arranged over anyone or any impromptu discussions about childhood.
Usually it takes Sherlock some time to escalate matters and even more usually it’s actually John who starts the undressing bit. Which – usually at least some undressing is required, Sherlock – no matter how elaborate arguments there are for the opposite.
When the cases failed, Sherlock tried to get John interested in one or two of his experiments that could be carried out by lurking in rainy London street corners, but for some reason John did not seem keen to join him.
“You make me hard, Sherlock.”
As a contrast Sherlock’s look is deadly serious. And fixed entirely on John’s left sleeve, where the lighter fabric of the plaid cuff peaks underneath the darker cuff. John has to swallow himself now, because whatever he expected to happen was certainly not on this level of intensity.
I nod in the direction of my office, and when the door is closed, "If you must know, it's the kid."
Instead, I twist my body closer, and my lips crush, mash, grind his mouth with mine.
" Not out trolling tonight, John?” he pokes my arm.
The sofa is not long enough to hold my stretched out body, so I curl up.
You haven’t?
I chortle, but he scowls.
Without John, there it is only a chair, empty.
"Sherlock, how is this going to make me a gentleman of class, who do you think I am James Bond?"
John still wavers.
John rolls his eyes in disgust at Sherlock, but the restaurant reward was worth it.
He exists! He must exist!
Not asking my opinion, but, as per the norm, I follow.
"Hmm, indulge me, John," and getting out of his chair he grabs John by the hand.
But it's me that's more disturbed. At myself.  Maybe I should have left this in the dark. Keep it in the depths of the ‘strange things happen realm.’
For a while, we sit amongst the chatter of children and adults until they move into the next room, and we are alone. Still, the vague sounds we hear keep us paralyzed in our heads.
John Watson! Here!! In my--our flat!
"It's comfortable, and that's why I keep it."
"And Sherlock, why wouldn't I want to continue today?" as I hail a taxi.
“I agree. Not the best decision. Another would be to agree to his payment.”
" I initiated the idea of your shopping. It was required for you to be ignorant and out of peril. On the off chance that you followed me to the roof, Moriarty could use you as collateral. "By the time you returned, I was home and listened to your bitter complaint about nauseous taxi drivers. And proceeded to go on about those individuals who wouldn't get off their rumps to assist in carrying the bags of food."
Preposterous!! Improbable!! Implausible!!
John wavers. Sherlock questions.
But there you stand, in your black trousers and white shirt, barefoot, the tea kettle whistling merrily.
The hour is late when I step into the flat, but Mike, reading a newspaper, glances up, and folds the paper, "John. Glad you're home. I have something to talk about."
"Well, what are you standing there for? You take the food into the kitchen and set it up, and I'll clean up the mess on the stairs."
He doesn't emerge--he doesn't--!
My fear grows, my breath is becoming harder to regulate.
I have to say something, do something, but when I raise my head, the room abruptly moves, reels like a spinning top. The clamor of the pub retreats. I'm in a cotton ball. All the sound muffled. My legs, out of nowhere, give way. I falter, taking hold of the counter. "Wha--wha goin on?"
John gets into the taxi first, and Sherlock follows behind him.
Behind a beefy man sits an archaic PC tilting precariously on a shelf.
Fact--He did depart with me from police headquarters. I distinctly recollect him by my side.
And in that seeing, he understands how genuine this is for me.
My palm contacts his chest, pushing him backward until his legs hit the bed, and he falls onto it.
The ceiling is his view, as he lies stiffly, waiting for me to begin.
Sherlock smiles, "Thanks, John!"
I nudge Mike, “isn't that the same kid from the Hound Dog? The one in that punk outfit? Is it possible?”
So lost in my own head as I'm walking with you, I almost fail to see it--and when I do, I'm brought up short, my heart leaping, my body shuddering.
But now you sit in your dumpy, cushioned chair, shoes off, tea on the little table, book on your lap, and repeat those events over and over again in your little brain.
Puffing out my breath, my hand is clammy because it lays in the small of his back. His shirt does little to stop the burn of his skin.
He seated the violin on the music stand and delicately closed the music sheet. A keepsake for them. Tossing his dark blue coat about him, as though to buffer him from the celebration that isn't his, he strolls out.
The thick down coat drops onto my shoulders, but the routine key jangling is nonexistent.
“And you never will.”
Dropping his hand, he discovers mine and, incredibly, holds it and stands on his toes, "What's best for me is you," he murmurs close to my ear.
Sherlock brushes off his trousers while I look on in total shock! This is not the side of Sherlock Holmes I expected to witness.
My ears hear the delicious music of his voice; however, I cannot be sure it's real.
I'm frigging tired.
His hands thump on the desk," sit down, John Watson. Now,” harshly, his voice never rising.
I poke Mike in the ribs, my head jerking in the direction of the bar. "Wow! Take a look at that kid!" fascinated at the sight of the tall, angular young one leaning his back against the bar, his eyes down, examining the floor.
Deep down, I'm destroyed, trying to ascertain what harm I've wrought to achieve this.
Straightening up, sounding like a squeaky unoiled wheel, “oh no, we can’t do that. We’ll be a joke. No, I would be. No, no.”
His breath is on my face, so close. “Our other option--” his tongue tracing my lips, “confirm it as true.”
The unforeseen softness in Sherlock's voice is startling, "Do you know that a shark must keep swimming while he's sleeping?"
Everything is spinning, turning. I choke, choke again yet nothing comes up.
He was mistaken.
“Okay, what have you done?” my suspicion overriding any faint delight I initially felt at this domestic scene.
I found a book about the solar system which you and I could peruse together.
John hands control of his laptop to Sherlock and everything is quiet.
No--no--no!
"I don't plan on it, Sherlock," his eyes lock onto mine as consistent as the sun rising.
How poetic you have become in your moment of terror, Sherlock Holmes!
Tilted against the building-- a metal telescoping ladder!
"Yoo-hoo, Sherlock. I brought you tea and some hot soup. Have a go at it, and I'll check on you later tonight."
His love of any type of Asian cooking was a staple for our meals.
Brews in hand, we find no space to sit and lean against a wall across from the bar.
“As usual, Sherlock, you are on the money.”
My mouth opens, but nothing emerges because I’m interrupted.
His stare is powerful, drilling into my brain. Maybe he regards me with a new insight.
As of tonight Johns remaining garments still lay strewn on his desk chair.
"Deal."
Sherlock's credit card goes through as he signs the terminal to finalize the sale.
My fingers play a rhythm on the padded arm, "I need a drink," leaping to my feet, "this is not as easy as I thought."
"I speculate it's to do with the wedding," I say, "she doesn't consent to--,"  halted abruptly by his wry chuckle.
Mounting the stairs, I'm bewildered at taking note of the door to the flat being slightly open.
“John,” never taking his eyes off the disarray in front of him, “come look at this,” and gingerly picks out one photograph.
Tapping him on the shoulder, without shifting his position, “I'll be with you in a moment, Doctor Watson.”
For days,
I function physically, well, scarcely.
No heartfelt sighs!
"Open your zipper, with your other hand, but leave the button fastened."
His lips pucker while he gnaws on his lower one and attempts to control his breath well enough to speak.
"Could you account for your actions, John? " the depth of my voice announcing my bafflement.
"A passing fancy. One of my school trips was on a whale-watching boat, and it was enough to capture my imagination. Any nature show on the telly, particularly those about ocean life is one I can sit and watch for hours."
“John,” the sound of his voice is breathtaking, deep in his throat.
"Not possible, I said. I couldn't speak of how, to me, you had gone missing. He'd think I was over the hill--"a finger circling round near my ear.
Sherlock snickers, and is as untroubled as I am agitated. He's nearly bouncing, "do I intimidate you? Is it accurate to say that you are concerned there are wrist bindings concealed someplace on the couch?"
Sherlock takes a seat and waits for John to make his journey into a new man.
I purchase containers of General Tso's chicken, pork fried rice, eggplant with garlic sauce, spring rolls, and a quart of wonton soup.
“Highly unusual it is,” Sherlock's eyes agleam, " I would remember it-- if the circumstance warrants it."
" Dancing! That's it! We'll dance. Tomorrow. Meet me at the Hound at nine."
"The toast is on the table and the coffee also. I figured you could use coffee instead of tea. Sit down," Mike insists, opening the cupboard, "I'll take care of the dishes."
"Wow, that is news. I'm sorry I haven't been keeping in touch with--."
I thrust you up and away, as challenging as it is, your kisses ranging over my face, my neck.
God, how that scene replayed itself over and over after that visit!
No newspaper rattling.
How was I able to concentrate on what was happening on the big screen? If that was a challenge, what was the reward? I shivered just imagining!
“Your last encounter was one of those extremes, wasn't it? Be straightforward and respond truthfully.”
Indeed, that is it!
Or the void that was once cocaine?
(See the end of the chapter for
At any place and at whatever point my body considers it time, my eyes will close.
"Great to see you once more, Doctor Watson. And how are you?” my attention is disrupted by Charlotte, who takes my arm and pulls me to the love seat. I'm not in the mood to be well mannered, and look for an excuse to get away, find it in her empty glass, “would you like some more wine?"
My head hangs on my chest, tears dribble from my eyes, my hands are listless at my side, fingers trembling.
One article of his, if I discover it, will establish his residency in the flat.
His calling me an old man is disturbing. It rankles. I'm not much older than him but, I have to admit, my closet claimed me as old.
The specter of Sherlock is with me consistently. From one perspective, I'm hesitant to see him. Apprehensive that I'd butcher him with my bare hands. John, he could have done more harm. Could have truly harmed me; however, he didn't.
“Have a seat, Doctor Watson," settling my body into a green, dark green, armchair. These Holmes brothers always seem to unnerve me. I don’t know whether it’s their wealth or their damned self-assured selves.
And why that was, I could not ascertain.
The coat went flying, as did my clothes. Scattered to the wilds of the floor.
This rarity of a man.
He paces from his chair to the kitchen, over to the window, and back to the leather armchair, then sits.
" Spencer Hart's Clothing Store."
While clutching the gun in his two hands which shake so severely, I wonder if he'll cause a bullet to fly by mischance.
I open my mouth, lick my lips at the same time as I remove my fingers from their death grip.
“Resistance is futile. ” carelessly tossing me on my stomach, and reworking the chains.
“John, leave the tea,” prickly, his voice deep in his throat.
I pull away, turn about, and about again.
Seeing John's point of view, Sherlock marches into the kitchen and cracks away at doing the dishes. John walks into the kitchen and sees the dishes are loaded correctly.
“John--!
The documents release onto the steps, scattering them.
John Watson!!!
There he is, the twit. At ease in a brown leather chair, his legs crossed, his grey pinstripe suit jacket unbuttoned. The essence of wealth and privilege. And absolutely--shaking my head, staring at the ground, giving me time to figure out-- what?
Sherlock and John walk out the door and into the sound of London's heavy traffic.
“How do you know it’s a man?” still trying to gain composure.
"Kiss you? What the fuck are you thinking? Another maneuver on your part to shift this conversation. As you always manage to do. Divert the blame from you to me."
John had sat at the kitchen table at the flat and invited Sherlock to be his best man. Why he didn't request Mike or Greg remained a puzzle.
"But there's one other thing, Sherlock," knowing the coloring on my cheeks had brightened.
It was the most adorable snicker Sherlock had ever heard from his doctor's mouth.
Sherlock reads the name of the tag "Daniel"
Normally I dash in once a week for two creme-filled donuts, topped with chocolate. My favorite.
The two chairs still opposite each other, framing the fireplace, which at one time held a cozy warmth.
I shiver at the shocking reminder of a similar incident.
He, understanding my agitation, talks peacefully to her.
"Stand up, you fuck, you conceited, egomaniacal, shit," shrieking as I advance closer to him.
Wringing his hands, he sighs, "You don't know what agony I've been going through. And not being able to tell mom and dad my sexual orientation, as you well know, it's been a strain." He ducks his head, sitting cross-legged, "so hard, John. I wish I could say something but--."
“Let us not consume more energy on your past exploits."
"You assumed I had acquired narcotics and was secreted in some bolt hole, is that it?" with an inflection, biting each word.
The craving to represent me in a better light to the doctor and ask his pardon is immense. Twice this week, I have entertained the thought of visiting him and apologizing. In any case, would he welcome my statement? I approach him, not certain how to begin this discussion, "Would a stroll around the house be appropriate for this moment?"
He glances at it, scoffs. “You want a blowjob. It'll cost more than what you essentially put on the bar."
"I knew I had left it someplace easy to find. Here," stretching over the counter, clutching a card between her fingers.
A female driver with blonde hair is in the driver's seat.
Nevertheless, this is what I pay for and carry out in the plastic sacks.
Disposing of his coat, kicking off his shoes, he crawls into Johns bed, folds the jumper around his neck, and discovers tears flowing over his face and the pillow.
Sherlock in his robe, I wrapped in a towel next to him, looking up as if entranced. And dozens more.
In my mind, lives a whole room overflowing with John Watson random data.
"Here's the deal. You'll keep all your smelly experiments out of the frig, and you can borrow my laptop. Deal?"
“Lay off the ridicule. I’m serious.”
"You--mean--love? Love?"
"Aha, just like you," reversing my position, stomping to the kitchen to pick up the teapot from the stove, all the while talking, no sputtering is more like it.
Did I commit another faux pas? I inhale deep and address him once more, “what might you say to a peaceful arrangement? I would invite the chance to sit and have a repast in a quiet restaurant."
“Whatever this is, this telling, I understand you are apprehensive of how I will react to it. Am I correct, John?”
The ordeal I had faced certainly felt downright authentic.
"Please, don't, don't," my breath shallow, eyes wide.
I pull my laptop out of Sherlock's hands, sitting it on the table, and recline into my chair.
I can feel his mind whirring and almost see the air around him reverberate.
Sherlock pivots slightly too close. To close to be comfortable and, inhaling, I take a step back.
No John Watson?
But in his pretentiousness, he believed that Johns' reality rotated around him. Such was the assumption. It was John. And John understood Sherlock as no one else had.
"Am I supposed to know him? One of the felons from this?" pointing at the records I dropped off.
(See the end of the chapter for
It's difficult to drag myself to the sofa, but I do, just minutes before she enters.
"I was only--."
“Wow! You got dumped!” Mike declared.
“John, leave the damn tea,” bristling, my voice somewhere deep in my throat.
"How long have I resided here?"
" I imagine you find yourself in all kinds of situations. Some that might need your special-- brand of attention", he states, addressing himself to Mike. He intends to dig at me. To make me uncomfortable, and he is. Oh, shit! This is going to be one hell of an evening!
Waiting for the pot to boil, I lean out, "and when will this happy event occur? The wedding, I mean," as I bring in the cups.
Never a complaint.
Oh, wait! Why not take my reward! If he could see my face now, he'd see an evil grin that takes over.
Snorting with the exertion and crying out, "Fucking--why? Why?" his upheaval bubbling over as additional punches hit my body.
"But then, I stood motionless. Fixed in place because," as I look up at the ceiling, confusion taking hold.
After depositing the youngster with her educator, I become overpowered with an unusual sentiment of which I can't name. I do not understand how to overcome the awkwardness now assailing myself. I sit on a bench, and John slides alongside. My hand covers his and. I sense his tremble though he doesn't withdraw his hand.
I step up to the desk, which houses a heap of bins of papers, an old-fashioned dial telephone, and a Rolodex.
Nine, he said. Tomorrow night, he said. Indeed, John Watson, you're in for one serious ride!
She holds her hands against her ears after the door is open, "Oww, don't shout. What is it, Sherlock?"
Might I be inclined to give up my hunt and linger?
The calling of my name from his lips is a gift I never weary of, and take a sit on the coffee table.
The tick-tocking of the clock on the mantle and the swoosh of vehicles outside only reflect my loneliness back at me.
With a sigh, a voice laced with disdain. “I thought we had an appointment. What in hell are you doing here?”
Everything is as it was!
I feel the heat rise to my cheeks, my stomach does a twist, wishing I was anywhere else but here.
He harrumphs, "my body isn't available to be purchased, and if it were, it would be more than you would pay, old man."
His mouth opens, his eyes, those radiant eyes stare.
At the twelfth step, the rear of the armchair emerges into my view--and-- no!
But he-he, who stands by my side, captures my arm.
I watch as he rises and steps unflinchingly toward me, his eyes meeting mine with a surety I've never seen before.
"You made me do that, "rushing to the farthest end of the room, pulling at my hair, my shirt.
I know with conviction that Mrs. Hudson is reporting to my brother.
I can’t look at his face but stare down at his expensive black shoes.
He would always complain about how presumptuous it was for me to leave him without giving of information on my whereabouts.
"John, John," rocking to and fro, mouthing his cries within the sweater.
"My brain reasoned that you ducked into a shop, but that was not to be, so I called a taxi and headed to the flat. Maybe you had gone home and "--,pointedly waiting for his retort, which didn't come.
He regards me, his eyes assessing my features. "I can't comprehend why. But, Doctor Watson, you're an enigma. A perplexity I have yet to solve." With a toss of his curls he says, “The house-- eight tonight,” and he's out the door.
John Watson was the breathing space that quieted my turbulent mind.
In one trillion years, even this remarkable genius could never envision anything close to what actually happened.
"Shiitttt," pulling senselessly on the restraints, it's calfskin edge abrading my wrist.
Sherlock sticks out his hand and says, "Deal."
Without considering any factors--letting go of my reserves, I lay my fingers on Sherlock's arm. "Did you know, Sherlock, that seahorses mate for life, and the male bears the young?"
John will be in there obtaining his typical purchase of chocolate somethings.
Sliding in, I casually bring my thigh against his, my hand rests alongside. As my hand leaves the seat to rest on his knee, his arm wraps around my shoulder. Suddenly the tension breaks, we both laugh, and as quickly go quiet. Is it my inhaled breath I hear or both? Closer our heads meet, my eyes never leaving his lips. His thumb strokes my lower lip, his tongue follows. It's not important or relevant, which is the first to place lip to lip. Only that it happened and it feels like it never should stop.
Standing to his full height, he strikes his umbrella on the carpet.
"Sherlock, where?"
After coming back into our flat, washing my hands, and standing in the sitting room watching Sherlock on my laptop, ignoring me I resign myself again too, no, wait a minute! I have an idea.
The Blog!
"Don't fumble, John. Do use your words," him being cheeky as ever.
“Kindly don't. I maintain close surveillance of him--when I can. He tends to--go to extremes, and evade my policing.”
He takes the necessary steps forward, and when his younger brother does not acknowledge him, I puff out my exasperation and reach for the item.
Upon opening his nightstand drawer--I see it -- the Beretta 92FS!
How could I have--and for why did I listen--?
Out of nowhere, I'm uncertain, stuck. I can't progress, but can't pull back.
“Received it last night from the Inspector Detective.”
Once again, at the ready to play down his brothers' role, "yet, John Watson, here I sit before you. How do you justify this?” lips curling.
His neck is tucked up tightly into his shoulders, his hands clenched into fists that lie at his sides, and his face is a bright scarlet.
Sherlock's arm slips around my waist, pulling me in towards him. Too close, too familiar.
"Never mind my shivering," banging his clenched hands against his thighs, scarcely restraining himself.
His tongue swipes at my ear and says, “ We're going to dance, John. An unconventional kind of dance. I lead, and you adhere to the instructions. Understand?"
He carelessly dumps my clothes on the bed and swiftly moves to the farthest end of the room.
I could have--but then--I stop and with the moment ripe for confession, I whisper, "I love you."
My eyes widen, and I experience--Deja Vous!
Clearing my throat, I recognize I'm doing anything to stall, anything to keep from-- but no--I have to persist.
Snapping, “don't know what you're talking about,” and leave him quickly, finding relief in joining a conversation concerning this weeks rugby match.
“What squabble are you vocalizing about? We are conversing. Now leave,” pushing his chair away as he stands. Ignoring his elder brother, he sweeps the envelope out of my hand and plops onto his black leather chair.
His fist to my nose continues with hardly a pause in between by another hit to my stomach.
He nods a yes and I stretch my hand out for him to continue, "months ago, she asked me out, and we've been seeing each other almost every night. I was quite frank with her about my sexuality. And she's okay. It seems she has no interest in sex. Claims to be asexual. All she wants is a husband and a good home. We've agreed to marry and adopt a child. And Dad probably won't mind about adoption."
He shakes his head, chuckles although deep down he's not laughing, "You mean you're going out with him? Like dating?"
I'm so furious I could spit iron, and I'm insane with worry.
"Seriously though, are you alright, and is there anything I can do?" stepping closer, then moving off when I shake my head no. "No. I have to rest that's all," concluding that I can't attend patients in my current state.
“Yeah
“How’s the case?” “Fine.” “…Okay.”
He did not notice me, but all the time during the film, I watched his face, every feature of him was perfect. I felt my hands trembling as I looked into those watery blue eyes. I struggled to control myself, as I fought back the urge to touch him. He was so small, so extraordinary, and yet far beyond my reach.
“Why?”
“Years ago, I was not a pirate. In fact, in my younger days, I helped the police solve strange cases. I was a detective back then. And I had a partner. My best friend. John. And… err… we got along very very well. I’ve always liked him, no, I
. John made him complete. He no longer needed to be alone. Why would he? He had a
The rusty iron door squeaked as Sherlock pushed it open. He would still shiver when he set foot on this very area, where he had had his near-death experience a few years ago. Now he’s here again, bravely facing his doomed fate. He’d be ready for anything, just to protect John.
“You may as well pull the trigger, you dirty slugs.” John said.
Isn’t it rude to be texting when you are… busy
John did not have much choice before him, so he decided to visit the younger Holmes. Hopefully he could get closer to Mycroft and destroy whatever was between him and Greg.
And I’m starving!
Moriarty reached his hands to pull Sherlock out, and he stumbled on the ground. He was in a kneeling position for so long that his legs were weak.
John was disgusted. Pirates did not deserve to have manners. And he certainly would not shake that filthy hand. John ignored the outstretched hand before him, and looked sideways.
At that blink moment, I could control myself no more, and I stared into his eyes.
Finished, in fact. Arrest the external affairs manager in the company.
John looked at the defenseless Sherlock and sighed. Seeing that there was no other choice, he put the gun on the floor, ignoring Sherlock’s strained shouting for him to stop. John put both of his hands up.
Was enough to give me a total heartbreak.
The captain stood with his back facing John. “Greetings, captain of the Victress. We welcome you on board the Jolly Mary.” He turned around and held out a hand, “Captain Holmes. Captain Sherlock Holmes. Pleasure to meet you.”
Gregory, maybe you should also stop texting and come to the bedroom.
Took your hand in mine,
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Oh god, brother dear, are you seriously daring me to tell everyone what you did every night with the DI in your house? I can
How he wanted to open the door, pull Sherlock into an embrace, whisper “you are perfect” in his ears and kiss him senseless! How he wanted to date Sherlock like a normal person! How he wanted to live with Sherlock forever and ever! How he wanted to lift that terrible curse!
Greg had been gone for four hours and not a word was heard from him. John went to the pub, ordered pint after pint of beer to escape from his sadness. He lingered for hours until the first break of dawn. Then he staggered back home, barely conscious.
“What are you doing here?” John asked with a snort. “Shouldn’t you be out there mingling with your disgusting friends?”
Sherlock sighed.
He woke up from the hospital bed, blinding bright light giving him headaches. How he wanted to die.
He had heard the gunshots outside. And his great mind had not failed him. The great detective had deduced everything.
“No. No. No!”
“No one cares or loves me, brother dear.”
“I’ve always needed excitement in my life, to keep me from falling apart. First it was cutting, then drugs, then my work. Finally, you. John, you are the high I’m never tired of. It’s always you, John Watson, you keep me right.”
“I didn’t say anything.” That smirk returned. “Anyway, there’s not much I can do here. Good morning.” And he strode off, swinging his umbrella.
I walked to where he lay so still,
I regretted hurting him, I only cared about my pride, and I failed to nothing how much he loved me, and, being an emotional person, he could not bear my unkind remarks about him. All those pained whispers, they were his way of begging for forgiveness, and saying goodbye to me one last time. His redden eyes were his thirst for me. He begged me to forgive him, and begged me to understand him, but I didn’t. I turned away.
“And I’m bloody well glad I don’t have a soul mark. Especially not of you. Tell whatever created this soulmate business to sod off. He’d made a mistake. You don’t deserve one.”
I cried, I cried. I died in vain.
Sherlock also loved John.
“That’s why you went crazy these three days? That’s why you tried to avoid me? So that I will be angered enough to hate you and leave you?” Sherlock said, still with that weird look on his face.
Mycroft blushed even more. “What the f… Sherlock."
“Yes my dear. Find John Watson. And bring him to me.”
Moriarty looked amused. “You know, Johnny, that you never cease to amaze me. I had wanted to play with Sherlock a little longer, but seeing you begging, it is a really rare opportunity.
“Do you know why?” Sherlock continued. John looked up quizzically.
“Mycroft Holmes.” He held out his hand. Greg almost screamed. “I am aware that you have been searching for me, Mr. Lestrade. May I enquire what the reason might be?”
“C’mon John! You can do better than this.” Greg’s mocking voice came a few meters ahead. “Oh, silly me, I forgot your legs are so short.”
Taking the opportunity when John went to a date, Sherlock did one of his experiment. This time on the prolonged metabolic stages of cell respiration after death. He just finished his experiment when his phone flashed. It was a text alert from an unknown sender.
“Alright, alright there, Mr. Smart. In human language that means you’re in love. You know how many times I tried to break that wall of ice of you, I tried. But nothing, nothing happened.”
Why was I thinking about that? Nonono, I must not let negative emotions cloud my judgements.
“No time to cry, Sherlock. Say goodbye one last time to your beloved London.” Moriarty said in a eerie voice so soft it sent the chills down one’s spinal cord. Suddenly he grabbed Sherlock’s collar and whispered in his ears, “That’s what you get for upsetting Sebastian.”
No serial killer leaves death notes.
The door was opened and the figure of Greg walked in. He saw John, hungover, lying on the sofa. “Woah friend, what happened to you?” He poured a cup of water but John would not drink it. He was still furious.
With trembling hands he made the first cut.
“Just… stop… fighting me…
“Well,” he cleared his throat, “that ship, about 250 miles away, to the north, that’s our target. Go blast a hole in its golden hull! Ready the canons!” He gave the orders with confidence.
Every morning he took his gun from the cabinet, readied himself for joining his friends at last. As he took the safety off, he would change his mind and put it back. Coward, he called himself.
Now, we are planning our next move. The official ceremony will probably be held soon, as Sherlock’s mummy prefers a summer wedding. We’ll be handing out invitation cards in a few days. I really hope that everyone here can come and share the happy moment with us.
I calmed down. Well, sort of.
“Board the Victress! Capture the crew! Bring them to me!” Sherlock shouted. Another ship I conquered, he thought. Pirates’ realm. No one could trespass.
“I know, Mycroft. But I have to go. I can’t let them torture John, while I am happily sitting in this den, hiding. This is all my fault. If I haven’t chased after Moriarty, this will never happen. John is my everything, and I cannot let him die, because of my career, because of me.” Sherlock said with a hint of sadness in his voice.
“M…Mycroft, I think I know where Sherlock is. I can remember its neighbourhood.”
I was tired of Mycroft’s lectures. I was not a kid anymore, for God’s sake. I had had enough of my childhood listening to him instructing me this and that. I was annoyed of how he always outwitted me, how he always saw through me. I pushed him out. I couldn’t see why he was caring about me so much, why he couldn’t just leave me alone.
I observed his face, and I saw a face loaded with joy and cheerfulness that he never showed when he was out with me. Every time I sat in the house, he pulled that serious, and done face and he was so constantly full of worries. But to his date, he got a charming smile, and they were a nice little couple.
Sherlock was forced to whip John.
For once actually, Sherlock, I agree with Mycroft. You should better put that damn phone down and shut your mouth. Or if you decide to be disobedient, I’ll make sure you regret it. -JW
That is exactly what I love about him. He is like a… a… little hedgehog. Weak and small, but fiercely hot. He’s my dearest blogger and doctor.
My friend, my hero,
Sherlock continued staring for a long while, with no intention of softening his facial expression.
John continued, “I’m John, John Watson, the man you’ve been looking for. I… I…” He was dazzled. He didn’t even know what emotions he was feeling. Wild with joy? Confused? Astonished?
Sherlock heaved a long sigh. He picked John up and kissed him softly on the cheek, whispering, “You’d never know how much I love you. Goodbye John, find yourself a girlfriend, and stay away from danger. Have a happy family, be a father, alright?”
No response. What was she doing in the bedroom? Maybe washing-up? Or just entertaining herself browsing around my blog? I tip-toed towards the closed bedroom door, forming an attempt to give her a nice little scare.
“That’s not true. Just because you don’t care about friends, doesn’t mean you don’t have them.”
John, again, wanted to talk back, but was interrupted by another kiss from Sherlock.
Patience, I'm hurrying on this now
Just ask him to pick up his phone. I’m texting him the case.
A month before that fateful day on which he took his life, when he was still with me, I woke up one day as usual, much earlier than Sherlock. And at eleven, the alarm went off and I knocked on his bedroom door. With no response, I kicked it open, and said, “Wake up, Sherlock, it’s eleven.”
Moriarty felt light. He was always amazed by how obedient and small his Sebby was before him. He was like a tiny little bean, adorable.
I resume my hold on the teapot and turn on the faucet for water, letting it run into the pot. I hear myself screeching like a cat, unable to simmer down, "and here you are, sitting in your chair like the queen of England. Shit."
Tugging at his sleeve, he turns to look at me--those eyes--those eyes. "Sherlock. Can we--oh, I don't know," brushing my fingers through my hair, "how about friends. And this time I mean it."
“Sherlock tends to be bored with people. Well, that's true for almost anything. He's a Mensa genius. Sherlock is residing here with Mycroft so he can take charge of Sherlock's life. Keep him from straying too far," she hums softly. "But Sherlock has a habit of picking a pawn and devouring him. When he's burnt out with that game, he goes to another. Several days, two or three weeks, and he's finished with them. For the most part, men."
I had committed the blunder of insisting on a walk.
My left hand drifts up and into my jacket pocket, where I touch metal.
She shrugs, "My names Charlotte," not offering her hand, "Oh, curiosity. I always take an interest in what those young men," gesturing towards the brothers, “are doing. A cautionary warning. Watch out for Sherlock. You could be the next victim.”
Time to come clean. Time to voice what I have had in my head for years.
"You know I don't pick up just anybody,” however, I keep tabs on him as something unknown hits my innards. He casts a spell that butchers my confidence. He's stunning! He's striking! He's hitting every button. I'm lightheaded, off-balance.
"No," he lifts his hand as if to strike again," you fucking git, you don't get to have a say in this," with a flourish of his hand, he ushers me in.
"Hey, wait up. To be honest, I wasn't sure you would have me around without--,"
Numb to all else, I lay the two bags of food on the kitchen table and drop my arms, staring at nothingness.
Settling in my chair, I spread my fingers apart, gazing at each digit and willing them to clutch at my throat so as not to articulate the unspoken.
The bakery, I believe would remember, must know the whereabouts of the ladder or the knowledge of who does.
I recalled how disturbing it was to see some other body than yours in that leather chair.
There's nothing amiss with me! Nothing whatsoever!
"Do you have anything other than suits or punk duds to wear?" he grins upon my entering the aquarium.
I become Irate that my 'friends' do perpetually assume my usage of narcotics.
He sighs, more in wonder at my curse, lifts his arms in exasperation, and sits down, his eyes chasing me across the room.
Step into his space. Toe to toe. My eyes never move off his features. My hands hang at my sides.
There's no off-chance.
Yes, criminals tend to do that,” the first sign of lightness, a chuckle.
"Yes. A request for drinks at the Holmes house. Do you want to go?" Can't get away from this. I know we have to because there is no excuse that Mike will accept.
